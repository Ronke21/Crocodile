<text>The California grizzly bear (Ursus arctos californicus), also known as the California golden bear, is an extinct population of the brown bear, generally known (together with other North American brown bear populations) as the grizzly bear. &quot;Grizzly&quot; could have meant &quot;grizzled&quot; that is, with golden and grey tips of the hair or &quot;fear-inspiring&quot; (as a phonetic spelling of &quot;grisly&quot;). Nonetheless, after careful study, naturalist George Ord formally classified it in 1815 – not for its hair, but for its character – as &quot;Ursus horribilis&quot; (&quot;terrifying bear&quot;). Genetically, North American brown bears are closely related; in size and coloring, the California grizzly bear was much like the Kodiak bear of the southern coast of Alaska. The grizzly became a symbol of the Bear Flag Republic, a moniker that was attached to the short-lived attempt by a group of U.S. settlers to break away from Mexico in 1846. Later, this rebel flag became the basis for the state flag of California, and then California was known as the &quot;Bear State&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
A 1953 researcher stated, &quot;The specific status of North American brown bears (or grizzly bears) is one of the most complex problems of mammalian taxonomy. The difficulty stems directly from the work of Merriam (1918), who concluded that there are 86 forms of grizzlies (and brown bears) in North America.&quot;

North American brown bears were taxonomically grouped as a species apart from other bear species, until DNA testing revealed that they should properly be grouped in the same species as the other brown bears. Grizzlies living in California had been classified by Merriam into many subspecies. A recent study based on mitochondrial DNA suggests that the only genetically anomalous grouping of grizzly bears is the ABC Islands bear, implying that previous grizzly bear subspecies designations are unwarranted. However, a formal taxonomic synonymy was not performed, and mitochondrial introgression is known to be an issue in brown bears. Pending further taxonomic resolution, the subspecies is provisionally accepted as separate.

== Appearance ==
The California grizzly was historically considered an enormous bear. Father Pedro Font, an early missionary, described the local grizzly bears, writing, &quot;He was horrible, fierce, large, and fat.&quot; In the 1800s, multiple newspaper accounts mentioned bears weighing well over ; the hind foot of one particular adult male grizzly was measured at long by wide, and claws were often wide by long. Measurements of museum specimens, however, demonstrate that this bear was no larger than those present in the rest of North America, with average body size estimates ranging from to depending on methodology.

The fur of the California grizzly bear has been described as golden brown, leading to the occasional name &quot;California golden bear&quot;. The captive individual &quot;Monarch&quot; had a dark brown, almost black, pelt.

== Diet and behavior ==
The diet of the California grizzly bear was diverse, ranging from plant sources like grasses, seeds, berries, and acorns, to animal sources such as elk, deer, salmon, steelhead, and carrion. Isotopic study indicates that the majority of the diet consisted of plant matter, as with other grizzly bear populations. Anecdotal reports from Spanish explorers reported California grizzly bears scavenging on beached whale carcasses. After the introduction of European livestock, California grizzly bears increasingly incorporated cattle into their diets. California grizzly bears were primarily solitary, except for mothers with cubs, but foraging groups of up to 40 have been reported.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Prior to Spanish settlement in the second half of the 1700s, it is estimated that 10,000 grizzly bears inhabited what is modern-day California. It is thought that the bears lived across almost the entirety of the state, save its most southeastern and northeastern corners. Probably the southernmost records for this subspecies are from the Sierra de Juárez, during the 18th century. The bear was most abundant in chaparral, oak woodland, and hardwood forests.

== Relationship with humans ==

=== European contact ===

The first documented sighting of a grizzly bear in California occurred in 1603 when a Spanish explorer near Monterey described how bears came down to feed on a whale carcass stranded on the beach. However, his reports were not widely circulated, so the existence of grizzlies in California was not well-known to Europeans until the eighteenth century.

Western Europeans&#x27; first well-circulated encounters with California grizzly bears are found in diaries kept by several members of the 1769 Portola expedition, the first European land exploration of what is now the state of California. Several place names that include the Spanish word for bear (&quot;oso&quot;) trace their origins back to that first overland expedition (e.g. Los Osos). As the settled frontier of New Spain was extended northward, settlers began to populate California and establish large cattle herds as the main industry. The ranchers&#x27; livestock were easy prey for the largely herbivorous-omnivorous grizzly bears found across the state. In turn, grizzly populations increased around human settlements. By eating their livelihood, and scaring them, the grizzlies became enemies of the rancheros. &quot;Vaqueros&quot; hunted the grizzlies, often roping and capturing them alive to be pitted against other animals in public battles (bloodsports).

In 1866, a grizzly bear described as weighing as much as was killed in what is present-day Valley Center, California, in the north-central area of San Diego County. The incident was recalled in 1932 by Catherine E. Lovett Smith, who witnessed the bear&#x27;s killing on her family&#x27;s ranch when she was just six years old. If its measurements are accurate, this particular bear was the biggest bear ever found in California and one of the largest specimens of any bear species ever recorded. (Other sources confirm Lovett Smith&#x27;s account of the bear, but differ as to its exact size.) Her telling of that bear is part of the oral history of &quot;Bear Valley&quot;, the original name for Valley Center. The bear was prominent in the Big Sur region of the central California coast. Frank Post, born in 1859 on the Soberanes Ranch in Big Sur, remembered when his family lived at Soberanes Creek, during the American Civil War – recalling the &quot;Great Sur Bears&quot;. Inhabiting most of the state, both inland and coastally, it is likely the California grizzly&#x27;s southernmost range in the state overlapped with that of the now-extinct Mexican grizzly bear, as well.

=== Extinction ===
In the late 1700s, Spanish ranchers placed a poisoned &quot;bait ball&quot; made of suet or swine entrails filled with a lethal dose of strychnine which they hung from the branches of a tree within reach of the bear but out of reach of dogs and children. Mexican settlers captured bears for bear and bull fights and they also sold their skins for 6 to 10 pesos to trading ships. Bear Trap Canyon near Bixby Creek was one of their favorite sites for trapping grizzly bears along the central California coast. These bears were even turned into furniture, such as a chair gifted to President Andrew Johnson in 1865.

Bear-baiting events flourished as popular spectacles in 19th century California. Bloody fights that pitted bears against bulls often inspired betting as to whether the bear or the bull would win. One persistently popular, but false phrase origin story related to these fights stems from famous 19th-century newspaperman Horace Greeley. While visiting California, Greeley allegedly witnessed such a fight, and supposedly gave the modern stock market its &quot;bear&quot; and &quot;bull&quot; nicknames based on the fighting styles of the two animals: the bear swipes downward while the bull hooks upward. In truth, the phrase&#x27;s origins predate Greeley&#x27;s 1859 journey to California by at least 100 years, but the myth of the California connection persists.
&quot;The Monterey County Herald&quot; noted on July 4, 1874:
In the early to mid 19th century, livestock from the ranchos of California provided an abundant food source for the bears, allowing the grizzly population to expand rapidly. However, the cattle population was greatly diminished following extreme drought and flooding in the 1860s and 1870s, leading to a reduction in the number of grizzlies. This coincided with an increased interest in bear hunting, both for sport and commercial purposes. Grizzly bear meat became a mainstay on restaurant menus in the San Gabriel area; according to Mike Davis, “The paws from adult bears and the flesh from young cubs were deemed particular delicacies.”

European settlers paid bounties on the bears who regularly preyed on livestock until the early 20th century. Absolom (Rocky) Beasley hunted grizzly bears throughout the Santa Lucia Mountains and claimed to have killed 139 bears in his lifetime. Noted California mountain man Seth Kinman claimed to have shot over 800 grizzly bears in a 20-year period in the areas surrounding present day Humboldt County. One prospector in Southern California, William F. Holcomb (nicknamed &quot;Grizzly Bill&quot; Holcomb), was particularly well known for hunting grizzly bears in what is now San Bernardino County.

During September 1897, in the mountains between Inwood and Mt. Lassen, Shasta County, 21-year-old Elias Weigart and his dog encountered a huge California grizzly whose front track measured and the rear, . The bear died after Weigart emptied his Winchester 38-55 into the beast at close range.

In 1920, the Shuteye Peak area of Madera County was home to one of the last California grizzlies, nicknamed &#x27;Two Toes,&#x27; who lost part of his front foot in a trap and evaded hunters for years.

The last hunted California grizzly bear was shot in Tulare County, California, in August 1922, although no body, skeleton or pelt was ever produced. Less than 75 years after the discovery of gold in 1848, almost every grizzly bear in California had been tracked down and killed. In 1924, what was thought to be a grizzly was spotted in Sequoia National Park for the last time and thereafter, grizzlies were never seen again in California.

=== Reintroduction ===
Support to reintroduce grizzlies to the state is growing. Despite having one of the largest American black bear populations in the nation, California still has habitat that can sustain about 500 grizzlies; it is thought that the presence of an additional large mammal could curb overpopulation of the smaller black bear, which often is involved in human-bear conflicts, as it enters human settlements in pursuit of food and trash. In 2014, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service received, and subsequently rejected, a petition to reintroduce grizzly bears to California. In 2015, the Center for Biological Diversity launched a petition aimed at the California state legislature to reintroduce the grizzly bear to the state.

In anticipation of the 2024 centennial marking the final recorded sighting of a wild grizzly bear in California, a collaborative effort was initiated by scientists affiliated with the Research Network, prominent leaders from California Tribes, and advocates associated with conservation nonprofits. This initiative resulted in the establishment of the California Grizzly Alliance.

Despite these efforts, however, their reintroduction remains controversial. Arguments against grizzly bear reintroduction emphasize the potential for rare but significant harm, such as attacks causing injuries or fatalities. Those who deem any harm, especially loss of human life, as morally unacceptable view the reintroduction in California as an intolerable threat, regardless of individual risk.

=== Symbolism ===
The California grizzly bear is one of the state&#x27;s most visible and enduring symbols, adorning both the state flag and seal. The Bear Flag first flew in 1846 as a symbol of the short-lived California Republic. A second version was adopted as the state flag by the state legislature in 1911. The bear symbol became a permanent part of the state seal in 1849. The California grizzly bear was designated the official state animal in 1953. The bear is celebrated in name and as mascot of the sports teams of the University of California, Berkeley (the California Golden Bears), and of the University of California, Los Angeles (the UCLA Bruins) and in the mascot of University of California, Riverside (the UC Riverside Highlanders). The California Maritime Academy operates a training ship named Golden Bear.

The name &quot;Yosemite&quot; likely originates from the indigenous Ahwahneechee word for grizzly bear, &quot;Oo-soo-mah-ty&quot; or &quot;Yo-hem-ah-ty,&quot; which directly refers to the animal. James M. Hutchings, a pioneer in promoting Yosemite tourism, named the monumental sequoia Grizzly Giant. He chose the name to evoke the formidable presence, massive stature, and rugged independence of the California grizzly bear.

<doc id="432213" wikidata="Q191024" url="?curid=432213" title="15 puzzle">
<text>The 15 puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen, Mystic Square and more) is a sliding puzzle. It has 15 square tiles numbered 1 to 15 in a frame that is 4 tile positions high and 4 tile positions wide, with one unoccupied position. Tiles in the same row or column of the open position can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically, respectively. The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in numerical order (from left to right, top to bottom).

Named after the number of tiles in the frame, the 15 puzzle may also be called a &quot;16 puzzle&quot;, alluding to its total tile capacity. Similar names are used for different sized variants of the 15 puzzle, such as the 8 puzzle, which has 8 tiles in a 3×3 frame.

The &quot;n&quot; puzzle is a classical problem for modeling algorithms involving heuristics. Commonly used heuristics for this problem include counting the number of misplaced tiles and finding the sum of the taxicab distances between each block and its position in the goal configuration. Note that both are &quot;admissible&quot;. That is, they never overestimate the number of moves left, which ensures optimality for certain search algorithms such as A*.

==Mathematics==
=== Solvability ===

 used a parity argument to show that half of the starting positions for the &quot;n&quot; puzzle are impossible to resolve, no matter how many moves are made. This is done by considering a binary function of the tile configuration that is invariant under any valid move and then using this to partition the space of all possible labelled states into two mutually inaccessible equivalence classes of the same size. This means that half of all positions are unsolvable, although it says nothing about the remaining half.

The invariant is the parity of the permutation of all 16 squares plus the parity of the taxicab distance (number of rows plus number of columns) of the empty square from the lower right corner. This is an invariant because each move changes both the parity of the permutation and the parity of the taxicab distance. In particular, if the empty square is in the lower right corner, then the puzzle is solvable only if the permutation of the remaining pieces is even.

 also showed that on boards of size &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are both larger or equal to 2, all even permutations &quot;are&quot; solvable. It can be proven by induction on &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, starting with &quot;m&quot; = &quot;n&quot; = 2. This means that there are exactly two equivalency classes of mutually accessible arrangements, and that the parity described is the only non-trivial invariant, although equivalent descriptions exist.

 gave another proof, based on defining equivalence classes via a Hamiltonian path.

 studied the generalization of the 15 puzzle to arbitrary finite graphs, the original problem being the case of a 4×4 grid graph. The problem has some degenerate cases where the answer is either trivial or a simple combination of the answers to the same problem on some subgraphs. Namely, for paths and polygons, the puzzle has no freedom; if the graph is disconnected, only the connected component of the vertex with the &quot;empty space&quot; is relevant; and if there is an articulation vertex, the problem reduces to the same puzzle on each of the biconnected components of that vertex. Excluding these cases, Wilson showed that other than one exceptional graph on 7 vertices, it is possible to obtain all permutations unless the graph is bipartite, in which case exactly the even permutations can be obtained. The exceptional graph is a regular hexagon with one diagonal and a vertex at the center added; only of its permutations can be attained, which gives an instance of the exotic embedding of S5 into S6.

For larger versions of the &quot;n&quot; puzzle, finding a solution is easy. But, the problem of finding the &quot;shortest&quot; solution is NP-hard. It is also NP-hard to approximate the fewest slides within an additive constant, but there is a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation. For the 15 puzzle, lengths of optimal solutions range from 0 to 80 single-tile moves (there are 17 configurations requiring 80 moves) or 43 multi-tile moves; the 8 Puzzle always can be solved in no more than 31 single-tile moves or 24 multi-tile moves (integer sequence A087725). The multi-tile metric counts subsequent moves of the empty tile in the same direction as one.

The number of possible positions of the 24 puzzle is ≈ , which is too many to calculate God&#x27;s number feasibly using brute-force methods. In 2011, lower bounds of 152 single-tile moves or 41 multi-tile moves had been established, as well as upper bounds of 208 single-tile moves or 109 multi-tile moves. In 2016, the upper bound was improved to 205 single-tile moves.

===Group theory===
The transformations of the 15 puzzle form a groupoid (not a group, as not all moves can be composed); this groupoid acts on configurations.

Because the combinations of the 15 puzzle can be generated by 3-cycles, it can be proved that the 15 puzzle can be represented by the alternating group formula_1. In fact, any formula_2 sliding puzzle with square tiles of equal size can be represented by formula_3.
==History==
The puzzle was &quot;invented&quot; by Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in Canastota, New York, who is said to have shown friends, as early as 1874, a precursor puzzle consisting of 16 numbered blocks that were to be put together in rows of four, each summing to 34 (see magic square). Copies of the improved 15 puzzle made their way to Syracuse, New York, by way of Chapman&#x27;s son, Frank, and from there, via sundry connections, to Watch Hill, Rhode Island, and finally to Hartford, Connecticut, where students in the American School for the Deaf started manufacturing the puzzle. By December 1879, these were sold both locally and in Boston, Massachusetts. Shown one of these, Matthias Rice, who ran a woodworking business in Boston, started manufacturing the puzzle sometime in December 1879 and convinced a &quot;Yankee Notions&quot; fancy goods dealer to sell them under the name of &quot;Gem Puzzle.&quot; In late January 1880, Charles Pevey, a dentist in Worcester, Massachusetts, garnered some attention by offering a cash reward for a solution to the 15 Puzzle.

The game became a craze in the U.S. in 1880.

Chapman applied for a patent on his &quot;Block Solitaire Puzzle&quot; on February 21, 1880. However, this patent was rejected, likely because it was not sufficiently different from the August 20, 1878 &quot;Puzzle-Blocks&quot; patent (US 207124) granted to Ernest U. Kinsey.

=== Sam Loyd ===

From 1891 until his death in 1911, Sam Loyd claimed that he had invented the puzzle. However, Loyd had no connection to the invention or initial popularity of the puzzle. Loyd&#x27;s first article about the puzzle was published in 1886, and it was not until 1891 that he first claimed to be the inventor.

Some later interest was fueled by Loyd&#x27;s offer of a $1,000 prize () to anyone who could provide a solution for achieving a particular combination specified by Loyd, namely reversing the 14 and 15, which Loyd called the 14-15 puzzle. This is impossible, as had been shown over a decade earlier by , because it requires a transformation from an even to an odd permutation.

==Varieties of the 15 puzzle==
The Minus Cube, manufactured in the USSR, is a 3D puzzle with similar operations to the 15 Puzzle.

Versions of the 15 puzzle include a different number of tiles, such as the 8-puzzle or 24-puzzle.

== Pop culture ==

<doc id="432214" wikidata="Q7599879" url="?curid=432214" title="Stanley Porteus">
<text>Stanley David Porteus (April 24, 1883 – October 21, 1972) was an Australian psychologist and author.

==Early life==
Porteus was born at Box Hill, Victoria, Australia, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. His father was a Methodist minister, and the family moved frequently. He attended the Melbourne Education Institute on a three-year scholarship and completed his studies in 1899. He began teaching, and in 1909 he married Frances Mainwaring Evans. They eventually had two sons together.

==Career==
===Teaching in Australia===
After graduating from the Melbourne Education Institute in 1899 Porteus became an apprentice teacher and taught at small country schools in Gippsland. In 1913 he became the initial head teacher at Victoria&#x27;s first Education Department sponsored school for feeble-minded children. Having the task of selecting students for his small school, Porteus devised a new intelligence test of his own, the Porteus Maze Test, a non-verbal intelligence test. The test was originally used to identify children in need of special education, though it is still in use today for other purposes.

In 1916, Porteus began research on brain size and intelligence at the University of Melbourne, where he also lectured on experimental education.

===Vineland Training School===
In 1919 Porteus was invited to join the Vineland Training School in New Jersey, United States, moving there to replace H. H. Goddard as Director of Research. This invitation came at a good time, as his full-time employment as a head teacher with the Victorian Education Department was souring and although he had no university degree, the new job launched him into a lifelong academic career. He remained at the Vineland school until 1922 and published additional work on brain size and intelligence, the success of his maze test, and the supposed connectedness of intelligence and deviant social behavior.

===University of Hawaiʻi===
In 1922 he moved to Hawaii where he founded the Psychological and Psychopathic Clinic at the University of Hawaiʻi, eventually becoming professor of clinical psychology and its director and Dean of the Psychology Department in 1925. He remained Directory of the Psychological and Psychopathic Clinic until 1948.

The author of many papers and books, Porteus also created a racial hierarchy of intelligence using his maze device which he believed was &quot;a valid, culture-free measure of general intelligence--despite the fact that among his South African samples one group that already knew a &#x27;labyrinth game&#x27; outscored all neighboring groups that did not know the game&quot;. His theories about the superior intelligence of white races has led to recent controversy, including protests by students at the University of Hawaiʻi. Porteus was an early contributor to &quot;Mankind Quarterly&quot;, helped William Shockley organize the Foundation for Education on Eugenics and Dysgenics, and served on the executive committee of the International Association for the Advancement of Ethnology and Eugenics.

He died in 1972 at Honolulu. His ashes are scattered at sea.

==Porteus Hall==
The University of Hawaiʻi social sciences building, Porteus Hall, was named after him in 1974. Less than two months later, however, a group of university students and faculty called the Coalition to Rename Porteus Hall mounted a full-scale campaign in opposition to the name. Both the original decision to name the building after him and the opposition to the name centered on his 1926 book &quot;Temperament and Race&quot; which the university called, &quot;a classic in its field&quot; but which the Coalition denounced as &quot;a flagrantly racist attack on all non-white peoples&quot; and &quot;particularly insulting to the indigenous and non-white immigrant groups who, then as now, make up the overwhelming majority of the population of Hawaiʻi.&quot; The university affirmed the name in 1975, but throughout the next two decades it was common for students to refer to the building as &quot;Racism Hall&quot;. In 1997 the Associated Students voted unanimously to urge that the building be renamed. In response the President of the university appointed a committee to make recommendations regarding renaming the building. It was renamed Saunders Hall in 2001.

==History==
&quot;Bear&quot; in the Mug

Brewing in Cluj began in the Monastery Estate – granted by Stephen Báthory in 1581 to the Jesuits of Cluj, later owned by the Transylvanian Roman Catholic Status, and eventually managed by the Transylvanian Catholic Study Fund in 1868. The exact starting date is lost to history, but what is certain is that by the early 1800s, there was already a brewery, a house where beer was brewed. There were even establishments connected to it that sold the fine drink—essentially a pub network. The brewery was operated by tenants. In 1828, one such lease likely expired, as the Transylvanian Gazette announced: “The Monastery Estate’s brewery, with all the necessary good tools and buildings, located on the corner of the square of the Honorable Free Royal City of Cluj, and with the right to free beer sales in the five villages of the Estate, will be leased to the highest bidder on December 20th.” In today’s terms: the lease rights of the brewery and the beer outlets in Cluj and five other villages were auctioned off.

In 1868, the new manager of the estate, the Catholic Study Fund, leased the Monastery Brewery to the highest bidder, who turned out to be Elek Sigmond, a miller and distiller, and Domokos Biasini, owner of hotels, restaurants, and the former Transylvanian express carriage service. The new entrepreneurs promised to build a modern beer hall and improve transportation from the city center with omnibus services. In 1873, Elek Sigmond’s son, Dezső—later president of the Cluj Chamber of Commerce and Industry—took over the management of the breweries, including the Monastery Brewery. In 1876, the Cluj Court registered the company Sigmond Brothers, which carried on the business empire, with Dezső and his brother Ákos as owners. According to the chamber’s records, their brewery in Monastery produced 2,268, 2,058, 1,890, 1,806, 1,680, 3,696, and 4,158 hectoliters annually between 1881 and 1888.

The 1894 Cluj guide published by the Transylvanian Carpathian Association mentioned the Sigmond Brewery among the city’s notable spots, frequently visited by locals.

For unknown reasons, the Sigmond brothers sold their Cluj distillery and brewery at the turn of the century. The buyer was the company Czell Frigyes and Sons.

The Czell family members were notable citizens of one of Brașov’s suburbs. The elder Frigyes Czell moved to the city center and began working in wool weaving. His son, Frigyes, born in 1816, continued his father’s trade, learning the techniques of finer wool weaving in Vienna and Brno. Returning home, he established a workshop and later a factory, amassing significant wealth. During the 1850s, during a crisis in the domestic spinning and weaving industry, he decided to switch to distillation. In 1854, he established a distillery in Keresztényfalva (Brașov County), which by the 1880s had become one of the largest such companies in Hungary. In 1892, he purchased the bankrupt distillery in Dirste (a former independent village, now part of Brașov) and converted it into a brewery. Production began in 1894, as the Brașov Chamber of Commerce registered their trademark that year. On May 23, 1899, the court registered Czell Frigyes and Sons’ brewery branch, marking the beginning of modern industrial beer production in Cluj.

The local newspaper Magyar Polgár published an advertisement from Czell Frigyes and Sons on April 27, 1901, announcing the reopening of their beer hall at the Monastery Brewery. Two days later, the paper reported that &quot;the Monastery Brewery changed hands, with the distillery and brewery going to the reputable Czell Frigyes and Sons company. The new owner has completely renovated the beer hall, which now meets the standards of the era. It has become one of the most pleasant places for excursions.&quot;

The beer industry flourished for almost two decades but was overshadowed by World War I and the subsequent change of regime. On December 19, 1918, Károlyi Mihály&#x27;s government decided to surrender Cluj without a fight. On Christmas Eve morning, Romanian occupiers arrived, and Cluj, along with Transylvania, became part of the Romanian Kingdom. Nevertheless, brewing and beer drinking continued. The company advertised their beers, which were still of pre-war quality. They resumed brewing their Apát beer, developed to replace missing German brands during the war. This double-malt specialty was said to be as nutritious as the best Munich beers it was designed to replace.

During this time, the city’s intellectual and administrative elite was replaced, with many Hungarians displaced by Romanian authorities. Between 1918 and 1924, nearly 190,000 officials, teachers, and clerks fled to Hungary, becoming the so-called “wagon dwellers.” Romanian workers and consumers soon dominated the local market. The Czell Frigyes and Sons company responded by rebranding their products. In 1923, they renamed their double-malt dark beer Hercules and their light beer Monastery. By June 1924, they introduced a new name for their light beer—Ursus—which remains today, though with some interruptions. The new bear logo, featuring a bear holding two beer bottles, was also registered, though later modified to avoid reminding drinkers of the Hungarian past.

With the new brand came a new beer hall. In 1926, an elegant restaurant and beer hall named the Ursus Beer Hall opened on the site of the old Czell beer hall in the main square.
&quot;Even the old establishment was known and loved by everyone: locals and visitors alike, and it was almost proverbial that the best beer could be found here, one that was as good as milk... – informed the public in a paid advertisement in the city’s theater magazine. – The old Czell already had a very good clientele, but the renovated, beautifully furnished new restaurant is expected to attract even more guests. The premises continue to be owned by the Cluj Czell brewery, and the Czell family strives to ensure that both the kitchen and the drinks, as well as the service, remain impeccable.”

With the appearance of the new name, the Czell Frigyes and Sons empire split into two: Czell Károly of Brașov, and the company group of Dr. Czell Vilmos, which owned the Cluj brewery. The latter encountered financial difficulties in 1926 due to high interest rates that it could not manage. As a result, three financial institutions from Brașov took over the Kolozsmonostor brewery in exchange for loans previously extended. The company had to take loans because its factories were destroyed during the war and had to be rebuilt. Additionally, under the Romanian land reform, their estates were confiscated, ending their raw material production. Furthermore, beer consumption in the country had fallen by fifty percent due to financial difficulties compared to the previous period. The restructuring efforts were unsuccessful, and the company requested a six-month payment moratorium from the court. In 1927, the Cluj brewery was re-established under the name Ursus Brewery Joint Stock Company with new capital injection. However, this did not solve the problem even temporarily. The main shareholder, the Brașov General Savings Bank, which also provided overdraft loans, did not want to further increase its losses and decided to sell. The buyer was the Turda Brewery, owned equally by Farkas Imre of Bisztra (whose nephew, Farkas Ferenc, later became a minister in the government of Imre Nagy) and Simon Lázár. They hoped to eliminate competition and reduce costs through rationalizing production. The deal was called a merger, and the new company was named Ursus United Cluj and Turda Breweries Inc.

The economic crisis continued to worsen, and people were slowly giving up even on eating, let alone drinking beer. In May 1930, 75% less beer was consumed in Transylvania than in the same period the previous year. Manufacturers tried to encourage the remaining citizens with incomes to drink beer through price cuts, production restrictions, and promotional campaigns. As a result, in March 1931, the Ursus Brewery organized a spectacular parade through the streets of Cluj. The beer king sat on top of the first truck, dressed in a purple cloak with a crown on his head, while the second and third vehicles had signs in Hungarian, German, and Romanian informing the public that beer had become cheaper. On the platform of the middle truck, a tavern was set up, where girls and boys in festive attire sat around tables with beer pitchers, while a gypsy band played in the corner, naturally.

Even grander ideas were conceived to overcome the crisis. The Transylvanian and Banat Brewers&#x27; Association—also referred to as the beer cartel in the press—developed market-regulating measures for its members. They lowered prices and introduced production quotas. Any violators faced penalties, which were secured by depositing promissory notes. We won’t delve into how one capital group outwitted the others here, but what matters is that the owners&#x27; meeting dissolved the association. The crisis worsened, and production continued to decline.

The return of Northern Transylvania and Székely Land, the introduction of Hungarian administration, the government’s economic development measures, new market opportunities, and, not least, the wartime boom reversed the trend. Beer consumption also slowly began to increase. Hungarian breweries had already agreed in December 1940 that the Cluj factory could also supply Budapest. According to the Transylvanian volume of the Christian Hungarian Public Almanac, published in 1941, Ursus United Cluj and Turda Breweries Inc. produced 32,000 hectoliters that year, which was half of its capacity. Their dark beer was marketed under the Gloria brand, while their light beer was sold as Ursus. After some personnel changes, the board members became Imre Farkas of Bisztra, Dr. András Somodi, József Sacelláry, Bálint Török, Dr. János Popescu, and Gábor Farkas.

On August 23, Romania switched sides and attacked its former allies. To avoid destruction, the wartime leadership decided to evacuate Székely Land and later Cluj without a fight. The first Soviet units arrived in the treasure city at dawn on October 11, followed by nearly six months of military administration, after which Romania reoccupied the area.

The brewery was nationalized in 1948 and later developed into a large socialist enterprise. By 1974, its production had reached 424,000 hectoliters annually. The Ceaușescu regime also brought its &quot;golden age&quot; here. Anyone who tasted Cluj beer in the 1980s may still remember what it was like…&quot;

In 1996, the South African Breweries purchased Vulturul Buzau. A year later, South African Breweries acquired Pitber Pitesti and Ursus S.A. Cluj-Napoca. In 2001, Ursus S.A. bought the majority stake of Timisoreana Beer S.A. In 2002, Ursus S.A. and Timisoreana SA merged into a single integrated company, named Romania Beer Company S.A. In 2004, SABMiller plc (formerly named South African Breweries) acquired the majority stake of Aurora Brasov, a company that merged in the same year with Romania Beer Company S.A. A year later, in 2005, the new name of SABMiller&#x27;s operations in Romania became Ursus Breweries.

In 2014, Igor Tikhonov was appointed CEO of Ursus Breweries.

On the 31st of March, 2017 Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. had completed the purchase of Ursus Breweries in a transaction that included the former SABMiller Central and Eastern European businesses and brands. Its CEO stated that the acquisition would not change Ursus Breweries&#x27; line of business.

*Cluj–Napoca Craft Mini-Brewery: The modern history of the Cluj-Napoca brewery, which has a bear as its emblem, started in 1878. On 7 July 2011, the old brewery was replaced by a craft Mini-Brewery. The brewery is open to the public. The craft Mini-Brewery is actually named &quot;Fabrica de Bere Ursus&quot;.
*Timișoara Brewery: Established in 1718 at the initiative of the Austrian authorities ruled by Prince Eugene of Savoy. The brewery provided beer in a town that did not have drinkable water. The Timișoara brewery introduced the beer filter in 1920 in Romania, and aluminum kegs (instead of wooden kegs) in 1968.
*Brașov Brewery: In 1892, Friedrich Czell &amp; Sons Corporation acquired the Darste distilling plant and built a new brewery. In 1922, Alexandru Petit wrote in the Brasov&#x27;s Monograph about the increased manpower of 130 employees and a rise in the annual beer and malt productivity to 40.000 hl and 80-90 wagons respectively. Following the nationalization in 1948, the Darste brewery and alcohol plant changed its name into &quot;Aurora&quot;. In 1995, S.C. Aurora S.A. became a private company with 100% Romanian private capital. 
*Buzău Brewery: The brewery in Buzau became operational in 1978 and had a production capacity of 500,000 hl/year. In 1991 the company became a joint-stock company and changed its name to S.C. &quot;Vulturul S.A.&quot; Buzau and in 1996 the brewery was purchased by the South African Breweries. Ursus Breweries started two investment projects in 2005 with a total value of EUR 50 million for the expansion and development of the brewery. The investment project was completed in 2009, the last investment stage being of EUR 42 million.

<text>The Embedded Configurable Operating System (eCos) is a free and open-source real-time operating system intended for embedded systems and applications which need only one process with multiple threads. It is designed to be customizable to precise application requirements of run-time performance and hardware needs. It is implemented in the programming languages C and C++ and has compatibility layers and application programming interfaces for Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) and The Real-time Operating system Nucleus (TRON) variant μITRON. eCos is supported by popular SSL/TLS libraries such as wolfSSL, thus meeting all standards for embedded security. 

== Design ==
eCos was designed for devices with memory sizes in the range of a few tens or several hundred kilobytes, or for applications with real-time requirements.

eCos runs on a wide variety of hardware platforms, including ARM, CalmRISC, FR-V, Hitachi H8, IA-32, Motorola 68000, Matsushita AM3x, MIPS, NEC V850, Nios II, PowerPC, SPARC, and SuperH.

The eCos distribution includes RedBoot, an open source application that uses the eCos hardware abstraction layer to provide bootstrap firmware for embedded systems.

==History==
eCos was initially developed in 1997 by Cygnus Solutions which was later bought by Red Hat. In early 2002, Red Hat ceased development of eCos and laid off the staff of the project. Many of the laid-off staff continued to work on eCos and some formed their own companies providing services for the software. In January 2004, at the request of the eCos developers, Red Hat agreed to transfer the eCos copyrights to the Free Software Foundation in October 2005, a process finally completed in May 2008.

==Non-free versions==
The eCosPro real-time operating system is a commercial fork of eCos created by eCosCentric which incorporates proprietary software components. It is claimed as a &quot;stable, fully tested, certified and supported version&quot;, with additional features that are not released as free software. On Pi Day 2017, eCosCentric announced they had ported eCosPro to all of the Raspberry Pi models, with demonstrations at the Embedded World trade fair in Nuremberg (Germany) and releases free for non-commercial uses to follow.

<text>Food First, also known as the Institute for Food and Development Policy, is a nonprofit organization based in Oakland, California, US. Founded in 1975 by Frances Moore Lappé and Joseph Collins, it describes itself as a &quot;people&#x27;s think tank and education-for-action center&quot;.

Its mission is &quot;to eliminate the injustices that cause hunger&quot;. According to the Food First website, its main goal is to forge food sovereignty for human rights and sustainable livelihoods, and to do so it has three programs of development: building local agri-foods systems, farmers forming food sovereignty, and democratizing development. The organization is meant to offer policy analysis on poverty, agriculture, and development, and is highly critical of the policies implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The organization focuses on the Green Revolution which was supported in the 1970s and which did not produce the development people hoped for. Instead it put in place a system that has high input-costs, but does not produce a yield much higher than traditional farming methods. There has been a recent resurgence of Green Revolution ideas, especially with the large-scale support of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and high-yield-variety agriculture. Food First claims that these policies will only further global inequalities, and has produced several policy briefs stating that the way to establish fair and effective development is through local sustainable agriculture.

In 1987, the organization received the Right Livelihood Award &quot;for revealing the political and economic causes of world hunger and how citizens can help to remedy them.&quot;

==History and organizational structure==
The organization began in 1975 as the Institute for Food and Development Policy (IFDP). The institute was founded by Frances Moore Lappé and Joseph Collins, and actually began in New York in Lappe&#x27;s basement before relocating to San Francisco, and then later to Oakland where it is still located. In 1977 the IFDP published its first work, &quot;Food First: Beyond the Myth of Scarcity&quot;, and has since continued publishing policy briefs and analysis on the world food system and the inequalities that are caused by it. Today&#x27;s Food First is managed by a board of trustees that has five members with backgrounds in different non-profit organizations. They have a shared vision of creating a more grass-roots based system of economic development through the endorsement of local and sustainable agriculture systems. The organization&#x27;s president is Joyce E. King, whose work in sociology has focused on &quot;women&#x27;s participation in grass roots social change movements in Africa, South America and France&quot;. In addition to the Board of Trustees, Food First has six staff members who work on the organization&#x27;s policy briefs. The staff&#x27;s executive director is Eric Holt-Gimenez, who has published several books on global inequalities and the global food system, including &quot;Food Rebellions! Crisis and the Hunger for Justice&quot;, which outlines seven steps to solving the world food crisis. Finally, the organization benefits from the support of the general public through interns and volunteers who contribute to the process of policy research. Food First is a think-tank composed of many individuals from many different backgrounds, who share the organization&#x27;s aim of eliminating global inequalities through the rethinking of the world&#x27;s emphasis on industry-based economics, and shifting the paradigm towards a more inclusive form of economic development.

==Programs and guiding philosophy==
The organization has three programs that it implements in order to achieve this aim:
# Tackling class and racial inequalities in the agri-foods industry. There is a form of structural racism in the United States, as one study found &quot;there were 30% fewer supermarkets in low-income areas than in higher-income areas, and these low-income areas had 55% less grocery store square footage than their wealthier income counterparts. The study also found that the levels of unmet food demand in these communities were as high as 70%&quot;. Without an accessible availability of cheap, healthy foods, low-income communities show high levels of diabetes and heart problems. Food First attempts to counter this structural racism by providing information and analysis, helping spread awareness and debate, and by helping create a national coalition of urban communities of color for food security. By studying international economic development and U.S. inequalities and development, Food First is taking a holistic approach that aims to change the way that we view the relationship between access to food and economic development.
# Helping farmers form food sovereignty by creating projects such as The Campesino in Mexico and Central America, and by working with Via Campesina. These groups focus on farmer alternatives to the corporate agrifoods industry, helping farmers educate each other on strategies for alternatives. Food First&#x27;s strategy emphasizes the farmer&#x27;s sovereignty and acknowledges their self-determination. They believe a main flaw of the Green Revolution of the past and of the new Green Revolution is that the transnational institutions that implemented it failed to consult the people that would be affected by it the most, small farmers. Placing power and sovereignty in the hands of the disenfranchised is crucial for development. 
# Empowering farmers by giving them a voice. This program focuses on the structural causes of hunger and poverty, supporting advocacy groups that are against the agrifoods industry and are in support of consumer-led alternatives that allow for &quot;justice, equity and ecological sustainability&quot;. Food First helps through projects such as No Full Tanks with Empty Bellies: The Food and Fuel Sovereignty Campaign. This project aims to inform the public about the negative impacts caused by bio-fuels. The spread of advocacy is Food First&#x27;s key role, providing information that is essential for awareness, debate, and change. Lack of food sovereignty, poverty, and hunger, are all interrelated structural problems that take a collective effort to change; Food First aims to bring this collective together to spark this change.

Food First believes that world hunger is not an inevitable phenomenon that occurs simply because there is not enough food produced worldwide. Instead, it argues that there is an enormous surplus of food produced by corporate agri-businesses based in wealthy developed nations, and this enormous surplus of food is a reflection on broader global inequalities that deeply impact and harm marginalized third-world countries worldwide. While challenging the idea that world hunger exists because there is simply not enough food produced or available, Holz-Gimenez and Patel explain that, &quot;...according to the FAO, with record grain harvests in 2007, there was more than enough food in the world to feed everyone—at least 1.5 times current demand&quot;. Food First argues that world hunger is not caused by food production shortages, and in fact points the blame to systemic causes such as speculation on the market, investments in large-scale GMO farms that have higher input-costs, and the bio-fuels market. By illustrating these ideas, Food First tries to bring to the table a new approach to global hunger that they believe has been largely ignored.

Food First supports a &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach to solving world hunger, asserting the ability of all countries to feed their own people if they focus on agriculture for subsistence rather than for export.

Food First strongly opposes the policies of what they deem to be free market institutions such as the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund. , it is active in the campaign against the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas.

<doc id="432236" wikidata="Q2293972" url="?curid=432236" title="Pee-wee's Big Adventure">
<text>Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure is a 1985 American adventure comedy film directed by Tim Burton in his feature-film directing debut. The film stars Paul Reubens as Pee-wee Herman, along with E.G. Daily, Mark Holton, Diane Salinger and Judd Omen. The screenplay, written by Reubens with Phil Hartman and Michael Varhol, tells the story of Pee-wee&#x27;s search for his stolen bicycle and has been compared to the 1948 Italian film &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot;.

Following the success of &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot; in 1981, Reubens was hired by the Warner Bros. film studio and began writing the script for &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;. Impressed with Burton&#x27;s work on the short films &quot;Vincent&quot; (1982) and &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; (1984), the producers and Reubens hired him to direct. Filming took place in California and Texas. The film was scored by Danny Elfman, marking his first among many collaborations with Burton.

&quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; was released on August 9, 1985, grossing over $40 million in North America. It became a cult film and continued to accumulate positive feedback. It was nominated for a Young Artist Award and was followed by two standalone sequels, &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot; (1988) and &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Holiday&quot; (2016). Its financial success, followed by Burton&#x27;s equally successful &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; in 1988, prompted Warner Bros. to hire Burton to direct the 1989 film &quot;Batman&quot;.

==Plot==

Pee-wee Herman, a childlike man in a grey suit with a red bow-tie, has a dream where he wins the Tour De France. He wakes up and makes breakfast with an elaborate Rube Goldberg machine, but has Mr. T cereal instead. Pee-Wee goes outside and enters a secret code to access a garage containing his heavily accessorized bicycle that he cherishes. His neighbor and enemy, Francis Buxton, wants the bicycle and offers to buy it. Pee-wee refuses; as he rides off, Francis warns him he&#x27;ll be sorry for turning down his offer. 

Pee-Wee goes to Chuck&#x27;s Bike Shop. Dottie is an employee who has a crush on Pee-wee, but he does not reciprocate, claiming that he leads far too dangerous and incomprehensible of a lifestyle for her. As Pee-wee goes on a shopping spree, his bike is stolen, but the police are not overly concerned with the theft. Pee-wee assumes Francis took it, and confronts him, but Francis&#x27; father convinces Pee-wee that Francis was not responsible. Pee-wee offers a $10,000 reward for the bike. Francis, who did indeed pay to have someone steal the bike, is disturbed by Pee-wee&#x27;s relentlessness and pays to have the bike sent away. That evening, Pee-wee holds an unsuccessful evidentiary meeting of friends and neighbors to find the bike, then rejects offers of help. He then visits a phony psychic who misleads Pee-wee into believing his bike is in the basement of the Alamo Mission in San Antonio and steals his wallet.

Pee-wee hitchhikes to Texas, getting rides from a fugitive convict named Mickey, and from Large Marge, the ghost of a truck driver. At a truck stop, Pee-wee finds his wallet is missing, and pays for his meal by washing dishes. He befriends Simone, a waitress who dreams of visiting Paris. As they watch the sun rise from within a roadside dinosaur statue, he encourages her to follow her dreams, but Simone tells him about her boyfriend, Andy, who disapproves. Andy appears and tries to attack Pee-wee, who escapes onto a moving train. Pee-wee arrives at the Alamo, but learns at the end of a guided tour that the building does not have a basement.

At a bus station, Pee-wee encounters Simone, who tells him she broke up with Andy and is on her way to Paris. She tells Pee-wee not to give up searching for his bike. Pee-wee calls Dottie and apologizes for his behavior. Andy spots Pee-wee and resumes chasing him. Pee-wee evades Andy at a rodeo by disguising himself as a bull rider. Forced to ride a bull, Pee-wee nearly sets a world record, but is knocked out. He visits a biker bar to make a phone call, and a biker gang threatens to kill him after he accidentally knocks over their motorcycles. He wins them over by dancing to the song &quot;Tequila&quot; in a pair of platform shoes, and they give him a motorcycle for his journey, which he crashes immediately.

He awakens in a hospital and sees on television that his bike is being used as a prop in a film. Pee-wee sneaks into Warner Bros. Studios with Milton Berle in Burbank and grabs the bike. Security guards chase him across the studio lot and through several active sets before he escapes. Pee-wee then discovers a burning pet shop and rescues the animals. The firefighters declare Pee-wee a hero, but the police arrest Pee-wee for his intrusion at the studio. They return Pee-wee to the studio to face Warner Bros. president Terry Hawthorne. After Pee-wee pleads his case that the bike belongs to him, Hawthorne decides to drop the charges and return Pee-wee&#x27;s bike in exchange for the rights to adapt his story into a film starring James Brolin as &quot;P.W. Herman&quot; and Morgan Fairchild as Dottie. In the film, presented as a James Bond parody, the characters must retrieve their stolen motorbike – which contains an important microfilm – from the Soviets, after the US President telephones P.W. to let him know of the bike&#x27;s importance to national security. Pee-wee has a cameo role as a hotel bellhop, though his voice has been dubbed.

Seeing the film at a drive-in theater, Pee-wee gives refreshments to the different people he met along his journey. He also encounters Francis, who tells reporters he is Pee-wee&#x27;s best friend and that he taught Pee-wee how to ride. Francis claims to be knowledgeable about Pee-wee&#x27;s bike, but sets off one of the bicycle&#x27;s gadgets, catapulting himself into the air. Ultimately, Pee-wee decides to depart with Dottie, claiming to have already &quot;lived&quot; the adventure on screen.

==Production==

The success of &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot; prompted Warner Bros. to hire Paul Reubens to write a script for a full-length Pee-wee Herman film. His original concept was a remake of &quot;Pollyanna&quot; (1960), Reubens&#x27;s favorite film, with Pee-wee Herman in the Hayley Mills role. While writing the script, Reubens noticed that many at Warner Bros. rode bicycles around the backlot and requested one of his own. This inspired Reubens to start a new script.

Having left Walt Disney Productions and with &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; (1984) receiving positive reviews within film studios, Tim Burton was seeking a full-length film to direct. When Reubens and the producers of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; saw Burton&#x27;s work on &quot;Vincent&quot; (1982) and &quot;Frankenweenie&quot;, they decided to hire him. Burton felt that he connected with Reubens&#x27;s personality and the humor of the &quot;Pee-wee Herman Show&quot;. After hiring Burton, Reubens, Phil Hartman and Michael Varhol revised the script. They read Syd Field&#x27;s 1979 book &quot;Screenplay&quot; and wrote the script according to the book&#x27;s advice. &quot;It&#x27;s a 90-minute film, it&#x27;s a 90-page script,&quot; Reubens explained. &quot;On page 30 I lose my bike, on page 60 I find it. It&#x27;s literally exactly what they said to do in the book...There should be like a MacGuffin kind of a thing, something you&#x27;re looking for, and I was like, &#x27;Okay, my bike.&#x27;&quot; The film has been described as a &quot;parody&quot; or &quot;farce version&quot; of the 1948 Italian classic &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot;.

Filming locations included Glendale, Pomona, Santa Clarita, Santa Monica, Burbank, Cabazon (at the Cabazon Dinosaurs) and Port Hueneme in California, as well as San Antonio, Texas. Burton and Reubens clashed with Warner Bros. studio executives over the shooting schedule. Burton hired CalArts classmate Rick Heinrichs for scenes involving stop-motion animation. Large Marge&#x27;s claymation transformation was created by the Chiodo Brothers.

==Casting==
The film features several of Reubens&#x27; fellow cast members from the improvisational comedy troupe the Groundlings who had previously appeared in &quot;The Pee-wee Herman Show&quot;, namely Hartman, Lynne Marie Stewart, John Paragon and John Moody. Hartman, Stewart and Paragon would also later appear on Reubens&#x27; TV series &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;. Jan Hooks was also a fellow Groundling, and both she and Hartman would go on to become cast members of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1986.

Diane Salinger would also appear in the standalone sequel &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Holiday&quot; (2016).

==Soundtrack==
Reubens initially approached Devo frontman Mark Mothersbaugh to score the film, but Mothersbaugh was unavailable, due to a scheduling conflict. However, he would later compose the theme song and other episodic music for Reubens&#x27; television series &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;.

Burton then recruited Danny Elfman, the lead singer/songwriter of Oingo Boingo (who had also composed the music for 1982&#x27;s &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot;), to score &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;. Elfman was hesitant at first, given his lack of scoring experience, but had written the main title theme by the time that he signed on.

Elfman&#x27;s original score draws inspiration from film composers Nino Rota and Bernard Herrmann. The main title music pays homage to Rota&#x27;s &quot;Carlotta&#x27;s Galop&quot; from Fellini&#x27;s &quot;8½&quot; (1963) and the tracks &quot;Stolen Bike&quot; and &quot;Clown Dream&quot; pay homage to Herrmann&#x27;s scores for &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) and &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1958), respectively. &quot;Studio Chase&quot; pays homage to Miss Gulch&#x27;s theme from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939).

In 1988, record label Varèse Sarabande released an album featuring cues from &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; and those from another Elfman-scored film, &quot;Back to School&quot; (1986). While the scores for both films were recorded in Hollywood, the album was recorded in London and performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by John Coleman.

Elfman went on to score nearly all of Burton&#x27;s films, excluding &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (1994), &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; (2007) and &quot;Miss Peregrine&#x27;s Home for Peculiar Children&quot; (2016).

In 2010, both the original score sessions and re-recordings were released by Warner Bros. Records as part of &quot;The Danny Elfman &amp; Tim Burton 25th Anniversary Music Box&quot;. The album also included additional cues, alternate versions and a restored &quot;Studio Chase&quot; sequence.

The film also features &quot;Burn in Hell&quot; by Twisted Sister and &quot;Tequila&quot; by the Champs.

==Release==
&quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; opened on August 9, 1985, in the United States in 829 theaters, accumulating $4,545,847 over its opening weekend, and went on to gross $40,940,662 domestically. The film was followed by two standalone sequels: &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot; (1988) and &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Holiday&quot; (2016).

==Reception==
&quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; received generally positive reviews on its release before eventually becoming a cult film. Review aggregator website &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; reports that 89% of 53 critics gave it a positive review, with an average rating of 7.8/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Pee-Wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; brings Paul Reubens&#x27; famous character to the big screen intact, along with enough inspired silliness to dazzle children of all ages.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 47 out of 100 based on 14 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

In a review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Michael Wilmington wrote, &quot;The wrong crowd will find these antics infantile and offensive. The right one will have a howling good time.&quot; David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; described the film as &quot;Mattel Surrealism, a toy-store fantasia in primary colors and &#x27;50s decor. Whoever proposed teaming up Pee-wee (a.k.a. Paul Reubens) with 26-year-old director Tim Burton knew what they were doing ... Together they&#x27;ve conspired to make a true original—a live-action cartoon brash enough to appeal to little kids and yet so knee-deep in irony that its faux naivete looks as chic as the latest retrofashions.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; compared Paul Reubens to Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; did not review &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; upon its original release. However, in 1987, the film topped his &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot; list, with Ebert saying he was impressed by &quot;how innocent, how playful and how truly eccentric&quot; the film was, and how the film created &quot;a whole fairy-tale universe&quot; comparable to &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; or &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. Ebert also mentioned &quot;Big Adventure&quot; in his review of &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot; (1988), explaining how moving away from the &quot;zany weirdness&quot; of the first Pee-wee Herman film led to a sequel that was &quot;not as magical&quot;.

A more negative assessment came from Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, who gave &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; a rare zero-star rating in his print review, writing that he had enjoyed Herman&#x27;s guest spots on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; but &quot;[o]bviously, Pee-Wee is tolerable only in Pee-Wee doses ... You have to be a lot funnier on the big screen than on the tube to sustain a feature-length story.&quot; Siskel included the film in his unranked year-end list of the worst movies of 1985. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was also negative, writing that, apart from a few scenes, it was &quot;the most barren comedy I&#x27;ve seen in years, maybe ever.&quot;

Burton was offered the opportunity to direct the sequel, &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot;, but was not interested and was already working on his own pet project, &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988). Positive reviews for &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and the financial success of &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; prompted Warner Bros. to hire Burton to direct &quot;Batman&quot;.

Reviewing the film for its 2000 DVD release, Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Salon.com&quot; explained, &quot;Everything about &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, from its toy-box colors to its superb, hyper-animated Danny Elfman score to the butch-waxed hairdo and wooden-puppet walk of its star and mastermind is pure pleasure.&quot; In a retrospective review in 2005, Christopher Null gave positive feedback, calling it &quot;Burton&#x27;s strangest film&quot;. &quot;Empire&quot; called the film &quot;a one-off comic masterpiece&quot; and &quot;a dazzling debut&quot; for Burton.

The film was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Family Motion Picture (Comedy or Musical).

==Home video==
Warner Home Video released &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot; on DVD in May 2000, with audio commentary by Burton, Reubens and Elfman (the latter on a separate track, alongside an isolated score) and some deleted scenes. The film was released on Blu-ray disc in 2011.

<text>Grant Hill (born September 20, 1943) is a former Canadian Member of Parliament for the Conservative Party of Canada (2004), and a former member of the Canadian Alliance (2000–2004) and the Reform Party of Canada (1993–2000).

==Life and career==
From January to March 2004, Hill served as interim leader of the Official Opposition in the House of Commons. However, he was not the party&#x27;s official interim leader—that role went to Senator John Lynch-Staunton.

Hill was first elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) for the Reform Party of Canada in the 1993 general election. He attracted controversy when he claimed, as a medical doctor, that homosexuality was an unhealthy lifestyle. He was criticized by many other doctors, including fellow Reform (and later Liberal) MP Dr. Keith Martin.

He joined the Canadian Alliance when the Reform Party&#x27;s successor was formed in 2000. In 2002, he was a candidate in the Canadian Alliance leadership election, placing fourth.

Hill has resumed his medical practice in Okotoks, Alberta. He is also well known for his collection of antique cars and his work in promoting car shows. He is married with a large family, and is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Hill did not run in the 2004 election.

==Honours==
On February 19, 2004 he was sworn in as a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada, giving him the right to use the prenominal title &quot;The Honourable&quot; and the post-nominal letters &quot;PC&quot; for life.

<doc id="432246" wikidata="Q8034745" url="?curid=432246" title="Workers' Socialist League">
<text>The Workers Socialist League (WSL) was a Trotskyist group in Britain. The group was formed by Alan Thornett and other members of the Workers Revolutionary Party (WRP) after their expulsion from that group in 1974.

== Origins ==

Thornett and his comrades had questioned what they saw as a sectarian turn of the WRP. They argued that this turn would isolate the WRP and that it was necessary to turn back to Trotsky&#x27;s &quot;Transitional Programme&quot;. They wrote a number of documents to argue their case and as a result were expelled. A minor controversy surrounded these documents when some WRP members alleged that Thornett was not their author, but that in fact they were written by members of the Bulletin Group, who were supporters of Pierre Lambert and therefore strongly opposed by the WRP.

The WSL was founded in 1975 with a leadership grouped around Thornett, Tony Richardson and John Lister. Terry Eagleton was a well-known member. Unlike the WRP, whose politics it inherited, it covered Irish politics, women&#x27;s struggles and broke with the homophobia characteristic of Gerry Healy. The group also concluded that Cuba had been a deformed workers state since the revolution of 1959. It published the weekly paper &quot;Socialist Press&quot; and a number of issues of a theoretical journal &quot;Trotskyism Today&quot;.

In its first few years the WSL attempted to capitalise on its existing base in industry and expand outwards from its base in Oxford. Despite having more realistic perspectives than the WRP, it was never able to group more than 150 members. Many people who left the WRP simply left revolutionary politics, and as the level of industrial struggle slackened in the late 1970s the WSL lost members and internal factional struggles began.

The first factional struggles were the result of the development of a small group of supporters of the American Spartacist League. &quot;Spartacist London&quot; had been founded in 1975 by American, Canadian and Australian Spartacists with the intention of engaging other Trotskyist groups in debate. As both they and the WSL have a common past in the International Committee of the Fourth International they paid great attention to the WSL. The result was that they recruited a number of WSL members to their views and these formed the &quot;Leninist Faction&quot; in 1977. The Leninist Faction would split to join the London Spartacists in forming the Spartacist League in 1978. This factional struggle had its sequel in 1979 when another group of WSL members were similarly won to the Spartacists this time calling themselves the &quot;Trotskyist Faction&quot;.

In 1978 the United Secretariat of the Fourth International invited the WSL to submit material to the USec&#x27;s 1979 Eleventh World Congress. It did so in July 1978 with &quot;The Poisoned Well&quot;, a critical analysis of the development of USec which was republished in &quot;Trotskyism Today&quot;.

Meanwhile, 1979 saw the election of a Conservative Government and the beginnings of a major offensive against the trade unions. This also had a reaction in the Labour Party which swung to the left and began to attract the attention of Trotskyist groups including the WSL.

== Failed Fusion ==
By 1980 the WSL was essentially working within the Labour Party which caused a degree of internal differentiation within its membership as to how to relate to the Labour Left around Tony Benn, which they saw as reformist. The presence of another Trotskyist group in the Labour Party, the International-Communist League, also posed problems and the possibility of the two groups merging was raised.

Those members of the WSL most opposed to any fusion of the group with the I-CL tended to be those involved with the group&#x27;s &quot;open&quot; work around unemployment which was then a massive question in Britain. The WSL launched a short-lived National Unemployed Workers Movement at this time which despite its name was actually more concerned with unemployed youth than workers thrown out of the factories. The fusion of the two groups was achieved in July 1981 with the fused group maintaining the name Workers Socialist League, often called the &#x27;new&#x27; WSL, with &quot;Socialist Organiser&quot; as its paper (although theoretically SO was a &quot;broad&quot; paper and not that of the WSL or I-CL before it). The WSL remained affiliated to the Trotskyist International Liaison Committee, a small international tendency of groups led by the WSL. Its other affiliates were to be found in Denmark, Italy, Greece, the US and among Turkish exiles. The only group affiliated which supported the former I-CL was to be found in Australia.

Within the new WSL disputes broke out immediately. Although there were many issues involved in the internal debates the Falklands War was paramount. Traditionally, Trotskyists defend countries oppressed by imperialism in any military conflict, calling this military support which is differentiated from political support. The reaction from some Trotskyists in Britain was to give such support to Argentina when war broke out, ignoring historical claims to the islands or the question of who began the war. The I-CL disagreed with this view and took a dual defeatist position on the war on the grounds that Argentina was not a semi-colony of imperialism, and also called for self determination for the Falkland Islanders. This position caused disputes within the group, mostly with members of the old WSL.

By the summer of 1982 clear but informal factional lines had developed in the WSL. One group was the former I-CL around Sean Matgamna, a second around Alan Clinton and a smaller third group was composed of part of the old WSL. Most of the parties in the TILC supported the third group, which in January 1983 constituted itself as the Internationalist Tendency (IT). The small IT group came to disagree with both the other groups on many important issues, including the Labour Party, Northern Ireland and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The IT had 38 members most from the old WSL but including I-CLers with its main support in Leicester and Nottingham. It was led by Mike Jones and Pete Flack.

In March 1983 the IT declared that it was now a faction, thus becoming the Internationalist Faction (IF), and it adopted a number of documents in which their criticisms of the leadership was stepped up. But there were by now tensions in the IF as some members became sympathetic to Workers Power and left to join that group. Others sympathised with the international tendency around the Workers&#x27; Party (Argentina), the Latin American Tendencia Cuarta Internacional (TCI). The next stage in the developing split was the April 1983 TILC meeting at which the WSL delegates voted to prevent Chilean sympathisers from affiliating to the TILC. The WSL then walked out after a resolution calling on Alan Thornett to fight Sean Matgamna&#x27;s &quot;revisionism&quot;. The IF, who sympathised with the TILC, were then expelled from the WSL, and formed the Workers Internationalist League.

The WSL was a little smaller after the expulsion of the IF and still split between the supporters of Sean Matgamna and Alan Thornett. Thornett&#x27;s supporters stopped paying subscriptions to the group and called several special conferences. Later, in 1984, Matgamna&#x27;s supporters formally expelled Thornett&#x27;s supporters.

== Socialist Group ==

Matgamna&#x27;s supporters continued with the WSL and &quot;Socialist Organiser&quot; but soon dropped the name WSL in favour of Socialist Organiser Alliance, while Thornett&#x27;s depleted followers founded a new smaller group called the Socialist Group, which was to publish a magazine called &quot;Socialist Viewpoint&quot; until it fused with the International Group in 1987, to form the International Socialist Group.

<doc id="432249" wikidata="Q95125" url="?curid=432249" title="James L. Brooks">
<text>James Lawrence Brooks (born May 9, 1940) is an American director, producer, screenwriter and co-founder of Gracie Films. He co-created the sitcoms &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Taxi&quot;, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and directed the films &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; (1983), &quot;Broadcast News&quot; (1987), and &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot; (1997). He received numerous accolades including three Academy Awards, 22 Emmy Awards, and a Golden Globe Award.

Brooks started his career as an usher at CBS, going on to write for the CBS News broadcasts. He moved to Los Angeles in 1965 to work on David L. Wolper&#x27;s documentaries. He wrote for &quot;My Mother the Car&quot; and &quot;My Friend Tony&quot; and created the series &quot;Room 222&quot;. Grant Tinker hired Brooks and producer Allan Burns at MTM Productions to create &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; in 1970. Brooks and Burns then created two successful spin-offs from &quot;Mary Tyler Moore&quot;: &quot;Rhoda&quot; (a comedy) and &quot;Lou Grant&quot; (a drama). Brooks left MTM Productions in 1978 to co-create the sitcom &quot;Taxi&quot; (1978-1983).

Brooks moved into feature film work when he wrote and co-produced the 1979 film &quot;Starting Over&quot;. His next project was the critically acclaimed film &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;, which he produced, directed and wrote, winning an Academy Award for all three roles. He earned acclaim for his films &quot;Broadcast News&quot; (1987) and &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot; (1997). He received mixed reviews for &quot;I&#x27;ll Do Anything&quot; (1994), &quot;Spanglish&quot; (2004), and &quot;How Do You Know&quot; (2010). Brooks also produced Cameron Crowe&#x27;s &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989) and Wes Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; (1996).

In 1986, Brooks founded Gracie Films, a television and film company. Although he did not intend to do so, Brooks returned to television in 1987 as the producer of &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. He hired cartoonist Matt Groening to create a series of shorts for the show, which led in 1989 to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; won numerous awards and is still running after over 35 years. Brooks also co-produced and co-wrote the 2007 film adaptation of the show, &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;. In total, Brooks has received 53 Emmy nominations, winning 21 of them.

== Early life ==
James Lawrence Brooks was born on May 9, 1940, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, and raised in North Bergen, New Jersey. His parents, Dorothy Helen (née Sheinheit) and Edward M. Brooks, were both salespeople (his mother sold children&#x27;s clothes; his father furniture). The Brooks family was Jewish; Edward Brooks changed his surname from &quot;Bernstein&quot; and claimed to be Irish. Brooks&#x27;s father abandoned his mother when he found out she was pregnant with him, and lost contact with his son when Brooks was twelve. During the pregnancy, Brooks&#x27; father sent his wife a postcard stating that &quot;If it&#x27;s a boy, name him Jim.&quot; His mother died when he was 22. He has described his early life as &quot;tough&quot; with a &quot;broken home, [and him being] poor and sort of lonely, that sort of stuff,&quot; later adding: &quot;My father was sort of in-and-out and my mother worked long hours, so there was no choice but for me to be alone in the apartment a lot.&quot; He has an older sister, Diane, who helped look after him as a child and to whom he dedicated &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot;.

Brooks spent much of his childhood &quot;surviving&quot; and reading numerous comedic and scripted works, as well as writing. He sent comedic short stories out to publishers, and occasionally got positive responses, although none were published, and he did not believe he could make a career as a writer. Brooks attended Weehawken High School, but was not a high achiever. He was on his high school newspaper team and frequently secured interviews with celebrities, including Louis Armstrong. He lists some of his influences as Sid Caesar, Jack Benny, Lenny Bruce, Mike Nichols and Elaine May, as well as writers Mark Twain, Paddy Chayefsky and F. Scott Fitzgerald.

== Career ==

=== Television ===

Brooks dropped out of a New York University public relations course, Brooks&#x27; sister got him a job as a host at CBS in New York City, a job usually requiring a college education, as she was friends with a secretary there. He held it for two and a half years. For two weeks he filled in as a copywriter for CBS News and was given the job permanently when the original employee never returned. Brooks went on to become a writer for the news broadcasts, joining the Writers Guild of America and writing reports on events such as the assassination of President Kennedy. He moved to Los Angeles in 1965, to write for documentaries being produced by David L. Wolper, something he &quot;still [hasn&#x27;t] quite figured out how [he] got the guts to do,&quot; as his job at CBS was secure and well-paid. He worked as an associate producer on series such as &quot;Men in Crisis&quot;, but after six months he was laid off as the company was trying to cut back on expenses. Brooks did occasionally work for Wolper&#x27;s company again, including on a &quot;National Geographic&quot; insect special.

Failing to find another job at a news agency, he met producer Allan Burns at a party. Burns got him a job on &quot;My Mother the Car&quot; where he was hired to rewrite a script after pitching some story ideas. Brooks then went on to write episodes of &quot;That Girl&quot;, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; and &quot;My Three Sons&quot; before Sheldon Leonard hired him as a story editor on &quot;My Friend Tony&quot;. In 1969 he created the series &quot;Room 222&quot; for ABC, which lasted until 1974. &quot;Room 222&quot; was the second series in American history to feature a black lead character, in this case high school teacher Pete Dixon played by Lloyd Haynes. The network felt the show was sensitive and so attempted to change the pilot story so that Dixon helped a white student rather than a black one, but Brooks prevented it. On the show Brooks worked with Gene Reynolds who taught him the importance of extensive and diligent research, which he conducted at Los Angeles High School for &quot;Room 222&quot;, and he used the technique on his subsequent works. Brooks left &quot;Room 222&quot; as head writer after one year to work on other pilots and brought Burns in to produce the show. The Television Academy Foundation would point out that &quot;Room 222&quot; &quot;broke new narrative ground that would later be developed by the major sitcom factories of the 1970s, Grant Tinker&#x27;s MTM Enterprises and Norman Lear&#x27;s Tandem Productions&quot; and also noted how the show even preceded Lear&#x27;s 1970s sitcoms when it came to discussing &quot;serious contemporary issues.&quot; 

Brooks and Burns were hired by CBS programming executive Grant Tinker to create a series together with MTM Productions for Tinker&#x27;s wife Mary Tyler Moore which became &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. Drawing on his own background in journalism, Brooks set the show in a newsroom. Initially the show was unpopular with CBS executives who demanded Tinker fire Brooks and Burns. However the show was one of the beneficiaries of network president Fred Silverman&#x27;s &quot;rural purge&quot;; executive Bob Wood also liked the show and moved it into a better timeslot. Brooks and Burns hired all of the show&#x27;s staff themselves and eventually ended it of their own accord. &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; became a critical and commercial success and was the first show to feature an independent-minded, working woman, not reliant on a man, as its lead. Geoff Hammill of the Museum of Broadcast Communications described it as &quot;one of the most acclaimed television programs ever produced&quot; in US television history. During its seven-year period it received high praise from critics and numerous Primetime Emmy Awards, including for three years in a row &quot;Outstanding Comedy Series&quot;. In 2003 &quot;USA Today&quot; called it &quot;one of the best shows ever to air on TV&quot;. In 1997 &quot;TV Guide&quot; selected a &quot;Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; episode as the best TV episode ever and in 1999, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; picked Mary&#x27;s hat toss in the opening credits as television&#x27;s second greatest moment.

With &quot;Mary Tyler Moore&quot; going strong, Brooks produced and wrote the TV film &quot;Thursday&#x27;s Game&quot;, before creating the short-lived series &quot;Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers&quot; in 1974. He and Burns moved on to &quot;Rhoda&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Mary Tyler Moore&quot;, taking Valerie Harper&#x27;s character Rhoda Morgenstern into her own show. It was well received, lasting four years and earning Brooks several Emmys. The duo&#x27;s next project came in 1977 in the shape of &quot;Lou Grant&quot;, a second &quot;Mary Tyler Moore&quot; spin-off, which they created along with Tinker. Unlike its source however, the series was a drama starring Edward Asner as Grant. James Brown of the Museum of Broadcast Communications said it &quot;explore[d] a knotty issue facing media people in contemporary society, focusing on how investigating and reporting those issues impact on the layers of personalities populating a complex newspaper publishing company.&quot; The show was also critically acclaimed, twice winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series and also a Peabody Award.

Brooks left MTM Productions in 1978 and formed the John Charles Walters Company along with David Davis, Stan Daniels and Ed Weinberger. They decided to produce &quot;Taxi&quot;, a show about a New York taxi company, which unlike the other MTM Productions focused on the &quot;blue-collar male experience&quot;. Brooks and Davis had been inspired by the article &quot;Night-Shifting for the Hip Fleet&quot; by Mark Jacobson, which appeared in the September 22, 1975 issue of &quot;New York&quot; magazine. The show began on ABC in 1978 airing on Tuesday nights after &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; which generated high ratings and after two seasons it was moved to Wednesday. Its ratings fell and in 1982 it was canceled; NBC picked it up, but the ratings remained low and it was dropped after one season. Despite its ratings, it won three consecutive Outstanding Comedy Series Emmys. Brooks&#x27; last TV show produced before he began making films was &quot;The Associates&quot; (1979–1980) for ABC. Despite positive critical attention, the show was quickly canceled.

Alex Simon of &quot;Venice Magazine&quot; described Brooks as &quot;[bringing] realism to the previously overstated world of television comedy. Brooks&#x27; fingerprints can now be seen in shows such as &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; and numerous other shows from the 1980s and 1990s.&quot; Brooks&#x27; sitcoms were some of the first with a &quot;focus on character&quot; using an ensemble cast in a non-domestic situation.

=== Film ===
In 1978, Brooks began work on feature films. His first project was the 1979 film &quot;Starting Over&quot; which he wrote and co-produced with Alan J. Pakula. He adapted the screenplay from a novel by Dan Wakefield into a film &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called &quot;a good-humored, heartening update of traditional romantic comedy&quot; unlike the &quot;drab&quot; novel.

Brooks&#x27; next project came in 1983, when he wrote, produced and directed &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;, adapting the screenplay from Larry McMurtry&#x27;s novel of the same name. It cost $8.5 million and took four years to film. Brooks won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay, while the supporting actor he cast, Jack Nicholson, won Best Supporting Actor.

Brooks was fearful of the attention Oscar success would bring as he would be &quot;deprived of a low profile&quot;, finding it &quot;hard to work with the spotlight shining in your eyes.&quot; He added: &quot;There&#x27;s a danger of being seduced into being self-conscious, of being aware of your &#x27;career&#x27;. That can be lethal.&quot; He also grew more concerned of the &quot;threatening&quot; corporate influence into the film industry at the expense of &quot;the idea of the creative spirit&quot;. He channeled this ambivalence into &quot;Broadcast News&quot;. As a romantic comedy, Brooks felt he could say &quot;something new...with that form&quot;, adding, &quot;One of the things you&#x27;re supposed to do every once in a while as a filmmaker is capture time and place. I was just glad there was some way to do it in a comedy.&quot; He cast William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks (no relation) in the three main roles.

He wished to set the film in a field he understood and opted for broadcast journalism. After talking with network journalists at the 1984 Republican National Convention, Brooks realized the field had &quot;changed so much since I had been near it&quot;, and so &quot;did about a year and a half of solid research,&quot; into the industry. When he began writing the screenplay, Brooks felt he &quot;didn&#x27;t like any of the three [main] characters&quot;, but decided not to change them and after two months had reversed his original opinion. Brooks stated that this also happens to the audience: &quot;You&#x27;re always supposed to arc your characters and you have this change and that&#x27;s your dramatic purpose. But what I hope happens in this film is that the audience takes part in the arc. So what happens is that the movie doesn&#x27;t select its own hero. It plays differently with each audience. The audience helps create the experience, depending on which character they hook onto.&quot; He did not decide on the ending of the film until the rest of it had been completed. Brooks was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay for &quot;Broadcast News&quot;. At the 38th Berlin International Film Festival, the film was nominated for the Golden Bear and Holly Hunter won the Silver Bear for Best Actress.

His 1994 film &quot;I&#x27;ll Do Anything&quot;, starring Nick Nolte, was conceived and filmed by Brooks as an old-fashioned movie musical and parody of &quot;Hollywood lifestyles and movie clichés&quot;, costing $40 million. It featured songs by Carole King, Prince, and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, among others, with choreography by Twyla Tharp. When preview audience reactions to the music were overwhelmingly negative, all production numbers from the film were cut and Brooks wrote several new scenes, filming them over three days and spending seven weeks editing the film down to two hours. Brooks said, &quot;Something like this not only tries one&#x27;s soul – it threatens one&#x27;s soul.&quot; While it was not unusual for Brooks to edit his films substantially after preview screenings, on this occasion he was &quot;denied any privacy&quot; because the media reported the negative reviews before its release and &quot;it had to be good enough to counter all this bad publicity.&quot; It was a commercial failure, and Brooks attempted to produce a documentary about it four years later but was scuppered by failing to obtain the rights to Prince&#x27;s song.

Brooks agreed to produce and direct &quot;Old Friends&quot;, a screenplay by Mark Andrus. Brooks said the screenplay &quot;needed you to suspend disbelief&quot; but realized that &quot;my style when directing is that I really don&#x27;t know how to get people to suspend disbelief.&quot; Brooks spent a year reworking the screenplay: &quot;There were changes made and the emphasis was changed but it&#x27;s the product, really, of a very unusual writing team,&quot; and the project became &quot;As Good as It Gets,&quot; taking a year to produce after funding had been secured. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Brooks &quot;was constantly experimenting, constantly reshooting, constantly re-editing&quot; the film, changing its ending five times and allowing the actors to improvise the film&#x27;s tone.

The film garnered more praise than &quot;I&#x27;ll Do Anything&quot; and Brooks was again nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay. &quot;As Good as It Gets&quot; received a total of seven Academy Award nominations and won two: Best Actress for Helen Hunt and Best Actor for Jack Nicholson—the second time Nicholson won the award for a role cast by Brooks. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; labelled it Brooks&#x27; best film, writing that &quot;what Brooks manages to do with [the characters] as they struggle mightily to connect with one another is funny, painful, beautiful, and basically truthful—a triumph for everyone involved.&quot; It ranked 140 in &quot;Empire&quot; 2008 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. 

Brooks did not direct and write a film again for seven years until 2004&#x27;s &quot;Spanglish&quot;. Filming took six months, ending in June with three days of additional filming in October; Brooks produced three endings for the film, shooting several scenes in &quot;15 to 25 takes&quot; as he did not feel the film was tonally complete, although the script did not change much during filming. He opted to cast Adam Sandler in a more dramatic role than his usual goofball comedy parts based on his performance in &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; and Sandler&#x27;s relationship with his family. Describing the length of production, Brooks said: &quot;It&#x27;s amazing how much more perverse you are as a writer than as a director. I remember just being so happy that I&#x27;d painted myself into some corners [while writing]. I thought that would make it interesting. When I had to wrestle with that as a director, it was a different story.&quot; Brooks&#x27;s directing style &quot;drove [the cast] bats&quot;, especially Téa Leoni, with Cloris Leachman (who replaced an ill Anne Bancroft a month into filming) describing it as &quot;free-falling. You&#x27;re not going for some result. It&#x27;s just, throw it in the air and see where it lands.&quot; The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a box-office failure, grossing $55 million worldwide on an $80 million production budget.

His next film, entitled &quot;How Do You Know&quot;, was released December 17, 2010; Brooks produced, directed and wrote it. The film stars Reese Witherspoon as a professional softball player involved in a love triangle. Brooks began work on the film in 2005, wishing to create a film about a young female athlete. While interviewing numerous women for hundreds of hours in his research for the film he also became interested in &quot;the dilemmas of contemporary business executives, who are sometimes held accountable by the law for corporate behavior of which they may not even be aware.&quot; He created Paul Rudd and Jack Nicholson&#x27;s characters for this concept. Filming finished in November 2009, although Brooks later reshot the film&#x27;s opening and ending. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;perhaps the most closely guarded of Columbia&#x27;s movies this year.&quot; Brooks was paid $10 million for the project, which cost $100 million. The film was negatively received. Patrick Goldstein wrote in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that &quot;the characters were stick figures, the jokes were flat, the situations felt scarily insular.&quot; He felt the film showed Brooks had &quot;finally lost his comic mojo&quot; concluding &quot;his films used to have a wonderfully restless, neurotic energy, but &quot;How Do You Know&quot; feels like it was phoned in from someone resting uncomfortably on his laurels.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot;″s Peter Debruge also felt the film showed Brooks had lost his &quot;spark&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; was more positive, writing &quot;without being great, it&#x27;s still the flat-out finest romantic comedy of the year,&quot; while &quot;Brooks hasn&#x27;t lost his gift for dreaming up heroes and heroines who worry amusingly.&quot;

Brooks started his own film and television production company, Gracie Films, in 1986. He produced &quot;Big&quot; (1988) and &quot;The War of the Roses&quot; (1989). Brooks mentored Cameron Crowe and was the executive producer of Crowe&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Say Anything...&quot; (1989) and produced his later film &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996). Brooks also helped Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson after their feature-length script and short film version of &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; (1996) were brought to his attention. Brooks went to Wilson and Anderson&#x27;s apartment in Dallas after agreeing to produce the film. Wilson stated: &quot;I think he felt kind of sorry for us&quot;. Despite having &quot;the worst [script] reading [Brooks] had ever heard&quot;, Brooks kept faith in the project. Brooks produced and directed &quot;Brooklyn Laundry&quot;, his first theatrical production, in 1990. It starred Glenn Close, Woody Harrelson and Laura Dern. In 2007 Brooks appeared—along with Nora Ephron, Carrie Fisher and others in &quot;Dreams on Spec&quot;, a documentary about screenwriting in Hollywood.

=== Return to television ===

Although Brooks &quot;never meant&quot; to return to television in the late 1980s, he was helping Tracey Ullman start &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; and when she could not find another producer, he stepped in. On the suggestion of friend and colleague Polly Platt, who gave Brooks the nine-panel &quot;Life in Hell&quot; cartoon entitled &quot;The Los Angeles Way of Death&quot; which hangs outside Brooks&#x27; Gracie Films office, Brooks asked &quot;Life in Hell&quot; cartoonist Matt Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts to appear on &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot;. Groening initially intended to present an animated version of his &quot;Life in Hell&quot; series. However, when Groening realized that animating &quot;Life in Hell&quot; would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life&#x27;s work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family in the lobby of Brooks&#x27; office. After the success of the shorts, the Fox Broadcasting Company in 1989 commissioned a series of half-hour episodes of the show, now called &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, which Brooks produced alongside Groening and Sam Simon. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show&#x27;s content. According to writer Jon Vitti, Brooks contributed more to the episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Substitute&quot; than to any other in the show&#x27;s history. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; garnered critical and commercial acclaim, winning numerous awards and is still producing original content after 30 years. In a 1998 issue celebrating the 20th century&#x27;s greatest achievements in arts and entertainment, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named &quot;The Simpsons&quot; the century&#x27;s best television series. In 1997 Brooks was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.

In 1995, Brooks and Groening were involved in a public dispute over the episode &quot;A Star Is Burns&quot;. Groening felt that the episode was a thirty-minute advertisement for Brooks&#x27; show &quot;The Critic&quot; (which had moved to Fox from ABC for its second season), and was created by former &quot;The Simpsons&quot; showrunners Al Jean and Mike Reiss, and whose lead character Jay Sherman appears in the episode. He hoped Brooks would pull the episode because &quot;articles began to appear in several newspapers around the country saying that [Groening] created &quot;The Critic&quot;&quot;, and remove his name from the credits. In response, Brooks said &quot;I am furious with Matt. he&#x27;s been going to everybody who wears a suit at Fox and complaining about this. When he voiced his concerns about how to draw &quot;The Critic&quot; into the Simpsons&#x27; universe, he was right and we agreed to his changes. Certainly, he&#x27;s allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far...He is a gifted, adorable, cuddly ingrate. But his behavior right now is rotten.&quot;

&quot;The Critic&quot; was short-lived, broadcasting ten episodes on Fox before its cancellation. A total of 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 with a series of ten internet broadcast webisodes. The series has since developed a cult following thanks to reruns on Comedy Central and its complete-series release on DVD. Brooks&#x27; early-1990s shows &quot;Sibs&quot; and &quot;Phenom&quot;, both produced as part of a multi-show deal with ABC, and the 2001 show &quot;What About Joan&quot; for the same network, were all similarly short-lived.

Brooks co-produced and co-wrote the 2007 feature-length film adaptation of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;. He directed the voice cast for the first time since the television show&#x27;s early seasons. Dan Castellaneta found the recording sessions &quot;more intense&quot; than recording the television series, and &quot;more emotionally dramatic&quot;. Some scenes, such as Marge&#x27;s video message to Homer, were recorded over one hundred times, leaving the voice cast exhausted. Brooks conceived the idea for, co-produced and co-wrote the Maggie-centric short film &quot;The Longest Daycare&quot;, which played in front of &quot;Ice Age: Continental Drift&quot; in 2012. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2013.

== Personal life ==
Brooks has been married twice. His first wife was Marianne Catherine Morrissey; they have one daughter, Amy Lorraine Brooks. They divorced in 1972. In 1978 he married Holly Beth Holmberg; they had three children together: daughter Chloe and sons Cooper and Joseph. They divorced in 1999.

He is also a member of the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. Brooks has donated over $175,000 to Democratic Party candidates. In January 2017, Brooks stated in an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; that his career was now just focused staying with &quot;The Simpsons&quot; until the show ends and continuing to run into Steven Spielberg &quot;in the market.&quot;

Brooks is an avid fan of the Los Angeles Clippers.

<text>In computing, the Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE; often pronounced as &quot;pixie&quot;), often called PXE boot (&quot;pixie boot&quot;), is a specification describing a standardized client–server environment that boots a software assembly, retrieved from a network, on PXE-enabled clients. On the client side it requires only a PXE-capable network interface controller (NIC), and uses a small set of industry-standard network protocols such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP).

The concept behind the PXE originated in the early days of protocols like BOOTP/DHCP/TFTP, and it forms part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) standard. In modern data centers, PXE is the most frequent choice for operating system booting, installation and deployment.

== Overview ==
Since the beginning of computer networks, there has been a persistent need for client systems which can boot appropriate software images, with appropriate configuration parameters, both retrieved at boot time from one or more network servers. This goal requires a client to use a set of pre-boot services, based on industry standard network protocols. Additionally, the Network Bootstrap Program (NBP) which is initially downloaded and run must be built using a client firmware layer (at the device to be bootstrapped via PXE) providing a hardware independent standardized way to interact with the surrounding network booting environment. In this case the availability and subjection to standards are a key factor required to guarantee the network boot process system interoperability.

One of the first attempts in this regard was bootstrap loading using TFTP standard RFC 906, published in 1984, which established the 1981 published Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) standard RFC 783 to be used as the standard file transfer protocol for bootstrap loading. It was followed shortly after by the Bootstrap Protocol standard RFC 951 (BOOTP), published in 1985, which allowed a diskless client machine to discover its own IP address, the address of a TFTP server, and the name of an NBP to be loaded into memory and executed. BOOTP implementation difficulties, among other reasons, eventually led to the development of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol standard RFC 2131 (DHCP) published in 1997. The pioneering TFTP/BOOTP/DHCP approach fell short, as at the time, it did not define the required standardized client side of the provisioning environment.

The Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) was introduced as part of the Wired for Management framework by Intel and is described in the specification published by Intel and SystemSoft. PXE version 2.0 was released in December 1998, and the update 2.1 was made public in September 1999. The PXE environment makes use of several standard client‑server protocols including DHCP and TFTP (now defined by the 1992 published RFC 1350). Within the PXE schema the client side of the provisioning equation is an integral part of the PXE standard and it is implemented either as a Network Interface Card (NIC) BIOS extension or current devices in UEFI code. This distinctive firmware layer makes available at the client the functions of a basic Universal Network Device Interface (UNDI), a minimalistic UDP/IP stack, a Preboot (DHCP) client module and a TFTP client module, together forming the PXE application programming interfaces (APIs) used by the NBP when needing to interact with the services offered by the server counterpart of the PXE environment. TFTP&#x27;s low throughput, especially when used over high-latency links, has been initially mitigated by the TFTP Blocksize Option RFC 2348 published in May 1998, and later by the TFTP Windowsize Option RFC 7440 published in January 2015, allowing potentially larger payload deliveries and thus improving throughput.

== Details ==
The PXE environment relies on a combination of industry-standard Internet protocols, namely UDP/IP, DHCP and TFTP. These protocols have been selected because they are easily implemented in the client&#x27;s NIC firmware, resulting in standardized small-footprint PXE ROMs. Standardization, small size of PXE firmware images and their low use of resources are some of the primary design goals, allowing the client side of the PXE standard to be identically implemented on a wide variety of systems, ranging from powerful client computers to resource-limited single-board computers (SBC) and system-on-a-chip (SoC) computers.

DHCP is used to provide the appropriate client network parameters and specifically the location (IP address) of the TFTP server hosting, ready for download, the initial bootstrap program (NBP) and complementary files. To initiate a PXE bootstrap session the DHCP component of the client&#x27;s PXE firmware broadcasts a DHCPDISCOVER packet containing PXE-specific options to port 67/UDP (DHCP server port); it asks for the required network configuration and network booting parameters. The PXE-specific options identify the initiated DHCP transaction as a PXE transaction. Standard DHCP servers (non PXE enabled) will be able to answer with a regular DHCPOFFER carrying networking information (i.e. IP address) but not the PXE specific parameters. A PXE client will not be able to boot if it only receives an answer from a non PXE enabled DHCP server.

After parsing a PXE enabled DHCP server DHCPOFFER, the client will be able to set its own network IP address, IP Mask, etc., and to point to the network located booting resources, based on the received TFTP Server IP address and the name of the NBP. The client next transfers the NBP into its own random-access memory (RAM) using TFTP, possibly verifies it (i.e. UEFI Secure Boot), and finally boots from it. NBPs are just the first link in the boot chain process and they generally request via TFTP a small set of complementary files in order to get running a minimalistic OS executive (i.e. WindowsPE, or a basic Linux kernel+initrd). The small OS executive loads its own network drivers and TCP/IP stack. At this point, the remaining instructions required to boot or install a full OS are provided not over TFTP, but using a robust transfer protocol (such as HTTP, CIFS, or NFS).

== Integration ==

The PXE Client/Server environment was designed so it can be seamlessly integrated with an already in place DHCP and TFTP server infrastructure.
This design goal presented a challenge when dealing with the classic DHCP protocol. Corporate DHCP servers are usually subject to strict policies that are designed to prevent easily adding the additional parameters and rules required to support a PXE environment. For this reason the PXE standard developed the concept of DHCP redirection or &quot;proxyDHCP&quot;. The idea behind a proxyDHCP is to split the PXE DHCP requirements in two independently run and administered server units:

# The classic DHCP server providing IP address, IP mask, etc. &quot;to all booting DHCP clients&quot;.
# The proxyDHCP server providing TFTP server IP address and name of the NBP &quot;only to PXE identified booting clients&quot;.

In a DHCP plus proxyDHCP server environment the PXE client initially broadcasts a single PXE DHCPDISCOVER packet and receives two complementary DHCPOFFERs; one from the regular non PXE enabled DHCP server and a second one from the proxyDHCP server. Both answers together provide the required information to allow the PXE client to continue with its booting process. This non-intrusive approach allows setting a PXE environment without touching the configuration of an already working DHCP server. The proxyDHCP service may also run on the same host as the standard DHCP service but even in this case they are both two independently run and administered applications. Since two services cannot use the same port 67/UDP on the same host, the proxyDHCP runs on port 4011/UDP. The proxyDHCP approach has proved to be extremely useful in a wide range of PXE scenarios going from corporate to home environments.

== Availability ==
PXE was conceived considering several system architectures. The version 2.1 of the specification defined architecture identifiers for six system types, including IA-64 and DEC Alpha. However, PXE v2.1 only completely covered IA-32. Despite this apparent lack of completeness Intel has recently decided to widely support PXE within the new UEFI specification extending the PXE functionality to all EFI/UEFI environments. 
Current Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Specification 2.4A, Section 21 Network Protocols — SNP, PXE, and BIS defines the protocols that provide access to network devices
while executing in the UEFI boot services environment. These protocols include the Simple Network Protocol (SNP), the PXE Base Code Protocol (PXE), and the Boot Integrity Services Protocol (BIS).
Today in a PXE environment the client architecture detection is rarely based on the identifiers originally included with the PXE v2.1 specification. Instead, each computer that will be booting from the network should have set DHCP option 93 to indicate the client&#x27;s architecture. This enables a PXE server to know (at boot time) the exact architecture of the client from the first network boot packet.

With the advent of IPv6, DHCP has evolved into DHCPv6; the need for options supporting PXE within the new DHCP protocol has been addressed in 2010.

The original PXE client firmware extension was designed as an Option ROM for the IA-32 BIOS, so a personal computer (PC) was originally made PXE-capable by installing a network interface controller (NIC) that provided a PXE Option ROM. Today the client PXE code is directly included within the NIC&#x27;s own firmware or as part of the UEFI firmware on the motherboard.

Even when the original client PXE firmware has been written by Intel and always provided at no cost as a linkable IA32 object code format module included in their Product Development Kit (PDK), the open source world has produced over the years non-standard derivative projects like gPXE/iPXE offering their own ROMs. While Intel based ROMs have been implementing the client side of the PXE standard for more than 20 years some users were willing to trade extra features for stability and PXE standard conformance.

== Acceptance ==
PXE acceptance since v2.1 has been ubiquitous; today it is virtually impossible to find a network card without PXE firmware on it. The availability of inexpensive Gigabit Ethernet hardware (NICs, switches, routers, etc.) has made PXE the fastest method available for installing an operating system on a client when competing against the classic CD, DVD, and USB flash drive alternatives.

Over the years several major projects have included PXE support, including: 
* All the major Linux distributions.
* OpenVMS on HPE Integrity and x86-64 hardware.
* Microsoft Remote Installation Services (RIS)
* Microsoft Windows Deployment Services (WDS) 
* Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT)
* Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM)

In regard to NBP development there are several projects implementing Boot Managers able to offer boot menu extended features, scripting capabilities, etc.:
* Syslinux PXELINUX
* gPXE/iPXE

All the above-mentioned projects, when they are able to boot/install more than one OS, work under a &quot;Boot Manager - Boot Loader&quot; paradigm. The initial NBP is a Boot Manager able to retrieve its own configuration and deploy a menu of booting options. The user selects a booting option and an OS dependent Boot Loader is downloaded and run in order to continue with the selected specific booting procedure.

== Sibling environments ==
Apple has come up with a very similar network boot approach under the umbrella of the Boot Server Discovery Protocol (BSDP) specification. BSDP v0.1 was initially published by Apple in August 1999 and its last v1.0.8 was published in September 2010. Mac OS X Server included a system tool called NetBoot. A NetBoot client uses BSDP to dynamically acquire resources that enable it to boot a suitable operating system. BSDP is crafted on top of DHCP using vendor-specific information to provide the additional NetBoot functionality not present in standard DHCP. The protocol is implemented in client firmware. At boot time, the client obtains an IP address via DHCP then discovers boot servers using BSDP. Each BSDP server responds with boot information consisting of:
* A list of bootable operating system images
* The default operating system image
* The client&#x27;s currently selected operating system image (if defined)

The client chooses an operating system from the list and sends a message to the server indicating its selection. The selected boot server responds supplying the boot file and
boot image, and any other information needed to download and execute the selected operating system.

== Descendant environments ==
Microsoft created a non-overlapping extension of the PXE environment with their Boot Information Negotiation Layer (BINL). BINL is implemented as a server service and it is a key component of their Remote Installation Services (RIS) and Windows Deployment Services (WDS) strategies. It includes certain preparation processes and a network protocol that could be somehow considered a Microsoft-crafted DHCP extension. BINL is a Microsoft proprietary technology that uses PXE standard client firmware. Currently there is not a publicly available BINL specification.

<text>Jerry O&#x27;Neil Lawler (born November 29, 1949), better known as Jerry &quot;the King&quot; Lawler, is an American retired color commentator and professional wrestler signed to WWE under a Legends contract.

Prior to joining the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1992, he wrestled in numerous territories, winning many championships, including multiple World Heavyweight Championships, throughout his career. Lawler is a one-time AWA World Heavyweight Champion and a three-time WCWA World Heavyweight Champion: he unified the titles by defeating Kerry Von Erich at Superclash III, forming the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship, a championship which he held 28 times. He is also known for his feud with comedian Andy Kaufman, and for portraying himself in the 1999 Jim Carrey film about Kaufman, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;.

In 2007, Lawler was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Lawler was born November 29, 1949, in Memphis, Tennessee, where he graduated from Treadwell High School. When he was 19, his father, Jerome Lawler, died.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1970–1977)===
While working in Memphis, Tennessee, as a disc jockey, Lawler&#x27;s artistic ability attracted the attention of local wrestling promoter Aubrey Griffith.

The two made an agreement in which Lawler would give Griffith free publicity in exchange for free wrestling training. Lawler debuted as a wrestler in 1970, and won his first championship in September 1971 by winning a battle royal. He soon won the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship under the managerial service of Sam Bass with partner Jim White. In 1974, Lawler began feuding with Jackie Fargo, who had been his trainer and mentor. This led to a match for the NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship. On July 24, 1974, Lawler won the belt and the title of &quot;King of Wrestling.&quot;

During 1975, Lawler teamed with a variety of partners such as Mr Wrestling II, Don Greene, and Bob Orton, Jr. He won the NWA Macon Tag Team Championship twice during this period. While Lawler began his career as a heel, he became a face after splitting from Bass at the end of 1974.

===Continental Wrestling Association (1977–1989)===

In 1977, promoter Jerry Jarrett broke away from Nick Gulas&#x27; NWA Mid-America promotion and formed his own promotion, the Continental Wrestling Association. Lawler—Gulas&#x27; biggest star—opted to join Jarrett. The CWA quickly outperformed NWA Mid-America, which ultimately folded in 1981. Lawler was both a co-owner of the CWA and its top star.

On November 12, 1979, while working in the CWA, Lawler defeated Superstar Billy Graham to become the CWA World Champion. In 1980, coming off the back end of a feud with The Fabulous Freebirds, his career was put on hold due to a broken leg suffered in a game of touch football, but he returned to the ring after several months.

In 1982, Lawler began a notorious feud with comedian Andy Kaufman. At the time, Kaufman wrestled women as part of his skits and had declared himself the Intergender Heavyweight Champion. On April 5, Lawler, who had taken exception to the skits, wrestled Kaufman in Memphis. During the course of the match, Lawler delivered two piledrivers to Kaufman, the second after the bell rang, sending him to the hospital and nearly breaking his neck. On July 29, Lawler slapped Kaufman in the face on an episode of &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. Kaufman responded by shouting profanities and throwing his coffee at Lawler.

Years later, Lawler appeared as himself in the Kaufman biopic &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;; the film revealed that Lawler&#x27;s feud with Kaufman had been staged. Lawler later claimed that not only was his entire feud with Kaufman staged, but also the two were actually very good friends.

In 1988, Lawler feuded with Dutch Mantel.

In 1989, the CWA merged with World Class Championship Wrestling to form the United States Wrestling Association.

===American Wrestling Association (1982–1985, 1987–1988)===
On March 7, 1983, Lawler won the AWA International Championship by defeating Austin Idol. On May 30, 1983, Bill Dundee defeated Jerry Lawler for the AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship. The feud quickly escalated and on June 6, 1983, the two met in a Loser Leaves Town Match for the title, in which Lawler won. Lawler defeated Ken Patera on July 25 to begin his second reign as the International Champion. Lawler became the NWA Mid America Champion on April 12, 1984, when he defeated Randy Savage for the title. He later returned to the United States, where he defeated Bill Dundee on July 29, 1986, to begin a new reign as the AWA International Champion. Lawler feuded with Tommy Rich, Austin Idol, and Paul E. Dangerously throughout early 1987. The animosity began after controversy over an AWA World Championship title shot involving Nick Bockwinkel. During the feud, the trio defeated Lawler in a steel cage match and cut his hair, which caused a riot in the Mid-South Coliseum.

Lawler won the AWA World Heavyweight Championship from Curt Hennig on May 9, 1988. During his reign, Lawler feuded with World Class Championship Wrestling&#x27;s Champion Kerry Von Erich. He defeated Von Erich on December 15, 1988, at Superclash III to unify the two titles. Soon after, Lawler&#x27;s issues with Verne Gagne led to his departure from the AWA, most notably Lawler claiming that he was never paid for the match at Superclash.

===World Class Championship Wrestling (1988–1989)===
Lawler continued feuding with Kerry Von Erich in WCCW. He lost to Von Erich in a steel cage match on November 25, 1988. He would defeat Von Erich by disqualification to retain the WCCW heavyweight title. He wrestled Mil Mascaras to a draw on July 28.

===Other promotions (1981–1989)===
In 1981, Lawler wrestled for Championship Wrestling From Florida feuding with Dory Funk Jr. and Terry Funk. In 1985, Lawler traveled to Hawaii, where he won the NWA Polynesian Pacific title on January 25, 1986, defeating Lars Anderson. He dropped the title to Tui Selinga on March 26 in Honolulu, Hawaii.

In March 1989, he wrestled for New Japan Pro-Wrestling. He lost to IWGP Heavyweight Champion Tatsumi Fujinami on March 16, 1989.

===United States Wrestling Association (1989–1997)===
In 1989, Lawler made his debut in the Memphis brand United States Wrestling Association, where he won the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship 28 times from 1989 until its doors closed in 1997. While champion, he feuded with The Soultaker, Jimmy Valiant, Kamala, Eddie Gilbert, and Jeff Jarrett.

In 1992, Lawler teamed with Jeff Jarrett in a feud against The Moondogs. The feud between Jarrett/Lawler and The Moondogs was voted the 1992 PWI Feud of the Year by &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot;. He won the USWA World Tag Team Championship with Jarrett four times and twice with Bill Dundee.

Lawler dropped the USWA Unified World Heavyweight for the last time to Dutch Mantel on August 8, 1997, in an All Body Hair match. The promotion closed in November 1997.

===World Wrestling Federation (1992–2001)===

====Feuds with Bret Hart and Doink the Clown (1992–1995)====
Lawler began his WWF career in December 1992 as an announcer on &quot;Superstars&quot;, while still working in USWA. He made his in-ring debut at the 1993 Royal Rumble when he participated in the namesake match, which was won by Yokozuna. From 1993 to 1995, he feuded with Bret Hart and the rest of the Hart family. The feud began at King of the Ring when Lawler interrupted Hart&#x27;s victory ceremony and attacked Bret.

Lawler claimed that he was the only true king in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and the two were scheduled to wrestle at SummerSlam to settle the dispute. At the event, however, Lawler came to the ring on crutches and claimed that he could not wrestle because of injuries suffered in a car accident. Hart faced Lawler&#x27;s &quot;court jester&quot;, Doink the Clown instead, and beat him by submission. Lawler then attacked Hart, revealing that he was not injured. Hart defeated Lawler by submission but refused to release the Sharpshooter. As a result, the referee reversed the decision and awarded the title of &quot;Undisputed King of the World Wrestling Federation&quot; to Lawler. The two would continue to work throughout the fall on the house show circuit, including in steel cages.

Simultaneously, in a form of cross-promotion, Lawler engaged in a bitter feud with Vince McMahon (who at the time was never advertised as the actual owner of the World Wrestling Federation) back in the USWA. There, Lawler played the babyface to his hometown Memphis audience, whereas McMahon (who had always played face in the WWF) was being portrayed as a smug heel intent on dethroning Lawler as the king of professional wrestling. As part of the cross-promotion, McMahon, Bret and Owen Hart, Giant González, Tatanka, and &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage would begin appearing on USWA television to further the feud. While the program continued in the USWA, the feud between Lawler and McMahon would not be acknowledged on WWF television.

The Hart family (Bret, Owen, Bruce, and Keith) was scheduled to face a team captained by Lawler in an elimination match at Survivor Series. However, Shawn Michaels had to take Lawler&#x27;s place because Lawler was facing legal troubles. He was indicted for raping and sodomizing a 15-year-old girl, though charges were dropped when the alleged victim recanted her story.

As a result, the feud between Lawler and Vince McMahon back in the USWA was also abruptly discontinued. Lawler did not face Bret Hart at another pay-per-view until the first In Your House, when he beat Hart after Hakushi and his manager Shinja interfered. This set up a &quot;Kiss My Foot&quot; match at King of the Ring 1995, which Bret won. As a result, Lawler was forced to kiss Bret&#x27;s feet. The feud took one final turn when Lawler introduced his &quot;dentist&quot; Isaac Yankem, D.D.S.. After Hart defeated Yankem by disqualification, however, the feud quickly disappeared.

Following the end of his legal troubles which kept him out of Survivor Series 1993, Lawler eventually returned to the WWF at WrestleMania X, which was also his first appearance as a commentator on a WWF pay-per-view. During the main event of the night, &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper served as special guest referee for the second WWF World Heavyweight Championship match. During this Lawler began making disparaging remarks about him. Lawler would continue to berate Piper on later episodes of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, including bringing a skinny kid into the ring dressed as Piper and forcing him to kiss his feet. This ultimately led to a match between the two at King of the Ring 1994 which Lawler lost.

In the fall of 1994, Lawler initiated a feud with Doink the Clown. Lawler popped the balloons carried by Doink&#x27;s midget sidekick, Dink. After Doink and Dink retaliated, Lawler introduced a midget sidekick of his own, who he named Queasy. In the following weeks, Doink added two more sidekicks, Wink and Pink, while Lawler introduced Sleazy and Cheesy. This led to an elimination match at Survivor Series 1994, which Lawler&#x27;s team won. After the match, however, Lawler&#x27;s team turned on him, joining with Doink&#x27;s team to attack Lawler.

====Smoky Mountain and various feuds (1994–1996)====

In late 1994 and early 1995, Lawler wrestled briefly in Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) while still continuing to commentate sporadically for the WWF. During his absences, Shawn Michaels filled in for him as color commentator on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;. He defeated Tony Anthony for the promotion&#x27;s top title in January 1995. Lawler was the last SMW Heavyweight Champion defeating Brad Armstrong on Boxing Day 1995. The promotion closed its doors on December 30.

By 1996, Lawler wrestled occasionally on &quot;WWF Superstars&quot; where he would take on jobbers while holding a microphone in the ring to, essentially, &quot;do the commentary on (his) very own matches&quot; while occasionally serving as the official cornerman for Isaac Yankem D.D.S. After a brief feud with The Ultimate Warrior, Lawler began feuding with Jake Roberts after making fun of Roberts&#x27; real life drug and alcohol problems. The two met in a match at SummerSlam 1996, which Lawler won. After the match, Lawler poured Jim Beam whiskey down Roberts&#x27; throat.

Afterwards, he feuded with Mark Henry, which the two meet at In Your House 10: Mind Games which Henry won.

====Part-time wrestling and commentator (1997–1998)====
In early 1997, Lawler was involved in a working relationship between the WWF and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). In June, Lawler entered the King of the Ring tournament for the first time and advanced to the semi-final round where he was defeated by Mankind. By the fall, the WWF introduced a new &quot;light-heavyweight division&quot; to compete with World Championship Wrestling (WCW)&#x27;s cruiserweight division. Lawler&#x27;s son, Brian Christopher, was one of the major superstars in the division, although the WWF played up an angle where both Lawler and Christopher would deny their family relationship, even though the two would aid each other in matches and so on. USWA folded in November of that year.

By 1998, Lawler rarely wrestled in the WWF and focused on commentary. Despite their feud in the USWA in 1993, by 1998, Vince McMahon had turned heel in the WWF for the first time and left the announce position, to which Lawler began praising McMahon&#x27;s name on commentary as part of his own heel persona, much to the chagrin of Jim Ross. It was McMahon&#x27;s departure from the commentary team which led to the strong on-screen chemistry between Lawler and Ross in subsequent years. This played a key role in a change of Lawler&#x27;s character; although he still supported the heels, he showed a sense of right and wrong, and would condemn actions of heels when they went too far.

====Sporadic appearances, feud with Tazz, and departure (1999–2001)====
Lawler during this period would continue commentating and rarely wrestled for the WWF. He wrestled between 1999 and 2001 mainly in house shows. On June 22, 2000, he made an appearance on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; teaming with The Kat to defeat Dean Malenko and Terri Runnels. This would be the first time in two years he wrestled on WWF television. A week later, he defeated Malenko on &quot;Raw.&quot;

He would turn face by 2000 (while wrestling). This began when Lawler surprisingly attacked Tazz when Tazz started bullying Jim Ross, thus beginning a feud with Tazz. At SummerSlam on August 27, Lawler wrestled Tazz in defense of Ross, and defeated him. At Unforgiven on September 24, he lost to Tazz in a Leather Strap match. Also, Lawler feuded with Tazz&#x27;s partner Raven until January 2001.

With the creation of the XFL in 2001, Lawler was given the job as an announcer for the new football league. Lawler claims that he never wanted to announce for the XFL (he would admit on-air that he knew and cared almost nothing about the sport), but that he agreed to it after McMahon and Kevin Dunn asked him.

In February 2001, Lawler&#x27;s then-wife Stacy &quot;the Kat&quot; Carter was involved in a storyline where Right to Censor (RTC), a group of wrestlers purportedly wanting to rein in the vulgarity of the &quot;Attitude Era,&quot; during which she demanded equal time for the &quot;right for nudity&quot;. RTC&#x27;s leader Steven Richards offered a match with Lawler at No Way Out on February 25. If Lawler won, Kat got naked and if Richards won, Kat became RTC property. Richards won the match at No Way Out. The next night, Lawler teamed with the APA (Bradshaw and Faarooq) as they defeated Right to Censor members Bull Buchanan, The Goodfather and Val Venis on &quot;Raw is War&quot;. This would be Lawler&#x27;s last WWF match.

After No Way Out, The Kat was released by the WWF and Lawler quit the company in protest.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1997)===
In 1997, Lawler became heavily involved in the working relationship between the WWF and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). In interviews and commentary, he referred to the promotion as &quot;Extremely Crappy Wrestling&quot;. His frequent insults toward ECW eventually led to the promotion &quot;invading&quot; &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; in February 1997. He wrestled in two matches. The first on July 19 at Heat Wave 1997 in a steel cage match with Rob Van Dam and Sabu in a no contest against Rick Rude, The Sandman, and Tommy Dreamer. He wrestled against Dreamer at ECW&#x27;s Hardcore Heaven pay-per-view in August, which Dreamer won.

===Independent circuit (2001–2012)===
During his absence from the WWF, Lawler made appearances on the independent circuit in both Australia and the States, as well as joining the fledgling Xcitement Wrestling Federation (XWF) promotion alongside WCW veteran Tony Schiavone as a color commentator. On October 26, 2001, he appeared on WWA The Inception as a commentator alongside Jeremy Borash, as well as wrestling in a battle royal. He also made appearances with the International Wrestling Cartel and with Maryland Championship Wrestling, where he held the promotion&#x27;s world title after defeating The Bruiser on November 2. He would return to WWF after a nine-month absence.

On March 31, 2002, he reunited with his son, Brian, to defeat David Flair and Jim Cornette at the Tojo Yamamoto Memorial Show.

On November 8, 2003, in a match refereed by Mick Foley, Lawler defeated Al Snow for the JAPW Heavyweight Championship in Secaucus, New Jersey. He lost the title a month later to Dan Maff.

Also made appearances in Ohio Valley Wrestling, International Wrestling Cartel, and other promotions.

On November 11, 2005, he teamed with Brad Armstrong and Jeff Hardy to defeat The Midnight Express and Jim Cornette for CCW A Tribute for Starrcade.

On November 7, 2008, a tribute show was held for Lawler called Lawler 35 - A Tribute Fit For The King. it was held in Nashville. In the main event match, he defeated Sid Vicious.

On March 16, 2012, he defeated Tommy Dreamer at Wrestle War 2012.

=== Return to WWF/WWE (2001–2024) ===

====Commentator and part-time wrestler (2001–2012)====

On November 19, 2001, after a nine-month hiatus from the company, Lawler returned to the WWF. He was reintroduced by Vince McMahon on &quot;Raw&quot; as the replacement for color commentator (and Alliance member) Paul Heyman, who had been (kayfabe) fired in the aftermath of the Alliance&#x27;s loss at the previous night&#x27;s Survivor Series. As he had been before his departure, Lawler once again became color commentator on &quot;Raw&quot; and pay-per-view events alongside Jim Ross and &quot;SmackDown!&quot; with Michael Cole, until the brands were separated and Lawler became exclusive to Raw. Lawler stated that his well-worked chemistry with Jim Ross has been a result of their different styles; according to Lawler, Jim Ross is a fine storyteller and keeps fans well-versed with current storylines, whereas he provides reaction and emotion to liven the commentary.

In 2003, &quot;Raw&#x27;s&quot; announce team of Lawler and Jim Ross feuded with &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;&#x27;s team of Jonathan Coachman and Al Snow. At Unforgiven, Lawler and Ross lost a match against Coachman and Snow, thus losing their right to do commentary on &quot;Raw&quot;. In a rematch, however, Ross defeated Coachman, winning Lawler and Ross their position back.

In 2006, Lawler faced Tazz at ECW One Night Stand, which Tazz won in only 30 seconds by making Lawler pass out to the Tazzmission.

In July 2006, Randy Orton began a feud with Hulk Hogan. Lawler attacked Orton in defense of Hogan, which set up a match between them on &quot;Raw&quot;. Orton defeated Lawler after a low blow and an RKO.

On March 31, 2007, Lawler was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by William Shatner, whom Lawler had a memorable altercation with on a January 1995 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. In August, King Booker claimed to be the only one entitled to be known as &quot;King&quot;. After being beaten by Booker in the ring, Lawler was supposed to be forced to crown his opponent at a show of August 13 in Madison Square Garden. During the ceremony, however, Lawler announced another king as a new opponent for King Booker, &quot;The King of Kings&quot; Triple H. This led to a worked brawl between Lawler and King Booker.

On the July 7, 2008, episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; Lawler was attacked by Kane after saving Michael Cole from a similar attack, in which Kane repeatedly asked &quot;Is he alive or is he dead?&quot; Later that summer, he teamed with &quot;Hacksaw&quot; Jim Duggan to face Ted DiBiase and Cody Rhodes for the World Tag Team Championship but lost.

On the March 23, 2009, episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; Lawler challenged Chris Jericho to a match because of his disrespectful and erratic behavior to WWE Hall of Famers, which Jericho accepted. The following week, Lawler lost to Jericho after submitting to the Walls of Jericho. After the match, Jericho outlined how he would remain supreme against WWE Hall of Famers at WrestleMania 25.

On the July 20 episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; Lawler announced himself as the opponent against The Brian Kendrick. He went on to defeat Kendrick. On the November 16 episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; after recent acquisition Sheamus attacked the timekeeper in frustration for not receiving an opponent, Lawler left the announce table to confront Sheamus and check on the victim, only to receive a kick to the head for his troubles. On June 7, 2010, during a Viewer&#x27;s Choice edition of &quot;Raw,&quot; Lawler lost his crown to IRS because he had apparently not paid his taxes, but it was regained by Quinton Jackson later on. At the end of the night, Lawler was one of the many employees at ringside that were brutally attacked by the season 1 NXT rookies. Lawler, however, was the only person at ringside that fought back, as he used punches and chops to attack the NXT rookies assaulting him until it was a 3-on-1 assault. The following week on Raw, Lawler and the Raw roster fought off the now-called &quot;The Nexus&quot; when they attempted to ambush John Cena a second time. On June 28, Lawler, Ricky Steamboat, Michael Hayes, Arn Anderson, Mike Rotunda and Dean Malenko were severely attacked by the Nexus, just as they were celebrating Steamboat&#x27;s career. Josh Mathews replaced Lawler on color commentator for the remainder of the show.

On the July 26 episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; Lawler teamed with Mark Henry, Goldust, Yoshi Tatsu, Evan Bourne and The Hart Dynasty in a tag team elimination match versus the Nexus. Lawler was eliminated by Heath Slater.

On the November 29 King of the Ring &quot;Raw&quot; special, Lawler (who was celebrating his 61st birthday) challenged The Miz to a WWE Championship match. It was granted by the Anonymous Raw General Manager, who made it a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match and it was Lawler&#x27;s first shot at the title. The Miz retained the championship after interference by Cole and Alex Riley. Cole&#x27;s interference caused tension between the two, but when Lawler threatened to attack Cole, the Anonymous Raw General Manager issued a &quot;cease and desist&quot; order, which barred any physicality between them.
Lawler continued to challenge with The Miz, where on the December 20 &quot;Raw,&quot; Lawler teamed with Randy Orton and John Morrison to take on The Miz, Riley and Sheamus in a 6-man tag match which Lawler won by pinning The Miz. This led to a rematch between The Miz and Lawler the following week, with Lawler once again getting the victory, this time by count-out after Morrison got involved. Lawler teamed with Orton again on the January 10, 2011 &quot;Raw&quot;, facing The Miz and Riley, which Lawler won by pinning Riley. Lawler won a 7-man Raw Rumble match on the January 31 &quot;Raw&quot; with help from John Cena to earn a WWE Championship match against The Miz at Elimination Chamber, where he was unsuccessful in winning the title, ending the feud.

The following night on &quot;Raw,&quot; Lawler, after having enough of Cole&#x27;s attitude, which included the mocking of Lawler&#x27;s mother&#x27;s recent death, challenged him to a match at WrestleMania XXVII, which Cole accepted on the February 28 &quot;Raw&quot; and announced that he would be trained in the coming weeks by Jack Swagger for the upcoming match. Stone Cold Steve Austin was announced as the guest referee for the match the following week. On the March 14 &quot;Raw,&quot; Lawler was confronted by his son, Brian Lawler, who was invited to Raw to &quot;expose&quot; his father&#x27;s character. Brian ranted about various problems he had with his father before slapping him and leaving. Cole continued to harass Lawler after Brian left, but was interrupted by a returning Jim Ross. Before Ross could attack Cole, Swagger attacked Lawler from behind and then proceeded to attack and lock in the ankle lock on Ross, while Cole harassed him. Lawler tried to stop the attack, but fell victim to the ankle lock as well.

At WrestleMania, Lawler initially won by submission, but the Anonymous Raw General Manager reversed the decision due to Stone Cold physically getting involved in the match by pushing Cole, making Cole the winner by disqualification. Lawler and Ross then faced Cole and Swagger at Extreme Rules in a Country Whipping match, where they were defeated. Lawler challenged Cole to one last match at Over the Limit, even going as far as to putting his Hall of Fame ring on the line and offered to personally induct Cole into the Hall of Fame itself. During the contract signing, Cole announced it would be a &quot;Kiss My Foot&quot; match. At the pay-per-view, Lawler defeated Cole. Afterwards, Ross, Eve Torres and Bret Hart helped Lawler by making Cole kiss his foot. Following the pay-per-view, Cole apologized to Lawler, ending the feud.
Lawler competed in the 2012 Royal Rumble match as the number 12 entrant, but was eliminated by Cody Rhodes after 43 seconds. He, along with Booker T, eliminated Cole afterwards. On the April 30, 2012, episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; Lawler competed in a &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; challenge to determine the number one contender for the WWE Championship match at Over the Limit, but was defeated by Daniel Bryan, who went on to challenge for the title. On the July 9 episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; Lawler went against Cole in a WrestleMania XXVII rematch, which he quickly won, but the anonymous &quot;Raw&quot; General Manager, who returned that night as the guest general manager, reversed the decision and Lawler lost to Cole by disqualification following interference by Booker T. Santino Marella came out to reveal that Hornswoggle was the Anonymous &quot;Raw&quot; General Manager, who was hiding underneath the ring.

On the July 23 episode of &quot;WWE Raw 1000,&quot; after CM Punk attacked The Rock, Lawler would mention on commentary that &quot;CM Punk has turned his back on the WWE Universe.&quot; The following week on &quot;Raw,&quot; Punk would confront Lawler about what he said before being interrupted by Big Show. On the August 20 episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; after Cena wouldn&#x27;t tell Punk he was the &quot;Best in the World,&quot; Punk would ask for Lawler to get in the ring and say it for the WWE Universe. After Lawler refused to say Punk was the &quot;Best in the World&quot; too, Punk would attack Lawler from behind. The next week on &quot;Raw,&quot; after Lawler demanded an apology from Punk, Punk would challenge Lawler to a match, which Lawler would accept later that night, where Punk would defeat Lawler in a Steel Cage match. Before the September 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Punk and Lawler brawled backstage, with Punk getting the upper hand before officials stopped them, Lawler was kicked in the throat, which caused Lawler to miss commentary that night, with The Miz filling in for him.

====Heart attack incident====
On September 10, 2012, during &quot;Raw&quot; at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, not long after defeating Punk and Dolph Ziggler in a tag-team match with Randy Orton, Lawler legitimately collapsed at the announcers table while Kane and Daniel Bryan competed against Titus O&#x27;Neil and Darren Young. Cole continued to call that match alone, as well as the next match, before WWE (through Cole) announced the medical situation with Lawler. The remaining matches on the show went ahead as scheduled but without commentary and updates on Lawler&#x27;s condition were provided by Cole. At the end of the broadcast, it was announced that he had received CPR, but was breathing independently and reacting to stimulation. Doctors said that Lawler was clinically dead for almost 30 minutes. It was later confirmed on WWE.com that Lawler had suffered a heart attack. On September 11, he underwent an angioplasty to improve blood flow to his heart. On September 12, Lawler was reported to be slowly being eased off sedation, his ventilator removed. He was able to blink, nod, and squeeze with his hands, and that same day, the results of several CT scans showed no signs of brain damage. By September 17, Lawler had returned to his home in Memphis. During Lawler&#x27;s hospital stay, it was determined that his heart attack was not caused by a blocked artery, but was instead an unexplained cardiac arrest. Lawler was soon medically cleared to continue wrestling.
It was announced on October 29 that Lawler would return to WWE on the November 12 episode of &quot;Raw.&quot; He continued his rivalry with Punk after his return was interrupted by Punk and Paul Heyman, who re-enacted his heart attack. Lawler continued to favor Punk&#x27;s opponents, hoping that Punk would lose the WWE Championship, which he eventually did to The Rock at the Royal Rumble much to Lawler&#x27;s delight.

====SmackDown (2015–2016)====
On January 8, 2015, it was announced on WWE.com that Lawler would be a part of the &quot;SmackDown&quot; broadcast team as a color commentator along with Cole and Byron Saxton starting January 15, ending his 19-year run as a color commentator of &quot;Raw&quot; as he was replaced by Booker T.

On the March 30 episode of &quot;Raw,&quot; however, Lawler made a one-night return to commentary with Saxton to fill in for Cole, Booker T and John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) after they were assaulted by Brock Lesnar after Lesnar was refused his rematch against Seth Rollins. On June 17, 2016, Lawler was suspended following his arrest for domestic violence, with WWE stating they have &quot;zero tolerance for matters involving domestic violence, and per our policy, Jerry Lawler was suspended indefinitely following his arrest&quot;, until July 1, when the charges were dropped and WWE lifted Lawler&#x27;s suspension.

On July 7, 2016, Lawler returned to &quot;SmackDown&quot; resuming his commentary role. However, shortly afterwards, Lawler was taken off air and placed on the pre-show of both &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; as an analyst.

====Sporadic appearances (2016–2019)====
On December 5, 2016, it was announced that Lawler would no longer be used on pre-shows and instead be kept for special events such as the Hall of Fame ceremony.

On January 17, 2017, Lawler returned to &quot;SmackDown Live&quot; to host the return of The King&#x27;s Court from his hometown of Memphis, Tennessee. During his interview with Dolph Ziggler, Ziggler took credit for Lawler&#x27;s real life heart attack in September 2012 before and kicking him in the chest and leaving the ring. Later that night on &quot;Talking Smack,&quot; Renee Young announced that Lawler, Cole and Corey Graves will be the commentary team for the Royal Rumble match at the 2017 Royal Rumble. On August 28, Lawler filled in for Booker T on &quot;Raw&quot; commentary from his hometown of Memphis. Lawler, Ross and numerous other WWE Legends appeared on Raw 25 on January 22, 2018. On January 26, it was revealed that Lawler signed a new one-year deal with WWE. At the 2018 Royal Rumble, during the men&#x27;s match, Lawler was the special guest commentator where he correctly predicted that Shinsuke Nakamura would win.

On March 21, 2018, Lawler suffered a stroke at his home in Memphis. He explained the incident on his podcast, which he revealed he couldn&#x27;t speak for three days. He stayed in the hospital&#x27;s ICU until he woke up three days later and regained his speech. The doctors said Lawler would make a full recovery. He was able to make all of his appearances during WrestleMania 34 weekend in New Orleans and was cleared to wrestle.

On April 8, 2018, at WrestleMania 34, Lawler called the fifth annual André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal on the WrestleMania 34 pre-show, alongside Ross and Saxton.

On September 26, 2019, WWE announced as a part of their &quot;WWE Premiere Week&quot; that a new commentary team will be on &quot;Raw.&quot; Lawler would return to full-time commentary on &quot;Raw,&quot; as an analyst alongside Vic Joseph and Dio Maddin beginning on the September 30, 2019, edition of &quot;Raw.&quot; By January 2020, Lawler had outlasted both Joseph and Maddin, who were replaced by Tom Phillips and Byron Saxton, respectively. Lawler was replaced by Samoa Joe on the April 27, 2020, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

====Sporadic appearances (2023–present)====
Following his 2023 stroke recovery, Lawler appeared at &quot;Raw&quot; in Memphis, Tennessee on August 28, 2023, in a segment for the live audience, which was later uploaded to WWE&#x27;s YouTube page as a digital exclusive. On the November 28, 2023, episode of NXT, he chose the participants that will compete in the Iron Survivor Challenge at NXT Deadline.

In 2007, it was announced that Lawler would be participating in a &#x27;dream match&#x27; with Hulk Hogan which had been set to take place in the Memphis Wrestling promotion on April 27. The match had been heavily hyped by promoter Corey Maclin as Hogan had competed in the Memphis territory early in his career. On April 12, however, Lawler pulled out of the event citing his contractual obligations to WWE rendering him unable to appear on a show that was due to be filmed by VH1 for the television show &quot;Hogan Knows Best&quot;. On January 11, 2008, Maclin revealed that he filed a lawsuit against WWE, claiming that pressure on Lawler (and others) to withdraw from the event violated section two of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

===Jerry Lawler&#x27;s Memphis Wrestling (2010)===
In May 2010, Lawler announced a new TV wrestling show called, &quot;Jerry Lawler&#x27;s Memphis Wrestling&quot;.

==Other endeavors==
Lawler has created some musical recordings. Among these are two late-1970s singles: &quot;Cadillac Man/Memphis&quot;, and &quot;Bad News&quot;. During his feud with manager Jimmy Hart (Lawler is a factor for &quot;The Mouth of the South&quot; Jimmy Hart entering professional wrestling; Lawler wanted to record a wrestling album with him singing, and since they had gone to school together, he called Hart and asked him to be a part of it) in the mid-1980s, Hart became known as &quot;The Wimp&quot;, a nickname given to him by Lawler and chanted by fans. Hart was the subject of the song &quot;Wimpbusters&quot;, which was sung by Lawler to the tune of the popular hit &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; by Ray Parker Jr.. A music video was also made, featuring Lawler, legendary announcer Lance Russell, and wrestlers such as Randy Savage, Jimmy Valiant, Dutch Mantel, Tommy Rich, and Rufus R. Jones, along with footage of &quot;The King&quot; beating Hart and his &quot;First Family.&quot; A very young Brian Christopher also made an appearance as a young child being bullied, and another child is seen wearing a replica of Tully Blanchard&#x27;s West Texas State jersey. He also recorded a CD titled &quot;Memphis&#x27; Other King&quot;.

Lawler had his own talk show called &quot;The Jerry Lawler Show&quot; on WMC-TV in Memphis during the 1980s.

In 1998, Lawler appeared in the film &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, starring Jim Carrey. According to Lawler&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;It&#x27;s Good To Be The King... Sometimes&quot;, an incident involving Jim Carrey forgetting a line led to animosity between the two actors during filming. Between scenes Jim Carrey often remained in character as Andy Kaufman and at one point spit on Jerry, just as Kaufman had done in 1982. A &#x27;stunned&#x27; Lawler reacted by grabbing Carrey by the hair and locked him in a sleeper hold and jerking his neck— sending Carrey to the hospital.

In 1999, Lawler ran for mayor of Memphis, Tennessee. His platform focused on making the streets safer for residents, beautifying the city, and improving the quality of education. In addition, he vowed to attract businesses to Memphis, improve the flow of traffic, create more parks, and decrease property taxes. Lawler ended up with 11.7% of ballots, beating twelve of the fifteen candidates. Ultimately, however, Mayor Willie Herenton was easily reelected.

In 2000, Lawler made a very brief cameo appearance in the music video of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Lie To Me&quot; By Clay Davidson. On December 17, 2002; he released his autobiography titled &quot;It&#x27;s Good To Be The King... Sometimes&quot;. On July 8, 2009, Lawler again ran for the position of Mayor of Memphis in a special mayoral election; on October 15, 2009. He was in 5th with 4% of the vote.

Lawler is also a commercial artist, designing graphics for various companies, including WWE. In 2007, he painted the cover of the wrestling comic book &quot;Headlocked&quot;.

In 2012, he played the role of Sheriff Jackson Cole in the horror comedy film &quot;Girls Gone Dead&quot;.

Lawler has provided his voice for numerous WWE video games in which he has appeared as a commentator. He is also a playable character in a number of WWE games, &quot;WWE All Stars&quot; as a wrestler, &quot;WWE &#x27;12&quot; as both a wrestler and a commentator and &quot;WWE &#x27;13&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K14&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K15&quot;, and &quot;WWE 2K16&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K17&quot; and &quot;WWE 2K Battlegrounds&quot; simply as a commentator and &quot;WWE 2K20&quot; as a wrestler.

In 2016, Lawler and business partner Barry Aycock opened a wrestling-themed establishment &quot;King Jerry Lawler&#x27;s Hall of Fame Bar &amp; Grille&quot; on Beale Street, Downtown Memphis, Tennessee. The next year Lawler opened King Jerry Lawler&#x27;s Memphis BBQ Co. in Cordova, Tennessee.

In March 2017, Lawler launched the wrestling and pop-culture podcast &quot;Dinner with the King&quot;. His co-host is Glenn Moore and the podcast is produced by Pod Avenue. The podcast ceased production after Moore was accused of scamming Lawler fans who tried to buy merchandise and artwork from Lawler. Lawler and new co-host Scott Reedy started a new podcast called &quot;The Jerry Lawler Show&quot; in 2019 and ran until 2020.

==Personal life==

Lawler is the cousin of fellow professional wrestler The Honky Tonk Man. Lawler has been married three times and had two sons with his first wife, Kay. His son Brian, who wrestled in WWF/E under the names &quot;Brian Christopher&quot; and &quot;Grandmaster Sexay,&quot; died by suicide on July 29, 2018. His other son, Kevin, has been in professional wrestling as both a referee and wrestler under the names &quot;Kevin Christian&quot; and &quot;Freddie Gilbert,&quot; the latter of which was used during a stint as the &quot;brother&quot; of Eddie Gilbert.

In his book, &quot;It&#x27;s Good To Be The King ... Sometimes&quot;, Lawler says he believes Kevin&#x27;s short physical stature has prevented him from reaching success similar to Brian. In August 2008, Kevin was arrested on charges of trespassing and aggravated burglary. After divorcing Kay, Lawler was later married to Paula from February 14, 1982, to October 2, 1991.

He met his third wife, Stacy &quot;The Kat&quot; Carter, at a charity softball game in Memphis, Tennessee, on July 23, 1989. They married in September 2000. In mid-February 2001, Carter (who was a valet and has also made in-ring appearances) was released by the World Wrestling Federation. Lawler then left the company in protest. Carter and Lawler later separated shortly before Lawler rejoined the WWF in November 2001. Their divorce was finalized on October 15, 2003.

Though he has spent most of his life in Memphis, Lawler did spend a part of his childhood in Ohio after his father was transferred to a Ford Motor Company assembly plant in Lorain, Ohio. From the ages of 7 to 15 his family resided in the city of Amherst, Ohio, a suburb near Cleveland. Although this stay was brief, it would have an influence on Lawler throughout his life thereafter. He often cites Cleveland as his second-favorite city behind only Memphis and is a die-hard fan of the Cleveland Guardians, the Cleveland Browns, and the Cleveland Cavaliers. When WWE performs in Cleveland, Lawler will usually wear a Browns jersey or an Indians jersey (at SummerSlam 1996 he teased Browns fans by wearing a Baltimore Ravens jersey, because the original Browns moved to Baltimore and became the Ravens), and during baseball season, he would throw out the first pitch at an Indians game.

Lawler is a collector of Coca-Cola and Superman merchandise, and owns a replica of the Batmobile from the 1960s Batman series.

In late 1993, Lawler was indicted in Jefferson County, Kentucky, on charges of statutory rape and sodomy of a 15-year-old girl. Lawler later made a plea for a lesser charge after witnesses refused to testify. Lawler then returned to work for the World Wrestling Federation.

Lawler&#x27;s son Brian was found hanging in the Hardeman County Jail on July 29, 2018, and was pronounced dead later that day. On the one-year anniversary of his death, Lawler filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Hardeman County, Hardeman County Sheriff John Doolen and others for allegedly failing to protect him. He alleged that Doolen had personally promised to &quot;keep an eye&quot; on Brian after he was incarcerated.

On February 7, 2023, Lawler was rushed to the hospital after suffering a stroke at his Florida home. Lawler had previously suffered a stroke in 2018.

<text>HMAS &quot;Adroit&quot; (P 82) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats, based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols around Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels. The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Their propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. The main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, which was supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Adroit&quot; was laid down by Evans Deakin and Company at Brisbane, Queensland, in August 1967, launched on 3 February 1968 and commissioned on 17 August 1968.

==Operational history==
The patrol boat was transferred to the Fremantle Port Division of the Royal Australian Navy Reserve in March 1983.

==Fate==
&quot;Adroit&quot; paid off on 28 March 1992. The patrol boat was sunk as a target by A-4 Skyhawk aircraft of No. 2 Squadron RNZAF on 8 August 1994. The wreck is located in the Rottnest ship graveyard, west of Rottnest Island.

<doc id="432261" wikidata="Q3367530" url="?curid=432261" title="Music of the Isle of Man">
<text>The music of the Isle of Man reflects Celtic, Norse and other influences, including those from its neighbours, Scotland, Ireland, England and Wales. The Isle of Man is a small island nation in the Irish Sea, between Great Britain and Ireland (and not part of the United Kingdom).

A wide range of music is performed on the island, such as rock, blues, jazz and pop. However, its traditional folk music has undergone a revival since the 1970s, starting with a music festival called in Ramsey. This was part of a general revival of the Manx language and culture, after the death of the last native speaker of Manx in 1974.

Musicians of the Manx musical revival include King Chiaullee, Skeeal, The Mannin Folk, Mactullagh Vannin, Moot and many others. Culture Vannin provides a central resource for Manx music and dance through the manxmusic.com website, which has links to most performers. Other artists who have produced CDs include Emma Christian ( – &quot;Beneath the Twilight&quot;), (voice, harp and recorder), and harpist and producer Charles Guard (&quot;Avenging and Bright&quot;), formerly an administrator at Culture Vannin. Many of the web entries about Manx music stem from Cliff McGann&#x27;s 1996 article which is now somewhat out of date.

==Early history==
Little can be determined about the character of music on the Isle of Man prior to the 15th century. There are many carved crosses from this era, but they depict a total of two musicians, one lur player and a harpist. Songs from this era may have had Scandinavian origins; some also bear similarities to Irish and Scottish music. The song (the Manx sword dance) is very similar to a lullaby from the Hebrides and is also said to have been a ritual dance during the Scandinavian era.

The earliest written evidence describes fiddle music and a variety of folk dances. There was no harp tradition as was otherwise prevalent in Celtic music. English folk songs were very popular, later including broadside ballads, jigs and reels. Also extant were traditional Gaelic psalm-singing and other church music.

According to Fenella Bazin, &quot;...[E]vidence from written sources shows that the Manx were enthusiastic dancers and musicians, often appearing in the ecclesiastical courts on charges on making music on Saturday nights or after church on Sundays.&quot; A traditional Manx melody is &quot;Mylecharane&quot; (The Manx National Air).

===Carvals===
In 1891, Manx antiquarian and folklorist Arthur William Moore published a collection of &quot;Manx Carols&quot;. The &quot;carval&quot; is related to the medieval English carol and sung to popular Manx tunes. These carols were formerly sung in the parish churches on Christmas Eve, or &quot;Oie&#x27;l Verrey&quot; (a corruption of Oie Feaill Voirrey (the eve of Mary&#x27;s Feast, i.e. Christmas Eve), as it was called. It was the custom for the people on this night to bring their own candles, so that the church was brilliantly illuminated. Decorations mainly consisted of branches of holly and festoons of ivy. After the prayers were read and a hymn sung, the parson usually went home, leaving the clerk in charge. Then each one who had a carol to sing would do so in turn, so that the proceedings were continued till a very late hour, and sometimes also became of a rather riotous character, as it was a custom for the female part of the congregation to provide themselves with peas, which they flung at their bachelor friends. On the way home a considerable proportion of the congregation would probably visit the nearest inn, where they would partake of the traditional drink on such occasions, viz. hot ale, flavoured with spice, ginger, and pepper. It was traditional to sing &quot;Arrane Oie Vie&quot; (Good-night Song) on the way home.
===Ballads===
The ballad &quot;Ushtey Millish &#x27;sy Garee&quot; relates to the old practice of summoning a jury of 24 men to decide questions connected with water-courses, boundaries, etc. and is dated to sometime prior to 1777. A &quot;bardoon&quot; was a locally composed song about the loss of a loved one at sea. &quot;Yn Chenn Dolphin&quot; (The Old Dolphin) is a tale about a shipwreck.

==19th century==
Church music is the most documented Manx music of the 19th century. Lining out was a common technique, as it was throughout Great Britain and Ireland. West gallery musicians performed for special occasions, using locally composed or well-known compositions. Organs were a later importation that became standard in most of the island&#x27;s churches. The first mention of an organ on the island is associated with St George&#x27;s church, Douglas in September 1781. The first collection of Manx church songs was printed in 1799, and was followed by many other collections, though it was not until the 1870s and 1880s that Manx music began to be published in any great quantity, as drawing-room ballads, religious songs, and choral arrangements all became popular. The proliferation of this music coincided with a boom in the tourism industry for the island, and Manx music-hall and dance-hall songs and dances saw increased demand. Manx language songs, in particular, benefited from the Gaelic revival from the 19th century onwards.

==20th century==
A notable musical episode in the Isle of Man was the imprisonment between 1940 and 1941 of many German musicians of Jewish extraction in Hutchinson Internment Camp on the island. These included Hans Gál (who composed there works for performance by the camp orchestra), Egon Wellesz, and Marjan Rawicz.

Though West Gallery music continued into the 1950s, by the 20th century instrumental music accompanied most worship on the Isle of Man. Later in the 20th century, Manx church musical traditions slowly declined. The legacy of immigration, from England and elsewhere, has brought in many new styles of music to the island.

Some of the last native Manx speakers, including Ned Maddrell, were recording singing traditional songs. In 1909, the Austrian ethnologist Rudolf Trebitsch made several recordings, as did the Irish Folklore Commission in 1948.
==Future==
Culture Vannin has a dedicated Manx Music Development Team comprising a Manx music specialist, who works with the island&#x27;s Department of Education, Sport and Culture to encourage the development of Manx music in the school curriculum, and a Manx Music Development Officer, who works to promote Manx music and dance in the wider community. CDs by bands, soloists and Gaelic choirs are produced.

==Manx Music Festival==
The Manx Music Festival is an annual music festival held at the end of each April in Douglas. It was founded in 1892 by the &quot;Mother of Manx Music&quot; M. L. Wood after music classes were included in the Fine Arts and Industrial Guild, after which the festival gets its colloquial name of &quot;The Guild&quot;. Local people and visitors are invited to take part in various singing, instrumental, drama and public speaking classes. At the close of the festival, winners of the individual voice categories compete to win the Cleveland Medal, first donated in 1923 by the Cleveland Manx Society. The first performance of the Manx National Anthem occurred at The Guild in 1907, accompanied by Harry Wood&#x27;s Orchestra.

==Special projects==
In November 2014 Culture Vannin, a government sponsored entity, brought together musicians from Norway and the Isle of Man to produce the Norwegian-Manx Collaboration featuring traditional music and providing an educational tour around the Isle of Man. The collaboration featured Manx musicians Tom Callister, Ruth Keggin and David Kilgallon, as well as Norwegian musicians Erlend Apneseth and Margit Myhr.

<text>HMAS &quot;Advance&quot; (P 83) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Constructed during 1967 and commissioned into the RAN in 1968, &quot;Advance&quot; operated from Darwin and patrolled northern Australian waters.

During her career, the patrol boat shadowed a Soviet trawler, survived Cyclone Tracy, was used for filming of the television series &quot;Patrol Boat&quot;, and participated in the RAN&#x27;s first anti-terrorism patrol of the North West Shelf. &quot;Advance&quot; was replaced in 1980, but continued to operate as a training ship until she was decommissioned in 1988.

&quot;Advance&quot; was donated to the Australian National Maritime Museum, which has maintained her in an operational condition.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, nine were ordered for the RAN, with another five for Papua New Guinea&#x27;s Australian-run coastal security force, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels. The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Advance&quot; was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland in March 1967, launched on 16 August 1967, and commissioned on 24 January 1968. It was the third ship of its class.

==Operational history==
&quot;Advance&quot; operated out of in Darwin, Northern Territory between 1968 and 1980. As well as the standard duties for her class, &quot;Advance&quot; was also used for surveillance, search-and-rescue, and hydrographic survey (in company with the survey ship ).

During 1968, &quot;Advance&quot; and sister ship shadowed the Soviet trawler &quot;Van Gogh&quot;, which operated in the Gulf of Carpentaria for two months.

&quot;Advance&quot; and three other patrol boats were in Darwin Harbour on 25 December 1974, when Cyclone Tracy hit. &quot;Advance&quot; and managed to escape serious damage, but &quot;Attack&quot; was forced aground and suffered hull damage, and collided with Stoke&#x27;s Hill Wharf and sank.

During 1975 and 1976, &quot;Advance&quot; regularly operated as part of Operation Trochus: a concentrated effort to respond to illegal fishing vessels in northern Australian waters.

From late 1977, the patrol boat was assigned to in Sydney for patrols along Australia&#x27;s eastern coast, but was redeployed elsewhere when necessary.

In 1979, &quot;Advance&quot; was one of two &quot;Attack&quot;-class vessels used to portray the fictional HMAS &quot;Ambush&quot;; setting of the ABC television series &quot;Patrol Boat&quot;.

Following her replacement by a in 1980, &quot;Advance&quot; was reassigned as a training ship. She was assigned to the Sydney Port Division of the Royal Australian Navy Reserve in February 1982.

The patrol boat participated in the 1986 Naval Review.

==Decommissioning and preservation==
&quot;Advance&quot; was decommissioned on 6 February 1988, and was transferred to the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM).

The patrol boat has been maintained in operational condition by the ANMM.

In October 2013 &quot;Advance&quot; participated in the International Fleet Review 2013 in Sydney, celebrating the centenary of the Royal Australian Navy.

<text>Johannes Stark (; 15 April 1874 – 21 June 1957) was a German physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1919 &quot;for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields&quot;. This phenomenon is known as the Stark effect.

Stark received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Munich in 1897 under the supervision of Eugen von Lommel, and served as Lommel&#x27;s assistant until his appointment as a lecturer at the University of Göttingen in 1900. He was an at Leibniz University Hannover from 1906 until he became a professor at RWTH Aachen University in 1909. In 1917, he became professor at the University of Greifswald, and he also worked at the University of Würzburg from 1920 to 1922.

A supporter of Adolf Hitler from 1924, Stark was one of the main figures, along with fellow Nobel laureate Philipp Lenard, in the anti-Semitic &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; movement, which sought to remove Jewish scientists from German physics. He was appointed head of the German Research Foundation in 1933 and was president of the Reich Physical-Technical Institute from 1933 to 1939. In 1947 he was found guilty as a &quot;Major Offender&quot; by a denazification court.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Born in Schickenhof, Kingdom of Bavaria (now Freihung), Stark was educated at Bayreuth Gymnasium (secondary school) and later in Regensburg. His collegiate education began at the University of Munich, where he studied physics, mathematics, chemistry, and crystallography. His tenure at that college began in 1894; he graduated in 1897, with his doctoral dissertation titled &quot;Untersuchung über einige physikalische, vorzüglich optische Eigenschaften des Rußes &quot; (Investigation of some physical, in particular optical properties of soot).

===Career===
Stark worked in various positions at the Physics Institute of his alma mater until 1900, when he became an unsalaried lecturer at the University of Göttingen. An extraordinary professor at Hannover by 1906, in 1908 he became professor at RWTH Aachen University. He worked and researched at physics departments of several universities, including the University of Greifswald, until 1922. In 1919, he won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his &quot;discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields&quot; (the latter is known as the Stark effect). From 1933 until his retirement in 1939, Stark was elected President of the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt, while also President of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

It was Stark who, as the editor of the &quot;Jahrbuch der Radioaktivität und Elektronik&quot;, asked in 1907, then still rather unknown, Albert Einstein to write a review article on the principle of relativity. Stark seemed impressed by relativity and Einstein&#x27;s earlier work when he quoted &quot;the principle of relativity formulated by H. A. Lorentz and A. Einstein&quot; and &quot;Planck&#x27;s relationship &quot;M&quot;0 = &quot;E&quot;0/&quot;c&quot;2&quot; in his 1907 paper in Physikalische Zeitschrift, where he used the equation &quot;e&quot;0 = &quot;m&quot;0&quot;c&quot;2 to calculate an &quot;elementary quantum of energy&quot;, i.e. the amount of energy related to the mass of an electron at rest. While working on his article, Einstein began a line of thought that would eventually lead to his general theory of relativity, which in turn became (after its confirmation) the start of Einstein&#x27;s worldwide fame. This is ironic, given Stark&#x27;s later work as an anti-Einstein and anti-relativity propagandist in the &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; movement.

Stark published more than 300 papers, mainly regarding electricity and other such topics. He received various awards, including the Nobel Prize, the Baumgartner Prize of the Vienna Academy of Sciences (1910), the Vahlbruch Prize of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences (1914), and the Matteucci Medal of the Rome Academy. Probably his best known contribution to the field of physics is the Stark effect, which he discovered in 1913. In 1970 the International Astronomical Union honored him with a crater on the far-side of the Moon, without knowing about his Nazi activities. The name was dropped on August 12, 2020.

He married Luise Uepler, and they had five children. His hobbies were the cultivation of fruit trees and forestry. He worked in his private laboratory, which he set up using his Nobel prize money, on his country estate in Upper Bavaria after the second world war. There he studied the deflection of light in an electric field.

===Affiliation with Nazism===
From 1924 onwards, Stark supported Hitler. During the Nazi regime, Stark attempted to become the Führer of German physics through the &quot;Deutsche Physik&quot; (&quot;German physics&quot;) movement (along with fellow Nobel laureate Philipp Lenard) against the &quot;Jewish physics&quot; of Albert Einstein and Werner Heisenberg (who was not Jewish). After Werner Heisenberg defended Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity, Stark wrote an angry article in the official SS newspaper &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot;, calling Heisenberg a &quot;White Jew&quot;.

On August 21, 1934, Stark wrote to physicist and fellow Nobel laureate Max von Laue, telling him to toe the party line or suffer the consequences. The letter was signed off with &quot;Heil Hitler.&quot;

In his 1934 book &quot;Nationalsozialismus und Wissenschaft&quot; (English: &quot;National Socialism and Science&quot;) Stark maintained that the priority of the scientist was to serve the nation—thus, the important fields of research were those that could help German arms production and industry. He attacked theoretical physics as &quot;Jewish&quot; and stressed that scientific positions in Nazi Germany should only be held by pure-blooded Germans.

Writing in &quot;Das Schwarze Korps&quot;, Stark argued that even if racial antisemitism were to triumph, it would only be a &#x27;partial victory&#x27; if &#x27;Jewish&#x27; ideas were not similarly defeated: &quot;We also have to eradicate the Jewish spirit, whose blood can flow just as undisturbed today as before if its carriers hold beautiful Aryan passes&quot;.

In 1947, following the defeat of Germany in World War II, Stark was classified as a &quot;Major Offender&quot; and received a sentence of four years&#x27; imprisonment (later suspended) by a denazification court.

===Later life and death===

Stark spent the last years of his life on his Gut Eppenstatt near Traunstein in Upper Bavaria, where he died in 1957 at the age of 83. He was buried in Schönau am Königssee in the mountain cemetery.

<text>HMAS &quot;Aitape&quot; (P 84) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). It was named for the small town of Aitape, Sandaun Province, Papua New Guinea. Completed in 1967, the vessel was one of five assigned to the RAN&#x27;s Papua New Guinea (PNG) Division. The patrol boat was transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force in 1974 as HMPNGS &quot;Aitape&quot;. She remained active until 1982, when she was removed from service for use as a parts hulk. &quot;Aitape&quot; was scuttled off Port Moresby for use as a dive wreck in 1995.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Attack&quot; class was ordered in 1964 to operate in Australian waters as patrol boats (based on lessons learned through using the s on patrols of Borneo during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation), and to replace a variety of old patrol, search-and-rescue, and general-purpose craft. Initially, fourteen were ordered for the RAN, five of which were intended for the Papua New Guinea Division of the RAN, although another six ships were ordered to bring the class to twenty vessels.

The patrol boats had a displacement of 100 tons at standard load and 146 tons at full load, were in length overall, had a beam of , and draughts of at standard load, and at full load. Propulsion machinery consisted of two 16-cylinder Paxman YJCM diesel engines, which supplied to the two propellers. The vessels could achieve a top speed of , and had a range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of three officers and sixteen sailors. Main armament was a bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm gun, supplemented by two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns and various small arms. The ships were designed with as many commercial components as possible: the &quot;Attack&quot;s were to operate in remote regions of Australia and New Guinea, and a town&#x27;s hardware store would be more accessible than home base in a mechanical emergency.

&quot;Aitape&quot; was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland, launched on 6 July 1967 by Mrs. Paliau Maloat, the wife of the a Manus leader and politician, and commissioned on 13 November 1967, four days before lead ship .

==Operational history==
&quot;Aitape&quot; undertook sea trials with sister ship &quot;Attack&quot; off Sydney, before heading for Papua New Guinea and arriving at the RAN base at Los Negros Island, Manus Province on 3 January 1968. Primary roles of the new patrol boats were fisheries protection and sea training, but also undertook search and rescue, medical evacuation and monitoring of navigational aids roles. The ship&#x27;s company was made up of both Australian and PNG servicemen. Prior to the arrival of the &quot;Attack&quot;-class patrol boats, surveillance of PNG waters was conducted by small coastal craft and occasional visits by larger RAN warships, but the PNG Division was now able to chase and apprehend vessels suspected of illegal fishing.

&quot;Aitape&quot; was one of the five &quot;Attack&quot;-class patrol boats of the RAN PNG Division transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force&#x27;s (PNGDF) Maritime Element on 14 November 1974 when the PNGDF took over maritime functions from the RAN. They formed the PNGDF Patrol Boat Squadron based at Manus. She served until 1982, when she was paid off to act as a source of spares for the other &quot;Attack&quot;-class patrol boats in PNGDF service. In 1995, she was sunk in shallow waters as dive wreck south east of Port Moresby.

<text>The kit fox (Vulpes macrotis) is a fox species that inhabits arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern and central Mexico. These foxes are the smallest of the four species of &quot;Vulpes&quot; occurring in North America and are among the smallest of the vulpines worldwide. It has also been called a North American counterpart of the fennec fox due to its large ears.

==Taxonomy==
Some mammalogists classify it as conspecific with the swift fox, &quot;V. velox&quot;, but molecular systematics indicate that the two species are distinct.
Interbreeding between the two species does occur where their ranges overlap (eastern New Mexico and western Texas), but this hybridization is quite restricted in scope.

Subspecific designations for the species are not fully addressed. As many as eight subspecies have been recognized, although further analyzes have not found support for any subspecies differentiation. However, although there is a clear need for more subspecific clarification, most available data suggest that kit foxes in the San Joaquin Valley of California are likely to warrant a subspecific designation, &quot;V. m. mutica&quot;, due to geographical isolation, and that any other kit foxes may be included in a second subspecies, &quot;V. m. macrotis&quot;.

===Subspecies===
The endangered San Joaquin kit fox (&quot;Vulpes macrotis mutica&quot;) was formerly very common in the San Joaquin Valley and through much of Central California. Its 1990 population was estimated to be 7,000. This subspecies is still endangered, after nearly 50 years of being on the Endangered Species List. Officially, this subspecies was listed March 3, 1967. On September 26, 2007, Wildlands Inc. announced the designation of the 684 acre (277 ha) Deadman Creek Conservation Bank, which is intended specifically to protect habitat of the San Joaquin kit fox. However, the population continues to decline mostly due to heavy habitat loss. Other factors include competition from red foxes and the extermination of the wolf from California, which has left the coyote as the dominant meso-predator in kit fox territory, bringing an imbalance in ecosystem relationships.

==Appearance==
The kit fox is one of the smallest species of the family Canidae found in North America. This species exhibits little sexual dimorphism, with the male being slightly larger. The average species weight is between . The body length is , with a long tail (about 40% of total length), adding another . It has large ears, between , that help the fox dissipate heat and give it exceptional hearing (much like those of the fennec fox). 

The color and texture of the coat vary geographically. In general, the dorsal color is grizzled or yellowish-gray. The grizzled appearance is the result of guard hairs that are typically black-tipped or with two black bands separated by a white band. The guard hairs are less than long, and particularly prominent in the middle of the back. The soles of the legs are protected by stiff tufts of hair, a trait that improves traction on loose sandy surfaces as well as protection against extreme temperatures; muzzles and vibrissae are generally black to brown. The tail is bushy and gray, with a black tip, and the caudal gland has a pronounced black spot. Unlike the gray fox, it has no stripe along the length of its tail. Its color ranges from yellow to gray, and the back is usually darker than the majority of its coat; its belly and inner ears are usually lighter. It has distinct dark patches around the nose. The ears are tan or gray on the back, turning to buff or orange at the base. The shoulders, the lower sides, the flanks, and the strip about 25 mm wide across the chest range in color from buffy to orange.

==Distribution and habitat==
The northernmost part of its range is the arid interior of Oregon. Its eastern limit is southwestern Colorado. It can be found south through Nevada, Utah, southeastern California, Arizona, New Mexico, and into western Texas.

Kit foxes inhabit arid and semi-arid regions encompassing desert scrub, chaparral, halophytic regions, and grasslands. Generally, areas with sparse ground cover are favored. Vegetation habitats vary with the regional fauna, but some examples are sagebrush &quot;Artemisia tridentata&quot; and saltbrush &quot;Atriplex polycarpa&quot;. Loose textured soils may be prioritized for denning. Kit Foxes can also be found in agricultural areas, in particular orchards, on a small basis, and can even inhabit urban areas. They are found at elevations of above sea level.

==Behavior==

Kit foxes are mostly nocturnal and sometimes crepuscular; they escape heat stress during the day by resting in underground dens. Kit foxes normally forage on their own. Kit foxes are not exceptionally territorial, preferring to live in pairs or small groups of relatives.

Dens are used during the year for daytime resting, escaping predators, avoiding extreme heat, preserving moisture, and carrying and rearing young. Kit Foxes will dig their own dens, but they can also modify and use the burrows of badgers, ground squirrels, prairie dogs, and kangaroo rats. Dens are spread across the home range, and an individual fox usually uses more than 11 dens in a given year. They normally rest in their dens during the day, but sometimes can emerge to bask and, when pups are young, to play.

In comparison to many canids that pant only at the resonant frequency of the thorax, kit foxes pant at a rate proportional to the ambient temperature before the rate exceeds the resonant frequency. In doing so, kit foxes exercise the economics of water at the cost of energy. The apparent speed of kit foxes is essentially an illusion created by their limited size and cryptic coloration, and their incredible ability to evade and change directions. An accurate account clocked a fox kit at around 40 km/h in front of the car, but the fox was easily exhausted.

==Diet==
Kit foxes are opportunistic omnivores and scavengers, possibly regulated by prey abundance, but primarily carnivorous. In the Californian deserts, its primary prey is Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rat (&quot;Dipodomys merriami&quot;). Other common prey species include lagomorphs, rodents and insects. Kit foxes also consume birds, reptiles, carrion, fish, and rarely, plant material, such as tomatoes (&quot;Lycopersicon esculentum&quot;), cactus fruits (&quot;Carnegiea gigantea&quot;) and other fruits. Different kit fox families can occupy the same hunting grounds, but do not generally go hunting at the same time. Kit foxes are also known to cache food and eat human food. Black-tailed jackrabbits represent the upper size limit of prey.

==Mating and reproduction==
The kit fox is a socially monogamous species, and the mated pair remains together throughout the year. However, polygamous mating relationships have been observed. Female foxes begin searching for natal dens in September and October and usually usable dens are visited and cleaned of debris before the final selection is made. No nest as such is built, but new entrances and tunnels can be added to the den. As with most canids, copulation ends with a &quot;tie&quot; during which the penis is locked in the female&#x27;s vagina. 

Females are monoestrous. Male and female kit foxes usually establish mating pairs during October and November, and they mate from December to January-February. Gestation lasts probably around 49–56 days, and the litters are born in February or March; litter size is usually four or five, and the sex ratio is roughly even. They do not emerge from the den until they are at least four weeks old, and are weaned after about eight weeks and become independent at five to six months old. They become sexually mature at 10 months. Both parents take part in raising and protecting their young. Pups emerge from the den at about one month of age and spend several hours each day playing outside the entrance. The male seems to do most of the hunting during this period, and later, both parents provide food until the pups start to forage with them at three to four months of age.

Survival and mortality rates of kit foxes can vary significantly year to year. In captivity, they have lived 10 to 12 years; while the average lifespan of a wild kit fox is 5.5 years. One Californian study of 144 kit fox pups showed a 74% mortality rate in pups within the first year.

<doc id="432273" wikidata="Q1142558" url="?curid=432273" title="Yomi">
<text>is the Japanese word for the land of the dead (World of Darkness). According to Shinto mythology as related in &quot;Kojiki&quot;, this is where the dead go in the afterlife. Once one has eaten at the hearth of Yomi it is (mostly) impossible to return to the land of the living. Yomi is most commonly known for Izanami&#x27;s retreat to that place after her death. Izanagi followed her there and upon his return he washed himself, creating Amaterasu, Susanoo, and Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto in the process.

This realm of the dead geographical continuity with this world and certainly cannot be thought of as a paradise to which one would aspire, nor can it appropriately be described as a hell in which one suffers retribution for past deeds; rather, all deceased carry on a gloomy and shadowy existence in perpetuity, regardless of their behavior in life. Scholars believe that the image of Yomi was derived from ancient Japanese tombs in which corpses were left for some time to decompose.

The kanji that are sometimes used to transcribe &quot;Yomi&quot; actually refer to the mythological Chinese realm of the dead called Diyu or Huángquán (, lit. &quot;Yellow Springs&quot;), which appears in Chinese texts as early as the eighth century BCE. This dark and vaguely defined realm was believed to be located beneath the earth, but it was not until the Han dynasty that the Chinese had a clearly articulated conception of an underworld below in contrast with a heavenly realm above. The characters are &quot;jukujikun&quot;, i.e. were used without regard to the actual meaning of the word Yomi, which is unknown. With regard to Japanese mythology, Yomi is generally taken by commentators to lie beneath the earth and is part of a triad of locations discussed in Kojiki: , , and or . Yomi has also often been associated with the mythological realm of , also known as .

Yomi is ruled over by Izanami no Mikoto, the Grand Deity of Yomi (&quot;Yomo-tsu-Ōkami&quot; ). According to Kojiki, the entrance to Yomi lies in Izumo province and was sealed off by Izanagi upon his flight from Yomi, at which time he permanently blocked the entrance by placing a massive boulder (&quot;Chigaeshi no ōkami&quot; ) at the base of the slope that leads to Yomi (&quot;Yomotsu Hirasaka&quot; or ). Upon his return to Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni, Izanagi noted that Yomi is a &quot;polluted land&quot; (&quot;kegareki kuni&quot;). This opinion reflects the traditional Shinto association between death and pollution (&quot;kegare&quot;). Later Susanoo takes this position over.

==Christian uses==
Some Japanese Christian texts use to refer to what is called Hell in the English versions. For example, ,

Sometimes means Hades or Sheol, whereas means Gehenna.

<doc id="432276" wikidata="Q1777915" url="?curid=432276" title="Brownian ratchet">
<text>In the philosophy of thermal and statistical physics, the Brownian ratchet or Feynman–Smoluchowski ratchet is an apparent perpetual motion machine of the second kind (converting thermal energy into mechanical work), first analysed in 1912 as a thought experiment by Polish physicist Marian Smoluchowski. It was popularised by American Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman in a physics lecture at the California Institute of Technology on May 11, 1962, during his Messenger Lectures series The Character of Physical Law in Cornell University in 1964 and in his text &quot;The Feynman Lectures on Physics&quot; as an illustration of the laws of thermodynamics. The simple machine, consisting of a tiny paddle wheel and a ratchet, appears to be an example of a Maxwell&#x27;s demon, able to extract mechanical work from random fluctuations (heat) in a system at thermal equilibrium, in violation of the second law of thermodynamics. Detailed analysis by Feynman and others showed why it cannot actually do this.

==The machine==
The device consists of a gear known as a ratchet that rotates freely in one direction but is prevented from rotating in the opposite direction by a pawl. The ratchet is connected by an axle to a paddle wheel that is immersed in a fluid of molecules at temperature formula_1. The molecules constitute a heat bath in that they undergo random Brownian motion with a mean kinetic energy that is determined by the temperature. The device is imagined as being small enough that the impulse from a single molecular collision can turn the paddle. Although such collisions would tend to turn the rod in either direction with equal probability, the pawl allows the ratchet to rotate in one direction only. The net effect of many such random collisions would seem to be that the ratchet rotates continuously in that direction. The ratchet&#x27;s motion then can be used to do work on other systems, for example lifting a weight (&quot;m&quot;) against gravity. The energy necessary to do this work apparently would come from the heat bath, without any heat gradient (i.e. the motion leeches energy from the temperature of the air). Were such a machine to work successfully, its operation would violate the second law of thermodynamics, one form of which states: &quot;It is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work.&quot;

==Why it fails==
Although at first sight the Brownian ratchet seems to extract useful work from Brownian motion, Feynman demonstrated that if the entire device is at the same temperature, the ratchet will not rotate continuously in one direction but will move randomly back and forth, and therefore will not produce any useful work. The reason is that since the pawl is at the same temperature as the paddle, it will also undergo Brownian motion, &quot;bouncing&quot; up and down. It therefore will intermittently fail by allowing a ratchet tooth to slip backward under the pawl while it is up. Another issue is that when the pawl rests on the sloping face of the tooth, the spring which returns the pawl exerts a sideways force on the tooth which tends to rotate the ratchet in a backwards direction. Feynman demonstrated that if the temperature formula_2 of the ratchet and pawl is the same as the temperature formula_1 of the paddle, then the failure rate must equal the rate at which the ratchet ratchets forward, so that no net motion results over long enough periods or in an ensemble averaged sense. A simple but rigorous proof that no net motion occurs no matter what shape the teeth are was given by Magnasco. 

If, on the other hand, formula_2 is less than formula_1, the ratchet will indeed move forward, and produce useful work. In this case, though, the energy is extracted from the temperature gradient between the two thermal reservoirs, and some waste heat is exhausted into the lower temperature reservoir by the pawl. In other words, the device functions as a miniature heat engine, in compliance with the second law of thermodynamics. Conversely, if formula_2 is greater than formula_1, the device will rotate in the opposite direction.

The Feynman ratchet model led to the similar concept of Brownian motors, nanomachines which can extract useful work not from thermal noise but from chemical potentials and other microscopic nonequilibrium sources, in compliance with the laws of thermodynamics. Diodes are an electrical analog of the ratchet and pawl, and for the same reason cannot produce useful work by rectifying Johnson noise in a circuit at uniform temperature.

Millonas 
as well as Mahato 
extended the same notion to correlation ratchets driven by mean-zero (unbiased) nonequilibrium noise with a 
nonvanishing correlation function of odd order greater than one.

==History==
The ratchet and pawl was first discussed as a Second Law-violating device by Gabriel Lippmann in 1900. In 1912, Polish physicist Marian Smoluchowski gave the first correct qualitative explanation of why the device fails; thermal motion of the pawl allows the ratchet&#x27;s teeth to slip backwards. Feynman did the first quantitative analysis of the device in 1962 using the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, showing that if the temperature of the paddle &quot;T1&quot; was greater than the temperature of the ratchet &quot;T2&quot;, it would function as a heat engine, but if &quot;T1&quot; = &quot;T2&quot; there would be no net motion of the paddle. In 1996, Juan Parrondo and Pep Español used a variation of the above device in which no ratchet is present, only two paddles, to show that the axle connecting the paddles and ratchet conducts heat between reservoirs; they argued that although Feynman&#x27;s conclusion was correct, his analysis was flawed because of his erroneous use of the quasistatic approximation, resulting in incorrect equations for efficiency. Magnasco and Stolovitzky (1998) extended this analysis to consider the full ratchet device, and showed that the power output of the device is far smaller than the Carnot efficiency claimed by Feynman. A paper in 2000 by Derek Abbott, Bruce R. Davis and Juan Parrondo, reanalyzed the problem and extended it to the case of multiple ratchets, showing a link with Parrondo&#x27;s paradox.

Léon Brillouin in 1950 discussed an electrical circuit analogue that uses a rectifier (such as a diode) instead of a ratchet. The idea was the diode would rectify the Johnson noise thermal current fluctuations produced by the resistor, generating a direct current which could be used to perform work. In the detailed analysis it was shown that the thermal fluctuations within the diode generate an electromotive force that cancels the voltage from rectified current fluctuations. Therefore, just as with the ratchet, the circuit will produce no useful energy if all the components are at thermal equilibrium (at the same temperature); a DC current will be produced only when the diode is at a lower temperature than the resistor.

==Granular gas==
Researchers from the University of Twente, the University of Patras in Greece, and the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter have constructed a Feynman–Smoluchowski engine which, when not in thermal equilibrium, converts pseudo-Brownian motion into work by means of a granular gas, which is a conglomeration of solid particles vibrated with such vigour that the system assumes a gas-like state. The constructed engine consisted of four vanes which were allowed to rotate freely in a vibrofluidized granular gas. Because the ratchet&#x27;s gear and pawl mechanism, as described above, permitted the axle to rotate only in one direction, random collisions with the moving beads caused the vane to rotate. This seems to contradict Feynman&#x27;s hypothesis. However, this system is not in perfect thermal equilibrium: energy is constantly being supplied to maintain the fluid motion of the beads. Vigorous vibrations on top of a shaking device mimic the nature of a molecular gas. Unlike an ideal gas, though, in which tiny particles move constantly, stopping the shaking would simply cause the beads to drop. In the experiment, this necessary out-of-equilibrium environment was thus maintained. Work was not immediately being done, though; the ratchet effect only commenced beyond a critical shaking strength. For very strong shaking, the vanes of the paddle wheel interacted with the gas, forming a convection roll, sustaining their rotation.

<doc id="432282" wikidata="Q2424036" url="?curid=432282" title="History of the British 1st Division (1809–1909)">
<text>The 1st Division is an infantry division of the British Army that has been formed and disestablished numerous times since 1809 and is still currently active as the 1st (United Kingdom) Division. Lieutenant-General Arthur Wellesley raised the division for service in the Peninsular War, which was part of the Coalition Wars of the Napoleonic Wars. The division was disestablished in 1814 but reformed the following year for service in the War of the Seventh Coalition. It then fought at the Battle of Waterloo, where it repulsed numerous attacks, including the final attack of the day that was launched by the French Imperial Guard. Following the battle, the division marched into France and became part of the Army of Occupation before being disbanded a few years later.

During the mid-to late-19th century, several formations bearing the name 1st Division were formed. According to the current division&#x27;s official website, three such formations form part of its lineage. The first was formed in 1854 in Ottoman Bulgaria and took part in the Battle of Inkerman and the Siege of Sevastopol as part of the Crimean War; and was disbanded after the end of hostilities. in Africa in 1879, a new division was formed for service in the Anglo-Zulu War but made little impact on the campaign and was again disbanded once fighting ended. The final division to bear the name was formed in 1899 when the Second Boer War broke out. The division was raised in England, sailed to southern Africa, and then fought in most of the major battles to lift the Siege of Kimberley. These battles saw high casualties and were a mix of victories and defeats, and the division&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Magersfontein contributed to the political crisis of Black Week. The division saw more success in 1900 but was ultimately disbanded as the British Army reacted to the end of conventional warfare and moved to combat the guerrilla tactics adopted by the Boers.

While all of the earlier formations to bear the name were raised for a particular war, a new, permanent 1st Division was formed in 1902 in the UK. It fought in the First and the Second World Wars, was converted into the 1st Armoured Division in the 1970s, fought in the Gulf War, and was renamed the 1st (United Kingdom) Division in 2014.

==Napoleonic Wars==
===Peninsular War===
During the French Revolutionary Wars and early in the Napoleonic Wars, the brigade was largest organised formation used by the British Army during campaigns. These consisted of two or more battalions grouped together under the command of a major-general, and suited the small size of the army and the operations it conducted. When needed, larger forces were assembled on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis; these included multiple brigades that were grouped into &quot;lines&quot; or &quot;columns&quot;. As the army and its operations grew, it implemented divisions—a single formation of two or more brigades that was usually commanded by a lieutenant-general. The division concept was not new and had been used by other European armies towards the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763). On 18 June 1809, Lieutenant-General Arthur Wellesley (later known as the Duke of Wellington), commander of British forces in Spain and Portugal during the Peninsular War, reorganised his force into four divisions—the 1st, the 2nd, the 3rd, and the 4th.

On formation, the division consisted of one brigade of Foot Guards, one brigade of British line infantry, and two brigades of troops from the King&#x27;s German Legion (KGL). Due to the inclusion of guardsmen, the division was considered a social but not a military elite and was nicknamed &quot;The Gentlemen&#x27;s Sons&quot;. The division of almost 6,000 men first saw action at the Battle of Talavera, where it formed the core of the Anglo-Portuguese Army. A brief action on 27 July 1809 resulted in 188 casualties but the main engagement of the battle took place the following day. Under intense French artillery fire, the 1st was approached by two divisions totalling 15,000 men. The British-German troops had been instructed to hold fire until the French were within close range, to deliver one volley, and then charge. Charles Oman, a historian of the Peninsular War, wrote the division followed these orders and that the leading French ranks &quot;went down in swathes&quot;, with casualties amounting to one-third of the French force within ten minutes. The division then recklessly charged after the routed troops and ran straight into the French second line, which rebuked the British and German troops, forcing them to conduct a fighting retreat back to the main Allied position. Redeployed British forces ensured the division was not routed and the line held. By the end of the battle, the 1st had suffered 2,249 casualties.

The next engagement was at the Battle of Bussaco on 27 September 1810, where the 1st Division suffered 141 casualties. This was followed by a general retreat to the Lines of Torres Vedras and skirmishes during the Battle of Sobral. The following year, 828 casualties were suffered at the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro (3–5 May 1811). In early 1812, the division took part in the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo and then on 22 July fought in the Battle of Salamanca, where it formed the left wing of the army and defended the village of Arapiles. Back-and-forth fighting took place for control of the village, which resulted in 158 casualties. In September 1812, the division invested the castle at Burgos. Over the next four weeks, it repulsed several French sorties and launched two failed assaults with heavy losses. By the end of the unsuccessful siege, close to 2,000 casualties had been suffered. A general retreat from Burgos followed, during which the commanding officer Edward Paget was captured. His replacement, William Stewart, delayed part of the retreat when he ignored orders issued by Wellington.

In May 1813, a new campaign was launched. After a march north through Portugal, the Allied Army again entered Spain. The following month, the 1st Division fought in a series of battles; San Millan-Osma, Vittoria, and Tolosa, and was present during the opening days of the Siege of San Sebastián in July. In August, the division sent around 400 volunteers to assist in the storming of San Sebastián, with nearly half becoming casualties. The invasion of France followed; the division saw action at the Battle of the Bidassoa in October; it forded the Bidasoa River, pushed back the French defenders, and seized the village of Béhobie with around 160 casualties. Engagements at the Battle of Nivelle in November cost it 193 casualties, and the Battle of the Nive in December brought about a further 289 casualties. After a brief rest, the division forced the Adour in February 1814. Napoleon, Emperor of the French, had abdicated following the 1814 capture of Paris on 31 March while the 1st Division was besieging Bayonne. On 14 April, the French sortied and the division fought in the final battle of the War of the Sixth Coalition, suffering just over 700 casualties. With the war over, the formation was broken up along with the remainder of the army&#x27;s divisions. The troops marched to Bordeaux, from where they either returned to the UK or were transported to North America to take part in the ongoing War of 1812.

===Waterloo campaign===
At the end of the fighting, British and Hanoverian troops moved into the Southern Netherlands—previously Austrian Netherlands—as part of an Anglo-Dutch effort to secure the territory while they awaited a political outcome to the war at the Congress of Vienna. On 11 April 1815, after the outbreak of the War of the Seventh Coalition upon Napoleon&#x27;s return to power and the arrival of Allied reinforcements, the force in the Southern Netherlands was reorganised into divisions. The 1st Division was reformed under Major-General George Cooke and contained four foot-guard battalions, including one that had served with the division during the Peninsular War. The First British Brigade under Major-General Peregrine Maitland contained the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 1st Regiment of Foot Guards; and the Second British Brigade, under Major-General John Byng, contained the 2nd Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of Foot Guards. The division was the only one within Wellington&#x27;s new army that was composed entirely of British infantry, the other British formations included Hanoverian troops.

The 1st Division&#x27;s first action of the new war came at the Battle of Quatre Bras. Arriving on the right flank at around 18:30 on 16 June 1815, by which point fighting had been ongoing for several hours, the division launched a counterattack to recapture Bossu Wood that had just been taken. The attack drove out the French but as the British troops advanced beyond the wood, they were repulsed by a second French line and forced back. Fighting continued in and around the woods and included the repulse of a French cavalry attack. Casualties reported for the period 16–17 June amounted to 46 men killed and 508 wounded. Two days later at the Battle of Waterloo, the division formed the right flank of the allied army&#x27;s front line. Its four battalions were arranged on the reverse slope of the ridge that had been occupied by the Allied army. Their light infantry companies—alongside Hanoverian and Nassau troops—took up an advanced position at Hougomont, a walled farm complex within a wooded area that lay in front of the occupied ridge. The farmhouse and its surrounding area became a vital tactical location.

In the late morning, Napoleon ordered the farm complex and its environs to be captured, beginning the battle. As French troops moved forward, the guns of the 1st Division opened fire and checked several advances. They were not able to completely halt the French, who advanced into the woods and drove the division&#x27;s infantry back into the farm complex. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, leading a group of French troops, used an axe to breach the gates, allowing a large number of French troops to enter the complex&#x27;s courtyard. In the following melee, the gates were closed despite the efforts of additional French troops to enter, trapping those within—all of whom were eventually killed in hand-to-hand fighting or were shot by defenders within the buildings. Lieutenant-Colonel James Macdonell and Corporal James Graham were noted for their efforts. As the fighting around the farm continued, Byng&#x27;s brigade was fully committed to the defence. French troops attempted to encircle Hougomont and attack from the rear. The division&#x27;s guns again caused the French problems and fresh infantry were moved to check the French moves. An attempt to assault and scale the complex&#x27;s northern wall and to open the gate from the inside was repulsed. French artillery fire was maintained throughout the day, causing damage to the walls, setting several buildings ablaze, and collapsing the main building&#x27;s roof. A renewed attack in the late afternoon was also driven off. The final main French assault of the day, which was launched in the evening, was led by skirmishers who engaged with the Hougomont garrison while the main assault pushed past the area to the Allied-held ridge. Following the defeat of the French units, the Allied army conducted a general advance and poured into the Hougomont area to reinforce and clear the position.

Maitland&#x27;s brigade, while based on the crest of the ridge, spent the entire day under heavy French cannon fire, and repulsed several attacks by cavalry and infantry. Around 19:00, the Middle Guard of the Imperial Guard launched the final French attack of the day. In preparation, Maitland&#x27;s brigade was formed into a four-ranks-deep line and was ordered to lie down. The French attack, due to the disorganised manner in which the troops assembled, came in several waves. The 3rd and 4th Régiment de Chasseurs led under heavy cannon fire that diminished as they closed on the ridge, due to dwindling ammunition stocks. Wellington then reportedly shouted, &quot;Up, Guards, make ready!&quot;. The sudden appearance of the brigade caused the French to halt and start to deploy to exchange volleys. Maitland&#x27;s two battalions heavily engaged the 4th Chasseurs and forced them to retreat. The British Guards followed with a bayonet charge. The sight of these two events, in conjunction with being under heavy attack themselves, resulted in the 3rd Chasseurs also retreating. The next wave was led by the 3rd Régiment de Grenadiers, who were joined by other Middle Guard units and regular French infantry. Maitland&#x27;s troops halted their chase of the Chasseurs and reformed. Both sides then engaged in a ferocious exchange of volleys. While the French were concentrated on Maitland&#x27;s men, the British 2nd Division conducted a flanking manoeuvre, fired close-range volleys at the French, and charged, causing them to retreat.

During the battle, the division suffered 232 killed and 819 wounded, and four men were reported missing. The following day, in conjunction with the rest of the army, the division marched into France and arrived on the outskirts of Paris on 1 July. The French capitulated a short while later, ending the war. The 1st Division was chosen to form part of the Army of Occupation and remained in France until December 1818. It was disbanded when the British military withdrew from France and returned to the UK.

==Victorian era==
According to the 1st Division&#x27;s official website, its lineage includes the Peninsular War, the Battle of Waterloo, the Crimean War, the Anglo-Zulu War, and the Second Boer War. Other 1st Divisions were raised during the 19th century, each on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis. A 1st Division was raised in 1851 under Major-General Henry Somerset, during the Eighth Xhosa War. In 1857, an expeditionary force was formed from the Indian Army for service in the Second Opium War. The force contained a 1st Division, which was under the command of Major-General John Michel. Major-General Charles Staveley took command of a 1st Division, which was around 10,000 men strong and was formed in September 1871 solely for training manoeuvres in England. During the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, Lieutenant-General George Willis commanded another newly established 1st Division.

===Crimean War===

On 28 March 1854, in support of the Ottoman Empire, the British and the Second French Empire declared war on the Russian Empire. Anglo-French forces landed at Gallipoli to be in a position to defend Constantinople if needed, and then moved to Varna on the Black Sea coast of Ottoman Bulgaria, where they were reorganised into divisions. Prince George, Duke of Cambridge was appointed to command the 1st Division. Clive Ponting, a historian of the conflict, wrote Cambridge &quot;was chosen ... solely because he was Queen Victoria&#x27;s cousin&quot;. On 14 September, the Anglo-French expeditionary landed north of Sevastopol on the Crimean peninsula. They marched south and encountered the Russians at the Alma River, which blocked further progress. During the afternoon of 20 September, on the left wing of the expeditionary force, the division saw action in the Battle of the Alma. It crossed the river, then attacked and cleared a Russian redoubt on Kourgané Hill suffering 439 casualties. The advance resumed on 23 September and the expeditionary force surrounded the Russian port in October, beginning the Siege of Sevastopol.

In October, at the Battle of Balaclava, the 1st Division moved from besieging Sevastopol to reinforce British forces in the Balaclava area due to a Russian buildup of troops. Delays in the arrival of additional infantry and a changing tactical situation resulted in the division not engaging Russian forces, and the Charge of the Light Brigade was ordered. Following the ill-fated cavalry charge, it was decided not to commit the infantry to assault Russian positions. If they were captured, the positions would have needed to be occupied by the division and it could have invoked unwanted additional Russian attacks in the area whereas the division was more needed around Sevastopol. On 5 November, the Russian Army launched a major attack known as the Battle of Inkerman. The 1st Division, containing three battalions after leaving half of its force to defend Balaclava, moved to reinforce the embattled 2nd Division. In a heavy mist, the Russian force was engaged in close-range fighting with bayonets. Throughout the morning, 582 men of the division were killed or wounded or reported missing. During the fighting, the Duke of Cambridge had his horse shot from under him and he retired from the battle. Although the battle ended in an Allied victory, it created conditions that lengthened the siege through the winter into 1855. In 1855, the Light and the 2nd Divisions saw most of the fighting. During the assault on Sevastopol in June, the 1st Division was tasked in a supporting role, and it was held in reserve in September during the Battle of the Great Redan. The expeditionary force remained in the Crimea until the war ended in 1856, after which the army demobilised.

===1870s===
Following the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), the British Army reviewed and attempted to implement an organisation similar to that used by the Prussian Army. The resulting 1875 mobilisation scheme called for 24 divisions spread across eight army corps. These formations did not exist and the scheme looked for scattered units to merge in a time of crisis. This method was used to form three divisions, including the 1st, in 1871 when regular, reserve, militia, and yeomanry units—as well as volunteers from across the UK—converged on Aldershot, Hampshire, for training.

In January 1879, the Anglo-Zulu War broke out; over the following three months, back-and-forth fighting included the battles of Isandlwana and Rorke&#x27;s Drift. Reinforcements were dispatched to Natal to prepare for a second invasion of Zululand, which resulted in the formation of two divisions. No. 1 Division consisted of British, colonial, and African troops, and was 9,215 men strong. The division made a slow advance into Zululand along the coastal plain, established forts and improved infrastructure as it moved, and was not engaged in combat. At the close of the campaign, the division was near Port Durnford on the uMlalazi River and accepted the surrender of neighbouring Zulus. With the war over, the division was broken up in July. Frances Colenso, who wrote about the campaign, stated: &quot;An earlier advance and a little dash would have given the laurels of the second campaign to the 1st Division ... but it was not to be&quot;. According to Craig Stockings, Lieutenant-General Garnet Wolseley, who had arrived to oversee the final stage of the campaign, considered the division to have been &quot;entirely irrelevant&quot;.

===Second Boer War===
The Second Boer War broke out on 11 October 1899 after tensions arose between the British Empire, the South African Republic, and the Orange Free State. In response, and to reinforce the British military presence in southern Africa, the British Government mobilised the Natal Field Force in the UK. This force, also known as the First Army Corps, corresponded with the I Corps of the 1875 mobilisation scheme, and included the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Divisions. On mobilisation, the 1st Division consisted of the 1st—which was later dubbed the Guards Brigade—and the 2nd Infantry Brigades. The command was given to Lieutenant-General Paul Methuen. The majority of the division departed the UK between 20 and 24 October, and arrived at Cape Town around three weeks later. Before their arrival, the Boers invaded the British Cape and Natal colonies, and besieged Kimberley and Ladysmith respectively. These moves changed the initial plan for the army corps, which had been to march on the Boer capital Bloemfontein. Instead, the majority of arriving force, which included the division&#x27;s 2nd Brigade, was ordered to Natal to lift the siege of Ladysmith. The 1st Division was assigned to relieve Kimberley and allotted the 9th Infantry Brigade, which was newly formed from troops already based in southern Africa, to replace the 2nd Brigade. This brought the division to 7,726 infantry, and 850 cavalry and mounted infantry. Additional support was provided by the 3rd (Highland) Brigade, which secured the division&#x27;s lines of communication.

The advance towards Kimberley started on 21 November and followed the Cape Town–Kimberley railway line. After skirmishing with Boer forces, the 1st Division encountered the first prepared defensive position near Belmont, where the Boers had entrenched themselves on several hills that dominated the railway track. During the Battle of Belmont, which was fought on 23 November, the division assaulted and captured these positions just after daybreak, although the majority of the Boers withdrew in good order. British losses amounted to 54 killed and 243 wounded; Boer losses included 80 killed and 70 taken prisoner, in addition to the capture of draft animals and supplies. Frederick Maurice, author of the British official history of the war, lauded the small-unit tactics used by the division but said Methuen failed to convert the &quot;successful engagement into a decisive victory&quot;. Stephen Miller, a historian who has written about the war, noted the battle &quot;was a victory of sorts&quot; for the 1st Division but that it was not &quot;the decisive victory Methuen had wanted&quot; due to the lack of mounted troops. This deficiency meant the division was unable to press or attempt to encircle the retreating Boers, who were able to escape and fight again two days later.

Similar battles and outcomes occurred on 25 and 28 November, when the Boers were engaged in the battles of Graspan and Modder River. Between the two battles, 628 casualties were suffered; Boer losses are not known but are believed to be low in comparison—Maurice stated at least 40 Boers were taken prisoner and 73 dead bodies were located. After the Battle of Modder River, the Boers destroyed a railway bridge and retreated to Magersfontein. The 1st Division remained in the area to rest, receive reinforcements, and assist in the construction of a replacement bridge until 10 December. The following day, the Battle of Magersfontein took place. Despite a preliminary artillery bombardment, the 1st Division&#x27;s attack failed with 948 casualties. Boer losses are estimated between 236 and 275. In conjunction with other failed attacks that occurred during the same week, the news of events at Magersfontein led to the political crisis known as Black Week.

Having failed at Magersfontein, Methuen retreated and took up position on the Riet River, which was dubbed the &quot;Modder position&quot;. Part of the political backlash of Black Week saw Methuen&#x27;s command come into question; the War Office wanted to remove him. The preferred replacement was Lieutenant-General Charles Warren, who was commanding the 5th Division and had not yet arrived in southern Africa. General Redvers Buller, commander of the First Army Corps who was also under considerable political pressure due to Black Week, defended Methuen. This defence, coupled with a changing military situation and discussions about morale resulted in no change of command. From the &quot;Modder position&quot;, the division conducted reconnaissance and raids into Orange Free State that destroyed farms, burnt crops, and seized livestock; a precursor to the large-scale adoption of similar methods later in the war. Such tactics have been seen as war crimes in breach of the 1899 Hague Convention. In January, the 1st Division was assigned a defensive role; that month, artillery, engineers, cavalry, and most of the division&#x27;s transport were transferred to new commands, as was the Highland Brigade. Rumours of Methuen having scapegoated the brigade, in addition to heavy casualties that included the loss of their commanding officer, resulted in increasing animosity among the soldiers. Their new commander noted all were relieved when the transfer took place, and Methuen privately wrote he believed none would want to serve under him again. The division was provided with four siege guns to reinforce their defensive posture. Miller stated the division&#x27;s presence prevented the Boers from attempting to invade Cape Colony during this period.

Behind the screen provided by the 1st Division, four additional divisions were assembled. On 7 February, a new offensive was launched; it lifted the siege of Kimberley on 15 February. During this offensive, the 1st Division was restricted to flank and lines of communication protection. Two days later, the division moved to Kimberley; the Guards had been transferred to a new division and the 1st Division now commanded one brigade. At Kimberley, it guarded the British forward supply base supply lines; it was also tasked with clearing the nearby area of Boer forces and supporting efforts to lift the Siege of Mafeking. To aid in these goals, a brigade of militia and a brigade of Imperial Yeomanry were attached. During March, the 1st Division advanced, seized several villages, reached Warrenton, and also repaired bridges and the railway line as they proceeded. On 5 April, a small Boer commando led by Comte de Villebois-Mareuil was defeated at the Battle of Boshof. While additional settlements were seized and patrols that took prisoners were maintained, the advance towards Mafeking ended and the town was relieved by forces that were closer. Thereafter, the division marched east, following the Vaal River, towards Kroonstad. The division covered in 15 days, captured small Boer forces and destroyed 12,000 rounds of ammunition. The 1st Division arrived at Kroonstad on 28 May and was nicknamed the &quot;Mobile Marvels&quot;.

In June, the division attempted to trap the elusive Boer leader Christiaan de Wet and relieve besieged Imperial Yeomanry. The first engagement occurred on 1 June near Lindley, where the division stormed Boer positions but found they had been too late to relieve the yeomanry. Skirmishing later took place without major engagements. Between 17 and 23 June, several divisions, including the 1st Division, were reorganised as the British Army reacted to the end of conventional warfare and to combat Boer guerrilla warfare tactics. Methuen&#x27;s command, now a division in name only, became a flying column of five battalions with a force of 3,600 men supported by some artillery pieces and machine guns. The intention was to be more mobile and constantly searching for Boer forces. The rest of the division was transferred to similar columns or assigned to static defences to guard settlements or other vulnerable positions. The frustrating pursuit of de Wet and other Boer leaders went on for months. In September, the division lifted a Boer siege of Schweizer-Reneke, took 28 prisoners, and seized nearly 5,000 animals and 20,000 rounds of ammunition. By the end of 1900, the field divisions had ceased to exist; additional garrisons and mobile columns were formed as British strategy was further refined to counter the Boers.

==Reform period==
In response to the lessons learnt from the Boer War, which included the army&#x27;s failings in the opening months, the Secretary of State for War St John Brodrick set out to reform the standing army. He intended to create six army corps, three of which would be composed of permanent standing formations that consisted of the army&#x27;s regulars. They would be ready for immediate dispatch in the event of an imperial crisis or a European war. In 1902, three corps were formed; these would allow up to nine divisions, each of two brigades, to be created; including the reforming of the 1st Division, which was finalised on 30 September 1902 when Major-General Arthur Paget took command. The reformed division consisted of the 1st and the 2nd Brigades, each containing four infantry battalions. The division, along with the 2nd and 5th, was regarded as being ready for war on the order of mobilisation.

In 1907, the Haldane Reforms further restructured the regular army into six infantry divisions, each with three brigades. These divisions would form the basis of a British Expeditionary Force (BEF) that would be dispatched to Europe in the case of war. The reform also replaced the army corps with regional commands. The changes resulted in the 3rd Brigade being assigned to the 1st Division; in addition to two field companies of Royal Engineers, two signal companies provided by the Royal Engineers, and three artillery brigades—each containing three batteries of guns. The 1st Division was assigned to Aldershot Command, where the 1st Brigade was located. The 2nd Brigade was based at Blackdown and the 3rd Brigade was housed at Bordon.

==History beyond 1909==
The 1st Division subsequently fought in the First (1914–1918) and the Second World Wars (1939–1945). In February 1945, it relocated to Palestine. During the early stages of the Cold War period, the 1st Division was garrisoned in Palestine, Libya, and Egypt, before it returned to the UK in 1955. It remained there until 30 June 1960, when it was disbanded due to there being no need for an additional divisional headquarters in the UK. The following day, it was reformed when the 5th Division was renamed and took on the 1st Division&#x27;s history and insignia. The new 1st Division was based in Germany as part of the British Army of the Rhine. During April 1978, a reorganisation took place and the formation was renamed the 1st Armoured Division. Under this banner, in 1990–1991, it fought in the Gulf War. When the Cold War ended, the British government restructured the army as part of its Options for Change programme, which saw the 1st Division again disbanded on 31 December 1992. In 1993, the Germany-based 4th Armoured Division was renamed the 1st (United Kingdom) Armoured Division. During the 1990s, the division was deployed to Bosnia as part of peacekeeping efforts during the Bosnian War, and in the 2000s it fought in the Iraq War. In 2014, the division was redesignated the 1st (United Kingdom) Division.

<doc id="432283" wikidata="Q62456" url="?curid=432283" title="Southern Qi">
<text>Qi, known in historiography as the Southern Qi ( or ) or Xiao Qi (), was a Chinese imperial dynasty and the second of the four Southern dynasties during the Northern and Southern dynasties era. It followed the Liu Song dynasty and was succeeded by the Liang dynasty. The main polity to its north was the Northern Wei.

== History ==
The dynasty began in 479, when Xiao Daocheng forced the Emperor Shun of Liu Song (宋顺帝) into yielding the throne to him, ending Liu Song and starting Southern Qi, as its Emperor Gao. The dynasty&#x27;s name was taken from Xiao&#x27;s fief, which roughly occupied the same territory as the Warring States era Kingdom of Qi. The Book of the Qi does not mention whether or not Xiao had any blood relationship to either the House of Jiang or House of Tian, the two dynasties which had previously ruled that kingdom.

During its 23-year history, the dynasty was largely filled with instability, as after the death of the capable Emperor Gao and Emperor Wu, Emperor Wu&#x27;s grandson Xiao Zhaoye (萧昭业) was assassinated by Emperor Wu&#x27;s intelligent but cruel and suspicious cousin Xiao Luan (萧鸾), who took over as Emperor Ming, and proceeded to carry out massive executions of Emperor Gao&#x27;s and Emperor Wu&#x27;s sons, as well as officials whom he suspected of plotting against him.

The arbitrariness of these executions was exacerbated after Emperor Ming was succeeded by his son Xiao Baojuan, whose actions drew multiple rebellions, the last of which, by the general Xiao Yan (萧衍) led to Southern Qi&#x27;s fall and succession by Xiao Yan&#x27;s Liang Dynasty.
More than fifty percent of Tuoba Xianbei princesses of the Northern Wei were married to southern Han Chinese men from the imperial families and aristocrats from southern China of the Southern dynasties who defected and moved north to join the Northern Wei. Tuoba Xianbei Princess Nanyang (南阳长公主) was married to Xiao Baoyin (萧宝夤), a Han Chinese member of Southern Qi royalty. Xianbei Tuoba Emperor Xiaozhuang of Northern Wei&#x27;s sister the Shouyang Princess was wedded to the Han Chinese Liang dynasty ruler Emperor Wu of Liang&#x27;s son Xiao Zong .

== War with Northern Wei ==
In 479, after Xiao Daocheng usurped the throne of Liu Song, the Northern Wei emperor prepared to invade under the pretext of installing Liu Chang, son of Emperor Wen of Liu Song who had been in exile in Wei since 465 AD.
Wei troops began to attack Shouyang but could not take the city. The Southern Qi began to fortify their capital, Jiankang, in order to prevent further Wei raids.
Multiple sieges and skirmishes were fought until 481 but the war did not witness any major campaign. A peace treaty was signed in 490 with the Emperor Wu.

<text>From April 26 to 27, 1991, multiple supercells across Oklahoma and Kansas led to a regional tornado outbreak. Forced by a potent trough and focused along a dryline, these distinct thunderstorms moved northeast through a moist and highly unstable environment. A total of 55 tornadoes were confirmed, many of which were strong, F2 or greater on the Fujita scale. A widely documented F5 tornado tore through Andover, Kansas, killing 17 people. Additional fatalities occurred from significant tornadoes in other portions of Kansas and Oklahoma, with 21 deaths recorded in total. An F4 tornado was detected by a mobile doppler weather radar team which observed winds up to at the top of the funnel, the first time winds of F5 intensity were measured by radar, and the highest winds recorded by radar at the time. A news team filming an F2 tornado sought shelter under a Kansas Turnpike overpass, causing a misconception that overpasses can provide adequate shelter during a tornado. This outbreak occurred within a transition period for the National Weather Service and proved the value of NEXRAD radars, which were utilized in Oklahoma to provide advanced warning to residents.

==Meteorological synopsis==

On April 25, 1991, the National Weather Service issued a warning of an impending weather system, noting that computer models were &quot;indicating this to be a very significant severe weather producer with tornadoes occurring across the Central/Southern Plains.&quot; On the morning of April 26, the organization delineated a High risk of severe weather across the Great Plains. A southeast-tilted trough existed across the Southwestern United States that morning, and a distinct jet streak, or a region of enhanced winds at the base of the trough, on the order of was progressing northeast toward the Plains. Through the morning hours, an 850 mb or approximately low-level jet of up to overspread regions from south-central Kansas northward into eastern Nebraska. A surface low-pressure area existed over southwestern Nebraska, supporting a dry line southward into Texas and a warm front southeastward across eastern sections of Kansas and Oklahoma.

In the unstable atmosphere between those two boundaries, surface dewpoints rose above . Abundant sunshine contributed to destabilization as lifted indices topped -12 from central Oklahoma into central Kansas and convective available potential energy reached 4,000 J/kg. A minimal capping inversion existed across Oklahoma even during the morning hours, and tornado-producing storms first developed across western Oklahoma around sunrise. These storms weakened as they moved northeast into Kansas. Back to the west, the dryline progressed rapidly eastward but began to slow precipitously during the afternoon hours. Attempts at thunderstorm development along this feature initially failed. At 17:10 UTC (12:20 p.m. CDT), the National Weather Service issued a particularly dangerous situation tornado watch, warning of the potential for multiple strong to violent tornadoes. This would be one of 24 convective watches issued during the day. Despite early failure at convective initiation, supercell thunderstorms rapidly erupted along the dryline during the afternoon hours as the jet streak propagated into the Great Plains, resulting in a regional outbreak of tornadoes stretching from Texas to Iowa. Violent tornadoes were concentrated in southern Kansas and Oklahoma, although intense tornadoes were also observed in Iowa, Texas, and Nebraska.

==Confirmed tornadoes==

===Haysville–McConnell AFB–Wichita–Andover, Kansas===
At 5:49 p.m. CDT (22:49 UTC), the storm which would become the Wichita–Andover tornado began east of Clearwater. At 6:05 p.m. CDT (23:05 UTC), the National Weather Service issued a statement urging residents in Haysville, Derby, and Mulvane to seek shelter. This was succeeded by a tornado warning four minutes later. Around 6:16 p.m. CDT (23:16 UTC), the intensifying tornado began to affect southeastern sections of Wichita and directly struck Haysville. It produced strong F2 to F3 damage in Haysville while growing to a width of about and acquiring multi-vortex characteristics. The tornado crossed the Kansas Turnpike about south of the South Wichita Interchange. In eastern Wichita, some well-built houses in the Greenwich Heights Subdivision were completely leveled, indicative of strong F3 to F4 damage. Four people were killed at this location. At 6:24 p.m. CDT (23:24 UTC), the violent tornado struck the McConnell Air Force Base, where it narrowly missed a lineup of 10 B-1B bombers each worth $280 million and 2 of which were equipped with nuclear warheads. Nine major facilities on the base were destroyed, including the officer&#x27;s club, base hospital, library, and elementary school. In addition, 102 housing units were demolished. No fatalities were recorded there, though 16 people were injured and total losses reached $62 million. As the tornado continued to move toward U.S. Route 54 in Kansas in the direction of Andover, it prompted forecasters to issue a heightened tornado warning alerting residents in Augusta and Andover that a damaging tornado was approaching. Despite this warning, the tornado sirens in Andover failed.

At 6:31 p.m. CDT (23:31 UTC), with the sirens not functional, the police drove through the Golden Spur Mobile Home Park and through the town warning residents to seek shelter. 10 minutes later, the now large wedge-stovepipe hybrid tornado entered southern Andover and began to impact the mobile home park, which ultimately sustained a direct hit. Of the 244 manufactured homes, 205, or about 84 percent of them, were destroyed. Post-storm interviews by health officials found that 339 residents were home during the tornado, of which 146 evacuated, 149 sought refuge in the community shelter, and 38 remained in their homes. No casualties occurred among individuals who fled or utilized the shelter. However, 13 people were killed, another 17 were hospitalized, and 9 sustained minor injuries among the group who remained in their structures. Additional homes were swept from their foundations to the west of this park, where the Andover tornado earned its F5 rating. Throughout the city, over 1,500 residences were devastated. The tornado continued northeast, affecting the outskirts of Towanda. Twenty minutes later, the violent tornado dissipated west of El Dorado and north of the Kansas Turnpike, though the parent supercell later produced additional tornadoes. Along the tornado&#x27;s path, 84 frame houses and 14 businesses were leveled. A total of 225 people were injured. It was the final Kansas tornado to be given an F5 rating prior to the implementation of the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which was principally used on the Greensburg EF5 tornado on May 4, 2007.
===Red Rock, Oklahoma===

To the south of several significant supercells in Kansas, another discrete storm produced a tornado at 6:30 p.m. CDT (23:30 UTC) which would reach F4 intensity, track for , and reach a maximum width of . The tornado began east of Garber and continued south of Billings. In this area, it reached F3 intensity, snapping power poles, toppling well pumps, demolishing a house, and destroying oil tanks. As it neared Interstate 35 and crossed into Noble County, the tornado first reached F4 intensity, flattening a house and debarking many trees. In neighboring Osage County, two farms were destroyed before the tornado continued into Osage County. There, it passed west of Pawhuska, toppling an oil rig with an foundation. It lifted west-northwest of that city. Along the tornado&#x27;s path across sparsely populated areas, several county roads had portions of their asphalt stripped away. Near Red Rock the tornado became particularly intense. In this area a University of Oklahoma chase team headed by Howard Bluestein utilized mobile doppler weather radar to analyze the tornado. The radar measured peak winds of at the top of the tornado&#x27;s funnel, suggesting the tornado probably had F5 winds close to the ground. At the time, this represented the strongest winds ever measured by radar, including the first measurements of F5 intensity winds.
===El Dorado Lake–Kansas Turnpike Underpass, Kansas===

After causing widespread destruction in Andover, the parent supercell continued northeast and produced another strong tornado. This tornado, rated F2, tracked for across Butler and Chase counties in Kansas. It paralleled the Kansas Turnpike for many miles before eventually crossing the road south of Cassoday, tossing vehicles up to away from the turnpike. The tornado gained notoriety when a Kansas television crew sought shelter underneath an overpass on the Kansas Turnpike. Video from the crew shows a minivan several hundred yards down the turnpike being rolled multiple times, with other vehicles such as large semi-trailer trucks overturned and severely damaged as well. Alongside the 1979 Wichita Falls F4 tornado, this marked the second prominent example of people seeking refuge from a tornado underneath an overpass. Information from the National Weather Service initially and indirectly contributed to this line of thought as well.

During the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak, the consequences of this practice were realized. On May 3, 1999, there were three locations where a highway overpass was utilized as a shelter from approaching tornadoes, and at all three locations there was at least one fatality. One of these, the 1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado, was at violent F4–F5 intensity as impacted the overpass. One incorrect notion from the Kansas Turnpike video was that the film crew was protected by the weaker nature of the tornado as it passed over a primarily rural area, in contrast to the Bridge Creek–Moore tornado. However, another F2 tornado on May 3, 1999, killed one individual, proving that tornadoes of any intensity are capable of killing people harboring under overpasses. In addition to the fatalities, many people who survived these tornadoes nonetheless suffered graphic injuries and sometimes permanent disabilities.

Since the Kansas Turnpike video and events on May 3, meteorologists have strongly advised people to avoid seeking shelter under highway overpasses for many reasons. One, it exposes individuals to flying debris, which is the number one cause of death in tornadoes. Two, the elevated nature of the overpass subjects people to stronger winds than at ground level. Three, overpasses may act to channel and accelerate the wind. Four, many overpasses do not have girders for individuals to hold onto, such as was the case during the Kansas Turnpike video. Fifth, tornadic winds shift directions as the vortex passes, such that people originally protected from winds will still be exposed to its effects following the wind shift. The National Weather Service therefore notes, &quot;seeking shelter under a highway overpass is to become a stationary target for flying debris, with a substantial risk of being blown out and carried by the tornado winds&quot;. Lastly, motorists who quickly park their cars under an overpass without pulling over to the side first can cause an unexpected traffic jam, that may slow/strand other drivers due to the risk of collision.
==Aftermath==

In the wake of the tornado outbreak, Kansas Governor Joan Finney requested that President George H.W. Bush supply Sedgwick, Butler, and Cowley counties with federal disaster aid, a move that the president later approved. Under the $2.6 million program, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) paid 75 percent of the cost for disaster cleanup, while the local government paid 15 percent, and the state paid the remaining 10 percent. Oklahoma Governor David Walters likewise requested federal assistance for six counties in his state. American Red Cross and civil defense officials scoured devastated homes and rendered aid to about 370 families affected by the storms. After two Oklahoma counties were not granted disaster assistance, local officials in Garfield and Washington counties criticized FEMA&#x27;s decision. The organization responded by noting that additional counties could be added to the list in the future but that damage in those counties was marginal for a presidential declaration. Two days later, federal assistance was made available to both counties.

In the Oologah–Talala school district of Oklahoma, which was all but devastated during the tornado outbreak, the Oklahoma State Department of Education voted to forgive the remaining 23 days of classes, the largest number of instructional days forgiven in a single school year on record at the time. Individual student conferences were held at a local church. About 170 construction workers worked double shifts to repair the school grounds, which were tentatively set to reopen on August 12. Of the district&#x27;s 24 buses, 15 were repaired in the weeks following the tornado outbreak, while 9 were rendered inoperable. The school district reopened on August 15.

The 1991 outbreak occurred during a period of modernization for the National Weather Service and helped highlight the value of radar imagery for detecting tornadoes. In April 1991, the WSR-88D NEXRAD radar in Norman, Oklahoma, was the only radar of its kind with Doppler capabilities, and even then it had not been cleared for use in day-to-day operations. In Oklahoma, the higher resolution radar displayed important storm-scale characteristics such as mesocyclones, some of which were seen over away in Kansas. For comparison, the outdated radars in that state, though closer, did not depict significant features indicative of an ongoing tornado. Instead, forecasters in Kansas were forced to rely on reports from the public and storm chasers. In an internal assessment of the event, the National Weather Service concluded that &quot;The NWS should continue to implement the Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD) network across the Nation. This event illustrates the usefulness of the WSR-88D velocity fields and better azimuthal resolution reflectivity data.&quot; The implementation of these radars have improved tornado lead times in modern years.

The outbreak was featured in two different documentaries: &quot;Enemy Wind&quot;, a documentary produced by The Weather Channel, and &quot;Cyclone&quot;, a documentary produced and distributed by National Geographic under its National Geographic Home Video series.

<doc id="432287" wikidata="Q1069868" url="?curid=432287" title="Liang dynasty">
<text>The Liang dynasty (), alternatively known as the Southern Liang () or Xiao Liang () in historiography, was an imperial dynasty of China and the third of the four Southern dynasties during the Northern and Southern dynasties period. It was preceded by the Southern Qi dynasty and succeeded by the Chen dynasty. The rump state of Western Liang existed until it was conquered in 587 by the Sui dynasty.

== Rule ==
During the Liang dynasty, in 547 a Persian embassy paid tribute to the Liang, amber was recorded as originating from Persia by the &quot;Book of Liang&quot;.

In 548, the Prince of Henan Hou Jing started a rebellion with Xiao Zhengde, the Prince of Linhe, nephew and a former heir of the Emperor Wu of Liang, and installed Xiao Zhengde as emperor. In 549, Hou sacked Jiankang, deposed and killed Xiao Zhengde, seized power and put Emperor Wu effectively under house arrest. He dismissed the armies opposed to him in the name of Emperor Wu. In 549, Emperor Wu died; Emperor Wu&#x27;s third son Crown Prince Gang (the later Emperor Jianwen) then ascended the throne under Hou&#x27;s shadow; Emperor Jianwen was also effectively under house arrest. Hou also attempted to suppress those who would not submit to him.

At the same time the Liang princes fought with each other rather than try to eliminate Hou: Emperor Wu&#x27;s seventh son Xiao Yi Prince of Xiangdong killed his nephew Xiao Yu the Prince of Hedong, forcing Xiao Yu&#x27;s younger brother Xiao Cha Prince of Yueyang to surrender to the Western Wei; Xiao Yi also attacked his sixth brother Xiao Guan Prince of Shaoling, forcing him to surrender to Northern Qi. Both Xiao Cha and Xiao Guan were created Prince of Liang. However, as Xiao Yi also allied with Northern Qi, Northern Qi gave up their support of Xiao Guan; Xiao Guan was defeated by Hou and finally killed by Western Wei. Xiao Ji the Prince of Wuling the youngest son of Emperor Wu claimed imperial title.

In 551, Hou forced Emperor Jianwen to abdicate to his grandnephew Xiao Dong the Prince of Yuzhang, then killed Emperor Jianwen and forced Xiao Dong to abdicate to him. Hou established a new dynasty named Han. In 552, Xiao Yi destroyed Han and claimed the imperial title as Emperor Yuan of Liang. He also ordered his subordinates to kill Xiao Dong and Xiao Dong&#x27;s younger brothers. He created his headquarter Jiangling capital instead of returning to Jiankang. He also managed to eliminate Xiao Ji, but in order to do this he allied with Western Wei, who in turn conquered Yi Province (Sichuan).

In 553, Northern Qi attacked Liang, aiming to install a nephew of Emperor Wu, Xiao Tui the Marquess of Xiangyin, as emperor, but was defeated.

As the relationship between Emperor Yuan and Western Wei was deteriorating, in 555, Western Wei army sacked Jiangling, forcing Emperor Yuan to surrender, and killed Emperor Yuan as well as his sons before installing Xiao Cha as emperor of (Western) Liang at Jiangling.

Liang generals led by Wang Sengbian declared Xiao Fangzhi Prince of Jin&#x27;an, the only living son of Emperor Yuan, as Prince of Liang at Jiankang, aiming to crown him the new emperor, but the Northern Qi army defeated them, forcing them into an agreement to recognise a nephew of Emperor Wu, Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, as emperor instead. Wang requested that Xiao Fangzhi be created Crown Prince and Xiao Yuanming agreed. General Chen Baxian launched a raid that killed Wang in favor of Xiao Fangzhi while denouncing Wang for surrendering to Northern Qi. Xiao Yuanming was forced to abdicate to Xiao Fangzhi, who was known as Emperor Jing of Liang, and Chen seized power. He initially claimed Liang a subject of Northern Qi but later defeated the army of Northern Qi.

In 557, Chen Baxian established the new powerful Chen dynasty. Liang general Wang Lin also claimed Xiao Zhuang Prince of Yongjia grandson of Emperor Yuan emperor. In 560, the Chen dynasty defeated Xiao Zhuang who fled to the Northern Qi and was created Prince of Liang in 570. The small and weak Western Liang state existed until 587 when the Sui dynasty destroyed it.

In 617, Xiao Xian from Western Liang imperial clan claimed himself Liang Emperor in light of the disturbance in the end of Sui dynasty. His realm was destroyed by Tang dynasty in 621.

== Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang ==

The &quot;Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang&quot; by the Emperor Yuan of Liang, Xiao Yi, dated to the 6th century, is the earliest surviving of these specially significant paintings. They reflect foreign embassies that took place, particularly regarding the three Hephthalite (Hua) ambassadors, in 516–520 CE. The original of the work was lost, and the only surviving edition of this work was a copy from the Song dynasty in the 11th century, and is currently preserved at the National Museum of China. The original work consisted of at least twenty five portraits of ambassadors from their respectively country. The copy from the Song dynasty has twelve portraits and descriptions of thirteen envoys, with the envoy from Dangchang missing a portrait.

The envoys from right to left were: the Hephthalites (滑/嚈哒), Persia (波斯), Korea (百濟), Kucha (龜茲), Japan (倭), Malaysia (狼牙脩), Qiang (鄧至), Yarkand (周古柯), Kabadiyan (呵跋檀), Kumedh (胡蜜丹), Balkh (白題), and Mohe (末).

==Literature==
The Liang is the best represented of the Northern and Southern Dynasties in terms of surviving written material. It was a period of brilliant literary accomplishments and produced important texts like the official histories of the Liu Song and Southern Qi dynasties, the literary anthology &quot;Wenxuan&quot;, the poetry anthology &quot;Yutai xinyong&quot;, the literary criticism works &quot;Wenxin diaolong&quot; and &quot;Shi pin&quot;, and Huang Kan&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Lunyu&quot;.

==Artistic heritage==
Tombs of a number of members of the ruling Xiao family, with their sculptural ensembles, in various states of preservation, are located near Nanjing.
The best surviving example of the Liang dynasty&#x27;s monumental statuary is perhaps the ensemble of the Tomb of Xiao Xiu (475–518), a brother of Emperor Wu, located in Qixia District east of Nanjing.

<text>The Chen dynasty (), alternatively known as the Southern Chen (南陳 / 南朝陳) in historiography, was a Chinese imperial dynasty and the fourth and last of the Southern dynasties during the Northern and Southern dynasties period. Following the Liang dynasty, the Chen dynasty was founded by Chen Baxian (Emperor Wu). The Chen dynasty further strengthened and revitalized the economy and culture of southern China, and made territorial expansions northward, laying the foundation for future dynasties. It was conquered by the Sui dynasty in 589, marking an end to the Northern and Southern dynasties period in Chinese history. The descendants of the Chen imperial family continued to hold powerful high-ranking positions in the imperial courts of both the Sui and Tang dynasties.

== History ==

=== Founding and expansion: Chen Baxian ===
In the twilight of the Liang dynasty (548–557), the Houjing Disturbance (侯景之乱) occurred. The insurrection caused the downfall and ruin of the Liang. In 557, Chen Baxian a former high-ranked Liang general, took the initiative to establish a new empire in Southern China: the Chen dynasty. Its founder Chen Baxian had been granted the title of &quot;Prince of Chen&quot;, and on taking the throne he followed the Chinese practice of using his former princely title as the name of the new dynasty.

Chen Baxian was a visionary leader whose conquests helped revived the economy and culture of South China, bringing it to new heights. Near the start of the dynasty, Chen&#x27;s northern neighbors the Eastern and Western Wei were later replaced by the Northern Zhou and Northern Qi, with the north of the Yangtze river held by the Qi, and the southwest including Sichuan was held by the Zhou. Chen Baxian defeated the Northern armies in one swoop, securing the prosperity and dominance of the Chen dynasty, and making further territorial gains in the north.

==== Vietnam: Defeating Lý Thiên Bảo ====
In 541, the people of Giao Châu Province (Chen northern Vietnam) rebelled under Lý Bôn. Xiao Ying sent the generals Sun Jiong (孫冏) and Lu Zixiong (盧子雄) to attack Lý Bôn, with Xiao Ying overseeing the operations. In spring 542, Xiao Ying and Xiao Zi ordered Sun and Lu to attack, but they lost to Lý, and soon infighting broke out between Sun, Lu, and another general Zhou. Xiao Ying then sent Chen Baxian to clean up the situation, and Chen Baxian defeated all of them, killing Du Tianhe and capturing Du Sengming and Zhou. Believing that Du Sengming and Zhou were both good soldiers, he released them and retained them on his staff. For this accomplishment, the Emperor Wu of Liang created Chen the Viscount of Xin&#x27;an and had an artisan draw a portrait of Chen.

In January 544, Lý Bôn proclaimed himself emperor and named his small state Vạn Xuân. In winter 544, Xiao Ying died, and initially, Chen started escorting Xiao Ying&#x27;s casket back to Jiankang for burial. On the way, while he was still at Dayu Mountain (大庾嶺, on the borders of modern Jiangxi and Guangdong), he made a rendezvous with the new governor of Giao Châu Province, Yang Piao (楊瞟), and another nephew of Emperor Wu&#x27;s, Xiao Bo (蕭勃), to attack Lý Bôn. Xiao Bao did not want to set out on the campaign, and therefore tried to persuade Yang not to advance. Chen persuaded Yang otherwise, and in spring 545, Yang, with Chen as his lieutenant, attacked Lý Bôn, defeating him and forcing him to flee into the mountains and conduct guerilla warfare instead. In 548, Lý Bôn died of illness, and when Lý Bôn&#x27;s brother Lý Thiên Bảo succeeded him and attacked Ái Province (愛州, around modern Thanh Hóa Province, Vietnam), Chen defeated Lý Thiên Bảo. Emperor Wu made Chen the governor of Gaoyao Commandery (高要, Chen Zhaoqing, Guangdong) as well as the commander of the forces of the surrounding commanderies.

==== Hou Jing ====

In summer 548, Hou Jing, formerly a general of Eastern Wei (a successor state of the Northern Wei), rebelled and in 549 captured Jiankang, taking Emperor Wu of Liang and his son and crown prince Xiao Gang hostage. After Jiankang&#x27;s fall, Hou, who had initially claimed that he wanted to restore Northern Wei&#x27;s imperial clan to power, from the control of the regent Gao Cheng, enticed the governor of Guang Province, Yuan Jingzhong (元景仲), a member of Northern Wei&#x27;s imperial Yuan clan, to join him. When Chen received the news, he publicly announced Yuan&#x27;s treachery and gathered the troops of the nearby generals to attack Yuan. Yuan committed suicide, and Chen welcomed Xiao Bo, then the governor of Ding Province (定州, roughly Guangxi) to take over Guang Province. In winter 549, against Xiao Bo&#x27;s request, Chen took his troops and embarked on a campaign to join the fight against Hou, sending messengers to Emperor Wu&#x27;s son Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong, the governor of Jing Province (荊州, central and western Hubei), pledging support and loyalty to Xiao Yi, then commonly viewed as the leader of the remaining Liang provinces not under Hou&#x27;s control.

For the next year, Chen advanced north through modern Jiangxi, fighting the various local warlords and generals loyal to Hou, with his main struggle against Li Qianshi (李遷仕). In spring 551, he captured and killed Li. Xiao Yi made him the governor of Jiang Province (江州, around Jiangxi). By fall 551, he had rendezvoused with Xiao Yi&#x27;s main general, Wang Sengbian, at Xunyang (尋陽, Chen Jiujiang, Jiangxi). In 552, after they had sworn a solemn oath to Liang, they advanced east toward Jiankang, where Hou had killed Xiao Gang (who had succeeded Emperor Wu as Emperor Jianwen) and taken the throne himself as Emperor of Han. Chen was instrumental in the subsequent siege of Jiankang, and they defeated Hou together, causing Hou to flee. Subsequently, Hou was killed by his own men. For Chen&#x27;s contributions, Xiao Yi created Chen the Marquess of Changcheng—Chen&#x27;s home county. Wang put Chen in charge of the important city Jingkou (京口, Chen Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). For the next two years, Chen fought several border battles against the Northern Qi. At times, when Xiao Yi summoned Wang on campaigns, Wang would put Chen in charge of Jiankang.

==== Rise ====
In 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling, and Emperor Yuan summoned Wang to come to his aid, putting Chen in charge of Jiankang. Before Wang could reach Jiangling, however, Western Wei had already captured Jiangling, killing Emperor Yuan and declaring his nephew Xiao Cha emperor instead (as Emperor Xuan). Wang and Chen refused to recognize Emperor Xuan; instead, in spring 555, they welcomed Emperor Yuan&#x27;s 11-year-old son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin&#x27;an—Emperor Yuan&#x27;s only surviving son—to Jiankang, preparing to make him emperor and first having him take the title Prince of Liang. When Jiankang fell, Chen&#x27;s son Chen Chang and nephew Chen Xu, who had been serving in the imperial administration, were captured and taken to the Western Wei capital Chang&#x27;an as honored captives.

At this time, however, Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi had other ideas, and he sent his brother Gao Huan (高渙) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Emperor Yuan&#x27;s cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang—whom Eastern Wei had taken captive in 547—back to Liang to be emperor. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after his forces lost a few battles to Northern Qi forces, changed his mind and decided to accept Xiao Yuanming as emperor after extracting a promise from Xiao Yuanming to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince. In summer 555, Xiao Yuanming arrived at Jiankang to take the throne, and he created Xiao Fangzhi crown prince. Wang and Chen continued to be in charge of the military.

Chen, however, was unhappy about the situation, believing Xiao Yuanming to be unworthy of the throne. Despite Wang Sengbian&#x27;s knowledge of Chen&#x27;s displeasure, however, Wang did not suspect Chen of having any rebellious intentions, as they had been friendly, and Wang and Chen had agreed on having Wang Sengbian&#x27;s son Wang Wei (王頠) marry Chen&#x27;s daughter. In fall 555, believing reports that Northern Qi was going to attack, Wang sent his secretary Jiang Gan (江旰) to Jingkou to alert Chen. Chen took over control of the imperial government, forcing Xiao Yuanming to abdicate and making Xiao Fangzhi emperor (as Emperor Jing).

Chen initially sent his nephew Chen Qian and his general Zhou Wenyu against Du and Du&#x27;s ally Wei Zai (韋載). Meanwhile, Xu and Ren, aided by Northern Qi, made a surprise attack on Jiankang, nearly capturing it, but were repelled by Chen&#x27;s general Hou Andu. Soon, Chen defeated Wei and Wei surrendered, and Chen returned to Jiankang, leaving Zhou to face Du.

Despite Northern Qi aid, Xu and Ren could not defeat Chen, and Chen put Shitou, which the Northern Qi general Liu Damo (柳達摩) had captured, under siege. Liu sought peace, but requested Chen to send his relatives as hostages to Northern Qi. Most officials advocated peace, and Chen, despite his skepticism about such a peace holding, agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (陳曇朗), Emperor Yuan&#x27;s grandson Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (王珉), the son of the key official Wang Chong (王沖), as hostages, permitting Northern Qi forces to withdraw, and Xu and Ren withdrew with them.

By spring 556, Du had either been captured or surrendered to Zhou and Chen Qian, and Chen Baxian executed Du. Wang Sengzhi fled to Northern Qi, and the capital region was largely under Chen Baxian&#x27;s control. Meanwhile, Northern Qi forces were preparing another attack, but they invited Xiao Yuanming to their camp to discuss peace. Chen sent Xiao Yuanming to Northern Qi camp, but before talks could begin, Xiao Yuanming died from a severe infection on his back. By summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again descending on Jiankang, but once there, their forces stalemated with Chen&#x27;s forces. Northern Qi forces&#x27; food supplies soon ran out, and Chen defeated them, killing Xu and capturing a number of Northern Qi generals, whom Chen executed. Meanwhile, Hou Tian, having been defeated by another general, Hou Ping (侯平), chose to submit to Chen.

During the next year, Chen began to receive greater titles and offices, progressing from Marquess of Changcheng to Duke of Changcheng to Duke of Yixing to Duke of Chen to Prince of Chen. In 557, Xiao Bo declared a resistance against Chen from Guang Province. Soon, however, Zhou defeated Xiao Bo&#x27;s general Ouyang Wei (歐陽頠), and Xiao Bo was killed by his own generals. At the same time, Wang Lin, who controlled modern Hunan and eastern Hubei, suspicious of Chen&#x27;s intentions, refused his summon to Jiankang and prepared for battle instead. Chen sent Zhou and Hou Andu against Wang Lin. In winter 557, Chen had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing the Chen dynasty as its Emperor Wu. He created Emperor Jing the Prince of Jiangyin. He posthumously honored his parents emperor and empress, his deceased wife Lady Qian empress, and his deceased son Chen Ke crown prince. He created his wife Zhang Yao&#x27;er empress.

=== Emperor Wen ===

In 559, Chen Baxian fell ill, and the throne was passed to his nephew Chen Geng or Emperor Wen of Chen. Chen Geng eliminated separatist forces within the empire and reformed the former Liang&#x27;s policies, making the dynasty more stable. Over time, the economy of major cities was restored.

Emperor Wen honored Empress Zhang as empress dowager. He created his wife Princess Shen Miaorong empress and her son Chen Bozong crown prince. As he inherited the throne from Emperor Wu, he did not posthumously honor his father Chen Daotan as an emperor as might otherwise have been expected, but, in order to make sure that his father would be properly venerated (which would require Chen Daotan&#x27;s legal heir—Emperor Wen&#x27;s brother Chen Xu—to be present to offer sacrifices to him), he created his own son Chen Bomao (陳伯茂) the Prince of Shixing instead, and created Chen Xu, who was then still at Chang&#x27;an, the capital of Western Wei&#x27;s successor state Northern Zhou, the Prince of Ancheng. In 563, Emperor Wen himself began to offer sacrifices to Chen Daotan using ceremonies due to an emperor, but never honored his father as an emperor.

In the &quot;Book of Chen&quot;, the historian Yao Silian wrote about Emperor Wen (referring to Emperor Wen by his temple name Shizu):

:&quot;Shizu [Emperor Wen] grew up in difficult times, and he knew much about the people&#x27;s suffering. He was observant of things and frugal in his lifestyle. Ever night, he would order his servants to open the door to his sleeping quarters, to bring in the emergency submissions so that he could review them. He also ordered that his guards, whenever they were to change shifts, should throw their shift plates on the stone steps so that they would be loud enough to wake him.&quot;

Emperor Wen further solidified and unified the territory of Chen, helping the economy recover and flourish.

=== Emperor Chen Bozong ===
Emperor Wen was succeeded by Chen Bozong (Emperor Fei), who was then succeeded by Chen Xu (Emperor Xuan). Both Chen Bozong and Chen Xu were also very effective and capable rulers who further strengthened and expanded the state, rivaling and even defeating the Northern Zhou and Northern Qi.

In the ninth year of Taijian (太建 577), Northern Zhou dynasty destroyed Northern Qi. In the following year, Chen and Zhou launched a fierce battle in Luliang, Chen defeated the Zhou and made further advances north.

Chen Bozong married Empress Wang (Chen dynasty), and they had a son Chen Zhize. During his reign, important matters were also trusted to his uncle Chen Xu, as well as Kong, Dao Zhongju (到仲舉), Yuan Shu (袁樞), and Liu Shizhi (劉師知).

=== Emperor Xuan ===

Emperor Chen Xu married Liu Jingyan and had a son Chen Shubao. For reasons unclear in history, Chen Xu left the throne empty for more than a month, but finally took the throne in spring 569 (as Emperor Xuan). He honored Grand Empress Dowager Zhang as empress dowager instead, while Emperor Wen&#x27;s wife Empress Dowager Shen became known as Empress Wen. He created his wife Princess Liu empress and his heir apparent Chen Shubao crown emperor. Emperor Wen&#x27;s sons continued to have honored positions as imperial princes and held key posts, but none had particularly high power.

In fall 569, Emperor Xuan, suspicious that Ouyang He (歐陽紇) the governor of Guang Province (廣州 Guangzhou, Guangdong) would rebel, summoned Ouyang back to Jiankang. Ouyang was himself suspicious of Emperor Xuan&#x27;s intentions, and therefore refused the order and rebelled. Emperor Xuan sent the official Xu Jian (徐儉, Xu Ling&#x27;s son) to try to persuade Ouyang to change his mind, but Ouyang would not relent. Emperor Xuan then sent the general Zhang Zhaoda (章昭達) to attack Ouyang. By spring 570, Zhang captured Ouyang and delivered him to Jiankang, where Ouyang was beheaded. Zhang, encouraged by the victory, then attacked Western Liang&#x27;s capital Jiangling, but after some initial gains, nearly capturing Jiangling, he suffered defeats by the Northern Zhou general Lu Teng (陸騰) and withdrew. Despite this campaign, after this point on, Chen and Northern Zhou largely had peaceful relations, often exchanging embassies, forming an alliance against Northern Qi.

In spring 573, Emperor Xuan resolved to attack Northern Qi. Emperor Xuan, at the suggestion of Xu Ling, selected Wu Mingche, who alone among the generals was resolute as to his support for the campaign, as the commander of the forces, with Pei Ji (裴忌) and Huang Faqu as Wu&#x27;s deputies. Wu&#x27;s forces made quick gains against Northern Qi, and by summer 573 had gained most of the territory between the Yangtze River and the Huai River. By fall 573, Wu put the important city Shouyang (壽陽, Chen Lu&#x27;an, Anhui) under siege, and he captured Shouyang in 573, capturing and killing the Northern Qi general in charge of defending the city, the former Liang general Wang Lin. The entire region between the Yangtze and Huai was now in Chen hands. Emperor Xuan was so pleased that he, in an elaborate ceremony, conferred a variety of honors on Wu. He also displayed Wang&#x27;s head on the Jiankang city gate, although after a request by Zhu Yang (朱瑒), in which Zhu pointed out that Wang was faithful to Liang and should be honored, he returned Wang&#x27;s head for a proper burial. In the following years, Chen continued to make minor gains against Northern Qi, but was not making major attacks.

In winter 576, Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou launched a major attack on Northern Qi, quickly capturing, in succession, Northern Qi&#x27;s secondary capital Jinyang (晉陽, Chen Taiyuan, Shanxi) and capital Yecheng. Soon, he captured the Northern Qi emperor Gao Wei and annexed most of Northern Qi&#x27;s territory by spring 577.

Oddly enough, Emperor Xuan believed that he could seize part of Northern Qi territory after Northern Zhou&#x27;s victory, and he sent Wu Mingche to again advance north. In winter 577, Wu put Pengcheng (彭城, Chen Xuzhou, Jiangsu) under siege, and Emperor Xuan was confident that Wu would soon be able to capture the region south of the Yellow River. When the official Cai Jingli (蔡景歷) warned otherwise, he was so displeased that he demoted Cai to the post of a commandery governor. In spring 578, the Northern Zhou general Wang Gui (王軌) thoroughly crushed Wu, capturing him. Regretting his actions, Emperor Xuan recalled Cai to the capital. With the people&#x27;s hearts shaken by the great defeat, in fall 578, Emperor Xuan held a ceremony in which the officials reaffirmed their loyalty to the state.

In winter 579, Emperor Xuan of Northern Zhou launched an attack on Chen, commanded by the general Wei Xiaokuan. Chen&#x27;s Emperor Xuan mobilized his troops to resist. However, all of the cities that they had captured from Northern Qi previously quickly fell. By new year 580, nearly all of the territory north of the Yangtze had fallen to Northern Zhou, leading to a large wave of refugees who fled across the Yangtze to Chen territory.

In summer 580, Northern Zhou&#x27;s Emperor Xuan died suddenly, and his father-in-law Yang Jian seized power as regent. The generals Yuchi Jiong rose against Yang, and he was joined by the generals Sima Xiaonan (司馬消難) and Wang Qian (王謙). Sima, the governor of Xun Province (勛州, Chen Xiaogan, Hubei) and the nine surrounding provinces, soon surrendered to Chen, seeking Chen aid. Emperor Xuan sent the generals Fan Yi (樊毅), Ren Zhong (任忠), and Chen Huiji (陳慧紀) to attack Northern Zhou&#x27;s southern provinces to aid Sima, whom he created the Duke of Sui. However, Wei Xiaokuan quickly defeated Yuchi, forcing Yuchi to commit suicide, and Sima&#x27;s own forces collapsed. He was forced to flee to Chen territory, and all of the territory he controlled was retained by Northern Zhou. Yang Jian soon seized the throne in spring 581, destroying the Northern Zhou and establishing the Sui dynasty.

In spring 582, Emperor Xuan died. After a failed attempt by his son Chen Shuling (陳叔陵), allied with Emperor Wen&#x27;s son Chen Bogu (陳伯固), to seize the throne, Crown Prince Shubao took the throne.

=== Last emperor: Chen Shubao ===

Initially, Chen Shubao was still recovering from his injuries, and Empress Dowager Liu governed as regent, assisted by Chen Shujian. As Chen Shubao did not favor Empress Shen, she was not allowed to attend to him during his recovery period. Rather, Consort Zhang did. After Chen Shubao recovered, Empress Dowager Liu returned imperial authorities to him and did not again govern.

When Emperor Xuan died, Northern Zhou&#x27;s successor state, the Sui dynasty, had been attacking, but upon hearing about Emperor Xuan&#x27;s death, Emperor Wen of Sui (Yang Jian) decided that it was improper to attack a state that had just lost its emperor and withdrew his forces. He also sent ambassadors to mourn Emperor Xuan&#x27;s death, and his letter to Chen Shubao referred to himself by his personal name—a sign of humility. Chen Shubao&#x27;s return letter included the sentence, &quot;May it be that when you govern your state, all things can be well, and that between heaven and earth, there will be peace and quiet.&quot; The states exchanged ambassadors often and generally had peaceful relations, although Sui&#x27;s Emperor Wen was gradually building up military power on the Yangtze.

In spring 583, displeased that Chen Shujian was becoming overly powerful, Chen Shubao, encouraged by his associates Kong Fan () and Shi Wenqing (), made Chen Shujian the governor of Jiang Province (江州, Chen Jiujiang, Jiangxi) to remove him from power. He subsequently kept Chen Shujian at the capital by promoting him to the honorary post of &quot;Sikong&quot; (). Meanwhile, despite the fact that Chen Shubao was still supposed to be in mourning period for Emperor Xuan, he was spending much time in feasting. When the official Mao Xi () tried to persuade him to change his ways, Chen Shubao demoted Mao and sent him out of the capital.

Around the new year 584, Chen Shujian, prayed that he would be restored to grace. When this was discovered, Chen Shubao considered executing Chen Shujian, but after Chen Shujian reminded him how Chen Shujian was responsible for saving him from Chen Shuling, Chen Shubao spared him but removed him from his posts.

In 584, Chen Shubao built three particularly luxurious pavilions within his palace—Linchun Pavilion (), Jieqi Pavilion (), and Wangxian Pavilion (), residing himself at Linchun Pavilion, while having Consort Zhang reside at Jieqi Pavilion and Consorts Gong and Kong share Wangxian Pavilion. He often spent his days feasting with his concubines, headed by Consort Zhang, as well as those ladies in waiting and officials who had literary talent (including Jiang Zong, whom he made prime minister, Kong Fan, and Wang Cuo ), having those officials and ladies in waiting sing or write poetry to praise his concubines&#x27; beauty. Two of the particularly known songs, &quot;Yushu Houting Hua&quot; () and &quot;Linchun Yue&quot; (), were written to praise the beauties of Consorts Zhang and Kong.

Chen Shubao would often hold Consort Zhang on his lap and have Consort Zhang, who was considered intelligent, read and rule on the petitions submitted to him. Meanwhile, Consort Kong and Kong Fan, who were not related, began to refer to each other as sister and brother, and used their relationship to further their power as well, so Consorts Zhang and Kong became exceedingly powerful. To finance Chen Shubao&#x27;s construction projects, taxes were raised, and soldiers and the officials, who were previously immune to taxes, were also required to pay them, causing general discontent from those classes. Further, at Kong Fan&#x27;s urging, Chen Shubao transferred much of the military command to civilian officials, further causing the generals to be disgruntled.

In spring 585, Zhang Dabao () the governor of Feng Province (豐州, Chen Fuzhou, Fujian), accused of corruption and on the verge of being replaced by Li Yun (), instead ambushed Li and killed him, starting a rebellion. However, Zhang was soon defeated and killed.

In fall 587, while Emperor Jing of Western Liang was at the Sui capital to meet with Sui&#x27;s Emperor Wen, the Western Liang officials Xiao Yan (蕭巖, Emperor Jing&#x27;s uncle) and Xiao Huan (蕭瓛, Emperor Jing&#x27;s brother), in fear that the Sui general Cui Hongdu () was actually intending to attack the Western Liang capital Jiangling, surrendered to Chen Shubao&#x27;s cousin Chen Huiji () the Marquess of Yihuang with the people of Jiangling. Chen Shubao accepted the surrender and made Xiao Yan and Xiao Huan provincial governors.

In spring 588, Chen Shubao, believing Consorts Zhang&#x27;s and Kong&#x27;s accusations that Chen Yin resented him for not favoring Empress Shen, deposed Chen Yin and created him the Prince of Wuxing, instead creating Consort Zhang&#x27;s son Chen Yuan crown prince. He also considered deposing Empress Shen and replacing her with Consort Zhang, but did not get a chance to do so before Sui launched a major attack in spring 588 as well. By winter 588, the Sui attack was in full operation, with three major prongs commanded by Emperor Wen&#x27;s sons, Yang Guang (later Emperor Yang of Sui) and Yang Jun, and Yang Su, and with Yang Guang in overall command of the operation, assisted by Gao Jiong. Reports from the upper Yangtze, however, were being suppressed by Shi Wenqing and Shen Keqing () and never reached Chen Shubao, as Shi, not realizing the seriousness of the Sui threat, did not want anything to interfere with his own plans to become the governor of Xiang Province (湘州, Chen Changsha, Hunan). Yang Su, who attacked from the upper Yangtze, therefore faced no serious opposition and soon controlled the upper Yangtze, not allowing any Chen forces which might have wanted to head downstream to aid the capital to be able to get through.
In spring 589, the Sui general Heruo Bi () crossed the Yangtze from Guangling (廣陵, Chen Yangzhou, Jiangsu), and the Sui general Han Qinhu () crossed the Yangtze at Caishi (采石, Chen Ma&#x27;anshan, Anhui), without opposition from Chen forces and sandwiching the Chen capital Jiankang. Only then did Chen Shubao realize the seriousness of the situation, but instead of resisting in earnest, he panicked, leaving Shi in effective control of the situation. Eventually, the general Xiao Mohe convinced Chen Shubao that he should be allowed to engage Heruo, despite opposition from the general Ren Zhong (). Heruo defeated Xiao Mohe and captured him, and the rest of Chen troops collapsed, allowing the Sui forces to enter the capital. In panic and abandoned by his officials, Chen Shubao hid in a well with Consorts Zhang and Kong, but was discovered and captured. When he was brought before Heruo Bi, he was so fearful that he prostrated himself before Heruo Bi act that brought words of contempt from Heruo. However, he and his household were generally treated well by the Sui generals, although Gao, blaming Consort Zhang for Chen&#x27;s collapse, executed her. Some of the Chen generals continued to resist, but were quickly defeated, particularly because at the Sui forces&#x27; request, Chen Shubao wrote letters to the Chen generals ordering them to surrender. Chen was at its end. Soon, the Sui army escorted Chen Shubao and his household to the Sui capital Daxing (大興, near Chang&#x27;an).

=== Sui-Tang dynasties ===
In the north, a new power emerged, the Sui dynasty. The Sui destroyed the Northern Zhou and eventually absorbed the Chen dynasty in 589. Chen Shubao was the last ruler of the Chen dynasty, and his family held high positions in the Sui royal court. The Sui was an important dynasty for subjugating the East Tujue, Tuyuhun, and Goguryeo to the north and east as well as starting the Grand Canal project, much of which was based in Chen dynasty territory. Many members of the Chen royal family became high-ranking officers or married into the Yang ruling family of the Sui dynasty, such as Consort Chen (Wen).

The Sui also suppressed the Rau peoples to the south, who had resumed raids against the region of Jiaozhi (Vietnam). From 590 to 618, the short-lived Sui dynasty experienced numerous rebellions, not just from the former Chen territory, but also the Wang, Liu, and Li clans. Sui general Yang Su tried to suppress the rebellions in the early 590s, but eventually the Sui collapsed, and Yang Su&#x27;s sons were executed. Li Yuan then murdered the last emperor Yang You of the Sui dynasty and founded the Tang dynasty.

During the Tang, numerous members of the former Chen family became high-ranked officials in the Tang court, with some like Chen Shuda holding powerful political offices.

== Culture ==
Jiankang, the capital, was an important cultural, political and religious center, attracting businessmen and Buddhist monks from Southeast Asia and India. The culture of the Southern dynasties reached their apex during the Chen dynasty. In literature, Xu Ling (徐陵) was an influential writer during the Chen dynasty, with his literary collection &quot;New Songs of Yutai&quot; being passed down for generations. One of the most famous chapters from New Songs of Yutai is &quot;Peacock Flying Southeast&quot; (《孔雀东南飞》). In art, Yao Zui&#x27;s (姚最) &quot;Continued Paintings&quot; has the greatest influence.

Once Chen Baxian became emperor he immediately took steps to officially sanction Buddhism, as he displayed a relic believed to be a Buddha&#x27;s tooth and held a major Buddhist festival. He also, following the lead of Liang&#x27;s Emperor Wu, offered himself to Buddha&#x27;s service on one occasion. He made several requests to Western Wei&#x27;s successor state Northern Zhou to return Chen Chang and Chen Xu, and while Northern Zhou promised to do so, they would actually not be returned in Emperor Wu&#x27;s lifetime.

Chen dynasty emperors including Chen Baxian claimed descent from the legendary Emperor Shun.

==Emperors of Chen dynasty (557–589)==
== Family tree ==
== Marriage ==
More than fifty percent of Tuoba Xianbei princesses of the Northern Wei were married to southern Han Chinese men from the imperial families and aristocrats from southern China of the Southern dynasties who defected and moved north to join the Northern Wei. Tuoba Xianbei Princess Nanyang (南阳长公主) was married to Xiao Baoyin (萧宝夤), a Han Chinese member of Southern Qi royalty.

==Notable descendants==
* The ancestors of the Ho dynasty of Vietnam claim descent from the Chen dynasty, as well as the Chen (state)

<text>Herbert Eser Gray (May 25, 1931 – April 21, 2014) was a Canadian lawyer who became a prominent federal politician. He was a Liberal member of parliament for the Windsor area over the course of four decades, from 1962 to 2002, making Gray one of the longest-serving members in Canadian history. He was a cabinet minister under three prime ministers and was the seventh deputy prime minister of Canada from 1997 to 2002. Gray was Canada&#x27;s first Jewish federal cabinet minister, and he is one of the few Canadians granted the honorific &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; who was not so entitled by virtue of a position held.

==Early life and education==
Gray was born in Windsor, Ontario, the son of Fannie (née Lifitz), a nurse, and Harry Gray, who had a business selling yard goods. His parents were both from Belarusian Jewish families. Gray attended Victoria School and Kennedy Collegiate Institute in Windsor before receiving a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1952 from McGill University. He studied at Osgoode Hall Law School, where he received a Bachelor of Laws degree and was called to the bar, becoming a member of the Law Society of Upper Canada.

On July 23, 1967, Gray married Sharon Sholzberg, also a lawyer. They had two children together – Jonathan David and Elizabeth Anne.

==Politics==
Gray was first elected to Parliament for the riding of Essex West on June 18, 1962, as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. He was re-elected in twelve subsequent federal elections, making him the longest continuously-serving Member of Parliament in Canadian history.
Gray served in a variety of roles during his parliamentary career, including cabinet ministries and committee chairmanships during the Liberal governments of Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau, and as opposition House leader from 1984 to 1990.

From February 6, 1990, to December 21, 1990, he was Leader of the Opposition, during John Turner&#x27;s last four months as Liberal leader and the first few months of Jean Chrétien&#x27;s leadership, until the latter won a by-election to Parliament.

When the Liberals returned to power after the 1993 election, Gray was appointed Leader of the Government in the House of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada. On June 11, 1997, he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister of Canada.

Gray also retained an interest in provincial politics in the Windsor area. In 1996, he was named as honorary co-chair of Dwight Duncan&#x27;s bid to the lead the provincial Liberal Party. Duncan had previously worked in Gray&#x27;s office.

==Retirement and death==

Gray retired from Parliament on January 14, 2002, and was appointed Canadian Chair of the International Joint Commission, a bilateral organization which deals with Canada-United States trans-boundary issues on water and air rights.

On November 28, 2008, Carleton University announced that Gray had been appointed as the university&#x27;s 10th chancellor. He died in hospital in Ottawa on April 21, 2014, aged 82.

==Honours==
On January 15, 2002, then-Governor General of Canada Adrienne Clarkson granted Gray the style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;, in honour of his distinguished and record-setting contribution to Canadian political life. In 2003, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, a designation which can be bestowed on only 165 outstanding Canadians at any given time, in recognition of being &quot;an enduring force in Canadian politics&quot;. He was a recipient of the Canadian Centennial Medal, the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal, the 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal, Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal. He received honorary degrees from the University of Windsor, Assumption University (Windsor), Catholic University of Lublin (Poland), McGill University, and the University of Ottawa, and Honorary Lifetime Membership as Governor #71 with Junior Chamber International Canada (JCI Canada). In 2009, he became an honorary brother of Alpha Epsilon Pi. 

The extension of Highway 401 in Windsor (originally the &quot;Windsor-Essex Parkway&quot;) was renamed the Right Honourable Herb Gray Parkway on November 28, 2012.

==Personal life==
Gray was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in 1996 and recovered after radiation therapy. In 1999, he had an operation to treat a prostate condition unrelated to the cancer. In August 2001, Gray underwent valve replacement surgery to correct a heart condition he had known about for years.

<text>Lloyd Biggle Jr. (April 17, 1923 – September 12, 2002) was an American musician, author, and oral historian.

==Biography==
Biggle was born in 1923 in Waterloo, Iowa. He served in World War II as a communications sergeant in a rifle company of the 102nd Infantry Division; during the war, he was wounded twice. His second wound, a shrapnel wound in his leg received near the Elbe River at the end of the war, left him disabled for life.

After the war, Biggle resumed his education. He received an A.B. Degree with High Distinction from Wayne State University and M.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan. Biggle taught at the University of Michigan and at Eastern Michigan University in the 1950s. He began writing professionally in 1955 and became a full-time writer with the publication of his novel, &quot;All the Colors of Darkness&quot; in 1963; he continued in the writing profession until his death.

==Career==
Biggle was celebrated in science fiction circles as the author who introduced aesthetics into a literature known for its scientific and technological complications. His stories frequently used musical and artistic themes. Such notables as songwriter Jimmy Webb and novelist Orson Scott Card have written of the tremendous effect that his early story, &quot;The Tunesmith&quot;, had on them in their youth. Among Biggle&#x27;s enduring science fiction creations were the matter-transmission trouble-shooting team of Jan Darzek/Effie Schlupe, and the Cultural Survey, featured in novels and magazine stories, through which Biggle explored issues of multi-culturalism and technology.

In the field of mystery writing, Biggle&#x27;s &quot;Grandfather Rastin&quot; stories appeared for many years in &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;. He loved writing historical fiction set in late Victorian and Edwardian England. He wrote a series of new Sherlock Holmes stories from the perspective of Edward Porter Jones, an assistant who began his association with Holmes as a &quot;Baker Street Irregular&quot;; several stories, including &quot;The Quallsford Inheritance&quot; and &quot;The Glendower Conspiracy&quot;, feature Jones and Holmes. These were followed by a series of stories featured in &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; starring Biggle&#x27;s Victorian sleuth, Lady Sara Varnley.

Some of Biggle&#x27;s science fiction and mystery stories were nominated for the 1962 Hugo for short fiction and also for the Locus Readers awards in 1972, 1973, and 1974. He published two dozen books as well as magazine stories and numerous articles. His last novel was &quot;The Chronocide Mission&quot;. He was writing almost to the moment of his death. &quot;I can write them faster than the magazines can publish them,&quot; he once said, and indeed, magazines continued to publish backlogged stories of his well after his death. Few of his works have been in print since the early 2000s, but most of his novels are available as e-books.

Biggle was the founding secretary-treasurer of the Science Fiction Writers of America and served as chairman of its trustees for many years. In the 1970s, he founded the Science Fiction Oral History Association, which built archives containing hundreds of cassette tapes of science fiction notables making speeches and discussing aspects of their craft. He numbered many of these science fiction notables among his friends, and his article in the July/August 2002 &quot;Analog Magazine&quot;, &quot;Isaac Asimov Remembered&quot;, was based in part on his personal recollections of that celebrity.

He was a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, and the Military Order of the Purple Heart.

He died from leukemia and cancer.

<doc id="432308" wikidata="Q4586222" url="?curid=432308" title="1990 Plainfield tornado">
<text>The 1990 Plainfield tornado was a devastating tornado that occurred on the afternoon of Tuesday, August 28, 1990. The violent tornado killed 29 people and injured 353. It is the only F5/EF5 rated tornado ever officially recorded in August in the United States (the 1883 Rochester, Minnesota cyclone is unofficially considered an F5), and the only F5 tornado to strike the Chicago area. There are no known videos or photographs of the tornado itself; however, in 2011, a video surfaced online showing the supercell that spawned the tornado. The Plainfield tornado was part of a small outbreak that produced several tornadoes in the Northern United States, specifically Kansas, and the Canadian province of Ontario.

The tornado was relatively abnormal, moving southeast instead of the conventional northeast motion of violent tornadoes. The event, as well as its poor warning time, drove advancements in radar technology and forecasting systems to adequately warn residents.

== Atmospheric conditions ==
For late August standards, August 28 was a particularly warm and humid day. Temperatures reached into the low 90s °F (32–34 °C; about 11 °F or 6 °C warmer than the normal of 79 °F – 26 °C), but dew points soared into the upper 70s °F (25–27 °C). The presence of such a high dew point did not necessarily predict a severe thunderstorm outbreak; the prior day, similar conditions existed in northern Illinois with the exception of a warmer mid level troposphere. A warmer atmosphere inhibits the rising of surface air through the atmosphere; a requirement for convective precipitation (precipitation resulting from humid surface air ascending to condense in a cooler atmosphere above) to occur. This warmer air aloft can describe either (or both) weak lapse rates, thus weak instability or a capping inversion.

The atmosphere on August 28 was significantly more unstable as the approach of a low-pressure system from the northwest cooled the mid levels (and also caused dynamic lifting) as instability continued to build in the capped, muggy environment, although the wind fields (strong, but out of the west-northwest and unidirectional) were not suitable for significant tornadic development. As a result of the very high low-level temperature and dew point, convective available potential energy (CAPE) values were in excess of 8,000 J/kg; generally, values of 1,500 J/kg are considered to be moderately unstable, whereas values of more than 4,000 J/kg are considered &quot;extreme&quot;. The lifted index (LI), the dominant estimate of instability used at the time, was also extreme. Generally, an LI value of −6 °C or below readily supports severe thunderstorm development, but during the day the LI value ranged from −12 °C to −14 °C. Such extreme instability can lead to explosive thunderstorm development, very strong updrafts, and modulates the updraft to better enable tornadogenesis.

Conditions were ripe for severe thunderstorm development, and with both low level and high level steering winds from the west-northwest, the National Severe Storms Forecast Center issued a Severe Thunderstorm Watch for northern Illinois valid 1:30 p.m. through 8:00 p.m. CDT that night. The NSSFC predicted a derecho-type event for later that night as rapidly developing thunderstorms along a cold front in Wisconsin would be carried by the steering flow into the Chicago area. One of these storms developed supercellular characteristics south of Rockford, steering 30 to 40 degrees to the right of prevailing steering winds. By now, mid-level steering winds had begun to veer, causing a wind profile slightly more favorable for tornadic development. This helped develop a high precipitation supercell.

The &quot;HP&quot; supercell produced multiple funnel sightings, hail damage, and damaging winds south of Rockford before heading southeast toward Will County and dropped a rain wrapped tornado. This is why many in the path did not see the actual tornado but more of a wall of water and dark clouds coming toward them. As the storm continued south it produced a swath of damage ranging from F1 to F5 intensity. The National Weather Service in Rosemont, Illinois, serving all of Central and Northern Illinois at the time, did not issue a Tornado Warning until 10 minutes after the tornado had hit Plainfield. Despite radar technology being less developed than now, the storm had a well defined hook echo on radar imagery, a signature often correlated with tornadic supercells.

==Event summary==
The tornado formed from a supercell thunderstorm, which initially formed in the vicinity of Janesville in south central Wisconsin, shortly after 12 p.m. CDT. It produced a tornado near Pecatonica, Illinois in Winnebago County, about west of Rockford, that touched down at about 1:42 p.m. CDT. That tornado did not last long; however, the storm continued to move southeast towards the Aurora area, and spawned four short-lived, predecessor tornadoes in southwestern Kane County, between 2:45 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. Within that time period, the storm also struck the Aurora Municipal Airport in Sugar Grove at about 3:05 p.m., lasting until 3:10 p.m., where propeller planes were flipped, and the control tower was evacuated, but no injuries were reported.

Continuing to move to the southeast, starting at about 3:15 p.m., the supercell spawned the principal tornado, touching down near Oswego in Kendall County, and rapidly strengthening into a F2 and F3 tornado as it approached Will County. The tornado traveled southeast into Wheatland Township, Will County, near the Wheatland Plains subdivision, northwest of Plainfield. At 3:25 p.m. CDT in Wheatland Township, the tornado damaged nearly all of the homes in the Wheatland Plains subdivision where there were several injuries, including one child who had to be airlifted to Loyola University Hospital in Maywood and later died of injuries. Twelve homes were destroyed in Wheatland Plains.

Past Wheatland Plains, the tornado continued to strengthen as it tore across open farmland, and reached F5 intensity in this area. A narrow swath of very intense ground scouring was observed, as mature corn crop was completely stripped from the ground, leaving nothing but bare soil behind. Several inches of topsoil were removed as well. As the tornado crossed US-30, a 20-ton tractor-trailer was thrown more than half a mile from the road, killing the driver. Three other motorists were killed in this area as their vehicles were thrown from the road. Some cars were picked up and carried considerable distances through the air. It was determined that the tornado reached its peak strength in this area, and the F5 rating was based on the extreme ground scouring that occurred. Beyond this point, the ground scouring became less pronounced as the tornado weakened slightly as it approached Plainfield at high-end F4 intensity.

The tornado struck Plainfield, Illinois, around 3:28 p.m. Around 3:30 p.m. the tornado directly struck the Plainfield High School, killing a science teacher and two maintenance workers. Students who had been out practicing for the fall football programs ran into the high school to take shelter a few minutes before the storm hit. After an alarm was pulled by a dean in the main office, the volleyball players preparing for a game in the gymnasium rushed to the nearest door and took shelter in the hallway. It has been reported that as soon as the last player was through the door, a coach quickly closed it, only for it to be immediately ripped back off by the storm. The gymnasium proceeded to fall apart and crash down, which filled the gap in the doorway. They took shelter in the same hallway as the football team, and once the tornado had passed, that was the only hallway left standing in the building.

The tornado then demolished the Plainfield School District Administration building, where the wife of a custodian was killed. The tornado crossed Route 59 (Division Street) and ripped into St. Mary Immaculate Church and school, claiming an additional 3 lives; the principal of the school, a music teacher, and the son of the cook at the rectory. Fifty-five homes were destroyed in Plainfield itself, a few of which were swept away. A grocery store east of the high school was badly damaged. Gravestones in the nearby cemetery were toppled, and a metal dumpster was found wrapped around the top of a partially debarked tree. Damage in Plainfield was rated as high-end F4.

The storm then worked its way southeast towards the large city of Joliet, damaging homes in the Crystal Lawns, Lily Cache and Warwick subdivisions and killing five more people: one in the Lily Cache subdivision of Plainfield, and two each in the Crystal Lawns and Warwick subdivisions; an additional three people would later succumb from injuries sustained during the storm. The tornado ripped through the Grand Prairie Elementary School (Plainfield School District), causing significant damage. Observers watched from the doors at the Louis Joliet Mall, as the tornado passed just southwest of them. Sixty-nine homes were destroyed in Crystal Lawns, 75 homes were destroyed in Peerless Estates, 55 homes were destroyed in Lily Cache, and 50 homes were destroyed in Warwick. Most of the homes in Peerless Estates and Warwick were newly built.

The tornado then moved towards Crest Hill. At 3:38 p.m. the storm ripped through the Crest Hill Lakes Apartment complex, where it caused F3 damage and claimed another eight lives, destroying one apartment building and half of another apartment building. Neither have been rebuilt. The tornado also ripped through the Colony West subdivision, destroying 12 townhomes, none of which have been rebuilt either. A married couple died while in their car on Cedarwood Drive outside the apartment complex. The tornado then destroyed three apartment buildings on Elizabeth Court. Three more homes were destroyed in Bridalwreath, southeast of Elizabeth Court. Homes were damaged on Arden Place, and two high tension wire structures were destroyed at Douglas Street and Palladium Drive West.

Further southeast, the tornado continued to lose strength and lifted near Woodlawn Avenue and Campbell Street in Joliet. The parent thunderstorm continued until it crossed over the Indiana border, where it dissipated around 4:30 p.m.

The Plainfield Tornado caused over $165 million worth of damage. As the storm tore through Plainfield, nine people were killed (one additional victim would die afterward, from carbon monoxide poisoning, while guarding his home after the storm). The remaining victims were from Joliet and Crest Hill. In all, a total of 29 people would die because of the tornado. A total of 353 people were also injured in storm. This was the deadliest tornado event in the region since the 1967 Oak Lawn tornado.

== Aftermath ==

=== Tornado preparedness ===
The Plainfield Tornado challenged both meteorologists and citizens in terms of tornado preparedness. Substantial safety measures have been enacted in the years following the tornado; among the improvements are frequent and regular tornado drills performed in schools.

After the tornado, meteorologists studying tornadic patterns in the area found that a major tornado (F3 or higher) strikes Will County about every 12 to 15 years. There have been no major tornadoes in the county since 1990. However, an F1 tornado swept through the historic Cathedral Area in the near west side of Joliet on April 20, 2004. The most recent major tornado to strike the Chicago metropolitan area was an EF3 tornado that struck just north of the county line with DuPage county on June 20, 2021.

=== Deployment of NEXRAD ===
The development of NEXRAD (Next Generation Radar) has contributed greatly to the ability of meteorologists to recognize tornadic activity. Whereas previous generations of radar could show only reflectivity data and no direct information on air flows, although tornadic supercells and tornadic signatures such as the hook echo and bounded weak echo region (BWER) were identifiable, NEXRAD contained the ability to detect the wind speed and direction inside the storm. The ability to see rotation inside a storm on both the microscale (tornadic) and mesoscale (supercellular) measurements has allowed forecasters to issue severe thunderstorm and tornado warnings in more timely fashion and with a higher probability of detection.

=== Forecast criticism ===
In the months following the tornado, the National Weather Service was heavily criticized for providing no warning of the approaching tornado. The NOAA Disaster Survey Report was highly critical of the forecast process within the Chicago office as well as coordination with local spotter networks and the preparedness of these groups. Prior to 1990, the National Weather Service in Chicago was responsible for providing forecasts for the entire state of Illinois.

As the Chicago office was overwhelmed with its workload, no warnings were issued by the office until 2:32 p.m. – nearly an hour after the first tornado was sighted southeast of Rockford. A second severe thunderstorm warning was issued almost an hour later at 3:23 p.m., but this provided no indication that a tornado was on the ground and did not mention the area where the tornado had tracked. No tornado warning was issued until after the tornado lifted. Even though the Chicago office had an &quot;add-on&quot; Doppler improvement that was developed in 1974, that device had been disabled by a lightning strike before the August 28 storm.

As a result of the lack of a warning, many meteorologists today refer to the &quot;Plainfield Syndrome&quot; as the idea that it&#x27;s better to issue too many warnings and be wrong, than to miss one critical warning, as was the case for the Plainfield Tornado.

After the 1990 tornado, the National Weather Service reduced the Chicago office&#x27;s workload by creating an office in Romeoville, Illinois in 1993, as well as in Lincoln, Illinois in 1995, and allowing offices in the Quad Cities, St. Louis, Missouri, Indianapolis, Indiana and Paducah, Kentucky to issue forecasts for their respective areas.

===Memorial Site===
In the years following the disaster, a permanent Tornado Plainfield Victim Memorial located in Plainfield, Illinois was erected, thanking those who aided in its recovery. A dedication ceremony is held at this location where hundreds gather every year, including both survivors and victims&#x27; family members. The 30th anniversary memorial was held at this location on August 28, 2020, as church bells rang at exactly 3:28 PM.

<doc id="432313" wikidata="Q2462108" url="?curid=432313" title="Tara (Mahavidya)">
<text>In the Shaivism and Shaktism tradition of Hinduism, the goddess Tara (, ) is the second of the ten Mahavidyas. She is considered a form of Adishakti, the tantric manifestation of Parvati. Her three most famous forms are Ekajaṭā, Ugratara, and Nīlasarasvatī (also spelled Neelasaraswati, Neela Saraswati, or Neelsaraswati). Her most famous centre of worship is the temple and the cremation ground of Tarapith in West Bengal, India. 

==Legends==
The commonly known origin of Tara is from the 17th chapter of the &quot;Rudrayāmala&quot; which describes the initial unsuccessful attempts of the sage Vasiṣṭha in worshipping Tara, and the subsequent meeting with the god Vishnu in the form of Buddha in the region called Mahācīna (China) and his eventual success by the means of &quot;kaula&quot; rites. She is also described as the form of the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;. Her Bhairava is named Akṣobhya. According to the &quot;Svatantratantra&quot;, Tara protects her devotees from difficult (ugra) dangers and so she is also known as Ugratārā. The goddess is all-pervading and also manifests on Earth. 

== Historical origin ==

Tara-related beliefs are probably an amalgamation of the beliefs linked to Bhīmā or Nīlā in the geographical region of Oḍḍiyāna which has experienced Buddhist and possibly Taoist influence. The syncretism between Shaivist and Buddhist cults created a congenial atmosphere for the formation of the traditions of Tārā, both a Hindu and a Buddhist goddess. Her pleasant forms were popular amongst the Buddhists, while the cult of Bhīmā-Ekajaṭā was popular mainly amongst the Shaivas, from whom it merged into Vajrayana Buddhism until it was reintroduced by Vasiṣtha from Mahācīna, which is identified on the basis of the Śaktisaṅgamatantra as a small geographical entity between Kailasa, South East of the lake Manasarovar and near Lake Rakshas Tal, or alternatively located somewhere in Central Asia. Some of the forms of the deity like Mahācīnakrama Tara, also known as Ugra-Tara, are worshipped in both Hindu and Buddhist systems. Her &quot;sādhanā&quot; described by Śāśvatavajra, which was included in the Buddhist collection of sadhanas called the Sādhanāśatapañcāśikā, which was incorporated in the &quot;Phetkarīyatantra&quot; and was quoted in tantric manuals like the &quot;Bṛhat-tantrasāra&quot; by Kṛṣṇānanda Agamavāgīśa with some aspects of the iconography and the subsequent interpretations differing between the Hindu and Buddhist systems.

== Iconography ==

Tara is often described in these chapters as a fierce deity, holding kartrī (knife), &quot;khaḍga&quot; (sword), &quot;chamara&quot; (Fly-whisk) or &quot;indivara&quot; (lotus) and a single matted braid over her head. She is dark in complexion, tall, with a bulging belly, wears tiger pelts, with her left foot on the chest of Shiva and her right foot placed between his thigh and knee. She has a terrifying laugh and is fearsome. The goddess Tīkṣṇakāntā, who is also considered a form of Tara in the &quot;Kalika Purana&quot;, has similar iconography with dark-complexion and a single braid (ekajaṭā), and is also pot-bellied.

Hindu goddess Kali and Tara are similar in appearance. They both are described as standing upon a supine corpse sometimes identified with Shiva. However, while Kali is described as black, Tara is described as blue. Both wear minimal clothing, however Tara wears a tiger-skin skirt, while Kali wears only a girdle of severed human arms. Both wear a garland of severed human heads. Both have a lolling tongue, and blood oozes from their mouths. Their appearances are so strikingly similar that it is easy to mistake one for the other. Tara is shown standing in the &quot;pratyalidha&quot; stance (in which the left foot is forward). Her Bhairava (consort) is Akshobhya, a form of Shiva who is in the form of a naga (serpent) coiled around her matted hair. She wears a crown made of 5 skulls connected with plates of bone. Eight forms of Tara are attested in the &quot;Māyātantra&quot; quoted in the tantric compendium &quot;Tantrasāra&quot; and the names are Ekajaṭa, Ugra-Tara, Mahogra, Kameshvari-Tara, Chamunda, Nila-Sarasvati (Neelasaraswati or &#x27;Blue Saraswati&#x27;), Vajra-Tara and Bhadrakali.

== Scriptures ==
Tantric scriptures that describe the worship of Tara include &quot;Tārātantra&quot;, &quot;Brahmayāmala,&quot; &quot;Rudrayāmala,&quot; &quot;Nīlatantra&quot;/&quot;Bṛhannīlatantra&quot;, &quot;Tārātantra&quot;, &quot;Nīlasarasvatītantra&quot; as well as various tantric compendia like &quot;Tantrasara&quot; by Agamavagisha, &quot;Prāṇatoṣiṇī&quot;, &quot;Tārābhaktisudhārṇava&quot; by Narasiṃha Thakkura, or &quot;Tārārahasya&quot; by Brahmānanda Giri.

Tara is mentioned in the &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot;, where it is said that her favourite place is Cīna (China) and also that Svarocisha Manu worshipped the deity on the banks of the Kalindi (Yamuna). She is also attested in the &quot;Kalika Purana&quot;&#x27;s 61st, 79th and 80th chapter. 

== Modern traditions ==
In Bengal, the literary works of Ramprasad Sen gave a new phase to the classical secretive worship of Tara, and his devotionalism influenced the image of the deity. He addresses Tara as a daughter in his songs. Sadhak Bamakhepa also was a famous siddha of Tara in the modern era. These devotees introduced a public devotional dimension to the secretive tantric worship of this deity and emphasised her motherliness.

<doc id="432314" wikidata="Q907357" url="?curid=432314" title="Monolith Productions">
<text>Monolith Productions, Inc. was an American video game developer based in Kirkland, Washington. The company has been a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Games since August 2004. It formerly published third-party games in the 1990s. In February 2025 it was reported that Warner Bros. Games had decided to close the studio.

== History ==
Monolith Productions was founded on October 25, 1994 by Bryan Bouwman, Toby Gladwell, Brian Goble, Jace Hall, Garrett Price, Paul Renault, and Brian Waite. Co-founder Brian Goble had this to say regarding the company name.
Several of the founders, include Hall, were employees of software company Edmark at the time, and the group had gotten together frequently to play games like &quot;Doom&quot;. Several felt they could try their own hand at making video games. To promote their initial ideas, they took advantage of the Redbook audio format for compact discs that allowed both audio and digital files to be stored on the same media. Hall left Edmark to start promotion of the company, and ended up with Microsoft, which was preparing for the release of Windows 95. Microsoft brough on Monolith to develop gaming CDs to demonstrate the capabilities of Windows 95 and DirectX, with the remaining founders quitting Edmark and working out of offices at Microsoft&#x27;s campus in Redmond, Washington.

Hall used the gaming CDs to continue to build out a list of contacts for future expansion. This led to a significant investment from Japanese print publisher Takarajimasha, allowing Monolith to establish their own set of offices and bring on more staff to do full-time production by 1996. Initial work was done towards &quot;Claw&quot;, a game based on a shelved project by Garrett. During development, Monolith acquired Q Studios, a development team led by a friend Nick Neilhard. At the time, Q Studios was finishing work on &quot;Blood&quot;, and &quot;Blood&quot; replaced &quot;Doom&quot; as Monolith&#x27;s go-to game. Monolith focused on getting &quot;Blood&quot; released first, as it was one of the last games to use the 2.5D Build engine rather than true 3D game engines.
The company is best known for the &quot;Blood&quot;, &quot;No One Lives Forever&quot; and &quot;F.E.A.R&quot; series. Monolith developed the LithTech game engine which was used for most of their games starting with &quot;&quot; in September 1998. Between 1997 and 1999, Monolith also published games–some developed by the studio, some by third parties.

In 2004, Monolith Productions was acquired by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (now Warner Bros. Games).

In 2014, the company released the title &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor&quot; with a sequel entitled &quot;Middle-earth: Shadow of War&quot; being released in 2017.

In 2021, the company announced that they were developing a video game starring Wonder Woman.

In 2025, Warner Bros. Games closed the studio alongside Player First Games and WB Games San Diego, cancelling &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and refocusing development efforts on core intellectual properties.

<text>Mark W. Tiedemann (born 1954 in St. Louis, Missouri) is an American science fiction and detective fiction author. He has written novels set in Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Robot&quot; universe, and within his own original universe, known as the Secantis Sequence.

In spring 2005 he was named president of the Missouri Center for the Book, which is the Missouri state adjunct program to the Library of Congress Center for the Book.

== Biography ==

Born to Henry and Donna Tiedemann, Mark W. Tiedemann grew up an only child. He wrote several short stories, a few of which he submitted to major SF magazines of the day such as &quot;Galaxy, Worlds of If, The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, though none were accepted for publication.

Upon entering high school, he discovered photography, which became his primary career. Writing still attracted his interest though, and in 1978 he completed a novel, &quot;Random Factor&quot;, though it was never published. He then wrote several more novels. In 1980, he met his future partner, Donna, who encouraged him to pursue his passion for writing. He met with limited success, with three short stories published before 1988, in small press magazines, the most notable of which was &quot;Reveleven&quot;, published by Scott Edelman in Edelman&#x27;s magazine &quot;Last Wave&quot; in 1986. Tiedemann then applied to and was accepted by the Clarion SF Writers Workshop In the summer of 1988, he attended Clarion with instructors Tim Powers, Lisa Goldstein, Samuel R. Delany, Kim Stanley Robinson, Kate Wilhelm, and Damon Knight. That workshop produced writers such as Kelley Eskridge, Nicola Griffith, and Peg Kerr, and within a year, Tiedemann began selling short stories. His first major sale was &quot;Targets&quot;, sold to Gardner Dozois, editor of &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot;. Several more quickly followed.

His next novel, &quot;Compass Reach&quot;, was shortlisted for the Philip K. Dick Award. This first in his &quot;Secantis Sequence&quot;, the novel approaches an interstellar empire from the perspective of the underclass, the main characters being so-called Freeriders---essentially hobos who stow away on translight ships and maintain a loose but widespread community. The novel deals with questions of class, material wealth, identity boundaries, and control, in the face of an expanding human presence that must deal with truly alien species. The novel ends with the principle polity, the Pan Humana, descending into civil war. The next novel in the series, &quot;Metal of Night&quot;, deals with that civil war, but from the standpoint of the victims and deals with issues of costs and consequence. The third Secantis novel, &quot;Peace and Memory&quot;, takes place some 80 years after the civil war and considers questions of self-determination, identity, and the parameters of appropriate political growth.

These three novels, plus a number of short stories, are constructed in such a way as to offer multiple possibilities for future stories, none of which share common characters, only a common background. Meisha Merlin Publishing published the novels.

Another novel, &quot;Remains&quot;, from BenBella Publishing, is separate from his Secantis universe. &quot;Remains&quot; is more of a &quot;planetary romance&quot;, the action taking place within the confines of the Solar System. The novel was shortlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. Award in 2006.

While working for the independent bookstore Left Bank Books (10 years), he composed the historical novel Granger&#x27;s Crossing, which is set during the Revolutionary War era in frontier St. Louis. Amphorae Publishing released it in spring of 2023 under their Blank Slate Press imprint. 

Upon retiring in 2022, he returned to short fiction, with a string of sales to Analog SF among others.

<doc id="432318" wikidata="Q283380" url="?curid=432318" title="Marginal rate of substitution">
<text>In economics, the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is the rate at which a consumer can give up some amount of one good in exchange for another good while maintaining the same level of utility. At equilibrium consumption levels (assuming no externalities), marginal rates of substitution are identical. The marginal rate of substitution is one of the three factors from marginal productivity, the others being marginal rates of transformation and marginal productivity of a factor.

==As the slope of indifference curve==
Under the standard assumption of neoclassical economics that goods and services are continuously divisible, the marginal rates of substitution will be the same regardless of the direction of exchange, and will correspond to the slope of an indifference curve (more precisely, to the slope multiplied by −1) passing through the consumption bundle in question, at that point: mathematically, it is the implicit derivative. MRS of X for Y is the amount of Y which a consumer can exchange for one unit of X locally. The MRS is different at each point along the indifference curve thus it is important to keep locus in the definition. Further on this assumption, or otherwise on the assumption that utility is quantified, the marginal rate of substitution of good or service X for good or service Y (MRSxy) is also equivalent to the marginal utility of X over the marginal utility of Y. Formally,

:formula_1
:formula_2

It is important to note that when comparing bundles of goods X and Y that give a constant utility (points along an indifference curve), the marginal utility of X is measured in terms of units of Y that is being given up.

For example, if the MRS&quot;xy&quot; = 2, the consumer will give up 2 units of Y to obtain 1 additional unit of X.

As one moves down a (standardly convex) indifference curve, the marginal rate of substitution decreases (as measured by the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve, which decreases). This is known as the law of diminishing marginal rate of substitution.

Since the indifference curve is convex with respect to the origin and we have defined the MRS as the negative slope of the indifference curve,

:formula_3

==Simple mathematical analysis==
Assume the consumer utility function is defined by formula_4, where &quot;U&quot; is consumer utility, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are goods. Then the marginal rate of substitution can be computed via partial differentiation, as follows.

Also, note that:

:formula_5
:formula_6

where formula_7 is the marginal utility with respect to good &quot;x&quot; and formula_8 is the marginal utility with respect to good &quot;y&quot;.

By taking the total differential of the utility function equation, we obtain the following results:
:formula_9, or substituting from above,

:formula_10, or, without loss of generality, the total derivative of the utility function with respect to good &quot;x&quot;,
:formula_11, that is,
:formula_12.
Through any point on the indifference curve, &quot;dU/dx&quot; = 0, because &quot;U&quot; = &quot;c&quot;, where &quot;c&quot; is a constant. It follows from the above equation that:
::formula_13, or rearranging
:formula_14

The marginal rate of substitution is defined as the absolute value of the slope of the indifference curve at whichever commodity bundle quantities are of interest. That turns out to equal the ratio of the marginal utilities:
:formula_15.

When consumers maximize utility with respect to a budget constraint, the indifference curve is tangent to the budget line, therefore, with &quot;m&quot; representing slope:

:formula_16
:formula_17
:formula_18

Therefore, when the consumer is choosing his utility maximized market basket on his budget line,

:formula_19
:formula_20

This important result tells us that utility is maximized when the consumer&#x27;s budget is allocated so that the marginal utility per unit of money spent is equal for each good. If this equality did not hold, the consumer could increase his/her utility by cutting spending on the good with lower marginal utility per unit of money and increase spending on the other good. To decrease the marginal rate of substitution, the consumer must buy more of the good for which he/she wishes the marginal utility to fall for (due to the law of diminishing marginal utility).

== Diminishing Marginal rate of Substitution==

An important principle of economic theory is that marginal rate of substitution of X for Y diminishes as more and more of good X is substituted for good Y. In other words, as the consumer has more and more of good X, he is prepared to forego less and less of good Y.

It means that as the consumer&#x27;s stock of X increases and his stock of Y decreases, he is willing to forego less and less of Y for a given increment in X. In other words, the marginal rate of substitution of X for Y falls as the consumer has more of X and less of Y. That the marginal rate of substitution of X for Y diminishes can also be known from drawing tangents at different points on an indifference curve.

==Using MRS to determine Convexity==
When analyzing the utility function of consumer&#x27;s in terms of determining if they are convex or not. For the horizon of two goods we can apply a quick derivative test (take the derivative of MRS) to determine if our consumer&#x27;s preferences are convex. If the derivative of MRS is negative the utility curve would be concave down meaning that it has a maximum and then decreases on either side of the maximum. This utility curve may have an appearance similar to that of a lower case n. If the derivative of MRS is equal to 0 the utility curve would be linear, the slope would stay constant throughout the utility curve. If the derivative of MRS is positive the utility curve would be convex up meaning that it has a minimum and then increases on either side of the minimum. This utility curve may have an appearance similar to that of a u. These statements are shown mathematically below.
:formula_21 
:formula_22
:formula_23

For more than two variables, the use of the Hessian matrix is required.

<text>The emperors of the Mughal Empire, who were all members of the Timurid dynasty (House of Babur), ruled the empire from its inception on 21 April 1526 to its dissolution in late 1857. They were supreme monarchs of the Mughal Empire in the Indian subcontinent, mainly corresponding to the modern day countries of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. They ruled many parts of India from 1526 and by 1707, they ruled most of the subcontinent. Afterwards, they declined rapidly, but nominally ruled territories until the Indian Rebellion of 1857, where they gave their last stand against the British forces in India. 

The Mughal dynasty was founded by Babur (), a Timurid prince from the Fergana Valley (modern-day Uzbekistan). He was a direct descendant of both Timur and Genghis Khan.

The Mughal emperors had significant Indian and Persian ancestry through marriage alliances as emperors were born to Persian princesses.

During the reign of 6th Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, the empire, as the world&#x27;s largest economy and manufacturing power, worth over 25% of global GDP, controlled nearly all of the Indian subcontinent, extending from Dhaka in the east to Kabul in the west and from Kashmir in the north to the Kaveri River in the south. 

Its population at the time is estimated to be around 158,400,000 (a quarter of the world&#x27;s total population), over a territory of more than 4 million square kilometres (1.5 million square miles). Mughal power rapidly dwindled during the 18th century and the last emperor, Bahadur Shah II, was deposed in 1857, with the establishment of the British Raj in India.

== Background ==
Titular emperors

Over the course of the empire, there were several claimants to the Mughal throne who ascended the throne or claimed to do so but were actually never recognized. 

Here are the claimants to the Mughal throne historians recognise as titular Mughal emperors.
# Shahryar Mirza (1627 - 1628)
# Dawar Baksh (1627 - 1628)
#Jahangir II (1719 - 1720)

He wrote the Preamble to the United States Constitution and has been called the &quot;Penman of the Constitution&quot;. While most Americans still thought of themselves as citizens of their respective states, Morris advanced the idea of being a citizen of a single union of states. He was also one of the most outspoken opponents of slavery among those who were present at the Constitutional Congress. He represented New York in the United States Senate from 1800 to 1803.

Morris was born into a wealthy landowning family in what is now New York City. After attending King&#x27;s College (now Columbia University) he studied law under Judge William Smith and earned admission to the bar. He was elected to the New York Provincial Congress before serving in the Continental Congress. After losing re-election to Congress, he moved to Philadelphia and became the assistant U.S. Superintendent of Finance. He represented Pennsylvania at the 1787 Constitutional Convention in which he advocated a strong central government. He served on the committee that wrote the final draft of the United States Constitution.

After the ratification of the Constitution, Morris served as Minister Plenipotentiary to France. He criticized the French Revolution and the execution of Marie Antoinette. Morris returned to the United States in 1798 and won election to the Senate in 1800. Affiliating with the Federalist Party, he lost re-election in 1803. After leaving the Senate, he served as chairman of the Erie Canal Commission, which constructed the Erie Canal, and was one of the commissioners that created the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811 to establish New York&#x27;s street grid.

==Early life==

Morris was born on January 31, 1752, the son of Lewis Morris Jr. (1698–1762) and his second wife, Sarah Gouverneur (1714–1786). Morris&#x27;s first name derived from his mother&#x27;s surname; she was from a Huguenot family that had first moved to Holland and then to New Amsterdam. In both Dutch and French, &quot;Gouverneur&quot; means &quot;Governor&quot;.

Morris&#x27;s half-brother Lewis Morris was a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Another half-brother, Staats Long Morris, was a Loyalist major-general in the British Army during the American Revolution, and Morris&#x27;s grandfather, Lewis Morris, was the chief justice of New York and British governor of New Jersey.

His nephew, Lewis Richard Morris, served in the Vermont Legislature and in the United States Congress. His grandnephew was William M. Meredith, who was United States Secretary of the Treasury under Zachary Taylor.

Morris&#x27;s father, Lewis Morris, was a wealthy landowner and judge.

Gouverneur Morris was born on the family estate, Morrisania, on the north side of the Harlem River, which was then in Westchester County but is now part of the Bronx. Morris, a gifted scholar, enrolled at King&#x27;s College (now Columbia University in New York City) at age 12. He graduated in 1768 and received a master&#x27;s degree in 1771. He studied law with Judge William Smith and attained admission to the bar in 1775.

==Career==

On May 8, 1775, Morris was elected to represent his family household in southern Westchester County (now Bronx County), in the New York Provincial Congress. As a member of the congress, he, along with most of his fellow delegates, concentrated on turning the colony into an independent state. However, his advocacy of independence brought him into conflict with his family, as well as with his mentor, William Smith, who had abandoned the Patriot cause when it pressed toward independence. Morris was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1777–78.

After the Battle of Long Island in August 1776, the British seized New York City. Morris&#x27;s mother, a Loyalist, gave his family&#x27;s estate, which was across the Harlem River from Manhattan, to the British for military use.

===Continental Congress===
Morris was appointed as a delegate to the Continental Congress and took his seat in Congress on 28 January 1778. He was selected to a committee in charge of coordinating reforms of the military with George Washington. After witnessing the army encamped at Valley Forge, he was so appalled by the conditions of the troops that he became the spokesman for the Continental Army in Congress and subsequently helped enact substantial reforms in its training, methods, and financing. He also signed the Articles of Confederation in 1778 and was its youngest signer.

In 1778, when the Conway Cabal was at its peak, some members of the Continental Congress attempted a no-confidence vote against George Washington. If it had succeeded, Washington would have been court-martialed and dismissed as Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. Gouverneur Morris cast the decisive tie-breaking vote in favor of keeping Washington as Commander-in-Chief.

===Lawyer and merchant===

In 1779, he was defeated for re-election to Congress, largely because his advocacy of a strong central government was at odds with the decentralist views prevalent in New York. Defeated in his home state, he moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to work as a lawyer and merchant.

In 1780, Morris had a carriage accident in Philadelphia, and his left leg was amputated below the knee. Despite an automatic exemption from military duty because of his handicap and his service in the legislature, he joined a special &quot;briefs&quot; club for the protection of New York City, a forerunner of the modern New York Guard.

=== Public office and Constitutional Convention ===
In Philadelphia, he was appointed assistant superintendent of finance of the United States and served under Robert Morris. He was selected as a Pennsylvania delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1787. During the Convention, he was a friend and ally of Washington and others who favored a strong central government. Morris was elected to serve on the Committee of Style and Arrangement, a committee of five (chaired by William Samuel Johnson), which drafted the final language of the proposed constitution. Morris has been credited by most historians with authorship of the final version of the preamble, including changing the opening line &quot;We, the People of the States&quot; to &quot;We, the People of the United States.&quot; Catherine Drinker Bowen, in her 1966 book &quot;Miracle at Philadelphia&quot;, called Morris the committee&#x27;s &quot;amanuensis,&quot; meaning that it was his pen that was responsible for most of the draft and its final polished form.

It is said by some that Morris was &quot;an aristocrat to the core,&quot; who believed that &quot;there never was, nor ever will be a civilized Society without an Aristocracy.&quot; It is also alleged that he thought that common people were incapable of self-government because he feared that the poor would sell their votes to the rich and that voting should be restricted to property owners. Duff Cooper wrote of Morris that although he &quot;had warmly espoused the cause of the colonists in the American War of Independence, he retained a cynically aristocratic view of life and a profound contempt for democratic theories.&quot;

Morris opposed admitting new western states on an equal basis with the existing eastern states for fear that the interior “wilderness” could not furnish &quot;enlightened&quot; national statesmen. Madison&#x27;s summary of Morris&#x27;s speech at the Convention on 11 July 1787 stated that his view &quot;relative to the Western Country had not changed his opinion on that head. Among other objections it must be apparent they would not be able to furnish men equally enlightened, to share in the administration of our common interests.&quot; His reason given for that was regional: &quot;The Busy haunts of men not the remote wilderness, was the proper School of political Talents. If the Western people get the power into their hands they will ruin the Atlantic interests.&quot; In that fear, Morris turned out to be in the minority. Jon Elster has suggested that Morris&#x27;s attempt to limit the future power of the West was a strategic move designed to limit the power of slaveholding states because Morris believed that slavery would predominate in new Western states.

At the Convention, he gave more speeches than any other delegate, a total of 173. As a matter of principle, he often vigorously defended the right of anyone to practice his chosen religion without interference, and he argued to include such language in the Constitution.

During the Convention Gouverneur Morris boarded at Miss Dally&#x27;s boarding house, along with Alexander Hamilton and Elbridge Gerry. Based on this discovery, an application was submitted to the State of Pennsylvania to install a historic marker on Market and 3rd Street in Philadelphia to honor Miss Dally and the location where the &quot;Penman of the Constitution&quot; boarded. Researchers have theorized that the five-member Committee on Style and Arrangement, which included Gouverneur Morris, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, may have met at Miss Dally&#x27;s boarding house between September 8 to September 12, which would have been the most convenient location for all five delegates.

===Opposition to slavery===

Gouverneur Morris was one of the few delegates at the Philadelphia Convention who spoke openly against domestic slavery. According to James Madison, who took notes at the Convention, Morris spoke openly against slavery on 8 August 1787 and stated that it was incongruous to say that a slave was both a man and property at the same time:

According to Madison, Morris felt that the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s purpose was to protect the rights of humanity, which was incongruous with promoting slavery:

===Minister Plenipotentiary to France===

Morris went to France on business in 1789 and served as Minister Plenipotentiary to France from 1792 to 1794. His diaries during that time have become a valuable chronicle of the French Revolution and capture much of that era&#x27;s turbulence and violence and document his affairs with women there. Compared to Thomas Jefferson, Morris was far more critical of the French Revolution and considerably more sympathetic to the deposed queen consort, Marie Antoinette. Commenting on her grandfather&#x27;s sometimes Tory-minded outlook of the world, Anne Cary Morris stated, &quot;His creed was rather to form the government to suit the condition, character, manners, and habits of the people. In France this opinion led him to take the monarchical view, firmly believing that a republican form of government would not suit the French character.&quot;

Morris was &quot;the only foreign representative who remained in his post throughout the worst days of the Terror.&quot; On one occasion, when Morris &quot;found himself the center of a hostile mob in favor of hanging him on the nearest lamppost, he unfastened his wooden leg, brandished it above his head, and proclaimed himself an American who had lost a limb fighting for liberty,&quot; upon which &quot;[t]he mob&#x27;s suspicions melted into enthusiastic cheers&quot; (even though, as noted above, Morris had in fact lost his leg as a result of a carriage accident).

While Morris was minister, the Marquis de Lafayette, who had been an important participant in the American Revolution, was exiled from France and his family imprisoned, and Thomas Paine, another important figure, was arrested and imprisoned in France. Morris&#x27;s efforts on their behalf have been criticized as desultory and insufficient. After a change of the French government and after Morris was replaced as minister, his successor, James Monroe, secured Paine&#x27;s release.

===U.S. Senate===
He returned to the United States in 1798 and was elected in April 1800, as a Federalist, to the U.S. Senate, filling the vacancy caused by the resignation of James Watson. Morris served from May 3, 1800 to March 3, 1803 and was defeated for re-election in February 1803.

===Later career===
On 4 July 1806, he was elected an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati.

After leaving the Senate, he served as Chairman of the Erie Canal Commission from 1810 to 1813. The Erie Canal helped to transform New York City into a financial capital, the possibilities of which were apparent to Morris when he said that &quot;the proudest empire in Europe is but a bubble compared to what America will be, must be, in the course of two centuries, perhaps of one.&quot;

He was one of the three men who drew up the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811, which laid out the Manhattan street grid.

Morris&#x27;s final public act was to support the Hartford Convention during the War of 1812. He even pushed for secession to create a separate New York-New England Confederation because he saw the war as a result of slaveholders, who wanted to expand their territory. In the words of the biographer Richard Brookhiser &quot;The man who wrote the Constitution judged it to be a failure and was willing to scrap it.&quot;

Morris was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814.

==Personal life==
Until he married late in life, Morris&#x27;s diary tells of a series of affairs. His lovers included the French novelist Adelaide Filleul and the American poet and novelist Sarah Wentworth Apthorp Morton.

In 1809, at age 57, he married 35-year-old Ann Cary Randolph (1774–1837), nicknamed &quot;Nancy,&quot; who was the daughter of Ann Cary and Thomas Mann Randolph Sr. and the sister of Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. was the husband of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s daughter, Martha Jefferson Randolph. Nancy lived near Farmville, Virginia, with her sister Judith and Judith&#x27;s husband, Richard Randolph, on a plantation called &quot;Bizarre&quot;. In April 1793, Richard Randolph and Nancy were accused of murdering a newborn baby who was said to be Nancy&#x27;s; presumably, she had been having an affair with Richard. Richard stood trial and was defended by Patrick Henry and John Marshall, who obtained an acquittal. Richard Randolph died suddenly in 1796; both sisters were suspected, but nothing was proven. Nancy remained at &quot;Bizarre&quot; after her brother-in-law&#x27;s death but Judith asked her to leave in 1805.

Nancy traveled north and lived in Connecticut before she agreed in 1809 to work as a housekeeper for Morris, whom she had known previously. They soon decided to marry; Morris was apparently undisturbed by the rumors that had caused Nancy to leave Virginia. By all accounts, their marriage was a happy one; they had a son, Gouverneur Morris Jr., who went on to a long career as a railroad executive.

==Death and legacy==
Morris died on November 6, 1816, after he had caused himself internal injuries and an infection while using a piece of whale baleen as a catheter in an attempt to clear a blockage in his urinary tract. He died at the family estate, Morrisania, and was buried at St. Ann&#x27;s Church in The Bronx.

Morris&#x27;s great-grandson, also named Gouverneur Morris (1876–1953), was an author of pulp novels and short stories in the early 20th century. Several of his works were adapted into films, including the famous Lon Chaney film &quot;The Penalty&quot; in 1920.

Morris established himself as an important landowner in northern New York, where the Town of Gouverneur, Village of Gouverneur, and Village of Morristown in St. Lawrence County are named after him.

In 1943, a United States Liberty ship, the SS &quot;Gouverneur Morris&quot;, was launched. She was scrapped in 1974.

<doc id="432332" wikidata="Q1341800" url="?curid=432332" title="Engel curve">
<text>In microeconomics, an Engel curve describes how household expenditure on a particular good or service varies with household income. There are two varieties of Engel curves. Budget share Engel curves describe how the proportion of household income spent on a good varies with income. Alternatively, Engel curves can also describe how real expenditure varies with household income. They are named after the German statistician Ernst Engel (1821–1896), who was the first to investigate this relationship between goods expenditure and income systematically in 1857. The best-known single result from the article is Engel&#x27;s law which states that as income grows, spending on food becomes a smaller share of income; therefore, the share of a household&#x27;s or country&#x27;s income spent on food is an indication of their affluence.
==Shape==

Graphically, the Engel curve is represented in the first quadrant of the Cartesian coordinate system. Income is shown on the horizontal axis and the quantity demanded for the selected good or service is shown on the vertical.

The attached figure shows the derivation process of the Engel curve in case of necessities. Panel (a) is an undifferentiated graph representing consumers&#x27; preferences for goods X and Y. The three parallel lines of Rs.300, Rs 400. And Rs.500 are called budget lines. And the slope of these three lines is the same, which implies that the prices of the two goods are constant, while the budget line farther from the origin indicates a larger budget amount. The three points R, S, and T in the graph hint different preference combinations. The line connecting these three points is called the income consumption curve (ICC). By extending Panel (a) to Panel (b), the Engel curve for good X is obtained by connecting the points R’, S’, and T’.

The shapes of Engel curves depend on many demographic variables and other consumer characteristics. A good&#x27;s Engel curve reflects its income elasticity and indicates whether the good is an inferior, normal, or luxury good. Empirical Engel curves are close to linear for some goods, and highly nonlinear for others.

For normal goods, the Engel curve has a positive gradient. That is, as income increases, the quantity demanded increases. Amongst normal goods, there are two possibilities. Although the Engel curve remains upward sloping in both cases, it bends toward the X-axis for necessities and towards the Y-axis for luxury goods.

For inferior goods, the Engel curve has a negative gradient. That means that as the consumer has more income, they will buy less of the inferior good because they are able to purchase better goods.

For goods with a Marshallian demand function generated from a utility function of Gorman polar form, the Engel curve is linear.

Many Engel curves feature saturation properties in that their slope tends toward infinity at high income levels, which suggests that there exists an absolute limit on how much expenditure on a good will rise as household income increases. This saturation property has been linked to slowdowns in the growth of demand for some sectors in the economy, causing major changes in an economy&#x27;s sectoral composition to take place.

==Other properties==

When considering a system of Engel curves, the adding-up theorem dictates that the sum of all total expenditure elasticities, when weighted by the corresponding budget share, must add up to unity. This rules out the possibility of saturation being a general property of Engel curves across all goods as this would imply that the income elasticity of all goods approaches zero starting from a certain level of income. The adding-up restriction stems from the assumption that consumption always takes place at the upper boundary of the household&#x27;s opportunity set, which is only fulfilled if the household cannot completely satisfy all its wants within the boundaries of the opportunity set.

Other scholars argue that an upper saturation level exists for all types of goods and services.

==Applications==
In microeconomics Engel curves are used for equivalence scale calculations and related welfare comparisons, and determine properties of demand systems such as aggregability and rank.

Engel curves have also been used to study how the changing industrial composition of growing economies are linked to the changes in the composition of household demand.

In trade theory, one explanation of inter-industry trade has been the hypothesis that countries with similar income levels possess similar preferences for goods and services (the Lindner hypothesis), which suggests that understanding how the composition of household demand changes with income may play an important role in determining global trade patterns.

Engel curves are also of great relevance in the measurement of inflation, and tax policy.

The Engel curve allows estimating the consumer price index deviation for old age.

The Engel curve method is used to study the improvement of farmers&#x27; welfare by comparing food consumption and income growth. What is more, it infers the cost of living of households. Additionally, it also studies the impact of the sources of household consumption diversity on welfare.

The Engel curve estimates the collective household model.

Engel curves assess whether outdoor leisure is a luxury or a necessity.

The deflator of the Engel curve is not sufficiently representative of the deflator obtained from the multilateral price index. It is not appropriate to use only the Engel method in some regions, the changes in poverty and inequality, the estimated locations and levels will be greatly distorted, which will result in wrong conclusions.

Engel curves have found a wide range of applications, including assessing policies related to agriculture, taxation, trade, industrial organization, housing, and the measurement of poverty and inequality.

==Problems==
===Low explanatory power===
Heteroscedasticity is a well known problem in the estimation of Engel curves: as income rises the difference between actual observation and the estimated expenditure level tends to increase dramatically. Engel curve and other demand function models still fail to explain most of the observed variation in individual consumption behavior.

As a result, many scholars acknowledge that influences other than current prices and current total expenditure must be systematically modeled if even the broad pattern of demand is to be explained in a theoretically coherent and empirically robust way.

For example, some success has been achieved in understanding how social status concerns have influenced household expenditure on highly visible goods.

===Accounting for their shape===
Ernst Engel argued that households possessed a hierarchy of wants that determined the shape of Engel curves. As household income rises some motivations become more prominent in household expenditure as the more basic wants that dominate consumption patterns at low-income levels, such as hunger, eventually become satiated at higher income levels. Engel&#x27;s argument is formalized in neoclassical consumer theory, which conceives of the relationship between income and consumption patterns in terms of utility optimization. In such models, consumers allocate their expenditures to goods and services with the highest marginal utility. After basic needs are satiated, the marginal utility from further consumption of those goods declines, and additional income is allocated to other goods and services. A &quot;necessity&quot; is thus a good whose marginal utility declines more quickly than the average good.

In the standard household engel curve, there are three possible sources of heterogeneity that are statistically ignorable when estimating household engel curves:

1. There can be latent household effects on individual demand behavior. Families gather selectively, and they may influence each other&#x27;s behavior, such as consumption patterns and preferences.

2. There are differences in individual demand parameters within households. We know that when the income gains are assigned to people with different consumption patterns and different preferences over how the extra money should be spent, Engel&#x27;s Law may stop to hold.

3. There is heterogeneity in the extent of inequality within households. Intra-household inequality amplifies the effect of the bias on the Engel curve.

There is no apparent reason why these sources of heterogeneity are statistically ignorable when estimating household Engel curves. Latent heterogeneity in demand behavior may well be correlated with household total spending or income. For example, there may well be latent differences in human capital that influence demands, such as when a mother&#x27;s education influences the priority given to nutrition. In turn, human capital is likely to be positively correlated with household consumption or income. Another example relates to the household&#x27;s social status in the local community of residence. Perceptions of the obligations that come with higher social status may well influence spending patterns; for example, one may feel the need to show off with a TV or have enough food ready if someone shows up. Such &quot;status-seeking&quot; behavior can be expected at a given level of total spending and correlated with that spending. These factors above are why Engel&#x27;s coefficient of a family may be affected in the statistical process.

<text>The Hotchkiss School is a private college-preparatory day and boarding school in Lakeville, Connecticut. It educates approximately 600 students in grades 9–12, plus postgraduates. Founded in 1891, it was one of the first English-style boarding schools in the United States and an early proponent of student financial aid, having accepted scholarship students since its inception.

Hotchkiss is a member of the Eight Schools Association and Ten Schools Admission Organization, two groups of American boarding schools. It was also a founding member of the G20 Schools group, an international association of college-preparatory high schools.

The school&#x27;s list of notable alumni includes Supreme Court justice Potter Stewart, Nobel laureate Dickinson Richards, Morgan Stanley co-founder Harold Stanley, and Yale University president A. Whitney Griswold.

==History==

=== Early years and developing reputation ===

In 1891, Maria Hotchkiss, the heir to her late husband Benjamin&#x27;s armaments fortune, founded Hotchkiss School in her hometown of Lakeville, Connecticut. Although Hotchkiss had intended to establish a small school of roughly 50 students that would educate local boys for free, her chief advisor, Yale University president Timothy Dwight, wanted to use Hotchkiss&#x27; millions to establish a feeder school for Yale. He hired key staff from Phillips Academy (Andover), a traditional Yale feeder school, and placed several members of the Yale community on the board of trustees. The school focused heavily on preparing students for Yale&#x27;s entrance exams, and by the early 1920s Hotchkiss was consistently beating Andover&#x27;s scores at the College Boards. 

The newly constituted Hotchkiss School was an instant success, and the graduating class of 1896 sent twenty-eight of its thirty graduates to Yale. That same year, Hotchkiss enrolled its first international student, the Catalan-Puerto Rican José Camprubí; in addition, Chinese students have attended Hotchkiss since 1912. Buoyed by its college placement record, the school grew rapidly. In 1902, the school had 145 students. By 1909, it already had a national student body, attracting 223 students from 29 states; of that year&#x27;s forty-six graduates, thirty went to Yale. By 1926, Hotchkiss already enrolled 333 students. The school remained at roughly 300–350 students until the advent of coeducation in 1974. 

From the start, Hotchkiss offered what was (for its day) an extensive scholarship program; through the 1920s, approximately 10% of Hotchkiss students were on full scholarships. (Today, 9.6% of Hotchkiss students are on full scholarships, and another 27% receive some amount of financial aid.) However, scholarship students and paying students were not treated with total equality: as late as the 1970s, only the scholarship boys were required to perform chores on campus. During World War I, the First Yale (Aviation) Unit was sarcastically dubbed &quot;The Millionaire&#x27;s Unit&quot;; many of its key members were Hotchkiss graduates.

Following Maria Hotchkiss&#x27; death in 1901, the school cultivated ties to Midwestern industrialists, who became some of Hotchkiss&#x27; most important donors. The Ford family of Michigan built the school library; Ohio newspaperman Paul Block donated the chapel; and automobile magnate Walter Chrysler paid for the infirmary. By 1920, the reputation was sufficiently established that Minnesota native F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; poked fun at Hotchkiss and its athletics rival Taft for &quot;prepar[ing] the wealth of the Middle West for social success at Yale.&quot; The school&#x27;s history speculated that Hotchkiss developed these ties because older New England boarding schools &quot;looked askance at first- or second-generation wealth, especially if its possessors resided beyond the Northeast.&quot;

=== The disciplinarians and the gentlemen ===
Over the years, the school acquired a reputation for gentility, fostered by long-serving headmaster George Van Santvoord, a former Yale professor and 1908 Hotchkiss graduate who ran the school from 1926 to 1955. Van Santvoord said that at his Hotchkiss there was only one school rule: &quot;Be a gentleman&quot;—a principle he inherited from his own Hotchkiss headmaster, Huber Buehler. (The phrase dates back to an 1893 student publication.)

Although Van Santvoord de-emphasized Hotchkiss&#x27; traditional focus on college entrance examinations, Hotchkiss continued to send large numbers of students to Yale; sociologist Jerome Karabel calculated that in the 1930s, &quot;more students came to New Haven from Hotchkiss than from the combined public school systems of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia.&quot; Van Santvoord found an ideological ally in Yale president James Rowland Angell, who declared at a Hotchkiss alumni dinner that college entrance examinations were &quot;disastrous&quot; for secondary education. When Van Santvoord announced his retirement in 1954, &quot;Time&quot; magazine stated that &quot;of all U.S. prep schools, few, if any, can beat the standards Hotchkiss has set&quot;. (The man in charge of &quot;Time&quot; was Henry Luce, a Hotchkiss fundraiser and former Hotchkiss scholarship student.)

Under Van Santvoord, Hotchkiss became the first of the post-1884 American boarding schools to accept black students when Marcellus Winston &#x27;55 matriculated in 1951. He also abolished hazing in 1930. However, Van Santvoord strongly opposed co-education, and due to his continuing influence over the school&#x27;s board of trustees, Hotchkiss did not begin accepting girls until nearly two decades after his retirement. Under his leadership, Hotchkiss&#x27; financial aid resources &quot;largely went to the nouveau poor, well-to-do families who had taken their lumps during the Great Depression.&quot; He also opposed (unsuccessfully) proposals to start a summer school for low-income students.

Neither did Van Santvoord fully dislodge the school&#x27;s no-second-chances approach to student discipline, which was facetiously compared to &quot;Stalag 17&quot;. Twenty-five years after his retirement, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Hotchkiss &quot;has long been known for its strict rules and the alacrity with which it expels youngsters who break them.&quot; Recognizing this reputation, Hotchkiss invited a former student, C. D. B. Bryan, to write the introduction to the official history of the school, in which Bryan recounts how Hotchkiss expelled him &quot;for having an electric coffeepot and smoking a Lucky Strike.&quot;

=== Modernizing Hotchkiss ===
A. William &quot;Bill&quot; Olsen became headmaster in 1960 and proceeded to relax many of the austerities of life at Hotchkiss. He introduced new holidays to the school calendar (at the time, only seniors were allowed to go home for Thanksgiving), allowed students to keep radios in their dormitories, legalized smoking and drinking (in Connecticut, eighteen-year-olds may drink alcohol under specific circumstances), and moderated the system of punishments and expulsions. He also abolished compulsory Sunday chapel attendance in 1970; although Hotchkiss had been nonsectarian since its founding, the extent of its ecumenicism had been to allow Catholics to attend Sunday Mass at 9:00 a.m. as long as they attended the school&#x27;s official Protestant service later that day.

The school also took steps to diversify its student body. In 1953, with Hotchkiss&#x27; help, Hotchkiss alumnus Eugene Van Voorhis &#x27;51 established the Ulysses S. Grant Foundation to assist minority New Haven students with the prep school application process. Hotchkiss has also participated in other recruitment initiatives from the 1960s onward, such as A Better Chance (ABC), Prep for Prep, and the Greater Opportunity (GO) summer program for inner-city students. In 1974, Hotchkiss began admitting girls (but not before certain board members nearly succeeded in firing Olsen to prevent it), and as of 2014 there was an approximately 50–50 gender balance in the student body. To limit the number of male students who would be rejected as a result of this change, Hotchkiss agreed to increase the size of the student body from 350 to 500 students.

===International relations and diversity===
In 1928, the school joined the English-Speaking Union and established the International Schoolboy Exchange. Established by the class of 1948, the Fund for Global Understanding enables student participation in summer service projects across the world. The school additionally offers a School Year Abroad program.

In 2010, Hotchkiss partnered with Peking University High School to establish its study abroad, international division called Dalton Academy. Hotchkiss is a member of the Global Education Benchmark Group (GEBG), the Round Square group, and the Confucius Institute International Division (Hanban).

Today, 42% of U.S. Hotchkiss students identify as people of color, up from 33% in 2018–19. To recruit U.S. students from &quot;historically underrepresented&quot; backgrounds, Hotchkiss pays for certain prospective applicants and their guardians to visit the campus during the admissions process. 14% of the student body is international. 

== Finances ==

=== Tuition and financial aid ===
Tuition and fees for the 2024-2025 academic year are $71,170 for boarding students and $60,490 for day students. 37% of the student body is on financial aid, and the average aid grant is $62,075. The school&#x27;s goal is for half the student body to be on financial aid by 2028. In addition, the school commits to meet 100% of an admitted student&#x27;s demonstrated financial need, and awards full scholarships to 26% of students on financial aid (9.6% of the student body).

=== Endowment and expenses ===
As of June 30, 2023, Hotchkiss&#x27; financial endowment was $553.9 million. In its Internal Revenue Service filings for the 2021-22 school year, Hotchkiss reported total assets of $760.3 million, net assets of $665.5 million, investment holdings of $549.5 million, and cash holdings of $9.2 million. Hotchkiss also reported $61.1 million in program service expenses and $12.9 million in grants (primarily student financial aid).

== Controversies ==

=== Sexual abuse investigation ===
In 2015, a former student sued the school, alleging that he had been raped and sexually harassed in &quot;an environment of well-known and tolerated sexual assaults, sexually violent hazing, and pedophilia.&quot; He said his dormitory master and instructor had drugged him and lured him to his quarters where he was raped.

As a result of this complaint and others, Hotchkiss retained two law firms to conduct an investigation into potential sexual abuse at Hotchkiss. The investigators interviewed more than 150 people and reviewed more than 200,000 pages of documents. In 2018, the investigators reported that although at least seven former faculty members had abused students for years, school administrators failed to adequately or timely respond to credible reports of abuse. Specifically, the investigators explained that &quot;Although not all sexual misconduct was reported contemporaneously, there were multiple reports made by survivors, other students, and faculty at or near the time of the abuse that should have spurred the school to action.&quot; (In 1992, the school fired one of these faculty members &quot;after a thorough investigation,&quot; and publicly disclosed his dismissal. However, the school had previously allowed that faculty member to return to Hotchkiss after first suspending him following reports of sexual misconduct.) In 2020, the investigators released a supplementary report concerning an eighth faculty member. Hotchkiss announced that it would continue retaining the investigators in case any further victims come forward.

The school issued several apologies following the release of the report. A former headmaster who had been serving on the board of trustees resigned after cooperating with investigators. Representatives of the board of trustees said that information gathered in the course of the investigation would be turned over to law enforcement. In 2022, the school built a memorial garden to acknowledge &quot;its commitment to preventing future cases&quot; of abuse.

=== Encephalitis lawsuit ===
In 2017, following a jury trial and unsuccessful appeal, Hotchkiss was required to pay $41.5 million to a former student who contracted tick-borne encephalitis during a 2007 school trip to China. At trial, Hotchkiss had argued that the disease was not reasonably foreseeable, as &quot;this is the only recorded case of this particular disease afflicting a traveler in China.&quot;

==Academics==

=== Curriculum ===
Operating on a semester schedule, Hotchkiss offers a classical education, 224 courses, several foreign languages and study-abroad programs. The school offers advanced students the opportunity to try out academic research at a university in preparation for a final project; in recent years, students have worked at Yale, Harvard, and Stanford.

In 1991, &quot;The New York Times&quot; recognized Hotchkiss&#x27; summer program as a &quot;Summer School for the Very Ambitious.&quot; In addition, Deerfield Academy&#x27;s student newspaper asserts that &quot;many consider The Hotchkiss School to be the leader in environmental awareness among the top prep schools in the country.&quot;

=== Standardized testing ===
The Class of 2023&#x27;s average combined SAT score was 1430 and its average combined ACT score was 31. The school abolished Advanced Placement classes ahead of the 2021–22 school year, explaining that it aims to offer an &quot;upper-level elective curriculum that is more inquiry-driven and conceptually challenging than what the College Board offers.&quot; However, students who wish to take AP tests may do so. 

=== College placement ===
In 2007, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; stated that Hotchkiss, compared to Choate Rosemary Hall and Deerfield Academy, had more students accepted at Harvard, Princeton, and six other universities, excluding Yale.

=== Notable faculty ===

==Extracurricular activities==

===Athletics===
Hotchkiss fields 19 interscholastic sports teams that primarily compete in the Founders League, an athletic conference within the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council. Hotchkiss&#x27; sailing teams compete in the Interscholastic Sailing Association&#x27;s New England Schools Sailing Association (NESSA) district, and have won NESSA championships in every year a competition has been held since 2018. Its colors are Yale Blue and white, and its mascot is the bearcat. In addition, as a member of the Eight Schools Association, Hotchkiss&#x27; athletic director sits on the Eight Schools Athletic Council. 

In 1933, Samuel Gottscho photographed the Hotchkiss baseball team, which appears in the Library of Congress&#x27; Gottscho-Schleisner Collection.

Hotchkiss and Taft School have a long-standing rivalry, owing in part to their proximity (both schools are located in Litchfield County) and in other part to their shared ties to the Midwest. On the final Saturday of the fall sport season, the two schools compete against each other in every sport.

===Clubs===
Hotchkiss offers more than 65 clubs, including &quot;The Record&quot;, a biweekly, student-run newspaper circulated on campus and among alumni, &quot;The Mischianza&quot; yearbook, &quot;BaHSA&quot;, a club celebrating the culture and rich history of Black and Hispanic members of the Hotchkiss community, the Hotchkiss Chorus music ensemble, and extensive service organizations such as the St. Luke&#x27;s Society. Other notable organizations include Calliope, the all-girls a cappella group; Bluenotes, the all-boys a cappella group; the Hotchkiss Speech and Debate Team; and Food for Thought, the school&#x27;s philosophy club. The school also hosts an annual student-run film festival, The Hotchkiss Film Festival, that attracts student filmmakers from all over the world to compete for prizes and a scholarship.

==Campus==
The school overlooks the Berkshires on a rural, campus featuring 12 single-sex dorms and one all-gender dorm, two lakes, a nine-hole golf course, an educational farm, and one forest. The Main Building serves as the academic and social center, featuring 30 SmartBoard classrooms, the Edsel Ford Memorial Library with 87,000-volumes occupying 25,000 square feet, and dining halls.

An EPA Green Power Partner and Green Schools Ally, Hotchkiss requires all campus buildings to acquire LEED certification and was renovated to achieve the second highest, LEED Gold certification in 2008 and use 34% green power (ranked eighth largest, green K–12 school in 2009 by EPA), while upholding the Georgian architecture tradition from Bruce Price, Cass Gilbert, and Delano and Aldrich. The school renovation project earned Robert A.M. Stern Architects the 2010 Palladio Award, with Paul Rudolph and Butler Rogers Basket contributing elements of modern architecture.
===Art facilities===
In 2005, Hotchkiss opened the 715-seat Esther Eastman Music Center, equipped with a handmade Fazioli F308 piano, 12 Steinway pianos, 12 practice rooms, 3 ensemble practice rooms, a WKIS radio station, and Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) lab. Hotchkiss also has a 615-seat proscenium theater called Walker Auditorium.

===Athletic facilities===
In 2002, Hotchkiss opened the Forrest E. Mars Jr. Athletic Center, a 212,000 square-foot athletic center with multi-purpose playing surfaces, elevated indoor exercise track, rinks, natatorium with 10-lane pool and separate diving well, basketball court, wrestling room, suash courts, indoor tennis courts, and a fitness center.

The Hotchkiss Golf Course is a nine-hole golf course of approximately 3,000 yards, designed by Seth Raynor in 1924 and rated by &quot;Golf Digest&quot; as one of the 25 best nine-hole courses in America. Hotchkiss also has the Baker Complex, including synthetic Sprole Field and many tracks, courts, and fields; three ponds; and extensive hiking trails.

==Notable alumni==
== In popular culture ==
*In 1947, &quot;Time&quot; made a piece of Hotchkiss graffiti famous by publishing it twice: &quot;In Lakeville, Conn., someone penciled in the Hotchkiss School lavatory: &quot;Schuyler van Kilroy 3rd was here,&quot; a humorous variation of the popular expression &quot;Kilroy was here.&quot;
*Archibald MacLeish&#x27;s last interview (1982) in &quot;American Heritage&quot; magazine disclosed, &quot;God, how I did not like Hotchkiss!&quot;

<text>Lionel Mordecai Trilling (July 4, 1905 – November 5, 1975) was an American literary critic, short story writer, essayist, and teacher. He was one of the leading U.S. critics of the 20th century who analyzed the contemporary cultural, social, and political implications of literature. With his wife Diana Trilling (née Rubin), whom he married in 1929, he was a member of the New York Intellectuals and contributor to the &quot;Partisan Review&quot;.

==Personal and academic life==
Lionel Mordecai Trilling was born in Queens, New York, the son of Fannie (née Cohen), who was from London, and David Trilling, a tailor from Bialystok in Poland. His family was Jewish. In 1921, he graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School, and, at age 16, entered Columbia University, thus beginning a lifelong association with the university. He joined the Boar&#x27;s Head Society and wrote for the &quot;Morningside&quot; literary journal. In 1925, he graduated from Columbia College, and, in 1926, earned a master&#x27;s degree at the university (his master&#x27;s essay was entitled &quot;Theodore Edward Hook: his life and work&quot;). He then taught at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and at Hunter College.

In 1929 he married Diana Rubin, and the two began a lifelong literary partnership. In 1932 he returned to Columbia to pursue his doctoral degree in English literature and to teach literature. He earned his doctorate in 1938 with a dissertation about Matthew Arnold that he later published. He was promoted to assistant professor the following year, becoming Columbia&#x27;s first tenured Jewish professor in its English department. He was promoted to full professor in 1948.

Trilling became the George Edward Woodberry Professor of Literature and Criticism in 1965. He was a popular instructor and for thirty years taught Columbia&#x27;s Colloquium on Important Books, a course about the relationship between literature and cultural history, with Jacques Barzun. His students included Lucien Carr, Jack Kerouac, Donald M. Friedman, Allen Ginsberg, Eugene Goodheart, Steven Marcus, John Hollander, Richard Howard, Cynthia Ozick, Carolyn Gold Heilbrun, George Stade, David Lehman, Leon Wieseltier, Louis Menand, Robert Leonard Moore and Norman Podhoretz.

Trilling was the George Eastman Visiting Professor at the University of Oxford from 1963 to 1965 and Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University for academic year 1969–70. In 1972, he was selected by the National Endowment for the Humanities to deliver the first Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities, described as &quot;the highest honor the federal government confers for distinguished intellectual achievement in the humanities.&quot; Trilling was a senior Fellow of the Kenyon School of English and subsequently a senior Fellow of the Indiana School of Letters. He held honorary degrees from Trinity College, Harvard University, and Case Western Reserve University and memberships in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He also served on the boards of &quot;The Kenyon Review&quot; and &quot;Partisan Review&quot;.

Trilling, a long-time heavy smoker, died of pancreatic cancer in 1975. He was survived by his wife and son, James Trilling, an art historian who served as a former curator at the George Washington University Museum and Textile Museum. His nephew Billy Cross is a musician residing in Denmark.

==&quot;Partisan Review&quot; and the &quot;New York Intellectuals&quot;==
In 1937, Trilling joined the recently revived magazine &quot;Partisan Review&quot;, a Marxist but anti-Stalinist journal founded by William Philips and Philip Rahv in 1934.

The &quot;Partisan Review&quot; was associated with the New York Intellectuals – Trilling, his wife Diana Trilling, Lionel Abel, Hannah Arendt, William Barrett, Daniel Bell, Saul Bellow, Richard Thomas Chase, F. W. Dupee, Leslie Fiedler, Paul Goodman, Clement Greenberg, Elizabeth Hardwick, Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin, Hilton Kramer, Steven Marcus, Mary McCarthy, Dwight Macdonald, William Phillips, Norman Podhoretz, Harold Rosenberg, Isaac Rosenfeld, Delmore Schwartz, and Susan Sontag – who emphasized the influence of history and culture upon authors and literature. The New York Intellectuals distanced themselves from the New Critics.

In his preface to the essays collection, &quot;Beyond Culture&quot; (1965), Trilling defended the New York Intellectuals: &quot;As a group, it is busy and vivacious about ideas, and, even more, about attitudes. Its assiduity constitutes an authority. The structure of our society is such that a class of this kind is bound by organic filaments to groups less culturally fluent that are susceptible to its influence.&quot;

==Critical and literary works==
Trilling wrote one novel, &quot;The Middle of the Journey&quot; (1947), about an affluent Communist couple&#x27;s encounter with a Communist defector. (Trilling later acknowledged that the character was inspired by his Columbia College compatriot and contemporary Whittaker Chambers.) His short stories include &quot;The Other Margaret&quot;. Otherwise, he wrote essays and reviews in which he reflected on literature&#x27;s ability to challenge the morality and conventions of the culture. Critic David Daiches said of Trilling, &quot;Mr. Trilling likes to move out and consider the implications, the relevance for culture, for civilization, for the thinking man today, of each particular literary phenomenon which he contemplates, and this expansion of the context gives him both his moments of his greatest perceptions, and his moments of disconcerting generalization.&quot;

Trilling published two complex studies of authors Matthew Arnold (1939) and E. M. Forster (1943), both written in response to a concern with &quot;the tradition of humanistic thought and the intellectual middle class which believes it continues this tradition.&quot; His first collection of essays, &quot;The Liberal Imagination&quot;, was published in 1950, followed by the collections &quot;The Opposing Self&quot; (1955), focusing on the conflict between self-definition and the influence of culture, &quot;Freud and the Crisis of Our Culture&quot; (1955), &quot;A Gathering of Fugitives&quot; (1956), and &quot;Beyond Culture&quot; (1965), a collection of essays concerning modern literary and cultural attitudes toward selfhood. In &quot;Sincerity and Authenticity&quot; (1972), he explores the ideas of the moral self in post-Enlightenment Western civilization. He wrote the introduction to &quot;The Selected Letters of John Keats&quot; (1951), in which he defended Keats&#x27;s notion of negative capability, as well as the introduction, &quot;George Orwell and the Politics of Truth,&quot; to the 1952 reissue of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;.

In 2008, Columbia University Press published an unfinished novel that Trilling had abandoned in the late 1940s. Scholar Geraldine Murphy discovered the half-finished novel among Trilling&#x27;s papers archived at Columbia University. Trilling&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Journey Abandoned: The Unfinished Novel&quot;, is set in the 1930s and involves a young protagonist, Vincent Hammell, who seeks to write a biography of an older poet, Jorris Buxton. Buxton&#x27;s character is loosely based on the nineteenth century Romantic poet Walter Savage Landor. Writer and critic Cynthia Ozick praised the novel&#x27;s &quot;skillful narrative&quot; and &quot;complex characters&quot;, writing, &quot;&quot;The Journey Abandoned&quot; is a crowded gallery of carefully delineated portraits whose innerness is divulged partly through dialogue but far more extensively in passages of cannily analyzed insight.&quot;

==Politics==
Trilling&#x27;s politics have been strongly debated and, like much else in his thought, may be described as &quot;complex.&quot; An often-quoted summary of Trilling&#x27;s politics is that he wished to:
Of ideologies, Trilling wrote, &quot;Ideology is not the product of thought; it is the habit or the ritual of showing respect for certain formulas to which, for various reasons having to do with emotional safety, we have very strong ties and of whose meaning and consequences in actuality we have no clear understanding.&quot;

Politically, Trilling was a noted member of the anti-Stalinist left, a position that he maintained to the end of his life.

===Liberal===
In his earlier years, Trilling wrote for and in the liberal tradition, explicitly rejecting conservatism; from the preface to his 1950 essay &quot;The Liberal Imagination&quot; (emphasis added to the much-quoted last line):

===Neoconservative===
Some, both conservative and liberal, argue that Trilling&#x27;s views became steadily more conservative over time. Trilling has been embraced as sympathetic to neoconservatism by neoconservatives (such as Norman Podhoretz, the former editor of &quot;Commentary&quot;). However, this embrace was unrequited; Trilling criticized the New Left (as he had the Old Left) but did not embrace neoconservativism.

His wife, Diana Trilling, claimed that neoconservatives were mistaken in thinking that Trilling shared their views. “I am of the firmest belief that he would never have become a neoconservative,” she announced in her memoir of their marriage, “The Beginning of the Journey,” adding that “nothing in his thought supports the sectarianism of the neoconservative.&quot;

The extent to which Trilling may be identified with neoconservativism continues to be contentious, forming a point of debate.

===Moderate===
Trilling has alternatively been characterized as solidly moderate, as evidenced by many statements, ranging from the very title of his novel, &quot;The Middle of the Journey&quot;, to a central passage from the novel:

Along the same lines, in reply to a taunt by Richard Sennett, &quot;You have no position; you are always in between,&quot; Trilling replied, &quot;Between is the only honest place to be.&quot;

<text>Bully is a 2001 crime drama film directed by Larry Clark, and starring Brad Renfro, Bijou Phillips, Rachel Miner, Michael Pitt, Leo Fitzpatrick, Daniel Franzese, Kelli Garner, and Nick Stahl. Its plot follows a group of teenagers in South Florida who enact a murder plot against their mutual bully who has emotionally, physically, and sexually abused them for years.

The film is based on the murder of Bobby Kent, and its screenplay was adapted by David McKenna (under the pseudonym Zachary Long) and Roger Pullis from the book &quot;Bully: A True Story of High School Revenge&quot; by Jim Schutze. Filming took place in southern Florida in the summer of 2000.

&quot;Bully&quot; was given a limited release in the United States on July 13, 2001, and met with mixed critical responses, though many critics noted the film&#x27;s disturbing handling of youth crime and murder.

==Plot==
South Florida high school dropouts Ali Willis and Lisa Connelly befriend Bobby Kent and Marty Puccio, employees at a local deli. The four go out on a double date. Later that evening, in Bobby&#x27;s parked car, Ali performs oral sex on Bobby, while Lisa and Marty have sex in the back seat. Lisa later learns she is pregnant, but is afraid that the child is Bobby&#x27;s instead of Marty&#x27;s, since Bobby raped her after beating Marty unconscious.

Bobby emotionally and physically abuses Marty, who puts up with his violent tendencies. On one occasion, Bobby rapes Ali while trying to force her to watch gay pornography with him. Lisa later tells Marty that everyone suspects Bobby is attracted to him. Marty reveals to Lisa that the abuse has been going on since they were boys, starting with Marty taking drugs at an early age, which Marty thinks that Bobby has been using to take advantage of him. Marty and Bobby later go to a gay bar, where Marty is told to strip down to his underwear and dance for money, while Bobby takes pleasure in his humiliation.

Lisa eventually proposes that the group murder Bobby. Ali recruits her new boyfriend, the pot-smoking and acid-dropping Donny Semenec, and a troubled friend, Heather Swallers, who has recently been released from rehab; Lisa recruits her cousin, the shy and nerdy Derek Dzvirko. They initially plan to kill Bobby with a gun stolen from Lisa&#x27;s mother. Ali and Lisa lure Bobby to the Everglades, the plan being that Lisa will shoot him while he has sex with Ali, but Lisa finds herself unable to do it. Realizing they need help, the group hire a supposed &quot;hitman&quot;, Derek Kaufman, a friend of Ali&#x27;s who is in actuality a tough-talking young man several years older than them.

With Kaufman&#x27;s help, the group orchestrates a new plan: they drive with Bobby to the Everglades again, and Ali again lures Bobby to the bank of a canal with the promise of sex. Heather haphazardly gives a signal to Donny, who sneaks up behind Bobby and stabs him in the back of the neck. Horrified by the violence, Ali, Heather, and Dzvirko run back to Ali&#x27;s car. Lisa watches as Marty and Donny repeatedly stab Bobby and slit his throat, before Kaufman bludgeons Bobby with a baseball bat. Kaufman forces Dzvirko to help carry the dying Bobby into the swamp, presuming alligators will consume the corpse.

Marty later realizes that he left the sheath to his diving knife at the canal. The group returns to retrieve the sheath and finds Bobby&#x27;s corpse being devoured by crabs. Lisa, Dzvirko, Ali, and Heather do not believe they did anything wrong, since they did not directly participate in Bobby&#x27;s actual death. Lisa decides to dispose of the knife, which is the only evidence linking them to the crime.

Unable to maintain the secret, Dzvirko and Lisa reveal to their other friends what they&#x27;ve done, while Ali phones in an anonymous tip to the media, alerting them to Bobby&#x27;s death. Lisa calls Kaufman and speaks to his younger brother, who says that Kaufman has already been arrested for the murder. Eventually, all the teenagers turn themselves in, with the exception of Marty, who is subsequently arrested. Some time later, the group appear in court, wearing prison jumpsuits, with Lisa visibly pregnant by this time. Marty and Donny begin to argue, leading the others to join in as they each respectively deny their culpability in front of an onlooking courtroom.

Title cards reveal the convictions the perpetrators received in real life: Derek Kaufman, Donny Semenec, and Lisa Connelly received life sentences, Ali Willis 40 years, Derek Dzvirko 11 years, Heather Swallers seven years, and Marty Puccio the death penalty, which was vacated in 1997.

==Production==
===Basis===
The film is based on the July 14, 1993 murder of Bobby Kent at a remote area in Weston, Florida, south of Alligator Alley. Four of the convicted teens, known as the &quot;Broward County Seven&quot;, were released after serving brief prison terms. Only three are still serving prison sentences as of May 2022. The book, &quot;Bully: A True Story of High School Revenge&quot; by Jim Schutze, was released in 1998. The film includes two title cards that reveal how several of the perpetrators appealed their sentences and the results of those actions.

===Development===
The film was originally slated to go into production in the mid-to-late &#x27;90s before the Columbine school shootings, but financiers backed away in the wake of the events. Screenwriter David McKenna said that the Columbine shootings, along with other high-school gun-related tragedies at the time, were justification for the script, commenting, &quot;It&#x27;s time that we woke up to the way many of our kids are living.&quot;

Several drafts of the screenplay had been written, all of which were turned down by Larry Clark in favor of filming scenes straight from Schutze&#x27;s book, which featured real court testimonies and first-hand accounts of the murder. Clark said an early screenplay draft removed any homosexual subtext, particularly the implication Bobby is gay and closeted, but Clark tried to put it back in.

===Casting===
Before Brad Renfro was cast as Marty, Jake Gyllenhaal and Ashton Kutcher were considered for the role. Clark sought Nick Stahl for the role of Bobby, though Stahl initially thought he was not right for the role, saying, &quot;If you drew the polar opposite of who I was at that time, it would probably be Bobby Kent. I mean, I was rail thin. I&#x27;d worked out twice before the movie started, so clearly it wasn&#x27;t any kind of physicality that intrigued Larry.&quot; Though Lions Gate Films thought the roles of Bobby and Marty were miscast, Clark embraced the casting of Renfro and Stahl in their respective roles because he wanted to subvert audience expectations of what a bully looks like. Casting director Carmen Cuba said, &quot;The idea of who is a bully and who gets bullied — in this case, it felt unusual to make the choice this way, but that made it more interesting and more layered.&quot;

Zooey Deschanel was originally set to play Ali Willis, but ended up filming Big Trouble that was also shooting in Florida at the time. Jared Leto was also considered for the role of Derek Kaufman before Leo Fitzpatrick, who had previously worked with Clark on &quot;Kids&quot;, was cast. Daniel Franzese had no prior screen credits and was scouted by Cuba while singing at a talent show night at a Florida bar.

Clark said that the casting of Bijou Phillips helped the film get green-lit, saying, &quot;She hadn&#x27;t acted, but that name - because she was in the paper every day for being a club kid…that name got us the money to get financed.&quot;

===Filming===
Principal photography of &quot;Bully&quot; began August 21, 2000, in southern Florida. Filming took place at many of the locations where the real-life incidents occurred. The crew was originally given 40 days to complete filming, but this was reduced to 23 days due to budgetary restrictions from Lions Gate. The shoot was said to be &quot;chaotic&quot; due to a &quot;compressed production schedule, tempestuous weather conditions, and behind-the-scenes drama.&quot;

The plainclothes officer who arrests Marty is Frank Ilarraza, a police detective who arrested the real Marty Puccio in 1993. Several production assistants on the film had attended high school with the actual perpetrators.

Producers were able to secure the rights for the song &quot;Forgot About Dre&quot; because Eminem was a fan of Clark&#x27;s work.

==Release==
&quot;Bully&quot; was originally slated for a wide theatrical release, but these plans were derailed due to executive changes at Lions Gate three weeks before release. Clark had sought an R rating for the film, but the MPAA ruled in favor of an NC-17. Clark chose to release the film unrated, and it opened on July 13, 2001 to a total of six theaters, later expanding to 20 theaters at its widest.

Screenwriter David McKenna was unhappy with the finished film and chose to be credited under the pseudonym &quot;Zachary Long&quot;.

===Home media===
The film was released in DVD and VHS on January 29, 2002. The film released in Blu-ray on October 31, 2023 in France and March 20, 2024 in Australia.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Bully&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. It has an approval rating of 54% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 90 reviews with an average score of 5.80 out of 10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;With its lingering shots of naked teenage bodies, &quot;Bully&quot; feels more sordidly exploitative than realistic.&quot; The film holds a score of 45 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 26 critics indicating &#x27;Mixed or average reviews&#x27;.

Criticism of the film largely focused on the prolonged scenes of graphic sex and nudity, particularly of its female cast, which critics called &quot;gratuitous&quot;, &quot;voyeuristic,&quot; and &quot;prurient.&quot; Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote while the film &quot;certainly does sport believe-it-or-not black-comedy aspects, some of which Clark grasps — as in [a] late courtroom scene&quot;, it &quot;seems convinced that staring agog at the banalities of affluent suburbia constitutes a scorching critique&quot;. Harvey claimed the film was hypocritical because &quot;Clark wags a shaming finger [at the audience] on one hand while the other frantically keeps titillation value at full tumescence&quot;.

Critics were also divided about the intent and messaging of the film. Manohla Dargis of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; praised how Clark &quot;catches, the way Warhol once did, the bottomed-out timelessness of too many hours spent hanging out, but since Clark is also a rigorous (and here, at least, rigid) moralist, he also puts the screws to the audience. He does it by refusing to offer up an ounce of psychological depth or rationale. He shows us a group of kids who murder then declines to really tell us why.&quot; In contrast, Rene Rodriguez of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; said, &quot;What &quot;Bully&quot; doesn&#x27;t do -- what it can&#x27;t do -- is explain how these otherwise sane kids went from merely talking about killing someone to actually doing it…Clark shies away from embellishing the story told in Schutze&#x27;s book, which means that while the movie gets the facts right, it misses the inner life of its protagonists. The kids are all surface, with nothing underneath.&quot; Rodriguez added, &quot;Although the performances are strong…the film keeps its distance, and that detachment has led some to dismiss &quot;Bully&quot; as a pointless wallow in degradation and exploitation&quot;.

Marjorie Baumgarten of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; said, &quot;The film&#x27;s naked plenitude (and pulchritude) casts suspicion on Clark&#x27;s ulterior reasons for making the movie -- especially in light of the fact that &quot;Bully&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to have an overall point of view that it&#x27;s trying to push. There are no heroes or victims, and everyone is at least a minor villain. Clark&#x27;s film is disturbing not only for what it shows, but how it shows it. If it weren&#x27;t so rivetingly realistic, it would be an easy film to dismiss. And if it weren&#x27;t so easily dismissible, it would be an easy film to defend.&quot;

David E. Williams of &quot;Film Threat&quot; described the film as &quot;simply a borderline porno flick that only becomes a real movie in its third act&quot; and critiqued the inconsistency of its character development; however, he praised the performances of Fitzpatrick, Pitt, and Garner. James Mottram of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; said compared to Clark&#x27;s film &quot;Kids&quot;, &quot;the &quot;vérité&quot; visual style is missing&quot;. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said Clark &quot;brings alive so compellingly the aimless, brutal existence&quot; of these teenagers, but &quot;whatever aspirations he may have had in attempting to make a movie of the level of Jonathan Kaplan&#x27;s &#x27;Over the Edge&#x27; or Tim Hunter&#x27;s &#x27;River&#x27;s Edge,&#x27; two classic studies of lethally disaffected suburban youth&quot;, are undercut by the film&#x27;s lingering on sex and nudity. Thomas added, &quot;Clark demands the utmost of Renfro, Miner and Stahl...[they] respond by daringly walking a tightrope between a craziness that escalates to a dark absurdity and an all-out ludicrousness. Renfro comes across as a good kid neither strong nor smart enough to resist Lisa and Bobby&#x27;s relentlessly destructive personalities&quot;.

Roger Ebert was one of the film&#x27;s notable admirers and gave the film four out of four stars. In his review, he stated: &quot;Larry Clark&#x27;s &quot;Bully&quot; calls the bluff of movies that pretend to be about murder but are really about entertainment. His film has all the sadness and shabbiness, all the mess and cruelty and thoughtless stupidity of the real thing...The movie is brilliantly and courageously well-acted by its young cast; it&#x27;s one of those movies so perceptive and wounding that there&#x27;s no place for the actors to hide, no cop out they can exercise.&quot;

Ebert added, &quot;Clark is obviously obsessed by the culture of floating, unplugged teenagers. Sometimes his camera seems too willing to watch during the scenes of nudity and sex, and there is one particular shot that seems shameless in its voyeurism...But it&#x27;s this very drive that fuels his films. If the director doesn&#x27;t have a strong personal feeling about material like this, he shouldn&#x27;t be making movies about it...I believe &quot;Bully&quot; is a masterpiece on its own terms, a frightening indictment of a society that offers absolutely nothing to some of its children—and an indictment of the children, who lack the imagination and courage to try to escape. Bobby and his killers deserve one another.&quot;

<text>Little League Baseball and Softball (officially, Little League Baseball Inc) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States, that organizes local youth baseball and softball leagues throughout the United States and the rest of the world.

Founded by Carl Edwin Stotz (1910-1992), in 1939 as a three-team league in the adjacent larger town of Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The ensuing Little League organization was incorporated on October 10, 1950, and Stotz served as first commissioner for 18 years until 1955. Little League Baseball encourages local volunteers to organize and operate Little League franchise programs that are annually chartered through Little League International. Each local league can structure itself to best serve the children in the area in which the league operates. Several specific divisions of Little League baseball and softball are available to children and adolescents ages 4 to 16. The organization holds a congressional charter authorized by the United States Congress under Title 36 of the United States Code.

The organization&#x27;s administrative office is located in South Williamsport of Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. The first Little League Baseball World Series was played in Williamsport in 1947. The Little League International Complex in South Williamsport hosts the annual tournament of the Little League Baseball World Series at Howard J. Lamade Stadium and adjacent Little League Volunteer Stadium, and is also the site of the Peter J. McGovern Little League Museum, which provides a history of Little League Baseball and Softball through interactive exhibits for children. Many Major League Baseball (MLB) players past and present in the National League and American League have started out playing in their local community / neighborhood Little Leagues.

==History==

Carl Edwin Stotz (1910-1992), a longtime resident of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, founded Little League Baseball in 1939. He began experimenting with his idea in the summer of 1938 when he gathered his nephews, Jimmy and Major Gehron, and their neighborhood friends. They tried different field dimensions over the course of the summer and played several informal games. The following summer, they felt that they were ready to establish what later became Little League Baseball. The first small league organized in Williamsport had just three teams, each sponsored by a different business. The first teams, Jumbo Pretzel, Lycoming Dairy, and Lundy Lumber Company were managed by Stotz and his friends, George and Bert Bebble. The men, joined by their wives and another couple, formed the first Little League board of directors.

The first league game took place on June 6, 1939, when Lundy Lumber defeated Lycoming Dairy, 23–8. Lycoming Dairy became the champions of the first half of the season and then defeated Lundy Lumber, the second-half champions, in a best-of-three championship series. The following year, a second league was formed in Williamsport, and Little League Baseball grew to become an international organization with nearly 200,000 teams in every U.S. state and more than 80 countries.

Kathryn &quot;Tubby&quot; Johnston Massar was the first woman to play in a Little League baseball game, in 1950. However, when that season ended, a Little League meeting was held, and it was decided that girls would be banned from Little League baseball. From 1951 through 1973, Little League baseball was restricted to boys only. In 1974, due to a lawsuit brought on behalf of Maria Pepe by the National Organization for Women, the New Jersey Superior Court decided that Little League baseball must allow girls to play. In the final week of December 1974, President Gerald Ford, signed a bill that opened Little League baseball to girls.

According to the Little League Baseball and Softball participation statistics following the 2008 season, there were nearly 2.6 million boys and girls in Little League Baseball worldwide. Of these, approximately 400,000 are registered in softball leagues (including both boys and girls). Starting in 2022, for tournament purposes, Little League Baseball was divided into 20 geographic regions: ten national and ten international. Each summer, Little League operates seven World Series tournaments in various locations throughout the U.S. (Little League softball and Junior, Senior, and Big League baseball and softball).

===Timeline===

====Early years====
1939: Little League is established by Carl E. Stotz, George Bebble, and Bert Bebble. The first season is played in a lot close to Bowman Field. Lycoming Dairy is the first season champion.

1946: Little League expands to 12 leagues, all in Pennsylvania.

1947: The first league outside of Pennsylvania is founded in Hammonton, New Jersey. Maynard League of Williamsport defeats a team from Lock Haven, Pennsylvania to win the first Little League World Series. Allen Yearick is the first Little League graduate to play professional baseball when he is signed by the Boston Braves.

1948: Little League has grown to include 94 leagues. Lock Haven returns to the Little League World Series and defeats a team from St. Petersburg, Florida. The first corporate sponsor, U.S. Rubber, donates Pro-Keds shoes to teams at the series.

1949: After a decade, Little League is featured in the nationally famous weekly longtime magazine, the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; and on newsreels shown in neighborhood movie. Commissioner Stotz receives hundreds of requests for information on forming local leagues from all over the country. Little League incorporates in the State of New York.

1950 Kay Johnston becomes the first girl to play Little League baseball. She cuts her hair, dresses as a boy and adopts the nickname &quot;Tubby&quot; to join the Kings Dairy Little League team in Corning, New York as a boy. After earning her way onto the team and being assigned first base, she tells her coach that she is a girl, but he keeps her on the team. She is forced to quit after just one season because a new rule, known as the Tubby Rule, is created to bar girls from participation. The rule remains in force until 1974.

1951: Leagues are formed in the western province on the Pacific Ocean coast of British Columbia, in the neighboring Dominion of Canada to the north and in the old U.S. territory of the Panama Canal Zone surrounding the Panama Canal, in Central America, making them the first youth baseball leagues outside the United States.

1953: The Little League World Series is televised for the first time. Jim McKay provided the play-by-play for the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), and Howard Cosell, does so for the American Broadcasting Company and ABC News Radio. Joey Jay, of Middletown, Connecticut, and the Milwaukee Braves is the first Little League graduate to play in Major League Baseball. In 1953, Robert Francis Morrison filed an official charter with Little League Baseball to admit the Cannon Street Y.M.C.A. as its first all-black team. The league consisted of four teams, sponsored by prominent black businesses in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1955, in the beginnings of the growing nation-wide Civil rights movement, when, Morrison entered his Cannon Street All-Stars into the city tournament, white leagues reacted by drafting a resolution requesting a whites-only tournament. All 55 white teams eventually withdrew from the city and state tournament. The Cannon Street All-Stars became the 1955 South Carolina state champions by forfeit. However, they were informed by then national Little League Baseball president Peter J. McGovern that they would not be permitted to represent the state at the regional championships in Williamsport. Little League executives invited the Cannon Street All-Stars as guests to attend the tournament in which they were barred from playing.

1954: Boog Powell, outfielder/first baseman later of the Baltimore Orioles and two other MLB teams, plays in the Little League World Series for Lakeland, Florida, and Ken Hubbs, later of the Chicago Cubs, plays for Colton, California. Little League had expanded to more than 3,300 leagues. Jim Barberi, later of the MLB National League pennant winner of the 1966 Los Angeles Dodgers, is a member a decade earlier of the Schenectady, New York, team that wins the 1954 L.L.B. World Series tournament championship.

1955: There is a Little League organization now in each of the 48 continental U.S. states. Young George W. Bush, (son of George H. W. Bush), begins playing Little League as a catcher for the Cubs of the Central Little League in Midland, Texas. He is the first Little League graduate to be elected President of the United States. After white teams in South Carolina refuse to play against the all-black Cannon Street YMCA All-Stars of Charleston, Little League issues an ultimatum that the team must be permitted to play, but many organizations in the Southern United States suspend and turn in their league charters and form their own league in response. No team from South Carolina would reach the World Series tournament until 2015.

1956: Stotz severs his ties with Little League Baseball, Inc. after 18 years in a dispute over the direction, policies and control of the league. Stotz believed that the league was becoming overly commercialized by then-president Peter J. McGovern. Stotz remains active in youth baseball with the &quot;Original League&quot; in Williamsport for the next 38 years until his death in June 1992. Little League records its first on-field death in Garland, Texas, when 12-year-old Richard Oden is hit in the head by a pitch, and the park where the incident occurred is renamed Rick Oden Field. With batting helmets yet to be developed, Garland League teams finish the season wearing youth football helmets over their baseball caps when batting. Later in the year, pitcher Fred Shapiro throws a perfect game in the Little League World Series.

1999: Burkina Faso becomes the 100th nation with a Little League organization. Hirkata Little League of Osaka, Japan becomes the first Japanese team to win a title since 1976.

2000: An expansion project begins at Little League International and Volunteer Stadium is built. This allows the pool of participants to double from 8 to 16 the following year.

2001: The Little League World Series expands from 8 to 16 teams, with the following changes to regional lineups (post-2000 regions in bold):
* US regions:
** The East Region splits into the New England and Mid-Atlantic Regions.
** The Central Region splits into the Great Lakes and Midwest Regions.
** The South Region splits into the Southeast and Southwest Regions.
** The West Region spins off the Northwest Region.
* International regions:
** Canada remains intact as a region.
** The Latin America Region spins off new regions for the Caribbean and Mexico.
** The Far East Region splits into the Asia and Pacific Regions.
** The Europe Region spins off the TransAtlantic Region.
*** These two regions were geographically identical, differing in the required composition of playing rosters. Transatlantic teams were required to consist of a majority of players who were nationals of the US, Canada, or Japan. Europe teams could have no more than three nationals of those countries.

Volunteer Stadium opens. George W. Bush becomes the first U.S. president to visit the Little League World Series. Led by Danny Almonte, who pitched the first perfect game since 1957, the Rolando Paulino All Stars (Bronx, New York) finish third in the series. However, the team&#x27;s entire postseason is wiped from the books when it is found that Almonte is 14 years old.

2002: Austin Dillon plays for Southwest Forsyth (County) Little League in Clemmons, North Carolina. The grandson of Richard Childress, he would win NASCAR championships in the Truck Series in 2011 and Nationwide Series in 2013, and made his Cup Series debut in 2014.

2004: Effective with the 2004 LLWS, the Europe Region is renamed EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa).

2007: Little League expands into Kyrgyzstan for the first time.

2008: Effective with this year&#x27;s LLWS, the Transatlantic and EMEA regions are reorganized into the Europe and Middle East and Africa (MEA) regions. The previous nationality restrictions for players from these regions are abolished. Hawaii wins the 2008 Little League World Series, defeating Mexico in the final game.

2008: Little League International relocates the Southeast Region headquarters from Gulfport, Florida, to Warner Robins, Georgia. Little League International completes renovation of its administration building in South Williamsport.

2010: The World Series tournament is reorganized, eliminating pool play and adopting double-elimination until the bracket winners are determined. Little League announces plans to add a pilot division in baseball for ages 12–13 to help baseball Little Leaguers make the transition to regulation-size fields in Junior League Baseball. Bartlett, Illinois, becomes the largest league.

2011: The World Series officially eliminates the two four-team brackets and puts all eight teams in the United States bracket and all eight teams in the International bracket, with a SEC baseball tournament-style flipped bracket on the loser&#x27;s bracket in order to prevent rematches, but does not require the loser to defeat the winner&#x27;s bracket team twice in either Saturday championship game from which the winner advances to the Sunday final.

2012: The Middle East and Africa Region produces the first team from the African continent in the Little League World Series, one from Lugazi Little League of Uganda.

On August 29, Little League announces a major reorganization of the international brackets, effective with the 2013 LLWS:
* Australia is spun off from the Asia–Pacific Region and will receive its own berth in the LLWS. This reflects Australia&#x27;s rise to become the fourth-largest country, and largest outside North America, in Little League participation.
* The Middle East and Africa Region is disbanded.
* Middle Eastern countries, except for Israel and Turkey (which had been in the Europe Region – see below), are placed in the Asia–Pacific Region.
* African countries are to be placed in the former Europe Region, which is renamed the Europe and Africa Region. Israel and Turkey, members of the European zone of the International Baseball Federation, remain in the renamed region.

The Intermediate (50/70) Division, which had operated on a pilot basis since the 2011 season, is announced as an official Little League division, the first new division since 1999. The division, which launches fully in the 2013 season, has the same age limits as standard Little League but extends the pitching rubber to 50 feet from home plate and features bases 70 feet apart. The field is also larger than in standard Little League, and the rules are closer to those of standard baseball.

2013: Davie Jane Gilmour becomes the first woman to lead the Little League board of directors.

The first Intermediate Little League World Series is held in Livermore, California.

2014: On August 15, 2014, Mo&#x27;ne Davis of the Taney Dragons becomes the first girl in Little League World Series history to earn a win as a pitcher and to pitch a shutout. Davis also becomes the first Little Leaguer to appear on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; (issue date: August 25, 2014). ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the August 20 semifinal game, featuring Davis, brings a 3.4 overnight rating, which is an all-time high for Little League on the network.

Jackie Robinson West becomes the first all-African-American Little League team to win the U.S. championship, but its title is later stripped after violations of the 1997 region regulations are discovered.

2018: Little League changes its age rules, moving the birthday deadline from May 1 back to August 31. This allowed 13-year-olds to play Majors level this year against 11-year-olds, but 11-year-olds born between May and August were unable to play the following year.

2020: The LLWS is canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

2021: The LLWS is contested with a 16-team field of U.S.-only teams, another effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.

2022: The LLWS is held without COVID-related restrictions for the first time since 2019. The tournament size increases from 16 to 20 teams, with the addition of two new regions within the U.S. and two additional direct qualifiers among international teams.

==Baseball divisions==
Little League Baseball has several baseball divisions based on age.

===Summary chart of major divisions in Little League Baseball===

The major divisions of Little League Baseball have their own World Series format as follows:
===Tee-ball===
Tee-ball is for boys and girls ages 4–7. In tee-ball, players hit the ball off of a tee located atop home plate; live pitching is not allowed. The purpose of the division is to teach young children the fundamentals of hitting and fielding.

===Minor League===

The Minor League Baseball division is generally for children ages 5–11, with local leagues given the option to allow 6-year-old children to try out. Local leagues are permitted to further divide the Minor League division based on player age and/or experience, and often consist of coach-pitch (i.e., the batter&#x27;s coach lightly pitching the ball) or machine-pitch at lower levels, with defensive players pitching at higher levels.

===9–10 Year Old division===
The 9–10 Year Old Baseball division is a tournament program, established in 1994. It has competitions up to the state level, and the size of the diamond is the same as in the Little League division (with sides and a pitching distance).

===Little League (or the Major Division)===

The Little League Baseball division, also known as the Major Division, is for children aged 9 through 12, though local leagues have the option of barring 9 or 10 year olds from participating. The diamond has base paths measuring and a pitching distance of . The local league can form an &quot;All Stars&quot; team consisting of players throughout the local teams, which can enter an international tournament culminating with the Little League World Series.

===Little League Intermediate (50/70) Division===

In 2012, Little League announced plans to add a new division of play for the 2013 season, the Little League Intermediate Division. This division is played on a field with a pitching distance and base paths. It is open to players ages 11–13, but may be limited to ages 11–12 or 12–13 by a local league. Players in this division are able to lead off and steal bases. The rules are similar to those of the Junior, Senior, and Big League divisions of play.

Little League holds a World Series in this level of play, officially called the Intermediate Little League World Series, in Livermore, California.

===Junior, Senior, and Big Leagues===

The Junior League, Senior League, and Big League Baseball divisions operate similarly for different age groups. All three use a conventionally-sized baseball diamond, with between bases and a pitching distance. Similarly to the Major Division, local leagues can form &quot;All Stars&quot; teams from each age group and enter a tournament, again leading up to a &quot;World Series&quot;, for each division. The Junior League consists of 12–14 year olds, the Senior League consists of 13–16 year olds, and the Big League was for 16–18 year olds. The Big League division was eliminated after the 2015–2016 season.

==Challenger program==
Little League introduced the Challenger Division in 1989 to provide opportunities for children with physical and intellectual challenges to participate in the Little League program. The Challenger Division utilizes a &quot;buddy system&quot; in which Little Leaguers assist Challenger participants in the areas of batting, running and fielding. Challenger Division games are typically non-competitive in nature.

===Little League Challenger Division===
Introduced in 1989, the Little League Challenger Division is for participants ages 4–18. Games are played on a 46/60 field and are non-competitive.

===Senior League Challenger Division===
Approved at the 2014 Little League International Congress, the Senior League Challenger Division launched in 2015. This division is for participants ages 15 and above (no maximum age). Games are played on a 60/90 field and are non-competitive. Leagues may request permission to play games on a smaller field as well.

===Participation===
As of 2018, nearly 1,000 Little Leagues in 10 countries around the world offer the Challenger Program, providing an opportunity for more than 31,000 individuals with physical or intellectual challenges to participate in the Little League program.

==Softball divisions==
Little League Baseball has several softball divisions for girls and boys, based on age.

==Rules==
Playing rules for the baseball divisions essentially follow the official baseball rules defined and used by Major League Baseball, especially with respect to the upper divisions (Junior, Senior, and Big League). Some major exceptions are outlined in the following sections, and these apply to Little League (Minor and Major, ages 7–12) except as otherwise noted.

===Rulebooks and fees===
Unlike Major League Baseball and most other sports such as football, soccer, and basketball, the official rules of Little League Baseball are available to the general public only by a $20 online subscription or as a $7 printed edition. In Canada, rulebook orders requested through LittleLeague.ca are routed to the US website at the same prices.

Rulebooks are not available in stores and must be ordered directly from Little League Baseball or from one of its regional centers. One paper copy is provided to each chartered team.

Little League has been criticized for requiring payment to view its rules. However, the organization counters that it has been exposed to litigation involving &quot;outlaw&quot; organizations not officially affiliated with Little League that use its rules.

===Length of game===
A regulation game consists of six innings. If the game is halted prior to the completion of six innings, it is considered an official game if four innings have been completed (three and a half, if the home team leads); otherwise, if at least one inning has been completed, it is a suspended game.

In Intermediate Little League, as well as the Junior, Senior, and Big League levels (ages 13–18), a game consists of seven innings and is official if five innings have been completed.

===Mandatory-play rule===
In all divisions except Senior and Big League, every player on the team roster must have at least one plate appearance and play six consecutive outs on defense in each game. The penalty for a manager violating the rule is a two-game suspension. This rule is waived if the game is completed prior to the usual duration (six innings in Little League and below, seven innings in Intermediate Little League and Junior League). This rule is modified during tournament play, when teams having 13 or more players dressed are mandated to provide one plate appearance for each player, but have no defensive requirements. Teams having 12 or fewer players dressed are required to afford each player one plate appearance plus six consecutive outs in the field on defense.

===Playing field===
The size of the field is dependent on the division of play.

Tee-ball
:The distance between the bases is generally .

Minor League and Little League
:The distance between the bases is and the distance from the pitcher&#x27;s mound to home plate (more precisely, the midpoint of the front edge of the pitcher&#x27;s rubber to the rear point of home plate) is . Outfield fences must be at least from home plate, but are usually or more (the fields at the Williamsport complex have fences 225 feet away). The bases and pitching rubber are also slightly smaller than in standard baseball. Also, unlike fields at almost all levels of competitive baseball for teenagers and adults, the distance between home plate and the outfield fence is constant throughout fair territory.

Intermediate Little League
:The distance between the bases is and the distance from the pitcher&#x27;s mound to home plate is . The recommended distance between home plate and the outfield fence ranges from ; unlike regular Little League, the distances can vary within fair territory. As in regular Little League, the bases and pitching rubber are also slightly smaller than in standard baseball.

Junior League, Senior League, and Big League
:The distance between the bases is , the same as for regulation Major League Baseball fields. The distance between the pitcher&#x27;s mound and home plate is , also identical to that of MLB. The minimum outfield distance in the upper divisions is (MLB&#x27;s official, but not strictly enforced, minimum is at the foul lines), while the maximum for Big League is . (Base paths of are optional for Junior League regular season play.)

===Equipment===

Bats (all levels) may be made from wood or other materials (such as aluminum) and must be approved for use in Little League Baseball. For the Majors division and below, the maximum bat length is 33 inches (838 mm) and barrel diameter may not exceed . Since 2009, all Little League bats must be labeled with a Bat Performance Factor (BPF) of 1.15 or lower.

Bats for the Junior League level may have a maximum length of 34 inches (864 mm) and a maximum barrel diameter of . Bats for the Big and Senior League levels may have a maximum length of 36 inches (914 mm) and a maximum barrel diameter of . Non-wood Big and Senior League bats must meet the Batted Ball Coefficient of Restitution (BBCOR) testing standards that are currently used in the NCAA and NFHS (high school). Intermediate Little League bats must meet Junior League specifications.

===Base running===
When the pitcher is ready to pitch, a baserunner may not leave the base until the pitch reaches the batter in Minor League and standard Little League. In the upper levels, including Intermediate Little League, the runner may leave the base at any time while the ball is in play.

If a fielder is waiting at the base with the ball, an advancing runner must attempt to avoid contact. A runner may not slide head-first except when retreating to a previously held base.

In the upper levels, runners must still make an attempt to avoid contact if possible, and may not maliciously initiate contact with a fielder.

===Batting===
The upper limit of the strike zone extends to the batter&#x27;s armpits.

In tee-ball, Minor League, and Little League (if the uncaught third strike rule is waived by the local league), the batter is out after the third strike regardless of whether the pitched ball is held by the catcher. In Little League (both standard and Intermediate), Junior, Senior, and Big League, a batter may attempt to advance to first base on a dropped third strike if first base is unoccupied with less than two outs, or if first base is unoccupied or occupied with two outs.

If the batter is hit by a pitch, the batter receives a base on balls automatically. However, if the batter does not make an attempt evade the pitched ball, the home-plate umpire may continue the at-bat.

===Substitution===
Players who have been substituted may return to the game under certain conditions, though a player who is removed as pitcher may not return to pitch.

===Pitchers===
Pitchers in all divisions are limited to a specific pitch count per game and a mandatory rest period between outings. These vary with age. The rest period also depends on the number of pitches thrown.

If the pitcher hits too many batters with the ball, or intentionally hits the batter, he or she is ejected from the pitching spot.

;Intentional base on balls
Historically, a pitcher could intentionally walk a batter by simply announcing the intent to do so, without being required to throw any pitches. Beginning in 2008, the pitcher was required to actually pitch the required four balls (which are included in the pitcher&#x27;s overall pitch count). In 2017, the Major and Minor levels of Little League Baseball aligned with an MLB rule and now allow the pitcher to intentionally walk a batter simply by declaration, though four pitches are added to the pitcher&#x27;s overall pitch count. This change rescinded a former rule by which the batting team could decline the award of first base and force the pitcher to throw four balls, thereby increasing the pitcher&#x27;s overall count.

===Local options===
Local leagues have a certain amount of flexibility. For example, a league may opt to use the &quot;continuous batting order&quot; rule (4.04), under which each player on the team&#x27;s roster bats, even when not in the defensive lineup. Leagues may also waive the &quot;ten-run rule&quot; (4.10(e)), which ends the game if one team is ahead by ten or more runs after four innings.

<text>Since the early 1970s, Brittany has experienced a tremendous revival of its folk music. Along with flourishing traditional forms such as the bombard-biniou pair and fest-noz ensembles incorporating other additional instruments, it has also branched out into numerous subgenres.

== Traditional Breton music ==

Traditional Breton folk music includes a variety of vocal and instrumental styles. Purely traditional musicians became the heroes of the roots revival in the second half of the 20th century, notably the Goadec sisters (Maryvonne, Thasie, and Eugénie). At the end of the 19th century, the vicomte Theodore Hersart de la Villemarqué&#x27;s collection of largely nationalistic Breton songs, &quot;Barzaz Breiz&quot;, was also influential, and was partially responsible for preserving Breton traditions.

=== Vocal music ===

Kan ha diskan (roughly translated as &quot;call and response singing&quot;) is probably the most common type of Breton vocal music, and is the most typical style to accompany dance music. It has become perhaps the most integral part of the Breton roots revival, and was the first genre of Breton music to gain some mainstream success, both in Brittany and abroad.

The lead singer is the &quot;kaner&quot;, and the second singer is the &quot;diskaner&quot;. The &quot;kaner&quot; sings a phrase, and the &quot;diskaner&quot; sings the last few lines with the &quot;kaner&quot;, then repeats it alone until the same last few lines, when the &quot;kaner&quot; again joins in. The phrase&#x27;s repetition is changed slightly in each execution. &quot;Kan ha diskan&quot; can be songs about any subject, but must meet one of a number of meters used in folk dances, mostly line or round. Vocables, or nonsense syllables (typically &quot;tra la la la leh no&quot;), are sometimes used to drag outlines. Usually, a &quot;kan ha diskan&quot; lasts from 5 to 20 minutes.

In addition to the Goadecs, the singer Loeiz Ropars was largely responsible for maintaining &quot;Kan Ha Diskan&quot;&#x27;s vitality in the middle of the 20th century, and the 1960s and 1970s revivalists drew largely on his work. They also venerated performers like Ar Vreudeur Morvan and Les soeurs Goadec/Ar c&#x27;hoarezed Goadeg. During the folk revival, aspiring musicians sought out elder teachers from whom to learn &quot;kan ha diskan&quot;, generally being viewed as successful when the student can act as a &quot;diskaner&quot; to their mentor. Teachers of this era included Marcel Guilloux and Yann-Fanch Kemener.

It was, however, Ropars who adapted the fest-noz, a &quot;night party&quot; in rural communities, for a new type of fest-noz (amplification for the singers), and set the stage for the folk revival.

=== Kantikoù (hymns) ===

 (&quot;canticle&quot;) is a type of hymn that is vocal but includes accompaniment from a variety of instruments, commonly including the harp, pipes and organ. Modern performers include Anne Auffret and the choir Ensemble Choral du Bout du Monde.

=== Gwerzioù and sonioù (laments and ballads) ===

&quot;Gwerzioù&quot; and &quot;sonioù&quot; are the two primary classifications of Breton unaccompanied folk songs. Vocals for both types are usually by a soloist. A &quot;gwerz&quot; is a lament characterized by a gloomy tone and subject matter. A Gwerz typically describes tragic events such as murders, deaths, wars, forced emigration or lost love.

Performers in this field include Jean Le Meut from Vannes, whose songs are mostly of the &quot;sonioù&quot; variety, and are typically pastoral songs concerning love and marriage. More contemporary singers include Iffig Troadeg, who focuses on lyrically shocking gwerzioù, Patrick Marie, Marthe Vassalo, Klervi Rivière, Mathieu Hamon, Annie Ebrel, Erik Marchand and Denez Prigent.

=== Chants de marins (sailor songs) ===
The chants de marins, are shanties, ballads about shipwrecks, sailing and loss of life, often accompanied by instruments such as the fiddle and accordion.

Although it is not exclusively Breton, the large number of sailors in this region have given this form of musical expression a high-profile. The best known modern performers are Djiboudjep and Cabestan, along with numerous but less known bands such as Tonnerre de Brest, L&#x27;Echo, Les Boucaniers or Taillevent. There are new composers too : Michel Tonnerre is a well-known modern composer of &quot;Chants de marins&quot; ; some of his compositions are as famous as ancient songs (&quot;Quinze marins&quot;, &quot;Satanicles&quot;, &quot;Vire au cabestan&quot;, &quot;Mon petit garçon&quot;).

There is an annual &quot;Chants de marins&quot; contest in the small town of Paimpol, in north Brittany, where the most famous shantymen of the world meet. At any harbour festival in Brittany &quot;Chants de marins&quot; can usually be heard.

=== Instrumental music ===
Since the Breton folk music revival, Scottish bagpipes and Irish harps have been added to the Breton repertoire, though Brittany retains its own unbroken piping traditions as well as mainstay instruments such as the bombard.

==== Celtic harp ====

Though the harp had been common in Brittany in the Middle Ages, the instrument had disappeared by the 18th century, at least in its specific repertoire and making. Early in the 20th century, a Breton harpist Paul Diverres living in Wales came several times to play in Brittany. Just before and after the Second World War, Gildas Jaffrenou built a harp from the 14th-century plans for the Brian Boru model. But this was not enough for a revival.

In 1952–1953, Jord Cochevelou built the first Breton new-Celtic harp. Since then and during the 50s, the Celtic harp or Breton harp has taken its place back into Breton music thanks to Jord and his son Alan Cochevelou; Alan was the first person to play it in public and became world-famous under his stage name Alan Stivell.

Modern Breton performers include Myrdhin, An Triskell, Kristen Nogues and Dominig Bouchaud.

==== Violin ====
The &quot;violin&quot; is an instrument played across France. Perhaps because of this wide-ranging appeal and lack of regional uniqueness, the instrument was somewhat ignored during the Breton folk revival in the mid-20th century. However, the instrument remains a common part of Breton folk bands today.

The violin has been played in Brittany since at least the 17th century, and was possibly the most widespread instrument in the land by the early 20th century. It was only a few decades later, however, that the accordion nearly wiped the violon out, and most fiddlers joined Irish bands, moved into jazz or otherwise left the instrument. The violon survived, however. Alan Stivell has used the fiddle and electric violin in his arrangements and compositions since his first album in 1970, inviting different fiddlers for his tours and records. It opened the way for a new generation of performers including Christian Lemaitre, Jackie Molard and the six-violin band Archétype.

==== Clarinet (treujenn-gaol) ====
The clarinet was invented in Germany in the 18th century. It evolved from earlier single reed instruments such as the renaissance chalumeaux, or schalmei. Clarinets were quickly incorporated into orchestras, from where they moved into marching bands and the amateur musicians in them. By the 19th century, the clarinet had entered a number of folk traditions and spread to many parts of the world. In Brittany, the instrument is called a &quot;treujenn-gaol&quot; (Breton), which translates as &quot;cabbage stalk&quot;.

The traditional Breton clarinet usually has only 13 keys (though sometimes as few as six), in contrast to the more common &#x27;Boehm&#x27; instrument used in jazz, classical music and other fields. This is because classical musicians discarded the clarinets with fewer keys in favor of more complex and state-of-the-art pieces.

After a decline in use in traditional music, the instrument came back, notably in the music of the bagad and paired with the accordion.

In Breton music, two clarinetists typically play together, though they also play in ensembles with accordions and violins. The clarinet is a common part of Breton jazz bands, along with saxophones and drums, playing both jazz and traditional songs.

The best-known Breton clarinetists are probably Erik Marchand, a former member of both Quintet Clarinettes and Gwerz, Gallo musician Yves LeBlanc, and Christian Duro, who plays in the group Termajik. The bands Darhaou, Tonnerre de Brest, L&#x27;Echo, Cabestan and Strobinell have also used clarinets.

==== Guitar ====
Perhaps the earliest popularizer of Breton guitar was Dan Ar Braz, who continues to be an influential figure in a somewhat jazzy, easy-listening vein. In the traditional music world, Soïg Siberil emerged as the pre-eminent master of &#x27;open tuning&#x27; in bands such as Gwerz and Kornog, developing a complex accompaniment and solo technique easily comparable to that of artists such as John Renbourn or Pierre Bensusan. Another guitarist of note is Gilles Le Bigot, who performed with Kornog as well and has been a mainstay of the Breton super-group Skolvan for more than 20 years. Other notable Breton guitarists include Jacques Pellen, Pat O&#x27;May, Nicolas Quemener, Fabrice Carre, Roland Conq and Arnaud Royer, who has developed a unique and complex self-accompaniment technique based on sampling and then playing along with loops of his own work.

==== Wooden flute ====
The wooden transverse flute entered Brittany only relatively recently, popularized by Jean Michel Veillon. Veillon has been a member of a number of prominent bands, including Pennoù Skoulm, Barzaz, Den and Kornog, as well as producing some influential solo albums. Other performers include Youenn Le Cam of Pevar Den, Jean Luc Thomas of Kej, Yannig Alory of Carré Manchot, Yann Herri Ar Gwicher of Strobinell and Hervé Guillo of Storvan, and also Gilles Lehart, who is one of Brittany&#x27;s most respected wooden flute makers.

==== Accordion ====
The accordion only arrived in large numbers in the country in about 1875, but its popularity grew quickly. Among the reasons for this were the instrument&#x27;s cheapness and durability, which could be played solo, and was easier to learn. Perhaps the most important reason, though, was the instrument&#x27;s association with &#x27;kof ha kof&#x27; couples dancing like waltzes and mazurkas, which stood in stark contrast to the line and round dances familiar in Breton folk; the perceived sexuality of the instrument&#x27;s common dances may have made it more attractive. By the 1920s, the instrument was more popular than any other. In the 1930s, chromatic accordions arrived in Brittany and jazz-influenced bands with saxophones, drum kits and banjos were formed.

Contemporary accordionists include Cocktail Diatonique, Regis Huiban, Bruno Le Tron, Patrick Lefebvre, Yann Dour, Yann-Fañch Perroches and Alain Pennec.

==== Bagpipes ====
There are two types of bagpipes indigenous to Brittany. The veuze is very similar to other western European bagpipes such as the Gaita from Galicia and Asturies, while the biniou kozh (&quot;old biniou&quot; in Breton) is much smaller and is used to accompany the bombarde. The biniou, which plays exactly one octave above the bombarde, and bombarde duo (&quot;soner ar couple&quot;) are an integral and common part of Breton folk music, and was used historically for dance music. The two performers play alternate lines that intersect at the end, in a similar manner to the Kan ha Diskan style of singing; the bombarde does not usually play every line of the tune, however, usually instead playing every other line, or three out of four lines in a dance tune. The Highland bagpipe, which was imported in the late 19th century, is often called &quot;binioù braz&quot;, sometimes &quot;pib-veur&quot; (the large biniou, the large pipe). The image to the right shows the binioù braz, or highland bagpipes, with bombardes in the hands of the men in the background.

===== Veuze =====
The &quot;veuze&quot; has a chanter of conical bore fitted with a double reed and a drone fitted with one reed, both attached to a mouth-inflated bag. Its sound and design are similar to Flemish pipes and Galician gaita. In the 20th century, the term &quot;veuze&quot; came to be applied to the diatonic accordion, which had been recently imported, and the use of the bagpipes declined. Though still not common, it has rebounded since the Breton folk revival.

===== Binioù bras =====

The binioù bras (literally the &quot;big binioù&quot;), or Great Highland bagpipe, was imported in the late 19th century, and became popular in the 1930s. It is now used in solo performances, along with a bombarde in a duo, and as part of the bagad, a kind of pipe band.

The idea of the &quot;bagad&quot; comes from World War II: Breton soldiers saw pipe bands in Scotland, and brought the idea and instrument back with them to Brittany. There, they added bombardes along with the bagpipes drums and called the ensemble bagad (&quot;company&quot; in Breton). These ensembles gained in popularity in the 1950s, just before the folk revival began, and remain very popular to this day.

===== Binioù kozh =====
The &quot;binioù kozh&quot; is more traditional and predates the introduction of the highland bagpipes to Brittany. It was originally designed from the &quot;veuze&quot; in order to play in a higher register. Its pitch is higher and its chanter smaller than any other European bagpipe. Originally, it was common in the Breton-speaking area. It is often played as part of a duo with the bombarde, for dance accompaniment.

==== Bombard ====
The bombard (Breton, Fr. &quot;bombarde&quot;) is a conical-bore double-reed instrument similar to the oboe, and like an oboe uses reeds made of cane.

In its most primitive form the bombard has six open holes and possibly a seventh that is often closed with a key. It has a range of just over an octave. Bombards come in a number of keys, based on region or intended use. B-flat is a popular choice for those playing in a Bagad alongside the &quot;binioù braz&quot; (Scottish Highland pipes). In the contemporary setting bombards may also have complex simple system key-work enabling significant chromatic possibilities. In Breton, the bombard is also known as the &quot;talabard&quot;, and a bombard player as a &quot;talabarder&quot;.

The bombard has been in use since the 15th century, and has traditionally been played as part of a duo with the binioù kozh since the French Revolution. Later, in the 19th century, the &quot;binioù braz&quot; (highland bagpipe) was introduced to Brittany.

Biniou and bombarde duos include Jean Baron and Christian Anneix, Youenn Le Bihan and Patrick Molard, and Pierre Crépillon and Laurent Bigot.

In recent years the bombard has been paired and recorded with other instruments not traditionally associated with Breton folk music, such as the organ. Sacred music is well served by the clear, strong sound of the bombard, in combination with the traditional organ. The late Jegat and Yhuel are renowned for this use of the bombard.

==== Piston ====
Breton musician, teacher, and luthier Youenn Le Bihan invented the piston in 1983. The piston is a contemporary development of the hautboy or baroque oboe, influenced by the bombard. It is typically rooted in the key of D and features simple system key-work to expand its range. The tone of the piston stands in a warm and rich middle ground between the trumpet-like tone of the bombard and that of the baroque oboe.

== Breton pop music ==

Undoubtedly the most famous name in modern Breton music is Alan Stivell, who popularized the Celtic harp first in the fifties and sixties and on a wider level since the 1970s, with a series of albums including most famously &quot;Renaissance de la Harpe Celtique&quot; (1971). His first harps were built by his father; the Celtic harp was long forgotten in Brittany before.

In 1955, he began playing the bombarde, a smaller version of the double-reeded shawm (which later evolved into the oboe). Later, he took up the Scottish bagpipe and became pipe major. Alan Stivell began (in the mid-60s) recording Breton folk, Celtic harp, and other Celtic music, mixing influences from American rock and roll and the main musical genres.

Stilvell&#x27;s performance at the Olympia Music Hall in Paris in February 1972 was broadcast live on Europe 1 radio to seven million listeners. &quot;Tri Martolod&quot;, &quot;Suite Sudarmoricaine&quot;, &quot;An Alarc&#x27;h&quot;, and &quot;Pop Plinn&quot; became famous hymns. The Olympia album sold 1,500,000 copies. If his work as composer, producer, and author has been very important, so has been his work of promotion and communication to the major audiences, in Brittany, France, Europe and the English-speaking countries.

Stivell&#x27;s most important contribution to the Breton music scene, however, has probably been his importation of rock and other American styles, as well as the formation of the idea of a Breton band. Stivell has made 22 albums and toured all over the world, influencing many musicians everywhere, experimenting with many different fusions (Rock, Jazz-rock, Blues, Symphonic, Indian, African, Electro, Hip-hop, etc.).

Inspired by Alan Stivell, a very large Breton scene grew up, especially after his Olympia concert in 1972. It was a true revolution: hundreds of bands, thousands of musicians, of Festoù-noz, etc. grew in the year after. Bands like Kornog and Gwerz arose, adapting elements of the Irish and Scottish Celtic music scene.
The most famous group of Breton musicians after Alan Stivell is Tri Yann, from Nantes (their original name is &quot;Tri Yann an Naoned&quot;, literally &quot;the Three Johns from Nantes&quot;). They formed in 1972 and still remain very popular, describing themselves as producing &quot;progressive rock-folk-celto-medieval&quot; music. They have produced some musical gems, now standards, like &quot;&quot;Les filles des Forges&quot;, &quot;Les prisons de Nantes&quot;, &quot;La Jument de Michao&quot;, &quot;Pelot d&#x27;Hennebont&quot;, and new interpretation of Irish music, like &quot;Cad é sin don té sin&quot;, &quot;Si mort a mors&quot; (originally &quot;An Cailín Rua&quot;), &quot;La ville que j&#x27;ai tant aimée&quot;&quot; (from &quot;The town I loved so well&quot;), &quot;Mrs McDermott&quot; (from the 17th-century Irish harpist Ó Carolan) and &quot;Kalonkadour&quot; (from &quot;Planxty Irwin&quot;).

Another famous band is Soldat Louis, from Port Louis, across the harbour from the city of Lorient. More rock-oriented, they play modern compositions about Brittany and life on the sea (&quot;&quot;Du rhum, des femmes&quot;, &quot;Martiniquaise&quot;, &quot;Pavillon noir&quot;&quot;). Also from the 80s, Ar Re Yaouank played lively driving folk rock songs with pro-Breton themes.

Red Cardell crosses over roots music from Brittany, Ukraine or North Africa with Rock and French realistic songs. Many times they play on stage with guests such as Dave Pegg (Fairport Convention, Jethro Tull), Jimme O&#x27;Neill (The Silencers), Dan Ar Braz, Dr Das (Asian Dub Foundation) or Stéfane Mellino (Les Négresses Vertes)... Their album &quot;soleil blanc&quot; has been recorded and mixed by the English producer Clive Martin (Queen, Sting, David Byrne...) Similarly, EV combined Finnish influences in their Breton folk-rock style, calling it Celto-Finnic rock.
Since then, a new scene of Breton songwriters appeared in Brittany (Gérard Jaffrès, Nolwenn Korbell, Dom Duff).

Les Ramoneurs de menhirs do Celtic punk, playing original songs, traditional ones and cover versions mostly in Breton.

Besides folk-rock, recent groups have included world music influences into their repertoires – especially younger groups such as Wig-a-Wag. Hip hop with a Celtic flavour has been espoused by groups such as Manau from Paris.

The band Merzhin uses traditional Celtic instruments along with electric guitars and bass. Their melodies and harmonies are inspired by Celtic music as well as by modern rock and roll.

In the USA, the group Trouz Bras (&quot;Big Noise&quot;) is led by Welshman Ray Price. The group is based in Rhode Island and features bombarde and Breton bagpipes. In Seattle, Washington a Fest Noz group called Sonerion features piston, bombard, guitar/bouzouki, accordion, and bass. In Austin, Texas, Poor Man&#x27;s Fortune is well known for performing Breton music featuring biniou, bombarde, accordion, subois (similar to the &quot;piston&quot;), violin, flute and biniou braz.

Brittany hosts many annual rock and pop festivals, not related to traditional music. The biggest in Brittany and France, and one of the most important in Europe, is the &quot;Festival des Vieilles Charrues&quot; (held in late July in Carhaix, Finistère). See also the &quot;Route du Rock&quot; (mid-August, Saint-Malo) and the &quot;Transmusicales&quot; of Rennes, held in early December.

For its 2014 edition, the &quot;Festival des Vieilles Charrues&quot; (The festival of old plows) announces its new creation: The Celtic Social Club, a supergroup of seven Breton musicians and others, which included Jimme O&#x27;Neill (The Silencers), Ronan Le Bars (Héritage des Celtes) and the three members of Red Cardell.

=== Chanteurs engagés ===
A &quot;chanteur engagé&quot; (literally &quot;[ideologically] engaged singer&quot;) is a singer who is roughly analogous to a singer of protest songs. These songs are usually nationalistic and are celebrations of Breton culture. This is mostly a modern tradition, though some older songs of this type are known and the tradition stretches into the ancient past of Brittany. &quot;Chanteurs engagés&quot; are often also singers of more traditional material.

The first &quot;chanteur engagé&quot; to be quoted is the maverick Glenmor (1931–1996), or to give him his real name, Emile Le Scanf (or &quot;Milig Ar Scañv&quot; in Breton). He had some influence, mainly in the Breton movement and around, and on some newcomers as the best known, Gilles Servat, whose &quot;La Blanche Hermine&quot; has been a popular Breton anthem since the 1970s.

== Gallo ==

Though the Breton folk revival focused on songs in Breton, the &quot;Pays Gallo&quot; area of eastern Brittany has seen a more limited revival in repertoire in Gallo and produces singers and groups including Hamon-Martin Quintet, Ôbrée Alie, Yann Dour, while various bands, such as Tri Yann, perform a selection of Gallo songs.

<doc id="432370" wikidata="Q3495346" url="?curid=432370" title="St Olave's Grammar School">
<text>St. Olave&#x27;s Grammar School (formally St. Olave&#x27;s and St. Saviour&#x27;s Church of England Grammar School) ( or ) is a selective secondary school for boys in Orpington, Greater London, England. Founded by royal charter in 1571, the school occupied several sites in Southwark, before establishing a location on Tooley Street in 1893. It moved to the suburb of Orpington in 1968, and has admitted girls to its sixth form since 1998.

A former &quot;Sunday Times&quot; State School of the Year (2008), the school is selective at both initial entry and for entry to the sixth form, but it has been criticised for policies that led to students being excluded from the sixth form for not achieving high grades. In 2017, parents threatened legal action against the policies applied by headteacher Aydin Önaç (who subsequently resigned), and the London Borough of Bromley instituted an inquiry whose critical report was published in July 2018.

==General information==
The school is a beneficiary of the St Olave&#x27;s and St Saviour&#x27;s Schools Foundation. Its historic sister school is St Saviour&#x27;s and St Olave&#x27;s Church of England School in New Kent Road. Established in 1903, as a girls grammar school, this is now a non-selective girls&#x27; school.

Until the scheme was discontinued in 2010, St Olave&#x27;s was designated as a science, mathematics and computing specialist school. The school later applied for academy status; in 2015 this was reported to be &#x27;on hold&#x27; pending resolution of governance issues between the Diocese of Rochester, the school and the Department for Education.

Members of the school are known as Olavians, and alumni as Old Olavians. There are four houses: Bingham, Cure, Harvard and Leeke. These exist for the purposes of the classes and house competitions in the Lower School (Year 7 to 9) and for games competition in Year 10.

It was the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; State School of the Year in 2008 and in 2011 was ranked as the fourth best performing state school in the country at A-level by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

===Admissions===
====Year 7 entry====
The school has been heavily oversubscribed in the past (more than 10 applicants per place in 2008). Entry had for some years solely been determined by a pair of competitive papers in English and Mathematics; however, due to the demand for entry to the school, a two-stage entrance process existed. Verbal and Non-Verbal Reasoning (which had formed the 3rd entrance paper until the Autumn 2007 exams, for entry September 2008) formed part of Stage 1, a single multiple-choice paper which also included English and Maths. Those who passed this first paper then took Stage 2, the traditional pair of English and Maths papers. Marks for the two stages were then standardised and aggregated; the candidates with the top 124 aggregate marks were offered places in Year 7.

====Sixth form====
Competition for sixth form places is also high. Pupils are selected for the sixth form on the basis of their GCSE results, and pupils have been subsequently expelled for under-achieving. In 2017 parents claimed this practice was illegal, and petitioned for judicial review.

===Choristers===
St Olave&#x27;s exclusively provides Choristers for the Choir of the King&#x27;s Chapel of the Savoy, London, which is a Chapel Royal, the Chapel of the Royal Victorian Order and of the Duchy of Lancaster. Until the school relocated to Orpington, it used to provide the choir for Southwark Cathedral through its connection to the St Saviour&#x27;s foundation. However, the Charity Commissioners required that activities and intended beneficiaries related to Southwark had to be continued to be provided for by the Foundation, which supports the Cathedral choir today.

==History==

===St Saviour&#x27;s Grammar School===
A new lease for the parish church of St Saviour’s dated 16 June 1559 included a pledge to start a school within two years. Within a few weeks a school for boys was functioning in temporary accommodation. On 24 November 1560 the four first wardens of the school were elected, and on 4 March 1561 a lease was handed over to the wardens for a new schoolhouse: a building in the Green Dragon, formerly Cobham’s Inn. A licence/charter for St Saviour’s Grammar School was obtained in 1562.

In 1676 the building in the Green Dragon was destroyed in the Great Fire of Southwark—the City of London fire was in 1666—and a new building was built on the same site.

In 1839 the school site was required for the enlargement of the Borough Market and a third building was built in Sumner Street in 1839. It was smaller than the previous one due to a decline in numbers.

St Saviour’s Grammar School agreed to amalgamation with St Olave’s in 1896. At the same time the creation of a new school for girls was envisaged, and this came into being in 1903 and was named St Saviour’s and St Olave’s Grammar School for Girls.

===St Olave’s Grammar School===
Henry Leeke, a Southwark brewer, left a will (13 April 1560) which gave £8 a year towards the founding and maintenance of a new free school. If the parish of St Olave’s failed to create such a school within two years, St Saviour’s parish was to have the money.

In November 1560, notice to quit was given to tenants of the rooms which were to be used for the school, and in July 1561 the church wardens of St Olave’s were ordered to receive Leeke’s legacy, and &quot;prepare&quot; a schoolmaster by Michaelmas Day. Assuming that everything went to schedule, the school began teaching on Michaelmas Day 1561.

On 25 July 1571 letters patent were obtained which established the school as a grammar school. The charter stipulated that the school be called: The Free Grammar School of Queen Elizabeth of the Parishioners of the Parish of Saint Olave in the County of Surrey.

Initially the school was housed in the old Vestry Hall of the church and its adjoining premises (on the west side of Churchyard Alley, a narrow lane off the south side of Tooley Street, running parallel with Borough High Street).

In the seventeenth century St Olave&#x27;s Headmaster Robert Browne was imprisoned for non-conformism.

Although the school was untouched by the Great Fire of Southwark, major renovation and extension was undertaken in 1676 after the fire.

In 1829 the school had to move because its site was needed for the approach to the new London Bridge, which was built about west of the old bridge. A new building was built in Bermondsey Street, with the first stone being laid on 17 November 1834. However this building did not last long due to the rapid expansion of the railways, which wanted the land, and another building at Green Bank, in Back Street (later renamed Queen Elizabeth Street) was built in 1855.

This new building was soon deemed to be unsuitable due to the fact that it was designed for a system of teaching which fell out of favour, and had almost no provision for classrooms.

Another building was put up in stages on the same site, while the old building was dismantled. Work was begun in 1892 and completed in 1894. The new building was designed by Edward William Mountford, the architect of the Old Bailey, and it is this building which still stands in Queen Elizabeth Street near the approach to Tower Bridge (also completed in 1894).

===Orpington===
The Queen Elizabeth Street building was abandoned by the school in 1968, when it moved to Orpington.

During World War II the former St Saviour&#x27;s building in Sumner Street was damaged by bombing. Consequently, in 1952 the historic foundation stone was moved from Sumner Street to the Queen Elizabeth Street site. When the school was relocated to Orpington in 1968, the stone was taken to the new site.

The school was at the centre of controversy in 1996 when Labour Party Shadow Cabinet minister Harriet Harman sent her son to the school, despite her party&#x27;s opposition to grammar schools and the fact that the school was located at some considerable distance from where she lived.

===Admission procedure inquiry===
On 11 May 2016 a petition was set up by students objecting to new, harder sixth form entry requirements; it gained over 1,000 signatures in two days. Then in August 2017, parents were informed that sixteen children were no longer welcome to continue into year 13, as their year 12 results were too poor. This caused a group of parents to take the school to court for excluding the pupils unlawfully. On 1 September, the school made a statement that the excluded pupils would be allowed to return to school for Year 13. The chair of the governors resigned due to lack of time to carry out his role.

It emerged that headteacher Aydin Önaç and bursar Alan Wooley had set up a business earlier in 2016, with the knowledge of the governors, where they were registered as the sole shareholders. The company filed three applications to hold trademarks related to St Olave’s school. The governors decided the format of the business did not follow good practice.

On 19 October 2017 the new chair of governors, Paul Wright, announced that the headteacher had been suspended &quot;without prejudice&quot; while an inquiry (&quot;in respect of concerns that have been raised over recent weeks&quot;) by the Bromley London Borough Council took place. Some parents used the annual general meeting of the school&#x27;s parents&#x27; association in early November to campaign for Önaç&#x27;s reinstatement, but the following week, on 17 November, the school announced Önaç would be leaving the school in December 2017, &quot;for personal reasons&quot;. Freedom of Information requests revealed that 72 students had been forced out of the school during their A-level studies since Önaç became head in the 2010-2011 academic year.

The report of Bromley council&#x27;s independent inquiry, led by educationalist Christine Whatford, was published in July 2018, and accused St Olave&#x27;s of illegally treating its students as &quot;collateral damage&quot; in the pursuit of its own interests. It called for a root and branch makeover at the school after exposing multiple cases of maladministration, said Bromley council and the Diocese of Rochester should apologise to affected parents, and urged the school to scrap its policy of restricting access to the upper sixth form, it questioned Önaç’s claims that he did not know the exclusions were potentially illegal.

The report criticised the school&#x27;s financial management and the way in which five governors who disagreed with the head were removed, and found the head unconstitutionally interfered with the management of the PA (Parents Association). It criticised the head and bursar&#x27;s establishment of the companies to manage school trademarks.

<doc id="432373" wikidata="Q22864" url="?curid=432373" title="Apocrita">
<text>Apocrita is a suborder of insects in the order Hymenoptera. It includes wasps, bees, and ants, and consists of many families. It contains the most advanced hymenopterans and is distinguished from Symphyta by the narrow &quot;waist&quot; (petiole) formed between the first two segments of the actual abdomen; the first abdominal segment is fused to the thorax, and is called the propodeum. Therefore, it is general practice, when discussing the body of an apocritan in a technical sense, to refer to the mesosoma and metasoma (or gaster) rather than the &quot;thorax&quot; and &quot;abdomen&quot;, respectively. The evolution of a constricted waist was an important adaption for the parasitoid lifestyle of the ancestral apocritan, allowing more maneuverability of the female&#x27;s ovipositor. The ovipositor either extends freely or is retracted, and may be developed into a stinger for both defense and paralyzing prey. Larvae are legless and blind, and either feed inside a host (plant or animal) or in a nest cell provisioned by their mothers.

Apocrita has historically been split into two groups, Parasitica and Aculeata. Aculeata is a clade whose name is in standard use. &quot;Parasitica&quot; is not a clade, as it is paraphyletic: the clade would contain the Aculeata. &quot;Parasitica&quot; is therefore a rankless grouping in many present classifications, if it appears at all.
Parasitica comprises the majority of hymenopteran insects, its members living as parasitoids. Most species are small, with the ovipositor adapted for piercing. In some hosts, the parasitoids induce metamorphosis prematurely, and in others it is prolonged. There are even species that are hyperparasites, or parasitoids on other parasitoids. The Parasitica lay their eggs inside or on another insect (egg, larva or pupa) and their larvae grow and develop within or on that host. The host is nearly always killed. Many parasitic hymenopterans are used as biological control agents to control pests, such as caterpillars, true bugs and hoppers, flies, and weevils.
Aculeata is a monophyletic group that includes those species in which the female&#x27;s ovipositor is modified into a stinger to inject venom. Groups within Aculeata include the familiar ants, bees, and various types of parasitic and predatory wasps; it also includes all of the social hymenopterans.
Among the nonparasitic and nonsocial Aculeata, larvae are fed with captured prey (typically alive and paralyzed) or may be fed pollen and nectar. The social Aculeata feed their young prey (paper wasps and hornets), or pollen and nectar (bees), or perhaps seeds, fungi, or nonviable eggs (ants).

== Extant families and superfamilies ==

The Apocrita contains a large number of families. Some traditional taxa such as the Parasitica (containing many families of parasitoid wasps) have been found on molecular analysis to be paraphyletic. Parasitoidism evolved once, and it is found today across most Apocritan families, though it has been secondarily lost several times. The phylogenetic tree gives a condensed overview of the phylogeny, illustrated with major groups. The sawflies are paraphyletic as the Apocrita evolved inside that group. The tree is not fully resolved.

<text>HMAS &quot;AE1&quot; was an E-class submarine of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). She was the first submarine to serve in the RAN, and sank with all hands near what is now East New Britain, Papua New Guinea, on 14 September 1914, after less than seven months in service. Search missions attempting to locate the wreck began in 1976. The submarine was found during the 13th search mission near the Duke of York Islands in December 2017.

==Design and construction==

The E class was a version of the preceding D-class submarine enlarged to accommodate an additional pair of broadside torpedo tubes. &quot;AE1&quot; was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . She displaced on the surface and submerged. The E-class boats had a designed diving depth of , but the addition of watertight bulkheads strengthened the hull and increased the actual diving depth to . The complement consisted of 34 men: officers and ratings.

The boat had two propellers, each of which was driven by an eight-cylinder, diesel engine as well as a electric motor. This arrangement gave the E-class submarines a maximum speed of while surfaced and when submerged. They carried approximately of fuel oil, which provided a range of at while on the surface and at while submerged. &quot;AE1&quot; had four 18-inch () torpedo tubes, one each in the bow and stern, plus two on the broadside, one firing to port and the other to starboard. The boat carried one spare torpedo for each tube. No guns were fitted.

In February 1911, defence minister George Pearce announced that orders had been placed with Vickers Limited for two submarines. &quot;AE1&quot; was built at Barrow-in-Furness, England, having been laid down on 14 November 1911 and launched on 22 May 1913 and commissioned into the RAN on 28 February 1914. After commissioning, &quot;AE1&quot;, accompanied by , the other of the RAN&#x27;s first two submarines, reached Sydney from England on 24 May 1914. Officers for the submarines were Royal Navy (RN) personnel, while the ratings were a mix of sailors drawn from the RN and RAN.

==Deployment and loss==

At the outbreak of World War I, &quot;AE1&quot;, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Thomas Besant, was part of the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force sent to attack German New Guinea. Along with &quot;AE2&quot;, she took part in the operations leading to the occupation of the German territory, including the surrender of Rabaul on 13 September 1914. The submarine&#x27;s involvement was recognised in 2010, following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, with the retroactive award of the honour &quot;Rabaul 1914&quot;.

At 07:00 on 14 September, &quot;AE1&quot; departed Blanche Bay, Rabaul, to patrol off Cape Gazelle with . When she had not returned by 20:00, several ships were dispatched to search for her. No trace of the submarine was found, and she was listed as lost with all hands. The disappearance was Australia&#x27;s first major loss of World War I.

After the discovery of the submarine in December 2017, Rear Admiral Peter Briggs, retired, said the likely cause of its loss was a diving accident. He added:

, the best-supported theory for the submarine&#x27;s loss was that it went below its crush depth due to a mechanical failure. Later that year, a team of researchers headed by the National Maritime Museum director Kevin Sumption concluded their investigation into the sinking of &quot;AE1&quot;. They concluded that a ventilation valve, which was likely open to make the tropical conditions a little more bearable while the submarine was cruising on the surface near the Duke of York Islands, was insecure when the submarine dived, causing flooding of the submarine&#x27;s engine room and total loss of control of the &quot;AE1&quot;. The submarine subsequently sank below 100 metres and imploded, killing everyone on board instantly.

==Searches for wreck==
Beyond the search immediately after the submarine&#x27;s disappearance, there were no concentrated efforts to locate the wreck of &quot;AE1&quot; for the next 60 years, until the 1970s, when John Foster, a RAN officer working in Port Moresby, became interested in the story. After researching wartime records, Foster persuaded the RAN to deploy the survey ship HMAS &quot;Flinders&quot; in 1976. &quot;Flinders&quot; found one potential sonar contact, but did not have a sophisticated enough side-scan sonar to make a determination either way. During a deployment to Papua New Guinea in 1978, &quot;Flinders&quot; conducted several ad-hoc searches, again with no useful result. In 1990, while sailing between New Britain and New Ireland, Jacques Cousteau diverted his ship, &quot;Calypso&quot;, to investigate the potential contact found in 1976. His original plan was to investigate up close with a submersible, but mechanical issues prevented it, and &quot;Calypso&quot; instead performed a magnetometer search of the area, finding no wrecks.

Foster had continued archive research into &quot;AE1&quot;″s disappearance, supplemented with visits to Rabaul and nearby islands to see if references to the submarine appeared in any community&#x27;s oral histories. By 2002, he was focused on the waters off Mioko Island in the Duke of York Islands group: a priest from a Catholic mission had stated that members of the community had spotted a wrecked submarine on Wirian Reef while diving for shells. Attempts to dive the reported site of the wreck in 2002 and early 2003 were unsuccessful: the former was called off due to high shark presence, the latter expedition also was hampered by shark activity and found no wreck at the reported location. A third expedition in November 2003, supported by the Maritime Museum of Western Australia and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, conducted searches off Mioko and nearby islands, again with no success. Further oral evidence supporting the wreck of &quot;AE1&quot; being off Mioko was learned during one of the 2003 expeditions: Foster discovered that the Tolai people had a legend of a &quot;devil fish&quot; appearing offshore on the day that &quot;AE1&quot; disappeared.

In February 2007, a new effort to locate the submarine was mounted by the RAN, when the survey ships and attempted to locate the submarine off East New Britain. &quot;Benalla&quot; located an object on Wirian Reef of the appropriate dimensions using sonar on 1 March, but was unable to verify the nature of the object due to a damaged magnetometer. The minehunter was sent to investigate the object further in late 2007. Sonar and remotely-operated vehicle (ROV) imagery of the object revealed shape and dimensions similar to the submarine, but subsequent analysis by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation identified the object as a rock formation.

Foster organised another search in May 2009, partially funded by Channel Seven&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night&quot;, based on claims by a Rabaul-based salvage diver that he had seen the wreck in Simpson Harbour back in 1971, in proximity to the wreck of the Japanese merchant ship &quot;Keifuku Maru&quot;. Diver searches of the site specified by the salvager failed to find either wreck. A follow-up search later that year by the Western Australian Maritime Museum found that &quot;Keifuku Maru&quot; had been buried under of rock during the 1994 Rabaul caldera eruption, but found no evidence of &quot;AE1&quot;, buried or otherwise. John Foster died in 2010 with the search for &quot;AE1&quot; continued by others. During early 2012, the minehunter and the survey ship detected a potential wrecked submarine in Simpson Harbour. Although initially suspected to be &quot;AE1&quot;, the wreck was determined to be a World War II-era Japanese midget submarine. &quot;Resolution&quot; later conducted sonar surveys of areas in which &quot;AE1&quot; may have been lost, with no wrecks found.

Between 6 and 9 September 2014, &quot;Yarra&quot; conducted searches around the Duke of York Islands, prior to a memorial service for the centenary of the submarine&#x27;s disappearance. Although numerous sonar &quot;contacts of interest&quot; were made during the search, including one which was singled out for further investigation, all were found to be natural terrain.

In September 2015, plans for a new search were announced by Find AE1 Limited. The search off Mioko Island was carried out in November, and was conducted by a mining survey ship towing a multibeam echosounder array. At the time of the search, Find AE1 stated that if the attempt was unsuccessful, they planned to petition the Australian government to bring in the search equipment used during the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The 2015 search was ultimately unsuccessful.

Several factors have been identified as having hampered the efforts to find &quot;AE1&quot;. The volcanic nature of the region resulted in a rugged and highly variable underwater topography, with a high frequency of wreck-like acoustic anomalies. Much of the region is deep water, which limited the techniques and tools that could be used to locate and verify the wreck. Volcanic activity was also identified as a factor, due to the disruption it causes to local magnetic fields, affecting the operations of magnetometers. There were concerns that eruptions and underwater earthquakes may have caused the underwater landscape to change, or break up or bury the wreck. Additionally, the search areas contained large numbers of shipwrecks due to heavy military activity around New Guinea during World War II, along with the disposal of ships in later years.

===Discovery===
In December 2017, another search—the 13th—was conducted using the Dutch survey ship , off the Duke of York Islands. This expedition was funded by the Commonwealth Government and the Silentworld Foundation with additional assistance from the Submarine Institute of Australia and the Australian National Maritime Museum. As a result of this effort, the submarine was found at a depth of and was seen to be well preserved and in one piece. was enlisted to survey the wreckage, where it was discovered that the submarine&#x27;s ventilation shaft is approximately 60% open, indicating that the most likely explanation for &quot;AE1&quot;&#x27;s sinking is flooding with a subsequent implosion below crush depth. Further, both the stern and bow &quot;caps&quot; (outer coverings of the torpedo tubes) are at least partially open, suggesting that &quot;AE1&quot; was prepared for combat. The exact location of the wreck was not announced by the Australian government at the time of discovery, in order to protect it from &quot;unauthorised salvage attempts.&quot; The government&#x27;s stated position is that the wreck will be treated as a war grave.

==Memorials==
In 1933, a stained-glass window commemorating the losses of &quot;AE1&quot; and &quot;AE2&quot; was added to the naval chapel at Garden Island in Sydney. In September 2015, a floating sculpture to commemorate &quot;AE1&quot; was unveiled outside the Australian National Maritime Museum. The sculpture takes the form of a stainless steel wreath, in diameter, which projects patterns of light onto the water at night. In 2008 a memorial plaque was dedicated to HMAS &quot;AE1&quot; at the Tasmanian Seafarers&#x27; Memorial at Triabunna on the east coast of Tasmania, commemorating the loss of L.S. Cyril Lefroy Baker RAN, Telegraphist, the first Tasmanian killed in his country&#x27;s service in World War I.

<doc id="432375" wikidata="Q2154775" url="?curid=432375" title="Risk neutral preferences">
<text>In economics and finance, risk neutral preferences are preferences that are neither risk averse nor risk seeking. A risk neutral party&#x27;s decisions are not affected by the degree of uncertainty in a set of outcomes, so a risk neutral party is indifferent between choices with equal expected payoffs even if one choice is riskier.

==Theory of the firm==

In the context of the theory of the firm, a risk neutral firm facing risk about the market price of its product, and caring only about profit, would maximize the expected value of its profit (with respect to its choices of labor input usage, output produced, etc.). But a risk averse firm in the same environment would typically take a more cautious approach.

==Portfolio theory==

In portfolio choice, a risk neutral investor who is able to choose any combination of an array of risky assets (various companies&#x27; stocks, various companies&#x27; bonds, etc.) would invest exclusively in the asset with the highest expected yield, ignoring its risk features relative to those of other assets. In contrast, a risk averse investor would diversify among a variety of assets, taking account of their risk features, even though doing so would lower the expected return on the overall portfolio. The risk neutral investor&#x27;s portfolio would have a higher expected return, but also a greater variance of possible returns.

==The risk neutral utility function==

Choice under uncertainty is often characterized as the maximization of expected utility. Utility is often assumed to be a function of profit or final portfolio wealth, with a positive first derivative. The utility function whose expected value is maximized is concave for a risk averse agent, convex for a risk lover, and linear for a risk neutral agent. Thus in the risk neutral case, expected utility of wealth is simply equal to the expectation of a linear function of wealth, and maximizing it is equivalent to maximizing expected wealth itself.

<text>HMAS &quot;AE2&quot; (originally known as &quot;AE2&quot;) was an E-class submarine of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). One of two submarines ordered for the fledgling navy, &quot;AE2&quot; was built by Vickers Armstrong in England and was commissioned into the RAN in 1914. Together with her sister submarine, , the boat then sailed to Australia in what was, at the time, the longest voyage ever undertaken by a submarine.

After the start of World War I, &quot;AE2&quot; was sent to German New Guinea with the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force, then spent time patrolling around Fiji. With no need for submarines in the Pacific or Indian theatres, &quot;AE2&quot; was towed to the Mediterranean, and arrived off Egypt in early 1915. The boat was assigned to the Dardanelles Campaign, and was the first submarine to successfully penetrate the waterway and enter the Sea of Marmara. With orders to &quot;run amok&quot; inside Turkish territory, &quot;AE2&quot; operated for five days before mechanical faults forced her to the surface, where she was damaged by the torpedo boat . The submarine was scuttled by her crew, all of whom were captured.

&quot;AE2&quot; was the only RAN vessel lost to enemy action during World War I. The Rahmi M. Koç Museum began searching for the wreck in 1995, and found it in 1998. After another expedition in 2008, the Australian and Turkish Governments decided to leave the boat in place.

==Description==
The E class was a version of the preceding D-class submarine enlarged to accommodate an additional pair of broadside torpedo tubes. &quot;AE2&quot; was long overall, had a beam of and a draught of . She displaced on the surface and submerged. The E-class boats had a designed diving depth of , but the addition of watertight bulkheads strengthened the hull and increased the actual diving depth to . The crew consisted of 34 officers and ratings.

The boat had two propellers, each of which was driven by an eight-cylinder, diesel engine as well as a electric motor. This arrangement gave the E-class submarines a maximum speed of while surfaced and submerged. They carried approximately of fuel oil that gave them a range of at while on the surface and at while submerged.

&quot;AE2&quot; had four 18-inch torpedo tubes, one each in the bow and stern, plus two on the broadside, one firing to port and the other to starboard. The boat carried one spare torpedo for each tube. No guns were fitted.

==Construction and service==
&quot;AE2&quot; was laid down on 10 February 1912 by Vickers Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness, England, and launched on 18 June 1913. She was commissioned into the RAN at Portsmouth, England, on 28 February 1914 under the command of Lieutenant Henry H.G.D. Stoker, RN. Accompanied by her sister boat, , the other of the RAN&#x27;s first two submarines, &quot;AE2&quot; reached Sydney from England on 24 May 1914, manned by Royal Navy (RN) officers with a mixed crew of sailors drawn from the RN and RAN. The journey was, at the time, &quot;the longest submarine transit in history&quot;, and 60 of the 83 days of the voyage were spent at sea.

===Outbreak of World War I===
On the outbreak of World War I in September 1914, the two submarines were assigned to the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force as it captured German New Guinea. During the capture of New Guinea, &quot;AE1&quot; disappeared without a trace. After the German surrender, &quot;AE2&quot; spent three weeks patrolling around Fiji with the battlecruiser , then returned to Sydney on 16 November for maintenance and repairs.

As &quot;AE2&quot; was the only submarine in the region and the German threat to Australia had disappeared, Stoker suggested that the boat be transferred to Europe. Both the RAN and the British Admiralty agreed, and on 31 December, she left Albany with AIF Convoy 2 (under the tow of SS &quot;Berrima&quot;). The submarine was the only warship assigned to the sixteen-ship convoy, as after the Battle of Cocos resulted in the destruction of the last active German ship in the Indian or Pacific Oceans, the Admiralty felt no need to protect shipping in the Indian Ocean. &quot;AE2&quot; arrived in Port Said, Egypt, on 28 January 1915, and was ordered to join the British 2nd Submarine Flotilla, and proceeded to take part in patrols in support of the Dardanelles Campaign.

===Dardanelles Campaign===

On 10 March, the submarine ran aground off Mudros when returning from a patrol, as the harbour lights used to aid navigation had been switched off in &quot;AE2&quot;″s absence, which Stoker was not prepared for. The submarine was towed to Malta for repairs and returned to operation in April.

The aim of the Dardanelles Campaign was to knock Germany&#x27;s ally, the Ottoman Empire, out of the war and open up supply lines to the Russian Empire via the Black Sea. Attempts to open the Dardanelles through naval power were unsuccessful: three Allied battleships were sunk, and another three crippled, during a surface attack; although the British submarine was able to enter the strait and sink the modernised ironclad , two failed attempts to traverse the waterway and enter the Sea of Marmara resulted in the loss of and the to mines and strong currents. Plans were made to capture the Turkish defences by a land attack, with landings at Cape Helles and Anzac Cove. Despite the failures of &quot;E15&quot; and &quot;Saphir&quot;, Stoker planned his own attempt, which was approved by the Allied fleet&#x27;s commander, Vice Admiral John de Robeck.
&quot;AE2&quot;″s first attempt was made early on 24 April, but the boat only made it into the strait before the forward hydroplane coupling failed, making the submarine impossible to control underwater and forced Stoker to retreat. At 02:30 on the following day, Stoker made a second attempt. The submarine was spotted by shore artillery and fired on from about 04:30; Stoker ordered the boat to dive to avoid the shells and to traverse the first minefield. &quot;AE2&quot; spent the next hour picking her way through the mines&#x27; mooring cables: defensive wires that had been welded to the submarine in Malta prevented the mooring cables from catching. By 06:00, &quot;AE2&quot; reached Chanak, and proceeded to torpedo a Turkish gunboat believed to be a &quot;Peyk-i Şevket&quot;-class cruiser while simultaneously taking evasive actions to avoid an enemy destroyer. The submarine ran aground beneath a Turkish fort, but the fort&#x27;s guns could not be lowered enough to fire, and &quot;AE2&quot; was able to free herself within four minutes. Shortly after, the submarine&#x27;s periscope was sighted by a Turkish battleship firing over the peninsula at the Allied landing sites; this prompted the ship to stop firing and withdraw. &quot;AE2&quot; advanced toward the Sea of Marmara, and at 08:30, Stoker decided to rest the boat on the ocean bottom and wait until nightfall before continuing.

At around 21:00, &quot;AE2&quot; surfaced to recharge her batteries, and Stoker radioed his success back to the fleet; the first Allied vessel to transit the Dardanelles. Stoker had orders to &quot;generally run amok&quot;, and with no enemies in sight, he ordered the boat to enter the Sea of Marmara. Although the landing at Cape Helles was going well at the time Stoker reported in, the landing at Anzac Cove was not as successful, and the commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, Lieutenant-General Sir William Birdwood was pushing for reembarkation of his troops. Some sources identify &quot;AE2&quot; as one of the factors leading to Birdwood&#x27;s decision to commit to the attack, although the Australian War Memorial claims there &quot;is no real evidence&quot; to support this.

The submarine made appearances across the Sea of Marmara over the following five days to give the impression of multiple boats, and several attacks against Turkish ships were made, although all failed because of increasing mechanical problems. News of the submarine&#x27;s successes was spread to the soldiers ashore to improve morale. On 29 April, &quot;AE2&quot; met , one of several submarines that had entered the Dardanelles following the Australian boat&#x27;s successful attempt. The submarines arranged a rendezvous for the next morning. When &quot;AE2&quot; reached the rendezvous point on 30 April, smoke from the torpedo boat &quot;Sultanhisar&quot; was sighted, so the submarine dived and moved to investigate. At 10:30, about a mile from the torpedo boat, &quot;AE2&quot; inexplicably rose and broke the surface. While diving to evade, the boat passed below her safe diving depth; frantic attempts to correct this caused the submarine&#x27;s stern to break the surface. &quot;Sultanhisar&quot; immediately fired on the submarine, puncturing the pressure hull in three places near the engine spaces. Stoker ordered the boat&#x27;s company to evacuate, and scuttled &quot;AE2&quot; at 10:45&#x27;. All personnel survived the attack and were captured by &quot;Sultanhisar&quot;, although four died from illness while in captivity. &quot;AE2&quot;″s achievements showed others that the task was possible, and within months Turkish shipping and lines of communication were badly disrupted, with supplies and reinforcements for the Turkish defence of Gallipoli forced to take underdeveloped overland routes. &quot;AE2&quot; was the only RAN vessel to be lost as a result of enemy action during World War I, and along with sister boat &quot;AE1&quot;, the total of the RAN&#x27;s operational losses in the war.

==Search and discovery==

Since 1995, Selçuk Kolay, director of the Rahmi M. Koç Museum in Istanbul, had searched for the remains of &quot;AE2&quot;. In 1996, he discovered what he believed to be the wreck lying in of water. With the assistance of an Australian diving team, it was determined in October 1997 that the wreck was that of an old steamer. After a further thorough side-scan sonar and magnetometric survey of the reported scuttling site of the &quot;AE2&quot;, Kolay located the submarine in June 1998, lying in of water. The wreck was first dived in July, while subsequent dives by an Australian team in October were able to confirm the wreck as being &quot;AE2&quot;. The Australian government makes no claim to the shipwreck, and the submarine is not a war grave.

On 9 September 2007, Australian and Turkish naval authorities began an undersea investigation to determine if &quot;AE2&quot; could be raised and restored. Such a plan would see the submarine transferred to a viewing tank at Çanakkale. As part of the inspection, a drop camera was inserted through the submarine&#x27;s open hatch and into the control room. The survey team discovered that the wreck of &quot;AE2&quot; had suffered further damage since the 1998 inspection dives. The bow portion of the external hull casing had been destroyed and the rear of the conning tower now showed significant damage. Following an April 2008 workshop by the Turkish Institute of Nautical Archaeology and the Submarine Institute of Australia, the recommendation was made against raising the wreck. Moving the submarine to a viewing tank, or alternately relocating the wreck to shallower water, were advised against because of the AU$80–100 million cost of such projects. Moving &quot;AE2&quot; would also pose high risk to both the submarine and any vessels involved in the relocation; as well as potentially damaging the wreck, there is still an unexploded torpedo aboard. Instead, the workshop advised that the submarine be preserved through the use of sacrificial anodes to reduce corrosion, along with buoys and a surveillance system to mark the wreck and detect unauthorised access and potential damage.

In March 2010, following an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, &quot;AE2&quot; was retroactively awarded the honours &quot;Rabaul 1914&quot; and &quot;Dardanelles 1915&quot;.

An ROV exploration of the wreck by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation took place in June 2014. Several significant discoveries were made, including confirmation of the existence of a portable wireless telegraph pole and antenna wire. During the exploration, sacrificial anodes were fitted to the wreck, and the location was marked with a buoy to minimize damage by passing ships.

==Legacy==
In 2009, Edith Cowan University was commissioned by the National Archives of Australia to research and produce a computer game/simulation called &quot;AE2 Commander&quot;, funded under the $15,000 Ian Maclean Award. As well as being a realistic WWI submarine simulation, it is investigating how original archival sources can be used as part of computer simulation and serious gaming. An initial version of the &quot;AE2 Commander&quot; game and website went live on 17 April 2011. The game presents a combination of digitised documents from the collections of the National Archives of Australia and Australian War Memorial along with the embodiment of various archival sources in the setting and narrative of the game.

Commemorative bronze plaques have been installed along sites associated with &quot;AE2&quot;″s voyage from Australia to the Dardanelles. A Defence Housing estate under construction in Ermington, New South Wales, on the site of a former naval ammunition store is to be named AE2. In recent years, &quot;AE2&quot; has been referred to as the &quot;Silent ANZAC&quot;.

<text>The 2000 United States census, conducted by the Census Bureau, determined the resident population of the United States on April 1, 2000, to be 281,421,906, an increase of 13.2 percent over the 248,709,873 people enumerated during the 1990 census. This was the twenty-second federal census and was at the time the largest civilly administered peacetime effort in the United States.

Approximately 16 percent of households received a &quot;long form&quot; of the 2000 census, which contained over 100 questions. It would be the last census to include the &quot;long form&quot;, since subsequent censuses, starting with the 2010 census, would be &quot;short form&quot; only, with the more detailed questions being replaced by the new American Community Survey. Full documentation on the 2000 census, including census forms and a procedural history, is available from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series.

This was the first census in which a stateCaliforniarecorded a population of over 30 million, as well as the first in which two statesCalifornia and Texasrecorded populations of more than 20 million.

==Data availability==
Microdata from the 2000 census is freely available through the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series. Aggregate data for small areas, together with electronic boundary files, can be downloaded from the National Historical Geographic Information System.
Personally identifiable information will be available in 2072.

==Population profile==
The U.S. resident population includes the total number of people in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The Bureau also enumerated the residents of the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico; its population was 3,808,610, an 8.1% increase over the number from a decade earlier.

In an introduction to a more detailed population profile (see references below), the Census Bureau highlighted the following facts about U.S. population dynamics:
* 75% of respondents said they were White or Caucasian and no other race;
* Hispanics accounted for 12.5% of the U.S. population, up from 9% in 1990;
* 12.4% (34.5 million Americans) were of German descent;
* 12.3% were of Black or African American descent;

* Since 1993, both families and non-families have seen median household incomes rise, with &quot;households headed by a woman without a spouse present&quot; growing the fastest;
* People in married-couple families had the lowest poverty rates;
* The poor of any age were more likely than others to lack health insurance coverage;
* The number of elementary and high school students in 2000 fell just short of the all-time high of 49 million reached in 1970;
* Improvements in educational attainment cross racial and ethnic lines; and
* The majority (51%) of U.S. households had access to computers; 42% had Internet access.

==Changes in population==
Regionally, the South and West experienced the bulk of the nation&#x27;s population increase: 14,790,890 and 10,411,850, respectively. This meant that the mean center of U.S. population moved to Phelps County, Missouri. The Northeastern United States grew by 2,785,149; the Midwest by 4,724,144.

==Reapportionment==

The results of the census are used to determine how many congressional districts each state is apportioned. Congress defines the formula, in accordance with Title 2 of the U.S. Code, to reapportion among the states the 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives. The apportionment population consists of the resident population of the fifty states, plus the overseas military and federal civilian employees and their dependents living with them who could be allocated to a state. Each member of the House represents a population of about 647,000. The populations of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are excluded from the apportionment population because they do not have voting seats in the U. S. House of Representatives.

Since the first census in 1790, the decennial count has been the basis for the United States representative form of government. Article I, Section II specifies that &quot;The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative.&quot; In 1790, each member of the House represented about 34,000 residents. Since then, the House more than quadrupled in size, and in 1911 the number of representatives was fixed at 435. Today, each member represents about 20 times as many constituents.

==Adjustment controversy==

In the years leading up to the 2000 census, there was substantial controversy over whether the Bureau should adjust census figures based on a follow-up survey, called the post-enumeration survey, of a sample of blocks. (In 1999, the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 that the Constitution prohibits the use of such figures for apportionment purposes, but it may be permissible for other purposes where feasible.) The controversy was partly technical, but also partly political, since based on data from the 1990 census both parties believed that adjustment would likely have the effect, after redistricting, of slightly increasing Democratic representation in legislative bodies, but would also give Utah an additional, probably Republican, representative to Congress.

Following the census, discrepancies between the adjusted census figures and demographic estimates of population change could not be resolved in time to meet legal deadlines for the provision of redistricting data, and the Census Bureau therefore recommended that the unadjusted results be used for this purpose. This recommendation was followed by the Secretary of Commerce (the official in charge of making the determination).

==Utah controversy==
After the census was tabulated, Utah challenged the results in two different ways. Utah was extremely close to gaining a fourth congressional seat, falling 857 people short, which in turn was allocated to North Carolina. The margin was later shortened to 80 people, after the federal government discovered that it overcounted the population of North Carolina by 2,673 residents. The Census Bureau counted members of the military and other federal civilian employees serving abroad as residents of their home state but did not count other people living outside the United States. Utah claimed that people traveling abroad as religious missionaries should be counted as residents and that the failure to do so imposed a burden on Mormon religious practice. Almost half of all Mormon missionaries, more than 11,000 people, were from Utah; only 102 came from North Carolina. If this policy were changed, then Utah would have received an additional seat instead of North Carolina. On November 26, 2002, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court ruling that rejected Utah&#x27;s efforts to have Mormon missionaries counted.

The state of Utah then filed another lawsuit alleging that the statistical methods used in computing the state populations were improper and cost Utah the seat. The Bureau uses a method called imputation to assign a number of residents to addresses where residents cannot be reached after multiple efforts. While nationwide the imputation method added 0.4% to the population, the rate in Utah was 0.2%. The state challenged that the use of imputation violates the Census Act of 1957 and that it also fails the Constitution&#x27;s requirement in Article I, Section 2 that an &quot;actual enumeration&quot; be used for apportionment. This case, &quot;Utah v. Evans&quot;, made it to the Supreme Court, but Utah was again defeated.

==Gay and lesbian controversy==

The census forms did not include any questions regarding sexual orientation, making it impossible to compile data comparing heterosexual and homosexual populations. However, two questions &quot;were&quot; asked that allowed same-sex partnerships to be counted. The questionnaires asked the sex of each person in a household and they asked what the relationship was between each of the members of the household. Respondents could check &quot;Husband/wife&quot; or &quot;unmarried partner&quot; or a number of other relationships. Responses were tabulated and the Census Bureau reported that there were more than 658,000 same-sex couples heading households in the United States. However, only about 25% of gay men and 40% of lesbians are in shared-household partnerships at any one time, according to non-census surveys. For every same-sex couple tallied in the census, there could be three to six more homosexual un-partnered individuals who would not be counted as gay. The census reported that same-sex male couples numbered 336,001 and female same-sex couples numbered 329,522. Extrapolating from those figures and the surveyed partnering habits of homosexuals, as many as 4.3 million homosexual adults could have been living in the U.S. in 2000. The exact number cannot be known because the census did not count them specifically. Bisexual and transgender populations were not counted, either, because there were no questions regarding this information. Also unavailable is the number of additional same-sex couples living under the same roof as the first, though this applies to additional heterosexual couples as well. The lack of accurate numbers makes it difficult for lawmakers who are considering legislation on hate crimes or social services for gay families with children. It also makes for less accuracy when predicting the fertility of a population.

Another issue that concerned gay rights advocates involved the automatic changing of data during the tabulation process. This automatic software data compiling method, called &quot;allocation&quot;, was designed to counteract mistakes and discrepancies in returned questionnaires. Forms that were filled out by two same-sex persons who checked the &quot;Husband/wife&quot; relationship box were treated as a discrepancy. The Census Bureau explained that same-sex &quot;Husband/wife&quot; data samples were changed to &quot;unmarried partner&quot; by computer processing methods in 99% of the cases. In the remaining 1%, computer systems used one of two possibilities: a) one of the two listed sexes was changed, making the partnership appear heterosexual, or b) if the two partners were more than 15 years apart in age, they might have been reassigned into a familial parent/child relationship. The process of automatic reassignment of same-sex marriage data was initiated so that the Census Bureau would not contravene the Defense of Marriage Act passed in 1996. The Act states:
With allocation moving married same-sex couples to the unmarried partner category, social scientists lost information that could have been extracted relating to the social stability of a same-gender couple who identify themselves as married.

<text>The second USS &quot;Franklin&quot; of the United States Navy was an 8-gun brig. She was named for Founding Father Benjamin Franklin.

Built at Philadelphia in 1795, she was captured by Tripolitan corsairs in 1802, and sold to the commercial agent of the Bey of Tunis. She was purchased on 27 April 1805 by Captain James Barron at Trieste.

In June 1805 &quot;Franklin&quot; was ordered to Syracuse, Sicily, where she was placed in charge of Lieutenant Jacob Jones to accommodate officers seized from the frigate &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, and recently released from a Tripolitan prison. From July to September she served as storeship for the Mediterranean Squadron and on the 24th departed for the United States with General William Eaton, U.S. Navy Agent to the Barbary Powers, embarked.

Following an overhaul at Washington Navy Yard she voyaged to New Orleans, Louisiana with crew and supplies for that station. Again in December 1806 she carried a company of Marines and munitions for the New Orleans station. There she was turned over to the Navy Agent for disposal and on 21 March 1807 was sold.

<text>The fourth USS &quot;Franklin&quot; was a United States Navy screw frigate. The ship was launched in 1864, partially constructed from parts of the previous . Commissioned in 1867, &quot;Franklin&quot;, named after Founding Father Benjamin Franklin, served as the flagship of the European Squadron from 1867 to 1868 and from 1869 to 1871. She was decommissioned in 1871. Recommissioned in 1873, she joined the North Atlantic Squadron and served until 1877, when she was decommissioned again, then immediately recommissioned for use as a receiving ship at Norfolk, Virginia. She served in this capacity until 1915, when she was stricken and sold.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Franklin&quot; was laid down at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, in 1854, and built in part of materials salvaged from the previous , a ship-of-the-line scrapped in 1852. Prior to her launching, Woodbury Gerrish was commissioned to build a figurehead for her. For a time housed over, &quot;Franklin&quot; was launched on 17 September 1864 and commissioned on 3 June 1867 at Boston, Massachusetts.

==Service history==

On 28 June 1867, &quot;Franklin&quot; departed New York City as flagship of Admiral David Glasgow Farragut, who assumed command of the European Squadron. Relieved by the sloop-of-war , she arrived back in New York on 10 November 1868. &quot;Franklin&quot;″s second tour in the European Squadron, beginning on 28 January 1869, was as flagship for Rear Admiral William Radford. She served with the squadron until 30 September 1871 when she sailed for the United States. On 13 November 1871 she was decommissioned at Boston.

Recommissioned on 15 December 1873, &quot;Franklin&quot; operated in the North Atlantic Squadron. On 11 April 1874, she stood out to sea to join the European Squadron as flagship until 14 September 1876. On 9 January 1876, while &quot;Franklin&quot; was at Lisbon, Portugal, Ordinary Seaman Edward Maddin and Seaman John Handran jumped overboard and rescued a shipmate from drowning, for which they were later awarded the Medal of Honor. In the aftermath of the Salonika Incident in May 1876, the U.S. Ambassador, Horace Maynard, requested that &quot;Franklin&quot; steam to the Aegean Sea to protect U.S. interests and citizens. Later that year, &quot;Franklin&quot; transported the corrupt politician William M. &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed — arrested in Spain after escaping from Ludlow Street Jail in New York City — from Spain to New York City, where she arrived on 23 November 1876.

&quot;Franklin&quot; was placed out of commission at Norfolk, Virginia, on 2 March 1877 and recommissioned the same day as receiving ship for Naval Station Norfolk. On 21 October 1907 her cutter, &quot;Cutter No. 2&quot;, with a launch lashed to its starboard side, was in a collision with a barge under tow by the tow steamer &quot;Pioneer&quot; at Norfolk resulting in the capsizing of the cutter and launch. The cutter sank and one occupant of the launch drowned.

&quot;Franklin&quot; remained in service as a receiving ship at Norfolk until 14 October 1915, which marked her final decommissioning. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 26 October 1915 and sold.

==Commemoration==
Following &quot;Franklin&quot;′s decommissioning, her figurehead was donated to the U.S. Naval Home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1930. The Naval Home then passed it on in 1938 to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, where it is on display.
