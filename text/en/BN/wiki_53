<text>U.S. Route 20 or U.S. Highway 20 (US 20) is an east–west United States Numbered Highway that stretches from the Pacific Northwest east to New England. The &quot;0&quot; in its route number indicates that US 20 is a major coast-to-coast route. Spanning , it is the longest road in the United States, and, in the east, the route is roughly parallel to Interstate 90 (I-90), which is the longest Interstate Highway in the U.S. There is a discontinuity in the official designation of US 20 through Yellowstone National Park, with unnumbered roads used to traverse the park.

US 20 and US 30 break the general U.S. Route numbering rules in Oregon, since US 30 actually starts north of US 20 in Astoria, and runs parallel to the north throughout the state (the Columbia River and Interstate 84). The two run concurrently and continue in the correct positioning near Caldwell, Idaho. This is because US 20 was not a planned coast-to-coast route while US 30 was. US 20 originally ended at the eastern entrance of Yellowstone Park; it was extended in 1940.

The highway&#x27;s eastern terminus is in Boston, Massachusetts, at Kenmore Square, where it meets Massachusetts Route 2. Its western terminus is in Newport, Oregon, at an intersection with US 101, within a mile of the Pacific Ocean.

==Route description==
===Oregon===
US 20 begins at an intersection with US 101 in Newport, Oregon, and runs generally eastward towards Idaho. On the way it goes over the Central Oregon Coast Range, through several Willamette Valley cities including Corvallis and Albany, climbs the Cascade Mountains over Santiam Pass, goes through Bend, and traverses the Oregon High Desert after passing through Burns. It eventually overlaps US 26 in Vale, and the two highways continue concurrently to the Idaho border.

===Idaho===

US 20 crosses into Idaho from Oregon northwest of Parma. It runs concurrently with US 26 and joins US 95 through Parma. US 20/US 26 leaves US 95 southeast of Parma and runs to Caldwell where US 20/US 26 joins with I-84 and US 30 for a short time. These four highways parallel each other (on two roadways) to Boise where US 20/US 26 runs through downtown before joining with I-84 and US 30 again to Mountain Home, where it departs at exit 95 to head east, past Rattlesnake Station, Anderson Ranch Dam road, and cresting at Cat Creek summit at above mean sea level. It continues into and across Camas County through Fairfield to Timmerman Junction, the intersection in Blaine County with State Highway 75, the route to Sun Valley, Galena Summit, and Stanley. US 20 continues east through Picabo and Carey, joined with US 26 and US 93, to Craters of the Moon and Arco, where US 93 splits off and turns north-northwest to climb the Big Lost River valley. US 20/US 26 continues on through the Idaho National Laboratory, where the highways split just west of Atomic City; US 26 heads to Blackfoot and US 20 to Idaho Falls, where it turns north-northeast to pass near Rexburg as a freeway. US 20 then climbs through the communities of St. Anthony, Ashton, and Island Park, and crosses the Continental Divide at Targhee Pass at , entering Montana west of West Yellowstone.

===Montana===

In the state of Montana, US 20 runs for less than . It runs from the Idaho state line to West Yellowstone, Montana, the western entrance to Yellowstone National Park. US 20 is known as the Targhee Pass Highway in Montana.

While US 20 and other U.S. Routes are officially discontinuous through the park, some commercially produced maps show these highways running inside Yellowstone National Park itself along its unnumbered roads and across the Montana–Wyoming state line.

===Wyoming===

In the state of Wyoming, the eastern segment of US 20 starts at the eastern entrance to Yellowstone National Park along with the western termini of US 14 and US 16. These three routes run east to Greybull, where US 14 continues east and US 16/US 20 turns south; at Worland, US 16 turns east while US 20 continues south, passing through Wind River Canyon south of Thermopolis. US 20 joins US 26 in Shoshoni, where it turns east, and they continue all the way through Casper. From Casper, the two highways parallel I-25 and US 87 for 26 miles, until all four link up together just southeast of Glenrock. These four routes stay combined to Orin, where US 20 turns east from I-25, at the western end of US 18. US 18 and US 20 are concurrent from Orin to Lusk, where US 18 turns north and US 20 continues east into Nebraska.

===Nebraska===

Within Nebraska, US 20 is a state highway that begins on the Wyoming–Nebraska state line west of Harrison near the Niobrara River and runs to the Nebraska–Iowa state line in South Sioux City. Throughout its length the route passes through a diverse range of landscapes including bluffs and escarpments in the Northwest Panhandle, the Nebraska Sandhills in the northern part of the state, and rolling hills and plains through Randolph, Nebraska as the highway approaches the Missouri River valley south of Sioux City, Iowa. Throughout its length, US 20 is a two-lane highway with the exception of the easternmost which is four-lane divided highway, the last of which is concurrent with Interstate 129.

===Iowa===
US 20 enters Iowa at Sioux City via the Missouri River crossing with I-129 and US 75. After skirting the southeast side of Sioux City as a freeway with US 75, US 20 continues east as an expressway to Moville. From Moville through north of Early at the junction with U.S. Route 71 and Iowa Highway 471, US 20 was reconstructed from a rural two-lane highway to a four-lane road. This segment re-opened October 19, 2018 and made it so that US 20 is a continuous four-lane highway for its entire length in Iowa. It passes to the north of Sac City, where it has another interchange with the realigned U.S. Route 71, then passes to the south of Fort Dodge and Webster City before intersecting I-35 near Williams.

A new segment of freeway between US 65 south of Iowa Falls and Iowa Highway 14 opened in 2003 creating a continuous four-lane route from Moorland to Dubuque. The new segment shaved off US 20&#x27;s length in Iowa. In the Waterloo/Cedar Falls area, the segment of US 20 overlapped by the Avenue of the Saints, which is also designated as Iowa Highway 27. US 20 passes Independence, Manchester, and Dyersville before reaching Dubuque. At Dubuque, US 20 crosses into Illinois over the Julien Dubuque Bridge.

===Illinois===
In the state of Illinois, US 20 begins in East Dubuque, following southeastward along the Mississippi River, and continues into the very hilly Driftless Area of northwest Illinois through Galena and Elizabeth. The highway then transitions eastward from the Driftless Area to the Interior Plains near Stockton. The road continues as a bypass north of Freeport, and then runs as a freeway along the southern fringe of Rockford. From Rockford to Chicago, Illinois, US 20 is a mixture of four-lane expressway, four-lane limited access freeway, and winding two-lane surface road. It is signed as &quot;General U.S. Grant Highway&quot; after Ulysses S. Grant. U.S. 20 runs through the south side of Chicago as 95th Street. US 20 exits Illinois along with US 12 and US 41 as Indianapolis Boulevard south of the Chicago Skyway.

===Indiana===

In the state of Indiana, US 20 enters from the west beneath the Chicago Skyway with US 12 and US 41. US 20 passes through heavily industrialized northwestern Indiana and is the main east–west artery through Gary. It then parallels US 12 to just west of Michigan City before running due east through New Carlisle to South Bend. US 20 travels around South Bend and Elkhart on the St. Joseph Valley Parkway, a four-lane limited access freeway, then returns to surface road east of Elkhart. US 20 then passes through LaGrange and Angola, intersecting with I-69 before leaving Indiana just north of the eastern terminus of the Indiana Toll Road.

From Gary to South Bend, US 20 was built as the Dunes Relief Road. During the 1930s and 1940s the Dunes Highway, US 12, was becoming more crowded as housing lots and communities developed in the Indiana Dunes. Today, there are numerous communities along US 20 and the lakefront, including Gary, Portage, Burns Harbor, Porter, Chesterton, Pines, and Michigan City.

Most notably, the route is one of the main access roads to Indiana Dunes National Park.

===Ohio===

US 20 enters Ohio from Indiana just west of Columbia and traverses east through Pioneer and Alvordton to Fayette. It continues east through Oakshade, Assumption and becomes five-lane, non-limited access roadway into Sylvania to Toledo, and then turns south until into the Toledo suburb of Maumee. After Maumee, US 20 crosses Maumee River curving back east becoming 2 lanes through Perrysburg to Woodville, where it becomes a four-lane, non-limited access highway. It bypasses Fremont while concurrent with US 6, State Route 53, and State Route 19, and then travels through the northern edge of Clyde and the downtown area of Bellevue, where it is joined by State Route 18. From there the four-lane highway continues through Monroeville and bypasses Norwalk, then becomes a two-lane highway from there to Oberlin. Continuing east, US 20 traverses through Elyria, North Ridgeville, Westlake, Rocky River, Lakewood and Cleveland, where it goes right through Public Square. East of Cleveland US 20 follows the southern shore of Lake Erie, following Euclid Avenue from Public Square, and traverses Euclid, Wickliffe, where it intersects with I-90, Mentor, Painesville, Madison, Geneva, Ashtabula and crosses into Pennsylvania at Conneaut.

===Pennsylvania===
US 20 runs for nearly across Erie County, Pennsylvania, most of that time just south of the CSX/Amtrak railroad tracks. US 20 appears as West Ridge Road eastward from the Ohio border through Springfield, Girard, Fairview and Millcreek townships. At the intersection with Pennsylvania Route 832, just outside the Erie city limits, it becomes West 26th Street. After it reaches city center at the intersection with State Street, it becomes East 26th Street. It turns sharply northward as Broad Street at the Bayfront Connector, then turns east again as Buffalo Road through Wesleyville and Harborcreek Township. Buffalo Road turns sharply northward at the town of Harborcreek. US 20 intersects with Pennsylvania Route 955 and resumes its eastward journey. At North East Township, US 20 becomes West Main Road. Within the town limits, it becomes West Main Street until it reaches the town center at its intersection with Pennsylvania Route 89, where it becomes East Main Street. Outside the town limits it becomes East Main Road until it reaches Pennsylvania&#x27;s border with New York.

===New York===
In New York, US 20 runs roughly parallel to the New York State Thruway (I-90) throughout the state. The route runs concurrently with New York State Route 5 twice, with the second overlap extending across Western and Central New York from Avon to Auburn running along the top of the Finger Lakes crossing Canandaigua and Seneca Falls along the way. US 20 runs across the rural Cherry Valley Turnpike between Skaneateles and Albany. US 20 was also known as the Boston-Buffalo highway prior to the construction of the New York Thruway and Massachusetts Turnpike.

===Massachusetts===
In Massachusetts, US 20 runs roughly parallel to I-90 Mass Pike, intersecting it directly at exit 10 and indirectly at exit 94.

In part of Berkshire County, US 20 runs north–south as it runs concurrently with US 7. It is known as the &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder Trail&quot; as it crosses the Berkshire Hills between Lee in Berkshire County and Chester in Hampden County. From Chester to Westfield, US 20 and the Boston and Albany Railroad follow the Westfield River down to the broad valley of the Connecticut River.

In Springfield, US 20 runs concurrently with I-291 between Plainfield Street and Page Boulevard; it follows Boston Road as it leaves Springfield and travels through the town of Wilbraham, eventually becoming Main Street in Palmer.

In Shrewsbury, US 20 is called &quot;Hartford Turnpike&quot;. In Northborough, and Worcester it is called &quot;Southwest Cutoff&quot;, until it merges with the original Boston Post Road in Northborough (Southwest Cutoff and West Main Street). Southwest Cutoff was created at the turn of the century to bypass truck traffic around Shrewsbury center as well as connecting to the Boston and Worcester Turnpike.

In parts of eastern Massachusetts, US 20 follows the route of the old Boston Post Road and passes by Longfellow&#x27;s Wayside Inn, in Sudbury, the oldest continually operated Inn in America. In 1926, after engineers determined that heavy truck traffic on the Boston Post Road was damaging the foundations of the Inn, Henry Ford, then owner and proprietor, ordered the construction of the mile-and-a-half-long Route 20 bypass. Upon its completion on December 11, 1928, he sold it to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for $1 and never cashed the check. According to the Boston Herald the by-pass cost Ford $288,000, equivalent to roughly $4.7 million in 2021. The original route of US 20 is now called Wayside Inn Road.

US 20 continues from Sudbury through Wayland, Weston, Waltham, Watertown and then into Boston through Allston and Fenway–Kenmore. U.S. Route 20&#x27;s official eastern terminus is in Kenmore Square at the intersection of Commonwealth Avenue, Beacon Street, and Brookline Avenue, where the alignment becomes Massachusetts Route 2. Route 2 continues for a short distance where it terminates at Massachusetts Route 28.
==History==
 Before the U.S. Highway System, the route in New England and New York was designated as New England Interstate Route 5 (NE-5), part of the New England Interstate Route system that existed between 1922 and 1927. Around 1923, from Springfield to Pittsfield, NE-5 was known as &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, and from Boston to Albany, the &quot;Hubway&quot;. When US 20 was first commissioned, it took over the entirety of NE-5.

===Historic termini===
Until 1940, the western endpoint of US 20 was the east entrance to Yellowstone National Park.

===Historic routes===
Between Fort Dodge, Iowa, and Dubuque, Iowa, the route has been widened to four lanes, the last link of this completed in 2003. Much of the old route is a few miles north of the present route except between I-35 and Waterloo. There, the old route is farther north, going through Iowa Falls, Aplington, and the north side of Cedar Falls along what is now Iowa Highway 57.

From just west of South Bend, Indiana, to the St. Joseph – Elkhart county line, the old route of US 20 through St. Joseph County is now Business US 20. In Elkhart County, its old route is now classified as a county road and is simply called Old US 20. The St. Joseph Valley Parkway is the present route of US 20 in the South Bend – Elkhart Area.

From 1930 to 1933, US 20 followed what are now Massachusetts Route 67 and Massachusetts Route 9 from Worcester to Palmer via Shrewsbury and Northborough.

The 1953 Massachusetts Department of Public Works Master Plan would have relocated US 20 between Palmer, Massachusetts and either West Springfield, Massachusetts or Westfield, Massachusetts along the right-of-way now used by the Massachusetts Turnpike, but this was never implemented.

Until 1970–72, US 20 followed an old route through downtown Springfield—Boston Road and State Street—crossing the Connecticut River via the older Memorial Bridge (now Massachusetts Route 147). The construction of I-291 prompted a change. US 20 now crosses from West Springfield at the North End Bridge, and is co-signed with I-291 until Page Boulevard, where it heads back to Boston Road via the former route of 20A.
In 2012, the Historic US Route 20 Association was formed to identify, promote and preserve the history of the route and original alignments that were once signed &quot;Route 20&quot; from Boston to Newport.

===Historic names===
*The portion of US 20 eastward from Illinois generally follows the path of the Yellowstone Trail.
*In Massachusetts, US 20 follows the Boston Post Road in Wayland and Sudbury.
*In the state of New York, part of US 20 follows the old Cherry Valley Turnpike and is still referred to by that name in some places.
*From Buffalo westward to Cleveland, Ohio, US 20 follows the path of the Buffalo Stage Road.

*Between Fremont, Ohio and Perrysburg, Ohio, the road dates back to the late 1830s. It was known then as the Maumee and Western Reserve Road. Nicknamed &quot;Mud Pike&quot; as it cut through the Great Black Swamp, it earned a reputation as &quot;the worst road on the continent&quot; for the mudholes that would trap wagon wheels and slow draft animals. Travelers sometimes would take three days to travel . It is still signed as Maumee St. in and near Angola, IN.
*Through western Indiana, US 20 was built as the Dunes Relief Road, as it bypassed the heavily traveled Dunes Highway.
*Northwest of Chicago it is called Ulysses S. Grant Highway.
*On March 25, 2019, Idaho officially labeled their section of US 20 as the Idaho Medal of Honor Highway in honor of 48 Medal of Honor Recipients with strong Idaho attachments.
*On December 17, 2024, President Biden signed into law Senate bill S.1478, designating the entirety of US 20 as the National Medal of Honor Highway.

<doc id="436529" wikidata="Q7968929" url="?curid=436529" title="Ward (LDS Church)">
<text>A ward is a local congregation in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), with a smaller local congregation known as a branch. 

A ward is presided over by a bishop, the equivalent of a pastor in many other Christian denominations. As with all local LDS Church leadership, the bishop is considered lay clergy and as such is not paid. Two counselors serve with the bishop to help with administrative and spiritual duties of the ward and to preside in the absence of the bishop. Together, these three men constitute the &quot;bishopric&quot;. A branch is presided over by a &quot;branch president&quot; who may also have one or two counselors, depending on the size of the branch. Groups of wards are organized into stakes, while groups of branches are generally organized into districts.

==Historical origin==
The term &quot;ward&quot; originally referred to the political subdivision of some of the municipalities in the mid-western United States where members of the LDS Church resided, and in particular the political organization of Nauvoo, Illinois, in the 1840s. Bishops were assigned duties and responsibility over specific ward boundaries in these cities, and over time individual congregations were defined by these boundaries. After the Mormon Exodus to Utah, this same terminology was preserved in the establishment of communities throughout the western United States. Voting districts of several Utah communities still follow the historical boundaries of their original LDS Church congregations. Due to the religious connection of this term, traditional LDS pioneer communities generally do not use the term &quot;ward&quot; to define voting districts for political purposes.

==Wards and branches==

===Wards===
A ward typically consists of 150 to 500 church members in an area within a reasonable travel time of the meetinghouse (&quot;reasonable&quot; will vary between countries and regions). A stake, the next highest level of organization, may be created if there are at least five ward-sized branches in adjacent areas. Once the stake has been organized, the ward-sized branches are organized into wards. Beginning in 2024, the LDS Church unified standards worldwide for creation of wards as shown in table below. Prior to 2024, within the United States and Canada, a minimum of 300 members was required to create a ward; elsewhere, a minimum of 150 members was required.

If there are not sufficient congregations in an area to form a stake, a district (analogous to but smaller than a stake) is formed to oversee local congregations. There is no minimum or maximum geographical size for a ward: In areas where there are greater numbers of active church members (such as urban and suburban areas in Utah), several wards can exist in only .

When the ward membership grows to a certain size, the ward will be divided. Generally, if both geographic divisions are in a reasonable distance of the meetinghouse, they will meet at the same building, but at different times. Most meetinghouses are designed to house multiple wards. Individuals can find out what ward they reside in by either talking to a local LDS leader or by using the meetinghouse locator tool on the church&#x27;s webpage.

Unlike most religions, members are expected to attend the specific ward they reside in and are discouraged from choosing a different congregation that meets in a different place or at a more convenient time. There are some exceptions to this rule (see below), but for the most part members are discouraged from &quot;shopping&quot; for a different ward that is more convenient for them, or that they might attend with friends or relatives, or that has a more likeable leader.

====Singles wards====
Singles wards are set up in areas with high populations of single adults. Young single adult (YSA) wards are intended for single members ages 18 to 35, and single adult wards are generally for single members of ages 31 to 45. Older single adult members typically attend their family (standard) ward. These wards provide LDS singles the opportunity to serve in offices of the church. Members are taught the same principles of the gospel as a traditional ward, while receiving attention particular to their spiritual needs.

Singles wards are different in that they overlap several other regular wards geographically, even crossing stake boundaries. Single adult members may choose to attend the singles ward or their regular &quot;home&quot; ward; otherwise, the church strongly discourages the regular attendance of, and disallows the transfer of membership records to, regular wards other than the one to which the member&#x27;s residence is assigned.

Since it is a doctrinal requirement that the bishop of a ward be married, this man will typically be called from another ward in the host stake of the singles ward. Men to fill the other positions, such as counselors in the bishopric, an executive secretary, and ward clerks, may also be called from other wards in the stake or from among the members of the singles ward.

A primary goal of a singles ward is to provide its members the chance to meet other singles of the opposite sex and eventually to be married. Singles in a certain area can then more easily find other singles of similar interests and beliefs, and eventually find a spouse. Groups are often formed to allow both the young single adults and single adults to conduct activities similar to those practiced in Family Home Evening. Although these groups may exist wherever there are LDS wards, they are more prominent in LDS singles wards.

LDS singles ward culture was portrayed and parodied in the 2002 movie &quot;The Singles Ward&quot;.

====YSA wards====
In 2011, YSA wards and stakes were reorganized and realigned to remove the distinction of a student ward from a traditional YSA ward. Previously, YSA wards were organized as either college/university wards or traditional YSA wards. At colleges and universities with large LDS populations, student wards were organized to serve the needs of students in attending these schools. In areas where there are large concentrations of YSA wards, YSA stakes are formed. Previously, when one or more wards were formed for the students of a college or university, separate wards would be formed for single and married students. In such university wards and stakes, the bishops and members of the stake presidency are filled by men called from adjacent stakes.

====Language wards====
Much like a singles ward, and with administrative approval, wards may be established in geographic areas which contain a high population of church members whose native language is different from the local language (such as adjacent to U.S. military bases in foreign countries, or in metropolitan areas which have larger numbers of immigrant/second-language users). Additionally, there are also wards for deaf members where the primary language used is the locally predominant sign language (such as American Sign Language in the U.S. and anglophone Canada). Services in these wards are conducted entirely in the target language. Colloquialisms such as &quot;a Spanish ward&quot; or &quot;a Chinese ward&quot;, for example, refer solely to the language spoken, and not the race or ethnicity of the members welcome (e.g., there are no &quot;Mexican wards&quot;). However, in practice, different wards are sometimes made for different ethnic backgrounds or national origins, even though there is no difference in the language used. There used to be wards or missions that were designated based on race, such as Indian wards or Indian missions for Native Americans.

===Branch===

A congregation that is in a district or that has too small a membership to be a ward may be organized as a &quot;branch&quot; of the church. Branches may be organized in stakes, but wards may not be organized in districts. Branches in a district, or those where no stake or district exist, fall under the jurisdiction of the mission president. 

Branches may also be formed for YSA, foreign-language, military personnel, retirees, or jail/prison/half-way house inmates where there is a need for special interests, but there are too few individuals to form a ward. As in the ward, the branch president in a YSA, or prison branch will typically be called from the stake or district in which the branch is organized, or those within close geographical proximity. Because of the nature of prison branches, all positions of authority will be called from outside of the branch.

Some branches (called &quot;care center&quot; branches) are set up in nursing homes with meetings held on-site for people who cannot travel to a meetinghouse. In these branches, leaders are also called from the local stake. Most branches require at least 20 members and require four Melchizedek priesthood holders capable of serving in leadership positions. YSA branches require 50 active members in addition to the above requirement.

===Organization===
The main organizations of a ward that are overseen directly by the bishop are the Relief Society (for women), the Young Men and Young Women, the Primary (for children), and the Sunday School. In branches, these organizations are filled when there are sufficient active members to fill these positions.

Those men ordained to the priesthood are organized into quorums by priesthood office. The offices of the lesser, or Aaronic, priesthood (typically males 11 to 18 years of age) are organized and overseen by the bishop (or branch president). Usually, there are separate quorums for deacons (11 and 12 year olds), teachers (13 and 14 year olds), and priests (15 years old and older). Offices of the higher, or Melchizedek, priesthood (including elders and high priests), within individual wards and branches are advised by, and counsel with, the bishop but are overseen by the stake president. Within districts, offices of the Melchizedek Priesthood within individual branches are advised by the branch president but overseen by the district president, under the direction of the mission president. Within a branch, priesthood quorums may be formed or all priesthood holders may meet together, as numbers permit.

The priesthood is central to, and directs the church and its organizations. Prior to adjustments made in April 2018, the bishopric, ward clerk, executive secretary, elders quorum president, high priest group leader, ward Young Men president, and ward mission leader would meet regularly as the Priesthood Executive Committee.

==Ward and branch conferences==
Each ward and branch holds an annual ward or branch conference. In this meeting, ward organizational business is conducted, general and local leaders are sustained by a vote, and sermons are delivered by stake and ward leaders.

<doc id="436530" wikidata="Q7659763" url="?curid=436530" title="Sydenham, Frontenac County, Ontario">
<text>Sydenham, named after Lord Sydenham, is a community in Frontenac County, located in the municipality of South Frontenac. It is situated at the west end of Sydenham Lake and located north of Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

The former Canadian Northern Railway runs through the north end of town, which when the local section was completed, formed the first rail link between Toronto and Ottawa. The abandoned railway right of way is now part of the Trans Canada Trail.

Sydenham once held the township offices for Loughborough Township, but after the neighbouring townships amalgamated, it is now the seat for the Township of South Frontenac.

Although located in a farming community, many of the area residents work in Kingston. Sydenham has more amenities than many of the smaller surrounding towns making it a hub for the region.

==Geography==
Geologically, Sydenham straddles the boundary of the St. Lawrence Lowlands (limestone) and the Canadian Shield (granite). Frontenac Provincial Park is found just north of Sydenham in the shield rock and sits atop the Frontenac Axis, a part of the shield that extends south and eventually crosses the St. Lawrence River. Mica mining was common in the 19th century and there are many abandoned mines in the area. One area where mica mines can be found is nearby Gould Lake situated between Sydenham and Frontenac Provincial Park.

An annual canoe/kayak regatta is held on Sydenham Lake next to The Point, a popular local public beach, which was purchased by a local women&#x27;s group in the mid-late 19th century and given back to the community so that there was always a public gathering point. Sydenham Lake drains westward into Millhaven Creek (originating from Gould Lake), which empties into Lake Ontario at Millhaven.

==Culture, recreation, and economy==
The residents of Sydenham maintain a beach that is located in the east end of the town, on Sydenham Lake. Locals call it &quot;The Point&quot; because the beach and associated park is actually a man-made peninsula on the lake, created by clean landfill. In the summer of 2017, a ribbon cutting ceremony was held at The Point beach to commemorate the renovations that had recently taken place. New additions to the park included renovated washroom/change room facilities, a new climber for children, park benches, and a paved pathway leading down to the beach. All of these renovations created a new and improved accessible park for all visitors.

Those who are not employed at the local schools or who are not running a local farm, are usually employed in Kingston. The two Christian churches within Sydenham are St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church and Sydenham Holiness Church. St. Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic church in located in the nearby hamlet of Railton, and Grace United Church in the village was recently deconsecrated to become The Grace Centre for the community.

Many cottages and summer homes are located in the area, and tourism increases during the summer months. Visitor use at Gould Lake Conservation Area and Frontenac Provincial Park also increases during the summer. The increase in visitors provides revenue to Sydenham.

Trousdale&#x27;s General Store, which is Canada&#x27;s oldest, continuously open, same-family-run general store since 1836, is located in Sydenham.

==Education==
*Loughborough Public school (K-8)
*Sydenham High School (9-12)

==Notable people==
*Actor Dan Aykroyd and his wife Donna Dixon reside on the land originally settled by his great-grandfather Samuel-Cuthbert Aykroyd in the mid-19th century.
*National Hockey League players Doug Gilmour and Kirk Muller both reside outside of the village of Sydenham. Former Boston Bruins goaltender George Abbott was born in Sydenham on August 3, 1911.
*A number of musicians and artists who are well known in the area have come from, or have lived in the village of Sydenham. These include folk singing group, Night Sun, the bluegrass band &quot;The Abrams Brothers&quot;, &quot;Jason Silver&quot; and Celtic music group &quot;The Shores of Newfoundland&quot; . Visual artists &quot;Daniel Hughes&quot; and &quot;Shayne Dark&quot; also live in the Sydenham area.
*John Babcock, Canada&#x27;s last WWI veteran, was born on a farm near the village

<text>Alfred Eastlack Driscoll (October 25, 1902 – March 9, 1975) was an American Republican Party politician, who served in the New Jersey Senate (1939–1941) representing Camden County, who served as the 43rd governor of New Jersey, and as president of Warner-Lambert (now a part of Pfizer).

==Early life and education==
Driscoll was born on October 25, 1902, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He grew up in Haddonfield, New Jersey, and graduated from Haddonfield Memorial High School in 1921. He attended Williams College, where he graduated in 1925. In 1928, he was awarded an LL.B. degree from Harvard University.

==Career==
He served as Governor of New Jersey from 1947 to 1954 where he was a proponent for the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway. From the time of their construction, these two major transportation links would transform the agrarian &quot;Garden State&quot; into the most densely populated state in the union. The Driscoll Bridge on the Garden State Parkway across the Raritan River was named in his honor, and a failed planned extension of the New Jersey Turnpike, similar in nature to the Pennsylvania Turnpike&#x27;s Northeast Extension, would have also borne his name. Driscoll served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention from New Jersey in 1948 and 1952, and he was considered for the vice presidential nomination at the 1952 convention.

Driscoll, a Republican, gave William J. Brennan Jr., a Democrat, his first judicial appointment in 1949, when he appointed him to a seat on the New Jersey Superior Court. In 1951, Driscoll promoted Brennan to the Supreme Court of New Jersey, where he served until appointed to the Supreme Court of the United States by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956.

Driscoll died on March 9, 1975, at his home in Haddonfield, New Jersey. Although he was a Presbyterian, Driscoll was buried at the Haddonfield Baptist Churchyard.

<text>Montes Teneriffe is a range on the northern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It was named after Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands.

This range is located in the northern part of the Mare Imbrium, to the southwest of the crater Plato. The Montes Teneriffe lie within a diameter of 112 kilometers, although the peaks only occupy a small part of that region. The formation consists of a few scattered ridges surrounded by the lunar mare. Individual peaks rise to heights of up to 2.4 km.

To the southeast of the range is the solitary Mons Pico.

<doc id="436554" wikidata="Q968562" url="?curid=436554" title="Lamanai">
<text>Lamanai (from &quot;Lama&#x27;anayin&quot;, &quot;submerged crocodile&quot; in Yucatec Maya) is a Mesoamerican archaeological site, and was once a major city of the Maya civilization, located in the north of Belize, in Orange Walk District. The site&#x27;s name is pre-Columbian, recorded by early Spanish missionaries, and documented over a millennium earlier in Maya inscriptions as Lam&#x27;an&#x27;ain. Lamanai is renowned for its exceptionally long occupation spanning three millennia, beginning in the Early Preclassic Maya period and continuing through the Spanish and British Colonial periods, into the 20th century. Unlike most Classic-period sites in the southern Maya lowlands, Lamanai was not abandoned at the end of the 10th century AD.

==History==
Lamanai was occupied as early as the 16th century BC. The site became a prominent centre in the Pre-Classic Period, from the 4th century BC through the 1st century AD. In 625 AD, &quot;Stele 9&quot; was erected there in the Yucatec language of the Maya. Lamanai continued to be occupied up to the 17th century AD. During the Spanish conquest of Yucatán Spanish friars established two Roman Catholic churches here, but a Maya revolt drove the Spanish out. The site was subsequently incorporated by the British in British Honduras, passing with that colony&#x27;s independence to Belize.

==Site description==
The vast majority of the site remained unexcavated until the mid-1970s. Archaeological work has concentrated on the investigation and restoration of the larger structures, most notably the Mask Temple, Jaguar Temple, and High Temple. The summit of this latter structure affords a view across the surrounding jungle to a nearby lagoon, part of New River.

A significant portion of the Temple of the Jaguar Masks remains under grassy earth or is covered in dense jungle growth. Fully excavated, it would be significantly taller than the High Temple. In the jaguar temple there is a legend that you can find an ancient spear called the heart of the jaguar, even though the temple got its name from the jaguar masks on each side.

The Maya ruins of Lamanai once belonged to a sizable Maya city in the Orange Walk District of Belize. &quot;Lamanai&quot; comes from the Maya term for &quot;submerged crocodile&quot;, a nod to the toothy reptiles who live along the banks of the New River. Lamanai Belize jungle brims with exotic birds and hydrophilic iguanas. There is evidence on Maya life that dates from about 1500 B.C. through Postclassic (A.D. 950–1544) and Spanish colonial times (A.D. 1544–1700).

===Chau Hiix===
Nearby ancient Maya site of Chau Hiix presents evidence of a very long continuous occupation from Early Preclassic (ca 1200 BC) to Late Post Classic (ca 1600 AD). It lies between Lamanai and Altun Ha, another site further to the east.

It is positioned on Western Lagoon near its outlet into Spanish Creek. Chau Hiix is 15 km east of Lamanai, and is accessible by waterways travel. Altun Ha lies another 25 km further to the east. The material culture of Chau Hiix shows close ties with both Lamanai and Altun Ha, as well as evidence of interaction with centers in Petén Basin.

There are considerable ancient irrigation works at Chau Hiix, so it was probably an agricultural community supplying food for Lamanai.

Earliest cultural activity at Chau Hiix has been traced to the early Middle Preclassic Swasey phase (ca 1000-500 BC).

==Copper artifacts and their significance at Lamanai==
Among the many important aspects of Postclassic and early Spanish colonial period Maya life at Lamanai is shown by the presence of significant numbers of copper artifacts. Copper indicates broader trade relations in the southern Maya lowlands, and as a reflection of technological change, the history of metal artifact use at Lamanai is an invaluable element in the reconstruction of Postclassic and early historical dynamics. The archaeological contexts of copper objects recovered at Lamanai beginning, with the appearance of metal at the site by around A.D. 1150.

The archaeological contexts in which copper objects have been recovered at the ancient Maya site of Lamanai in northern Belize have great significance in that these objects served great purpose for the residents of the community during Postclassic time that dates from A.D. 950–1544. Nearly all of the copper objects found at Lamanai are distinctly Mesoamerican in form and design and based on metallurgical analyses it appears that manufacturing technologies were distinctly Mesoamerican as well. The presence of production materials and mis-cast pieces along with the results of chemical compositional and micro structural analysis support the idea that the 
Mayas at Lamanai were engaged in the on-site production of copper objects by late pre- Columbian times.(cite scott article). Objects are classified and examined in the contexts, forms, styles, uses, and sources of copper objects dating from the Buk ceramic phase, which coincides with the Early Postclassic period (A.D. 950–1200).

There were copper objects recovered at Lamanai beginning, with the appearance of metal at the site by around A.D. 1150. The term &quot;copper&quot; is used to describe the metal found at the site; however, all of the copper artifacts found at Lamanai were alloyed with other metals such as tin or arsenic and could technically be considered bronze (Hosler 1994: 210–213).

The number and variety of copper objects recovered at Lamanai indicate that, as a new commodity with remarkably unique aural and visual properties, metal artifacts played an important role for at least some members of Postclassic and later contact period society. Masson notes that &quot;metal was probably the most highvalued luxury good in this region of the Postclassic Maya world&quot; (2003: 279). The inclusion of copper bells, elaborate rings, and button like ornaments in Early and Middle Postclassic elite burials shows that at least some residents of the site displayed such items in certain social and ritual settings. Copper bells worn during performances acted as auditory reminders of the high social standing of those who displayed them, and the lustrous copper finger rings and elaborate clothing ornaments served as visual indicators of elevated status.

==Trade==
Trade was an essential component of Mesoamerican life in the Postclassic period and the Maya were active participants in a vast macro regional trade network. The movement of commodities as well as information and ideas into interior areas of the peninsula was facilitated by canoe travel along the coast and the extensive river systems in Belize. The importation of finished copper objects into the Maya area during Postclassic times was made possible by a vibrant, well-established exchange network that included Lamanai and a number of smaller Postclassic sites in northern Belize.

Lamanai&#x27;s key location on the New River Lagoon provided the site&#x27;s inhabitants with access to a variety of Mesoamerican trade goods throughout of the site&#x27;s 3500-year occupation. Copper objects such as bells, rings, and tweezers not only had great economic value but were also highly charged symbolic objects whose sounds and colors made them particularly important for use in ritual performances and as ornaments reflecting social status. More copper artifacts have been recovered at Lamanai than at any other site in the ancient Maya world. To date, a total of 187 copper artifacts have been excavated, including bells, rings, tweezers, various clothing ornaments, pins, axes, chisels, needles, and fish hooks.

==Burials==
Lamanai copper objects all were found associated with elite burials except for one object found in a cache and one found in a midden. Copper objects were found in six of the 97 burials excavated in these two structures.

==Copper metallurgy==
Evidence for onsite copper metallurgy at Lamanai consists of ingots, pigs, blanks, sheet pieces, mis-cast objects, and casting debris. Pigs are the product of pouring remainder metal from a cast out to cool; in contrast to ingots, pigs are usually not formed into standardized or even semi-standardized shapes or sizes.
The discussion of the forms and styles of copper artifacts from Lamanai follows Pendergast&#x27;s (1962) typology of metal artifacts in Mesoamerica. This classification is based on the division of objects into one of three major functional categories: utilitarian objects, objects of personal adornment, and ceremonial objects Dating of these metal artifacts is based primarily on their association with stylistically diagnostic ceramic forms. (Pendergast 1962: 521).

==Jaguar, Mask and High temples==
At the site are structures that date from AD 625: The Jaguar Temple, named for its boxy jaguar decoration; the Mask Temple, adorned by a 13-foot stone mask of an ancient Maya king; and the High Temple, offering visitors a panoramic view from its summit.

The most interesting features at the structure are two masks that decorate the west facade of the temple. The masks are on two levels on the south side of a central stairway, on the lower level the masks more than 15 feet high. It represents a rather humanized face and is bordered by decorative elements. The headdress of the mask represents a crocodile. These masks are construed of stone armature covered with thick stucco into which the details are carved. The masks date to the late fifth to the early sixth century. At Lamanai, ceremonialism was strongly developed, providing evidence of ruling authority with tight control over the populace.
At the large temple there was a single ball court, where an offering had been placed under its giant central marker. A lidded bowl contained 100 g of crystalline hematite, 19 g of cinnabar in a miniature vessel, and other objects such as jade, shell, and pearl, all atop of a pool of mercury. Previously mercury had been found at Copan, Quirigua, and at Kaminaljuyo and lake Amtitlan, but not in such large quantity. This large amount of mercury found at the site of Lamanai had been probably collected for ritual use. Ceramics were also found at the site and gradually adopted new styles. Unfortunately, by the end of the Classic period, the norm here for burial custom was to smash vessels prior to interment.

==Archaeological investigations==
The first detailed description of the ruins was made in 1917 by Thomas Gann. Archaeological excavations at the site began in 1974 under David M. Pendergast of the Royal Ontario Museum, which continued through 1988. Further excavations and restoration work is being conducted . The ruins are being excavated by a team from the nearby villages of Indian Church and San Carlos. The current project is co-directed by Elizabeth Graham (Institute of Archaeology, University College London) and Scott Simmons (University of North Carolina at Wilmington). Since 2006 research at the site has been directed mostly towards artifact analysis. Major excavations will resume when funding for more artifact processing, analyses and storage is acquired.

==Modern site and tourism==
Lamanai is accessible to tourists by organized day boat trips from Orange Walk Town along the New River, or by dirt and gravel road through the Mennonite area of Shipyard. A small museum exhibits local artifacts and provides a historical overview. Tourist facilities and small shops are available.

<text>Robert Mills (August 12, 1781 – March 3, 1855) was an American architect and cartographer best known for designing both the first Washington Monument in Baltimore, Maryland, as well as the better known Washington Monument in Washington, D.C. He is sometimes said to be the first native-born American to be professionally trained as an architect. Charles Bulfinch of Boston perhaps has a clearer claim to this honor.

Mills studied in Charleston, South Carolina, as a student in the lower school at the College of Charleston and of Irish architect James Hoban, and later worked with him on his commission for the White House. This became the official home of US presidents. Both Hoban and Mills were Freemasons. Mills also studied and worked with Benjamin Henry Latrobe of Philadelphia. He designed numerous buildings in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and South Carolina, where he was appointed as superintendent of public buildings. His Washington Monument in Washington, DC was not completed until 1885, 30 years after his death.

==Early life and education==

Born in Charleston, South Carolina, to Ann (Taylor) and William Mills, Robert received private education as a child and later attended the lower school of the College of Charleston. He then studied with Irish architect James Hoban.

==Career==
Mills followed his mentor Hoban to Washington, D.C. after he received a commission for design and construction of the White House in the new capital. During this time, Mills met Thomas Jefferson, who became the first full-term resident of the new presidential residence as the nation&#x27;s third president. In 1802, Mills moved to Philadelphia, where he became an associate and student of Benjamin Henry Latrobe. Philadelphia buildings designed by Mills are Washington Hall, Sansom Street Baptist Church, and the Octagon Church for the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia. He also designed the Upper Ferry Bridge covering.
In 1807, Mills designed the First Presbyterian Church in Augusta, Georgia, built between 1809 and 1812. In 1808, Mills created blueprints for a prison to be used mostly for reform of prisoners. In 1811, the prison was constructed in Mt. Holly, New Jersey. &quot;With the possible&#x27; exception of Eastern States Penitentiary in Philadelphia, it is considered &quot;the most significant prison building in the United States&quot;, according to the Historic Burlington County Prison Museum Association. Also in 1811, Mills was involved in a significant renovation and remodeling of [Old] St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Burlington, New Jersey, including the addition of a new semi-octagonal apse on the east end of the building. In 1812, Mills designed the Monumental Church in Richmond, Virginia. It was built to commemorate the deaths of 72 people in the Richmond Theatre fire.

Moving to Baltimore, Maryland, Mills designed St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, the Maryland House of Industry, the First Baptist Church of Baltimore at South Sharp and West Lombard streets in 1817, and a Greek Revival mansion at the northeast corner of West Franklin and Cathedral streets (across from the Old Baltimore Cathedral/Basilica of the Assumption of Mary). The mansion was later occupied from 1857 to 1892 by the Maryland Club, a dining and leisure society of Southern-leaning gentlemen.

Mills designed the nation&#x27;s first Washington Monument, located in Baltimore with four surrounding park squares. These were named Washington Place along the north–south axis of North Charles Street, and Mount Vernon Place along East and West Monument streets. This development took place in the new Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood.

This land had formerly been a part of Howard&#x27;s Woods, the country estate and mansion &quot;Belvedere&quot; of Col. John Eager Howard (1752–1827), north of old Baltimore Town. Howard was a Revolutionary War commander of the famed &quot;Maryland Line&quot; regiment of the Continental Army. Construction on Baltimore&#x27;s signature landmark began in 1815 and was completed in 1829.

In 1820, Mills was appointed as acting commissioner of the Board of Public Works in South Carolina. In 1823, he was the superintendent of public buildings. In the next few years, he designed numerous buildings in South Carolina, including court houses, the campus of the University of South Carolina, jails, and the Fireproof Building in Charleston. In 1825, he published the &quot;Atlas of the State of South Carolina&quot;. One year later, he published &quot;Statistics of South Carolina&quot;.

He designed the Old Horry County Courthouse, Union County Jail, and Wilson House, which have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1836, Mills won the competition for the design of the Washington Monument on the future Mall of the National Capital, Washington D.C. This is his best known work. Construction began in 1848, but was interrupted in 1854 and postponed by the outbreak of the American Civil War. Construction of the monument resumed in 1879 after the Reconstruction era. It was dedicated in 1885, thirty years after the architect&#x27;s death.

He also designed the Department of Treasury building, east of the Executive Mansion (White House), and several other federal buildings in Washington, D. C., including the U.S. Patent Office Building, patterned after the Parthenon. It has been renovated and adapted as two adjoining museums of the Smithsonian Institution: the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Portrait Gallery). He also designed the old General Post Office.

In South Carolina, Mills designed county courthouses in at least 18 counties, some of the public buildings in the capital Columbia, and a few private homes. He also designed portions of the Landsford Canal in Chester County, on the Catawba River in South Carolina.

Mills was an early advocate of fireproof construction. When a fire broke out in the Kingstree, South Carolina Building, which he designed, the county records on the first floor were protected due to his fireproofing measures. But a fire destroyed much of his Lancaster County, South Carolina Courthouse in August 2008.

==Death and legacy==

Mills died in Washington, D.C., in 1855. He was buried there at the Congressional Cemetery. In 2007, Mills was inducted into the South Carolina Business Hall of Fame.

===Architectural style===
The broadest context for Mills&#x27; architecture was neoclassical architecture. This was the dominant style of building that was winning architectural design competitions and major projects of the time, both in Europe and in the United States. Under the umbrella of neoclassicism, his designs were partly Palladian, Georgian, and often Greek Revival.

Apart from stylistic movements in architecture going on in the world, Mills was involved in the more local context of building in the Mid-Atlantic States. There, and especially in Washington D.C., many figures were contributing architecture of high quality. To build as Mills did on what is now the National Mall, he had to contend with the strictures of the plan by Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant, as well as Andrew and Joseph Ellicott. He was likely also influenced by the powerful example of Thomas Jefferson and his Jeffersonian architecture. Mills created a distinctive brand of the federal style.

<text>Dennis Ruowei Cao (), better known as One Child Policy, is a Chinese-American electronic musician, record producer, and DJ based in Los Angeles.

== Career ==
Cao was raised by two electrical engineers brought up in China, who sparked his fascination with electronic music at an early age. In 2017, Cao formed a duo, &quot;Belligerents&quot;, with Simonowsky to create the track &quot;Crack99&quot;, which was featured on LA-based party and record label The Black Lodge&#x27;s second compilation album and as XLR8R&#x27;s 3 January 2018 track download. His work was included on Arca&#x27;s Mutants Mixtapes Vol 1 and 2, which consist of tracks by Arca and artists from her Discord community.

Cao&#x27;s debut EP, &quot;Cultural Transmissions&quot;, was released in November 2017 via Droid Behavior’s sister label VRV. Mixmag praised its &quot;kinetic production [...] paired alongside a pensive aesthetic which aims to explore the artist’s Asian American heritage&quot;, rating it 8/10. It was also well received by Andrew Ryce of Resident Advisor, who called the lead single, &quot;Only Me || 孝&quot;, &quot;a track that&#x27;ll get stuck in your head along with a lot of eerie synth work.&quot;

In late 2020, he debuted his electronic record label, Dian Nao (, meaning &quot;computer&quot;), with the two-track EP &quot;It Mirrored Me&quot;, which was featured on Apple Music&#x27;s Editorial Techno Playlist, Magnetic Mag, and De Subjectivisten.

<text>Peter Gustaf Tengmalm (29 June 1754 – 27 August 1803) was a Swedish physician and naturalist.

Tengmalm was born in Stockholm and studied medicine at Uppsala University. He spent his spare time studying birds and became an accomplished taxidermist. He graduated in 1785 and moved to the town of Eskilstuna, where he worked as the provincial medical officer. In 1792 he travelled to Scotland and England, meeting other naturalists including Joseph Banks, and returning to Stockholm in the following year.

Tengmalm then became medical officer for Västmanland. He contributed papers on both medicine and ornithology to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, becoming a member in 1797. He died of dysentery, which he caught from his patients during an epidemic.

Tengmalm was interested in owls and improved upon Linnaeus&#x27; owl classification in a paper to the Academy of Sciences. Johann Friedrich Gmelin named an owl after him in 1788 (&quot;Strix tengmalmi&quot;) in the mistaken belief that Tengmalm had been the first to describe it. It has since been renamed &quot;Aegolius funereus&quot;, but the common name, Tengmalm&#x27;s owl, persists.

<doc id="436569" wikidata="Q4731144" url="?curid=436569" title="Allard K. Lowenstein">
<text>Allard Kenneth Lowenstein (January 16, 1929 – March 14, 1980) was an American Democratic politician who served as the U.S. representative for the 5th congressional district in Nassau County, New York, for one term from 1969 to 1971.

==Early life and start of career==
Lowenstein was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants Gabriel Lowenstein [Löwenstein] and Augusta Goldberg Lowenstein. Lowenstein had two older brothers, Bert and Larry. His mother died from breast cancer when he was very young, and his father remarried soon after. Lowenstein was a graduate of the Horace Mann School in New York City and of the University of North Carolina. As an undergraduate, he was president of the National Student Association and the Dialectic Society. Lowenstein received a J.D. from Yale Law School in 1954.

After law school, Lowenstein served in the U.S. Army from 1954 to 1956, then became a college professor and administrator, holding posts at Stanford University, North Carolina State University, and City College of New York.

==Political activism==

===Early public service===
In 1949 Lowenstein worked as a special assistant on the staff of Senator Frank Porter Graham and was a foreign policy assistant on Senator Hubert H. Humphrey&#x27;s staff in 1959. In the 1960s Lowenstein spent time in Mississippi as part of the Freedom Summer, and an interview of Lowenstein was featured in episode 5 of the Civil Rights Movement documentary &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot;.

===South Africa and national politics===
In 1959, Lowenstein made a clandestine tour of South-West Africa, now Namibia. While he was there, he collected testimony against the South African-controlled government (South-West Africa was a United Nations Trust Territory). After his return, he spent a year promoting his findings to various student organizations and then wrote a book, &quot;A Brutal Mandate&quot;, with an introduction by Eleanor Roosevelt, with whom he had worked in 1957 at the American Association for the United Nations.

In 1960 Lowenstein was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention.

In 1964, he attended the 1964 Republican National Convention with his close friend and Congressional colleague Donald Rumsfeld.

In 1966 he helped Senator Robert F. Kennedy in writing his famous Day of Affirmation Address, given to the National Union of South African Students at the University of Cape Town.

===&quot;Dump Johnson&quot; movement and 1968 presidential race===
Along with Curtis Gans in 1967, and later that fall joined by Wisconsin&#x27;s Midge Miller, Lowenstein started the &quot;Dump Johnson&quot; movement, approaching Senators Robert F. Kennedy and, at Kennedy&#x27;s suggestion, George McGovern about challenging President Johnson in the 1968 Democratic primaries. When Kennedy and McGovern both declined, Lowenstein, a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, recruited and worked for Eugene McCarthy, to whose candidacy he remained loyal, even after Kennedy&#x27;s late entry into the race (before Johnson bowed out). Johnson&#x27;s withdrawal from the presidential nomination process has been attributed to the impact of the &quot;Dump Johnson&quot; movement, culminating in the historical precedent of McCarthy&#x27;s strong showing against Johnson in the New Hampshire primary.

===Election to Congress===
Lowenstein was elected to Congress on Long Island, New York, in 1968 but was defeated in a modified district in 1970 by New York State Senator Norman F. Lent by 9,300 votes, effectively gerrymandered out of office by the Republican-controlled state legislature, which determined the district&#x27;s boundaries. Long Island&#x27;s generally liberal Five Towns region had been removed from the district, and the far more conservative Massapequa added. Lowenstein captured 46% of the vote in the new district.

===ADA leadership, &quot;Dump Nixon&quot; movement and Nixon Enemies List===
The 1970 election was viewed nationwide as a referendum on President Richard Nixon&#x27;s conduct of the Vietnam War. In 1971, Lowenstein became head of the Americans for Democratic Action and spearheaded the &quot;Dump Nixon&quot; movement, earning himself the number 7 spot on Nixon&#x27;s Enemies List.

===Campaigns for Congress===
In 1972, Lowenstein ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Brooklyn against Congressman John J. Rooney, a conservative Democrat supported by the party &quot;machine,&quot; in the Democratic primary. After Rooney&#x27;s victory was challenged and the election recalled due to allegations of fraud, Rooney narrowly won the rescheduled primary, but Lowenstein continued in the race on the Liberal Party line, finishing with 28% of the vote.

After an abortive 1974 U.S. Senate bid, Lowenstein unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Republican Congressman John Wydler in a largely Republican district in Long Island in 1974 and 1976, receiving crucial support and endorsements from some local conservative Republicans as well as conservative William F. Buckley, Jr.. In 1974, he was defeated by Wydler, 58-42 percent.

===Robert F. Kennedy assassination===

Lowenstein was one of the first public figures to cast doubt upon the official account of the June 6, 1968, assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Lowenstein made a one-hour appearance on the PBS television show &quot;Firing Line&quot; in 1975, where he was interviewed by William F. Buckley Jr., in which he stated that he did not believe that Sirhan Sirhan alone had shot Kennedy.

===United Nations appointment and final campaign for Congress===
President Carter appointed Lowenstein as United States Representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, and thus head of the United States delegation to the thirty-third regular annual session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1977. Lowenstein served with the rank of ambassador from August 1977 to June 1978 in the capacity of alternate United States Representative for Special Political Affairs to the United Nations.

In 1978 he resigned his U.N. post to run for Congress in Manhattan&#x27;s &quot;Silk Stocking District&quot;, narrowly losing the Democratic primary to Carter Burden, who in turn lost the general election to Republican S. William Green.

==Associations with conservatives==
Lowenstein was a close friend of conservative commentator William F. Buckley, Jr., who featured Lowenstein on numerous &quot;Firing Line&quot; programs, publicly endorsed his candidacies for U.S. Congress, and delivered a eulogy at his funeral.

Lowenstein reportedly was Republican Donald Rumsfeld&#x27;s &quot;best friend in Congress&quot; during Lowenstein&#x27;s term of office, the two having become good friends while serving as Congressional aides in the late 1950s. Despite their party and ideological differences, Rumsfeld joined Lowenstein on the victory platform upon Lowenstein&#x27;s election to Congress in 1968. In 1970, Rumsfeld publicly defended Lowenstein against his Republican opponent&#x27;s attacks, only to recant and endorse the opponent, Norman Lent, under pressure from the Nassau County (Long Island) Republican organization and Nixon White House. Rumsfeld&#x27;s public reversal contributed to Lowenstein&#x27;s reelection defeat and the end of their friendship.

Lowenstein&#x27;s subsequent campaigns for Congress from Long Island against Republican incumbent John Wydler in a largely Republican district were significantly aided by active, public support from several local conservative Republicans.

==Death==

In the early 1960s, he briefly served as dean of Stern Hall, then a men&#x27;s dormitory at Stanford University, during which time he met and befriended undergraduate students including David Harris and Dennis Sweeney.

On March 14, 1980, Lowenstein was shot in his Manhattan office by Sweeney, who was mentally ill and believed that Lowenstein was plotting against him. Sweeney then calmly waited for the police to arrive. 

Sweeney was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to full-time psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia. In 2000, a judge found that Sweeney was no longer a danger to society and granted him a conditional release.

==Family and personal life==
Lowenstein was married to Jennifer Lowenstein (née Lyman, now Littlefield) from 1966 to 1977, when they divorced, and the two had three children: Frank Graham, Thomas Kennedy, and Katharine Eleanor.

While he dated women and later married one, Lowenstein&#x27;s leading biographer asserts that he was gay, notes that toward the end of his life he became active in gay rights causes and speculates that he was on the verge of focusing on this issue and coming out, when he was killed. Lowenstein&#x27;s homosexuality was later confirmed by many friends and associates interviewed by an oral history project.

Katharine Lowenstein is a victims rights attorney and juvenile justice advocate. Thomas Lowenstein founded and directs the New Orleans Journalism Project, and has worked with the New Orleans Innocence Project. He is author of &quot;The Trials of Walter Ogrod.&quot; Frank Lowenstein is the U.S. Special Envoy for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations and Senior Advisor to the U.S. Secretary of State.

==Honors and memorials==
Hofstra University established the Allard K. Lowenstein Civil Rights Scholarship in 2007.

Yale Law School also has several programs named in honor of Lowenstein. The Allard K. Lowenstein International Human Rights Project was founded in 1981 shortly after Lowenstein&#x27;s death to honor his contributions in the field of human rights and provide law students with a vehicle to continue his work. The Lowenstein Human Rights Clinic, an outgrowth of the Project, is a clinical course in which law students participate in legal and advocacy research and writing projects for academic credit.

Lowenstein&#x27;s papers are held as a special collection of the Long Beach Public Library and offer much material relative to his activities and his times. The Long Beach, New York Public Library is also named after Lowenstein (since the 1980s).

In 1980, Lowenstein received the Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

In 1980 singer/songwriter Harry Chapin, a personal friend of Lowenstein&#x27;s, wrote his song &quot;Remember When the Music&quot; after hearing the news of Lowenstein&#x27;s death. On his posthumous live album &quot;The Bottom Line Encore Collection&quot;, Chapin dedicated the song to Lowenstein and John Lennon, who also died in 1980.

An area adjacent to the United Nations headquarters in New York City is named Allard K. Lowenstein Square.

In 1983, the documentary film &quot;Citizen: The Political Life of Allard K. Lowenstein&quot; was produced by Brogan De Paor, Mike Farrell and Julie Thompson and directed by Thompson. It was broadcast on PBS Television in 1984.

==In popular culture==

Lowenstein was portrayed by Brent Spiner in the 1984 television miniseries &quot;Robert Kennedy and His Times&quot;, based on the book by Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.

<text>Banu Hashim () is an Arab clan within the Quraysh tribe to which the Islamic prophet Muhammad Ibn Abdullah belonged, named after Muhammad&#x27;s great-grandfather Hashim ibn Abd Manaf.

Members of this clan, and especially their descendants, are also referred to as Hashimids, Hashimites, Hashemites, or Bakara and often carry the surname . These descendants, and especially those tracing their lineage to Muhammad through his daughter Fatima, hold the traditional title of  (often synonymous to ).

From the 8th century on, Hashimid descent came to be regarded as a mark of nobility, and formed the basis upon which many dynasties legitimized their rule. Some of the most famous Islamic dynasties of Hashimid descent include the Abbasids (ruled from Baghdad 750–945; held the caliphate without exercising power 945–1258 in Baghdad and 1261–1517 in Cairo), the Fatimids (ruled from Cairo and claimed the caliphate 909–1171), the &#x27;Alawi (rulers of Morocco, 1631–present), and the Hashemites (rulers of Jordan, 1921–present).

==History==
Traditionally, the tribe is named after Hashim ibn Abd Manaf. He was married to Salma bint Amr of the Banu Najjar, an Azdi clan.

Amongst pre-Islamic Arabs, people classified themselves according to their tribe, their clan, and then their house/family. There were two major tribal kinds: the Adnanites (descended from Adnan, traditional ancestor of the Arabs of northern, central and western Arabia) and the Qahtanites (originating from Qahtan, the traditional ancestor of the Arabs of southern and south eastern Arabia). Banu Hashim is one of the clans of the Quraysh tribe, and is an Adnanite tribe. It derives its name from Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, the great-grandfather of Muhammad, and along with the Banu Abd-Shams, Banu Al-Muttalib, and Banu Nawfal clans comprises the Banu Abd al-Manaf section of the Quraysh.

<text>Gordon is the debut studio album by Canadian band Barenaked Ladies. It was released through Sire Records on July 28, 1992. 

After their self-released &quot;The Yellow Tape&quot; was certified platinum in Canada, the group won a contest hosted by a local radio station. With the winnings, Barenaked Ladies were able to hire producer Michael Phillip Wojewoda and record the album at Le Studio, north of Montreal, Quebec, Chalet Recording Studios, and Reaction Studios (both in Ontario). Though most of the album was recorded without incident, difficulty with &quot;The King of Bedside Manor&quot; caused the band to record the track naked—a tradition they would continue on other albums. Horn parts, guest vocalists, and nods to other bands including Rush allowed Barenaked Ladies to expand on the sound they had developed while touring. &quot;They had a real clarity about what they wanted [the album] to be ... I just captured what it is they do&quot;, said Wojewoda.

== Background and recording ==
In 1991, after the gold certification of &quot;The Yellow Tape&quot;—an independently recorded and manufactured cassette—Barenaked Ladies won &quot;Discovery to Disc&quot;, a contest hosted by CFNY-FM, a Toronto-based rock radio station. With the prize winnings of $100,000, the band hired Michael Phillip Wojewoda to produce the album. Wojewoda felt the band had potential, specifically demonstrated with the track &quot;The Flag&quot;, &quot;there was definitely some wisdom in their young years.&quot; To get better acquainted with the band Wojewoda invited Barenaked Ladies to sing back-up vocals for &quot;California Dreamline&quot; during the recording of Rheostatics&#x27;s &quot;Whale Music&quot;. While in the studio the band met Rush drummer Neil Peart, who had influenced some of the Barenaked Ladies. The band selected 14 songs out of 20 candidates that they had written to record in the studio. &quot;[T]hey didn&#x27;t need a lot of shaping. It was ... a matter of shifting through a lot of great moments and finding the ones which fit best on the record&quot;, said Wojewoda. With the tracks selected, Wojewoda and the band drove to Le Studio. The band worked on the album for ten- to twelve-hour sessions each day, with little conflict among members. At night the band would commute to their house by skiing in the moonlight.

After some difficulty recording &quot;The King of Bedside Manor&quot;, it was suggested that the band members record the song naked. Wojewoda and engineer Jean Diamont were also required to remove their clothes; said Wojewoda, &quot;I think the recording has this totally over-the-top nervous energy as a result of being naked.&quot; Led by Jim and Andy Creeggan, the band developed horn parts for &quot;Enid&quot;, &quot;Wrap Your Arms Around Me&quot;, and &quot;Box Set&quot;. Guest musicians are used throughout the album including Lewis Melville, Chris Brown, and members of the Bourbon Tabernacle Choir. &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;re many musicians from Toronto who aren&#x27;t on &quot;Gordon&quot;&quot;, said Brown. The album was mixed in March 1992. Before the album&#x27;s release, Sire Records had to receive clearance from various parties for music that Barenaked Ladies had included on various tracks of &quot;Gordon&quot;. Having developed the songs during live performances, Barenaked Ladies integrated themes from Styx, Rush, The Housemartins, and Vince Guaraldi into various tracks.

== Artwork ==
Two covers of this album were released. The original Sire Records cover features all five band members amongst large grey letters which spell &quot;Gordon.&quot; The band&#x27;s name appears in front of a red and blue ball with a stripe on it. The Reprise Records cover features a similar ball as seen on the Sire Records cover in front of an indigo background with black stripes. The band&#x27;s name is written above the ball on this cover and the album&#x27;s title is featured below the ball. The Sire Records cover is featured on the top right of the back cover of the Reprise Records version. Both versions feature a disc stylized to look like the ball seen on both releases.

== Reception ==

Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s not easy to be hyperactive, brooding, and whimsical all at once, but the Barenaked Ladies do just that.&quot; MacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic wrote that the album approaches, but does not cross the &quot;boundaries of silliness.&quot; She went on to call the &quot;shared vocals ... refreshing and upbeat&quot;, concluding that &quot;&quot;Gordon&quot; is a great introduction to the Barenaked Ladies&#x27; sweet comic relief&quot;. &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; called the album &quot;funny and punny, more inventive than you might expect&quot;, stating that &quot;it switches directions on you just when you&#x27;re least expecting it&quot;.

&quot;Gordon&quot; sold 80,000 copies in Canada during its first 24 hours of release, topping the Canadian charts for eight consecutive weeks. In the United States, initial album sales were stronger in larger cities, however, a spike in sales was not seen until the releases of &quot;Rock Spectacle&quot; and &quot;One Week&quot;. &quot;Gordon&quot; was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in August 1998. According to Steven Page, the number of &quot;fans who know every word of every song&quot; outnumbers the number of units sold by four times. &quot;&quot;Gordon&quot; must be the most bootlegged album in [United States] history&quot;, said Page. In 2000, the album achieved diamond status in Canada, selling over one million copies.

<doc id="436574" wikidata="Q1145054" url="?curid=436574" title="The NBC Mystery Movie">
<text>The NBC Mystery Movie is an American television anthology series produced by Universal Pictures, that NBC broadcast from 1971 to 1977. Devoted to a rotating series of mystery episodes, it was sometimes split into two subsets broadcast on different nights of the week: &quot;The NBC Sunday Mystery Movie&quot; and &quot;The NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie&quot;.

&quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot; was a &quot;wheel series&quot;, or &quot;umbrella program&quot;, that rotated several programs within the same period throughout each of its seasons. In its first, 1971–72, it rotated three detective dramas that were broadcast on Wednesday nights from 8:30 to 10:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones (7:30–9:00 p.m. Central and Mountain time).

== Background ==
The origin of the &quot;wheel&quot; format was a joint programming and creative production agreement between the NBC Television Network and Universal Studios Television and Motion Pictures in 1966,
in accord with which NBC ordered a multi-year series of dramatic anthology productions from Universal that NBC would broadcast in the United States (both as originals and re-runs), with Universal retaining exclusive rights to overseas release of these productions as feature-length films, while NBC could not offer them as TV re-runs internationally.

The first series created under this agreement was &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;, a drama with three rotating stars. It was followed by &quot;The Bold Ones&quot; and &quot;Four in One&quot; (the similar &quot;The Men&quot; was produced for ABC and involved series from three studios, although one of them was Universal). While it was a long and profitable collaboration, it finally succumbed to the changes of the commercial broadcast market regarding both structure and content by the end of the decade.

By the late 1970s, the increasing popularity of situation comedies, coupled with their lower production costs and much greater scheduling flexibility and resale opportunities, surpassed that of these feature-length (90–120 minute) drama anthologies. The anthologies could not reasonably be reduced for shorter broadcast times for the re-run market. They were not designed for casual or short-term viewers, who would have little interest in the characters or the story of an individual episode. Each episode and each series were of widely varying quality, making package re-sale difficult. However, by the early 1980s, various movie episodes from the former &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; series were rebroadcast on late night&#x27;s &quot;The CBS Late Movie&quot; as a package with an earlier half-hour situation comedy series rerun. While they lasted, the best of them employed the finest actors, writers and production standards available.

== Production history ==
=== Inaugural programs ===
The three original 1971–1972 season shows of &quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot; were:
* &quot;McCloud&quot;, starring Dennis Weaver as a rural Taos, New Mexico lawman temporarily assigned to the New York City Police Department (NYPD). Inspired by the Clint Eastwood 1968 film &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Bluff&quot;, the show debuted the previous season as part of the hour-long NBC wheel show &quot;Four in One&quot;.
* &quot;Columbo&quot;, starring Peter Falk as a deceptively bumbling Los Angeles homicide detective. The series was derived from a 1968 made-for-television movie, &quot;Prescription: Murder&quot;, which starred Falk in the same role.
* &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;, starring Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James as a husband-and-wife crime-fighting duo. Hudson&#x27;s character was a hip, sophisticated San Francisco city police commissioner. Saint James later left the series and it was renamed &quot;McMillan&quot;.

The umbrella series was counted a great success in its first season and finished at number 14 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1971–1972 season. &quot;Columbo&quot; was nominated for eight Emmy Awards and won four categories. This success prompted NBC to move the series to the competitive 8:30-10:00 Sunday evening time period for the second season as &quot;The NBC Sunday Mystery Movie&quot;. In addition, a fourth show was added to the rotation, lasting two seasons (1972–1974):

*&quot;Hec Ramsey&quot;, starring Richard Boone as a gunfighter turned frontier forensic science detective in the Old West. This piece of the wheel series was produced by Jack Webb.

=== &quot;The NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie&quot; programs ===
==== Inaugural ====
NBC also launched a clone of the umbrella series, &quot;The NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie&quot;, which debuted in the original time period and featured three new programs:
*&quot;Banacek&quot;, starring George Peppard as Thomas Banacek, a free-lance Polish-American insurance investigator in Boston. Like &quot;Hec Ramsey&quot;, it lasted two seasons (1972–1974).
*&quot;Cool Million&quot;, starring James Farentino as a former CIA agent turned private investigator and security/retrieval expert whose fee per case was one million dollars.
*&quot;Madigan&quot; had Richard Widmark reprising his 1968 film role as a streetwise veteran detective of the New York City Police Department.

==== Subsequent ====
During the 1973–1974 season, the programs rotating on Sunday remained the same, while on Wednesday, &quot;Cool Million&quot; and &quot;Madigan&quot; were canceled and &quot;Banacek&quot; rotated with three new series:
*&quot;Faraday &amp; Company&quot;, starring Dan Dailey as a private detective who returns to Los Angeles after a quarter century in a South American jail.
*&quot;Tenafly&quot;, starring James McEachin as an African-American private detective.
*&quot;The Snoop Sisters&quot;, starring Helen Hayes and Mildred Natwick as two elderly sisters who routinely found mysteries which they solved.

Rescheduling to Tuesday nights as &quot;The NBC Tuesday Mystery Movie&quot; during January 1974 was not enough to help boost ratings, and the midweek series was canceled. The Sunday series continued, anchored by the popular trio of &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot;, and &quot;McMillan and Wife&quot;.

=== Later changes ===
During subsequent years, these rotated with a fourth series, which changed each year (1974–1977), including:
*&quot;Amy Prentiss&quot;, starring Jessica Walter as the fictional first female chief of detectives for the San Francisco Police Department. This series was a spinoff of &quot;Ironside&quot;.
*&quot;McCoy&quot;, starring Tony Curtis as a professional con-man/thief.
*&quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, starring Jack Klugman as a medical examiner in the L.A. County Coroner&#x27;s office.
*&quot;Lanigan&#x27;s Rabbi&quot;, about a small town police chief (Art Carney) and his best friend, a rabbi and amateur sleuth (Bruce Solomon), based on Harry Kemelman&#x27;s popular Rabbi Small mysteries.
Additionally, the two-hour pilot of another Universal mystery series, &quot;Ellery Queen: Too Many Suspects&quot;, aired in the usual Sunday timeslot of the &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; on March 23, 1975; it was promoted as an &quot;NBC Mystery Movie Special&quot;. (The resulting series began airing that September, but in a Thursday night timeslot, and not under the &quot;NBC Mystery Movie&quot; umbrella.)

Of all the wheel series, only the original three — &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot; and &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot; — survived for the entire run of the &quot;Mystery Movie&quot;. Most of the others were short-lived, and, with the exception of &quot;Hec Ramsey&quot; and &quot;Banacek&quot;, were all only on the air for one season. &quot;Quincy, M.E.&quot;, which was the next to last new &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; series to premiere, ended up outlasting the parent series itself; midway through the final &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; season, &quot;Quincy&quot; was taken out of the wheel lineup and retooled into a one-hour weekly series that ran for six more seasons, coming to an end in 1983.

Although the &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; series was cancelled at the end of the 1976–1977 season, NBC kept &quot;Columbo&quot; in production and a seventh season consisting of five films premiered on November 21, 1977. After the fifth film aired in May 1978, NBC cancelled &quot;Columbo&quot; as well.

== Presentation ==
The &quot;NBC&quot; &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; theme music was composed by Henry Mancini.

The opening credits consisted of a shadowed figure carrying a flashlight slowly walking toward the camera in a desert landscape under dramatically lit clouds, as images of the various rotating series appeared sequentially on the screen; at the end, an announcer (Hank Simms) presented the night&#x27;s main actors and series &quot;(example: &quot;tonight, starring Peter Falk as Columbo&quot;)&quot;. Some syndicated episodes of &quot;Columbo&quot; retain this opening credit sequence, though the original title caption which included &quot;NBC&quot; and (after the first season), a day of the week was instead replaced by a similar graphic, simply showing multiple colored filmstrips with &quot;MYSTERY&quot; written within the frames, scrolling upwards within a circle (in the original animation, some of these filmstrips contained the NBC logo, and they scrolled upwards at a faster pace), alternatively, the portion of the introduction featuring Columbo replaced the original NBC-branded end graphic. Some syndicated reruns of other &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; shows retained the intro, but simply faded away before the NBC-branded opening graphic could be shown.

The &quot;NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie&quot; theme was composed by Quincy Jones for its first season and had an animated open to show the lineup.

== Post-series ==

In 1989, Universal Television and ABC teamed to launch a revival of the mystery wheel, titled the ABC Monday Mystery Movie. The network brought back original &quot;Mystery Movie&quot; series &quot;Columbo&quot; to be part of the wheel, with Peter Falk returning in the title role. Two new series joined Columbo in its first year, &quot;Gideon Oliver&quot;, starring Louis Gossett Jr. as a crime solving anthropologist, and &quot;B.L. Stryker&quot;, which featured Burt Reynolds as a South Florida private investigator. It was originally meant to be on Saturdays, but moved to Mondays amidst production delays related to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike.

&quot;Columbo&quot; and &quot;B.L. Stryker&quot; continued in the wheel&#x27;s second season on Saturday (as &quot;ABC Saturday Mystery Movie&quot;) with two other series in August 1989: the new &quot;Christine Cromwell&quot;, a San Francisco based mystery starring Jaclyn Smith, and a revival of CBS&#x27; 1970s crime drama &quot;Kojak&quot;. The wheel series ran irregularly from February 1989 until August 1990. After the &quot;ABC Saturday Mystery Movie&quot; ended, ABC kept &quot;Columbo&quot; in production and Falk starred in an additional fourteen episodes before the network discontinued the series in 2003.

Universal brought &quot;McCloud&quot; back for a reunion film in 1989. The film, titled &quot;The Return of Sam McCloud&quot;, featured Dennis Weaver in the role of United States Senator Sam McCloud. However, unlike the television series, the reunion film aired on CBS.

The &quot;ABC Mystery Movie&quot; theme was composed by Mike Post.

===&quot;Friday Night Mystery&quot;===
In the fall of 1993, NBC made an attempt to revive the wheel format, this time called &quot;The NBC Friday Night Mystery&quot;. This rotation included:
* &quot;MacShayne&quot; starring Kenny Rogers as a gambler turned house detective to pay his debts.
* &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, a revival starring Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers.
* &quot;Staying Afloat&quot; starring Larry Hagman as a former millionaire who becomes a jet-setting government operative.
* &quot;The Cosby Mysteries&quot;, a telefilm starring Bill Cosby that was spun off into a weekly one-hour series for the 1994 season.
* A continuation of the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; telefilms that were already airing on NBC. When star Raymond Burr died after filming only the first of six scheduled films for the series, NBC retitled the series &quot;A Perry Mason Mystery&quot; and cast Paul Sorvino as Anthony Caruso, a close friend of Mason, to continue the series in a second film with an option for one more. Three subsequent films aired starring Hal Holbrook as “Wild Bill” McKenzie.
* &quot;Ray Alexander&quot; was a late addition starring Louis Gossett Jr. as Ray Alexander, a detective-restaurateur, with co-stars James Coburn and Ossie Davis. This series&#x27; first installment, &quot;A Taste for Justice&quot;, aired on May 13, 1994 with two more films planned. However, only one additional film, &quot;A Menu for Murder&quot; was filmed and aired the following season.

Promotional materials originally included a revival of the CBS telefilm series, &quot;Janek&quot;, which debuted in 1985 starring Richard Crenna as New York City Police Lieutenant of Detectives Frank Janek. An alleged feud between the two networks led to CBS demanding that NBC not proceed with production.

==In popular culture==

* The cast of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; would often make a recurring joke (&quot;It&#x27;s &quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot;!&quot;) whenever a character in a movie shone a flashlight. Eventually, at the beginning of the episode &quot;Teenagers from Outer Space&quot;, Joel has the robots in electrical shock therapy to try and break them of the habit.
* A 2008 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Dial &#x27;N&#x27; for Nerder&quot;, ended with a reference to the &quot;NBC Mystery Movie&quot; opening sequence, featuring Nelson Muntz as Columbo, Dr. Hibbert as Quincy, Rich Texan as McCloud and Mr. Burns and Smithers as McMillan and Wife.
* In an episode of the cartoon &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, Hank Hill refers to Hec Ramsey as an under-appreciated part of the &quot;NBC Mystery Wheel&quot;.

==U.S. television ratings==
&quot;The NBC Mystery Movie&quot; maintained high ratings finishing in the top 30 of shows for the first four seasons. The show rated as the following:

==Medicine==
* July 10 – Apothecaries Act prohibits unlicensed medical practitioners in the United Kingdom.
* Cholesterol is discovered by French chemist Michel E. Chevreul, who analyzes it in human gall stones, but its causal relationship with atherosclerosis remains unknown.

==Physics==
* Experiments by Jean Baptist Biot reveal polarimetry in the polarization of light in liquids.
* Atomic decay is discovered by Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius in gadolinite, a radioactive mineral damaged by alpha particles released in its own activity.

==Technology==
* November 3 – Sir Humphry Davy announces his discovery of the Davy lamp as a coal mining safety lamp.
* Dental floss is invented by Levi Spear Parmly.

==Awards==
* Copley Medal: David Brewster

==Births==
* January 18 – Warren De La Rue, Guernsey-born astronomical photographer (died 1889)
* January 21 – Horace Wells, American dentist, pioneer of the use of anesthesia (suicide 1848)
* July 26 – Robert Remak, Polish/Prussian embryologist (died 1865)
* August 23 – Henry Acland, English physician (died 1900)

<doc id="436580" wikidata="Q647404" url="?curid=436580" title="Toyota Supra">
<text>is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured and developed by the Toyota Motor Corporation beginning in 1978. The name &quot;&quot; is a definition from the Latin prefix, meaning &quot;above&quot;, &quot;to surpass&quot; or &quot;go beyond&quot;.

The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced since March 2019 and later went on sale in May 2019. The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was longer. Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix &quot;Celica&quot; and named the car &quot;Supra&quot;. Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica&#x27;s name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. The first, second and third generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City. The 5th generation of the Supra is assembled alongside the G29 BMW Z4 in Graz, Austria by Magna Steyr.

The Supra traces much of its roots back to the 2000GT owing to an inline-6 layout. The first three generations were offered with a direct descendant to the Crown&#x27;s and 2000GT&#x27;s M engine. Interior aspects were also similar, as was the chassis code &quot;A&quot;. Along with this name, Toyota also included its own logo for the Supra. It was derived from the original Celica logo, being blue instead of orange. This logo was used until January 1986, when the A70 Supra was introduced. The new logo was similar in size, with orange writing on a red background, but without the dragon design. That logo, in turn, was on Supras until 1991 when Toyota switched to its current oval company logo. The dragon logo was a Celica logo regardless of what colour it was. It appeared on the first two generations of the Supra because they were officially Toyota Celicas. The dragon logo was used for the Celica line until it was also discontinued.

In 1998, Toyota ceased sales of the fourth-generation Supra in the United States. Production of the fourth-generation Supra for worldwide markets ended in 2002. In January 2019, the fifth-generation Supra, which was co-developed with the G29 BMW Z4, was introduced.


== First generation (A40/A50; 1978) ==
The first generation of the Supra was based largely upon the Toyota Celica liftback, but was longer by . The doors and rear section were shared with the Celica but the front panels were elongated to accommodate the Inline-6 instead of the Celica&#x27;s 4-cylinder engine. Toyota created the Celica Supra after receiving requests from North American dealerships to offer a competitor to the very popular Datsun 280Z. The Celica XX (in Japanese) served as the basis of the Toyota CAL-1 which was introduced at the 1977 Tokyo Motor Show and the Celica XX was introduced later in 1978. The Celica XX followed a new product offering Toyota had introduced, offering personal luxury cars at their existing dealerships. The Celica XX was the top-level product alongside the Celica at Japanese dealership sales channels called &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot;. The Celica XX offered the same comforts of the Chaser hardtop coupe, Mark II hardtop coupe, and the Crown hardtop coupe.

=== Celica XX ===
The Celica XX (pronounced &quot;double X&quot;) is the Japanese market name of the first generation Celica Supra. It was available with two straight-six engines and five trim packages, beginning with the 2600G, 2600S, 2000G, 2000S and the entry-level 2000L. Six exterior body colours were offered, while cloth upholstery patterns were specific to the trim package in burgundy, brown or dark blue. Leather was offered in brown and only on the &quot;G&quot; trim package. Aluminium alloy wheels were only offered on the &quot;G&quot; trim package. Power windows with driver-side express down, cruise control, power steering, AM/FM Stereo with a separate cassette player, and rear split folding seats were all standard. A parking brake handle was now located in the centre console.

Wipers were two-speed with an intermittent wipe and a rear wiper with electric defrost was included.

In 1981, the Celica XX introduced the world&#x27;s first navigation computer.

=== 1978 ===
The Supra was offered with a 2.0 L 12-valve SOHC inline-six engine (M-EU, chassis code MA45) or the 2.6-litre 12-valve SOHC inline-six engine (4M-E, chassis code MA46). The Japanese model was also available with the smaller 2.0 L engine, so buyers choose which yearly tax they were willing to pay according to vehicle size and engine displacement regulations. Both engines were equipped with electronic fuel injection. The installation of the larger engine did obligate Japanese buyers to pay a higher annual road tax, making owning the car more expensive than the smaller Celica.

The Supra was first exported outside Japan in January 1979. The federalized model was originally equipped with a 2.6-litre 12-valve SOHC inline-6 engine.

Transmission options for the model were either a 5-speed manual (W50) or an optional 4-speed automatic transmission (A40D). Both transmissions featured an overdrive gear. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive gear whereas the automatic transmission featured an overdrive gear that would engage at speeds over . The drivetrain for the Supra retained the T series solid rear axle configuration of the Celica in the Japanese MA45 version and a larger F series (and optional Limited Slip Differential) in the MA46 and MA47. The car also came standard with 4-wheel disc brakes and featured a four-link rear suspension with coil springs, lateral track bar, and stabilizer bar. The front suspension consisted of MacPherson struts and a stabilizer bar.

The interior of the Supra had optional power windows and power locks as part of the convenience package. The convenience package also included cruise control and special door trim with door pull straps with an optional sunroof. As for standard features, in the centre console there was an extendable map light and a flip-top armrest, which provided storage. Some other features were the tilt steering wheel, deep zippered pockets on the backs of the front seats, and a tonneau cover under the liftback. The dashboard also contained a state of the art AM/FM/MPX 4-speaker stereo radio, analog clock, and tachometer as part of the instrument panel.

=== 1979 ===
The mid-1979 changes for the 1980 model year US model were mostly cosmetic. The interior received a redesigned centre console and a digital quartz clock. On the exterior were redesigned side view mirrors and 14x5 inch aluminium wheels were standard (the previous year had steel wheels with plastic wheel covers as standard and the aluminium wheels were optional). In addition, body molded mudflaps became available. On cars finished in copper metallic and white, the mudflaps were painted the body colour while the mudflaps were left black on all other colours. On the rear of the mudflaps, the word &quot;Celica&quot; was painted in white lettering.

The official Supra site also notes that there was an addition of optional leather-trimmed seating and automatic climate-control.

=== 1980 ===
In August 1980 (for the 1981 model year), the Supra received an upgrade in displacement with the 2.8-litre 5M-E engine shared with the Crown (S110). It was still a 12-valve SOHC engine, but had a power output of and of torque. The car&#x27;s automatic transmission was changed to the revised Toyota A43D and it gained a revised final drive gearing. Because of the change in engine and transmission a new chassis code of MA47 was given to the 1981 model. Performance figures for this model include a 0–60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration time of 10.24 seconds and a 1/4-mile time of 17.5 seconds at a speed of .

Also in 1980 (for the 1981 model year), a new Sports Performance Package became an option, which included sport suspension, raised white letter tyres, and front and rear spoilers. This also marked the last year that an 8-track tape player was offered in any Supra.

=== Powertrain ===

== Second generation (A60; 1981) ==
In mid-1981, Toyota completely redesigned the Celica Supra as well as the entire Celica lineup for the 1982 model year. In Japan, the Celica XX name continued, and the Celica Supra name continued internationally. Still based on the Celica platform, there were several key differences, most notably the design of the front end and fully retractable pop-up headlights. Other differences were the inline-six rather than four-cylinder engine, as well as an increase in length and wheelbase to accommodate the larger engine. In the home market, cars fitted with the 5M engine were slightly wider, while the 2-litre models remained compliant with the Japanese width regulations, staying under . The front suspension used Macpherson struts while the rear used a semi-trailing link design with an attachment at the rear differential.

In 1981, Japanese buyers were offered an alternative to the Celica XX liftback bodystyle, called the Soarer coupé, which was now offered at two Japanese Toyota dealership networks called &quot;Toyota Store&quot;, and &quot;Toyopet Store&quot;, as the Celica XX was sold at the &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot;. The four-door performance saloon called the Celica Camry was realigned with the Japanese market Carina, and the Chaser performance sedan shared the Celica XX straight six, while in North America the Cressida took on that role.

=== L-type and P-type ===
In the North American market, the Celica Supra was available in two distinct models. There was the &quot;Performance Type&quot; (P-type) and the &quot;Luxury Type&quot; (L-type). While being mechanically identical, they were differentiated by the available options; tyre size, wheel size, and body trim. The P-type had fibreglass fender flares over the wheel wells, while the L-type did not. The P-type was also standard with the more sporty eight-way adjustable seats. The P-type did not get the option of a leather interior until 1983. Initially, the Luxury type meant Automatic transmission, and Performance Type stood for Manual. All editions of the P-type had the same 14x7-inch aluminium alloy wheels and throughout the years the L-type had 14x5.5-inch wheels until 1985 when they were changed to a P-type styled 15x6. The L-type also had the option of a digital instrument cluster with a trip computer; some Canadian models (both L-types and P-types) had this option as well as a few rare instances of American models. The L-type cluster was easily distinguished from the P-type cluster, by the &#x27;ECT&#x27; function written on the dial plate. The digital cluster featured a digital tachometer, digital speedometer, and electronic fuel level and coolant level gauges. The trip computer could calculate and display various things such as fuel economy in miles-per-gallon, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and distance remaining to destination. Supras with trip computers also came with cruise control. Excluding the 1982 model, all P-types were available with headlight washers as an option, but the L-types were never given such an option. Although gear ratios changed throughout the years, all P-types came standard with a limited-slip differential.

=== 1981 ===
In 1981, for the 1982 model year, in the North American market, the Celica Supra&#x27;s engine was the 2.8-litre 12-valve (two valves per cylinder) DOHC 5M-GE. Power output was SAE net and of torque. The engine used an 8.8:1 compression ratio to achieve the power and featured a vacuum advanced distributor. When the car debuted, it had a , a acceleration time of 9.8 seconds and a time of 17.2-seconds at .

The standard transmission for this year was the W58 5-speed manual with the A43DL 4-speed automatic transmission being an option for L-types. Both transmissions featured an overdrive gear and the automatic featured a locking torque converter. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive whereas the automatic transmission featured an overdrive gear that would engage at speeds over . The 1982 model&#x27;s rear differential featured a 3.72:1 ratio. The Celica Supra&#x27;s four-wheel independent suspension was specially tuned and designed by Lotus and featured variable assisted power rack-and-pinion steering and MacPherson struts up front. At the rear, it had semi-trailing arm suspension with coil springs and a stabilizer bar. Braking on the Celica Supra was handled by four-wheel disc brakes.

On the interior, this generation had standard power windows, power door locks, and power mirrors as well as a tilt steering wheel. The power door lock was located in the centre console next to the power mirror control. The analog dash of this model only showed a top speed of in North America. The optional automatic climate control was renovated and was now seen as a standard feature on the A60. Cruise control and a retractable map light was standard in this generation. Some options included the addition of a sunroof, two-tone paint schemes, and a five-speaker AM/FM/MPX tuner with a cassette player (Fujitsu Ten Limited). The optional cassette stereo had a 105-watt power amplifier and a seven-band graphic equalizer. The standard stereo was a five-channel AM/FM/MPX tuner. Leather interior was an option on the L-type model, but the P-type models limited to standard striped cloth interior.

The AM/FM antenna was integrated into the front windshield rather than a typical external mast antenna. There was a key lock on the gas tank door (in lieu of a remote release) and the hatch and rear bumper were black regardless of exterior colour on the rest of the car. The P-type was available with an optional rear window visor above the hatch glass. The tail lights had a reverse light in the centre and the door handles opened the doors by pulling sideways. The front nose badge and B-pillar only read &quot;Supra&quot; for the first several months of production, but were changed to read &quot;Celica Supra&quot; midway through the model year. The L-type had front and rear mudflaps but P-type of this year did not.

=== 1982 ===
In 1982, for the 1983 model year, there were not many changes but there was an increase in power output to and of torque from the same &quot;5M-GE&quot; engine. The only real change in the engine area was the switch from a vacuum advanced to an electronic advanced distributor, yet that did not increase the power output. Toyota switched to a 4.10:1 rear gear ratio for the P-type and a 3.73:1 for the L-type. As for the optional automatic transmission, they replaced the A43DL 4-speed with a newly designed A43DE 4-speed. It had an electronic controller that would adjust its shift pattern for a balance between performance and economy. It was the first in the industry to provide an electronically controlled transmission (ECT). This allowed the driver to choose either the &quot;power&quot; driving mode or &quot;normal&quot; driving mode at the touch of the button. The power mode provided the quickest acceleration and the normal mode provided the best all-around performance.

The interior virtually had no changes, but changes to the exterior included a switch to a power mast antenna, mudflaps on all models, and the addition of headlight washers on the P-type. All B-pillar and nose badges for cars sold in North America read &quot;Celica Supra&quot; and only the P-type was available in two-tone colour schemes.

=== 1983 ===
In 1983, for the 1984 model year, the changes were significant. Power output was increased on the 5-speed models to and of torque. The increase was achieved by a mixture of a redesigned intake manifold with D-shaped intake runners and an increase in compression ratio to: 9.2:1. Another notable change in the 5-speed models was the switch to a 4.30:1 gear ratio in the rear differential. All automatic models retained the previous years power statistics, but the rear gear ratio was changed to 4.10:1.

The most notable exterior changes included the switch to wraparound front turn signals, the option of either a rear wing spoiler mounted high up on the rear hatch, or rear window and quarter window louvers. Also, the tail-lights were redesigned and the hatch received a billboard &quot;Supra&quot; sticker instead of the smaller sticker, which was previously positioned on the right. The rear hatch and bumper was changed and received the same colour as the rest of the car (instead of the black of previous years). The door handles were also switched, opening by pulling up instead of sideways. Two-tone paint schemes also became available on both the P-type and L-type models.

Some interior controls such as the steering wheel, cruise control, and door lock switch were redesigned. Toyota included a speedometer in North American models instead of the traditional 85 mph (140 km/h) speedometer and the automatic climate control display was also changed. The previous year&#x27;s cassette and equalizer stereo option was now made a standard feature.

=== 1985–1986 ===
The Supra was redesigned again in 1985. Power output was marginally increased to and torque was up to . All models of this year had the same amount of power (both automatic models and 5-speed models). The engine received a redesigned throttle position sensor (TPS) as well as a new EGR system and knock sensor. With the slight increase in power the Supra was able to propel itself from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 8.4 seconds and netted a 16.1 second quarter-mile at .

Other changes would be a redesigned, more integrated sunshade and spoiler on the rear hatch. The rear spoiler was changed from a one-piece to a two-piece. The option of a leather interior remained exclusive now for the P-Type. Toyota added a standard factory theft deterrent system and the outside mirrors were equipped with a defogger that activated with the rear defroster. All Supras this year received automatic-off lights that also encompassed an automatic illuminated entry and fade-out system.

While 1985 was to be the last year of production of the second generation model, delays in production of the third generation model led to a surplus of second generation models. During the first half of 1986 the 1985 P-type was still offered for sale, with only minor cosmetic changes as well as the addition of a now mandatory rear-mounted third brake light on the hatch. These were all labelled officially as 1986 models. The P-type were the only model available for the 1986 model year. Production for the A60 Supra ended in December 1985 in order to make way for the upcoming A70 Supra.

=== Markets ===

The second generation of the Supra came in a variety of options around the world as well as only being offered during select years.

==== Japan ====
From August 1982 to 1983, the Celica XX, as it was named in Japan, had fender mirrors and came in four models depending on the engine:

* 2800GT Twin Cam: DOHC &quot;5M-GEU&quot; and of torque.
* 2000GT Twin Cam 24: DOHC &quot;1G-GEU&quot; and of torque.
* 2000 Turbo: SOHC turbocharged &quot;M-TEU&quot; and of torque.
* 2000: SOHC &quot;1G-EU&quot; and of torque.

From August 1983 to 1986, the Celica XX had door-mounted mirrors and the same four engines options but with performance improvements. The 5M-GEU engine compression ratio was increased to achieve and of torque and the M-TEU engine upgraded with an air-to-liquid intercooler to and of torque.

==== Most of Europe ====
* Sold from August 1982 to 1986.
** 82–83: DOHC &quot;5M-GE&quot; and of torque. Analog instrument cluster, no fender flares.
** 84–86: DOHC &quot;5M-GE&quot; and of torque. Digital dash, P-Type fender flares.

==== Great Britain ====
* Sold from 1982 to 1986.
** 82–83: DOHC &quot;5M-GE&quot; and of torque. Analog dash, no fender flares.
** 84–86: DOHC &quot;5M-GE&quot; and of torque. Digital dash, P-Type fender flares.

==== Australia, Sweden, and Switzerland ====
* Sold from 1984 to 1986 - these had a version of the earlier single-cam engine as it was not worth the expense of making the twin cam engine meet the particular emissions regulations shared by these three countries. This particular engine was also used in the Cressida and the Crown in the Swiss market.
** SOHC &quot;5M-E&quot; and of torque.
** The Supra in Australia was sold from 1983 to 1986 had a digital instrument cluster, fender flares, 14x7-inch wheels, 84 style lights, single piece spoiler, LSD and optional sunroof. This was the only variant and no L Type model was offered.
* In Australia, the Supra (manufactured between 1982 and 1990), was assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings in 2006 as providing &quot;worse than average&quot; protection for its occupants in the event of a crash.

==== New Zealand ====
* Sold from 1984 to 1985
** DOHC &quot;5M-GE&quot; and of torque. Digital dash, P-Type fender flares.

== Third generation (A70; 1986) ==


In February 1986, the bonds between the Celica and the Supra were cut; they were now two completely different models. The Celica changed to a front-wheel drive layout, using the Toyota &quot;T&quot; platform associated with the Corona, while the Supra kept its rear-wheel-drive layout. The engine was updated to a more powerful inline-six engine rated at . Although initially only available with naturally aspirated engines, a turbocharged version was added in the 1987 model year. The Supra continued its relationship with the Soarer.

All Japanese market models with the various versions of the 2.0 L engine were slightly narrower overall so as to be in compliance with Japanese Government dimension regulations so that Japanese buyers weren&#x27;t liable for yearly taxes for driving a larger car.

The new engine used in the A70 Supra, the Toyota 7M-GE, was the flagship engine of Toyota&#x27;s arsenal. Both versions of the engine contained 4 valves per cylinder and dual overhead cams. The turbocharged 7M-GTE engine was Toyota&#x27;s first distributor-less engine offered in the US which used coil packs sitting on the cam covers and a cam position sensor driven by the exhaust camshaft. It was equipped with a CT26 turbocharger and was rated at at 5,600 rpm while the naturally aspirated 7M-GE engine was rated at at 6,000 rpm. Further refinement on the turbo model increased power to at 5,600 rpm and of torque at 3,200 rpm in 1989. This was mostly due to a redesign of the wastegate. All models used the same tyre size of 225/50R16 on 16x7 inch wheels. Spare tyres were full-sized but on steel wheels.

The naturally aspirated model came standard with the W58 manual transmission. The turbocharged models included the R154 manual transmission. Both were available with the optional 4-speed A340E automatic transmission.

The third-generation Supra represented an arsenal of new technology. In 1986, options available for the Supra included a 3-channel ABS and TEMS which gave the driver two settings which affected the damper rates; a third was automatically activated at wide open throttle, hard braking, and high speed maneuvering.

ACIS (Acoustic Control Induction System), a method of controlling air compression pulses inside the intake piping to increase power, was also a part of the 7M-GE&#x27;s technological arsenal. All models were fitted with double wishbone suspension front and rear. A targa top was offered in all model years along with a metal power sliding sunroof (added in 1991).

Production numbers of the GA70/MA70/JZA70 Supra was estimated at 241,471 units.

=== 1986 1/2 ===
The third-generation Supra was introduced in February 1986 as a stand-alone model, officially being separate from the Celica. Whereas the Celica became a front-wheel-drive sport coupe, the Supra retained its image as a rear-wheel-drive sports/GT car. The new Supra would continue to move upscale and become a showcase for Toyota&#x27;s technology. The Supra was powered by a 3.0-litre DOHC inline six-cylinder engine rated at . Notable features included an electronically-controlled independent suspension (called the Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension – TEMS), and some came with a removable Sport-Roof panel (Targa top).

=== 1987 ===
The A70 Supra Turbo was introduced in 1987. The intercooled, turbocharged version of the 3.0-litre inline 6-cylinder engine boosted power to and of torque. The engine, designated as 7M-GTE, was one of the first distributor-less mass production engines in the United States. This was accomplished with 3 coils being shared using the wasted spark system. The Turbo model also included an engine oil cooler and an integrated rear spoiler. The sports package, which was standard on the Turbo and optional on the base model, included a limited-slip differential (LSD), TEMS, and headlamp washers. A new 4-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) was optional on both models. In 1987, a new beige/tan colour combination was implemented, and only 1,000 cars were produced with this scheme. Toyota installed its variable induction technology into the DOHC twin-turbocharged 1G-GTE engine called T-VIS and also included it into the 7M-GTE engine as well.

=== 1988 ===
Changes for the 1988 model year were nominal with the exception of the discontinuation of two-toned brown exterior paint. The spoiler-mounted brake light changed from a square to a trapezoid shape. Seat pattern was changed from squares to lines, and &quot;foil&quot; on climate control and switch gear changed from light to dark gray. Japanese buyers could select from six different trim packages starting with the top level 3.0 GT Turbo Limited with the 7M-GTEU engine, followed by the 3.0 GT Turbo, GT Twin Turbo with the 1G-GTEU DOHC 2.0 L engine, the GT with the 2.0 L DOHC 1G-GEU engine, the G with the 1G-EU engine and the S with the 1G-EU engine as the base model. All Japanese models came with either a 5-speed manual transmission or the 4-speed automatic transmission with ECT-s except the G and the S on which the ECT-s wasn&#x27;t available. In Japan, the 3.0 GT Turbo Limited, the 3.0 GT Turbo and the GT Twin Turbo were installed standard with a digital instrument panel, the 3.0 L models came with an AM/FM Cassette stereo with an integrated CD player and cruise control. Climate control was also standard on all turbocharged models, and leather interior was only available on the GT Turbo Limited.

=== 1989 ===
Changes for the 1989 model year include modifications to the wastegate actuator, feed location and engine management increased power output by on the turbo model. The engine mount and brace were also revised in late 1989. The changes made to the cross member and mounts made to accommodate the (1JZ engine) for Japanese models. The protective body molding was also changed by taking away the steel reinforcement. This made the molding lighter and prevented the rusting problem found on the previous year models. The &quot;white package&quot; was introduced as well, featuring white body molding and white &quot;saw blade&quot; wheels. Interior choices were limited to blue and burgundy only. Other than pure cosmetics changes, there was nothing different from other models. All models received rear 3-point seat belts to replace the previous years&#x27; two-point lap belts. New tail lights, front bumper with integrated lower grille (as opposed to the previous years&#x27; detachable grille), side mirrors, turn signals, upper grilles, foglights, steering wheel, door panels, climate control, window switches and bezels, and stereo are added. Addition of coat hooks on B-pillar and removal of rear seat pockets round out interior changes. Turbo models received three piece spoiler with an integrated LED brake light. 1989 also marked the end of headlight washers in the US and SuperMonitor; an advanced system offered by Toyota able to calculate miles able to be traveled on current tank, ability to check vehicle codes from inside the cabin, among other features.

=== 1990 ===
For the 1990 model year, changes included larger protective laminate in front of rear wheels, lower redline (owing to the heavier crank with cylinders 2 &amp; 5 counterbalanced), redesigned steering wheel with cruise control relocated to a stalk on the right side (US only). In addition to a driver-side airbag and airbag indicator light on dashboard (US only), the left side of the switch panel was also redesigned, which replaced one of the coin slots with the dimmer. The lower dashboard panel became a two-piece design, which was also much heavier than the previous one-piece panel owing to a change in material. Finally, the memory lever on the steering column was removed. In short, a plethora of the changes for the 1989 and 1990 were to the interior.

=== 1991 ===
For the 1991 model year, the wheel design was changed to 5-spoke wheels. Both models had 16x7-inch aluminium alloy wheels that were fitted with 225/50/16 tyres and full-sized spares on steel wheels. Body molding changed in colour to better match the exterior. The front &quot;Supra&quot; emblem was also changed to the current corporate oval Toyota symbol was used from this model year onwards. The speedometer was also revised, and included more lines that were removed in 1989, but still did not have as many (one line per mph) as 1986.5 to 1988 models. New interior colours, namely shadow gray and deep red, were introduced, which marked the end of medium gray, tan and burgundy. Blue interior became only available on white packages, and those with blue paint. Burgundy was replaced with white package-only deep red. Every other body colour received a shadow gray interior, with leather interiors retaining medium gray seats and interior inserts. Front speakers were changed from 3.5 inch to 6.5 inches and the speaker cover was also enlarged to accommodate them. Beginning in 1991, Toyota began to offer a factory spoiler-style panel sunroof. These sunroofs are now highly sought after and rare since they were introduced in the ending production years of the A70 Supra.

=== 1992 ===
For the 1992 model year, the leather shadow gray interiors received black seats and inserts. Non-turbo models lost the option of a targa top, and a new optional subwoofer was available. Subwoofer-equipped Supras did without the rear bins and wooden &quot;floorboard&quot;. Instead, rear carpet was molded to the spare tyre, and there was a cut-out for the woofer housing.

=== JZA70 and GA70 ===
The Japanese models of the Supra were given the chassis codes JZA70 and GA70 respectively. The JZA70 has a 2.5-litre parallel twin-turbocharged 1JZ-GTE engine, and the GA70 has a 2.0-litre twin-turbocharged 1G-GTE and a naturally aspirated 1G-GEU engines respectively.

==== JZA70-R ====
In addition to the introduction of the JZA70 in 1990, Toyota introduced a special version of the JZA70 with the 1JZ-GTE engine known as the 2.5 Twin Turbo R model (JZA70-R). It boasted additional upgrades, including lighter sway bars, a larger intercooler, Torsen differential, Interbred TEIN/Bilstein sports suspension, Shadow/Dark grey interior trim, MOMO steering wheel and gear knob and Recaro seats and door trim. The wheels were painted charcoal grey, and the front bumper lip featured channeled air ducts for the front brakes. The Twin Turbo R introduced a new and exclusive colour option in 1992 for the JZA70-R model known as Jade Mica Green. (Note: this colour was also available in Europe) The JZA70-R model is the lightest and fastest model of third generation of the Supra.

=== Turbo A ===
The Turbo-A was Toyota&#x27;s evolution model for the Group A touring car series that required a minimum homologation run of 500 units. The Turbo-A was manufactured for 2 months during the period of September and October 1988 and was available strictly in Japan. Thus the term 88 Spec A. Some notable differences between the standard MA70 Supra 3.0 GT and the Turbo-A model are both cosmetic and mechanical;

* The standard CT-26 turbo had a slightly larger inducer and can be identified by a stamped &quot;E&quot; on the raised casting on the compressor housing.
* The Turbo-A had a wide throttle body and accompanied a larger diameter &quot;blank&quot; crossover pipe, instead of the standard 7M-GTE throttle body and original &quot;3000&quot; cast pipe. 
* The Turbo-A also benefited from a larger volume steel air cleaner instead of the factory plastic unit
* Thicker roll bars front and rear
* Ventilated brake discs all-round
* The fuel management used a MAP system, instead of the standard Karmen Vortex AFM. 
* The front nose features an additional &quot;Turbo A duct&quot; to add airflow to the top area of the intercooler. 
* Also unique was the side decal and rear badging (&quot;3.0GT Turbo A&quot;) and a black paint job (paint code 202).

All cars came standard with grey leather interior featuring a MOMO-sourced steering wheel and shift knob. It is powered by a Toyota 7M-GTEU engine. It is important to note that the 7M-GTEU was standard in all Japanese MA70 models and is not unique to the Turbo-A. The &quot;U&quot; designation meant the engine came equipped with a catalytic converter as per Japan emission laws.

The Group-A MA70 Supra had varying degrees of success in various fields such as Rally and 24HR, but is most known for its participation in the Japanese Touring Car Championship (JTCC). In the JTCC the Supra did not win as many races as intended, which is primarily judged on the fact it was underdeveloped and its placement in a higher tier division under regulations because of the 3.0-litre engine displacement, imposing the Toyota with the performance inhibition of running with a higher curb weight and less power compared to the rest of its class. Both the TOM&#x27;S and SARD teams fared well in results in the (JTCC) with the TOM&#x27;S team winning on its debut in 1987, before abruptly ending their (JTCC) career with the MA70 Group-A in 1989.

Upon its initial Australian Touring Car Championship (ATCC) debut in 1989, the Group-A Supra failed to finish its first race. With DNF&#x27;s becoming a regular upset owing to the lack of power and heavy weight of the Supra, it began to strike doubt in the car&#x27;s capability of success in the (ATCC) which suffered increasingly due to constant rules and regulation changes issuing a red-faced outcome against its main rivals like the Ford Sierra Cosworth RS500, Nissan Skyline HR31 GTS-R and the BMW M3 (E30) which were lighter, more powerful and had more development behind them. Hopes would further diminish for Toyota in the top division by the introduction of the domineering Nissan Skyline GT-R (R32) in the (JTCC) in 1989 and the Australian Touring Car Championship (ATCC) in 1990. Australian racing team Fitzgerald Racing won the first edition of the March 1991 Bathurst 12 Hour. Toyota in 1991 would switch to racing the Corolla Levin instead in the lower tier divisions, while many privateer teams soldiered on with the Supra until the Group A racing&#x27;s final demise in 1993. 

Only eleven MA70 Group-A cars were built by TRD Japan for homologation racing. A few out of many special developed parts that were fitted to the various Group-A race cars happen to include a cast magnesium nine litre oil pan with matching high flow oil pump, 288 camshafts with 10.88mm lift, Hollinger close proportion 5-speed gear-set in the R154 case, Harrop 4 piston brake calipers with 15.5-inch (393 mm) rotors, and TRD-sourced torque-vectoring mechanical limited-slip differential with 50:50 left:right lockup on full throttle. TRD was also responsible for the thick rear-anti squat tram-rods which were integral to the multi-link rear suspension setup to control rear squat under hard acceleration and launching.

=== Powertrain ===


== Fourth generation (A80; 1993) ==
The production of the A80 began in February 1989 under various teams for design, product planning, and engineering led by Isao Tsuzuki. By the middle of 1990, a final A80 design concept from Toyota Technical Centre Aichi was approved and frozen for production in late 1990. The first test mules were hand-built in A70 bodies during late 1990, followed by the first A80 prototypes being hand-assembled in 1991.

Again using subframe, suspension, and drivetrain assemblies from the Z30 Soarer (Lexus SC300/400), pre-production of the test models started in December 1992 with 20 units made, and official mass production began in April 1993. The fourth-generation Supra again shared its platform with the upscale Soarer coupe, sold in the US as the Lexus SC. Although the two cars looked similar dimension-wise, the new Supra was more than 13 inches (340 mm) shorter than its luxurious cousin.

This redesign saw Toyota placing great emphasis on a more serious high-performance car. The A80 featured two new engines: a naturally aspirated Toyota 2JZ-GE having a power output of at 5,800 rpm and at 4,800 rpm of torque and a twin turbocharged Toyota 2JZ-GTE having a power output of and of torque for the Japanese model. For the export model (American/European markets) Toyota upgraded the Supra turbo&#x27;s engine (by installing smaller, steel wheeled turbochargers and bigger fuel injectors, etc.). This increased the power output to at 5,600 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm ( and for European markets) Upon its launch in 1993, it was the first Toyota-badged vehicle to include a passenger-side airbag as standard (US-market only).

The twin turbochargers operated in sequential mode instead of parallel. Initially, all of the exhaust gases are routed to the first turbine for reduced lag. This resulted in boost and enhanced torque as early as 1,800 rpm, where it already produced of torque. At 3,500 rpm, some of the exhaust gases are routed to the second turbine for a &quot;pre-boost&quot; mode, although none of the compressor output is used by the engine at this point. At 4,000 rpm, the second turbo&#x27;s output is used to augment the first turbo&#x27;s output. Compared to the parallel mode, sequential mode turbochargers provide quicker low RPM response and increased high RPM boost. This high RPM boost was also aided with technology originally present in the 7M-GE in the form of the Acoustic Control Induction System (ACIS) which is a way of managing the air compression pulses within the intake piping as to increase power.

For this generation, the Supra received a new six-speed Getrag/Toyota &quot;V160&quot; gearbox on the turbo models while the naturally aspirated models were equipped with a five-speed manual W58 transmission, revised from the previous model. Each model was offered with a four-speed automatic with manual shifting mode.

All vehicles were equipped with five-spoke aluminium alloy wheels. The naturally aspirated models had 16-inch wheels while the turbo models had 17-inch wheels with 235/45/17 front and 255/40/17 rear tyres. The difference in wheel size was to accommodate the larger brakes equipped as standard on the turbo model, but in Japan were optional equipment. The turbo models had 4-piston front calipers with 2-piston rear calipers. The naturally aspirated models came equipped with dual front and single rear piston calipers. Both models had a space saver spare tyre on a steel rim to save both space and weight. All models used a double-wishbone suspension front and rear. 

Toyota took measures to reduce the weight of this new model. Aluminium was used for the bonnet, targa top (when fitted), front crossmember, oil and transmission pans, and forged upper suspension A-arms. Other measures included hollow carpet fibres, magnesium-alloy steering wheel, plastic gas tank and lid, dished out head bolts, gas injected rear spoiler, and a single pipe exhaust. Despite having more features such as dual airbags, traction control, larger brakes, wheels, tyres, and an additional turbocharger, the car was at least lighter than its predecessor. The base model with a manual transmission had a curb weight of . The targa top added of weight while the automatic transmission added . The fourth-generation model had a 51:49 (front:rear) weight distribution. The turbo model weighed with a manual transmission while the automatic added another to the overall weight. Weight distribution was 53% front and 47% rear. The Supra was heavier than the Mazda RX-7 and all aluminium bodied Acura/Honda NSX and weighed about the same amount as the Nissan 300ZX, but was lighter than the Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4.

By the late 1990s, sales of all sport coupes were declining in North America. Furthermore, a stronger yen pushed prices up in markets outside Japan. The Supra was withdrawn from the Canadian market in 1996 and the US in 1998. The Turbo was not available in 1998 in California Air Resources Board (CARB) states. Production continued in Japan until August 2002, ceasing owing to restrictive emission standards.

=== Performance ===
The turbocharged variant could accelerate in as low as 4.6 seconds and cover in 13.1 seconds at . &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine includes a rollout in their 4.6 seconds test (typically about 0.3 second) that they subtract from the acceleration figures. The turbo version has a tested top speed of , but the cars are restricted to just in Japan and in worldwide markets. European versions of the car also had an air intake or scoop on the bonnet. It has a for the naturally aspirated models and 0.32 for the turbo models but unknown with the rear spoiler.

The standard A80 Supra chassis has also proven an effective platform for roadracing, with several top 20 and top 10 One Lap of America finishes in the SSGT1 class. In 1994, the A80 managed remarkable skidpad ratings of 0.95 lateral g&#x27;s (200 ft) and 0.98 lateral g&#x27;s (300 ft) The Supra also featured a four-sensor four-channel track tuned ABS system with yaw control whereby each caliper is sensored and the brakes are controlled individually according to the speed, angle, and pitch of the approaching corner. This unique Formula One-inspired braking system allowed the Supra Turbo to record a -0 braking distance of , the best braking performance of any production car tested in 1997 by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine. This record was finally broken in 2004 by a Porsche Carrera GT, which did it in .

=== 1994 ===
In 1994, Toyota Racing Development displayed a replica of the 1994 JGTC BLITZ Racing Team Supra GT500 race car, known as the TRD3000GT. The differences with the standard Supra was mainly with the body kits, aiming for better aerodynamics. The new body kit made the car 60 mm wider at the front and 50 mm wider at the rear. This allowed wider wheels to be fitted, which in turn improved the car&#x27;s lateral grip. The engine and suspension also got small modifications. Only 35 examples of these were ever produced, each of which came with its own specially numbered VIN plate that officially re-classified the car as a TRD3000GT rather than a Toyota Supra.

=== 1995 ===
In 1995, for the 1996 model year, in the US the turbo model was only available with an automatic transmission owing to OBD-II certification requirements. The targa roof was also made standard on all turbo models.

=== 1996 ===
In 1996, for the 1997 model year, manual transmission returned for the turbo engine along with a redesign of the taillights, headlights, front fascia, polished wheels, and other minor changes such as the radio and steering wheel designs. Each of the Supras had a badge indicating &quot;Limited Edition 15th Anniversary&quot;. All turbo models came standard with the rear spoiler.

=== 1997 ===
In 1997, for the 1998 model year, updates were a 3-spoke steering wheel, a redesigned radio, and VVT-i on the naturally aspirated engine. In Japan, the turbo engines were installed with VVT-i. The SZ-R model was also updated with the introduction of a six-speed Getrag V161 transmission, the same one used for the twin-turbo RZ models. The RZ-S received a tiptronic gearbox with steering wheel mounted gear controls. The RZ and SZ-R were both factory-fitted with Toyotas REAS suspension and carbon-fibre steering wheel to aid in the light feeling of steering. The RZ only came with a six-speed manual gearbox that was also used on the SZ-R and was factory fitted with Recaro SR2 front seats. The RZ model series of this time would end up being one of the rarest halo cars of the Japanese manufacturers, with about 653 units being produced for the 1998 model year up until the end of production in 2002, being outsold by the Nissan Skyline GTR, Mazda RX7 and the Honda/Acura NSX.

== Fifth generation (J29/DB; 2019) ==

The fifth-generation Supra was released in January 2019 after 17 years off the market as the GR Supra, part of Toyota&#x27;s Gazoo Racing (GR) family of performance cars. It was developed in partnership with BMW, sharing the platform and many parts from the BMW Z4 (G29) with BMW derived 4- and 6-cylinder turbocharged engines and maintaining rear-wheel drive layout from the previous Supra. The model is designated with BMW model codes &quot;J29&quot; or &quot;DB&quot;, however Toyota used the &quot;A90&quot; and &quot;A91&quot; codes for promotional and marketing materials for the fifth-generation Supra to maintain the lineage from the previous Supra. The GR Supra is manufactured at the Magna Steyr plant in Graz, Austria alongside the Z4.

The fifth-generation Toyota Supra was launched in total seven colour options including CU Later Gray, Stratosphere, Burnout, Absolute Zero, Nocturnal, Renaissance 2.0, and Nitro Yellow. Apart from the cosmetics, in 2023, new driving modes are introduced called Hairpin+. This mode allows additional wheel-spin on one of the rear tyres to help rotate the Supra around ultra-tight hairpin turns.

<text>Christophe Thierry Daniel Rocancourt colloquially Christopher Rocancourt (born 16 July 1967), is a French impostor and confidence man who scammed affluent people by masquerading in turn as a French nobleman, the heir to the Rockefeller family or family member of a celebrity.

== Early life and education ==
Rocancourt was born 16 July 1967 in Honfleur, France, to Daniel Rocancourt, a financially destitute painter, who suffered from alcoholism and unemployment, and Annick Rocancourt (née Villars), a 17-year-old prostitute, whom his father married one month after he was born. He has a younger sister, Angelina. Rocancourt confirmed to &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; in a 2006 broadcast that his mother sometimes worked as a prostitute.

== Later life ==
His first big con was made in Paris, where he faked the deed to a property that he did not own, which he then &quot;sold&quot; for US$1.4 million.

Making his way to the United States, Rocancourt used at least a dozen aliases, and got the rich and powerful to invest in his schemes, he told &quot;Dateline&quot;, by tapping into their greed. He convinced them that he, too, was rich by paying for their lavish dinners in cash. He once estimated to &quot;Dateline&quot; that his various schemes/ventures netted him at least US$40 million, but this cannot be confirmed.

In Los Angeles, he pretended to be a movie producer, ex-boxing champion or venture capitalist; he also claimed to be the illegitimate son of Sophia Loren, the nephew of Oscar de la Renta and Dino De Laurentiis, and he associated himself with various celebrities, living for a time with Mickey Rourke, and apparently convincing actor Jean-Claude Van Damme to produce his next movie. He was also in talks with Jermaine Jackson to develop a line of fragrances inspired by Michael Jackson songs.

Rocancourt, using the name Christopher De Laurentiis, married Gry Park in 1992, with whom he had a child. He married &quot;Playboy&quot; model Pia Reyes in May 1996, and they had a son, Zeus. Beside being married to Pia Reyes, according to the press, he lived with &quot;Playboy&quot; model Rhonda Rydell for six months; Rydell did not know Rocancourt was married, and said he had told her he was French nobility, the son of a countess.

In 1997 police raided Rocancourt&#x27;s hotel suite, and in 1998 he was arrested for involvement in a shootout before he jumped bail.

In 1999 he was freed of charges of forging passports after he had bribed State Department employees to get a passport. He was arrested in 2000 in the Hamptons for an unpaid hotel bill, and was also wanted for involvement in diamond smuggling, possession of hand grenades, money laundering, bribery, perjury, and at least 17 cases of defrauding people by offering them to invest with him.

After posting bail, he again fled and relocated to Canada where he assumed the identity of Grand Prix driver Michael van Hoven. On April 27, 2001 he and Reyes were detained in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, and Rocancourt was later charged with defrauding an elderly couple; Reyes was released after convincing authorities that she had no part in the scam, much less any idea of her husband&#x27;s criminal activities. Rocancourt served a year in prison before being extradited to New York and pleading guilty to charges of theft, grand larceny, smuggling, bribery, perjury and fraud against 19 victims. In September 2003, the plea resulted in a fine of $9 million, an order to pay $1.2 million in restitution and a term of three years and ten months in federal prison.

While being held in Canada, Rocancourt wrote an autobiography in which he ridiculed his victims. In Switzerland, police have connected him with a jewel theft, and at one point barred him from the country for 14 years; this ban expired in 2016.

Rocancourt returned to Paris in October 2005 after completing his prison sentence. He lived with former Miss France Sonia Rolland, and they had a daughter together, named Tess. They announced their split in early 2008.

In July 2009, French filmmaker Catherine Breillat accused Rocancourt of scamming her out of €700,000. Breillat, who was diagnosed with a cerebrovascular disease in 2004, accused him of taking advantage of her due to her mental incapacity. Due to this event, the film &quot;Bad Love&quot;, with Rocancourt and model Naomi Campbell, was cancelled. Breillat told a French journalist that her first meeting with Rocancourt was the worst day of her life, even worse than the day when she was diagnosed with her cerebrovascular disease. In 2012, Rocancourt was convicted of &quot;abus de faiblesse&quot; (&quot;abuse of weakness&quot;) for taking Breillat&#x27;s money, and sentenced to 16 months in prison.

In October 2014, he was arrested along with his lawyer, 23-year-old girlfriend, and a member of the French police that he allegedly bribed to supply him with genuine passports and visas to be sold on for extortionate sums to illegal migrants.

==In popular culture==
The American Court TV (now TruTV) television series &quot;Mugshots&quot; released an episode on Christophe Rocancourt titled &quot;Chris Rocancourt - A French Con&quot;, aired in 2013.

Catherine Breillat&#x27;s 2014 film &quot;Abuse of Weakness&quot; presents a lightly fictionalized depiction of her relationship with Rocancourt.

72 Hours: True Crime S2E2, &quot;The Hustler,&quot; is about Christophe Rocancourt and his crimes in Canada.

The American TV show &quot;The Unexplained&quot; discussed his abilities and how he manipulated people.

The Investigation Discovery show Vanity Fair Confidential also covered his story in the first season sixth episode.

The Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent season 1 episode &quot;The Extra Man&quot; was inspired by Christophe Rocancourt.

In 2024, David Serero directed and produced the official biopic with Christophe Rocancourt: &quot;ROCANCOURT, The Film,&quot; which was released in movie theaters in France and Europe and premiered at the 2024 Cannes Film Festival.

<doc id="436590" wikidata="Q171958" url="?curid=436590" title="Sidney Reilly">
<text>Sidney George Reilly (; – 5 November 1925), known as the &quot;Ace of Spies&quot;, was a Russian-born adventurer and secret agent employed by Scotland Yard&#x27;s Special Branch and later by the Foreign Section of the British Secret Service Bureau, the precursor to the modern British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6/SIS). He is alleged to have spied for at least four different great powers, and documentary evidence indicates that he was involved in espionage activities in 1890s London among Russian émigré circles, in Manchuria on the eve of the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05), and in an abortive 1918 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Bolshevik government in Moscow.

Reilly disappeared in Soviet Russia in the mid-1920s, lured by the Cheka&#x27;s Operation Trust. British diplomat and journalist R. H. Bruce Lockhart publicised his and Reilly&#x27;s 1918 exploits to overthrow the Bolshevik regime in Lockhart&#x27;s 1932 book &quot;Memoirs of a British Agent.&quot; This became an international best-seller and garnered global fame for Reilly. The memoirs retold the efforts by Reilly, Lockhart, and other conspirators to sabotage the Bolshevik revolution while still in its infancy.

The world press made Reilly into a household name within five years of his execution by Soviet agents in 1925, lauding him as a peerless spy and recounting his many espionage adventures. Newspapers dubbed him &quot;the greatest spy in history&quot; and &quot;the Scarlet Pimpernel of Red Russia&quot;. The London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; described his exploits in an illustrated serial in May 1931 headlined &quot;Master Spy&quot;. Ian Fleming used him as a model for James Bond in his novels set in the early Cold War. Reilly is considered to be &quot;the dominating figure in the mythology of modern British espionage&quot;.

== Birth and youth ==
The true details about Reilly&#x27;s origin, identity, and exploits have eluded researchers and intelligence agencies for more than a century. Reilly himself told several versions of his background to confuse and mislead investigators. At different times in his life, he claimed to be the son of an Irish merchant seaman, an Irish clergyman, and an aristocratic landowner connected to the court of Emperor Alexander III of Russia. According to a Soviet secret police dossier compiled in 1925, he was perhaps born Zigmund Markovich Rozenblum on 24 March 1874 in Odessa, a Black Sea port of Emperor Alexander II&#x27;s Russian Empire. According to this dossier, his father, Markus, was a doctor and shipping agent, while his mother came from an impoverished noble family.

Other sources claim that Reilly was born Georgy Rosenblum in Odessa on 24 March 1873. In one account, his birth name is given as Salomon Rosenblum in Kherson Gubernia of the Russian Empire, the illegitimate son of Polina (or &quot;Perla&quot;) and Dr. Mikhail Abramovich Rosenblum, the cousin of Reilly&#x27;s father Grigory Rosenblum. There is also speculation that he was the son of a merchant marine captain and Polina.

Yet another source states that he was born Sigmund Georgievich Rosenblum on 24 March 1874, the only son of Pauline and Gregory Rosenblum, a wealthy Polish-Jewish family with an estate at Bielsk in the Grodno Governorate of Imperial Russia. His father was known locally as George rather than Gregory, hence Sigmund&#x27;s patronymic Georgievich. The family seems to have been well-connected in Polish nationalist circles through Pauline&#x27;s intimate friendship with Ignacy Jan Paderewski, the Polish statesman who became Prime Minister of Poland and also Poland&#x27;s foreign minister in 1919.

== Travels abroad ==

According to reports of the tsarist political police, the Okhrana, Rosenblum was arrested in 1892 for his involvement in political activities and for serving as a courier for a revolutionary group known as &quot;the Friends of Enlightenment.&quot; He escaped judicial punishment, and he later was friends with Okhrana agents such as Alexander Nikolayevich Grammatikov, and these details might indicate that he was a police informant even at this young age.

After Reilly&#x27;s release, his father told him that his mother was dead and that his biological father was her Jewish doctor, Mikhail A. Rosenblum. Distraught by this news, he faked his death in Odessa harbour and stowed away aboard a British ship bound for South America. In Brazil, he adopted the name Pedro and worked odd jobs as a dock worker, a road mender, a plantation labourer, and a cook for a British intelligence expedition in 1895. He allegedly saved both the expedition and the life of Major Charles Fothergill when hostile natives attacked them. Rosenblum seized a British officer&#x27;s pistol and killed the attackers with expert marksmanship. Fothergill rewarded his bravery with 1,500 pounds sterling, a British passport, and passage to Britain, where Pedro became Sidney Rosenblum.

However, the record of evidence contradicts this tale of Brazil. Evidence indicates that Rosenblum arrived in London from France in December 1895, prompted by his unscrupulous acquisition of a large sum of money and a hasty departure from Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, a residential suburb of Paris. According to this account, Rosenblum and his Polish accomplice Yan Voitek waylaid two Italian anarchists on 25 December 1895 and robbed them of a substantial amount of revolutionary funds. One anarchist&#x27;s throat was cut; the other, named Constant Della Cassa, died from knife wounds in Fontainebleau Hospital three days later. The French newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Union Républicaine de Saône-et-Loire&quot; reported the incident on 27 December 1895:
Police learned that the physical description of one assailant matched Rosenblum&#x27;s, but he was already en route to Britain. His accomplice Voitek later told British intelligence officers about this incident and other dealings with Rosenblum. Several months prior to this murder, Rosenblum had met Ethel Lilian Boole, a young Englishwoman who was a budding writer and active in Russian émigré circles. The couple developed a rapport and began a sexual liaison, and he told her about his past in Russia. After the affair concluded, they continued to correspond. In 1897, Boole published &quot;The Gadfly&quot;, a critically acclaimed novel whose central character was allegedly based on Reilly&#x27;s life as Rosenblum. In the novel, the protagonist is an illegitimate child who feigns suicide to escape his illegitimate past and then travels to South America. He later returns to Europe and becomes involved with Italian anarchists and other revolutionaries.

For decades, certain biographers had dismissed the Reilly-Boole liaison as unsubstantiated. However, evidence was found in 2016 among archived correspondence in the extended Boole-Hinton family, confirming that a relationship transpired between Reilly and Boole around 1895 in Florence. There is some question of whether he was genuinely smitten with Boole and sincerely returned her affections, as he might have been a paid police informant reporting on her activities and those of other radicals.

== In London: 1890s ==

Reilly continued to go by the name Rosenblum, living at the Albert Mansions, an apartment block in Rosetta Street, Waterloo, London, in early 1896. He created the Ozone Preparations Company, which peddled patent medicines, and he became a paid informant for the émigré intelligence network of William Melville, superintendent of Scotland Yard&#x27;s Special Branch. Melville later oversaw a special section of the British Secret Service Bureau founded in 1909.

In 1897, Rosenblum began an affair with Margaret Thomas (née Callaghan), the youthful wife of Reverend Hugh Thomas, shortly before her husband&#x27;s death. Rosenblum met Rev. Thomas in London through his Ozone Preparations Company because Thomas had a kidney inflammation and was intrigued by the miracle cures peddled by Rosenblum. Rev. Thomas introduced Rosenblum to his wife at his manor house, and they began having an affair. On 4 March 1898, Hugh Thomas altered his will and appointed Margaret as an executrix; he was found dead in his room on 12 March 1898, just a week after the new will was made. A mysterious Dr. T. W. Andrew, whose physical description matched that of Rosenblum, appeared to certify Thomas&#x27;s death as generic influenza and proclaimed that there was no need for an inquest. Records indicate that there was no one by the name of Dr. T. W. Andrew in Great Britain circa 1897.

Margaret Thomas insisted that her husband&#x27;s body be ready for burial 36 hours after his death. She inherited roughly £800,000. The Metropolitan Police did not investigate Dr. T. W. Andrew, nor did they investigate the nurse whom Margaret had hired, who was previously linked to the arsenic poisoning of a former employer. Four months later, on 22 August 1898, Rosenblum married Margaret Thomas at Holborn Registry Office in London. The two witnesses at the ceremony were Charles Richard Cross, a government official, and Joseph Bell, an Admiralty clerk. Both would eventually marry the daughters of Henry Freeman Pannett, an associate of William Melville. The marriage not only brought the wealth which Rosenblum desired but provided a pretext to discard his identity of Sigmund Rosenblum; with Melville&#x27;s assistance, he crafted a new identity: &quot;Sidney George Reilly&quot;. This new identity was key to achieving his desire to return to the Russian Empire and voyage to the Far East. Reilly &quot;obtained his new identity and nationality without taking any legal steps to change his name and without making an official application for British citizenship, all of which suggests some type of official intervention.&quot; This intervention likely occurred to facilitate his upcoming work in Russia on behalf of British intelligence.

== Russia and the Far East ==
In June 1899, the newly endowed Reilly and his wife Margaret travelled to Emperor Nicholas II&#x27;s Russian Empire using Reilly&#x27;s forged British passport—a travel document and a cover identity both purportedly created by William Melville. While in St. Petersburg he was approached by Japanese General Akashi Motojiro (1864–1919) to work for the Japanese Secret Intelligence Services. A keen judge of character, Akashi believed the most reliable spies were those who were motivated by profit instead of by feelings of sympathy towards Japan and, accordingly, he believed Reilly to be such a person.

As tensions between Russia and Japan escalated toward war, Akashi had a budget of ¥1,000,000 provided by the Japanese Ministry of War to gather information on the movements of Russian troops and naval developments. Akashi instructed Reilly to offer financial aid to Russian revolutionaries in exchange for information about the Russian Intelligence Services and, more importantly, to determine the strength of the Russian armed forces, particularly in the Far East. Accepting Akashi&#x27;s recruitment overtures, Reilly now became simultaneously an agent for both the British War Office and the Japanese Empire. While his wife Margaret remained in St. Petersburg, Reilly allegedly reconnoitred the Caucasus for its oil deposits and compiled a resource prospectus as part of &quot;The Great Game&quot;. He reported his findings to the British Government, which paid him for the assignment.

Shortly before the Russo-Japanese War, Reilly appeared in Port Arthur, Manchuria, in the guise of a timber company owner. Here he remained for four years, familiarising himself with political conditions in the Far East and obtaining a degree of personal influence in the ongoing espionage activities in the region. At the time he was still a double agent for the British and the Japanese governments. The Russian-controlled Port Arthur lay under the ever-darkening spectre of a Japanese invasion, and Reilly and his business partner Moisei Akimovich Ginsburg turned the precarious situation to their benefit. By purchasing and reselling enormous amounts of foodstuffs, raw materials, medicine, and coal, they made a small fortune as war profiteers.

Reilly achieved even greater success in January 1904 when he and his Chinese engineer acquaintance, Ho Liang Shung, allegedly stole the Port Arthur harbour defence plans for the Japanese Navy. Guided by these stolen plans, the Japanese Navy navigated by night through the Russian minefield protecting the harbour and launched a surprise attack on Port Arthur on the night of 8–9 February 1904 (Monday 8 February – Tuesday 9 February). However, the stolen plans did not help the Japanese much. Despite ideal conditions for a surprise attack, their combat results were relatively poor. Although more than 31,000 Russians ultimately perished defending Port Arthur, Japanese losses were much higher, and these losses nearly undermined their war effort.

According to writer Winfried Lüdecke , Reilly quickly became an obvious target of suspicion by Russian authorities at Port Arthur. Thereafter, he discovered one of his business subordinates was an agent of Russian counter-espionage and chose to leave the region. Upon departing Port Arthur, Reilly travelled to Imperial Japan in the company of an unidentified woman where the Japanese government handsomely paid him for his prior intelligence services. If he made a detour to Japan, presumably to be paid for his espionage, he could not have stayed very long, for by February 1905, he appeared in Paris. By the time he had returned to Europe from the Far East, Reilly &quot;had become a self-confident international adventurer&quot; who was &quot;fluent in several languages&quot; and whose intelligence services were highly desired by various great powers. At the same time, he was described as possessing &quot;a foolhardy adventurous nature&quot; prone to taking unnecessary risks. This latter trait would later result in him being nicknamed &quot;reckless&quot; by other British agents.

== Continental exploits ==
=== D&#x27;Arcy affair ===
During the brief time Reilly spent in Paris, he renewed his close acquaintance with William Melville whom Reilly had last seen just prior to his 1899 departure from London. While Reilly had been abroad in the Far East, Melville had resigned in November 1903 as Superintendent of Scotland Yard&#x27;s Special Branch and had become chief of a new intelligence section in the War Office. Working under commercial cover from an unassuming flat in London, Melville now ran both counter-intelligence and foreign intelligence operations using his foreign contacts, which he had accumulated during his years running Special Branch. Reilly&#x27;s meeting with Melville in Paris is most significant, for within a matter of weeks, Melville was to use Reilly&#x27;s expertise in what would later become known as the D&#x27;Arcy Affair.

In 1904, the Board of the Admiralty projected that petroleum would supplant coal as the primary source of fuel for the Royal Navy. As petroleum was not abundant in Britain, it would be necessary to find—and secure—sufficient supplies overseas. During their investigation, the British Admiralty learned that an Australian mining engineer William Knox D&#x27;Arcy—who founded the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC)—had obtained a valuable concession from Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar regarding oil rights in southern Persia. D&#x27;Arcy was negotiating a similar concession from the Ottoman Empire for oil rights in Mesopotamia. The Admiralty initiated efforts to entice D&#x27;Arcy to sell his newly acquired oil rights to the British Government rather than to the French de Rothschilds.

Reilly, at the British Admiralty&#x27;s request, located William D&#x27;Arcy at Cannes in the south of France and approached him in disguise. Dressed as a Catholic priest, Reilly gate-crashed the private discussions on board the Rothschild yacht on the pretext of collecting donations for a religious charity. He then secretly informed D&#x27;Arcy that the British could offer him a superior financial deal. D&#x27;Arcy promptly terminated negotiations with the Rothschilds and returned to London to meet with the British Admiralty. However, biographer Andrew Cook has questioned Reilly&#x27;s involvement in the D&#x27;Arcy Affair since, in February 1904, Reilly might still have been in Port Arthur. Cook speculates that it was Reilly&#x27;s intelligence chief, William Melville, and a British intelligence officer, Henry Curtis Bennett, who undertook the D&#x27;Arcy assignment. Yet another possibility advanced in &quot;The Prize&quot; by the writer Daniel Yergin has the British Admiralty creating a &quot;syndicate of patriots&quot; to keep D&#x27;Arcy&#x27;s concession in British hands, apparently with the full and eager co-operation of D&#x27;Arcy himself.

Although the extent of Reilly&#x27;s involvement in this particular incident is uncertain, it has been verified that he stayed after the incident in the French Riviera on the Côte d&#x27;Azur, a location very near the Rothschild yacht. At the conclusion of the D&#x27;Arcy Affair, Reilly journeyed to Brussels, and, in January 1905, he returned to St. Petersburg, Russia.

=== Frankfurt Air Show ===
In &quot;Ace of Spies&quot;, biographer Robin Bruce Lockhart recounts Reilly&#x27;s alleged involvement in obtaining a newly developed German magneto at the first Frankfurt International Air Show () in 1909. According to Lockhart, on the fifth day of the air show in Frankfurt am Main, a German plane lost control and crashed, killing the pilot. The plane&#x27;s engine was alleged to have used a new type of magneto that was far ahead of other designs.

Reilly and a British SIS agent posing as one of the exhibition pilots diverted the attention of spectators. At the same time, they removed the magneto from the wreck and substituted another. The SIS agent quickly made detailed drawings of the German magneto, and when the aeroplane had been removed to a hangar, the agent and Reilly managed to restore the original magneto. However, later biographers such as Spence and Cook have countered that this incident is unsubstantiated. During the event, there is no documentary evidence of any plane crashes occurring.

=== Stealing weapon plans ===

In 1909, when the German Kaiser was expanding the war machine of Imperial Germany, British intelligence had scant knowledge regarding the types of weapons being forged inside Germany&#x27;s war plants. At the behest of British intelligence, Reilly was sent to obtain the plans for the weapons. Reilly arrived in Essen, Germany, disguised as a Baltic shipyard worker by the name of Karl Hahn. Having prepared his cover identity by learning to weld at a Sheffield engineering firm, Reilly obtained a low-level position as a welder at the Krupp Gun Works plant in Essen. He soon joined the plant fire brigade and persuaded the foreman of the importance of having plant schematics that indicated the locations of fire extinguishers and hydrants. These schematics were soon placed in the foreman&#x27;s office for the fire brigade members to consult, and Reilly began using them to locate the plans.

In the early morning hours, Reilly picked the lock of the office where the plans were kept but was discovered by the foreman, whom he then strangled before completing the theft. From Essen, Reilly took a train to a safe house in Dortmund. Tearing the plans into four pieces, he mailed each separately so that if one were lost, the other three would still reveal the essence of the plans. Biographer Cook questions the veracity of this incident but concedes that German factory records show a Karl Hahn was indeed employed by the Essen plant during this time and that a plant fire brigade existed.

In fact, before the First World War, he is alleged to have operated in Russia (from September 1905 to April 1914, as an assistant naval attaché of Great Britain) and then in Europe. By April 1912, Reilly returned to St. Petersburg, where he assumed the role of a wealthy businessman and helped to form the Wings Aviation Club. In the reference book &quot;All Petersburg&quot;, he was listed as an &quot;antique dealer, collector&quot;. Here he took a new wife, Nadezhda, without dissolving his marriage to Margaret. He resumed his friendship with Alexander Grammatikov, an Okhrana agent and a fellow club member. Writers Richard Deacon and Edward Van Der Rhoer assert that Reilly actually was an Ochrana double agent at this point. Deacon claims he was tasked with befriending and profiling Sir Basil Zaharoff, the international arms salesman and representative of Vickers-Armstrong Munitions Ltd. Another Reilly biographer, Richard B. Spence, claims that during this assignment Reilly learned &quot;le systeme&quot; from Zaharoff — the strategy of playing all sides against each other to maximise financial profit. However, biographer Andrew Cook asserts there is scant evidence of any relationship between Reilly and Zaharoff.

== First World War activity ==

In earlier biographies by Winfried Lüdecke and Pepita Bobadilla, Reilly is described as living as a spy in Wilhelmine Germany from 1917 to 1918. Drawing upon the latter sources, Richard Deacon likewise asserted that Reilly had operated behind German lines on several occasions and once spent weeks inside the German Empire gathering information about the next planned thrust against the Allies. (In one version by Lockhart, Reilly is alleged to have been a part of a German War meeting involving Kaiser Wilhelm II). 

Most later biographies, however, concur that Reilly&#x27;s activities in the United States between 1915 and 1918 precluded any such escapades on the European Front. Later biographers believe that Reilly, while lucratively engaged in the munitions business in New York City, was covertly employed in British intelligence in which role he may well have participated in several acts of so-called &quot;German sabotage&quot; deliberately calculated to provoke the United States to enter the war against the Central Powers.

Historian Christopher Andrew notes that &quot;Reilly spent most of the first two and a half years of the war in the United States&quot;. Likewise, author Richard B. Spence states that Reilly lived in New York City for at least a year, 1914–15, where he engaged in arranging munitions sales to the Imperial German Army and its enemy the Imperial Russian Army. However, when the United States entered the war in April 1917, Reilly&#x27;s business became less profitable since his company was now prohibited from selling ammunition to the Germans and, after the Russian revolution occurred in November 1917, the Russians were no longer buying munitions. Faced with unexpected financial hardship, Reilly sought to resume his paid intelligence work for the British government while in New York City.

This is confirmed by papers of Norman Thwaites, MI1(c) Head of Station in New York, which contain evidence that Reilly approached Thwaites seeking espionage-related work in 1917–1918. Formerly a private secretary to newspaper magnate Joseph Pulitzer and a police reporter for Pulitzer&#x27;s &quot;The New York World&quot;, Thwaites was keen on obtaining information concerning radical activities in the United States; in particular, any connections between American socialists with Soviet Russia. Consequently, under Thwaites&#x27; direction, Reilly presumably worked alongside a dozen other British intelligence operatives attached to the British mission at 44 Whitehall Street in New York City. Although their ostensible mission was to coordinate with the U.S. government in regards to intelligence about the German Empire and Soviet Russia, the British agents also focused upon obtaining trade secrets and other commercial information related to American industrial companies for their British rivals.

Thwaites was sufficiently impressed with Reilly&#x27;s intelligence work in New York that he wrote a letter of recommendation to Mansfield Cumming, head of MI1(c). It was also Thwaites who recommended that Reilly first visit Toronto to obtain a military commission, which is why Reilly enlisted in the Royal Flying Corps Canada. On 19 October 1917, Reilly received a commission as a temporary second lieutenant on probation. After receiving this commission, Reilly voyaged to London in 1918, where Cumming formally swore Lieutenant Reilly into service as a staff Case Officer in His Majesty&#x27;s Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), prior to dispatching Reilly on counter-Bolshevik operations in Germany and Russia. According to Reilly&#x27;s wife Pepita Bobadilla, Reilly was sent to Russia to &quot;counter the work being done there by German agents&quot; who were supporting radical factions and &quot;to discover and report on the general feeling&quot;.

Thus Reilly arrived on Russian soil via Murmansk prior to 5 April 1918 where he contacted the former Okhrana agent Alexander Grammatikov, who believed the Soviet government &quot;was in the hands of the criminal classes and of lunatics released from the asylums&quot;. Grammatikov arranged for Reilly to receive a private interview with either Reilly&#x27;s longtime friend General Mikhail Bonch-Bruyevich or Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich, secretary of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars. With the clandestine aid of Bonch-Bruyevich, he assumed the role of a Bolshevik sympathizer. Grammatikov further instructed his niece Dagmara Karozus—a dancer in the Moscow Art Theatre—to allow Reilly to use her apartment as a &quot;safe house&quot;, and through Vladimir Orlov, a former Okhrana associate turned Cheka official, Reilly obtained travel permits as a Cheka agent.

== Ambassadors&#x27; plot ==

The attempt to assassinate Vladimir Lenin and to depose the Bolshevik government is considered by biographers to be Reilly&#x27;s most daring exploit. The Ambassadors&#x27; Plot, later misnamed in the press as the Lockhart–Reilly Plot, has sparked considerable debate over the years: did the Allies launch a clandestine operation to overthrow the Bolsheviks in the later summer of 1918 and, if so, did Felix Dzerzhinsky&#x27;s Cheka uncover the plot at the eleventh hour or did they know of the conspiracy from the outset? At the time, the dissembling American Consul-General DeWitt Clinton Poole publicly insisted the Cheka orchestrated the conspiracy from beginning to end and that Reilly was a Bolshevik agent provocateur. Later, Robert Bruce Lockhart would state that he was &quot;not to this day sure of the extent of Reilly&#x27;s responsibility for the disastrous turn of events.&quot;

In January 1918, the youthful Lockhart—a mere junior member of the British Foreign Office—had been personally handpicked by British Prime Minister David Lloyd George to undertake a sensitive diplomatic mission to Soviet Russia. Lockhart&#x27;s assigned objectives were: to liaise with the Soviet authorities, to subvert Soviet-German relations, to bolster Soviet resistance to German peace overtures, and to push Soviet authorities into recreating the Eastern Theatre. By April, however, Lockhart had hopelessly failed to achieve any of these objectives. He began to agitate in diplomatic cables for an immediate full-scale Allied military intervention in Russia. Concurrently, Lockhart ordered Reilly to pursue contacts within anti-Bolshevik circles to sow the seeds for an armed uprising in Moscow.

In May 1918, Lockhart, Reilly, and various agents of the Allied Powers repeatedly met with Boris Savinkov, head of the counter-revolutionary Union for the Defence of the Motherland and Freedom (UDMF). Savinkov had been Deputy War Minister in the Provisional Government of Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky, and a key opponent of the Bolsheviks. A former Socialist Revolutionary Party member, Savinkov had formed the UDMF consisting of several thousand Russian fighters, and he was receptive to Allied overtures to depose the Soviet government. Lockhart, Reilly, and others then contacted anti-Bolshevik groups linked to Savinkov and Socialist Revolutionary Party cells affiliated with Savinkov&#x27;s friend Maximilian Filonenko. Lockhart and Reilly supported these factions with SIS funds. They also liaised with DeWitt Clinton Poole and Fernand Grenard, the Consuls-General of the United States and France respectively. They also coordinated their activities with intelligence operatives affiliated with the French and U.S. consuls in Moscow.

=== Planning a coup ===
In June, disillusioned elements of Colonel Eduard Berzin&#x27;s Latvian Rifle Division (&quot;Latdiviziya&quot;) began appearing in anti-Bolshevik circles in Petrograd. They were eventually directed to a British naval attaché Captain Francis Cromie and his assistant, Mr. Constantine, a Turkish merchant who was actually Reilly. In contrast to his previous espionage operations, which had been independent of other agents, Reilly worked closely while in Petrograd with Cromie in joint efforts to recruit Berzin&#x27;s Latvians and to equip anti-Bolshevik armed forces. At the time, Cromie purportedly represented the British Naval Intelligence Division and oversaw its operations in northern Russia. Cromie operated in loose coordination with the ineffectual Commander Ernest Boyce, the MI1(c) station chief in Petrograd.

As Berzin&#x27;s Latvians were deemed the Praetorian Guard of the Bolsheviks and entrusted with the security of both Lenin and the Kremlin, the Allied plotters believed their participation in the pending coup to be vital. With the aid of the Latvian Riflemen, the Allied agents hoped to &quot;seize both Lenin and Trotsky at a meeting to take place in the first week of September&quot;.

Reilly arranged a meeting between Lockhart and the Latvians at the British mission in Moscow while purportedly expending &quot;over a million rubles&quot; to bribe the Red Army troops guarding the Kremlin. At this stage, Cromie, Boyce, Reilly, Lockhart, and other Allied agents allegedly planned a full-scale coup against the Bolshevik government and drew up a list of Soviet military leaders ready to assume responsibilities on its demise. Their objective was to capture or kill Lenin and Trotsky, to establish a provisional government, and to extinguish Bolshevism. Lenin and Trotsky, they reasoned, &quot;&quot;were&quot; Bolshevism&quot;, and nothing else in their movement had &quot;substance or permanence&quot;. Consequently, &quot;if he could get them into [their] hands there would be nothing of consequence left of Sovietism&quot;.

As Lockhart&#x27;s diplomatic status hindered his open engagement in clandestine activities, he chose to supervise such activities from afar and delegate the coup&#x27;s actual direction to Reilly. To facilitate this work, Reilly allegedly obtained a position as a sinecure within the criminal branch of the Petrograd Cheka. It was during this chaotic time of plots and counter-plots that Reilly and Lockhart became further acquainted. Lockhart later posthumously described him as &quot;a man of great energy and personal charm, very attractive to women and very ambitious. I had not a very high opinion of his intelligence. His knowledge covered many subjects, from politics to art, but it was superficial. On the other hand, his courage and indifference to danger were superb.&quot; Throughout their backroom intrigues in Moscow, Lockhart never openly questioned Reilly&#x27;s loyalty to the Allies, although he privately wondered if Reilly had made a secret bargain with Colonel Berzin and his Latvian Riflemen to later seize power for themselves.

In Lockhart&#x27;s estimation, Reilly was a limitless &quot;man cast in the Napoleonic mould&quot; and, if their counter-revolutionary coup had succeeded, &quot;the prospect of playing a lone hand [using Berzin&#x27;s Latvian Riflemen] may have inspired him with a Napoleonic design&quot; to become the head of any new government. However, unbeknownst to the Allied conspirators, Berzin was &quot;an honest commander&quot; and &quot;devoted to the Soviet government&quot;. Although not a Chekist, he nonetheless informed Dzerzhinsky&#x27;s Cheka that Reilly had approached him and that Allied agents had attempted to recruit him into a possible coup. This information did not surprise Dzerzhinsky as the Cheka had gained access to the British diplomatic codes in May and were closely monitoring the anti-Bolshevik activities. Dzerzhinsky instructed Berzin and other Latvian officers to pretend to be receptive to the Allied plotters and to meticulously report on every detail of their pending operation.

=== Plot unravels ===
While Allied agents militated against the Soviet regime in Petrograd and Moscow, persistent rumours swirled of an impending Allied military intervention in Russia, which would overthrow the fledgling Soviet government in favour of a new regime willing to rejoin the ongoing war against the Central Powers. On 4 August 1918, an Allied force landed at Arkhangelsk, Russia, beginning a famous military expedition dubbed Operation Archangel. Its professed objective was to prevent the German Empire from obtaining Allied military supplies stored in the region. In retaliation for this incursion, the Bolsheviks raided the British diplomatic mission on 5 August, disrupting a meeting Reilly had arranged between the anti-Bolshevik Latvians, UDMF officials, and Lockhart. Unperturbed by these raids, Reilly conducted meetings on 17 August 1918 between Latvian regimental leaders and liaised with Captain George Alexander Hill, a multilingual British agent operating in Russia on behalf of the Military Intelligence Directorate.

Hill later described Reilly as &quot;a dark, well-groomed, very foreign-looking man&quot; who had &quot;an amazing grasp of the actualities of the situation&quot; and was &quot;a man of action&quot;. They agreed the coup would occur in the first week of September during a meeting of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars and the Moscow Soviet at the Bolshoi Theatre. On 25 August, yet another meeting of Allied conspirators allegedly occurred at DeWitt C. Poole&#x27;s American Consulate in Moscow. By this time, the Allied conspirators had organised a broad network of agents and saboteurs throughout Soviet Russia whose overarching ambition was to disrupt the nation&#x27;s food supplies. Coupled with the planned military uprising in Moscow, they believed a chronic food shortage would trigger popular unrest and further undermine the Soviet authorities. In turn, the Soviets would be overthrown by a new government friendly to the Allied Powers, which would renew hostilities against Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s German Reich. On 28 August, Reilly informed Hill that he was immediately leaving Moscow for Petrograd, where he would discuss final details related to the coup with Commander Francis Cromie at the British consulate. That night, Reilly had no difficulty in travelling through picket lines between Moscow and Petrograd due to his identification as a member of the Petrograd Cheka and his possession of Cheka travel permits.

On 30 August, Boris Savinkov and Maximilian Filonenko ordered a military cadet named Leonid Kannegisser—Filonenko&#x27;s cousin—to shoot and kill Moisei Uritsky, head of the Petrograd Cheka. Uritsky had been the second most powerful man in the city after Grigory Zinoviev, the leader of the Petrograd Soviet, and his murder was seen as a blow to both the Cheka and the entire Bolshevik leadership. After killing Uritsky, a panicked Kannegisser sought refuge either at the English Club or at the British mission where Cromie resided and where Savinkov and Filonenko may have been temporarily in hiding. Regardless of whether he fled to the English Club or the British consulate, Kannegisser was compelled to leave the premises. After donning a long overcoat, he fled into the city streets, where he was apprehended by Red Guards after a violent shootout.

On the same day, Fanya Kaplan—a former anarchist who was now a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party—shot and wounded Lenin as he departed the Michelson arms factory in Moscow. As Lenin exited the building and before he entered his motor car, Kaplan called out to him. When Lenin turned towards her, she fired three shots with a Browning pistol. One bullet narrowly missed Lenin&#x27;s heart and penetrated his lung, while the other bullet lodged in his neck near the jugular vein. 

Due to the severity of his wounds, Lenin was not expected to survive. The attack was widely covered in the Russian press, generating much sympathy for Lenin and boosting his popularity. As a consequence of this assassination attempt, however, the meeting between Lenin and Trotsky—where the bribed soldiery would seize them on behalf of the Allies—was postponed. At this point, Reilly was notified by fellow conspirator Alexander Grammatikov that &quot;the [Socialist Revolutionary Party] fools have struck too early&quot;.

=== Chekist reprisal ===

Although it is unknown if Kaplan either was part of the Ambassadors&#x27; Plot or was even responsible for the assassination attempt on Lenin, Dzerzhinsky&#x27;s Cheka used the murder of Uritsky and the failed assassination of Lenin to implicate any malcontents and foreigners in a grand conspiracy that warranted a full-scale reprisal campaign: the &quot;Red Terror&quot;. Thousands of political opponents were seized and &quot;mass executions took place across the city, at Khodynskoe field, Petrovsky Park and the Butyrki prison, all in the north of the city, as well as in the Cheka headquarters at Lubyanka&quot;. The extent of the Chekist reprisal likely foiled much of the inchoate plans by Cromie, Boyce, Lockhart, Reilly, Savinkov, Filonenko, and other conspirators.

Using lists supplied by undercover agents, the Cheka proceeded to clear out the &quot;nests of conspirators&quot; in the foreign embassies, and in doing so, they arrested key figures vital to the impending coup. On 31 August 1918, believing Savinkov and Filonenko were hiding in the British consulate, a Cheka detachment raided the British consulate in Petrograd and killed Cromie who put up an armed resistance. Immediately prior to his death, it is possible that Cromie may have been trying to communicate with other conspirators and to give instructions to accelerate their planned coup. Before the Cheka detachment stormed the consulate, Cromie burned key correspondence pertaining to the coup.

According to press reports, he made a valiant last stand on the first floor of the consulate armed only with a revolver. In close-quarters combat, he dispatched three Chekist soldiers before he was, in turn, killed and his corpse mutilated. Eyewitnesses, such as the sister-in-law of Red Cross nurse Mary Britnieva, asserted that Cromie was shot by the Cheka while retreating down the consulate&#x27;s grand staircase. The Cheka detachment searched the building and, with their rifle butts, repelled the diplomatic staff from getting close to the corpse of Captain Cromie, which the Chekist soldiers had looted and trampled. The Cheka detachment then arrested over forty persons who had sought refuge within the British consulate, as well as seizing weapon caches and compromising documents which they claimed implicated the consular staff in the forthcoming coup attempt. Cromie&#x27;s death was publicly &quot;depicted as a measure of self-defence by the Bolshevik agents, who had been forced to return his fire&quot;.
Meanwhile, Lockhart was arrested by Dzerzhinsky&#x27;s Cheka and transported under guard to Lubyanka Prison. During a tense interview with a pistol-wielding Cheka officer, he was asked &quot;Do you know the Kaplan woman?&quot; and &quot;Where is Reilly?&quot; When queried about the coup, Lockhart and other British nationals dismissed the mere idea as nonsense. Afterwards, Lockhart was placed in the same holding cell as Fanya Kaplan whom their watchful Chekist jailers hoped might betray some sign of recognizing Lockhart or other British agents. However, while confined together, Kaplan showed no sign of recognition towards Lockhart or anyone else. When it became clear that Kaplan would not implicate any accomplices, she was executed in the Kremlin&#x27;s Alexander Garden on 3 September 1918, with a bullet to the back of the head. Her corpse was bundled into a rusted iron barrel and set alight. 

Lockhart was later released and deported in exchange for Maxim Litvinov, an unofficial Soviet attaché in London who had been arrested by the British government as a form of diplomatic reprisal. In stark contrast to Lockhart&#x27;s good fortune, &quot;imprisonment, torture to compel confession, [and] death were the swift rewards of many who had been implicated&quot; in the prospective coup against Lenin&#x27;s government. Yelizaveta Otten, Reilly&#x27;s chief courier &quot;with whom he was romantically involved,&quot; was arrested as well as his other mistress Olga Starzheskaya. After interrogation, Starzheskaya was imprisoned for five years. Yet another courier, Mariya Fride, likewise was arrested at Otten&#x27;s flat with an intelligence communiqué that she was carrying for Reilly.

=== Escape from Russia ===

On 3 September 1918, the &quot;Pravda&quot; and &quot;Izvestiya&quot; newspapers sensationalised the aborted coup on their front pages. Outraged headlines denounced the Allied representatives and other foreigners in Moscow as &quot;Anglo-French Bandits&quot;. The papers arrogated credit for the coup to Reilly, and when he was identified as a key suspect, a dragnet ensued. Reilly &quot;was hunted through days and nights as he had never been hunted before,&quot; and &quot;his photograph with a full description and a reward was placarded&quot; throughout the area. The Cheka raided his assumed refuge, but the elusive Reilly avoided capture and met Captain Hill while in hiding. Hill later wrote that Reilly, despite narrowly escaping his pursuers in both Moscow and Petrograd, &quot;was absolutely cool, calm and collected, not in the least downhearted and only concerned in gathering together the broken threads and starting afresh&quot;.

Hill proposed that Reilly escape from Russia via Ukraine to Baku using their network of British agents for safe houses and assistance. However, Reilly instead chose a shorter, more dangerous route north through Petrograd and the Baltic Provinces to Finland to get their reports to London as early as possible. With the Cheka closing in, Reilly, carrying a Baltic German passport supplied by Hill, posed as a legation secretary and departed the region in a railway car reserved for the German Embassy. In Kronstadt, Reilly sailed by ship to Helsinki and reached Stockholm with the aid of local Baltic smugglers. He arrived unscathed in London on 8 November.

While safely in England, Reilly, Lockhart and other agents were tried &quot;in absentia&quot; before the Supreme Revolutionary Tribunal in a proceeding which opened on 25 November 1918. Approximately twenty defendants faced charges in the trial, most of whom had worked for the Americans or the British in Moscow. The case was prosecuted by Nikolai Krylenko, an exponent of the theory that political considerations rather than criminal guilt should decide a case&#x27;s outcome.

Krylenko&#x27;s case concluded on 3 December 1918, with two defendants sentenced to be shot and various others sentenced to terms of prison or forced labour for terms up to five years. Thus, the day before Reilly met Sir Mansfield Smith-Cumming (&quot;C&quot;) in London for debriefing, the Russian &quot;Izvestia&quot; newspaper reported that both Reilly and Lockhart had been sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; by a Revolutionary Tribunal for their roles in the attempted coup of the Bolshevik government. The sentence was to be carried out immediately should either of them be apprehended on Soviet soil. This sentence would later be served on Reilly when he was caught by Dzerzhinsky&#x27;s OGPU in 1925.

== Activities from 1919 to 1924 ==
=== Russian Civil War ===

Within a week of their return debriefing, the British Secret Intelligence Service and the Foreign Office again sent Reilly and Hill to South Russia under the cover of British trade delegates. Their assignment was to uncover information about the Black Sea coast needed for the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. At that time, the region was inhabited by several anti-Bolshevik groups. They travelled in the guise of British merchants, with appropriate credentials provided by the Department of Overseas Trade. Over the next six weeks or so, Reilly prepared twelve dispatches that reported on various aspects of the situation in South Russia and were delivered personally by Hill to the Foreign Office in London.

Reilly identified four principal factors in the affairs of South Russia at this time: the Volunteer Army, the territorial or provincial governments in the Kuban, Don, and Crimea, the Petlyura movement in Ukraine, and the economic situation. In his opinion, the future course of events in this region would depend not only on the interaction of these factors with each other but &quot;above all upon Allied attitude towards them&quot;. Reilly advocated Allied assistance to organise South Russia into a suitable &quot;place d&#x27;armes&quot; for a decisive advance against Petlurism and Bolshevism. In his opinion: &quot;The military Allied assistance required for this would be comparatively small as proved by recent events in Odessa. Landing parties in the ports and detachments assisting Volunteer Army on lines of communication would probably be sufficient.&quot;

Reilly&#x27;s reference to events in Odessa concerned the successful landing there on 18 December 1918 of troops from the French 156th Division commanded by General Borius, who managed to wrest control of the city from the Petlyurists with the assistance of a small contingent of Volunteers.

In Reilly&#x27;s estimation, as urgent as the need for Allied military assistance to the Volunteer Army was, he regarded economic assistance for South Russia as &quot;even more pressing&quot;. Manufactured goods were so scarce in this region that he considered any moderate contribution from the Allies would have a most beneficial effect. Apart from echoing a suggestion made by General Poole for a British or Anglo-French Commission to control merchant shipping engaged in trading activities in the Black Sea, Reilly did not offer any solutions to what he called a state of &quot;general economic chaos&quot; in South Russia. Reilly found White officials, who had been given the job of helping the Russian economy get better, &quot;helpless&quot; in coming to terms with &quot;the colossal disaster which has overtaken Russia&#x27;s finances, ... and unable to frame anything, approaching even an outline, of a financial policy&quot;. But he supported their request for the Allies to print &quot;500 Million roubles of Nicholas money of all denominations&quot; for the Special Council as a matter of urgency, with the justification that &quot;although one realises the fundamental futility of this remedy, one must agree with them that for the moment this is the only remedy&quot;. Lack of funds was one reason offered by Reilly to explain the Whites&#x27; blatant inactivity in the propaganda field. They were also reported to be lacking paper and printing presses necessary for producing propaganda material. Reilly claimed that the Special Council had fully recognized the advantages of propaganda.

=== Final marriage ===

While on a visit to postwar Berlin in December 1922, Reilly met a charming young actress named Pepita Bobadilla in the Hotel Adlon. Bobadilla was an attractive blonde who falsely claimed to be from South America. Her real name was Nelly Burton, and she was the widow of Charles Haddon Chambers, a well-known British playwright. For the past several years, Bobadilla has gained notoriety both as Chambers&#x27; wife and for her stage career as a dancer. 

On 18 May 1923, after a whirlwind romance, Bobadilla married Reilly at a civil Registry Office on Henrietta Street, in Covent Garden, Central London, with Captain Hill acting as a witness. As Reilly was already married at the time, their union was bigamous. 

Bobadilla later described Reilly as a sombre individual and found it strange that he never entertained guests at their home. Except for two or three acquaintances, hardly anyone could boast of being his friend. Nevertheless, their marriage was reportedly happy as Bobadilla believed Reilly to be &quot;romantic&quot;, &quot;a good companion&quot;, &quot;a man of infinite courage&quot;, and &quot;the ideal husband&quot;. Their union would last merely 30 months before Reilly&#x27;s disappearance in Russia and his execution by the Soviet OGPU.

=== Zinoviev scandal ===
One year later Reilly was involved—possibly alongside Sir Stewart Graham Menzies—in the Zinoviev letter scandal. Four days before the British general election on 8 October 1924, a Tory newspaper printed a letter purporting to originate from Grigory Zinoviev, head of the Third Communist International. The letter claimed that the planned resumption of diplomatic and trade relations by the Labour party with Soviet Russia would indirectly hasten the overthrow of the British government. Hours later, the British Foreign Office responded to the letter with a note of protest to the Soviet government. Soviet Russia and British Communists denounced the letter as a forgery by British intelligence agents, while Conservative politicians and newspapers maintained that it was genuine. Recent scholarship suggests that the letter was a forgery.

Amid the uproar following the printing of the letter and the Foreign Office protest, Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s Labour Government lost the general election. According to Samuel T. Williamson, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1926, Reilly may have served as a courier to transport the forged Zinoviev letter into the United Kingdom. Reflecting upon these events, the journalist Winfried Lüdecke posited in 1929 that Reilly&#x27;s role in &quot;the famous Zinoviev letter assumed a world-wide political importance, for its publication in the British press brought about the fall of the [Ramsay] Macdonald ministry, frustrated the realisation of the proposed Anglo-Russian commercial treaty, and, as a final result, led to the signing of the treaties of Locarno, in virtue of which the other states of Europe presented, under the leadership of Britain, a united front against Soviet Russia&quot;.

== Career with British intelligence ==

Throughout his life, Reilly maintained a close yet tempestuous relationship with the British intelligence community. In 1896, he was recruited by Superintendent William Melville for the émigré intelligence network of Scotland Yard&#x27;s Special Branch. Through his close relationship with Melville, Reilly would be employed as a secret agent for the Secret Service Bureau, which the Foreign Office created in October 1909. In 1918, Reilly began to work for MI1(c), an early designation for the British Secret Intelligence Service, under Sir Mansfield Smith-Cumming. He was allegedly trained by the latter organisation and sent to Moscow in March 1918 to assassinate Vladimir Ilyich Lenin or attempt to overthrow the Bolsheviks. He had to escape after the Cheka unraveled the so-called Lockhart Plot against the Bolshevik government. Later biographies contain numerous tales about his espionage deeds. It has been claimed that:

* In the Boer War, he masqueraded as a Russian arms merchant to spy on Dutch weapons shipments to the Boers.
* He obtained intelligence on Russian military defences in Manchuria for the Kempeitai, the Japanese secret police.
* He procured Persian oil concessions for the British Admiralty in events surrounding the D&#x27;Arcy Concession.
* He infiltrated a Krupp armaments plant in prewar Germany and stole weapon plans for the Entente Powers.
* He seduced the wife of a Russian minister to glean information about German weapons shipments to Russia.
* He participated in missions of so-called &quot;German sabotage&quot; designed to draw the United States into World War I.
* He attempted to overthrow the Russian Bolshevik government and to rescue the imprisoned Romanov family.
* Prior to his demise, he served as a courier to transport the forged Zinoviev letter into the United Kingdom.

British intelligence adhered to its policy of publicly saying nothing about anything. Yet Reilly&#x27;s espionage successes did garner indirect recognition. After a formal recommendation by Sir Mansfield &quot;C&quot; Smith-Cumming, Reilly, who had received a military commission in 1917, was awarded the Military Cross on 22 January 1919 &quot;for distinguished services rendered in connection with military operations in the field&quot;. This vaguely-worded citation misled later biographers such as Richard Deacon to wrongly conclude that Reilly&#x27;s medal was bestowed for valorous military feats against the Imperial German Army during the Great War of 1914–1918; however, most later biographers agree the medal was bestowed due to Reilly&#x27;s anti-Bolshevik operations in southern Russia.

Reilly&#x27;s most sceptical biographer, Andrew Cook, asserts that Reilly&#x27;s SIS-specific career has been greatly embellished as he wasn&#x27;t accepted as an agent until 15 March 1918. He was then discharged in 1921 because of his tendency to be a rogue operative. Nevertheless, Cook concedes that Reilly previously had been a renowned operative for Scotland Yard&#x27;s Special Branch and the Secret Service Bureau which were the early forerunners of the British intelligence community. Historian Christopher Andrew, a professor at the University of Cambridge with a focus on the history of the intelligence services, described Reilly&#x27;s secret service career overall as &quot;remarkable, though largely ineffective&quot;.

== Execution ==
According to Reilly&#x27;s wife, Pepita Bobadilla, Reilly was perpetually determined &quot;to return to Russia to see if he could not find and succour some of his friends he believed to be still alive. This he did in 1925—and never came back.&quot; In September 1925 in Paris, Reilly met Alexander Grammatikov, White Russian General Alexander Kutepov, counter-espionage expert Vladimir Burtsev, and Commander Ernest Boyce from British Intelligence. This assembly discussed how they could make contact with a supposedly pro-Monarchist, anti-Bolshevik organisation known as &quot;The Trust&quot; in Moscow. The assembly agreed that Reilly should journey to Finland to explore the feasibility of yet another uprising in Russia using The Trust apparatus. However, in reality The Trust was an elaborate counter-espionage deception created by the OGPU, the intelligence successor of the Cheka.

Thus, undercover agents of the OGPU lured Reilly into Bolshevik Russia, ostensibly to meet with supposed anti-Communist revolutionaries. At the Soviet-Finnish border, Reilly was introduced to undercover OGPU agents who posed as senior Trust representatives from Moscow. One of these undercover Soviet agents, Alexander Alexandrovich Yakushev, later recalled the meeting:

Reilly was brought across the border by Toivo Vähä, a former Finnish Red Guard fighter who now served the OGPU. Vähä took Reilly over the Sestra River to the Soviet side and handed him to the OGPU officers. (In the 1973 book &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;, Russian novelist and historian Alexandr Solzhenitsyn states that Richard Ohola, a Finnish Red Guard, was &quot;a participant in the capture of British agent Sidney Reilly&quot;. In the biographical glossary appended to the latter work, Solzhenitsyn incorrectly speculates that Reilly was &quot;killed while crossing the Soviet-Finnish border.&quot;)

After Reilly crossed the Finnish border, the Soviets captured, transported and interrogated him at Lubyanka Prison. On arrival Reilly was taken to the office of Roman Pilar, a Soviet official who had arrested and ordered the execution of a close friend of Reilly, Boris Savinkov, the previous year; Reilly was reminded of his own death sentence by a 1918 Soviet tribunal for participation in a counter-revolutionary plot against the Bolshevik government. While Reilly was being interrogated, the Soviets publicly claimed that he had been shot trying to cross the Finnish border. Whether Reilly was tortured while in OGPU custody is a matter of debate by historians; Cook contends that Reilly was not tortured other than psychologically, through mock executions designed to shake the resolve of prisoners.
During OGPU interrogation, Reilly prevaricated about his personal background and maintained his charade of being a British subject born in Clonmel, Ireland. Although he did not abjure his allegiance to the United Kingdom, he also did not reveal any intelligence matters. While facing such daily interrogation, Reilly kept a diary in his cell of tiny handwritten notes on cigarette papers, which he hid in the plasterwork of a cell wall. While his Soviet captors were interrogating Reilly, he, in turn, was analysing and documenting their techniques. The diary contained a detailed record of OGPU interrogation techniques, and Reilly was understandably confident that such unique documentation would, if he escaped, be of interest to the British SIS. After Reilly&#x27;s death, Soviet guards discovered the diary in Reilly&#x27;s cell, and photographic enhancements were made by OGPU technicians.

Reilly was executed in a forest near Moscow on Thursday, 5 November 1925. Eyewitness Boris Gudz claimed the execution was supervised by an OGPU officer, Grigory Feduleev, while another OGPU officer, Grigory Syroezhkin, fired the final shot into Reilly&#x27;s chest. Gudz also confirmed that the order to kill Reilly came from Stalin directly. Within months after his execution, various outlets of the British and American press carried an obituary notice: &quot;REILLY—On the 28th of September, killed near the village of Allekul, Russia, by S. R. U. Troops. Captain Sidney George Reilly, M. C., beloved husband of Pepita Reilly.&quot; Two months later, on 17 January 1926, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reprinted this obituary notice and, citing unnamed sources in the intelligence community, the paper asserted that Reilly had been somehow involved in the still ongoing scandal of the &quot;Zinoviev letter&quot;, a fraudulent document published by the British &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper a year prior during the general election in 1924.

After Reilly&#x27;s death, there were various rumours about his survival; Reilly&#x27;s wife, Pepita Bobadilla, claimed to possess evidence indicating that Reilly was still alive as late as 1932. Others speculated that the unscrupulous Reilly had defected to the opposition, becoming an adviser to Soviet intelligence. Despite such unfavourable rumours the international press quickly turned Reilly into a household name, lauding him as a masterful spy and chronicling his many espionage adventures with numerous embellishments. Contemporary newspapers dubbed him &quot;the greatest spy in history&quot; and &quot;the Scarlet Pimpernel of Red Russia&quot;. In May 1931, The &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; published an illustrated serial headlined &quot;Master Spy&quot;, which sensationalised his many exploits as well as outright invented others..

== Fictional portrayals ==
=== Soviet cinema ===
As one of the principal suspects in the Ambassador&#x27;s Plot and a key figure in the counter-revolutionary activities of White Russian émigrés, Reilly accordingly became a recurring villain in Soviet cinema. In the latter half of the 20th century, he frequently appeared as a historical character in films and television shows produced by the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries. He was portrayed by many different actors of various nationalities, including: Vadim Medvedev in &quot;The Conspiracy of Ambassadors&quot; (&quot;Zagovor Poslov&quot;) (1966); Vsevolod Yakut in &quot;Operation Trust&quot; (&quot;Operatsiya Trest&quot;) (1968); Aleksandr Shirvindt in &quot;Crash&quot; (&quot;Krakh&quot;) (1969); Vladimir Tatosov in &quot;Trust&quot; (1976), Sergei Yursky in &quot;Coasts in the Mist&quot; (&quot;Mglistye Berega&quot;) (1986), and Harijs Liepins in &quot;Syndicate II&quot; (&quot;Sindikat-2&quot;) (1981).

=== &quot;Reilly: Ace of Spies&quot; ===

In 1983, a Thames Television miniseries, &quot;Reilly, Ace of Spies&quot;, dramatised the historical adventures of Reilly. Directed by Martin Campbell and Jim Goddard, the series was based on Robin Bruce Lockhart&#x27;s book, &quot;Ace of Spies&quot;, which was adapted by Troy Kennedy Martin. The programme won the 1984 BAFTA TV Award. Reilly was portrayed by actor Sam Neill, who was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for his performance. Leo McKern portrayed Sir Basil Zaharoff. 

In a review of the programme, Michael Billington of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;pinning Reilly down in 12 hours of television is difficult precisely because he was such an enigma: an alleged radical, yet one who helped to bring down Britain&#x27;s first Labour government in 1924 by means of a forged letter, supposedly from the Bolshevik leader Grigory Zinoviev, instructing the British Communists to form cells in the armed forces; a Lothario and two-time bigamist who was yet never betrayed by any of the women he was involved with; an avid collector of Napoleona who wanted to be the power behind the throne rather than to rule himself.&quot;

=== James Bond ===
In &quot;Ian Fleming, The Man Behind James Bond&quot; by Andrew Lycett, Reilly is listed as an inspiration for James Bond. Reilly&#x27;s friend, former diplomat and journalist Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart, was a close acquaintance of Ian Fleming for many years and recounted to Fleming many of Reilly&#x27;s espionage adventures. Lockhart had worked with Reilly in Russia in 1918, where they became embroiled in an SIS-backed plot to overthrow Lenin&#x27;s Bolshevik government.

Within five years of his disappearance in Soviet Russia in 1925, the press had turned Reilly into a household name, lauding him as a master spy and recounting his many espionage adventures. Fleming had, therefore, long been aware of Reilly&#x27;s mythical reputation and had listened to Lockhart&#x27;s recollections. Like Fleming&#x27;s fictional creation, Reilly was multi-lingual, fascinated by the Far East, fond of fine living, and a compulsive gambler. When queried on whether Reilly&#x27;s colourful life had directly inspired Bond, Ian Fleming replied: &quot;James Bond is just a piece of nonsense I dreamed up. He&#x27;s not a Sidney Reilly, you know.&quot;

=== &quot;The Gadfly&quot; ===
In 1895, Reilly encountered author Ethel Lilian Voynich, née Boole. Boole was a well-known figure in the late Victorian literary scene and later married to Polish revolutionary Wilfrid Voynich. She and Reilly had a sexual liaison in Italy together. During their affair, Reilly supposedly &quot;bared his soul&quot; to Ethel and revealed to her the peculiar story of his revolutionary past in the Russian Empire. After their affair had concluded, Voynich published in 1897 &quot;The Gadfly&quot;, a critically acclaimed historical novel set in Italy under Austrian rule in the 1840s, whose central character is allegedly based on Reilly&#x27;s early life. Alternatively, Reilly modelled himself on the revolutionary hero of Voynich&#x27;s novel, although historian Mark Mazower observed that &quot;separating fact from fantasy in the case of Reilly is difficult&quot;. For years, the existence of this purported relationship was doubted by sceptical historians until confirmed by new evidence in 2016. Archived communication between Anne Fremantle—who attempted a biography of Ethel Voynich—and a relative of Ethel&#x27;s on the Hinton side demonstrates that a liaison did occur. The theme music for the 1983 television mini-series is based on the “Romance” movement of &quot;The Gadfly Suite&quot; (Op. 97a), Levon Atovmian’s arrangement of Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s music for the 1955 Soviet film adaptation of the novel.

<text>Kindred of the East is a tabletop role-playing game book and game line released by White Wolf Publishing in February 1998 for use with their horror game &quot;&quot;. It is part of the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; series, and is the first and main entry in the &quot;Year of the Lotus&quot; line of Asia-themed books released throughout 1998.

The book covers Asia as it is portrayed in the series&#x27; setting, with a focus on China, and introduces Asian vampires called kuei-jin as player characters. These subsist on &quot;chi&quot;, and are created from humans who have done evil during their lives and return to their bodies after death. Following paths of enlightenment in the hopes of attaining a higher state of being, they participate in kuei-jin courts and oppose the demonic Yama Kings who are anticipated to rule the world in the coming sixth age.

The game was designed by Robert Hatch, with art direction by Lawrence Snelly, who took visual inspiration from manga. It was supported by a line of supplementary books which further describe kuei-jin society and paths, and was adapted into other media including a short story, comics, and a live-action role-playing game; the kuei-jin were also featured in the video game &quot;&quot; in 2004. &quot;Kindred of the East&quot; was generally well received by critics, who liked its gameplay, setting, mood, and artwork, but was criticized as portraying Asian people and cultures in a stereotypical way.

==Overview==
&quot;Kindred of the East&quot; is a major rulebook and game line for the tabletop role-playing game &quot;&quot;, where players take the roles of vampires. It covers Asia as it is portrayed in the setting – primarily China – and introduces Asian vampires called kuei-jin or &quot;the hungry dead&quot;. While still undead, they differ from the vampires of &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot;: they do not originate from the biblical Caine – who in the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; series is reinterpreted as the first vampire – and were instead originally created by the divine August Personage of Jade during the second age, chosen from the most virtuous humans. Their purpose was to protect humanity from the Yama Kings and their demonic followers, but during the third age, they discovered that they could not only sustain themselves through the vital essence (&quot;chi&quot;) of the world, but also through &quot;chi&quot; stolen from living beings. As punishment, the August Personage of Jade returned them to their dead bodies from their mortal lives and cut them off from the &quot;chi&quot; of the world, forcing them to survive on stolen &quot;chi&quot;.

The game is primarily set during the fifth age, in modern times, after the August Personage of Jade has turned away from the world. New kuei-jin are still created – referred to as attaining the second breath – but only from humans who have done evil and are weighed by karmic debts during their lives, and who crawl back from hell. Sometimes they return to someone else&#x27;s dead body rather than their own, but a new kuei-jin does in any case begin as a zombie-like &quot;chih-mei&quot;, whose mind is clouded by a hunger for &quot;chi&quot; and who attacks mortals for it until taken in and taught to control themselves by an older kuei-jin.

Led by a storyteller, players create and take the roles of newly-made kuei-jin, and role-play actions whose outcomes are in part determined through character attributes and rolling of dice. The player characters undergo training by the character who saved them from their &quot;chih-mei&quot; state, and learn about existence as a kuei-jin and their society. After this, they can be introduced to a kuei-jin court – their primary social group – and become part of a blood family (&quot;wu&quot;), which typically is made up of the players&#x27; characters. Kuei-jin follow one of several philosophical paths called dharmas, and the progression thereof is measured in levels, which affect the character&#x27;s powers and their place in society; their ultimate goal is progressing through their dharma and attaining enlightenment and a higher state of being. The dharmas are based on different virtues, and a character must try to maintain the right balance between yin and yang, and between their rational mind (&quot;hun&quot;) and the evil spirit they carry within (&quot;p&#x27;o&quot;), to make progress: these include the Devil-Tiger dharma, based on &quot;p&#x27;o&quot;; Resplendent Crane, based on &quot;hun&quot;; Song of the Shadow, based on yin; Thrashing Dragon, based on yang; and Thousand Whispers, based on balance.

Kuei-jin need to absorb &quot;chi&quot; to survive, which for young kuei-jin often is done by drinking mortals&#x27; blood, whereas older kuei-jin may draw it from the environment. Absorbed &quot;chi&quot; is distilled into black and scarlet varieties, respectively linked to yin and death, and to yang and life. These can be used to fuel various supernatural powers called disciplines, such as fire-breathing, phasing through walls, or flying, which are powerful but affect the &quot;chi&quot; flow of the environment, and are thus detectable by other kuei-jin. A character&#x27;s balance between black and scarlet &quot;chi&quot; will also affect their disposition and appearance. In addition to the Yama Kings and their followers, who are anticipated to rule the world in the coming sixth age, the antagonists and rivals of the game include kuei-jin following heretical dharmas, Cainite vampires, &quot;hengeyokai&quot; shapeshifters, &quot;hsien&quot; changelings, ghosts, and demon hunters.

==Production and release==
&quot;Kindred of the East&quot; was designed by Robert Hatch, with additional design by Phil Brucato, Jackie Cassada, Mark Cenczyk, and Nicky Rea. It was made after the publisher had kept details on Asian vampires vague since the series began with &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; in 1991, having only discussed them as the Cainite bloodlines Gaki and Bushi, which after &quot;Kindred of the East&quot; were written out of the continuity. The game was written with suggested themes including balance versus imbalance, tradition versus new ways of thinking, the group versus the individual, east versus west, hierarchy, and redemption versus damnation. The lore of &quot;Kindred of the East&quot; was initially intended to be compatible with &quot;Exalted&quot;, another of White Wolf Publishing&#x27;s role-playing games, but the two ended up diverging. The art team included art director and cover artist Lawrence Snelly, logo designer Ash Arnett, calligraphy artist Andy Lee, and several interior artists, who among other sources drew inspiration from manga.

After a delay from November 1997, &quot;Kindred of the East&quot; was published by White Wolf Publishing in February 1998 as the first and main entry in their &quot;Year of the Lotus&quot; line of Asia-themed &quot;World of Darkness&quot; books, which introduced Asian supernatural beings to the games in the series, including &quot;Hengeyokai: Shapeshifters of the East&quot; for &quot;&quot; and &quot;Land of Eight Million Dreams&quot; for &quot;&quot;. &quot;Kindred of the East&quot; was based on &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot;, and was published as a supplement that requires the &quot;Vampire&quot; rulebook to be played, following the model of the publisher&#x27;s &quot;&quot; from the year prior. This was done as the game could attract attention in the same way as a new, standalone game, while not being the start of a new line that would require further publisher support.

Despite this, the game did receive its own line of supplements, starting with the &quot;Kindred of the East Companion&quot; book in 1999, which updates the game to bring it in line with the rules of the 1998 &quot;Revised Edition&quot; of &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot;, as well as further detailing kuei-jin society and adding new gameplay mechanics and background information. The game was also released in other languages, including Brazilian Portuguese, French, Polish, and Spanish. White Wolf Publishing eventually ended the &quot;Kindred of the East&quot; narrative in 2004 as part of the &quot;Time of Judgment&quot; event – a finale to the &quot;World of Darkness&quot; series – with adventures published in the book &quot;World of Darkness: Time of Judgment&quot;. Bruce Baugh, one of the writers on the &quot;Kindred of the East&quot; line, later said that if he had been able to write one more &quot;World of Darkness&quot; book, it may have been one expanding the &quot;Kindred of the East&quot; cosmology to make the second breath happen not only to Asian characters. In 2019, White Wolf Publishing retrospectively described &quot;Kindred of the East&quot; as written from a very Western perspective, and urged people making fan works based on it to be conscious of orientalism and essentialism.

==Reception==
&quot;Kindred of the East&quot; and its supplements were critically well received at release: &quot;Dosdediez&quot;, &quot;Dragão Brasil&quot;, and &quot;Dragon&quot; called it among their favorite &quot;World of Darkness&quot; games; &quot;Casus Belli&quot; called it an excellent game that shows the publisher at its best; and &quot;Poltergeist&quot; recommended it to anyone who wants to play an urban-fantasy role-playing game set in Asia. Retrospectively, &quot;Backstab&quot; compared it favorably to &quot;Kindred of the Ebony Kingdom&quot;, a 2003 &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; supplement about African vampires.
Critics generally liked the gameplay mechanics, with &quot;Backstab&quot; much preferring them to those of &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot;, although conceding that they were a bit complicated to use; &quot;Magia i Miecz&quot; thought that the game may require some modifications to simplify the rules. &quot;Dosdediez&quot; liked the &quot;chi&quot; mechanics for adding a unique flavor and opening up possibilities, while &quot;Poltergeist&quot; considered the risk of using &quot;p&#x27;o&quot; disciplines so unbalanced that they never feel worth using, the dharmas&#x27; descriptions too brief to role-play as characters following them, and the &quot;p&#x27;o&quot; archetypes often indistinctive. &quot;Sci-Fi Universe&quot; liked the game for standing out from &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot;, finding it to facilitate many new story ideas and role-play opportunities related to intrigue and politics. &quot;Casus Belli&quot;, &quot;Dragon&quot;, and &quot;SF Site&quot; criticized the game for requiring one to learn a lot of terminology and concepts before playing, although the latter thought this was partially mitigated by &quot;Kindred of the East Companion&quot;.
The game&#x27;s mystical setting and writing were well received for their mood and atmosphere, and for feeling fresh compared to previous &quot;World of Darkness&quot; games, although &quot;Dragão Brasil&quot; did not find it dark enough for the series. &quot;Rollespilsmagasinet Fønix&quot;, while calling the setting coherent and interesting, thought it deviates far too much from what had been established in previous &quot;World of Darkness&quot; games, whereas &quot;Backstab&quot; thought it was a better game for the differences. The player characters were mostly well received at release: &quot;Dosdediez&quot; preferred them to the Cainite vampires of &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; for having higher aspirations, while &quot;Dragão Brasil&quot; considered them potentially too different, although making for interesting allies or antagonists in cross-over play with other &quot;World of Darkness&quot; games. &quot;Casus Belli&quot; agreed, and appreciated the kuei-jin&#x27;s similarities to the wraiths of &quot;&quot;, making the game feel simultaneously new and familiar.
Critics generally liked the game&#x27;s artwork and presentation, with &quot;Casus Belli&quot; calling it a beautiful and well-designed book, and &quot;Dosdediez&quot; calling it visually above average for the publisher. The layout, lettering, and printing were also generally well received, although &quot;Poltergeist&quot; criticized its use of black text on dark backgrounds, making reading at times tiring. The illustrations were well received and considered to match the standards set by previous &quot;World of Darkness&quot; games, and were described by &quot;Dragão Brasil&quot; as &quot;exceptional&quot;; &quot;Poltergeist&quot; also liked the cover art for making the game stand out.
The portrayal of Asia and Asian people in the game saw mixed responses. &quot;Sci-Fi Universe&quot; and &quot;SF Site&quot; called the game well researched and fascinating, the latter finding it a good platform for exploring Asian cultures and themes of Westernization, while &quot;Casus Belli&quot; found the descriptions of Asia lacking, and &quot;Poltergeist&quot; found it absurd to even attempt to describe China and major religions in only a few pages. &quot;Dosdediez&quot; thought it was nice to finally see coverage of Asia in &quot;World of Darkness&quot;, but found its use of stereotypes excessive, saying that if a White Wolf Publishing book set in Spain does not feature an entire cast of bullfighters, it makes little sense that meditative and spiritual martial artists would be so prevalent in &quot;Kindred of the East&quot;. &quot;Poltergeist&quot; similarly criticized the portrayal of Asian characters as excessively xenophobic, and &quot;TheGamer&quot;, describing the kuei-jin as stereotypical, wrote in 2019 that unless they were reworked, they did not expect the kuei-jin to return to the series.

===Sales===
&quot;Kindred of the East&quot; debuted as the fourth highest-selling tabletop role-playing game in France during the January–February 1998 period, and peaked at number 2 behind &quot;Deadlands&quot; in March–April 1998, before falling off the top 10 chart by July–August 1998. In Spain, it debuted as the fourth highest-selling new tabletop role-playing game in the December 1999–January 2000 period, and remained on the top 30 chart for an entire year.

==Related media==
&quot;Laws of the East&quot;, a &quot;Kindred of the East&quot; adaptation for the live-action role-playing game &quot;Mind&#x27;s Eye Theatre&quot;, was developed by Cynthia Summers and written by Peter Woodworth, and released in 2000. In 1998, video game publisher Activision acquired the rights to develop video games based on &quot;Kindred of the East&quot;, along with &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; and &quot;&quot;. The kuei-jin were eventually featured in the 2004 video game &quot;&quot;, where Ming Xiao, a kuei-jin woman controlling Los Angeles&#x27;s Chinatown, is one of the antagonists. Kuei-jin are also featured in the &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; tabletop game book &quot;Nights of Prophecy&quot; (2000), and events involving them are hinted at in &quot;Beckett&#x27;s Jyhad Diary&quot; (2018). As of &quot;Vampire: The Masquerade&quot; fifth edition (2018), they are no longer officially part of the series&#x27; setting.

Manga-inspired comics based on the game were published as part of several of the books in the game line. Kevin Andrew Murphy&#x27;s &quot;Kindred of the East&quot; short story &quot;The Lotus of Five Petals&quot; was published in 1998 as part of the fiction anthology &quot;The Quintessential World of Darkness&quot;, which was edited by Anna Branscome and Stewart Wieck.

<text>Merrill’s Marauders (named after Frank Merrill) or Unit &quot;Galahad&quot;, officially named the 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional), was a United States Army long range penetration special operations jungle warfare unit, which fought in the Southeast Asian theater of World War II, or China-Burma-India Theater (CBI). The unit became famous for its deep-penetration missions behind Japanese lines, often engaging Japanese forces superior in number.

==Formation and training==
In the Quebec Conference (QUADRANT) of August 1943, Allied leaders decided to form a U.S. deep penetration unit that would attack Japanese troops in Burma. The new U.S. force was directly inspired by, and partially modeled on Orde Wingate&#x27;s Chindits Long Range Penetration Force. A call for volunteers attracted around 3,000 men.

A Memorandum from the Operations Division (OPD) of the War Department dated 18 September 1943 (OPD 320.2) listed the proposed composition of the new American long-range penetration force, which would be an all-volunteer unit. The Caribbean Defense Command provided 960 jungle-trained officers and men, 970 jungle-trained officers and men came from Army Ground Forces (based in the Continental United States) and a further 674 &quot;battle-tested&quot; jungle troops from the South Pacific Command (Army veterans of the Guadalcanal and Solomon Islands campaigns), with all troops to assemble at Nouméa, New Caledonia. General Douglas MacArthur was also directed to transfer 274 Army combat-experienced volunteers from the Southwest Pacific Command, veterans of the New Guinea and Bougainville campaigns. A few Pacific veteran volunteers came from stockades where volunteering earned them their freedom. They were sprinkled throughout the unit and called &quot;The Dead End Kids&quot; after the Hollywood film series featuring juvenile delinquents.
The unit was officially designated as 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional) with the code name &quot;Galahad&quot;.

The men were first sent to India arriving in Bombay on 31 October 1943 to train. Here they were reinforced with Air Corps and Signal Corps personnel, as well as an animal transport company with mules and experienced muleteers. Officers and men were equipped with U.S. Herringbone Twill (HBT) uniform cotton OD uniforms, M-1943 fatigues, Type II field shoes (with or without canvas leggings), jungle boots, canvas load-bearing equipment, blanket (one-half tent or &quot;shelter-half&quot; per man), poncho, and a machete or kukri for brush clearing. Small arms included the .30-06 M1 Garand, the .30-06 M1903A4 sniper rifle, the .30 M1 carbine, the .45 Thompson submachine gun, the .45 M1911 pistol, the .30-06 BAR (M1922 machine rifle version), and the .30 M1919 Browning air-cooled belt-fed machine gun. Mules were used to haul radios, ammunition, and heavier support weapons, including the 2.36-inch M1A1 bazooka and the U.S. 60 mm M2 Mortar; the latter was often employed without its bipod in order to speed deployment.

The 5307th was originally destined to train in long-range penetration tactics under the direction of Brigadier Charles Orde Wingate, commander of the Chindits. At Deolali, 200 km (125 miles) outside Bombay, the troops endured both physical conditioning and close-order drill, before entraining for Deogarh, Madhya Pradesh.

The unit was to have 700 animals that included 360 mules. There were to be as many more but the ship that was carrying them was torpedoed in the Arabian Sea. They were replaced by 360 Australian Waler horses that had originally been with the 112th Cavalry in New Caledonia who were deemed unfit for jungle warfare. They had traveled to India where they served with the Chinese Army before being assigned to the 5307th.
From the end of November 1943 to the end of January 1944, the 5307th remained at Deogarh and trained intensively. All officers and men received instruction in scouting and patrolling, stream crossings, weapons, navigation, demolitions, camouflage, small-unit attacks on entrenchments, evacuation of wounded personnel, and the then-novel technique of supply by airdrop. Special emphasis was placed on &quot;jungle lane&quot; marksmanship at pop-up and moving targets using small arms. In December the 5307th conducted a weeklong maneuver in coordination with Chindit forces.

U.S. General Joseph Stilwell was determined that the only U.S. combat troops available in the theater would not serve under British command. As the only Allied ground commander without a subordinate contingent of infantry forces from his own army, Stilwell was aware that he would have minimal influence upon Allied ground strategy in Burma unless he could gain command of the Marauders. Admiral Lord Mountbatten, the supreme Allied commander of the South East Asia Command (SEAC), was persuaded by Stilwell, deputy supreme Allied commander, that they should serve under the Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC). 

Stilwell appointed Brigadier General Frank Merrill to command them. Several American war correspondents had come to Deogarh to hear about the unit and its training; the reporters sat around trying to think of an appealing nickname for the 5307th that would capture the interest of the American public. &quot;Time&quot; correspondent James R. Shepley came up with &quot;Merrill&#x27;s Marauders&quot; and that name stuck.

==Operations==

In early 1944, the Marauders were organized as a light infantry assault unit, with mule transport for their 60 mm mortars, bazookas, ammunition, communications gear, and supplies. Although the 5307th&#x27;s three battalions were equivalent to a regimental-size unit, its lack of organic heavy weapons support meant the force had a combat power less than that of a single regular American infantry battalion, a fact that General Stilwell and his NCAC staff did not always appreciate. Without heavy weapons support, the unit would have to rely on flexibility and surprise to outfight considerably larger Japanese forces.

A little known secret to the Marauders&#x27; success was the inclusion of fourteen Japanese-American Military Intelligence Service translators assigned to the unit, including future Army Rangers and Military Intelligence Hall of Fame inductee Roy Matsumoto.

Weight was critical to the Marauders, and the need for a compact, lightweight field ration was essential; unfortunately, the best solution, the dry Jungle ration, at 4,000 calories per day, had been discontinued for cost reasons in 1943. On the advice of Army supply officers in Washington, General Stilwell and his G-4 staff determined that a one-per-day issuance of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 2,830 calorie K ration (one K ration = three meals) would be sufficient to maintain the Marauders in the field. While compact, the K ration not only had fewer calories but less bulk, and included some components so unappetizing as to be thrown away by many users.

On the advice of British General Orde Wingate, the force was divided into two self-contained combat teams per battalion. In February 1944, in an offensive designed to disrupt Japanese offensive operations, three battalions in six combat teams (coded Red, White, Blue, Khaki, Green, and Orange) marched into Burma. On 24 February, the force began a 1,000-mile march over the Patkai range and into the Burmese jungle behind Japanese lines. A total of 2,750 Marauders entered Burma; the remaining 247 men remained in India as headquarters and support personnel.

While in Burma, the Marauders were usually outnumbered by Japanese troops from the 18th Division, but always inflicted many more casualties than they suffered. Led by Kachin scouts, and using mobility and surprise, the Marauders harassed supply and communication lines, shot up patrols, and assaulted Japanese rear areas, in one case cutting off the Japanese rearguard at Maingkwan. Near Walawbum, a town believed by General Stilwell&#x27;s NCAC staff to be lightly held, the 3rd Battalion killed some 400–500 enemy soldiers. The Japanese were continually surprised by the heavy, accurate volume of fire they received when attacking Marauder positions. Its combat-experienced officers had carefully integrated light mortar and machine gun fires, and virtually every man was armed with a self-loading or automatic weapon in which he had trained to a high level of marksmanship. In March they severed Japanese supply lines in the Hukawng Valley.

Informed by the British that the situation in Imphal was under control, Stilwell wanted to launch a final assault to capture the Japanese airfield at Myitkyina. Always guarded against the potential for interference by the British, General Stilwell did not coordinate his plans with Admiral Mountbatten, instead transmitting separate orders to his Chinese forces and the Marauders. The men took a brief rest at Shikau Gau, a jungle village clearing where they bartered with the native inhabitants for fresh eggs and chickens with an issue of 10-in-one and C rations. The Marauders also took the opportunity to sunbathe in an attempt to control the onset of various fungal skin diseases. Now down to a little over 2,200 officers and men, the 5307th began a series of battles on the march to Myitkyina.
In April, the Marauders were ordered by General Stilwell to take up a blocking position at Nhpum Ga and hold it against Japanese attacks, a conventional defensive action for which the unit had not been equipped. At times surrounded, the Marauders coordinated their own battalions in mutual support to break the siege after a series of fierce assaults by Japanese forces. At Nhpum Ga, the Marauders killed 400 Japanese soldiers, while suffering 57 killed in action, 302 wounded, and 379 incapacitated due to illness and exhaustion. Of the unit&#x27;s 200 mules, 75 were killed by artillery and mortar fire. A concurrent outbreak of amoebic dysentery (contracted after linking up with Chinese forces) further reduced their effective strength. Although the Marauders had previously avoided losses from this deadly disease (in part by use of halazone tablets and strict field sanitation procedures), their encampment with Chinese infantry, who used the rivers as latrines, proved their undoing (the Chinese troops, who always boiled their drinking water, were not seriously affected).

The disadvantages of supplying Marauders with a single K ration per day now made themselves felt, as the troops became increasingly malnourished; the onset of the rainy season combined with Japanese pressure and inhospitable terrain prevented many supply drops, exacerbating the problem. Even now, one K ration (three meals) per day was deemed adequate by General Stilwell&#x27;s staff, augmented by occasional drops of dry rice, jam, bread, candy, and C rations. When encountering Chinese troops, many men began to barter their K ration cigarettes for rice and other foods.

===Myitkyina and the end===
On 17 May 1944, after a grueling march over the Kumon Mountain range (using mules for carrying supplies) to Myitkyina, approximately 1,300 remaining Marauders, along with elements of the 42nd and 150th Chinese Infantry Regiments of the X Force, attacked the unsuspecting Japanese at the Myitkyina airfield. The airfield assault on 17 May 1944 was a complete success; however, the town of Myitkyina could not immediately be taken with the forces on hand. An initial assault by elements of two Chinese regiments was repulsed with heavy losses. NCAC intelligence staff had once again badly underestimated Japanese troop strength in the town, which had steadily been reinforced and now possessed a garrison of some 4,600 well-armed and fanatical Japanese defenders. Weakened by hunger, the 5307th continued fighting through the height of the monsoon season, worsening the situation; it also transpired that the area around Myitkyina had the largest reported incidence of scrub typhus, which some Marauders contracted after sleeping on infected areas of untreated ground, earth or grass. Racked with bloody dysentery and fevers, sleeping in the mud, Marauders alternately assaulted, then defended in a seesaw series of brutal conventional infantry engagements with Japanese forces. In a 1945 interview, Captain Fred O. Lyons, a Marauder officer, related the nature of the struggle:

By now my dysentery was so violent I was draining blood. Every one of the men was sick from one cause or another. My shoulders were worn raw from the pack straps, and I left the pack behind... The boys with me weren&#x27;t in much better shape... A scout moving ahead suddenly held his rifle high in the air. That meant Enemy sighted... Then at last we saw them, coming down the railroad four abreast... The gunner crouched low over his tommy-gun and tightened down. Then the gun spoke. Down flopped a half-dozen Japs, then another half dozen. The [Japanese] column spewed from their marching formation into the bush. We grabbed up the gun and slid back into the jungle. Sometimes staggering, sometimes running, sometimes dragging, I made it back to camp. I was so sick I didn&#x27;t care whether the Japs broke through or not; so sick I didn&#x27;t worry any more about letting the colonel down. All I wanted was unconsciousness.

After reinforcement by an airlanded Chinese army division, the town finally fell to the Allies on 3 August 1944. The Japanese commander escaped with about 600 of his men; 187 Japanese soldiers were captured, and the rest, some 3,800 men, were killed in combat.

In their final mission, the Marauders suffered 272 killed, 955 wounded, and 980 evacuated for illness and disease; some men later died from cerebral malaria, amoebic dysentery, and/or scrub typhus. Somewhat ironically, Marauders evacuated from the front lines were given jungle hammocks with protective sandfly netting and rain covers in which to sleep, equipment which might have prevented various diseases and illnesses had they been issued earlier in the campaign. The casualties included General Merrill himself, who had suffered a second heart attack before going down with malaria. He was replaced by his second-in-command, Colonel Charles N. Hunter, who later prepared a scathing report on General Stilwell&#x27;s medical evacuation policies (eventually prompting an Army Inspector General investigation and congressional hearings). By the time the town of Myitkyina was taken, only about 200 surviving members of the original Marauders were present. A week after Myitkyina fell, on 10 August 1944, the 5307th was disbanded with a final total of 130 combat-effective officers and men (out of the original 2,997). Of the 2,750 to enter Burma, only two were left alive who had never been hospitalized with wounds or major illness. None of the horses and only 41 mules survived.

==Legacy==
In slightly more than five months of combat, the Marauders had advanced through some of the harshest jungle terrain in the world, fought in five major engagements (Walawbum, Shaduzup, Inkangahtawng, Nhpum Ga, and Myitkyina) and engaged in combat with the Japanese Army on thirty-two separate occasions, including two conventional defensive battles with enemy forces for which the force had not been intended or equipped. Battling Japanese soldiers, hunger, fevers, and disease, they had traversed more jungle terrain on their long-range missions than any other U.S. Army formation during World War II.

The men of Merrill&#x27;s Marauders enjoyed the rare distinction of having each soldier awarded the Bronze Star. In June 1944, the 5307th Composite Unit (provisional) was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation:

: &quot;The unit must display such gallantry, determination, and &quot;esprit de corps&quot; in accomplishing its mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions as to set it apart and above other units participating in the same campaign&quot;.

On 10 August 1944 the Marauders were consolidated into the 475th Infantry, which continued service in northern Burma as a component of the brigade-sized MARS Task Force until February 1945. On 21 June 1954 the 475th Infantry was re-designated the 75th Infantry from which descended the 75th Ranger Regiment.

The commander of the 2nd Battalion of the Marauders, Colonel George A. McGee, was inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame (1992) for extraordinary valor and exemplary service. Roy H. Matsumoto (1993), Henry Gosho (1997), and Grant Hirabayashi (2004), Japanese-American interpreters for the Marauders were also inducted into the Ranger Hall of Fame.

On 5 December 2019, the United States Senate passed S. 743, the Merrill&#x27;s Marauders Congressional Gold Medal Act, legislation to honor the Marauders&#x27; extraordinary service. On 22 September 2020, the House of Representatives also passed the bill by unanimous consent. The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest expression by the Congress of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions to the country. On 6 October, the Bill approving the medal award was sent to the White House for its final signature.

As of 31 December 2020, seven Marauders were still alive. By May 2022, this number had dwindled to just two, Gabriel Kinney and Russell Hamler. Gabriel Kinney died on December 11, 2022, at the age of 101. Russell Hamler died at a veterans hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on December 26, 2023, at the age of 99.

Company S-2 within the Texas A&amp;M University Corps of Cadets is named after Merrill&#x27;s Marauders.

<text>Lorenzo Snow (April 3, 1814 – October 10, 1901) was an American religious leader who served as the fifth president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1898 until his death. Snow was the last president of the LDS Church in the 19th century and the first in the 20th.

==Family==
Snow was the fifth child and first son of Oliver Snow (September 18, 1775, Massachusetts – October 17, 1845, Illinois) and Rosetta L. Pettibone (October 22, 1778, Connecticut – October 12, 1846, Illinois), residents of Mantua Township, Ohio, who had left New England to settle on a new and fertile farm in the Connecticut Western Reserve. Lorenzo had siblings Leonora Abigail Snow (1801–1872), Eliza R. Snow (1804–1887), Percy Amanda Snow (1808–1848), Melissa Snow (1810–1835), Lucius Augustus Snow (born 1819), and Samuel Pearce Snow (born 1821).

Despite the labor required on the farm, the Snow family valued learning and saw that each child had educational opportunities. Snow received his final year of education at Oberlin College, which was founded by two Presbyterian ministers. Snow later made his living as a school teacher when not engaged in church service.

==Introduction to Mormonism==

In 1831, Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, took up residence in Hiram, Ohio, from the Snow farm. The Snow family was Baptist, but soon took a strong interest in the new religious movement. Snow recorded that he heard the Book of Mormon being read aloud in his home in Mantua and met Smith at Hiram in 1831. By 1835, Snow&#x27;s mother and his older sister, Eliza, had joined the Latter Day Saint church. Eliza soon moved to the church headquarters in Kirtland, Ohio, and worked as a school teacher. In her biography of Snow, Eliza stated she fostered his interest in Mormonism while he was at Oberlin. Eliza invited Snow to visit her and attend a school of Hebrew newly established by the church. During his visit there, in June 1836, Snow was baptized by John F. Boynton, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve.

==Early church service==

While living in Kirtland in 1837, Snow was called to serve a short mission in Ohio, traveling &quot;without purse or scrip.&quot; He recorded that relying on the kindness of others for his meals and lodging was difficult for him, as he had always had sufficient means to care for himself. When he returned to Kirtland in 1838, Snow found Smith&#x27;s followers in turmoil over the failure of the Kirtland Safety Society. Snow and the members of his extended family chose to move to Missouri in the summer of 1838 and join the Latter Day Saints settling near Far West. Snow became seriously ill with a fever, and was nursed for several weeks by his sister, Eliza.

Following his recovery, Snow left for a second mission to Illinois and Kentucky in the fall of 1838. He served there through February 1839, when he learned that the Latter Day Saints had been expelled from their settlements in Missouri. He traveled home by way of his former mission area in Ohio. He was again taken ill and was cared for by church members. He remained in Ohio, preaching and working with church members until the fall of 1839. During the school year of 1839–40, Snow taught in Shalersville, Ohio. He sent money to his family, which had by then settled in Nauvoo, Illinois; he joined them in May 1840.

Shortly after he arrived in Nauvoo, Snow was called to serve as a missionary in England. After an unpleasant sea voyage from New York City, Snow met with some members of the Quorum of the Twelve who had opened the British Mission in 1839, including Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Parley P. Pratt. Snow worked briefly in the Manchester area, and had success in Birmingham, where he baptized people in Greet&#x27;s Green and organized a branch in Wolverhampton. Snow was assigned to preside over church members in London. During his administration, church membership in the city increased from approximately 100 to 400 members. He was released from his mission by Pratt, who by then was president of an expanding European Mission. Snow arrived home on April 12, 1843, and was accompanied by a shipload of 250 British converts.

After visiting with his family, Snow again secured a teaching position for the winter, teaching at Lima, Illinois, thirty miles from Nauvoo. In late spring 1844, he returned to Ohio, preaching and baptizing new converts and distributing recent church publications to members. He was working in Cincinnati when he learned of the death of the Smiths. Snow closed his Ohio mission and promptly returned to Nauvoo.

During the period of disorganization and schism that followed Smith&#x27;s death, Snow chose to follow the Quorum of the Twelve, under Young&#x27;s direction. In 1845, Snow was involved in work in the Nauvoo Temple.

==Wives and children==

Before leaving Nauvoo, Snow accepted the principle of plural marriage and took two wives. Later, he took seven more.

==Migration to Utah==
Snow and his family, with wagons and livestock, joined a group of emigrants and moved across the Mississippi River into Iowa in February 1846. On the way west, Snow again became ill and the family stopped at Mt. Pisgah, Iowa. Three Snow children were born at the Mormon refugee settlement, but none of them survived. Snow was called to preside over the church organization in Mt. Pisgah and actively raised money to assist the bands of emigrants in their move west. The Snow family arrived in the Salt Lake Valley in 1848.

==Call to the Twelve and missions abroad==
In 1849, Snow was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the same day as Franklin D. Richards, Erastus Snow (a distant cousin), and Charles C. Rich. They were called to fill vacancies caused by the re-establishment of the First Presidency and Lyman Wight&#x27;s excommunication.

Shortly after his call to the Twelve, Snow left on a mission to Italy and French-speaking Switzerland. He later sent missionaries under his direction to India (1849–52). Snow was directly involved in missionary work in Italy and Switzerland, and also preached in Malta. He had planned to visit India, but various circumstances prevented this journey.

Snow began his mission in Italy among the Waldensians, an ancient sect of Christians who inhabited the Piedmont Valleys in the Alps. (Waldensianism predates the Reformation by several hundred years and is completely separate from Catholicism.) Snow and his companions, Joseph Toronto, Thomas Stenhouse, and Jabez Woodard, initially had very little success in converting the Waldensians to Mormonism. However, after healing a three-year-old boy named Joseph Gay, they began to find converts. In the end, more than 150 Waldensians converted to Mormonism, and 70 eventually emigrated to Utah.

In 1850, Snow wrote a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Voice of Joseph&quot; to advance missionary work in the Italian mission. He was unable to find anyone in Italy to translate it so sent it to Orson Pratt, then president of the British Mission, who found a translator in Paris. In 1851, Snow published a pamphlet entitled &quot;The Italian Mission&quot; about the church&#x27;s missionary efforts in Italy. It was published in London.

In January 1851, Snow went to England and found a person there whom he hired to translate the Book of Mormon into Italian.

The efforts of missionaries under Snow, especially those he sent to Turin, inspired an article attacking the Mormon missionaries for undermining the Roman Catholic Church in the Turinese paper, &quot;L&#x27;Armonia&quot;. Snow and his successors were unsuccessful, winning fewer than 200 converts, all of whom had either emigrated or were excommunicated by the time the mission closed in 1867, in no small part because of Italian laws that circumscribed publication of non-Catholic religious materials.

==Activities in Utah==
On his return to Utah Territory, Snow founded a society called the Polysophical Society to conduct study into the various aspects of human knowledge. He encouraged church members of all ages to join and some view this organization as a predecessor of the church&#x27;s Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association.

In 1853, under the direction of church president Brigham Young, Snow brought additional settlers to Brigham City, Utah. Settlement had begun on a limited scale at this site under the name &quot;Box Elder.&quot; Snow changed the name and moved the community towards living up to its name. He was also a key backer of the Brigham City Cooperative, which was the inspiration for ZCMI and other cooperatives. From this point and for several more years, Snow was both the community and ecclesiastical leader over Brigham City.

In 1864, Snow was sent on a mission to the Sandwich Islands, with Ezra T. Benson and Joseph F. Smith. The mission was prompted by messages from Jonatana Napela and other Hawaiian church members about the irregular administration of the church by Walter M. Gibson. While in Hawaii, Snow was seriously injured but was healed through the ministration of holders of the priesthood.

In 1871 Snow went on a trip to the Holy Land with George A. Smith and several other church leaders.

Snow tacitly helped engineer the 1901 election of his friend, Thomas Kearns, a wealthy Utah Catholic, to the United States Senate. Though this was criticized, both at the time and subsequently, the election of a non-Mormon may have helped Utah retain its statehood, and contributed to a detente between the LDS Church and the non-Mormon journal, the Salt Lake Tribune.

==Political offices==
Snow was first elected to the Utah Territorial Council, the upper house of the territorial legislature, in 1855. Originally, he represented Weber County, along with Lorin Farr. At that point, Weber County encompassed all of Utah north of Davis County. By 1857, Box Elder County, Cache County and the short-lived Malad County were added to the area Snow and Farr represented. In 1863, Weber and Box Elder Counties were broken off from Cache County (Malad County was by then defunct) and made a single-representative district, with Snow remaining as their lone council member. (Ezra T. Benson had replaced Farr in 1861; he was a resident of Cache County and remained the other representative after the district was split.)

In 1872, Snow became the president of the council. He held this position through the end of 1881. While president of the council, Snow had contact with a political delegation from Japan that visited Utah and influenced his later decision to send missionaries to Japan. In 1882, Snow remained a member of the council but was succeeded as its president by Joseph F. Smith. In 1884, Snow was succeeded as a member of the council by Franklin S. Richards.

==Other activities==
* Arrested and confined for unlawful cohabitation (1885–86) (Snow was pardoned in 1894 by U.S. President Grover Cleveland.)
* President of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles (1889–98)
* President of the Salt Lake Temple (1893–98). When he became the church&#x27;s president, Snow was succeeded as temple president by Joseph F. Smith.
* Between April 1901 and his death, Snow served as the general superintendent of the church&#x27;s Sunday School.

==Activities in Idaho==
As the church expanded into the surrounding states, members of the Quorum of the Twelve would be sent to other states of assignment.

In 1888, Snow went to Rexburg, Idaho, where he told the leaders of the stake that Karl G. Maeser had been appointed Commissioner of Church Education and recommended that they form a stake academy. The local leaders followed Snow&#x27;s instructions and the institution they formed eventually evolved into Brigham Young University–Idaho, formerly known as Ricks College.

==Later Church leadership==
Snow became president of the Quorum of the Twelve in 1889. In 1893, he became the first president of the Salt Lake Temple, a position he held until his death. There is a tradition that shortly after Snow&#x27;s death some of his relatives burned a trunk full of documents including some of his journals and other records, which means historians have less direct insight on Snow and his thoughts than some would like.

As president of the Quorum of the Twelve, Snow managed to bring a group of men who were often at odds over politics, especially at a time when the church had decided to proactively embrace a two party system, and through his peace making skills make them into a unified quorum.

After Wilford Woodruff issued his announcing that the church would not sanction additional plural marriages, it was Snow who offered the motion at the October 6th General Conference that the members of the church accept the Manifesto as authoritative and binding.

==Snow in the U.S. Supreme Court==
Snow was the subject of a United States Supreme Court case regarding polygamy prosecutions under the Edmunds Act. In late 1885, Snow was indicted by a federal grand jury for three counts of unlawful cohabitation. According to his indictments, Snow had lived with more than one woman for three years. The jury delivered one indictment for each of these years, and Snow was convicted on each count. After conviction, he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court which convicted him. The petition was denied, but federal law guaranteed him an appeal to the United States Supreme Court. In &quot;Ex Parte Snow&quot;, the Supreme Court invalidated Snow&#x27;s second and third convictions for unlawful cohabitation. It found that unlawful cohabitation was a &quot;continuing offense,&quot; and thus that Snow was at most guilty of one such offense for cohabiting continuously with more than one woman for three years.

==Actions as church president==

As President of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, Snow became the church&#x27;s presiding officer when its president, Wilford Woodruff, died. One of the first things he did was to reorganize the First Presidency almost immediately after Woodruff&#x27;s death, rather than waiting years as his predecessors had.

As he began his tenure as church president, Snow had to deal with the aftermath of legal battles with the United States over the practice of plural marriage. Men engaging in plural marriage were still being arrested and confined in Utah. Some members of the LDS Church did not accept the 1890 Manifesto put forth by Woodruff, and there was a strong division of opinion on plural marriage even in the priesthood hierarchy of the church.

The LDS Church was also in severe financial difficulties, some of which were related to the legal problems over plural marriage. Snow approached this problem first by issuing short term bonds with a total value of one million dollars. This was followed by emphatic teaching on tithing. It was during Snow&#x27;s presidency that the LDS Church adopted the principle of tithing—being interpreted as the payment of 10 percent of one&#x27;s income—as a hallmark of membership.

In 1899, Snow gave an address at the tabernacle in St. George, imploring the Latter-day Saints to pay tithes of corn, money, or whatever they had. Eventually, it rained in southern Utah. For the remainder of his tenure, Snow emphasized tithing in his sermons and public appearances. By April 1907, the practice of its members paying tithing had eliminated the church&#x27;s debt.

On March 31, 1900, Snow and his counselors in the First Presidency, changed the policy of presidential succession. Under the then-existing rules of presidential succession in the church, John Willard Young would have become church president when Snow died, as Snow was the only living person who had been ordained an apostle prior to Young. Snow was 85 years old and in poor health, so it appeared to many that Young would be the next president of the church. However, many of the general authorities felt that Young&#x27;s succession to the presidency would be a disaster for the church. Under the new policy, the new president of the church would no longer be the person who had been an ordained apostle the longest; rather, the new president of the church would be the person who had been a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles for the longest period of time. Since Young had never been a member of the Quorum of the Twelve, he could not become the president of the church if Snow died. On April 5, 1900, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve unanimously approved the new policy.

Snow died of pneumonia in Salt Lake City at age 87, and was succeeded as church president by Joseph F. Smith.

==LDS doctrine and teachings==
Snow is credited with succinctly summarizing the Latter-day Saint doctrines of exaltation and eternal progression, in his often repeated couplet: &quot;As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man may be.&quot;

Snow&#x27;s teachings as an apostle were the 2013 course of study in the LDS Church&#x27;s Relief Society and Melchizedek priesthood classes.

==Portrayal in film==
The role of Snow was played by Francis L. Urry in the LDS Church-made film &quot;The Windows of Heaven&quot;.

<doc id="436595" wikidata="Q451466" url="?curid=436595" title="Orde Wingate">
<text>Major General Orde Charles Wingate, (26 February 1903 – 24 March 1944) was a senior British Army officer known for his creation of the Chindit deep-penetration missions in Japanese-held territory during the Burma Campaign of the Second World War.

Wingate was an exponent of unconventional military thinking and the value of surprise tactics. Wingate was a dedicated Christian Zionist. In Mandatory Palestine, he set up a joint British–Jewish counter-insurgency unit called the Special Night Squads. Under the patronage of the area commander Archibald Wavell, Wingate was given increasing latitude to put his ideas into practice during the Second World War. He created units in Abyssinia and Burma.

At a time when Britain was in need of morale-boosting generalship, Wingate attracted British Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x27;s attention with a self-reliant aggressive philosophy of war, and was given resources to stage a large-scale operation. The last Chindit campaign may have determined the outcome of the Battle of Kohima, although the offensive into India by the Japanese may have occurred because Wingate&#x27;s first operation had demonstrated the possibility of moving through the jungle. In practice, both Japanese and British forces suffered severe supply problems and malnutrition.

Wingate was killed in an aircraft accident in March 1944. The casualty rate the Chindits suffered, especially from disease, is a continuing controversy. Wingate believed that resistance to infection could be improved by inculcating a tough mental attitude, but medical officers considered his methods unsuited to a tropical environment.

==Childhood and education==
Wingate, the eldest of three sons, was born on 26 February 1903 at Naini Tal near Almora in Kumaon, India, into a military family (cousins of the Wingate baronets). His father, Colonel George Wingate (1852–1936), had become a committed member of the Plymouth Brethren early in his army career in India; at the age of 46, after wooing her for 20 years, he married (Mary) Ethel (1867–1943), the oldest daughter of the Orde Browne family, who were also Plymouth Brethren. His father retired from the army two years after Wingate was born.

Most of Wingate&#x27;s childhood was spent in England. For the first 12 years of his life, he socialised primarily with his siblings. The seven Wingate children received a Christian education that was typical for that period, and time was set aside each day for studying and memorising the Scriptures.

In 1916, his family moved to Godalming where Wingate attended Charterhouse as a day boy. He did not board at the school nor did he participate in the activities of a public school education. Instead, he was kept busy at home by his parents, who encouraged their children to tackle challenging projects which fostered independent thought, initiative and self-reliance.

==Early army career==
After four years, Wingate left Charterhouse and in 1921 he was accepted at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, the Royal Artillery&#x27;s officers&#x27; training school. For committing a minor offence against the rules, a first-year student would be subjected to a ragging ritual named &quot;running&quot;. This ritual consisted of the first-year being stripped and forced to run a gauntlet of senior students, all of whom wielded a knotted towel which was used to hit the accused on his journey along the line. On reaching the end, the first-year would then be thrown into an icy-cold cistern of water.

When it came time for Wingate to run the gauntlet, for allegedly having returned a horse to the stables too late, he walked up to the senior student at the head of the gauntlet, stared at him and dared him to strike. The senior refused. Wingate moved to the next senior and did the same; he too refused. In turn, each senior declined to strike; coming to the end of the line, Wingate walked to the cistern and dived straight into the icy-cold water.

In 1923, Wingate received his Royal Artillery officer&#x27;s commission and was posted to the 5th Medium Brigade at Larkhill on Salisbury Plain. During this period, he was able to exercise his great interest in horse riding, gaining a reputation for his skill (and great success) in point-to-point races and fox hunting, particularly for finding suitable places to cross rivers, which earned him the nickname &quot;Otter&quot;. It was difficult for a 1920s army officer to live on his pay and Wingate, living life to the full, also gained a reputation as a late payer of his bills.

He was promoted to lieutenant on 29 August 1925. In 1926, Wingate was posted to the Army School of Equitation, where he excelled, much to the chagrin of the majority of the cavalry officers at the centre, who found him insufferable; he frequently challenged the instructors, as a demonstration of his rebellious nature.

==Sudan, 1928–1933==
Wingate&#x27;s father&#x27;s cousin, Sir Reginald Wingate, a retired army general who had been governor-general of the Sudan between 1899 and 1916 and high commissioner of Egypt from 1917 to 1919, had a considerable influence on Wingate&#x27;s career. He gave him a positive interest in Middle East affairs and in Arabic. As a result, Wingate applied to take a course in Arabic at the School of Oriental Studies in London and passed out of the course, which lasted from October 1926 to March 1927, with a mark of 85/100.

In June 1927, with Cousin Rex&#x27;s encouragement, Wingate obtained six months&#x27; leave in order to mount an expedition in the Sudan. Rex had suggested that he travel via Cairo and then try to obtain secondment to the Sudan Defence Force (SDF). Sending his luggage ahead of him, Wingate set off in September 1927 by bicycle, travelling first through France and Germany before making his way to Genoa via Czechoslovakia, Austria and Yugoslavia. From Genoa he took a boat to Egypt. From Cairo he travelled to Khartoum.

In April 1928, his application to transfer to the SDF came through and he was posted to the East Arab Corps, serving in the area of Roseires and Gallabat on the borders of Ethiopia, where the SDF patrolled to catch slave traders and ivory poachers. He changed the method of regular patrolling to ambushes.

In March 1930, Wingate was given command of a company of 300 soldiers with the local rank of (major). He was never happier than when in the bush with his unit, but when at HQ in Khartoum, he antagonised the other officers with his aggressive and argumentative personality. He was granted the local rank of captain in the regular army on 16 April 1930.

At the end of his tour, Wingate mounted a short expedition into the Libyan desert to investigate the lost army of Cambyses, mentioned in the writings of Herodotus, and to search for the lost oasis of Zerzura. Supported by equipment from the Royal Geographical Society (the findings of the expedition were published in the &quot;Royal Geographical Magazine&quot; in April 1934) and the Sudan Survey Department, the expedition set off in January 1933. Although they did not find the oasis, Wingate saw the expedition as an opportunity to test his endurance in a very harsh physical environment, and also his organisational and leadership abilities. He concluded his service in the Sudan on 2 April 1933.

==Return to the UK, 1933–1936==
On his return to the UK in 1933, Wingate was posted to Bulford on Salisbury Plain and was heavily involved in retraining, as British artillery units were being mechanised. On the sea voyage from Egypt he met Lorna Moncrieff Patterson, who was 16 years old and travelling with her mother. They were married two years later, on 24 January 1935.

From 13 January 1935, Wingate was seconded to the Territorial Army as the adjutant of the 71st (West Riding) Field Brigade, a Territorial Army unit of the Royal Artillery, with the temporary rank of captain. He was promoted to the substantive rank of captain on 16 May 1936, and vacated his appointment as adjutant on 8 September.

==Palestine and the Special Night Squads==

In September 1936, Wingate was assigned to a staff officer position in the British Mandate of Palestine, and became an intelligence officer. From his arrival he saw the creation of a Jewish State in Palestine as being a religious duty, and immediately put himself into absolute alliance with Jewish political leaders. Palestinian Arab guerrillas had at the time of his arrival begun a campaign of attacks against both British mandate officials and Jewish communities.

Wingate became politically involved with a number of Zionist leaders, and became an ardent Christian Zionist himself. He always returned to Kibbutz En Harod, because he felt familiar with the biblical judge Gideon, who fought in this area, and used it himself as a military base. He formulated the idea of raising small assault units of British-led Jewish commandos armed with grenades and light infantry small arms to combat the Arab revolt. Wingate took his idea personally to Archibald Wavell, who was then the commander of British forces in Palestine.

After Wavell gave his permission, Wingate convinced the Zionist Jewish Agency and the leadership of Haganah, the Jewish armed group. In June 1938, the new British commander, General Haining, gave his permission to create the Special Night Squads (SNSs), armed groups formed of British and Haganah volunteers. The Jewish Agency helped pay salaries and other costs of the Haganah personnel. The SNSs were regarded as &quot;well-oiled killing machines&quot;, while another British official called them &quot;just thuggery really&quot;.

Wingate trained, commanded and accompanied them on their patrols. The units frequently ambushed Arab saboteurs who attacked oil pipelines of the Iraq Petroleum Company, raiding border villages the attackers had used as bases. In these raids, Wingate&#x27;s men sometimes imposed severe collective punishments on the villagers. This included killing innocent Arabs who happened to be in the village but were not involved in blowing up the pipeline. In another instance, the SNS went into a village, lined up all the male villagers and shot every eighth man.

These methods were criticised by Zionist leaders as well as Wingate&#x27;s British superiors. Israeli historian Yoram Kaniuk wrote about Wingate&#x27;s brutality.The operations came more frequently and became more ruthless. The Arabs complained to the British about Wingate&#x27;s brutality and harsh punitive methods. Even members of the field squads complained... that during the raids on Bedouin encampments Wingate would behave with extreme viciousness and fire mercilessly. Wingate believed in the principle of surprise in punishment, which was designed to confine the gangs to their villages. More than once he had lined rioters up in a row and shot them in cold blood. Wingate did not try to justify himself; weapons and war cannot be pure.

Wingate employed various forms of torture against the Arabs, some non-lethal. Wingate would force sand into villagers&#x27; mouths until they vomited. In one case, when Arab saboteurs had caused an oil leak, he took all the men from an Arab village and threw them into a pool of crude oil.

Wingate disliked Arabs, once shouting at Haganah fighters after a June 1938 attack on a village on the border between Mandatory Palestine and Lebanon, &quot;I think you are all totally ignorant in your Ramat Yochanan [the training base for the Haganah] since you do not even know the elementary use of bayonets when attacking dirty Arabs: how can you put your left foot in front?&quot; But the brutal tactics proved effective in quelling the uprising, and Wingate was awarded the DSO in 1938. In September 1938, after a rebel mine killed the Jewish leader of Ein Harod settlement, Chaim Sturman, Wingate let out a &quot;cry, more a scream than an order&quot; and carried out a reprisal operation on the Arab quarter of Beisan, near the explosion. He ordered &quot;the killing of every Arab discovered in the vicinity of the raid.&quot; &quot;&#x27;Everybody into the cars!&#x27; … . We grabbed our rifles and within a few seconds were all in the cars. Without any plan of action or preparation, with Wingate at our head, we entered the Arab part of Beit Shean, which swarmed with gang members, and began to beat and trample anyone in our path. Wingate himself went out of control, entering stores and destroying whatever was in them. An hour later we returned to Ein Harod.&quot;However, his deepening direct political involvement with the Zionist cause and an incident where he spoke publicly in favour of the formation of a Jewish state during his leave in Britain, caused his superiors in Palestine to remove him from command. Wingate was so deeply associated with political causes in Palestine that his superiors considered him compromised as an intelligence officer in the country. He was promoting his own agenda rather than that of the army or the government. In May 1939, he was transferred to Britain. Wingate became a hero of the Yishuv (the Jewish Community), and was loved by leaders such as Zvi Brenner and Moshe Dayan, who trained under him and claimed that Wingate had &quot;taught us everything we know.&quot;

==Ethiopia and Gideon Force==

Wingate was the commander of an anti-aircraft unit in Britain when the Second World War began. He repeatedly made proposals to the army and government for the creation of a Jewish army in Palestine which would rule over the area and its Arab population in the name of the British. His friend Wavell was commander-in-chief of Middle East Command based in Cairo, and he invited him to Sudan to begin operations against Italian occupation forces in Ethiopia. He created Gideon Force under William Platt, the British commander in Sudan, a Special Operations Executive (SOE) force composed of British, Sudanese, and Ethiopian soldiers. At Khartoum, he and Tony Simonds joined Mission 101 controlled by London and Cairo.

Gideon force was named after the biblical judge Gideon who defeated a large force with a tiny band of men. Wingate invited a number of veterans of the Haganah SNS to join him, with the blessing of Ethiopia&#x27;s Emperor Haile Selassie, and the group began to operate in February 1941. The Italians occupied Ethiopia between 1936 and 1941, and they conducted operations to &quot;pacify&quot; the people which killed about seven per cent of the population. There was a huge reservoir of hatred for the Italians as a result, and many Ethiopians were happy to assist Gideon Force. Wingate was temporarily promoted lieutenant colonel and put in command. He again insisted on leading from the front and accompanied his troops in the reconquest of Abyssinia.

Gideon Force harassed Italian forts and their supply lines with the aid of local resistance fighters, while regular army units took on the main Italian army. A small force of no more than 1,700 men took the surrender of about 20,000 Italians toward the end of the campaign. At the end of the fighting, Wingate and the men of Gideon Force linked with the force of Lt. Gen. Alan Cunningham which had advanced from Kenya in the south, and they accompanied the emperor in his triumphant return to Addis Ababa that May. Wingate was mentioned in dispatches in April 1941 and was awarded a bar to his DSO in December.

With the end of the East African Campaign on 4 June 1941, Wingate was removed from command of the dismantled Gideon Force and his rank reduced to that of major. During the campaign, he was irritated that British authorities ignored a request for decorations for his men. They also obstructed his efforts to obtain back pay and other compensation. He left for Cairo and wrote an official report which was extremely critical of his commanders, fellow officers, government officials, and many others. He was also angry that his efforts had not been praised by authorities and that he had been forced to leave Abyssinia without saying farewell to Emperor Selassie. He was most concerned about British attempts to stifle Ethiopian freedom, writing that attempts to raise future rebellions amongst populations must be honest ones and should appeal to justice.

Wingate contracted malaria soon after this and sought treatment from a local doctor instead of army medical staff because he was afraid that the illness would give his detractors a further excuse to undermine him. This doctor gave him a large supply of the drug Atabrine, which can produce depression as a side-effect if taken in high dosages. Wingate was already depressed by the official response to his Abyssinian command, and he was also sick with malaria; he attempted suicide by stabbing himself in the neck. Only prompt action by another officer saved him, and he was sent to Britain to recuperate.

A highly edited version of his report was passed to Winston Churchill through his political supporters in London, and Secretary of State for India Leo Amery contacted Wavell, Commander-in-Chief in India commanding the South-East Asian Theatre to enquire if there were any chance of employing Wingate in the Far East. Wingate was far from pleased with his posting as a &quot;supernumerary major without staff grading&quot;, but he left Britain for Rangoon on 27 February 1942.

==Burma==
===Chindits and the first long-range jungle penetration mission===

Wingate was appointed colonel once more by General Wavell upon arrival in the Far East in March 1942, and he was ordered to organise guerrilla units to fight behind Japanese lines. However, the precipitate collapse of Allied defences in Burma forestalled further planning, and he flew back to India in April where he began to promote his ideas for jungle long-range penetration units. &quot;Never ask favours&quot;, he recalled from his long association with Wavell, &quot;but tell people if they care to help they can come along, that you yourself are going anyway&quot;.

Wavell was intrigued by Wingate&#x27;s theories and gave him the (Indian) 77th Infantry Brigade, from which he created a jungle long-range penetration unit. 77 Brigade was eventually named the Chindits, a corrupted version of a mythical Burmese lion called the &quot;chinthe&quot;. By August 1942, he had set up a training centre at Dhana near Saugor district in Madhya Pradesh and attempted to toughen up the men by having them camp in the Indian jungle during the rainy season. This proved disastrous, as the result was a very high sickness rate among the men. In one battalion, 70 per cent of the men went absent from duty due to illness, while a Gurkha battalion was reduced from 750 men to 500. Many of the men were replaced in September 1942 by new drafts of personnel from elsewhere in the army.

Meanwhile, he won few friends among the officer corps with his direct manner of dealing with fellow officers and superiors, along with eccentric personal habits. He would eat raw onions because he thought that they were healthy, scrub himself with a rubber brush instead of bathing, and greet visitors to his tent while completely naked. Wavell&#x27;s political connections and patronage protected him from closer scrutiny, for he admired Wingate&#x27;s work in the Abyssinian campaign, but Wingate remained the regimental gadfly always ready to flout the King&#x27;s Regulations; he grew a beard in the jungle and allowed his men to do the same. Nevertheless, he won plaudits by his outstanding courage and leadership in the face of the enemy.

The original 1943 Chindit operation was supposed to be a coordinated plan with the field army, but the Army&#x27;s offensive into Burma was cancelled. Wingate then persuaded Wavell to let him proceed into Burma anyway, arguing the need to disrupt any Japanese attack on Sumprabum as well as to gauge the utility of long-range jungle penetration operations, and Wavell eventually gave his consent to &quot;Operation Longcloth&quot;. Wingate set out from Imphal on 12 February 1943 with the Chindits organised into eight separate columns to cross the Chindwin river. The force met with initial success in putting one of the main railways in Burma out of action, then Wingate led them deep into Burma and over the Irrawaddy River. However, they found conditions very different from what their intelligence had led them to expect. The area was dry and inhospitable and criss-crossed by motor roads which the Japanese were able to use to good effect, particularly by intercepting supply drops to the Chindits. They soon began to suffer severely from exhaustion and shortages of water and food.

On 22 March, Eastern Army HQ ordered Wingate to withdraw his units back to India. He and his senior commanders considered a number of options to achieve this, but all were threatened by the fact that the Japanese would be able to focus their attention on destroying the Chindit force, having no major army offensive in progress. They finally agreed to retrace their steps to the Irrawaddy, since the Japanese would not expect this, and then disperse to make attacks on the enemy as they returned to the Chindwin. By mid-March, the Japanese had three infantry divisions chasing the Chindits, who were eventually trapped inside the bend of the Shweli River. They were unable to cross the river intact and still reach British lines, so they split into small groups to evade enemy forces. The Japanese paid great attention to preventing air resupply of Chindit columns, as well as hindering their mobility by removing boats from the Irrawaddy, Chindwin, and Mu rivers and actively patrolling the river banks. The force returned to India by various routes during the spring of 1943 in groups ranging from single individuals to whole columns: some directly, others via a roundabout route from China, and always harassed by the Japanese. Casualties were high, and the force lost approximately one-third of its total strength.

===After-battle analysis===
With the losses incurred during the first long-range jungle penetration operation, many officers in the British and Indian army questioned the overall value of the Chindits. The campaign had the unintended effect of convincing the Japanese that certain sections of the Burma/India Frontier were not as impassable as they previously believed, thus altering their strategic plans. As one consequence, the overall Japanese Army commander in Burma, Gen. Masakazu Kawabe, began planning a 1944 offensive into India to capture the Imphal Plain and Kohima, in order to better defend Burma from future Allied offensives.

In London, the Chindits and their exploits were viewed as a success after the long string of Allied disasters in the Far East theatre. Winston Churchill, an ardent proponent of commando operations, was, in particular, complimentary toward the Chindits and their accomplishments. The Japanese subsequently admitted that the Chindits had disrupted their plans for the first half of 1943.

As a propaganda tool, the Chindit operation was used to prove to the army and those at home that the Japanese could be beaten and that British/Indian troops could successfully operate in the jungle against experienced Japanese forces. On his return, Wingate wrote an operations report in which he was again highly critical of the army and even some of his own officers and men. He also promoted more unorthodox ideas such as the idea that British soldiers had become weak by having too easy access to doctors in civilian life. The report was again passed through back channels by Wingate&#x27;s political friends in London directly to Churchill. The Prime Minister then invited Wingate to London for talks.

Soon after Wingate arrived, Churchill decided to take him and his wife along to the Quebec Conference. There, Wingate explained his ideas of deep penetration warfare to the Combined Chiefs of Staff meeting on 17 August. Air power, radio, and recent developments in warfare would allow units to establish bases deep in enemy territory, breaching the outer defences, and extend the range of conventional forces. The leaders were impressed, and larger scale deep-penetration attacks were approved. By now, a war-substantive lieutenant-colonel and temporary brigadier, Wingate was promoted to the rank of acting major general on 18 September 1943.

===Second long-range jungle penetration mission===

After his meeting with Allied leaders, Wingate contracted typhoid by drinking water from a flower vase in a Cairo hotel while on his way back to India. Doctors were shocked as it was drummed into every serviceman that they should never use such a source as drinking water. His illness prevented him from taking a more active role in training of the new long-range jungle forces.

While Wingate was still in Burma, Wavell had ordered the formation of 111 Brigade, known as the &quot;Leopards&quot;, along the lines of the 77 Brigade. He selected Brigadier Joe Lentaigne as the new commander. Wavell intended that the two brigades would operate in tandem with one engaged on operations while the other trained and prepared for the next operation. However, once back in India, Wingate was promoted to acting major general and was given six brigades. This involved breaking up the experienced 70th Division, which other commanders felt could be better used as a standard &quot;line&quot; division. At first, Wingate proposed to convert the entire front into one giant Chindit mission by breaking up the whole of the Fourteenth Army into Long-Range Penetration units, presumably in the expectation that the Japanese would follow them around the Burmese jungle in an effort to wipe them out. This plan was hurriedly dropped after other commanders pointed out that the Japanese Army would simply advance and seize the air bases from which Chindit forces were supplied, requiring a defensive battle and substantial troops that the Indian Army would be unable to provide.

In the end, a new long-range jungle penetration operation was planned, this time using all six of the brigades recently allocated to Wingate. The second long-range penetration mission was originally intended as a coordinated effort with a planned regular army offensive against northern Burma, but events on the ground resulted in cancellation of the army offensive, leaving the long-range penetration groups without a means of transporting all six brigades into Burma. Upon Wingate&#x27;s return to India, he found that his mission had also been cancelled for lack of air transport. Wingate took the news bitterly, voicing disappointment to all who would listen, including Allied commanders such as Colonel Philip Cochran of the 1st Air Commando Group, which proved to be a blessing in disguise. Cochran told Wingate that cancelling the long-range mission was unnecessary; only a limited amount of aerial transport would be needed since, in addition to the light planes and C-47 Dakotas Wingate had counted on, Cochran explained that 1st Air Commando had 150 gliders to haul supplies: &quot;Wingate’s dark eyes widened as Phil explained that the gliders could also move a sizable force of troops. The general immediately spread a map on the floor and planned how his Chindits, airlifted deep into the jungle, could fan out from there and fight the Japanese&quot;.

With his new glider landing option, Wingate decided to proceed into Burma anyway. The character of the 1944 operations differed from those of 1943 in that they aimed to establish fortified bases in Burma out of which the Chindits would conduct offensive patrol and blocking operations. A similar strategy would be used by the French in Indochina years later at Dien Bien Phu.

===Operation Thursday===
Wingate planned that part of 77 Brigade would land by glider in Burma and prepare airstrips into which 111 Brigade and the remainder of 77 Brigade would be flown by C-47 transport aircraft. Three landing sites, codenamed &quot;Piccadilly&quot;, &quot;Broadway&quot; and &quot;Chowringhee&quot; were selected. On the evening of 5 March as Wingate, Lieutenant General Slim (the commander of Fourteenth Army), Brigadier Michael Calvert (the commander of 77 Brigade) and Cochran waited at an airfield in India for 77 Brigade to fly into &quot;Piccadilly&quot;, an incident occurred which Wingate&#x27;s critics later claimed to show his lack of firmness or balance.

Wingate had forbidden continuous reconnaissance of the landing sites to avoid compromising the security of the operation, but Cochran ordered a last-minute reconnaissance flight which showed &quot;Piccadilly&quot; to be completely obstructed with logs. By Slim&#x27;s account, Wingate became highly emotional and insisted that the operation had been betrayed, and that the Japanese would have set up ambushes on the other two landing sites. He passed the responsibility for ordering the operation to proceed or to be cancelled to Slim.

Slim ordered that the operation was to go ahead. Wingate then ordered that 77 Brigade would fly into &quot;Chowringhee&quot;. Both Cochran and Calvert objected, as &quot;Chowringhee&quot; was on the wrong side of the Irrawaddy and Cochran&#x27;s pilots were not familiar with the layout. Eventually, &quot;Broadway&quot; was selected instead. The landings were initially a failure, as many gliders crashed &quot;en route&quot; or on &quot;Broadway&quot;, but Calvert&#x27;s brigade soon made the landing ground fit to take aircraft, and sent the success signal. It was later found that the logs on &quot;Piccadilly&quot; had been laid there to dry by Burmese teak loggers.

Once all the Chindit brigades (less one which remained in India) had marched or flown into Burma, they established base areas and drop zones behind Japanese lines. By fortunate timing, the Japanese launched an invasion of India around the same time. By forcing several pitched battles along their line of march, the Chindit columns were able to disrupt the Japanese offensive, diverting troops from the battles in India.

The value of Wingate&#x27;s Chindits has been disputed. Field Marshal William Slim argued that special forces in general had an overall negative effect on the prosecution of war by separating the best-trained and most committed troops from the main army. However, Sir Robert Thompson, a Chindit who went on to become one of &quot;world&#x27;s leading expert on countering the Mao Tse-tung technique of rural guerrilla insurgency&quot;, wrote in his autobiography that &quot;Every time I look at the picture of General Slim and his Corps Commanders being knighted by Lord Wavell as Viceroy on the field of battle after Imphal, I see the ghost of Wingate present. He was unquestionably one of the great men of [the 20th] century&quot;.

Regarding Operation Thursday, historian Raymond Callahan, author of &quot;Churchill and His Generals&quot; argues that &quot;Wingate’s ideas were flawed in many respects. For one thing, the Imperial Japanese Army did not have Western-style supply lines to disrupt, and tended to ignore logistics generally. When Special Force launched itself into Burma in March 1944, Wingate’s ideas, so enchantingly laid out for Churchill, rapidly proved unworkable.&quot; However, the Japanese commander, Mutaguchi Renya, later stated that Operation Thursday had a significant effect on the campaign, saying &quot;The Chindit invasion ... had a decisive effect on these operations ... they drew off the whole of 53 Division and parts of 15 Division, one regiment of which would have turned the scales at Kohima&quot;.

==Death==

On 24 March 1944, Wingate flew to assess the situations in three Chindit-held bases in Burma. On his return, he agreed to allow two British war correspondents&#x27; request for a lift even though the pilot protested that the plane was overloaded. Flying from Imphal to Lalaghat, the USAAF B-25 Mitchell bomber of the 1st Air Commando Group in which he was flying crashed into jungle-covered hills in the present-day state of Manipur in northeast India, killing all passengers aboard, including Wingate, who died an acting major general. In place of Wingate, Brigadier (later Lt.-Gen.) Walter Lentaigne was appointed to overall command of LRP forces. He flew out of Burma to assume command as Japanese forces began their assault on Imphal. Command of Lentaigne&#x27;s 111 Brigade in Burma was assigned to Lt. Col. J.R. &#x27;Jumbo&#x27; Morris.

==Burial==
Five of the nine killed in the airplane crash were members of the American flight crew: Lieutenant Brian F. Hodges, Spartanburg, South Carolina; Lieutenant Stephen A. Wanderer, Hamilton, Montana; Technical Sergeant James W. Hickey, Dallas, Texas; Technical Sergeant Frank Sadoski, Freeman Spur, Illinois; and Staff Sergeant Vernon A. McIninch, Purcell, Oklahoma. The British victims were Wingate and his aide, Captain George H. Borrow, and two London war correspondents, Stuart Emeny (&quot;News Chronicle&quot;) and Stanley Wills (&quot;Daily Herald&quot;).

The remains of the crew and passengers of the B-25 were initially buried in a common grave close to the crash site 40 miles from Imphal, in the village of Thiulon. On April 18, 1947, &quot;The Calcutta Statesman&quot; reported that the grave had been located by the Imperial War Graves Commission and the U.S. Graves Registration Service. It was officially announced on April 30, 1947, that the remains had been taken from the original burial site and reinterred at Imphal Military Cemetery.

United States law required the repatriation of American service members killed and temporarily buried overseas during World War II. Instances in which remains could not be individually identified were difficult when multiple nationalities were involved. In January 1947 the U.S. government proposed that all remains in such cases be returned to the United States for final burial. Negotiations with the U.K. and other Commonwealth governments led to an agreement that when group burials contained a majority of British remains, final disposition would be determined by the British. If the majority of the remains were American, all remains in the group would be returned to the U.S. for burial. Prior consultation with family members was prohibited in either case.

In December 1949, the remains of Wingate and the other victims of the airplane crash were removed from Imphal Military Cemetery. On November 10, 1950, they were buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Commemoration==

In a tribute to Wingate, Churchill called him &quot;one of the most brilliant and courageous figures of the second world war ... a man of genius who might well have become also a man of destiny&quot;.

A memorial to Orde Wingate and the Chindits stands on the north side of the Victoria Embankment, near Ministry of Defence headquarters in London. The facade commemorates the Chindits and the four men awarded the Victoria Cross. The battalions that took part are listed on the sides, with non-infantry units mentioned by their parent formations. The rear of the monument is dedicated to Orde Wingate, and also mentions his contributions to the state of Israel.

To commemorate Wingate&#x27;s great assistance to the Zionist cause, Israel&#x27;s National Centre for Physical Education and Sport, the Wingate Institute (&quot;Machon Wingate&quot;, מכון וינגייט) was named after him. A square in the Talbiya neighbourhood of Jerusalem, Wingate Square (&quot;Kikar Wingate&quot;), also bears his name, as does the Yemin Orde youth village near Haifa. A Jewish football club formed in London in 1946, Wingate Football Club was also named in his honour.

The General Wingate School, on the western city limit of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, commemorates Orde Wingate&#x27;s contribution (along with the Gideon Force and the Ethiopian Patriots) to the liberation of Ethiopia in 1941, following the defeat of the Italian forces in that country.

A memorial stone in his honour stands in Charlton Cemetery, London, where other members of the Orde Browne family are buried. There is a memorial in Charterhouse School Chapel.

Wingate Golf Club, Harare, Zimbabwe is named after the general and there are photographs of him in the Clubhouse. The club was set up to accommodate Jewish and Catholic members since The Royal Harare Golf Club in the past did not admit either.

The deep-penetration tactics pioneered by the Chindits were adopted by the Indonesian National Army during the Indonesian National Revolution against the Netherlands. As conventional defensive tactics failed to make up for the technological advantage held by the Dutch, Indonesian General A.H. Nasution ordered Indonesian units to carry out &#x27;Wingate&#x27; actions by penetrating into enemy lines and setting up pockets of resistance during the closing stages of the revolution in 1948. 

==Eccentricities==
Wingate was known for various eccentricities. For instance, he often wore an alarm clock around his wrist, which would go off at times, and had raw onions and garlic on a string around his neck, which he would occasionally bite into as a snack (the reason he used to give for this was to ward off mosquitoes). He often went about without clothing. In Palestine, recruits were used to having him come out of the shower to give them orders, wearing nothing but a shower cap, and continuing to scrub himself with a shower brush. Sometimes Wingate would eat only grapes and onions.

Lord Moran, Winston Churchill&#x27;s personal physician, wrote in his diaries that &quot;[Wingate] seemed to me hardly sane – in medical jargon a borderline case.&quot; Likewise, referring to Churchill&#x27;s meeting with Wingate in Quebec, Max Hastings wrote that, &quot;Wingate proved a short-lived protégé: closer acquaintance caused Churchill to realise that he was too mad for high command.&quot;

Field Marshal Montgomery told Moshe Dayan in 1966 that he considered Wingate to have &quot;been mentally unbalanced and that the best thing he ever did was to get killed in a plane crash in 1944.&quot;
==Historiography==
Wingate&#x27;s eccentric and strong-willed personality, his reputation for being difficult, advocacy of irregular warfare and his Zionism have led to sharply opposed assessments by historians. The British historian Simon Anglim called Wingate the most controversial British general of the Second World War as no other British general from that war produced such starkly polarized interpretations. The Chindit operations have been presented as either costly operations that achieved nothing or inspired operations that tied down Japanese troops that could have been used in the invasion of India. In Britain, the two opposing tendencies has been for historians to portray him either as a mentally unstable, delusional figure operating well beyond his level of competence as in official works by I.S.O. Playfair and Woodburn Kirby or alternatively as a visionary, a leader of men noted for his audacity, courage and toughness as in works by Charles Rolo, Bernard Fergusson, Wilfred Burchett, and Leonard Mosley.

Attempts to achieve a balance between the opposing views of Wingate were &quot;Orde Wingate and the Historians&quot; by Peter Mead, &quot;Wingate and the Chindits&quot; by David Rooney and &quot;Orde Wingate&quot; by Christopher Sykes. In Ethiopia, Wingate is remembered as liberator from the Italian occupation. In Israel, Wingate&#x27;s role in creating and leading the SNS, which became the prototype of the Israeli Defense Forces, has made him a national hero, a man celebrated for his Zionism and courage, in the words of the Israeli historian Michael Oren a &quot;heroic, larger-than-life figure to whom the Jewish people owed a deep and enduring debt&quot;.

The two most popular Israeli books about Wingate, both written by SNS veterans were &quot;In the Path of Fighters&quot; by Israel Carmi and &quot;Orde Wingate: His Life and Works&quot; by Avraham Akavia. By contrast, Palestinian historians portrayed Wingate very negatively as a thuggish fanatic who terrorized Palestinian villages during the Arab Revolt.

In recent years, the Israeli New Historians have taken a critical picture of Wingate with Tom Segev calling him &quot;quite mad, and perhaps a sadist, too&quot; and a war criminal. Oren has accused Segev of maligning Wingate, arguing that Segev has &quot;edited&quot; accounts by contemporaries to imply that Wingate was present at incidents in Palestine when he was in London at the time.

==Family==
Orde Wingate&#x27;s wife was Lorna Paterson who was the daughter of Walter Edward Moncrieff Paterson and the violist Alice Ivy Hay. Alice Ivy Hay wrote a biography of her son-in-law titled &quot;There was a Man of Genius : Letters to my Grandson Orde Jonathan Wingate&quot; published in 1963. Orde Jonathan Wingate was a son born six weeks after his death, Lt Col Orde Jonathan Wingate, joined the Honourable Artillery Company after a regular Army career in the Royal Artillery and became the regiment&#x27;s commanding officer and later regimental colonel. He died in 2000 at the age of 56, and was survived by his wife and two daughters.

He was also related to Reginald Wingate and Ronald Wingate. The Governor of Malta, Sir William Dobbie, was his uncle. His sister was missionary and linguist Rachel O. Wingate.

==In popular culture==
*In 1976, the BBC produced a three-part drama called &quot;Orde Wingate&quot;, based on his life, in which he was played by Barry Foster. The programme was made on a limited budget with reduced or stylised settings. It did not attempt to tell the complete story of his life, but presented key episodes in a non-linear way, mainly his time in Palestine but including Burma. Foster reprised his role as Wingate in a 1982 TV movie &quot;A Woman Called Golda&quot;.
*A fictionalised version of Wingate called &quot;P.P. Malcolm&quot; appears in Leon Uris&#x27;s novel &quot;Exodus&quot;, while he also appears in another Leon Uris novel, &quot;The Haj&quot;. Additionally, in James Michener&#x27;s &quot;The Source&quot;, a reference is made to the &quot;Orde Wingate Forest&quot;, which is located in Israel at Mount Gilboa.
*&quot;Wingate and Chindits&quot; is an episode of the documentary TV series &quot;Narrow Escapes of World War II&quot; first presented in the United States on the Military Channel in 2012.
*An episode of &quot;The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot; titled &quot;AMOK&quot; features a highly fictional take on Wingate&#x27;s legacy in which his death was &quot;a bit of a charade ... and a devilishly clever one at that&quot;. While exploring in Borneo, the Quest clan come across a mysterious valley and native village headed by Orde Wingate II, a fictionalized son of the true man. It is explained that during the course of the Second World War, Wingate had come across the valley and befriended the people indigenous to it. Finished with the war and knowing that the Allied Powers were close to winning in the Pacific, Wingate decided to lie low and live out the rest of his life peacefully in the valley, and so faked the plane crash leading to his apparent demise. In order to protect the valley from intruders, he created the identity of the Amok, a savage sloth-like, Bigfoot creature based on an Indonesian guardian spirit.

<doc id="436599" wikidata="Q7413501" url="?curid=436599" title="San Carlos, Belize">
<text>The village of San Carlos is located in the north of Belize, in Orange Walk District, on the northern bank of New River, surrounded by jungle. It is four miles from Indian Church, and can be accessed by road from Orange Walk Town or by boat from the New River.

San Carlos is small, with a population of 154 (2013) of Mestizo ethnicity. The village was set up by a group of families around 1970 from the larger town of Guinea Grass Town. Other inhabitants are originally from Guatemala, immigrating to Belize during the tumultuous years of civil war. The village is still technologically primitive. Water is pumped from wells for washing and bathing. Rain water tanks collect plenty of drinking water during the months of June thru December. An NGO donated 25 solar panels to the community providing evening light to 25 homes. A few families have purchased their own solar panels while a few families rely solely on kerosene lamps or candles. There are 32 occupied homes and 36 families in the Village. Additionally, a few villagers own generators to pump water from the wells, power washing machines, light, television, and irrigation systems.

Its economy revolves around agriculture, although a number of men are currently employed at the Maya ruins at Lamanai in order to restore some of the temples. A number of men with pickup trucks are hired by the Mennonites in nearby communities (Indian Creek and Shipyard) to drive, help with farming, and running errands. Agricultural pursuits include a host of fruits and vegetables, including onions, habanero peppers, bananas and watermelons.

A future prospect for San Carlos is to acquire capital for a jetty out into the picturesque lagoon in order to profit from Belize&#x27;s booming tourism industry as it would allow visitors to the ruins at Lamanai to visit this friendly community. There is currently one U.S. Peace Corps volunteer living in the village working on the rural family health project implemented by the Peace Corps and the Ministry of Health in Belize.

<text>The Decapoda or decapods () is a large order of crustaceans within the class Malacostraca, and includes crabs, lobsters, crayfish, shrimp, and prawns. Most decapods are scavengers. The order is estimated to contain nearly 15,000 extant species in around 2,700 genera, with around 3,300 fossil species. Nearly half of these species are crabs, with the shrimp (about 3,000 species) and Anomura including hermit crabs, king crabs, porcelain crabs, squat lobsters (about 2500 species) making up the bulk of the remainder. The earliest fossils of the group date to the Devonian.

==Anatomy==

Decapods can have as many as 38 appendages, arranged in one pair per body segment. As the name Decapoda (from the Greek , &quot;&quot;, &quot;ten&quot;, and , &quot;-pod&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;) implies, ten of these appendages are considered legs. They are the pereiopods, found on the last five thoracic segments. In many decapods, one pair of these &quot;legs&quot; has enlarged pincers, called chelae, with the legs being called chelipeds. In front of the pereiopods are three pairs of maxillipeds that function as feeding appendages. The head has five pairs of appendages, including mouthparts, antennae, and antennules. There are five more pairs of appendages on the abdomen. They are called pleopods. There is one final pair called uropods, which, with the telson, form the tail fan.
==Evolution==
A 2019 molecular clock analysis suggested decapods originated in the Late Ordovician around 455 million years ago, with the Dendrobranchiata (prawns) being the first group to diverge. The remaining group, called Pleocyemata, then diverged between the swimming shrimp groupings and the crawling/walking group called Reptantia, consisting of lobsters and crabs. High species diversification can be traced to the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, which coincides with the rise and spread of modern coral reefs, a key habitat for the decapods. Despite the inferred early origin, the oldest fossils of the group such as &quot;Palaeopalaemon&quot; only date to the Late Devonian.

The cladogram below shows the internal relationships of Decapoda, from analysis by Wolfe &quot;et al.&quot; (2019).
In the cladogram above, the clade Glypheidea is excluded due to lack of sufficient DNA evidence, but is likely the sister clade to Polychelida, within Reptantia.

==Classification==
Classification within the order Decapoda depends on the structure of the gills and legs, and the way in which the larvae develop, giving rise to two suborders: Dendrobranchiata and Pleocyemata. The Dendrobranchiata consist of prawns, including many species colloquially referred to as &quot;shrimp&quot;, such as the &quot;white shrimp&quot;, &quot;Litopenaeus setiferus&quot;. The Pleocyemata include the remaining groups, including &quot;true shrimp&quot;. Those groups that usually walk rather than swim (Pleocyemata, excluding Stenopodidea and Caridea) form a clade called Reptantia.

This classification to the level of superfamilies follows De Grave &quot;et al.&quot;

<doc id="436602" wikidata="Q4043768" url="?curid=436602" title="Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary">
<text>&quot;Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary&quot; is an English nursery rhyme. The rhyme has been seen as having religious and historical significance, but its origins and meaning are disputed. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19626.

==Lyrics==

The most common modern version is:

&lt;poem&gt;Mary, Mary, quite contrary,
How does your garden grow?
With silver bells, and cockle shells,
And pretty maids all in a row.&lt;/poem&gt;

The oldest known version was first published in &quot;Tommy Thumb&#x27;s Pretty Song Book&quot; (1744) with the lyrics that are shown here:

&lt;poem&gt;Mistress Mary, Quite contrary,
How does your garden grow?
With Silver Bells, And Cockle Shells,
And so my garden grows.&lt;/poem&gt;

There is also a version in &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (1911) written by Frances Hodgson Burnett with these lyrics:

&lt;poem&gt;Mistress Mary, Quite Contrary,
How does your garden grow?
With Silver Bells and Cockles Shells
And Marigolds all in a row.&lt;/poem&gt;

Several printed versions of the 18th century have the lyrics:

&lt;poem&gt;Mistress Mary, Quite contrary,
How does your garden grow?
With Silver Bells, And Cockle Shells,
Sing cuckolds (cuckoos) all in a row.&lt;/poem&gt;

The last line has the most variation including:

Cowslips all in a row [sic].

and

With lady bells all in a row.

==Meaning==
No proof has been found that the rhyme was known before the 18th century, while Mary I of England (Mary Tudor) and Mary, Queen of Scots (Mary Stuart), were contemporaries in the 16th century.

Like many nursery rhymes, it has acquired various historical explanations. One theory is that it is a religious allegory of Catholicism, with Mary being Mary, the mother of Jesus, bells representing the sanctus bells, the cockleshells the badges of the pilgrims to the shrine of Saint James in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, and pretty maids are nuns, but even within this strand of thought there are differences of opinion as to whether it is lament for the reinstatement of Catholicism or its persecution. Another theory sees the rhyme as connected to Mary, Queen of Scots (1542–1587), with &quot;how does your garden grow&quot; referring to her reign over her realm, &quot;silver bells&quot; referring to (Catholic) cathedral bells, &quot;cockle shells&quot; insinuating that her husband was not faithful to her, and &quot;pretty maids all in a row&quot; referring to her ladies-in-waiting – &quot;The four Maries&quot;.

Mary has also been identified with Mary I of England (&quot;Bloody Mary&quot;; 1516–1558), with &quot;How does your garden grow?&quot; said to refer to her lack of heirs, or to the common idea that England had become a Catholic vassal or &quot;branch&quot; of Spain and the Habsburgs. It is also said to be a punning reference to her chief minister, Stephen Gardiner. &quot;Quite contrary&quot; is said to be a reference to her unsuccessful attempt to reverse ecclesiastical changes effected by her father Henry VIII and her brother Edward VI. The &quot;pretty maids all in a row&quot; is speculated to be a reference to miscarriages, her execution of Lady Jane Grey, or alternately to her executions of the Protestants.

<text>Marshal of the Royal Air Force Charles Frederick Algernon Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford, (21 May 1893 – 22 April 1971) was a senior Royal Air Force officer. He served as a bomber pilot in the First World War, and rose to become first a flight commander and then a squadron commander, flying light bombers on the Western Front.

In the early stages of the Second World War he was commander-in-chief of Bomber Command. He was an advocate of strategic area bombing against German industrial areas, and viewed it as a war winning strategy. In October 1940 he was made Chief of the Air Staff, and remained in this post for the rest of the war. During his time as Chief he continuously supported the strategic bombing offensive against Germany, and advocated the formation of the Pathfinder Force, critical to improving the destructive force of Bomber Command. He fended off attempts by the Royal Navy to take command over RAF Coastal Command, and resisted attempts by the British Army to establish their own Army Air Arm. Portal retired from the RAF following the end of the war. He served as Controller of Production (Atomic Energy) at the Ministry of Supply for six years. Portal was then made chairman of British Aluminium. He was unsuccessful in fending off a hostile takeover of British Aluminum by Sir Ivan Stedeford&#x27;s Tube Investments, in what was known as the &quot;Aluminium War&quot;. Afterward he served as chairman of the British Aircraft Corporation.

==Early life==
Portal was born at Eddington House, Hungerford, Berkshire, the son of Edward Robert Portal and his wife Ellinor Kate (née Hill). His younger brother Admiral Sir Reginald Portal (1894–1983) joined the Royal Navy and also had a distinguished career. The Portals had Huguenot origins, having arrived in England in the 17th century. He was related to the goldsmith and dramatist Abraham Portal, and more distantly so to Wyndham Portal, 1st Viscount Portal.

Charles Portal, or &quot;Peter&quot; as he was nicknamed, was educated at Winchester College and Christ Church, Oxford. Portal had intended to become a barrister but he did not finish his degree and he left undergraduate life to enlist as a private soldier in 1914.

==First World War==
At the beginning of the First World War, Portal joined the British Army and served as a dispatch rider in the motorcycle section of the Royal Engineers on the Western Front. Portal was made a corporal very soon after joining the Army and he was commissioned as a second lieutenant only weeks later. Around the same time, Portal was commended in Sir John French&#x27;s first despatch of September 1914. In December 1914, Portal was given command of all riders in the 1st Corps Headquarters Signals Company.

In July 1915, with the need for dispatch riders decreasing, Portal transferred to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). He served first as an observer and then, from November 1915, as a flying officer. He graduated as a pilot in April 1916, and joined No. 60 Squadron flying Morane biplanes on the Western Front. He became a flight commander with No. 3 Squadron flying BE2c aircraft on the Western Front on 16 July 1916. Portal was promoted to temporary major in June 1917 and given command of No. 16 Squadron flying RE8 aircraft on the Western Front at the same time. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel on 17 June 1918 and given command of No. 24 (Training) Wing at RAF Grantham in August 1918. Portal was awarded the Military Cross in January 1917, the citation for which reads:

He was also awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 18 July 1917 and a Bar to his DSO on 18 July 1918. The DSO&#x27;s citation reads:

The bar&#x27;s citation:

==Inter-war career==
In August 1919 Portal was appointed to a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force in the rank of major (shortly afterwards redesignated as a squadron leader). He became a chief flying instructor at the Royal Air Force College Cranwell in November 1919 and then attended RAF Staff College in 1922, before joining the air staff conducting flying operations in the home sector in April 1923. Promoted to wing commander on 1 July 1925, he attended the senior officers&#x27; war course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, in 1926 before taking over No. 7 Squadron flying Vickers Virginia bombers in March 1927 and concentrated on improving bombing accuracy.

Portal attended the Imperial Defence College in 1929 and became deputy director of Plans in the Directorate of Operations &amp; Intelligence at the Air Ministry in December 1930. Promoted to group captain on 1 July 1931, he was appointed commander of British forces in Aden in February 1934, in which role he tried to control the local tribesmen by use of an air blockade. Promoted to air commodore on 1 January 1935, he joined the Directing Staff at the Imperial Defence College in January 1936. Portal was promoted to air vice-marshal on 1 July 1937 before being appointed Director of Organization at the Air Ministry on 1 September 1937.

==Second World War==

Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1939 New Year Honours, Portal became Air Member for Personnel on the Air Council on 1 February 1939. He was promoted to the acting rank of air marshal on 3 September 1939, appointed commander-in-chief of Bomber Command in April 1940 and promoted to the substantive rank of air marshal on 1 July 1940. Portal advocated strategic area bombing against German industrial areas, the same sort of targets that the Luftwaffe was already targeting in the United Kingdom. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1940 Birthday Honours.

On 25 October 1940, Portal was appointed as Chief of the Air Staff with the temporary rank of air chief marshal (made permanent in April 1942). He continued in this capacity for the remainder of the war. The first issue he had to resolve was an attempt by the Royal Navy to take over RAF Coastal Command as well as an attempt by the British Army to establish their own Army Air Arm. Portal successfully persuaded both the Army and the Navy that the RAF could adequately look after their needs. The second issue Portal had to resolve was the need for a renewed strategic bombing offensive. In August 1941 he received a report on the relative inefficiency of RAF daytime raids and proposals for area bombing by night: to implement the proposals he determined that a new leader was required and replaced the chief of bomber command, Air Chief Marshal Richard Peirse, with Arthur Harris. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1942 Birthday Honours.

Portal accompanied Churchill to all the great conferences and made a good impression on Americans. In January 1943, at the Casablanca Conference, the Combined Chiefs of Staff selected him to coordinate the bomber forces of both the United States and Britain in a combined bomber offensive over Germany. The forces were transferred to U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower for the duration of Operation Overlord; but when their control reverted to the Combined Chiefs, Portal still advocated area bombing of German cities instead of specific targets, such as Axis oil production facilities. He was promoted to Marshal of the Royal Air Force on 1 January 1944.

In early 1944, Portal&#x27;s view of strategic bombing changed; he felt that bombers could also play a more auxiliary role in the allied offensive. (Much of what is known about Portal&#x27;s thinking is based on memoranda he wrote.) He argued for the new approach on the basis of the huge increase in the size of the bomber force, which would carry out not just precision bombing but also indiscriminate area bombing by night of all German cities with populations exceeding 100,000. Portal thought that the resulting damage to the German war effort and civilian morale would lead to victory within six months. A second memorandum in 1945 made a similar argument.

In March 1945, Churchill gave the final order to stop Portal&#x27;s strategy of area bombing, after the firestorm of Dresden a few weeks earlier. Churchill subsequently distanced himself from the bombing writing that &quot;the destruction of Dresden remains a serious query against the conduct of Allied Bombing&quot;.

==Post-war activities==
In 1945, after the war&#x27;s end, Portal retired from the RAF and on 12 October 1945 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Portal of Hungerford in the County of Berkshire, with remainder, failing male issue of his own, to his daughters and their male heirs. On 8 February 1946 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Portal of Hungerford, in the County of Berkshire, with normal remainder to his heirs male. He was made a Member of the Order of Merit on 1 January 1946. He was also awarded the American Distinguished Service Medal on 15 March 1946 and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Dutch Order of Orange-Nassau on 18 November 1947. He was also appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Belgian Order of the Crown with Palm and awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre, 1940, with Palm on 27 August 1948.

From 1946 to 1951, Portal was Controller of Production (Atomic Energy) at the Ministry of Supply. Christopher Hinton, responsible for the production of fissile material, said later, &quot;I cannot remember that he ever did anything that helped us.&quot; He attended the funeral of King George VI in February 1952 and the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953.

Portal was elected Chairman of British Aluminium and in 1958/1959 he fought in the City of London&#x27;s &quot;Aluminium War&quot; against a hostile takeover bid by Sir Ivan Stedeford, chairman and chief executive of Tube Investments. T.I. along with its ally Reynolds Metals of the US, won the takeover battle, and in the process, rewrote the way the city of London conducted its business in relation to shareholders and investors. Stedeford replaced Portal as Chairman of British Aluminium. In 1960 Portal was elected chairman of the British Aircraft Corporation. Portal died from cancer at his home at West Ashling near Chichester on 22 April 1971. His ashes are buried near his home in Funtington churchyard.

==Family==
In July 1919, Portal married Joan Margaret Welby (1898–1996); they had a son (who died at birth) and two daughters. The viscountcy died with him but he was succeeded in the barony according to the special remainder by his elder daughter, Rosemary Ann, who died in 1990.

<text>The Red Orchestra (, ) was the name given by the Abwehr Section III.F to anti-Nazi resistance workers in Germany in August 1941. It primarily referred to a loose network of resistance groups, connected through personal contacts, uniting hundreds of opponents of the Nazi regime. These included groups of friends who held discussions that were centred on Harro Schulze-Boysen, Adam Kuckhoff and Arvid Harnack in Berlin, alongside many others. They printed and distributed prohibited leaflets, posters, and stickers, hoping to incite civil disobedience. They aided Jews and resistance to escape the regime, documented the atrocities of the Nazis, and transmitted military intelligence to the Allies. Contrary to legend, the Red Orchestra was neither directed by Soviet communists nor under a single leadership. It was a network of groups and individuals, often operating independently. To date, about 400 members are known by name.

The term was also used by the German Abwehr to refer to associated Soviet intelligence networks, working in Belgium, France, United Kingdom and the low countries, that were built up by Leopold Trepper on behalf of the Main Directorate of State Security (GRU). Trepper ran a series of clandestine cells for organising agents. He used the latest technology, in the form of small wireless radios, to communicate with Soviet intelligence.

Although the monitoring of the radios&#x27; transmissions by the Funkabwehr would eventually lead to the organisation&#x27;s destruction, the sophisticated use of the technology enabled the organisation to behave as a network, with the ability to achieve tactical surprise and deliver high-quality intelligence, including the warning of Operation Barbarossa.

To this day, the German public perception of the &quot;Red Orchestra&quot; is characterised by the vested interest in historical revisionism of the post-war years and propaganda efforts of both sides of the Cold War.

==Reappraisal==
For a long time after World War II, only parts of the German resistance to Nazism had been known to the public within Germany and the world at large. This included the groups that took part in the 20 July plot and the White Rose resistance groups. In the 1970s there was a growing interest in the various forms of resistance and opposition. However, no organisation&#x27;s history was so subject to systematic misinformation, and as little recognised, as those resistance groups centred on Arvid Harnack and Harro Schulze-Boysen.

In a number of publications, the groups that these two people represented were seen as traitors and spies. An example of these was &quot;Kennwort: Direktor; die Geschichte der Roten Kapelle&quot; (&quot;Password: Director; The history of the Red Orchestra&quot;) written by Heinz Höhne who was a Der Spiegel journalist. Höhne based his book on the investigation by the Lüneburg Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office against the General Judge of the Luftwaffe and Nazi apologist Manfred Roeder who was involved in the Harnack and Schulze-Boysen cases during World War II and who contributed decisively to the formation of the legend that survived for much of the Cold War period. In his book Höhne reports from former Gestapo and Reich war court individuals who had a conflict of interest and were intent on defaming the groups attached to Harnack and Schulze-Boysen with accusations of treason.

The perpetuation of the defamation from the 1940s through to the 1970s that started with the Gestapo was incorporated by the Lüneburg Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office and evaluated as a journalistic process that can be seen by the 1968 trial of Nazi judge turned far-right Holocaust denier Manfred Roeder by the German lawyer Robert Kempner. The Frankfurt public prosecutor&#x27;s office, which prosecuted the case against Roeder, based its investigation on procedure case number &quot;1 Js 16/49&quot; which was the trial case number defined by the Lüneburg Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office. The whole process propagated the Gestapo ideas of the Red Orchestra and this was promulgated in the report of the public prosecutor&#x27;s office which stated:

In the course of time, a group of political supporters of different characters and backgrounds gathered around these two men and their wives. They were united in their active opposition to National Socialism and in their support for communism (emphasis added by the author). Until the outbreak of war with the Soviet Union, the focus of their work was on domestic policy. After that, it shifted more to the field of treason and espionage in favour of the Soviet Union. At the beginning of 1942, the Schulze-Boysen group was finally integrated into the widely ramified network of Soviet intelligence in Western Europe. The value of the intelligence passed on by the Schulze-Boysen group to the Soviet intelligence service cannot be underestimated according to general judgement. All persons who had to deal with this material in their official capacity agree that it was the most dangerous treason organisation uncovered during World War II... In no... case, however, it is certain that those convicted were only sentenced for high treason and favouring the enemy. The Schulze-Boysen group was first and foremost a spy organisation for the Soviet Union. Since the outbreak of war with Russia, internal resistance took a back seat to espionage work, and it can be assumed that all members were used directly or indirectly for intelligence gathering.

From the perspective of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) the Red Orchestra were honoured as anti-fascist resistance fighters and indeed received posthumous orders in 1969. Accordingly, the most comprehensive collection of biographies that exist are from the GDR, by Karl Heinz Biernat and Luise Kraushaar &quot;Die Schulze- Boysen- Harnack- Organisation im antifaschistischen Kampf&quot; (2002) and they represent their point of view, through the lens of ideology.

In the 1980s, the GDR historian Heinrich Scheel, who at the time was vice president of the East German Academy of Sciences and who was part of the anti-Nazi Tegeler group (named after the area they met in, in Berlin) that included Hans Coppi from 1933, conducted research into the Rote Kapelle and produced a paper which took a more nuanced view of the Rote Kapelle and discovered the work that was done to defame them. Scheel&#x27;s work led to a re-evaluation of the Rote Kapelle, but it was not until 2009 that the German Bundestag overturned the judgments of the National Socialist judiciary for &quot;treason&quot; and rehabilitated the members of the group.

==Name==

The name &quot;Rote Kapelle&quot; was a cryptonym that was invented for a secret operation started by Abwehrstelle Belgium (Ast Belgium), a field office of Abwehr III.F in August 1941 and conducted against a Soviet intelligence station that had been detected in Brussels in June 1941. &quot;Kapelle&quot; was an accepted Abwehr term for counter-espionage operations against secret wireless transmitting stations and in the case of the Brussels stations &quot;Rote&quot; was used to differentiate from other enterprises conducted by Ast Belgium.

In July 1942, the case of the &quot;Red Orchestra&quot; was taken over from Ast Belgium by section IV. A.2. of the Sicherheitsdienst. When Soviet agent Anatoly Gurevich was arrested in November 1942, a small independent unit made up of Gestapo personnel known as the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle was formed in Paris in the same month and led by SS-Obersturmbannführer (Colonel) Friedrich Panzinger.

The Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA), the counter-espionage part of the Schutzstaffel (SS), referred to resistance radio operators as &quot;pianists&quot;, their transmitters as &quot;pianos&quot;, and their supervisors as &quot;conductors&quot;.

Only after the funkabwehr had decrypted radio messages in August 1942, in which German names appeared, did the Gestapo start to arrest and imprison them, their friends and relatives. In 2002, the German filmmaker Stefan Roloff, whose father Helmut Roloff was a member of one of the Red Orchestra groups, stated of them:

::&quot;Because of their contact with the Soviets, the Brussels and Berlin groups were grouped together by the Counterintelligence and Gestapo, under the misleading name of the Rote Kapelle. A radio operator who tapped Morse code characters with his fingers was a pianist in the secret service language. A group of &quot;pianists&quot; formed a &quot;band&quot;, and since the Morse code had come from Moscow, the &quot;orchestra&quot; was communist and therefore red. This misunderstanding laid the foundation on which the resistance group would later be treated as a Soviet espionage organisation, until this could be corrected in the early 1990s. The construct of a Red Orchestra organization, created by the Gestapo never existed as such&quot;

In his research, the historian Hans Coppi Jr., whose father was also a member, Hans Coppi, emphasised that, in view of the Western European groups:

:&quot;..a &#x27;Red Orchestra&#x27; network in Western Europe, led by Leopold Trepper did not exist. The various groups in Belgium, Holland and France worked largely independently of one another.&quot;

The German political scientist Johannes Tuchel summed up in a research article for the Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand.

:&quot;The Gestapo identifies it under the collective name &quot;Red Orchestra&quot; and wants it to be viewed above all as an espionage organization of the Soviet Union. This designation, which reduces the groups around Harnack and Schulze-Boysen to contacts with the Soviet intelligence service, continues to shape the public image in Germany also after 1945, distorting their motives and goals, even after 1945. At the end of 1942, the Reich Court Martial passes the first death sentences; in total, more than fifty members of this group are murdered. &quot;

==Germany==
===Schulze-Boysen/Harnack group===
The Red Orchestra, as historically viewed in the world today, are mainly the resistance groups around the Luftwaffe officer Harro Schulze-Boysen, the writer Adam Kuckhoff and the economist Arvid Harnack, to which historians assign more than 100 people.

===Origin===
Harnack and Schulze-Boysen had similar political views, both rejected the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, and sought alternatives to the existing social order. Since the Great Depression of 1929, they saw the Soviet planned economy as a positive counter-model to the free-market economy. They wanted to introduce planned economic elements in Germany and work closely with the Soviet Union without breaking German bridges to the rest of Europe.

Before 1933, Schulze-Boysen published the non-partisan leftist and later banned magazine . In April 1933, the Sturmabteilung detained him for some time, severely battered him, and killed a fellow Jewish inmate. As a trained pilot, he received a position of trust in 1934 in the Reich Ministry of Aviation and had access to war-important information. After his marriage to Libertas Schulze-Boysen in 1936, the couple collected young intellectuals from diverse backgrounds, including the artist couple Kurt and Elisabeth Schumacher, the writers Günther Weisenborn and Walter Küchenmeister, the photojournalist John Graudenz (who had been expelled from the USSR for reporting the Soviet famine of 1932–1933) and Gisela von Pöllnitz, the actor Marta Husemann and her husband Walter in 1938, the doctors Elfriede Paul in 1937 and John Rittmeister in Christmas 1941, the dancer Oda Schottmüller, and since Schulze-Boysen held twice-monthly meetings at his Charlottenburg atelier for thirty-five to forty people in what was considered a Bohemian circle of friends. Initially, these meetings followed an informatics program of resistance that was in keeping with its environment and were important places of personal and political understanding but also vanishing points from an often unbearable reality, essentially serving as &quot;islands of democracy&quot;. As the decade progressed they increasingly served as identity-preserving forms of self-assertion and cohesion as the Nazi state became all-encompassing. Formats of the meetings usually started with book discussions in the first 90 minutes, were followed by Marxist discussions and resistance activities, and were interspersed with parties, picnics, sailing on the Wannsee and poetry readings until midnight as the mood took. However, as the realisation that the war preparations were becoming unstoppable and the future victors were not going to be the Sturmabteilung, Schulze-Boysen, whose decisions were in demand, called for the group to cease their discussions and start resisting.

Other friends were found by Schulze-Boysen among former students of a reform school on the island of Scharfenberg in Berlin-Tegel. These often came from communist or social – democratic workers&#x27; families, e.g. Hans and Hilde Coppi, Heinrich Scheel, Hermann Natterodt and Hans and Ina Lautenschlager. Some of these contacts existed before 1933, for example through the German &quot;Society of intellectuals&quot;. John Rittmeister&#x27;s wife Eva was a good friend of Liane Berkowitz, Ursula Goetze, Friedrich Rehmer, Maria Terwiel and Fritz Thiel who met in the 1939 abitur class at the secondary private school, &quot;Heil&#x27;schen Abendschule&quot; at Berlin W 50, Augsburger Straße 60 in Schöneberg. The Romanist Werner Krauss joined this group, and through discussions, an active resistance to the Nazi regime grew. Ursula Goetze who was part of the group, provided contacts with the communist groups in Neukölln.

From 1932 onwards, the economist Arvid Harnack and his American wife Mildred assembled a group of friends and members of the Berlin Marxist Workers School (MASCH) to form a discussion group that debated the political and economic perspectives at the time. Harnak&#x27;s group meetings, in contrast to those of Schulze-Boysen&#x27;s group, were considered rather austere. Members of the group included the German politician and Minister of Culture Adolf Grimme, the locksmith Karl Behrens, the German journalist Adam Kuckhoff and his wife Greta and the industrialist and entrepreneur Leo Skrzypczynski. From 1935, Harnack tried to camouflage his activities by becoming a member of the Nazi Party working in the Reich Ministry of Economics with the rank of Oberregierungsrat. Through this work, Harnack planned to train them to build a free and socially just Germany after the end of the National Socialism&#x27; regime.

The dancer Oda Schottmüller and Erika Gräfin von Brockdorff were friends with the Kuckhoffs. In 1937 Adam Kuckhoff introduced Harnack to the journalist and former journalist railway worker John Sieg, a former editor of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) newspaper the Die Rote Fahne. As a railway worker at the Deutsche Reichsbahn, Sieg was able to make use of work-related travel, enabling him to found a communist resistance group in the Neukölln borough in Berlin. He knew the former Foreign Affairs Minister Wilhelm Guddorf and Martin Weise. In 1934 Guddorf was arrested and sentenced to hard labour. In 1939 after his release from the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, Guddorf worked as a bookseller, and worked closely with Schulze-Boysen.

This network grew up after Adam and Greta Kuckhoff introduced Harro and Libertas Schulze-Boysen to Arvid and Mildred Harnack, and the couples began engaging socially. Their hitherto separate groups moved together once the Polish campaign began in September 1939. From 1940 onwards, they regularly exchanged their opinions on the war and other Nazi policies and sought action against it. Through such contacts, a loose network formed in Berlin in the early weeks of 1942, of seven interconnected groups centred on personal friendships as well as groups originally formed for discussion and education. This disparate network was composed of over 150 Berlin Nazi opponents, including artists, scientists, citizens, workers, and students from several different backgrounds. There were Communists, political conservatives, Jews, Catholics, and atheists. Their ages ranged from 16 to 86, and about 40% of the group were women. Group members had different political views, but searched for the open exchange of views, at least in the private sector. For instance, Schulze-Boysen and Harnack shared some ideas with the Communist Party of Germany, while others were devout Catholics such as Maria Terwiel and her husband Helmut Himpel. Uniting all of them was the firm rejection of national socialism.

The historian Heinrich Scheel, a schoolmate of Hans Coppi, judged these groups by stating:

:&quot; Only with this stable hinterland was it possible to survive all the minor mishaps and major catastrophes and give our resistance permanence.&quot;

As early as 1934, Scheel had passed written material from one contact person to the next within clandestine communist cells and had seen how easily such connections were lost if a meeting did not materialise due to one party being arrested. In a relaxed group of friends and discussion with like-minded people, it was easy to find supporters for an action.

===Acts of resistance===

From 1933 onwards, the Berlin groups connected to Schulze-Boysen and Harnack resisted the Nazis by:

* Providing assistance to the persecuted.
* Disseminating pamphlets and leaflets that contained dissident content.
* Writing letters to prominent individuals including university professors.
* Collecting and sharing information, including on foreign representatives, on German war preparations, crimes of the Wehrmacht and Nazi crimes.
* Contacting other opposition groups and foreign forced labourers.
* Invoking disobedience of Nazi representatives.
* Writing drafts for a possible post-war order.

From mid-1936, the Spanish Civil War preoccupied the Schulze-Boysen group. Through Walter Küchenmeister, the Schulze-Boysen group began to discuss more concrete actions, and during these meetings would listen to foreign radio stations from London, Paris and Moscow. A plan was formed to take advantage of Schulze-Boysen&#x27;s employment, and through this, the group was able to get detailed information on Germany&#x27;s support of Francisco Franco. Beginning in 1937, in the Wilmersdorf waiting room of Dr. Elfriede Paul, they began distributing the first leaflet on the Spanish Civil War. 

In the same year, Schulze-Boysen had compiled a document about a sabotage enterprise planned in Barcelona by the Wehrmacht &quot;Special Staff W&quot;, an organisation established by Helmuth Wilberg to analyse the tactical lessons learned by the &quot;Legion Kondor&quot; during the war. The information that Schulze-Boysen collected included details about German transports, deployment of units and companies involved in the German defense. Libertas&#x27;s cousin, Gisela von Pöllnitz placed the letter in the mailbox of the Soviet Embassy on the Bois de Boulogne in Paris.

After the Munich Agreement, Schulze-Boysen created a second leaflet with Walter Küchenmeister, that declared the annexation of the Sudetenland in October 1938 as a further step on the way to a new world war. This leaflet was called &quot;Der Stoßtrupp&quot; or &quot;The Raiding Patrol&quot;, and condemned the Nazi government and argued against the government&#x27;s propaganda. A document that was used at the trial of Schulze-Boysen indicated that only 40 to 50 copies of the leaflet were distributed.

===Call for popular uprising===
====AGIS leaflets====
From 1942 onwards, the group started to produce leaflets that were signed with &quot;AGIS&quot; in reference to the Spartan King Agis IV, who fought against corruption for his people. Naming the newspaper &quot;Agis&quot;, was originally a name chosen by Libertas Schulze-Boysen. The pamphlets had titles like, &quot;The becoming of the Nazi movement&quot;, &quot;Call for opposition&quot;, &quot;Freedom and violence&quot; and &quot;Appeal to All Callings and Organisations to resist the government&quot;. The writing of the AGIS leaflet series was a mix of Schulze-Boysen and Walter Küchenmeister, a communist political writer, who would often include copy from KPD members and through contacts.

They were often left in phone booths or selected addresses from the phone book. Extensive precautions were taken, including wearing gloves, using many different typewriters and destroying the carbon paper. John Graudenz also produced, running duplicate mimeograph machines in the apartment of Anna Krauss.

On 15 February 1942, the group wrote the large 6-page pamphlet called &quot;Die Sorge Um Deutschlands Zukunft geht durch das Volk!&quot; (&quot;Anxiety about Germany&#x27;s future is moving through the people!&quot;). The master copy was arranged by the potter Cato Bontjes van Beek and the pamphlet was written up by Maria Terwiel on her typewriter, five copies at a time. The paper describes how the care of Germany&#x27;s future is decided by the people... and called for the opposition to the war, the Nazis, all Germans who now threaten the future of all. A copy survives to the present day.

The text first analysed the current situation: contrary to the Nazi propaganda, most German armies were in retreat, the number of war dead was in the millions. Inflation, scarcity of goods, plant closures, labour agitation and corruption in State authorities were occurring all the time. Then the text examined German war crimes:

:&quot;But the conscience of all true patriots rebels against the whole current form of German exercise of power in Europe. All who have retained their sense of genuine values see with a shudder how the good name of Germany is falling into disrepute under the swastika symbol. In all occupied countries today, hundreds, often thousands, of people are shot or hanged arbitrarily, without due process, people who can be accused of nothing other than of being loyal to their country [...] In the name of the Reich the most hideous tortures and atrocities are committed against civilians and prisoners. Never yet in history has a man been so hated as Adolf Hitler. The hatred of tortured humanity burdens the entire German people&quot;

=====The Soviet Paradise exhibition=====
In May 1942, Joseph Goebbels held a Nazi propaganda exhibition with the ironic name of The Soviet Paradise (German original title &quot;Das Sowjet-Paradies&quot;) in Lustgarten, with the express purpose of justifying the invasion of the Soviet Union to the German people.

Both the Harnacks and Kuckhoffs spent half a day at the exhibition. For Greta Kuckhoff particularly and her friends, the most distressing aspect of the exhibition was the installation about SS measures against Russian &quot;partisans&quot; (Soviet partisans). The exhibition contained images of firing squads and bodies of young girls, some still children, who had been hung and were dangling from ropes. The group decided to act. It was Fritz Thiel and his wife Hannelore who printed stickers using a child&#x27;s toy rubber stamp kit. In a campaign initiated by John Graudenz on 17 May 1942, Schulze-Boysen, Marie Terwiel and nineteen others, mostly people from the group around Rittmeister, travelled across five Berlin neighbourhoods to paste the stickers over the original exhibition posters with the message:
: Permanent Exhibition
: The Nazi Paradise
: War, Hunger, Lies, Gestapo
: How much longer?

The Harnacks were dismayed at Schulze-Boysen&#x27;s actions and decided not to participate in the exploit, believing it to be reckless and unnecessarily dangerous.

On 18 May, Herbert Baum, a Jewish communist who had contact with the Schulze-Boysen group through Walter Husemann, delivered incendiary bombs to the exhibition in the hope of destroying it. Although 11 people were injured, the whole episode was covered up by the government, and the action lead to the arrest of 250 Jews including Baum himself. Following the action, Harnack asked the Kuckoffs to revisit the exhibition to determine whether any damage had been done to it, but they found little damage was visible.

===Acts of espionage===
The Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, was seen as the beginning of the feared world war, but also as an opportunity to eliminate Nazi rule and to invoke a thorough transformation of German society. Hitler&#x27;s victories in France and Norway in 1940 encouraged them to expect the replacement of the Nazi regime, above all from the Soviet Union, not from Western capitalism. They believed that the Soviet Union would keep Germany as a sovereign state after its victory and that they wanted to work towards a corresponding opposition without domination by the Communist Party of Germany.

Around 13 June 1941, Harro Schulze-Boysen prepared a report that gave the final details of the Soviet invasion including details of Hungarian airfields containing German planes. On 17 June, the People&#x27;s Commissariat for State Security presented the report to Stalin, who harshly dismissed it as disinformation.

In December 1941, John Sieg published &quot;The Home Front&quot; (German:Die Innere Front) on a regular basis. It contained texts by Walter Husemann, Fritz Lange, Martin Weise and Herbert Grasse, including information about the economic situation in Europe, references to Moscow radio frequencies, and calls for resistance. It was produced in several languages for foreign forced labourers in Germany. Only one copy from August 1942 has survived. After the attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, Hilde Coppi had secretly listened to Moscow radio in order to receive signs of life from German prisoners of war and to forward them to their relatives via Heinrich Scheel. This news contradicted the Nazi propaganda that the Red Army would murder all German soldiers who surrendered. In order to educate them about propaganda lies and Nazi crimes, the group copied and sent letters to soldiers on the Eastern Front, addressed to a fictitious police officer.

In autumn 1941 the eyewitness Erich Mirek reported to Walter Husemann about mass murders of Jews by the SS and SD in Pinsk. The group announced these crimes in their letters.

The Berlin group undoubtedly provided valuable intelligence to the Soviet Union. However, a Soviet memo dated 25 November 1941 and recently discovered by Shareen Blair Brysac, details the organisational problems in evaluating the intelligence. Reports were forwarded to Lavrentiy Beria, who was unable to act on their contents, which resulted in the Red Army being unable to form a cogent response. Ultimately, the groups&#x27; efforts had no effect on Soviet military strategy.

===The von Scheliha Group===
The cavalry officer, diplomat and later resistance fighter Rudolf von Scheliha was recruited by Soviet intelligence while in Warsaw in 1934. Although a member of the Nazi party since 1938, he took an increasingly critical stance against the Nazi regime by 1938 at the latest. He became an informant to journalist Rudolf Herrnstadt. Intelligence from von Scheliha would be sent to Herrnstadt, via the cutout Ilse Stöbe, who would then pass it to the Soviet embassy in Warsaw. In September 1939, Scheliha was appointed director of an &quot;information department&quot; in the Foreign Office, that was created to counter foreign press and radio news by creating propaganda about the German occupation policy in Poland. This necessitated a move back to Berlin, and Stöbe followed, attaining a position arranged by von Scheliha in the &quot;press section&quot; of the Foreign Office, that enabled her to pass documents from von Scheliha to a representative of TASS.

Von Scheliha&#x27;s position in the &quot;information department&quot; exposed him to reports and images of Nazi atrocities, enabling him to verify the veracity of foreign reports of Nazi officials. By 1941, von Scheliha had become increasingly dissatisfied with the Nazi regime and began to resist by collaborating with Henning von Tresckow. Scheliha secretly made a collection of documents on the atrocities of the Gestapo, and in particular, on murders of Jews in Poland, documents which also contained photographs of newly established extermination camps. He informed his friends first before later attempting to notify the Allies, including a trip to Switzerland with information on &quot;Aktion T4&quot; that was shared with Swiss diplomats. His later reports exposed the Final Solution. After Operation Barbarossa severed Soviet lines of communication in Berlin, Soviet intelligence made attempts to reconnect with Stöbe in May 1942, but the effort failed.

===Individuals and small groups===
Other small groups and individuals, who knew little or nothing about each other, each resisted the National Socialists in their own way until the Gestapo arrested them and treated them as a common espionage organisation from 1942 to 1943.

* Kurt Gerstein
: Kurt Gerstein was a German SS officer who had twice been sent to concentration camps in 1938 due to close links with the Confessional Church and had been expelled from the Nazi Party. As a mine manager and industrialist, Gerstein was convinced that he could resist by exerting influence inside the Nazi administration. On 10 March 1941, when he heard about the German euthanasia program Aktion T4, he joined the SS. Assigned to the Hygiene-Institut der Waffen-SS (Institute for Hygiene of the Waffen-SS), he was ordered by the RSHA to supply prussic acid to the Nazis. Gerstein set about finding methods to dilute the acid, but his main aim was to report the euthanasia programme to his friends. In August 1942, after attending a gassing using a diesel engine exhaust from a car, he informed the Swedish embassy in Berlin of what happened.

* Willy Lehmann
: Willy Lehmann was a communist sympathiser who was recruited by the Soviet NKVD in 1929 and became one of their most valuable agents. In 1932 Lehmann joined the Gestapo and reported to the NKVD the complete work of the Gestapo. In 1935 Lehmann attended a rocket engine ground firing test in Kummersdorf that was attended by Wernher von Braun. From this Lehmann sent six pages of data to Stalin on 17 December 1935. Through Lehmann, Stalin also learned about the power struggles in the Nazi party, rearmament work and even the date of Operation Barbarossa. In October 1942 Lehmann was discovered by the Gestapo and murdered without trial. Lehmann had no connection to the Schulze-Boysen or Harnack group.

==Belgium==

===The Trepper Group===
Belgium was a favourite place for Soviet espionage to establish operations before World War II as it was geographically close to the centre of Europe, provided good commercial opportunities between Belgium and the rest of Europe and most important of all, the Belgian government was indifferent to foreign espionage operations that were conducted as long as they were against foreign powers and not Belgium itself. The first Soviet agents to arrive in Belgium were technicians. The Red Army agent, communist agitator and radio specialist Johann Wenzel arrived in January 1936, to establish a base. However, the Belgian authorities refused him permission to remain, so he moved to the Netherlands in early 1937, where he made contact with Daniël Goulooze, who was director of the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN) and who acted as the main liaison officer between the CPN and the Communist International in Moscow.

Leopold Trepper was an agent of the Red Army Intelligence and had been working with Soviet intelligence since 1930. Trepper along with Soviet military intelligence officer, Richard Sorge were the two main Soviet agents in Europe and were employed as &quot;roving agents&quot; setting up espionage networks in Europe and Japan. Whereas Richard Sorge was a penetration agent, Trepper ran a series of clandestine cells for organising agents. Trepper used the latest technology, in the form of small wireless radios to communicate with Soviet intelligence. Although the monitoring of the radios transmissions by the Funkabwehr would eventually lead to the organisations destruction, the sophisticated use of the technology-enabled the organisation to behave as a network.

During the 1930s, Trepper had worked to create a large pool of informal intelligence sources, through contacts with the French Communist Party. In 1936, Trepper became the technical director of Soviet Red Army Intelligence in Western Europe. He was responsible for recruiting agents and creating espionage networks. During early 1938, he was sent to Brussels to establish commercial cover for a spy network in France and the Low Countries. In the autumn of 1938, Trepper approached a Jewish businessman and former Comintern agent Léon Grossvogel, whom he had known in Palestine. Grossvogel ran a small business called &quot;Le Roi du Caoutchouc&quot; or &quot;The Raincoat King&quot; on behalf of its owners. Trepper had a plan to use money that had been provided to him, to create a business that would be the export division of &quot;The Raincoat King&quot;. The new business was given an unidiomatic name of Foreign Excellent Raincoat Company. Trepper&#x27;s plan was to wait until the company gained market share, and then when it was of sufficient size, infiltrate it with communist personal in positions such as shareholders, business managers and department heads. On 6 March 1939, Trepper, now using the alias &quot;Adam Mikler&quot;, a wealthy Canadian businessman, moved, with his wife, to Brussels to make it his new base.

In March 1939, Trepper was joined by GRU agent Mikhail Makarov posing as &quot;Carlos Alamo&quot;, who was to provide expertise in forged documentation e.g. preparation of Kennkartes. However, Grossvogel had recruited Abraham Rajchmann, a criminal forger, to the group and thenceforth Makarov became a radio operator.
In July 1939, Trepper was joined in Brussels by GRU agent Anatoly Gurevich posing as the wealthy Uruguayan &quot;Vincente Sierra&quot; Gurevich has already completed his first operation by meeting Schulze-Boysen in order to reestablish him as an intelligence source and to arrange courier service. Gurevich&#x27;s original remit was to learn the operation of the raincoat company and establish a new store in Copenhagen.

====Wartime activity====
At the start of the war, Trepper had to revise his plans significantly. After the conquest of Belgium in May 1940, Trepper fled to Paris, leaving Gurevich responsible for the Belgium network. Gurevich, operating from a safehouse located at 101 Rue des Atrébates in Brussels, used Makarov as his wireless radio operator, Sophia Poznańska as his cipher clerk, Rita Arnould as a courier and housekeeper, and Isidor Springer, who worked as a courier between Gurevich and Trepper and as a recruiter. Gurevich&#x27;s main task was to transmit reports received from Harro Schulze-Boysen and Trepper. In June 1941, Trepper sent Anton Danilov to assist Makarov with radio transmissions. In October 1941, Gurevich visited Germany, to reestablish communications with the Shulze-Boysen/Harnack group and then to deliver a cipher key to Ilse Stöbe that was instead delivered to Kurt Schulze. In September or October 1941, Trepper ordered Rajchmann to join Gurevich as the group&#x27;s documentation expert. The last core member of the group was the courier, Malvina Gruber. Gruber specialised in couriering people, often across borders. Her main role with the group was as a courier between Rajchmann and Trepper and as an assistant to Rajchmann.

On 13 December 1941, the apartment at Rue Des Atrebates was raided by the Abwehr. Gurevich was saved as Trepper warned him. All other members of the house were arrested. A complete photograhic laboratory, along with a quantity of counterfeit identify cards and plain-text and ciphered text were confiscated in the raid. During the following morning, Makarov was arrested returning to house with new messages to transmit.

===The Jeffremov Group===
This network was run by Soviet Army Captain Konstantin Jeffremov. He arrived in Brussels in March 1939 to organise various groups into a network. Jeffremov&#x27;s group was independent of Trepper&#x27;s group, although there were some members who worked for both and it was likely that by 1941, Jeffremov knew about Gurevich&#x27;s network.

Jeffremov&#x27;s most important agent, was the Belgian Edouard Van der Zypen, who worked at Henschel &amp; Son, a manufacturing company in Kassel that made aircraft and tanks. His other recruits were Maurice Peper and Elizabeth Depelsenaire. Peper was a professional radio operator who was recruited into the network in 1940 and became the main liaison between Belgium and Amsterdam. After the reorganisation, he worked as the cutout between Jeffremov and Rajchmann. Depelsenaire was responsible for her own sub-group, that provided safe accommodation in the Brussels area. Anton Winterink worked for Jeffremov for most of 1940 in Brussels but made frequent trips to the Netherlands where he established another network. Later in 1940, Jeffremov ordered Winterink to take charge of the network, that became known as group &quot;Hilda&quot;. By December 1940, both Wenzel in Belgium and Winterink in the Netherlands had established a radio link with Moscow, that was being used to transmit intelligence provided by Jeffremov. In 1939, the married couple, Franz and Germaine Schneider were recruited by Jeffremov. The couple were members of the Communist Party of Belgium and had been running Communist International (Comintern) safe houses in Brussels. For a number of years Germaine Schneider was the most important of the two, working as a courier from 1939 to 1942 that involved extensive travel across the Low Countries. Before the war, she was Henry Robinson&#x27;s contact to Soviet agents in Great Britain. While she worked from Jeffremov, she couriered between Brussels and Paris.

In May 1942, as part of a reorganisation effort after the raid on the Rue des Atrebates safehouse, Trepper met Jeffremov in Brussels to instruct him to take over the running of the Belgian espionage network in the absence of Anatoly Gurevich who had run the network from July 1940 to December 1941. The most important aspect of Jeffremov&#x27;s new commission was to ensure the continued transmission of the intelligence they were receiving from the Schulze-Boysen/Harnack group. This information was forwarded to Soviet intelligence via a French Communist Party radio transmitter. Jeffremov was frequently admonished by Soviet intelligence for his lack of activity and slow production of quality intelligence. In May 1942, following Makarov&#x27;s arrest, Wenzel agreed to begin transmitting for Jeffremov and operated out of a safehouse at 12 Rue de Namur in Brussels.

On 30 July 1942, the house at 12 Rue de Namur was raided by the Abwehr and Wenzel was arrested. Germaine Schneider managed to warn Trepper, who warned Jeffremov, who managed to escape.

==Netherlands==
===Dutch Information Service===
In 1935, Dutch Comintern member Daniël Goulooze established the clandestine &quot;Dutch Information Service&quot; (DIS), an intelligence organisation to collect information for consumption by Soviet intelligence. In 1937, Goulooze was sent for intelligence training to the Soviet Union. When he returned, he became the main rezident () agent for the Netherlands. In the years leading up to the war, Goulooze had contacts with the KPD officials in Berlin and Comintern members in the Low Countries, France and Great Britain. In 1937, Goulooze established a wireless telegraphy connection between the Comintern in Amsterdam and the Soviet Union.

In October 1937, Johann Wenzel contacted Goulooze in Amsterdam and they discussed plans for the construction of a radio network in Belgium. At the end of 1938, Wenzel again visited Goulooze, to recruit Dutch national and Rote Hilfe member Anton Winterink. By September 1939, Wenzel had trained Winterink as a radio operator, in Brussels. Winterink subsequently became the radio operator for the Jeffremov group in Belgium. In the lead up to the war, Wenzel continued to recruit Dutch communists from Goulooze, for the Jeffremov group. In October 1939, Gurevich visited Goulooze to request help to build his espionage network in Belgium. Gurevich asked that a temporary wireless telegraphy link be established for his use, while he established his own wireless telegraphy link. This was used until January 1940.

As the war progressed and the other communist organisations were destroyed, the DIS became increasingly important to Soviet intelligence as the only organisation in Western Europe that could maintain contact with Soviet agents on the ground. Such was the level of communication Goulooze conducted with Soviet intelligence, that he maintained four separate and active wireless telegraphy sets and one in reserve.

===Knöchel Emigre group===
In 1940, it was decided by the Comintern that various KPD sections (Abschnittsleitungen) in Germany should be amalgamated into a single operational section, that was to be led by German KPD organiser Wilhelm Knöchel. The Comintern decided the planning stage for the operation would be done in Amsterdam. From mid-1940, Knöchel with the assistance of Goulooze began to train the emigre group of communists in the Netherlands, to work in Germany as political activists, informers and instructors. Goulooze was able to obtain blank identity cards, along with official stamps to enable the KPD members who were in hiding, to interact with CPN members in Amsterdam and to travel safely to Germany.

In January 1941, the first Comintern instructor travelled to Berlin, followed by Willi Seng, then Albert Kamradt and . On 9 January 1942, Knöchel travelled to Berlin. Goulooze arranged for everything that was published by the Comintern executive in Moscow, to be couriered to Knöchel in Berlin.

==France==

In Paris, Trepper&#x27;s assistants were Grossvogel and Polish Jew Hillel Katz, who was the group&#x27;s recruiter. Trepper contacted General Ivan Susloparov, Soviet Military attaché in the Vichy government, both in an attempt to reconnect with Soviet intelligence and locate another transmitter. Trepper came under the supervision of Susloparov who charged him with building an espionage network that targeted military intelligence. After passing his intelligence to Susloparov, Trepper started to organise a new cover company by recruiting Belgian businessman Nazarin Drailly. On 19 March 1941, Drailly became the main shareholder in the Simexco company, located in Brussels. Trepper also created a similar company in Paris that was known as Simex and was run by former Belgian diplomat Jules Jaspar along with French commercial director Alfred Corbin. Trepper who used the alias &quot;Jean Gilbert&quot;, a Frenchman was also a director of the firm. Both companies sold black market goods to the Germans but their best customer was Organisation Todt, the civil and military engineering organisation of Nazi Germany. The two firms gave Trepper access to industrialists and businessmen, but he was always careful to remain in the background in any deal but ensured that suitable questions were asked and that he dealt only with people in responsible positions.

Around 1930, Comintern agent Henry Robinson arrived in Paris and became the section leader for Switzerland, France, and Great Britain, to conduct intelligence gathering operations against France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and Great Britain. In 1930, Robinson became director of BB-Aparat (intelligence department) of the French Communist Party and the International Liaison Department (OMS) of the Comintern in Western Europe.

Towards the end of 1940 and during all of 1941, Trepper searched for a radio operator in France, as a backup communications link should Makarov be arrested. In the spring of 1941, the Polish couple, Harry and Mira Sokol were recruited and trained as radio operators by Leon Grossvogel.

In September 1941, on orders from Soviet intelligence, Trepper met with Robinson in Paris. While Trepper was an agent of Red Army intelligence, Robinson was a Comintern agent. Robinson and the Comintern had lost prestige with Stalin, who suspected it of deviating from Communist norms. Robinson was also suspected of being an agent of the Deuxième Bureau, so subsequently he was in ideological conflict with Soviet intelligence. Therefore, it was unusual for two senior agents to meet, but an exception was made as it was felt by Soviet intelligence that Robinson&#x27;s extensive contacts could help Trepper build his French networks.

Prior to September 1941, Robinson sent his intelligence via a cutout who took them to the Soviet Embassy in Paris, where they were conveyed by diplomatic pouch to the Soviet Union. After meeting Trepper, Robinson arranged to receive his messages via Makarov. When Makarov was arrested in December 1941, it resulted in a complete loss of communications for the Trepper and Robinson networks. Trepper was unable to make contact with Soviet intelligence until February 1942, when he learned from Robinson of a radio transmitter that was being run by the French Communist Party in Paris and was ordered to take charge of Robinson&#x27;s network.

The Sokols began transmitting in April 1942, in a house at Maisons-Laffitte, to the north of Paris. After the arrests in Belgium by the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle, the Sokols became the group&#x27;s sole radio operator. Because of the high volume of intelligence being sent, their transmissions were detected by the Funkabwehr. On the 9 June 1942, the Sokols were arrested at the house. After the Sokol&#x27;s arrest, Trepper switched to using Wenzel&#x27;s transmitter in Brussels. However, that connection only lasted slightly longer than one month, as Wenzel was arrested on 30 July 1942. Trepper then used a transmitter belonging to the French Communist Party, to forward his reports. Pierre and Lucienne Giraud were used to courier the reports between Grossvogel and the French Communist Party in Paris. In the autumn of 1942, Trepper authorised Grossvogel to establish a new station at a house in Le Pecq but the transmitter failed to work. The Gestapo arrived shortly after the group was established and discovered the transmitter buried in the garden.

In December 1942 Robinson was arrested in Paris by the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle. Trepper and Gurevich, were arrested on 9 November 1942 in Marseilles

===The seven networks===
Trepper directed seven networks in France and each had its own group leader with a focus on gathering a specific type of intelligence. Trepper constructed them in a manner so that they were independent, working in parallel with only the group leader having direct contact with Trepper. Regular meeting places were used for contact points at predetermined times and these could only be set by Trepper. This type of communication meant that Trepper could contact the group leader but not vice versa and stringent security measures were built in at every step. These were as follows:

==Switzerland==
===Rote Drei===
The Red Three (German: Rote Drei) was a Soviet espionage network that operated in Switzerland during and after World War II. It was perhaps the most important Soviet espionage network in the war, as they could work relatively undisturbed. The name &quot;Rote Drei&quot; was a German appellation, based on the number of transmitters or operators serving the network, and is perhaps misleading, as at times there were four, sometimes even five.

The head of the Soviet intelligence service was Maria Josefovna Poliakova, a Soviet 4th Department agent, who first arrived in Switzerland in 1937 to direct operations. The other important leader in the Switzerland group was Ursula Kuczynski, codenamed &quot;Sonia&quot;, a colonel of the GRU, who has been sent to Switzerland in late 1938, to recruit a new espionage network of agents that would infiltrate Germany. Poliakova passed control to the new director of the Soviet intelligence service in Switzerland, sometime between 1939 and 1940. The new director was Alexander Radó, codenamed &quot;Dora&quot;, who held the secret Red Army rank of Major General.

Radó formed several intelligence groups in France and Germany, before arriving in Switzerland in late 1936 with his family. In 1936 Radó formed Geopress, a news agency specialising in maps and geographic information as a cover for intelligence work, and after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the business began to flourish. In 1940, Radó met Alexander Foote, an English Soviet agent, who joined Ursula Kuczynski&#x27;s network in 1938, and who would become the most important radio operator for Radó&#x27;s network. In March 1942, Radó made contact with Rudolf Roessler who would become the most important source of information. Roessler was able to provide prompt access to the secrets of the German High Command. This included the pending details of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union and many more, over a period of two years. A 1949 study by MI5 concluded that Roessler was a true mercenary who demanded payments for his reports that ran into thousands of Swiss francs over the course of the war years. This resulted in Dübendorfer being continually short of money, as Soviet intelligence insisted the link be maintained.

Radó established three networks in Switzerland. The three main sources of information, in decreasing importance:

* The first network was run by Rachel Dübendorfer, codename &quot;Sissy&quot; and who had the most important contacts of the three subgroups. Dübendorfer received intelligence reports from Rudolf Roessler (&quot;Lucy&quot;) via the cutout, Christian Schneider. Dübendorfer passed the reports to Radó who passed them to Foote for transmission. Roessler in turn received the information from sources whose aliases were named &quot;Werther&quot;, &quot;Teddy&quot;, &quot;Olga&quot;, and &quot;Anna&quot;.
* The second network was run by the French journalist Georges Blun (&quot;Long&quot;). His sources could not match the production of Lucy&#x27;s group in quality or quantity but were nevertheless important.
* The third espionage network was led by Swiss journalist Otto Pünter (&quot;Pakbo&quot;). Pünter&#x27;s network was considered the least important.

The three principal agents above were chiefly an organisation for producing intelligence for the Soviet Union. But some of the information that was collected for the Rote Drei was sent to the west through a Czech Colonel, Karel Sedláček. In 1935, Sedláček was trained in Prague for a year in 1935, and sent to Switzerland in 1937 by General František Moravec. By 1938, Sedláček was a friend of Major Hans Hausamann who was Director of the unofficial &quot;Buero Ha&quot;, then a covert arm of the Swiss Intelligence disguised as a press-cuttings agency. In the summer of 1939, Hausamann has been introduced to Rudolf Roessler by Xaver Schnieper, a junior officer in the Bureau and invited Roessler to work for Swiss intelligence. It was unknown whether Hausamann was passing information to Roessler, who passed it to Sedláček who forwarded it to London Czechs in exile, or via an intermediary.

==== Radio messages examined ====
The radio stations that were known to exist were established at:
* A station built by Geneva radio dealer Edmond Hamel codenamed &quot;Eduard&quot; and hidden behind a board in his apartment at Route de Florissant 192a in Geneva. Hamel&#x27;s wife, who acted as an assistant, prepared the encrypted messages. Radó paid the couple 1000 Swiss francs per month.
* A station built in Geneva by Radó&#x27;s lover, the waitress Marguerite Bolli at Rue Henry Mussard 8. She earned 800 Swiss francs per month.
* The third station, which was hidden insider a typewriter, was built by Alexander Foote. The transmitter was located in Lausanne at Chemin de Longeraie 2. Red Army Captain Foote was paid 1300 francs per month.

Wilhelm F. Flicke, a cryptanalyst at the Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht, worked on the message traffic created by the Swiss group during World War II. Flicke estimated some 5500 messages or about five a day for three years were transmitted. The Trepper Report states that between 1941 and 1943, traffic from the three subgroups between 1941 and 1943 consisted of over 2000 militarily important messages, that were sent to the GRU Central office. In September 1993, the CIA Library also undertook an analysis of traffic throughput and estimated that a reasonable number would be around 5000 for the period it was in operation.

====Roessler&#x27;s sources in World War II====
Roessler&#x27;s value to the Soviet Union lay entirely in the great quantity of high-quality intelligence that he obtained and that played such a decisive part in the Soviet victory at the Battle of Kursk. Around 12,000 typed pages were sourced from the German High Command of planned operations on the Eastern Front. Roessler was often able to deliver accurate intelligence, often within 24 hours of the orders being issued. For instance, a German army commander found a copy of his own orders in the Red Army headquarters building in the Polish town of Łomża when his unit occupied it after wresting it from the Russians. This was reported to the German high command, yet they were unable to find the leak. It was never discovered who they were. The four sources whose codenames were &quot;Werther&quot;, &quot;Teddy&quot;, &quot;Olga&quot;, and &quot;Anna&quot; were responsible for 42.5 per cent of the intelligence sent from Switzerland to the Soviet Union.

The search for the identity of those sources has created a very large body of work of varying quality and offering various conclusions. Several theories can be dismissed immediately including by Foote and several other writers that the code names reflected the sources&#x27; access type rather than their identity, for example that Werther stood for Wehrmacht, Olga for Oberkommando der Luftwaffe, Anna for Auswärtiges Amt (Foreign Office) as the evidence does not support it. Alexander Radó made this claim in his memoirs, that were examined in a &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; article. Three and a half years before his death, Roessler described the identity of the four sources to a confidant. They were a German major who was in charge of the Abwehr before Wilhelm Canaris, Hans Bernd Gisevius, Carl Goerdeler and a General Boelitz, who was then deceased.

The most reliable study by the CIA Historical Review Program concluded that of the four sources, the most important source was &quot;Werther&quot;. The study stated he was likely Wehrmacht General Hans Oster, other Abwehr officers working with Swiss intelligence, or Swiss intelligence on its own. There was no evidence to link the other three codenames to known individuals. The CIA believed that the German sources gave their reports to Swiss General Staff, who in turn supplied Roessler with information that the Swiss wanted to pass to the Soviets.

==Networking==
===Berliners with foreign representatives===
From 1933 to December 1941, the Harnacks had contact with the US Embassy counsellor Donald R. Heath and Martha Dodd, the daughter of the then US Ambassador William Dodd. The Harnacks would often attend receptions at the American embassy as well as parties organised by Martha Dodd, until about 1937. As like-minded people, the group believed that the population would revolt against the Nazis and when it did not, the group became convinced that new avenues were needed to defeat Hitler. From the summer of 1935, Harnack worked on economic espionage for the Soviet Union, and economic espionage for the United States by November 1939. Harnack was convinced that America would play a part in defeating Nazi Germany.

In September 1940, Alexander Korotkov acting under his codename of &quot;Alexander Erdberg&quot;, a Soviet intelligence officer who was part of the Soviet Trade Delegation in Berlin, won over Arvid Harnack as a spy for the Soviet Embassy. Harnack had been an informant but in a meeting with Korotkov in the Harnacks&#x27; top floor apartment at Woyrschstrasse in Berlin and later in a meeting arranged by Erdberg in the Soviet Embassy to ensure he was not a decoy, he finally convinced Harnack, who was reluctant to agree. Several reasons have been advanced as to why Harnack decided to become a spy, including a need for money, being ideologically driven, and possibly blackmail by Russian intelligence. It was known that Harnack had planned an independent existence for his friends. According to a statement by Erdberg discovered after the war, he thought Harnack was not motived by money nor ideologically driven but that he was specifically building an anti-fascist organisation for Germany as opposed to an espionage network for Russian intelligence. He considered himself a German patriot.

In February 1937, Schulze-Boysen had compiled a short information document about a sabotage enterprise planned in Barcelona by the German Wehrmacht. It was action from &quot;Special Staff W&quot;, an organisation established by Luftwaffe general Helmuth Wilberg to study and analyse the tactical lessons learned by the &quot;Legion Kondor&quot; during the Spanish Civil War. A cousin to Schulze-Boysen, Gisela von Pöllnitz, placed the document in the mailbox of the Soviet Embassy in Bois de Boulogne.

In April 1939, Anatoly Gurevich was ordered to visit Berlin and attempt to revive Schulze-Boysen as a source. He arrived in Berlin on 29 October 1939 and arranged a meeting, first with Kurt Schulze, the radio operator for Ilse Stöbe and then Schulze-Boysen. At the meeting, Schulze-Boysen confirmed there would be no attack on the Soviet Union that year, that Germany did not have enough oil to conduct the war fully. Gurevich persuaded Schulze-Boysen to recruit other people as sources. From 26 September 1940, Harnack passed on knowledge received from Schulze-Boysen about the planned attack on the Soviet Union to Korotkov, but not about the open and branched structure of his group of friends. By 1941, Schulze-Boysen had succeeded in creating his own network. In March 1941, Schulze-Boysen informed Korotkov directly about his knowledge of the German attack plans.

Schulze-Boysen employed the following people in his network: his wife, Libertas, who acted as his deputy; Elisabeth and Kurt Schumacher, who were close contacts; Eva-Maria Buch, who worked in the &quot;German Institute of Foreign Affairs&quot;; Oda Schottmüller and Erika von Brockdorff, who used their houses for radio operations; Kurt Schulze, radio matters; Herbert Engelsing, an informant; Günther Weisenborn, who produced Nazi commissions for Joseph Goebbels, John Graudenz, whose work as a salesman to the Luftwaffe allowed him to visit most airfields. Horst Heillman, a Funkabwehr officer and Elfriede Paul, who acted as a cutout for Engelsing.

Harnack employed the following people in his network: Herbert Gollnow, an Abwehr officer; Wolfgang Havemann, a scientist in German Naval Intelligence Service; Adam and Greta Kuckhoff; German industrialist Leo Skrzypczynski; politician Adolf Grimme; and railway worker John Sieg. Tool designer Karl Behrens and Rose Schlösinger, a secretary at the Federal Foreign Office, were couriers to Hans Coppi.

During May 1941, Korotkov had taken delivery of two shortwave radio sets that had been delivered in the Soviet Union embassy diplomatic pouch, in an attempt to make the Berlin group independent. They were handed to Greta Kuckhoff without precise instructions on how to use them, nor in how to maintain contact with the Soviet leadership in case of war. The two radio sets were of different design. The first set had been damaged by Korotkov and had been returned to the Soviet Union for repair, returned and kept by Greta Kuckhoff on 22 June 1941. That other set was battery-powered, with a range of 600 miles that was passed to Coppi on the instruction of Schulze-Boyson at Kurt and Elisabeth Schumacher&#x27;s apartment. On 26 June 1941, Coppi sent a message:&quot;A thousand greetings to all friends&quot;. Moscow replied &quot;We have received and read your test message. The substitution of letters for numbers and vice versa is to be done using the permanent number 38745 and the codeword Schraube&quot;, and directing them to transmit at a predefined frequency and time. After that, the batteries were too weak to reach Moscow.

In June 1941, the Soviet Embassy was withdrawn from Berlin, and from that point, Schulze-Boysen&#x27;s information was couriered to Brussels where it was transmitted using Gurevich&#x27;s network.

In November 1941, another radio set was passed to Coppi at the Eichkamp S-Bahn railway station. It was supplied by Kurt Schulze, who gave Coppi technical instructions on its use. This set was more powerful, being AC powered. Coppi would later accidentally destroy the AC-powered transmitter by connecting it to a DC power socket, destroying the transformer and vacuum tube. Coppi and the Harnack/Shulze-Boysen resistance groups never received sufficient training from Korotkov. Indeed, when Greta Kuckhoff was trained she concluded that her own technical preparations were &quot;extraordinarily inadequate&quot;. Only a few members of the Schulze-Boysen/Harnack Group knew about these radio experiments.

===Contact with other groups===

Since the beginning of the war in 1939, the Berlin group of friends intensified both exchange and cooperation among themselves. They had a desire to connect with organised and non-organised resistance groups from other regions and sections of the population and to explore common possibilities for action.

Both Harro Schulze-Boysen and Arvid Harnack were good friends with lawyer and academic Carl Dietrich von Trotha. Harnack knew Horst von Einsiedel, also a lawyer, since 1934. Schulze-Boysen knew the diplomat and author, Albrecht Haushofer from the Deutsche Hochschule für Politik, where he was holding seminars. In 1940, Trotha and Einsiedel joined the Kreisau Circle, a resistance group that was officially formed with the merging of the intellectual peers of Jurists Helmuth James von Moltke and Peter Yorck von Wartenburg.

Its members included lawyer, Adam von Trott zu Solz, Albrecht Haushofer, industrialist Ernst Borsig, bureaucrat Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg, philosopher, Alfred Delp, politician Julius Leber, scientist Carlo Mierendorff and many others. Harnack and Schulze-Boysen had a frequent discussion with the group until 1942. The prison chaplain Harald Poelchau who accompanied the members of the resistance groups who were to be executed, was part of the Kreisau Circle resistance group.

Other members of the German group sought contact with the then largely destroyed underground network of the KPD. In 1939, the machinist Hans Coppi established contact with the resistance group associated with theatre actor and former KPD member Wilhelm Schürmann-Horster, while they were both taking evening classes.

In 1934, John Sieg and Robert Uhrig met Wilhelm Guddorf and sinologist Philipp Schaeffer while imprisoned in Luckau prison in Brandenburg, later making contact with KPD officials when released from concentration camp. Guddorf, on the other hand, held talks with the Bästlein-Jacob-Abshagen Group in Hamburg. The lawyer Josef Römer who had contacts with Sieg, Uhrig and Arthur Sodtke
 also had contact with a Munich resistance group through Bavarian politician Viktoria Hösl.

In November 1942, in a meeting organised by Munich artist, Lilo Ramdohr, White Rose resistance group members Hans Scholl and Alexander Schmorell visited Chemnitz, to meet Falk Harnack, brother to Arvid Harnack. Scholl and Schmorell were looking to contact anti-Nazi resistance groups in Berlin and unite them together as allies with a common aim. Harnack held discussions with his cousins Klaus and Dietrich Bonhoeffer in order to prepare them for a meeting with Hans Scholls. In the spring of 1943, four members of the White Rose met Falk Harnack again in Munich, but received no clear commitment to his cooperation.

===Reorganisation===
In July and August 1942, the Soviet Main Directorate of State Security (GRU) tried to re-establish contacts with internal German opponents of Hitler. To this end, German communists in exile who had been trained by the GRU as espionage agents were parachuted into Germany.

On 16 May 1942, Soviet agents Erna Eifler and Wilhelm Fellendorf were parachuted into East Prussia. They were instructed to contact Ilse Stöbe in Berlin. However, they never managed to locate Stöbe and by June 1942 found themselves in Hamburg, a city they knew well. Fellendorf&#x27;s mother, Katharina Fellendorf, hid the two. Later they moved and were hidden by Herbert Bittcher In early July, they took shelter with Bernhard Bästlein. Eifler&#x27;s location was leaked by a communist informer to the Gestapo and she was arrested on 15 October 1942. Fellendorf managed to escape arrest for another two weeks.

On 5 August 1942 Albert Hoessler and Robert Barth parachuted into Gomel, reaching Berlin via Warsaw and Posen, a few days before the arrest of Schulze-Boysen. They had been sent to establish a radio link to the GRU for the Schulze-Boysen Group initially from Erika von Brockdorff&#x27;s apartment and then Oda Schottmüller&#x27;s apartment. They were caught before they could make preliminary contact with Soviet intelligence.

On the 23 October 1942, Heinrich Koenen parachuted into Osterode in East Prussia and made his way to Berlin, to meet his contact Rudolf Herrnstadt. He carried a radio set and a receipt for $6500 that had been signed by Rudolf von Scheliha in 1938. He planned to use it to blackmail von Scheliha, if he had proved recalcitrant in his endeavours. The Gestapo had advanced notice of Koenen&#x27;s arrival from a radio intercept message that they had decrypted, and he was arrested on 29 October 1942 by a Gestapo official waiting at Stöbe&#x27;s apartment.

The group around Robert Uhrig and Beppo Römer had more than two hundred members in Berlin and Munich with branches in Leipzig, Hamburg and Mannheim. In February 1942, the group was infiltrated by the Gestapo. By October 1942, the many members of the Bästlein-Jacob-Abshagen Group in Hamburg had been arrested. Several members of these groups including Anton Saefkow, Bernhard Bästlein and Franz Jacob, fled from Hamburg to Berlin and began building a new resistance network of illegal cells in the factories of Berlin, that became known as the Saefkow-Jacob-Bästlein Organization.

==Persecution by Nazi authorities==
===Unmasking===
The events that led up to the exposure of the Red Orchestra were facilitated by a number of blunders by Soviet intelligence, over several months. The radio transmission that exposed them, was intercepted at 3:58am on 26 June 1941 and was the first of many that were to be intercepted by the Funkabwehr. The message received at the intercept station in Zelenogradsk had the format: &quot;Klk from Ptx... Klk from Ptx... Klk from Ptx... 2606. 03. 3032 wds No. 14 qbv&quot;. This was followed by thirty-two 5-figure message groups with a morse end of message terminator containing &quot;AR 50385 KLK from PTX&quot;. (PTX) Until that point, the Nazi counter-intelligence operation did not believe there was a Soviet network operating in Germany and/or the occupied territories. By September 1941, over 250 messages had been intercepted, but it took several months for them to reduce the suspected area of transmission to within the Belgium area using goniometric triangulation. On 30 November 1941, close range direction-finding teams moved into Brussels and almost immediately found three transmitter signals. Abwehr officer Henry Piepe was ordered to take charge of the investigation around October or November 1941.

====Rue des Atrébates====
The Abwehr choose a location at 101 Rue des Atrébates, that provided the strongest signal from PTX and on 12 December 1941, at 2pm, the house was raided by the Abwehr and Geheime Feldpolizei.

Inside the house were courier Rita Arnould, writing specialist Anton Danilov as well as cipher clerk Zofia Poznańska. The radio transmitter was still warm. The woman was trying to burn enciphered messages, which were recovered. The radio operator was Anton Danilov. The Germans found a hidden room holding the material and equipment needed to produce forged documents, including blank passports and inks. Arnould&#x27;s psychological composure collapsed when she was captured, stating; &quot;I&#x27;m glad it is all over&quot;. While Arnould became an informer, Poznańska committed suicide in prison after being tortured. The next day, Mikhail Makarov turned up at the house and was arrested. Trepper also visited the house, but his documentation in the form of an Organisation Todt pass was so authentic, that he was released. In Berlin, the Gestapo was ordered to assist Harry Piepe and they selected Karl Giering to lead the investigation and the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle.

Arnould identified two passports belonging to the aliases of Trepper and Gurevich, his deputy in Belgium. From the scraps of paper recovered, Wilhelm Vauck, principal cryptographer of the Funkabwehr was able to discover the code being used for message encipherment was based on a chequerboard cipher with a book key. Arnould, recalled the agents, regularly read the same books and was able to identify the name of one as &quot;Le miracle du Professeur Wolmar&quot; by Guy de Téramond After scouring most of Europe for the correct edition, a copy was found in Paris on 17 May 1942. The Funkabwehr discovered that, of the three hundred intercepts in their possession, only 97 were enciphered using a phrase from the Téramond book. The Funkabwehr never discovered that some of the remaining messages had been enciphered using &quot;La femme de trente ans&quot; by Honoré de Balzac.

====Rue de Namur====
Following the arrests, the other two transmitters had remained off the air for six months, except for routine transmission. Trepper assumed the investigation had died down and ordered the transmissions to restart. On 30 July 1942, the Funkabwehr identified a house at 12 Rue de Namur, Brussels and arrested GRU radio operator, Johann Wenzel. Two messages waiting to be enciphered were discovered in the house that contained details of such startling content, the plans for Case Blue, that Abwehr officer Henry Piepe immediately drove to Berlin from Brussels to report to German High Command. His actions resulted in the formation of the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle. Giering ordered Wenzel to be moved to Fort Breendonk where he was tortured and decided to cooperate with the Abwehr, betraying Erna Eifler, Wilhelm Fellendorf, Bernhard Bästlein and the Hübners.

====Soviet blunder====
German counter-intelligence spent months assembling the data but finally, Vauck succeeded in decrypting around 200 of the captured messages. On 15 July 1942, Vauck decrypted a message that was dated 10 October 1941. The message was addressed to &quot;Kent&quot;, (Anatoly Gurevich) and had the lead format:&quot;L3 3 DE RTX 1010-1725 WDS GBD FROM DIREKTOR PERSONAL&quot;. When the message was decrypted, it gave the location of two addresses in Berlin. The message stated:

:&quot;Go to see Adam Kuckhoff at 18 Wilhelmstrasse, telephone 83-62-61, the second stairwell on the left, top floor and tell them that you have been sent a friend of &quot;Arvid&quot; and &quot;Harro&quot; whom Arvid knows as Alexander Erdberg. Mention the book of Kuckhoff that he gave him before the war and the play &quot;Ulenspiegel&quot;. Suggest to Kuckhoff that he arrange a meeting for you, KENT, with &quot;Arvid&quot; and &quot;Harro&quot;. If that is impossible, then clarify through Kuckhoff:&quot;

A set of instructions were included followed by:
:&quot;If Kuckhoff cannot be found, contact the wife of &quot;Harro&quot; Libertas Schulze-Boysen, at her address 19 Altenburger Alle...&quot;

The messages provided the locations of the apartments of the Kuckhoffs and the Schulze-Boysens. Another message that had been sent on 28 August 1941 instructed Gurevich to contact &quot;Alte&quot;, Ilse Stöbe. The two addresses were passed to the Reich Security Main Office IV 2A, who easily identified the people living there, and from 16 July 1942 were put under surveillance.

A meeting was arranged between Walter Schellenberg, Egbert Bentivegni, Wilhelm Canaris and Hans Kopp to discuss the situation and it was decided the Gestapo would be solely responsible for exposing the group in Berlin. The Sicherheitsdienst appointed Horst Kopkow and Johannes Strübing while Giering and Piepe continued the work in the west.

===Arrests===
====Germany====
The Abwehr&#x27;s hand was forced when Horst Heilmann attempted to inform Schulze-Boysen of the situation. The previous day Schule-Boysen had asked Heilmann to check if the Abwehr had got wind of his contacts abroad. Heilmann, a German mathematician. worked at Referat 12 of the Funkabwehr, the radio decryption department in Matthäikirchplatz in Berlin. On 31 August 1942, he discovered the names of his friends in a folder that had been provided to him.

According to one version of events Heilmann immediately phoned Schulze-Boysen, using Wilhelm Vauck&#x27;s office phone as his phone was in use. As Schulze-Boysen was not in, Heilmann left a message with the maid of the household. When Schulze-Boysen returned, he immediately phoned the number, but unfortunately, it was answered by Vauck.

On 31 August 1942, Harro Schulze-Boysen was arrested in his office in the Ministry of Aviation. On 7 September 1942, the Harnacks had been arrested while on holiday. Schulze-Boysen&#x27;s wife, Libertas, had received a puzzling phone call from his office several days before. She was also warned by the woman who delivered her mail that the Gestapo was monitoring it. Libertas&#x27;s assistant radio author, Alexander Spoerl, also noticed that Adam Kuckhoff had gone missing while working in Prague.

Libertas, suspecting her husband had been arrested, contacted the Engelsings. Herbert Engelsing tried to contact Kuckhoff without a result. Libertas and Spoerl both started to panic and frantically tried to warn others. They destroyed the darkroom at the &quot;Kulurefilm center&quot; and Libertas destroyed her meticulously collected archive. At home, she packed a suitcase of all Harro Schulze-Boysens papers and then tried to fabricate evidence of loyalty to the Nazi State by writing fake letters. She sent the suitcase to Günther Weisenborn in the vain hope that it could be hidden and he tried to contact Harro Schulze-Boysen in vain. As the panic reached the rest of the group, frantic searches ensued as each person tried to clear their homes of any anti-Nazi paraphernalia.

Documents were burnt, one transmitter was dumped in a river, but the arrests had already started. On 8 September, Libertas was arrested. Adam Kuckhoff was arrested on 12 September 1942 while filming and Greta Kuckhoff the same day. The Coppis were arrested the same day along with the Schumachers and the Graudenzs. By 26 September, Günther Weisenborn and his wife had been arrested. By March 1943, between 120 and 139 people had been arrested (sources vary).

Those who were arrested were taken to basement cells (German: Hausgefängnis) in the most dreaded address in all of German-occupied Europe, Gestapo headquarters at 8 Prinze-Albert Strasse and put into custody by the Gestapo. The arrests continued and when the cells became overcrowded, several men were sent to Spandau Prison and the women to Alexanderplatz police station. However the leaders remained. Officers of the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle conducted the initial interrogation

At first, Harnack, Schulze-Boysen and Kuckhoff refused to say anything, so the interrogators applied &quot;intensified interrogations&quot; where each was tied between four beds, calf clamps and thumbscrews were applied, then they were whipped.

====Belgium====
Piepe interrogated Rita Arnould, about the forger&#x27;s room at Rue des Atrébates. Giering turned to Rita Arnould as the new lead in the investigation and she identified the Abwehr informer and Jewish forger Abraham Rajchmann. It was Rajchmann who forged identity documents in the secret room of 101 Rue des Atrébates. Rajchmann in turn betrayed Soviet agent Konstantin Jeffremov who was arrested on 22 July 1942 in Brussels, while attempting to obtain forged identity documents for himself. Jeffremov was to be tortured but agreed to cooperate and gave up several important members of the espionage network in Belgium and the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, he exposed former Rote Hilfe member and espionage agent Anton Winterink, who was arrested on 26 July 1942 by Piepe. Winterink was taken to Brussels, where he confessed after two weeks of interrogation by torture. Jeffremov (sources vary) also revealed the Simexco company name to the Abwehr and at the same time exposed the name and the existence of the Trepper espionage network in France. Eventually Jeffremov began to work for the Sonderkommando in a Funkspiel operation. Through Jeffremov, contact was made with Germaine Schneider, a courier, who worked for the group between Brussels and Paris. However, Schneider contacted Leopold Trepper, the technical director of Soviet Red Army Intelligence in western Europe. Trepper advised Schneider to sever all contact with Jeffremov and move to a hideout in Lyons. Giering instead focused on Germaine Schneider&#x27;s husband Franz Schneider. In November 1942, Franz Schneider was interrogated by Giering but as he was not part of the network he was not arrested and managed to inform Trepper that Jeffremov had been arrested.

Abraham Rajchmann was arrested by Piepe on 2 September 1942 when his usefulness as an informer to the Abwehr was at an end. Rajchmann also decided to cooperate with the Abwehr resulting in his betrayal of his mistress, the Comintern member Malvina Gruber, who was arrested on 12 October 1942. Gruber immediately decided to cooperate with the Abwehr, in an attempt to avoid &quot;intensified interrogation&quot;, i.e. torture. She admitted the existence of a Soviet agent Anatoly Gurevich and his probable location, as well as exposing several members of the Trepper espionage network in France.

Following a routine investigation, Harry Piepe discovered that the firm Simexco in Brussels was being used as a cover for Soviet espionage operations by the Trepper network. It was used as a means to generate monies that could be used in day-to-day operations by the espionage group unbeknownst to the employees of the company and at the same time provide travel documentation () and facilitates for European wide telephone communication between group members. Piepe was concerned about the large number of telegrams the company had sent to Berlin, Prague and Paris and decided to investigate. Piepe visited the Chief Commissariat Officer for Brussels, who was responsible for the company. In the meeting, Piepe showed the two photographs, that had been discovered at the house at 101 Rue des Atrébates, to the officer who identified them as Trepper and Gurevich.

As part of a combined operation with Giering in Paris, Piepe raided the offices of Simexco on 19 November 1942. When the Gestapo entered the Simexco office they found only one person, a clerk, but managed to discover all the names and addresses of Simexco employees and shareholders from company records. Over the month of November, most of the people associated with the company were arrested and taken to Saint-Gilles Prison in Brussels or Fort Breendonk in Mechelen. The Nazi German tradition of Sippenhaft meant that many family members of the accused were also arrested, interrogated and executed.

====Netherlands====
On the 18 August 1942, Winterink was arrested by the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle. Goulooze was arrested on 15 November 1943 and was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. He managed to survive the experience by assuming an alias. In 1948, he was expelled from the Communist Party of the Netherlands.

====France====
The Abwehr in Brussels and the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle believed they had full control of the Red Orchestra in Belgium and the Netherlands well before the end of 1942. There is no clear indication when Giering, Piepe and the Sonderkommando moved to Paris, although various sources indicate it was October 1942. Perrault reports it was &quot;later summer&quot; rather than &quot;early autumn&quot;. When the unit moved, it relocated to 11 Rue des Saussaies. Before leaving, Piepe and Giering agreed that Rajchmann would be the best person to take to Paris and find Trepper. When they arrived in Paris, Giering sent Rajchmann out to visit all the dead letterboxs that he knew about while leaving a message to Trepper to contact him. However Trepper never showed up. Giering then tried to establish a meeting with a contact, using information from the correspondence between Simexco and an employee of the Paris office of the Belgian Chamber of Commerce. That ultimately proved unsuccessful, so Giering turned back to investigating Simexco. Giering visited the Seine District Commercial Court where he discovered that Léon Grossvogel was a shareholder of Simex. He had been informed by Jeffremov that Grossvogel was one of Trepper&#x27;s assistants. Giering and Piepe decided to approach Organisation Todt to determine whether they could provide a way to identify where Trepper was located. Giering obtained a signed certificate of cooperation from Otto von Stülpnagel, the military commander of occupied France, and visited the Todt offices. Giering, together with organisation commander, created a simple ruse to trap Trepper. However, the ruse failed. Giering decided to start arresting employees of Simex and they were imprisoned in Fresnes Prison. On 19 November 1942, Suzanne Cointe, a secretary at Simex and Alfred Corbin, the commercial director of the firm were arrested.

Corbin was interrogated but failed to disclose the location of &quot;Monsieur Gilbert&quot;, the alias that Trepper was using in his dealings with Simex, so Giering sent for a torture expert. However, Corbin&#x27;s wife told the Abwehr that Corbin had given Trepper the name of a dentist. After being tortured, Corbin informed Giering of the address of Trepper&#x27;s dentist. Trepper was subsequently arrested on 24 November by Piepe and Giering, while he was sitting in a dentist&#x27;s chair. It was the result of two years of searching. On the 24 November, Giering contacted Hitler to inform him of the capture of Trepper.

Both Trepper and Gurevich, who had been arrested on the 9 November 1942 in Marseilles were brought to Paris and were treated well by Giering. Trepper informed Giering that his family and relatives in the USSR would be killed if it became known to Soviet intelligence that he was captured. Giering agreed that should Trepper collaborate, his arrest would remain a secret. Over the next few weeks, Trepper betrayed the names of agents to Giering including Léon Grossvogel, Hillel Katz and several other Soviet agents. According to Piepe, when Trepper talked, it was not out of fear of torture or defeat, but out of duty. While he gave up the names and addresses of most of the members of his own network, he was sacrificing his associates to protect the various members of the French Communist Party, whom he had an absolute belief in. Unlike Trepper, Gurevich refused to name any agents he had recruited.

====Switzerland====

===Funkspiel===
When the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle captured Soviet radio operators, instead of immediately executing them after interrogation as was normal practice for other agents, they were instead forced into running separate Funkspiel operations, under the direction of Giering. The term &quot;Funkspiel&quot;, defined by the German name &quot;Funk&quot; meaning radio and &quot;spiel&quot; meaning play or performance, was a common counterintelligence technique where controlled information was transmitted over a captured agent&#x27;s radio, where the agent&#x27;s parent service had no knowledge that the agent had turned. It was undertaken for a number of reasons that included poisoning the source by conveying deceptive material, discovering important intelligence and identifying networks.

To facilitate the operation, Hitler had given permission to pass on messages in coordination with the Reich Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, even if it fulfilled the definition of treason. The Gestapo&#x27;s purpose in running this particular funkspiel was to discover Soviet links to the French Communist Party, the French Resistance and the Red Three.

Two transmission stations were built on the outskirts of Paris that were operated by the German Schutzpolizei for use by the agents captured in France. In Brussels, a house on Rue de l&#x27;Aurore was used for Funkspiel operations. From August 1942 to October 1942, the RSHA ran four Funkspiel operations in Brussels, for agents captured in Belgium. The Sonderkommando in France ran the funkspiel from 25 December 1942 to August 1944. Gurevich continued his own funkspiel in various locations until May 1945. Six radio sets that had been captured out of eight were used.

Johann Wenzel ran a radio station called &quot;Weide&quot; that started in August. Anton Winterink, ran a station known &quot;Beam Tanne&quot; that began in September. In October, two stations were established, one for Jeffremov that was known as station &quot;Buche-Pascal&quot; and one for Hermann Isbutzki known as &quot;Buche-Bob&quot;. Trepper&#x27;s was known as &quot;Eiffel&quot; began on 25 December 1942, in Paris and Gurevich&#x27;s funkspiel known as &quot;Mars&quot; began in March 1943.

The German funkspiel operation was largely a failure. In Belgium, Soviet intelligence was likely given an early warning when Germaine Schneider informed Trepper of the raid at 12 Rue de Namur in July 1942. In Paris, the Germans made a series of fundamental mistakes in procedures during the operation. The principle mistake they made was not recognising the difficulties faced by Trepper in establishing and maintaining communications in the first place. They made no attempt to model the types of communication difficulties the group would have faced. They also made series of sloppy mistakes in operational procedures, e.g. sending multi-part message out of order, nor taking cognisance of the supposed location of individuals and repeatedly sending the same message on different days. The Sonderkommando were also unable to overcome the problem of passing false information to Soviet Intelligence. While Trepper&#x27;s &quot;Eiffel&quot; operation was running, the Germans passed general statements that had no detailed military information. This was another failure as Trepper had made a career out of delivering high-quality intelligence. Soviet Intelligence became increasingly strident in their demands for precise and accurate details. However, on 5 June 1943, the Commander-in-Chief West Gerd von Rundstedt refused to answer any further questions sent by Soviet Intelligence.

In August 1943, Heinz Pannwitz became director of the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle in Belgium and France, replacing Giering. Panwitz reduced the size of the Sonderkommando and changed the type of messages sent; reducing the military aspect and instead focused on reports from the Catholic church, the German economy, Russian emigration and other civilian areas. The messages that Pannwitz sent in coordination with Heinrich Müller were designed to deepen mistrust between the Soviet Union and the western allies. The funkspiel operations continued until 3 May 1945.

===Judgement===
====Germany====

On the 25 September 1942, Reich Marshal Hermann Göring, Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler and Gestapo Chief Inspector Heinrich Müller met to discuss the case. They decided the whole network should be charged with espionage and treason together as a group. In the second half of October, Müller proposed that the trial take place at Volksgerichtshof where most sedition cases were directed. Its new president in August 1942 was Roland Freisler who almost always sided with the prosecuting authority, to the point that being brought before him was tantamount to a capital charge.

Himmler who was a proponent of the proposal reported it to Hitler. However, the Führer, aware of the military nature of many people in the group, ordered Göring to &quot;burn out the cancer&quot;. Göring brought Schulze-Boysen into the air ministry, so needed to choose the correct prosecutor. On 17 October 1942, Göring met with Judge Advocate Manfred Roeder aboard his special train in the town of Vinnytsia. Göring trusted Roeder to prosecute the case correctly, as he was unlikely to sympathise with any humanitarian motives that would be offered by the defendants. It was only because Roeder was designated as prosecuting counsel that Hitler approved Göring&#x27;s plan and agreed to hold the trial in the Reichskriegsgericht (RKG, Reich Imperial Court) in Berlin, the highest German military court, instead of the Volksgerichtshof. whose judgements he considered insufficiently harsh. Roeder was seconded to the Reich War Prosecutor&#x27;s Office especially for the proceedings and commissioned Roeder to take on the indictment of the resistance group before the Reich Imperial Court. Roeder had not been a member of the Reich Military Court prior to that point, and his involvement was an expression of the trust that Göring placed in him. Roeder was universally disliked. Rudolf Behse, counsel for the defendants stated that cynicism and brutality were at the core of his character, stating that his &quot;limitless ambition&quot; was matched only by his &quot;innate sadism&quot;. Even his colleagues found him harsh and inconsiderable. Prosecuting judge Eugen Schmitt stated that there &quot;was something lacking in his temperament; he did not possess the normal man&#x27;s sympathy for the suffering of others...&quot;. When Axel von Harnack visited Roeder on behalf of the Harnacks, he stated of Roeder, &quot;Never since have I experienced an impression of brutality as I did from this man. He was a creature surrounded by an aura of fear&quot;.

At the beginning of November 1942, the Gestapo investigation delivered 30 volumes of reports to the Reich War Prosecutor&#x27;s Office for processing by Roeder. Roeder studied the files but found them inadequate, so decided to conduct further short interrogations. By the end of November 1942, a 90-page report was written by Horst Kopkow known as the &quot;Bolshevist Hoch Landesverrats&quot; that summarised the activities of the group and it was passed to senior members of the Nazi state for review With the production of the report, the Gestapo considered the initial phase of the investigation successful. At the same time, Roeder completed an 800-page indictment and proceeded to prosecute the group. Roeder determined that 76 people would stand trial of the original group. The indictments were broken down in groups.

On the 15 December 1942, the trial began in secret, in the 2nd senate of the Reichskriegsgericht. The presiding judge was Senate President Alexander Kraell. The other judges were professional judge Eugen Schmitt, Viceadmiral Theodor Arps, General Walter Musshoff, and Generalmajor Hermann Stutzer that made up the judicial panel that decided the legal case for each defendant.

The trial was a legal travesty. Prisoners were never able to read their indictments and often they would only meet their lawyers minutes before the case started, in trials that often only lasted hours, with the verdict pronounced on the same day. There was no jury, no peers, no German civilians present in the court, only Gestapo spectators. Attempts were made by family members to find suitable lawyers. Falk Harnack&#x27;s cousin, Klaus Bonhoeffer, was asked to represent the Harnacks but had refused. In the end, only four lawyers were found to represent the 79 defendants, in over 20 trials. At the centre of the &quot;evidence&quot; prepared by uncontrolled Gestapo interrogations was espionage and subversive activity, which was considered high treason and treason and was punishable by the death penalty. Roeder used the process not only to establish the crimes but also to comprehensively portray the private relationships of the accused in order to show them off as thoroughly depraved immoral people, humiliate them and break them.

====Belgium, France and Low Countries====
On the 8 March 1943, Manfred Roeder court-martialed each of the Red Orchestra prisoners in a small office at the former Coty Perfume Company, in central Paris. The prisoners were tried under the aegis of the Nacht und Nebel decree. The court-martial process was defined by the &quot;courts-martial accelerated procedure of the GOC Third Air Force Region&quot; book. The central tenet of the procedures was swiftness. Each prisoner was quickly assigned a lawyer, who asked each of them if they understood the seriousness of the charge against them. The charges would then be read out and the prisoner quickly sentenced. Once the court martial was over, lasting mere minutes, the prisoner was taken back to Fresnes Prison. Prisoners who had insulted Roeder, or for example, given the Communist salute were immediately shot. On 15 April 1943, the remaining prisoners in Fresnes Prison were taken by rail, first stopping in Brussels to pick up the Belgian-based Red Orchestra people that were imprisoned in Breendonk and Saint-Gilles&#x27;. The train then proceeded to Berlin where it arrived on the 17 April 1943 and the prisoners were distributed depending on sentence. The women including Suzanne Cointe were taken to Moabit Prison and the men taken to Lehrstrasse prison. The Belgian group were initially taken to Gestapo headquarters and then transported to Mauthausen concentration camp.

===Execution===
====Germany====
In Germany hanging had been outlawed since the 17th century. In March 1933, the Lex van der Lubbe Act was enacted that permitted hanging in public as a particularly dishonourable form of execution. Up until that point, German death sentences were carried out by firing squad in the military courts and by beheading by the guillotine in civil courts. It was seen as nefarious by the Nazis and at the same time, elicited a feeling of shame by the victims. On 12 December 1942, an order was explicitly sent by Otto Georg Thierack to Plötzensee Prison specifying gallows to hang eight people simultaneously. The notice was sent a full three days before the trial. Hitler wanted to further punish the group and indicated the verdict was already fixed.

In his 1963 book, &quot;Die Ordnung der Bedrängten : Autobiographisches und Zeitgeschichtliches seit den zwanziger Jahren&quot;, the prison chaplain Harald Poelchau stated:
::&quot;When the day of execution was determined, the person convicted for a day or several days was placed in a special cell: a death cell. In the prisons of Plötzensee and Brandenburg, there were cells downstairs that had been turned into death cells. The very fact of being transferred to this cell let the convict know even before the official notification that his hour had come&quot;

The guillotine was kept in a special room, the execution block that was located in the middle of the prison complex. The brick room, measuring about eight by ten metres, had a cement floor. The room had a single door, that led to the morgue, containing many empty wooden coffins. The room was divided into two parts, separated by a black curtain that could be opened and closed. In the front part of the room, sat the Judge&#x27;s table.

Thirty minutes before the execution, the prisoner was handcuffed then stripped to the waist. Women prisoners had their head shaven. They were then led to the room where verdict was immediately read by the prosecutor, who then ordered the executioner: &quot;Executioner, proceed with your duties&quot;. The curtain was then pulled back to reveal the guillotine. When the execution was completed, the executioner, would call out: &quot;Mr High Prosecutor, the sentence has been carried out!&quot;. Guests were invited to attend the execution and it was considered an honour. 

The first eleven death sentences for &quot;high and state treason&quot; and two sentences for &quot;passive aiding and abetting in high treason&quot; of six and ten years in prison were issued on 19 December and were presented to Hitler on 21 December. He rejected all requests for pardon and revoked the two penal sentences and referred these cases to the 3rd Senate of the RKG to reopen the case. In the eleven death sentences, the method and schedule of the executions were determined. On December 22, from 7:00 p.m. to 7:20 pm, the following were hanged every four minutes:
* Rudolf von Scheliha
* Harro Schulze-Boysen
* Arvid Harnack
* Kurt Schumacher
* John Graudenz
From 20:18 to 20:33 o&#x27;clock, every three minutes the following were beheaded:
* Horst Heilmann
* Hans Coppi
* Ilse Stöbe
* Libertas Schulze-Boysen
* Elisabeth Schumacher
Roeder was present at the executions as chief prosecutor.

On 16 January 1943, the 3rd Senate also sentenced Mildred Harnack and Erika von Brockdorff to death on the basis of new incriminating evidence from the Gestapo claiming that the women had knowledge of the radio messages. From 14 to 18 January 1943, the 2nd Senate heard the cases of nine other defendants who had been involved in the adhesive sticking operation. They were all sentenced to death for &quot;favouring the enemy&quot; and &quot;war treason&quot;. From 1 to 3 February, six other defendants were tried: Adam and Greta Kuckhoff, Adolf and Maria Grimme, Wilhelm Guddorf and Eva-Maria Buch. Only the death sentence for Adolf Grimme requested by Roeder was reduced to three years imprisonment: Grimme was able to make it credible that he had only seen the Agis leaflet briefly once. His wife was released without condition.

On 13 May, thirteen further members of the group were executed at Plötzensee: Karl Behrens, Erika Gräfin von Brockdorff, Wilhelm Guddorf, Helmut Himpel, Walter Husemann, Walter Küchenmeister, Friedrich Rehmer, John Rittmeister, Philipp Schaeffer, Heinz Strelow, Fritz Thiel, Erhard Thomfor and Richard Weissensteiner.

Himpel&#x27;s fiancé Maria Terwiel who had helped copy and distribute the Agis leaflet, and had written handbills and put up posters against the Nazi propaganda &quot;Soviet Paradise&quot; exhibition, was guillotined at Plötzensee on 5 August. Able in Spandau to coordinate his testimony with Himpel and Graudenz, her collaborator, the pianist Helmut Roloff, was released on 26 January 1943.

Of the remaining prisoners, 50 were sentenced to prison. Four men among the accused committed suicide in prison, five were murdered without trial. Some 65 death sentences were carried out.

====Belgium, France and Low Countries====
When a particular funkspiel operation was completed, the radio operator was usually executed by the Gestapo. Several members managed to escape custody however, including Wenzel on 17 November 1942, who escaped through an unlocked door and Trepper on the 13 September 1943, while visiting a pharmacy. Trepper returned to the Soviet Union in January 1945 and due to his being recruited by General Yan Karlovich Berzin, who had fallen out of favour, he was immediately arrested and held for ten years in Lubyanka, After his release, Trepper wrote an extensive report on his actions during the war. In it, he declared:

::The actual responsibility for the liquidation of the Berlin group rests with the management of the military intelligence agency in Moscow and the Central Committee of the illegal Communist Party of Germany.

Wenzel returned in January 1945 and was also imprisoned, due his involvement in the funkspiel. Gurevich was the last to complete his funkspiel on 3 May 1945, when he was captured with Pannwitz. When Gurevich returned to the Soviet Union in June 1945, he was interrogated and sentenced to 20 years for treason.

Of the 68 rank and file members of the Red Orchestra who were transported from Belgium and France by train, only 9 survived the war. Many members of the group never made it to trial and it is not known what happened to them. They have effectively disappeared without trace. The death of French resistance fighter Suzanne Spaak is perhaps illustrative, as she was shot in her cell, in the last days of the war by Pannwitz. The recruiter Hillel Katz disappeared after being tortured and then tried by Roeder. The worst torture given by the Gestapo was from dogs. The Simex company manager, Nazarin Drailly and radio operator Mikhail Makarov had both their legs shredded by dogs. Denied medical help, they would have died quickly.

==Operational procedures==
Considering the significant number of books and articles that have been written about the Red Orchestra, very little is known about its internal functions.

* Finances:
:The British born Soviet agent Alexander Foote was the group&#x27;s treasurer and paid the entire network. Foote carefully prepared a yearly budget and the following years monies were paid out in one or two lump sums, sent by a courier. Ten-thousand dollars was the common sum that was paid to agents on first entering a country. The Soviets were considered by American intelligence to be generous in their payments to agents. Some parts of the network were self-sufficient, for example, the cover companies, Simex and Simexco. 
* Motivation:
:As a group, Soviet agents were ardent communists, who were highly motivated, considering the constant risk of death. Comintern agents like Henry Robinson tended to be motivated by an ideology driven by the workers struggle for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie, while professional agents like Trepper, Jeffremov and Makarov were loyal to Stalin and their country. Rank and file members tended to be the most ideologically driven, that often clouded their thinking to some extent.
:Many writers who have examined the Red Orchestra have wrestled with the question of whether they could be considered traitors to their country or heroes. In the German legal sphere, it is the (aiding the enemy to defeat the government) versus (the overthrow of a government) argument. and the implications for the moral judgment of resistance members who operated under the Nazis. Brysac makes the argument, amongst others regarding the double standard that exists between different resistance members. The conspirators from the 20 July plot are considered genuine resistors, who attain the high moral ground of Hochverrat while Schulze-Boysen and the Harnack&#x27;s members, for example are considered to be espionage agents and their group used to illustrate the &quot;dangerous propinquity of resistance&quot;, thereby classed firmly within Landesverrat. There was a clear moral distinction between those who wished to restore a real German government and those who wanted to exploit anti-fascists for the Soviet Union.
:Many members of the group were Jewish and working in the group gave them a direct route to strike back at the Nazis. Many of them had lost family members, giving them an additional impetus to act. Most were never motivated by money, except Rudolf von Scheliha who was heavily in debt at the beginning. Family ties, romance and sex were often a factor in whether an individual could be recruited or used to provide intelligence.
* Documentation:
: The group used various methods to get identity documents that were accurate as possible. Common names from the country of origin were used on passports. For identity documents, individuals who had access to genuine blank documents and stamps were cultivated and recruited, for example Abraham Rajchmann. Agents were never to be photographed nor give examples of their handwriting.
* Contact and meetings
: Meetings were generally held on a Sunday or during holidays as the police were generally considered less alert. Agents who were to meet each other would involve one agent arriving at the rendezvous site and the other agent would walk by, without interacting with them. A second meeting would then be arranged where the two agents could recognise each other. Post offices, churches, museums and racecourses were considered good places to meet. Railway stations were always avoided. There was no need for a conversation during the meeting. If a principal agent needed to meet his recruits, then it was done as far away as possible from where the principal agent lived. Advanced signals were used by placing a mark in a telephone book in a kiosk. If it was missing, the meeting was cancelled. Telephones were never used to arrange a meeting, but could be used to give warning. Trepper phoned Spaak in Paris in 1943, with a conversation that opened with &quot;Bonjour, monsieur&quot; indicating the police were there. If the opening line was &quot;Bonjour, monsieur, Spaak&quot; it would indicate they were safe. This enabled Spaak to escape. For emergency meetings, or where agents lost touch with their network, they were told to visit a particular location, in a nearby foreign country, on certain days and times, with a password and safety signals.
* Communication
:The Red Orchestra used official Soviet agencies to forward their intelligence reports until Germany declared war on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. Reports were generally mailed or couriered to a particular Soviet organisation and then forwarded to the Soviet Union in a Diplomatic bag. Trepper, for example, used the Soviet Chamber of Commerce in Belgium, later the Military Attaché office in Paris. Rudolf Von Scheliha&#x27;s information was forwarded through the Soviet Embassy in Poland. Schulze-Boysen and Harnack used through the Soviet Embassy in Germany. When the Soviets withdrew, wireless telegraphy units were used by the group, but these had problems, amongst them reliability and having to find a secure site to transmit. They also gave the Funkabwehr a target. As the radio transmitter throughput was limited, only the core essentials of any report could be transmitted. Radio transmissions usually occurred late at night. Foote, for example, would contact Moscow at 0100, and if conditions were satisfactory and the message short, he finished transmitting in two hours. If it was a long report and atmospheric conditions were bad, he would still be transmitting at 0600 in the morning. Messages were always encrypted by cipher. Occasionally intelligence was sent through the post. Occasionally some reports were sent in the microfilm format and given to couriers to deliver. After 1941, all Soviet agents who were sent into action had training in microphotography. Couriers were heavily used by the group and while slower, couriering was the most secure. To meet a courier coming from Moscow, a rendezvous would be arranged in a foreign country where they would be met. The material being delivered would be camouflaged as a normal product that would be used daily, e.g. cigarette packet, fountain pen or match box. Married couples were considered ideal for working as couriers or cutouts.

==Reception after the war==
===German contemporary witnesses===
In the first post-war years, the performance and role model of the Schulze-Boysen/Harnack group were unreservedly recognised as an important part of the German resistance against the Nazis. In his book &quot;Offiziere gegen Hitler&quot; (Officers against Hitler) (1946) on the assassination attempt of 20 July 1944 plot, resistance fighter and later writer Fabian von Schlabrendorff paid tribute to the Germans executed as members of the Red Orchestra.

In 1946, the German historian and author, Ricarda Huch publicly called for contributions to her planned collection of biographies of executed resistance fighters &quot;Für die Märtyrer der Freiheit&quot; (For the Martyrs of Freedom).

Huch explained the task as

:&quot;How we need the air to breath, light to see, so we need noble people to live... When we commemorate those who lost their lives in the struggle against National Socialism, we fulfill a duty of gratitude, but at the same time we do ourselves good, because by commemorating them we rise above our Bad luck&quot;.

She named the men and women of the Red Orchestra at the forefront. Günther Weisenborn published &quot;Der lautlose Aufstand&quot; (The Silent Uprising) in 1953, based on material collected from Ricarda Huch, upon her death.

===Western Intelligence===

Western intelligence agencies were interested in the Red Orchestra after the war, as they hoped for information about the workings of Soviet foreign espionage.

In June 1945, British and American intelligence agencies submitted the first report on the Red Orchestra, the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle and the funkspiel operation run by Heinz Pannwitz. Allied intelligence agencies questioned a large number of people and came to the conclusion that remnants of the Red Orchestra could still exist. The defector Igor Gouzenko warned them that Soviet agents still existed that were sleepers before being activated. At the same time, MI5 came to the conclusion that the Trepper organisation was working against the west.

The British also interrogated Nazi informers, e.g. Horst Kopkow who was head of the special commission Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle. In August 1945, Hilde Purwin told the American Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) about a secret Berlin spy ring for the Soviet Union, about which the judge advocate Egon Koepsch and general judge Manfred Roeder could willingly give information about its dismantling. These were then put out for investigation.

For the British, the most important intelligence were papers captured by the Gestapo, known as the &quot;Robinson papers&quot; that were created by Henry Robinson, a German comintern agent in Paris with close links to Leopold Trepper. The papers indicated that Robinson had been liaising with Soviet agents in Great Britain. Evelyn McBarnet, an agent of MI5 had worked on the papers to try and identify the names, but they were either aliases, post-boxes, or locations that had been bombed. Another officer of MI5, Michael Hanley also worked on the papers in the 1950s. He identified more than 5000 names belonging to the Red Orchestra organisation.

On 23 December 1947, Manfred Roeder along with Walter Huppenkothen had become informants for the CIC, placing them out of reach of a prosecution brought by Adolf Grimme and Greta Kuckoff. In 1942, senior Gestapo officer Huppenkothen was in charge of department IVa for counter-espionage. On 31 December 1947, the CIC wrote a report in which Roeder had the code name &quot;Othello&quot; that summarised Roeders testimony. Roeder had testified that the &quot;Red Orchestra continued to be alive and active&quot; and that &quot;despite certain interests and attempts to portray it as a resistance organisation, it was in fact a spy network controlled by the Soviets&quot;. In his first report, Roeder testified that the Red Orchestra was still active and controlled by the Soviets. Written in early 1947, the 37-page report written for the Americans, identified all members of the Red Orchestra and their functions. He, Roeder, could not avert the death sentences, because Hitler&#x27;s &quot;People&#x27;s Pest Ordinance&quot; left him no choice at the time. The &quot;civil justice system&quot; had carried out the sentences and carried out a &quot;reconstruction&quot; of the execution site. Hanging was more humane than the fall-by-case. Hitler alone was responsible for rejecting the requests for clemency. He had demanded a summary condemnation of all the imprisoned members against which the Reichskriegsgericht had successfully passed on a case-by-case examination. Huppenkothen also pointed to Gestapo&#x27;s experience with communist espionage and added a list of Gestapo &quot;experts.&quot; On 19 January 1948, Roeder released another report at 90 pages, with photographs of Red Orchestra members, under the name &quot;Bolshevik High and Treasonous Organisation in the Reich and Western Europe&quot; describing it as a spy network spread across Europe that the Soviet Union had built up since the 1930s to conquer the continent. The report used the type of language and mentality characteristic of Roeder and other Nazi judges. As Roeder pointed out that the trial records of the prosecutions had been burned, he felt capable of distorting the historical truth. As the CIC had told Roeder that his reports would only be accepted if he wasn&#x27;t convicted, the reports became the method by which he defended himself and this led to him distorting many historical facts and defaming the victims of the Nazi dictatorship.

By 1948, although the evidence obtained from the CIC was dubious, the Central Intelligence Agency were convinced that Red Three in Switzerland was still active. Roeder&#x27;s description of the group indicated how little the Nazi state knew about the Swiss group. As a result, the Allied services took on the Gestapo myth from their informants. However, by 13 May 1948, a CIA memo was in circulation that detailed how Roeder had delivered no concrete evidence. In the summer of 1948, the American military government handed over the investigation against Roeder to the German authorities. Because Roeder was in US custody in Nuremberg at the time, his case was transferred to the German prosecution in Nuremberg.

====Cold War complicity====
At the beginning of the Cold War there was complicity between the Nazi lawyers such as Roeder and the US occupying power. As they relied only on statements by Nazi officials for their research into communist and Soviet espionage for their research, before and after 1945, the CIC in many cases shared an anti-communist and sometimes an anti-Semitic attitude with the Nazis. Brysac clearly stated the position:

::&quot;in 1949, the year the state was founded in both parts of post-war Germany (and also in the year in which Roeder was released), it was already clear that in the Federal Republic those Germans were preferred who could prove that they hated the communists more than they hated the National Socialists&quot;.

This resulted in the continued perscution of the resistance fighters by the post-war German judiciary. In a sense they were convicted twice for their opposition to the Nazi state.

===Federal German Justice===

On 15 September 1945, Adolf Grimme filed a complaint against Manfred Roeder with the military government of the British Occupation Zone in Hanover. Along with Greta Kuckhoff and Günther Weisenborn, Grimme also reported Roeder to the International Military Tribunal for crimes against humanity. By January 1947, the Nuremberg prosecutors were convinced he should be tried for war crimes, but after examining the complaint, no charges were brought.

On 7 January 1949 Roeder was released and returned to his family in Neetze. In October 1948, the Nuremberg prosecutors turned the case over to the German courts and the Lüneburg public prosecutor was tasked with pursuing the prosecution. Nuremberg prosecutor, Hans Meuschel hoped that due to Control Council Act No. 10 (Kontrollratsgesetz Nr. 10), the German law that recognised crimes against humanity, that justice would prevail against Roeder in the court of the Lower Saxony Ministry of Justice. Lüneburg prosecutor Hans-Jürgen Finck investigated Roeder, producing a 1732-page report in 1951, half of it recording in detail the supposed crimes of the Red Orchestra. Finck stated in the report that &quot;It&quot; cannot be refuted that the death sentences were lawful. Roeder was seen by Finck as a victim, not a perpetrator. On 1 November 1951, Finck closed the case. The Lower Saxony Ministry of Justice kept its final report under wraps for years, as it obviously coincided with Roeder&#x27;s assessment of the &quot;Red Orchestra&quot;.

This interpretation prevailed in the minds of the West German public of the 1950s and was also represented by leading West German historians at the time. Since then, the Red Orchestra in the Federal Republic of Germany has been largely portrayed as a purely secret service organisation. Helmut Kohl wrote in a letter to Harro&#x27;s brother Hartmut Schulze-Boysen in 1987 that the German resistance consisted of the group around Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg and the White Rose, that the Red Orchestra did not belong to it.

===Soviet Union===
The Soviet Union kept quiet about the Berlin group of friends for twenty years. On 6 October 1969, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR posthumously awarded the Order of the Red Banner to Harro Schulze-Boysen, Arvid Harnack, Adam Kuckhoff, Ilse Stöbe and Hansheinrich Kummerow. Günther Weisenborn, Karl Behrens and Albert Hoessler received the Order of the Patriotic War 1st Class.

Articles in Pravda and Izvestia praised the resistance of those so honoured, but interpreted it only as confirmation of the unifying force of the communist Popular Front policy under the dominance of the KPD, which was the only organised anti-fascist resistance group that had specifically collected information for the Soviet Union. Only publicly available Western sources were used in the articles. The Soviet intelligence files remained under lock and key.

In 1974, Juri Korolkov published &quot;Die innere Front Roman über d. Rote Kapelle&quot; that was about the group.

===East Germany===

From 1949 onwards, the GDR banned the publication of everything related to Soviet intelligence. Those of the German resistance who had contact with Soviet intelligence and what information they had, remained secret. In December 1966, a plan by Erich Mielke was organised in liaison with the KGB to formerly identify the scouts and honour them. By August 1967, public appreciation of the group began in earnest when proposals for the posthumous honouring of the German group as a Scout organisation were made, that specified the &quot;award for scouts of the Red Orchestra&quot;.

In 1970, a DEFA feature film &quot;KLK an PTX...&quot; was released that portrayed the official histories of the Red Orchestra as a group dependent on the anti-fascism of the KPD and therefore only capable of joint action. Here too, the intelligence activity was overemphasised, but it was seen positively here. Since the 1960s, all biographies of the members of the Red Orchestra in the GDR have been adapted by the Stasi to give the GDR secret service a story with anti-fascist roots. The 1979 book &quot;Rote Kapelle gegen Hitler&quot; by Soviet military historian Alexander Blank and Stasi officer Julius Mader is used today as an example of a manipulated historiography. The GDR&#x27;s image of history solidified the false image of the Red Orchestra in the Federal Republic as a communist spy group.

===Historical research===

The first attempts to secure sources on the history of the German resistance against Nazism were made by the branches of the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime in all German occupation zones. In 1948, Klaus Lehmann documented his information about the German resistance group around Shulze-Boysen and Harnack for the Union in East Berlin.

After positive appreciations of the immediate post-war period, West German historians such as Hans Rothfels and Gerhard Ritter judged the Red Orchestra. Rothfel, writing for an American audience in &quot;The German Opposition to Hitler, An Appraisal&quot; (1949), wrote for the sake of historical justice, placed the resistance fighters of the 20 July plot, as well as the Harnack group at the centre of his study. Rothfel conceded that the German resistance to Hitler was much more extensive than could have been expected under the conditions of terror and lauded the convictions of the resistance fighters and their vision of a European mission. Ritter&#x27;s &quot;Carl Goerdeler and the German Resistance Movement&quot; (&quot;Carl Goerdeler und die Deutsche Widerstandsbewegung&quot;) (1954) based his work on Roeder&#x27;s writing &quot;Die Rote Kapelle&quot; and adopted his thesis of treason. He focused more on the resisters values and ideas. Ritter stated that not every resister who was unsatisfied or criticised the Nazis could be included in the German resistance movement. He was vehement in stating that socialist opposition against the Nazi state did not deserve the honorary title of &quot;Resistance&quot;. In his evaluation he stated, &quot;The group had apparently nothing to do with German Resistance, one should have no doubts about this...Any person who can persuade a German soldier to defect or betray important secrets...is a traitor&quot;.

The situation remained decisive in the 1960s when new publications by writers Gilles Perrault and Der Spiegel journalist Heinz Höhne were published. Perrault focused more on Western European resistance cells. Höhne used a collection of 500 radio messages belonging to veteran radio cipher officer Wilhelm F. Flicke, as his research base. However, Flicke had worked for another department between 1942 and 1943 and did not learn of the Red Orchestra until 1944. In 1949 and 1953, Höhne published two books, that are now considered sensational and a form of Colportage novel without a valid source base. In the book &#x27;Codeword: Direktor&#x27;, Höhne repeated Nazi accusations in great detail including Roeder&#x27;s accusations, fabrications and slander. Not a single message was sent using the faulty radios. Höhne also repeated the spurious charge that was presented by the Nazis that the group was mercenary in its nature, which was entirely false. Perrault researched extensively in newspapers and interviewed witnesses but staged his own research. Perrault also interviewed contemporary Gestapo witnesses knowing they were responsible for torture. Witnesses like Harry Piepe were paid to tell their story.

In 1983, historian Peter Steinbach and designer, Hans Peter Hoch were commissioned by Richard von Weizsäcker, then mayor of Berlin, to fully document the German resistance to Nazism, in all its diversity. In 1989, the Memorial to the German Resistance established a permanent exhibition on the subject.

The effort by people like Weizsäcker led to an intensification of research, but it was only with the ending of the Eastern Bloc and the collapse of the Soviet Union on 8 December 1991, that the evaluation of Soviet archive documentation on the Red Orchestra could begin, without the lens of ideology intruding. In 2002, for the first time, Hans Coppi and Soviet political historian Boris Lwowitsch Chawkin and historian Yuri N. Zorya brought to light many original documents from the Russian archives, which refuted the myth that the Harnack and Schulze-Boysen groups were a spy organisation.

In 2009, a study by American political scientist Anne Nelson that was published as a book, came to the following conclusions:

* The members viewed themselves as rebels who were enlightened.
* That after the war, the Stasi manipulated history to fit their own agenda, specifically to reinforce the prescribed German-Soviet friendship and to legitimise its own spying activity as anti-fascist.

Johannes Tuchel, Director of the &quot;Memorial to the German Resistance&quot; commented on the astonishing agreement between the east and the west, in the reception that the group received. Tuchel noted how the historical context, as defined by the Gestapo, was transported into the Cold War and as result, falsified the legacy of the group, e.g. the impressive AGIS pamphlets.

In 2017, French author Guillaume Bourgeois, published the &quot;La véritable histoire de l&#x27;Orchestre rouge&quot;, offering a thorough analysis of the Trepper group. It tries to address the lack of sources in prior years that is accomplished by a rigorous examination of German and Soviet archives, in an attempt to provide an accurate historical revision. Bourgeois&#x27;s conclusion on how little strategic information came from the apparatus of the Orchestra, i.e. from Brussels or Paris, was new.

===Karl Barth tribute===
The theologian Karl Barth made a rare exception to the West German assessment of the 1950s when he declared the group to be a model of the church resistance because of its openness to people from different social classes, its efforts to protect Jews and the timely clarification of the War Plans of the Nazi&#x27;s. In his speech to the Hessian state government during the Volkstrauertag of 1954 in Wiesbaden, he stated:

:&quot;And no matter whether it suits us today or not, we shouldn&#x27;t hide the fact that there was also such a thing as a &#x27;Red Orchestra&#x27;: communists who were also involved in this struggle and also fell as victims of Nazism. No matter what their ideological background was and what one might think of their particular motivations and actions: these people didn&#x27;t want to be part of what the Nazis wanted; they wanted to set a limit to their depraved and ruinous regime, to put an end to it. [...] Had they succeeded, it might have rendered a large amount of further human as well as material sacrifices unnecessary. But they didn&#x27;t succeed. And this was not just their own fault, but was also because so few in Germany were willing to join and help them with determination, before it became safe to do so, and that they received so little understanding or meaningful assistance from outside&quot;

These and other speeches provoked outrage and rejection in the audience at the time.

===Painting===
From 1936 to 1941, the artist Carl Baumann was a student at the Academy of Arts in Berlin. Baumann was also a resistance fighter, who was in contact with Schulze-Boysen. In 1941, he created &quot;Rote Kapelle Berlin&quot;, his famous painting that is located in the Stadtmuseum in Münster in which he portrays Harro Schulze-Boysen, Walter Küchenmeister and Kurt Schumacher building a bridge away from Nazism.

*&quot;Rote Kapelle Berlin&quot; (1941) Tempera on Nesse, 79×99 cm in Westphalian State Museum of Art and Cultural History in Münster.

===Literature===
The writer Günther Weisenborn was arrested as a member of the resistance group in 1942 and was sentenced to death, but was later reduced to ten years in prison. Weisenborn dedicated his play in three acts &quot;The Illegals&quot; (German:Die Illegalen), to the resistance group, which premiered on 21 March 1946. In it, he portrayed two organised resistance fighters as tragic individuals whose love for each other fails due to the forced isolation and secrecy of their resistance work.

The writer and artist, Peter Weiss dedicated his magnum opus, three-volume novel &quot;The Aesthetics of Resistance&quot; to the resistance from 1971 to 1981 celebrating their courage. For him, the resistance was the organisation in which it was possible to overcome the division of the labour movement into social democrats and communists in the common struggle against fascism.

===Film===

In 1970, DEFA made the film &quot;KLK an PTX – Die Rote Kapelle&quot; under the direction of Horst E. Brandt based on a screenplay by Wera and Claus Küchenmeister. The Harnacks were played by Horst Drinda and Irma Münch, Horst Schulze and Barbara Adolph played the Kuckhoffs, Klaus Piontek and Jutta Wachowiak played the Schulze-Boysens.

In 1972, the ARD released the multi-part TV series &quot;Die rote Kapelle&quot; by Franz Peter Wirth based on a screenplay by Peter Adler and Hans Gottschalk.

In 1989 the Yuri Ozerov film, &quot;Stalingrad&quot; was released, in which the Red Orchestra&#x27;s espionage activities are one of several storylines.

In 2003, Stefan Roloff&#x27;s second documentary, &quot;The Rote Kapelle&quot;, a portrait of his late father, Helmut Roloff, a resistance fighter and companion book &quot;Rote Kapelle&quot; corrected the Cold War-shaped image for the first time and told the true story of the resistance group through interviews with survivors and contemporary witnesses. It was premiered at the Memorial to the German Resistance, followed by cinema screenings, including in Berlin and New York, where he was nominated for Best Foreign Film 2005 by the US Women Critics.

In 2017, the documentary &quot;The good enemies. My Father, the Red Orchestra and I&quot; by Christian Weisenborn was released, consisting of private film material, excerpts of letters and diaries as well as interviews with relatives and authors. Weisenborn devotes a great deal of attention to the representation of the perspective of women in the resistance group and recalls that the story of resistance is still told primarily as one of men in the resistance.

<doc id="436607" wikidata="Q131425" url="?curid=436607" title="Visual kei">
<text>, abbreviated , is a category of Japanese musicians that have a strong focus on extravagant stage costumes that originated in Japan during the early 1980s. Koji Dejima of &quot;Bounce&quot; wrote that visual kei is not a specific sound, but rather it &quot;revolves around the creation of a band&#x27;s unique worldview and/or stylistic beauty through visual expressions in the form of makeup and fashion&quot;. While visual kei acts can be of any music genre, it originated with bands influenced by glam rock, heavy metal, punk rock and gothic rock.

Visual kei was pioneered by groups such as X Japan, Dead End, Buck-Tick, D&#x27;erlanger, and Color, and gained further notoriety in the 1990s through the success of groups like Luna Sea, Glay, L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel, and Malice Mizer. The movement&#x27;s success continued through the 2000s with Gackt and more musically broad bands such as Dir En Grey, the Gazette, Alice Nine, Girugamesh, and Versailles, a period which some critics term . Many acts tone-down their appearance upon achieving mainstream success, calling into question whether they are still to be considered visual kei.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;visual kei&quot; was derived from one of X Japan&#x27;s slogans, &quot;Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock&quot;, seen on the cover of their second studio album &quot;Blue Blood&quot; (1989). This derivation is credited as being coined by Seiichi Hoshiko, the founding editor of &quot;Shoxx&quot; magazine, which was founded in 1990 as the first publication devoted to the subject. However, he explained in a 2018 interview with &quot;JRock News&quot; that visual kei was technically coined, or at least inspired by, X Japan&#x27;s lead guitarist hide. Hoshiko also said that at the time they were called , &quot;but it simply felt... too cheap... Even though X Japan was a big band and people used the term &#x27;Okeshou kei&#x27; to describe them, the term was still lacking substance, I didn&#x27;t like the term at all! Because of this, I tried to remind all the writers to not use this term as &#x27;They are not okeshou kei, they are visual-shock kei&#x27;. From there, it went from &#x27;Visual-shock kei&#x27; to &#x27;Visual-kei&#x27; to &#x27;V-kei&#x27;. After we spread the word, fans naturally abbreviated it to &#x27;V-kei&#x27;. The Japanese love to abbreviate everything as a matter of fact.&quot; Hoshiko considers visual kei a distinctive Japanese music genre and defined it &quot;as the music itself along with all the visual aspects of it.&quot;

==History==

===1980–1992: Origins and success===
Visual kei emerged in the 1980s Japanese underground music scene, pioneered by bands such as X Japan, Dead End, Buck-Tick, D&#x27;erlanger, and Color. Music journalist Taiyo Sawada noted the musical diversity of the scene&#x27;s early acts; some had strong metal influence, some were influenced by 1980s goth and new wave, while others evolved from hardcore punk. Japanese pop culture website &quot;Real Sound&quot; wrote that similarities between the appearances and behavior of the founders of visual kei and members of the &quot;yankī&quot; delinquent subculture are often noted. The movement designated a new form of Japanese rock music influenced by Western hard rock and glam metal acts like Kiss, Twisted Sister, Hanoi Rocks, Mötley Crüe. In &quot;The George Mason Review&quot;, Megan Pfeifle described the movement as being roughly divided into two generations, with the first in three transitional eras, of which the first era lasted just over a decade.
In the late 1980s and until the mid-1990s, visual kei received increasing popularity throughout Japan, when album sales from such bands started to reach record numbers. The first band with recordings that achieved notable success was Dead End, whose independent album &quot;Dead Line&quot; (1986) sold over 20,000 copies, and whose major label debut album &quot;Ghost of Romance&quot; (1987) released by Victor Entertainment reached No. 14 on the Oricon Albums Chart. That same year, Buck-Tick released their major debut &quot;Sexual XXXXX!&quot; through the same record label. Dead End even had albums &quot;Ghost of Romance&quot; and &quot;Shámbara&quot; (1988) released by American label Metal Blade Records, with radio station and MTV exposure in the United States. In 1990, D&#x27;erlanger&#x27;s major debut album &quot;Basilisk&quot; reached No. 5 on the Oricon chart, but they and Dead End both disbanded that same year.

In 1988 and 1989, Buck-Tick and X Japan started to gain mainstream success that continues to present-day. Buck Tick&#x27;s single &quot;Just One More Kiss&quot; entered No. 6 and &quot;Aku no Hana&quot; is first visual kei No. 1 single on the Oricon Singles Chart, while their studio albums &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; (1988) and &quot;Taboo&quot; (1989) charted at No. 3 and 1 respectively and were the first Japanese rock band to hold a concert at the Tokyo Dome. They continued to have success, with nearly all of their subsequent albums topping the charts until 1995 and later reaching the top ten on the charts. X Japan&#x27;s first album, the independently released &quot;Vanishing Vision&quot;, reached No. 19 in 1988, making them the first indie band to appear on the main Oricon Albums Chart. Their second and major debut album &quot;Blue Blood&quot; (1989) reached number 6 and has since sold 712,000 copies. Their third and best-selling album &quot;Jealousy&quot; was released in 1991, topped the charts and sold over 1 million copies. They went on to release two more number one studio albums, &quot;Art of Life&quot; (1993) and &quot;Dahlia&quot; (1996). In 1992, X Japan tried to launch an attempt to enter the American market, even signing with Atlantic Records for a US album, but this ultimately did not happen.

Two record labels formed in 1986, Extasy Records (Tokyo) and Free-Will (Osaka), were instrumental in promoting the visual kei scene. Extasy was created by X Japan drummer and leader Yoshiki and signed bands, not limited to visual kei acts, that would go on to make marks on the Japanese music scene, including , Tokyo Yankees and Ladies Room. Luna Sea and Glay, who both went on to sell millions of records, with Glay being one of Japan&#x27;s best-selling musical acts, had their first albums released by Extasy in 1991 and 1994 respectively. Free-Will was founded by Color vocalist and leader Dynamite Tommy, and while at the time not as popular as Extasy, it had many moderately successful acts, such as By-Sexual and Kamaitachi.

===1993–2000: Expansion and decline===

Pfeifle described the second transition era as beginning in 1993 with bands such as L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel, Glay (although formed in 1988, their first album was released in 1994) and Malice Mizer. They gained mainstream awareness, although they were not as commercially successful, except for L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel and Glay whose later huge success was accompanied by a drastic change in their appearance and are often not associated with visual kei. Around 1995, visual kei bands experienced a booming success in the general population, which lasted for four years. According to Pfeifle, the third transition era began by bands such as La&#x27;cryma Christi, Penicillin and Rouage achieving moderate success. At the time, &quot;the big four of visual kei&quot; were Malice Mizer, La&#x27;cryma Christi, Shazna and Fanatic Crisis.

Around the early 1990s, a visual kei scene that placed more emphasize on music rather than fashion arouse in the city of Nagoya, and as such was later dubbed Nagoya kei. Silver-Rose (formed in 1989) and Kuroyume (formed in 1991) were described as the &quot;Nagoya big two&quot; in the underground scene, and with Laputa (formed in 1993), are credited with &quot;creating the early Nagoya kei style.&quot; Kuroyume&#x27;s albums &quot;Feminism&quot; (1995) and &quot;Fake Star&quot; (1996) both topped the Oricon chart. During the 1990s, several other conceptual subgenres like Eroguro kei (notably represented by Cali Gari), Angura kei (underground style, wearing traditional kimono or Japanese uniforms) and Ouji kei or Kodona kei (prince style or boy style, notably Plastic Tree) emerged. In 1998, Pierrot released their major debut single, and Dir En Grey&#x27;s first three major singles were released with the help of Yoshiki the following year. They were called &quot;the big two&quot; in the scene at that time.

By the late 1990s, the mainstream popularity of visual kei was declining; Luna Sea went on a year-long hiatus in 1997 before disbanding in 2000, X Japan disbanded at the end of 1997 and one year later their lead guitarist hide died. In 1999, Malice Mizer&#x27;s drummer Kami died after the departure of singer Gackt, who with a toned down appearance became one of the most popular and successful visual kei acts, and L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel publicly distanced themselves from the movement (although, in 2012 they were partly promoted internationally as a visual kei band). In 1998, &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Steve McClure commented that &quot;To a certain extent, hide&#x27;s death means the end of an era, X were the first generation of visual kei bands, but the novelty has worn off. For the next generation of bands, it&#x27;s like: &quot;That&#x27;s it. The torch has been passed to us&quot;&quot;. As other bands could not meet financial expectations, most major companies backed out of the movement, and it became an underground style often associated with the rebellious generation, non-conforming to proper society.

===2001–2009: International expansion and neo-visual kei===

A second generation emerged in small visual kei-specific live houses managed by record companies like PS Company (Free-Will) and Maverick DC Group. The difference between the first and second generation is that the second; has no straightforward music style, ranging from metal to pop, but still seemingly focused on heavy rock genres; the fashion and gender ambiguities are of central importance. Although economically not very significant in the Japanese music market, it became the first Japanese music to succeed on an international scale.

Notable newer visual kei bands include Dir En Grey, the Gazette, Alice Nine, D&#x27;espairsRay and Girugamesh, as well as solo performer Miyavi, who have all performed overseas. Veterans of the scene also established new acts, such as Malice Mizer&#x27;s Mana with his band Moi dix Mois and three members of Pierrot forming Angelo. In 2007, visual kei was revitalized as Yoshiki, Gackt, Sugizo and Miyavi formed supergroup Skin, Luna Sea performed a one-off performance and X Japan officially reunited with a new single and a world tour. With these developments, visual kei bands enjoyed a boost in public awareness, with acts formed around 2004 having been described by some media as &quot;neo-visual kei&quot;. From this generation the subgenre emerged, where the musicians produce upbeat pop rock and wear bright colorful attire. Pioneers of this style include Baroque, Kra, Charlotte and An Cafe.

Although the first international concert by a visual kei act was held in Taiwan by Luna Sea in 1999, it was not until 2002 that many visual kei bands started to perform worldwide (United States, in Europe from 2004), with the initial interest coming from Japanese-themed conventions like A-Konwhere bands like Psycho le Cemu performed. In the first five years Dir En Grey was especially well received having performed in Korn&#x27;s Family Values Tour in 2006. In 2007, the Jrock Revolution event was held in Los Angeles and featured visual kei bands. Although some bands like the Gazette have played at Tokyo Dome (not at full capacity), the majority of acts play in much smaller venues like Shibuya O-East. In 2009 the V-Rock Festival at Makuhari Messe was reported as the &quot;world&#x27;s largest Visual Kei music festival&quot; gathering over 50 &quot;visual artists,&quot; although this included some Western acts like Marilyn Manson. A second V-Rock Festival was held in 2011 at Saitama Super Arena.

===2009–present: Reunions and further expansion===

Dead End officially reunited in 2009 and La&#x27;cryma Christi (which disbanded in 2007) reunited for an anniversary tour in 2010. Kiyoharu announced the reformations of both Kuroyume and Sads, and Luna Sea reunited and began a world tour.

As an epilogue to their 25th anniversary, Luna Sea hosted a rock festival titled Lunatic Fest on 27 and 28 June 2015, with an estimated 60,000 fans attending. Held at Makuhari Messe, there were three stages and 12 artists, most visual kei acts including X Japan, Dead End, Dir En Grey, Siam Shade and Tokyo Yankees the first night, and Aion, Buck-Tick, D&#x27;erlanger, Glay and Mucc the second night.

A large three-day visual kei rock festival titled Visual Japan Summit was held at Makuhari Messe between October 14–16, 2016. Luna Sea hosted another two-day Lunatic Fest at Makuhari Messe on June 23 and 24, 2018.

According to sales figures from online music store CDJapan, some of the internationally popular visual kei acts on the late 2010s include the Gazette, Kamijo, Nocturnal Bloodlust, Versailles, Jupiter, Mejibray, lynch., Dimlim, Matenrou Opera, Miyavi, D, Diaura, Dadaroma, Initial&#x27;L, A9, Buck-Tick, Yoshiki, Hyde, Luna Sea, Mucc, Hizaki and Gackt.

In 2021, visual kei journalist Chiaki Fujitani noted how newer acts were combining visual kei with other elements to create originality. She cited Nocturnal Bloodlust&#x27;s muscular vocalist Hiro for defying the usual delicate appearance of visual kei musicians, 0.1g no Gosan for utilizing tropes of underground idols, such as playing tug of war with fans during concerts, Choke for their avant-garde form of rap metal, and former D&#x27;espairsRay drummer Tsukasa Mogamigawa for being the first visual kei &quot;enka&quot; singer. Mai Yajima&#x27;s singing style has been referred to as &quot;&quot;enka&quot; rock&quot;. Moi dix Mois, Versailles, D and Matenrou Opera teamed up for the four-date Japanese Visual Metal tour in late 2023 and released a collaborative single.

==Characteristics==

Sources have variously referred to visual kei as a movement, scene, subculture, and music genre. It is not associated with any one musical style, as visual kei artists play a variety of genres including punk rock, heavy metal, pop, electronica, classical, and industrial. Instead, it is defined by an act&#x27;s emphasis on aesthetics, particularly their fashion and use of makeup, with a number of visual kei artists and critics describing it as a freedom of expression and experimental fashion. Koji Dejima of &quot;Bounce&quot; wrote that visual kei &quot;revolves around the creation of a band&#x27;s unique worldview and/or stylistic beauty through visual expressions in the form of makeup and fashion&quot;. Sources have also noted that visual kei is a &quot;uniquely Japanese&quot; phenomenon.

Visual kei musicians often have elaborate, dyed hair, extravagant costumes, frequently with leather, PVC or lace, or based on traditional Japanese clothing pieces, and excessive jewelry. Many musicians make use of androgynous and gender bending aesthetics, with some of its male musicians cross-dressing in a manner similar to traditional Japanese &quot;onnagata&quot; performers. This rose to prominence through the success of Malice Mizer, whose guitarist Mana performed dressed as a woman and singer Gackt was a &quot;living specimen of &quot;bishōnen&quot;&quot;. Such aesthetics are reminiscent of those seen in shōjo manga. Different artists have taken aesthetic influence from various fashion styles including glam, metalhead, punk, goth and cyberpunk. Dejima generalized visual kei as being based on the androgynous sensibilities of the New Romantic movement and Los Angeles metal scene, or the goth subculture, and topped off with elements from &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;taboo&quot; interests such as Lolita, psychopathy, and the occult. Many subsects of visual kei exist to describe separate styles. Eroguro kei is one such subsect which is influenced by BDSM and horror imagery, while angura kei makes use of traditional Japanese clothing styles like kimonos. Many acts tone-down their appearance upon achieving mainstream success, calling into question whether they are still to be considered visual kei.

In addition to the visual aspects, visual kei artists often have a wider &quot;decorative fantasy&quot; concept or context and their on-stage performances are &quot;overwhelming, multisensory experiences whose constructed nature is made apparent to audiences&quot; (e.g. observed in Gackt&#x27;s career claim about being a vampire).

==Criticism==
There has been criticism directed at newer visual kei bands for having lost the spirit of their forefathers by copying each other in design and sound, and becoming all the same. As far back as 1998, Neil Strauss reported that to visual kei bands &quot;after X&quot; makeup and outrageous looks became &quot;more important than music.&quot; Several musicians have expressed their discontent; in 2008, Kirito (Pierrot, Angelo) said &quot;now it&#x27;s more like people are dressing up a certain way because they want to be visual kei or look visual kei. They are doing it to look like others instead of doing it to look different. This is obviously very different from when we started out more than ten years ago,&quot; while Sugizo (Luna Sea) stated in 2010 that &quot;they cannot make good sounds and music is more like a hobby for them. I cannot feel their soul in the music.&quot;

Although almost from the newer generation himself, Dir En Grey bassist Toshiya said in 2010 &quot;to be honest, when we first started and we were wearing a lot of makeup on stage and stuff, there were a lot of bands doing that at the time in Japan and people thought it was cool. But not anymore, ha ha.&quot; and added &quot;the music was so unique, too – bands like X Japan. At that time, there weren&#x27;t any two bands that sounded alike; these days everyone sounds exactly the same.&quot; Kenzi (Kamaitachi, The Dead Pop Stars, Anti Feminism) commented in 2009 that &quot;back in the day, there were bands, but people would try to do things differently. Nowadays, there&#x27;s one band and everyone copies off of them,&quot; with Free-Will founder and Color frontman Tommy concluding with &quot;I don&#x27;t think our breed of visual kei exists anymore.&quot; In 2013, Kiyoharu (Kuroyume, Sads) said that although he, Ryuichi (Luna Sea) and Hyde (L&#x27;Arc-en-Ciel) were influenced by Morrie (Dead End), they &quot;sublimated each other&quot; inventing something new, but the younger generation is more imitative. He proposed that from Morrie&#x27;s perspective this probably appears to be a &quot;copy of his copy&#x27;s copy&quot;. In the same interview, Morrie added that the problem with new visual kei bands is that &quot;they&#x27;re established as a genre... well, there&#x27;s probably a part of it that&#x27;s business-wise, but it wouldn&#x27;t be fun if it got stiff. I would like to see people who are trying to break through that area. It doesn&#x27;t matter how good you are, whether you&#x27;re doing it on the visual kei route or not, it&#x27;s something fundamental.&quot;

&quot;Time Out Tokyo&quot;″s Bunny Bissoux concluded in 2015 that the movement &quot;today is basically a parallel of the J-pop idol system&quot; and &quot;that originally prided itself on being different, it now attracts those who want to &#x27;look&#x27; visual kei. Genuine originality (in the music, at least) seems to be dying out.&quot; In 2018, Seiichi Hoshiko said that he was worried about this trend&#x27;s effect on the movement&#x27;s future.

==Popularity==

Magazines published regularly in Japan with visual kei coverage are &quot;Arena 37 °C&quot;, &quot;Cure&quot;, &quot;Fool&#x27;s Mate Express&quot;, &quot;Shoxx&quot;, &quot;Shock Wave&quot;, &quot;Rock and Read&quot; among others. The popularity and awareness of visual kei groups outside Japan has seen an increase in recent years, mostly through internet and Japanese anime, shown for example by German magazines &quot;Peach&quot; (discontinued in 2011) and &quot;Koneko&quot;, as well European record label Gan-Shin. The biggest fan communities are found in United States, Germany, Poland, Russia, France and Brazil and to some extent Finland, Chile and Sweden.

From this influence on international youth subcultures, bands like Cinema Bizarre emerged, but they hesitate to consider themselves visual kei because they are not ethnically Japanese. Despite the existence of visually similar music acts in the West such as Marilyn Manson, Tokio Hotel and Lady Gaga, Pfeifle writes that the androgynous look of visual kei bands often has a repulsive effect on Westerners.

According to the musicologists, the Lacanist psychoanalysis of the subculture indicates that the fascination with the singer&#x27;s voice (the lack of understanding amplifies the effect), as well ineffable and unfulfillable desire, are what attracts most of the (predominantly female) fans to the groups on an international scale. The female fans () show a behavioral pattern while attending the concerts, and there are several &quot;furi&quot; (movements) like &quot;tesensu&quot; (arm fan), &quot;gyakudai&quot; (reversed dive), &quot;hedoban&quot; (headbang), &quot;saku&quot; (spread hands in the air). The explicit fan fiction and homoerotic acts on the stage by some musicians, called fan service (a sexual term borrowed from manga culture), are related to the Lacanian man&#x27;s type of desire (to be recognized by the other, desire of the other), i.e. the female fans do not desire the musician himself, but his desire; a kind of cultural social training ground for the inescapable process of learning how to desire.

<text>James Townshend Saward (1798 – c. 1875) was a Victorian English barrister and forger also known by the nickname of Jem the Penman. In addition to his legal career he forged money orders for almost 30 years.

==Early life==
James Townshend Saward was born in 1798 at Rotherhithe in Surrey, the son of James and Elizabeth Ann Saward. He was called to the Bar in 1840, became a barrister and had his chambers in the Inner Temple. With his wife Maria he had a son, Francis (born 1831), and a daughter, Henrietta (born 1837).

==Career==

At the time a normal forging method was to forge somebody&#x27;s signature and take the money order in to bank. The only hope to recover the money was if the clerk remembered the culprit&#x27;s face. To bypass even this risk, Saward decided to cover his tracks with a string of accomplices.

Saward required blank cheques and told his accomplices to spread a rumor that they would pay well for stolen cheques; pickpockets usually threw them away as useless. If he got used cheques into his hands, he could try to imitate the signature. If the holder of the account had a special signature he used only in his cheques, Saward sent an accomplice to acquire a copy. One solicitor was fooled by asking him to collect a debt; Saward got the signature when he paid the debt minus his commission by a cheque.

Saward cashed the cheques by handing them over to an accomplice called Anderson, who gave them to another accomplice called Atwell. Atwell disguised himself, hired a messenger and sent him to the bank to get the money. Anderson followed Atwell to make sure he really did hand over all the money and later gave him his cut. When the bank became suspicious, they had only the errand boy to question. This way Saward got a couple of hundred pounds at a time.

In addition, Saward and his associates fenced stolen goods; they helped with the disposal of the stolen gold from the Great Gold Robbery of 1855.

Eventually banks grew suspicious in London and Saward decided to try his luck elsewhere. In Great Yarmouth, another accomplice called Hardwicke blundered when he opened an account with one name and commissioned solicitors to collect &quot;debts&quot; by another name. When he realized his mistake, he asked for instructions. By the time Saward&#x27;s answer came, the bank had warned the police who were already questioning Hardwicke. They opened the letter and found out his identity.

The Great Yarmouth accomplices confessed and turned Queen&#x27;s Evidence. Saward and Anderson were arrested and went to trial in March 1857. They were sentenced to transportation for life and sent to Australia.

==In popular culture==
In his play, &quot;Jim the Penman&quot; (1886), British baronet, barrister and playwright Sir Charles Young, 7th Baronet expanded the scope of the fictional version of Saward, making him a leader of an international forgery ring who forged letters to marry into high society. The play was later adapted into two films, both titled &quot;Jim the Penman&quot;, in 1915 with John B. Mason, and in 1921 with Lionel Barrymore playing Saward.

Saward has been referred to as &quot;a &#x27;real-life&#x27; Professor Moriarty&quot;.

<doc id="436612" wikidata="Q1451644" url="?curid=436612" title="Cato Street Conspiracy">
<text>The Cato Street Conspiracy was a plot to murder all the British cabinet ministers and the Prime Minister Lord Liverpool in 1820. The name comes from the meeting place near Edgware Road in London. The police had an informer; the plotters fell into a police trap. Thirteen were arrested, while one policeman, Richard Smithers, was killed. Five conspirators were executed, and five others were transported to Australia.

How widespread the Cato Street conspiracy was is uncertain. It was a time of unrest; rumours abounded. Malcolm Chase noted that &quot;the London-Irish community and a number of trade societies, notably shoemakers, were prepared to lend support, while unrest and awareness of a planned rising were widespread in the industrial north and on Clydeside.&quot;

== Origins ==
The conspirators were called the Spencean Philanthropists, a group taking their name from the British radical speaker Thomas Spence. The group was known for being a revolutionary organisation, involved in unrest and propaganda and plotting the overthrow of the government.

Some of them, particularly Arthur Thistlewood, had been involved with the Spa Fields riots in 1816. Thistlewood came to dominate the group with George Edwards as his second in command. Edwards was a police spy. Most of the members were angered by the Six Acts and the Peterloo Massacre, as well as with the economic depression and political conditions of the time.

The conspirators planned to assassinate the cabinet which was supposed to be together at a dinner. They would then seize key buildings, overthrow the government and establish a &quot;Committee of Public Safety&quot; to oversee a radical revolution. According to the prosecution at their trial, they had intended to form a provisional government headquartered in the Mansion House.

== Governmental crisis ==

Hard economic times encouraged social unrest. The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 further worsened the economy and saw the return of job-seeking veterans. King George III&#x27;s death on 29 January 1820 created a new governmental crisis. In a meeting held on 22 February, George Edwards suggested that the group could exploit the political situation and kill all the cabinet ministers after invading a fabricated cabinet dinner at the home of Lord Harrowby, Lord President of the Council, armed with pistols and grenades. Edwards even provided funds to help arm the conspirators.

Thistlewood thought the act would trigger a massive uprising against the government. James Ings, a coffeeshop keeper and former butcher, later announced that he would have decapitated all the cabinet members and taken two heads to exhibit on Westminster Bridge. Thistlewood spent the next hours trying to recruit more men for the attack. Twenty-seven men joined the effort.

== Discovery ==
When Jamaican-born William Davidson, who had worked for Lord Harrowby, went to find more details about the cabinet dinner, a servant in Lord Harrowby&#x27;s house told him that his master was not at home. When Davidson told this to Thistlewood he refused to believe it and demanded that the operation commence at once. John Harrison rented a small house in Cato Street as the base of operations. Edwards kept the police fully informed. Some of the other members had suspected Edwards, but Thistlewood had made him his top aide.

Edwards had presented the idea with the full knowledge of the Home Office, which had also put the advertisement about the supposed dinner in &quot;The New Times&quot;. When he reported that his would-be-comrades would be ready to follow his suggestion, the Home Office decided to act.

== Arrest ==

On 23 February, Richard Birnie, Bow Street magistrate, and George Ruthven, another police spy, went to wait at a public house on the other side of the street of the Cato Street building with twelve officers of the Bow Street Runners. Birnie and Ruthven waited for the afternoon because they had been promised reinforcements from the Coldstream Guards, under the command of Captain FitzClarence, an illegitimate son of the Duke of Clarence (later William IV). Thistlewood&#x27;s group arrived during that time. At 7:30 pm, the Bow Street Runners decided to apprehend the conspirators themselves.

In the resulting brawl, Thistlewood killed Bow Street Runner Richard Smithers with a sword. Some conspirators surrendered peacefully, while others resisted forcefully. William Davidson was captured; Thistlewood, Robert Adams, John Brunt and John Harrison slipped out through the back window, but were arrested a few days later.

== Charges ==
&quot;1. Conspiring to devise plans to subvert the Constitution. 2. Conspiring to levy war, and subvert the Constitution. 3. Conspiring to murder divers of the Privy Council. 4. Providing arms to murder divers of the Privy Council. 5. Providing arms and ammunition to levy war and subvert the Constitution. 6. Conspiring to seize cannon, arms and ammunition to arm themselves, and to levy war and subvert the Constitution. 7. Conspiring to burn houses and barracks, and to provide combustibles for that purpose. 8. Preparing addresses, &amp;c. containing incitements to the King&#x27;s subjects to assist in levying war and subverting the Constitution. 9. Preparing an address to the King&#x27;s subjects, containing therein that their tyrants were destroyed, &amp;c., to incite them to assist in levying war, and in subverting the Constitution. 10. Assembling themselves with arms, with intent to murder divers of the Privy Council, and to levy war, and subvert the Constitution. 11. Levying war.&quot;

== Trial and executions ==

During the trial, the defence argued that the statement of Edwards, a government spy, was unreliable and he was therefore never called to testify. Police persuaded two of the men, Robert Adams and John Monument, to testify against other conspirators in exchange for dropped charges. On 28 April most of the accused were sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered for high treason. All sentences were later commuted, at least in respect of this medieval form of execution, to hanging and beheading. The death sentences of Charles Cooper, Richard Bradburn, John Harrison, James Wilson and John Strange were commuted to transportation for life.

Thistlewood, Tidd, Ings, Davidson and Brunt were hanged at Newgate Prison on the morning of 1 May 1820 in front of a crowd of many thousands, some having paid as much as three guineas for a good vantage point from the windows of houses overlooking the scaffold. Infantry were stationed nearby, out of sight of the crowd, two troops of Life Guards were present, and eight artillery pieces were deployed commanding the road at Blackfriars Bridge. Large banners had been prepared with a painted order to disperse. These were to be displayed to the crowd if trouble caused the authorities to invoke the Riot Act. However, the behaviour of the multitude was &quot;peaceable in the extreme&quot;.

The hangman was John Foxton. After the bodies had hung for half an hour, they were lowered one at a time and an unidentified individual in a black mask decapitated them against an angled block with a small knife. Each beheading was accompanied by shouts, booing and hissing from the crowd and each head was displayed to the assembled spectators, declaring it to be the head of a traitor, before placing it in the coffin with the remainder of the body.
== Legacy ==
The British government used the incident to justify the Six Acts that had been passed two months before. However, in the House of Commons Matthew Wood MP accused the government of purposeful entrapment of the conspirators to smear the campaign for parliamentary reform. Although there is evidence that Edwards did incite certain actions of the conspirators, the idea is not supported by modern historians. However, the otherwise pro-government newspaper &quot;The Observer&quot; ignored the order of the Lord Chief Justice Sir Charles Abbott not to report the trial before the sentencing.

The treasonous plot is the subject of many books, as well as a play, &quot;Cato Street&quot;, written by the actor and author Robert Shaw, and a 2019 Edinburgh Fringe show, &quot;Cato Street 1820&quot;, written and performed by David Benson. The conspiracy was also the basis for a 1976 BBC Radio 4 drama &#x27;Thistlewood&#x27; by Stewart Conn and 2001 radio drama, &quot;Betrayal: The Trial of William Davidson&quot;, by Tanika Gupta.

1A Cato Street was listed in 1974 for its association with the conspiracy. The Greater London Council unveiled a blue plaque on the building in 1977.

== Historiography ==
Historian Caitlin Kitchener has used the theoretical framework of wound culture to examine the visual culture that was produced as a response to the incident. This included prints, newspaper illustrations and other publications.

<doc id="436614" wikidata="Q7143180" url="?curid=436614" title="Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man">
<text>&quot;Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker&#x27;s man&quot;, &quot;Pat-a-Cake&quot;, &quot;Patty-cake&quot; or &quot;Pattycake&quot; is an English nursery rhyme. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 6486.

== Verse ==

:Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker&#x27;s man.
:Bake me a cake as fast as you can
:Roll it, pat it, and mark it with a B
:Put it in the oven for Baby and me.

==Origins==
The earliest recorded version of the rhyme appears in Thomas D&#x27;Urfey&#x27;s play &quot;The Campaigners&quot; from 1698, where a nurse says to her charges:

...and pat a cake Bakers man, so I will master as I can, and prick it, and prick it, and prick it, and prick it, and prick it, and throw&#x27;t into the Oven.

The next appearance is in &quot;Mother Goose&#x27;s Melody&quot; (c. 1765) in the form:

:Patty Cake, Patty Cake,
:Baker&#x27;s Man;
:That I will Master,
:As fast as I can;
:Pat it and prick it,
:And mark it with a T,
:And there will be enough for Tommy and me.

Marking pastry or baked goods with an identifiable mark may stem from a time when households without an oven of their own could take their items to a local baker or bake house, paying to have their items finished for a small fee. Marking the pastry would have been a way to ensure the return of the proper item.

The earliest version set to music appears in James Hook&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Box&quot; (1796).

==Game==

The rhyme often accompanies a clapping game between two people. It alternates between a normal individual clap by one person with two-handed claps with the other person. The hands may be crossed as well. This allows for a possibly complex sequence of clapping that must be coordinated between the two. If told by a parent to a child, the &quot;B&quot; and &quot;baby&quot; in the last two lines are sometimes replaced by the child&#x27;s first initial and first name.

The &quot;pat-a-cake&quot; song and clapping game was used by Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in their series of &quot;Road to&quot; films. The gag worked by means of adding a synchronised punch into the clapping game routine, allowing them to make their escape.

Patty-cake appears as a plot point in the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, where it is made out to be the cartoon equivalent of sex.

<doc id="436616" wikidata="Q209496" url="?curid=436616" title="Alawites">
<text>Alawites are an ethnoreligious group who live primarily in the Levant region in West Asia and follow Alawism. A sect of Islam that splintered from early Shia as a &quot;ghulat&quot; branch during the ninth century, Alawites venerate Ali ibn Abi Talib, the &quot;first Imam&quot; in the Twelver school, as a manifestation of the divine essence. The group was founded by Ibn Nusayr during the 9th century, who was a disciple of the tenth Twelver Imam, Ali al-Hadi, and of the eleventh Twelver Imam, Hasan al-Askari. For this reason, Alawites are also called Nusayris.

Surveys suggest Alawites represent an important portion of the Syrian population and are a significant minority in the Hatay Province of Turkey and northern Lebanon. There is also a population living in the village of Ghajar in the Golan Heights, where there had been two other Alawite villages (Ayn Fit and Za&#x27;ura) before the Six-Day War. The Alawites form the dominant religious group on the Syrian coast and towns near the coast, which are also inhabited by Sunnis, Christians, and Ismailis. They are often confused with the Alevis, a distinct religious group in Turkey that shares some similarities with the Alawites but also has key differences.

The Quran is only one of their holy books and texts, and their interpretation thereof has very little in common with the Shia Muslim interpretation but is in accordance with the early Batiniyya and other &quot;ghulat&quot; sects. Alawite theology and rituals differ sharply from Shia Islam in several important ways. For instance various Alawite rituals involve the drinking of wine and the sect does not prohibit the consumption of alcohol for its adherents. As a creed that teaches the symbolic/esoteric reading of Qur&#x27;anic verses, Alawite theology is based on the belief in reincarnation and views Ali as a divine incarnation of God. Moreover, Alawite clergy and scholarship insist that their religion is also theologically distinct from Shi&#x27;ism.

Alawites have historically kept their beliefs secret from outsiders and non-initiated Alawites, so rumours about them have arisen. Arabic accounts of their beliefs tend to be partisan (either positively or negatively). However, since the early 2000s, Western scholarship on the Alawite religion has made significant advances. At the core of the Alawite creed is the belief in a divine Trinity, comprising three aspects of the one God. The aspects of the Trinity are &quot;Mana&quot; (meaning), &quot;Ism&quot; (Name) and &quot;Bab&quot; (Door). Alawite beliefs hold that these emanations underwent re-incarnation cyclically seven times in human form throughout history. According to Alawites, the seventh incarnation of the trinity consists of Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad and Salman al-Farisi.

Alawites, considered disbelievers by classical Sunni and Shi&#x27;ite theologians, faced periods of subjugation or persecution under various Muslim empires such as the Ottomans, Abbasids, Mamluks, and others. The establishment of the French Mandate of Syria in 1920 marked a turning point in Alawite history. Until then, the community had commonly self-identified as &quot;Nusayris&quot;, emphasizing their connections to Ibn Nusayr. The French administration prescribed the label &quot;Alawite&quot; to categorise the sect alongside Shiism in official documents. The French recruited a large number of minorities into their armed forces and created exclusive areas for minorities, including the Alawite State. The Alawite State was later dismantled, but the Alawites continued to play a significant role in the Syrian military and later in the Ba&#x27;ath Party. After Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s seizure of power during the 1970 coup, the Ba&#x27;athist state enforced Assadist ideology amongst Alawites to supplant their traditional identity. During the Syrian revolution, communal tensions were further exacerbated as the country destabilized into a full-scale sectarian civil war.

== Etymology ==
In older sources Alawis are often called &quot;Ansaris&quot;. According to Samuel Lyde, who lived among the Alawites during the mid-19th century, this was a term they used among themselves. Other sources indicate that &quot;Ansari&quot; is simply a Western error in the transliteration of &quot;Nusayri&quot;. Alawites historically self-identified as Nusayrites, after their religious founder Ibn Nusayr al-Numayri. However, the term &quot;Nusayri&quot; had fallen out of currency by the 1920s, as a movement led by intellectuals within the community during the French Mandate sought to replace it with the modern term &quot;Alawi&quot;. The term &quot;Nusayrites&quot; is now used as a slur.

They characterised the older name (which implied &quot;a separate ethnic and religious identity&quot;) as an &quot;invention of the sect&#x27;s enemies&quot;, ostensibly favouring an emphasis on &quot;connection with mainstream Islam&quot;—particularly the Shia branch. The French also popularised the term &quot;Alawite&quot;. As such, &quot;Nusayri&quot; is now generally regarded as antiquated, and has even come to have insulting and abusive connotations. The term was frequently employed as hate speech by Sunni fundamentalists fighting against Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s government in the Syrian civil war, who use its emphasis on Ibn Nusayr in order to insinuate that Alawi beliefs are &quot;man-made&quot; and not divinely inspired.

Necati Alkan argued in an article that the &quot;Alawi&quot; appellation was used in an 11th century Nusayri book and was not a 20th century invention. The following quote from the same article illustrates his point: &quot;As to the change from &quot;Nuṣayrī&quot; to &quot;ʿAlawī&quot;: most studies agree that the term &quot;ʿAlawī&quot; was not used until after WWI and probably coined and circulated by Muḥammad Amīn Ghālib al-Ṭawīl, an Ottoman official and writer of the famous &quot;Taʾrīkh al-ʿAlawiyyīn&quot; (1924). In actual fact, the name &#x27;Alawī&#x27; appears as early as in an 11th century Nuṣayrī tract as one the names of the believer (…). Moreover, the term &#x27;Alawī&#x27; was already used at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1903 the Belgian-born Jesuit and Orientalist Henri Lammens (d. 1937) visited a certain Ḥaydarī-Nuṣayrī sheikh Abdullah in a village near Antakya and mentions that the latter preferred the name &#x27;Alawī&#x27; for his people. Lastly, it is interesting to note that in the above-mentioned petitions of 1892 and 1909 the Nuṣayrīs called themselves the &#x27;Arab Alawī people&#x27; (ʿArab ʿAlevī ṭāʾifesi) &#x27;our ʿAlawī Nuṣayrī people&#x27; (ṭāʾifatunā al-Nuṣayriyya al-ʿAlawiyya) or &#x27;signed with Alawī people&#x27; (ʿAlevī ṭāʾifesi imżāsıyla). This early self-designation is, in my opinion, of triple importance. Firstly, it shows that the word &#x27;Alawī&#x27; was always used by these people, as ʿAlawī authors emphasize; secondly, it hints at the reformation of the Nuṣayrīs, launched by some of their sheikhs in the 19th century and their attempt to be accepted as part of Islam; and thirdly, it challenges the claims that the change of the identity and name from &#x27;Nuṣayrī&#x27; to &#x27;ʿAlawī&#x27; took place around 1920, in the beginning of the French mandate in Syria (1919–1938).&quot;

The Alawites are distinct from the &quot;Alevi&quot; religious sect in Turkey, although the terms share a common etymology and pronunciation.

== Genealogical origin theories ==
The origin of the genetics of Alawites is disputed. Local folklore suggests that they are descendants of the followers of the eleventh Imam, Hasan al-Askari (d. 873), and his pupil, Ibn Nusayr (d. 868). During the 19th and 20th centuries some Western scholars believed that Alawites were descended from ancient Middle Eastern peoples such as the Arameans, Canaanites, Hittites, and Mardaites. Many prominent Alawite tribes are also descended from 13th century settlers from Sinjar.

In his Natural History, Book V, Pliny the Elder said:
The &quot;Tetrarchy of the Nazerini&quot; refers to the western region, between the Orontes and the sea, which consists of a small mountain range called Alawi Mountains bordered by a valley running from south-east to north-west known as Al-Ghab Plain; the region was populated by a portion of Syrians, who were called Nazerini. However scholars are reluctant to link Nazerini and Nazarenes. Yet the term &quot;Nazerini&quot; can be possibly connected to words which include the Arabic triliteral root &quot;&quot; such as the subject &quot;naṣer&quot; in Eastern Aramaic, which means &quot;keeper of wellness&quot;.

== History ==
Ibn Nusayr and his followers are considered the founders of the religion. After the death of the Eleventh Imam, al-Askari, problems emerged in the Shia Community concerning his succession, and then Ibn Nusayr claimed to be the Bab and Ism of the deceased Imam and that he received his secret teachings. Ibn Nusayr and his followers&#x27; development seems to be one of many other early ghulat mystical Islamic sects, and were apparently excommunicated by the Shia representatives of the 12th Hidden Imam.

The Alawites were later organised during Hamdanid rule in northern Syria (947–1008) by a follower of Muhammad ibn Nusayr known as al-Khaṣībī, who died in Aleppo about 969, after a rivalry with the Ishaqiyya sect, which claimed also to have the doctrine of Ibn Nusayr. The embrace of Alawism by the majority of the population in the Syrian coastal mountains was likely a protracted process occurring over several centuries. Modern research indicates that after its initial establishment in Aleppo, Alawism spread to Sarmin, Salamiyah, Homs and Hama before becoming concentrated in low-lying villages west of Hama, including Baarin, Deir Shamil, and Deir Mama, the Wadi al-Uyun valley, and in the mountains around Tartus and Safita.

In 1032, al-Khaṣībī&#x27;s grandson and pupil, Abu Sa&#x27;id Maymun al-Tabarani (d. 1034), moved to Latakia (then controlled by the Byzantine Empire). Al-Tabarani succeeded his mentor al-Jilli of Aleppo as head missionary in Syria and became &quot;the last definitive scholar of Alawism&quot;, founding its calendar and giving Alawite teachings their final form, according to the historian Stefan Winter. Al-Tabarani influenced the Alawite faith through his writings and by converting the rural population of the Syrian Coastal Mountain Range. 

Winter argues that while it is likely the Alawite presence in Latakia dates to Tabarani&#x27;s lifetime, it is unclear if Alawite teachings spread to the city&#x27;s mountainous hinterland, where the Muslim population generally leaned toward Shia Islam, in the eleventh century. In the early part of the century, the Jabal al-Rawadif (part of the Syrian Coastal Mountains around Latakia) were controlled by the local Arab chieftain Nasr ibn Mushraf al-Rudafi, who vacillated between alliance and conflict with Byzantium. There is nothing in the literary sources indicating al-Rudafi patronized the Alawites. 

To the south of Jabal al-Rawadif, in the Jabal Bahra, a 13th-century Alawite treatise mentions the sect was sponsored by the Banu&#x27;l-Ahmar, Banu&#x27;l-Arid, and Banu Muhriz, three local families who controlled fortresses in the region in the 11th and 12th centuries. From this southern part of the Syrian coastal mountain range, a significant Alawite presence developed in the mountains east of Latakia and Jableh during the Mamluk period (1260s–1516).

According to Bar Hebraeus, many Alawites were killed when the Crusaders initially entered Syria in 1097; however, they tolerated them when they concluded they were not a truly Islamic sect. They even incorporated them within their ranks, along with the Maronites and Turcopoles. Two prominent Alawite leaders in the following centuries, credited with uplifting the group, were Shaykhs al-Makzun (d. 1240) and al-Tubani (d. 1300), both originally from Mount Sinjar in modern Iraq.

In the 14th century, the Alawites were forced by Mamluk Sultan Baibars to build mosques in their settlements, to which they responded with token gestures described by the Muslim traveller Ibn Battuta.

=== Ottoman Empire ===

During the reign of Sultan Selim I, of the Ottoman Empire, the Alawites would again experience significant persecution; especially in Aleppo when a massacre occurred in the Great Mosque of Aleppo on 24 April 1517. The massacre was known as the &quot;Massacre of the Telal&quot; () in which the corpses of thousands of victims accumulated as a tell located west of the castle. The horrors of the massacre which caused the immigration of the survivors to the coastal region are documented at the National and University Library in Strasbourg.

The Ottoman Empire took aggressive actions against Alawites, due to their alleged &quot;treacherous activities&quot; as &quot;they had a long history of betraying the Muslim governments due to their mistrust towards Sunnis.&quot; The Alawis rose up against the Ottomans on several occasions, and maintained their autonomy in their mountains.

In his book &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; T. E. Lawrence wrote:
During the 18th century, the Ottomans employed a number of Alawite leaders as tax collectors under the &quot;iltizam&quot; system. Between 1809 and 1813, Mustafa Agha Barbar, the governor of Tripoli, attacked the Kalbiyya Alawites with &quot;marked savagery.&quot; Some Alawites supported Ottoman involvement in the Egyptian-Ottoman Wars of 1831–1833 and 1839–1841, and had careers in the Ottoman army or as Ottoman governors. Moreover, they even initiated the Alawite revolt (1834–35) against the Egyptian rule of the region, which was later suppressed by the Governor of Homs.

By the mid-19th century, the Alawite people, customs and way of life were described by Samuel Lyde, an English missionary among them, as suffering from nothing except a gloomy plight. The 19th century historian Elias Saleh described the Alawites as living in a &quot;state of ignorance&quot; and having the negative traits of &quot;laziness, lying, deceitfulness, inclination to robbery and bloodshed, and backstabbing.&quot; By the 1870s, Alawite bandits were impaled on spikes and left on crossroads as a warning, according to the historian Joshua Landis.

Early in the 20th century, the mainly-Sunni Ottoman leaders were bankrupt and losing political power; the Alawites were poor peasants.

=== French Mandate period ===
After the end of World War I and the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Syria and Lebanon were placed by the League of Nations under the French Mandate for Syria and Lebanon. On 15 December 1918, Alawite leader Saleh al-Ali called for a meeting of Alawite leaders in the town of Al-Shaykh Badr, urging them to revolt and expel the French from Syria.

When French authorities heard about the meeting, they sent a force to arrest Saleh al-Ali. He and his men ambushed and defeated the French forces at Al-Shaykh Badr, inflicting more than 35 casualties. After this victory, al-Ali began organizing his Alawite rebels into a disciplined force, with its general command and military ranks.

The Al-Shaykh Badr skirmish began the Syrian Revolt of 1919. Al-Ali responded to French attacks by laying siege to (and occupying) al-Qadmus, from which the French had conducted their military operations against him. In November, General Henri Gouraud mounted a campaign against Saleh al-Ali&#x27;s forces in the Alawi Mountains. His forces entered al-Ali&#x27;s village of Al-Shaykh Badr, arresting many Alawi leaders; however, al-Ali fled to the north. When a large French force overran his position, he went underground.

Despite these instances of opposition, the Alawites mostly favored French rule and sought its continuation beyond the mandate period.

==== Alawite State ====

When the French began to occupy Syria in 1920, an Alawite State was created in the coastal and mountain country comprising most Alawite villages. The division also intended to protect the Alawite people from more powerful majorities, such as the Sunnis.

The French also created microstates, such as Greater Lebanon for the Maronite Christians and Jabal al-Druze for the Druze. Aleppo and Damascus were also separate states. Under the Mandate, many Alawite chieftains supported a separate Alawite nation, and tried to convert their autonomy into independence.

The French Mandate Administration encouraged Alawites to join their military forces, in part to provide a counterweight to the Sunni majority, which was more hostile to their rule. According to a 1935 letter by the French minister of war, the French considered the Alawites and the Druze the only &quot;warlike races&quot; in the Mandate territories. Between 1926 and 1939, the Alawites and other minority groups provided the majority of the locally recruited component of the Army of the Levant—the designation given to the French military forces garrisoning Syria and the Lebanon.

The region was home to a mostly-rural, heterogeneous population. The landowning families and 80 percent of the population of the port city of Latakia were Sunni Muslims; however, in rural areas 62 percent of the population were Alawite. According to some researchers, there was considerable Alawite separatist sentiment in the region, their evidence is a 1936 letter signed by 80 Alawi leaders addressed to the French Prime Minister which said that the &quot;Alawite people rejected attachment to Syria and wished to stay under French protection.&quot; Among the signatories was Sulayman Ali al-Assad, father of Hafez al-Assad. However, according to Associate Professor Stefan Winter, this letter is a forgery. Even during this time of increased Alawite rights, the situation was still so bad for the group that many women had to leave their homes to work for urban Sunnis.

In May 1930, the Alawite State was renamed the Government of Latakia in one of the few concessions by the French to Arab nationalists before 1936. Nevertheless, on 3 December 1936, the Alawite State was re-incorporated into Syria as a concession by the French to the National Bloc (the party in power in the semi-autonomous Syrian government). The law went into effect in 1937.

In 1939, the Sanjak of Alexandretta (now Hatay) contained a large number of Alawites. The Hatayan land was given to Turkey by the French after a League of Nations plebiscite in the province. This development greatly angered most Syrians; to add to Alawi contempt, in 1938, the Turkish military went into İskenderun and expelled most of the Arab and Armenian population. Before this, the Alawite Arabs and Armenians comprised most of the province&#x27;s population. Zaki al-Arsuzi, a young Alawite leader from Iskandarun province in the Sanjak of Alexandretta who led the resistance to the province&#x27;s annexation by the Turks, later became a co-founder of the Ba&#x27;ath Party with Eastern Orthodox Christian schoolteacher Michel Aflaq and Sunni politician Salah ad-Din al-Bitar.

After World War II, Sulayman al-Murshid played a major role in uniting the Alawite province with Syria. He was executed by the Syrian government in Damascus on 12 December 1946, only three days after a political trial.

=== After Syrian independence ===

Syria became independent on 17 April 1946. In 1949, after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Syria experienced a number of military coups and the rise of the Ba&#x27;ath Party.

In 1958, Syria and Egypt were united by a political agreement into the United Arab Republic. The UAR lasted for three years, breaking apart in 1961, when a group of army officers seized power and declared Syria independent.

A succession of coups ensued until, in 1963, a secretive military committee (including Alawite officers Hafez al-Assad and Salah Jadid) helped the Ba&#x27;ath Party seize power. In 1966, Alawite-affiliated military officers successfully rebelled and expelled the Ba’ath Party old guard followers of Greek Orthodox Christian Michel Aflaq and Sunni Muslim Salah ad-Din al-Bitar, calling Zaki al-Arsuzi the &quot;Socrates&quot; of the reconstituted Ba&#x27;ath Party.

In 1970, Air Force General Hafez al-Assad, an Alawite, took power and instigated a &quot;Corrective Movement&quot; in the Ba&#x27;ath Party, overthrowing Salah Jadid (another Alawite). The coup ended the political instability which had existed since independence. Alawites were among Syria&#x27;s poorest and most marginalized groups until Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s seizure of power. Robert D. Kaplan compared his rise to &quot;an untouchable becoming maharajah in India or a Jew becoming tsar in Russia—an unprecedented development shocking to the Sunni majority population which had monopolized power for so many centuries.&quot; 

Under Hafez al-Assad and his son Bashar al-Assad, who succeeded his father upon his death in June 2000, Alawites made up the majority of Syria&#x27;s military and political elites, including in the intelligence services and the &quot;shabiha&quot; (loyalist paramilitaries). The economic and social situation of Alawites improved, but the community remained relatively poor compared to other Syrians, and the Sunni-Alawite divisions persisted.

In 1971, al-Assad declared himself president of Syria, a position the constitution at the time permitted only for Sunni Muslims. In 1973, a new constitution was adopted, replacing Islam as the state religion with a mandate that the president&#x27;s religion be Islam, and protests erupted. In 1974, to satisfy this constitutional requirement, Musa as-Sadr (a leader of the Twelvers of Lebanon and founder of the Amal Movement, who had unsuccessfully sought to unite Lebanese Alawites and Shiites under the Supreme Islamic Shiite Council) issued a fatwa that Alawites were a community of Twelver Shiite Muslims.

A significant majority of Sunni Syrians accepted Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s rule, but the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria, an Islamist group, did not. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Muslim Brotherhood pushed anti-Alawite propaganda and a violent anti-Ba&#x27;athist campaign in Syria. Thirty-two cadets, mostly Alawites, were killed in the June 1979 Aleppo Artillery School massacre. In response to the Brothehood&#x27;s attempted assassination of Hafez al-Assad in 1980, the regime ordered a violent crackdown; Hafez&#x27;s brother Rifaat al-Assad ordered the slaughter of hundreds of Brotherhood members at the Tadmor Prison in Palmyra. 

The Brotherhood responded with increased violence, culminating in an attempt to seize control of the city of Hama in February 1982. The regime deployed between 6,000 and 8,000 troops to surpress the insurgency, and in the Hama massacre, up to 25,000 people were killed over 27 days. Seeking to ensure that troops would not turn against the government, the Assad regime was careful to ensure the dominance of Alawites in the units deployed to Hama: Rifaat al-Assad&#x27;s Defense Companies were reported to be 90% Alwaite, and in other units, up to 70% of officers corps were Alawites. After 1982, Syria remained relatively stable until the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011, but the events in Hama left enduring Sunni-Alawite sectarian resentments.

=== Syrian civil war ===

After the Syrian civil war broke out in 2011, the Ba&#x27;athist state conscripted able-bodied men, mostly youth, into the regime&#x27;s military. Fearing mass defections in military ranks, the Assad regime preferred to send Alawite recruits for active combat on the frontlines, and conscriptions disproportionately targeted Alawite regions. This has resulted in a large number of &#x27;Alawite casualties and immense suffering to Alawite villages along the Syrian coast. Many younger Alawites were greatly angered by the Assad government, held the government responsible for the crisis, and increasingly called for an end the conflict via reconciliation with the Syrian opposition and preventing their community from being perceived as being associated with the Assad government. 

In the early days of the Syrian civil war, many Alawites felt compelled to back Assad, fearing that a rebel victory would lead to a slaughter of the Alawite community, especially as the conflict took on an increasingly sectarian cast. In May 2013, pro-opposition SOHR stated that out of 94,000 Syrian regime soldiers killed during the war, at least 41,000 were Alawites. Reports estimate that up to a third of 250,000 young Alawite men of fighting age has been killed in the war by 2015, due to being disproportionately sent to fight in the frontlines by the Assad government. In April 2017, a pro-opposition source claimed 150,000 young Alawites had died. Another report estimates that around 100,000 Alawite youths were killed in combat by 2020.

Many Alawites feared significant danger during the Syrian civil war, particularly from Islamic groups who were a part of the opposition, though denied by secular opposition factions. Alawites have also been wary of the increased Iranian influence in Syria since the Syrian civil war, viewing it as a threat to their long-term survival due to Khomeinist conversion campaigns focused in Alawite coastal regions. Many Alawites, including Assad loyalists, criticize such activities as a plot to absorb their ethno-religious identity into Iran&#x27;s Twelver Shia umbrella and spread religious extremism in Syria.

While many Alawites were Assad loyalists throughout the civil war, the Baathist regime faced increasing discontent in the war&#x27;s later years from Alawite-dominated areas. By 2023, some Alawites had criticized the regime for its corruption, economic mismanagement, and disregard for civil liberties. During a rapid offense in November and December 2024 by opposition forces fighting the Assad regime, thousands of Alawites fled the city of Homs ahead of the capture of the city; those who left headed to coastal Tartus Governorate. Upon the fall of Damascus and collapse of the Assad regime days later, Alawite communities continued to express uncertainty about their future, although fears receded somewhat because the opposition forces did not target Alawites after capturing Homs.

==== Alleged attempt to establish an Alawite state ====

According to the UK-based war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad sought to establish an Alawite state on the Syrian coast as a fallback plan. This proposed coastal statelet was reportedly intended to serve as a stronghold for his regime in the event of losing control over the rest of the country.

Russia, a key ally of Assad, allegedly rejected this plan, viewing it as an attempt to divide Syria. The SOHR claimed that Assad subsequently fled to Russia on his plane after facing opposition to the proposal and refused to deliver a speech about stepping down from power. There were also reports claiming that Assad had been relying heavily on Iran&#x27;s support to maintain his position.

=== Post-Assad Syria ===

On 25 December 2024, thousands of people protested across Syria in various regions including Latakia, Tartus, Jableh and Homs after a video surfaced showing an attack on the Alawite shrine of Al-Khasibi in Aleppo&#x27;s Maysaloon district following the rebel offensive and the fall of the regime of Bashar al-Assad. During the shrine attack at least five people were killed and the shrine was set ablaze. The UK-based SOHR reported significant demonstrations, including in Qardaha, President Assad&#x27;s hometown.

The transitional authorities, appointed by Hay&#x27;at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) which led the offensive that toppled Assad, said in a statement that the shrine attack was from earlier December, attributing its resurfacing to &quot;unknown groups&quot; aiming to incite unrest. This incident followed protests in Damascus against the burning of a Christmas tree, highlighting ongoing sectarian tensions in Syria. Demonstrators chanting slogans including “Alawite, Sunni, we want peace” and placards with &quot;No to burning holy places and religious discrimination, no to sectarianism, yes to a free Syria&quot;.

There have also been hundreds of reports across Syria of civilians belonging to the Alawite sect and other religious minorities being murdered and persecuted by HTS forces following the collapse of the Assad regime. Most notably, a massacre of Alawites was reported in the village of Fahil near Homs by HTS-affiliated gunmen. The UK-based formerly pro-opposition monitor SOHR confirmed the deaths of at least 16 people.

== Beliefs ==
Alawites and their beliefs have been described as &quot;secretive&quot;. Yaron Friedman, for example, in his scholarly work on the sect, has written that the Alawi religious material quoted in his book came only from &quot;public libraries and printed books&quot; since the &quot;sacred writings&quot; of the Alawi &quot;are kept secret&quot;.) Some tenets of the faith are kept secret from most Alawi and known only to a select few. They have therefore been described as a mystical sect. 

Alawite doctrines originated from the teachings of Iraqi priest Muhammad ibn Nusayr who claimed Prophethood and declared himself as the &quot;&quot;Bāb&quot; (door) of the Imams&quot; and attributed divinity to Hasan al-Askari. Al-Askari denounced Ibn Nusayr, and Islamic authorities expelled his disciples, most of whom emigrated to the Coastal Mountains of Syria wherein they established a distinct community. Nusayri creed views Ali, companion of the Prophet Muhammad, as &quot;the supreme eternal God&quot; and consists of various gnostic beliefs. Alawite doctrine regards the souls of Alawites as re-incarnations of &quot;lights that rebelled against God.&quot;

Alawite beliefs have never been confirmed by their modern religious authorities. As a highly secretive and esoteric sect, Nusayri priests tend to conceal their core doctrines, which are introduced only to a chosen minority of the sect&#x27;s adherents. Alawites have also adopted the practice of &quot;taqiya&quot; to avoid victimization. 

=== Theology and practices ===
Alawite doctrine incorporates elements of Phoenician mythology, Gnosticism, neo-Platonism, Christian Trinitarianism (for example, they celebrate Mass including the consecration of bread and wine); blending them with Muslim symbolism and has, therefore, been described as syncretic.

Alawite Trinity envisions God as being composed of three distinct manifestations, &quot;Ma&#x27;na&quot; (meaning), &quot;Ism&quot; (Name), and &quot;Bab&quot; (Door), which together constitute an &quot;indivisible Trinity&quot;. &quot;Ma&#x27;na&quot; symbolises the &quot;source and meaning of all things&quot; in Alawite mythology. According to Alawite doctrines, &quot;Ma&#x27;na&quot; generated the &quot;Ism&quot;, which in turn built the &quot;Bab&quot;. These beliefs are closely tied to the Nusayri doctrine of re-incarnations of the Trinity.

&quot;The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World&quot; classifies Alawites as part of extremist Shia sects referred to as the &quot;ghulat&quot; which are unrelated to Sunni Islam; owing to the secretive nature of the Alawite religious system and hierarchy. Due to their esoteric doctrines of strict secrecy, conversions into the community were also forbidden. 

Alawites do not believe in daily Muslim prayers (&quot;salah&quot;). The central tenet of the Alawite is their belief of Ali ibn Abi Talib being an incarnation of God. The Alawite testimony of faith is translated as &quot;There is no God but Ali.&quot;

==== Reincarnation ====
Alawites hold that they were originally stars or divine lights that were cast out of heaven through disobedience and must undergo repeated reincarnation (or metempsychosis) before returning to heaven. According to Alawite beliefs, females are excluded from re-incarnation. 

Alawite theologians divided history into seven eras, associating each era with one of the seven re-incarnations of the Alawite Trinity (&quot;Ma&#x27;na&quot;, &quot;Ism&quot;, &quot;Bab&quot;). The seven re-incarnations of the Trinity in the Alawite faith consists of: 
* Abel, Adam, Gabriel 
* Seth, Noah, Yail ibn Fatin
* Joseph, Jacob, Ham ibn Kush
* Joshua, Moses, Dan ibn Usbaut
* Asaf, Solomon, Abd Allah ibn Siman
* Simon Peter, Jesus, Rawzaba ibn al-Marzuban
* Ali, Muhammad, Salman al-Farisi

The last triad of reincarnations in the Nusayri Trinity consists of Ali (&quot;Ma&#x27;na&quot;), Muhammad (&quot;Ism&quot;), and Salman al-Farsi (&quot;Bab&quot;). Alawites depict them as the sky, the sun, and the moon, respectively. They deify Ali as the &quot;last and supreme manifestation of God&quot; who built the universe, attributing him with divine superiority and believing that Ali created Muhammad, bestowing upon him the mission to spread Qur&#x27;anic teachings on earth.

The Israeli institution of Begin–Sadat Center for Strategic Studies describes the Alawite faith as Judeophilic and &quot;anti-Sunni&quot; since they believe that God&#x27;s incarnations consist of Israelite Prophet Joshua who conquered Canaan, in addition to the fourth Caliph, Ali. This institution also denies the Arab ethnicity of Alawites even though Alawites themselves self-identify ethnically as Arabs and assert that Alawites claim to be Arabs because of a supposed &quot;political expediency.&quot;

==== Other beliefs ====
Other beliefs and practices include: the consecration of wine in a secret form of Mass performed only by males; frequently being given Christian names; entombing the dead in sarcophagi above ground; observing Epiphany, Christmas and the feast days of John Chrysostom and Mary Magdalene; the only religious structures they have are the shrines of tombs; the book &quot;Kitab al-Majmu&quot;, which is allegedly a central source of Alawite doctrine, where they have their own trinity, comprising Mohammed, Ali, and Salman the Persian.

In addition, they celebrate different holidays such as Old New Year, Akitu, Eid al-Ghadir, Mid-Sha&#x27;ban and Eid il-Burbara. They also believe in intercession of certain legendary saints such as Khidr (Saint George) and Simeon Stylites.

==== Development ====

Yaron Friedman and many researchers of Alawi doctrine write that the founder of the religion, Ibn Nusayr, did not necessarily believe he was representative of a splinter, rebel group of the Shias, but believed he held the true doctrine of the Shias and most of the aspects that are similar to Christianity are considered more a coincidence and not a direct influence from it, as well as other external doctrines that were popular among Shia esoteric groups in Basra in the 8th century. According to Friedman and other scholars, the Alawi movement started as many other mystical ghulat sects with an explicit concentration on an allegorical and esoteric meaning of the Quran and other mystical practices, and not as a pure syncretic sect, though later, they embraced some other practices, as they believed all religions had the same &quot;Batin&quot; core.

Journalist Robert F. Worth argues that the idea that the Alawi religion as a branch of Islam is a rewriting of history made necessary by the French colonialists&#x27; abandonment of the Alawi and departure from Syria. Worth describes the &quot;first ... authentic source for outsiders about the religion&quot;, written by Soleyman of Adana – a 19th-century Alawi convert to Christianity who broke his oath of secrecy on the religion, explaining that the Alawi, according to Soleyman, deified Ali, venerated Christ, Muhammad, Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle, and held themselves apart from Muslims and Christians, whom they considered heretics. According to Tom Heneghan:
According to a disputed letter, in 1936, six Alawi notables petitioned the French colonialists not to merge their Alawi enclave with the rest of Syria, insisting that &quot;the spirit of hatred and fanaticism embedded in the hearts of the Arab Muslims against everything that is non-Muslim has been perpetually nurtured by the Islamic religion.&quot; However, according to associate professor Stefan Winter, this letter is a forgery. According to Worth, later &quot;fatwas&quot; declaring Alawi to be part of the Shia community were by Shia clerics &quot;eager for Syrian patronage&quot; from Syria&#x27;s Alawi president Hafez al-Assad, who was eager for Islamic legitimacy in the face of the hostility of Syria&#x27;s Muslim majority.

Yaron Friedman does not suggest that Alawi did not consider themselves Muslims but does state that:
According to Peter Theo Curtis, the Alawi religion underwent a process of &quot;Sunnification&quot; during the years under Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s rule so that Alawites became not Shia but effectively Sunni. Public manifestation or &quot;even mentioning of any Alawite religious activities&quot; was banned, as were any Alawite religious organizations, &quot;any formation of a unified religious council&quot; or a higher Alawite religious authority. &quot;Sunni-style&quot; mosques were built in every Alawite village, and Alawis were encouraged to perform Hajj. It&#x27;s also worth noting that the grand mosque in Qardaha, the hometown of the Assad family, being dedicated to Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq who is venerated by Sunnis but not Shi&#x27;ites.

== Opinions on position within Islam ==
The Sunni Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, issued a &quot;fatwa&quot; recognizing them as part of the Muslim community in the interest of Arab nationalism. However, classical Sunni scholars such as the Syrian historian Ibn Kathir categorized Alawites as non-Muslim and mushrikeen (polytheists), in their writings. Ibn Taymiyya, Ibn Kathir&#x27;s mentor and arguably the most polemical anti-Alawite Sunni theologian, categorised Alawite as non-Muslims and listed them amongst the worst sects of polytheists.
Through many of his &quot;fatawa&quot;, Ibn Taymiyya described Alawites as &quot;the worst enemies of the Muslims&quot; who were far more dangerous than Crusaders and Mongols. Ibn Taymiyya also accused Alawites of aiding the Crusades and Mongol invasions against the Muslim World. Other Sunni scholars, such as Al-Ghazali, likewise considered them as non-Muslims. Benjamin Disraeli, in his novel &quot;Tancred&quot;, also expressed the view that Alawites are not Shia Muslims.

Historically, Twelver Shia scholars (such as Shaykh Tusi) did not consider Alawites as Shia Muslims while condemning their heretical beliefs.

In 2016, according to several international media reports, an unspecified number of Alawite community leaders released a &quot;Declaration of an Alawite Identity Reform&quot; (of the Alawite community). The manifesto presents Alawism as a current &quot;within Islam&quot; and rejects attempts to incorporate the Alawite community into Twelver Shiism. The document was interpreted as an attempt by representatives of the Alawite community to overcome the sectarian polarisation and to distance themselves from the growing Sunni–Shia divide in the Middle East.

According to Matti Moosa,
The Christian elements in the Nusayri religion are unmistakable. They include the concept of trinity; the celebration of Christmas, the consecration of the Qurbana, that is, the sacrament of the flesh and blood which Christ offered to his disciples, and, most importantly, the celebration of the Quddas (a lengthy prayer proclaiming the divine attributes of Ali and the personification of all the biblical patriarchs from Adam to Simon Peter, founder of the Church, who is seen, paradoxically, as the embodiment of true Islam).

Barry Rubin has suggested that Syrian leader Hafez al-Assad and his son and successor Bashar al-Assad pressed their fellow Alawites &quot;to behave like &#x27;regular Muslims&#x27;, shedding (or at least concealing) their distinctive aspects&quot;. During the early 1970s, a booklet, &quot;al-&#x27;Alawiyyun Shi&#x27;atu Ahl al-Bait&quot; (&quot;The Alawites are Followers of the Household of the Prophet&quot;) was published, which was &quot;signed by numerous &#x27;Alawi&#x27; men of religion&quot;, described the doctrines of the Imami Shia as Alawite.

The relationship between Alawite-ruled Ba&#x27;athist Syria and Khomeinist Iran has been described as a &quot;marriage of convenience&quot; due to the former being ruled by the ultra-secularist Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath party and the latter by the anti-secular Twelver Shi&#x27;ite clergy. The alliance was established during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, when Hafez al-Assad backed Iran against his Iraqi Ba&#x27;athist rivals, departing from the consensus of the rest of the Arab world. Iranian-backed militant groups like Hezbollah, Fatemeyoun, etc., have been acting as proxy forces for the Assad regime in various conflicts in the region, such as the Lebanese Civil War, the 2006 Lebanon War and the Syrian civil war. 
Some sources have discussed the &quot;Sunnification&quot; of Alawites under the al-Assad regime. Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies, writes that Hafiz al-Assad &quot;tried to turn Alawites into &#x27;good&#x27; (read Sunnified) Muslims in exchange for preserving a modicum of secularism and tolerance in society&quot;. On the other hand, Al-Assad &quot;declared the Alawites to be nothing but Twelver Shiites&quot;. In a paper, &quot;Islamic Education in Syria&quot;, Landis wrote that &quot;no mention&quot; is made in Syrian textbooks (controlled by the Al-Assad regime) of Alawites, Druze, Ismailis or Shia Islam; Islam was presented as a monolithic religion.

Ali Sulayman al-Ahmad, chief judge of the Baathist Syrian state, has said:
== Population ==
=== Syria ===
Alawites have traditionally lived in the Coastal Mountain Range, along the Mediterranean coast of western Syria. Latakia and Tartus are the region&#x27;s principal cities. They are also concentrated in the plains around Hama and Homs. Alawites also live in Syria&#x27;s major cities. They make up about 11% of the country&#x27;s population.

There are four Alawite confederations—Kalbiyya, Khaiyatin, Haddadin, and Matawirah—each divided into tribes based on their geographical origins or their main religious leader, such as Ḥaidarīya of Alī Ḥaidar, and Kalāziyya of Sheikh Muḥammad ibn Yūnus from the village Kalāzū near Antakya. Those Alawites are concentrated in the Latakia region of Syria, extending north to Antioch (Antakya), Turkey, and in and around Homs and Hama.

Before 1953, Alawites held specifically reserved seats in the Syrian Parliament, in common with all other religious communities. After that (including the 1960 census), there were only general Muslim and Christian categories, without mention of subgroups, to reduce sectarianism (&quot;taifiyya&quot;).

==== Golan Heights ====
Before the 1967 war, Alawites in the Golan Heights lived mainly in three northern villages, &#x27;Ayn Fit, Za&#x27;ura and Ghajar. There are about 3,900 Alawites living in the village of Ghajar, which is located on the border between Lebanon and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. In 1932, the residents of Ghajar were given the option of choosing their nationality, and overwhelmingly chose to be a part of Syria, which has a sizable Alawite minority. Before the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, the residents of Ghajar were counted in the 1960 Syrian census. According to Joshua Project, after Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria, and after implementing Israeli civil law in 1981, the Alawite community chose to become Israeli citizens. However, according to Al-Marsad, Alawites were forced to undergo a process of naturalisation.

=== Turkey ===
To avoid confusion with the ethnic Turkish and Kurdish Alevis, the Alawites call themselves &quot;Arap Alevileri&quot; (&quot;Arab Alevis&quot;) in Turkish. The term &quot;Nusayrī&quot;, previously used in theological texts, has been revived in recent studies. A quasi-official name used during the 1930s by Turkish authorities was &quot;Eti Türkleri&quot; (&quot;Hittite Turks&quot;), to conceal their Arabic origins. Although this term is obsolete, it is still used by some older people as a euphemism.

In 1939, the Alawites accounted for some 40 percent of the population of the province of Iskenderun. According to French geographer Fabrice Balanche, relations between the Alawites of Turkey and the Alawites of Syria are limited. Community ties were broken by the Turkification policy and the decades-long closure of the Syria-Turkey border.

The exact number of Alawites in Turkey is unknown; there were 185,000 in 1970. As Muslims, they are not recorded separately from Sunnis. In the 1965 census (the last Turkish census where informants were asked about their mother tongue), 185,000 people in the three provinces declared their mother tongue as Arabic; however, Arabic-speaking Sunnis and Christians were also included in this figure. Turkish Alawites traditionally speak the same dialect of Levantine Arabic as Syrian Alawites. Arabic is preserved in rural communities and in Samandağ. Younger people in the cities of Çukurova and İskenderun tend to speak Turkish. The Turkish spoken by Alawites is distinguished by its accents and vocabulary. Knowledge of the Arabic alphabet is confined to religious leaders and men who have worked or studied in Arab countries.

Alawites demonstrate considerable social mobility. Until the 1960s, they were bound to Sunni &quot;aghas&quot; (landholders) around Antakya and were poor. Alawites are prominent in the sectors of transportation and commerce and a large, professional middle class has emerged. Male exogamy has increased, particularly among those who attend universities or live in other parts of Turkey. These marriages are tolerated; however, female exogamy (as in other patrilineal groups) is discouraged.

Alawites, like Alevis, have strong leftist political beliefs. However, some people in rural areas (usually members of notable Alawite families) may support secular, conservative parties such as the Democrat Party. Most Alawites feel oppressed by the policies of the Presidency of Religious Affairs in Turkey (&quot;Diyanet İşleri Başkanlığı&quot;).

There are religious festivals celebrated by Alawites in Turkey that have origins in the pre-Islamic periods, such as the Evvel Temmuz Festival.

=== Lebanon ===

In 2011, there were an estimated 150,000 Alawites in Lebanon, where they have lived since at least the 16th century. They are one of the 18 official Lebanese sects; due to the efforts of their leader, Ali Eid, the Taif Agreement of 1989 gave them two reserved seats in Parliament. Lebanese Alawites live primarily in the Jabal Mohsen neighbourhood of Tripoli and in 10 villages in the Akkar District, and are represented by the Arab Democratic Party. Their Mufti is Sheikh Assad Assi. The Bab al-Tabbaneh–Jabal Mohsen conflict between pro-Syrian Alawites and anti-Syrian Sunnis has affected Tripoli for decades.

== Language ==
Alawites in Syria speak a special dialect (part of Levantine Arabic) famous for the usage of letter (qāf), but this feature is also shared with neighboring non-Alawite villages, such as Idlib. Due to foreign occupation of Syria, the same dialect is characterized by multiple borrowings, mainly from Turkish and then French, especially terms used for imported inventions such as television, radio, elevator (ascenseur), etc.

<text>Bolas or bolases (: bola; from Spanish and Portuguese &quot;bola&quot;, &quot;ball&quot;, also known as a &quot;boleadora&quot; or &quot;boleadeira&quot;) is a type of throwing weapon made of weights on the ends of interconnected cords, used to capture animals by entangling their legs. Bolas were most famously used by the gauchos, but have been found in excavations of Pre-Columbian settlements, especially in Patagonia, where indigenous peoples (particularly the Tehuelche) used them to catch 200-pound guanacos and rheas. The Mapuche and the Inca army used them in battle. Mapuche warriors used bolas in their confrontations with the Chilean Army during the Occupation of Araucanía (1861–1883).

== Use ==
&quot;Gauchos&quot; used &quot;boleadoras&quot; to capture running cattle or game. Depending on the exact design, the thrower grasps the &quot;boleadora&quot; by one of the weights or by the nexus of the cords. The thrower gives the balls momentum by swinging them and then releases the &quot;boleadora&quot;. The weapon is usually used to entangle the animal&#x27;s legs, but when thrown with enough force might even inflict damage (e.g. breaking a bone).

Traditionally, Inuit have used bolas to hunt birds, fouling the birds in air with the lines of the bola. &quot;People of a Feather&quot; showed Belcher Island Inuit using bolas to hunt eider ducks on the wing.

== Design ==
There is no uniform design; most &quot;bolas&quot; have two or three balls, but there are versions of up to eight or nine. Some &quot;bolas&quot; have balls of equal weight; others vary the knot and cord. &quot;Gauchos&quot; use &quot;bolas&quot; made of braided leather cords with wooden balls or small leather sacks full of stones at the ends of the cords.

&quot;Bolas&quot; can be named depending on the number of weights used:

* &quot;Perdida&quot; (one weight)
* &quot;Avestrucera&quot; or &quot;ñanducera&quot; (two weights, for rheas)
* &quot;Somai&quot; (two weights)
* &quot;Achico&quot; (three weights)
* &quot;Boleadora&quot; (three weights)
* &quot;Kiipooyaq&quot; (Inuit name for &quot;bolas&quot; with three or more weights)

&quot;Bolas&quot; of three weights are usually designed with two shorter cords with heavier weights, and one longer cord with a light weight. The heavier weights fly at the front parallel to each other, hit either side of the legs, and the lighter weight goes around, wrapping up the legs.

Other unrelated versions include &quot;qilumitautit&quot;, the &quot;bolas&quot; of the Inuit, made of sinew and bone weights and used to capture water birds.

== Popular culture ==

==Lyrics==
Common modern versions include:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;Peter, Peter pumpkin eater,
Had a wife but couldn&#x27;t keep her;
He put her in a pumpkin shell
And there he kept her very well.

Peter, Peter pumpkin eater,
Had another and didn&#x27;t leave her;
Peter learned to read and spell,
And then he loved her very well.&lt;/poem&gt;

And lat a&#x27; the mice eat her.
