<text>The National Geographic GeoBee (called the National Geographic Bee from 2001 to 2018, also referred to as the Nat Geo Bee) was an annual geography contest sponsored by the National Geographic Society. The bee, held annually from 1989 to 2019, was open to students in the fourth through eighth grades in participating schools from the United States.

The entities represented at the national level came from all fifty U.S. states, all the territories, the Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS), and the District of Columbia.

The National Geographic Bee Finals were moderated by &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; host Alex Trebek for its first 25 years (1989–2013). At the 2013 National Geographic Bee, Trebek announced that 2013 would be his last year hosting the Finals. Newscaster Soledad O&#x27;Brien took his place the following year, moderating the bee in 2014 and 2015. O&#x27;Brien was then replaced by Mo Rocca, who would host from 2016 to the final competition in 2019.

In 2020, the Bee was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 edition was also canceled after a 75 percent drop in school registrations. The National Geographic Society later announced that the Bee had been &quot;permanently discontinue[d]... to make way for new, transformative, and innovative geography education opportunities in which students around the globe can more equitably participate.&quot;

==Procedure==

===School competitions===
The competition began at the elementary school and middle school levels (4th grade - 8th grade) and usually occurred in November, December, or January. This competition required at least 6 people to enter. Private schools, public schools, and homeschooled students were allowed to enter. Typically, between five and six million students entered each year (any number of competitors could enter this competition). The two major stages in this competition were called the preliminary and the final stages. Often, the preliminary competition was further split into preliminary rounds and a semi-final. In the event of a tie, a tiebreaker round was held at the end of the preliminary rounds.

In the preliminary rounds, competitors were divided into groups of twenty and each contestant is asked one question from each of the seven themed rounds. Categories included:
*Cultural Geography
*Economic Geography
*Across-the-Country, Around-the-World
*Science
* Geographic Comparisons
*Physical Geography
* Odd-Item-Out (a category where one contestant was given three choices, plus a description; the contestant had to determine which of the three choices does not fit)
Contestants were awarded 1 point per question. At the end of seven rounds, players with the top ten scores advance to the finals. In addition to the game, a player could ask for a repeat of a spelling during these rounds. However, they were restricted to only asking twice in duration of the entire geographic bee.

Quite often there was a tie, in which case a semi-final tiebreaker round was needed. For example, if six players finished the preliminary rounds with eight points and fifteen finished with seven points, the six who finished with eight points automatically advanced to the final competition. The fifteen with seven points moved into the semi-final round where the top four were determined to fill the remainder of the seats in the finals. This was done by asking every player the same question at the same time and giving each player twelve seconds to write down the answer. Each question was automatically repeated twice. Everyone revealed their answer at the end of the twelve seconds and players were eliminated on a single-elimination basis. If, using the above example of four open seats in the finals, there was a question where eight players are left in the semi-final round and three players got the question right, those three advance to the finals. The other five who got the question wrong continued with the single-elimination procedure to determine which competitor would take the last open seat in the finals. A player could not ask judges to spell or repeat words in the semi-final round.

The final competition consisted of two parts: the final round and the championship round. Each of the ten finalists started with a clean slate and was eliminated after the second incorrect answer. This continued until the number of contestants drops from ten to two and a third-place finisher was determined. A player was not officially eliminated until the end of a series of questions, since if all but one competitor made their second miss in that round, all the players stayed in the competition. Again, a player could ask for a spelling or repeat on any question, but only once per question. Earlier in the round, questions could require oral answers or written answers from all the competitors at one time. Quite often, many of the earlier questions in this round contained visuals as part of the question, such as maps or pictures. Question examples included pictures of state quarters with the name rubbed off and maps of the US with national forests shown and numbered. Contestants, at the time, were given the name of the national forest and had to match states with trees. At the national level, competitions could include items such as flags, musical instruments, hats, and even live animals. After a certain round, all questions required oral answers only.

If there was a tie for the championship round or third place, there would be an elimination round. For example, if four players are left and three made their second mistake, the fourth advances to the championship round and the other three enter the tiebreaker. The moderator then asked each of the three players, at the same time, to write their answers to the same question. In this special round, questions could be repeated by players but they could not ask how to spell a given word. As a result, if one of three responses was correct, the player would rise to the championship round and the other two moved to the tiebreaker round until a third-place winner determined.

In the championship round, both players started with a clean slate again. The moderator asked both contestants the same question at the same time, repeated twice, and both players had fifteen seconds to write their answer. Both players then showed their answers and each player who wrote a correct answer received one point. There were three questions in the championship round. The player with the most points at the end was the champion. If both players were tied at the end, the competition entered the championship tiebreaker round. The rules were the same as for the championship round, except that the last player to answer a question incorrectly was the runner-up.

In 2010, National Geographic partnered with mobile development company Concentric Sky to launch a series of official app-based study tools titled Geobee Challenge.

Qualifying Test 

The Qualifying Test was the only part of the bee that is entirely written. Every school champion took this test in order to qualify for the state bee. The test comprised 70 multiple choice questions, to be completed in 60 minutes. The top 100 scorers in each state or territory advanced to the state level competition. Beginning with the 2016 Bee, the Qualifying test was administered online rather than on paper.

===State and national competitions===
The winner of each school-level competition takes an online test, and the top 100 in each state or territory qualify for the State Bee. If there is a tie in the State Qualifying Test, all students in the tie get an invitation to the State Bee (i.e. there were 107 State Bee Qualifiers in the 2019 Michigan State Geographic Bee). The rules at the state level are same as that at the school level, except that there are eight preliminary rounds instead of seven and each player is limited to two repeats or spelling for all eight preliminary rounds. Players are also limited to two repeats or spellings in the final round if they qualify. All the state bees are held on the same date, at the same time (in early April or late March) at all locations. State bees originally occurred for the fifty states, five U.S. territories (Guam, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands), Washington, D.C., and the Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS), for a total of 57. In 1999, the state competitions for Guam, American Samoa, and Northern Mariana Islands were merged into one state competition known as the Pacific Territories, bringing the number down to 55. In 2009, the Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands competitions were merged into a single competition known as the Atlantic Territories, and since then there have only been 54 state and territory competitions. For completions that involve students spread out across wide areas, such as the competitions like the DoDDS and Pacific Territories competitions, there is no in person competition such as in other states. Instead, after winning the school bee, school champions from around these territories take a series of online tests to determine the territory champion. The third-place finisher from each state receives $100, the second-place finisher $300, and the winner $1000. The 54 state champions receive an all-expense-paid trip to Washington, D.C., for the national competition.

The rules at the national level are the same as those at the state, except that there are ten preliminary rounds instead of eight. There was previously a video part of the preliminary competition where students submitted a video worth six points, but was replaced by a written &quot;GeoChallenge&quot; worth ten points. The championship round can also consist of five questions instead of three. The competition is held over four days, with the preliminary rounds on the first day and the final rounds on the third. The national finals are held in late May at National Geographic Society headquarters in Washington, D.C. and are hosted by Mo Rocca. The ten finalists are guaranteed $1000. The third-place finisher receives a $5,000 college scholarship, the second-place finisher receives a $10,000 college scholarship, and the National Champion receives a $25,000 college scholarship, as well as a lifetime membership in the National Geographic Society. From 2009 to 2015, the National Champion also won a trip to the Galápagos Islands. In 2016, this changed when National Champion Rishi Nair won a trip to southeast Alaska instead, including a stop at Glacier Bay National Park. This was because 2016 was the centenary of the U.S. National Park Service. But from 2017 onwards, this was reverted back to the Galápagos Islands which the National Champion Pranay Varada received. The National Competition final round format is also different from the state. Originally, it was the same format, but in 2012, National Geographic changed the format so that answers were displayed on a blue screen, correct answers were worth points, and competitors could earn extra points with bonus questions, with eliminations being every few rounds. In 2015, the logo of the National Geographic Bee was updated, and they changed the format once again. Instead of ten blue answer screens for the final round, now there are alternating blue and green screens. There are no longer bonus questions, and the first five rounds are USA based and worth one point for most questions. The fifth round is a “lightning round” where you are asked three rapid fire questions. Then, four students with the lowest scores are eliminated, a tie being broken with a tiebreaker about estimation. The next four rounds are global and are all worth two points per question, and end again with another lightning round. After this, the top three are left. There are two &quot;GeoChallenges&quot; in the final competition, one worth three points in round 3, and for the top ten a 45-second oral response worth six points. The top two then compete in a normal championship round. In 2019, however, due to the introduction of a new competition that is called the GeoChallenge (which is about developing a collaborative team project to tackle a given issue) they once again changed the format of the Bee. The semifinals, which consists of the top 10 contestants, is held on one day. There are eight rounds of oral and written questions, and the four lowest scores are eliminated after these eight rounds. Afterwards, there is a GeoChallenge worth ten points, and three contestants are eliminated to narrow the competition down to the final three. The next day, the top three contestants compete in the finals. They have a series of five oral rounds, and then they have a GeoChallenge round and a mapmaker round. Afterwards, the lowest scoring contestant is eliminated, and a normal championship round occurs to determine the champion.

===List of moderators===
===International competition===

There was an international competition, which was also moderated by the late Alex Trebek, but it was run differently. The top finishers from each country&#x27;s national competition formed a team representing their country and participated in an Olympic-style event which included a team written competition and a team oral competition. The 2013 competition was held in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The 2015 National Geographic World Championship, originally planned to take place in Stockholm, Sweden, was canceled, and the competition since has been put on hiatus.

===Criticism===
Some argue that the selection process of the National Geographic GeoBee competition is not well designed to reliably promote the most qualified contestants, as it leaves significant room for chance. This is due to the small number of questions and the fact that each contestant answers different questions. Particularly, during the preliminary rounds contestants are eliminated with a single mistake if there are more than 9 perfect scores.
The fact that a single mistake is not a reliable indicator for a contestant&#x27;s incompetence was demonstrated during the 2014 National competition. The preliminary rounds resulted in 9 contestants with perfect score who accordingly became finalists. The 10th spot was filled by tie breaker rounds between contestants who made a single mistake during the preliminaries and went to the Virginia champion Akhil Rekulapelli, who then went on to win the finals. Again in 2019, Nihar Janga was involved in a tiebreaker to advance to the top 10, and he went on to win the entire competition. Some also argue that the GeoBee became too focused on GeoChallenge rounds instead of standard geography questions. This was demonstrated in 2019, where more than half the total points in the semifinal and final rounds were based on these open ended GeoChallenge questions. Some also criticize the gender imbalance of the GeoBee; only two girls have ever won the contest. There was also a racial imbalance which skewed National Champions Caucasian until around the mid 2000s, and every single year since 2005, either the National Champion or the runner-up was a South Asian.

==Champions==

===National Champions===
Of the thirty-one National Geographic GeoBee champions, twenty-nine have been male and two were female. Five each are from the states of Texas &amp; Washington, four are from the state of Michigan, two each from Florida, Kansas &amp; New Jersey and various other states have been home to one champion each.

<doc id="427547" wikidata="Q7888082" url="?curid=427547" title="United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 1988">
<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1988 with the song &quot;Go&quot;, written by Julie Forsyth, and performed by Scott Fitzgerald. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1988&quot; ===
A total of 182 songs were submitted and at no time during the judging phase were the names of either the composers, authors or publishers divulged.

On the first listening phase, seven sessions at 26 songs per session were heard. Every song entered was played for 150 seconds each and voted upon. Eight judges consisting of music publishers&#x27; professional staff and members of the record buying public represented by staff of PRS and MCPS. When adding the votes, the MPA office checked whether any member of the panel had any interest in the songs and if found that an interest existed, that member&#x27;s vote was replaced by an average mark. The twelve songs from each session with the highest points were put forward to the Second Listening.

The Second Listening consisted of four sessions with 21 songs per session. All songs reaching this stage were mixed and re-numbered so that they were not played in the same order as first listening. Songs were then played again for 150 seconds each and voted upon. Eight judges consisting of similar representatives as the first session but individuals called at different times so that they did not appear with the same people as previous voting. When adding these votes, the MPA office checked whether any member of the panel had any interest in the songs and if found that an interest existed, that member&#x27;s vote was replaced by an average mark. Eleven songs from each session with the highest points went forward to Third Listening.

With the third listening, this consisted of one session divided into four sections at 11 songs per section, making a total of 44 songs. All songs reaching this stage were again mixed and re-numbered so that they were not played in the same order as previous listenings. The songs were played for two minutes each and voted upon. Fifteen judges consisting of similar representatives as previous sessions but also invited were special guests which included successful songwriters and record producers. No member serving on this panel had any interest in any of the songs. Top 3 from each session automatically put through to the final 20. Bottom 4 from each section were eliminated.
Middle 4 from each session put forward for Fourth listening.

On the Fourth Listening was one session of 16 songs. All songs reaching this stage were again mixed and re-numbered so that they were not played in the same order as previous hearings. Songs were played for 2 minutes each and voted upon. Continuation of third session and therefore the same judges were in attendance. The 8 songs with the highest score went forward to Fifth and final listening.

The Fifth Listening was consisted of one session of 20 songs to be reduced to 8 songs for the &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; broadcast. The listening was held at a meeting at the BBC Television Centre under the auspices of James Moir, Head of Variety. Judges consisting of Radio 2 and Television producers, representatives of the Music Publishers Association (MPA), British Phonographic Industry and British Academy of Songwriters Composers and Authors.

The final 8 competing entries were previewed on both &quot;Wogan&quot; and on BBC Radio 2.

====Format====

The 1987 contest was something of an experiment when compared to other contests of the era, with studio set was much larger, 10 songs were used instead of 8, and the songs were picked by the Music Publisher&#x27;s Association, and the record industry, in order to have a selection of songs that were more contemporary pop, instead of just songs that could win the Eurovision Song Contest. All of this changed in 1988 as the 8 song format returned, the songs were screened by just the MPA, and as such the songs were less contemporary than in the previous contest. Also gone was the regional jury voting to decide the winner.

For the first time since 1975, the public voted on the songs, although this time it was by telephone voting instead of postcards. Also introduced was a celebrity panel, to comment on the songs. They had no role in the selection of the winner, merely to pass comment. The panel were Mike Batt who discussed songs 2 and 6, Bruce Welch who had been runner-up in the contest with The Shadows talked about songs 4 and 8, Gloria Hunniford who passed comment on songs 3 and 7 and George Martin who talked about songs 1 and 5.

Additionally for the first time, the phone numbers to call appeared on screen and prior to the end of part one, a reprise of all the competing songs was played. A total of 337,557 telephone votes were cast.

==== Final ====
The BBC held the final on 25 March 1988 at Studio 1 of the BBC Television Centre in London. It was hosted by Terry Wogan. The theme music and title sequence were the same the one used in the previous year, a revamped Te Deum. The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of Ronnie Hazlehurst as conductor accompanied all the songs, but despite performing live, the orchestra were off-screen, behind the set. The contest was broadcast on Radio 2 and BBC 1.

The winner was chosen by televoting, which was &quot;Go&quot; performed by Scott Fitzgerald.
==== UK Discography ====
*Camino - &quot;High Windows&quot;: PRT/Tamarin PYS11.
*Klass - &quot;One More Chance&quot;: OK Records OK012.
*Scott Fitzgerald - &quot;Go&quot;: PRT PYS10.

==At Eurovision==
The contest was staged at the RDS Simmonscourt Pavilion in Dublin on 30 April. 21 nations took part and the UK performed in 4th position, following Finland and preceding Turkey. Scott Fitzgerald scored well and was involved in a tense battle for first place with Switzerland&#x27;s entrant Celine Dion. With only Yugoslavia left to vote, the UK was in first place with 136 points followed by Switzerland with 131. The Yugoslav jury proceeded to award Switzerland six points and after that it seemed highly likely that the UK would be given one of the higher remaining set of points. However as Yugoslavia announced its seven, eight, ten and twelve points, it transpired that it had awarded the UK no points at all, as the Yugoslav jury awarded its 12 points to France, leaving Switzerland with a one-point lead and allowing them to savour a dramatic victory.

BBC 1 broadcast the final on television, with commentary provided by Terry Wogan. Ray Moore had been scheduled to provide the radio commentary for BBC Radio 2, but Moore was undergoing treatment for cancer at the time, so Ken Bruce fulfilled the commitments. This was Bruce&#x27;s first involvement with presenting the Eurovision for radio. Bruce would go on to do the radio commentary until . The BBC appointed Colin Berry as its spokesperson to announce the British jury votes.

The members of the UK jury included Nicola Chapman, Terry Clarke, Alfred Collet, Geoff Dennis, James Douglas, Alison Fox, Mike Goss, Carol Holroyd, Muir Johnson, Karen Marsden, Mavis Masters, Molly Roberts, Andrew Sidell, Renate Smith, Paul Tunnicliffe, and Robert Unsworth.

&quot;Go&quot; was a minor hit in the UK charts.

<text>The [[Nikon]] D70 is a digital single-lens reflex camera, introduced at the 2004 PMA Annual Convention and Trade Show, as Nikon&#x27;s first consumer-level digital SLR, and a competitor to the Canon EOS 300D. It was often sold in a &quot;kit package&quot; with the Nikon 18-70mm AF-S lens. The Nikon D70 was succeeded initially by the Nikon D70s and eventually by the Nikon D80 and Nikon D90, announced on August 9, 2006 and August 27, 2008 respectively. The Nikon D70 is the first DSLR camera built by Nikon&#x27;s factory in Thailand. It debuted at a price of US$999.

== Features ==
The D70 features include:
*Nikon DX format sensor 
*1.5x field of view crop
*6.1 megapixel sensor (23.7 mm × 15.6 mm)
* 1/500th second x-sync
*Nikon F-mount lenses
*File formats include JPEG, NEF (Nikon&#x27;s raw image format), and JPEG+NEF
*Single Servo and Continuous Servo focus modes
*Continuous shooting at 3 frame/s up to 144 images using a high-speed storage card (minimum burst of 4 images with a low-speed storage card)
*ISO 200–1600 (in full stops or 1/3 stops selectable)
* Configurable Auto-ISO (Automatic sensitivity change to keep required Shutter and/or Aperture values)
* New TTL Flash System

Due to its hybrid electronic/mechanical shutter, it is possible to flash synchronize the D70 and D70s beyond their published 1/500 maximum synchronization speed up to the maximum shutter speed of 1/8000.

The Nikon D70 has been considered superior to its predecessor, the D100, despite the higher price of the latter. The D70 is backward compatible with most of the older Nikkor lenses. Sigma, Tokina and Tamron are other popular lens suppliers of Nikon F-mount lenses.

== D70s ==
In early 2005 Nikon announced the D70s. The D70s is essentially an update of the D70, adding a larger LCD screen ( instead of ), though still having 130,000 pixels. The D70s also comes with the newer EN-EL3a battery with slightly higher capacity. While the battery performance is increased, the new version of the D70 lacks the previously included MS-D70 battery holder, which allowed users to mount three CR2 batteries in the camera in case of a dead battery (notably the adapter is not compatible with CR123 batteries). The camera is also equipped with a terminal for a proprietary remote release cable (MC-DC1).

In addition, the D70s features an increased 18 mm angle of coverage from its built-in flash; the flash on the D70 could only be used with lenses as wide as 20 mm. All other updates to the D70s are available for the D70 through a firmware update, which include improved auto-focus performance, updated menu design and updated in-camera printer support.

The Canon EOS 350D (known as the Digital Rebel XT in the US) was its then-competitor when the D70s was introduced.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 1989 with the song &quot;Why Do I Always Get It Wrong&quot;, composed by John Beeby, with lyrics by Brian Hodgson, and performed by Live Report. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), selected its entry through a national final.

==Before Eurovision==
=== &quot;A Song for Europe 1989&quot; ===
&quot;A Song for Europe 1989&quot; was a very dis-jointed final. The original singer chosen for &quot;Back in the Groove&quot; was to have been Garry Gibb; the song &quot;Shame&quot; was to have been sung by its writer, Marwenna Haver, and the song that won had its name and the name of the performer changed.

The BBC held the final on 24 March 1989 at Studio 6 of the BBC Television Centre in London, featuring eight songs and hosted by Terry Wogan on BBC1. A separate results show was broadcast on BBC1 the same evening. BBC Radio 2 simulcast the final and also broadcast the results show, both with commentary by Ken Bruce.

The eight songs in contention to represent the United Kingdom were premiered in various programmes on BBC Radio 2 between 20 and 23 March.

The BBC Concert Orchestra under the direction of Ronnie Hazlehurst as conductor accompanied all but the winning song, but despite performing live, the orchestra were off-screen, behind the set. Hazlehurst conducted two live keyboard players who accompanied the UK entry’s backing track at the Eurovision final in Lausanne.

For the second year running, the BBC convened a panel to pass comment on each of the songs. The panel comprised Deke Arlon, Gary Davies, Leslie Bricusse, and former Eurovision winner Lulu.

There were 300,000 televotes cast in 90 minutes of telephone lines being open for voting.
==== UK Discography ====
*Frankie Johnson - &quot;Back In The Groove&quot;: Polydor FJ2 (7&quot; Single)/FJX2 (12&quot; Single).
*Elkie Brooks - &quot;Shame&quot;: Telstar STATS2394.
*Julie C - &quot;You Stepped Out Of My Dreams&quot;: Sonet SON2343 (7&quot; Single)/SONL2343 (12&quot; Single).
*Live Report - &quot;Why Do I Always Get It Wrong&quot;: Brouhaha CUE7 (7&quot; Single)/12CUE7 (12&quot; Single).

==At Eurovision==
The 1989 contest was staged at the Palais de Beaulieu in Lausanne, Switzerland on 6 May. 22 countries participated, and the UK performed seventh on the night. Live Report took second place with 130 points, seven points behind the winners, .

<doc id="427559" wikidata="Q1413574" url="?curid=427559" title="Multilateralism">
<text>In international relations, multilateralism refers to an alliance of multiple countries pursuing a common goal. Multilateralism is based on the principles of inclusivity, equality, and cooperation, and aims to foster a more peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable world. 
Middle powers play a crucial role in the international system by promoting multilateralism and internationalism.

One of the key advantages of multilateralism is that it enables countries to solve problems that transcend national boundaries, such as climate change, terrorism, and pandemics, through shared responsibility and burden-sharing. However, multilateralism is not without its challenges. The rise of populism, nationalism, and protectionism in some countries has raised concerns about the future of multilateralism and the effectiveness of international cooperation.

== Definitions ==
Multilateralism, in the form of membership in international institutions, serves to bind powerful nations, discourage unilateralism, and gives small powers a voice and influence that they could not otherwise exercise. For a small power to influence a great power, the Lilliputian strategy of small countries banding together to collectively bind a larger one can be effective. Similarly, multilateralism may allow one great power to influence another great power. For a great power to seek control through bilateral ties could be costly; it may require bargaining and compromise with the other great power.

Miles Kahler defines multilateralism as &quot;international governance&quot; or global governance of the &quot;many,&quot; and its central principle was &quot;opposition [to] bilateral discriminatory arrangements that were believed to enhance the leverage of the powerful over the weak and to increase international conflict.&quot;; Robert Keohane defined it as &quot;the practice of coordinating national policies in groups of three or more states.&quot;

John Ruggie further elaborated the concept in his influential writings on multilateralism. Based on principles of &quot;indivisibility&quot; and &quot;diffuse reciprocity he defined it as &quot;an institutional form which coordinates relations among three or more states based on &#x27;generalized&#x27; principles of conduct ... which specify appropriate conduct for a class of actions, without regard to particularistic interests of the parties or the strategic exigencies that may exist in any occurrence.&quot; He further clarified that multilateralism is &#x27;a unique product of US global hegemony [. . . ] not necessarily a post-war American invention&#x27;, but a reflection of post-war &#x27;American hegemony&#x27;.

Embedding the target state in a multilateral alliance reduces the costs borne by the power-seeking control, but it also offers the same binding benefits of the Lilliputian strategy. Furthermore, if a small power seeks control over another small power, multilateralism may be the only choice, because small powers rarely have the resources to exert control on their own. As such, power disparities are accommodated to the weaker states by having more predictable bigger states and means to achieve control through collective action. Powerful states also buy into multilateral agreements by writing the rules and having privileges such as veto power and special status.

International organizations, such as the United Nations (UN) and the World Trade Organization, are multilateral in nature. The main proponents of multilateralism have traditionally been the middle powers, such as Canada, Australia, Switzerland, the Benelux countries and the Nordic countries. Larger states often act unilaterally, while smaller ones may have little direct power in international affairs aside from participation in the United Nations (by consolidating their UN vote in a voting bloc with other nations, for example.) Multilateralism may involve several nations acting together, as in the UN, or may involve regional or military alliances, pacts, or groupings, such as NATO. These multilateral institutions are not imposed on states but are created and accepted by them to increase their ability to seek their own interests through the coordination of their policies. Moreover, they serve as frameworks that constrain opportunistic behaviour and encourage coordination by facilitating the exchange of information about the actual behaviour of states regarding the standards to which they have consented.

The term &quot;regional multilateralism&quot; has been proposed by Harris Mylonas and Emirhan Yorulmazlar, suggesting that &quot;contemporary problems can be better solved at the regional rather than the bilateral or global levels&quot; and that bringing together the concept of regional integration with that of multilateralism is necessary in today&#x27;s world. Regionalism dates from the time of the earliest development of political communities, where economic and political relations naturally had a strong regionalist focus due to restrictions on technology, trade, and communications.

The converse of multilateralism is unilateralism, in terms of political philosophy. Other authors have used the term &quot;minilateralism&quot; to refer to the fewest states required to get the biggest results through this institutional form.

The foreign policy that India formulated after independence reflected its idiosyncratic culture and political traditions. Speaking in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India, in March 1950, Nehru affirmed: “It should not be supposed that we are starting on a clean slate. It is a policy that flowed from our recent history and our national movement and its development and various ideals, we have proclaimed. (Nehru, 1961, p. 34). In fact, the foreign policy culture of India is an elite culture, meaning, in effect, that the writings and speeches of select leading figures of the Indian foreign policy elite provide an insight into the key ideas and norms constituting the foundation of India&#x27;s foreign policy.

== History ==
One modern instance of multilateralism occurred in the nineteenth century in Europe after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, where the great powers met to redraw the map of Europe at the Congress of Vienna (November 1814 to June 1815). The Concert of Europe, as it became known, was a group of great and lesser powers that would meet to resolve issues peacefully. Conferences such as the Conference of Berlin in 1884 helped reduce power conflicts during this period, and the 19th century was one of Europe&#x27;s most peaceful.

Industrial and colonial competition, combined with shifts in the balance of power after the creation - by diplomacy and conquest - of Germany by Prussia meant cracks were appearing in this system by the turn of the 20th century. The concert system was utterly destroyed by the First World War. After that conflict, world leaders created the League of Nations (which became the precursor of the United Nations) in an attempt to prevent a similar conflict. Although the League of Nations failed in its security mission, it initiated a variety of specialized organizations that continue to operate today. Moreover, although the US did not join, it did provide a degree of support from individual Americans and American philanthropies that started a tradition of public and private participation.

After the Second World War the victors, drawing upon experience from the League&#x27;s failure, created the United Nations in 1945. Since then, the &quot;breadth and diversity&quot; of multilateral arrangements have escalated. Unlike the League, the UN had the active participation of the United States and the Soviet Union, the world&#x27;s then greatest contemporary powers. Along with the political institutions of the UN, the post-war years also saw the development of organizations such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) (now the World Trade Organization), the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) (the so-called &#x27;Bretton Woods&#x27; institutions), and other technical institutions that were part of the UN system—including the World Health Organization. Formation of these and other subsequent bodies under the United Nations made the new system more powerful than the old League system. Moreover, United Nations peacekeepers stationed around the world became a visible symbol of multilateralism. Later, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was formed as a defensive alliance that used the multilateral form to promote collective security in the postwar era.

Multilateral institutions of varying scope and subject matter range from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)

== Challenges ==
The multilateral system has encountered mounting challenges since the end of the Cold War.

The United States became increasingly dominant in terms of military and economic power, which has led countries such as Iran, China and India to question the UN&#x27;s relevance. Concurrently, a perception developed among internationalists such as former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, that the United States is more inclined to act unilaterally in situations with international implications. This trend began when the U.S. Senate, in October 1999, refused to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which President Bill Clinton had signed in September 1996. Under President George W. Bush the United States rejected such multilateral agreements as the Kyoto Protocol, the International Criminal Court, the Ottawa Treaty banning anti-personnel land mines and a draft protocol to ensure compliance by States with the Biological Weapons Convention. Also under the George W. Bush administration, the United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which the Richard Nixon administration and the Soviet Union had signed in 1972.

These challenges presented by the U.S. could be explained by a strong belief in bilateral alliances as instruments of control. Liberal institutionalists would argue, though, that great powers might still opt for a multilateral alliance. But great powers can amplify their capabilities to control small powers and maximize their leverage by forging a series of bilateral arrangements with allies, rather than see that leverage diluted in a multilateral forum. Arguably, the Bush administration favoured bilateralism over multilateralism, or even unilateralism, for similar reasons. Rather than going it alone or going it with others, the administration opted for intensive one-on-one relationships with handpicked countries that maximized the U.S. capacity to achieve its objectives.

Another challenge in global governance through multilateralism involves national sovereignty. Regardless of the erosion of nation-states&#x27; legal and operational sovereignty in international relations, &quot;nation-states remain the ultimate locus of authoritative decision making regarding most facets of public and private life&quot;. Hoffman asserted that nation-states are &quot;unlikely to embrace abstract obligations that clash with concrete calculations of national interest.&quot;

Global multilateralism is challenged, particularly with respect to trade, by regional arrangements such as the European Union and NAFTA, although these are not in themselves incompatible with larger accords. The original sponsor of post-war multilateralism in economic regimes, the United States, turned towards unilateral action and in trade and other negotiations as a result of dissatisfaction with the outcomes of multilateral fora. As the most powerful nation, the United States had the least to lose from abandoning multilateralism; the weakest nations have the most to lose, but the cost for all would be high. Aside from changes in the US, populism in Europe has proven to be problematic to multilateralism in recent years. Results from direct elections to the European Parliament give evidence to this claim, as Eurosceptic parties have made advances.

== Comparison with bilateralism ==
When enacting foreign policies, governments face a choice between unilateralism, bilateralism and multilateralism.

Bilateralism means coordination with another single country. Multilateralism has attempted to find common ground based on generalized principles of conduct, in addition to details associated with a particular agreement. Victor Cha argued that: power asymmetries predict the type of structures, bilateral or multilateral, that offer the most control. If small powers try to control a larger one, then multilateralism is effective. But if great powers seek control over smaller ones, bilateral alliances are more effective.

Thus, a country&#x27;s decision to select bilateralism or multilateralism when enacting foreign policies is greatly affected by its size and power, as well as the size and power of the country over which it seeks to control. Take the example of Foreign Policy of the United States. Many references discuss how the United States interacts with other nations. In particular, the United States chose multilateralism in Europe and decided to form NATO, while it formed bilateral alliances, or the Hub and spokes architecture, in East Asia. Although there are many arguments about the reasons for this, Cha&#x27;s &quot;powerplay&quot; theory provides one possible reason. He argued: ...postwar U.S planners had to contend with a region uniquely constituted of potential rogue allies, through their aggressive behaviour, could potentially entrap the United States in an unwanted wider war in Asia... To avoid this outcome, the United States created a series of tight, deep bilateral alliances with Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan through which it could exercise maximum control and prevent unilateral aggression. Furthermore, it did not seek to make these bilateral alliances multilateral, because it wanted to amplify U.S. control and minimize any collusion among its partners.

<text>Teignmouth ( ) is a seaside town, fishing port and civil parish in the English county of Devon. It is on the north bank of the estuary mouth of the River Teign, about south of Exeter. The town had a population of 14,932 at the 2021 census. 

From the 1800s onwards, the town grew rapidly in size from a fishing port associated with the Newfoundland cod industry to a fashionable resort of some note in Georgian times; there was further expansion after the opening of the South Devon Railway in 1846. Today, its port still operates and the town remains a popular seaside and day-trip holiday location.

==History==

===To 1700===
The first record of Teignmouth, &quot;Tengemuða&quot;, meaning &quot;mouth of the stream&quot;, was in 1044. Nonetheless, settlements very close by are attested earlier, with the banks of the Teign estuary having been in Saxon hands since at least 682, a battle between the Ancient Britons and Saxons being recorded on Haldon in 927 and Danish raids having occurred on the Teign estuary in 1001.

There were originally two villages, East and West Teignmouth, separated by a stream called the Tame, which emptied into the Teign through marshland by the current fish quay. Neither village is mentioned in the Domesday Book but East Teignmouth was granted a market by charter in 1253 and one for West Teignmouth followed a few years later. The Tame now runs under the town in culverts and is visible only higher up the town as Brimley Brook, joined by smaller streams such as the Winterbourne (an intermittent stream, which flows only in winter or after heavy rain).

Documents indicate that Teignmouth was a significant port by the early 14th century, second in Devon only to Dartmouth. It was attacked by the French in 1340 and sent seven ships and 120 men to the expedition against Calais in 1347. Its relative importance waned during the 15th century, and it did not figure in an official record of 1577. This may have been due to silting up of the harbour caused by tin mining on Dartmoor.

During the 17th century, in common with other Channel ports, Teignmouth ships suffered from raids from Dunkirkers, who were privateers from Flemish ports. It is possible that smuggling was the town&#x27;s most significant trade at this time, though cod fishing in Newfoundland was also of great importance.

In July 1690, after the French Admiral Anne Hilarion de Tourville defeated an Anglo-Dutch fleet at the Battle of Beachy Head, the French fleet was anchored in Torbay and some of the galley fleet travelled the short distance up the coast and attacked Teignmouth. A petition to the Lord Lieutenant from the inhabitants described the incident:

After examining &#x27;creditable persons&#x27; the Justices of the Peace concluded that:

As a result, the Crown issued a church brief that authorised the collection of £11,000 for the aid of the town. Churches from as far afield as Yorkshire contributed, and the collections enabled the further development of the port. This was the last invasion of England, and French Street with its museum is named in memory of the occasion.

In the 1600s and 1700s there are records of a windmill on the Den – an area that was then a large sand dune, and is now a grassy public open space near the seafront. By 1759 this windmill was demolished.

===1700 to present===
In the late 18th century, privateering was common in Teignmouth, as it was in other west country ports. In 1779 the French ship &quot;L&#x27;Emulation&quot; with a cargo of sugar, coffee and cotton was offered for sale at &quot;Rendle&#x27;s Great Sale Room&quot; in the town. Teignmouth people fitted out two privateers: &quot;Dragon&quot; with 16 guns and 70 men; and &quot;Bellona&quot;, described as carrying &quot;16 guns, 4 cohorns and 8 swivels&quot;. &quot;Bellona&quot; set sail on her first voyage in September 1779, and was &quot;oversett in a violent Gust of Wind&quot; off Dawlish with the loss of 25 crew members.

The Newfoundland fisheries continued to provide the main employment into the early 19th century (e.g. Job Brothers &amp; Co., Limited). With the men in Newfoundland for most of the year, the women did the local fishing and rowed the ferries across the estuary. Early tourists, such as Fanny Burney, referred to the women as the &quot;Amazonians&quot; of Shaldon and Teignmouth, and wrote of their strength, health and tendency to wear trousers or hitch their skirts up to their knees to fish.

As the fisheries declined tourism increased. A tea house was built on the Den in 1787 amongst the local fishermen&#x27;s drying nets. By 1803 Teignmouth was called a &quot;fashionable watering place&quot;, and the resort continued to develop during the 19th century. Its two churches were rebuilt soon after 1815 and in the 1820s the first bridge across the estuary to Shaldon was built; George Templer&#x27;s New Quay opened at the port; and the esplanade, Den Crescent and the central Assembly Rooms (later the cinema) were laid out. The railway arrived in 1846 and the pier was built 1865–7.
A version of the legend of the Parson and Clerk dating to 1900 tells the tale of the Bishop of Exeter visiting Teignmouth and whilst being guided by a local priest, the devil turns them both to stone, which is seen in the form of two stacks.

The First World War had a disruptive effect on Teignmouth: over 175 men from the town lost their lives and many businesses did not survive. In the 1920s as the economy started to recover, a golf course opened on Little Haldon; the Morgan Giles shipbuilding business was established, and charabancs took employees and their families for annual outings to Dartmoor and elsewhere. By the 1930s the town was again thriving, and with the Haldon Aerodrome and School of Flying nearby, Teignmouth was advertised as the only south coast resort offering complete aviation facilities.

During the Second World War Teignmouth suffered badly from &quot;tip and run&quot; air raids. It was bombed 21 times between July 1940 and February 1944 and 79 people were killed, 151 wounded, 228 houses were destroyed and over 2,000 damaged in the raids. Teignmouth&#x27;s hospital was bombed during a raid on 8 May 1941, killing three nurses and seven patients. It was rebuilt and reopened in September 1954, making it the first complete general hospital in the country to be built after the formation of the National Health Service.

A US Navy plan existed which proposed to dam the harbour and set up a seaplane base, but it was abandoned as the war turned in favour of the allies.

===Port===
The port of Teignmouth, in existence since the 13th century, remains active, mostly handling clay, timber and grain.

The Old Quay was built in the mid-18th century on land leased from Lord Clifford. The opening of the Stover Canal by James Templer in 1792 provided a boost to the port due to the ease with which ball clay could be transported from the mines north of Newton Abbot. After travelling along the canal the barges continued down the estuary to the port. By 1820 this trade was supplemented by granite from the quarries near Haytor on Dartmoor carried via the unique granite-tracked Haytor Granite Tramway which was linked to the Stover Canal. The granite to build the new London Bridge came via this route and was sent from the New Quay, which had been built for this traffic in 1821–25 by George Templer, James&#x27;s son.

The Old Quay was sold to George Hennet in 1850 and became the centre of his trading network. It was connected to the South Devon Railway the previous year.

Until 1852 Teignmouth was legally part of the Port of Exeter. In September of that year, after many years of campaigning (latterly under the leadership of George Hennet), the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury agreed that Teignmouth should be independent which was the cause of much celebration.

Teignmouth has a tradition of shipbuilding from the 17th century. By the turn of the 19th century there were three shipyards in Teignmouth, and three in Shaldon and Ringmore on the opposite side of the estuary. The industry declined in the early 20th century, but in 1921 Morgan Giles bought the last derelict shipbuilding yard and gave the industry a new stimulus. His shipyard became a major employer, building pleasure craft in peacetime and small craft such as torpedo boats during World War II. The business failed in 1968 not long after Donald Crowhurst&#x27;s attempt to sail around the world.

The Shipwrecked Fishermen and Mariners&#x27; Royal Benevolent Society sent a lifeboat to Teignmouth in 1851 and kept it in a boathouse on the beach near the Custom House. In 1854 the society transferred its lifeboats to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). A new boathouse was provided on The Den with doors facing the harbour which was used until 1940. After a gap of fifty years, on 3 November 1990, the RNLI reopened Teignmouth Lifeboat Station with an inshore lifeboat.

Teignmouth&#x27;s lighthouse was erected in 1845 to guide ships into the harbour.

===Shaldon Bridge===
The original bridge was owned by the Teignmouth and Shaldon Bridge Company and opened on 8 June 1827. It had 34 wooden arches and was long, which made it the longest wooden bridge in England when built. It had abutment walls of a considerable length at either end, and a swing bridge at the Teignmouth end to allow sailing ships to pass up the estuary. It cost around £19,000 to build, but the overall expenditure was about £26,000 due to the costs of the necessary Act of Parliament and the purchase of the old ferry-rights. Toll houses were built at each end of the bridge, and the one on the Teignmouth side survives.

After eleven years, on 27 June 1838 the centre arches of the bridge collapsed, the timbers had been eaten through by shipworms. It was rebuilt in wood and reopened in 1840, but it partially collapsed again in 1893. The bridge was completely rebuilt between 1927 and 1931, using steel for the piers and main girders and concrete for most of the deck, except for the opening span which used timber.

On 28 October 1948 Devon County Council bought the bridge from the Shaldon Bridge Company for £92,020 and tolls were abolished. The original paintwork was inadequate to deal with the environment, and repairs were required in 1960 and in 1980. In 1998 it was discovered that the bridge had severe structural defects and work to correct this continued until 2002, the bridge remaining open throughout. After this work was completed, residents nearby noticed that in certain wind conditions the bridge &quot;whistles&quot;. the problem had not been solved.

In February 2016 Devon County Council announced that the moveable, lifting section of the bridge will be raised later in 2016, for the first time since 2002. This is in order to satisfy a condition in the Act that permitted construction, that the opening section be maintained.
==Transport==

===Railway===
Teignmouth railway station, which opened in 1846, is located close to the town centre. It lies between the stations of and on the Great Western Main Line between London Paddington and in Cornwall. In 2018–19, it recorded 706,000 passengers, making it the second busiest station on the Riviera Line after Newton Abbot.

The station is served by two train operating companies:
* Great Western Railway operates regular half-hourly stopping trains on a route between Exmouth, Exeter and Paignton. Some inter-city services between Plymouth, Paignton and London Paddington stop here, as well as some services between Cardiff, Bristol, Plymouth and Penzance.
* CrossCountry services between Manchester Piccadilly and Paignton stop here twice a day in each direction.

====History====
The line built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel runs along the South Devon Railway sea wall, which is a stone embankment between the sea and cliffs that runs for several miles between Teignmouth and Dawlish Warren. This line was originally both broad gauge and worked by the atmospheric system, with steam pump houses at regular intervals to create the vacuum. It was not successful for a host of reasons and was converted to normal steam locomotive working. Redundant sections of the atmospheric railway pipes were used as drains all over Teignmouth; one was set in the roadside in Woodway Lane, near Woodway House.

In December 1852, a large landslip from the cliffs east of the town caused the railway to close for four days; and, in 1855 and 1859, the sea broke through the line at Teignmouth. There have been many more closures since, caused both by landslips from the cliffs and breaches by the sea, especially in winter. In 2010, the sea walls and adjoining estuaries were costing Network Rail around £500,000 per year to maintain. In 1936, the Great Western Railway surveyed an inland deviation between Exminster and Bishopsteignton and a shorter route starting near Dawlish Warren; however, the advent of World War 2 brought these projects to an end.

===Buses===
Local bus services are operated predominantly by Stagecoach South West and Country Bus (Newton Abbot); key routes that serve the town include:
* 2: Exeter to Newton Abbot
* 22: Dawlish Warren to Paignton
* 81: Town centre to Teignmouth Morrisons

==Geography==

The town is located on the north bank of the mouth of the estuary of the River Teign, at the junction of the A379 coast road, the A381 road to Newton Abbot, and the B3192 which climbs up to the A380 on Haldon and hence on to the M5 away. Teignmouth is linked to Shaldon, the village on the opposite bank, by a passenger ferry at the river mouth and by a road bridge further upstream. The red sandstone headland on the Shaldon side called &quot;The Ness&quot; is the most recognisable symbol of the town from the seaward side.

In the harbour area was the Salty, a small flat island created through dredging operations but levelled, supposedly to improve natural scouring of the main channel for shipping, in recent years to leave a large tidal sand bank frequented by seabirds and cockle-collectors. Salmon nets are still employed by locals, especially near Shaldon Bridge.

The estuary seems disproportionately large for the size of the river flowing through it, this being especially apparent at low tide, because it is a drowned valley caused by a relative rise in sea level following the last Ice Age.

===Climate===
Teignmouth is situated on the coast of Devon, a peninsula of South West England. It has a mild maritime climate. Prevailing winds across the south-west of England are from the west. Teignmouth lies to the east of Dartmoor, in a lee / rainshadow, with mean temperatures 3 °C (5 °F) higher and less than 43% of the rainfall of Princetown, which is located on Dartmoor. It receives less precipitate per year than nearby Plymouth, which is located on the south-west coast of Devon.

Owing to its proximity to the sea, Teignmouth has warmer winters with less frost and snow, as well as slightly cooler summers compared with inland areas of southern England. January is usually the coldest month in Britain; however, sea temperatures usually reach their minimum temperature in late February, which affects Teignmouth&#x27;s climate, making February its coldest month. The first frost in Teignmouth usually occurs in late November or early December, whereas midland areas of England sometimes have frosts as early as September.

Snow is rare during the start of the winter season in December. Late autumn and early winter is the wettest time of the year, because sea temperatures are still relatively high and deep Atlantic depressions bring moist air across the South West. On average, July is the driest month, but summer thunderstorms can occasionally deposit more than the month&#x27;s mean rainfall in one day. Teignmouth has average daily sunshine totals of over 7 hours in summer and around 2 hours in winter. Sunshine totals reflect the hours of daylight and the fluctuations of the Azores High, which is most powerful in summer. The climate patterns also implicate a less pronounced cooler Mediterranean climate (&quot;csa/ csb&quot;) influence which is due to the decrease in precipitation centred over the summer period and surplus rainfall during the winter.

The Teignmouth weather station is located in an area of the town exposed to sea breezes, resulting in lower temperature extremes compared to more sheltered parts of the town and surrounding area. Temperatures at the station have increased in every month between the 1981–2010 and 1991–2020 climate periods, with notable warming in spring and autumn, along with a small overall increase in rainfall during this time. 
==Buildings==

Den Crescent and its central Assembly Rooms, laid out in 1826 by Andrew Patey of Exeter, still survive relatively unchanged today. The Assembly Rooms were the hub of the town&#x27;s social life in the 19th century and lavish balls took place in the long ballroom. In 1871, the building was taken over by the East Devon and Teignmouth Club which had an exclusive membership taken from the gentry and professional middle class.

Over the years, the building was used as a theatre, a dance hall, a conference centre and a billiards hall. In 1934 it was converted into the Riviera Cinema, in which guise it continued until 2000; part of the building has now been converted into flats. In 2016 the lease for the historic auditorium was taken over by the Mars Hill Church with the intention of restoring it as both a cinema and a music and arts facility.

The town&#x27;s parish church, dedicated to St. James is unusual, being octagonal in shape. A story from Cornwall suggests why these churches are rounded, for the villagers of Veryan built several circular houses so that the Devil had no corners in which to lie in wait for unsuspecting occupants and these buildings were therefore &#x27;Devil-proof.&#x27; The church of St Michael the Archangel is in the east of the town. St. Scholastica&#x27;s Abbey (now converted to flats), on the road to Dawlish, built in 1864 by Henry Woodyer is a notable Gothic Revival building, and the Roman Catholic Church, on the same road, is a late work by Joseph Hansom, the inventor of the hansom cab.

In 1894, there were 26 public houses in Teignmouth. Pubs today include the Blue Anchor Inn on Teign Street and the Devon Arms on Northumberland Place. The River Beach is home to a varied selection of seasonal and permanent beach huts, one of which (now removed to the town&#x27;s museum) was a Georgian bathing machine, minus wheels. These huts have enjoyed the boom in popularity of such properties in recent years and now change hands for figures approaching £100,000.

Teignmouth and Shaldon museum was completed in 2011. It comprises an architecturally iconic extension of the existing 18th century museum building, with new roof terrace looking over the town, glass tower and community facility. Some of the exhibits include a restored bathing machine; artefacts from the Church Rock wreck, such as cannons; exhibits from the nearby Haldon aerodrome, plus film footage including the Beatles&#x27; visit to the town and the 2009 homecoming concerts by Muse. The new build cost almost £1.1m and was enabled by a major community fund-raising effort, in combination with Lottery and UK government funding and other sources such as local grant funders and Devon County Council. The Church Rock wreck was found when a Zuanne Alberghetti cannon was located on the site of a 16th-century wreck, followed by further discoveries.

The town&#x27;s newest public building is the Pavilions Teignmouth, a community arts and enterprise centre on the Den, opened in April 2016.

==21st century==
On 27 July 2005, Teignmouth received status as Devon&#x27;s first Fairtrade Town. Also in 2005, the volunteer Teignmouth Regeneration Project in association with the town, district and county councils published a strategic plan that identified issues to be dealt with by 2015. Among the issues listed are to develop quality tourism, alleviate the danger of flooding to the town and provide affordable housing.
In May 2010, Teignbridge District Council put forward for consultation &quot;A Vision for Teignmouth&quot;. This was a plan consisting of 21 regeneration projects for the town. A skatepark was opened on the seafront in July 2010 and flood defences at the Fish Quay were completed in October 2012.

Two films, &quot;The Mercy&quot; starring Colin Firth with Rachel Weisz and &quot;Press for Time&quot; starring Norman Wisdom, have extensive sequences shot in Teignmouth.

==Tourism==
Although reduced from its heyday, Teignmouth still receives considerable numbers of holiday makers, in particular day-trippers. It is twinned with the French town Perros-Guirec.

Apart from its sea beach and Teignmouth Pier with amusement arcade and rides, the beach wraps around the spit at the head of the river Teign providing a river beach, commonly known as the Back Beach (dogs are allowed all year on this part of the beach), on the estuary side which overlooks the harbour with its moorings for many pleasure craft, and has views up the estuary to Dartmoor. An long waymarked route known as the Templer Way has been created between Haytor on Dartmoor and Shaldon. It closely follows the route of George Templer&#x27;s granite tramway, his father James&#x27;s Stover Canal and finally the estuary to Teignmouth.

Teignmouth Carnival is held during the last week of July with the procession on the last Thursday, and since 1999 the town has hosted a summer folk festival. In 2005 Fergus O&#x27;Byrne and Jim Payne from Newfoundland were the &#x27;headline&#x27; artists at that year&#x27;s festival which celebrated the town&#x27;s links with that region.

==Notable people==

Fanny Burney, the diarist and novelist, visited Teignmouth several times in the late 18th century. She took her first dip in the sea here in 1773, as she recorded in her journal. Elias Parish Alvars, the harpist, was born in East Teignmouth in 1808, and three years later Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt, vice-admiral, hydrographer and geologist, was born at Woodway House.

In spring 1818 the poet John Keats spent several weeks in Teignmouth and completed his epic poem &quot;Endymion&quot; here. His arrival coincided with a period of wet weather and he wrote to a friend of &quot;the abominable Devonshire Weather ... the truth is, it is a splashy, rainy, misty, snowy, foggy, haily, floody, muddy, slipshod county.&quot;

George O. May (born 1875), who made significant contributions to the field of accounting, and rose to senior partner of Price Waterhouse&#x27;s American firm in the early 20th century, was born and raised in Teignmouth.
From 1812 until his death in 1833, Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth had his home at Bitton House, which was then called West Cliff House. Meanwhile, Thomas Luny, the painter of seascapes, lived in the town for thirty years until his death in 1837 and executed over 2,200 paintings while living here. Shortly afterwards George Hennet, the railway engineer and contractor who was closely involved with Brunel&#x27;s railway, moved to the town and took a close interest in local affairs. He died here in 1857.

Charles Babbage (1791–1871), the mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, who originated the idea of a programmable computer, also lived here for some years and was married in St Michael&#x27;s church in the town.

Sir John Smyth (1893–1983) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross and was made 1st Baronet of Teignmouth in 1956.

The Belgium footballer Charles Vanden Wouwer was born in Teignmouth in 1916, while his parents were staying there as World War I refugees.

The Canadian Second World War pilot Roy Sydney Baker-Falkner settled in the Teignmouth area in 1930, his brother and sister studying in Teignmough whilst he was a cadet at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. He went on to be one of the few naval pilots of the Battle of Britain, was a test pilot and given the freedom of Teignmouth and Exeter after leading the audacious attack on the German battleship . He was lost in July 1944 and remembered on the Shaldon War Memorial and at the Teign Heritage – Teignmouth &amp; Shaldon Museum.

During the Second World War Clive Sinclair was evacuated to Teignmouth as a child and lived there for some years.

The businessman and musician Danny Thompson was born in the town in 1939, and the writer and environmentalist John Bainbridge (born 1953) spent his teens and early adulthood here and was educated at West Lawn School. The Norman Wisdom film, &quot;Press for Time&quot;, in which Norman becomes a reporter at the seaside town of &quot;Tinmouth&quot;, was shot largely on location in Teignmouth in 1966.
 A bus and bicycle chase shows many scenes of the town centre and sea front as it was at the time.

The next year, on 31 October 1968, Donald Crowhurst, competing in the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, started his ill-fated attempt to sail round the world single-handed from the town. His boat was a trimaran named the &quot;Teignmouth Electron&quot; after the town and his electronics company. The town featured in the film of this tragic event &quot;The Mercy&quot; released in 2018, starring Colin Firth and Rachel Weisz.

The three members of rock band Muse (Matt Bellamy, Chris Wolstenholme and Dominic Howard) attended Teignmouth Community College in the early 1990s. They started the band in the town and based their song &quot;Falling Down&quot; on their teenage years living there. The band performed two homecoming concerts entitled A Seaside Rendezvous there in September 2009.

Singer-songwriter Patrick Wolf wrote a song called &quot;Teignmouth&quot; for his 2005 album Wind in the Wires, which focuses primarily on the view of the town and the River Teign when taking a train along the coastline.

England rugby union and Exeter Chiefs player Sam Simmonds lives in Teignmouth, as does his brother and fellow Exeter Chiefs first team player Joe Simmonds. Sam helped the Chiefs win the Aviva Premiership in 2017. He has currently scored two tries for England and has one Man of the Match award.

<doc id="427563" wikidata="Q58755" url="?curid=427563" title="Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden">
<text>Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden (; 8 April 1655 – 4 January 1707) was the ruling Margrave of Baden-Baden in Germany, chief commander of the Imperial army and Reichsgeneralfeldmarschall of the Holy Roman Empire. He was also known as &quot;Türkenlouis&quot; (&quot;Turkish Louis&quot;) for his numerous victories against Ottoman forces. After his death in 1707, his wife, Sibylle of Saxe-Lauenburg, acted as regent of Baden-Baden during the minority of his eldest son, who succeeded him as Margrave of Baden-Baden.

==Family==
Born in Paris, Louis was a son of Hereditary Prince Ferdinand Maximilian of Baden-Baden and his French wife, Louise of Savoy. His godfather was Louis XIV of France. His father was the elder son of Wilhelm, Margrave of Baden-Baden, whom he pre-deceased, leaving Louis to succeed as reigning Margrave of Baden-Baden and head of the Catholic branch of the House of Zähringen.

His mother&#x27;s brother was the Count of Soissons, father of the renowned general Prince Eugene of Savoy, whose military career would start in the shadow of Louis, Eugene being Louis&#x27;s junior; the cousins would serve together the Holy Roman Emperor against the French in several campaigns. His parents being estranged, his father took him with him when he left from his wife&#x27;s home in Paris to Germany. There, Louis was raised by his grandparents.

==Military career==
Louis William served first under Raimondo Montecuccoli against Turenne, and then under the duke of Lorraine. His career was stimulated by his uncle Hermann of Baden-Baden, later president of the Hofkriegsrat. Together with his uncle, Louis took part in the capure of Philippsburg in 1676. At the siege of Vienna by the Turks, in 1683, he threw his forces into the city, and by a brilliant sally effected a junction with Jan III Sobieski and the Duke of Lorraine, who had come to its relief. In 1689 he defeated the Turks at Niš.

Louis came to be called the &quot;Türkenlouis&quot; or &quot;shield of the empire&quot;. The Turks called him the &quot;red king&quot;, because his red uniform jacket made him very visible on the battlefield. He was known as a defender of Europe against the Turks, as was Eugene of Savoy.
As a military commander in the service of the Holy Roman Empire, in 1689 he was made chief commander of the Imperial army in Hungary, where he scored a resounding victory against the Ottomans at Slankamen in 1691. Louis saw Osijek as a location of exceptional strategic importance in the war against the Ottomans. He urged the repair of the city walls, and proposed construction of a new fort called Tvrđa, according to Vauban&#x27;s principles of military engineering. 

After a fruitless campaign in 1692 due to a lack of funds and soldiers, he was appointed to the Upper Rhine at the request of the Swabian and Franconian Imperial circles. At the head of the circle troops that formed the Army of the Holy Roman Empire he defended the Rhine against superior French forces in the War of the Grand Alliance. Despite his military successes, his opposition against the elevation of the Prince of Calenberg to Elector of Brunswick-Lüneburg made him enemies at the Vienna Court.

In 1701, he built the Lines of Stollhofen, a line of defensive earthworks designed to protect northern Baden from French attack. He later commanded the imperial army at the Upper Rhine in the War of the Spanish Succession where he successfully concluded the Siege of Landau in September 1702, but soon had to withdraw across the Rhine and was defeated by the French under the Duke of Villars at Friedlingen. In 1704 however, he participated in the successful German campaign of Marlborough and Eugene of Savoy. He distinguished himself in the Battle of Schellenberg and besieged and conquered Ingolstadt and Landau, thus drawing Bavarian troops away from the decisive Battle of Blenheim.

At the Battle of Schellenberg in July 1704, Ludwig Wilhelm had suffered a wound that did not fully heal. He continued to command on the Upper Rhine without treating the injury and died as a result of this wound on January 4, 1707 at the age of 51 in his unfinished Schloss Rastatt. His wife took up a regency for their son, Louis George. The latter took over the government from his mother in October 1727.

==Marriage and children==
The Emperor gave him a young heiress to wed, Sibylle of Saxe-Lauenburg. They had the following children:
#Leopold William of Baden-Baden (1694 – 1695) Hereditary Prince of Baden-Baden, died in infancy;
#Charlotte of Baden-Baden (1696 – 1700) died in infancy;
#Charles Joseph of Baden-Baden (1697 – 1703) Hereditary Prince of Baden-Baden, died young;
#Wilhelmine of Baden-Baden (1700 in Schlackenwerth – 1702 in Schlackenwerth), died in infancy;
#Luise of Baden-Baden (1701 in Nürnberg – 1707), died young;
#Louis George Simpert of Baden-Baden, (7 June 1702 – 22 October 1761) Margrave of Baden-Baden, married Maria Anna of Schwarzenberg, had children; married again to Maria Anna of Bavaria, no children;
#Wilhelm Georg Simpert of Baden-Baden (1703 – 1709), died young;
#Auguste of Baden-Baden, (10 November 1704 in Aschaffenburg – 8 August 1726 in Paris) married Louis d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Orléans and had children.
#Augustus George Simpert of Baden-Baden, (14 January 1706 – 21 October 1771) Margrave of Baden-Baden, married Marie Victoire d&#x27;Arenberg, no male children.

Seventeen years after the margrave&#x27;s death, the only one of his daughters to survive childhood, Princess Auguste, married Louis d&#x27;Orléans, son of the infamous French Regent and, at the time of the wedding, first in the line of succession to the throne of France.

His descendant through this marriage became King Louis Philippe of the French in 1830.

After the death of Louis, his widow built Schloss Favorite castle as a summer residence in memory of her husband. He was buried at the Stiftskirche in Baden-Baden.

<text>Meshell Ndegeocello ( ; born Michelle Lynn Johnson on August 29, 1968) is an American singer-songwriter, poet, and bassist. She has gone by the name Meshell Suhaila Bashir-Shakur which is used as a writing credit on some of her mid-career work. Her music incorporates a wide variety of influences, including funk, soul, jazz, hip hop, reggae and rock. She has received significant critical acclaim throughout her career, being nominated for eleven Grammy Awards, and winning two. She also has been credited for helping to &quot;spark the neo-soul movement&quot;.

==Biography==
Ndegeocello was born Michelle Lynn Johnson in West Berlin, Germany, to US Army Sergeant Major and saxophonist father Jacques Johnson and health care worker mother Helen. She was raised in Washington, D.C., where she attended Duke Ellington School of the Arts and Oxon Hill High School.

Ndegeocello adopted her surname, which she says means &quot;free like a bird&quot; in Swahili. Early pressings of &quot;Plantation Lullabies&quot; were affixed with stickers to help pronounce her name. The spelling has changed in the hands of record labels a few times during her career; the correct spelling of her stage name as of 2001 is &quot;Meshell Ndegeocello&quot;.

==Career==

Ndegeocello honed her skills on the D.C. go-go circuit in the late 1980s with the bands Prophecy, Little Benny and the Masters, and Rare Essence. Going solo, she was one of the first artists to sign with Maverick Records, where she released her debut album, &quot;Plantation Lullabies&quot;. This recording presented a distinctly androgynous persona.

Her biggest hit is a duet with John Mellencamp, a cover version of Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Wild Night&quot;, which reached No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Her only other &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit besides &quot;Wild Night&quot; has been her self-penned &quot;If That&#x27;s Your Boyfriend (He Wasn&#x27;t Last Night)&quot;, which peaked at No. 73 in 1994. Also in 1994, Ndegeocello collaborated with Herbie Hancock on &quot;Nocturnal Sunshine,&quot; a track for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool&quot;. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

She had a No. 1 dance hit in 1996 with a Bill Withers cover song called &quot;Who Is He (And What Is He to You)?&quot; (briefly featured in the film &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;) as well as Dance Top 20 hits with &quot;Earth&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Stay&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;If That&#x27;s Your Boyfriend.. Last Night)&quot;. Ndegeocello played bass on the song &quot;I&#x27;d Rather be Your Lover&quot; for Madonna on her album &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;. Ndegeocello was also tapped, at the last minute, to perform spoken word on the same song. This came after Madonna and producers decided to remove Tupac Shakur&#x27;s rap (which he did while he and Madonna were dating in 1994), after he had criminal charges filed against him. Ndegeocello also performed spoken word on Chaka Khan&#x27;s single &quot;Never Miss the Water&quot;, from the album &quot;&quot;, released in 1996. The song reached #1 on Billboard&#x27;s Dance Club Play Chart and #36 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles Chart.

Her music has been featured in a number of film soundtracks including &quot;How Stella Got Her Groove Back&quot;, &quot;Lost &amp; Delirious&quot;, &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, &quot;Love Jones&quot;, &quot;Love &amp; Basketball&quot;, &quot;Talk to Me&quot;, &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s Daddy&#x27;s Little Girls&quot;, &quot;The Best Man&quot;, &quot;Higher Learning&quot;, &quot;Down in the Delta&quot;, &quot;The Hurricane&quot;, &quot;Noah&#x27;s Arc: Jumping the Broom&quot;, &quot;Soul Men&quot;, and &quot;Biker Boyz&quot;.

She has appeared on recordings by Basement Jaxx, Indigo Girls, Scritti Politti, and The Blind Boys of Alabama. On The Rolling Stones&#x27; 1997 album &quot;Bridges to Babylon&quot; she plays bass on the song &quot;Saint of Me&quot;. On Alanis Morissette&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Under Rug Swept&quot;, she plays bass on the songs &quot;So Unsexy&quot; and &quot;You Owe Me Nothing in Return&quot;. Also that year, she appeared on Gov’t Mule’s record &quot;The Deep End, Volume 2&quot;, playing on a cover of The Staple Singers’ song &quot;Hammer and Nails&quot;. And in 2009, she appeared on Zap Mama&#x27;s album &quot;ReCreation&quot;, playing bass on the song &quot;African Diamond&quot;.

She can also be seen in the documentary &quot;Standing in the Shadows of Motown&quot;, singing The Miracles&#x27; &quot;You&#x27;ve Really Got a Hold on Me&quot; and The Temptations&#x27; &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;. In the late 1990s, she toured with Lilith Fair. She also did a remake of the song &quot;Two Doors Down&quot; on the 2003 release &quot;Just Because I&#x27;m a Woman: Songs of Dolly Parton&quot;.

Ndegeocello was also a judge for The 2nd, 12th, 13 and the 2015 14th Annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers.

Her song &quot;Tie One On&quot; was chosen as the Starbucks iTunes Pick of the Week on February 23, 2010.

In 2016, she provided the theme song, &quot;Nova&quot;, for the Oprah Winfrey-produced show &quot;Queen Sugar&quot;. She also collaborated with French-Cuban duo Ibeyi in the song &quot;Transmission/Michaelion&quot; for the album &quot;Ash&quot; reciting a poem by Frida Kahlo.

In December 2016, the world premiere of Ndegeocello&#x27;s &quot;Can I Get a Witness? The Gospel of James Baldwin&quot;, a new theatrical music and art work, was held in Harlem, New York.

In June 2021, The Beatles Channel on Sirius XM Radio began broadcasting &quot;A Shot of Rhythm and Blues: Exploring The Beatles and Black Music&quot;, a four-part series hosted by Ndegeocello. The series explores the relationship between the English rock band the Beatles and the black musicians that inspired them.

Ndegeocello joined the Blue Note label with the debut release of her 13th studio album &quot;The Omnichord Real Book&quot; (2023). The title refers to a set of lead sheets from songs from funk, soul, gospel and more influenced by her father as if a compilation of standards like a real book in jazz repertoire.

==Activism==
In 2002, Ndegeocello collaborated with Yerba Buena on a track featuring Ron Black for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s tribute album to Fela Kuti, &quot;Red Hot and Riot&quot;. Proceeds from the album went to various AIDS charities, per the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s mission.

In June 2010, she contributed a cover of U2&#x27;s &quot;40&quot; to the Enough Project and Downtown Records&#x27; &quot;Raise Hope for Congo&quot; compilation. Proceeds from the compilation fund efforts to make the protection and empowerment of Congo&#x27;s women a priority, as well as inspire individuals around the world to raise their voice for peace in Congo.

In 2010, Ndegeocello contributed to the essay anthology &quot;It Gets Better: Coming Out, Overcoming Bullying, and Creating a Life Worth Living&quot;, edited by Dan Savage and Terry Miller in the vein of the It Gets Better Project.

==Personal life==
Ndegeocello is bisexual and previously had a relationship with feminist author Rebecca Walker. Ndegeocello&#x27;s first son, Solomon, was born in 1989. Since 2005, she has been married to Alison Riley, with whom she has a second son.

<text>The Dregoviches, also called the Dregovichi, were an East Slavic tribal union. They inhabited the territories along the lower Pripyat River and the northern parts of the right bank of the Dnieper River (more exact extents of the tribe&#x27;s domain are still unknown). 

==Etymology==
The name of the tribe most probably derives from the Proto-Slavic word &quot;*drъgъva&quot; (found only in Southern Belarusian as &quot;dregva&quot; and Northern Ukrainian as &quot;dragva, dryagva&quot;, which is a loanword from Baltic languages &quot;dreguva&quot; meaning &#x27;swamp&#x27;), because the Dregoviches used to live in the marshlands. Linguists consider that they are &quot;undoubtedly&quot; related to a South Slavic tribe with a similar name, Drougoubitai.

==History==
The first known reference to the Dregoviches is in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, where they are listed among the 12 tribes. However, there is a reference in the &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; of &quot;Constantine Porphyrogenitus&quot; to &quot;δρουγουβίται&quot;, &quot;Drougoubitai&quot;. Since the reference appears in a passage describing the &quot;Druguvitai&quot; as one of the Slavic peoples who pay tribute to the princes of Kievan Rus&#x27;, and they are named alongside the Severians and Krivichians, it was suggested these are the same people as the Dregoviches. By the 12th century, they were assimilated into the main East Slavic peoples.

The chronicles do not tell historians much about the Dregoviches. We only know that they had their own princely rule in the city of Turov. In the 10th century, the lands of the Dregoviches became a part of Kievan Rus and later the Turov Principality. The northwestern part of the land of the Dregoviches became a part of the Polotsk Principality.

His television appearances included starring in the shows &quot;Devenish&quot; (1977) and &quot;Pig in the Middle&quot; (1980). &quot;The Independent&quot; named him an &quot;outstanding actor with the qualities of a true farceur&quot;.

<doc id="427577" wikidata="Q3561564" url="?curid=427577" title="Triffid">
<text>The triffid is a fictional tall, mobile, carnivorous plant species, created by John Wyndham in his 1951 novel &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;, which has since been adapted for film and television. The word &quot;triffid&quot; has become a common reference in British English to describe large, invasive or menacing-looking plants.

==Fictional history==
===Origins=== 
In the novel, the origin of the triffid species is never explained. The main character, Bill Masen speculates as follows:

The 1962 film adaptation portrays them as extraterrestrial lifeforms transported to Earth by comets, contradicting the novel.

In the 1981 TV series, the triffids were the creation of real-life Soviet biologist Trofim Lysenko. The seeds were spread across the globe when a plane smuggling them out of Russia was shot down during the Cold War.

In the 2009 two-part TV series, the triffids are a naturally occurring species from Zaire, discovered by the West and selectively bred as an alternative to fossil fuels, to avert global warming.

===Name===
&quot;Triffid&quot; refers to the plant&#x27;s three &quot;legs&quot;. In the novel a dozen names beginning with &quot;tri-&quot;, with a long &quot;i&quot; vowel, had been bandied about before the term standardized on &quot;triffid&quot;, with a short &quot;i&quot;.

===Initial appearance and cultivation===
In the novel, it is stated that the first triffids appeared in equatorial regions. Though they develop faster in tropical zones, triffids soon established themselves worldwide, outside the polar and desert regions. When it was discovered that triffids are venomous, they were almost exterminated, until they were identified as the source of valuable oil. Farms were then built to cultivate them.

Upon the discovery that docking their stingers renders them harmless, docked triffids became fashionable in public and private gardens. These triffids are safe provided they are pruned annually, as they take two years to fully regrow their stingers. Farmed triffids are not docked because undocked triffids produce higher quality oil.

== Characteristics ==
===In the novel ===

The plant can be divided into three components: base, trunk, and head (which contains a venomous sting). Adult triffids are typically in height. European triffids never exceed ; however, in tropical climates, they can reach .

The base of a triffid is a large muscle-like root mass, comprising three blunt appendages. When dormant, these appendages draw nutrients, as on a normal plant. When active, triffids use these appendages to propel themselves. The character Masen describes the triffid&#x27;s locomotion thus:

Above the base are upturned leafless sticks which the triffid drums against its stem. The exact purpose of this is not explained; it is originally assumed that they are part of the reproductive system, but Bill Masen&#x27;s colleague Walter Lucknor believes they are used for communication. Removal of the sticks causes the triffid to physically deteriorate.

The upper part of a triffid consists of a stem ending in a funnel-like formation containing a sticky substance which traps insects, much like a pitcher plant. Also housed within the funnel is a stinger which, when fully extended, can measure in length. When attacking, a triffid will lash the sting at its target, primarily aiming for its prey&#x27;s face or head, with considerable speed and force. Contact with bare skin can kill a person instantly. Once its prey has been stung and killed, a triffid will root itself beside the body and feeds on it as it decomposes.

Triffids reproduce by inflating a dark green pod below the top of the funnel until it bursts, releasing white seeds (95% of which are infertile) into the air.

It is not clear whether the triffids are intelligent or acting on instinct. The character Lucknor states that although triffids lack a central nervous system, they display what he considers intelligence:

The triffids also show awareness by their habit of herding blind people into cramped spaces to kill more easily and rooting themselves beside houses, waiting for the occupants.

=== In other adaptations and sequels ===
The triffids portrayed on screen and in sequels often differ in appearance from Wyndham&#x27;s original concept.

In Steve Sekely&#x27;s 1962 film adaptation, the triffids (now given the binomial name &quot;Triffidus celestus&quot;) were designed with flaying tentacles below their stems, which they use as slashing weapons and to drag their dead prey. Also, their stinger is shown as a gas-propelled projectile, rather than a coiled tendril. Finally, the film triffids are vulnerable to sea water.

The 2009 TV adaptation shows the triffids dragging themselves with prehensile roots which can also constrict their prey. Their stalk is surrounded by large agave-like leaves and they secrete their oil (green rather than the novel&#x27;s pink) from their surfaces. Their stingers, which in previous film adaptations could not penetrate glass, are powerful enough to shatter windows, like those of the original triffids of the novel. Instead of a cup they have a pink flower-like head, resembling a cross between a lily and a sweet pea, that enlarges before releasing the sting.

In &quot;The Night of the Triffids&quot;, a small number of North American triffids reach in height. Aquatic triffids also appear but remain largely unseen, with the exceptions of their stingers: the latter described as prehensile. One character in the novel, Gabriel Deeds, speculates that the vibrations made by the triffids&#x27; sticks serve as a form of echolocation.
==Other mentions of the triffids==
Triffids, based on the 1981 TV design, and a triffid gun, make an appearance in &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier&quot;, a 2007 graphic novel written by Alan Moore and drawn by Kevin O&#x27;Neill.

In the online videogame &quot;Kingdom of Loathing&quot;, triffids are monsters located within an area known as &quot;the Spooky Forest&quot;.

In the mobile game for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; named &quot;The Simpsons: Tapped Out&quot;, one of the options to plant in Cletus&#x27; Farm are triffids, which comically bring about the &#x27;end of humanity&#x27;.

Reference is made to the original film in &quot;Science Fiction Double Feature&quot;, the opening song of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;. &quot;And I really got hot when I saw Janette Scott/Fight a triffid that spits poison and kills&quot;.

In the computer and mobile rogue-like video game &quot;&quot;, Triffids are a faction composed of human-sized plant creatures that are aggressive to the player. The more dangerous version of these creatures is the &quot;Triffid Queen&quot;, described as being cow-sized and very competent fighters with high hit points. If the player is able to defeat a &quot;Triffid Heart&quot;, the creatures will not continue to spawn in that area of the map.

==Other uses of the name==
&quot;Chromolaena odorata&quot;, a serious invasive weed, is sometimes known as &quot;triffid weed&quot;.

&quot;The Triffids&quot; were an alternative rock band from 1978-89, originating in Perth, Western Australia.

Specialised time-lapse camera rigs used to film plant movements in the 2022 television series &quot;The Green Planet&quot; were nicknamed &quot;Triffids&quot; after the fictional plants.

<text>Kings Langley is a village, former manor and civil parish in Hertfordshire, England, north-west of London and to the south of the Chiltern Hills. It now forms part of the London commuter belt. The village is divided between two local government districts by the River Gade with the larger western portion in the Borough of Dacorum and smaller part, to the east of the river, in Three Rivers District. It was the location of Kings Langley Palace and the associated King&#x27;s Langley Priory, of which few traces survive.

It is situated south of Hemel Hempstead and north of Watford.

The earliest mention in surviving documents of the manor of &quot;Langalega&quot; is in a Saxon charter dated &quot;circa&quot; 1050. It appears as &quot;Langelai&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, and is recorded as &quot;Langel&#x27; Regis&quot; (&quot;Langley of the King&quot;) in 1254. The name means &quot;long wood or clearing&quot;.

== History ==
A Roman villa has been excavated just south of the village.

The manor was probably a possession of the Abbey of St. Albans, the records of which have been lost. Following the Norman Conquest of 1066 the manor was one of hundreds given to Robert, Count of Mortain, uterine half-brother of King William the Conqueror. His tenant was a certain Ralf. The present village developed as a linear village along the old road from London to Berkhamsted and beyond to the Midlands. In the Domesday Book of 1086, Langley was in the hundred of Danish. By 1346 the place was known as &quot;Kyngeslangley&quot; and by 1428 as &quot;Lengele Regis&quot;.

In about 1276 the manor was purchased by Queen Eleanor of Castile (1241–1290), wife of King Edward I, and Kings Langley Palace was built on the hill to the west of the village with a deer park extending to the south. King&#x27;s Langley Priory, of the Dominican Order, of which remains survive, was founded next to the palace. The palace and the grand priory church fell into disrepair at the Dissolution of the Monasteries and little remains above ground level.

The Church of All Saints was built during the 14th century on the site of an earlier church.

It was the birth-place of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York (1341–1402), 4th surviving son of King Edward III (grandson of Edward I), whose tomb survives in All Saints Church. The body of King Richard II, eldest grandson and successor of King Edward III, was buried here after his probable murder at Pontefract Castle in 1400. It was later removed to Westminster Abbey, next to the Palace of Westminster.
The 18th century Sparrows Herne turnpike road (later the A41 trunk road) traversed the Chilterns via the valley of the River Gade and ran down the village high street. The 16th century Saracen&#x27;s Head public house is a coaching inn which flourished in this period.

The Grand Union Canal dating from 1797, and the 1838, London and Birmingham Railway which later became the West Coast Main Line, (the main railway line from London to the north west) pass just east of the village at Kings Langley railway station. There are many businesses located near the station in Home Park Industrial Estate which is also the site of the Construction and Engineering Centre of West Herts College.

20th century housing developments have led to the village spreading out on either side of the main road. The A41 has now been diverted west of the village leaving the high street to local traffic for the first time in centuries.

During the Second World War, the village was home to the secret headquarters in Britain of the Polish Underground army based at Barnes Lodge just off the Hempstead Road near Rucklers Lane.

Kings Langley was the site of the factory making Ovaltine chocolate drink; the listed factory facade, designed c.1923 by James Albert Bowden is now all that is left and still stands alongside the railway line among a new housing development. The Ovaltine factory itself has been converted into a series of flats and duplexes.

The former Ovaltine Egg Farm was converted into energy-efficient offices which house Renewable Energy Systems. The complex incorporates a highly visible 225 kW Vestas V29 wind turbine, nicknamed &quot;Lofty&quot; alongside the M25.

Kings Langley School is the local comprehensive school, situated on Love Lane to the west of the village.

Kings Langley was also the site of a Waldorf School, the Rudolf Steiner School Kings Langley which closed in 2019. This was built on the grounds of the old palace. There was a small display cabinet of finds from the palace period in the school entrance foyer.

The village became twinned with Achiet-le-Grand in France in November 2009, in honour of Christopher Cox from the village who won a Victoria Cross in fighting near Achiet-le-Grand in the First World War.

== Roads ==

The M25, the London orbital motorway, passes just south of the village on an imposing viaduct across the River Gade valley. To the north of junction 20 with the A41, a dual-carriageway bypasses Kings Langley and continues to the south of Tring where it flows into the original motorway-standard by-pass. The old route through Kings Langley is now classified the A4251.

== Rucklers Lane==

Just to the north of Kings Langley is a small village called Rucklers Lane, named after the road it is built on. The origin of the settlement in the early 20th century was the construction of a number of mock tudor houses for the workers on the nearby Shendish Manor estate. A community hall was also built for the workers in 1909 as a memorial to Arthur Longman, the owner of the estate; it was originally intended as a chapel of ease to avoid the long walk to the parish church. Further west along the lane is Phasels Wood Scout Camp and Activity Centre which opened in 1937.

<doc id="427588" wikidata="Q333446" url="?curid=427588" title="Michael Moore (Scottish politician)">
<text>Michael Kevin Moore (born 3 June 1965) is a British former Liberal Democrat politician.

Born in Northern Ireland, but largely raised in Scotland, he qualified as a chartered accountant and worked as a researcher to the prominent Liberal Democrat politician, David Steel. At the 1997 general election, Moore succeeded Steel as the Liberal Democrat MP for the Scottish Borders constituency of Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Berwickshire, Roxburgh &amp; Selkirk from 2005). He joined the Liberal Democrat Frontbench Team in 2005, and held many portfolios, including Defence, Foreign Affairs, International Development and Northern Ireland &amp; Scotland (joint).

Following the general election of 2010, and the formation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, the cabinet post of Scottish Secretary was given to the Liberal Democrats, initially Danny Alexander. However following the resignation of Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Laws a month later, Alexander took his role, and Moore was appointed the Scottish Secretary on 29 May 2010 after receiving the call asking him to accept the role at his child’s birthday party. After entering office, Moore oversaw the implementation of the Scotland Act 2012, which granted further devolution to Scotland. He was removed from the post in a Cabinet reshuffle in October 2013.

Moore was elected on two occasions (2005 and 2010) to serve as Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, and was returned on two earlier occasions (1997 and 2001) as MP for the previous constituency of Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. He was defeated in the 2015 general election by Calum Kerr, the SNP candidate.

==Background==
Moore was born in Dundonald, Northern Ireland on 3 June 1965 to Geraldine Anne (Jill) and Rev. William Haisley Moore, who was a chaplain in the British Army. He moved with his family to Wishaw, Scotland, in 1970 and then to the Scottish Borders in 1981. He was educated at Strathallan School, Jedburgh Grammar School and the University of Edinburgh, where he studied politics and modern history.

On leaving University he worked for a year as a researcher for Liberal Democrat MP Archy Kirkwood before joining the Edinburgh office of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. He qualified as a Scottish Chartered Accountant, going on to be a manager in the office&#x27;s corporate finance practice.

==Member of Parliament==
Moore was elected to the Westminster parliament during the 1997 general election as the MP for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale succeeding David Steel following his retirement with a majority of 1,489. In 2001 he retained his seat increasing his majority to 5,157. In 2005 following boundary changes Moore contested the Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk and won with a majority of 5,901, he defended the seat in 2010 once again retaining this time with a slightly decreased majority of 5,675.

===Liberal Democrat Frontbench===
After his election to Parliament he served as the party&#x27;s Scottish spokesman on the economy and a member of the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Select Committee before taking up the position of Transport Spokesman. In November 2001 he was made Deputy Foreign Affairs Spokesman under Charles Kennedy followed by the position of Defence spokesman. Under the leadership of Sir Menzies Campbell he looked after Foreign Affairs and under Nick Clegg took the title of Shadow Secretary of State for International Development. In 2002 he was elected to the internal position of Deputy Leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats and re-elected to the role in 2007. Moore resigned from that position on 20 September 2010 citing the pressures of an increased workload following his elevation to Secretary of State for Scotland following the 2010 general election.

===Secretary of State for Scotland===

Following the 2010 general election and the coalition government formed between the Conservative party and the Liberal Democrats, Moore was appointed Secretary of State for Scotland on 29 May 2010, a move that followed the promotion of fellow Scottish MP Danny Alexander to Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

====Early Question Time appearance====

Shortly after becoming Secretary of State for Scotland, he appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; programme, where he was challenged by an audience member who felt concerned that he would be made homeless by the government&#x27;s new housing policies. In response Moore said &quot;the horrible truth is that across the country everyone is going to have to make a contribution to getting the country right&quot;, before going on to explain that measures taken in the emergency budget were there to help the lowest paid. The audience member challenged Moore on the response and told him to &quot;get a grip&quot;. In the same programme, Moore said that fellow Cabinet member Michael Gove had made a major mistake in his announcement about the scrapping of the school rebuilding programme but said that the Education Secretary had apologised with &quot;grace&quot; for it. In September 2010 when compiling their list of the 50 most influential Liberal Democrats Moore was named by the Daily Telegraph as the 13th most influential. Describing him within the context of the role he occupied as a &quot;safe pair of hands in a job where the definition of success is being able to keep out of trouble&quot;

====2010 Spending Review====
As part of the British government&#x27;s 2010 Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) due to be announced on 20 October, Moore lent his support to Defence Secretary Liam Fox in cabinet discussions to retain funding for two aircraft carriers which would be constructed in yards around Britain, including in Glasgow and Rosyth in Scotland. The project, costing £5.2 billion was thought to be under threat following the spending review which many believed could result in a 20% cut in the Ministry of Defence budget. He also provided backing for the upkeep of RAF bases in Kinloss and Lossiemouth which it was estimated were worth 6000 jobs to the Moray economy after campaigners had feared that the bases may be closed as a result of the budget cuts. On visiting the bases Moore said: &quot;What I am determined to do is ensure we make the best possible case for the bases.&quot; but added that he could make &quot;no guarantees&quot; about the future of the bases. On 9 October 2010 it was announced that Moore had been appointed to the Government&#x27;s Public Expenditure Committee or &quot;Star Chamber&quot; following the settlement of his own departmental budget. He joined other cabinet ministers on the committee who had also agreed their own budgets and would help deliberate over the budgets of departments prior to the spending review announcement.

On 19 October 2010 David Cameron announced the results of the government&#x27;s review of defence spending just one day before the announcement of the spending review. The review contained disappointing news for RAF Kinloss as it was announced that government orders for Nimrod MRA4 surveillance aircraft would be cancelled. The cancellation of the project meant that the base would need to close with the future of RAF Lossiemouth also becoming uncertain with Michael Moore saying that the decision on its future still needed to be decided. Just a day later on 20 October 2010, the chancellor George Osborne announced the CSR. For Scotland this meant a budget cut of 4.6% or £1.3bn in cash terms. Moore claimed that Scotland had been given a &quot;fair deal in tough times&quot; although this was attacked by opponents in the SNP and Labour parties. He added that &quot;spending on frontline public services will be reduced by less than in England, Wales or Northern Ireland&quot; and said: &quot;if we don&#x27;t address that £155bn deficit now, Scots will end up paying longer and more&quot;.

====Tuition fees====
Speaking at the time Moore accepted that the issue of tuition fees was a &quot;very difficult issue&quot; for his party and said that his party &quot;wished&quot; that they had entered government with a budget that would have allowed the abolition of fees. He added: &quot;but we are part of a coalition government, grappling with a record peacetime deficit inherited from Labour.&quot; Moore claimed that without the changes, universities would be &quot;starved of the money they need to provide quality education&quot;. Because the issue of university funding is an area devolved to the Scottish parliament he added that Scottish students choosing to study north of the border would be unaffected by the vote and Scottish students would continue to pay no fees at all.

====&quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; secret recording====
On 22 December, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; published a recording of Michael Moore obtained by two journalists posing as constituents during one of his weekly constituency surgeries. The audio recording, obtained 24 hours after the vote in the House of Commons heard Moore express unease over the policy saying &quot;Tuition fees ... [are] the biggest, ugliest, most horrific thing in all of this&quot;. Speaking of the pledge he signed he expressed remorse, saying: &quot;I signed a pledge that promised not to do this. I&#x27;ve just done the worst crime a politician can commit, the reason most folk distrust us as a breed. I&#x27;ve had to break a pledge and very, very publicly.&quot; He continued that the vote on tuition fees was &quot;deeply damaging to my party, to me individually and lots of others&quot; but said: &quot;what we&#x27;ve all had to weigh up is the greater sense of what the Coalition is about.&quot; The journalists also recorded Moore speaking about the relationship between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats within the coalition. Moore expressed some unease between the two parties saying &quot;Are you watching what they are doing and what they are saying on the back benches of the Conservative Party? They are spitting blood.&quot; Naming some Conservative backbenchers allegedly uneasy with the coalition he said &quot;They are mostly marginalised. David Davis and people like Julian Lewis hate us with a passion and I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s unreciprocated.&quot;

====Scotland Act 2012====

On 30 November 2010 Moore announced plans for the Scottish Parliament to receive new tax and borrowing powers. The proposals, outlined in the Scotland Bill were based on the recommendations of the Calman Commission which looked at how to improve devolution in Scotland. The bill provided the Scottish Parliament with borrowing powers for the first time as well as providing opportunity for Holyrood to set a &quot;Scottish Income Tax&quot; rate each year from 2015. Should the proposals go through, the Scottish Parliament would be responsible for raising approximately 35% of the revenue it spends with the remainder being funded by the United Kingdom block grant. In addition to tax and borrowing, the Scotland Bill announced measures to transfer areas such as setting the drink drive limit and national speed limits in Scotland. Speaking about the bill Moore said: &quot;This Bill is the culmination of work by three Scottish political parties, numerous impartial experts, two successive UK Governments and the two Parliaments in London and Edinburgh.&quot; He said that future Scottish Governments would have more accountability for the financial decisions they make and said that the bill addressed a number of &quot;major issues and takes the settlement forward in a powerful and positive way.&quot;

===Backbencher===
Moore was replaced as Scottish Secretary by Alistair Carmichael in October 2013. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper said that HM Government wanted &quot;a more combative figure&quot; to argue against Scottish independence in the 2014 referendum. Moore became a backbench MP.

====Private Member&#x27;s Bill====
In 2014, he came second in a ballot to determine who could first introduce a Private Member&#x27;s Bill, behind his LibDem colleague Andrew George. Moore pledged to introduce a bill committing the UK Government to devote a minimum of 0.7 per cent of its national income to international aid.

The Bill passed successfully through all stages in the House of Commons and House of Lords, under the title of the International Development (Official Development Assistance Target) Bill 2014-15 and received Royal Assent as the International Development (Official Development Assistance Target) Act 2015 on 26 March 2015.

==== 2015 Election ====
At the 2015 election, Moore stood for the fifth time in the Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk constituency. He lost it in the SNP landslide of that election, coming behind the SNP and Conservatives, receiving only 18.7% of the votes cast, compared to 45.4% in 2010.

== Post-Politics ==
Moore now works as the Chief Executive of British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (BVCA). He was formerly (from 2015-2019) a Senior Adviser at PwC, where he worked in Deals and also supported the firm’s Regional leadership. Since 2016, he has also been the chairman of Borders Book Festival.

He now lives in Darnick in the Scottish Borders, with his wife and two children.

<doc id="427590" wikidata="Q16994022" url="?curid=427590" title="High treason in the United Kingdom">
<text>Under the law of the United Kingdom, high treason is the crime of disloyalty to the Crown. Offences constituting high treason include plotting the murder of the sovereign; committing adultery with the sovereign&#x27;s consort, with the sovereign&#x27;s eldest unmarried daughter, or with the wife of the heir to the throne; levying war against the sovereign and adhering to the sovereign&#x27;s enemies, giving them aid or comfort; and attempting to undermine the lawfully established line of succession. Several other crimes have historically been categorised as high treason, including counterfeiting money and being a Catholic priest.

High treason was generally distinguished from petty treason, a treason committed against a subject of the sovereign, the scope of which was limited by statute to the murder of a legal superior. Petty treason comprised the murder of a master by his servant, of a husband by his wife, or of a bishop by a clergyman. Petty treason ceased to be a distinct offence from murder in 1828, and consequently high treason is today often referred to simply as treason.

Considered to be the most serious of offences (more than murder or other felonies), high treason was often met with extraordinary punishment, because it threatened the safety of the state. Hanging, drawing and quartering was the usual punishment until the 19th century. Subsequent to the Judgement of Death Act 1823, it was the only crime other than murder for which a death sentence was mandatory. Since the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 became law, the maximum sentence for treason in the UK has been life imprisonment.

The last treason trial was that of William Joyce, &quot;Lord Haw-Haw&quot;, who was executed by hanging in 1946. The last conviction under a Treason Act was of Jaswant Singh Chail in 2023, who was charged with an offence relating to a plot to kill Queen Elizabeth II. At the time of the trial his offences were referred to in the media as simply &quot;treason&quot;, but the statute he was charged under describes it as &quot;a high misdemeanour&quot;.

==Offences==
High treason today consists of:
* Treason Act 1351 (as amended – last amended by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013):
**compassing the death of the sovereign, or of the king&#x27;s wife (but not a ruling queen&#x27;s husband), or the sovereign&#x27;s eldest child and heir
**violating the king&#x27;s wife, or the sovereign&#x27;s eldest unmarried daughter, or the sovereign&#x27;s eldest son&#x27;s wife (only if the eldest son is also heir to the throne)
**levying war against the sovereign in the realm
**adhering to the sovereign&#x27;s enemies, giving them aid and comfort, in the realm or elsewhere
**killing the King&#x27;s Chancellor, Treasurer (an office long in commission) or Justices
* Treason Act 1702 and Treason Act (Ireland) 1703:
**attempting to hinder the succession to the throne under the Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701
* Treason Act 1708:
**killing the Lords of Session or Lords of Justiciary in Scotland
**(in Scots law only) counterfeiting the Great Seal of Scotland

For detail about the offences created by the 1351 Act, see .

===Northern Ireland===
In addition to the acts of 1351 and 1703, two additional acts passed by the old Parliament of Ireland apply to Northern Ireland alone. The following is also treason:
* Treason Act (Ireland) 1537:
**attempting bodily harm to the king, queen, or their heirs apparent
**attempting to deprive them of their title
**publishing that the sovereign is a heretic, tyrant, infidel or usurper of the Crown
**rebelliously withholding from the sovereign his fortresses, ships, artillery etc.
* Crown of Ireland Act 1542:
**doing anything to endanger the sovereign&#x27;s person
**doing anything which might disturb or interrupt the sovereign&#x27;s possession of the Crown
Although the Act of Supremacy (Ireland) 1560 (2 Eliz. 1. c. 1 (I)) is still in force, it is no longer treason to contravene it.)

===Treason felony===
In addition to the crime of treason, the Treason Felony Act 1848 (still in force today) created a new offence known as &quot;treason felony&quot;, with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment instead of death (but today, due to the abolition of the death penalty, the maximum penalty both for high treason and treason felony is the same—life imprisonment). Under the traditional categorisation of offences into treason, felonies, and misdemeanours, treason felony was merely another form of felony. Several categories of treason which had been introduced by the Sedition Act 1661 were reduced to felonies. While the common law offences of misprision and compounding were abolished in respect of felonies (including treason felony) by the Criminal Law Act 1967, which abolished the distinction between misdemeanour and felony, misprision of treason and compounding treason are still offences under the common law.

It is treason felony to &quot;compass, imagine, invent, devise, or intend&quot;:

* to deprive the sovereign of the Crown,
* to levy war against the sovereign &quot;in order by force or constraint to compel her to change her measures or counsels, or in order to put any force or constraint upon or in order to intimidate or overawe both Houses or either House of Parliament&quot;, or
* to &quot;move or stir&quot; any foreigner to invade the United Kingdom or any other country belonging to the sovereign.

===Treason Act 1842===
Section 2 of the Treason Act 1842 creates offences of assaulting or alarming the Sovereign or having a weapon in the Sovereign&#x27;s presence. This is described as &quot;a high misdemeanour&quot; and has a maximum sentence of seven years.

==History: England and Wales==
In England, there was no clear common law definition of treason; it was for the king and his judges to determine if an offence constituted treason. Thus, the process became open to abuse, and decisions were often arbitrary. For instance, during the reign of Edward III, a knight was convicted of treason because he assaulted one of the king&#x27;s subjects and held him for a ransom of £90. It was only in 1351 that Parliament passed legislation on the subject of treason. Under the Treason Act 1351, or &quot;Statute of Treasons&quot;, which distinguished between high and petty treason, several distinct offences constitute high treason; most of them continue to do so, while those relating to forgery have been relegated to ordinary offences.
First, it was high treason to &quot;compass or imagine the death of our Lord the King, of our Lady his Queen, or of their eldest son and heir.&quot; The terms &quot;compass or imagine&quot; indicate the premeditation of a murder; it would not be high treason to accidentally kill the sovereign or any other member of the royal family (though someone could be charged with manslaughter). However it has also been held to include rebelling against or trying to overthrow the monarch, as experience has shown that this normally involves the monarch&#x27;s death. The terms of this provision have been held to include both male and female sovereigns, but only the spouses of male sovereigns. It is not sufficient to merely allege that an individual is guilty of high treason because of his thoughts or imaginations; there must be an overt act indicating the plot.

A second form of high treason defined by the Treason Act 1351 was having sexual intercourse with &quot;the King&#x27;s companion, or the King&#x27;s eldest daughter unmarried, or the wife of the King&#x27;s eldest son and heir.&quot; If the intercourse is not consensual, only the rapist is liable, but if it is consensual, then both parties are liable. Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, wives of Henry VIII, were found guilty of treason for this reason. The jurist Sir William Blackstone writes that &quot;the plain intention of this law is to guard the Blood Royal from any suspicion of bastardy, whereby the succession to the Crown might be rendered dubious.&quot; Thus, only women are covered in the statute; it is not, for example, high treason to rape a queen regnant&#x27;s husband. Similarly, it is not high treason to rape a widow of the sovereign or of the heir apparent. 

In 1994, the book &quot;Princess in Love&quot; by Anna Pasternak, for which James Hewitt was a major source, alleged that Hewitt had a five-year affair with Diana, Princess of Wales from 1986 to 1991. Diana confirmed the affair in her 1995 &quot;Panorama&quot; interview. As she was then the wife of the Prince of Wales, heir to the throne, this fitted the definition of high treason, and a national newspaper briefly attempted to have Hewitt prosecuted for what was then still a capital offence.

It is high treason &quot;if a man do levy war against our Lord the King in his realm&quot; or &quot;if a man be adherent to the King&#x27;s enemies in his realm, giving to them aid and comfort in the realm or elsewhere.&quot; Conspiracy to levy war or aid the sovereign&#x27;s enemies do not amount to this kind of treason, though it may be encompassing the Sovereign&#x27;s death. In modern times only these kinds of treason have actually been prosecuted (during the World Wars and the Easter Rising).

The Treason Act 1351 made it high treason to &quot;slay the Chancellor, Treasurer, or the King&#x27;s justices of the one bench or the other, justices in eyre, or justices of assize, and all other justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their places doing their offices.&quot;

The last types of high treason defined by the Treason Act 1351 were the forgery of the Great Seal or Privy Seal, the counterfeiting of English (later British) money and the importing of money known to be counterfeit. These offences, however, were reduced to felonies rather than high treasons by the Forgery Act 1861 and Coinage Act 1832 (2 &amp; 3 Will. 4. c. 34) respectively.

Finally, the Treason Act 1351 specified that the listing of offences was meant to be exhaustive. Only Parliament, not the courts, could add to the list. It provided that if &quot;other like cases of treason may happen in time to come, which cannot be thought of nor declared at present&quot;, the court may refer the matter to the King and Parliament, which could then determine the matter by passage of an act. &quot;(See constructive treason.)&quot;

After the passage of the Treason Act 1351, several other offences were deemed to comprise high treason by act of Parliament. Parliament seemed especially unrestrained during the reign of Edward III&#x27;s successor, Richard II. Numerous new offences—including intending to kill the Sovereign (even without an overt act demonstrating such intent) and killing an ambassador—were declared treasonable by the Treason Act 1397 (21 Ric. 2. c. 12). Richard II, however, was deposed; his successor, Henry IV, rescinded the legislation and restored the standard of Edward III.

In 1495 Poynings&#x27; Law extended English law to cover Ireland.

From the reign of Henry IV onwards, several new offences were made treasons; most legislation on the subject was passed during the reign of Henry VIII. It became high treason to deface money; to escape from prison whilst detained for committing treason, or to aid in an escape of a person detained for treason; to commit arson to extort money; to refer to the Sovereign offensively in public writing; to counterfeit the Sovereign&#x27;s sign manual, signet or privy seal; to refuse to abjure the authority of the Pope; to marry any of the Sovereign&#x27;s children, sisters, aunts, nephews or nieces without royal permission; to marry the Sovereign without disclosing prior sexual relationships; attempting to enter into a sexual relationship (out of marriage) with the Queen or a Princess; denying the Sovereign&#x27;s official styles and titles; and refusing to acknowledge the Sovereign as the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Some offences, whose complexion was entirely different from traitorous actions, were nevertheless made treasons; thus, it was high treason for a Welshman to steal cattle, to commit murder by poisoning (1531), or for an assembly of twelve or more rioters to refuse to disperse when so commanded.

All new forms of high treason introduced since the Treason Act 1351, except those to do with forgery and counterfeiting, were abrogated by the Treason Act 1547 (1 Edw. 6 c. 12), which was passed at the beginning of the reign of Edward VI. The act created new kinds of treason, however, including denying that the King was the Supreme Head of the Church, and attempting to interrupt the succession to the throne as determined by the Act of Succession 1543.

When Mary I became queen in 1553, she passed the Treason Act 1553 (1 Mar. Sess. 1 c. 1), abolishing all treasons whatsoever which had been created since 1351. Later that year, however, the offence of forging the Sovereign&#x27;s sign manual or signet once again became high treason under the Treason (No. 2) Act 1553 (1 Mar. Sess. 2 c. 6). Furthermore, the anti-counterfeiting laws were extended so as to include foreign money deemed legal tender in England. Thus, it became high treason to counterfeit such foreign money, or to import counterfeit foreign money and actually attempt to use it to make a payment. (But importing any counterfeit English money remained high treason, even if no attempt were made to use it in payment.) Mary also made it high treason under the Treason Act 1554 (1 &amp; 2 Ph. &amp; M. c. 10) to kill Philip II of Spain, her king consort, or to try to deprive him of his title.

William III made it high treason to manufacture, buy, sell or possess instruments whose sole purpose is to coin money. He also made adding any inscription normally found on a coin to any piece of metal that may resemble a coin high treason. George II made it high treason to mark or colour a silver coin so as to make it resemble a gold one.

Aside from laws relating to counterfeiting and succession, very few acts concerning the definition of high treason were passed. Under the Act of Supremacy 1558, passed during the reign of Elizabeth I, it was high treason for an individual to attempt to defend the jurisdiction of the Pope over the English Church for a third time (a first offence being a misdemeanour and a second offence a felony), or for a Roman Catholic priest to enter the realm and refuse to conform to the English Church, or, under the Religion Act 1580, to purport to release a subject of his allegiance to the Crown or the Church of England and to reconcile him or her with a foreign power. Charles II&#x27;s Sedition Act 1661 made it treason to imprison, restrain or wound the king. Although this law was abolished in the United Kingdom in 1998, it still continues to apply in some Commonwealth countries. Under laws passed after James II was deposed, it became treasonable to correspond with the Jacobite claimants , or to hinder succession to the Throne under the Act of Settlement 1701, or to publish that anyone other than the individual specified by the Act of Settlement had the right to inherit the Crown.

==History: after union with Scotland==
In 1708, following the Union of England and Scotland in the previous year, Queen Anne signed the Treason Act 1708, which harmonised the treason laws of both former kingdoms (effective from 1 July 1709). The English offences of high treason and misprision of treason (but not petty treason) were extended to Scotland, and the treasonable offences then existing in Scotland were abolished. These were: &quot;theft in Landed Men&quot;, murder in breach of trust, fire-raising, &quot;firing coalheughs&quot; and assassination. The Act also made it treason to counterfeit the Great Seal of Scotland, or to slay the Lords of Session or Lords of Justiciary &quot;sitting in Judgment in the Exercise of their Office within Scotland&quot;.

In general, treason law in Scotland remained the same as in England, except that when in England the offence of counterfeiting the Great Seal of the United Kingdom &quot;etc.&quot; (an offence under other legislation) was reduced from treason to felony by the Forgery Act 1861, that Act did not apply to Scotland, and though in England since 1861 it has not been treason to forge the Scottish Great Seal, in Scotland this remains treason today. When the Scottish Parliament was set up in 1998, treason and treason felony were among the &quot;reserved matters&quot; it was prohibited from legislating about, ensuring that the law of treason remains uniform throughout Great Britain.

Between 1817 and 1820 it was treason to kill the Prince Regent. In 1832 counterfeiting money ceased to be treason and became a felony. In Ireland, counterfeiting seals ceased to be treason in 1861, in line with England and Wales.

===First World War===
A notable treason trial occurred at the Old Bailey in 1916 when Roger Casement was convicted of collusion with Germany for his role in the Easter Rising in Ireland. The charges against him were conspiracy to incite mutiny among Prisoners of War held captive by Germany, collusion with an enemy power in times of war, arms trafficking, and levying war against the King. Casement notably did not deny any of the charges brought against him and simply refused to acknowledge that the Treason Act 1351 even applied to him, leaving his defence counsel with few options beyond arguing about legal technicalities around the precise wording of the Act. The prosecution countered that as Casement had worked as a diplomat for the British Government for almost all of his adult life and had accepted a knighthood and a pension from the Crown on retirement in 1911, he owed personal loyalty to the King when he committed the acts for which he was brought to trial. The jury agreed with the prosecution and found Casement guilty. He was hanged at Pentonville Prison on 3 August 1916.

The Titles Deprivation Act 1917 authorised the king to deprive peers of their peerage if they had assisted the enemy during the war, or voluntarily resided in enemy territory. This was mainly in response to the closeness of the British royal family with some German thrones, leading to the loss of British titles from the dukes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Brunswick, the Crown Prince of Hanover, and the Viscount Taaffe. Whilst the act allowed for their descendants to petition for the restoration of these titles, no descendant has done so.

===Second World War===
John Amery was executed in 1945 after pleading guilty to eight charges of treason for efforts to recruit British prisoners of war into the British Free Corps and for making propaganda broadcasts for Nazi Germany.

The last execution for treason in the United Kingdom was held in 1946. William Joyce (also known as Lord Haw Haw) stood accused of levying war against King George VI by travelling to Germany in the early months of World War II and taking up employment as a broadcaster of pro-Nazi propaganda to British radio audiences. He was awarded a personal commendation by Adolf Hitler in 1944 for his contribution to the German war effort. On his capture at the end of the war, Parliament rushed through the Treason Act 1945 (8 &amp; 9 Geo. 6. c. 44) to facilitate a trial that would have the same procedure as a trial for murder. Before the act, a trial for treason short of regicide involved an elaborate and lengthy medieval procedure. Although Joyce was born in the United States to an Irish father and an English mother, he had moved to Britain in his teens and applied for a British passport in 1933 which was still valid when he defected to Germany and so under the law he owed allegiance to Britain. He appealed against his conviction to the House of Lords on the grounds he had lied about his country of birth on the passport application and did not owe allegiance to any country at the beginning of the war. The appeal was not upheld and he was executed at Wandsworth Prison on 3 January 1946.

It is thought the strength of public feeling against Joyce as a perceived traitor was the driving force behind his prosecution. The only evidence offered at his trial that he had begun broadcasting from Germany while his British passport was valid was the testimony of a London police inspector who had questioned him before the war while he was an active member of the British Union of Fascists and claimed to have recognised his voice on a propaganda broadcast in the early weeks of the war (he already had previous convictions for assault and riotous assembly as a result of street fights with communists and anarchists).

====Treachery Act 1940====
Until 1945 treason had its own rules of evidence and procedure which made it difficult to prosecute accused traitors, such as the need for two witnesses to the same offence. Consequently, in the Second World War it was perceived that there was a need for a new offence with which to deal with traitors more expediently. The Treachery Act 1940 created a new capital felony called treachery. Seventeen people were shot or hanged for this offence rather than for treason (one death sentence was commuted). Theodore Schurch was the last person to be put to death for treachery, in 1946. He was also the last person to be executed for a crime other than murder. Josef Jakobs, a German spy executed for treachery, was the last person to be executed in the Tower of London.

The Treachery Act 1940 was suspended in February 1946, and was repealed in 1967.

===1945 to 2015===
In June 1945 the Treason Act 1945 abolished the special rules of evidence and procedure formerly used in treason trials, and replaced them with the rules applicable to murder trials, to simplify the law. As discussed above, the last treason prosecutions occurred later that year.

From 1945, treason consisted of the offences which are treason today (see above), plus two other kinds. The Succession to the Crown Act 1707 made it treason to affirm that any person has a right to succeed to the Crown otherwise than according to the Act of Settlement and Acts of Union, or that the Crown and Parliament cannot legislate for the limitation of the succession to the Crown. This was abolished in 1967. The Treason Act 1795 made it treason to &quot;compass, imagine, invent, devise or intend death or destruction, or any bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maim or wounding, imprisonment or restraint, of the person of ... the King.&quot; This was abolished in 1998, when the death penalty was also abolished.

On 26 March 2015 the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 came into effect, which amended the line of succession to the throne to give women the same right to succeed to the throne as their brothers. In consequence of this, the Treason Act 1351 was amended in two ways. Whereas it had been treason to encompass the death of the monarch&#x27;s eldest &quot;son&quot; and heir, this was amended to cover an heir of either sex. It had also been treason to &quot;violate&quot; the wife of the monarch&#x27;s eldest son, but the 2013 Act restricted this to cases where the eldest son is also the heir to the throne.

==Liability==
As a general rule, no British criminal court has jurisdiction over the Sovereign, from whom they derive their authority. As Sir William Blackstone writes, &quot;the law supposes an incapacity of doing wrong from the excellence and perfection ... of the King.&quot; Furthermore, to charge the sovereign with high treason would be inconsistent, as it would constitute accusing him of disloyalty to himself. After the English Civil War, however, Charles I was tried for treason against the people of England. His trial and execution were irregular; they were more accurately products of a revolution, rather than a legal precedent, and those responsible were themselves tried for treason after the monarchy was restored &quot;(see List of regicides of Charles I)&quot;. However, a person who attempts to become the Sovereign without a valid claim can be held guilty of treason. Consequently, Lady Jane Grey was executed for treason for usurping the throne in 1553.

An alien resident in the United Kingdom owes allegiance to the Crown, and may be prosecuted for high treason. The only exception is an enemy lawful combatant in wartime, e.g. a uniformed enemy soldier on British territory.

A British subject resident abroad also continues to owe allegiance to the Crown. If he or she becomes a citizen of another state before a war during which he bears arms against the Crown, he or she is not guilty of high treason. On the other hand, becoming a citizen of an enemy state during wartime is high treason, as it constitutes adhering to the sovereign&#x27;s enemies.

Insane individuals are not punished for their crimes. During the reign of Henry VIII, however, it was enacted that in the cases of high treason, an idiot could be tried in his absence as if he were perfectly sane. In the reign of Mary I, this statute was repealed. Today there are powers to send insane defendants to a mental hospital.

The Treason Act 1495 provides that in a civil war between two claimants to the throne, those who fight for the losing side cannot be held guilty of a crime merely for fighting against the winner.

===Duress and marital coercion===
Duress is not available as a defence to treason involving the death of the sovereign.

In England and Wales and in Northern Ireland, the former defence of marital coercion was not available to a wife charged with treason.

==Trial==
Peers and their wives and widows were formerly entitled to be tried for treason and for felonies in the House of Lords or the Court of the Lord High Steward, the former being used in every case except when Parliament was not in session. In the House of Lords, the Lord High Steward presided, but the entire House acted as both judge and jury. In the Lord High Steward&#x27;s Court, the Lord High Steward was a judge, and a panel of &quot;Lords Triers&quot; served as a jury. There was no right of peremptory challenge in either body. Trial by either body ceased in 1948, since when peers have been tried in the same courts as commoners.

Commoners, and now peers and their wives and widows, are entitled to be tried for high treason, and also for lesser crimes, by jury. Formerly, commoners were entitled to thirty-five peremptory challenges in cases of treason, but only twenty in cases of felony and none in cases of misdemeanours; all peremptory challenges, however, were abolished in 1988.

Another mode of trial for treason, and also for other crimes, is an impeachment trial in the House of Lords following impeachment by the House of Commons (which has not occurred since 1806). Normally, the Lord Chancellor presided during trials; when a peer is accused of high treason, however, the Lord High Steward must preside. By convention, however, the Lord Chancellor would be appointed Lord High Steward for the duration of the trial—the post of Lord High Steward ceased to be regularly filled in 1421, being revived only for trials of peers and for coronations.

Finally, it was possible for Parliament to pass an Act of attainder, which pronounces guilt without a trial. Historically, Acts of attainder have been used against political opponents when speedy executions were desired. In 1661, Parliament passed acts posthumously attainting Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton and John Bradshaw—who were previously involved in Charles I&#x27;s trial—of treason. These three individuals were posthumously executed, the only people to suffer this fate under English treason laws. (In 1540, a Scottish court summoned Robert Leslie, who was deceased, for a trial for treason. The Estates-General declared the summons lawful; Leslie&#x27;s body was exhumed, and his bones were presented at the bar of the court. This procedure was never used in England.)

==Procedure and evidence==

===Before 1945===
Certain special rules procedures have historically applied to high treason cases. The privilege of the peerage and parliamentary privilege preclude the arrest of certain individuals (including peers, wives and widows of peers and members of Parliament) in many cases, but treason was not included (nor were felony or breach of the peace). Similarly, an individual could not claim sanctuary when charged with high treason; this distinction between treasons and felonies was lost as sanctuary laws were repealed in the late 17th and early 19th century. The defendant, furthermore, could not claim the benefit of clergy in treason cases; but the benefit of the clergy, as well, was abolished during the 19th century.

Formerly, if an individual stood mute and refused to plead guilty or not guilty for a felony, he would be tortured until he enter a plea; if he died in the course of the torture, his lands would not be seized to the Crown, and his heirs would be allowed to succeed to them. In cases of high treason, however, an individual could not save his lands by refusing to enter a plea; instead, a refusal would be punished by immediate forfeiture of all estates. This distinction between treasons and felonies ended in 1772, when the court was permitted to enter a plea on a defendant&#x27;s behalf.

Formerly, an individual was not entitled to assistance of counsel in any capital case, including treason; the rule, however, was abolished in treason cases by the Treason Act 1695. The same Act extended a rule from 1661 which had made it necessary to produce at least two witnesses to prove each alleged offence of high treason. Nearly one hundred years later a stricter version of this rule was incorporated into the Constitution of the United States. The 1695 Act also provided for a three-year time limit on bringing prosecutions for treason (except for assassinating the king) and misprision of treason, another rule which has been imitated in some common law countries.

These rules made it difficult to prosecute charges of treason, and the rule was relaxed by the Treason Act 1800 to make attempts on the life of the King subject to the same rules of procedure and evidence as existed in murder trials (which did not require two witnesses). This change was extended to all assaults on the Sovereign by section 1 of the Treason Act 1842. Finally the special rules for treason were abolished by the Treason Act 1945 when the rules of evidence and procedure in all cases of treason were made the same as for murder. However, the original three-year time limit stated above survived into the present day. This meant that when James Hewitt was accused of treason by the tabloid press in 1996 because of his affair with the Princess of Wales, he could not have been prosecuted because it could not be proved that he had done it within the foregoing three-year period.

===Modern procedure===
The procedure in trials for treason is the same as that in trials for murder. It is therefore an indictable-only offence.

===Alternative verdict===
England and Wales
On the trial of an indictment for treason, the jury cannot return an alternative verdict to the offence charged in that indictment under section 6(3) of the Criminal Law Act 1967. For example, the jury cannot give an alternative verdict of manslaughter in cases of the assassination of the monarch. The Homicide Act 1957 does not apply. However, under the common law the jury may return a verdict of guilty of misprision of treason instead of treason.

Northern Ireland
On the trial of an indictment for treason, the jury cannot return an alternative verdict to the offence charged in that indictment under section 6(2) of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967.

===Limitation===
A person may not be indicted for treason committed within the United Kingdom (subject to the following exception) unless the indictment is preferred within three years of the commission of that offence. This limitation does not apply to treason which consists of designing, endeavouring or attempting to assassinate the sovereign. There is no time limit on the prosecution of treason committed outside of the United Kingdom.

The same time limit applies to attempting or conspiring to commit treason.

===Bail===
In England and Wales, a person charged with treason may not be granted bail except by order of a High Court judge or of the Secretary of State. The same rule applies in Northern Ireland.

In Scotland, all crimes and offences which are treason are bailable.

==Punishment==

===Before 1998===
The form of execution once suffered by traitors was often (though not invariably) torturous. For men the statutory penalty (in England) was to be hanged, drawn and quartered. The condemned could not walk or be carried to the place of execution; the sentence required that they were to be drawn: they might be dragged along the ground, but were normally tied onto a hurdle which was drawn to the place of execution by a horse. A man would then be hanged by a noose around the neck until almost dead. Whilst still alive, he would be cut down and allowed to drop to the ground, stripped of his clothes, his genitals cut off, his viscera pulled out and burnt before his own eyes, and other organs would be torn out of his body. The body would be decapitated, and cut into four-quarters. The body parts would be at the disposal of the Sovereign, and generally they would be gibbeted or publicly displayed as a warning. The body parts would be parboiled in salt and cumin seed: the salt to prevent putrefaction, and the cumin seed to prevent birds pecking at the flesh. This sentence was amended in 1814 so that the offender would hang until dead; the disembowelling, beheading and quartering were to be carried out posthumously.

Women were excluded from this type of punishment and instead were drawn and then burned at the stake, until this was replaced with hanging by the Treason Act 1790 and the Treason by Women Act (Ireland) 1796.

The penalty for high treason by counterfeiting or clipping coins was the same as the penalty for petty treason (which for men was drawing and hanging without the torture and quartering, and for women was burning or hanging.)

Individuals of noble birth were beheaded without being subjected to either form of torture. Commoners&#x27; sentences were sometimes commuted to beheading—a sentence not formally removed from British law until 1973.

In addition to being tortured and executed, a traitor was also deemed &quot;attainted&quot;. The first consequence of attainder was forfeiture; all lands and estates of a traitor were forever forfeit to the Crown. A second consequence was corruption of blood; the attainted person could neither inherit property, nor transmit it to his or her descendants.

In 1832 the death penalty was abolished for treason by forging seals and the royal sign manual.

In 1870, attainder was abolished. In the same year in England, and in 1949 in Scotland, posthumous drawing and quartering was abolished, and so the sole punishment was hanging.

Beheading was abolished in 1973, by which time it had long been obsolete, having last been used in 1747.

By 1965, capital punishment had been abolished for almost all crimes, but was still mandatory (unless the offender was pardoned or the sentence commuted) for high treason until 1998. By section 36 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 the maximum punishment for high treason became life imprisonment. &quot;(See also Treason Act 1814.)&quot;

===Today===
A person convicted of treason is liable to imprisonment for life or for any shorter term. A whole life tariff may be imposed for the gravest offences. (See Life imprisonment in England and Wales for more details).

Treason also entails disqualification from public office, and loss of suffrage (except in local elections). This rule does not apply in Scotland.

==Scottish Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly==
Treason (including constructive treason) is a reserved matter on which the Scottish Parliament cannot legislate.

Treason (but not powers of arrest or criminal procedure) is an excepted matter on which the Northern Ireland Assembly cannot legislate.

==Treason today==
Almost all treason-related offences introduced since the Treason Act 1351 was passed have been abolished or relegated to lesser offences. The Treason Act 1351, on the other hand, has not been significantly amended; the main changes involve the removal of counterfeiting and forgery, as explained above. For the state of the law today, see the &quot;Offences&quot; section above.

In Autumn 2001, following 9/11, the British government threatened British citizens who fought for the Taliban army in Afghanistan against Anglo-American troops with prosecution for treason, although no one was subsequently tried, at least not for treason.

On 8 August 2005, it was reported that the UK Government was considering bringing prosecutions for treason against a number of British Islamic clerics who have publicly spoken positively about acts of terrorism against civilians in Britain, or attacks on British soldiers abroad, including the 7 July London bombings and numerous attacks on troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Following this threat one foreign cleric who the British government had failed to deport fled to Lebanon, only to request to be rescued by the British military during the 2006 Israel–Hezbollah War. However, later that year prosecutors indicted Abu Hamza al-Masri for inciting murder (he was convicted in February 2006).

In 2008, the former attorney-general, Lord Goldsmith KC, published a report on his review of British citizenship. One of his recommendations was for a &quot;thorough reform and rationalisation of the law&quot; of treason.

In 2014, the Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, revealed that the British Government was considering high treason charges for Islamic extremists in response to growing numbers of British fighters travelling to Syria and Iraq to join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. However, this did not come to pass.

On 2 August 2022, Jaswant Singh Chail was charged with offences under section 2 of the Treason Act 1842, and also with making threats to kill and possessing an offensive weapon, a crossbow. He had been arrested in the grounds of Windsor Castle on 25 December, 2021 and was charged with &quot;discharging or aiming firearms, or throwing or using any offensive matter or weapon, with intent to injure or alarm her Majesty&quot;. On 3 February 2023, he pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey, and, on 5 October 2023, he was sentenced to a total of nine years imprisonment for the three offences (including 44 months for the Treason Act offence), with an additional five years on extended licence. Chail was the first person since 1981 to be convicted of an offence under a Treason Act. He was widely reported by the media to have been convicted of treason, but the offence under section 2 is not treason but a lesser offence (&quot;a high misdemeanour&quot;) which has a maximum sentence of seven years (the name of the 1842 act is because section 1, now repealed, was about treason).

<text>David Anthony Laws (born 30 November 1965) is a British politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Yeovil from 2001 to 2015. A member of the Liberal Democrats, in his third parliament he served at the outset as a Cabinet Minister, in 2010, as Chief Secretary to the Treasury; as well as later concurrently as Minister of State for Schools and Minister Assisting the Deputy Prime Minister – an office where he worked cross-departmentally on implementing the coalition agreement in policies - from 2012 to 2015.

After a career in investment banking, Laws became an economic adviser and later Director of Policy and Research for his party. In 2001, he was elected as MP for Yeovil, succeeding former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown. In 2004, he co-edited &quot;The Orange Book: Reclaiming Liberalism&quot;, followed by &quot;Britain After Blair&quot; in 2006. After the 2010 general election, Laws was a senior party negotiator in the coalition agreement which underpinned the party&#x27;s parliamentary five-year coalition government with the Conservative Party.

He held the office of Chief Secretary to the Treasury for 17 days before resigning owing to the disclosure of his parliamentary expenses claims, described by the Parliamentary Standards and Privileges Committee as &quot;a series of serious breaches of the rules, over a considerable period of time&quot;, albeit unintended; the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found &quot;no evidence that [he] made his claims with the intention of benefiting himself or his partner in conscious breach of the rules.&quot; His was among the six cabinet resignations during the expenses scandal; he was suspended from Parliament for seven days by vote of the House of Commons. In the 2012 cabinet reshuffle, he attended cabinet as Minister of State for School Standards and Minister Assisting the Deputy Prime Minister. He was unseated by Conservative nominee Marcus Fysh in the 2015 general election.

==Early life and education==
Laws was born in Farnham, Surrey, son of a Conservative-voting father who was a banker, and a Labour-voting mother. He has an older brother and a younger sister, both adopted.

Laws was educated at fee-paying independent schools: Woburn Hill School in the town of Weybridge, Surrey, from 1974 to 1979; and St George&#x27;s College, Weybridge, a Roman Catholic day school in the same town, from 1979 to 1984. Regarded as a skilled speaker in intellectual argument, he won the national Observer Schools Mace Debating Championship in 1984.

Laws graduated in 1987 from King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, with a double first in economics.

==Career==
Laws went into investment banking, becoming a Vice President at JP Morgan from 1987 to 1992 and then a Managing Director, being the Head of US Dollar and Sterling Treasuries at Barclays de Zoete Wedd.

He left in 1994, to take up the role of economic adviser to the Liberal Democrats, on a salary of £15,000 (). He unsuccessfully contested Folkestone and Hythe in 1997 against Home Secretary Michael Howard (Conservative). From 1997 to 1999 he was the Liberal Democrats&#x27; Director of Policy and Research.

Following the 1999 Scottish Parliament election, Laws played a leading advisory role in the negotiation of the Scottish Parliament coalition agreement with Labour, being the party&#x27;s Policy Director.

==Parliamentary career==

Laws had joined the Liberal Democrats back office at the same time as Nick Clegg while the party was led by Paddy Ashdown. When Ashdown resigned the leadership of the party and then decided to stand down as an MP, Laws was selected for his seat. Both would walk the constituency in what former Royal Marine Ashdown described as mufti attire; but on election day, Laws wore tailored suits.

After his election to parliament, Laws became a member of the Treasury Committee, and he was appointed the party&#x27;s deputy Defence spokesman in November 2001. In 2002, he became his party&#x27;s Treasury spokesman and issued an alternative spending review.

He was the co-editor of the &quot;Orange Book&quot;, published in 2004 in so doing creating the term Orange Book liberalism. In 2005, he was appointed the Liberal Democrats&#x27; Work and Pensions spokesman, a position in which he was critical of the government&#x27;s handling of the Child Support Agency and flaws in the tax credits system. He was subsequently the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Children, Schools and Families. He wrote a lesser-selling book in 2006, &quot;Britain After Blair&quot;.

Shadow Chancellor George Osborne offered Laws a seat in the Conservative Shadow Cabinet, but was rebuffed, with Laws saying &quot;I am not a Tory, and if I merely wanted a fast track to a top job, I would have acted on this instinct a long time ago.&quot; Following the resignation of Sir Menzies Campbell on 15 October 2007, Laws announced that he would not be a candidate for the leadership of the party.

===Government===
Following the 2010 general election, Laws was one of four negotiators for the Liberal Democrats who negotiated a deal to go into a governing coalition with the Conservatives. His account of the coalition&#x27;s formation was published in November 2010 as &quot;22 Days in May&quot;.

Laws was one of five Liberal Democrats to obtain Cabinet positions when the coalition was formed, becoming Chief Secretary to the Treasury, tasked with cutting spending and increasing tax take without increasing rates of taxation to eliminate the national deficit. He was appointed as a Privy Counsellor on 13 May 2010.

Laws&#x27;s predecessor Liam Byrne, wrote a note to his successor as Chief Secretary to the Treasury which read &quot;Dear Chief Secretary, I&#x27;m afraid there is no money. Kind regards - and good luck! Liam&quot;. Byrne said the letter was meant as a private joke but Laws published it, slightly misquoting it (from memory) at a press briefing as &quot;I&#x27;m afraid to tell you there&#x27;s no money left&quot;. Looking back in 2013 he said that he had thought the note was a joke but that he felt it was in poor taste given the poor state of the economy. He had not expected the revelation of the contents of the note to be taken as significantly as it was.

Outlining spending cuts in May 2010, Laws said Child Trust Fund payments would be axed by January 2011. He said halting these payments to newborns from the end of the year – and the top-up payments – would save £520m. Mr Laws said: &quot;The years of public sector plenty are over, but the more decisively we act the quicker and stronger we can come through these tough times.&quot; He said that &quot;We also promise to cut with care, we are going to be a progressive government even in these tough times&quot;. Iain Martin of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published an article on Laws&#x27;s early performance and described him as a &quot;potential future prime minister&quot;

===Expenses scandal, resignation and suspension from Parliament===

On 28 May 2010, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; disclosed that Laws had claimed more than £40,000 on his expenses in the form of second home costs, from 2004 to late 2009, during which time he had been renting rooms at properties owned by what the newspaper claimed to be his &quot;secret lover&quot; and &quot;long-term partner&quot;, James Lundie. They were not in a civil partnership. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; had not intended to reveal his sexuality, but Laws himself did so, in a public statement shortly before the newspaper&#x27;s publication of the story. Lundie is a former Liberal Democrat Press officer and now works for the Political Affairs team of public relations and lobbying firm, Edelman.

Laws misclaimed second home allowances of between £700 and £950 a month rent between 2006 and 2007, plus typically £100 to £200 a month for maintenance, to rent a room in a flat as the flat was owned and lived in by Lundie (in Kennington, south London). Lundie replaced his property with a house in 2007. Laws then recovered from the second home allowance the rent for its &quot;second bedroom&quot; at £920 a month, until September 2009. Laws afterwards rented another flat not owned by Lundie, who remained at the Kennington house. Since 2006 the relevant rules banned MPs from &quot;leasing accommodation from... a partner.&quot; He claimed small amounts in respect of his main home in Chard in his constituency and holiday home in Provence, France.

Laws resigned as Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 29 May 2010, stating that he could not carry on working on the Comprehensive Spending Review while dealing with the private and public implications of the revelations. He claimed that his reason for the way he had claimed expenses had been to keep private details of his sexuality and that he had not benefited financially from this misdirection.

In May 2011 the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards reported to the Standards and Privileges Committee on the investigation into his conduct. The Committee concluded that Laws was guilty of breaking six rules with regard to expenses. The Commissioner reported that none of the claims for the London properties was acceptable under the rules but that he had not intended to benefit himself or Lundie directly. In addition to finding against Laws with regard to the payment of rent to his friend, the investigation also found irregularities in phone bill and building work expenses. The Committee concluded that &quot;... the rental agreements submitted [by Laws] between 2003 and 2008 were misleading and designed to conceal the nature of the relationship. They prevented any examination of the arrangements that in fact pertained over the entire period&quot;. Further, his claims for rent were in excess of market levels for a lodging agreement and a market-level agreement would not have included contributions from the lodger towards building repairs and maintenance which were claimed. The Committee concluded that it was inappropriate to judge whether the claims on a particular property were appropriate by reference to potential payments on another property, which was not in fact claimed for.

The commissioner stated &quot;I have no evidence that Mr Laws made his claims with the intention of benefiting himself or his partner in conscious breach of the rules.&quot;

Being found in unintended breach, Laws was suspended from the House of Commons for seven days by a House of Commons vote on 16 May 2011. Laws gave costed estimates to the investigation showing his expenses could have been almost £30,000 higher over 2004–2010 if renting or claiming mortgage payments on his Somerset home which he owned outright. Olly Grender, journalist and former party Communications Director echoed this argument an article in 2011 in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; stressing that &quot;If he had allocated his constituency home as his second home he would have still been in the cabinet, having claimed £30,000 more&quot;.

The Committee mentioned the conduct of Laws after May 2010, stating: &quot;We have also considered whether there needs to be a stronger sanction than repayments. Not only has Mr Laws already resigned from the Cabinet, his behaviour since May 2010 has been exemplary. He quickly referred himself to the Commissioner, has already repaid allowances from July 2006 in full, and has cooperated fully with the Commissioner&#x27;s investigation&quot;. The Committee&#x27;s conclusion was however that a stronger sanction than repayment was indeed needed. This led to the vote temporarily excluding Laws from the House of Commons.

===Return to government===
Laws returned to Government as Minister of State for Schools in the Department for Education and Minister of State in the Cabinet Office in September 2012. He was permitted to attend Cabinet, not as a full member but because of his strategic portfolio. He was also responsible for implementation of the coalition agreement and contributed to Liberal Democrat strategy in the run-up to the 2015 election.

===Post-parliamentary career===
Laws lost his seat in the 2015 General Election and declined an offer to be seated in the House of Lords. When CentreForum was rebranded and refocused in 2016 as the Education Policy Institute, Laws was hired to lead it.

==Political views==
In initial debates on the spending cuts, Conservative MP for Gainsborough, Edward Leigh described Laws as heeding to &quot;stern, unbending Gladstonian Liberalism&quot;. Laws added that he believed in &quot;not only Gladstonian Liberalism, but liberalism tinged with the social liberalism about which my party is so passionate.&quot;

Around the time of the 2010 general election, it was alleged that Laws told a Conservative colleague that he would have become a Conservative politician had it not been for the Tory party&#x27;s general &quot;illiberalism and Euroscepticism&quot; and particularly the Thatcher government&#x27;s introduction of Section 28, which forbade local authorities from &quot;promot[ing] homosexuality&quot;. According to former MP Evan Harris, one of Laws&#x27;s former colleagues, &quot;Laws is a fully social liberal on equality, abortion, faith schools, religion and the state. He is also very sensible on discrimination issues and sex education&quot;; another, Malcolm Bruce described Laws as &quot;an unreconstructed 19th-century Liberal. He believes in free trade and small government. Government should do the job only government can do. There&#x27;s no point in having [a] large public sector if the users of the public services are getting poorer.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
Laws was portrayed by actor Richard Teverson in the 2015 Channel 4 television film &quot;Coalition&quot;.

<doc id="427597" wikidata="Q264116" url="?curid=427597" title="Steve Webb">
<text>Sir Steven John Webb (born 18 July 1965) is a British pensions commentator who was previously Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament (MP) for Northavon from 1997 to 2010 and for Thornbury and Yate from 2010 to 2015. He was the Minister of State for Pensions in the coalition government of David Cameron.

==Background==
Webb was born in Birmingham to Brian and Patricia Webb, and attended the local comprehensive school, Dartmouth High School, before going on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Hertford College, Oxford. He then worked at the Institute for Fiscal Studies in London, where he specialised in researching into poverty, taxes and benefits. In 1995, he became a professor of social policy at the University of Bath.

==Political career==
At the 1997 general election, Webb was elected as MP for Northavon, just north of Bristol, overturning a Conservative majority of over 11,000. He increased a 2,137 majority to 9,877 in the 2001 election and again to 11,033 in the 2005 election.

In 2001, Webb was promoted by Charles Kennedy to lead spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats on Work and Pensions, a portfolio he had worked in since 1999. He continued in this position until being appointed as Liberal Democrat Health spokesperson in 2005. At the end of 2006, he started a new role co-ordinating the party&#x27;s manifesto for the next general election. In the first reshuffle after the leadership election, he was appointed Liberal Democrat Environment, Energy, Food and Rural Affairs spokesman. Following Gordon Brown&#x27;s reshuffle in October 2008, he shadowed Ed Miliband in the newly formed Department for Energy and Climate Change. On 8 January 2009 Nick Clegg announced his &quot;General Election Team&quot; and an &quot;economic recovery group&quot; with Webb appointed as Work and Pensions spokesman.

Webb was also a member of the cross-party Christians in Parliament, and vice-president of the Liberal Democrat Christian Forum. He was one of the first MPs to have a blog and a website, and in 2004, his website, which made use of SMS technology, was commended in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; New Media Awards and, in February 2005, led him to win the inaugural Hansard Society E-Democracy Award. He also recognised the emerging potential of online social networks by joining Myspace and Facebook, two of the biggest social media websites at the time. He was one of the contributors to the &quot;Orange Book&quot; (2004) and is the author of a chapter in &quot;The Future of the NHS&quot;.

Given his increasing profile and popularity within the party due to his role as the manifesto chair, he was seen as a probable candidate for the social liberal grouping&#x27;s vote in the future leadership election. Simon Hughes had been the previous &#x27;standard bearer&#x27; in the leadership elections in 1999 and 2006. On 17 October 2007, the website Bloggers4Steve announced that Webb had received enough nominations from MPs to run. Despite this, on 18 October, Webb announced he was not running, and would be backing Nick Clegg for leader, who was ultimately the successful candidate.

At the 2010 general election, the constituency of Northavon was split into two new constituencies. Subsequently, Webb was elected for the new Thornbury and Yate constituency, which covers most of the ground originally covered by Northavon.

In a letter dated 12 April 2010, Webb said on behalf of the Liberal Democrats: &quot;We are very clear that all accrued rights should be honoured: a pension promise made should be a pension promise kept. Therefore we would not make any changes to pension rights that have already been built up. I have confirmed that I regard accrued index-linked rights as protected.&quot; However, in July 2010, as the Coalition Minister for Works and Pensions, Webb announced plans to link private sector pension payments to the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) instead of the Retail Prices Index (RPI), which would reduce the value of fully accrued index-linked pensions.

As Pensions Minister in the Coalition government, Webb led major changes to the pensions system. The pensions &#x27;triple-lock&#x27; guarantees that the state pension rises each year by the highest of inflation, earnings or 2.5%. One year this resulted in the highest ever cash increase in the state pension, and saw pensioners who were receiving the full state pension £380 a year better off.

In Autumn 2012, auto-enrolment was introduced for large businesses in the UK, being rolled out to smaller businesses over the next four years. Auto-enrolment automatically enrols employees into a contributory pension scheme, unless they opt out. Estimates suggest that 600,000 people were auto-enrolled by the end of 2013, and that by 2014, £11M per year would be added to the total UK investment in pensions,

Webb attracted media attention in March 2014, when he remarked in a television interview that due to the coalition government&#x27;s pension reforms, he was relaxed if pensioners wanted to spend their savings on a Lamborghini.

In the May 2015 general election, he lost his seat to the Conservative Luke Hall.

==Subsequent career==
Webb was knighted in the 2017 New Year Honours.

In August 2015, it was announced Webb was becoming director of policy and external communications at the financial services mutual Royal London. Parliamentary rules prevented Webb from direct political lobbying for the first two years. In 2020, Webb left Royal London to take up a partner role at the consultancy Lane Clark and Peacock.

A freedom of information inquiry tabled by Webb in 2020 revealed that a large number of women were being paid state pensions below the expected rate. Some 200,000 women could now be in line for payouts averaging £13,500 to top-up the underpayment of their state pension.

==Personal life==
On 10 July 1993, Webb married Helen, a curate at his local church in Clapham, south London. A year later, the couple moved to Bristol; they have two children.

<text>The swamp sparrow (Melospiza georgiana) is a medium-sized New World sparrow related to the song sparrow.

== Description ==
Measurements:

* Length: 4.7–5.9 in (12–15 cm)
* Weight: 0.5–0.8 oz (15–23 g)
* Wingspan: 7.1–7.5 in (18–19 cm)

Adults have streaked rusty, buff and black upperparts with an unstreaked gray breast, light belly and a white throat. The wings are strikingly rusty. Most males and a few females have rust-colored caps. Their face is gray with a dark line through the eye. They have a short bill and fairly long legs. Immature birds and winter adults usually have two brown crown stripes and much of the gray is replaced with buff.
==Distribution and habitat==
Swamp sparrows breed across the northern United States and boreal Canada. The southern edge of their breeding range coincides largely with the Line of Maximum Glaciation. A small number of morphologically distinct birds inhabit tidal marshes from northern Virginia to the Hudson River Estuary. This subspecies (&quot;M. g. nigrescens&quot;) winters in coastal marshes of the Carolinas and differs from the two inland swamp sparrow subspecies in having more black in a grayer overall plumage, larger bill, different songs, and a smaller average clutch size.

Their breeding habitat is marshes, including brackish marshes, across eastern North America and central Canada. The bulky nest is attached to marsh vegetation, often just above the ground or surface of the water with leaves or grass arching over the top. The female builds a new nest each year and lays an average of four eggs per clutch. Females give a series of chips as they leave the nest, probably to ward off attacks by their mate or neighboring males.

While swamp sparrows can be found year-round in small numbers on the southern edge of their breeding range, individuals are probably all migratory, primarily migrating to the southeastern United States.
==Diet==
Swamp sparrows generally forage on the ground near the water&#x27;s edge, in shallow water or in marsh vegetation. In winter, their diet is principally fruit and seeds, while during the breeding season their diet is mainly arthropods.
==Call==
The song of the swamp sparrow is a monotone trill, slower than that of the chipping sparrow. A male can have a repertoire of several different trills. The common call note is a loud chip reminiscent of a phoebe. 
This bird&#x27;s numbers have declined due to habitat loss in some parts of its range.

<text>A field desk is a portable desk which is meant to be used in rear areas near a battlefield and moved around rather frequently in difficult conditions. It is in contrast to the campaign desk, which is usually heavier and meant for areas further in the rear.
The field desk is both an antique and a modern desk form. The antique form is usually made of fine woods and brass fittings. The smaller versions can often be confused with the civilian writing slope. This is quite understandable, because during the 18th and 19th centuries they were often used interchangeably. There is a wide variety of antique field desks, ranging from small suitcase-sized ones to fairly big chests, like the one general Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson used during the American Civil War in the United States. Until recently, General Jackson&#x27;s desk was exhibited in the museum of the Virginia Military Institute (VMI). At one point, VMI gave a licence to a furniture manufacturer to produce copies of the desk, available on the web. 

The field desk was a civil war officers &quot;office in a box.&quot; This portable, upright desk has a drop-down front used for a writing surface.

The most common modern field desk is made of resistant plastic composites and steel or aluminium. It is built to NATO standards or to the standards of national armies. There are several variants, but the most common one is a nearly cubic chest whose lid is removed to expose internal drawers and then reattached on the side to serve as a desktop.

<doc id="427608" wikidata="Q7405184" url="?curid=427608" title="Sally Keeble">
<text>Sally Curtis Keeble (born 13 October 1951) is a British Labour Party politician. She was the member of parliament (MP) for Northampton North from the 1997 to 2010 general elections, when she lost her seat to the Conservative Party candidate Michael Ellis. She had previously been Leader of Southwark Council from 1990 to 1993. Keeble stood as Labour&#x27;s candidate for her former constituency in the three elections following her 2010 defeat, losing on all three occasions to Ellis.

==Early life==
Keeble went to the independent Cheltenham Ladies&#x27; College, and later attended St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford, gaining a BA degree in theology in 1973, and a BA in sociology from the University of South Africa in 1981. Her father was the British diplomat Sir Curtis Keeble, a former ambassador to East Germany and the USSR. Before entering Parliament, she was a journalist in South Africa for the &quot;Daily News&quot; in Durban from 1973 to 1979 and then in Birmingham for the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot; from 1978 to 1983. She then worked for the Labour Party as a Press Officer at Labour Headquarters from 1983 to 1984, then the Inner London Education Authority where she was assistant director for External Relations from 1984 to 1986, and was Head of Communications for the GMB trade union from 1986 to 1990 before becoming a full-time council leader in Inner London. She was a public affairs consultant from 1995 to 1997.

==Parliamentary career==
In 1995, Keeble was selected to stand for the Labour Party in Northampton North through an all-women shortlist.

Keeble served on the Agriculture Select Committee (before its abolition in 2001), and became Parliamentary Private Secretary to Rt. Hon Hilary Armstrong in 1999. After the 2001 general election she was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions, where her responsibilities included planning, regeneration, housing and local transport. She chaired the taskforce on parks and urban green spaces. In 2002, she moved to the Department for International Development. In 2003, she left the frontbench. From 2005, she was a member of the Treasury Select Committee.

Keeble introduced a private members bill to introduce the offence of causing death by careless driving: the measure was later accepted by the Government and introduced in the Road Safety Act 2006. She also introduced ten-minute rule bills on flooding, and a bill on minimum pricing for alcohol.

Keeble was involved in the 2009 United Kingdom Parliamentary Expenses scandal claiming £4,112 for windows at her Northampton house under the second home allowance, £3,072 for a new boiler and £950 for essential maintenance on the bathroom at her Northampton home.

At the 2010 general election, Keeble lost her Northampton North seat by 1,937 votes to the Conservative Party candidate Michael Ellis, a swing of 6.9% from the previous election.

At the 2019 United Kingdom general election Keeble failed to regain her Northampton North seat. The Conservative candidate Michael Ellis increased his majority to 5,507, a swing of 6% from the previous election, to hold his seat in Northampton North.

Keeble has stood as the Labour candidate at every general election between 1997 and 2019.

==Personal life==
Keeble married Andrew Hilary Porter on 9 June 1990 in Camberwell; the couple have a son and daughter together. She is an honorary fellow of South Bank University.

Her sister, Jane Mahoney, and her brother-in law Anthony; were killed on 12 July 1998 near Darwin in Australia. A Hells Angel motorcyclist had ploughed into them whilst they were waiting by the roadside after Anthony changed a wheel. The Hell&#x27;s Angel carried on driving and failed to report the accident. After the accident, her father, Sir Curtis Keeble, the former British ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1978 to 1982 and governor of the BBC, had a heart attack.

<text>Natalia Ivanovna Sedova (, ; 5 April 1882 – 23 January 1962) was a Russian revolutionary and author known as the second wife of Leon Trotsky. She wrote on cultural matters pertaining to Marxism.

== Life ==
She was born in to the family of a wealthy merchant. Her father was of Cossack origins and her mother was from the Polish nobility. Sedova studied at the Kharkov Institute for Noble Maidens, from where she was expelled for participating in the revolutionary movement. 

Natalia met Leon Trotsky in late 1902, after his escape from Siberia. His first wife Aleksandra Sokolovskaya had remained behind, with their two daughters, and they were divorced soon thereafter. Natalia and Trotsky married in 1903. They had two children together, Lev Sedov (24 February 1906 – 16 February 1938) and Sergei Sedov (21 March 1908 – 29 October 1937), both of whom would predecease their parents. Trotsky later explained that after the 1917 revolution:
 However he never used the name &quot;Sedov&quot; either privately or publicly. Natalia Sedova sometimes signed her name &quot;Sedova-Trotskaya.&quot; Trotsky and his first wife Aleksandra maintained a friendly relationship after their divorce. She disappeared in 1935 during the Great Purges and was murdered by Stalinist forces three years later.

Lev Sedov was an active and leading member of the Bolshevik-Leninist movement that his father led and was almost certainly assassinated as a result of that. Her other son, Sergei Sedov, who was not politically active and remained in Russia, was almost certainly murdered by agents of Joseph Stalin.

After her husband&#x27;s assassination in 1940, Natalia Sedova remained in Mexico and maintained contact with many exiled revolutionaries. Her best-known work in these last years was a biography of Trotsky, which she co-authored with fellow Russian revolutionary Victor Serge. She was also close to the Spanish revolutionary Grandizo Munis who had led the tiny Spanish Sección Bolchevique-Leninista during the revolutionary events in the 1930s. Under his influence, she came to adopt the position that the USSR was state capitalist and that the Fourth International founded by Trotsky no longer held to the revolutionary programme of Communism. Therefore, she broke from the FI in 1951.

<text>The University of Basel (Latin: &quot;Universitas Basiliensis&quot;, German: &quot;Universität Basel&quot;) is a public research university in Basel, Switzerland. Founded on 4 April 1460, it is Switzerland&#x27;s oldest university and among the world&#x27;s oldest surviving universities. The university is traditionally counted among the leading institutions of higher learning in the country.

The associated Basel University Library is the largest and among the most important libraries in Switzerland. The university hosts the faculties of theology, law, medicine, humanities and social sciences, science, psychology, and business and economics, as well as numerous cross-disciplinary subjects and institutes, such as the Biozentrum for biomedical research and the Institute for European Global Studies. In 2020, the university had 13,139 students and 378 professors. International students accounted for 27 percent of the student body.

In its over 500-year history, the university has been home to Erasmus of Rotterdam, Paracelsus, Daniel Bernoulli, Leonhard Euler, Jacob Burckhardt, Friedrich Nietzsche, Tadeusz Reichstein, Karl Jaspers, Carl Gustav Jung, Karl Barth, and Jeanne Hersch. The institution is associated with ten Nobel laureates and two presidents of the Swiss Confederation.

==History==
The University of Basel was founded in connection with the Council of Basel. It was during the years the catholic clergy resided in Basel, a temporary university was established between the years 1432 und 1448. In May 1432 it was authorized for Simon de Valla from Venice to lecture on canon law, in 1434 Jacques d&#x27;Attigny from France and was also permitted to lecture on canon law in Basel. d&#x27;Attigny had before been lecturing canon law at the University of Rome. In 1437 Demetrius was called to lecture Greek language. Also the function of a bedel is mentioned, but there was no mention of a dean or a University order. The same year Pope Eugen IV attempted to move the council to Ferrara, but many involved in Basel stayed and kept negotiating and in 1439 the council elected a counterpope in the figure of the Duke of Savoy Amadeus VIII who would become known as Felix V. Felix V then established a formal &quot;University of the Clergy&quot; (German:&quot;Kurienuniversität)&quot; which was inaugurated in November 1440 with a mass in the . In 1448, the German King Frederick III came to an agreement with Pope Nicholas V, the successor of Eugen IV and ordered the city to remove the security of the councilors. The university was then formally closed in July 1448 and the clergy moved on to Lausanne. After they left, the former lecturers urged for a regular university to be established. The deed of foundation given in the form of a Papal bull by Pope Pius II on 12 November 1459 in Mantua and the official opening ceremony was held on 4 April 1460, the day of Saint Ambrose in the Minster of Basel. Originally the University of Basel was decreed to have four faculties—arts, medicine, theology, and jurisprudence. From 1497, the Grand Council of Basel discussed whether the University was to be closed and only in 1501, the year Basel joined the Swiss Confederation, it was decided not to close the university. The faculty of arts served until 1818 as the foundation for the other three academic subjects. In the eighteenth century as Basel became more commercial, the university, one of the centres of learning in the Renaissance, slipped into insignificance. Enrollment which had been over a thousand around 1600, dropped to sixty in 1785 with eighteen professors. The professors themselves were mostly sons of the elite.

Over the course of centuries as many scholars came to the city, Basel became an early centre of book printing and humanism. Around the same time as the university itself, the Basel University Library was founded. Today it has over three million books and writings and is the largest library in Switzerland.

Located in what was once a politically volatile area, the university&#x27;s fate often ebbed and flowed with regional political developments, including the Reformation, the Kantonstrennung (separation of the Canton of Basel City from Basel Land), and both World Wars. These factors affected student attendance, funding, university-government relations. In 1833 the Canton of Basel split in two with the Federal Diet requiring that the canton&#x27;s assets, including the books at the university library, be divided—two-thirds going to the new half canton of Basel-Landschaft. The city, Basel-Stadt, had to buy back this share and the university became so impoverished that it drastically reduced its course offerings. Students were expected to continue their education after two years or so at a German university.

Student enrollment surged after the university shed its medieval curriculum (including the elimination of Latin as the official language of the course catalog in 1822) and began to add more faculties, especially those in the humanities and sciences. Liberal Arts became a faculty in 1818, from which the Philosophy and History and Natural History faculties were derived in 1937. The university subsequently established the Faculty of Science (1937), the Faculty of Business and Economics (1996), and the Faculty of Psychology (2003). During the 20th century, the university grew rapidly, from one thousand students in 1918 to eight thousand in 1994. The first woman who was admitted to the university, , began her medical studies in 1890.

After the seizure of power in the year 1933 by the Nazis in Germany, numerous renowned German professors decided to emigrate to Basel and started to work at the University of Basel. Several Swiss scholars also returned, inter alia the Law Professor Arthur Baumgarten (1933), the Theologians Karl Barth (1935) and (1937) and after World War II the Philosopher Karl Jaspers from Heidelberg University (1948), as well as the surgeon Rudolf Nissen (1952).

On 1 January 1996, the University of Basel became independent from the cantonal government and thus earned its right to self-government. In 2007, the Canton of Basel-Landschaft voted in favor to share the sponsorship of the university in parity with the Canton Basel-Stadt.

=== Seal ===
Since 1460, the seal of the University showed a Virgin surrounded with sun rays standing a crescent moon as mentioned in the Revelation of John. Below the moon is the coat of arms of Basel. In her right hand, she holds a scepter, and on her left arm sits Jesus the child. The religious motive is described to denote the religious bond the university counted with at the beginning of its existence. The seal was also used after the reformation and used continuously until 1992.

==Organization==
===University administration===
Since 1 January 1996, the University of Basel has been independent. The University Law of 1995 stipulates that, &quot;The University of Basel is an institution established under public law. It has its own legal personality and right to self-government.&quot; As the entity that formally receives the Performance Mandate (Leistungsauftrag) for the University from both supporting cantons, the University Council (Universitätsrat) is the supreme decision-making body of the university. The Council consists of eleven voting members and three non-voting members, including the President, the Executive Director, and the Secretary of the Council.
Beneath the University Council are the Senate (Regenz) and the President&#x27;s Board. The 80-member Senate consists of the senior members of the President&#x27;s Board, faculty deans, professors, lecturers and research assistants, assistants, students, and administrative and technical employees.
The President&#x27;s Office is tasked with leading the overall university business. It consists of the President and her staff, a General Secretariat, an Administrative Directorate, the Communications and Marketing Office, and two respective Vice-Presidents for Research and Education.

<doc id="427615" wikidata="Q4707031" url="?curid=427615" title="Alan Keen">
<text>David Alan Keen (25 November 1937 – 10 November 2011) was a British Labour Co-operative politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Feltham and Heston from 1992 until his death in 2011.

==Early life==
Although born in London, Alan Keen was brought up in the Grangetown and Redcar area in the present day unitary authority of Redcar and Cleveland in the north-east of England. He went to the Sir William Turner&#x27;s Grammar School in Redcar. He joined the British Army in 1960 and after nearly three years of service, in 1963, he started his career with the Fire Protection Industry where he remained until his election to the House of Commons. He also worked as a tactical scout for Middlesbrough F.C. for eighteen years.

==Parliamentary career==
He served as a member of Hounslow Borough Council from 1986 to 1990 and was elected to Parliament at the 1992 general election when he unseated the sitting Conservative MP Patrick Ground. In Parliament he served on both the Education (1995–1996) and the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committees (1997–1999 and from 2001).

===Policies===

====Heathrow Airport expansion====
On 28 January 2009, Keen voted against a motion in Parliament calling on the government to review a decision to add a third runway to Heathrow Airport. Keen had claimed to be opposed to expansion at Heathrow for many years; stating in his consultation publication on the issue he is &quot;opposed to an additional runway&quot; and although he was in favour of expansion up to the present boundaries &quot;there has to be a limit&quot; and he believed &quot;that limit has been reached&quot;. However at a House of Commons debate in January 2009, Keen voted in favour of the third runway.

===Expenses===
Together with his MP wife Ann Keen, the couple used their combined second homes allowances to buy an apartment on the South Bank of the River Thames.

In defending their part in the expenses scandal the Keen&#x27;s stated &quot;we have advocated, strongly supported, and voted for the introduction of Freedom of Information legislation. We are pleased that the point has been reached when full details of MPs&#x27; expenses are being published on a regular basis for everyone to see&quot;.

A formal investigation into the Keen’s expenses by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards ruled in March that the Keens had breached the expenses rules and that he regarded the breach of the rules as &quot;serious&quot;, and involving &quot;significant public funds&quot;. He suggested that the Keens should pay back four months worth of their claims - some £5,678. However, The Commons Standards and Privileges Committee of MPs disagreed with his findings and reduced the repayment to £1,500.

==Personal life==
Keen&#x27;s wife Ann Keen, whom he married in 1980, joined him in the Commons at the 1997 general election when she was elected for the neighbouring seat of Brentford and Isleworth. Ann held the seat until she was defeated in the 2010 general election. His sister-in-law, Sylvia Heal was an MP from 1997 to 2010 and Deputy Speakers of the House of Commons before retiring at the 2010 election.

Keen employed son David for at least 8 years as his constituency manager and senior caseworker. David and his daughter were from a previous marriage. He also had a stepson. He died in Lambeth, London, on 10 November 2011 from cancer, aged 73.

<text>Ann Lloyd Keen (&quot;née&quot; Fox; born 26 November 1948) is a British Labour Party politician, who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Brentford and Isleworth from 1997, until she was defeated by Conservative candidate Mary Macleod in 2010. In 1999, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper revealed that she had acted as a &quot;secret go-between&quot; for the Labour Party and Shaun Woodward, at the time the MP for Witney, as he attempted to defect from the Conservative Party in the same year.

==Early life==
Keen is the daughter of steelworker John Lloyd Fox and Ruby Hughes. She went to Elfed Secondary Modern School in Buckley, Clwyd, then gained a PGCEA (Postgraduate Certificate in the Education of Adults) from the University of Surrey. She worked in the National Health Service (NHS) before training as a registered nurse at Ashford General Hospital in Ashford, Middlesex, and won prizes as Nurse of the Year and Children&#x27;s Nurse of the Year. She later became a district nurse. From 1989 to 1993, she was Head of the Faculty of Advanced Nursing at Queen Charlotte&#x27;s College in Hammersmith (now part of Thames Valley University) and she also served as General Secretary of the Community and District Nursing Association.

==Parliamentary career==
Keen stood for the Brentford &amp; Isleworth seat in 1987 and 1992 though was unsuccessful on both occasions. For the 1997 election she was again selected, on this occasion through an all-women shortlist. This method of selection was declared unlawful in January 1996 as it breached sex discrimination laws. Despite the ruling she remained in place as the candidate for the 1997 general election, when she became an MP defeating Conservative MP Nirj Deva.

Keen&#x27;s first role in Parliament came in 1999 when she was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Frank Dobson, Secretary of State for Health, though this appointment lasted less than a month. She then moved to the Treasury, later becoming Parliamentary Private Secretary to the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown. In 2000 Keen became well known for campaigning on gay rights, her interest in the issue sparked when she was reunited with her gay son who she had given up for adoption. In the same year she also successfully ran a campaign to elect Michael Martin as Speaker to the House of Commons.

She was defeated at the 2010 general election by Conservative candidate Mary Macleod on a swing of 6%.

===Health minister===
Keen campaigned in parliament on health issues as a backbencher, and served on the health select committee. In 1998, Keen proposed an Early Day Motion calling for equitable care for women with ovarian cancer, which was supported by over 100 other MPs.

On 29 June 2007, in Brown&#x27;s first reshuffle as Prime Minister she was promoted to become a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State in the Department of Health, where her brief included NHS dentistry.

In 2009–2010, Keen led the Prime Minister&#x27;s independent commission on the future of nursing and midwifery in England, which resulted in the report Front Line Care.

===Policies===

====Heathrow Airport expansion====
On 28 January 2009, Keen voted against a motion in Parliament calling for a review of the decision to add a third runway at Heathrow Airport. Keen had claimed to be opposed to expansion at Heathrow for many years; her website stated in 2007 that &quot;one of her most successful campaigns was against the Third Runway at Heathrow.&quot; Friends of the Earth said she had &quot;betrayed her constituents.&quot;

===Expenses===
Keen and her MP husband Alan Keen used their combined second homes allowances to buy an apartment on the South Bank of the River Thames. The Waterloo apartment was nine miles from their constituency home in Brentford, a 30-minute drive from Westminster.

In 2009, their Brentford home was occupied by squatters after it was unoccupied for 9–12 months following a dispute with a building firm undertaking renovation work.
In defending their part in the expenses scandal the Keens stated &quot;we have advocated, strongly supported, and voted for the introduction of Freedom of Information legislation. We are pleased that the point has been reached when full details of MPs&#x27; expenses are being published on a regular basis for everyone to see&quot;.

A formal investigation into the Keens&#x27; expenses by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards ruled in March 2010 that the Keens had breached the expenses rules and that he regarded the breach of the rules as &quot;serious&quot;, and involving &quot;significant public funds&quot;. He suggested the Keens pay back four months worth of their claims – some £5,678. However, The Commons Standards and Privileges Committee of MPs disagreed with his findings and ordered them to repay £1,500.

====Misuse of stationery====
In May 2009 the Parliamentary ombudsman instructed Keen to repay £4,583 for sending unsolicited letters to her constituents. Keen invited them to coffee mornings using prepaid envelopes and on House of Commons headed stationery, a breach of Parliamentary rules as they are only permitted to be used for replies. Keen said the correspondence was sent by &quot;a new member of staff ... on House of Commons instead of constituency stationery. When it was brought to my attention I immediately refunded the cost.&quot;

In April 2005 Keen also attracted criticism for using schools to distribute party political material to children&#x27;s parents.

==John Taylor&#x27;s failed legal claim==
In February 2009 constituent John Taylor alleged Keen had breached her &#x27;duty of care&#x27; to a constituent in failing to assist his attempts in achieving compensation for wrongful imprisonment. Keen was initially ordered to pay £15,000 in damages by a judgment entered in default, but the ruling was later set aside, with the judge stating there was no entitlement in law for him to bring such a claim. Keen said, &quot;As an MP I deal with huge numbers of cases each year for my constituents, many of which have successful outcomes. &quot;Unfortunately, some cases for a variety of reasons do not have successful outcomes. Despite trying my hardest for Mr Taylor for more than 10 years since 1997, this was one such case.&quot; The case was believed to be the first of its kind.

==Personal life==
She married Alan Keen, who sat as a Labour MP from 1992 until his death in 2011, in 1980. Her sister, Sylvia Heal, also a former Labour MP, was one of three Deputy Speakers of the House of Commons under former Speaker Michael Martin. Keen has two sons and one daughter. In 1966, as an unmarried mother, she was forced to give up her son for adoption at his birth and was only reunited with him in 1997.

<doc id="427618" wikidata="Q1073318" url="?curid=427618" title="Louhi">
<text>Louhi () is a wicked queen of the land known as Pohjola in Finnish mythology and a villain of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. As many mythological creatures and objects are easily conflated and separated in Finnish mythology, Louhi is probably an alter-ego of the goddess Loviatar.

==In mythology==
Louhi is described as a powerful and evil witch queen ruling over the northern realm of Pohjola, with the ability to change shape and weave mighty enchantments. She is also the main opponent of Väinämöinen and his group in the battle for the magical artifact Sampo in the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. She has a number of beautiful daughters, whom Ilmarinen, Lemminkäinen and other heroes attempt to win in various legends. In true fairy tale form, Louhi sets them difficult-to-impossible tasks to perform in order to claim such a prize, which leads to the forging of the Sampo.

==In popular culture==
*Louhi was the main antagonist in the Finnish-Soviet film &quot;Sampo&quot;, played by Anna Orochko. 
*There is an orchestral work &quot;Louhi&quot; by the Finnish composer Kalevi Aho, and the wind orchestral work &quot;Louhi&#x27;s Spells / Louhen loitsut&quot; by Finnish composer Tomi Räisänen. 
*Louhi is track 5 on &quot;Kesto&quot;, recorded by Pan Sonic. 
*Louhi was an inspiration for a foe of Conan the Barbarian&#x27;s in the Marvel comics version of the character (no such foe ever appears in Howard&#x27;s stories)
*&quot;Final Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light&quot; features Louhi the Witch of the North as a boss, &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; features the item Louhi&#x27;s Mask, and &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; features Louhi as a powerful ice enemy.
*Louhi is the main antagonist of Michael Scott Rohan&#x27;s fantasy trilogy &quot;The Winter of the World&quot;. 
*Louhi is also one of the names of the witch Iggwilv in the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game&#x27;s Greyhawk campaign by Gary Gygax. In his book &quot;Sea of Death&quot;, Iggwilv is mentioned as being called Louhi on an alternate Earth. Louhi is also mentioned in the supplement &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; for the first edition of &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, as character part of the Finnish mythos.
*&quot;&quot; – Louhi&#x27;s snake – is an archaic form of &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;dragon&quot; in Finnish.

<text>The Photo Marketing Association International (PMA) International Convention and Trade Show was an annual imaging technology trade show conducted by PMA held in Las Vegas. Since 2012, the show has been branded as PMA@CES, reflecting its rescheduling to coincide with the Consumer Electronics Show, a major annual consumer electronics trade show also held in Las Vegas.

The PMA International Convention and Trade Show is frequently the occasion for the public introduction of important imaging products. The major competition for this trade show is Photokina, held in even-numbered years in Cologne, Germany.

In 2012, PMA announced it would launch an online community known as The Big Photo Show, with associated trade shows under that banner in the U.S. The first such show was held in Los Angeles in May 2013, with another scheduled for that city in May 2014. Unlike PMA@CES, which is restricted exclusively to trade visitors, The Big Photo Show is specifically intended for consumers.

PMA has seven member associations: Association of Imaging Executives, Digital Imaging Marketing Association, National Association of Photo Equipment Technicians, Photo Imaging Education Association, Professional Picture Framers Association PPFA, Professional School Photographers Association and Sports Photographers Association of America.

<doc id="427621" wikidata="Q7151723" url="?curid=427621" title="Paul Keetch">
<text>Paul Stuart Keetch (21 May 1961 – 24 May 2017) was a British Liberal Democrat politician and lobbyist who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Hereford from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life==
He went to Hereford High School for Boys (now Aylestone Business and Enterprise College), followed by Hereford Sixth Form College. Keetch joined the Liberal Party while still at school, and chaired the Hereford Young Liberals and the West Midlands Region Young Liberals, as well as being the election agent for the Liberals in Hereford in 1983. He was elected to Hereford City Council in 1983 at the age of 21, making him the then-youngest city councillor in the UK, and served two years before resigning to move to London. His first jobs were in banking and financial services, before moving to the water hygiene industry and Franklin Hodge self-assembly water tanks. He moved to London for Hodge in 1985, but soon left to become a self-employed public affairs consultant.

==Political career==
Keetch was selected as Lib Dem candidate for Hereford in 1994 and was elected to be the city&#x27;s MP at the 1997 general election. He was a junior Liberal Democrat spokesman for Foreign Affairs from 1999 to 2001, a frontbench spokesman on Defence from October 1999 until the May 2005 general election, and a junior party Whip until 2010.

In July 2005, Keetch succeeded Sharon Bowles MEP as Chair of the Liberal International British Group. He also sat on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. He founded the Cider All-Party Parliamentary Group. He served for a year as an honorary lieutenant commander in the Royal Navy as part of the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme and on the NATO Parliamentary Assembly for five years.

Keetch had comfortably captured his traditionally marginal seat by 6,648 votes when he gained it from the Conservatives in 1997, but his majority dropped to 968 votes when he was re-elected in 2001, and when he won a third term in 2005 it was by 962 votes. Keetch did not stand for re-election at the 2010 general election.

==Expenses and rule breaches==
In 2008, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; stated that Keetch &quot;never knowingly underspent&quot;, and it mocked his &quot;expense-fuelled forays to John Lewis&quot;, including &quot;such indispensable items as a cheese grater, three large bottle stoppers and a white pudding basin.&quot; During the 2009 United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, the &quot;Hereford Times&quot; noted that in the past year he had claimed £142,385, including £87,000 on staffing costs (part of which would have gone to his wife, who worked for him), and £23,351.74 in second home allowances (the maximum permitted at the time). Keetch missed 9 out of 10 parliamentary votes on MPs&#x27; expenses. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; recorded that his &quot;mortgage jumped from £145,000 to £300,000 when he sold a flat in Stockwell in London last year and moved around the corner. The new flat was furnished with a sofa-bed costing £690 and a wardrobe at £624.&quot;

In March 2010, a BBC investigation showed that Keetch had breached House of Commons rules relating to declaring outside interests. In 2005, he twice visited Gibraltar, firstly paid for by the Liberal Party of Gibraltar and secondly paid for by the Gibraltar government, yet when he asked two parliamentary questions and signed three Early Day Motions relating to Gibraltar, he failed to declare either of these interests. Similarly, he visited South Korea in 2006 paid for by the government, but failed to declare this when he subsequently signed an Early Day Motion on North Korea.

==Personal life==
Keetch married Claire Elizabeth Baker on 21 December 1991 and they had one son. She worked for her husband as a constituency case worker. They divorced in 2011.

On 8 July 2007, he was taken seriously ill whilst travelling to the United States on a flight. The pilot turned the aeroplane back to London and he was admitted to London Chest Hospital. Doctors eventually diagnosed him with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation and fitted an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

On 13 November 2009, &quot;The Sun&quot; printed front-page photos of the married MP kissing the estranged wife of SAS soldier and author Cameron Spence, with the pair staying overnight in Keetch&#x27;s flat and subsequently emerging at 10:30am the next day, 11 November. Keetch&#x27;s first wife divorced him just over a year later.

==Post-parliamentary career==
After leaving parliament in 2010, Keetch resumed work as a lobbyist, initially working alone. In 2011 he became a founding partner in Wellington Street Partners with retired Conservative MP Sir Sydney Chapman and expelled Labour MP Phil Woolas. Keetch resigned from the partnership in 2013 and resumed independent practice.

On 7 March 2016, Keetch announced he would be campaigning to leave the European Union in the 23 June EU referendum. He fronted the &quot;Liberal Leave&quot; organisation and was the most prominent Liberal Democrat to endorse a Leave vote.

After a short illness, Keetch died on 24 May 2017, at the age of 56.

<text>John Bennett Fenn (June 15, 1917December 10, 2010) was an American professor of analytical chemistry who was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2002. He shared half of the award with Koichi Tanaka for their work in mass spectrometry. The other half went to Kurt Wüthrich. Fenn&#x27;s contributions specifically related to the development of electrospray ionization, now a commonly used technique for large molecules and routine liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Early in his career, he studied the field of jet propulsion at Project SQUID and focused on molecular beams. He finished his career with more than 100 publications, including one book.

Fenn was born in New York City, and moved to Kentucky with his family during the Great Depression. Fenn did his undergraduate work at Berea College, and received his PhD from Yale. He worked in industry at Monsanto and at private research labs before moving to academic posts including Yale and Virginia Commonwealth University.

Fenn&#x27;s research into electrospray ionization found him at the center of a legal dispute with Yale University. He lost the lawsuit, after it was determined that he misled the university about the potential usefulness of the technology. Yale was awarded $500,000 in legal fees and $545,000 in damages. The decision pleased the university, but provoked mixed responses from some people affiliated with the institution, who were disappointed with the treatment of a Nobel Prize winner with such a long history at the school.

==Early life and education==
Fenn was born in New York City, and grew up in Hackensack, New Jersey. In the years preceding the Great Depression, Fenn&#x27;s father worked several different jobs, including briefly working as a draftsman at the Fokker Aircraft Company. During this time, Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s plane &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot; was briefly stored at one of the company&#x27;s hangars. Fenn recalled sitting in the cockpit as a ten-year-old, pretending to pilot the famous plane. When his family&#x27;s fortunes took a turn for the worse with the advent of the Depression, they moved to Berea, Kentucky, because his aunt Helen Dingman, who was on the faculty of Berea College, agreed to help the family. Fenn completed his education at Berea College and Allied Schools, formally finishing his high school education at the age of 15, but he took extra classes for another year rather than start college at such a young age. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Berea College in his new hometown, with the assistance of summer classes in organic chemistry at the University of Iowa, and physical chemistry at Purdue.

When Fenn was considering graduate school, he was advised to take additional mathematics courses by Henry Bent, then a chemistry professor at Harvard University. His undergraduate program in chemistry had required minimal math courses, and he had been excused from these due to high marks in his high school courses. Due to Bent&#x27;s advice, Fenn added math classes to his schedule. Despite his future success, Fenn always felt that his lack of mathematical skills were a hindrance in his career. After submitting several applications, Fenn received offers for teaching assistantships from Yale and Northwestern, and accepted the position at Yale. Fenn did his graduate studies in physical chemistry under Gosta Akerlof. He obtained his PhD in chemistry from Yale in 1940 and his thesis was 45 pages long, with only three pages of prose.

==Research career and academic posts==
After completing graduate school, Fenn&#x27;s first job was with Monsanto, working in the Phosphate Division and producing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Fenn and his colleague James Mullen became disenchanted with the direction of work at Monsanto, and they resigned together in 1943. Fenn worked briefly at a small company named Sharples Chemicals that focused on the production of amyl chloride derivatives. In 1945, he joined Mullen at his new startup, Experiment, Inc, focusing on research and development. Fenn&#x27;s first publication came in 1949 as a result of his work with Mullen. That this publication came ten years after he completed graduate school made Fenn somewhat of a rarity amongst academics.

In 1952, Fenn moved to Princeton University as Director of Project SQUID, a program to support research related to jet propulsion that was funded by the Office of Naval Research. During this period, Fenn started his work developing supersonic atomic and molecular beam sources, which are now widely used in chemical physics research. After working with Project SQUID, Fenn returned to Yale University in 1967. He held a joint appointment in the chemistry and engineering departments until 1987, conducting much of his research in Mason Laboratory. In 1987, Fenn had reached Yale&#x27;s mandatory retirement age. He became a professor emeritus, entitling him to office space at the university, but costing him most of his laboratory space and research assistants.

After a dispute with Yale over his forced retirement and the rights to his invention of electrospray ionization, Fenn moved to Richmond, Virginia to join Virginia Commonwealth University&#x27;s (VCU) department of chemistry as an analytical chemistry professor. VCU established an engineering department in the late 1990s, and Fenn held a joint professorship between the two departments until his death. Even in his 80s, Fenn enjoyed the opportunity to be in the lab doing research, saying, &quot;I like to mingle and exchange with the young people. It gets me out from underfoot at home.&quot;

==Research interests==

While Fenn was working with Monsanto, the company&#x27;s research was focused on the production of phosphoric acid and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Fenn and his colleagues at Monsanto were largely unaware of the health hazards posed by PCBs, indeed because of their inertness, they &quot;practically bathed in the stuff&quot;. After spending several more years doing various industrial research, Fenn was looking to get back into the academic world. He had the opportunity to go to Princeton University, where he became the director of Project SQUID.

Fenn did not start his Nobel-winning research until later in his career. He was semi-retired when he first published his research on electrospray ionization for mass spectrometry. Fenn felt that his work in electrospray ionization received &quot;a kick in the pants&quot; when proteomics emerged. In 2001, more than 1700 papers on proteomics were published, many using electrospray ionization. Electrospray ionization provides a way to get accurate information about the mass of a large molecule very quickly, even when it is in a mixture of other molecules. The liquid sample is introduced into an electrospray source (at atmospheric pressure) and desolvated with a flow of heated nitrogen gas. This forms small droplets which evaporate in a region under vacuum, which increases the charge on the droplets. For large molecules like proteins, this often results in multiply charge species. Increasing the charge on the molecules, decreased the mass-to-charge ratio, which allows the mass to be more easily determined.

Despite getting a late start in publishing his research (he did not publish a paper until 10 years after finishing graduate school), Fenn had over 100 publications at the time of his death. He also wrote a book, entitled &quot;Engines, Energy, and Entropy: A Thermodynamics Primer&quot;. The Chemical Heritage Foundation Museum in Philadelphia, PA has the instrument Fenn and his graduate students built while they were developing electrospray ionization on display, after receiving it as a gift from Fenn.

===Lawsuit===
Fenn&#x27;s work with electrospray ionization was at the center of a lawsuit pitting him against his alma mater and former employer, Yale University. His initial dispute with the university began in 1987, when he turned 70 – Yale&#x27;s mandatory retirement age. Per university policy, Fenn was made an emeritus professor, which resulted in a reduction to his lab space. Emeritus professors at Yale are still provided with an office, but cannot conduct their own research, nor manage their own labs. In 1989, when Yale University inquired about the progress and potential about his electrospray work, he downplayed its potential scientific and commercial value. Fenn believed he had the rights to the invention under the Bayh–Dole Act. Fenn patented the technology on his own, and sold licensing rights to a company he partly owned – Analytica of Branford. In 1993, a private company seeking to license the use of electrospray technology traced its invention to Yale, when the university discovered that Fenn held the patent. Yale&#x27;s policy regarding patents generated by faculty or students requires that a percentage of any royalties generated from the patent are used by the university to fund future research. They do not claim the rights to patents that are produced away from university facilities or not related to the researcher&#x27;s &quot;designated activities.&quot; Fenn claimed that he owned the technology because the work was completed after he had been forced to downsize at the university&#x27;s mandatory retirement age.

Yale University entered into its own licensing agreement with a private company, leading Fenn to file a lawsuit against the school in 1996. Yale countersued, requesting damages and reassignment of the patent. The two parties did not reach an out of court settlement, despite repeated attempts at mediation. In 2005, U.S. District Judge Christopher Droney ruled against Fenn, awarding Yale $545,000 in royalties and $500,000 in legal fees. Judge Droney was critical of Fenn, saying &quot;Dr. Fenn only obtained the patent through fraud, civil theft, and breach of fiduciary duty.&quot; Evidence presented in the case indicated that Fenn had served on panels at Yale University that reviewed the institution&#x27;s policy on intellectual property.

A spokesperson for Yale said, &quot;We are pleased by the result in this case and, in particular, by the court&#x27;s vindication of the Yale patent policy.&quot; The ruling, and Yale&#x27;s response produced a mixed reaction from some of Fenn&#x27;s colleagues and former students, who wrote a letter to the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; stating, &quot;&#x27;Vindicating the Yale patent policy&#x27; is a poor excuse for treating a Nobel Laureate with a 68-year association with and dedicated service to the University, in such a contemptible manner.&quot;

==Awards and honors==

===Nobel Prize===

Fenn shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Koichi Tanaka and Kurt Wüthrich &quot;for the development of methods for identification and structure analyses of biological macromolecules.&quot; Fenn and Tanaka split half of the award for their work in developing ionization techniques for using mass spectrometry to analyze large biological molecules. Wüthrich was honored for his work in developing nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to analyze similar molecules in solution. Fenn was honored largely for his contributions to the development of electrospray ionization, which made the analysis of large molecules by mass spectrometry feasible. Fenn&#x27;s Nobel lecture after being presented with the award was entitled &quot;Electrospray Wings for Molecular Elephants.&quot; He was surprised by his selection as a Nobel winner, saying &quot;It&#x27;s like winning the lottery, I&#x27;m still in shock.&quot; At the time of his award, Fenn was working at Virginia Commonwealth University.

===Other awards===
Fenn received his Nobel Prize fairly late in his career. Prior to being honored by the Nobel Foundation, Fenn had received numerous other awards. Early in his career, Fenn&#x27;s research was focused on molecular beams, leading him to be named an honorary president of the Sixth International Symposium on Molecular Beams in 1977, and the first fellow of the International Molecular Beam Symposium in 1985. In 1982, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation presented him with their U.S. Senior Scientist Award.

Fenn&#x27;s work in mass spectrometry earned him another spate of awards later in his career. In 1992, the American Society for Mass Spectrometry presented him with their Award for Distinguished Contributions in Mass Spectrometry. The International Society of Mass Spectrometry honored him with the Thomson Medal in 2000, and in the same year the American Chemical Society presented him with the Award for Advancements in Chemical Instrumentation. He was awarded the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities Award for outstanding contributions to Biomolecular Technologies in 2002. In 2003, Fenn was honored by his alma mater with the Wilbur Cross Medal, the Yale Graduate School Alumni Association&#x27;s highest honor.

Fenn maintained numerous professional affiliations, including membership in the American Chemical Society, the American Society for Mass Spectrometry, Sigma Chi, the American Association of University Professors and the Alexander von Humboldt Association of America. In 2000, Fenn was made a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and in 2003 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

==Personal life==
Fenn married Margaret Wilson at the end of his second year of graduate studies. Together, they had three children – two daughters and a son. Margaret was killed in a car accident in New Zealand in 1992. Fenn remarried, his second wife was named Frederica Mullen. He died in Richmond, Virginia on December 10, 2010, at the age of 93, exactly 8 years to the day after receiving his Nobel Prize. Fenn was survived by Frederica, his three children, seven grandchildren, and eleven great-grandchildren: Anika Fenn Gilman, Nora Fenn Gilman, Dominick Brown, Aaron Holloway, Michelle Holloway, Damarion Holloway, Tyrell Holloway, Eloise Whittington, JC Leslie, Manon Leslie, and Dino Steinberg.

<text>Benning Wentworth (July 24, 1696 – October 14, 1770) was an American merchant, landowner and colonial administrator who served as the governor of New Hampshire from 1741 to 1766. He is best known for issuing several land grants in territories claimed by the Province of New Hampshire west of the Connecticut River while serving as governor, which led to disputes with the neighboring Province of New York and the eventual establishment of Vermont.

Born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire into a prominent local family, Wentworth was groomed by his father John while growing up to assume control over the family businesses. However, Wentworth&#x27;s misbehavior while studying at Harvard College led him to be sent by his father to Boston instead in 1715. There, Wentworth was apprenticed to his uncle before working as a merchant. In 1730, he returned to Portsmouth to assume control over his father&#x27;s estate.

After Wentworth returned to New Hampshire, he became involved in politics, sitting on both the House of Representatives and the governor&#x27;s council in the 1730s. There, he allied with Theodore Atkinson against political rivals Jonathan Belcher and Richard Waldron. In 1733, Spanish officials refused to pay Wentworth for a timber shipment, leaving him in debt. Negotiations in London to resolve this led to Wentworth being appointed governor in 1741.

Wentworth used his position as governor to entrench his family&#x27;s economic and political dominance in New Hampshire. In the 1760&#x27;s, a dispute with the colonial government in neighboring New York ultimately led to an end to Wentworth&#x27;s land grants, and he eventually stepped down as governor in 1766. Wentworth soon retired to his house in Portsmouth, where he died four years later. The town of Bennington, Vermont was named in his honor.

==Early life==

Benning Wentworth was born on July 24, 1696, in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. His father, John Wentworth, was a ship&#x27;s captain, businessman and colonial administrator who served as the lieutenant-governor of colonial New Hampshire from 1717 until 1730 after spending two years serving on merchant ships. Wentworth&#x27;s mother, Sarah Hunking Wentworth, was the daughter of Captain Mark Hunking, a wealthy resident of Portsmouth.

Growing up, Wentworth was initially groomed by his father to take over the family business, though this changed after he graduated from Harvard College in 1715. Due to poor behavior Wentworth exhibited while studying at Harvard, including setting a college record in windows broken and fines paid, his father instead arranged for him to undergo an apprenticeship at his uncle Samuel Wentworth&#x27;s counting house in Boston, Massachusetts.

After the apprenticeship, his father arranged for Wentworth to work as a merchant, plying the colonial trade with the West Indies and Spain in timber, wine and brandy for about a decade. After his father died in December 1730, Wentworth, who had not acquired any property in Boston, returned to Portsmouth to assume control over his inheritance, including 2,000 pounds, extensive real estate, and the family trade in ship masts and timber.

==Political career==

In the same year, Wentworth also took his place as the head of a powerful and politically connected New Hampshire family who were opponents of colonial administrator Jonathan Belcher and his political ally Richard Waldron. Prior to this occurring, Belcher and Waldron had ousted his family from positions of political authority, which led Wentworth to conspire with fellow politician Theodore Atkinson to remove the two from power.

In August 1732, Wentworth was elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives. He subsequently used the influence of political ally David Dunbar, then serving as the lieutenant-governor of the colony, to become appointed to the governor&#x27;s council in 1734. While he was sitting on the House of Representatives and the governor&#x27;s council, Wentworth worked with several allies to undermine Belcher and Waldron&#x27;s political influence, as the pair sought to unite New Hampshire with Massachusetts (Wentworth wanted the two colonies to be completely separate politically).

After British settlers established the Province of Georgia in 1732, Anglo-Spanish relations quickly deteriorated, and in 1733 the Spanish government refused to pay Wentworth for a shipment of timber worth 11,000 pounds. This refusal put Wentworth at the mercy of his creditors in Boston, and he was forced to borrow heavily from British merchants in London, in particular associate John Thomlinson, to pay them off. Wentworth lodged a claim against the British government, claiming that they needed to repay him for the Spanish state&#x27;s refusal to pay for the timber shipment.

In 1738, Wentworth travelled to London to negotiate a deal with his British contacts, including both merchants and government officials, as he was on the verge of bankruptcy. While he was in London, a commission was established to determine the boundary lines between the provinces of New Hampshire and Massachusetts Bay, which were then disputed by both colonies. Under the influence of Atkinson, who sat on the commission, its members eventually decided to issue a ruling in support of New Hampshire&#x27;s boundary claims, doubling the size of the nascent colony.

Meanwhile, Wentworth continued to negotiate with his contacts in London. Eventually, Thomlinson (who held political influence due to Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle being his patron) formulated a plan where in exchange for 300 pound sterling, Wentworth would be appointed as the governor of New Hampshire; in return, he would drop his ongoing claim against the British government. Wentworth&#x27;s supporters in New Hampshire quickly raised the sum for him, and on December 12, 1741, Wentworth officially succeeded Belcher as the governor.

==Governorship and death==

During his tenure as governor, Wentworth proved himself to be a &quot;shrewd, compromising, and accommodating politician&quot;. Wentworth primarily concerned himself in office with issuing land grants, placating potential rivals by issuing them with justice of the peace and military commissions, and appeasing the timber industry by turning a blind eye to the controversial white pine laws, allowing merchants free access to the New Hampshire forests in order to cut down white pine trees so long as they kept supplying masts to his brother Mark, who sold them to the British Royal Navy.

In the mid-1730s, most of Wentworth&#x27;s family members converted to Anglicanism, joining the Church of England. Wentworth joined them in the early-1740&#x27;s and supported the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, a missionary arm of the Church, by issuing them several land grants on the North American frontier. During this period, Wentworth ensured his dominance in the New Hampshire political scene by filling government positions with his relatives to ensure they dominated the profitable mast trade, a stranglehold which lasted until the American Revolutionary War.

From 1748 to 1752, Wentworth sparked a constitutional crisis by extending representation to newly-established colonial settlements which he knew politically supported him. Wentworth also vetoed the house&#x27;s decision to nominate Waldron as speaker of the house, taking these steps because his political opponents had by now gained a majority in the house. The house objected, which led to a political impasse as both sides refused to concede. Wentworth eventually received instructions from Crown officials supporting his position, which led to the standoff being resolved in his favor.

Beginning in 1749, Wentworth issued a a series of land grants to expand the borders of New Hampshire. These included 131 towns, many of which were in territory contested with New York, which disputed Wentworth&#x27;s grants and appealed to the Board of Trade and Plantations. The board eventually issued a ruling on July 26, 1764, in favor of New York. As a result, all settlers in the region had to live under New York&#x27;s jurisdiction, which many of them resented. Eventually, a group of settlers from New Hampshire declared independence in 1777 as the State of Vermont.

The controversy surrounding the land grants and Thomlinson&#x27;s failing health led Wentworth to quietly step down as governor on July 30, 1766. His nephew John, who had prevented Wentworth from being dismissed in disgrace due to his political relationship with Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, assumed the governorship of New Hampshire the next year in 1767. Wentworth then retired to his personal mansion at Little Harbor, Portsmouth, where he died on October 14, 1770. After his death, Wentworth was buried in the cemetery of Queen&#x27;s Chapel.

==Personal life, family and legacy==
During his political career, Wentworth gained a &quot;reputation of being haughty and arrogant yet shrewd and tenacious&quot;, and was pejoratively nicknamed &quot;&quot;Don&quot; Granada&quot; and &quot;&quot;Don&quot; Diego&quot; by his political opponents. He was described by American historian David E. Van Deventer as being &quot;able to [both] maintain a family dynasty and Portsmouth&#x27;s control of the prosperous mast trade for a generation&quot; who was &quot;perhaps even British America&#x27;s first political machine.&quot;

Wentworth was the eldest child in a family which consisted of eight brothers and five sisters, all of them sharing the same parents. Many of his family followed Wentworth into political careers, while others married his associates; Wentworth&#x27;s sister Hannah married Theodore Atkinson. On December 13, 1719, Wentworth married Abigail Ruck, the daughter of a wealthy Boston merchant. The couple had three sons, all of whom died before Wentworth.

After Abigail died in 1755, Wentworth remarried on March 15, 1760, to his 23-year old housekeeper, Martha Hilton. He had several children with Martha, though all of them were stillborn. Angered that his family had shunned him over marrying someone who was socially beneath him, Wentworth gave his estate in its entirety to Martha in his last will and testament, leaving them nothing. Martha remarried after his death to Michael, a relative of Wentworth.

Wentworth parlayed his mercantile and political career to acquire a small fortune, which included 10,000 guineas and several real estate properties. His involvement in issuing land grants led to several settlements to be directly and indirectly named after him; the town of Bennington, Vermont, was named in his honor. After a famous Revolutionary War battle occurred near Bennington in 1771, the town of Bennington, New Hampshire, was named after it.

<doc id="427626" wikidata="Q295420" url="?curid=427626" title="Mikhail Baryshnikov">
<text>Mikhail Nikolayevich Baryshnikov (; ; born January 27, 1948) is a Latvian and American dancer, choreographer, and actor. He was the preeminent male classical ballet dancer of the 1970s and 1980s. He subsequently became a noted dance director.

Born in Riga, Latvian SSR, into a Russian family, Baryshnikov had a promising start in the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad before defecting to Canada in 1974 for more opportunities in Western dance. After dancing with the American Ballet Theatre, he joined the New York City Ballet as a principal dancer for one season to learn about George Balanchine&#x27;s neoclassical Russian style of movement. He then returned to the American Ballet Theatre, where he later became artistic director. Baryshnikov has spearheaded many of his own artistic projects and has been associated in particular with promoting modern dance, premiering dozens of new works, including many of his own. His success as a dramatic actor on stage, cinema, and television, has helped him become probably the most widely recognized contemporary ballet dancer. After his 1974 defection, Baryshnikov never returned to the USSR. Since 1986, he has been a naturalized citizen of the United States. After Latvia declared independence on 4 May 1990, he often returned there; in 2017, the Republic of Latvia granted Baryshnikov citizenship for extraordinary merit.

In 1977, he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and a Golden Globe nomination for his portrayal of Yuri Kopeikine in the film &quot;The Turning Point&quot;. He starred in the movie &quot;White Nights&quot; with Gregory Hines, Helen Mirren, and Isabella Rossellini, and had a recurring role in the last season of the television series &quot;Sex and the City&quot;.

==Early life==
Mikhail Baryshnikov was born in Riga, in the Latvian SSR, Soviet Union, now known as Latvia. His parents were ethnic Russians: his mother was Alexandra (a dressmaker; &quot;née&quot; Kiselyova) and his father was Nikolay Baryshnikov (an engineer). According to Baryshnikov, his father was a strict, nationalist military man, and his mother introduced him to theatre, opera, and ballet. She died by suicide when he was 12 years old.

==Dancing career==

===1960–1974: early years===
Baryshnikov began his ballet studies in Riga in 1960, at the age of 12. In 1964, he entered the Vaganova School, in what was then Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). Baryshnikov soon won the top prize in the junior division of the Varna International Ballet Competition. He joined the Mariinsky Ballet, then called the Kirov Ballet, in 1967, dancing the &quot;Peasant&quot; pas de deux in &quot;Giselle&quot;. Recognizing Baryshnikov&#x27;s talent, particularly his stage presence and purity of technique, several Soviet choreographers, including Oleg Vinogradov, Konstantin Sergeyev, Igor Tchernichov, and Leonid Jakobson, choreographed ballets for him. Baryshnikov made signature roles of Jakobson&#x27;s 1969 virtuosic &quot;Vestris&quot; along with an intensely emotional Albrecht in &quot;Giselle&quot;. While he was still in the Soviet Union, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Clive Barnes called him &quot;the most perfect dancer I have ever seen.&quot;

===1974: defection to Canada===
Baryshnikov&#x27;s talent was obvious from his youth, but being 5&#x27; 5&quot; (165 cm) or 5&#x27; 6&quot; (168 cm) tall—shorter than most male ballet dancers—he could not tower over a ballerina &quot;en pointe&quot; and was therefore relegated to secondary parts. More frustrating to him, the Soviet dance world hewed closely to 19th-century traditions and deliberately shunned Western choreographers, whose work Baryshnikov glimpsed in occasional tours and films. His main reason for leaving the Soviet Union was to work with these innovators.

On June 29, 1974, in Toronto while on tour with the Bolshoi, Baryshnikov defected, requesting political asylum in Canada. As recalled by John Fraser, a ballet critic from Toronto who helped Baryshnikov to escape, Fraser wrote down phone numbers of people on a small piece of paper and hid it under his wedding ring. At a banquet after one show he managed to distract the KGB officer who followed Baryshnikov as an interpreter and gave Baryshnikov the paper. Soon, Baryshnikov joined the National Ballet of Canada for a brief time in a guest role. He also announced that he would not return to the USSR. He later said that Christina Berlin, an American friend, helped engineer his defection during his 1970 tour of London. His first televised performance after coming out of temporary seclusion in Canada was with the National Ballet of Canada in &quot;La Sylphide&quot;. He then went to the United States. In December 1975, he and his dance partner Natalia Makarova featured prominently in an episode of the BBC television series &quot;Arena&quot;.

In the first two years after his defection, he danced for no fewer than 13 different choreographers, including Jerome Robbins, Glen Tetley, Alvin Ailey, and Twyla Tharp. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter if every ballet is a success or not&quot;, he told &quot;New York Times&quot; dance critic Anna Kisselgoff in 1976. &quot;The new experience gives me a lot.&quot; He cited his fascination with the ways Ailey mixed classical and modern technique and his initial discomfort when Tharp insisted he incorporate eccentric personal gestures in dance.

===1974–1978: principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre===
From 1974 to 1978, Baryshnikov was a principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), where he partnered with Gelsey Kirkland.

===1978–1979: principal dancer with the New York City Ballet===
 In 1978, Baryshnikov abandoned his freelance career to spend 18 months as a principal of the New York City Ballet, run by George Balanchine. &quot;Mr. B&quot;, as Balanchine was known, rarely welcomed guest artists and had refused to work with both Rudolf Nureyev and Natalia Makarova. Baryshnikov&#x27;s decision to devote his full attentions to the New York company stunned the dance world. Balanchine never created a new work for Baryshnikov, but he did coach him in his distinctive style, and Baryshnikov triumphed in such signature roles as &quot;Apollo&quot;, &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;, and &quot;Rubies&quot;. Jerome Robbins created &quot;Opus 19/The Dreamer&quot; for Baryshnikov and NYCB favorite Patricia McBride.

Baryshnikov performed with the New York City Ballet as a principal dancer for 15 months from 1978 to 1979. On July 8, 1978, he made his debut with George Balanchine&#x27;s and Lincoln Kirstein&#x27;s company at Saratoga Springs, appearing as Franz in &quot;Coppélia&quot;.

On October 12, 1979, Baryshnikov danced the role of the Poet in Balanchine&#x27;s ballet &quot;La Sonnambula&quot; with the City Ballet at the Kennedy Center. This was his last performance with New York City Ballet due to tendinitis and other injuries. His tenure there coincided with a period of ill health for Balanchine that followed an earlier heart attack and culminated in successful heart surgery in June 1979. Baryshnikov left the company to become ABT&#x27;s artistic director in September 1980, and take time off for his injuries.

===1980–2002: artistic director of the American Ballet Theatre and White Oak Dance Project===
Baryshnikov returned to the American Ballet Theatre in September 1980 as an artistic director, a position he held until 1989. He also performed as a dancer with ABT. Baryshnikov has remained fascinated with the new. As he observed, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter how high you lift your leg. The technique is about transparency, simplicity and making an earnest attempt.&quot; Baryshnikov also toured with ballet and modern dance companies around the world for 15 months. Several roles were created for him, including in Robbins&#x27;s &quot;Opus 19: The Dreamer&quot; (1979), Frederick Ashton&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody&quot; (1980), and Robbins&#x27;s &quot;Other Dances&quot;, with Natalia Makarova.
From 1990 to 2002, Baryshnikov was artistic director of the White Oak Dance Project, a touring company he co-founded with Mark Morris. The White Oak Project was formed to create original work for older dancers. In a run ending just short of his 60th birthday in 2007, he appeared in a production of four short plays by Samuel Beckett directed by JoAnne Akalaitis.

Baryshnikov was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999. In 2000, he was awarded the National Medal of Arts.

===2002–present: Baryshnikov Arts Center and awards ===
In 2003, Baryshnikov won the Prix Benois de la Danse for lifetime achievement. In 2005, he launched the Baryshnikov Arts Center in New York. For the duration of the 2006 summer, Baryshnikov went on tour with Hell&#x27;s Kitchen Dance, which was sponsored by the Baryshnikov Arts Center. Featuring works by Baryshnikov Arts Center residents Azsure Barton and Benjamin Millepied, the company toured the United States and Brazil. He has received three honorary degrees: on May 11, 2006, from New York University; on September 28, 2007, from Shenandoah Conservatory of Shenandoah University; and on May 23, 2008, from Montclair State University. In late August 2007, Baryshnikov performed Mats Ek&#x27;s &quot;Place&quot; (&quot;Ställe&quot;) with Ana Laguna at Dansens Hus in Stockholm. In 2012, he received the Vilcek Prize in Dance.

Baryshnikov has performed in Israel three times: in 1996, with the White Oak Dance Project at the Roman theater in Caesarea; in 2010, with Ana Laguna; and in 2011, starring in nine performances of &quot;In Paris&quot;, a show after a short story by Ivan Bunin, at the Suzanne Dellal Center in Tel Aviv. In a 2011 &quot;Haaretz&quot; interview, he expressed opposition to artistic boycotts of Israel and called the enthusiasm for contemporary dance in Israel astounding.

==Film, television and theater==

Baryshnikov made his American television dancing debut in 1976, on the PBS program &quot;In Performance Live from Wolf Trap&quot;. The program is distributed on DVD by Kultur Video.

During the Christmas season of 1977, CBS brought Baryshnikov&#x27;s ABT production of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; to television, with Baryshnikov in the title role, accompanied by ABT performers including Gelsey Kirkland and Alexander Minz. &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; has been presented on TV many times in many different versions, but Baryshnikov&#x27;s version is one of only two to be nominated for an Emmy Award.

Baryshnikov also performed in two Emmy-winning television specials, one on ABC and one on CBS, in which he danced to music from Broadway and Hollywood, respectively. During the 1970s and 1980s, he appeared many times with the ABT on &quot;Live from Lincoln Center&quot; and &quot;Great Performances&quot;. He has also appeared on several telecasts of the Kennedy Center Honors.

Baryshnikov performed in his first film role soon after arriving in New York. He portrayed the character Yuri Kopeikine, a famous, womanizing Russian ballet dancer, in the 1977 film &quot;The Turning Point&quot;, for which he received an Oscar nomination. He co-starred with Gregory Hines and Isabella Rossellini in the 1985 film &quot;White Nights&quot;, choreographed by Twyla Tharp, and was featured in the 1987 film &quot;Dancers.&quot; On television, in the last season of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, he played a Russian artist, Aleksandr Petrovsky, who woos Carrie Bradshaw relentlessly and takes her to Paris. He co-starred in &quot;Company Business&quot; (1991) with Gene Hackman.

An animated TV series, &quot;Mikhail Baryshnikov&#x27;s Stories from My Childhood&quot;, appeared on American PBS networks from 1996 to 1998. The cartoons were produced by the Russian animation house Soyuzmultfilm, and redubbed by American actors, including Jim Belushi, Laura San Giacomo, Harvey Fierstein and Kirsten Dunst. Baryshnikov hosted the show, presenting his favorite folktales, including &quot;Beauty and the Beast: A Tale of the Crimson Flower&quot;, &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;, &quot;The Last Petal&quot; and &quot;The Golden Rooster&quot;. The episodes were also released on home video.

On November 2, 2006, Baryshnikov and chef Alice Waters were featured on an episode of the Sundance Channel&#x27;s original series &quot;Iconoclasts&quot;. The two have a long friendship. They discussed their lifestyles, sources of inspiration, and social projects. During the program, Waters visited Baryshnikov&#x27;s Arts Center in New York City. The Hell&#x27;s Kitchen Dance tour brought him to Berkeley to visit her restaurant &quot;Chez Panisse.&quot; On July 17, 2007, the PBS &quot;News Hour with Jim Lehrer&quot; featured a profile of Baryshnikov and his Arts Center. He appears, uncredited, in the 2014 film &quot;Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit&quot; as Interior Minister Sorokin.

In a continuation of his interest in modern dance, Baryshnikov appeared in a 2015 commercial for the clothing designer Rag &amp; Bone with street dance artist Lil Buck.

=== On stage as an actor===
Baryshnikov is a performer in avant-garde theater. His breakthrough performance in Broadway was in 1989, when he played Gregor Samsa in &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, an adaption of Franz Kafka&#x27;s novel. It earned him a Tony nomination.

In 2004, Baryshnikov appeared in &quot;Forbidden Christmas or The Doctor And The Patient&quot; at New York City&#x27;s Lincoln Center, and in 2007 in &quot;Beckett Shorts&quot; at New York Theatre Workshop. On April 11 to 21, 2012, he starred in &quot;In Paris,&quot; a new play directed by Dmitry Krymov. It was presented on the Santa Monica College Performing Arts Center&#x27;s Broad Stage and co-starred Anna Sinyakina. Baryshnikov then appeared in the stage adaptation of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Man in a Case&quot;. Of the production, he said:

On April 21, 2015, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Baryshnikov was scheduled to perform a reading of poet Joseph Brodsky&#x27;s work in Riga in 2015. The performance was called &quot;Brodsky/Baryshnikov,&quot; was in the original Russian, and premiered on October 15, 2015. Its international tour began in Tel Aviv in January 2016 and it was staged in New York City in March 2016. (Baryshnikov met Brodsky in 1974, soon after Soviet authorities had forced Brodsky to leave his home country and he moved to the United States. They remained friends until Brodsky&#x27;s death in 1996.)

==Personal life==
 Baryshnikov has a daughter, Aleksandra &quot;Shura&quot; Baryshnikova (born 1981), from his relationship with actress Jessica Lange. When Baryshnikov and Lange met, he spoke very little English; they communicated in French instead. He eventually learned English by watching television. From 1982 to 1983 he dated Tuesday Weld, Lange&#x27;s best friend.

Baryshnikov has had a long-term relationship with former ballerina Lisa Rinehart. They have three children together. He told Larry King in 2002 that he did not &quot;believe in marriage in the conventional way&quot;, but he and Rinehart married in 2006.

Baryshnikov endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for president in 2016.

=== Citizenship===
On July 3, 1986, Baryshnikov became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Asked whether he felt like an American, he said, &quot;I like to think like I&#x27;m a man of the world. I feel totally Parisian in Paris. Totally Parisian. I have my place here, a lot of close friends and collaborators here, whom I can really feel like I can talk serious business with them. Human business, not &#x27;business&#x27; business. Paris was always the dream of my childhood. We grew up on French art, like all Russians. America, United States, North America—it&#x27;s a new country. Of course, if somebody would ask me to choose either Paris or New York, I would choose New York. But spiritually, somehow, I love Europe.&quot;

On April 27, 2017, the Republic of Latvia granted Baryshnikov citizenship for extraordinary merits. The application to the Latvian parliament, along with a letter from Baryshnikov in which he expressed his wish to become a Latvian citizen, was submitted on December 21, 2016. He wrote that the decision was based on memories of his first 16 years living in Latvia, which provided the basis for the rest of his life. &quot;It was there that my exposure to the arts led me to discover my future destiny as a performer. Riga still serves as a place where I find artistic inspiration&quot;, Baryshnikov wrote in the letter to the Latvian parliament.

== True Russia Foundation ==
In March 2022, together with economist Sergey Guriyev and writer Boris Akunin, Baryshnikov announced the formation of the True Russia foundation to support victims of the war in Ukraine. Baryshnikov condemned the Russian invasion and wrote an open letter to Vladimir Putin slamming his &quot;world of fear&quot;. In his letter, Baryshnikov wrote that people of culture who promoted Russian art made more for Russia than Putin&#x27;s &quot;not-so-precise weapons&quot;. True Russia also aims to become a trilingual art platform. By the end of March, the initiative had raised more than 1.2 million euros.

<doc id="427627" wikidata="Q1322988" url="?curid=427627" title="Middle power">
<text>A middle power is a state that is not a superpower or a great power, but still exerts influence and plays a significant role in international relations. These countries often possess certain capabilities, such as strong economies, advanced technologies, and diplomatic influence, that allow them to have a voice in global affairs. Middle powers are typically seen as bridge-builders between larger powers, using their diplomatic skills to mediate conflicts and promote cooperation on international issues.

Middle powers play a crucial role in the international system by promoting multilateralism, cooperation, and peaceful resolution of conflicts. They are able to leverage their resources and diplomatic skills to advance their national interests while also contributing to global stability and prosperity. As such, middle powers are an important and often overlooked factor in the complex web of international relations.

The concept of the &quot;middle power&quot; dates back to the origins of the European state system. In the late 16th century, Italian political thinker Giovanni Botero divided the world into three types of states: &quot;grandissime&quot; (great powers), &quot;mezano&quot; (middle powers), and &quot;piccioli&quot; (small powers). According to Botero, a &quot;mezano&quot; or middle power &quot;has sufficient strength and authority to stand on its own without the need of help from others.&quot;

==History and definition==
No agreed standard method defines which states are middle powers, aside from the broad idea that middle powers are states that have a &#x27;moderate&#x27; ability to influence the behaviour of other states, in contrast to small power, which have &#x27;little&#x27; ability to influence. Some researchers use Gross National Product (GNP) statistics to draw lists of middle powers around the world. Economically, middle powers are generally those that are not considered too &quot;big&quot; or too &quot;small&quot;, however that is defined. However, economy is not always the defining factor. Under the original sense of the term, a middle power was one that had some degree of influence globally, but did not dominate in any one area. However, this usage is not universal, and some define middle power to include nations that can be regarded as regional powers.

According to academics at the University of Leicester and University of Nottingham:

Middle power status is usually identified in one of two ways. The traditional and most common way is to aggregate critical physical and material criteria to rank states according to their relative capabilities. Because countries&#x27; capabilities differ, they are categorized as superpowers (or great powers), middle powers or small powers. More recently, it is possible to discern a second method for identifying middle power status by focusing on behavioural attributes. This posits that middle powers can be distinguished from superpowers and smaller powers because of their foreign policy behaviour – middle powers carve out a niche for themselves by pursuing a narrow range and particular types of foreign policy interests. In this way middle powers are countries that use their relative diplomatic skills in the service of international peace and stability.

According to Eduard Jordaan of Singapore Management University:

All middle powers display foreign policy behaviour that stabilises and legitimises the global order, typically through multilateral and cooperative initiatives. However, emerging and traditional middle powers can be distinguished in terms of their mutually-influencing constitutive and behavioural differences. Constitutively, traditional middle powers are wealthy, stable, egalitarian, social democratic and not regionally influential. Behaviourally, they exhibit a weak and ambivalent regional orientation, constructing identities distinct from powerful states in their regions and offer appeasing concessions to pressures for global reform. Emerging middle powers by contrast are semi-peripheral, materially inegalitarian and recently democratised states that demonstrate much regional influence and self-association. Behaviourally, they opt for reformist and not radical global change, exhibit a strong regional orientation favouring regional integration but seek also to construct identities distinct from those of the weak states in their region.

Another definition, by the Middle Powers Initiative (MPI), a program of the Global Security Institute, is that &quot;middle power countries are politically and economically significant, internationally respected countries that have renounced the nuclear arms race, a standing that give them significant international credibility.&quot; Under this definition however, nuclear-armed states like India and Pakistan, and every state participant of the NATO nuclear sharing, would not be middle powers.

===Middle power diplomacy===
According to Laura Neak of the International Studies Association:
Although there is some conceptual ambiguity surrounding the term middle power, middle powers are identified most often by their international behavior–called &#x27;middle power diplomacy&#x27;—the tendency to pursue multilateral solutions to international problems, the tendency to embrace compromise positions in international disputes, and the tendency to embrace notions of &#x27;good international citizenship&#x27; to guide...diplomacy. Middle powers are states who commit their relative affluence, managerial skills, and international prestige to the preservation of the international order and peace. Middle powers help to maintain the international order through coalition-building, by serving as mediators and &quot;go-betweens,&quot; and through international conflict management and resolution activities, such as UN peacekeeping. Middle powers perform these internationalist activities because of an idealistic imperative they associate with being a middle power. The imperative is that the middle powers have a moral responsibility and collective ability to protect the international order from those who would threaten it, including, at times, the great or principal powers. This imperative was particularly profound during the most intense periods of the Cold War.

According to international relations scholar Annette Baker Fox, relationships between middle powers and great powers reveal more intricate behaviors and bargaining schemes than has often been assumed. According to Soeya Yoshihide, &quot;Middle Power does not just mean a state&#x27;s size or military or economic power. Rather, &#x27;middle power diplomacy&#x27; is defined by the issue area where a state invests its resources and knowledge. The Middle Power States avoid a direct confrontation with great powers, but they see themselves as &#x27;moral actors&#x27; and seek their own role in particular issue areas, such as human rights, environment, and arms regulations. Middle powers are the driving force in the process of transnational institutional-building.&quot; At the same time, scholars have identified relations of antagonism and competition between middle powers, as well as their ability to use soft power to attain their goals, as in the case of Egypt-Israeli rivalry in Africa.

Characteristics of middle power diplomacy include:

*Commitment to multilateralism through global institutions and allying with other middle powers.
*High degree of civil society penetration in the country&#x27;s foreign policy.
*A country that reflects and forms its national identity through a &#x27;novel foreign policy&#x27;: Peacekeeping, Human Security, the International Criminal Court, and the Kyoto Protocol

The Middle Powers Initiative highlights the importance of middle powers diplomacy. Through MPI, eight international non-governmental organizations are able to work primarily with middle power governments to encourage and educate the nuclear weapons states to take immediate practical steps that reduce nuclear dangers, and commence negotiations to eliminate nuclear weapons. Middle power countries are particularly influential in issues related to arms control, being that they are politically and economically significant, internationally respected countries that have renounced the nuclear arms race, a standing that gives them significant political credibility.

===Self-defined by states===
The term first entered Canadian political discourse after World War II. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent, for example, called Canada &quot;a power of the middle rank&quot; and helped to lay out the classical definition of Canadian middle power diplomacy. When he was advocating for Canada&#x27;s election to the United Nations Security Council, he said that while &quot;...the special nature of [Canada&#x27;s] relationship to the United Kingdom and the United States complicates our responsibilities,&quot; Canada was not a &quot;satellite&quot; of either but would &quot;continue to make our decisions objectively, in the light of our obligations to our own people and their interest in the welfare of the international community.&quot; Canadian leaders believed Canada was a middle power because it was a junior partner in larger alliances (e.g. NATO, NORAD), was actively involved in resolving disputes outside its own region (e.g. Suez Crisis), was not a former colonial power and therefore neutral in anti-colonial struggles, worked actively in the United Nations to represent the interests of smaller nations and to prevent the dominance of the superpowers (often being elected to the United Nations Security Council for such reasons), and because it was involved in humanitarian and peacekeeping efforts around the world.

In March 2008, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd defined his country&#x27;s foreign policy as one of &quot;middle power diplomacy&quot; along the lines of similar criteria. Australia would &quot;influence international decision-makers&quot; on issues such as &quot;global economic, security and environmental challenges.&quot;

=== Growing significance in the 21st century ===
American political analyst Cliff Kupchan describes middle powers as &quot;countries with significant leverage in geopolitics&quot; but that are &quot;less powerful than the world’s two superpowers—the United States and China.&quot; Nevertheless, Kupchan argues that middle powers—particularly in the Global South—have more power, agency, and &quot;geopolitical heft&quot; in the 21st century (namely the 2020s) than at any time since the Second World War. He identifies Brazil, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Turkey as leading middle powers and describes them as &quot;swing states&quot; that are capable of creating new power dynamics due to their nonalignment with most great powers. Among the shared characteristics of these six nations are membership in the G20; large and fast-growing economies; and active diplomatic involvement in major events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and international climate action.

Kupchan attributes the emergence of stronger middle powers to several historical developments in the international system, including the weaker bipolarity between the U.S. and China (as opposed to the stricter allegiances of the Cold War and the subsequent U.S. hegemony following the collapse of the Soviet Union) and the gradual trend of deglobalization, which has fostered regionalized geopolitical and geoeconomic relationships wherein middle powers have comparatively greater influence; for example, the fragmenting of the international energy market has purportedly given Saudi Arabia, a major energy exporter, far more weight in now-smaller regional markets. Kupchan also notes the ability of these middle powers to capitalize on rivalries between the major powers in order to further their own influence, interests, or foreign policy initiatives.

==Overlaps between great powers and middle powers==
The overlaps between the lists of middle powers and great powers show that there is no unanimous agreement among authorities.

Nations such as China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States are generally considered to be great powers due to their economic, military or strategic importance, their status as recognized nuclear powers and their permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. Academics also commonly cite Germany, India and Japan as great powers, due to their large, advanced economies and global influence rather than military and strategic capabilities; yet some sources have at times referred to these nations as middle powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;European Security After 9/11&#x27;&quot;&gt;P. Shearman, M. Sussex, &quot;European Security After 9/11&quot; (Ashgate, 2004) – According to Shearman and Sussex, both the UK and France were great powers now reduced to middle power status.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some in the field of international relations, such as John Kirton and Roberto Gimeno claim that Italy is a great power due to its status and membership in the G7 and NATO Quint. Moreover, according to a 2014 report by the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies (HCSS), Italy is listed among the great powers. Although broad academic support for India as a great power is uncommon, some in the field of political science, such as Malik Mohan and Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, consider India to be a great power as well. Likewise, Brazil is sometimes referred as a great power due to its economic power and influence, with Italy at times being considered a great power due to these factors as well as its cultural power.

The following eight countries have at some point in the post–Cold War era been considered great powers but also middle powers by academics or other experts:
* 
* 
* 
* 
The United States and China are considered by many scholars to exceed the traditional criterion of great power, or instead to be superpowers, and are therefore not listed.

==List of middle powers==
As with the great powers, there is no unanimous agreement among authorities as to which countries are considered middle powers. Lists are often the subject of much debate and tend to place comparatively large countries (e.g. Argentina) alongside relatively small ones (e.g. Norway). Clearly not all middle powers are of equal status; some are considered regional powers and members of the G20 (e.g. Australia), while others could very easily be considered small powers (e.g. the Czech Republic). Some larger middle powers also play important roles in the United Nations and other international organisations such as the WTO. As a middle power Canada has had considerable influence in world affairs through its peacekeeping efforts in the late 20th century. Canada is known for its strong commitment to international peace and security and is often called upon to serve as a mediator in conflicts.

The following is a list of 53 countries that have been, at some point in time since the post–Cold War era, considered middle powers by academics or other experts (Members of the G-20 major economies are in bold font, except for the EU member states and AU member states which are attended under a collective membership of the EU and AU respectively):

*Africa (7 countries)

<text>Ruth Maria Kelly (born 9 May 1968) is the chair of Water UK, the trade association representing all of the water and wastewater companies of the United Kingdom. 

She was previously a British Labour Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Bolton West from 1997 until she stood down in 2010. Previously, she served as the Secretary of State for Transport, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Minister for Women and Equality and Secretary of State for Education and Skills, serving under both Gordon Brown and Tony Blair.

==Background==
Kelly was born in Limavady, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Her mother was a teacher and her father ran a pharmacy. Her maternal grandfather had been the teacher of a village school in Altishane, County Tyrone. She lived briefly in the Republic of Ireland before moving to England, where she was educated at a number of private schools. She initially attended Edgarley Hall, the preparatory school for Millfield School. She was then educated at the independent Sutton High School, run by the Girls&#x27; Day School Trust (GDST) After being moved up a year and sitting O-levels at Sutton High School at the age of 15, she decided to move back to Ireland to look after her ill grandmother. Her grandmother died after six weeks, but Kelly stayed for a year, living with her aunt and taking A-level French. She returned to England on winning a scholarship to the sixth-form of Westminster School. 

Kelly then enrolled at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, where she studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics in 1986 (having originally won a place to study medicine), graduating in 1989. She then undertook postgraduate study at the London School of Economics, where she was awarded a MSc degree in economics in 1992. 

Kelly taught at University of Navarra, after she joined the Labour Party in 1990, becoming a member of the party&#x27;s Bethnal Green and Stepney constituency party.

She was an economics writer for &quot;The Guardian&quot; from 1990, before becoming deputy head of the Inflation Report Division of the Bank of England in 1994. 

She married Derek John Gadd, a local government officer, in 1996, and they have four children.

===Family history===
Kelly&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Philip Murphy, served as an officer in the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921). In 1922 he was interned by the Government of Northern Ireland. Murphy&#x27;s detention file refers to him as &#x27;quartermaster of the West Fermanagh IRA Battalion&#x27;. He went on hunger strike to protest at his detention. He was released unconditionally in June 1924, when internment ended. Her paternal grandfather Francis (Frank) Kelly joined the Connaught Rangers and served in France during the First World War. After the war, he returned to County Tyrone and took up a post of School Master in Altishane. His first wife died leaving a young family of six. He remarried Mary Agnes and had another six children. One of them James (Seamus) was Ruth&#x27;s father.

===Religion===
Kelly is a practising Roman Catholic, a member of the Opus Dei, and a regular attender at their meetings and events. Her brother, Ronan Kelly, is also a member of the group. Previously, uncertainty existed over Kelly&#x27;s membership; she declined to say whether or not she was a member, saying only that she had received &#x27;spiritual support&#x27; from the organisation.
Kelly is Vice President of the Catholic Union of Great Britain.

== Career as an MP ==
In the 1997 general election, Kelly gained the seat of Bolton West from the Conservatives while heavily pregnant, and gave birth to her first son eleven days later. She gained her place in parliament as Tony Blair became Prime Minister with Labour&#x27;s landslide election victory.

She served on the Treasury Select Committee; she was also appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Agriculture Minister, Nick Brown, from 1998. Kelly was a member of a commission set up by the Institute for Public Policy Research into the Private Finance Initiative, which expressed some scepticism about the operation of the policy.

After Labour won the 2001 general election, Kelly was appointed as Economic Secretary to the Treasury. Her role focused on competition policy and small businesses. After a year she was promoted to be Financial Secretary to the Treasury, giving her responsibility for regulation of the financial services industry. In both positions her principal task was in the thorough revision of the Financial Services regulation system which was introduced by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Kelly brought in new regulations to tackle the funding of terrorism after September 2001 attacks.

Kelly was assigned the task of dealing with Equitable Life after the Penrose Report into the life insurance company was published. She rejected calls for government compensation to Equitable policyholders, on the grounds that the losses arose from actions of the company rather than from any defect of regulation, and that it was still trading. Equitable policyholders continued to demand redress.

As a mother of four young children, she refused to work the long hours normally associated with such positions and refused to take a red box in the evening whilst at the Treasury.

In a minor reshuffle, she was promoted to be Minister for the Cabinet Office on 9 September 2004, replacing Douglas Alexander. Kelly guided the Civil Contingencies Bill through its final stages in Parliament, which faced serious objections from some civil liberties campaigns.

===Party loyalty===
Kelly hardly ever voted against the position of her party and in the most divisive votes over Labour&#x27;s term, she followed the party line. She voted for the Iraq War, and subsequently voted against an independent investigation into the run-up to the war. Kelly also voted for the introduction of tuition top-up fees, in a vote that saw a massive rebellion amongst Labour MPs. She also voted for the introduction of identity cards, voted for replacing Trident, and argued against the addition of a sunset clause in part 2 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. In a free parliamentary vote on 20 May 2008, Kelly voted for cutting the upper limit for abortions from 24 to 12 weeks, along with two other Catholic cabinet ministers Des Browne and Paul Murphy.

==Secretary of State for Education and Skills==
In the reshuffle following the resignation of David Blunkett on 15 December 2004, Kelly entered the Cabinet (also becoming a member of the Privy Council) with the position of Secretary of State for Education and Skills. She became the youngest woman ever to sit in the Cabinet.

The Government&#x27;s Extended Schools policy, which planned to open some schools from 8am to 6pm and provide child-care services for working parents, was dubbed by some as &quot;Kelly hours&quot; after Kelly, although the National Childcare Strategy with before and after-school care funded in most schools by the New Opportunities Fund pre-dated extended schools (and Kelly&#x27;s ministerial tenure) by several years. The extended schools initiative was predicated on wider use of and access to schools as community resources, not just for parents and children. Her proposals in the 2005 white paper to reduce the number and influence of parent governors in trust schools were seen as a partial reversal of this earlier stance.

Kelly attracted considerable criticism by rejecting the proposals of the Tomlinson report on education reform for the 14–19 age group, which suggested replacing A-level exams with a four-tier diploma. After the 2005 election, it was rumoured that she was to be demoted back into her old post at the Treasury and although she kept her position at the DfES, she was said to have been &quot;less than thrilled&quot; by the appointment of Tony Blair&#x27;s adviser Andrew Adonis as a Minister within her department.

===Sex offenders in schools controversy===
On 9 January 2006, it came to light that Kelly&#x27;s department had granted permission for a man who had been cautioned by police for viewing child pornography images and who was on a sex offenders register to be employed at a school, on the basis that he had not been convicted of an offence. He, and an unknown number of others on the sex offenders register, were not on the DfES prohibited list, &quot;List 99&quot;.
On 13 January, Kim Howells, a Minister of State at the DfES, admitted that it was he who had actually made the decision, in accordance with advice given to him by civil servants that the &quot;person did not represent an ongoing threat to children but that he should be given a grave warning&quot;. In response to the critical media coverage surrounding the issue, Downing Street issued a statement confirming their confidence in Kelly and denying rumours that she was to be replaced.

There was further controversy when it transpired that another teacher had been cleared to work at a school, despite the fact that he had been convicted in 1980 for indecent assault on a 15-year-old girl and had been previously removed from three schools. A letter from the Department for Education that suggested the Secretary of State had considered his case and found that although his past actions had been unwise and unacceptable, he had undertaken teaching work to good effect since.

===Trust schools===

A controversy in Kelly&#x27;s time at the DfES was the proposed introduction of trust schools. The Trusts were intended to be non-profit making and to have charitable status, although they could be formed by commercial enterprises. In fact, one of the early DfES-hosted seminars on the establishment of Trusts included representatives from Microsoft and KPMG. However, it was their ability to set their own admission arrangements that generated the most criticism.

A large number of Labour backbenchers, as well as numerous party luminaries like Neil Kinnock and former Education Secretary Estelle Morris, made known their opposition to the proposals and published an alternative white paper. Faced with such a rebellion, the government initially stressed that it would &quot;press on&quot; with the reforms. However, new Tory leader David Cameron unexpectedly announced that these reforms were in line with Tory policies and that he would support the bill if presented in the proposed form. The government were faced with the prospect of pushing through their reforms only with opposition support and in the face of increased resistance from its own supporters.

When the Education and Inspections Bill 2006 was finally published on 28 February 2006, it contained much of what had been trailed, although most notable by its absence was any mention of &quot;trust school&quot;. Foundation and Voluntary Aided schools were left to pick up the mantle of trust schools.

===Religion and political views===
The effect of her religious viewpoint on her opinions regarding controversial scientific questions has been of concern to some scientists who have speculated that her religious views could have an effect on government policy regarding stem cell research.

===Children&#x27;s schooling===
All four of Kelly&#x27;s children started at a Roman Catholic primary school in Wapping, east London. However, on 8 January 2007, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; revealed that she had withdrawn her son from the voluntary aided school, and — following professional advice — sent him to a preparatory school that specialises in the education of boys aged 7–13 with dyslexia and/or developmental coordination disorder. Though the additional cost for specialist support outside the state sector sometimes is covered by the local authority, Kelly stated she has not and will not seek its help in meeting these costs.

According to Ofsted inspection in 2002 &quot;those with special educational needs, make particularly good progress&quot; at English Martyrs Roman Catholic school, and that pupils generally meet &quot;standards that are much better than those gained by pupils in similar schools&quot;. The school achieved the best exam results in the borough of Tower Hamlets and among the best in the UK, with 96% of children reaching the expected standard for English, and 100% for Maths and Science. The area&#x27;s education authority also runs six special needs schools within reach of Kelly&#x27;s home and responded to the controversy saying, &quot;We are proud of the quality of education we offer to all children. We have a strong record in helping children with a wide range of learning needs to succeed.&quot;

Ian Gibson, Labour MP for Norwich North, called the decision &quot;a slap in the face for the teachers and pupils in the school the child has been taken out of&quot;. However, Conservative Party leader David Cameron, whose own disabled son Ivan attended a state special needs school, defended her decision, saying &quot;People should recognise that politicians like everyone else are parents first and will act in the best interests of their children&quot;.

Kelly made a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission about the &quot;Mirror&quot;&#x27;s reporting of the story, but the complaint was rejected, with the PCC ruling that the story was &quot;a matter of considerable public interest&quot;, given that she is &quot;a Cabinet minister – who had previously been Secretary of State for Education and Skills&quot;, and &quot;even if government policy included an acceptance of private schooling for those with special needs, the fact that the complainant did not feel that the current state system could meet her child&#x27;s requirements raised questions about the nature of funded schooling and its ability to cater for children with special needs – including those whose families would not be able to pay for private schooling.&quot;

===Fathers for Justice attacks===
Twice Kelly has been targeted by members of fathers&#x27; rights group Fathers 4 Justice in egg-throwing incidents. The first was in April 2005; protester Simon Wilmot-Coverdale was charged, and in February 2006 Kelly gave evidence at Salford Magistrates Court. As she left the court, she was again attacked, this time by Michael Downe; the egg smashed on the back of her head. Downes was fined and given an ASBO, which he proceeded to rip up outside the court, promising to continue to fight for fathers&#x27; rights.

==Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government==
After the English local elections in May 2006, Kelly was appointed Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, a position created when these functions were split off from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The department also took over the Home Office&#x27;s responsibilities for active communities and civic renewal. She was also given the post of Minister for Women and Equality. Kelly&#x27;s successor at the Department for Education and Skills was Alan Johnson.

On 16 October 2006, she announced that her new role would involve cutting down on extremists within communities.

===Catholic social views and homosexuality===

Kelly&#x27;s staunchly Catholic beliefs and social positions clashed with her Cabinet position as a member of Tony Blair&#x27;s government, which was pushing for a number of progressive reforms and equality for gay and bisexual people. Criticism intensified when Kelly later became Minister for Women and Equality, and criticism was aired on BBC Radio 5 Live and the front page of &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2006 over her stance on homosexuality. Blair&#x27;s government repealed many laws that were perceived as being anti-gay, but Kelly consistently opted out of voting on her party&#x27;s measures. Kelly opposed lowering the age of consent for homosexuality, as well as voting against outlawing discrimination against gay couples adopting children. Out of fourteen votes during the Blair government surrounding the political issues of homosexuality, Kelly had only attended two.

LGBT rights activist Peter Tatchell attacked Kelly for her views on homosexuality, claiming: &quot;Tony Blair would never appoint someone to a race equality post who had a lukewarm record of opposing racism&quot;. In a letter published in &quot;The Times&quot; on 11 May 2006, the Catholic Archbishop of Westminster claimed that attacks on Kelly were anti-Catholic. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O&#x27;Connor wrote &quot;Ms Kelly may well be scrutinised for her fitness in office. That is a political judgement. But her Catholicism should not be a criterion in forming that judgement.&quot;

&quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper reported on 15 October 2006 that Kelly had joined the Prime Minister in seeking to exempt churches from new equality laws which would require Christian churches to treat homosexuality with equal validity to heterosexuality, which Kelly felt went against Catholic teaching. Lorely Burt, the Liberal Democrat Equalities spokesperson, who opposed allowing churches to preach against homosexuality in schools, called for Kelly to be removed from the Cabinet. It was reported in January 2007 that Kelly supported an exemption for Catholic adoption agencies from new laws that would allow them to refuse service to gay couples.

===Planning decisions===
Kelly demonstrated some opposition to the development of skyscrapers from her first months as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. In November 2006, she stopped the Brunswick Quay proposal, which represented over £100 million worth of investment into Liverpool, from going ahead. The final report of the planners who carried out the public inquiry had recommended approval for the project. In December 2006, she called a public inquiry into the 20 Fenchurch Street tower in London&#x27;s financial district, on the basis that a tall building would be &quot;unsuitable for this site&quot;. In May 2007, she blocked a 42-storey, 120-m tower in the New England Quarter development in Brighton, designed by Allies and Morrison and being planned by the Beetham Organization. She approved the building of new homes and businesses in Walker, Newcastle, in a bid to regenerate the area.

==Secretary of State for Transport==
Kelly was appointed to the position in Gordon Brown&#x27;s new cabinet on 27 June in a government reshuffle, though it had been speculated she would be removed from the cabinet. Within a few days of entering her job, she faced tough work as she was responsible for securing the public&#x27;s safety through transport after some attempted terrorist attacks. She came under fire for admitting along with other Labour Ministers that she had smoked cannabis as a teenager.

===Support for biofuels===
Kelly&#x27;s support for biofuels drew criticism from activists who felt that it impoverishes third world farmers to assuage first world environmental guilt. &quot;If people starve because of biofuels, Ruth Kelly and her peers will have killed them,&quot; wrote environmentalist George Monbiot in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. &quot;Like all such crimes, it is perpetrated by cowards, attacking the weak to avoid confronting the strong.&quot;

===Railways===
Kelly announced a major increase of railway capacity by providing extra trains across the country by 2010 which drew criticism for her London bias as most of the funding would be spent there. She gave the go-ahead in 2007 for billions of pounds of public money to be spent on the Crossrail project in London, which caused outrage amongst MPs in other cities, especially Manchester, who had been told that no public transport funding would be given without a congestion charge scheme.

===Heathrow expansion===
Kelly set out proposals for a third runway and a sixth terminal at Heathrow under new extensive plans. Gordon Brown admitted this was one of the biggest challenges which faced the UK Government over the coming years.

===Misuse of public funds===
In November 2007 it emerged that Kelly had misused part of her £10,000 communications allowance for party political material. The funds should have only been used for politically neutral material, and Kelly apologised for breaking the rules.

===Cabinet resignation===
In September 2008, Kelly announced her intention to resign from the cabinet to spend more time with her family. This ended her time as Transport Secretary and cabinet minister after four years. She did not stand at the 2010 general election. Damian McBride, a former senior Labour Party strategist, was shifted from being Gordon Brown&#x27;s political spokesman to Number 10, after criticism of the way he handled Kelly&#x27;s resignation.

==Parliamentary expenses==
On 18 May 2009, Kelly became involved in the MPs&#x27; expenses scandal when the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; revealed she had claimed a total of £31,000 between 2004 and 2008 for rebuilding, refurbishing, and purchasing appliances for her second home. It was subsequently revealed on 21 May 2009 that some of this money was used to repair damage caused by a burst pipe. Kelly was insured for this damage but did not claim on that insurance after being advised by the fees office that a reasonable amount could be claimed under the allowances system.

==Subsequent career==
In May 2010, Kelly became the Global Head of Client Strategy at HSBC.
In 2015, Kelly left HSBC and was appointed to become Pro-Vice Chancellor for Research and Enterprise at St Mary&#x27;s University, Twickenham. Kelly has since left St Mary&#x27;s University and now works for the Vatican on its financial portfolio. In 2010, Kelly supported David Miliband for the leadership of the Labour Party over his brother, Ed. In 2018, she left the Labour Party over the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn after nearly thirty years of membership. In 2022 Kelly joined the right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange. Kelly replaced Anthony Ferrar as chair of Water UK in March 2023.

<doc id="427633" wikidata="Q1748579" url="?curid=427633" title="Rectenna">
<text>A rectenna (rect&quot;ifying ant&quot;enna) is a special type of receiving antenna that is used for converting electromagnetic energy into direct current (DC) electricity. They are used in wireless power transmission systems that transmit power by radio waves. A simple rectenna element consists of a dipole antenna with a diode connected across the dipole elements. The diode rectifies the AC induced in the antenna by the microwaves, to produce DC power, which powers a load connected across the diode. Schottky diodes are usually used because they have the lowest voltage drop and highest speed and therefore have the lowest power losses due to conduction and switching. Large rectennas consist of arrays of many power receiving elements such as dipole antennas.

==Power beaming applications==

The invention of the rectenna in the 1960s made long distance wireless power transmission feasible. The rectenna was invented in 1964 and patented in 1969 by US electrical engineer William C. Brown, who demonstrated it with a model helicopter powered by microwaves transmitted from the ground, received by an attached rectenna. Since the 1970s, one of the major motivations for rectenna research has been to develop a receiving antenna for proposed solar power satellites, which would harvest energy from sunlight in space with solar cells and beam it down to Earth as microwaves to huge rectenna arrays. A proposed military application is to power drone reconnaissance aircraft with microwaves beamed from the ground, allowing them to stay aloft for long periods.
In recent years, interest has turned to using rectennas as power sources for small wireless microelectronic devices. The largest current use of rectennas is in RFID tags, proximity cards and contactless smart cards, which contain an integrated circuit (IC) which is powered by a small rectenna element. When the device is brought near an electronic reader unit, radio waves from the reader are received by the rectenna, powering up the IC, which transmits its data back to the reader.

==Radio frequency rectennas==
The simplest crystal radio receiver, employing an antenna and a demodulating diode (rectifier), is actually a rectenna, although it discards the DC component before sending the signal to the headphones. People living near strong radio transmitters would occasionally discover that with a long receiving antenna, they could get enough electric power to light a light bulb.

However, this example uses only one antenna having a limited capture area. A rectenna array uses multiple antennas spread over a wide area to capture more energy.

Researchers are experimenting with the use of rectennas to power sensors in remote areas and distributed networks of sensors, especially for IoT applications.

RF rectennas are used for several forms of wireless power transfer. In the microwave range, experimental devices have reached a power conversion efficiency of 85–90%. The record conversion efficiency for a rectenna is 90.6% for 2.45 GHz, with lower efficiency of about 82% achieved at 5.82 GHz.

==Optical rectennas==
In principle, similar devices, scaled down to the proportions used in nanotechnology, can be used to convert light directly into electricity. This type of device is called an &quot;optical rectenna&quot; (or &quot;nantenna&quot;). Theoretically, high efficiencies can be maintained as the device shrinks, but to date efficiency has been limited, and so far there has not been convincing evidence that rectification has been achieved at optical frequencies. The University of Missouri previously reported on work to develop low-cost, high-efficiency optical-frequency rectennas. Other prototype devices were investigated in a collaboration between the University of Connecticut and Penn State Altoona using a grant from the National Science Foundation. With the use of atomic layer deposition it has been suggested that conversion efficiencies of solar energy to electricity higher than 70% could eventually be achieved.

The creation of successful optical rectenna technology has two major complicating factors: 

# Fabricating an antenna small enough to couple optical wavelengths. 
# Creating an ultra-fast diode capable of rectifying the high frequency oscillations, at frequency of ~500 THz.

Below are a few examples of potential paths to creating diodes that would be fast enough to rectify optical and near-optical radiation.

A promising path towards creating these ultrafast diodes has been in the form of &quot;geometric diodes&quot;. Graphene geometric diodes have been reported to rectify terahertz radiation. In April 2020, geometric diodes were reported in silicon nanowires. The wires were shown experimentally to rectify up to 40 GHz, that result was the limit of the instrument used, and the wires theoretically may be able to rectify signals in the terahertz region as well.

<doc id="427635" wikidata="Q4892411" url="?curid=427635" title="Berlin Conference (1954)">
<text>The Berlin Conference of 1954 was a meeting of the &quot;Big Four&quot; foreign ministers of the United States (John Foster Dulles), Britain (Anthony Eden), France (Georges Bidault), and the Soviet Union (Vyacheslav Molotov) from 25 January to 18 February 1954.

The ministers agreed to call a wider international conference to discuss a settlement to the recent Korean War and the ongoing First Indochina War between France and the Viet Minh, but it failed to reach agreement on issues of European security and the international status of Germany and Austria, then under four-power occupation after World War II.

The meeting was an early fruit of the first period of US-Soviet &quot;détente&quot; or &quot;thaw&quot; during the Cold War. Little progress was made except with Austria from which the Soviets agreed to withdraw if it were made a neutral country. Later that year, Geneva Conference produced a temporary peace in Indochina and France&#x27;s withdrawal from Vietnam, but formal peace in Korea remained elusive.

Some effects of the Berlin Conference were that the leaders were unable to reach an agreement. There was a &quot;fear of freedom&quot; between the East and the West on matters such as free elections in Germany and Austria. The Soviet Union was not willing to place any trust in either country. Eight weeks from the end of the conference, they planned the Geneva Conference.

<doc id="427637" wikidata="Q11964715" url="?curid=427637" title="Courts of Denmark">
<text>The Courts of Denmark (, , ) is the ordinary court system of the Kingdom of Denmark. The Courts of Denmark as an organizational entity was created with the Police and Judiciary Reform Act () taking effect 1 January 2007 which also significantly reformed the court system e.g. by removing original jurisdiction from the High Courts and by introducing a new jury system.

The Courts of Denmark is composed of the ordinary courts consisting of the Supreme Court (), the three high courts: the Western High Court (&quot;Vestre Landsret&quot;) the Eastern High Court (&quot;Østre Landsret&quot;), the High Court of Greenland (, ), the Maritime and Commercial Court (), the Court of Judicial Registration (), the Special Court of Indictment and Revision (), the 24 district courts, the Court of the Faroe Islands, The Court in Greenland and the four Greenlandic Circuit Courts. Part of the Courts of Denmark are also three boards: the Appeals Permission Board (), the Sideline Employment Board and the Judicial Appointment Council. Finally the Danish Court Administration is vested with the joint administration of the whole organization.

The courts of Greenland and the Faroe Islands constitute semi-autonomous parts of the Courts of Denmark and are governed by separate but largely similar procedural codes.

Outside the ordinary court system and the joint administration framework of the Courts of Denmark, a separate collective labour dispute court system exists and a number of quasi-judicial bodies exist, some of which are exempt from judicial oversight.

== The Courts of Justice ==

In accordance with Article 3 of the Danish Constitution, all judicial authority is vested in the courts of justice. The constitution also provides that only judges of the court may pass judgements, whereas parliamentary commissions may only investigate.

The Danish system of courts is based on a unified structure, in which there are no special or constitutional courts of law, as well as no formal division within the courts. As a rule, all courts of law may adjudicate disputes in legal areas such as civil, labour, administrative, and constitutional law, as well as criminal justice.

Judicial action against ministers and/or former ministers, in cases surrounding their dealings as minister, are however handled by a Court of Impeachment of the Realm (), composed of Supreme Court judges and members of parliament.

The Court of Indictment and Revision () handles complaints regarding procedure, disqualification of judges, etc. brought by the users of the courts, against the courts.

Proceedings are oral in general and open to the public in the lower courts, and always oral in the Supreme Court. Media transmissions from within the court are prohibited, unless allowed by the presiding judge.

The general structure of the judicial system is inspired by the traditions of continental Europe.

The Administration of Justice Act of 1916 (), the only Danish legal code, contains almost 1,000 articles, defining the administration and organisation of the courts, covering fields of both civil and criminal procedure. The Act has undergone substantial changes since its enactment in 1916.

== Structure ==

From 1 January 2007, the Danish courts are composed of the Supreme Court (), the two high courts (), the Copenhagen Maritime and Commercial Court ( (national jurisdiction)), the Land Registration Court, 24 district courts (), the courts of the Faroe Islands and Greenland, the Appeals Permission Board, the Danish Judicial Appointments Council, and the Danish Court Administration.

Furthermore, the Danish Constitution provides for the Court of Impeachment of the Realm () to hear cases brought against ministers concerning their administration. In addition, the Special Court of Final Appeal () deals with cases concerning disciplinary sanctions against judges and petitions for retrial of criminal cases under Article 86 of the Administration of Justice Act.

The Danish courts exercise the judicial powers of government and resolve related issues, including probate, bankruptcy, enforcement, land registration, and administrative issues.

All judges are jurists. Lay judges may be of any profession, except they may not be attorneys, members of the clergy, or acting civil servants, and it is considered of good practice for none to be jurists.

=== Reform ===
A gradual reform of the lower courts, which began in late 2005, was a significant overhaul of the Danish judicial system. This reform, known as the Police and Judiciary Reform Act, took full effect on January 1, 2007, and introduced several key changes to the structure and functioning of the courts.

* The number of district courts was reduced from 82 to 24, creating larger courts covering wider geographical areas and serving a greater population base.
* Nearly all cases, both civil and criminal, are now tried by district courts as the court of first instance. This change removed original jurisdiction from the High Courts.
* Civil cases in district courts may now be tried by a panel of judges or by a judge assisted by experts, providing more flexibility in case management.
* The reform introduced a new jury system for criminal cases in district courts.
* More flexible rules of procedure were implemented for civil cases, allowing for more efficient management of the preparatory phase.
* A simplified procedure was introduced for civil small-claims cases involving amounts less than DKK 50,000.

=== County courts and the role of county court judges ===
The composition of the county courts varies but is regulated by law. The Copenhagen County Court has 49 judges and a president, whilst Aarhus, Odense, Aalborg, and Roskilde county courts have a president and fifteen, ten, ten, and seven other judges, respectively. 29 jurisdictions have two to four judges, whilst the last 50 jurisdictions have only one judge.

At the preparatory and trial stages of civil cases only one judge presides. In criminal cases where the defendant pleads guilty to all charges presented against him or her, or when the prosecution does not ask for a sentence in excess of a fine, the case is also presided by a single judge. In criminal cases where this is not the case, the judge sits with two lay judges. Special rules regarding appointment of lay judges apply to maritime cases.

In cases where lay judges sit with the judge, decisions are adopted by simple majority.

In addition to their normal duties, county court judges act as notary public and bailiffs (in particular, the &quot;fogedret&quot; sees to the enforcement of judgments and legal claims), as well as administrators of bankruptcy proceedings and probate matters. Furthermore, they administer the local land registry. In regard to the administrative tasks, these functions may be assigned to an assessor, which is a deputy judge. An electronic reform of the land registry system is being implemented, making the system entirely electronic.

All nuptial agreements and the car-ownership registry are controlled and administered by Aarhus County Court.

=== High courts ===

The high courts function as appellate courts for cases from the subordinate courts. A county court decision can be appealed to a high court if the disputed claim exceeds DKK 20,000. If the matter has an economic value of less than DKK 20,000 an appeal require permission from the . A high court may dismiss an appeal if the appealed case does not relate to a question of principle or if for other reasons the High Court deems that the appeal should not be brought for a high court.

Denmark has three high courts. The High Court of Western Denmark (Vestre Landsret) sits in Viborg but has chambers in larger western cities. It has jurisdiction over all county courts in Jutland. It has one President and 38 judges.
The High Court of Eastern Denmark (Østre Landsret) sits in Copenhagen but has chambers in larger eastern cities. It has jurisdiction over all county courts outside the Jutland peninsula, as well as the County Court for the Faroe Islands. It has one president and 63 judges. The high courts are only set in chambers outside Viborg and Copenhagen in criminal cases. All civil cases are brought before the high courts in either Viborg or Copenhagen. 

The High Court of Greenland (, ) sitting in Nuuk has appellate jurisdiction over the inferior courts of Greenland consisting of the four circuit courts and the Court in Greenland. It consists of a single judge, the High Court Judge in Greenland (, ) but is joined by two high court judges from the other high courts in cases appealed from Court in Greenland.

The high courts are split into chambers, each consisting of three high court judges (), one of which may be a high court judge pro tempore (). Every case is assigned a chamber and a panel of three judges is constituted to hear the case, usually composed of the three judges of the chamber but it may also be composed of judges across the chambers or of more than three judges. Though the President of the High Court appoints a presiding judge for each chamber, all decisions are reached by a simple majority except in jury trials where a qualified majority is necessary for a guilty verdict.

As a criminal appellate court in appealed cases where lay judges have taken part in the county court trial, the high court is composed of three high court judges and three lay judges. In cases where special knowledge is needed, i.e. cases regarding removal of children from their parents, specialists may appear as judges. In jury trials appealed to the high court the court is composed of three judges and nine jurors.

=== Supreme Court ===

The Supreme Court functions as a civil and criminal appellate court for cases from the subordinate courts. Since a decision cannot normally be appealed more than once, county court cases rarely reach Supreme Court-level, though this may be the case if the independent Board of Appeals grants a leave of appeal.

The Supreme Court was founded on 14 February 1661 by King Frederik III, yet can trace its roots back even further to the now-defunct King&#x27;s Court of King Christian IV (). As its name indicates, the Supreme Court is the highest court in the Kingdom of Denmark and its judgments cannot be appealed to another Danish court. It is split into two chambers which both hear all types of cases. A case is heard by at least five judges. In all, the court consists of normally fifteen judges and a president.

Unlike criminal cases in the lower courts, the Supreme Court does not deal with the issue of guilt. However, the basis on which the lower court reached its verdict may be brought into consideration and edited. In criminal trials by jury in the first instance, the defence may appeal on grounds of judicial error regarding the judges&#x27; direction to the jury (the summing-up of the theoretical foundations, which should be taken into consideration when the jurors deliberate).

== Independent administration ==
Articles 62 and 64 of the Danish Constitution ensure judicial independence from the government and Parliament by providing that judges shall only be guided by the law, including acts, statutes, and practice.

=== Administration of the courts ===
With more than 2,600 employees (including approximately 1,850 clerks), the Danish Court Administration was formed on 1 July 1999 following the Court Administration Act, 1998. As a result, the responsibility of administering the justice system and courts was removed from the Ministry of Justice and given to a newly formed, independent Court Administration (), thereby securing separation of the judicial and executive branches of government.

=== Appointment of judges ===
As of 2011, there are approximately 380 judges. All judges except for the President of the Supreme Court are appointed by the reigning monarch, following recommendations (orders) from the Minister of Justice on the advice of the Judicial Appointments Council. To date, the advice of the council has always been followed.

The Judicial Appointments Council, like the Court Administration, was formed in 1999, and facilitates the recruitment of judges from all branches of the legal profession. Before 1999, it was felt that too many judges had a career background within the Ministry of Justice.

Likewise, the council was set up to ensure independence from the other branches of government. Even though it is funded via the annual Budget Act, the council enjoys full independence from all three branches of government.

=== Removal of judges ===
Article 64 of the Danish Constitution guarantees the personal independence of judges by protecting them from removal and transfer by the administration by vesting the power to remove judges in the courts themselves. Removal may only take place in instances of gross misconduct or lasting physical or psychological illnesses. Such dismissals are decided by The Special Court of Indictment and Revision, which consists of one judge each from the Supreme Court, a high court, and a county court. The verdict may be appealed to the Supreme Court.

<doc id="427640" wikidata="Q6152441" url="?curid=427640" title="Jane Kennedy (politician)">
<text>Jane Elizabeth Kennedy ( Hodgson; born 4 May 1958) is a British politician and the inaugural Merseyside Police and Crime Commissioner. She was Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool Wavertree, formerly Liverpool Broadgreen, from 1992 to 2010.

Formerly a member of the Government, on 8 June 2009, she returned to the backbenches leaving her position as Minister of State for Farming and the Environment at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

Originally a member of the Labour Party, she left the party in March 2019 after the resignation of her successor, Luciana Berger MP, and the announcement that former Liverpool City councillor Derek Hatton – a former member of the Militant tendency – had been re-admitted to party membership.

==Early life==
She was born in Whitehaven, Cumberland, and attended Haughton Comprehensive School (now part of the &#x27;Education Village&#x27;) on &quot;Rockwell Avenue&quot; in Haughton Le Skerne, then Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College in Darlington. She studied chemistry at the University of Liverpool from 1976 until 1978, however did not graduate from her studies, deciding to marry and settle with her family in Liverpool. She worked in social care for Liverpool City Council from 1979 to 1988, and in 1988 she became a trade union Area Organiser for the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE) until 1992. In Liverpool she had been active in ending the Militant group&#x27;s infiltration of the Liverpool Labour Party.

==Member of Parliament==
Kennedy had been a Member of Parliament since the 1992 general election, when she was elected for the Liverpool Broadgreen constituency. She served as a member of the social security select committee from 1992 to 1994, and in 1995 she was appointed as a Labour whip.

Her constituency was abolished for the 1997 general election, but she was returned to Parliament for the new Liverpool Wavertree constituency. Following Labour&#x27;s victory in the 1997 election, she served as an assistant government whip until 1998 and as a government whip until 1999, sitting on the House of Commons administration select committee from 1997 until 1999.

On 9 November 2009 she announced she would be standing down at the 2010 general election. It was announced in January 2010 the Wavertree Labour Party had picked Luciana Berger as the candidate to succeed her. This selection caused some controversy because Berger had stayed at Kennedy&#x27;s home for a period before the selection, a home Kennedy shares with her partner Peter Dowling, the local Labour Party&#x27;s agent.

===In government===
Kennedy was appointed as a junior minister in the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department from 1999 until 2001, when she became a Minister of State in the Northern Ireland Office with responsibility for security and the justice system. Following the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly in October 2002, she also became responsible for education and employment in the province. In 2003, she was made a Privy Councillor.

She transferred to the Department for Work and Pensions in 2004 and then to the Department of Health after the 2005 general election, remaining a Minister of State. She left the government on 5 May 2006 during a wide-ranging reshuffle. She was initially thought by journalists to have been sacked; however, she subsequently said she took the opportunity to resign from the government in light of concerns about the impact of the government&#x27;s policies on the National Health Service.

In Gordon Brown&#x27;s first government since becoming Prime Minister, Kennedy was appointed as the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, becoming the third ranked minister in the Treasury, taking on the ministerial responsibilities of the old Paymaster General, Dawn Primarolo. On 5 October 2008, Kennedy was promoted to Minister of State at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs with the portfolio of Farming and the Environment. She resigned that position in June 2009 in protest at Gordon Brown&#x27;s Leadership.

==Police and Crime Commissioner==
Kennedy was elected to the post of Merseyside Police and Crime Commissioner on 15 November 2012. She was re-elected in 2016.

==Expenses row==
In 2009 the Houses of Parliament started publishing MP expenses. Her partner Peter Dowling worked at her office handling research and parliamentary affairs, and was paid out of her parliamentary expenses.

==Personal life==
Jane married Malcolm Kennedy in 1977 in Knowsley; they divorced in 1998. They have two sons, Robert (born 1978) and Alan (born 1983). She currently lives with her partner Peter Dowling.

<doc id="427643" wikidata="Q3182711" url="?curid=427643" title="John Wentworth (lieutenant governor, born 1671)">
<text>John Wentworth (January 16, 1671 – December 12, 1730) was an American politician, judge and colonial administrator who served as the lieutenant governor of New Hampshire from 1717 to 1730.

==Early life==

He was a grandson of &quot;Elder&quot; William Wentworth (born at Alford, Lincolnshire, England, in 1615; died in Dover, New Hampshire, March 16, 1697), an early settler in New England. William was a follower of the Rev. John Wheelwright. With him and 33 others, William signed, August 4, 1639, “A Combination for a Government at Exeter, N. H.” William moved to Wells, Maine, with Wheelwright; and when the latter went to England on the accession of Oliver Cromwell to power, William moved to Dover, where he was a ruling elder and often preached. On his death, he left a widow, nine sons, and one daughter.

==Political career==

John Wentworth was raised to be a sea captain. In 1712 he was appointed by Queen Anne a councillor for New Hampshire; in 1713 he became a justice of the common pleas, and late in 1717 lieutenant governor. Before New Hampshire received its own Royal Governor in 1741, its governors were also commissioned to govern the neighboring Province of Massachusetts Bay, where they spent most of their time. Consequently, the lieutenant governors exercised significant power. As lieutenant governor, John Wentworth had little function in the government for several years. Then in January 1723, Governor Samuel Shute abruptly returned to England, so Wentworth took over in New Hampshire, governing until the arrival of Shute&#x27;s replacement, William Burnet, in 1728. He continued as Lt. Governor until his death in 1730, again governing between Burnet&#x27;s death in 1729 and the arrival of Jonathan Belcher in 1730. During his administration he brought focus on the border dispute between New Hampshire and Massachusetts, cultivating power centers in London that eventually led to resolution of that dispute (albeit in 1740, long after his death), and establishing the dynasty that would dominate New Hampshire until independence.

==Family==
On October 12, 1693 Wentworth married Sara Hunking. The couple had thirteen children, three of whom (Samuel, Benning, and Mark Hunking Wentworth) would become prominent themselves. Benning Wentworth was later the first directly appointed royal governor of New Hampshire. Mark&#x27;s son in his turn would also become the last royal governor, Sir John Wentworth, 1st Baronet.

<text>Simon Robert Key (22 April 1945 – 3 February 2023) was a British Conservative politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Salisbury from 1983 to 2010. He was also Chair of Governors at Salisbury Cathedral School.

==Early life==
Key was born in Plymouth, the son of Maurice Key, afterwards Bishop of Truro. At the age of 10, he was part of a school walk on Swanage Beach in Dorset where he and six friends discovered an old wartime mine which detonated; only Key and one other boy survived. He went to Salisbury Cathedral School, then independent Sherborne School. He studied economics at Clare College, Cambridge, receiving an MA and CertEd. He taught at the Loretto School in Edinburgh from 1967 to 1969, then taught economics at Harrow School from 1969 to 1983.

==Political career==
Key contested the Holborn and St Pancras South seat in 1979. He was the Member of Parliament for Salisbury between 1983 and 2010 and was Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities in the Department of the Environment (now DEFRA) from 1990 to 1992, setting up the Inner Cities Religious Council in 1991, and was Minister for Sport at the Department of National Heritage (now Culture, Media and Sport) from 1992 to 1993. He was Minister for Roads and Traffic from 1993 to 1994.

In opposition, Key served as a front-bench spokesman during the leaderships of William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith. In 2001, he was the shadow minister for Science and Energy, and in July 2002, he was the shadow minister for International Development. He stood down from this position in June 2003, returning to the backbenches but retaining his membership of the Defence Select Committee.

In 2005, he won re-election with an increased majority. From 1994 until 2001, he was a Director of Hortichem (now Certis UK since 2001) in Amesbury.

On 2 December 2009, Key announced his decision to stand down at the next general election.

==Personal life==
Robert Key was the son of Maurice Key, who was the 10th Bishop of Truro from 1960 to 1973, as well as the Bishop of Sherborne from 1947 until 1960.

Key married Susan Irvine in 1968 in Perth. They had two sons (one of whom died in infancy) and two daughters and lived in Harnham. He was a committed choral singer and member of the General Synod of the Church of England.

Key died in Wiltshire on 3 February 2023, at the age of 77.

<text>Piara Singh Khabra (Punjabi: ; 20 November 1921 – 19 June 2007) was a Punjabi-British Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Ealing Southall from 1992 until his death. He was the fifth British Asian, and the first Sikh, to become a British MP.

From the retirement of Sir Edward Heath in 2001 until his death, Khabra was the oldest MP sitting in the House of Commons, and was the last sitting MP to have served in the Commonwealth&#x27;s forces during the Second World War.

==Background==
Piara Singh Khabra was born into a Punjabi Sikh farming family of the Khabra clan in the Punjab Province of British India. Khabra gave his year of birth as 1924, but his marriage certificate dated it as 1921.
He joined the Communist Party of India, and became a teacher in an elementary school. He requalified in 1964, becoming an elementary teacher and then a social worker. He also became the President of the Indian Workers&#x27; Association, which assisted Indian immigrants to establish themselves and find jobs, and was active in opposition to the far right.

He left the Communist Party of Great Britain in the 1960s, and joined the Labour Party in 1972. He became a justice of the peace in 1977, and was elected as a member of Ealing Council in 1978. He briefly joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981, leaving two years later and returning to Labour in 1988.

==Parliamentary career==
He entered Parliament aged 70 at the 1992 election, the fifth Asian MP and inherited a large majority in the safe Labour seat of Ealing Southall, following Labour&#x27;s de-selection of the long-serving sitting MP Sydney Bidwell. He claimed to have the largest caseload of immigration and asylum cases of any MP. He maintained good attendance and voting records, but very rarely spoke in Parliament. He said he was proud to speak on the report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, and on the Race Relations Amendment Act 2000.

Khabra was a strong supporter of people with autism spectrum disorders. He sponsored one of the most successful early day motions on autism in the 2002 Autism Awareness Year; it was supported by 153 parliamentarians of all parties. Khabra backed the work of the Autism Awareness Campaign UK.

How Khabra voted on key issues from 2001 to 2007:
*Voted very strongly for the Iraq War
*Voted very strongly for university tuition fees
*Voted very strongly for Labour&#x27;s anti-terrorism laws
*Voted very strongly for introducing ID cards
*Voted very strongly for replacing Trident
*Voted very strongly for the hunting ban
*Voted strongly for equal LGBT rights
*Voted strongly for a stricter asylum system
*Voted for more EU integration
*Voted moderately for laws to stop climate change
*Voted moderately for introducing foundation hospitals
*Voted moderately for a smoking ban
*Voted moderately for removing hereditary peers from the House of Lords
*Voted a mixture of for and against greater autonomy for schools
*Voted moderately against a wholly elected House of Lords
*Voted very strongly against an investigation into the Iraq War

==Controversy==
Khabra was known to have made several controversial statements. In the run-up to the 2001 general election, he suggested that Avtar Lit, chairman of Sunrise Radio and an independent challenger for his seat, should be &quot;sent back to India&quot;.

In 2002, Khabra also claimed that the local Somali population was behind a recent crime wave in Southall. Somali activists responded to these criticisms by suggesting that their community was being targeted by some Asians who were attempting to drive them out of the area. Ealing Police also indicated that they did not believe Somali youths were responsible for the string of street robberies in question.

==Retirement and death==
In late 2006, Khabra announced that he would stand down at the next general election.

Khabra died as a result of liver problems on the night of 19 June 2007 at Hammersmith Hospital in White City within Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, West London; where he had been being treated for abscesses on the liver since April.

He customarily gave his year of birth as 1924; birth registration was not compulsory in the Indian state of Punjab until 1970 and so no birth certificate exists, but on his marriage certificate his year of birth was recorded as 1921.

He was married twice. His first wife died in 1985 in Canada where she was living with his son, and he remarried in 1990. He was survived by his second wife, Beulah Marian, and his son from his first marriage.

<doc id="427655" wikidata="Q19740" url="?curid=427655" title="Boletus edulis">
<text>Boletus edulis (English: cep, penny bun, porcino or porcini) is a basidiomycete fungus, and the type species of the genus &quot;Boletus&quot;. 

Prized as an ingredient in various culinary dishes, &quot;B. edulis&quot; is an edible mushroom held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto. The mushroom is low in fat and digestible carbohydrates, and high in protein, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Although it is sold commercially, it is very difficult to cultivate. Available fresh in autumn throughout Europe and Russia, it is most often dried, packaged, and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. &quot;B. edulis&quot; is also one of the few fungi sold pickled.

The fungus grows in deciduous and coniferous forests and tree plantations, forming symbiotic ectomycorrhizal associations with living trees by enveloping the tree&#x27;s underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. The fungus produces spore-bearing fruit bodies above ground in summer and autumn. The fruit body has a large brown cap which on occasion can reach , rarely in diameter and in weight. Like other boletes, it has tubes extending downward from the underside of the cap, rather than gills; spores escape at maturity through the tube openings, or pores. The pore surface of the &quot;B. edulis&quot; fruit body is whitish when young, but ages to a greenish-yellow. The stout stipe, or stem, is white or yellowish in colour, up to , rarely tall and thick, and partially covered with a raised network pattern, or .

Widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere across Europe, Asia, and North America, it does not occur naturally in the Southern Hemisphere, although it has been introduced to southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil. Several closely related European mushrooms formerly thought to be varieties or forms of &quot;B. edulis&quot; have been shown using molecular phylogenetic analysis to be distinct species, and others previously classed as separate species are with this species. The western North American species commonly known as the California king bolete (&quot;Boletus edulis&quot; var. &quot;grandedulis&quot;) is a large, darker-coloured variant first formally identified in 2007.

==Taxonomy==

&quot;Boletus edulis&quot; was first described in 1782 by the French botanist Pierre Bulliard and still bears its original name. The starting date of fungal taxonomy had been set as January 1, 1821, to coincide with the date of the works of the &#x27;father of mycology&#x27;, Swedish naturalist Elias Magnus Fries, which meant the name required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid, as Bulliard&#x27;s work preceded this date. It was thus written &quot;Boletus edulis&quot; Bull.:Fr. A 1987 revision of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature set the starting date at May 1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus&#x27; work, the &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. Hence, the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries&#x27; authority. Early alternate names include &quot;Boletus solidus&quot; by English naturalist James Sowerby in 1809, and Gray&#x27;s &quot;Leccinum edule&quot;. Gray&#x27;s transfer of the species to &quot;Leccinum&quot; was later determined to be inconsistent with the rules of botanical nomenclature, and he apparently was unfamiliar with the earlier works of Fries when he published his arrangement of bolete species.

&quot;Boletus edulis&quot; is the type species of the genus &quot;Boletus&quot;. In Rolf Singer&#x27;s classification of the Agaricales mushrooms, it is also the type species of section &quot;Boletus&quot;, a grouping of about 30 related boletes united by several characteristics: a mild-tasting, white flesh that does not change colour when exposed to air; a smooth to distinctly raised, netted pattern over at least the uppermost portion of the stem; a yellow-brown or olive-brown spore print; white tubes that later become yellowish then greenish, which initially appear to be stuffed with cotton; and cystidia that are not strongly coloured. Molecular analysis published in 1997 established that the bolete mushrooms are all derived from a common ancestor, and established the Boletales as an order separate from the Agaricales.

The generic name is derived from the Latin term &quot;bōlētus&quot; &quot;mushroom&quot;, which was borrowed in turn from the Ancient Greek βωλίτης, &quot;terrestrial fungus&quot;. Ultimately, this last word derives from &quot;bōlos&quot;/βῶλος &quot;lump&quot;, &quot;clod&quot;, and, metaphorically, &quot;mushroom&quot;. The βωλίτης of Galen, like the &quot;boletus&quot; of Latin writers like Martial, Seneca and Petronius, is often identified as the much prized &quot;Amanita caesarea&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;edulis&quot; in Latin means &quot;eatable&quot; or &quot;edible&quot;.

===Common names===
Common names for &quot;B. edulis&quot; vary by region. The standard Italian name, &quot;porcino&quot; (pl. &quot;porcini&quot;), means &quot;;&quot; &quot;fungo porcino&quot;, in Italian, echoes the term &quot;suilli&quot;, literally &quot;hog mushrooms&quot;, a term used by the Ancient Romans and still in use in southern Italian terms for this species. The derivation has been ascribed to the resemblance of young fruit bodies to piglets, or to the fondness pigs have for eating them. It is also known as &quot;king bolete&quot;. The English &quot;penny bun&quot; refers to its rounded brownish shape. The German name &quot;Steinpilz&quot; (stone mushroom) refers to the species&#x27; firm flesh. In Austria, it is called &quot;Herrenpilz&quot;, the &quot;noble mushroom&quot;, while in Mexico, the Spanish name is &quot;panza&quot;, meaning &quot;belly&quot;. Another Spanish name, &quot;rodellon&quot;, means &quot;small round boulder&quot;, while the Dutch name &quot;eekhoorntjesbrood&quot; means &quot;squirrel&#x27;s bread&quot;. Russian names are &quot;belyy grib&quot; (:ru:белый гриб; &quot;white mushroom&quot; as opposed to less valuable &quot;black mushrooms&quot;) and &quot;borovik&quot; (:ru:боровик; from &quot;bor&quot;—&quot;pine forest&quot;).
The vernacular name &quot;cep&quot; is derived from the Catalan &quot;cep&quot; or its French name &quot;cèpe&quot;, although the latter is a generic term applying to several related species. In France, it is more fully &quot;cèpe de Bordeaux&quot;, derived from the Gascon &quot;cep&quot; &quot;trunk&quot; for its fat stalk, ultimately from the Latin &quot;cippus&quot; &quot;stake&quot;. &quot;Ceppatello&quot;, &quot;ceppatello buono&quot;, &quot;ceppatello bianco&quot;, &quot;giallo leonato&quot;, &quot;ghezzo&quot;, and &quot;moreccio&quot; are names from Italian dialects, and &quot;ciurenys&quot; or &quot;surenys&quot; is another term in Catalan. The French-born King Charles XIV John popularised &quot;B. edulis&quot; in Sweden after 1818, and is honoured in the local vernacular name &quot;Karljohanssvamp&quot;, as well as the Danish name &quot;Karl Johan svamp&quot;. The monarch cultivated the fungus about his residence, Rosersberg Palace. The Finnish name is &quot;herkkutatti&quot;, from &quot;herkku&quot; &#x27;delicacy&#x27;, and &quot;tatti&quot;, &#x27;bolete&#x27;.

==Description==
The cap of this mushroom is broad at maturity. Slightly sticky to touch, it is convex in shape when young and flattens with age. The colour is generally reddish-brown fading to white in areas near the margin, and continues to darken as it matures. The stipe, or stem, is in height, and up to thick—rather large in comparison to the cap; it is club-shaped, or bulges out in the middle. It is finely on the upper portion, but smooth or irregularly ridged on the lower part. The under surface of the cap is made of thin tubes, the site of spore production; they are deep, and whitish in colour when young, but mature to a greenish-yellow. The angular pores, which do not stain when bruised, are small—roughly 2 to 3 pores per millimetre. In youth, the pores are white and appear as if stuffed with cotton (which are actually mycelia); as they age, they change colour to yellow and later to brown. The spore print is olive brown. The flesh of the fruit body is white, thick and firm when young, but becomes somewhat spongy with age. When bruised or cut, it either does not change colour, or turns a very light brown or light red. Fully mature specimens can weigh about ; a huge specimen collected on the Isle of Skye, Scotland, in 1995 bore a cap of , with a stipe in height and wide, and weighed . A similarly sized specimen found in Poland in 2013 made international news.

&quot;Boletus edulis&quot; is considered one of the safest wild mushrooms to pick for the table, as few poisonous species closely resemble it, and those that do may be easily distinguished by careful examination. The most similar poisonous mushroom may be the devil&#x27;s bolete (&quot;Rubroboletus satanas&quot;), which has a similar shape, but has a red stem and stains blue on bruising. It is often confused with the very bitter and unpalatable &quot;Tylopilus felleus&quot;, but can be distinguished by the reticulation on the stalk; in porcini, it is a whitish, net-like pattern on a brownish stalk, whereas it is a dark pattern on white in the latter. Porcini have whitish pores while the other has pink. If in doubt, tasting a tiny bit of flesh will yield a bitter taste. It can also resemble the &quot;bolete-like&quot; &quot;Gyroporus castaneus&quot;, which is generally smaller, and has a browner stem. &quot;Boletus huronensis,&quot; an uncommon mushroom of northeastern North America, is another recognized look-alike known to cause severe gastrointestinal disorders.

The spores are elliptical to spindle-shaped, with dimensions of 12–17 by 5–7 μm. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are produced in a layer lining the tubes, and arrange themselves so their ends are facing the center of the tube; this layer of cells is known technically as a hymenium. The basidia are thin-walled, mostly attached to four spores, and measure 25–30 by 8–10 μm. Another cell type present in the hymenium is the cystidia, larger sterile cells that protrude beyond the basidia into the lumen of the hymenium, and act as air traps, regulating humidity. &quot;B. edulis&quot; has pleurocystidia (cystidia located on the face of a pore) that are thin-walled, roughly spindle-shaped to ventricose, and measure 30–45 by 7–10 μm; the &quot;stuffed&quot; feature of the hymenium is caused by cheilocystidia—cells found on the edges of the pores. The hyphae of &quot;B. edulis&quot; do not have clamp connections.

===Related species===

Several similar brownish-coloured species are sometimes considered subspecies or forms of this mushroom. In Europe, in addition to &quot;B. edulis&quot; (or &quot;cèpe de Bordeaux&quot;), the most popular are:
*&quot;Cèpe bronzé&quot; (&quot;dark cep&quot;; &quot;Boletus aereus&quot;), much rarer than &quot;B. edulis&quot;, is more highly regarded by gourmets, and consequently more expensive. Usually smaller than &quot;B. edulis&quot;, it is also distinctively darker in colour. It is especially suited to drying.
*&quot;Cèpe des pins&quot; (&quot;pine tree cep&quot;; &quot;Boletus pinophilus&quot; or &quot;Boletus pinicola&quot;) grows among pine trees. Rarer than &quot;B. edulis&quot;, it is less appreciated by gourmets than the two other kinds of porcini, but remains a mushroom rated above most others.
*&quot;Cèpe d&#x27;été&quot; (&quot;summer cep&quot;; &quot;Boletus reticulatus&quot;), also less common and found earlier.

Molecular phylogenetic analyses have proven these three are all distinctive and separate species; other taxa formerly believed to be unique species or subspecies, such as &quot;B. betulicola&quot;, &quot;B. chippewaensis&quot;, &quot;B. persoonii&quot;, &quot;B. quercicola&quot; and &quot;B. venturii&quot;, are now known to be part of a &quot;B. edulis&quot; species complex with a wide morphological, ecological and geographic range, and that the genetic variability in this complex is low. Similar molecular technology has been developed to rapidly and accurately identify &quot;B. edulis&quot; and other commercially important fungi.

Three divergent lineages found in Yunnan province in China that are commonly marketed and sold as &quot;B. edulis&quot; (and are actually more closely related to &quot;B. aereus&quot;) were described in 2013 as &quot;B. bainiugan&quot;, &quot;B. meiweiniuganjun&quot; and &quot;B. shiyong&quot;. The classification has since been updated and expanded. All lineages are still members of &quot;Boletus&quot; sect. &quot;Boletus&quot;, the sensu sticto &quot;porcini clade&quot; of the genus.
Western North America has several species closely related to &quot;B. edulis&quot;. The white king bolete (&quot;Boletus barrowsii&quot;), found in parts of Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and California (and possibly elsewhere), is named after its discoverer Chuck Barrows. It is lighter in colour than &quot;B. edulis&quot;, having a cream-coloured cap with pink tones; often mycorrhizal with Ponderosa pine, it tends to grow in areas where there is less rainfall. Some find its flavour as good as if not better than &quot;B. edulis&quot;. The California king bolete (&quot;Boletus edulis var. grandedulis&quot;) can reach massive proportions, and is distinguished from &quot;B. edulis&quot; by a mature pore surface that is brown to slightly reddish. The cap colour appears to be affected by the amount of light received during its development, and may range from white in young specimens grown under thick canopy, to dark-brown, red-brown or yellow brown in those specimens receiving more light. The queen bolete (&quot;Boletus regineus&quot;), formerly considered a variety of &quot;B. aereus&quot;, is also a choice edible. It is generally smaller than &quot;B. edulis&quot;, and unlike that species, is typically found in mixed forests. The spring king bolete (&quot;Boletus rex-veris&quot;), formerly considered a variety of &quot;B. edulis&quot; or &quot;B. pinophilus&quot;, is found throughout western North America. In contrast to &quot;B. edulis&quot;, &quot;B. rex-veris&quot; tends to fruit in clusters, and, as its common name suggests, appears in the spring. &quot;B. fibrillosus&quot; is edible but considered inferior in taste.

==Habitat and distribution==

The fruit bodies of &quot;Boletus edulis&quot; can grow singly or in small clusters of two or three specimens. The mushroom&#x27;s habitat consists of areas dominated by pine (&quot;Pinus&quot; spp.), spruce (&quot;Picea&quot; spp.), hemlock (&quot;Tsuga&quot; spp.) and fir (&quot;Abies&quot; spp.) trees, although other hosts include chestnut, chinquapin, beech, &quot;Keteleeria&quot; spp., &quot;Lithocarpus&quot; spp., and oak. In California, porcini have been collected in a variety of forests, such as coastal forests, dry interior oak forests and savannas and interior high-elevation montane mixed forests, to an altitude of . In northwestern Spain, they are common in scrublands dominated by the rock rose species &quot;Cistus ladanifer&quot; and &quot;Halimium lasianthum&quot;. In the Midi region of south-west France, they are especially favoured and locally called &quot;cèpe de Bordeaux&quot; after the town from which they are traded to the north and abroad.

&quot;Boletus edulis&quot; has a cosmopolitan distribution, concentrated in cool-temperate to subtropical regions. It is common in Europe—from northern Scandinavia, south to the extremities of Greece and Italy—and North America, where its southern range extends as far south as Mexico. It is well known from the Borgotaro area of Parma, Italy, and has PGI status there. The European distribution extends north to Scandinavia and south to southern Italy and Morocco. In the American Pacific Northwest, it can be found from May to October. In China, the mushroom can be found from the northeastern Heilongjiang to the Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau and Tibet. It has been recorded growing under &quot;Pinus&quot; and &quot;Tsuga&quot; in Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal, as well as in the Indian forests of Arunachal Pradesh. In West Asia, the species has been reported from the northwest forests of Iran.

===Cultivation===
Some steps have been made towards cultivating &quot;Boletus edulis&quot;, including mycorrhization of rockrose shrubs enhanced by helper bacteria.

===Non-native introductions===
&quot;Boletus edulis&quot; grows in some areas where it is not believed to be indigenous. It is often found underneath oak and silver birch in Hagley Park in central Christchurch, New Zealand, where it is likely to have been introduced, probably on the roots of container-grown beech, birch, and oak in the mid-19th century—around the time exotic trees began to be planted in the Christchurch area. Similarly, it has been collected in Adelaide Hills region of Australia in association with three species of introduced trees. It has been growing plentifully in association with pine forests in the southern KwaZulu-Natal Midlands in South Africa for more than 50 years and is believed to have been introduced with the import of pine trees. It also grows in pine plantations in neighboring Zimbabwe.

==Ecology==
===Fruit body production===
Italian folklore holds that porcini sprout up at the time of the new moon; research studies have tried to investigate more scientifically the factors that influence the production of fruit bodies. Although fruit bodies may appear any time from summer to autumn (June to November in the UK), their growth is known to be triggered by rainfall during warm periods of weather followed by frequent autumn rain with a drop in soil temperature. Above average rainfall may result in the rapid appearance of large numbers of boletes, in what is known in some circles as a &quot;bolete year&quot;. A 2004 field study indicated that fruit body production is enhanced by an open and sunny wood habitat, corroborating an earlier observation made in a Zimbabwean study; removal of the litter layer on the forest floor appeared to have a negative effect on fruit body production, but previous studies reported contradictory results. A Lithuanian study conducted in 2001 concluded that the maximal daily growth rate of the cap (about 21 mm or 0.8 in) occurred when the relative air humidity was the greatest, and the fruit bodies ceased growing when the air humidity dropped below 40%. Factors most likely to inhibit the appearance of fruit bodies included prolonged drought, inadequate air and soil humidity, sudden decreases of night air temperatures, and the appearance of the first frost. Plots facing north tend to produce more mushrooms compared to equivalent plots facing south.

===Mycorrhizal associations===
&quot;Boletus edulis&quot; is mycorrhizal—it is in a mutualistic relationship with the roots of plants (hosts), in which the fungus exchanges nitrogen and other nutrients extracted from the environment for fixed carbon from the host. Other benefits for the plant are evident: in the case of the Chinese chestnut, the formation of mycorrhizae with &quot;B. edulis&quot; increases the ability of plant seedlings to resist water stress, and increases leaf succulence, leaf area, and water-holding ability. The fungus forms a sheath of tissue around terminal, nutrient-absorbing root tips, often inducing a high degree of branching in the tips of the host, and penetrating into the root tissue, forming, to some mycologists, the defining feature of ectomycorrhizal relationships, a hartig net. The ectomycorrhizal fungi are then able to exchange nutrients with the plant, effectively expanding the root system of the host plant to the furthest reaches of the symbiont fungi. Compatible hosts may belong to multiple families of vascular plants that are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere; according to one 1995 estimate, there are at least 30 host plant species distributed over more than 15 genera. Examples of mycorrhizal associates include Chinese red pine, Mexican weeping pine, Scots pine, Norway spruce, Coast Douglas-fir, mountain pine, and Virginia pine. The fungus has also been shown to associate with gum rockrose, a pioneer early stage shrub that is adapted for growth in degraded areas, such as burned forests. These and other rockrose species are ecologically important as fungal reservoirs, maintaining an inoculum of mycorrhizal fungi for trees that appear later in the forest regrowth cycle.

The mushroom has been noted to often co-occur with &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; or &quot;A. rubescens&quot;, although it is unclear whether this is due to a biological association between the species, or because of similarities in growing season, habitat, and ecological requirements. An association has also been reported between &quot;B. edulis&quot; and &quot;Amanita excelsa&quot; on &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; ectomycorrhizae in New Zealand, suggesting that other fungi may influence the life cycle of porcini. A 2007 field study revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground, even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies were more complex.

===Heavy-metal contamination===
&quot;Boletus edulis&quot; is known to be able to tolerate and even thrive on soil that is contaminated with toxic heavy metals, such as soil that might be found near metal smelters. The mushroom&#x27;s resistance to heavy-metal toxicity is conferred by a biochemical called a phytochelatin—an oligopeptide whose production is induced after exposure to metal. Phytochelatins are chelating agents, capable of forming multiple bonds with the metal; in this state, the metal cannot normally react with other elements or ions and is stored in a detoxified form in the mushroom tissue.

===Pests and predators===
The fruit bodies of &quot;B. edulis&quot; can be infected by the parasitic mould-like fungus &quot;Hypomyces chrysospermus&quot;, known as the bolete eater, which manifests itself as a white, yellow, or reddish-brown cottony layer over the surface of the mushroom. Some reported cases of stomach ache following consumption of dried porcini have been attributed to the presence of this mould on the fruit bodies. The mushroom is also used as a food source by several species of mushroom flies, as well as other insects and their larvae. An unidentified species of virus was reported to have infected specimens found in the Netherlands and in Italy; fruit bodies affected by the virus had relatively thick stems and small or no caps, leading to the name &quot;little-cap disease&quot;.

&quot;Boletus edulis&quot; is a food source for animals such as the banana slug &quot;(Ariolimax columbianus)&quot;, the long-haired grass mouse, the red squirrel, and, as noted in one isolated report, the fox sparrow.

==Culinary uses==
&quot;Boletus edulis&quot;, as the species epithet &quot;edulis&quot; () indicates, is an edible mushroom. Italian chef and restaurateur Antonio Carluccio has described it as representing &quot;the wild mushroom &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot;, and hails it as the most rewarding of all fungi in the kitchen for its taste and versatility. Considered a choice edible, particularly in France, Germany, Poland and Italy, it was widely written about by the Roman writers Pliny the Elder and Martial, although ranked below the esteemed &quot;Amanita caesarea&quot;. When he was served &quot;suilli&quot; instead of &quot;boleti&quot;, the disgruntled Martial wrote: 

The flavour of porcini has been described as nutty and slightly meaty, with a smooth, creamy texture, and a distinctive aroma reminiscent of sourdough. Young, small porcini are most appreciated, as the large ones often harbour maggots (insect larvae), and become slimy, soft and less tasty with age. The fruit bodies are collected by holding the stipe near the base and twisting gently. Cutting the stipe with a knife may risk the part left behind rotting and the mycelium being destroyed. Peeling and washing are not recommended. The fruit bodies are highly perishable, due largely to the high water content (around 90%), the high level of enzyme activity, and the presence of a flora of microorganisms. Caution should be exercised when collecting specimens from potentially polluted or contaminated sites, as several studies have shown that the fruit bodies can bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals like mercury, cadmium, caesium and polonium. Bioaccumulated metals or radioactive fission decay products are like chemical signatures: chemical and radiochemical analysis can be used to identify the origin of imported specimens, and for long-term radioecological monitoring of polluted areas.

Porcini are sold fresh in markets in summer and autumn in Europe and Russia, and dried or canned at other times of the year, and distributed worldwide to countries where they are not otherwise found. They are eaten and enjoyed raw, sautéed with butter, ground into pasta, in soups, and in many other dishes. In France, they are used in recipes such as &quot;cèpes à la Bordelaise&quot;, &quot;cèpe frits&quot; and &quot;cèpe aux tomates&quot;. Porcini risotto is a traditional Italian autumn dish. Porcini are a feature of many cuisines, including Provençal, and Viennese. In Thailand they are used in soups and consumed blanched in salads. Porcini can also be frozen, either while raw or after cooking in butter. The colour, aroma, and taste of porcini deteriorate noticeably after being frozen for four months. Blanching (or soaking and blanching) as a processing step before freezing can extend the freezer life to 12 months. They are also one of the few species sold commercially as pickled mushrooms.

===Dried===

&quot;Boletus edulis&quot; is well suited to drying—its flavour intensifies, it is easily reconstituted, and its resulting texture is pleasant. Reconstitution is done by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too can be used in subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables, apart from soybeans. Some of their protein is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.

Like other boletes, porcini can be dried by being strung separately on twine and hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placing them in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Another method is drying in an oven at for two to three hours, then increasing the temperature to until crisp or brittle. Once dry, they must be kept in an airtight container. Importantly for commercial production, porcini retain their flavour after industrial preparation in a pressure cooker or after canning or bottling, and are thus useful for manufacturers of soups or stews. The addition of a few pieces of dried porcino can significantly add to flavour, and they are a major ingredient of the pasta sauce known as &quot;carrettiera&quot; (carter&#x27;s sauce). The drying process is known to induce the formation of various volatile substances that contribute to the mushroom&#x27;s aroma. Chemical analysis has shown that the odour of the dried mushroom is a complex mixture of 53 volatile compounds.

===Commercial harvest===

A 1998 estimate suggested that the total annual worldwide consumption of &quot;Boletus edulis&quot; and closely related species (&quot;B. aereus&quot;, &quot;B. pinophilus&quot;, and &quot;B. reticulatus&quot;) was between 20,000 and 100,000 tons. Approximately 2,700 tonnes (3,000 tons) were sold in France, Italy and Germany in 1988, according to official figures. The true amount consumed far exceeds this, as the official sales figures did not account for informal sales or consumption by collectors. They are widely exported and sold in dried form, reaching countries where they do not occur naturally, such as Australia and New Zealand. The autonomous community of Castile and León in Spain produces 7,700 tonnes (8,500 tons) annually. In autumn, the price of porcini in the Northern Hemisphere typically ranges between $20 and $80 per kilogram, although in New York in 1997 the wholesale price rose to more than $200 per kilogram due to scarcity.

In the vicinity of Borgotaro in the Province of Parma of northern Italy, the four species &quot;Boletus edulis&quot;, &quot;B. aereus&quot;, &quot;B. aestivalis&quot; and &quot;B. pinophilus&quot; have been recognised for their superior taste and officially termed &quot;Fungo di Borgotaro&quot;. Here these mushrooms have been collected for centuries and exported commercially. Owing to the globalisation of the mushroom trade most of the porcini commercially available in Italy or exported by Italy no longer originate there. Porcini and other mushrooms are also imported into Italy from various locations, especially China and eastern European countries; these are then often re-exported under the &quot;Italian porcini&quot; label.

In Italy the disconnect with local production has had an adverse effect on quality; for example in the 1990s some of the dried porcino mushrooms exported to Italy from China contained species of genus &quot;Tylopilus&quot;, which are rather similar in appearance and when dried are difficult for both mushroom labourers and mycologists alike to distinguish from &quot;Boletus&quot;. &quot;Tylopilus&quot; species typically have a very bitter taste, which is imparted to the flavour of the porcini with which they are mixed.

After the fall of the Iron Curtain and the subsequent reduction of economic and political barriers, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market. Porcini and other wild fungi from these countries are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists but collection on a commercial scale does not. Picking &quot;B. edulis&quot; has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime in countries like Bulgaria, especially for many Roma communities and the unemployed. A lack of control of the harvest has led to heavy exploitation of the mushroom resource.

Like many other strictly mycorrhizal fungi, &quot;B. edulis&quot; has eluded cultivation attempts for years. The results of some studies suggest that unknown components of the soil microflora might be required for &quot;B. edulis&quot; to establish a mycorrhizal relationship with the host plant. Successful attempts at cultivating &quot;B. edulis&quot; have been made by Spanish scientists by mycorrhization of &quot;Cistus&quot; species, with &quot;Pseudomonas fluorescens&quot; bacteria helping the mycorrhiza.

== Nutrition==
&quot;Boletus edulis&quot; mushrooms are 9% carbohydrates, 3% fat, and 7% protein (table). Fresh mushrooms consist of over 80% moisture, although reported values tend to differ somewhat as moisture content can be affected by environmental temperature and relative humidity during growth and storage. The carbohydrate component contains the monosaccharides glucose, mannitol and α,α-trehalose, the polysaccharide glycogen, and the water-insoluble structural polysaccharide chitin, which accounts for up to 80–90% of dry matter in mushroom cell walls. Chitin, hemicellulose, and pectin-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to the high proportion of insoluble fibre in &quot;B. edulis&quot;.

The total lipid, or crude fat, content makes up 3% of the dry matter of the mushroom. The proportion of fatty acids (expressed as a % of total fatty acids) are: linoleic acid 42%, oleic acid 36%, palmitic acid 10%, and stearic acid 3%.

A comparative study of the amino acid composition of eleven Portuguese wild edible mushroom species showed &quot;Boletus edulis&quot; to have the highest total amino acid content.

&quot;B. edulis&quot; mushrooms are rich in the dietary minerals, sodium, iron, calcium, and magnesium, with amounts varying according to the mushroom component and to soil composition in the geographic region of China where they were sampled. They also have high content of B vitamins and tocopherols. &quot;B. edulis&quot; contains appreciable amounts of selenium, a trace mineral, although the bioavailability of mushroom-derived selenium is low.

== Phytochemicals and research==
&quot;Boletus edulis&quot; fruit bodies contain diverse phytochemicals, including 500 mg of ergosterol per 100 g of dried mushroom, and ergothioneine. The fruit bodies contain numerous polyphenols, especially a high content of rosmarinic acid, and organic acids (such as oxalic, citric, malic, succinic and fumaric acids), and alkaloids.

===Aroma===
Aroma compounds giving &quot;B. edulis&quot; mushrooms their characteristic fragrance include some 100 components, such as esters and fatty acids. In a study of aroma compounds, 1-octen-3-one was the most prevalent chemical detected in raw mushrooms, with pyrazines having increased aroma effect and elevated content after drying.

<text>Peter Kilfoyle (born 9 June 1946) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool Walton from 1991 to 2010.

==Early life==
The eleventh of fourteen children born to an Irish Catholic family on Merseyside, Kilfoyle was educated by the Irish Christian Brothers at St. Edward&#x27;s College in Liverpool; his father died when he was 10 years old. Obtaining 4 A-levels he went to the University of Durham, but left after a year, becoming a labourer for five years. He qualified as a teacher at Christ&#x27;s College in Liverpool. From 1975 to 1985, he worked as a teacher. From 1986 to 1991, he was North West Regional Organiser for the Labour Party, often involved in dealing with the entryist tactics of the Militant group.

==Parliamentary career==
Kilfoyle became the Labour Member of Parliament for Liverpool Walton by retaining the seat in a by-election in 1991 following the death of the incumbent Eric Heffer. In 1994, he supported Tony Blair&#x27;s campaign for the Labour Party leadership in the leadership election following the death of incumbent John Smith.

When Labour returned to government in 1997, Kilfoyle was initially appointed to a role within the Cabinet Office, with a licence to speak out in the media on the Government&#x27;s behalf, and was later appointed a junior minister in the Ministry of Defence. In 2000 he resigned, asserting that the Blair Government was failing to pay enough attention to Labour&#x27;s heartlands. He then became a vocal backbench critic of the Government for the remainder of his time in parliament.

On 18 March 2003, Kilfoyle wrote the amendment against war in Iraq and moved the amendment in the debate in the House of Commons. Despite a large rebellion, the combined Government and official Opposition vote sanctioned war. In 2005, Kilfoyle allegedly defied the Official Secrets Act when he was said to have passed on information supposedly detailing then U.S. President George W. Bush&#x27;s plan to bomb an Arabic TV station.

In 2008, Kilfoyle advocated a Labour Party leadership challenge to Prime Minister Gordon Brown. On 23 February 2010, Kilfoyle announced that he would not seek re-election at the 2010 General Election.

In the 2012 England and Wales police and crime commissioner elections, he stood in the Labour nomination race to represent Merseyside Police; he was defeated for nomination by another former Liverpool MP, Jane Kennedy. In July 2014, he broke with official party policy to come out in support of Scottish independence and the SNP.

==Personal life==
He married Bernadette Slater on 27 July 1968, and they have five children. He is a patron of the British Heart Foundation following a heart attack in 2006 and quadruple bypass surgery.

<text>Lincoln&#x27;s sparrow (Melospiza lincolnii) is a small sparrow native to North America. It is a less common passerine bird that often stays hidden under thick ground cover, but can be distinguished by its sweet, wrenlike song. Lincoln&#x27;s sparrow is one of three species in the genus &quot;Melospiza&quot; which also includes the song sparrow (&quot;M. melodia&quot;) and the swamp sparrow (&quot;M. georgiana&quot;). It lives in well-covered brushy habitats, often near water. This bird is poorly documented because of its secretive nature and breeding habits solely in boreal regions.

== Description ==
Adults have dark-streaked olive-brown upperparts and a light brown breast with fine streaks, a white belly, and a white throat. They have a brown cap with a grey stripe in the middle, olive-brown wings, and a narrow tail. Their face is grey with brown cheeks, a buffy mustache, and a brown line through the eye with a narrow eye ring. Males and females are alike in plumage. They are somewhat similar in appearance to the song sparrow although smaller and trimmer with finer breast streaks.

Juveniles strongly resemble juvenile swamp sparrows with a streaky chest and not yet buffy breast, but Lincoln&#x27;s sparrows rarely have a unicolored crown like the swamp sparrow.

Adult measurements:

* Length: 5.1–5.9 in (13–15 cm)
* Weight: 0.6–0.7 oz (17–19 g)
* Wingspan: 7.5–8.7 in (19–22 cm)

== Taxonomy ==
Lincoln&#x27;s sparrow was named by John James Audubon after his friend Thomas Lincoln of Dennysville, Maine. Lincoln shot the bird on an expedition with Audubon to Nova Scotia in 1834, and Audubon named it in honor of his travel companion.

=== Subspecies ===
There are three known subspecies of Lincoln&#x27;s sparrow. However, some authors suggest that &quot;M. l. lincolnii&quot; and &quot;M. l. alticola&quot; should be considered one subspecies because of their morphological similarity.

* &quot;M. l. lincolnii&quot; is generally larger with more ruddy brown or gray-brown coloring and less yellow edging on dorsal feathers.
* &quot;M. l. gracilis&quot; is smaller with more yellow on dorsal feathers and broader dark shaft streaks creating greater contrasts in dorsal coloration. Its breeding habitat extends from the southern Alaskan archipelago to central British Columbia.
* &quot;M. l. alticola&quot;, the Montane Lincoln&#x27;s sparrow, is the largest subspecies and most uniform in color with a mostly brown back and narrow shaft streaks on dorsal feathers. It lives in the central Rocky Mountains of Canada and the mountains of California and Oregon and breeds as far south as New Mexico and Arizona.

== Habitat and distribution ==
Its breeding habitat is subalpine and montane zones across Canada, Alaska, and the northeastern and western United States, although they are less common in the eastern parts of their range. They are found mainly in wet thickets, shrubby bogs, and moss-dominated habitats. They prefer to be near dense shrub cover and their nests are well-concealed shallow open cups on the ground under vegetation. At lower elevations, they can also be found in mixed deciduous groves, mixed shrub-willows, and black spruce-tamarack bogs. They primarily use the ground and base of willows for foraging, whereas they use tall trees and willow branches for singing.

During migration, it lives in thickets and bushes, particularly in riparian zones. They use lowlands such as the Great Plains and Great Basin, as well as urban and suburban habitats in the east. Their migration period starts between May 13 to 30 and lasts until August 20 to September 20. Their southern habitats over the winter include tropical evergreen and deciduous forests, arid and humid pine-oak forests, Pacific swamp forests, and arid subtropical scrub.

Its wintering range extends from the southern United States down to Mexico and northern Central America; they are passage migrants over much of the United States, except in the west. In 2010, a Lincoln&#x27;s sparrow was observed for the first time in the Dominican Republic, and there have also been several records of this species in montane regions of Haiti. However, the skulking behavior of this bird and their preference for densely-covered habitats makes it difficult to accurately describe the full range of this species.

== Behaviour ==

=== Vocalizations ===
Lincoln&#x27;s sparrow is a very secretive species; they are often not seen or heard even where they are common. Only the males are known to sing and their song is unique among the &quot;Melospiza&quot; genus. They produce a sweet, wrenlike, gurgling song with varied frequencies. First, there are often several rapid, high-pitched introductory notes, which then go into a trill that starts out low, rises abruptly, and then drops. Similar to the swamp sparrow, Lincoln&#x27;s sparrow has a relatively small song repertoire with an average of 3.7 different song types per individual. However, their complex, multisyllabic song pattern is comparable to that of a song sparrow, whereas the swamp sparrow has a simple, single-syllabic song. They sing most frequently in the morning and only in the beginning of the breeding season before incubation. They often sing while exposed on perches, as well as during flight.

This bird has two calls sounds: one is an aggressive, flat &quot;tup&quot; or &quot;chip&quot; while the other is a soft, high-pitched buzzy &quot;zeet&quot;. The latter in males is often followed by their song. The &quot;zeet&quot; call is generally used while under dense cover, whereas the &quot;chip&quot; call is used while exposed on perches to attract attention or during antagonistic encounters. Both calls are used in nest defense. They also have a distinct, hoarse, buzzing &quot;zrrr-zrrr-zrrr&quot; call sequence used for mating, during territorial disputes, and when mate-guarding.

=== Diet ===
In the winter, the majority of their diet consists of small seeds of weeds and grasses, but when available they will also eat terrestrial vertebrates. During the breeding season, they mainly feed on arthropods including insect larvae, ants, spiders, beetles, flies, moths, caterpillars, mayflies, and others. Adults typically eat prey from higher trophic levels such as spiders, whereas they feed their chicks greater proportions of plant material and lower trophic level prey like grasshoppers. They mostly forage on the ground in dense vegetation and, in the winter, may occasionally use bird feeders. They catch prey with their bill while hopping on the ground and typically swallow their prey whole.

=== Reproduction ===
Males arrive to the breeding ground in mid to late May and begin to sing in order to attract a mate. In early June, females build their nests on the ground under dense grass or shrub cover, usually inside a low willow shrub, mountain birch, or sunken in a depression of sphagnum moss. Their nest is a well-covered shallow open cup of grasses or sedges. Clutch size is typically 3–5 eggs which are oval in shape and colored pale green to greenish-white and spotted reddish brown. One egg is laid per day, and females begin incubating eggs before the clutch is complete, while males do not incubate. Incubation lasts for about 12–14 days. Young are born altricial and leave the nest about 9–12 days after hatching, although they may be cared for by their parents for another 2–3 weeks. Fledglings are mostly flightless their first day, but their flying abilities quickly improve, and by day six they can fly more than 10 meters at a time.

In Lincoln&#x27;s sparrows, male bill shape is correlated with the quality of their songs, with declining quality as the ratio of bill height to bill width decreases. This impacts reproductive success because song quality influences female mating preferences. Males that hatch later in the breeding season tend to have bill shapes that are less suitable for producing songs that attract females, and thus, have lower reproductive success.

<text>Julie Kirkbride (born 5 June 1960) is a British Conservative politician. She was the Member of Parliament for the Conservative stronghold of Bromsgrove from the 1997 to the 2010 general elections.

==Early life==
Kirkbride was born in Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire. Her father was a lorry driver, who died when she was seven. Her mother was a secretary at Rowntree Mackintosh (now owned by Nestlé). She went to the Highlands School (now North Halifax Grammar School) in Illingworth, Halifax. She studied at Girton College, Cambridge from 1978–81, receiving an MA in Economics and History, and serving as vice-president of the Cambridge Union Society in 1981. From 1981–82, she worked as a journalist for the Parliamentary Weekly House Magazine. She went to the Graduate School of Journalism of the University of California Berkeley from 1982–83. She was a researcher for Yorkshire Television from 1983–86, a producer for BBC News and Current Affairs from 1986–89, then worked as a producer at the ITN Parliamentary Unit from 1989–92. She was the political correspondent of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; from 1992–96 and social affairs editor of &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; from 1996 until 1997.

==Parliamentary career==
In 1997 general election Kirkbride was elected MP of Bromsgrove, a seat which had consistently been Conservative since the 1970s. She was re-elected in 2001 election and 2005 election with over 50 per cent of votes.

Kirkbride was the Conservative spokesman on Culture, Media and Sport from 2003 to 2004, but was replaced in a reshuffle by the party leader at that time, Michael Howard.

On 10 November 2006, it was revealed that she had links with the Midlands Industrial Council, which has donated millions of pounds to the Conservative Party.

She stood down as a Member of Parliament before the 2010 general election, as a result of public anger over her expenses claims. In October 2010, after she had stood down, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards cleared her of any wrongdoing and dismissed the complaints against her.

===Expenses claims===

On 14 May 2009, her husband Andrew MacKay, the Conservative Member for Bracknell, resigned from his position as parliamentary aide to David Cameron, in the wake of the furore over Parliamentary expenses after what was described as an &quot;unacceptable&quot; expenses claim.

MacKay and Kirkbride owned two homes: one in her constituency of Bromsgrove; and a house close to Parliament in Westminster. In a case of so-called double-dipping, according to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Mackay had used his Additional Costs Allowance to claim more than £1,000 a month in mortgage interest payments on their joint Westminster house – even though he did not have a residence in his Bracknell constituency – while Kirkbride used her Additional Costs Allowance to claim over £900 a month to pay the mortgage for their family home in her constituency. &quot;This means,&quot; reports &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;they effectively had no main home but two second homes – and were using public funds to pay for both of them&quot;. During 2008–9, MacKay claimed a total of £23,083 under Additional Costs Allowance, while Kirkbride claimed £22,575. They also claimed for each other&#x27;s travel costs, with Kirkbride claiming £1,392 to meet spouse travel, while MacKay claimed £408.

Julie Kirkbride employed her sister at taxpayers&#x27; expense as her secretary despite her sister living 140 miles from the constituency. Kirkbride also extended her mortgage to pay for a £50,000 extension to her house, which she said was to provide a separate bedroom for her son, and claimed for this on expenses. She said she allowed her brother to stay rent free in her house some of the time so that he could care for her son, Angus, while she undertook constituency work in the evening. Kirkbride also suggested that criticism of her expense claims could deter women from entering Parliament.

On 28 May 2009, Kirkbride cancelled a meeting in her Bromsgrove constituency to discuss the expense claims, and it was announced that owing to press criticism of her expense claims, she intended to stand down at the next election. In a letter to Cameron, she said, &quot;My principal concern has to be for my very loyal local supporters in Bromsgrove whose trust in me has been very humbling in the last few weeks ... I also must take into account the effects on my family.&quot; A petition in the Bromsgrove constituency demanding Kirkbride&#x27;s resignation had attracted over 5,000 signatures. Kirkbride also lost the trust of party activists: the results of a poll on the ConservativeHome website showed that 81% of those responding (a self-selecting sample) thought Kirkbride should go and only 6% that she should remain as a Conservative MP. Shortly before her decision to stand down, she had stated that it never crossed her mind that she was doing anything wrong; however, she was also quoted as saying that it was &quot;hugely upsetting to realise I have let people down&quot;.

On 5 November, she reversed her decision, telling a meeting of the Executive Council of Bromsgrove Conservative Association that she wanted to be considered as their candidate for the next general election. On 18 December she announced she would indeed stand down, in a Christmas and New Year message on her website saying &quot;this is entirely my decision&quot;.

The Legg review of MPs expenses declared that Kirkbride had to pay back £29,243, the fifth highest total of all MPs. Kirkbride&#x27;s husband Andrew MacKay had to pay back £31,193, ranking third. Both MPs had paid back the amount in full by the time of the release of the report on 4 February 2010. Kirkbride was one of 98 MPs who voted in favour of legislation which would have kept MPs&#x27; expense details secret.

In October 2010, the Parliamentary Commissioner of Standards rejected complaints of her expenses and upheld that she had been within the rules to claim her Bromsgrove property as a second home, to allow her brother to stay to look after her child and to extend her mortgage to provide a further bedroom. On the issue of the second home he wrote: &quot;I have concluded that Mr MacKay was wrong to designate the Bromsgrove property as his main home. Given that, it would be unreasonable to hold that Ms Kirkbride could not make legitimate claims from parliamentary resources for the home in her constituency which she had identified as her second home&quot;.

On the issue of the extended mortgage he wrote: &quot;I conclude, therefore, that Ms Kirkbride was within the rules in claiming interest on the additional mortgage which she, with her husband, took out in April 2008 to extend her Bromsgrove constituency property by building a third bedroom for it so that she had somewhere for her child carer to stay while she was busy on her parliamentary duties&quot;.

On the issue of her brother, the Commissioner concluded: &quot;I consider that it would be an unduly harsh interpretation of the rules to require a member to meet the living costs of having a person stay overnight in their home when that person was there to look after their dependant child so that they could perform their parliamentary duties. Ms Kirkbride&#x27;s son was at an age when it was essential that someone should be with him in the evening and overnight. The arrangement enabled Ms Kirkbride to continue with her constituency duties as a Member of Parliament&quot;

==Post parliamentary career==

Kirkbride has been a trustee of the charity Volunteering Matters since 2016. In 2019, she became a non-executive director of the education inspectorate Ofsted That same year she also became a trustee of the education charity the New Schools Network.

==Personal life==
She had previously been the girlfriend of Conservative MP Stephen Milligan before his death by auto-erotic asphyxiation in 1994. In August 1997, she married Andrew MacKay, the Conservative Member for Bracknell, and their son was born in October 2000.

<text>Archibald Johnstone Kirkwood, Baron Kirkwood of Kirkhope, (born 22 April 1946), is a British Liberal Democrat politician.

==Education==
Kirkwood was educated at Cranhill Secondary School in Cranhill, Glasgow, and studied pharmacy at Heriot-Watt University, gaining a BSc in 1971. He became a solicitor in Hawick and Notary public.

==Parliamentary career==
Kirkwood first joined parliament in 1971 as a parliamentary assistant as part of the Joseph Rowntree Social Service Trust (now the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust) Political Fellowship Scheme. In 1971 he worked for David Steel MP in the office of the Liberal Chief Whip.

Kirkwood was the Liberal, and later Liberal Democrat, Member of Parliament for Roxburgh and Berwickshire from 1983 until 2005.

In 1986, he with two other MPs, Simon Hughes and Michael Meadowcroft, and the National League of Young Liberals and other parts of the party produced the booklet &quot;Across the Divide: Liberal Values on Defence and Disarmament&quot;. This was the rally call that defeated the party leadership in the debate over the issue of an independent nuclear deterrent. This led to Kirkwood and the other authors being jeered by other Liberal MPs and Peers at the 1986 Liberal Assembly.

A Chair of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Work and Pensions, Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope, is listed in the House of Lords Register of Interests (Session 2006–2007) as the Chairman of the Unum Customer Advisory Panel for which he received payment from Unum. He received additional payments for other work for Unum.

==Personal life==
Kirkwood was knighted in the 2003 New Year Honours, and dubbed by the Queen at the Palace of Holyroodhouse on 3 July 2003.

On 13 May 2005 it was announced that he would be created a life peer, and on 10 June 2005 he was created Baron Kirkwood of Kirkhope, &quot;of Kirkhope in Scottish Borders&quot;. He retired from the House of Lords on 2 September 2020.

He married Rosemary Chester on 30 December 1972. Lady Kirkwood died on 22 October 2019. They have a son and daughter.

<text>Paul Felix Lazarsfeld (February 13, 1901August 30, 1976) was an Austrian-American sociologist and mathematician. The founder of Columbia University&#x27;s Bureau of Applied Social Research, he exerted influence over the techniques and the organization of social research. &quot;It is not so much that he was an American sociologist,&quot; one colleague said of him after his death, &quot;as it was that he determined what American sociology would be.&quot; Lazarsfeld said that his goal was &quot;to produce Paul Lazarsfelds&quot;. He was a founding figure in 20th-century empirical sociology.

== Early life ==
Lazarsfeld was born to Jewish parents in Vienna: his mother was the Adlerian therapist Sophie Lazarsfeld, and his father Robert was a lawyer. He attended the University of Vienna, eventually receiving a doctorate in mathematics (his doctoral dissertation dealt with mathematical aspects of Einstein&#x27;s gravitational theory) in 1925. In the 1920s, he moved in the same circles as the Vienna Circle of philosophers, including Otto Neurath and Rudolf Carnap, and served as a &quot;socialist activist&quot;. He came to sociology through his expertise in mathematics and quantitative methods, participating in several early quantitative studies, including what was possibly the first scientific survey of radio listeners, in 19301931. In 1926 he married the sociologist Marie Jahoda. Together with Hans Zeisel they wrote a now-classical study of the social impact of unemployment on a small community: &quot;Die Arbeitslosen von Marienthal&quot; (1932; English: &quot;The sociography of an unemployed community&quot;, 1971).

== Coming to America ==
The Marienthal study attracted the attention of the Rockefeller Foundation, leading to a two-year traveling fellowship to the United States. From 1933 to 1935, Lazarsfeld worked with the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and toured the United States, making contacts and visiting the few universities that had programs related to empirical social science research. It was during this time that Lazarsfeld met Luther Fry at the University of Rochester (which resulted in the inspiration for the research done in &quot;Personal Influence&quot;, written some twenty years later) and Robert S. Lynd, who had written the &quot;Middletown&quot; study. Lynd would come to play a central role in helping Lazarsfeld emigrate to the United States, and would recommend him for the directorships of the Newark Center and the Princeton Office of Radio Research. Lazarsfeld contacted the Psychological Corporation, a non-profit organization devoted to bringing the techniques of applied psychology to business, and proposed a number of projects that were rejected as not having enough commercial value or being too involved. He also helped John Jenkins, an applied psychologist at Cornell University, translate an introduction to statistics Lazarsfeld had written for his students in Vienna (&quot;Say It With Figures&quot;). Finally, he pursued research into the ideas presented in the widely read &quot;The Art of Asking Why&quot; (1935), which explained Lazarsfeld&#x27;s concept of &quot;reason analysis&quot;.

== Newark ==
At the end of the fellowship in 1935, with a return to Vienna made untenable by the political climate, Lazarsfeld decided to remain in America, and secured an appointment as the director of student relief work for the National Youth Administration, headquartered at the University of Newark (now, the Newark campus of Rutgers University). A year later, he established an institute in Newark along the lines of his Vienna Research Center, institutionalizing the marginal field of opinion research that Lazarsfeld felt was his most important contribution. Lazarsfeld saw his institute as an important bridge between European and American models of research, and was willing to place the future of his institutes before his personal career. For example, in order to make the Newark Center seem to have a larger staff, Lazarsfeld published under a pseudonym. The Newark Center was clearly successful in generating interest in both empirical studies and in Lazarsfeld as a research manager. The research carried on at the center between 1935 and 1937 (including research for the Mirra Komarovsky book &quot;The Unemployed Man and His Family&quot;) demonstrated that empirical research could be of help and of interest to both business and academia. Under &quot;Administrative Research&quot;, as he called his framework, a large, expert staff worked at a research center, deploying a battery of social-scientific investigative methodsmass market surveys, statistical analysis of data, focus group work, etc.to solve specific problems for specific clients. Funding came not only from the university, but also from commercial clients who contracted out research projects. This produced studies such as two long reports to the dairy industry on factors influencing the consumption of milk; and a questionnaire to let people assess whether they shop too much (for &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine).

While at Newark, Lazarsfeld was appointed head of the Princeton Office of the Radio Research Project, which was later moved to Columbia. In 1937, he first tried to have the project moved to Newark, and when that request was turned down, split his time between the project and his institute in Newark. He feared (correctly, perhaps) that the institute would fail without his management. At the Project, Lazarsfeld expanded the aims postulated by the assistant directors, Hadley Cantril and Frank Stanton, and in a special issue of the &quot;Journal of Applied Psychology&quot; in February 1939, edited by Lazarsfeld, he tied together some of the varied research the Project was engaged in. Lazarsfeld felt this publication was necessary because &quot;no central theory was visible, and we began hearing rumors that important people questioned whether we knew what we were doing&quot; (Lazarsfeld, 1969). But in the spring of 1939, the Rockefeller foundation officers were still unconvinced and &quot;required more solid evidence of achievement&quot; before they would renew funding. The result was &quot;Radio and the Printed Page&quot;. These two publications did much to consolidate and define the field of communication.

== Columbia ==
After a falling out with Cantril, which may have been financial in nature, the Radio Research Project moved to Columbia University, where it grew into the acclaimed Bureau for Social Research. At Columbia, the direction of research leaned toward voting, and a study of the November 1940 vote was published as &quot;The People&#x27;s Choice&quot;, a book that had a substantial effect on the nature of political research.

During the 1940s, mass communication entrenched itself as a field in its own right. Lazarsfeld&#x27;s interest in the persuasive elements of mass media became a topic of great importance during the Second World War and this resulted in increased attention, and funding, for communication research. By the 1950s, there were increased concerns about the power of the mass media, and with Elihu Katz, Lazarsfeld published &quot;Personal Influence&quot;, which propounded the theory of a two-step flow of communication, opinion leadership, and of community as filters for the mass media. Along with Robert K. Merton, he popularized the idea of a narcotizing dysfunction of media, along with its functional roles in society.

His contributions include: the two-step flow of communication from media to opinion leaders and then others (multi-step flow theory); his research on the characteristics of opinion leaders; diffusion of medical innovations; uses and gratifications of receivers from day time radio soap operas, etc. His research led to a marriage between interpersonal communication and mass communication.

In 1956, he was elected as a Fellow of the American Statistical Association.

Lazarsfeld died in 1976. His mother Sophie survived him by almost a month, dying at age 95. With Marie Jahoda, he had a daughter, Lotte Franziska Lazarsfeld (born 1930), later Lotte Bailyn, who became a professor of management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He divorced Marie in 1930 and married his colleague Herta Herzog in 1936. The marriage lasted until 1945. With his third wife, married in 1949, , he had a son, Robert Lazarsfeld (born 1953), who was professor of mathematics at Stony Brook University, and who published &quot;Positivity in Algebraic Geometry&quot; (Springer) in 2004.

== Influence ==
Lazarsfeld&#x27;s many contributions to sociological method have earned him the title of the &quot;founder of modern empirical sociology&quot;. Lazarsfeld invented the latent class model for clustering multivariate discrete data. He also made great strides in statistical survey analysis, panel methods, latent structure analysis, and contextual analysis. He is also considered a co-founder of mathematical sociology. Many of his ideas have been so influential as to now be considered self-evident. He is also noted for developing the two-step flow of communication model.

Lazarsfeld also made significant contributions by training many younger sociologists. One of Lazarsfeld&#x27;s biographers, Paul Neurath, writes that there are &quot;dozens of books and hundreds of articles by his students and the students of his students, all of which still breathe the spirit of this man&#x27;s work&quot;. One of Lazarsfeld&#x27;s successful students was Barney Glaserpropounder of grounded theory (GT)the world&#x27;s most quoted method for analyzing qualitative data. Index formations and qualitative mathematics were subjects taught by Lazarsfeld and are important components of the GT method according to Glaser. James Samuel Coleman, an important contributor to social theories of education and a future president of the American Sociological Association, was also a student of Lazarsfeld&#x27;s at Columbia.

Paul Lazarsfeld&#x27;s most important contribution, in his own opinion as well, was the beta version of a research institution that was based within a university setting. He started his journey of institute creation overseas in Vienna. He then proceeded to create two within the United Statesmost importantly with the Bureau of Applied Social Research at Columbia University. The most prestigious era of this Bureau was when Lazarsfeld was the director, associate director, as well as an active researcher in the Bureau. It was during this time that the Bureau was able to control and distribute almost a million dollars and produce studies a sundry. This was his most important contribution because it was able to create a business plan for the production of knowledge from a standpoint that was nonprofit yet not acquiring debt. This was significant because it was a model that was replicated at other universitiesmaking the production of research affordable and organized.

 Another important contribution of Paul Lazarsfeld was his advancement to media effects research that he was able to bring into fruition. Lazarsfeld&#x27;s “most important methodological contributions were the Lazarsfeld-Stanton Program Analyzer and focus group interviewing” according to Everett Rogers. The LazarsfeldStanton Program Analyzer, or &quot;Little Annie&quot; as it was called, provided audience members with a device that had a red button and a green button. When an experimental audience member viewed mediated content, they were able instantly communicate through the two buttons if what they witnessed was likable or it was not. The second research method that was used in tandem with Little Annie was focus group interviewing. After using the tool and viewing the artifact, the participants of the study then filled out a questionnaire, and then discussed the content. The tool was a boon because it allowed for broadcast content to be revised and also be rated for effectiveness. This tool was useful to truly measure audience analysis and reception of a message via a mediated channel. These tools produced both qualitative and quantitative data.

His contributions to measurement include innovative survey methods such as the longitudinal panel survey he used in his 1940 study in Erie, OH. He contributed to data analysis with a variety of techniques such as the 2x2 contingency tables, frequency analyses, scatter plots, and mixed methods like focus groups.

Paul Lazarsfeld has been the President of the American Sociological Association (ASA) and the American Association for Public Opinion Research. He received honorary degrees from many universities, including the University of Chicago, Columbia University, the University of Vienna and the Sorbonne University. Columbia University&#x27;s social research center has been renamed after him. The career achievement award of the ASA Methodology section is also named in his honor, as is the top theory award of the American Evaluation Association.

== Criticism ==
Though the research bureau was a major contribution, it was not without flaws. Lazarsfeld emphasized that a research institution is capable of existing in an organized fashion but that the commandeering and leadership really dictated the success of it. Lazarsfeld was successful for nearly two decades; however actors within this particular system could manipulate the machinations of the institution and thus derail the program. Another negative repercussion of having the type of leadership that Lazarsfeld provided was that the organization and its methodology was determined by his preferencesnot allowing in this case for statistics to be utilized and that the data sets were unable to be replicated and generalized.

A major portion of Lazarsfeld&#x27;s research concerned the individual decision-making process and how it was influenced by the mass media. The Marienthal study was an exception, being biased toward the community, but in all the studies carried out in localities after Marienthal (Sandusky, Elmira, and Decatur, for example), the individual was much more clearly the unit of analysis. While Lazarsfeld clearly did not see his own research agenda as the only approach to communication research, others criticized his &quot;administrative research&quot;paid for by commercial and military fundingas an overwhelming move toward empirical, shortterm, effectsbased research.

The ascendency of administrative research provided an effective foil for critics. Theodor W. Adorno, who had worked under Lazarsfeld at the Radio Project, came to represent an intellectual tradition that contrasted with Lazarsfeld&#x27;s own dedication to empiricism and willingness to collaborate with industry. Likewise, Lazarsfeld&#x27;s focus on empirical discovery rather than grand theory (&quot;abstract empiricism&quot; in the words of C. Wright Mills) was one of the spurs that led Robert K. Merton to develop what he called &quot;theories of the middle range&quot;.

In terms of weaknesses, he looked at individuals and missed the larger social structure and the power relations within it. He predominantly worked in the area of administrative research. He did many surveys but was reluctant to generalize his findings to a larger group. Though he found powerful cognitive effects produced by media in his 1940 study, he chose to support the minimal effects hypothesis.

In the end, he thought that his ideas of empirical research had not been as widely received as he might have hoped. In one of his last published papers, &quot;Communication Research and Its Applications: A Postscript&quot; (1976), Lazarsfeld lamented that the tide had turned against empirical research and that &quot;while an increasing number of writers expressed the need [to make &#x27;applications&#x27; a topic of research], it certainly was not the subject of popular demand among sociologists.&quot;

== Lazarsfeld&#x27;s work with Robert K. Merton ==
Lazarsfeld was noted for his ability to forge productive collaborations with a wide range of thinkers. One of his most celebrated collaborations was with Robert K. Merton. Both Merton and Lazarsfeld were new faculty members in Columbia University&#x27;s Department of Sociology appointed in 1941. Merton was seen as a budding theorist, while Lazarsfeld was considered a methodology specialist. Apparently the pair had little contact until Merton and his wife came to dinner at the Lazarsfeld&#x27;s Manhattan apartment on Saturday evening, November 23, 1941. Upon arrival Lazarsfeld explained to Merton that he had been just asked by the US government&#x27;s Office of New Facts and Figures to evaluate a radio program. Thus &quot;Merton accompanied Lazarsfeld to the radio studio, leaving their wives in the Lazarsfeld apartment with the uneaten dinner.&quot; Lazarsfeld was using the famous StantonLazarsfeld ProgramAnalyzer, to record the responses of listeners, and in the ensuing interviews they conducted, Merton was instrumental in ensuring questions were properly answered. This was believed to be the start of the &quot;focused group interview&quot;, or what we now known as the focus group. It was also the beginning of a rich and influential collaboration in the field of communication studies.

The paper for which Lazarsfeld and Merton is best known is their &quot;Mass Communication, Popular Taste, and Organized Social Action&quot; (1948). Widely anthologized, the paper has been proposed as a canonical text in media studies. Lazarsfeld and Merton set out to understand the burgeoning public interest in problems of the &quot;media of mass communication&quot;. After a critical consideration of common and problematic approaches to the mass medianoting that the &quot;sheer presence of these media may not affect our society so profoundly as is widely supposed&quot;they work their work through three aspects of what they see as the problem. They highlight three &quot;social functions&quot; that cast a long shadow into the present day. The first of these is social status conferral function, or the way that the &quot;mass media confer status on public issues, persons, organizations and social movements&quot;. The second function is the &quot;enforcement of social norms&quot;, where the mass media uses public exposure of events or behaviour, to expose &quot;deviations from these norms to public view&quot;. The third function, and perhaps best known, is the narcotizing dysfunction, in which energies of individuals in society are systematically routed away from organized actionbecause of the time and attention needed to simply keep up with reading or listening to mass media: &quot;Exposure to this flood of information may serve to narcotize rather than to energize the average reader or listener.&quot;

The remainder of Lazarsfeld and Merton&#x27;s paper discusses structure of ownership and operation of the mass media specific to the USespecially the fact that in the case of magazines, newspapers, and radio, advertising &quot;supports the enterprise&quot;: &quot;Big business finances the production and distribution of mass media [...] he who pays the piper generally calls the tune&quot;. They point out the ensuing problems of social conformism, and consider the impact upon popular taste (a controversy which rages unabated until the present). The final section of the paper considers a topic of great salience in the postWorld War II period, propaganda for social objectives. Here they propose three conditions for rendering such propaganda effective, terming these &quot;monopolization&quot; (the &quot;absence of counter propaganda&quot;), &quot;canalization&quot; (taking established behaviour and enlisting it in a particular direction), and &quot;supplementation&quot; (the reinforcement of mass media messages by face-to-face contact in local organizations). Lazarsfeld and Merton&#x27;s classic essay has long been criticized as a high point of the dominant effects tradition in communication theory. However, revisionist accounts have now drawn attention to the mix of ideas it contains from &quot;critical&quot; communication traditions, as much as empirical, methodological, and quantitative approaches.

<text>The People&#x27;s Voice () is an Israeli-Palestinian civil initiative dedicated to advancing the process of achieving peace between Israelis and the Palestinians. Co-founders Ami Ayalon, former head of the Shin Bet and Sari Nusseibeh signed the initiative on 27 July 2002 and officially launched it at a press conference held in Tel-Aviv on 25 June 2003. Broad outlines and some details of the initiative were known months in advance and had engendered responses from competing proposals.

The key proposals of the initiative are:
* Two states for two peoples.
* Borders based upon the June 4, 1967 lines.
* Jerusalem will be an open city, the capital of two states.
* Palestinian refugees will return only to the Palestinian state.
* Palestine will be demilitarized.

Upon the full implementation of these principles, all claims on both sides and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict will end.

Unlike a number of other proposals, the initiative seeks to resolve the conflict in a single agreement. No phased or interim steps are envisioned.

The initiative seeks to affect the political process by petition, seeking the signatures of enough residents of the area on all sides of the conflict to drive the leaders of the various sides to concluding a peace agreement. The People&#x27;s Voice website reported on 26 January 2004, 156,000 Israelis and 100,000 Palestinians having signed the initiative. In late 2007 the website went off-line. The Hebrew part went back on-line in 2008, and on 11 October 2008 reported 251,000 Israelis and 160,000 Palestinians having signed.

<text>James Philip Knight, Baron Knight of Weymouth, (born 6 March 1965) is a British politician who served as Minister for the South West and Minister of State for Employment and Welfare Reform from 2009 to 2010. A member of the Labour Party and Co-operative Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for South Dorset from 2001 to 2010.

After losing his seat to Richard Drax of the Conservative Party, it was announced Knight would be made a life peer in the 2010 Dissolution Honours. He is now chief education and external officer at TES Global Ltd, and a visiting professor at the London Knowledge Lab of the Institute of Education in London.

==Education==
Knight was educated at Eltham College, an independent school in Mottingham in south east London, followed by Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he studied geography and social &amp; political sciences from 1984–87, gaining a BA Hons.

==Early career==
Knight was manager of Central Studio, the arts centre of Queen Mary&#x27;s College, Basingstoke, from 1988–90. From 1990–91, he was director of West Wiltshire Arts Centre Ltd, then director of Dentons Directories Ltd in Westbury from 1991–2001.

== Election history ==
Knight first stood for Parliament at the 1997 general election as the Labour Party candidate for South Dorset, but narrowly lost by just 77 votes. He was, however, elected on the same day to Mendip District Council, on which he served until 2001; including as Labour group leader.

At the 2001 general election, he was elected as the Member of Parliament for South Dorset by 153 votes in the only Labour gain from the Conservatives that year. At the 2005 general election, Knight increased his majority to 1,812 votes, but with a small decrease in his share of the vote. At the 2010 general election, Knight lost his seat to Conservative Richard Drax by 7,443 votes after an 11.4% drop in his share of the vote.

==Parliamentary career==

Knight was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Rural Affairs, Landscape and Biodiversity in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs from 2005–06. He then moved to become Minister of State for Schools in the Department for Education and Skills. On 28 June 2007, when Gordon Brown disbanded the department, Knight moved to the newly created Department for Children, Schools and Families, as the Minister for Schools and Learners. In October 2008 following the reshuffle, Knight became a member of the Privy Council.

In 2009, when MPs expenses were revealed following a leak in the Daily Telegraph, Knight was ranked 171 out of 645 in the MPs&#x27; expenses list, claiming £155,987 in 2007/2008, compared with £137,970 in 2006/2007, of which £94,135 was for staff, £9,746 was for a communications allowance and £4,993 was for personal living expenses.

In his first Parliament, Jim Knight generally voted in line with party policy, including all major votes such as those on the Iraq war and top-up fees.

Jim Knight held the following positions:
*2003–2004 – Parliamentary Private Secretary to Rosie Winterton then Minister of State at the Department of Health
*2004–2005 – Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Ministerial Team at the Department of Health
*2005–2006 – Parliamentary under Secretary of State for Rural Affairs, the Landscape &amp; Biodiversity
*2006–2009 – Minister of State for Schools
*2009–2010 – Minister of State for Employment
*2009–2010 – Minister for the South West

==After politics==
Knight was created a life peer on 23 June 2010, taking the title Baron Knight of Weymouth, of Weymouth in the County of Dorset.

In April 2014 he stepped down from the Labour front bench in the House of Lords to take up a full-time role as managing director, online learning at TES Global Ltd, building an online professional development and training service for teachers. Knight was subsequently appointed chief education and external officer at TES Global.

In 2011, Knight was appointed as chair of digital and social inclusion charity Tinder Foundation (now Good Things Foundation). He stood down as chair in 2016 but remains a patron of the Technology, Pedagogy and Education professional association. He is now Chair Emeritus of the Digital Poverty Alliance and co-owner of XRapid, an app that diagnoses malaria and is a board member of Apps for Good.

<doc id="427679" wikidata="Q4805749" url="?curid=427679" title="Ashok Kumar (British politician)">
<text>Ashok Kumar (28 May 1956 – 15 March 2010) was a British Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland from 1997 until his sudden death shortly before the 2010 general election.

==Early life==
Kumar was born in Haridwar, Uttar Pradesh, India, to Jagat Ram Saini and Santosh Kumari, who emigrated to Derby when Kumar was twelve years old. He attended Rykneld Secondary Modern School in Derby and left at the age of fifteen to study for O-Levels at Wilmorton College, before attending Derby &amp; District College of Art &amp; Technology for his A-Levels. He then studied Chemical Engineering at Aston University in Birmingham where he was awarded a BSc in 1978, and an MSc in Process Analysis and Control Theory in 1980, and a PhD in Fluid Mechanics in 1982. The thesis title was &quot;Velocity distributions in a plate heat exchanger&quot;. He was a Fellow of the Institution of Chemical Engineers, a Chartered Engineer and a Member of the Energy Institute. Kumar was a Research Fellow at Imperial College London (1982–85) and worked as a research scientist for British Steel Corporation in Middlesbrough from 1985-97.

==Political career==
Kumar began his political career as a local councillor for Middlesbrough Borough Council (1987–97). He became the MP for Langbaurgh at the 1991 Langbaurgh by-election defeating Conservative candidate Michael Bates, but Bates won the seat again at the 1992 general election. Kumar won the successor seat of Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland at the 1997 general election, again defeating Bates, and held it until his death in 2010. Prior to his death, Kumar had been selected to stand again at the 2010 general election.

He was a Member of the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee; Vice-Chair of Parliamentary Group for Energy Studies; Chair of the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST); and Chair of Northern Group of Labour MPs.

In June 2010, IChemE (the Institution of Chemical Engineers) and NEPIC (the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster) launched the Ashok Kumar fellowship at POST in memory of Kumar. The annual fellowship will see the successful candidate spend three months at the Parliamentary Office for Science and Technology (POST). By 2017, the sixth Ashok Kumar Fellow had been appointed to work with POST she was a postgraduate engineering student, Erin Johnson, from Imperial College, London.

Kumar was a supporter of industrial engagement and the concepts of economic clusters. He regularly chaired the NEPIC MP/Industry meetings and contributed to the growth and innovation agenda of the Cluster. Tributes for his work came after his untimely death.

==Personal life==
Ashok Kumar was a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association. Of Hindu and Sikh descent, he described himself as a lifelong &quot;liberal humanist&quot;. Aston University gave him an honorary degree in July 1997.

Kumar never married or had children. He lived in Marton, Middlesbrough.

==Death==
Kumar was found dead by police in his constituency home in Canberra Road, Marton, on 15 March 2010. Police announced that he had died from natural causes.

<doc id="427698" wikidata="Q3296741" url="?curid=427698" title="Graham Central Station">
<text>Graham Central Station was an American funk band named after founder Larry Graham (formerly of Sly and the Family Stone). The name is a pun on New York City&#x27;s Grand Central Terminal, often colloquially called Grand Central Station.
==History==
===Origins===

The band&#x27;s origins date from when Santana guitarist Neal Schon formed the band Azteca in 1972 along with Larry Graham (bass guitar) and Gregg Errico (drums), both from Sly and the Family Stone, and Pete Sears (keyboards), from Hot Tuna and Jefferson Starship. Santana bass guitar player Tom Rutley moved into the bass spot with Azteca. That band, like Santana with heavy Latin influences, eventually morphed into Graham Central Station, while Schon formed Journey. The invention of electric slap bass is attributed by many (including Victor Wooten and Bootsy Collins) to Graham, which influenced many musical genres, such as funk, R&amp;B and disco.

===Highlights===
In 1974, they released the single &quot;Can You Handle It?&quot;. It peaked at number 9 on the R&amp;B charts and number 49 on the Billboard Hot 100. Graham Central Station&#x27;s biggest hit was &quot;Your Love&quot;, which charted at number 1 on the R&amp;B charts in 1975. The same year they issued a cover version of the Detroit Emeralds 1972 hit &quot;Feel the Need in Me&quot;. It reached number 18 on the R&amp;B charts and this would be the bands only hit in the UK peaking at number 53. The group also integrated gospel music into their repertoire, and played with the dichotomy between the funk/rock star image and the &quot;sanctified&quot; gospel group image. Some of their recordings feature the Tower of Power horn section.

In 2011, Graham Central Station opened for Prince on Prince&#x27;s &quot;Welcome 2 America&quot; tour.

<doc id="427704" wikidata="Q5529789" url="?curid=427704" title="Geek Love">
<text>Geek Love is a novel by American writer Katherine Dunn, published completely by Alfred A. Knopf (a division of Random House) in 1989. Dunn published parts of the novel in &quot;Mississippi Mud Book of Days&quot; (1983) and &quot;Looking Glass Bookstore Review&quot; (1988). It was a finalist for the National Book Award.

The novel is the story of a traveling carnival run by Aloysius &quot;Al&quot; Binewski and his wife &quot;Crystal&quot; Lil, and their children, seen through the eyes of their daughter Olympia (&quot;Oly&quot;), who writes the family history for her daughter Miranda. When the business begins to fail, the couple devise an idea to breed their own freak show, using various drugs and radioactive material to alter the genes of their children. The results are Arturo (&quot;Arty&quot;, also known as &quot;Aqua Boy&quot;), a boy with flippers for hands and feet; Electra (&quot;Elly&quot;) and Iphigenia (&quot;Iphy&quot;), Siamese twins; Olympia (&quot;Oly&quot;), a hunchbacked albino dwarf; and Fortunato (&quot;Chick&quot;), the normal-looking baby of the family who has telekinetic powers.

==Plot summary==
The novel takes place in two interwoven time periods: the first deals with the Binewski children&#x27;s constant struggle against each other through life. They especially have to deal with the Machiavellian Arty as he develops his own cult: Arturism. In this cult, Arty persuades people to have their limbs amputated (so that they can be like him) in their search for the principle he calls PIP (&quot;Peace, Isolation, Purity&quot;). Each member moves up in stages, losing increasingly significant chunks of their body, starting with their toes and fingers. As Arty battles his siblings to maintain control over his followers, competition between their respective freak shows slowly begins to take over their lives.

The second story is set in the present and is centered on Oly&#x27;s daughter, Miranda. Nineteen-year-old Miranda does not know Oly is her mother. She lives on a trust fund created by Oly before she gave up her daughter to be raised by nuns. This had been urged by her brother Arty, who was also Miranda&#x27;s father (not through sexual intercourse, but by the telekinetic powers of Chick, who carried Arty&#x27;s sperm directly to Oly&#x27;s ovum). Oly lives in the same rooming house as Miranda so she can &quot;spy&quot; on her. (The rooming house is run by &quot;Crystal&quot; Lil, who is so addled that she doesn&#x27;t know Oly is her daughter.) Miranda has a special defect of her own, a small tail, which she flaunts at a local fetish strip club. There she meets Mary Lick, who tries to persuade her to have the tail cut off. Lick is a wealthy woman who pays attractive women to get disfiguring operations, ostensibly so they may live up to their potential instead of becoming sex objects; it is implied, however, that Lick&#x27;s real motivation is to punish them for being more attractive than she is. Oly plans to stop Lick in order to protect her daughter.

==Genesis==
Dunn has said she remembers when she began writing the book in the late &#x27;70s, walking to Portland&#x27;s Washington Park Rose Garden, contemplating nature versus nurture. Her interest in cults also led to elements of the book. She has described the genesis of the book, which took her nearly ten years to write and more than that to publish it, in 1989. She said &quot;All the time I was working on &quot;Geek Love&quot;, it was like my own private autism.&quot;

==Publishing design==
The book&#x27;s original cover art by Chip Kidd caused a sensation at book conventions when it was introduced in 1989. Its plain, stark orange color and unusual fonts went against conventional design aesthetics. In keeping with the novel&#x27;s theme of mutation, the lettering of the title employs mutated fonts, and the book&#x27;s spine sports a five-legged dog, an alteration Kidd slipped past the publisher and which was not noticed until after the initial print run.

==Reception and legacy==
The novel was published on March 11, 1989, with an initial printing of 20,000 copies. the book sold more than 400,000 copies, 10,000 of them ebooks.

Jim Rose (of the Jim Rose Circus) has said that &quot;Dunn set the table for this whole modern freak-show vibe&quot;. Novelist Karen Russell described the prose as &quot;pyrotechnic medium so far removed from our workaday speech that it feels unfair and inaccurate to call that fire-language &#x27;English&#x27;&quot;.

The novel was a finalist for the National Book Award in 1989.

In 1992, the British band Bang Bang Machine released the single &quot;Geek Love&quot;, about the novel. The song topped the John Peel Festive 50 that year.

Tim Burton bought the rights to the book in the 1990s, but there has been no word about it since. In an interview, Dunn stated, &quot;He&#x27;s got the rights. That&#x27;s half the battle right there. Though it no longer seems like something he&#x27;d do. It&#x27;s a little too horror for him now in my opinion. Though I would love to see this film get made.&quot; The Wachowskis also have expressed interest in adapting it for the screen, and Warner Bros. decided to purchase the adaptation rights &quot;indefinitely&quot;.

In January 2004 theatre company &quot;Sensurround Stagings&quot; in Atlanta, Georgia, produced a well-received stage adaptation of &quot;Geek Love&quot;. This adaptation was reprised in Atlanta for summer 2004 and then taken to the New York Fringe Festival later that year.

<doc id="427707" wikidata="Q1049630" url="?curid=427707" title="Super Bowl XXXVIII">
<text>Super Bowl XXXVIII was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2003 season. The Patriots defeated the Panthers by a score of 32–29. The game was played at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas, on February 1, 2004. At the time, this was the most watched Super Bowl ever with 89.8 million viewers.

The Panthers were making their first ever Super Bowl appearance after posting an 11–5 regular season record. They also made it the second straight year that a team from the NFC South division made the Super Bowl, with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers winning Super Bowl XXXVII. The Patriots, led by head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady, were seeking their second Super Bowl title in three years after posting a 14–2 record. 

NFL fans and sports writers widely consider this game one of the most well-played and thrilling Super Bowls; following the game &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Peter King hailed it as the &quot;Greatest Super Bowl of all time.&quot; Although neither team could score in the first and third quarters, making it the first Super Bowl with two scoreless quarters, they ended up with a combined total of 868 yards and 61 points. The game was scoreless for a Super Bowl record 26:55 before the two teams combined for 24 points prior to halftime. The clubs then combined for a Super Bowl record 37 points in the fourth quarter. The contest was finally decided when the Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri&#x27;s 41-yard field goal was made with four seconds left. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time in his career. 

The game is also known for its controversial halftime show in which Janet Jackson&#x27;s breast, adorned with a nipple shield, was exposed by Justin Timberlake for about half a second, in what was later referred to as a &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot;. Along with the rest of the halftime show, it led to an immediate crackdown by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and widespread debate on perceived indecency in broadcasting.

==Background==
===Host selection process===
NFL owners voted to award Super Bowl XXXVIII to Houston during their November 1, 2000, meeting held in Atlanta. It marked the second Super Bowl held in the Houston area, the first was VIII played at Rice Stadium. Three Super Bowls host sites were selected during the meeting, XXXVIII, XXXIX, and XL. However, XXXIX was the only one of the three that involved a competitive voting process. The vote for XXXVIII was mostly a formality, as Houston had been tentatively preselected for the game, contingent on satisfying a series of basic requirements. No other cities were considered for XXXVIII. Back in 1998, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue had singled out San Diego (Qualcomm Stadium) as the likely host for XXXVIII. However, San Diego ultimately got XXXVII instead after the league took away that game from San Francisco. After their lone previous effort of hosting the Super Bowl (1974), the city of Houston had bid numerous times, unsuccessfully, to host the game a second time. Both Rice Stadium and later the Astrodome had been proposed, but both were rejected by owners for various reasons. Despite being indoors, the Astrodome lacked capacity, which would require temporary seating. The closest the Astrodome came to winning a bid was for XXIX when it finished a close second in the voting. Houston then lost the Oilers after 1996, and were without a NFL franchise for five seasons.

On October 6, 1999, the NFL owners voted to award the city of Houston the 32nd expansion franchise. The Houston Texans would begin play in 2002, and would play their home games in a brand new facility, Reliant Stadium. In the weeks leading up to the expansion vote, the negotiations included a promise by the NFL that Houston, if they were to win the expansion vote, would receive a Super Bowl &#x27;as soon as possible&#x27; at the new stadium. Since future host sites had already been selected through XXXVII (January 2003), the soonest Houston could host would be XXXVIII (February 2004). That satisfied the NFL&#x27;s rule that required new stadiums to wait until at least their second year of operation before hosting a Super Bowl, in order to iron out any logistical issues or construction delays. About a year after being awarded the expansion franchise, on November 1, 2000, the Houston task force, led by mayor Lee Brown, Texans owner Bob McNair, representatives from the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, and other local leaders, delivered their formal presentation. Houston was awarded XXXVIII without opposition. Jacksonville won the vote for XXXIX, and Detroit was awarded XL.

This was the first Super Bowl to be played in a retractable roof stadium. However, it would remain closed during the game. This game marked a six-month stretch for the state of Texas hosting the Super Bowl, the NCAA Final Four (Alamodome) and the MLB All-Star Game (Minute Maid Park). Super Bowl XXXVIII was the first Super Bowl to be scheduled for the first Sunday of February; subsequent Super Bowls through LV would follow this format. XXXVI had previously been held on the first Sunday of February, but that came as a result of the NFL pushing back the 2001 playoffs by a week as a result of the September 11 attacks.

===Carolina Panthers===
The Panthers made their first trip to the Super Bowl after posting a one-win regular season just two years earlier. The franchise was in its ninth year of existence, joining the league as an expansion team in 1995.

In , the Panthers suffered a franchise-worst 1–15 record. After that year, head coach George Seifert was relieved of his duties and replaced by John Fox. With Fox at the helm and the team taking advantage of the free agent market and the salary cap rules, the Panthers improved in 2002, finishing with a 7–9 record. Then in 2003, they recorded an 11–5 record to win the NFC South.

One of the free agents that Carolina signed before the 2003 season was quarterback Jake Delhomme. The Panthers signed him to be the backup to starting quarterback Rodney Peete. However, after the Panthers fell to a 17–0 third quarter deficit in their first game of the season against the Jacksonville Jaguars, gaining only one first down and 36 offensive yards, Fox immediately replaced Peete with Delhomme. Delhomme led Carolina to a 24–23 comeback victory over the Jaguars.

Delhomme became the team&#x27;s starting quarterback for the rest of the season, throwing for 3,219 yards and 19 touchdowns, with 16 interceptions. The team&#x27;s main receiving threat was third-year wide receiver Steve Smith, who also specialized as a kickoff and punt returner. Smith had 1,110 yards and seven touchdowns, rushed for 42 yards, gained 439 yards and another touchdown returning punts. Wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad was also a constant breakaway threat, recording 837 yards and three touchdowns.

However, the Panthers&#x27; strength on offense was their running game, led by running backs Stephen Davis and DeShaun Foster. Davis was the team&#x27;s leading rusher with a franchise record 1,444 yards and eight touchdowns, while Foster rushed for 429 yards and had 207 receiving yards.

On defense, Carolina&#x27;s main strength was its defensive line, anchored by defensive ends Julius Peppers (7 sacks and three forced fumbles) and Mike Rucker (12 sacks and an interception), and Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kris Jenkins (5 sacks and a fumble recovery). The secondary was led by Reggie Howard (two interceptions), Mike Minter (three interceptions and two touchdowns), Deon Grant (three interceptions), and Ricky Manning Jr. (three interceptions and a touchdown).

===New England Patriots===
Despite their victory in Super Bowl XXXVI after the 2001 season, the Patriots stumbled early in 2002, recorded a 9–7 record, and failed to make the playoffs.

Then, New England seemed to implode before the 2003 season ever started. Five days before their opening game against the Buffalo Bills, Pro Bowl safety Lawyer Milloy, one of the Patriots&#x27; defensive leaders, was unexpectedly cut by the team after refusing to restructure his contract. The move devastated many of the New England players, while Milloy immediately signed with the Bills two days later. With the Patriots seemingly in emotional disarray, Buffalo defeated New England, 31–0, with Milloy forcing an interception and recording one sack and five tackles.

However, after a 2–2 start, the Patriots ended up winning their last 12 games to earn a league-best 14–2 record.

Tom Brady, the Super Bowl XXXVI MVP, had become the team&#x27;s permanent starter in 2002 after quarterback Drew Bledsoe left the team. Brady had a solid season in 2003, completing 317 out of 527 (60.2 percent) of his passes for 3,620 yards and 23 touchdowns, with only 12 interceptions. His primary weapon was second year wide receiver Deion Branch, who had for 803 receiving yards. Another key contributor was wide receiver David Givens, who filled in for the injured starter David Patten. Givens recorded 510 receiving yards and six touchdowns. Other weapons in the passing game included veteran wide receiver Troy Brown, who had 472 receiving yards, four touchdowns, and 293 yards returning punts, and tight end Daniel Graham with 409 receiving yards, and four touchdowns. Rookie receiver Bethel Johnson returned ranked second in the NFL with a 28.2 yards per return average on kickoffs, with a return touchdown, while also having for 209 receiving yards and two touchdowns.

In the backfield, the team&#x27;s rushing game was led by running backs Antowain Smith and Kevin Faulk, who carried the ball equally. Smith was the team&#x27;s leading rusher with 642 yards and touchdowns, while Faulk rushed for 638 yards and had 440 receiving yards.

New England&#x27;s defense was retooled before the 2003 season when the team signed veteran safety Rodney Harrison as a free agent and traded for nose tackle Ted Washington. With these additions, the Patriots led the league in fewest passing yards allowed per attempt (5.64), fewest passing touchdowns allowed (11), and most interceptions (29). They also ranked fourth in fewest rushing yards allowed (1,434) and seventh in fewest total yards (4,919).

Washington helped anchor New England&#x27;s defensive line, recording 32 tackles and 2 sacks. Pro Bowl defensive end Richard Seymour also contributed with 8 sacks. Behind them, the Patriots had three outstanding linebackers: Pro Bowl linebacker Willie McGinest (5.5 sacks, two fumble recoveries and one interception), Mike Vrabel (9.5 sacks, one fumble recovery, four forced fumbles, and two interceptions), and Tedy Bruschi (131 tackles, 2 sacks, one fumble recovery, three interceptions, and two touchdowns).

Harrison became the veteran leader in the secondary, recording 92 tackles, three interceptions, and 3 sacks. Meanwhile, Pro Bowl cornerback Ty Law recorded six interceptions, cornerback (and ex-Panthers player) Tyrone Poole had six interceptions and a touchdown, while also forcing three fumbles. Rookie safety Eugene Wilson recorded four interceptions. Overall, the secondary combined for 19 interceptions.

===Playoffs===

Since the Panthers finished with the third best regular season record in the NFC, they had to win three playoff games to reach the Super Bowl. The St. Louis Rams and the Philadelphia Eagles had better regular season records at 12–4, and thus under the playoff format, each would have to win two playoff games to reach the league championship game. Against Carolina&#x27;s first opponent, the Dallas Cowboys, Delhomme threw for 273 yards and a touchdown, Davis recorded 104 rushing yards and a touchdown, and kicker John Kasay made 5 field goals, en route to a thorough 29–10 victory.

The Panthers then eliminated the Rams on the road, 29–23 in double overtime. St. Louis built a 6–0 lead early in the second quarter, but Carolina took the lead after Muhammad&#x27;s fumble recovery in the end zone. Both teams spent the rest of the second and the third quarter exchanging field goals before Brad Hoover&#x27;s 7-yard rushing touchdown gave the Panthers a 23–12 fourth quarter lead. However, the Rams rallied back with a touchdown, a successful two-point conversion, and a field goal to send the game into overtime. Both teams missed field goals in the first overtime period, but Delhomme threw a 69-yard touchdown pass to Smith on the first play of the second overtime period to win the game.

The Panthers then went on the road again to eliminate the Eagles in the NFC Championship Game, 14–3. Philadelphia was coming off of a 20–17 overtime win over the Green Bay Packers, that included quarterback Donovan McNabb&#x27;s 28-yard pass to Freddie Mitchell on a famous play known as &quot;4th and 26&quot;. This was the third consecutive NFC Championship Game appearance for Philadelphia, and thus they were heavily favored to win. But Carolina&#x27;s defense only allowed a field goal and held McNabb to just 10 of 22 completions for 100 yards. Ricky Manning also intercepted McNabb 3 times. Although Carolina&#x27;s offense only scored 14 points, it was more than enough for the team to earn their first trip to the Super Bowl with a 14–3 win.

The Panthers became the first No. 3 seed to advance to the Super Bowl since the league expanded to a 12-team playoff format in 1990. In doing so, they were also the first division winner to advance to the league championship after playing &quot;three&quot; playoff games. All other instances up to this point where teams advanced to the Super Bowl after playing all three rounds of the playoffs were wild card teams in Super Bowls XV, XX, XXVII, XXXII, XXXIV, and XXXV. Prior to Super Bowl XVII, the Miami Dolphins and Washington Redskins both won three playoff games to reach the Super Bowl, but that came during the strike-shortened 1982 season when the regular season was reduced to nine games and the playoffs were expanded to 16 teams, with no teams receiving first-round byes. Since then, there have been seven instances of teams advancing to the Super Bowl after playing three playoff games: the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XL as the No. 6 seeded team, the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLI as the No. 3 seed, the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII as the No. 5 seed, the Arizona Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII as the No. 4 seed, the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XLV as the No. 6 seed, again the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLVI as the No. 4 seed, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV as the No. 5 seed. The Colts, Cardinals, and the Giants in 2011, like the Panthers, were division winners in those years (Although in the Colts case, they played the No. 4 seeded New England Patriots in the AFC Championship that year, ensuring at least the second division winner to play three rounds to make it to the Super Bowl.), and all but the Cardinals went on to win it all. The Super Bowl would mark the third game (out of four) of the playoffs in which Carolina scored 29 points.

Meanwhile, the Patriots first defeated the Tennessee Titans, 17–14, in one of the coldest games in NFL history, with temperatures reaching 4 °F (−15 °C). New England jumped to 14–7 lead in the first half with a touchdown pass by Brady and a touchdown run from Smith. However, Tennessee quarterback (and Co-NFL MVP; shared with Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning) Steve McNair&#x27;s 11-yard touchdown pass to receiver Derrick Mason tied the game in the third period. With 4:06 remaining in the game, Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri made a 46-yard field goal to take the lead. New England&#x27;s defense later clinched a victory as they stopped the Titans from scoring on fourth down on their last drive of the game.

New England then eliminated the Indianapolis Colts, 24–14, in the AFC Championship Game. The Colts entered the game leading the NFL in passing yards and ranked third in total offensive yards. With quarterback Peyton Manning, wide receiver Marvin Harrison, and running back Edgerrin James, the Colts had scored 79 points in their 2 playoff victories against the Denver Broncos and the Kansas City Chiefs, including a 38–31 victory over the Chiefs in the first punt-less game in NFL playoff history. However, New England&#x27;s defense dominated the Colts, only allowing 14 points, intercepting 4 passes from Co-league MVP Manning (3 of them by Ty Law), and forcing a safety. Although New England&#x27;s offense only scored one touchdown, Vinatieri scored 5 field goals to make up the difference.

==Broadcasting==
===United States===

The game was broadcast on television in the United States by CBS, with Greg Gumbel handling the play-by-play duties and color commentator Phil Simms in the broadcast booth. Armen Keteyian and Bonnie Bernstein roamed the sidelines. Jim Nantz hosted all the events with help from his fellow cast members from &quot;The NFL Today&quot;: Dan Marino, Deion Sanders, and Boomer Esiason. This would be the final Super Bowl game Greg Gumbel would call; as before the 2004 season began, he and Nantz would switch roles; though by the time CBS next aired a Super Bowl; James Brown was brought in as host of &quot;The NFL Today&quot; while Gumbel had moved to a secondary play-by-play role.

For its Super Bowl lead-out program, CBS aired the season premiere for &quot;&quot;.

Westwood One carried the game nationwide over terrestrial radio with Marv Albert on play-by-play and Boomer Esiason on color commentary, with Jim Gray hosting the pregame and halftime shows. Locally, Gil Santos and Gino Cappelletti called the game for the Patriots and Bill Rosinski and Eugene Robinson served that position for the Panthers. The game scored a 40.7 rating and over 43.4 million of household, making it the highest rated Super Bowl telecast since 1999 and making it watched Super Bow at the time with 89.8 million of average viewers. Also, Game experienced the highest traffic online at the time. Nielsen/NetRatings reported that over a million of user loging up by 266% over the prior day and 1.4 million of users visited ESPN.com.

===International===
The game also aired in United Kingdom and Ireland on Channel 5 (British TV channel) and Sky Sports, Australia on public channel SBS, Japan on NHK BS1, China on CCTV-5, Austria on ORF 1 and Sweden on TV3.

In Mexico, the game was not carried as usual by either of the major free-to-air national television networks, making it a cable-exclusive event for the first and to date only time ever.

==Entertainment==
===Pregame ceremonies===
Both teams passed on the opportunity for their starters to be introduced individually before the game, a move perpetuated by the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI. As the game was held in the same city as the Johnson Space Center, the lost crew of the &quot;Columbia&quot; was honored in a pregame tribute by singer Josh Groban, performing &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;. Also appearing on the field was the crew of STS-114, the &quot;Return to Flight&quot; Space Shuttle mission that eventually launched &quot;Space Shuttle Discovery&quot; on July 26, 2005. Houston-native Beyoncé then sang the national anthem. Aerosmith performed Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go and Dream On as part of the pre-show ceremony.

The coin toss ceremony featured former NFL players and Texas natives Earl Campbell, Ollie Matson, Don Maynard, Y. A. Tittle, Mike Singletary, Gene Upshaw. Tittle tossed the coin.

The NFL logo was painted at midfield for the first time since Super Bowl XXX, and the Super Bowl XXXVIII logo was placed on the 25-yard lines. From Super Bowls XXXI through XXXVII, the Super Bowl logo was painted at midfield, and the helmets of the teams painted at the 30-yard lines. From Super Bowl VI through Super Bowl XXX, the NFL logo was painted on the 50-yard line, except for Super Bowls XXV and XXIX. The Super Bowl XXV logo was painted at midfield and the NFL logo was painted at each 35-yard line. In Super Bowl XXIX, the NFL 75th Anniversary logo was painted at midfield with the Super Bowl logo at each 30-yard line.

As the designated home team in the annual rotation between AFC and NFC teams, the Patriots elected to wear their home navy uniforms with silver pants, while the Panthers wore their road white uniforms with white pants.

===Halftime show===

The most controversial and widely discussed moment of Super Bowl XXXVIII came during halftime. The show was produced by Viacom&#x27;s MTV and CBS Sports, and was sponsored by America Online&#x27;s TopSpeed software for dial-up Internet service. The show was themed supposedly around MTV&#x27;s Choose or Lose vote campaign; however, beyond some flag imagery, Jessica Simpson&#x27;s declaration that Houston should &quot;Choose to Party!&quot; and a vague call to action for younger persons to vote (in a celebrity montage the first minute of the program and an audio outro about choices), the theme was not called out for the remainder of the show.

After a brief appearance by Simpson, the show began with a joint performance by marching bands the Spirit of Houston, from the University of Houston, and the &quot;Ocean of Soul&quot; of Texas Southern University. Next, Janet Jackson made her first appearance, singing &quot;All for You&quot;. Then, P. Diddy, Nelly, and Kid Rock appeared respectively, and performed a mixture of their hits.

After Jackson&#x27;s performance of her song &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot;, Justin Timberlake appeared, and he and Jackson sang a duet of Timberlake&#x27;s song &quot;Rock Your Body&quot;. The performance featured many suggestive dance moves by both Timberlake and Jackson. As the song reached the final line, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna have you naked by the end of this song,&quot; Timberlake pulled off a part of Jackson&#x27;s costume, revealing her outer right breast (adorned with a large, sun-shaped nipple shield, a piece of jewelry worn to accentuate the appearance of a nipple piercing). CBS quickly cut to an aerial view of the stadium; however, the action was too late to be effective. Many people considered this indecent exposure, and numerous viewers contacted the network to complain, saying it was inappropriate in the context of a football game. This was the most rewatched moment in TiVo history.

Just before the start of the second half, a British streaker, Mark Roberts, ran onto the field disguised as a referee, undressed, and performed a dance wearing only a thong. He was tackled to the ground by Patriots linebacker Matt Chatham and arrested. It is customary for American television to avoid broadcasting such events, but it was later shown on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Roberts received a $1,000 fine for trespassing.

==Game summary==
This game is noted for its unusual scoring pattern between the teams. Nearly 90 percent of the first half and all of the third quarter were scoreless. Twenty-four points were scored in the last three minutes of the first half, and a record 37 points were scored in the fourth quarter.

===First quarter===
Most of the first half was an offensive struggle, with neither team able to score until late in the second quarter, despite several early scoring opportunities. After Carolina was forced to punt on their opening drive, Patriots wide receiver Troy Brown gave his team great field position with a 28-yard return to the Carolina 47-yard line. The Patriots subsequently marched to the 13-yard line, aided by quarterback Tom Brady&#x27;s completions to wide receiver Deion Branch and Brown for 16 and 12 yards, respectively, but the Panthers&#x27; defense tightened up in the red zone. After Brady threw two incompletions and was flagged for a false start, kicker Adam Vinatieri attempted a 31-yard field goal, but he missed it wide right. After the next three possessions resulted in punts, New England again got the ball with great field position, receiving Todd Sauerbrun&#x27;s 40-yard punt at the Panthers&#x27; 49-yard line. The Patriots then drove to the 31-yard line, but on third down, linebacker Will Witherspoon tackled Brown for a 10-yard loss on an end-around play, pushing the Patriots out of field goal range and forcing them to punt again.

===Second quarter===
After the teams exchanged punts twice going into the second quarter, New England drove 57 yards to the Carolina 18-yard line with just over 6 minutes left in the half, but once again they failed to score as Carolina kept them out of the end zone and Vinatieri&#x27;s 36-yard field goal attempt was blocked by defensive tackle Shane Burton.

Meanwhile, the Carolina offense was overwhelmed by the New England defense, with quarterback Jake Delhomme completing just one out of his first nine passes, being sacked three times and fumbling after the third sack. The fumble occurred three plays after Vinatieri&#x27;s second missed field goal; Delhomme lost the ball while being hit by linebacker Mike Vrabel, and defensive tackle Richard Seymour recovered the ball at the Carolina 20-yard line. By this point of the game, the Panthers had suffered a net loss of nine yards on 20 offensive snaps.

Two plays later, New England faced 3rd-and-12, but Brady scrambled 12 yards to the 5-yard line for a first down, then completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to Branch on the next play. The play was a play-action fake to running back Antowain Smith. Panthers linebacker Dan Morgan bit on the route, causing the touchdown. Branch&#x27;s touchdown came after 26:55 had elapsed in the game, setting the record for the longest amount of time a Super Bowl remained scoreless. The play also suddenly set off a scoring explosion from both teams in the closing minutes of the first half.

The Panthers stormed down the field on their ensuing possession, driving 95 yards in eight plays, which featured two receptions by wide receiver Ricky Proehl for 28 yards and a 23-yard catch by wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad, and ended with a 39-yard touchdown completion from Delhomme to wide receiver Steve Smith with just 1:07 left in the half.

The Patriots immediately countered with a 6-play, 78-yard scoring drive of their own. Starting from their own 22-yard line, Brady completed a 12-yard pass to wide receiver David Givens. Then after throwing an incompletion, Brady completed a 52-yard strike to Branch, who caught the ball at the Carolina 24-yard line in stride before being tackled at the 14-yard line by cornerback Ricky Manning. Three plays later, Givens caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from Brady to give New England a 14–7 lead with only 18 seconds left in the half. New England decided to squib kick the ensuing kickoff to prevent a long return, but their plan backfired as Carolina tight end Kris Mangum picked up the ball at his own 35-yard line and returned it 12 yards to the 47. The Patriots expected a pass play from the Panthers, but instead running back Stephen Davis ran for 21 yards on the next play to set up kicker John Kasay&#x27;s 50-yard field goal as time expired in the half, cutting Carolina&#x27;s deficit to 14–10.

===Third quarter===
The third quarter was scoreless as each team exchanged punts twice. However, with 3:57 left in the period, the Patriots put together a 71-yard, 8-play scoring drive, featuring tight end Daniel Graham&#x27;s 33-yard reception to advance to the Carolina 9-yard line.

===Fourth quarter===
Antowain Smith then capped off the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run on the second play on the fourth quarter to increase their lead, 21–10. The score changed the story of the game by sparking one of the biggest offensive explosions in Super Bowl history, with both teams scoring a combined 37 points in the last 15 minutes, the most ever in a single quarter of a Super Bowl. 

The Patriots looked gassed, and Carolina took advantage of it. Delhomme started out Carolina&#x27;s ensuing drive with a 13-yard completion to Muhammad. After guard Kevin Donnalley committed a false start penalty on the next play, Delhomme completed a pair of passes to Smith for a total gain of 40 yards. Running back DeShaun Foster then scored on a 33-yard touchdown run, cutting the Panthers&#x27; deficit to 21–16 after Delhomme&#x27;s two-point conversion pass to Muhammad fell incomplete. The Patriots responded on their ensuing possession by driving to the Carolina 9-yard line, only to turn the ball over when cornerback Reggie Howard intercepted a pass from Brady in the end zone and returned it to his own 10-yard line. Then on third down from his own 15-yard line, Delhomme threw for the longest play from scrimmage in Super Bowl history, an 85-yard touchdown completion to Muhammad. Carolina&#x27;s two-point conversion attempt failed again when Delhomme threw the ball over wide receiver Kevin Dyson&#x27;s head, but they took their first lead of the game, 22–21, with 6:53 remaining. It was the first time in Super Bowl history a team down more than 10 points during the fourth quarter had come back to take the lead. Three other times teams have come back to tie the game; the Tennessee Titans against the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXIV, the Rams against the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI, and the Patriots against the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI.

However, Carolina&#x27;s lead did not last, as New England retook the lead on their next drive, advancing 68 yards with the aid of a pair of completions from Brady to Givens for 43 total yards. Once again, the Patriots were faced with third down and goal, but this time they scored with Brady&#x27;s 1-yard touchdown pass to Vrabel, who had lined up in an eligible tight end position. This marked the second time in Super Bowl history where a defensive player was brought on to score on offense; the first time being when Chicago Bears defensive tackle William &quot;The Refrigerator&quot; Perry scored an offensive touchdown during Super Bowl XX. On a two-point conversion attempt, running back Kevin Faulk took a direct snap and ran into the end zone to make the score 29–22 in favor of New England. Despite amassing over 1,000 combined yards, Faulk&#x27;s two-point conversion constituted the only points he scored all season. This was also the Patriots&#x27; only two-point conversion attempt all season.

The Panthers countered on their next possession. Foster started the drive with a 9-yard run and a 7-yard reception. After that, Delhomme completed a 19-yard pass to Muhammad, followed by a 31-yard completion to Proehl. Proehl, who caught the fourth quarter game-tying touchdown pass against the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI two years earlier for the St. Louis Rams, then finished the drive with a 12-yard touchdown reception, tying the game, 29–29, with 1:08 to play in regulation and it appeared that the game would be the first Super Bowl ever to go into overtime.

However, Kasay kicked the ensuing kickoff out of bounds, giving New England the ball on their own 40-yard line. Brady led the Patriots offense down the field with a 13-yard pass to Brown on second down. An offensive pass interference penalty on Brown pushed New England back to their own 43-yard line, but another 13-yard pass to Brown and a 4-yard pass to Graham brought up a critical 3rd-and-3 from the Carolina 40-yard line. The Panthers&#x27; defense could not prevent the Patriots from gaining the first down, as Brady completed a 17-yard pass to Branch. On the next play, Vinatieri kicked a 41-yard field goal to give New England the lead, 32–29, with four seconds left in the game. Carolina failed on their last chance, as wide receiver Rod Smart was tackled at his own 20-yard line by linebacker Matt Chatham, and the Patriots had won their second Super Bowl in three years. This was (at the time) just the fourth Super Bowl to be decided on a field goal in the final seconds (Super Bowl V was won on a last second kick by the Baltimore Colts&#x27; Jim O&#x27;Brien to defeat the Dallas Cowboys, Super Bowl XXV had the Buffalo Bills&#x27; Scott Norwood miss his field goal chance against the New York Giants, and in Super Bowl XXXVI Vinatieri made his to defeat the St. Louis Rams, and later in Super Bowl LVII, Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker kicked a late field goal to defeat the Philadelphia Eagles).

===Statistical overview===
The game set a number of marks for offensive production. The two teams combined for 868 yards of total offense, the second-highest total in Super Bowl history. Both starting quarterbacks threw for at least 300 yards for only the second time in Super Bowl history, with Dan Marino and Joe Montana each passing for at least 300 yards in Super Bowl XIX. This was also only the second Super Bowl to feature one 100-yard receiving performance on each team, with Deion Branch and Muhsin Muhammad each reaching 100 yards. Andre Reed and Michael Irvin first accomplished the feat in Super Bowl XXVII.

The 37 total points scored in the 4th quarter were the most combined points in a 4th quarter in a Super Bowl and the most in any quarter by two teams. Washington&#x27;s 35 points in Super Bowl XXII was the previous high for most combined points in a single quarter in a Super Bowl. The fourth quarter was the second in Super Bowl history to have five touchdowns scored in a single quarter, the first being when the Redskins had five in Super Bowl XXII in the second quarter. It was also the first time in Super Bowl history that both teams would score at least two touchdowns in the same quarter.

Delhomme finished the game with 16 completions out of 33 attempts for 323 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a passer rating of 113.6. He was seen standing on the field during the Patriots&#x27; post-game celebration; he later commented: &quot;I wanted to catch up to the moment of what it feels like to be on the other side, to be on this side, the losing side. To let it sink in, to hurt, so when we start practice in the fall, the two-a-days and there are days during the season when I&#x27;m tired and I want to go home, but I need to watch that extra film. I want to get back there, but I want to get on the other side of that field. They rope you off, the losing team basically. I just want to get on the other side of that rope. I just wanted to watch and let it sink in and hurt a little bit. When I have a tough day, I&#x27;ll just think about that feeling and it will make me dig down just a little deeper.&quot;

Muhsin Muhammad caught four passes for 140 yards, an average of 35 yards per catch, and a touchdown. Steve Smith caught four passes for 80 yards and a touchdown. He also returned a punt for two yards, and returned a kickoff for 30 yards, giving him 112 total yards. Proehl caught four passes for 71 yards and a touchdown. Proehl joined Jerry Rice as one of only two players to score touchdowns with two teams in Super Bowls.

Tom Brady&#x27;s 32 completions were the most in Super Bowl history. His 48 attempts were the most for a winning quarterback. His 354 yards passing is now the fifth best total in Super Bowl history. Brady&#x27;s passer rating for this game was 100.5. Branch was the top receiver of the game with 10 receptions for 143 yards and a touchdown. Brown caught 8 passes for 76 yards and returned four punts for 40 yards. Antowain Smith was the top rusher of the game with 83 yards and a touchdown.

* Most sportsbooks had the Patriots as seven-point favorites entering the game. As the Patriots only won by three points, the Patriots failed to cover this spread.
* The over-under bet was set at 37.5 by most sportsbooks. As the total combined score of the two teams was 61 points, the over bet won.

<text>John Wentworth (March 30, 1719 – May 17, 1781) was a jurist, soldier, and leader of the American Revolution in New Hampshire. He was often referred to as the Judge or as Colonel John to distinguish him from his cousin, the John Wentworth who was the colony&#x27;s governor. He is descended from early New Hampshire settler William Wentworth and is a great grandfather to John Wentworth (Illinois).

==Biography==
This John Wentworth was born in Dover, New Hampshire. After service in the French and Indian War, he moved to Somersworth and was elected to the colonial assembly from 1768 to 1775. In that assembly he served several terms as speaker. He served as a judge of common pleas, and starting in 1776 as a justice in the New Hampshire supreme court, in spite of the fact that he neither studied nor practiced law.

As the revolution neared, he was active in the committees of correspondence, and later the Committee of Safety. After the Assembly was prorogued in 1774, a rebel counterpart met as the Exeter Convention. At their first meeting, on July 21 he was elected president. He died in Somersworth.

==Family==
John survived his third wife, and left nine out of fourteen children. John&#x27;s son, John Wentworth Jr., represented New Hampshire in the Continental Congress.

<text>The grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) is a small New World sparrow. It belongs to the genus &quot;Ammodramus,&quot; which contains three species that inhabit grasslands and prairies. Grasshopper sparrows are sometimes found in crop fields and they will readily colonize reclaimed grassland. In the core of their range, grasshopper sparrows are dependent upon large areas of grassland where they avoid trees and shrubs. They seek out heterogenous patches of prairie that contain clumps of dead grass or other vegetation where they conceal their nest, and also contain barer ground where they forage for insects (especially grasshoppers), spiders, and seeds. Grasshopper sparrows are unusual among New World sparrows in that they sing two distinct song types, the prevalence of which varies with the nesting cycle. The primary male song, a high trill preceded by a stereotyped series of short chips, is reminiscent of the sounds of grasshoppers and is the origin of this species&#x27; name. Like some other birds of the central North American grasslands, this species also moves around a lot, not only via annual migrations, but individuals frequently disperse between breeding attempts or breeding seasons. Grasshopper sparrows are in steep decline across their range, even in the core of the breeding distribution in the tallgrass prairies of the central Great Plains. The Florida grasshopper sparrow (&quot;Ammodramus savannarum floridanus&quot;) is highly endangered.

==Taxonomy==
The grasshopper sparrow was described in 1713 by English parson and naturalist John Ray based on a specimen collected in Jamaica. It was described again and illustrated in 1725 by the naturalist and collector Hans Sloane. Both authors used the English name &quot;Savanna bird&quot;. When the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin revised and expanded Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1789 he included the grasshopper sparrow. He placed it with the finches in the genus &quot;Fringilla&quot;, coined the binomial name &quot;Fringilla savannarum&quot; and cited the earlier authors. The grasshopper sparrow is now placed with two other American sparrows in the genus &quot;Ammodramus&quot; that was introduced by William Swainson in 1827.

Twelve subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;A. s. perpallidus&quot; (Coues, 1872) – southwest Canada and central, west USA
* &quot;A. s. ammolegus&quot; Oberholser, 1942 – south Arizona (southwest USA) and northwest Mexico
* &quot;A. s. pratensis&quot; (Vieillot, 1818) – southeast Canada and east USA
* &quot;A. s. floridanus&quot; (Mearns, 1902) – Florida (southeast USA)
* &quot;A. s. bimaculatus&quot; Swainson, 1827 – central, south Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica
* &quot;A. s. beatriceae&quot; Olson, 1980 – central Panama
* &quot;A. s. cracens&quot; (Bangs &amp; Peck, 1908) – north, east Guatemala, Belize, east Honduras and northeast Nicaragua
* &quot;A. s. caucae&quot; Chapman, 1912 – Colombia
* &quot;A. s. savannarum&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – Jamaica
* &quot;A. s. intricatus&quot; Hartert, EJO, 1907 – Hispaniola
* &quot;A. s. borinquensis&quot; Peters, JL, 1917 – Puerto Rico
* &quot;A. s. caribaeus&quot; (Hartert, EJO, 1902) – Netherlands Antilles

==Description==
These small sparrows measure in length, span about across the wings and weigh from , with an average of . Adults have upper parts streaked with brown, grey, black and white; they have a light brown breast, a white belly and a short brown tail. Their face is light brown with a white eye ring and a dark brown crown with a central narrow light stripe. Adults sport bright yellow feathers at the crook of their underwing, and have a yellow-to-amber patch above their lores. Males and females cannot be distinguished by their plumage, and young birds molt into adult plumage within a few months of fledging.

==Distribution and habitat==

Their breeding habitat is open fields and prairie grasslands across southern Canada, the United States, Mexico and Central America, the Caribbean. There is a small endangered population in the Andes of Colombia and (perhaps only formerly) Ecuador. In the central USA, birds are quick to locate newly available habitat, and can be attracted to sites by playing conspecific song. The spatial distribution of territories on the landscape can be clumped with several individuals defending territories near to one another interspersed by large areas of unused and apparently suitable habitat. The reasons for this clumping are elusive; aggregation is not related to group defense against predators or brood parasite, cooperative care, extra-pair matings, or kin selection. Appropriate habitat is strongly influenced by plant structure and precipitation amounts during previous seasons. Grasshopper sparrows avoid woody vegetation, and in the wetter parts of their range, prefer fields that are burned every 2–3 years (which reduces encroachment of trees and shrubs) and seek out areas that are moderately grazed by cattle or bison.

==Behavior==

=== Movement ===

==== Migration ====
Subspecies of grasshopper sparrows differ in their migratory behavior. The birds breeding in most of the eastern US and southern Canada (&quot;A. s. pratensis&quot;) migrate latitudinally up to several thousand kms each year, spending winters along the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean. The birds breeding through most of the Western part of their North American range (&quot;A. s. perpallidus&quot;) winter from Texas west to California, and south into the highland desert grasslands of northern and central Mexico. &quot;A. s. ammolegus&quot;, which breeds in the desert grasslands of SE Arizona, SW New Mexico, and adjoining states in northern Mexico, appears to be a short-distance, partial migrant, with some birds remaining resident year-round, and others likely moving further south in winter. Birds of multiple breeding populations and subspecies winter together in SE Arizona. Grasshopper sparrows breeding outside of North America, including those living in the Caribbean, Central America, as well as the Florida grasshopper sparrow are not known to migrate.  

Males typically migrate north in the spring a week or two earlier than do females. Data from light level geolocators indicate that males are present on the breeding grounds from April to October, consistent with birds completing their annual molt prior to migration. Individuals migrated an average of ~2,500 km over ~30 days. Birds migrate mostly over land, make few stop-overs of short duration, and travel at about 82 km/day. Data from the Motus network largely confirm the migratory patterns gleaned from prior work. However, relatively few movement tracks for this species exist so far, potentially due to the sparrows&#x27; secretive behavior during most of the year other than the breeding season. Few recoveries of banded birds have ever been made, especially at sites other than a birds’ initial banding location. In Oklahoma, grasshopper sparrows are one of the species most frequently found dead after colliding with windows, despite rarely being detected in migration.

==== Dispersal ====
In Maryland, a study of natal dispersal (the movement from a natal site to the site of first reproduction) revealed that most fledglings remained within their natal habitat during the summer months after fledging, and most recaptured fledglings were encountered within a couple hundred meters of their natal nests. Although distances recaptured from the nest increased with time, the average fledgling was recaptured only 346 meters from its nest and recaptured 33 days after fledging. The longest distance detected was 1.6 kilometers, which was accomplished in less than 20 days. Data on first-year return rates (or &quot;philopatry&quot;, the inverse of natal dispersal) is limited, but in NE Kansas, ~2% of young birds returned to the site to breed in the subsequent year.

Grasshopper sparrows are unusual in their particularly high rates of breeding dispersal (i.e., one-way movements between successive breeding sites). Their high dispersal tendency may be due to the dynamic nature of the grassland environments on which they depend Like some other grassland-dependent species, their dispersal movements lead them to be called semi-nomadic, as they opportunistically take advantage of suitable habitats as they appear on the landscape. Return rates of adult grasshopper sparrows to their previous breeding sites (site fidelity) differs widely between populations. Site fidelity is far higher in eastern parts of the breeding range, with &gt;50% of adult males returning to breed in subsequent seasons at a site in Connecticut and over 70% in Maryland. In contrast, 0% of adult males in Nebraska returned to breed in subsequent years, 8.9% returned in Montana, and 20% returned in California. In northeastern Kansas, individual birds also commonly disperse within seasons between nesting attempts. Between 30 and 75% of birds move over 100 m within season, and individuals were detected defending new territories or nesting up to 8.9 km from areas they occupied earlier in the season. Within-season breeding dispersal decisions relate to nest success; more birds moved following nest failure, and birds that dispersed experienced lower brood parasitism and higher nesting success following movements. Little is known about the movements of birds during winter, but inter-annual variation in abundance in northern Mexican grasslands is positively related to related to broad-scale variation in vegetation, rainfall the previous summer, and plant productivity.

=== Breeding ===
Grasshopper sparrows are a socially monogamous species, but rates of extra-pair mating can be high (e.g., 48.5% of nests contained an extra-pair young in Kansas), and even instances of cooperative parenting have been documented. In the spring, males select and defend territories before being joined by a female. Over the course of the breeding season, birds can raise multiple broods, either with the same mate or a different mate. In the more southern regions of the species range, pairs may produce 2–4 broods while pairs further north are limited by shorter summers leading to 1–2 nesting attempts.

Nest building

Females construct nests over the course of a couple of days. Grasshopper sparrows build inconspicuous, dome-shaped nests on the ground, typically very well hidden amongst grasses and forbs. The nests have a small side opening and are usually made of a mix of dead and live grasses. Nests are built on the breeding pair&#x27;s territory in areas away from shrubs and trees.

Offspring

Females typically lay between 4–5 eggs per clutch. Grasshopper sparrow eggs are smooth and oval-shaped. They are a cream-white color, with reddish-brown speckling that is concentrated towards the larger end of the egg. Females incubate the eggs from 10 to 12 days, and nestlings fledge after 6–9 days. For the first few days of the nestling period, females primarily feed young, but both parents feed during the latter half of the nestling period. In one study, nonparental helpers were documented attending to broods and feeding young, but this behavior is apparently not ubiquitous. Nestlings are fed an arthropod rich diet, particularly prey ~15–40 mm long, and preferentially select acridid grasshoppers, spiders, and small beetles. Upon leaving the nest, the offspring often remain in the area. Parents provide post-fledging care, but the duration and level of care is unknown.

Brood parasitism

Grasshopper sparrows are a common host of the brown-headed cowbird, a brood parasite which lays their eggs in the nests of other species. Cowbirds can be detrimental to host species because they often remove host eggs and nestlings or destroy nests to initiate another nesting attempt, allowing for future parasitism. However, they do not necessarily reduce the chances of nests successfully fledging young. The rate of brood parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds varies across the grasshopper sparrow&#x27;s range and depends on habitat characteristics such as the amount of woody vegetation and whether the land is grazed. In surveyed populations, 2–65% of nests were parasitized by cowbirds.

Causes of nest failure

Only 30–50% of nests successfully raise at least one or more nestlings that fledge the nest. The majority of grasshopper sparrow nests fail as the result of predation. Snakes, small mammals such as rats, larger mammals such as skunks, armadillos, hogs, and opossums, and even ants have been observed eating eggs and nestlings. Other causes of nest failure include flooding of the nest cup due to rainfall, trampling by livestock or humans, and abandonment by the parents.

==Vocalizations==
=== Primary song ===
The grasshopper sparrow&#x27;s &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;buzz&quot; song has one to four introductory notes followed by a long high pitched trill,&#x27;tup zeeee&#x27; or &#x27;tip tup zeee&#x27;, and because of its similarity to a grasshopper sound, accounts for the name of the bird. There are small variations in the song between individuals, populations, and subspecies. This song is primarily used for defense, territory, or advertising to the other males and females. The males will mainly use the primary song from mid-April, when they get to the breeding ground, to mid-August, when they are about to leave the breeding grounds. It is the principal song heard early in the season, and during each breeding cycle, and the only song that unpaired birds sing. Birds sing from a grass or forb stalks, poles, fence posts or fence lines, or low shrubs.

=== Alternate song ===

Male grasshopper sparrows sing &quot;alternate&quot;, warble&quot;, or &quot;sustained&quot;, songs during the breeding season to establish and maintain pair bonds. The alternate song is more musical than the primary song and is usually delivered from fixed perches or in flight. The song consists of a 5–15 second series of short notes varying slightly in pitch, and the entire sequence may be repeated two to four times. Paired males will start singing alternate song ~5 days after arrival on territory, with frequency of alternate song increasing as birds pair. The alternate song diminishes towards late-July as the breeding season winds down. Considerable variation in alternate song exists within and between populations and subspecies; further study is needed.

=== Male trill ===
The trill of a male grasshopper sparrow (ti-tu-ti-tu-ti-i-i-i-i) is one of his least common vocalizations and is difficult to detect. Sometimes called the nesting song, it consists of short, rapid notes and a downward trill. The song is usually used after two grasshopper sparrows form a pair and is mostly made in response to the female. The male trills near the nest either from the ground or a perch. The male trill functions to strengthen pair bonds and to tell the female/young the male is approaching the nest.

=== Female trill ===
The female trill (ti-ti-i-i-i-i-i) is used to announce presence in male&#x27;s territory. The primary functions of the female trill is to declare her presence to the male, maintain the pair bond, and signal to both the male and the young that she is approaching the nest. Given the high rate of extra-pair copulations in this species, the trill may also function to announce her presence to a territorial male other than the social male. Females usually call from the ground, concealed in grass, and may call independently or in response to primary or sustained song. Females call from pair formation until the end of nesting.

=== Call/chip ===
The call or chip is used by both sexes and is used as an alarm note. Depending on its intensity, the sound varies. High intensity alarms resemble a slow clicking, and low intensity alarms are a sharp &#x27;tik&#x27;. The chip is used around the nest by both the female and male using single and double &#x27;chip-chip&#x27; calls. This call can be used during feeding when they utter a single, high-pitched chip.

=== Song learning ===
Captive-rearing experiments revealed that grasshopper sparrows are predisposed to learn two distinct songs but must hear species-typical songs to develop a normal sounding song. Grasshopper sparrows can learn song from pre-recorded tutors but are more inclined to learn songs that are similar to live tutors, suggesting they use information from song models but do not directly imitate conspecific song. It is likely that in the case of alternate songs, exact notes are imitated but sequences are invented or improvised. This may be beneficial for pair bonding if females identify individual males by their distinct alternate song.

== Conservation ==

=== Current status ===
The global population of grasshopper sparrows in 2016 was estimated to be around 31,000,000 by the PIF North America Landbird Conservation Plan. It was also estimated that the population had undergone a 68% decrease between the years 1970 and 2014 with an annual decline of about 2.59%. The 2022 State of the Birds reported a long-term, range-wide decline of 2.13% per year, and a more recent decline of 3.48% per year. The leading cause of population decline across its range is linked to habitat loss and management, particularly conversion of grasslands to intensive agriculture and encroachment of shrubs and trees. Despite declining population sizes, grasshopper sparrows are classified as Least Concern by the IUCN and are also not included as a &quot;Bird of Conservation Concern&quot; by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) on a national level. The Florida grasshopper sparrow subspecies (&quot;Ammodramus savannarum floridanus&quot;) is classified as endangered by  the USFW. This subspecies hit an all time population low of 15 breeding pairs in 2017, and reported a population of 120 in 2022.

==== Habitat management ====
The majority of the former breeding range of grasshopper sparrows in North America has been converted to intensive agriculture or encroached by shrubs and trees. Likewise, these birds are experiencing a loss of wintering habitats, particularly within the Chihuahuan grasslands, due to similar impacts (conversion to agriculture and woody encroachment). Because grasshopper sparrows require areas of dense dead grass for nesting, sparse vegetation for foraging, and little to no woody plants, they are vulnerable to management practices such as high-intensity grazing accompanied by annual burning, fire suppression leading to woody encroachment, and haying that can destroy nests if it occurs during the breeding season. Ideal grazing intensities and fire frequencies vary across their range depending on climate, but areas with moderate grazing by cattle or bison, prescribed burning every 2–3 years, and removal of woody plants tend to support the highest densities of grasshopper sparrows in the Southern great plains.
