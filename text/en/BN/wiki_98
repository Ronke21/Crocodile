<text>Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based psychotherapy that began with efforts to treat personality disorders and interpersonal conflicts. Evidence suggests that DBT can be useful in treating mood disorders and suicidal ideation as well as for changing behavioral patterns such as self-harm and substance use. DBT evolved into a process in which the therapist and client work with acceptance and change-oriented strategies and ultimately balance and synthesize them—comparable to the philosophical dialectical process of thesis and antithesis, followed by synthesis.

This approach was developed by Marsha M. Linehan, a psychology researcher at the University of Washington. She defines it as &quot;a synthesis or integration of opposites&quot;. DBT was designed to help people increase their emotional and cognitive regulation by learning about the triggers that lead to reactive states and by helping to assess which coping skills to apply in the sequence of events, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to help avoid undesired reactions. Linehan later disclosed to the public her own struggles and belief that she suffers from borderline personality disorder.

DBT grew out of a series of failed attempts to apply the standard cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) protocols of the late 1970s to chronically suicidal clients. Research on its effectiveness in treating other conditions has been fruitful. DBT has been used by practitioners to treat people with depression, drug and alcohol problems, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injuries (TBI), binge-eating disorder, and mood disorders. Research indicates that DBT might help patients with symptoms and behaviors associated with spectrum mood disorders, including self-injury. Work also suggests its effectiveness with sexual-abuse survivors and chemical dependency.

DBT combines standard cognitive-behavioral techniques for emotion regulation and reality-testing with concepts of distress tolerance, acceptance, and mindful awareness largely derived from contemplative meditative practice. DBT is based upon the biosocial theory of mental illness and is the first therapy that has been experimentally demonstrated to be generally effective in treating borderline personality disorder (BPD). The first randomized clinical trial of DBT showed reduced rates of suicidal gestures, psychiatric hospitalizations, and treatment dropouts when compared to usual treatment. A meta-analysis found that DBT reached moderate effects in individuals with BPD. DBT may not be appropriate as a universal intervention, as it was shown to be harmful or have null effects in a study of an adapted DBT skills-training intervention in adolescents in schools, though conclusions of iatrogenic harm are unwarranted as the majority of participants did not significantly engage with the assigned activities with higher engagement predicting more positive outcomes.

==Overview==
DBT is sometimes considered a part of the &quot;third wave&quot; of cognitive-behavioral therapy, as DBT adapts CBT to assist patients in dealing with stress. DBT focuses on treating disorders that are characterised by impulsivity and emotional dysregulation.

DBT strives to have the patient view the therapist as an accepting ally rather than an adversary in the treatment of psychological issues: many treatments at this time left patients feeling &quot;criticized, misunderstood, and invalidated&quot; due to the way these methods &quot;focused on changing cognitions and behaviors.&quot; Accordingly, the therapist aims to accept and the client&#x27;s feelings at any given time, while, nonetheless, informing the client that some feelings and behaviors are maladaptive, and showing them better alternatives. In particular, DBT targets self-harm and suicide attempts by identifying the function of that behavior and obtaining that function safely through DBT coping skills. DBT focuses on the client acquiring new skills and changing their behaviors, with the ultimate goal of achieving a &quot;life worth living&quot;.

In DBT&#x27;s biosocial theory of BPD, clients have a biological predisposition for emotional dysregulation, and their social environment validates maladaptive behavior.

DBT skills training alone is being used to address treatment goals in some clinical settings, and the broader goal of emotion regulation that is seen in DBT has allowed it to be used in new settings, for example, supporting parenting. There has been little study into adapting DBT into an online environment, but a review indicates that attendance is improved online, with comparable improvements for clients to the traditional mode.

==Four modules==
=== Mindfulness ===
Mindfulness is one of the core ideas behind all elements of DBT. It is considered a foundation for the other skills taught in DBT, because it helps individuals accept and tolerate the powerful emotions they may feel when challenging their habits or exposing themselves to upsetting situations.

The concept of mindfulness and the meditative exercises used to teach it are derived from traditional contemplative religious practice, though the version taught in DBT does not involve any religious or metaphysical concepts. Within DBT it is the capacity to pay attention, nonjudgmentally, to the present moment; about living in the moment, experiencing one&#x27;s emotions and senses fully, yet with perspective. The practice of mindfulness can also be intended to make people more aware of their environments through their five senses: touch, smell, sight, taste, and sound. Mindfulness relies heavily on the principle of acceptance, sometimes referred to as &quot;radical acceptance&quot;. Acceptance skills rely on the patient&#x27;s ability to view situations with no judgment, and to accept situations and their accompanying emotions. This causes less distress overall, which can result in reduced discomfort and symptomology.

==== Acceptance and change ====
The first few sessions of DBT introduce the dialectic of acceptance and change. The patient must first become comfortable with the idea of therapy; once the patient and therapist have established a trusting relationship, DBT techniques can flourish. An essential part of learning acceptance is to first grasp the idea of radical acceptance: radical acceptance embraces the idea of facing situations, both positive and negative, without judgment. Acceptance also incorporates mindfulness and emotional regulation skills, which depend on the idea of radical acceptance. These skills, specifically, are what set DBT apart from other therapies.

Often, after a patient becomes familiar with the idea of acceptance, they will accompany it with change. DBT has five specific states of change which the therapist will review with the patient: pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. Precontemplation is the first stage, in which the patient is completely unaware of their problem. In the second stage, contemplation, the patient realizes the reality of their illness: this is not an action, but a realization. It is not until the third stage, preparation, that the patient is likely to take action, and prepares to move forward. This could be as simple as researching or contacting therapists. Finally, in stage 4, the patient takes action and receives treatment. In the final stage, maintenance, the patient must strengthen their change in order to prevent relapse. After grasping acceptance and change, a patient can fully advance to mindfulness techniques.

There are six mindfulness skills used in DBT to bring the client closer to achieving a &quot;wise mind&quot;, the synthesis of the rational mind and emotion mind: three &quot;what&quot; skills (observe, describe, participate) and three &quot;how&quot; skills (nonjudgementally, one-mindfully, effectively).

===Distress tolerance===

The concept of distress tolerance arose from methods used in person-centered, psychodynamic, psychoanalytic, gestalt, and/or narrative therapies, along with religious and spiritual practices. Distress tolerance means learning to bear emotional discomfort skillfully, without resorting to maladaptive reactions. Healthier coping behaviors are learned, including intentional self-distraction, self-soothing, and &#x27;radical acceptance.&#x27;

Distress tolerance skills are meant to arise naturally as a consequence of mindfulness. They have to do with the ability to accept, in a non-evaluative and nonjudgmental fashion, both oneself and the current situation. It is meant to be a non-judgmental stance, one of neither approval nor resignation. The goal is to become capable of calmly recognizing negative situations and their impact, rather than becoming overwhelmed or hiding from them. This allows individuals to make wise decisions about whether and how to take action, rather than falling into intense, desperate, and often destructive emotional reactions.

===Emotion regulation===

Individuals with borderline personality disorder and suicidal individuals are frequently emotionally intense and labile. They can be angry, intensely frustrated, depressed, or anxious. This suggests that these clients might benefit from help in learning to regulate their emotions. Dialectical behavior therapy skills for emotion regulation include:

*Identify and label emotions
*Identify obstacles to changing emotions
*Reduce vulnerability to &quot;emotion mind&quot;
*Increase positive emotional events
*Increase mindfulness to current emotions
*Take opposite action
*Apply distress tolerance techniques

Emotional regulation skills are based on the theory that intense emotions are a conditioned response to troublesome experiences, the conditioned stimulus, and therefore, are required to alter the patient&#x27;s conditioned response. These skills can be categorized into four modules: understanding and naming emotions, changing unwanted emotions, reducing vulnerability, and managing extreme conditions:

* Learning how to understand and name emotions: the patient focuses on recognizing their feelings. This segment relates directly to mindfulness, which also exposes a patient to their emotions. 
* Changing unwanted emotions: the therapist emphasizes the use of opposite-reactions, fact-checking, and problem solving to regulate emotions. While using opposite-reactions, the patient targets distressing feelings by responding with the opposite emotion. 
* Reducing vulnerability: the patient learns to accumulate positive emotions and to plan coping mechanisms in advance, in order to better handle difficult experiences in the future. 
* Managing extreme conditions: the patient focuses on incorporating their use of mindfulness skills to their current emotions, to remain stable and alert in a crisis.

===Interpersonal effectiveness===
The three interpersonal skills focused on in DBT include self-respect, treating others &quot;with care, interest, validation, and respect&quot;, and assertiveness. The dialectic involved in healthy relationships involves balancing the needs of others with the needs of the self, while maintaining one&#x27;s self-respect.

==Tools==

=== Diary cards ===
Specially formatted diary cards can be used to track relevant emotions and behaviors. Diary cards are most useful when they are filled out daily. The diary card is used to find the treatment priorities that guide the agenda of each therapy session. Both the client and therapist can use the diary card to see what has improved, gotten worse, or stayed the same.

===Chain analysis===
Chain analysis is a form of functional analysis of behavior but with increased focus on sequential events that form the behavior chain. It has strong roots in behavioral psychology in particular applied behavior analysis concept of chaining. A growing body of research supports the use of behavior chain analysis with multiple populations.

==Efficacy==

===Borderline personality disorder===
DBT is the therapy that has been studied the most for treatment of borderline personality disorder, and there have been enough studies done to conclude that DBT is helpful in treating borderline personality disorder. Several studies have found there are neurobiological changes in individuals with BPD after DBT treatment.

===Depression===
A Duke University pilot study compared treatment of depression by antidepressant medication to treatment by antidepressants and dialectical behavior therapy. A total of 34 chronically depressed individuals over age 60 were treated for 28 weeks. Six months after treatment, statistically significant differences were noted in remission rates between groups, with a greater percentage of patients treated with antidepressants and dialectical behavior therapy in remission.

=== Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD)===
Exposure to complex trauma, or the experience of prolonged trauma with little chance of escape, can lead to the development of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) in an individual. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) does not recognize CPTSD as a diagnosis in the DSM-5 (Diagnostical and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the manual used by providers to diagnose, treat and discuss mental illness), though many practitioners argue that CPTSD is separate from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As of 2020, over 40 studies from 15 different countries had &quot;consistently demonstrated the distinction between PTSD and CPTSD&quot; and &quot;replicated the distinct symptoms associated with each disorder&quot; according to a 2021 literature review.

CPTSD is similar to PTSD in that its symptomatology is pervasive and includes cognitive, emotional, and biological domains, among others. CPTSD differs from PTSD in that it is believed to originate in childhood interpersonal trauma, or chronic childhood stress, and that the most common precedents are sexual traumas. Currently, the prevalence rate for CPTSD is an estimated 0.5%, while PTSD&#x27;s is 1.5%. Numerous definitions for CPTSD exist. Different versions are contributed by the World Health Organization (WHO), The International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ISTSS), and individual clinicians and researchers.

Most definitions revolve around criteria for PTSD with the addition of several other domains. While The APA may not recognize CPTSD, the WHO has recognized this syndrome in its 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). The WHO defines CPTSD as a disorder following a single or multiple events which cause the individual to feel stressed or trapped, characterized by low self-esteem, interpersonal deficits, and deficits in affect regulation. These deficits in affect regulation, among other symptoms are a reason why CPTSD is sometimes compared with borderline personality disorder (BPD).

==== Similarities Between CPTSD and borderline personality disorder ====
In addition to affect dysregulation, case studies reveal that patients with CPTSD can also exhibit splitting, mood swings, and fears of abandonment. Like patients with borderline personality disorder, patients with CPTSD were traumatized frequently and/or early in their development and never learned proper coping mechanisms. These individuals may use avoidance, substances, dissociation, and other maladaptive behaviors to cope. Thus, treatment for CPTSD involves stabilizing and teaching successful coping behaviors, affect regulation, and creating and maintaining interpersonal connections. 
In addition to sharing symptom presentations, CPTSD and BPD can share neurophysiological similarities, for example, abnormal volume of the amygdala (emotional memory), hippocampus (memory), anterior cingulate cortex (emotion), and orbital prefrontal cortex (personality). Another shared characteristic between CPTSD and BPD is the possibility for dissociation. Further research is needed to determine the reliability of dissociation as a hallmark of CPTSD, however it is a possible symptom. Because of the two disorders&#x27; shared symptomatology and physiological correlates, psychologists began hypothesizing that a treatment which was effective for one disorder may be effective for the other as well.

==== DBT as a treatment for CPTSD ====
DBT&#x27;s use of acceptance and goal orientation as an approach to behavior change can help to instill empowerment and engage individuals in the therapeutic process. The focus on the future and change can help to prevent the individual from becoming overwhelmed by their history of trauma. This is a risk especially with CPTSD, as multiple traumas are common within this diagnosis. Generally, care providers address a client&#x27;s suicidality before moving on to other aspects of treatment. Because PTSD can make an individual more likely to experience suicidal ideation, DBT can be an option to stabilize suicidality and aid in other treatment modalities.

Some critics argue that while DBT can be used to treat CPTSD, it is not significantly more effective than standard PTSD treatments. Further, this argument posits that DBT decreases self-injurious behaviors (such as cutting or burning) and increases interpersonal functioning but neglects core CPTSD symptoms such as impulsivity, cognitive schemas (repetitive, negative thoughts), and emotions such as guilt and shame. The ISTSS reports that CPTSD requires treatment which differs from typical PTSD treatment, using a multiphase model of recovery, rather than focusing on traumatic memories. The recommended multiphase model consists of establishing safety, distress tolerance, and social relations.

Because DBT has four modules which generally align with these guidelines (Mindfulness, Distress Tolerance, Affect Regulation, Interpersonal Skills) it is a treatment option. Other critiques of DBT discuss the time required for the therapy to be effective. Individuals seeking DBT may not be able to commit to the individual and group sessions required, or their insurance may not cover every session.

A study co-authored by Linehan found that among women receiving outpatient care for BPD and who had attempted suicide in the previous year, 56% additionally met criteria for PTSD. Because of the correlation between borderline personality disorder traits and trauma, some settings began using DBT as a treatment for traumatic symptoms. Some providers opt to combine DBT with other PTSD interventions, such as prolonged exposure therapy (PE) (repeated, detailed description of the trauma in a psychotherapy session) or cognitive processing therapy (CPT) (psychotherapy which addresses cognitive schemas related to traumatic memories).

For example, a regimen which combined PE and DBT would include teaching mindfulness skills and distress tolerance skills, then implementing PE. The individual with the disorder would then be taught acceptance of a trauma&#x27;s occurrence and how it may continue to affect them throughout their lives. Participants in clinical trials of this DBT PE regimen exhibited a decrease in symptoms, and throughout the 12-week trial, no self-injurious or suicidal behaviors were reported. Later trials similarly show increased effectiveness versus DBT.

Another argument which supports the use of DBT as a treatment for trauma hinges upon PTSD symptoms such as emotion regulation and distress. Some PTSD treatments such as exposure therapy may not be suitable for individuals whose distress tolerance and/or emotion regulation is low. Biosocial theory posits that emotion dysregulation is caused by an individual&#x27;s heightened emotional sensitivity combined with environmental factors (such as invalidation of emotions, continued abuse/trauma), and tendency to ruminate (repeatedly think about a negative event and how the outcome could have been changed).

An individual who has these features is likely to use maladaptive coping behaviors. DBT can be appropriate in these cases because it teaches appropriate coping skills and allows the individuals to develop some degree of self-sufficiency. The first three modules of DBT increase distress tolerance and emotion regulation skills in the individual, paving the way for work on symptoms such as intrusions, self-esteem deficiency, and interpersonal relations.

Noteworthy is that DBT has often been modified based on the population being treated. For example, in veteran populations DBT is modified to include exposure exercises and accommodate the presence of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and insurance coverage (i.e. shortening treatment). Populations with comorbid BPD may need to spend longer in the &quot;Establishing Safety&quot; phase. In adolescent populations, the skills training aspect of DBT has elicited significant improvement in emotion regulation and ability to express emotion appropriately. In populations with comorbid substance use, adaptations may be made on a case-by-case basis.

For example, a provider may wish to incorporate elements of motivational interviewing (psychotherapy which uses empowerment to inspire behavior change). The degree of substance use should also be considered. For some individuals, substance use is the only coping behavior they know, and as such the provider may seek to implement skills training before targeting substance reduction. Inversely, a client&#x27;s substance use may be interfering with attendance or other treatment compliance and the provider may choose to address the substance use before implementing DBT for the trauma.

<doc id="445726" wikidata="Q960614" url="?curid=445726" title="Eric Lindros">
<text>Eric Bryan Lindros (; born February 28, 1973) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He played junior hockey in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) for the Oshawa Generals prior to being chosen first overall in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft by the Quebec Nordiques. He refused to play for the Nordiques and was eventually traded to the Philadelphia Flyers in June 1992 in exchange for a package of players and draft picks including Peter Forsberg. During his OHL career, Lindros led the Generals to a Memorial Cup victory in 1990. Prior to being drafted in 1991, Lindros captured the Red Tilson Trophy as the Most Outstanding Player in the OHL, and also was named the CHL Player of the Year.

Lindros began his National Hockey League (NHL) career with the Flyers during the 1992–93 season. He was an exemplary power forward, and averaged more than a point per game. His hard-nosed style caused him to miss significant time with injuries, and he had many problems with concussions. Lindros captured the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league MVP and Lester B. Pearson Award as the most outstanding player after the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season. In August 2001, Lindros joined the New York Rangers via a trade. He then signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs for the 2005–06 season before finishing his career in 2006–07 with the Dallas Stars.

Internationally, Lindros represented Canada at the World Junior Championship three times (1990, 1991 and 1992), winning gold medals in 1990 and 1991. He was Canada&#x27;s all-time points leader at the World Junior Championship with 31 points until surpassed by Connor Bedard in 2023, five points ahead of Jordan Eberle and Brayden Schenn. Lindros has also represented Canada&#x27;s senior team at the World Hockey Championship, leading the squad in scoring at the 1993 tournament. In Olympic play, Lindros represented Canada three times (1992, 1998 and 2002), winning a silver medal in 1992 and gold in 2002. In 2016, Lindros was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame. In 2016 Lindros was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 2017, he was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history. Lindros jersey, #88, was retired by the Flyers in 2018.

==Hockey career==
As a youth, Lindros played in the 1985 and 1987 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Toronto Marlboros and Toronto Young Nationals minor ice hockey teams, respectively.

===Junior career (1989–1992)===
As a teenage power forward playing minor hockey, Lindros became nationally famous both for his scoring feats and his ability to physically dominate players older than himself. He attended Monarch Park and later North Toronto Collegiate in Toronto. Both Eric and his younger brother Brett (Eric in 1988–89) played for the Metro Junior &quot;B&quot; St. Michael&#x27;s Buzzers before moving up to the OHL. Lindros&#x27; play made him the most highly valued amateur player in North America and he was often nicknamed &quot;The Next One&quot;, a reference to Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s moniker &quot;The Great One.&quot;

Throughout his career, Lindros has been tagged with various other nicknames, including &quot;The Big E.&quot; The hype around Lindros during his early career led to an exclusive deal with sports card manufacturer Score. Attempting to leverage this arrangement as much as possible, he was even featured on a baseball card showing him as a third baseman for the Toronto Blue Jays, although the closest he came to a professional baseball career was taking batting practice one day with the Blue Jays.

Lindros refused to sign with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds after being drafted from St. Michael&#x27;s. Greyhounds owner Phil Esposito had drafted him anyway, enabling Esposito to sell his share in the team at a higher price. Lindros was traded to the Oshawa Generals instead.
He played parts of three seasons for the Generals from 1990 to 1992, scoring 97 goals and 119 assists for 216 career points in 95 games.

During the 1990–91 season, Lindros won the Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy as top scorer, the Red Tilson Trophy as MVP, the CHL Player of the Year award and the CHL Top Draft Prospect Award. The Generals returned to the Robertson Cup Final, facing Sault Ste. Marie. The series was one of the more dramatic in OHL history given Lindros&#x27; attitude toward the team, with fans from the Soo loudly booing him every time he touched the puck. The Greyhounds upset the heavily favoured defending champions in a six-game series, winning the last game on home ice.

On March 6, 2008, the Generals retired his jersey number 88, the second number to be retired by the franchise, and it was declared Eric Lindros Day in Oshawa.

===1991 NHL Entry Draft===

Lindros was selected first overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft. Lindros had signaled in advance that he would never play for the Nordiques, citing the ownership. Despite this, the team selected him anyway. Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut publicly announced that they would make Lindros the centrepiece of their franchise turnaround, and refused to trade Lindros, saying that the only way he would play in the NHL would be in a Nordiques uniform. While he awaited a trade, Lindros spent the time playing with the Generals and also participated in the 1992 Winter Olympics, winning a silver medal with Canada.

At the 1992 NHL Entry Draft, the Nordiques worked out trades involving Lindros with both the Philadelphia Flyers and New York Rangers. The Flyers trade had the Nordiques receiving Steve Duchesne, Ron Hextall, Kerry Huffman, Mike Ricci, the rights to Peter Forsberg, the Flyers&#x27; first-round picks in 1992 and 1993, and $15 million. The trade with the Rangers had the Nordiques receiving Tony Amonte, Alexei Kovalev, John Vanbiesbrouck, Doug Weight, three first-round picks (in 1993, 1994 and 1996) and $12 million. Additionally, if Vanbiesbrouck was declared an unrestricted free agent, James Patrick would have replaced him in the deal. The Flyers, believing they had consummated their deal with the Nordiques first, filed a complaint and the NHL announced an independent arbitrator was appointed.

On June 30, 1992, 11 days after the draft, arbitrator Larry Bertuzzi ruled in favor of the Flyers. Bertuzzi determined that the Flyers and Nordiques had agreed to a trade 80 minutes before the Rangers and Nordiques had reached their agreement. Since the Flyers used the 1992 pick to select Ryan Sittler and Quebec had no interest in Sittler, the Flyers and Nordiques had to agree on a substitution for the pick. On July 21, Bertuzzi ruled that Chris Simon and the Flyers&#x27; 1994 first-round pick would be added to the trade.

After Lindros was officially traded to the Flyers, he stated that he had been wary of playing for the Nordiques primarily because of what he called a &quot;lack of winning spirit&quot; in the organization. At the time they picked him, the Nordiques had finished dead last in the league for three years in a row. However, in 2016, he told ESPN that his objection to playing in Quebec was based &quot;solely&quot; on Aubut. While he didn&#x27;t elaborate, he said, &quot;I was not going to play for that individual--period.&quot;

===Philadelphia Flyers===
With his imposing physical strength and playmaking ability, Lindros established himself as the top player on a Flyers team that had perennially been in contention but always fell short. His time in Philadelphia saw him score points (for much of his first five seasons in the NHL, Lindros hovered around fourth all-time in points per game) and become one of the most feared and dominating players in the NHL. In September 1994, Lindros succeeded Kevin Dineen as Flyers captain. Along with John LeClair and Mikael Renberg, he played on the dreaded &quot;Legion of Doom&quot; line. He scored over 40 goals in each of his first two seasons and won the Hart Memorial Trophy as MVP in the lockout-shortened season of 1995 after scoring 29 goals and 41 assists in 46 games and leading the Flyers to their first playoff appearance in six years.

Lindros led the Flyers to the 1997 Stanley Cup Final, handily defeating the Pittsburgh Penguins, Buffalo Sabres and the New York Rangers in five games apiece. In the Finals, however, the Flyers were swept in four games by the Detroit Red Wings; Lindros&#x27; only goal came with 14 seconds left in the third period of Game 4. Detroit Head Coach Scotty Bowman used the finesse-oriented defence pairing of Nicklas Lidström and Larry Murphy against Lindros&#x27; Legion of Doom line instead of sending out—as everyone, including the Flyers, expected—Vladimir Konstantinov to engage in a physical confrontation.

In 1998, Lindros, at just 25 years of age, was ranked number 54th on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players of all time. The only player of comparable age was 37th-ranked Jaromír Jágr, who was 26 at the time.

Lindros&#x27; relationship with Flyers General Manager Bobby Clarke soon deteriorated. He and Clarke feuded in the media, with Clarke questioning his toughness; Lindros spent many games on the injured reserve and suffered a series of concussions, the first in 1998 from a hit delivered by Pittsburgh&#x27;s Darius Kasparaitis that sidelined him for 18 games. Lindros suffered a second concussion in January 1999 that sidelined him for two games. During a game against the Nashville Predators on April 1, 1999, Lindros suffered what was diagnosed as a rib injury. Later that night, the teammate he was sharing a hotel room with, Keith Jones, discovered Lindros lying in a tub, pale and cold. In a call to the Flyers, the trainer was told to put Lindros on a plane that was returning to Philadelphia with injured teammate Mark Recchi. But Jones insisted that Lindros be taken to a nearby hospital and it was discovered Lindros had a collapsed lung caused by internal bleeding of his chest wall. Lindros&#x27; father wrote the Flyers a letter in which he stated that if the trainer had followed team orders, Eric would be dead, a statement supported by the doctors who treated him in Nashville.

The 1999–2000 season was Lindros&#x27; last as a Flyer. Having suffered his second concussion of the season (fourth overall) in March, Lindros criticized the team&#x27;s trainers for failing to diagnose a concussion as he played with symptoms following a hit he suffered in a game against the Boston Bruins two weeks prior. Clarke then stripped Lindros of the captaincy for his actions. Lindros sat out the remainder of the regular season and suffered another concussion while rehabilitating for a return to the lineup. Lindros ultimately returned for Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Final against the New Jersey Devils; he scored the lone goal in a 2–1 Flyers loss. In Game 7 of the series, Lindros was coming over the blue line with his head down, when Devils defenseman Scott Stevens hit Lindros with a shoulder check, knocking him unconscious and suffering yet another concussion. He was able to get off the ice with help from teammates. The Flyers lost Game 7, 2–1 and the series despite leading three games to one, and Lindros became a restricted free agent during the off-season. He refused to accept a two-way qualifying offer with a minor league provision from the Flyers, who still owned his rights. After Lindros was cleared to play in December, the Flyers refused to deal his rights to the Toronto Maple Leafs, as he preferred, and Lindros sat out the entire 2000–01 season.

===New York Rangers===
Bobby Clarke eventually traded Lindros to the New York Rangers on August 20, 2001, in exchange for Jan Hlaváč, Kim Johnsson, Pavel Brendl and a 2003 third-round draft choice (Štefan Ružička). The Rangers would also receive a 2003 first-round draft pick if Lindros were to suffer a concussion in the pre-season or the first 50 games of the regular season, and did not return to action for at least 12 months.

In 2001–02, Lindros averaged a little over a point a game with 37 goals and 36 assists for 73 points in 72 games. His impressive start also led to his seventh and final All-Star selection, but due to an injury he was unable to participate and was replaced by teammate Mike York. Though 2002–03 was the first injury-free season of his career, he struggled to match his previous season, scoring just 53 points in 81 games. In 2003–04, Lindros&#x27;s eighth concussion limited him to just 39 games, though he did collect 32 points. He again became an unrestricted free agent after the season.

===Toronto Maple Leafs===
On August 11, 2005, after the NHL labour dispute had cancelled the 2004–05 season, Lindros signed a one-year, $1.55 million contract with the Maple Leafs for the 2005–06 season. After a steady start to his tenure with Toronto in which he recorded 22 points in 30 games, Lindros suffered a tear of a ligament in his left wrist against the Dallas Stars on December 10, 2005. After a 27-game absence, Lindros returned to the Toronto lineup on February 28, 2006, his 33rd birthday, against the Washington Capitals. His return was brief, however, as he re-injured his wrist while taking a slapshot in a game against the Ottawa Senators on March 4, effectively ending his season. He had surgery on the wrist at the Hand and Upper Limb Centre in London, Ontario, two days after the game.

===Dallas Stars and retirement===
Lindros signed a one-year contract for the 2006–07 season with Dallas on July 17, 2006. He played in 49 regular season games collecting 26 points, and three games in the 2007 playoffs.

Lindros officially announced his retirement on November 8, 2007, in London at the age of 34.

==Post-playing career==
On the day of his retirement, November 8, 2007, it was also announced that Lindros had donated $5 million to the London Health Sciences Centre. This donation supports programs such as the Fowler Kennedy Sport Medicine Clinic, and is one of the largest personal donations by a Canadian sports figure.

On November 11, 2007, three days after his retirement, the National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association (NHLPA) appointed Lindros to the newly created position of NHLPA ombudsman. Lindros had been involved with the organization throughout his career. Lindros cut ties with the NHLPA, however, on February 3, 2009, resigning as ombudsman after 15 months on the job.

On May 9, 2010, Lindros, along with his mother Bonnie, supermodel/actress Monika Schnarre and a few other Canadian notables, helped Habitat for Humanity Toronto by recognizing Mother&#x27;s Day by building homes.

On December 31, 2011, he played in the 2012 NHL Winter Classic Alumni Game between the New York Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers.

In April 2016 Lindros supported Rowan&#x27;s Law. This was concussion-education legislation named in memory of a teen rugby player from Ottawa who died during a game. The legislation was privately sponsored by Nepean-Carleton MPP Lisa MacLeod. Later MacLeod revealed she knew of rumours relating to alleged sexual misconduct by Patrick Brown, then Ontario Progressive Conservative leader. In 2018 she acknowledged her source had been Lindros.

In June 2016, Lindros was announced as one of four appointees to the 2016 Hockey Hall of Fame induction class, joined by the late Pat Quinn, goaltender Rogie Vachon and Russian winger Sergei Makarov.

On January 14, 2017, Lindros reunited with his former &quot;Legion of Doom&quot; linemates John LeClair and Mikael Renberg to play in the 50th Anniversary Alumni game between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Philadelphia Flyers.

In a 2017 interview on French Canadian television, he opened up about his time being drafted by the Nordiques. He later stated that he had no problem with Quebec City or the people, stating that his wife is French Canadian. He stated that the real reason was he did not respect Marcel Aubut and would never play for him. At the end of the interview, he was given the Nordiques igloo and fleur-de-lys jersey at last, 26 years after the saga began.

On January 18, 2018, the Flyers retired Lindros&#x27;s no. 88 jersey in a pre-game ceremony at the Wells Fargo Center.

==Personal life==
The oldest son of Carl Lindros and Bonnie Roszell-Lindros, Lindros has Swedish heritage. The name &quot;Lindros&quot; means &quot;rose of the linden tree.&quot; His great-grandfather Axel immigrated to Canada from Bredaryd, a small village in Sweden, and Eric is the third generation of the Lindros family to be born in Canada. His father Carl Lindros received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Western Ontario (where he played football, well enough to be drafted 30th overall by the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Edmonton Eskimos in the 1970 CFL College Draft), and became a chartered accountant. Lindros&#x27;s mother Bonnie is a registered nurse. Lindros has one brother, Brett, and one sister, Robin.

Lindros&#x27;s younger brother Brett played for the New York Islanders and retired early on May 1, 1996, due to post-concussion syndrome.

The book &quot;Fire on Ice&quot;, co-written by Randy Starkman and published in October 1991 by HarperCollins, chronicled the life and early hockey career of Lindros.

In 2012 Lindros married Kina Lamarche, a native Quebecer and former president of the North American wing of Travelex. They have three children: Carl Pierre, and twins Sophie and Ryan. Lindros and his family currently reside in Toronto. They are close friends with Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, with both families owning a cottage on Lake Rosseau in Muskoka, Ontario.

Lindros was made a Member of the Order of Ontario for the class of 2022.

==Quotes==
===By Lindros===
*&quot;Right now my focus is the &#x27;PA work, I&#x27;m not really concerned about the rest of it. But the last couple of years have been pretty frustrating in terms of not getting through without being injury-free. It&#x27;s just frustrating.&quot;
*&quot;My decision to retire from professional hockey is something that I have been considering for some time and did not come easily. I will miss the day-to-day activity of being a member of a team and the camaraderie that I developed with my teammates will never be forgotten. I played with the best, I played against the best — it was a blast. It really truly was. I enjoyed myself immensely.&quot;

===About Lindros===
*&quot;Eric Lindros was an OHL locomotive — a teenage blend of skill and speed and snarl and size that, until observed in him, had been observed in no one — history called. Context was needed. Tagging him as &quot;The Next One&quot; made sense.
*&quot;He had it all: size, strength and finesse, It is unfortunate injuries cut his time in the NHL short, but he had a great career and left his mark on the game.&quot; —John LeClair.
*&quot;Yes, based on his ability to play the game and based on his contributions as a player, I think you have to separate all the crap that went on. Particularly when he played for the Flyers, it was just outstanding, dominant hockey — the first of the huge, big men with small man&#x27;s skill.&quot; — Bobby Clarke, on whether Lindros should be in the Hockey Hall of Fame.

<doc id="445727" wikidata="Q1047888" url="?curid=445727" title="Spot contract">
<text>In finance, a spot contract, spot transaction, or simply spot, is a contract of buying or selling a commodity, security or currency for immediate settlement (payment and delivery) on the spot date, which is normally two business days after the trade date. The settlement price (or rate) is called spot price (or spot rate). A spot contract is in contrast with a forward contract or futures contract where contract terms are agreed now but delivery and payment will occur at a future date.

== Spot prices and future price expectations ==
Depending on the item being traded, spot prices can indicate market expectations of future price movements in different ways. For a security or non-perishable commodity (e.g. silver), the spot price reflects market expectations of future price movements. In theory, the difference in spot and forward prices should be equal to the finance charges, plus any earnings due to the holder of the security, according to the cost of carry model. For example, on a share the difference in price between the spot and forward is usually accounted for almost entirely by any dividends payable in the period minus the interest payable on the purchase price. Any other cost price would yield an arbitrage opportunity and riskless profit (see rational pricing for the arbitrage mechanics).

In contrast, a perishable or soft commodity does not allow this arbitrage – the cost of storage is effectively higher than the expected future price of the commodity. As a result, spot prices will reflect current supply and demand, not future price movements. Spot prices can therefore be quite volatile and move independently from forward prices. According to the unbiased forward hypothesis, the difference between these prices will equal the expected price change of the commodity over the period.

== Spot date ==
In finance, the spot date of a transaction is the normal settlement day when the transaction is done today. This kind of transaction is referred to as a spot transaction or simply spot.

The spot date may be different for different types of financial transactions. In the foreign exchange market, spot is normally two banking days forward for the currency pair traded. A transaction which has settlement after the spot date is called a forward or a forward contract.

Other settlement dates are also possible. Standard settlement dates are calculated from the spot date. For example, a one-month foreign exchange forward settles one month after the spot date. I.e., if today is 1 February, the spot date is 3 February and the one-month date is 3 March (assuming these dates are all business days). For a trade with two dates, such as a foreign exchange swap, the first date is usually taken as the spot date.

==Examples==

=== Bonds and swaps ===
A spot rate is the interest rate for a specific maturity, which is to be used for discounting the cash flows which occur at that date. 
An alternate statement of this: the rate of effective annual growth that equates the present value with the future value.
The terminology is consistent with the above, in that the spot rate is related to the forward rate analogously.

A spot rate &quot;curve&quot; displays these rates over various maturities. 
Each security class will have its own curve (with the resultant credit spread – e.g. swaps vs government bonds – a function of increased credit risk). 
A &quot;zero rate&quot; curve or zero curve is the term structure of the yields-to-maturity of Zero-coupon bonds and maturities. 

Note that a spot rate curve is &quot;not&quot; a curve of bond ytm or swap rates – which in fact are curves of currently trading &quot;prices&quot; of securities with various maturities (these would be: yield curve, swap curve, cash curve or coupon curve).
Spot rates cannot be directly observed, prices can: 
spot rates are thus estimated from these prices via the bootstrapping method, and the result is the spot rate curve for the securities in question.

=== Currency ===
=== Commodity ===
A simple example: even if you know tomatoes are cheap in July and will be expensive in January, you cannot buy them in July and take delivery in January, since they will spoil before you can take advantage of January&#x27;s high prices. The July price will reflect tomato supply and demand in July. The forward price for January will reflect the market&#x27;s expectations of supply and demand in January. July tomatoes are effectively a different commodity from January tomatoes (contrast contango and backwardation).

Luxembourg climbing specialist Andy Schleck won the stage with a long solo breakaway from the finish and finished the Tour second overall, losing to Australian cyclist Cadel Evans.

<text>The 1867 Canadian federal election was held from August 7 to September 20, 1867, and was the first election of Canada. It was held to elect members representing electoral districts in the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario and Quebec to the House of Commons of the 1st Canadian Parliament. The provinces of Manitoba (1870) and British Columbia (1871) were created during the term of the 1st Parliament of Canada and were not part of this election.

Sir John A. Macdonald had been sworn in as prime minister by the Governor General, Lord Monck, when the new Canadian nation was founded on 1 July 1867. As leader of the Conservative Party of Canada (known as the Liberal-Conservative Party until 1873), he led his party in this election and continued as Prime Minister of Canada when the Conservatives won a majority of the seats in the election, including majorities of the seats (and votes) in the new provinces of Ontario and Quebec.

The Liberal Party of Canada won the second most seats overall, including a majority of the seats (and votes) in the province of New Brunswick. The Liberals did not have a party leader in the election. George Brown, who was the leader of the Liberal Party of Ontario, was considered the &quot;elder statesman&quot; of the national party. Brown ran concurrently for seats in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and the House of Commons of Canada, and might well have been Prime Minister in the unlikely event that the Liberals prevailed over the Conservatives in the national election. Brown failed to win a seat in either body, and the national Liberals remained officially leaderless until 1873.

The Anti-Confederation Party, led by Joseph Howe, won the third most seats overall, based solely on a majority of seats (and votes) in the province of Nova Scotia. Their main desire was the reversal of the decision to join Confederation, which had become highly unpopular in that province. The goals of the Anti-Confederation Members of Parliament (MPs) were openly supported by five of the Liberal MPs of New Brunswick. The Anti-Confederation MPs sat with the Liberal caucus. When the government in Britain refused to allow Nova Scotia to secede, a majority of the Anti-Confederation MPs (11 of 18) moved to the Conservatives.

Halifax was a two-member riding at the time of the election, while the City of Saint John was represented by its own district and the County of Saint John. The election in Kamouraska, Quebec was delayed due to rioting.

== Election ==

The first Canadian election took place without a uniform set of election laws to govern the selection of members to the House of Commons, an interim measure until Parliament could pass its own election laws, which did not come until 1885. Instead, the election was contested under the rules set by each individual province prior to confederation, and future elections would be contested under provincial rules until a time when federal parliament set their own rules. Because of this, voting rights were inconsistent, as was the method of casting a ballot. The BNA Act did stipulate that in the district of Algoma any male British subject of 21 years of age or older, &quot;being a householder,&quot; would have the right to vote.

The election took place over a six-week period from August 7 to September 20, with electoral district polls closing at different dates throughout the period. Under the system each electoral district was required to be polled in one day, but the day did not have to be the same across all electoral districts. The exception to the extended polling period (often called &quot;polling circuits&quot;) being Nova Scotia which abolished the practice of polling different districts on different days after excessive violence was reported in the 1843 election.

=== Franchise ===
The basic general requirement to vote across provinces was the requirement to be a male British subject 21 years of age or older. Voting was conducted in Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia through oral vote which required an eligible elector to declare their choice. New Brunswick had adopted a form of secret ballot in 1855, where electors write the name of a candidate on a piece of paper and deposit the vote in a ballot box.

In all provinces, women and government employees including civil servants, judges, police and prosecutors were not permitted to vote. Indigenous individuals who met property criteria were excluded from voting eligibility in most provinces if they received a benefit paid by the government.

The Ontario elections laws were updated in 1866, with electors required to meet a property qualification of being an owner or tenant with a property value listed on the assessment roll of $600 in a city, $400 in a town, $300 in an incorporated village, and $100 in a township or police village. Furthermore, urban residents must prove an annual income of at least $250. An estimated 16.5 per cent of the population of Ontario was enfranchised for the 1867 election. In Quebec, the property qualification for being an owner was $300 in urban areas and $200 in rural areas, and a tenant required a rent of $30 in an urban area or $20 in a rural area. Nova Scotia&#x27;s election laws were passed in 1863, and had a property qualification for owners or tenants of $150, and enfranchised persons with $300 of personal property. while New Brunswick had a property qualification for owners of $100 and an annual income of $400, but also gave the vote to anyone who owned real or personal property with a total value of $400 or more.

=== Electoral system, Representation by population ===

The number of members in each province in Confederation was set by the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; on the principle of representation by population. The Act provided Quebec a minimum of 65 seats and seat allotment for the remainder of the country was based by dividing the average population of Quebec&#x27;s 65 electoral districts to determine the number of seats for other provinces. The Act also specified that distribution and boundary reviews should occur after each 10 year census.

The BNA Act established that there would be 181 MPs (&quot;subject to provisions of this Act&quot;) - 82 from Ontario, 65 from Quebec, 19 from Nova Scotia, and 15 from New Brunswick. Each would be elected in a single-member district, except there would be two elected in Halifax. Each voter cast one vote, except the Halifax voters who cast up to two votes (Plurality block voting).

== Results ==

The following MPs were acclaimed:
*Ontario: 3 Conservative, 3 Liberal-Conservatives, 9 Liberals
*Quebec: 14 Conservatives, 5 Liberal-Conservatives, 4 Liberals
*New Brunswick: 1 Conservative, 3 Liberals

Vacancy

The election in Kamouraska, Quebec, was cancelled due to rioting at the polling places. No member was elected for the riding until a by-election in 1869.

<doc id="445735" wikidata="Q5326342" url="?curid=445735" title="Earl of Newburgh">
<text>The title Earl of Newburgh (pronounced &quot;&quot;New&quot;-bruh&quot;) was created in the Peerage of Scotland in 1660 for James Livingston, 1st Viscount of Newburgh, along with the subsidiary titles Viscount of Kynnaird and Lord Levingston.

The viscountcy of Newburgh and Livingston baronetcy, which devolved upon the 1st Earl, were created with remainder to heirs male and became extinct on the death of the 2nd Earl (2nd Viscount and 3rd Baronet). However, the Earldom and its subsidiary titles, which were created with remainder to heirs whomsoever, can be inherited through male and female lines, thus passing by marriage through various different families.

The 3rd Countess&#x27;s second husband was the titular 5th Earl of Derwentwater (a younger brother of the attainted 3rd Earl), and so the 4th and 5th Earls of Newburgh were also titular Earls of Derwentwater.

On the death of the 5th Earl (also titular 7th Earl of Derwentwater), the title passed to a descendant of the daughter (and only child) of the 3rd Countess by her first husband, namely the 6th Prince Giustiniani. His daughter, the 7th Countess of Newburgh married the 4th Marquis Bandini and was succeeded, upon her death in 1877, by her son (created Prince Bandini-Giustiniani in 1863) as 8th Duke of Mondragone and 8th Earl of Newburgh. In 1941, upon the death of his son the 9th Earl, the title devolved upon the princely Rospigliosi family.

The 12th and present Earl of Newburgh is usually known in Italy - he lives in Milan - as Prince Rospigliosi, and holds several other titles of nobility: &quot;Duke of Zagarolo&quot;, &quot;Prince of Castiglione&quot;, &quot;Marquis of Giuliana&quot;, &quot;Count of Chiusa&quot; and &quot;Baron of La Miraglia and Valcorrente&quot; (Two Sicilies and Italy), &quot;Lord of Aldone, Burgio, Contessa and Trappeto&quot; (Rome), and &quot;Patrician of Venice, Genoa, Pistoia, Ferrara and Ravenna&quot; (Venice and Genoa). Italian titles are not protected by law since 1948, so these titles are purely nominal.

*Sir John Livingston, 1st Baronet (d. 1628)

<text>Benetton Formula Limited., commonly referred to simply as Benetton, was a Formula One constructor that participated from to . The team was owned by the Benetton family who run a worldwide chain of clothing stores. In 2000, the team was purchased by Renault, but competed as Benetton for the 2000 and 2001 seasons. In , the team became Renault. The Benetton Formula team was chaired by Alessandro Benetton from 1988 to 1998.

==Origins==

The Benetton Group entered Formula One as a sponsor company for constructor Tyrrell in , then Alfa Romeo in and and finally Toleman in 1985. Toleman had struggled in 1985, missing the first three races of the season and being forced to only enter one car for the following six races, as a result of a dispute with tyre suppliers. Teo Fabi had taken a pole position for Toleman at the German Grand Prix, however the team would score no points during the season, with poor reliability causing a Toleman car to see the chequered flag only twice out of 20 total entries. Benetton Formula Limited was formed in 1985 when the Toleman team was sold to the Benetton family.

==Racing history==
===BMW (1986) and Ford (1987-1994) era===
====Beginnings (1986–1987)====

Toleman had already developed the TG186, their planned chassis for the season. This was renamed the Benetton B186 after the change in ownership. Benetton&#x27;s first season in Formula One also came with a change in engine supply, with Toleman&#x27;s Hart engines being replaced with that of a large car manufacturer, the powerful BMW M12. Teo Fabi was retained as a driver and Piercarlo Ghinzani was replaced by Gerhard Berger, who joined from Arrows.

The B186 demonstrated its pace throughout the season, with Berger securing the team&#x27;s first podium finish at Imola and a front-row start in Belgium. Fabi claimed two consecutive pole positions in Austria and Italy, before Berger achieved the Witney-based team&#x27;s first victory in Mexico, almost half a minute ahead of his nearest competitor. Despite the impressive underlying pace, the B186 suffered from severe unreliability. The team recorded nineteen retirements, with eight consecutively for Fabi (including from his two pole positions). Benetton ended the season 6th in the championship with 19 points.

Berger left the team for Ferrari at the end of 1986 and was replaced at Benetton by his former Arrows teammate Thierry Boutsen. BMW, which had supplied three teams in 1986, scaled back its operation to supply only Brabham in . With the Haas Lola team folding at the end of 1986, Benetton was able to take over its factory supply of turbocharged Ford engines. The B187 suffered with engine trouble at the start of the season, but became more consistent mid-season after reducing the effect of the turbocharger, taking numerous 4th and 5th place finishes as well as two 3rd places in Austria and Australia. Benetton ended the season 5th in the championship with 28 points.

====Rise (1988–1990)====

Fabi was dropped for the season in favour of Minardi driver Alessandro Nannini, ending Fabi&#x27;s Formula One career. The B188 became the team&#x27;s first naturally-aspirated car as Ford wished to concentrate development in light of the upcoming ban on turbocharged engines. The B188 was once again an improvement on its predecessor, suffering almost half the number of retirements and claiming seven podium finishes, all 3rd places. Boutsen had finished 3rd in Belgium, however both Benettons were disqualified from the race after the season had concluded for fuel irregularities. The team finished the season 3rd in the championship with 39 points.

For , Boutsen left Benetton to join Williams and was replaced by rookie Johnny Herbert. The new engine developed by Ford for the B189 was not ready for the start of the season, and the previous year&#x27;s engine did not fit in the new car. The team therefore had no choice but to continue using the B188. Despite this setback, the B188 still proved competitive, with Nannini claiming a podium finish at Imola. Prior to making his Formula One debut, Herbert was involved in a serious crash in Formula 3000 that broke both his legs. Despite achieving some impressive results, including 4th place in his first race, he was dropped by the team after failing to qualify for the Canadian Grand Prix as it became clear he had still not fully recovered. He was replaced by rookie and McLaren test driver Emanuele Pirro. The B189 was finally ready to compete at the following race. Nannini would go on to achieve Benetton&#x27;s first victory since 1986 at the Japanese Grand Prix after Ayrton Senna was disqualified. Pirro was only able to secure a single points finish in his ten races with the team, taking 5th place in Australia. Benetton ended the season 4th in the championship with 39 points.

Prior to the season, the team management was fired and businessman Flavio Briatore was appointed team manager by the Benetton family. Pirro was dropped in favour of three-time world champion Nelson Piquet, who had left the struggling Lotus team. Benetton used a modified B189 before introducing the B190 at the third race of the season. 1990 proved to be the team&#x27;s most successful to date, with Piquet winning the final two races of the season and the team achieving six other podium finishes. Tragedy would befall the team late into the season after Nannini lost his right forearm in a helicopter crash. His arm was re-attached but the injuries ended his Formula One career. EuroBrun driver Roberto Moreno had become available after the backmarker team pulled out of the sport, and so he was hired as Nannini&#x27;s replacement. The next race in Japan marked Benetton&#x27;s first ever 1-2 finish, as well as Moreno&#x27;s first and only career podium. Benetton ended the season 3rd in the championship with 71 points.

====First Schumacher years (1991–1993)====

A new title sponsor was acquired for in the form of American cigarette brand Camel, which had previously appeared as a minor sponsor on Benetton cars. The 1991 season was less successful for Benetton. An upgraded B190 was used for the first two races of the season before the B191 made its debut at the San Marino Grand Prix. Piquet achieved an unexpected victory in Canada after Nigel Mansell retired on the final lap, but two other 3rd place finishes were the only podium places the team would achieve in 1991. Benetton sought a young driver for the team&#x27;s future, and believed neither Moreno nor the ageing Piquet could fill this role. After Michael Schumacher had impressed in his debut for Jordan at the Belgian Grand Prix, he was hired by Benetton for the following race in place of Moreno. Jordan protested the move in the British courts, but they found in favour of Benetton. 

For the season, Tom Walkinshaw Racing acquired a stake in Benetton, with Tom Walkinshaw and Ross Brawn brought in to run the team&#x27;s engineering operations. The team also moved its base of operations from Witney, Oxfordshire to a new factory close to the nearby village of Enstone. Piquet had retired from Formula One, and was replaced by experienced Brabham driver Martin Brundle. Benetton&#x27;s new car was once again delayed, with the team using an upgraded B191 for the first three races of the season in which Schumacher achieved two podium finishes. The B192 was a marked improvement, with eleven more podium finishes including a victory at Spa-Francorchamps, the first of Schumacher&#x27;s career. Benetton ended the season 3rd in the championship with 91 points.

Brundle was unexpectedly dropped for in favour of veteran Riccardo Patrese, who had left Williams. The B193 was similar in competitiveness to its predecessor, taking a single victory in the hands of Schumacher at the Portuguese Grand Prix and finishing 3rd in the championship for the fourth time in the team&#x27;s history. Benetton achieved ten other podium finishes during the season. Despite these impressive results and improvements in the team&#x27;s performance in 1992 and 1993, Benetton were not able to provide Schumacher with a car to challenge for the world championship, and were outclassed by the dominant Williams team.

====Championship years (1994–1995)====

Camel was replaced as the team&#x27;s title sponsor for by Japanese cigarette brand Mild Seven. This meant Benetton adopted sky blue as the main car colour. Patrese retired from Formula One, ending what was the longest career in the sport&#x27;s history. He was replaced by Sauber driver JJ Lehto. However, Lehto was injured whilst testing the B194 prior to the start of the season and Benetton&#x27;s test driver Jos Verstappen was brought up to replace him. The B194 was dominant in the hands of Schumacher, winning six of the first seven races including the tragedy-marred 1994 San Marino Grand Prix and taking Benetton&#x27;s first pole positions since 1986. Verstappen and Lehto were less successful. Verstappen retired from his first two races after accidents. Lehto was declared fit for the San Marino Grand Prix, but would only score a single point in the following four races and was replaced again by Verstappen for the French Grand Prix onwards.

Schumacher finished 2nd at the British Grand Prix, but was deemed to have overtaken Damon Hill on the formation lap and then ignored black flags. He was disqualified from the results after the race, and later handed a two-race ban. At the German Grand Prix, Verstappen&#x27;s B194 burst into flames after being showered with fuel during his pit stop. He escaped with minor burns and returned to score two consecutive podiums at the following races, the first of his career. Another disqualification came for Schumacher after he finished 1st at the Belgian Grand Prix; his car was measured as having an illegal amount of wear on its skid block. His two-race ban was served at the following two races, during which Lehto returned to the team as a replacement. In an attempt to win the constructors&#x27; championship, Benetton replaced Verstappen with the more experienced Johnny Herbert for the final two races of the season, marking his return to the team. This was ultimately unsuccessful after Herbert retired from both races. Despite Benetton losing the constructors&#x27; championship to Williams, Schumacher won his first world title after colliding with championship rival Hill at the final race in Australia, taking out both drivers.

====1994 cheating controversy====

During the season, some rival teams claimed Benetton had found a way to violate the FIA-imposed ban on electronic aids, including traction control and launch control. On investigation, the FIA discovered &quot;start sequence&quot; (launch control) software in the Benetton B194 cars, and a variety of illegal software in rival teams&#x27; cars as well. FIA had no evidence the software was ever used, so teams found with the software received little to no punishment. No traction control software was found to be in the Benetton cars, however. 
Flavio Briatore, Benetton&#x27;s chief in 1994, said in 2001 that &quot;Our only mistake was that at the time we were too young and people were suspicious&quot;.
===Renault works era (1995-1997)===
After eight years of Ford power, Benetton switched to full-works Renault V10 engines for and thus Ford switched allegiances to then-youngest Formula One constructor Sauber. Herbert was retained alongside Schumacher, whilst test driver Verstappen was loaned to the struggling Simtek team. Schumacher was initially critical of the new B195, claiming that it was difficult to control. The car was outclassed by the Williams FW17 in the early season, with the team&#x27;s poor performance culminating in Schumacher crashing out from pole position at Imola. However, setup changes at the following race in Spain improved Schumacher&#x27;s performance in the car. He went on to dominate the remainder of the season, taking nine wins from seventeen races in total and claiming his second world title. Herbert took his first career podium in Spain and then went on to win the British and Italian Grands Prix. This combined effort won Benetton its first constructors&#x27; championship, ending Williams&#x27; three-year reign. Herbert later claimed the team failed to provide him with equal equipment and accused them of favouring Schumacher.

====Decline (1996–1999)====

Benetton began racing under Italian nationality for the season, but remained based in the United Kingdom. Despite being contracted to race for Benetton, Schumacher left early to join Ferrari, citing the team&#x27;s actions in 1994 as his reason for opting out. Herbert was dropped by the team and joined Sauber. Their replacements were Jean Alesi and the returning Gerhard Berger, both of whom had left Ferrari. Williams returned to dominance in 1996 and Schumacher&#x27;s departure allowed Ferrari to compete for race wins, leaving Benetton struggling. The B196 took ten podium finishes, but the team failed to win a race for the first time since 1988. Alesi and Berger were on course to win the Monaco and German Grands Prix respectively, but both retired late in the closing laps. Benetton finished the season 3rd in the championship with 68 points, less than half as many as in 1995.

By , technical director Ross Brawn and chief designer Rory Byrne, as well as numerous other staff, had left Benetton to join Schumacher at Ferrari. Composites manager, Philip Henderson, who had been with the team since the start also left to help Dan Gurney with his Indy Car team in California. The B197, like its predecessor, struggled to compete with Williams and Ferrari. However, the team still achieved a number of podium finishes over the season. Berger was forced to miss three races due to illness and the death of his father; his replacement was rookie test driver Alexander Wurz. Wurz scored a podium in Britain, only his third race in Formula One. Berger returned for the German Grand Prix, winning the race from pole position in dominant fashion. However, this would turn out to be Benetton&#x27;s last victory in Formula One, as well as the 10th and final career win for Gerhard Berger. Alesi took pole position in Italy but lost out due to a slow pit stop, finishing 2nd. Benetton ended the season 3rd in the championship with 67 points.

===Mecachrome-assembled Supertec era (1998-2000)===
 saw numerous changes within the Benetton team. Berger retired from Formula One, and Alesi left to join Sauber. Test driver Wurz was promoted to a full-time seat, partnering Giancarlo Fisichella who left Jordan. Renault pulled out of Formula One, leaving Benetton and Williams with a supply of Renault&#x27;s 1997 engines developed by Mecachrome. Benetton re-branded these engines as Playlife, a sportswear brand owned by the Benetton family. Chief executive Flavio Briatore was removed and replaced by former World Rally Champion and Prodrive boss David Richards. Fisichella achieved some success with the B198, achieving two consecutive 2nd places in Monaco and Canada as well as pole position in Austria. However, Benetton became uncompetitive towards the end of the season, scoring just a single point in the final seven races. The team partly blamed tyre supplier Bridgestone, claiming that they had favoured the more successful McLaren team. Benetton finished the season 5th in the championship with 33 points.

Chief executive Richards left Benetton after just a year in his post and was replaced by Rocco Benetton for , due to a disagreement with the Benetton family about future strategy. The Renault engines were now developed by Flavio Briatore&#x27;s Supertec company, but continued to be labelled Playlife. The B199 was a disappointment and demonstrated the further decline of the team. The highlight of the season was Fisichella&#x27;s 2nd place in Canada, however this only came after numerous retirements from other cars. The following ten races only saw a single points finish for Benetton; Wurz&#x27;s 5th place in Austria. Benetton ended the season 6th in the championship with 16 points, their worst ever finish.

===Renault ownership (2000–2001)===
After Williams switched to works BMW engines, Benetton officially strengthened its partnership with Supertec. Prior to the start of the season, the team was sold to Renault as the manufacturer sought a return to Formula One, however the team would retain the Benetton name. As part of their restructuring, Renault brought back Flavio Briatore as team manager. The B200 was an improvement on its predecessor, claiming three podium finishes, including 2nd place in Brazil after David Coulthard was disqualified. All three of these podiums were scored by Fisichella; Wurz struggled with the car and only claimed a single points finish with 5th place in Italy. Benetton ended the season 4th in the championship with 20 points.

The Renault name returned to Formula One in as Benetton received a supply of full-works Renault engines. Wurz&#x27;s struggles in 2000 saw him replaced with a young Jenson Button, who had been dropped by Williams. Despite these changes, Benetton suffered a dismal start to 2001 with the B201 often barely qualifying in the top 20. Only a single point was salvaged in the first eleven races, when Fisichella finished 6th in Brazil after twelve other cars failed to finish. The team&#x27;s fortunes began to change at the German Grand Prix, when Fisichella and Button finishing 4th and 5th respectively. Continued chassis development allowed Benetton to leave Formula One on something of a high, and the cars&#x27; performance lifted. Button and Fisichella scored 10 points for the team, including an impressive podium finish for Fisichella in Belgium.

==Legacy==

2001 was the final season featuring the Benetton name, as the team was fully re-branded as the Renault F1 Team for the season. The Renault F1 Team would go on to win the drivers&#x27; and constructors&#x27; championships in both and with Fernando Alonso. The team was sold off and became Lotus F1 Team in . Renault re-purchased the team and was rebranded it Renault Sport Formula One Team in , then becoming Alpine in 2021. The team continues to operate from the site at Enstone established by Benetton in 1992.

The Benetton team is today best known for its success with Michael Schumacher, who accounts for 19 of the team&#x27;s 27 race victories and their two World Drivers&#x27; Championships.

==Nationality==

Benetton Team had a British licence from to and an Italian licence from to , thus becoming only the second constructor (after Shadow in ) to officially change its nationality. The Benetton family wanted this change of nationality to have their Formula One team flying the flag of their own country. At the 1997 German Grand Prix Benetton became the only constructor to have won races under more than one nationality. The team was based in the UK throughout, initially at the former Toleman factory in Witney, Oxfordshire, before moving to a new, modern, bigger factory at Enstone in .

<text>Donald Earle Messick (September 7, 1926 – October 24, 1997) was an American voice actor, known for his performances in Hanna-Barbera cartoons.

His best-remembered voice roles include Scooby-Doo; Bamm-Bamm Rubble and Hoppy in &quot;The Flintstones&quot;; Astro in &quot;The Jetsons&quot;; Muttley in &quot;Wacky Races&quot; and &quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot;; Boo-Boo Bear and Ranger Smith in &quot;The Yogi Bear Show&quot;; Sebastian the Cat in &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;; Gears, Ratchet, and Scavenger in &quot;The Transformers&quot;; Papa Smurf and Azrael in &quot;The Smurfs&quot;; Hamton J. Pig in &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;; and Dr. Benton Quest in &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;.

==Early life==
Messick was born on September 7, 1926, in Buffalo, New York, the son of Binford Earl Messick, a house painter, and Lena Birch ( Hughes). He had one brother, F. Thomas Messick. He was raised in the Bolton Hill neighborhood of Baltimore, where he received his early training as a performer at the Ramsay Street School of Acting.

==Career==

===Early work===
At first, Messick wanted to be a ventriloquist and even supported himself as one for a time in the late 1940s and early 1950s. At the age of 15, Messick performed in front of the program manager and chief announcer at radio station WBOC in Salisbury, Maryland, and was given his own weekly show, for which Messick performed all of the character voices and sound effects.

Messick moved back to Baltimore a year later, after graduating high school, and approached radio station WCAO about getting his one-man show on the air. As Messick worked to reduce the Baltimore accent identified by the manager of WCAO as an impediment to his radio career, Messick&#x27;s father was killed, along with two other men, in an accident at the Nanticoke School. Two other workers and he were taking down a flagpole when it came into contact with electric power lines, electrocuting all three men.

In 1944, Messick joined the US Army, performing for troops as a part of the Special Services for 20 months. Messick&#x27;s first big break came when he was hired by the Mutual Broadcasting radio station in Los Angeles, where he played Raggedy Andy and Farmer Seedling on the radio series &quot;The Raggedy Ann Show&quot;.

At MGM, Tex Avery was producing the &quot;Droopy&quot; cartoons. When regular voice actor Bill Thompson was unavailable, Avery hired Messick at veteran MGM voice actor Daws Butler&#x27;s recommendation.

===Early Hanna Barbera voice work===
When William Hanna and Joseph Barbera formed their own animation studio, Hanna-Barbera, in 1957, Messick and Butler became a voice-acting team for the company. Messick and Butler&#x27;s first collaboration was &quot;Ruff and Reddy&quot;. Messick was Ruff the cat and the Droopy-sounding Professor Gizmo, while Butler played the dog, Reddy. Messick also narrated the show, which had a serialized storyline. From 1958 to 1959, Messick played Tadpole in the animated television series, &quot;Spunky and Tadpole,&quot; produced by Beverly Hills Productions.

From 1957 to 1965, Butler and Messick gave voice to a large number of characters. Almost always the sidekick or supporting foil, Messick&#x27;s characters were not usually headliners. His notable roles in this era were Boo Boo Bear, Ranger Smith, Major Minor, Pixie Mouse, Astro on &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, and Dr. Benton Quest (replacing John Stephenson) on &quot;The Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot;. On &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, in addition to many episodic characters and creatures, he voiced Bamm-Bamm Rubble, Hoppy the hopparoo, and Arnold the paper boy. 

He was used primarily for his narration skills, which were heard on many of those cartoons in which Daws Butler starred. In narrating &quot;The Huckleberry Hound Show&quot; and as Ranger Smith in the Yogi Bear segments, he used something close to his natural voice.

Messick was eventually featured as Ricochet Rabbit in &quot;Ricochet Rabbit&quot; (1964–65), while Deputy Droop-a-Long was voiced by Mel Blanc. He did the voices of the title character in &quot;Precious Pupp&quot; and Shag Rugg from &quot;Hillbilly Bears&quot;, both of which were segments from &quot;The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show&quot;. In 1966, Messick took over the roles of Atom Ant and Mr. Peebles on &quot;The Magilla Gorilla Show&quot; from Howard Morris, who had left Hanna-Barbera.

In outer-space and superhero cartoons, Don Messick created noises and sounds for weird space creatures and aliens. His Ranger Smith voice was often heard as various villains. His narrator voice was given to Vapor Man on &quot;The Galaxy Trio&quot;, Dr. Benton Quest, the Perilous Paper Doll Man, and Multi Man on &quot;The Impossibles&quot;.

===&quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; and later roles===
In 1969, he was cast as the cowardly canine title character on &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;. He voiced him through all of the various versions of &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;: on television in numerous formats from 1969 until his retirement, including television films, and a number of commercials, as well. In 1970, he voiced Sebastian on &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot;, and reprised the role in its spin-off &quot;Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space&quot; two years later, as well as voicing the new alien character, Bleep. From 1980 to 1988, he voiced Scooby&#x27;s nephew, Scrappy-Doo, having taken over the role originated by Lennie Weinrib in 1979; he continued to voice Scooby-Doo when &quot;A Pup Named Scooby-Doo&quot; came along from 1988 to 1991.

In &quot;Hong Kong Phooey&quot;, he was the voice of Spot the Cat, a faithful sidekick that was the one who foiled the villain&#x27;s plans, though he let the clueless title character take the glory. In 1977, he voiced Balin and a few incidental characters in the first animated adaptation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien.

By the 1970s, the popularity of &quot;Yogi Bear&quot; led to several spin-off TV series and television movies featuring the character. Messick reprised his roles of Boo-Boo and Ranger Smith from the 1970s until 1994 on &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Gang&quot;, &quot;Laff-a-Lympics&quot;, &quot;Yogi&#x27;s Treasure Hunt&quot;, and &quot;The New Yogi Bear Show&quot;.

He played Papa Smurf on &quot;The Smurfs&quot; from 1981 to 1989 and Ratchet (the Autobot doctor), Gears, and Constructicon Scavenger on &quot;The Transformers&quot;. In 1985, new episodes of &quot;The Jetsons&quot; were produced and Messick returned as Astro, RUDI, Mac, and Uniblab, a pesky robot that worked for Mr. Spacely.

He also starred in the Masters of the Universe Golden Book video as He-Man. In 1985, he voiced Louie and Snichey in &quot;The Pound Puppies&quot; TV special, in 1988, he had an uncredited role as the Pimp of the Year pageant announcer on &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Git You Sucka&quot;, and he returned to his role of Benton Quest on &quot;The New Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot; (1986–1987).

Messick also played a live-action role on the MTM Enterprises sitcom &quot;Duck Factory&quot;, playing a cartoon voice actor named Wally Wooster. In one episode, frequent collaborator Frank Welker guest-starred as a rival voice artist angling for his job. Don Messick said of his character on the show: &quot;Wally was never quite sure whether he was Wally or Dippy Duck&quot;.

From 1990 to 1995, he voiced Hamton J. Pig in Amblin&#x27;s &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; and its spin-offs. Around that time, he also returned as the voice of Droopy for &quot;Tom &amp; Jerry Kids&quot; and &quot;Droopy, Master Detective&quot;. On the 1995 &quot;Freakazoid!&quot; episode &quot;Toby Danger in Doomsday Bet&quot;, a spoof of &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;, he played Dr. Vernon Danger, a parody of Benton Quest.

At a charity speaking engagement in London, shortly before his death, he performed many of his characters, except Scooby-Doo. He claimed that giving up smoking had robbed him of the rasp in the voice that he needed to voice him.

===Retirement===
In late September 1996, Messick retired from acting after he suffered a stroke at a recording session at Hanna-Barbera.

On October 12, 1996, he had a &quot;retirement party&quot; at his favorite Chinese restaurant (Joseph Barbera personally sent a limo to Messick and his wife, and the two were chauffeured). Many of his friends and peers during his career who had come to pay tribute to him included Henry Corden, Casey Kasem, Lucille Bliss, Maurice LaMarche, Gregg Berger, Neil Ross, June Foray, Sharon Mack, Greg Burson, Walker Edmiston, Marvin Kaplan, Gary Owens, Howard Morris, Teresa Ganzel, Jean Vander Pyl, and Myrtis Martin Butler (Daws&#x27; widow).

==Personal life and death==
Messick married Helen McHugh on October 10, 1953, and they remained married until Messick&#x27;s death on October 24, 1997. Together, they had one child.

Messick suffered a second stroke and died on October 24, 1997, in Salinas, California. He was 71 years old.

==Legacy==
Since Messick&#x27;s death in 1997, Hadley Kay, Scott Innes, Neil Fanning, and Frank Welker have all voiced the role of Scooby-Doo. In 1998, &quot;Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island&quot; was dedicated to his memory. In 2011, Jonathan Winters (who voiced Grandpa Smurf in the television series) became Messick&#x27;s successor as the voice of Papa Smurf in &quot;The Smurfs&quot; and its 2013 sequel. Winters died after finishing his voice work on the latter film. In 2000, Billy West also became one of Messick&#x27;s successors as the new voice of Muttley in the 2000 Dreamcast video game, the 2017 reboot of Wacky Races, and in the Scooby-Doo! animated film &quot;Scoob!&quot; which featured archive recordings of Messick for Muttley&#x27;s laugh and a place named after him called &quot;Messick Mountain&quot;.

<text>A child process in computing is a process created by another process (the parent process). This technique pertains to multitasking operating systems, and is sometimes called a subprocess or traditionally a subtask.

There are two major procedures for creating a child process: the fork system call (preferred in Unix-like systems and the POSIX standard) and the spawn (preferred in the modern (NT) kernel of Microsoft Windows, as well as in some historical operating systems).

== History ==
Child processes date to the late 1960s, with an early form in later revisions of the Multiprogramming with a Fixed number of Tasks Version II (MFT-II) form of the IBM OS/360 operating system, which introduced &quot;sub-tasking&quot; (see task). The current form in Unix draws on Multics (1969), while the Windows NT form draws on OpenVMS (1978), from RSX-11 (1972).

==Children created by fork==
A child process inherits most of its attributes, such as file descriptors, from its parent. In Unix, a child process is typically created as a copy of the parent, using the fork system call. The child process can then overlay itself with a different program (using ) as required.

Each process may create many child processes but will have at most one parent process; if a process does not have a parent this usually indicates that it was created directly by the kernel. In some systems, including Linux-based systems, the very first process (called init) is started by the kernel at booting time and never terminates (see Linux startup process); other parentless processes may be launched to carry out various daemon tasks in userspace. Another way for a process to end up without a parent is if its parent dies, leaving an orphan process; but in this case it will shortly be adopted by &quot;init&quot;.

The SIGCHLD signal is sent to the parent of a child process when it exits, is interrupted, or resumes after being interrupted. By default the signal is simply ignored.

==Children created by spawn==

==End of life==
When a child process terminates, some information is returned to the parent process.

When a child process terminates before the parent has called wait, the kernel retains some information about the process, such as its exit status, to enable its parent to call &quot;wait&quot; later. Because the child is still consuming system resources but not executing it is known as a zombie process. The &quot;wait&quot; system call is commonly invoked in the SIGCHLD handler.

POSIX.1-2001 allows a parent process to elect for the kernel to automatically reap child processes that terminate by explicitly setting the disposition of SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN (although ignore is the default, automatic reaping only occurs if the disposition is set to ignore explicitly), or by setting the SA_NOCLDWAIT flag for the SIGCHLD signal. Linux 2.6 kernels adhere to this behavior, and FreeBSD supports both of these methods since version 5.0. However, because of historical differences between System V and BSD behaviors with regard to ignoring SIGCHLD, calling &quot;wait&quot; remains the most portable paradigm for cleaning up after forked child processes.

* pstree, for UNIX to find the child process (&quot;pstree PID&quot;, where PID is the process id of the process).

<text>In computing, a parent process is a process that has created one or more child processes.

== Unix-like systems ==
In Unix-like operating systems, every process except (the swapper) is created when another process executes the fork() system call. The process that invoked fork is the &quot;parent process&quot; and the newly created process is the &quot;child process&quot;. Every process (except process 0) has one parent process, but can have many child processes.

The operating system kernel identifies each process by its process identifier. is a special process that is created when the system boots; after forking a child process becomes the swapper process (sometimes also known as the &quot;idle task&quot;). , known as , is the ancestor of every other process in the system.

=== Linux ===
In the Linux kernel, in which there is a very slim difference between processes and POSIX threads, there are two kinds of parent processes, namely real parent and parent. Parent is the process that receives the &quot;SIGCHLD&quot; signal on child&#x27;s termination, whereas real parent is the thread that actually created this child process in a multithreaded environment. For a normal process, both these two values are same, but for a POSIX thread which acts as a process, these two values may be different.

== Zombie processes ==

The operating system maintains a table that associates every process, by means of its process identifier (generally referred to as &quot;pid&quot;) to the data necessary for its functioning. During a process&#x27;s lifetime, such data might include memory segments designated to the process, the arguments it&#x27;s been invoked with, environment variables, counters about resource usage, user-id, group-id and group set, and maybe other types of information.

When a process terminates its execution, either by calling &quot;exit&quot; (even if implicitly, by executing a return command from the &quot;main&quot; function) or by receiving a signal that causes it to terminate abruptly, the operating system releases most of the resources and information related to that process, but still keeps the data about resource utilization and the termination status code, because a parent process might be interested in knowing if that child executed successfully (by using standard functions to decode the termination status code) and the amount of system resources it consumed during its execution.

By default, the system assumes that the parent process is indeed interested in such information at the time of the child&#x27;s termination, and thus sends the parent the signal &quot;SIGCHLD&quot; to alert that there is some data about a child to be collected. Such collection is done by calling a function of the &quot;wait&quot; family (either &quot;wait&quot; itself or one of its relatives, such as &quot;waitpid&quot;, &quot;waitid&quot; or &quot;wait4&quot;). As soon as this collection is made, the system releases those last bits of information about the child process and removes its pid from the process table. However, if the parent process lingers in collecting the child&#x27;s data (or fails to do it at all), the system has no option but keep the child&#x27;s pid and termination data in the process table indefinitely.

Such a terminated process whose data has not been collected is called a &quot;zombie process&quot;, or simply a &quot;zombie&quot;, in the UNIX parlance. The name is a humorous analogy due to considering terminated process as &quot;no longer alive&quot; or &quot;dead&quot;—since it has really ceased functioning—and a lingering dead process still &quot;incarnated&quot; in the &quot;world of the living&quot; processes—the process table—which is therefore actually &quot;undead&quot;, or &quot;zombie&quot;.

Zombie processes might pose problems on systems with limited resources or that have limited-size process tables, as the creation of new, active processes might be prevented by the lack of resources still used by long lasting zombies.

It is, therefore, a good programming practice in any program that might spawn child processes to have code to prevent the formation of long lasting zombies from its original children. The most obvious approach is to have code that calls &quot;wait&quot; or one of its relatives somewhere after having created a new process. If the program is expected to create many child processes that may execute asynchronously and terminate in an unpredictable order, it is generally good to create a handler for the &quot;SIGCHLD&quot; signal, calling one of the &quot;wait&quot;-family function in a loop, until no uncollected child data remains. It is possible for the parent process to completely ignore the termination of its children and still not create zombies, but this requires the explicit definition of a handler for &quot;SIGCHLD&quot; through a call to &quot;sigaction&quot; with the special option flag &quot;SA_NOCLDWAIT&quot;.

== Orphan processes ==

Orphan processes are an opposite situation to zombie processes, referring to the case in which a parent process terminates before its child processes, which are said to become &quot;orphaned&quot;. Unlike the asynchronous child-to-parent notification that happens when a child process terminates (via the signal), child processes are not notified immediately when their parent finishes. Instead, the system simply redefines the &quot;parent PID&quot; field in the child process&#x27;s data to be the process that is the &quot;ancestor&quot; of every other process in the system, whose PID generally has the value of 1 (one), and whose name is traditionally &quot;init&quot; (except in the Linux kernel 3.4 and above [more info below]). Thus, it was said that init &quot;adopts&quot; every orphan process on the system.

A somewhat common assumption by programmers new to UNIX was that the child processes of a terminating process will be adopted by this process&#x27;s immediate parent process (hence those child processes&#x27; &quot;grandparent&quot;). Such assumption was incorrect unless, of course, that &quot;grandparent&quot; was the init itself.

After Linux kernel 3.4 this is no longer true, in fact processes can issue the prctl() system call with the PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER option, and as a result they, not process #1, will become the parent of any of their orphaned descendant processes. This is the way of working of modern service managers and daemon supervision utilities including systemd, upstart, and the nosh service manager.

This is an abstract of the manual page, reporting that:

A subreaper fulfills the role of init(1) for its descendant processes. When a process becomes orphaned (i.e., its immediate parent terminates) then that process will be reparented to the nearest still living ancestor subreaper. Subsequently, calls to getppid() in the orphaned process will now return the PID of the subreaper process, and when the orphan terminates, it is the subreaper process that will
 receive a SIGCHLD signal and will be able to wait(2) on the process to discover its termination status.

<text>Joseph &quot;Yossi&quot; Beilin (, born 12 June 1948) is an Israeli politician who has served in multiple ministerial and leadership positions in the Israeli government. Much of his political career was in the Labour Party. He also served as chairman of the Meretz-Yachad political party. After retiring from political life, Beilin founded &#x27;Beilink&#x27;, a business consultancy company. He also writes opinion pieces in Israeli papers &quot;Haaretz&quot; and &quot;Israel Hayom&quot;.

Beilin was a significant figure in the 1990s Israeli–Palestinian peace process. Then serving as Deputy Foreign Minister, he participated in the back-channel negotiations that eventually led to the adoption of the 1993 Oslo Accords, a framework agreement to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

==Biography==
Beilin was raised in Tel Aviv in a liberal household. At the age of bar mitzvah, he adopted a more rigorously religious life, though did not choose to wear a yarmulke (traditional Jewish cap). He studied in Herzliya Gymnasium school. In the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), he served in the signal corps and participated in the Six-Day War (1967) in Sinai in Division 8. In the Yom Kippur War (1973) he served in the army headquarters. The trauma of the war shook his faith and he stopped living a religious lifestyle.

===Public life===
In 1969 Beilin began his career as a journalist for the newspaper &quot;Davar&quot; and in 1977 entered the political arena as a spokesperson for the Labour Party. Following the 1984 election of Prime Minister Shimon Peres, he served as Cabinet Secretary and in 1986 became director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

During this period he worked to distance Israel from the apartheid regime in South Africa. In 1988 Beilin was elected to the Knesset by the Labour Party. He was appointed Deputy Minister of Finance, a position he held until the dissolution of the National Unity Government in 1990.

While in the Labour Party, Beilin, along with Yair Hirschfeld and Ron Pundak established the Economic Cooperation Foundation (ECF).

Since 2018, Beilin is the Chairman of Hillel Student Organization in Israel.

===Oslo Agreement, Geneva Initiative===
In 1992, after the victory of the Labour Party, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs under Shimon Peres. Secretly, without informing his superiors, Beilin began the Oslo Process, a critical agreement reached between Israel and the Palestinians that led to the establishment of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza.

In 1995, under the Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin administration, he was appointed Minister of Economy and Planning. During this period he formulated with Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), the &quot;Beilin–Abu Mazen understandings&quot; as a possible basis for a final settlement between Israel and a Palestinian state. These agreements were never signed, but formed the basis of other initiatives. After the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, Beilin served in the government of Shimon Peres as Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office.

At that time Beilin was also interested in strengthening Israel&#x27;s relations with world Jewry and American Jews in particular. He initiated the process that led to the establishment of the Birthright Program in 1999.

In 1997 he was second in line after Ehud Barak as contender for head of the Labour party and as candidate for Prime Minister. From 1999 to 2001, under Prime Minister Barak, he served as Minister of Justice. He also served for a short time as Minister of Religious Affairs. In a usual move for Israeli politicians, he resigned his Knesset seat when he became a minister in 1999.

In 2003 Beilin, along with MK Yael Dayan, left the Labour Party due to its decision to join Prime Minister Sharon&#x27;s coalition and joined the Meretz Party, which he headed from 2004–2008. From 2006 to 2008, he represented Meretz in the Knesset. In 2008 he retired from political life.

In 2001 he participated in the Israeli–Palestinian Taba Talks in Egypt. As Beilin left government, he initiated the informal negotiation on a very detailed peace agreement model, with Palestinian minister Yasser Abed Rabbo and others.

In 2003, after a lengthy process, he signed the Geneva Accords, creating a possible structure of a permanent agreement between Israel and an independent Palestinian state. In an interview Prime Minister Ariel Sharon gave to the &quot;New York Times&quot; on April 14, 2004, Sharon said that one of the reasons for his unexpected decision to withdraw from Gaza was his attempt to prevent the implementation of the Geneva Initiative.&quot;

With the outbreak of the Second Lebanon War (2006), Beilin expressed support for the war. However, he objected to the introduction of ground forces, instead believing that Israel should attack military targets in Syria because it arms Hezbollah.

On October 28, 2008, prior to the eighteenth elections, Beilin announced his retirement from political life. On November 3, the Knesset held a farewell meeting for Beilin with, at the time Israeli President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Benjamin Netanyahu spoke as head of the opposition and Ehud Barak as head of the Labour Party.

He issued a condolence message on the death of Yasser Arafat, as well as proposals to transfer the ownership of the Shebah Farms to Lebanon and pardon Marwan Barghouti.

==Views==
He is agnostic but finds being Jewish central to his identity. He is a social liberal.

In an op-ed published in &quot;New York Times&quot; in May 2015, he called for the establishment of a joint Israeli-Palestinian confederation, without any &quot;artificial partition&quot;. Israel and Palestine would be two independent states as part of this confederation, each with its own parliament and government, but will also have joint institutions that will deal with common issues such as water, infrastructure, environment, government and emergency services.

Beilin is a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reformation of the United Nations.

In 2016, Beilin made headlines by criticizing the legacy of Benjamin Ben-Eliezer shortly after his death, calling him &quot;an aggressive, destructive politician&quot;.

==Academic degrees and activity==
Beilin has a Ph.D. from the University of Tel Aviv, where he also taught courses in Political Science for 13 years, and has published numerous books dealing with the peace process and Israeli politics and policy.
Beilin was a visiting Professor in NYU during the Spring Semester 2020.

==Business activity==
Beilin is currently the Founder and President of Beilink, a business consulting firm that help clients connect to new markets both in Israel and abroad, make strategic investments and decisions, forge strong international relationships with key stakeholders, navigate the spectrum between the political and private spheres, locate investors, and ultimately expand and strengthen businesses.

==Honours==
In November 2009 he was appointed Légion d&#x27;honneur by the French ambassador to Israel. In the same year he received the journalistic prize &quot;Golden Doves for Peace&quot; issued by the Italian Research Institute Archivio Disarmo.

<doc id="445756" wikidata="Q278743" url="?curid=445756" title="Novogrudok">
<text>Novogrudok or Navahrudak (; ; , ; ) is a town in Grodno Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Novogrudok District. As of 2024, it has a population of 27,936.

In the Middle Ages, the city was ruled by King Mindaugas&#x27; son Vaišvilkas.

During and after Mindaugas&#x27; rule, Novogrudok was part of the Kingdom of Lithuania, and later the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which was later part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the 14th century, it was an episcopal see of the Metropolitanate of Lithuania.

From 1795 to 1915, the Russian Empire ruled over the lands, with brief periods of intercession, e.g. Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;Grande Armée&quot; in 1812 and the Uprisings of 1831 and 1863. After 1915, Novogrudok was occupied by the Imperial German Army for three years in World War I, by the Second Polish Republic until the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. Thereafter, the Soviet Union annexed the area to the Byelorussian SSR. From 1941 to 1944, Novogrudok was occupied by the German Army, thereafter returning to the Soviet Union until 1991.

==Toponymy==
The name comes from the Old East Slavic words &quot;New town&quot;. It was a large settlement in the remote Western lands of the Krivichs, which came under the control of the Ancient Rus&#x27; state at the end of the 10th century. The ancient name of Novgorodok (Nov&#x27;gorodok, Nov&#x27;gorodok&#x27;, though leaning both parts: to Novagorodka, in Novegorodtsy, &quot;between Novym&#x27;gorodkom&#x27;&quot;, from &quot;Novagorodka&quot; in &quot;Novegorodche&quot;). In some sources, it is called &quot;Maly Novgorod&quot;.

Archaeological excavations made by Gurevich F. D. in different places of the city, gave a huge number of interesting finds (Byzantine glass, jewellery, and even the ruins of a house with painted walls from the inside, which had suspended lanterns in which oil was lit) this, as well as the conclusion of the archaeologist that the city appeared on this site no later than the 9th century, allows Novogrudok to claim the role of historical chronicle Novgorod. In favour of this version of localization is the fact that in the earliest annals of Novgorod called &quot;Novgorodou&quot;, and [ou] in the end later added the letter &quot;k&quot; turned [ouk], so the chronicle &quot;Novgorodou&quot; transformed into &quot;Novgorodouk&quot; and was later simplified to &quot;Novogrudok&quot;.

Locals use the older name &quot;Navаgradak&quot;, especially the older people. The place of stress is recorded in the publication of the &quot;Tribunal for the inhabitants of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania&#x27;&quot; (Vilna, 1586), where it is marked in print &quot;in Novа́gorodku&quot;.

At the time of entry into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the traditional Belarusian pronunciation &quot;Navа́gradak&quot;, transformed into the modern name Novogrudok, from Polish &quot;Nowogródek&quot;.

Some historians believe that the chronicle versions of the name of the city – &quot;Novogorod&quot;, &quot;Novgorodok&quot;, &quot;Novy Gorodok&quot;, &quot;Novogorodok-Litovsky&quot;, etc. indicate that, perhaps, there was an old city center of the district – Radogoshcha.

==History==
===Early history===
Novogrudok was established in Baltic Yotvingian lands. Eastern Slavs, specifically Dregoviches and Volhynians, were the first settlers who established Novogrudok at the end of the 10th century. According to archaeological research conducted in Novogrudok in the 1960s, the settlements arose on modern Novogrudok&#x27;s territory at the end of the 10th century, and the fortifications by the mid-11th century. Research also suggests that a city already existed on-site in the 9th–10th centuries, which had trade links with Byzantium, the Near East, Western Europe and Scandinavia. These trade links were related to the Amber Road. Archaeologically, Novogrudok was studied in the years 1957-1977. In the first half of the 11th century, the city consisted of two undefended settlements located on the &quot;Small castle&quot; and &quot;Castle hill&quot;. In the second half of the 11th century, fortifications were built around the settlement on the &quot;Castle hill&quot;, thus forming the Novogrudok detinets. On the Small Castle to the West of the detinets formed a settlement, which in the 12th century was also fortified and turned into a roundabout city.

On the territory of the detinets, wooden ground buildings with wood burning stoves made out of adobe and plank floors were studied. The most important activities of the city&#x27;s population were crafts and trade. Often, there is evidence of local jewelry craft – there were foundries and jewelry workshops that formed a whole block on the &quot;small castle&quot;. Bone-cutting, wood and stone processing were also common. Graffiti with old Russian letters was found on fragments of frescoed plaster from building No.12 (&quot;house of the boyar&quot; or &quot;powalush&quot;) of the 12th century on the Small Castle (an ancient roundabout city). Trade relations in the 12th–13th centuries were far-reaching, as evidenced by many imports: from Kyiv came glass bracelets, non-ferrous metal jewellery, engolpions, icons, spindle whorls, faience vessels from Iran, glassware from Byzantium and Syria, from the Baltic – amber.

Novogrudok was first mentioned in the Sofia First Chronicle and Novgorod Fourth Chronicle in 1044 in reference to a war between Yaroslav I and Lithuanian tribes. It was also mentioned in the Hypatian Codex in 1252 as &quot;Novogorodok&quot;, meaning &quot;new little town&quot;. Novogrudok was a major settlement in the remote western lands of the Krivichs that came under Kievan Rus&#x27; control at the end of the 10th century. However, this hypothesis has been disputed as the earliest archaeological findings date from the 11th century.

=== Grand Duchy of Lithuania ===

==== 13th century ====
In the 13th century, the Kievan Rus disintegrated due to Asian nomadic incursions, which climaxed with the Mongol horde&#x27;s Siege of Kiev (1240), resulting in the sack of Kiev and leaving a regional geopolitical vacuum in which the East Slavs splintered along pre-existing tribal lines and formed several independent, competing principalities. It is known that even prior to Mindaugas&#x27; arrival, there was a Catholic church in Novogrudok.
Maciej Stryjkowski, asserts that Ringold&#x27;s father, Algimunt, ruled in Novogrudok over all Rus&#x27; and Lithuania, starting from Vilija River up to Starodub, Chernigov, Turau and Karachaev, as well as all of Podlasie with its adjacent castles, Brest, Mielnik, Drohiczyn, etc., holding them in peaceful tenure. 

Mindaugas son Vaišvilkas ruled Novogrudok. Novogrudok was one of Mindaugas&#x27; residences. Some identify Novogrudok as Lithuania&#x27;s first capital, later the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, however, this is refuted by the fact that Voruta is the only contemporary mention of a possible early Lithuanian capital ruled by Mindaugas. Voruta&#x27;s most likely location has been identified as Šeimyniškėliai mound. The Great Russian Encyclopedia states that Mindaugas&#x27; state had no permanent capitals, but his early residence was Black Rus&#x27;, whose center was Novogrudok. Encyclopædia Britannica mentions only the following Lithuanian capitals: Kernavė, Trakai and Vilnius, excluding Novogrudok from the list.

During the 16th century, three centuries after the events, Maciej Stryjkowski was the first, in his chronicle, to propose the theory that Novogrudok was the capital of the 13th-century state. Vaišvilkas, the son and successor of Mindaugas, took monastic vows in Lavrashev Monastery near Novgorodok and founded an Orthodox convent there. The enmity between Mindaugas and his relatives, who were refuged in Volhynia, led to a great war with the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, which made several major campaigns against the city. These campaigns forced Mindaugas to ally with the Livonian Order. In 1253, Mindaugas was crowned king of Lithuania on behalf of the Pope. Vaišvilkas made peace on behalf of his father with the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia and handed over Novogrudok and all Lithuanian cities to Roman Danylovich. After breaking the peace in 1258, Vaišvilkas again became a duke in Novogrudok, and then passed it along with the entire country to Shvarn. The Golden Horde Tatars repeatedly attacked Novogrudok in 1255, 1274, and finally in 1279.

==== 14th century ====
In 1314, the castle was besieged by the Teutonic Order. It was again attacked by the Teutons in 1321, 1341, 1390 and finally in 1394.

As the centre of the appanage Principality, Novogrudok was owned from 1329 by Prince Karijotas, and then by his son Fyodor from 1358, and from 1386 by Kaributas. At that time, Novogrudok was part of the Trakai Voivodeship, whose population was entirely ethnically Lithuanian, hence Novogrudok was part of Lithuania Proper.

Since 1392, Novogrudok was one of the centres of the Grand Ducal demesne of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, where the stone Novogrudok Castle was built. The Novogrudok Castle&#x27;s firmness allowed the existence of a Castellan and a Koniuszy.

==== 15th century ====
At the end of the 14th and start of the 15th century, Vytautas settled the Lipka Tatars in Novogrudok and its surroundings. In 1428, he recorded the city along with the surrounding villages in the lifetime possession of his wife Uliana. In 1415, at the Council of Orthodox bishops in Novogrudok, Gregory Tsamblak was elected Metropolitan of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Synod de facto declared autocephaly of the Orthodox Church in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and also reformed internal administration in the Church. In 1422, Vytautas the Great founded the Roman Catholic Transfiguration Church in Novogrudok, in which the wedding of the king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Jogaila with Sophia of Halshany took place. This marriage gave rise to the Jagiellonian dynasty. Their son Casimir IV Jagiellon granted town rights in 1444. After the Union of Krewo (1385), it was part of the Polish–Lithuanian Union, which became the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth after the Union of Lublin in 1569.

==== 16th century ====
In 1505, the Tatars tried to capture the city, but failed. Novogrudok was designated as the capital of the Nowogródek Voivodeship from 1507 until the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. On 26 July 1511, the town was granted Magdeburg rights by King Sigismund I the Old, which were reconfirmed in 1562, 1595 and 1776. It was a royal city. In 1568, there were 10 churches in the city. From 1581 to 1775, the city hosted some of the Lithuanian Tribunal&#x27;s sessions. On 18 March 1595, King Sigismund III Vasa granted the city a coat of arms depicting Saint Michael the Archangel. After the Union of Brest of 1595-1596, the Department of the Orthodox Metropolitanate became a Uniate one. In 1597, Sigismund III Vasa gave the townspeople of Novogrudok the privilege of 2 fairs a year for 2 weeks on the Catholic holidays Epiphany and Pentecost. In the 16th century, Novogrudok was also one of the Reformation&#x27;s centers.

==== 17th century ====
In September 1655, it was captured by Prince A. Trubetskoy&#x27;s soldiers in the war between the Tsardom of Russia and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1661, the city was recaptured by the Polish-Lithuanian army, and was exempt from paying taxes for a period of 4 years.

In the 16th–18th centuries, Novogrudok suffered numerous fires (1578, 1599, 1613, 1652, the most severe – in 1751, when 167 houses, 4 churches, the town hall and the Governor&#x27;s office burned down) and epidemics (1590, 1592, 1603, 1708). In addition, military events and cataclysms of the 17th–18th centuries caused the city&#x27;s decline.

==== 18th century ====
During the Great Northern War in 1706, the city was occupied by Swedish Army, and later by Muscovite troops, who burned the city and blew up the castle. On 1 May 1751, there was great destruction due to a fire. On 23 September 1784, the king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Stanisław August Poniatowski arrived in the city. On his way back from Nyasvizh, he visited the city, the Novogrudok Castle&#x27;s ruins, the tribunal and the city archive. The 6th Lithuanian Infantry Regiment was stationed in the town in 1790. During the War in Defense of the Constitution, in early June 1792, Novogrudok was attacked by the 33,000-strong Tsarist army led by Mikhail Krechetnikov. In mid-June 1792, after the defeat in the battle of Mir, Lithuanian troops under Duke Louis of Württemberg&#x27;s command retreated through Novogrudok to Grodno. Tatars from General Józef Bielak&#x27;s Corps were among the last to leave the city. Earlier, they heroically defended the crossing of the Neman river against the Russian soldiers in the Battle of Stolbtsy. At the 18th century&#x27;s end, there were 6 monasteries, 5 Catholic churches, 3 Orthodox churches, a synagogue, and a Tatar mosque in Novogrudok.

===In the 19th century===

In 1795, as a result of the third Partition of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, it was annexed by Imperial Russia. Administratively, it was part of the Slonim Governorate since 1796, and the Lithuania Governorate since 1801. It was transferred to the Minsk Governorate in 1843. The city is one of two possible birthplaces of the world-renowned poet Adam Mickiewicz. Mickiewicz was baptized in the local Transfiguration Church and spent his childhood in the city.

During the Napoleonic Wars, the Polish 20th Infantry Regiment and 19th Uhlan Regiment were formed from local residents after Novogrudok&#x27;s occupation by Napoleon&#x27;s &quot;Grande Armée&quot; in 1812. In 1817, the city had 428 wooden and 9 stone houses. At that time, mainly Jews, Belarusians, Poles, Lipka Tatars and Russians lived in the city.

==== November Uprising of 1831 ====
During the November Uprising, on 22 July 1831, Novogrudok was occupied for some time by the detachments of Y. Kashits and M. Mezheyevsky.

After the liquidation of the Dominican school in 1834, the tsarist authorities opened a five-class school, which turned into the Novogrudok gymnasium in 1858. In 1837, Novogrudok had 4 unpaved and 9 paved streets and alleys.

==== January Uprising of 1863 and subsequent repressions ====
During the January Uprising, an insurgent organization led by V. Borzobogaty was formed in the city. In 1863, priest Felician Lashkevich from Novogrudok partook in this uprising. As part of anti-Catholic repression following the January Uprising, the tsarist administration closed down the gymnasium as well as Catholic churches, which were transformed into Orthodox churches.

In 1896, Rabbi Yosef Yozel Horwitz founded one of the most famous Jewish higher educational religious institutions in Novogrudok, the Novardok Yeshiva, which was one of the largest and most important yeshivas in pre-war Europe and a powerful force in the Musar movement.

=== In the 20th century ===
In 1905, the first gas street lamps appeared in Novogrudok. In 1910, there were 76 stone and 1074 wooden buildings in the city, and in 1914 there were 6 educational institutions in the city. In 1907-1909, a provincial branch of the Polish society &quot;Enlightenment&quot; worked in the city, which supported Polish education. It had a thriving Jewish community. In 1900, its population was 5,015.

==== World War I and Polish–Soviet War ====
During the First World War, the city was under German occupation from 22 September 1915 to 27 December 1918. On 22 September 1915, Novogrudok was occupied by the German 10th Army. The Russian-German front was now only 20 km East of the city, along the Servechi river. The Germans built a power plant, a network of narrow-gauge railways, and telephone lines. The creation of polish and belarusian schools was also allowed in the city.

Mickiewicz&#x27;s house was occupied by General of Infantry Reinhard von Scheffer-Boyadel, the XVII Reserve Corps&#x27; commander. Due to the front&#x27;s proximity, Marshal Paul von Hindenburg came to Novogrudok. During German rule, on 25 March 1918, Novogrudok was declared part of the Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic. On 27 December 1918, the German army&#x27;s cavalry left Novogrudok. In the evening, the Bolsheviks entered the city, greeted with an ovation by the Jewish and Russian population. Soon, some Polish activists were arrested, and in March 1919, the Bolsheviks executed some of them in the castle ruins.

On 1 January 1919, following the resolution and Congress of the CP(b) of Belarus, it became a part of the Belarusian SSR. On 25 May 1919, the Novogrudok Belarusian gymnasium was opened here.During the Polish–Soviet War, Novogrudok changed hands several times. From mid-March 1919, Polish Army detachments began to appear in Novogrudok&#x27;s vicinity. On 8 April 1919, at dawn, after several hours of fighting, soldiers of the of Major and two squadrons of the 10th Lithuanian Uhlan Regiment captured the city. Many Communist Poles from the Western Rifle Division fought in the battles on the Red Army&#x27;s side. With the city&#x27;s capture, the Polish Army received large warehouses of military weaponry and ammunition, while also capturing about 300 prisoners of war. The Polish-Bolshevik front stopped for several months along the line of former German trenches on the rivers Servech and Uschi.
On the morning of 19 July 1920, the Red Army again occupied Novogrudok. After crushing defeats in the Battle of Warsaw and later of the Niemen River, on 1 October 1920, Polish troops again occupied the city. These were detachments of the 1st and 5th Legions&#x27; Infantry Regiments, the 16th Infantry Regiment, and 3 batteries of the 1st Legionary Artillery Regiment. Most of them belonged to the 1st Legions Infantry Division.

==== In Second Polish Republic ====
Ultimately captured by the Poles in October 1920, it was confirmed as part of the Second Polish Republic by the Peace of Riga. The civil authorities, headed by the headman Joseph Yellin, began to act on 3 November. The traditions of the Lithuanian Tribunal were partially revived by the Novogrudok Voivodeship court, which opened on 11 January 1921, in the building of the former Russian County school.During the interwar period, Novogrudok served as the seat of the Novogrudok Voivodeship until the 1939 invasion of Poland by Germany and the Soviet Union. Many new buildings were built, including the voivodeship office, district court, tax office, theatre, power plant, city bath and a narrow-gauge railway station. In 1938, a museum was created in the former home of Adam Mickiewicz. The first voivode of Novogrudok (1921-1924) was Władysław Raczkiewicz, later (1939-1947) President of Poland in exile. On 13 May 1922, Adam Mickiewicz&#x27;s eldest son, Wladyslaw, came to Novogrudok to stay, and on 30 October 1922, the chief of state, Marshal Józef Piłsudski, came here. In the following years, the former power station was converted into a city theatre. Several other Polish presidents visited the city: Stanisław Wojciechowski (25-27 May 1924) and Ignacy Mościcki (September 1929 and the end of June 1931). In the 1920s and 1930s, more than 10 titles of periodicals were published in the city. In October 1922, the first Belarusian-language newspaper &quot;Nasha Batskayshchyna&quot; was published in Novogrudok. In 1924-1931, a mound was built on the small castle in honour of Adam Mickiewicz, and a Museum was opened in his honour on 11 September 1938. As of 1931, there were 1055 residential buildings in the city, 2 catholic churches, 2 orthodox churches, 3 synagogues, and a mosque; in addition to the Belarusian one, there was a polish gymnasium. In addition, there were 2 hospitals, 7 hotels, and 2 printing houses.

====World War II====

===== Soviet occupation =====
At the beginning of World War II, after 17 September 1939, Soviet Air Forces&#x27; bombers began dropping leaflets written in broken Polish over the city, announcing the imminent liberation &quot;from the yoke of the lords&quot; and other oppressors. On 18 September 1939 Novogrudok was occupied by the Red Army and, on 14 November 1939, incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. Many residents of the city and region were repressed and exiled to other regions of the USSR, and the region was subjected to severe Sovietization. In the administrative division of the new territories, the city was briefly the centre of Navahrudak Region until it moved to Baranavichy, and region itself was renamed to Baranavichy Region and to the Novogrudok Raion (15 January 1940).

===== German occupation =====

On 22 June 1941, the city was subjected to German bombing, the former Starostvo, formerly the Radziwill Palace, and shopping malls were destroyed as Germany invaded the Soviet Union. On 4 July, Novogrudok was occupied by the Wehrmacht. Then, the Red Army was surrounded in the Novogrudok Cauldron. Nevertheless, during the German occupation, there was active resistance to the Nazis.

In mid-December 1943, the Polish resistance separated the Novogrudok district of the Home Army from the Bialystok district. The headquarters of the Home Army&#x27;s district was in Lida. The Nazis killed more than 10,000 Jews in the Novogrudok Ghetto, Novogrudok and nearby villages during the Holocaust. However, in mid-may 1943, the last remaining ghetto prisoners began to dig a underground passage outside the ghetto, and five months later, on 26 September 1943, an escape was made through it. A total of 232 people escaped through the tunnel. Some of the fleeing Jews joined the Bielski partisans, which actively fought against the Nazis in the region.
During the German occupation, the city served as the administrative centre of &quot;Kreisgebiet Nowogrodek&quot; within the &quot;Generalbezirk Weißruthenien&quot; of &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland&quot;. The local population was subjected to deportations for forced labour to Germany and executions. In February–March 1944, by order of the &quot;Gebietskommissar&quot; (Area Commissioner) of the Novogrudok district, SS-&quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Wilhelm Traub, former Lieutenant of the Polish army Barys Rahula formed the Belarusian Novogrudok mounted squadron to fight the partisans. In February 1944, the 65th Belarusian Schutzmannschaft Battalion was formed in Novogrudok. However, in early July 1944, Barys Rahula curtailed the activities of the squadron.

During the German occupation in Novogrudok, the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth organized, at the request of the parents of Polish children, underground teaching in the Polish language and history. On 1 August 1943, the underground school ceased to exist after 11 nuns, the Martyrs of Nowogródek, including the main organizer of the school, were shot by the German occupiers on 1 August 1943.

===== Soviet reoccupation =====
In the summer of 1944, units of the Home Army&#x27;s Novogrudok partisan district partook in Operation Ostra Brama, fighting alongside the Red Army to occupy Vilnius. On 8 July 1944, the Red Army reoccupied Novogrudok after almost three years of German occupation. However, after retaking Western Belorussia from the Germans, the recent allies became enemies. Thus, on 21 August 1944, in the village of Surkontakh, the commander of the Home Army&#x27;s Novogrudok partisan district, Lieutenant Colonel Maciej Kalenkiewicz, nicknamed &quot;Kotvich&quot; (1906-1944) from the Khubala detachment, was killed in a battle with tenfold superior units of the NKVD. During the war, more than 45,000 people were killed in the city and the surrounding area, and over 60% of housing was destroyed.

After the war, on this region did the organization &quot;the black cat&quot;, which was aimed at the struggle against the Soviet regime, so in March 1948, the United group of troops of the organization &quot;the black cat&quot; with several units &quot;bulbivtsiv&quot; (total 200 men) attacked the Novogrudok to release the arrested members of his organization. The city was the base of the MGB&#x27;s Special Department, which fought against anti-Soviet partisans. The anti-Soviet partisan movement continued until the early 1960s until it completely ceased to exist.

After the war, the area remained part of the Byelorussian SSR, and most of the destroyed infrastructure was rapidly rebuilt. On 8 July 1954, following the disestablishment of the Baranavichy Region, the &quot;raion&quot;, along with Novogrudok, became part of the Grodno Region, where it still is, now in Belarus.

==== Cup of St. Jadwiga ====
During the archaeological excavations at the Small Castle in Novogrudok in the period from 1955 to 1962, conducted by the Leningrad Department of the Institute of Archaeology of the USSR Academy of Sciences, an artefact was found, called &quot;glass carved glass&quot;, belonging to a group of glass carved glasses, known in medieval studies under the General name &quot;Hedwig glass&quot;. The &quot;Cup of Saint Jadwiga&quot; found in Novogrudok (under this name the vessel is listed in the collection of the Hermitage Museum, this Cup was not returned to Belarus, despite requests from the Belarusian side), carved images of a lion, a Griffin and a stylized tree of life in the form of two snakes entwining the Cup of life. According to the British Museum, the vessels of this group are among the first hundred outstanding works of the material culture of universal civilization. All currently known cups of the &quot;Hedwig glass&quot; series, both preserved intact and individual fragments of these cups, were stored for many centuries exclusively in the capital cities of States that were either part of the medieval state of the Holy Roman Empire, or in the capitals of dynasties that had a kinship with the dynasties that ruled these States.

===Recent history===

In 1997, Novogrudok and Novogrudoky district were merged into a single administrative unit. The city has links with the twin cities of Elbląg, Krynica Morska and Leymen.

On 10 September 2011, in honour of the 500th anniversary of the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Magdeburg law (freed from feudal duties, the power of voivodes, gave the right to create a magistrate-a self-government body, its seal and coat of arms – the image of the Archangel Michael) in the centre of the city as a memory of the history and former greatness of the ancient city, a memorial sign was installed.

According to the state program &quot;Castles of Belarus&quot;, in 2012-15, it was planned to preserve the ruins of the Novogrudok castle with the restoration of its compositional structure and historical development, adaptation to modern social and cultural needs.

It was concluded that it is impractical to restore buildings that store artefacts from the 13th to 16th centuries. The concept of &quot;solid ruins&quot; was approved, developed and reviewed at the Republican scientific and methodological meeting, the purpose of which was to reveal all seven towers of the Navahrudak castle, as well as the spinning walls. Thus the castle will be designated in the size of the 16th century.

The metal structure and the brick prigruz will preserve the ruins of the &quot;Kostelnaya tower&quot;, stabilize it and complete the object&#x27;s conservation. Eventually, when scientists are convinced that the stabilization was successful, the prigruz will be removed.

It will also partially restored the losses incurred by tower &quot;Shitovka&quot;. The tower will be covered with a roof, but will remain incomplete. It is planned to open a Museum, the Foundation of which will consist of exhibits that are now stored in the Novogrudok Museum of local history.

The Church of the 13th century, the remains of which are now underground, will be shown with an application. At the level of about 50 centimetres, the masonry of the Palace will be opened. It is not planned to lower the entire porch. The ramparts that were around the perimeter will also be partially open. No buildings will be built on the porch itself.

It is also planned to make a horizontal drainage to organize water drainage and stop the erosion of the soil of the southern slope.

According to the resolution of the Council of Ministers of 3 June 2016 No. 437, Novogrudok castle was included in the list of 27 objects whose conservation costs (in terms of capital expenditures) can be financed from the national budget.

=== Jewish history ===
Novogrudok had been an important Jewish centre. It was home to the Novardok yeshiva, founded by Rabbi Yosef Yozel Horwitz in 1896. It was the hometown of Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein and the Harkavy Jewish family, including Yiddish lexicographer Alexander Harkavy. Before the war, the population was 20,000, approximately half of whom were Jews. Meyer Meyerovitz and Meyer Abovitz were then the rabbis there. During a series of &quot;actions&quot; in 1941, the Germans killed all but 550 of the approximately 10,000 Jews. (The first mass murder of Novogrudok&#x27;s Jews occurred in December 1941.) Those not killed were sent into slave labour.

==Cultivable species==
Currently, the only cultivated species of the genus &quot;Cicer&quot; is &quot;C. arietinum&quot;, commonly known as the chickpea.

The wild progenitor of &quot;C. arietinum&quot; is &quot;Cicer reticulatum&quot;. Since the chickpea has descended from this wild plant, there is a possibility that this wild progenitor can offer other forms of edible chickpeas after domestication. In wild chickpea (&quot;C. reticulatum&quot;), a considerable proportion of the mature pods remain intact, and this characteristic leads to the species being described as pre-adapted to domestication. This essentially means that the function of one of its traits can change, or evolve, as the progenitor is domesticated. This implies that traits such as texture, size, and most importantly, nutritional content can be adjusted in this species. Domesticated chickpea is considered vernalization insensitive (it can flower at all times of the year), whereas wild &quot;C. reticulatum&quot; shows a considerable flowering advance (of up to 30 days) in response to vernalization—which means that the plant would have to grow in areas where it is exposed to a prolonged period of cold before it can properly grow.

Although there is promise for some kind of domestication process to allow for and create new sources of food through &quot;C. reticulatum&quot;, there are several issues that make domestication of this wild species quite difficult. The first of these problems is that &quot;C. reticulatum&quot; may offer only limited adaptive allelic variation for improving the chickpea crop. Also, the narrow range of the &quot;C. reticulatum&quot; suggests that the prospects for improving the adaptive range of domesticated chickpea are quite limited. The patchy distribution of the wild plant, the small number of seeds produced per plant, and the relatively low allelic variation within populations (of the wild progenitor) makes germplasm conservation ( conservation of seeds or tissues, otherwise known as the living genetic resources of plants) a bit difficult.

When tried in the past, chickpea breeding has faced problems because of the lack of genetic diversity. This has caused limitations in efforts to improve resistance to diseases such as Ascochyta blight and Fusarium wilt. There have also been problems such as insects susceptible to breaking through the chickpea pods and limitations in increasing tolerance to abiotic stresses such as terminal drought and extreme temperatures. To fix these limitations, the introduction of alleles controlling the traits of interest from wild germplasm is essential in order to increase the genetic diversity of cultivated chickpeas. Currently, the chickpea&#x27;s immediate ancestor, &quot;C. reticulatum&quot;, and its interfertile sister species &quot;Cicer echinospermum&quot;, are the main sources of new variation. Introgression is still possible from the more distantly related gene pools, but more research has to be done on this possibility. But the narrow variation of the wild progenitor (&quot;C. reticulatum&quot;) of the chickpea and the limited number of &quot;C. reticulatum&quot; accessions have caused a need to look for desired alleles in other more distantly related &quot;Cicer&quot; species 

==Resistances of various &quot;Cicer&quot; perennials and potential for plant improvement==
&quot;Cicer&quot; perennials harbor great resistances in particular environments in comparison to the resistances of other herbaceous species. Although some &quot;Cicer&quot; perennials are difficult to harvest, there have been studies to improve the germination of particular species. Various studies highlight the specific resistances and improvements in fitness of particular &quot;Cicer&quot; perennial species. For example, one way in which &quot;Cicer canariense&quot;, a perennial species, was able to improve its fitness is by the help of scientific experimentation.

&quot;Cicer canariense&quot;, a perennial species, has a lowered field emergence due to a hard seed coats. However, various methods such as chemical scarification with concentrated sulphuric acid as well as hot water treatment can be used to improve germination. In one particular study, physical dormancy was overcome most effectively by mechanical scarification and sulphur immersion. More studies regarding crop development could introduce this species as a potential food source.

Another perennial species, &quot;Cicer anatolicum&quot;, resists chickpea ascochyta blight superior to the cultivated chickpea. Access to this resistance is barred due to hybridization barriers. A detailed study on endogenous hormones showed that interspecific hybrid production could occur if hormone profiles between the cultivated chickpea and the perennial are synchronized. Further experimentation on hormone profiles could open up hybridization barriers between the modern chickpea and &quot;Cicer anatolicum&quot;. Another barricade that could be overcome is the inability to cultivate specific &quot;Cicer&quot; perennials in different parts of the world.

Many &quot;Cicer&quot; perennials and annual plants grow in different environments. So far, none of the perennial &quot;Cicer&quot; species have been grown successfully in a tropical or subtropical setting in which annual &quot;Cicer&quot; species grow. If the pollen of perennial species can be preserved for use in the different parts of the world in which annual species grow, then crossability techniques can be performed more effectively. This difficulty in use of the perennial germplasm can be resolved by transshipping viable pollen across the ocean. If this issue were to be resolved, more &quot;Cicer&quot; perennials could be planted in various portions of the world.

Another constraint that affects the &quot;Cicer&quot; species is the bollworm &quot;Helicoverpa armigera&quot;, which is one of the biggest problems for their survival. Host plant resistance is an effective method to resolve these pests. A study found that perennials such as &quot;C. canariense&quot; and &quot;C. microphyllum&quot; have high resistance to &quot;H. armigera&quot; compared to &quot;C. judaicum&quot;, an annual plant. More experimentation on cross-breeding could give clues on the genetic origin of the proteins responsible for this resistance. Drought resistance is another opposition to overcome for many &quot;Cicer&quot; perennials.

About 90% of chickpea (&quot;Cicer arietinum&quot;) in the world is grown with very little rainfall and where drought is a significant constraint to growth. A study assessed the resistance of drought of many perennials compared to annuals. When tested, the perennial wild &quot;Cicer&quot; species recovered after wilting and drying out and also tolerated high temperatures. Of all the perennials tested crossbreeding with &quot;Cicer anatolicum&quot; should be tested because of its close genetic affinities to the annual species.

These resistances and improvements in the &quot;Cicer&quot; perennial genome can be a potential reservoir of knowledge for the exploration of the genes that contribute to the perennials&#x27; traits. Drought and pest resistance along with scientific improvements in crop development play a huge role in the evolution of many &quot;Cicer&quot; perennials. Further studies of genetic exchange and crossbreeding between &quot;Cicer&quot; perennials could potentially benefit the traits of contemporary food-bearing crops and provide extensive knowledge for innovation.

==Evolution==
The genus, &quot;Cicer&quot;, is composed of many species with different characteristics that make it an interesting candidate for a food crop. Currently, only one species of &quot;Cicer&quot;, the modern chickpea, is domesticated as a cultivar, but there are many other options researchers are considering for further domestication and expansion into perennial crops. One of the most promising options that could lead to the expansion into perennial crops is hybridization between annual and perennial species. However, hybridization is only possible and/or successful between certain species, which have not been determined.

The first step in this expansion is to examine the relationships between perennial and annual species of &quot;Cicer&quot; both morphologically and genetically to identify possible candidate species. Unfortunately, research shows stark morphological differences between perennial and annual species of &quot;Cicer&quot; which hints at difficulty that could result from attempting to cross these species into a hybridized species. More specifically, a study examining the seed coat morphology at several specific gene loci compared annual and perennial species that showed very distinct differences between the two branches of &quot;Cicer&quot;. The research was able to create phylogenetic trees tracking the genetic divergence of &quot;Cicer&quot; species, and the data indicate &quot;the rapid species differentiation of &quot;Monocicer&quot; including adaptation to the disturbed environment,&quot; showing much distance between annual species (&quot;Monocicer&quot;) and perennial species of &quot;Cicer&quot;.

Further research into these relationships has been performed to analyze the relatedness of perennial and annual species, both cultivated and wild, at 12 loci to see how closely they are related. The researchers were able to narrow down one perennial species, &quot;C. incisum&quot;, that was more closely related to annual plants than other perennial species. Research also showed similar results upon genetic and phylogenetic analyses. While most annual and perennial species tend to form monophyletic clades, &quot;C. incisum&quot; is an exception to this rule. Another species that occurs outside of the typical monophylies is &quot;C. cuneatum&quot;, an annual species more closely related to the perennial species &quot;C. canariense&quot; than any other annual species. These outsteps in the common trend of the phylogenies indicate that there may be close relatives that present as candidates for further cultivation. There is significant evolutionary distance between the common ancestors of the modern perennial and annual species, but this research gives hope that there may be a possibility of cultivating a perennial species as a food crop.

==Hybridization==
Hybridization, or the reproduction of two species to create distinctive offspring, is especially important in developing new food crops from existing species. Because of the phylogenetic and genetic data studied and produced in the past, a hybrid between perennial and annual &quot;Cicer&quot; species is promising. Many steps have been taken to improve the hybridization techniques and results between perennial and annual species, but it has proven difficult to create a viable offspring from these crosses. Not surprisingly, it has been relatively easy to hybridize annuals together and perennials together. Other research has shown some success with crossing specific annual and perennial species of the genus. One particularly successful cross between &quot;the annual &quot;C. cuneatum&quot; and perennial &quot;C. canariense&quot;&quot; showed a &quot;partially fertile with intermediate morphology&quot; F-1 generation.

This success, however, is determined by which species provides each gamete and therefore presents some possible difficulties in cultivating the crop further. This cross is especially interesting because it is one of the few partial successes of the perennial and annual crosses, which have proven especially difficult. Furthermore, the species crossed, &quot;C. cuneatum&quot; and &quot;C. canariense&quot; were previously determined as sister species during evolutionary analysis in previous research.

Such research is at the forefront of developing a perennial food crop for &quot;Cicer&quot; that is related to its modern cultivar, the chickpea. Perennial crops have an advantage to food production because they are a more sustainable food option than annual crops. As seen, the genetic and evolutionary relationships of the species play a crucial role in developing hybrids between the species, and can be used to determine further relationships.

<doc id="445761" wikidata="Q1153284" url="?curid=445761" title="Cyclopia">
<text>Cyclopia (named after the Greek mythology characters cyclopes), also known as alobar holoprosencephaly, is the most extreme form of holoprosencephaly and is a congenital disorder (birth defect) characterized by the failure of the embryonic prosencephalon to properly divide the orbits of the eye into two cavities. Its incidence is 1 in 16,000 in born animals and 1 in 200 in miscarried fetuses.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Typically, the nose is either missing or not functional. This deformity (called proboscis) forms above the center eye and is characteristic of a form of cyclopia called rhinencephaly or rhinocephaly. Most such embryos are either naturally miscarried or are stillborn upon delivery.

Although cyclopia is rare, several cyclopic human babies are preserved in medical museums (e.g. The Vrolik Museum, Amsterdam, Trivandrum Medical College).

Some extreme cases of cyclopia have been documented in farm animals (horses, sheep, pigs, goats, and sometimes chickens). In such cases, the nose and mouth fail to form, or the nose grows from the roof of the mouth, obstructing airflow and resulting in suffocation shortly after birth.

== Causes ==
Genetic defects or toxins can misdirect the embryonic forebrain-dividing process. One highly teratogenic alkaloid toxin that can cause cyclopia is cyclopamine or 2-deoxyjervine, found in the plant &quot;Veratrum californicum&quot; (also known as corn lily or false hellebore). Grazing animals are most likely to ingest this plant and induce cyclopia in offspring. People sometimes accidentally ingest false hellebore while pregnant thinking it is hellebore, which has been suggested as a &quot;natural&quot; treatment for vomiting, cramps, and poor circulation – three conditions which may be present in the early stages of pregnancy. Cyclopia occurs when certain proteins are inappropriately expressed, causing the brain to stay whole, rather than developing two distinct hemispheres. This leads to the fetus having one optic lobe and one olfactory lobe, resulting in the eye and nose malformations of cyclopia.

The Sonic hedgehog protein (SHH) is the gene regulator involved in the separation of the single eye field into two bilateral fields. 
Although not proven, it is thought that SHH emitted from the prechordal plate suppresses Pax6, which causes the eye field to divide into two. If the SHH gene is mutated, the result is cyclopia, a single eye in the center of the face (Gilbert, 2000).

== Notable cases ==
* A British description from 1665 of a colt that appeared to have cyclopia reads:
* In October 1766, an infant in France was born with cyclopia, living for only a few hours. Reports of the case were made in the &quot;Mercure de France&quot; and an illustration of the infant was made by Marie Bihéron. The case was also mentioned in Volume IV of Buffon&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot;.

* On 1 March 1793, a 46-year-old woman in Boalts Torp, Glimåkra, Sweden gave birth to a child with cyclopia that died after two hours. The child was 35cm long, its face without nose and nostrils, and its lidless eye with no eyebrow sat raised on the middle of its forehead like a large blueberry. The wrists were somewhat crooked as well as the right foot which was completely crooked and bent inwards. It was not clear whether it was a boy or a girl, but it was believed to be the former.
* In November 1889, reports emerged from Umatilla County, Oregon, of a Nez Perce child with one eye in the center of the forehead. The child was reportedly healthy and &quot;able to see with ease, and ran about with as much freedom as any of his companions.&quot; Several individuals tried to locate the child to be put on display, but the tribe had left to hunt in the mountains by the time they arrived. It is unknown what became of the child.
* On December 28, 2005, a kitten with cyclopia, &quot;Cy&quot;, was born in Redmond, Oregon, United States and died about one day after birth.
* In 2006, a baby girl in India with cyclopia was born. Her only eye was in the center of her forehead. She did not have a nose and her brain did not separate into two separate hemispheres (holoprosencephaly). The child died one day after her birth.
* In 2011, an albino cyclops shark fetus was discovered in the body of a caught shark in Mexico, with no discernible nose and one giant eye. The unborn fetus was turned over for medical studies.
* On October 10, 2012, a small kitten was born. Its eye was in the center of the forehead and there was no developed nose to be found. The small cat died shortly after it was born. It was nicknamed Cleyed the Cyclops.
* On May 10, 2017, in Assam, India, a black goat was born with one eye and other cyclopia-related facial abnormalities. It was reported to still be alive over a week later, which is unusual for this condition.
*On September 13, 2018, in MandailingNatal, North Sumatra, Indonesia, a baby with cyclopia was born without a nose and one eye with the weight of 2.4kg (5.3lb) and heart rate under 100 bpm. The child died seven hours after birth.
*On March 16, 2022, a boy was born in Al Bayda, Yemen, with cyclopia. He died 7 hours after birth. He was seen in photos taken by Yemeni journalist Karim Zarai.
*In March 2024, a pig was born in Ilocos Sur, Philippines, with cyclopia.
*On December 21, 2024, a black she-goat was born in Shivasatakshi, Jhapa (Nepal), with cyclopia.

== Cultural significance ==

The Islamic State used photos of babies born with cyclopia in its recruitment campaign. ISIS claimed the photos depicted Masih ad-Dajjal, who according to the Hadith, would have only one eye. Mainstream Islamic scholars consider the prophecy as referring to a one-eyed man, not a cyclops. One infant whose image was circulated in 2014 was claimed to be Israeli, but was actually Bolivian and from 2008. The baby girl from India born in 2006 (see notable cases above) also had her image used.

<text>Creating a unified list of computer viruses is challenging due to inconsistent naming conventions. To combat computer viruses and other malicious software, many security advisory organizations and anti-virus software developers compile and publish virus lists. When a new virus appears, the rush begins to identify and understand it as well as develop appropriate counter-measures to stop its propagation. Along the way, a name is attached to the virus. Since anti-virus software compete partly based on how quickly they react to the new threat, they usually study and name the viruses independently. By the time the virus is identified, many names have been used to denote the same virus.

Ambiguity in virus naming arises when a newly identified virus is later found to be a variant of an existing one, often resulting in renaming. For example, the second variation of the Sobig worm was initially called &quot;Palyh&quot; but later renamed &quot;Sobig.b&quot;. Again, depending on how quickly this happens, the old name may persist.

== Scope ==
In terms of scope, there are two major variants: the list of &quot;in-the-wild&quot; viruses, which list viruses in active circulation, and lists of all known viruses, which also contain viruses believed not to be in active circulation (also called &quot;zoo viruses&quot;). The sizes are vastly different: in-the-wild lists contain a hundred viruses but full lists contain tens of thousands.

<text>Łeba ( , ; ) is a seaside town in the Pomeranian Voivodeship of northern Poland. It is located in the region of Gdańsk Pomerania (Pomerelia), near Łebsko Lake and the mouth of the river Łeba on the Slovincian Coast of the Baltic Sea.

==History==

The Pomerelian settlement of Łeba was first mentioned in a 1282 document of Mestwin II, Duke of Pomerania. At that time the village was located about two kilometers () west from the present mouth of the Łeba River. The church of St. Nicholas was mentioned in 1296. Łeba was part of fragmented Poland until 1309, when it was annexed by the Teutonic Order after their takeover of Gdańsk. Łeba received municipal rights by the State of the Teutonic Order in 1357. Located at the Łebsko Lake at the Baltic Sea, it developed to a fishing port and a wood marketplace.

In 1440, the town joined the Prussian Confederation, which opposed Teutonic rule, and upon the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon reincorporated the territory to the Kingdom of Poland in 1454. With Lauenburg (Lębork) Land it became a Polish fief during the Thirteen Years&#x27; War in 1455, held by the Dukes of Pomerania.

Old Łeba was threatened for many centuries by floods and expanding sand dunes and therefore was rebuilt in a safer location after 1558. The town was reintegrated with the Polish Crown after the death of the last Pomeranian duke Bogislaw XIV as part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship, until King John II Casimir Vasa enfeoffed Elector Frederick William I of Brandenburg-Prussia with Lauenburg Land by the 1657 Treaty of Bydgoszcz.

With the First Partition of Poland in 1772, Łeba was incorporated into Prussia. Soon after a large port was built on instruction of the Prussian king, whereby a broad channel between the Leba lake and the Baltic Sea was dug, which however did not weather the storms on the coast. Due to its picturesque setting, the Leba seaside after World War I became a popular resort for German bohémiens. The painter Max Pechstein and other expressionists frequented the place.

In the proximity of Leba there is a large former testing area for long-range rocket weapons operated by the Rheinmetall company. On the Leba spit the German long-range rocket Rheinbote was tested between 1941 and 1945. Also the V-1 flying bomb was tested here from 1943 to 1945. Between 1963 and 1973 33 Meteor sounding rockets were launched from Łeba.

In March 1945, shortly before the end of World War II, the region was occupied by the Red Army. Following the Potsdam Conference, after the end of the war the town became again part of Poland.

==Landmarks==
There is an abundance of architectural and natural attractions near Łeba, above all the Słowiński National Park with its moving sand dunes, about west of the city. Further objects of interest include:
*Ruins of the St. Nicholas church west of the city 
*Fishermen&#x27;s church of 1683 with a painting by Max Pechstein
*Fishermen&#x27;s dwellings from the 19th century in Kościuszki street
* 19th century casino on Nadmorska street, today the Hotel Neptun
*Former rocket test site near Pletka
*Dinosaur park south of the city

==Climate==
Łeba has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;).

==Demographics==
Since the medieval Christianization of the region, the local population was Catholic. After the Reformation, the inhabitants of the town were predominantly Protestants and the area was subjected to Germanisation. Since the end of World War II the population is predominantly composed of Polish Roman Catholics.

<text>== Unix-like ==
In Unix-like operating systems, new processes are created by the codice_1 system call. The PID is returned to the parent process, enabling it to refer to the child in further function calls. The parent may, for example, wait for the child to terminate with the codice_2 function, or terminate the process with codice_3.

There are two tasks with specially distinguished process IDs: PID 0 is used for &quot;swapper&quot; or &quot;sched&quot;, which is part of the kernel and is a process that runs on a CPU core whenever that CPU core has nothing else to do. Linux also calls the threads of this process &quot;idle tasks&quot;. In some APIs, PID 0 is also used as a special value that always refers to the calling thread, process, or process group. Process ID 1 is usually the init process primarily responsible for starting and shutting down the system. Originally, process ID 1 was not specifically reserved for init by any technical measures: it simply had this ID as a natural consequence of being the first process invoked by the kernel. More recent Unix systems typically have additional kernel components visible as &#x27;processes&#x27;, in which case PID 1 is actively reserved for the init process to maintain consistency with older systems.

Process IDs, in the first place, are usually allocated on a sequential basis, beginning at 0 and rising to a maximum value which varies from system to system. Once this limit is reached, allocation restarts at 300 and again increases. In macOS and HP-UX, allocation restarts at 100. However, for this and subsequent passes any PIDs still assigned to processes are skipped. Some consider this to be a potential security vulnerability in that it allows information about the system to be extracted, or messages to be covertly passed between processes. As such, implementations that are particularly concerned about security may choose a different method of PID assignment. On some systems, like MPE/iX, the lowest available PID is used, sometimes in an effort to minimize the number of process information kernel pages in memory.

The current process ID is provided by a codice_4 system call, or as a variable codice_5 in shell. The process ID of a parent process is obtainable by a codice_6 system call.

On Linux, the maximum process ID is given by the pseudo-file codice_7.

=== Pidfile ===
Some processes, for example, the moc music player and the MySQL daemon, write their PID to a documented file location, to allow other processes to look it up.

== Microsoft Windows ==
On the Windows family of operating systems, one can get the current process&#x27;s ID using the codice_8 function of the Windows API, and ID of other processes using codice_9. Internally, process ID is called a &quot;client ID&quot;, and is allocated from the same namespace as thread IDs, so these two never overlap. The System Idle Process is given process ID 0. The System Process is given the process ID 8 on Windows 2000 and 4 on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. On the Windows NT family of operating systems, process and thread identifiers are all multiples of 4, but it is not part of the specification.

He was also known for his appearances as one half of the double act, &quot;Francie and Josie&quot;, alongside Jack Milroy.

==Early life==
The youngest of three brothers, Robert Kerr Fulton was born into a non-theatrical family at 46 Appin Road, Dennistoun, Glasgow. Fulton&#x27;s mother, who was 40 at the time of his birth, developed severe postnatal depression. Due to this, Fulton grew up a &quot;solitary child&quot; and developed a &quot;voracious reading habit&quot; throughout his childhood. His father was a master locksmith who changed trades, purchasing a newsagent and stationery shop at 28 Roebank Street, Dennistoun. At the age of three, Fulton and his family moved to Riddrie, another district of Glasgow. There he attended the local primary school but later returned to Dennistoun for his secondary education at Whitehill Secondary School.

Fulton completed his education in 1939 and decided to start in the acting profession after a backstage visit at the Glasgow Pavilion Theatre. In 1941, aged 17, Fulton joined the Royal Navy. The following year he was posted to HMS &quot;Ibis&quot;, but that November the ship was sunk in the Bay of Algiers. Fulton spent five hours in the water before being rescued. He later joined the Coastal Forces for D-Day, travelling back and forth between Gosport and Arromanches with vital supplies. In 1945, four years after signing up, Fulton was invalided out of the Navy due to blackouts, leaving with the rank of sub-lieutenant.

==Career==
Fulton began his professional acting career as a straight actor, mostly appearing in repertory theatre and BBC Radio, including &quot;The Gowrie Conspiracy&quot; in 1947. He also maintained a secondary job in the stationery business with his brothers. When the bank pulled money from their enterprise, however, Fulton gave his full attention to his acting career.

In the early 1950s, Fulton moved to London and became the compère of &quot;The Show Band Show&quot;, working alongside the likes of singer Frank Sinatra. After a short period, Fulton returned to Scotland to perform for Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd in pantomime from 1956 at the Alhambra Theatre, Glasgow with Jimmy Logan and Kenneth McKellar followed by the &quot;Five Past Eight&quot; summer revues with Stanley Baxter and Fay Lenore.

In 1957 he appeared, with Tommy Steele, as the Dame in the pantomime Goldilocks and the Three Bears at the Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool. His 1958 pantomime appearance was in Sinbad The Sailor at the Alhambra Theatre, Glasgow In 1959 he appeared again in Sinbad The Sailor, with Reg Varney at the King&#x27;s Theatre, Edinburgh.

In 1960, he headlined in the new Scottish pantomime &quot;A Wish for Jamie,&quot; with Kenneth McKellar, Fay Lenore and Reg Varney, which premiered at the Alhambra Theatre Glasgow, and in its sequel &quot;A Love for Jamie,&quot; which ran for three consecutive winters. He starred in pantomime and Five Past Eight in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. While working at the King&#x27;s Theatre, Edinburgh, Fulton met comedian Jack Milroy. Together they created a stage double act named &quot;Francie and Josie&quot;, two Teddy Boys from Glasgow. In one of his first forays into television, Fulton brought the act to television in 1962&#x27;s Scottish Television series, &quot;The Adventures of Francie and Josie&quot;. The series established both Fulton and Milroy as household names in Scotland. In 1970 and 1989, they were jointly named Scotland&#x27;s &quot;Light Entertainers of the Year&quot;. In 1977, Fulton produced &quot;The Scotched Earth Show&quot; with Gordon Menzies for the BBC. Menzies later produced Fulton&#x27;s most popular sketch series, &quot;Scotch and Wry.&quot;

Fulton continued to perform regularly in pantomime and in straight theatre, mostly notably with the Royal Lyceum Company in Edinburgh and the Scottish Theatre Company based in Glasgow. However, it was the comedy sketch show, &quot;Scotch and Wry&quot;, that became a Hogmanay institution. The series featured one of Fulton&#x27;s most remembered characters, the Reverend I.M. Jolly, a dour, depressed minister prone to inappropriate television conversations. The series began in 1978 and continued for 15 years, and was shown only once throughout the United Kingdom in 1983. Fulton was named Scottish Television Personality of the Year in 1963 and 1979.

In 1981, Fulton played Oliphant in the Scottish Theatre Company&#x27;s production of Robert Kemp&#x27;s play, &quot;Let Wives Tak Tent&quot;. In 1982, he made an appearance in the film &quot;Gorky Park,&quot; where he played a KGB officer. Director Michael Apted chose Fulton for the role because &quot;he [Apted] had never seen such cruel eyes&quot;. He also performed in Bill Forsyth&#x27;s &quot;Local Hero&quot; and &quot;Comfort and Joy.&quot; In 1985, under the pseudonym &quot;Rabaith&quot;, Fulton, along with Denise Coffey, adapted the French playwright Molière&#x27;s, &quot;Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme&quot; as &quot;A Wee Touch o&#x27; Class.&quot; He performed in the lead role at that year&#x27;s Edinburgh Fringe; the Festival re-booked it for the following year and it went on tour throughout Scotland.

Fulton made several guest appearances in other BBC Scotland programmes. Alongside his &quot;Scotch and Wry&quot; co-stars Gregor Fisher and Tony Roper, Fulton made two appearances in &quot;Rab C. Nesbitt&quot;; once in 1988 and 10 years later in 1998. In 1992, Fulton was awarded the Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and a year later the Lifetime Achievement award from BAFTA Scotland. In 1994, he again appeared alongside Fisher as Dan McPhail, The Vital Spark&#x27;s engineer, in &quot;The Tales of Para Handy&quot;. In 1996, after 36 years of performing as Francie and Josie, Fulton and Milroy appeared in their &quot;Final Farewell&quot; at the King&#x27;s Theatre, Glasgow. Milroy later died in 2001, aged 85 years.

Fulton&#x27;s last full performance on television came on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999 with the comedy special &quot;It&#x27;s a Jolly Life&quot; and his final &quot;Last Call&quot; monologue as the Reverend I.M. Jolly. After saying his final goodbye to television, Fulton wrote and published his autobiography, &quot;Is It That Time Already?&quot; (1999). In 1994, Fulton was awarded an honorary Doctor of Arts from Abertay University, Dundee, in 1995 an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Strathclyde and in 2000 another honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of St Andrews.

==Personal life==
Fulton was first married to actress Ethel Scott, who appeared with him on &quot;The Rikki Fulton Show&quot; in 1960 and 1961. While separated from their respective partners, Fulton met Audrey Matheson Craig-Brown (known as Kate Matheson), an actress 13 years his junior. Matheson saw Fulton perform in a production of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Hay Fever&quot;, but it would be 17 years before they met in person. After one day together, Fulton proposed and they married in 1969. In 1976, Matheson became pregnant but later lost the baby.

In 1998, Fulton began to display symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In 2001, his wife recalled that &quot;he [Fulton] returned home and devastatingly informed her, &quot;I can&#x27;t remember my lines any more&quot;. In 2002, after being diagnosed with the disease, Fulton remained at his own home and fronted that year&#x27;s Alzheimer Scotland Christmas appeal. He grew to depend on Kate more and more until, eventually, it was decided he move into the Quayside nursing home. In 2003, after breaking his hip in a fall, he was admitted to the Western Infirmary and then to Gartnavel Royal Hospital for assessment. After contracting the &quot;superbug&quot; MRSA and returning to Quayside, Fulton died peacefully on 27 January 2004, aged 79 years.

Fulton&#x27;s death sparked numerous dedications in his memory. The then-BBC Scotland Controller, John McCormick, said &quot;he [Fulton] was a legend for people across the whole country.&quot;

Fulton&#x27;s funeral took place six days after his death. In tribute to his &quot;Scotch and Wry&quot; character &quot;Supercop&quot; (a police traffic officer), police motorcyclists escorted the funeral cortège as it made its way to Clydebank Crematorium. The Reverend Alastair Symington, who was a close friend of Fulton, led the service, which featured tributes from Fulton&#x27;s widow Kate Matheson and Tony Roper. Symington had previously collaborated with Fulton on the book, &quot;For God&#x27;s Sake, Ask!&quot;. Both Rikki and his wife were strong supporters of the Scottish SPCA, which received a financial donation following Fulton&#x27;s funeral. A Scottish SPCA inspector represented the animal welfare organisation at the service.

Kate Matheson died in 2005 after completing a book about her relationship with Fulton, entitled &quot;Rikki &amp; Me&quot;. For her funeral in Glasgow, Matheson requested no black ties should be worn because &quot;we [she and Fulton] were together again&quot;.

==Notable characters==
*&quot;Scotch and Wry&quot;

Supercop a frequently dimwitted traffic cop who rides a motorbike, his trademark is how he removes his goggles (pings off and flies off camera), is often getting into more trouble than those he stops. Carries a small pocket sized notepad and pencil.

Rev. I.M. Jolly a very downtrodden and pessimistic minister of the Church of Scotland, presents a fictional show &quot;Last Call&quot; where he has a heart to heart with the audience where he tells them what he has been up to that week. His tone is always low-key and down beat.

Rev. David Goodchild a minister who offered a few thoughts on &quot;Last Call&quot; and has an unfortunate mix up between his water and neat gin. Rev. David Goodchild is often confused with Rev. I.M. Jolly, but they were two different people.

Dickie Dandruff owner of &quot;The Fourways Café&quot; also goes by the moniker &quot;The Gallowgate Gourmet&quot; and presents a cooking segment called &quot;Dirty Dick&#x27;s Delicat&#x27;messen&quot; where he prepares food in comedic style from his filthy café kitchen in the Gallowgate area of Glasgow.

*Francie and Josie

Josie is also another much loved character from his comedy show &quot;Francie and Josie&quot; with co-star Jack Milroy who played &quot;Francie&quot;.

<text>Rushden &amp; Diamonds Football Club was an association football club based in Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire, England. Nicknamed &quot;The Diamonds&quot;, the club played at Nene Park. The club&#x27;s main rivals were county neighbours Kettering Town.

The club was formed by a merger of Rushden Town and Irthlingborough Diamonds in 1992. They entered the Southern League and won the Midland Division in the 1993–94 season and the Premier Division in the 1995–96 season. They then spent five seasons in the Conference National, before they won a place in the Football League after winning the 2000–01 Conference title. They lost the 2002 play-off final and then secured promotion into the Second Division after winning the Third Division title in 2002–03. Relegated the following season, they lost their Football League status after finishing bottom of League Two in 2006. The club were expelled from the Conference on 11 June 2011; their unstable financial position meant they could not guarantee to complete all their fixtures in the 2011–12 season, and resulted in their dissolution. They were succeeded by phoenix club AFC Rushden &amp; Diamonds.

==History==
===The merger and the early years (1992–96)===
Rushden and Diamonds was formed on 21 April 1992 by a merger of Rushden Town and Irthlingborough Diamonds. The move was the brainchild of Max Griggs. On 22 August 1992, Ollie Kearns scored the first league goal in the club&#x27;s history, against Bilston Town in the Southern League Midland Division. The club&#x27;s first few seasons were remarkable for the success the team enjoyed, finishing 3rd in the Southern League Midland Division in their inaugural season. The following year they won the division, winning promotion to the Southern League Premier Division, and two years later the Diamonds were again promoted as champions. The team had gained promotion to the Football Conference after just four years as a club.

===Football Conference===
After their rapid rise to the top tier of non-league football, the club then spent five seasons attempting to reach the Football League, finishing 12th in the 1996–97 season, and then 4th, 4th and 2nd in the Football Conference before they finally won promotion to the Football League as champions in 2001. It was within this period that the club had achieved their best success in the FA Cup, getting to the 3rd Round twice. In 1998–99, the Diamonds held Leeds United to a famous 0–0 draw at Nene Park, ahead of a record attendance of 6,431. After taking a shock early lead at Elland Road in the replay, they went on to lose 3–1. In the following campaign, the club were rewarded with a 3rd Round draw away to Sheffield United. The Diamonds secured a 1–1 draw at Bramall Lane, to force a replay. In the return fixture, the match went to penalties following a 1–1 deadlock after extra-time. In the shootout however, it was the Blades who finally edged the Diamonds out 6–5 to go through.

===The Football League===
In their first season in new surroundings, the Diamonds reached the Division Three Play-Off Final. After overcoming Rochdale 4–3 on aggregate over the two-legged Semi-Final, the club lost to Cheltenham Town in the final, 3–1 at the Millennium Stadium. In 2003, they won the division, pipping Hartlepool United to the Division Three championship on the last day of the season – their third promotion/league title in eight seasons.

The 2003–04 season in Division Two proved to be one of difficulty for Rushden &amp; Diamonds. Despite a promising early start, a run of bad results over the winter period saw the club slip down the table, and in March 2004 Brian Talbot left the club after seven years as manager. The transfer window saw star players Paul Underwood, Onandi Lowe, Paul Hall and Marcus Bignot all depart as off the pitch problems mounted, and the club severely struggled for the remainder of the season. Barry Hunter took over as caretaker player-manager but they were relegated in 22nd place after losing their last three games of the season.

Ernie Tippett was confirmed as permanent manager for the start of the 2004–05 season. However, after a dismal run of results which saw the team the media predicted as promotion contenders fall to 22nd place in the League Two, he was sacked, and replaced by Barry Hunter, who was later appointed full-time manager. The club staved off relegation. The following season, after a summer in which Max Griggs handed the club over to the Supporters&#x27; Trust, the club continued to struggle and on 29 April, Rushden were relegated back to the Football Conference after a 2–0 away defeat to Boston United. Hunter&#x27;s contract was not renewed over the summer.

===Back in the Conference===

The seasons following the Diamonds&#x27; return to the Football Conference were marred by instability on and off the pitch. Keith Cousins took over the club in November 2006 and resigned in 2011. He was replaced by Liam Beasant and Gary Calder, the latter of whom himself quit the club just weeks after taking over. Meanwhile, five managers (Paul Hart, Tony Godden, Graham Westley, Garry Hill and Justin Edinburgh) took control of the team at different times.

During their first three seasons back in England&#x27;s fifth division the Diamonds failed to finish in the top ten. By the end of the 2008–09 season the average attendance was less than 50% of what it had been during their last season in the Football League. The sole highlight of these three years was reaching the Conference League Cup Final against Aldershot Town in 2007. With the scores level at 3–3 after extra-time, the Diamonds lost 4–3 on penalties.

However, the Diamonds&#x27; fortunes changed after the resignation of Garry Hill in February 2009, and the subsequent appointment of Justin Edinburgh as manager – initially as caretaker, but then full-time. During his first full season in charge he led the club to the Football Conference play-offs as a result of finishing in 4th place– their first top-ten finish since 2003. The team eventually succumbed to a 3–1 aggregate defeat at the hands of eventual play-off winners Oxford United. The Diamonds also progressed to the second round of the FA Cup, having beaten Workington and Hinckley United before being knocked out by Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at the Withdean Stadium.

The Diamonds struggled to replicate their successes the following season. During the summer and throughout the season some of the most influential players of the previous campaign left Nene Park, including Lee Tomlin, Mark Byrne, Jamie Stuart, Andrew Lawton and Paul Terry. Because of these losses the Diamonds struggled to make a serious play-off push, and by mid-April were 10th in the table, some thirteen points off a promotion spot. Disappointing runs in the FA Cup, FA Trophy and Hillier Cup did little to consolidate the campaign.

Off-pitch events, however, defined the season. Any footballing disappointments were overshadowed by the death of first-team (and England C national football team 2010 Player of the Year) goalkeeper Dale Roberts on 14 December 2010. Meanwhile, chairman Keith Cousins resigned and was replaced by Gary Calder and Liam Beasant. Little over a month later vice-chairman Helen Thompson resigned from her position also, while by March – just three months after taking charge – Calder himself quit the club. As the season drew to an end it was also revealed that the club was under a transfer embargo, and that only the intervention of the PFA prevented the Diamonds players refusing to play a game against Mansfield Town in March due to unpaid wages. Early in the season the club had also become involved in a very public row with ex-player Leon Knight, who took to Twitter to air his grievances against the club.

===Decline===
The club were expelled from the Conference National on 11 June 2011, because their unstable financial position meant they could not guarantee being able to complete all their fixtures in the 2011–12 season. The club faced a winding-up petition, lodged by HM Revenue and Customs in the week commencing 13 June 2011, with reported debts of £750,000. An application in July to move to enter the Southern Football League was unsuccessful, and the club entered administration on 7 July 2011.

Fans immediately announced their desire to create a new fan-owned club called AFC Rushden &amp; Diamonds that would field a senior side in 2012. The new club started in the United Counties League Division One.

==Club badge==
The club&#x27;s traditional colours are red, white and blue, which are reflected in the club&#x27;s badge. The crest uses aspects from both the respective Rushden Town and Irthlingborough Diamonds badges. It is formed by a shield-like shape, with &#x27;R&amp;DFC&#x27; written in banner form underneath. In the top left corner is the Rampant Lion, representing the Sartoris family, who donated some land on Hayden Road to Rushden Sports Club in 1922.

On the opposite side at the top sit the Crosskeys of St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Irthlingborough. Taken from the old Irthlingborough Diamonds crest, there are two keys, one for heaven and one for hell. Below the Lion in the bottom left quarter of the badge are the &#x27;Blue Diamonds&#x27;, taken from the old Irthlingborough Diamonds logo. Similarly, the three &#x27;Red and White Hoops&#x27; sitting to the right originate from Rushden Town&#x27;s badge. An illustration of the local River Nene runs through the centre of the badge, whilst the football located between the Diamonds and Hoops is self-explanatory.

==Stadium==
Rushden &amp; Diamonds played their home games at Nene Park, which was located on the outskirts of Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire adjacent to the A6, the stadium had a capacity of 6,441 (4,641 seated).

Initially the home of Irthlingborough Diamonds (the ground was obtained from the water board in 1969, providing the home for Irthlingborough Diamonds for over 20 years.), the stadium became the home of Rushden and Diamonds following the merger, and underwent major improvements during the 1990s and early 2000s as the club climbed up through the divisions.

The ground had also played host to England U21s games, as well as England C internationals. It served as a training camp for athletes competing at the 2012 London Olympics.

==Rivalries==

===Kettering Town===
Rushden&#x27;s main rivals were nearby Kettering Town. The clubs played seventeen competitive games together, 16 in the Conference National and one in the FA Cup. The first competitive game between the sides was played out on 8 March 1997, with Rushden running out 5–1 winners at Rockingham Road. In the early years, derby games between the two would regularly attract crowds in excess of 4,500. The clubs remained in the same division for five seasons before, in 2001, Rushden gained promotion to the Football League, while Kettering were relegated that same season from the Conference. After a seven-year gap, in 2008–09 the teams again found themselves in the same division, after Rushden suffered two quickfire relegations and Kettering gained promotion from the Conference North.

In the 16 league games contested and over 1,000 minutes of league football played between the two sides, Kettering won just twice, while Rushden recorded nine victories. In the same number of games, Rushden scored 25 goals to the Poppies&#x27; eight. On 3 January 2011, for the most recent game between the two sides, Kettering ended an 11-year wait for a win over the Diamonds, beating Rushden for only the second time in their history with a 2–1 triumph at Nene Park. Throughout the history of the fixture, Rushden &amp; Diamonds maintained an impressive of record of having never lost a competitive away match against Kettering Town.

Past fixtures between the clubs played host to some unsavoury incidents. Diamonds frontman Duane Darby was charged with assault in November 2000, after a head-butting incident in the players tunnel, after a home match with Kettering on 23 September 2000. In a friendly match between the teams at Kettering in 2005, two flares were thrown onto the pitch. During another match between the two sides at Rockingham Road on Shrove Tuesday in 1998, eggs and flour were thrown over the wall at the Rushden fans. In a game between the two teams at Nene Park in 2009, a flare was thrown onto the playing surface from the Rushden section, prompting an investigation. That game also saw nine arrests, and the use of 60 police officers and a police helicopter.

===Northampton Town===
The rivalry between the Diamonds and Northampton Town occurred between 2004 and 2006, when the two clubs played in League Two together for two seasons. Eight games were played between the sides – four competitive league games and four pre-season cup games. The Diamonds recorded a sole league victory over Northampton, a 3–2 win at Nene Park during the 2004–2005 season thanks to a last minute goal from Billy Sharp. They also beat their rivals in two pre-season Maunsell Cup games. After the Diamonds&#x27; relegation out of the Football League this rivalry diminished in relevance, especially as this relegation led to the re-ignition of the Rushden-Kettering rivalry.

===Other local rivals===
Rushden also enjoyed rivalries with various other clubs throughout their history. Peterborough United and Luton Town were seen as small rivals during the club&#x27;s Football League days, due to the relative geographical proximity of the three clubs. Following the Diamonds&#x27; relegation into the Conference, however (despite Luton&#x27;s presence there also from 2009) these rivalries diminished considerably.

Rushden also had past rivalries from the club&#x27;s younger years with Kidderminster Harriers, Cheltenham Town and Yeovil Town, with the three clubs often competing against each other in their various play-off and championship pushes.

<text>Reading Recovery is a short-term intervention approach designed for English-speaking children aged five or six, who are the lowest achieving in literacy after their first year of school. For instance, a child who is unable to read the simplest of books or write their own name, after a year in school, would be appropriate for a referral to a Reading Recovery program. The intervention involves intensive one-to-one lessons for 30 minutes a day with a teacher trained in the Reading Recovery method, for between 12 and 20 weeks.

Reading Recovery was developed in the 1970s by New Zealand educator Marie Clay. After lengthy observations of early readers, Clay defined reading as a message-getting, problem-solving activity, and writing as a message-sending, problem-solving activity. Clay suggested that both activities involved linking invisible patterns of oral language with visible symbols. The approach has come under increasing scrutiny in the 21st century.

==Reading Recovery use and practice==
&quot;Reading Recovery&quot; is in use in a number of English-speaking countries. The phrase &quot;Reading Recovery&quot; is a proprietary registered trademark held by the Marie Clay Trust in New Zealand, with Ohio State University in the US and the Institute of Education in the UK. The Marie Clay Trust and the International Reading Recovery Trainers Organization (IRRTO) licenses use of the title &quot;Reading Recovery&quot; to affiliated entities around the world.

===Australia===

In 2015, a report from the New South Wales Department of Education, concluded that Reading Recovery was largely ineffective, and should not be used for most children. As a result, in 2016, Reading Recovery lost its &quot;mandated status&quot; as part of the curriculum in NSW&#x27;s more than 900 public schools, although individual schools may still opt to use it. A further consequence of this shift in policy is that, in 2017, the NSW Department of Education initiated a hiring program to recruit dozens of new literacy and numeracy experts to support teachers in &quot;evidence-based professional learning&quot;, according to NSW Minister for Education, Rob Stokes.

===New Zealand===

After Reading Recovery was removed from the curriculum in many Australian schools, its utility has been questioned by researchers and policy makers in New Zealand as well. By 2019, this had led to reduction in use of Reading Recovery in New Zealand&#x27;s public schools, and toward a greater emphasis on phonics-based instruction. 
 Parent activism has also contributed to a rise in phonics based instruction and a concomitant decrease in three cueing system (meaning, structural, and visual cueing) based instruction in New Zealand schools.

===North America===

The Reading Recovery Council of North America, Inc. is a not-for-profit association of Reading Recovery professionals, advocates, and partners. It is an advocate for Reading Recovery throughout North America (United States and Canada). It publishes two journals for this purpose: &quot;The Journal of Reading Recovery&quot; and &quot;Literacy Teaching and Learning&quot;.

Reading Recovery and philosophically similar programs are still used in the United States, but there has been significant push back against the approach. Several large school districts have rejected the approach in favor of phonics based instruction. These include Columbus, Ohio, and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

==Failures of Reading Recovery==

On April 23, 2022, the Center for Research in Education and Social Policy at the University of Delaware presented the results of a study of the long-term effects of Reading Recovery. The conclusion was that the &quot;long-term impact estimates were significant and negative&quot;. The study found that children who received Reading Recovery had scores on state reading tests in third and fourth grade that were below the test scores of similar children who did not receive Reading Recovery. It suggests three possible hypotheses for this outcome: 
# While Reading Recovery produces large impacts on early literacy measures, it does not give students the required skills for success in later grades; or, 
# The gains are lost because students do not receive sufficient intervention in later grades; or,
# The impacts of the early intervention was washed out by subsequent experiences.

<text>Linyphiidae, spiders commonly known as sheet weavers (from the shape of their webs), or money spiders (in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Portugal) is a family of very small spiders comprising 4706 described species in 620 genera worldwide. This makes Linyphiidae the second largest family of spiders after the Salticidae. The family is poorly understood due to their small body size and wide distribution; new genera and species are still being discovered throughout the world. The newest such genus is &quot;Himalafurca&quot; from Nepal, formally described in April 2021 by Tanasevitch. Since it is so difficult to identify such tiny spiders, there are regular changes in taxonomy as species are combined or divided.

Money spiders are known for drifting through the air via a technique termed &quot;ballooning&quot;.

Within the agriculture industry, money spiders are regarded as biological control agents against pest species like aphids and springtails.

==Description==
In Linyphiidae, the clypeus is normally over twice as high as the diameter of the anterior median eyes. The chelicerae have lateral stridulating ridges and lack lateral condyles.

The legs are long and thin, and bear macrosetae. The abdomen is usually oval or elongated.

==Distribution==

Spiders of this family occur nearly worldwide. In Norway many species have been found walking on snow at temperatures of down to −7 °C.

While these spiders are light enough to utilize ballooning for travel, they are limited by the physics of an often turbulent atmosphere and microclimate. For this reason ballooning spiders have little control over where they land, leading to a high mortality rate for the practice and its predominant usage by spiderlings and juveniles. The travel of money spiders by ballooning likely contributes to their vast distribution and speciation.

==Predators and prey==

* Among birds, goldcrests are known to prey on money spiders.
* Money spiders are known to prey on aphids, springtails, flies, and other spiders.

==Taxonomy==
The Pimoidae are the sister group to the Linyphiidae.

There are six subfamilies, of which Linyphiinae (the sheetweb spiders), Erigoninae (the dwarf spiders), and Micronetinae, contain the majority of described species.

Many species have been described in monotypic genera, especially in the Erigoninae, which probably reflects the scientific techniques traditionally used in this family. Common genera include &quot;Neriene&quot;, &quot;Lepthyphantes&quot;, &quot;Erigone&quot;, &quot;Eperigone&quot;, &quot;Bathyphantes&quot;, &quot;Troglohyphantes&quot;, &quot;Tennesseellum&quot; and many others. These are among the most abundant spiders in the temperate regions, although many are also found in the tropics. The generally larger bodied members of the subfamily Linyphiinae are commonly found in classic &quot;bowl and doily&quot; webs or filmy domes. The usually tiny members of the Erigoninae are builders of tiny sheet webs. These tiny spiders (usually 3 mm or less) commonly balloon even as adults and may be very numerous in a given area on one day, only to disappear the next.

Males in the subfamily Erigoninae typically have modified cephalothoraxes. These modifications are diagnostic for a given taxon, being genus or species-specific. These come in an impressive array of forms including, but not limited to, grooves, tubercles, projections, bumps, lobes, and spines. Occasionally, the projections may be decorated with tufts of hair or even bear eyes.

The following are select examples of species in which males possess rather remarkable modifications. &quot;Walckenaeria acuminata&quot; has its eyes placed on a tall, thin spire whose height exceeds the length of the cephalothorax. &quot;Grammonota gigas&quot; has a transverse row of four longitudinal lobes behind the eyes. &quot;Gnathonargus unicorn&quot; has a long, slender, upward-pointing clypeal projection resembling a unicorn horn. &quot;Hypselistes florens&quot; has a cephalic lobe shaped like an hourglass when viewed from the front. &quot;Perregrinus deformis&quot; has a short, downcurved clypeal projection resembling a human nose. &quot;Praestigia kulczynskii&quot; has its anterior median eyes placed ventrally at the end of a long, thick projection issuing from the clypeus. The genera &quot;Coreorgonal&quot; and &quot;Spirembolus&quot; have their cephalic regions deeply divided into two pronounced lobes. &quot;Eskovia exarmata&quot; has a cephalothorax shaped like a trapezoid when viewed laterally. &quot;Horcotes quadricristatus&quot; has a single, sharp tooth sticking up between the anterior and posterior eyes.

Similarly, the pedipalps of males range from simple to complex in their design, with some possessing striking features and arrangements of palpal sclerites that are unique for a given genus and/or species.

A few spiders in this family include:
*Bowl and doily spider, &quot;Frontinella pyramitela&quot;
*Filmy dome spider, &quot;Neriene radiata&quot;
*Blacktailed red sheetweaver, &quot;Florinda coccinea&quot;
*&quot;Orsonwelles&quot;, a genus of giant Hawaiian Linyphids containing the largest Linyphiid, &quot;O. malus&quot;.
*&quot;Erigone atra&quot;, a dwarf spider

<text>Patricio José Patrón Laviada (born December 17, 1957, in Mérida, Yucatán) is a Mexican politician who served as Governor of Yucatán from 2001 to 2007. He is currently serving as Attorney General of Environmental Protection (Procuraduria Federal de Proteccion al Ambiente), a position to which he was appointed by Felipe Calderón, President of Mexico, in January 2008.

Patricio Patrón is the first governor of the state of Yucatán who emanated from the National Action Party (PAN), through a coalition with the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), the Labor Party (PT) and the Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM), despite the contempt and the campaign organized against him by his predecessor Víctor Cervera, defeated his opponent of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Orlando Paredes Lara in the election that took place in 2001 by a wide margin, largely thanks to the program &quot;Adopt a City&quot; that was implemented by pianist Ermilo Castilla Roche.

Patrón took office as governor in 2001; his term of office expired in 2007. Patrón became Municipal president of Mérida for the 1995 – 1998 term beating Ricardo Dájer of the PRI. Patrón then served as a senator representing his state before being elected governor. He is a member of the National Action Party and currently serves as Attorney General for Environmental Protection.

<doc id="445791" wikidata="Q7042399" url="?curid=445791" title="Njars">
<text>Njarar or Njars were an ancient Germanic people of Närke, Sweden, that appears in the Scandinavian version of the Lay of Weyland the smith. In the early part of the lay, King Níðuðr is introduced as a king in Sweden:

Later he is specified as the lord of the Njars:

The Njars probably lost their independence early to the Swedish king at Uppsala, and they are not mentioned by Jordanes in his thorough listing of tribes in Scandza, in the sixth century. There are few mentions of the Njarar/Nerikjar in Old Norse sources, but for exceptions see King of Nerike.

==Linguistic notes==
At first glance, the name is hard to recognize, because the people of Nerike are otherwise called the &quot;Nerikjar&quot; in Old Norse sources. However, &quot;njar&quot; is a breaking of an older &quot;ner&quot;. The same sound change happened with &quot;eka&quot; and &quot;hertõ&quot; which resulted in &quot;jag&quot; (I) and &quot;hjarta&quot; (heart). However, in the case of &quot;Njar&quot;, the sound change never became established, and the older form &quot;ner&quot; continued to be used for the province and its population.

&quot;Ner&quot; is, in its turn, an umlaut from an older &quot;nar&quot; which is cognate to English &quot;narrow&quot;. The name referred to the narrow inlets that characterized the geography. The north-eastern (Kvismaren-Hjälmaren) has disappeared artificially, but the southern part of the province still has a large fjord.

<text>Ted Nebbeling (1943/44 – October 28, 2009) was a Canadian politician who served as a member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) of British Columbia, representing the electoral district of West Vancouver-Garibaldi from 1996 to 2005. As part of the British Columbia Liberal Party caucus, he was Minister of State for the Community Charter from 2001 to 2004 under Premier Gordon Campbell.

==Biography==
Born in Amsterdam, Nebbeling moved to Canada in 1977 along with his partner Jan Holmberg, who was originally from Sweden. The couple operated a sandwich shop in Downtown Vancouver before selling the business and moving to Whistler in 1979, where they ran a number of retail stores. 

Concerned that the local economy was too dependent on winter activities, Nebbeling decided to run for office, becoming a Whistler municipal councillor in 1986 and winning re-election in 1988. He was then elected the municipality&#x27;s mayor in 1990, and won a second term in 1993. He also served as chair of the Sea to Sky Economic Development Commission, and as director of the Whistler Resort Association.

In the 1996 provincial election, he ran as a Liberal candidate in West Vancouver-Garibaldi, and was elected the riding&#x27;s MLA. While the Liberals were the official opposition, Nebbeling served as critic for municipal affairs, forests, and employment and investment in the 36th Parliament. He was re-elected in the 2001 provincial election, which saw the Liberals come to power with a majority government; he was named to Premier Gordon Campbell&#x27;s cabinet that June as Minister of State for Community Charter. In that role he was tasked with preparing legislation concerning the new Community Charter, which aimed to provide local governments with more power and flexibility. He was also involved in Vancouver/Whistler&#x27;s bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics.

A few months after same-sex marriage became legal in British Columbia, he married his partner Jan on November 15, 2003, becoming Canada&#x27;s highest-ranking politician at that point to be married to a same-sex partner. He was dropped from cabinet in a January 2004 shuffle, one day after his marriage was announced in the media. The government stated that the timing of the shuffle was a coincidence and without prejudicial intent, as Nebbeling was openly gay at the time of his election.

In January 2005, Nebbeling announced that he would not run again in that May&#x27;s provincial election. After finishing his term as MLA, he entered the race once more for mayor of Whistler, but lost in that November&#x27;s municipal election to Ken Melamed.

After being diagnosed with colon cancer in 2008, he died from the illness on October 28, 2009 in Vancouver, aged 65.

<text>An advertising agency, often referred to as a creative agency or an ad agency, is a business dedicated to creating, planning, and handling advertising and sometimes other forms of promotion and marketing for its clients. An ad agency is generally independent of the client; it may be an internal department or agency that provides an outside point of view to the effort of selling the client&#x27;s products or services, or an outside firm. An agency can also handle overall marketing and branding strategies promotions for its clients, which may include sales as well.

Typical ad agency clients include businesses and corporations, non-profit organizations and private agencies. Agencies may be hired to produce television advertisements, radio advertisements, online advertising, out-of-home advertising, mobile marketing, and AR advertising, as part of an advertising campaign.

== History ==
The first acknowledged advertising agency was William Taylor in 1786. Another early agency, started by James &#x27;Jem&#x27; White in 1800 at Fleet Street, London, eventually evolved into White Bull Holmes, a recruitment advertising agency, that went out of business in the late 1980s. In 1812 George Reynell, an officer at the &quot;London Gazette&quot;, set up another of the early advertising agencies, also in London. This remained a family business until 1993, as &#x27;Reynell &amp; Son,&#x27; and is now part of the TMP Worldwide agency (UK and Ireland) under the brand &quot;TMP&quot; Reynell. Another early agency that traded until recently, was founded by Charles Barker, and the firm he established traded as &#x27;Barkers&#x27; until 2009 when it went into Administration.

Volney B. Palmer opened the first American advertising agency, in Philadelphia in 1850. This agency placed ads produced by its clients in various newspapers.

In 1856, Mathew Brady created the first modern advertisement when he placed an ad in the New York Herald paper offering to produce &quot;photographs, ambrotypes, and daguerreotypes.&quot; His ads were the first whose typeface and fonts were distinct from the text of the publication and from that of other advertisements. At that time all newspaper ads were set in agate and only agate. His use of larger distinctive fonts caused a sensation. Later that same year Robert E. Bonner ran the first full-page ad in a newspaper.

In 1864, William James Carlton began selling advertising space in religious magazines. In 1869, Francis Ayer, at the age of 20, created the first full-service advertising agency in Philadelphia, called N.W. Ayer &amp; Son. It was the oldest advertising agency in America and dissolved in 2002.
James Walter Thompson joined Carlton&#x27;s firm in 1868. Thompson rapidly became their best salesman, purchasing the company in 1877 and renaming it the James Walter Thompson Company. Realizing that he could sell more space if the company provided the service of developing content for advertisers, Thompson hired writers and artists to form the first known Creative Department in an advertising agency. He is credited as the &quot;father of modern magazine advertising&quot; in the US. Advertising Age commemorated the first 100 years of the agency in 1964, noting that its &quot;history and expansion overseas seems peculiarly to match the whole history of modern advertising.&quot;

== Global advertising agency ==
Globalization of advertising originates in earlier days of the twentieth century. American advertising agencies began as the process of opening overseas offices before the two World Wars and accelerated their globalization throughout the latter part of the twentieth century.

McCann, an agency established in New York City in 1902, opened its first European offices by 1927. It was followed up with offices opening in South America in 1935 and in Australia in 1959.

Companies such as J. Walter Thompson adopted a strategy to expand in order to provide advertising services wherever clients operated.

In the 1960s and 1970s, English agencies began to realize the overseas opportunities associated with globalization. Expanding overseas gives potential to wider markets.

In the early 21st century, management consulting firms such as PwC Digital and Deloitte Digital began competing with ad agencies by emphasizing data analytics. , Accenture Interactive was the world&#x27;s sixth-largest ad agency, behind WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, Interpublic, and Dentsu. In 2019, it purchased David Droga&#x27;s Droga5 agency, the first major consultant acquisition of an ad agency.

== Client relationships ==
Studies show that successful advertising agencies tend to have a shared sense of purpose with their clients through collaboration. This includes a common set of client objectives where agencies feel a shared sense of ownership of the strategic process. Successful advertisements start with clients building a good relationship with the agencies and work together to figure out what their objectives are. Clients must trust the agencies to do their jobs correctly and accordingly with the resources they have provided. Breakdowns in relationships were more likely to occur when agencies felt undermined, subjugated, or even feel they do not have equal status. Traditionally advertising agencies tend to be in a position to take the lead on projects but results are best when there is a more collaborative relationship.

Stronger collaboration happens in situations where a personal chemistry has been established between both parties. Finding out similar likes and dislikes points of view, and even hobbies and passions. Personal chemistry builds with the length of the client relationship, frequency of meetings, and how far mutual respect goes between parties. This was one trait that advertising agencies were perceived to not always have. It was suggested that on occasions media planners and researchers were more closely involved in the project because of their personal relationships with their clients. Successful strategic planning is best when both parties are involved due to the bond between sides by understanding each other&#x27;s views and mindset.

Involved advertising account planners are seen to contribute towards successful agency-client collaboration. Planners of advertising agencies tend to be capable of creating a very powerful, trusting relationship with their clients because they were seen as intellectual prowess, seniority, and have empathy in the creative process.

== Agencies ==
All advertising agencies are called that because they are acting as agents for their principals which were the media. They were then, and are now, paid by the media to sell advertising space to clients. Originally, in the 18th century, and the first half of the 19th, advertising agencies made all of their income from commissions paid by the media for selling space to the client.

Although it is still the case that the majority of their income comes from the media, in the middle of the 19th century, agencies began to offer additional services which they sold directly to the client. Such services can include writing the text of the advertisement.

== Creativity ==

The use of creativity by agencies is &quot;unexpected&quot; because so much advertising today is expected. This will capture the attention of audiences, therefore the message is more likely to get through. There have been many advertisements that have surprised audiences because it was not normal for them to see that in an advertisement of that nature. The best use of creativity is when the agencies make consumers think about the product or brand. The type of creativity is distinctive communication which is breaking through the clutter.
==Largest advertising agencies==
The &quot;big six&quot; largest agencies, with their estimated worldwide revenues in quarter three of 2021 were:

# WPP, London $4.45 billion
# Omnicom Group, New York City $3.43 billion
# Publicis, Paris $2.96 billion
# IPG, New York City $2.26 billion
# Dentsu, Tokyo $2.25 billion
# Havas, Paris $668 million

<text>The Eskdalemuir Observatory is a UK national environmental observatory located near Eskdalemuir, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. Along with Lerwick and Hartland, Eskdalemuir is one of three permanent geomagnetic observatories in the United Kingdom.

Built in 1904, its remote location was chosen to minimise electrical interference with geomagnetic instruments, which were relocated here from Kew Observatory in London in 1908 after the spread of electric tramcars led to excessive electromagnetic interference there.

==Purpose==
The observatory is situated in the valley of the White Esk river at an altitude of 242 metres (794&#x27;), and so represents the climate of highland in northern Great Britain.

It currently monitors:

*Meteorological parameters
*Solar radiation
*Atmospheric pollution
*The UK Geomagnetic field
*Seismological activity

The observatory is managed by the British Geological Survey and the UK Met Office.

==Seismic measurements==

The area has a low background of seismic activity, so is ideal for these measurements.

Shortly after 19:00 GMT on 21 December 1988, the observatory&#x27;s seismometers recorded the ground impact of Pan Am Flight 103, which crashed into the nearby town of Lockerbie away after being destroyed by a bomb. The event registered 1.6 on the Richter magnitude scale.

There is a second seismic array approximately 2 miles (3 km) north of the main observatory established by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, which has been managed by Güralp Systems Ltd since 2002 on behalf of AWE Blacknest which provides the UK part of the international monitoring network of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. This network allows covert nuclear tests to be detected via their seismic signatures. At Eskdalemuir it consists of an array covering 10 square km (3¾ sq. mi.), consisting of two intersecting lines of 10 pits containing seismometers, a seismological vault and a recording laboratory.

== Historic atmospheric electricity measurements ==
Following the conventions of Kew Observatory, which preceded Eskdalemuir as a national geophysical laboratory, atmospheric electricity measurements formed a key part of the early operations. Atmospheric ion measurements were made by Lewis Fry Richardson. As Eskdalemuir is a relatively clean site distant from major towns and cities, the atmospheric electricity measurements have been analysed for global signals which are typically obscured at urban sites. The measuring technology followed that of Kew in employing a Kelvin water dropper electrometer for potential gradient measurements, changing to a radioactive polonium probe during the 1930s. The Eskdalemuir potential gradient was found to be correlated with measurements made simultaneously on the Carnegie research ship.

==Notable staff ==

*The meteorologist and mathematician Lewis Fry Richardson served as Superintendent at the Observatory between 1913 and 1918.
*Dr Arthur Crichton Mitchell superintendent of the observatory 1916 to 1922
*Dr Douglas Haig McIntosh worked here 1953 to 1955.

The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering three former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*Newark Municipal Borough
*Newark Rural District
*Southwell Rural District

The new district was initially named Newark, after its largest town. The name was changed to Newark and Sherwood in 1985.

==Governance==
Newark and Sherwood District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Nottinghamshire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being run by a partnership of Labour, the &quot;Independents for Newark and District&quot; group of independent councillors, and the Liberal Democrats.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Since 1974 political control of the council has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2003 have been:

===Composition===
Following two defections to the Green Party of England and Wales the composition of the council is:

Of the ten independent councillors, six sit together as the &quot;Independents for Newark and District&quot; group, which forms part of the council&#x27;s administration with Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Another two independents form the &quot;Newark and Sherwood District Independents&quot; group, and the other two do not belong to any group. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last full review of boundaries in 2015 the council has comprised 39 councillors representing 21 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

The district is covered by two parliamentary constituencies: Newark, created in 1885, which has been represented by Robert Jenrick, a Conservative, since 2014; and has been held by the Conservative Party since 2001; and Sherwood Forest, created in 1983, represented by Michelle Welsh, a Labour MP, elected in 2024.

===Premises===
The council is based at Castle House, on Great North Road in Newark, adjacent to Newark Castle Railway station. The building was purpose-built for the council and opened in 2017.
The council was previously based at Kelham Hall in the village of Kelham, which had been purchased early in 1974 as part of preparations for the local government reorganisation later that year.

==Settlements==

The whole district is divided into civil parishes. The parish councils for the three parishes of Newark, Ollerton and Boughton, and Southwell have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;.

Newark-on-Trent, together with Balderton, forms the largest urban area in the district. Newark-on-Trent has many important historic features including Newark Castle, St Mary&#x27;s Magdalene Church, Georgian architecture and a defensive earthwork from the British Civil Wars. Other important towns in the district include Ollerton and Southwell which is home to Southwell Minster and Southwell Racecourse.

<doc id="445813" wikidata="Q337260" url="?curid=445813" title="Lino Ventura">
<text>Angiolino Giuseppe Pasquale Ventura (14 July 1919 – 22 October 1987), known as Lino Ventura, was an Italian-born actor and philanthropist, who lived and worked for most of his life in France. He was considered one of the greatest leading men of French cinema during the 1960s and 1970s, known for his portrayal of tough characters on both sides of the law in crime dramas.

Born in Parma and raised in Paris, Ventura worked as a professional wrestler before an injury ended his career. He made his film debut as a gangster in the 1954 Jacques Becker film &quot;Touchez pas au grisbi&quot; and rapidly became one of France&#x27;s favourite film actors, playing opposite many other great stars and working with such leading directors as Louis Malle, Claude Sautet, and Claude Miller. Usually portraying a tough man, either a criminal or a cop, he also featured as a leader of the Resistance in the Jean-Pierre Melville-directed &quot;Army of Shadows&quot; (1969). He was nominanted for a Cesar Award for his portrayal of Jean Valjean in the 1982 film adaptation of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;.

After one of his four children, a daughter, was born handicapped, he and his wife founded a charity Perce-Neige (Snowdrop) which aids disabled children and their parents. Though a lifelong resident and pop cultural icon in France, Ventura always considered himself an Italian first and foremost, and never took French citizenship. He was nonetheless voted 23rd in a 2005 poll of the 100 greatest Frenchmen.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Born in Parma, Emilia-Romagna, Italy to Giovanni Ventura and Luisa Borrini, who moved to France soon thereafter, Lino dropped out of school at the age of eight and later took on a variety of jobs. At one point Ventura was pursuing a prizefighting and professional wrestling career, under the name Lino Borrini, but had to end it because of an injury.

===Early roles===
In 1953, by chance, one of his friends mentioned him to Jacques Becker who was looking for an Italian actor to play opposite Jean Gabin in a gangster movie called &quot;Touchez pas au grisbi&quot; (1954). Becker offered him on the spot the role of Angelo, which Ventura refused at first but then accepted. He had such a presence in the film that the whole profession took notice. The film was a big success.

Ventura started to build up an acting career in similar hard-boiled gangster films, often playing beside his friend Jean Gabin, including his second film, &quot;Razzia sur la chnouf&quot; (1955).

He followed it with &quot;Law of the Streets&quot; (1956), &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (1956) with Gabin.

===Later career===
Some of his most famous roles include the portrait of corrupt police chief Tiger Brown in &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; (1963) and mob boss Vito Genovese in &quot;The Valachi Papers&quot; (1972).

Although he remained an Italian citizen throughout his life and long used to seeing himself dubbed into Italian from the original French release, he only made a handful of films in his native language, among them &quot;The Last Judgement&quot; (&quot;Il giudizio universale&quot;, 1961), &quot;Illustrious Corpses&quot; (&quot;Cadaveri eccellenti&quot;, 1976) and &quot;Cento Giorni a Palermo&quot; (1983).

Ventura remained active until the year before his death from a heart attack in 1987 at the age of 68. Having a disabled daughter himself, he created a charitable foundation, &quot;Perce-Neige&quot; (&quot;Snowdrop&quot;) in 1966, which supports disabled people.

Throughout his career, he was one of the most popular actors of French cinema. He spoke French without any accent (excepting a Parisian one at the beginning of his career) and spoke Italian with a slight French accent, having arrived in France at the age of seven. Forcibly conscripted into the Italian army during the Second World War, he deserted. But, although his wife and four children were French, he never wanted to give up Italian citizenship, out of respect for his parents. Despite this, he was ranked 23rd of the 100 greatest Frenchmen, 17 years after his death.

Somewhat paradoxically, Ventura attributed his great success to his limited range as an actor; and often said &quot;If I cannot believe in a character, or if something does not ring true, I cannot act it.&quot;

In a 1980 interview he said that the previous year &quot;I began to realize how incredibly lucky I had been since the age of 9, how much I had been loved by so many people. When I act, I am doing what I love, and I am paid for it. So I put myself in the service of the film, never the film in service to me.&quot; He mentioned he turned down several roles - a part in &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (cut from the final film), a role in a Robert Aldrich film and the part played by François Truffaut in &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;.

He said, &quot;The story is everything. My good friend Jean Gabin told me 25 years ago there are three important things in movies: the story, the story and the story.&quot;

&quot;I have limitations,&quot; he said. &quot;I have no training; I could not do the classics. What I can do is myself. And I like best not to talk at all... I study the script, and then try to become the character. That is very mysterious, how that happens. I cannot explain it. There are so many mysteries in cinema, the way everything must interlock, that when you think of it all, you never want to make a film.&quot;

<text>Francisco Epigmenio Luna Kan (3 December 1925 – 23 November 2023) was a Mexican politician who served as the Governor of Yucatán from 1976 to 1982.

Luna Kan was born on 3 December 1925 in the town of in the municipality of Mérida. He earned his medical degree from the National Polytechnic Institute&#x27;s Higher School of Rural Medicine, writing his thesis on epidemiology and social characteristics of tubercular patients, before earning a master&#x27;s degree in health sciences. Luna Kan was a practicing doctor of medicine then taught as a Professor of Medicine before first obtaining political office, at first being overseer of the state&#x27;s rural medical system.

Luna Kan was the first person of pure Maya ancestry to govern the state since the Spanish conquest of Yucatán. (In the early 1920s, Felipe Carrillo Puerto, who was partly Maya, had been governor.) For centuries the political elite had been &quot;Criollos&quot; (Yucatecans of pure Spanish ancestry). It was widely said that party officials of Mexico&#x27;s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) took the unusual step of selecting a person of Maya descent as their candidate in 1975 because the opposition National Action Party (PAN) had been getting many votes in Yucatán, and PRI candidates had been getting a poor showing in the state&#x27;s predominantly Maya towns and villages. It was said that PAN got the majority of votes in the previous governor&#x27;s race, and the PRI managed to maintain control of the state only through fraud in counting votes.

After his term as governor Luna Kan resigned from the PRI and joined the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). He unsuccessfully ran as that party&#x27;s candidate for municipal president of Mérida in 1998. Francisco Luna Kan held a seat in the federal Chamber of Deputies as a PRD deputy for Yucatán.

Francisco Luna Kan died on 23 November 2023, at the age of 97.

<text>In employment law, constructive dismissal occurs when an employee resigns due to the employer creating a hostile work environment. This often serves as a tactic for employers to avoid payment of statutory severance pay and benefits. In essence, although the employee resigns, the resignation is not truly voluntary but rather a response to intolerable working conditions imposed by the employer. These conditions can include unreasonable work demands, harassment, or significant changes to the employment terms without the employee’s consent.

The legal implications of constructive dismissal vary across jurisdictions, but generally, it results in the termination of the employee&#x27;s obligations and grants them the right to pursue claims against the employer. Claims can arise from a single serious incident or a pattern of behaviour, and employees typically need to resign shortly after the intolerable conditions are imposed.

Guillermo Cabanellas explains that disguised dismissal occurs when the employer’s actions violate duties, forcing the employee to resign. This act, while not an explicit declaration of termination, effectively constitutes a dismissal.

== Overview ==
In the United States, there is no single federal or state law against constructive dismissal. However, it is recognized when intolerable working conditions violate employment legislation, such as the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Equal Pay Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and others. The burden of proof lies with the employee, who must demonstrate that the working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person in their position would feel compelled to resign. Canadian law also acknowledges constructive dismissal when an employer unilaterally changes the terms and conditions of employment to such an extent that the employee can consider the contract breached. This may include demotions, significant changes in job duties, or a hostile work environment. Employees must file a complaint within a specified period and may need to seek legal advice to pursue claims of constructive dismissal.

In all cases, the concept hinges on the employer&#x27;s failure to meet contractual obligations, leading the employee to resign. The resignation is treated as a termination by the employer, allowing the employee to seek legal remedies for wrongful dismissal.

==United States law==
In the United States, constructive discharge is a general term describing the involuntary resignation of an employee. There is no single federal or state law against constructive dismissal in general. From a legal standpoint, it occurs when an employee is forced to resign because of intolerable working conditions which violate employment legislation, such as:
* Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA)
* Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA)
* Change in schedules in order to force employee to quit (title 12)
* Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)
* Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA)
* Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA)
* Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII)
* Any state employment law
* An employer showing favoritism to another employee without reason or explanation

The burden of proof in constructive dismissal cases lies with the employee.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has provided a 3-part test to determine whether or not a constructive discharge has occurred: (1) a reasonable person in the complainant&#x27;s position would have found the working conditions intolerable; (2) conduct that constituted discrimination against the complainant created the intolerable working conditions; and (3) the complainant&#x27;s involuntary resignation resulted from the intolerable working conditions.

In California, the California Supreme Court defines constructive discharge as follows: &quot;in order to establish a constructive discharge, an employee must plead and prove, by the usual preponderance of the evidence standard, that the employer either intentionally created or knowingly permitted working conditions that were so intolerable or aggravated at the time of the employee&#x27;s resignation that a reasonable employer would realize that a reasonable person in the employee&#x27;s position would be compelled to resign.&quot;

==Canadian law==
Canadian courts recognize there are circumstances in which the employer, although not acting explicitly to terminate an individual&#x27;s employment, alters the employment relationship&#x27;s terms and conditions to such a degree that an employee is entitled to regard the employer&#x27;s conduct as a termination, and claim wrongful dismissal, just as if they had been let go without any notice or termination pay in lieu of notice.

Constructive dismissal arises from the failure of the employer to live up to the essential obligations of the employment relationship, regardless of whether the employee signed a written employment contract. Employment law implies into employment relationships a common-law set of terms and conditions applicable to all employees. For example, once agreed upon, wages are implicitly locked in by the common-law of contract as an essential term of the employment relationship. In this regard, it is a constructive dismissal if an employer fails to pay an employee.

An employer&#x27;s breach of the employment contract releases the employee from their obligation to perform under the contract, and thus allows them to treat themselves as dismissed without notice. 

=== Subject ===
Applying the following provisions in Part III of the &quot;Canada Labour Code&quot; to cases of constructive dismissal:

* unjust dismissal

* severance pay and
* individual terminations of employment

=== Interpretation ===

==== Constructive dismissals are covered under Part III of the Code ====
The unjust dismissal provisions in section 240 of the Code cover unjust constructive dismissals. They also cover unjust dismissals made by the open unambiguous action of the employer.

This issue was resolved conclusively in the Federal Court of Appeal decision in &quot;Srougi v. Lufthansa German Airlines&quot;, [1988] F.C.J. Nº 539. According to the &quot;Srougi&quot; decision, once it has been established that a constructive dismissal has occurred, there is no question that the unjust dismissal provisions apply.

The individual terminations of employment provisions may also apply in cases of constructive dismissal. This includes provisions in sections 230 to 234 of the Code, and the severance pay provisions in sections 235 to 237. 

Unfortunately, the characterization of a constructive dismissal is not always straightforward. 

==== Definition ====
The phrase &quot;constructive dismissal&quot; describes situations where the employer has not directly fired the employee. Rather the employer has:

* failed to comply with the contract of employment in a major respect
* unilaterally changed the terms of employment, or
* expressed a settled intention to do either thus forcing the employee to quit

Constructive dismissal is sometimes called &quot;disguised dismissal&quot; or &quot;quitting with cause&quot;. This is because it often occurs in situations where the employer offers the employee the alternative of:

* leaving, or
* submitting to a unilateral and substantial alteration of a fundamental term or condition of their employment

Whether or not there has been a constructive dismissal is based on an objective view of the employer&#x27;s conduct. It is not merely on how the employee perceives the situation.

It is the employer&#x27;s failure to meet its contractual obligations that distinguishes a constructive dismissal from an ordinary resignation. The seriousness of the employer&#x27;s failure as well as the amount of deliberation apparent in its actions are also important factors.

The employer&#x27;s action must be unilateral, which means the employer must do it without the consent of the employee. If it is not unilateral, the variation is not a constructive dismissal but merely an agreed change to the contract of employment.

If the employee clearly indicates non-acceptance of the new conditions of employment to the employer, there has been a constructive dismissal. However, this is only if the employee leaves within a reasonable period (usually short). By not resigning, the employee indicates he accepts the new conditions of employment.

There have been cases where courts have held that there has been a constructive dismissal even though the complainant remains in the employ of the employer. This includes, for example, cases where the employee:

* continues to work under the new conditions in order to mitigate damages, and
* either protests the new conditions explicitly or makes it clear that he still reserves the right to take legal action

In such cases, the employee cannot be said to have condoned or accepted the change in working conditions if the employee:

* formally commences legal proceedings in respect of the change while remaining in the employ of the employer, or
* does not formally initiate proceedings but simply attempts to negotiate the matter while remaining at work

A constructive dismissal takes place at the time the employer changes the terms and conditions of employment. In order to be admissible, the complainant must file the complaint within 90 days of that time as required by subsection 240(2) of the Code.

Exception: This does not apply if the complainant qualifies for extending their time to file under subsection 240(3) of the Code.

In cases of alleged unjust dismissal, a doubt may exist as to whether the complainant has been constructively dismissed. In these cases, the Labour Program shall proceed to assist the parties in reaching a settlement. If the parties do not reach a settlement within a reasonable time, the Labour Program, on the request of the complainant, will refer the complaint to the Canada Industrial Relations Board.

Complainants alleging constructive dismissal should be advised that they may wish to seek independent legal advice.

=== Examples ===
The following examples are of cases in which the courts have found that an employee has been constructively dismissed. The examples are not exhaustive and the results will vary with the facts of each case and with the terms of each employment contract.

==== Changes to the employment relationship ====
Typically, the first way to claim constructive dismissal involves an employer making substantial changes to the employment contract, such as:

# a demotion;
# altering the employee&#x27;s reporting structure, job description or working conditions;
# lowering an employee&#x27;s compensation;
# changing hours of work;
# imposing a suspension or leave of absence; and
# relocating the employee&#x27;s workplace.

In addition, failure on the part of an employer to provide employment standards (e.g. overtime pay, vacation pay, etc.), can result in a constructive dismissal.

Nevertheless, for an employee to have a successful case for constructive dismissal, the employer&#x27;s breach must be fundamental. What is &quot;fundamental&quot; depends on the circumstances, and not all changes to the employment relationship give rise to a constructive dismissal. For example, administrative, i.e. non-disciplinary, suspensions might not amount to a constructive dismissal if imposed in good faith and justified by legitimate business reasons (i.e. lack of work). As well, a small reduction in salary, in tough times, and administered rationally, might not be a constructive dismissal.

==== Toxic work environments ====
An employee may also be able to claim a constructive dismissal based on an employer&#x27;s conduct, rather than a change to a specific or implied term of the employment contract. Here, the second way to claim constructive dismissal examines whether the employer&#x27;s (or employee of the employer) course of conduct, or even a single incident, demonstrates an intention to no longer be bound by the written or implied employment contract. An example of this kind of constructive dismissal is a &quot;toxic work environment&quot;. In this regard, if a work environment is so poisoned that a reasonable person wouldn&#x27;t be expected to return, then constructive dismissal is likely.

A toxic work environment is classically defined as unjustified criticism as well as vague and unfounded accusations of poor performance, especially where authority and respect with co-workers had been seriously undermined and compromised. Another example of toxic work environment is where the employer fails to prevent workplace harassment.

==== Threads ====
In some cases, an employee&#x27;s decision to quit in response to threats of dismissal or demotion has been found to constitute a constructive dismissal. However, mere encouragement to resign will not necessarily be sufficient. Similarly, a constructive dismissal may occur when an unfair suspension or reduction in salary creates an intolerable situation for the employee.

==UK law==

In United Kingdom law, constructive dismissal is defined by the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 95(1)c:

 The circumstances in which an employee is entitled are defined in common law. The notion of constructive dismissal most often arises from a fundamental breach of the term of trust and confidence implied in all contracts of employment. In order to avoid such a breach &quot;[a]n employer must not, without reasonable or proper cause, conduct himself in a manner calculated or likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence between the employer and the employee.&quot; Whilst a breach can be of the implied term of trust and confidence, a fundamental breach of any of the express or implied terms of a contract of employment is sufficient. The examples given on this page for actions by an employer likely to constitute grounds for constructive dismissal under Canadian law also almost certainly hold true under English law.

The Department of Trade and Industry states:

Following constructive dismissal, a claim for unfair dismissal and/or wrongful dismissal may arise.

===Types of constructive dismissal===

Although they tend to blend into one in a tribunal, strictly there are two types of constructive dismissal: statutory and common law.

At common law the requirement is acceptance of a repudiatory breach, which means the employer has indicated it no longer considers itself bound by an essential term of the contract, e.g. the requirement to pay wages or the requirement not to destroy the mutual bond of trust and confidence. It does not matter if the employer did not mean to repudiate the contract.

Under statute the requirement is employer&#x27;s &quot;conduct&quot; allowing the employee to &quot;terminate with or without notice&quot;; as this can only happen with a repudiatory breach it amounts to the same thing.

===Relation to unfair dismissal===
A common mistake is to assume that constructive dismissal is exactly the same as unfair treatment of an employee – it can sometimes be that treatment that can be considered generally evenhanded nevertheless makes life so difficult that the employee is in essence forced to resign (e.g., a fair constructive dismissal might be a unilateral change of contract justified by a bigger benefit to the business than the inconvenience to the employee), but the Employment Appeal Tribunal doubts that it will be very often that the employer can breach ERA96 s98(4) whilst being fair.

A constructive dismissal occurs when the employer&#x27;s repudiatory breach causes the employee to accept that the contract has been terminated, by resigning. The fairness of it would have to be looked at separately under a statutory claim for unfair dismissal.

The problems for the employer are that constructive dismissal is a contractual claim, which can be made in a tribunal for up to £25,000 or in court without limit, and, by dismissing constructively, it by definition misses out on the correct procedure meaning that even if the reason was fair, the decision was probably not, and so an unfair dismissal usually arises, creating a statutory claim alongside the contractual claim.

The court can look behind the lack of, or different, stated reason given by the employee at the time of resignation to establish that a cover story was in fact a resignation caused by fundamental breach.

===Typical causes===
The person causing the dismissal does not need the authority to dismiss, as long as they acted in the course of employment.

====Grounds====
Constructive dismissal is typically caused by:-

*unilateral contract changes by the employer such as:
** deliberate cuts in pay or status (even temporary),
** persistent delayed wages,
** refusal of holiday,
** withdrawal of car,
** suspension without pay (or even on full pay),
** dramatic changes to duties, hours or location (beyond reasonable daily travelling distance), or
* breach of contract in the form of bullying, e.g.:
** ignoring complaints,
** persistent unwanted amorous advances,
** bullying and swearing,
** verbal abuse (typically referring to gender, size or incompetence),
** singling out for no pay rise,
** criticising in front of subordinates,
** lack of support (e.g. forcing to do two peoples&#x27; jobs),
** failure to notify a woman on maternity leave of a vacancy which she would have applied for if she had been made aware of it,
** refusal to confirm continuity on TUPE transfer,
** revealing secret complaints in a reference (even ones required by a regulator), or
*breaches such as:
** behaviour which is arbitrary, capricious, inequitable, intolerable or outside good industrial practice,
** conduct that undermined trust and confidence (i.e. offering an incentive to resign to avoid performance managing capability),
** refusal to look for an alternative role due to workplace stress,
** disproportionate disciplinary penalty,
** employer tricks employee into resigning.

=====Flexibility and mobility clauses=====
A flexibility clause does not allow the employer to change a type of job as it is implied that the flexibility is to operate within the original job.

A mobility clause is subject to the implied term of mutual trust which prevents the employer from sending an employee to the other side of the country without adequate notice or from doing anything which makes it impossible for the employee to keep his side of the bargain.

====Insufficient grounds====
There is no right to automatic pay rises. Nor is a smoking ban a breach.

===Compensation===
The employee&#x27;s conduct is irrelevant to liability, although it can affect quantum; in other words it cannot get the employer off the hook, but could reduce compensation if he helped bring about his own downfall.

===Timing===
The conduct by the employer could be:

* a one-off repudiatory or fundamental breach of contract,
* a series of acts or omissions which amount to a repudiatory or fundamental breach of contract, or
* a &#x27;last straw&#x27; act or omission which, although in itself not a repudiatory or fundamental breach of contract can when taken in the context of earlier breaches amount to conduct which is a repudiatory or fundamental breach of contract.

Note: unreasonable conduct will not suffice to establish constructive dismissal claim since a repudiatory or fundamental breach of contract must be established.

===Employee must resign quickly===
The employee has to resign within a reasonable time of the trigger, which is the one-off outrage or the last straw. The employee could work under protest while he or she finds a new job.

====Waiver====

If the employer alleges that the employee waived a breach by not resigning, each breach needs to be looked at to see if it was waived separately, but even if a breach was waived, the last straw revives it for the purpose of determining whether overall there was a repudiation.

====Affirmation====

If the employer alleges that the employee has affirmed a breach by not resigning, the employee could point out that no consideration was paid for it and so no contract change has been accepted. Acceptance of a replacement job would prove affirmation.

An employee who stays on for a year after refusing to sign a new contract does not necessarily accept it.

====Last straw====

The last straw does not have to be similar to the earlier string of events or even unreasonable or blameworthy – it need only be related to the obligation of trust and confidence and enough that when added to the earlier events the totality is a repudiation.

====Notice period====

Although the employer&#x27;s breach must be serious enough to entitle the employee to resign without notice, the employee is entitled to give notice if they prefer, so that they could enjoy the benefit of wages during the notice period.

To prevent the employer alleging that the resignation was caused by a job offer, the employee should resign first and then seek a new job during the notice period.

During the notice period, the employer could make the employee redundant or summarily dismiss them, if it has the grounds to do so fairly. Otherwise, the reason for termination will be resignation and not dismissal, since the employee cannot serve a counternotice.

== Spanish law ==
Disguised dismissal () in Spanish labour law is a mechanism through which employers indirectly force employees to resign, thereby evading legal responsibilities. Article 50 of the Workers&#x27; Statute provides a legal remedy for employees, allowing them to terminate their contract with the right to compensation.

=== Definition ===
Disguised dismissal, as defined by the &quot;Diccionario Panhispánico del Español Jurídico&quot;, refers to an employer&#x27;s covert act designed to compel a worker to terminate their employment voluntarily. This tactic is often used to avoid paying indemnities and legal benefits. The employer creates conditions so intolerable that the worker feels forced to dissolve the labor contract.

=== Legal framework ===
In Spain, disguised dismissal is addressed under Article 50 of the Workers&#x27; Statute. This article allows an employee to request termination of the employment relationship due to serious breaches by the employer. When justified, the employee is entitled to compensation equivalent to that of unfair dismissal and unemployment benefits, provided they have paid the requisite contributions. The specified causes for invoking Article 50 include:

* Substantial Changes in Working Conditions: Changes made without adhering to Article 41 that undermine the worker&#x27;s dignity.
* Non-payment or Delays in Salary: Continuous failure to pay the agreed salary on time.
* Other Serious Breaches: Any other significant violations of the employer&#x27;s obligations, excluding &quot;force majeure&quot;. This includes refusal to reintegrate the worker into previous conditions following a court ruling that declared the changes unjustified.

=== Judicial precedents ===
An example is the Judgment of the High Court of Justice of Andalusia, Ceuta and Melilla, Social Chamber, 2016. In this case, the plaintiff argued that their transfer from Seville to Alcobendas was a disguised dismissal. The court found that the transfer, given the worker&#x27;s age, personal and family circumstances, and the adverse economic conditions associated with the move, was a deliberate attempt by the employer to force the worker to resign.

=== Theoretical perspectives ===
Guillermo Cabanellas de Torres, in his &quot;Compendio de Derecho Laboral&quot;, elaborates on disguised dismissal. He explains that the employer, by violating legal and contractual duties, puts the employee in a position where continuing to work is untenable due to moral and economic damage. This act, while not an explicit declaration of termination, effectively constitutes a dismissal. The termination, though initiated by the worker, is actually caused by the employer&#x27;s unilateral and irregular actions.

<doc id="445835" wikidata="Q6141575" url="?curid=445835" title="USS Gudgeon (SS-211)">
<text>USS &quot;Gudgeon&quot; (SS-211) was the first American submarine to sink an enemy warship in World War II (Pacific, 27 January 1942). She was the last of the long-range &quot;Tambor&quot;-class vessels commissioned for the United States Navy in the years before the country entered World War II. Gudgeon scored 14 confirmed kills, placing her 15th on the honor roll of American submarines. She was declared overdue, presumed lost with all hands, on 7 June 1944. Of the twelve &quot;Tambor&quot;-class submarines, only five survived the war.

==Pre-war==
Her keel was laid down by the Mare Island Navy Yard. She was launched on 25 January 1941, sponsored by Mrs. Annie B. Pye, wife of Vice Admiral William S. Pye, Commander Battleships, Battle Force and Commander Battle Force. The boat was commissioned on 21 April 1941. Her construction cost $6 million.

After shakedown along the California coast, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; sailed north on 28 August, heading for Alaska via Seattle, Washington. On her northern jaunt the new submarine inspected Sitka, Kodiak, and Dutch Harbor for suitability as naval bases. Continuing to Hawaii, she moored at the Pearl Harbor submarine base on 10 October 1941. Training exercises and local operations filled &quot;Gudgeon&quot;’s time for the next two months.
During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December she was at Lahaina Roads on special exercises, but returned to base immediately.

==World War II==
===First war patrol===

On 11 December, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; (commanded by Elton W. &quot;Joe&quot; Grenfell) departed Pearl Harbor on the first American submarine war patrol of World War II. Her commanding officer was provided with explicit written orders to carry out unrestricted submarine warfare. &quot;Gudgeon&quot; made her first contact on a target in Japanese Home Waters 31 December. When she returned 50 days later, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; had contributed two more impressive &quot;firsts&quot; to the Pacific submarine fleet. She was the first American submarine to patrol along the Japanese coast itself, as her area took her off Kyūshū in the home islands. On 27 January 1942, &quot;en route&quot; home, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; became the first United States Navy submarine to sink an enemy warship in World War II. &quot;Gudgeon&quot; fired three torpedoes, and the submarine &quot;I-73&quot; was destroyed; though &quot;Gudgeon&quot; claimed only damage, the loss was confirmed by HYPO.

===Second and third patrols===

On her second war patrol, 22 February to 15 April 1942, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; scored two kills, first an unknown freighter on 26 March (not identified or confirmed by JANAC), then sinking the 6526-ton &quot;Nissho Maru&quot; on 27 March in the East China Sea southeast of Kumun Island.

She then checked into dry-dock for overhaul, but undocked three weeks early and readied for sea in a remarkable 40 hours to participate in the momentous Battle of Midway.

Departing Pearl Harbor on 18 May, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; took station off Midway Atoll as part of the submarine screen which encircled the two giant fleets clashing there. &quot;Gudgeon&quot; was prevented from offensive action by the confusion of battle, the possibility of mistaken identity, and poor staff work by Admiral Robert English, . She returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 June.

===Fourth patrol===

Departing for her fourth patrol 11 July, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; sank the 4853-ton transport &quot;Naniwa Maru&quot; in a night submerged attack off Truk on 3 August, her only kill of the patrol. In her other attack of the fourth patrol USS Gudgeon carried out an aggressive attack on a four-ship convoy 17 August, torpedoing and damaging the Japanese tankers &quot;Shinkoku Maru&quot; (10020 BRT) and &quot;Nichiei Maru&quot; (10020 BRT) northwest of Truk before the patrol ended at Fremantle, Australia, on 2 September.

===Fifth and sixth patrols===

Now a part of the Southwestern Pacific submarine forces, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; sank the 6783-ton &quot;Choko Maru&quot; west-northwest of Rabaul on 21 October during her fifth war patrol, 8 October to 1 December, and carried out a daring attack on a seven ship convoy on 11 November, torpedoing several ships but sinking none.

The submarine&#x27;s sixth war patrol, from 27 December 1942 to 18 February 1943, was unsuccessful in terms of ships sunk, but she carried out two special missions. On 14 January 1943 &quot;Gudgeon&quot; successfully landed six men on Catmon Point, Negros Island, Western Visayas, Philippines, to carry out the vital guerrilla resistance movement there. Returning from her patrol area, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; was diverted to Timor Island on 9 February, and the following day rescued 28 men—Australian, English, Portuguese, and Filipino—for passage to Fremantle. One of the Australians was 22 year old Alfred James Ellwood, Z special force.

===Seventh and eighth patrols===
&quot;Gudgeon&quot;″s seventh war patrol, from 13 March into April 1943, netted her two more Japanese ships before she ran out of torpedoes and had to return to Australia. On 22 March she sank the 5434-ton transport &quot;Meigen Maru&quot; as well as seriously damaging two other ships in the Java Sea convoy some 30 miles north of Surabaya, Java, Netherlands East Indies. Five days later &quot;Gudgeon&quot; took on 9987-ton tanker &quot;Tōhō Maru&quot; in a night surface attack in the Makassar Strait punctuated by bursts of gunfire as the Japanese ships spotted and fired on the submarine. It took five torpedoes to sink &quot;Tōhō Maru&quot;, and most of &quot;Gudgeon&quot;&#x27;s crew enjoyed the rare treat of watching her slide into the depths. Another attack later the same day damaged the 1192-ton tanker &quot;Kyoei Maru&quot;.

On her eighth war patrol, conducted as she sailed from Australia to Pearl Harbor on 15 April to 25 May 1943, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; chalked up three more kills. Her first came 28 April as she sank &quot;Kamakura Maru&quot;, a former ocean liner, southwest of Pucio Point, Panay (now Poblacion, Libertad, Antique), Philippines. The 17,526-ton transport was the largest Japanese transport, and one of the largest enemy ships sunk by an American submarine. Special operations interrupted &quot;Gudgeon&quot;&#x27;s patrol as she landed six trained guerrilla fighters and three tons of equipment for the guerrilla movement on Panay on 30 April.

After sinking the 500-ton trawler &quot;Naku Maru&quot; with her deck guns west of Panay 4 May, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; battle-surfaced again that same day and left a coastal steamer burning and settling. Eight days later, on 12 May, she torpedoed and sank the 5861-ton freighter &quot;Sumatra Maru&quot; off Bulusan, Luzon, Philippines. Returning to Pearl Harbor, the veteran submarine was sent to San Francisco, California, for badly needed overhaul, her first since commissioning two years earlier.

===Ninth and tenth patrols===

A refreshed sub and crew departed Pearl Harbor for their ninth war patrol 1 September 1943 in the Mariana Islands area. Before returning to Midway Island on 6 October with all torpedoes expended, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; had sunk the 3158-ton &quot;Taian Maru&quot;, torpedoed and damaged the 3266-ton auxiliary gunboat &quot;Santo Maru&quot; north of Saipan, as well as seriously damaging several other ships.

Heading along the China coast for her tenth war patrol, from 31 October to 11 December, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; chalked up two more marus. Early in the morning of 23 November she spotted a convoy of four ships in the East China Sea some 70 miles north of Shusan Island and closed for attack. &quot;Gudgeon&quot; fired a spread of six torpedoes with gratifying results. The 870-ton escort &quot;Wakamiya&quot;, hit by one torpedo, broke in two, sinking almost immediately. The two tankers in the convoy, the 5106-ton &quot;Ichiyo Maru&quot; and the 8469-ton &quot;Goyo Maru&quot;, were also hit but managed to escape. &quot;Gudgeon&quot; closed in to finish off the 6783-ton troop transport &quot;Nekka Maru&quot;.

===Eleventh patrol===

&quot;Gudgeon&quot;&#x27;s 11th war patrol saw a few successful sinkings of Japanese vessels, the first on 11 February. Before this sinking the submarine had a spell of bad luck where, on 2 February 1944, she had sighted a damaged aircraft carrier with two escorts. &quot;Gudgeon&quot; had closed for attack, but the escorts spotted her and attacked. A down-the-throat shot with four torpedoes temporarily discouraged the destroyers and allowed &quot;Gudgeon&quot; to seek deep water and safety, but when she surfaced the Japanese men-of-war were gone. Later in the same patrol &quot;Gudgeon&quot; was forced to try another down-the-throat shot at an enemy escort, but no hits. Success came only on 11 February. This date saw her torpedoing and sinking the already damaged (by Chinese air attack) 3091-ton merchant &quot;Satsuma Maru&quot; off Wenzhou, China. On 17 February &quot;Gudgeon&quot; sank a Japanese sampan with gunfire in the East China Sea, another sampan being damaged in the attack. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 5 March 1944.

===Twelfth patrol and loss===

&quot;Gudgeon&quot; sailed for her 12th war patrol on 4 April 1944. The submarine stopped off for fuel at Johnston Island on 7 April, and was never seen or heard from again. On 7 June 1944, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; was officially declared overdue and presumed lost. Uboat.net claims &quot;Gudgeon&quot; was sunk 18 April 1944 at a known location by the Japanese southeast of Iwo Jima. Some sources say the submarine was more likely to have sunk by attack near the Maug Islands.

==Tally and awards==
During her three-year career, &quot;Gudgeon&quot; scored 14 confirmed kills of a total of well over 71,372 tons sunk, placing her 15th on the honor roll of American submarines.

* Presidential Unit Citation for her first eight war patrols
* American Defense Service Medal with &quot;FLEET&quot; clasp
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with 11 battle stars
* World War II Victory Medal

==Legacy==
On 21 November 1952 the &quot;Tang class&quot; submarine USS &quot;Gudgeon&quot; (SS-567) was placed in commission. The second &quot;Gudgeon&quot; served in the United States Pacific Fleet until 30 September 1983 when she was transferred to the Turkish Navy and renamed TCG &quot;Hızırreis&quot; (S 342). TCG Hızırreis served until 2004, when she was decommissioned and became a museum ship.

<text>Briançon (, ) is the sole subprefecture of the Hautes-Alpes department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region in Southeastern France. It is the highest city in France at an altitude of , based on the national definition as a community containing more than 2,000 inhabitants. Its most recent population estimate is 11,084 (as of 2018) for the commune.

Briançon has been part of the Fortifications of Vauban UNESCO World Heritage Sites since they were established in 2008.

== History ==
Briançon was the &quot;Brigantium&quot; of the Romans and formed part of the kingdom of King Cottius. Brigantium was marked as the first place in Gallia after Alpis Cottia (Mont Genèvre). At Brigantium the road branched, to the west through Grenoble to &quot;Vienna&quot; (modern Vienne), on the Rhone; to the south through &quot;Ebrodunum&quot; (modern Embrun), to &quot;Vapincum&quot; (modern Gap). Both the Antonine Itinerary and the Table give the route from Brigantium to Vapincum. The Table places Brigantium 6 M.P. from Alpis Cottia. Strabo mentions the village Brigantium on a road to Alpis Cottia, but his words are obscure.

Ptolemy mentions Brigantium as within the limits of the Segusini, or people of &quot;Segusio&quot; (modern Susa), in Piedmont; but it seems, as D&#x27;Anville observes, to be beyond the natural limits of the Segusini. Walckenaer (vol. i. p. 540) justifies Ptolemy in this matter by supposing that he follows a description of Italy made before the new divisions of Augustus, which we know from Pliny. Walckenaer also supports his justification of Ptolemy by the Jerusalem Itinerary, which makes the Alpes Cottiae commence at Rama (near modern La Roche-de-Rame) between Embrun and Briançon.

In the 1040s it came into the hands of the counts of Albon and thenceforth shared the fate of the Dauphiné. The Briançonnais included not only the upper valley of the Durance (with those of its affluents, the Gyronde and the Guil) but also the valley of the Dora Riparia (Césanne, Oulx, Bardonnèche and Exilles) and that of the Chisone (Fénestrelles, Pérouse, Pragelas). The glens all lay on the eastern slope of the chain of the Alps. However the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) handed all of those valleys to Savoy in exchange for that of Barcelonnette, on the west slope of the Alps. In 1815 Briançon successfully withstood a siege of three months at the hands of the Allies, a feat commemorated by an inscription on one of its gates, &quot;Le passé répond de l&#x27;avenir&quot; (&quot;The past guarantees the future&quot;).

== Demographics ==
==Geography==

Briançon is located near the Italian border, in the Serre Chevalier ski area. It is built on a plateau centred on the confluence of the Durance and the Guisane rivers. Briançon station has rail connections to Gap, Marseille, Valence and Paris.

===Climate===

Due to its elevation, Briançon features a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen : &quot;Dfb&quot;), bordering on an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) under the Köppen system. Summers are warm with cool nights, and winters are cold and snowy.
== Sights ==

The historical centre is a strongly fortified town, built by Vauban to defend the region from Austrians in the 17th century. Its streets are very steep and narrow, though picturesque. Briançon lies at the foot of the descent from the Col de Montgenèvre, giving access to Turin, so a great number of other fortifications have been constructed on the surrounding heights, especially towards the east. The Fort Janus is no less than 1,200 m. above the town.

The parish church, with its two towers, was built 1703–1726, and occupies a very conspicuous position.

The Pont d&#x27;Asfeld, east of the town, was built in 1734, and forms an arch of 40 m span, thrown at a height of 56 m across the Durance.

The modern town extends in the plain at the southwest foot of the plateau on which the old town is built and forms the suburb of Ste Catherine.

Briançon is close to the Parc National des Ecrins and the Vallée de la Clarée.

On 8 July 2008, several buildings of Briançon were classified by the UNESCO as World Heritage Sites, as part of the &quot;Fortifications of Vauban&quot; group. These buildings are: the city walls, Redoute des Salettes, Fort des Trois-Têtes, Fort du Randouillet, &quot;ouvrage de la communication Y&quot; and the Asfeld Bridge. Along with Briançon, 11 other sites of fortified buildings in France were classified. Among them is the &quot;place-forte&quot; of Mont-Dauphin, also in the Hautes-Alpes department. These pieces of art were designed by Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban (1633–1707), a military engineer of King Louis XIV.

== Sport ==

=== Cycling ===
Briançon has often hosted starts and finishes of stages of the Tour de France, Giro d&#x27;Italia and Dauphiné Libéré. In 2017 stage 18 of the Tour de France started here.

As Briançon has regularly featured as a stage town in the Tour de France, it is a popular base for cyclists. Since 1947, the town has been the start point for a stage of the Tour 22 times, and has also been a stage finish 22 times.

In 2007, the town was the finish of the stage 9 on 17 July from Val-d&#x27;Isère crossing the Col de l&#x27;Iseran, the Col du Télégraphe and the Col du Galibier with a downhill finish to Briançon.

=== Ice hockey ===
The Diables Rouges de Briançon play in the Ligue Magnus, the French top league.

=== Kayaking ===
Briançon is situated around the confluence of the Durance river and its tributary the Guisane which are fed with snow melt in the Spring. Tourists come from around Europe to kayak and raft on the resultant whitewater rivers and their tributaries, including the Onde, the Gyronde, the Guil, the Rabioux, the Ubaye and others; often basing themselves in Briançon.
Popular white water rivers in the Alps are mainly medium volume glacier-fed rivers with long continuous rapids and few big drops. The season is short (two or three months in early summer when the snow and glaciers are melting) but the whitewater is reliable during this period.

=== Skiing ===
Briançon is the base and lowest altitude station of the large Serre Chevalier ski resort. Most of the city&#x27;s accommodation is used exclusively in winter, the population tripling during that period.

<text>The governor of the State of Yucatan is the head of the executive branch of the Mexican state of Yucatán, elected to a six-year-term and not eligible for reelection.
The figure of the governor is established on the Constitution of the State of Yucatan on its Title Fifth. The term of the Governor begins on October 1 of the year of the election and finishes September 30, six years later.

The same constitution empowers those individuals to be elected governor who have held the title of executive power but in a different way to the popular election, namely the interim, or temporary replacements. The latter has caused controversies and political conflicts, because in the view of several instances is in conflict with a precept of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States that stipulates that no state governor may hold power for more than six years.

== List of governors of Yucatan ==
The state of Yucatán was created on January 31, 1824, being one of the original states of the federation, which along their history has passed through all the systems of government in place in Mexico: the federal system as the central system, so that the name of the entity has varied between state and department; varying with it, the name of the holder of the executive branch of the State.

<text>Jean-Jacques Annaud (; born 1 October 1943) is a French film director, screenwriter and producer. He directed &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; (1981), &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (1986), &quot;The Bear&quot; (1988), &quot;The Lover&quot; (1992), &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; (1997), &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; (2001), &quot;Black Gold&quot; (2011), and &quot;Wolf Totem&quot; (2015).

Annaud has received numerous awards for his work, including five César Awards, one David di Donatello Award, and one National Academy of Cinema Award. Annaud&#x27;s first film, &quot;Black and White in Color&quot; (1976), received an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

His most recent film is &quot;Notre-Dame on Fire,&quot; released in 2022.
==Early life==
Jean-Jacques Annaud was born on 1 October 1943 in Draveil, Juvisy-sur-Orge, Essonne, in France. He was educated at the technical school in Vaugirard, and in 1964 graduated from the prestigious film school Institut des Hautes Études Cinématographiques (IDHEC) in Paris.

==Career==
Annaud began his career by directing television advertisements in the late 1960s to early 1970s. In his first feature film, &quot;Black and White in Color&quot; (1976), he drew on his personal experience of military service in Cameroon. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. His third film, 1981&#x27;s &quot;Quest for Fire&quot; (&quot;La Guerre du feu&quot;), received two Césars for best film and best director.

After &quot;Hothead&quot; (1979), a French-language film that became a cult classic in his homeland, he moved to Kenya, Scotland and Canada to shoot &quot;Quest for Fire&quot;, which brought him international recognition. He subsequently won a César – French National Award – for Best Film &amp; for Best Director. He then directed Sean Connery in &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (1986), which was shot in Italian and German monasteries (César for Best Foreign Film and David Di Donatello for Best Director), and is based on Umberto Eco&#x27;s popular novel of the same name. The film version, with a screenplay by Andrew Birkin, won two BAFTA Film Awards and was the subject of another 14 wins and two nominations. Annaud spent four years preparing for the film, traveling throughout the United States and Europe, searching for the cast and film set locations. He supposedly felt personally intrigued by the project, among other things because of a lifelong fascination with medieval churches and familiarity with Latin and Greek.&quot;&quot;

He then adapted &quot;The Bear&quot; P.O.V. (César for Best Director, 1988) in the heart of select locations of the Dolomites, Germany, Canada and Austria. He then shot in Vietnam the adaptation of Marguerite Duras&#x27;s autobiographical novel, &quot;The Lover&quot; (1992), recreating the atmosphere of colonial Indochina. He then set back out to the Canadian Rockies and directed &quot;Wings of Courage&quot;, the first 3D fiction film ever made in Imax-3D (1995). In 2000 he wrote and produced &quot;Running Free&quot;, directed by Sergei Bodrov.

Annaud also worked with Brad Pitt when he directed &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; (1997), shot in Argentina, Canada, Tibet, Nepal and Tyrol. In 2001, Annaud reunited Jude Law and Ed Harris in a retelling of the Battle of Stalingrad (&quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot;, 2001), filmed in Germany. Soon after, Annaud flew to the ruins of the temples of Angkor and filmed &quot;Two Brothers&quot; (2004), shot in Cambodia, Thailand and France. He then set out to revive ancient Greece (&quot;His Majesty Minor&quot;, 2007), shot entirely in Spain, then Arabia of the late 1930s, directing Antonio Banderas in Tunisia and Qatar in &quot;Black Gold&quot; (2011). In 2015, Annaud adapted &quot;Wolf Totem&quot;, a Chinese literary phenomenon entirely shot in Inner Mongolia. The film won the People&#x27;s Hundred Flowers Award and Golden Rooster in China and a dozen other trophies around the world.

Annaud signed a petition in support of film director Roman Polanski in 2009, calling for his release after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland in relation to his 1977 charge for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl.

In 2018, Annaud directed Patrick Dempsey in his 10-part television adaptation of Joël Dicker&#x27;s best-seller &quot;The Truth about the Harry Quebert Affair&quot; (2018); it was released in 22 countries and shot in Canada.

<doc id="445844" wikidata="Q5326264" url="?curid=445844" title="Earl of Dundee">
<text>Earl of Dundee is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1660 for John Scrymgeour, 3rd Viscount Dudhope. At his death in 1668, the Duke of Lauderdale declared that the first Earl had no heirs-male, and had the crown seize all of his lands. The earldom of Dundee became dormant and its holdings and offices were granted to Charles Maitland, 3rd Earl of Lauderdale, the Duke&#x27;s younger brother. The title was revived in 1953, when it was determined that the first Earl did indeed have heirs-male, contrary to the assertion of the crown. The title was given to Henry James Scrymgeour-Wedderburn, who had previously served in the House of Commons and in the Cabinet.

The Earl of Dundee holds the subsidiary titles: &quot;Viscount of Dudhope&quot; and &quot;Lord Scrymgeour&quot;, both created 1641 during the Bishops&#x27; Wars, when King Charles I was visiting Edinburgh. On the Restoration of Charles II, Lord Dundee received the additional title &quot;Lord Innerkeithing&quot; (created 1660). In 1954, the 11th Earl was created &quot;Baron Glassary of Glassary, Argyll&quot;. The first three titles are in the Peerage of Scotland and the Barony of Glassary is in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The eldest son and heir of the earl is addressed by a courtesy title as Lord Scrymgeour.

The family seat is Birkhill near Cupar, Fife.

==History==
In 1107 Sir Alexander Carron, nicknamed &quot;Schyrmeschur&quot; (&quot;The Swordsman&quot;) for his deeds against the northern rebels, was granted the arms and name of Schyrmeschur by King Alexander I. He was also granted the office of Hereditary Royal Standard-Bearer of Scotland. This gave him the right to bear the Royal Banner in front of the monarch in procession or before the Army of Scotland in times of war. In 1298 Sir Alexander Schyrmeschur was awarded the office of Constable of Dundee.

==Royal Standard Bearer of Scotland (1107)==
In 1107 Sir Alexander Schyrmeschur was given the hereditary honor of carrying the Royal Standard. In 1676, Charles II granted Charles Maitland, Lord Haltoun &quot;the office of bearing our insignia within our said realm of Scotland&quot; by a charter of novodamus. After Lauderdale&#x27;s death in 1691, the office of Standard-Bearer was not claimed by anyone until 1820, when Henry Scrymgeour-Wedderburn claimed the right to act as such an officer at the coronation of George IV. The Privy Council did not grant Scrymgeour-Wedderburn the authority to appear at the coronation (which was granted to the 8th Earl of Lauderdale). However, it did confirm his possession of the office of Standard-Bearer (which he exercised at Holyrood House in 1822). This was successfully confirmed by Henry Scrymgeour, de jure 10th Earl of Dundee, in 1902. In 1952, the Lord Lyon advised that the Earl of Lauderdale&#x27;s right was to bear the saltire as the Bearer of the National Flag of Scotland, whereas the Earl of Dundee bears the &quot;lion rampant&quot; as the Hereditary Royal Standard Bearer for Scotland he has administered at all recent coronations.

==Constable of Dundee (1298, 1324)==
Sir Alexander Schyrmeschur, Hereditary Royal Standard Bearer, served as Standard Bearer for the army of Sir William Wallace, the Guardian of the Kingdom of Scotland. As a reward for his gallant service he was granted the title of Constable of Dundee Castle as well as a grant of the nearby manor of Upper Dudhope. This title was originally granted as a lifetime honor but it was made hereditary by a Royal Charter granted by Robert I to his son Nicolas in 1324. It was declared dormant upon the death of John Scrymgeour, 1st Earl of Dundee and 13th Constable of Dundee, in 1668.

<doc id="445846" wikidata="Q1056421" url="?curid=445846" title="Sütterlin">
<text> (, &quot; script&quot;) is the last widely used form of , the historical form of German handwriting script that evolved alongside German blackletter (most notably &#x27;) typefaces. Graphic artist [[Ludwig Sütterlin]] was commissioned by the [[Prussia]]n Ministry of Science, Art and Culture (&#x27;) to create a modern handwriting script in 1911. His handwriting scheme gradually replaced the older cursive scripts that had developed in the 16th century at the same time that letters in books had developed into Fraktur. The name &quot;&quot; is nowadays often used to refer to several similar varieties of old German handwriting, but Sütterlin&#x27;s own script was taught only from 1915 to 1941 in all German schools.

==History==
The ministry had asked for &quot;modern&quot; handwriting scripts to be used in offices and to be taught in school. Sütterlin created two scripts in parallel with the two typefaces that were in use (see Antiqua–Fraktur dispute). The scripts were introduced in Prussia in 1915 and from the 1920s onwards they began to replace the relatively similar old German handwriting () in schools. In 1935 the style officially became the only German script taught in schools.

The Nazi Party banned all &quot;broken&quot; blackletter typefaces in 1941, which were seen as chaotic, including , and replaced them with Latin-type letters such as Antiqua. However many German speakers who had been brought up with that writing system continued to use it well into the postwar period.

 continued to be taught in some German schools until the 1970s but no longer as the primary script.

==Characteristics==
 is based on older German handwriting, which is a handwriting form of the Blackletter scripts such as and , the German print scripts used at the same time.

It includes the long s (ſ) as well as several standard ligatures such as (f-f), (ſ-t), (s-t), and ß (ſ-z or ſ-s).

Because of their distinctiveness, letters can be used on the blackboard for certain mathematical symbols that are represented by letters in print. The lower-case d in and is used in proofreading for &quot;&quot; (&quot;let it be deleted&quot;).

The Sütterlin lower-case &#x27;e&#x27; contains two vertical bars close together, in which the origin of the umlaut diacritic (¨) from a small &#x27;e&#x27; written above the modified vowel can be seen.

== Overview of the letters ==

(There are two lower-case forms of the letter &quot;s&quot;. The second one is used at the end of a syllable.)

<doc id="445851" wikidata="Q5326192" url="?curid=445851" title="Earl of Annandale and Hartfell">
<text>Earl of Annandale and Hartfell is a title in the Peerage of Scotland, created in 1661 for James Johnstone.

In 1625, the title of Earl of Annandale had been created for John Murray, but it became extinct when his son James died without heirs.

James Johnstone, son of Sir James Johnstone, Warden of the West Marches, was created Lord Johnstone of Lochwood in 1633, and in 1643, was further created Earl of Hartfell. Johnstone&#x27;s son, also James, resigned the earldom and received a regrant of the title, as Earl of Annandale and Hartfell, in 1661, and a further regrant of the same title, but by crown charter, in 1662 to his heirs male of the body, whom failing, his heirs female of the body. William, the second Earl of Annandale and Hartfell, was created &quot;Marquess of Annandale&quot; in 1701. At the death of the third marquess, no one could prove a claim to the peerages of either earldoms and therefore they became dormant.

The earldoms remained dormant until Patrick Hope-Johnstone&#x27;s claim was approved by the House of Lords in 1985. The Committee for Privileges ruled that Charles II&#x27;s 1662 charter of regrant of lands constituted the creation of a new title. The title therefore descended through the female line in the person of Lady Henrietta Johnstone (who married Charles the First Earl of Hopetoun) to Patrick Hope-Johnstone.

The current earl holds the subsidiary title of &quot;Lord Johnstone (1662)&quot;, in the peerage of Scotland.

The family seat is Raehills, near Lockerbie, Dumfriesshire.

<doc id="445852" wikidata="Q5528402" url="?curid=445852" title="Gavyn Davies">
<text>Gavyn Davies, (born 27 November 1950) is a former Goldman Sachs partner who was the chairman of the BBC from 2001 until 2004. On 28 January 2004 he announced that he was resigning his BBC post following the publication of the Hutton Inquiry report which heavily criticised the organisation.

==Early life and business career==

Davies was born in Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, where his father was head teacher at what was then its only black high school. The family moved to the UK in 1961 where he was educated at Taunton&#x27;s School, Southampton, St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge and Balliol College, Oxford, where he conducted research. He worked in Harold Wilson&#x27;s Policy Unit from 1974 to 1976 and then as an economic advisor to James Callaghan from 1976 to 1979. Afterwards he had stints as Chief Economist at &quot;Simon &amp; Coates&quot; and Goldman Sachs. He was later promoted to international managing director of the bank. During this time he also served as one of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x27;s &quot;wise men&quot; during the 1992–1997 Parliament.

==BBC inquiry and board membership==
In 1999 he chaired an inquiry into the future funding of the BBC. His suggestions – to sell off a portion of BBC Worldwide (the corporation&#x27;s commercial wing) and to raise the television licence fee by around 20% in order to fund new digital channels – were swiftly rejected by the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee.

In January 2001, he was appointed vice-chairman of the BBC Board of Governors. He was promoted to chairman just 10 months later for a five-year term after being recommended by Tessa Jowell. Upon becoming chairman, Davies resigned his membership of the Labour Party. In January 2004, he resigned from the board after the publication of the Hutton Inquiry which heavily criticised the BBC&#x27;s news reporting, for which Davies had pledged support. In his resignation statement he said he was &quot;happy to accept ... ultimate responsibility&quot; for everything the BBC does. However, he raised questions about the conclusions of Lord Hutton, including the question of the use of unverifiable sources and possible threats to the freedom of the press.

Davies has in the past donated part of his wealth to the Labour Party, of which he had been a long-term supporter. His appointment as BBC chairman sparked allegations of cronyism from Opposition political parties – Davies&#x27; wife Sue Nye was a private secretary of Prime Minister Gordon Brown and the pair are known to be good friends. Defenders of the appointment pointed out that Davies had been selected by a panel independent of Government. It has been suggested that the behaviour of Davies and Greg Dyke during the David Kelly affair was in part due to a wish to demonstrate their independence of government. After his resignation, he became somewhat of a critic of the then Labour government.

==Later career==
In 2005, he set up a $1.35 Billion hedge fund to invest in macroeconomic situations. He also wrote a weekly column on mathematics and statistics, &quot;Gavyn Davies does the maths&quot;, for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Since August 2010 he has written a blog on macroeconomics for &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

He is a founding partner of Active Private Equity, Anthos Capital, and Prisma Capital Partners, as well as Chairman of Fulcrum Asset Management.

==Personal life==
Davies and his wife live in Wandsworth, having moved there to give their daughter the opportunity to attend a better school. They also have two sons and a further home in Croyde, Devon.

<doc id="445854" wikidata="Q440433" url="?curid=445854" title="Elroy Hirsch">
<text>Elroy Leon &quot;Crazylegs&quot; Hirsch (June 17, 1923 – January 28, 2004) was an American professional football player, sport executive and actor. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1974. He was also named to the all-time All-Pro team selected in 1968 and to the National Football League (NFL) 1950s All-Decade Team.

A native of Wausau, Wisconsin, Hirsch played college football as a halfback at the University of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan, helping to lead both the 1942 Badgers and the 1943 Wolverines to No. 3 rankings in the final AP Polls. He received the nickname &quot;Crazylegs&quot; (sometimes &quot;Crazy Legs&quot;) for his unusual running style.

Hirsch served in the United States Marine Corps from 1944 to 1946 and then played professional football in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) for the Chicago Rockets from 1946 to 1948 and in the NFL for the Los Angeles Rams from 1949 to 1957. During the 1951 season, Hirsch helped lead the Rams to the NFL championship and tied or broke multiple NFL records with 1,495 receiving yards, an average of 124.6 receiving yards per game (still the third-highest season average in NFL history), and 17 touchdown receptions.

Hirsch had a brief career as a motion picture actor in the 1950s and served as the general manager for the Rams from 1960 to 1969 and as the athletic director for the University of Wisconsin from 1969 to 1987.

==Early life==
Hirsch was born in Wausau, Wisconsin in 1923. He was the adopted son of German-Norwegian parents, Otto and Mayme Hirsch. His father was a foreman in an iron works.

Hirsch was a star football player at Wausau High School in 1939 and 1940. He also played baseball and basketball in high school.

==College football==

===Wisconsin===
Hirsch enrolled at the University of Wisconsin in the fall of 1941 and played on the school&#x27;s freshman football team. As a sophomore, Hirsch starred as a halfback for the 1942 Wisconsin Badgers football team that compiled an 8–1–1 record, defeated reigning national champion Ohio State (17–7), lost only one game to Iowa (0–6), tied with Notre Dame (7–7), and was ranked No. 3 in the final AP Poll. At the end of the season, Hirsch was selected by the Associated Press (AP) as a first-team halfback on the 1942 All-Big Ten Conference football team. In the three years prior to 1942, Wisconsin&#x27;s football team had gone 8–15–1, and the program had been in decline since 1932. During the 1942 season, Hirsch&#x27;s only season with the Wisconsin football team, he was a triple-threat man who totaled 767 rushing yards on 141 carries, completed 18 passes for 226 yards, punted four times for an average of 48.8 yards, intercepted six passes, and returned 15 punts for 182 yards. He rushed for a high of 174 yards against Missouri.

===The nickname===
Hirsch acquired the &quot;Crazylegs&quot; nickname because of his unusual running style in which his legs twisted as he ran. According to one version, after watching Hirsch play in an October 17, 1942, game against the Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets, sportswriter Francis J. Powers of &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; wrote: &quot;His crazy legs were gyrating in six different directions, all at the same time; he looked like a demented duck.&quot; According to another version, he acquired the nickname in high school when fans in Wausau watched &quot;the tall, slim Hirsch&quot; run as &quot;his legs seemed to whirl in several directions.&quot;

Hirsch&#x27;s father later recalled: &quot;We lived two miles from school. Elroy ran to school and back, skipping and crisscrossing his legs in the cement blocks of the sidewalks. He said it would make him shiftier.&quot; Hirsch himself recalled: &quot;I&#x27;ve always run kind of funny because my left foot points out to the side and I seem to wobble.&quot; He embraced his nickname, saying in interviews, &quot;Anything&#x27;s better than &#x27;Elroy&#x27;.&quot;

In the 1970s, Hirsch filed a lawsuit asserting legal ownership of the &quot;Crazylegs&quot; name. He sued S. C. Johnson &amp; Son for its marketing a shaving gel for women&#x27;s legs under the brand name &quot;Crazylegs&quot;. In a 1997 decision, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that Hirsch&#x27;s complaint set forth a viable claim for invasion of Hirsch&#x27;s common law right of privacy.

===Michigan===

In January 1943, Hirsch enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and was transferred to the University of Michigan as part of the V-12 Navy College Training Program. In early September 1943, he broke the record at Michigan&#x27;s Marine Corps training center, completing a 344-yard obstacle course in one minute and 31 seconds. He was the starting left halfback in the first seven games of the season for Fritz Crisler&#x27;s 1943 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled an 8–1 record and was ranked No. 3 in the final AP Poll. After watching Hirsch in pre-season practice, Associated Press football writer Jerry Liska referred to &quot;squirming Elroy Hirsch&quot; as &quot;Wisconsin&#x27;s gold-plated wartime gift to Michigan.&quot; Hirsch and Bill Daley (a V-12 transfer from Minnesota) became Michigan&#x27;s most powerful offensive weapons during the 1943 season and were dubbed Michigan&#x27;s &quot;lend-lease backs.&quot;

In his first game for Michigan, Hirsch returned the opening kickoff 50 yards, scored two touchdowns and intercepted a pass. He scored five touchdowns in Michigan&#x27;s first three games and threw for a touchdown in the fourth game against Notre Dame. On October 11, 1943, Hirsch scored three touchdowns, including a 61-yard reverse around the right end, and intercepted a pass to help Michigan to its first victory over Minnesota since 1932. Due to a shoulder injury, he appeared only briefly as a backup to kick for extra points in the final two games of the season, but he still led the Wolverines in passing, punt returns, and scoring.

During the 1943–1944 academic year, Hirsch also won varsity letters in basketball (as a center), track (as a broad jumper), and baseball (as a pitcher), becoming the first Michigan athlete to letter in four sports in a single year. He averaged 7.3 points per game for the 1943–44 Michigan Wolverines men&#x27;s basketball team, compiled a 6–0 record as a pitcher for the Michigan baseball team, placed third in the long jump in the 1944 indoor championship, and led all three teams to Big Ten Conference championships. On May 13, 1944, Hirsch starred in two sports in the same day, winning the broad jump with a distance of 24 feet, inches at a track meet in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and then traveling to Columbus, Ohio, where he pitched a one-hitter to give Michigan&#x27;s baseball team a 5–0 victory over Ohio State.

==Marine Corps==
In June 1944, Hirsch and 23 other Michigan athletes were transferred to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot at Parris Island, South Carolina. In the fall of 1944, Hirsch was assigned to Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune where he played for the base football team. In the spring of 1945, he was stationed at Marine Corps Base Quantico in Virginia. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in May 1945.

Hirsch remained with the Marine Corps in the fall of 1945 and played for the Marine Corps football team at the Marine Corps Air Station El Toro in California. In September 1945, he scored four touchdowns for the El Toro Flying Marines in a game against the Los Angeles Bulldogs.

==Professional football career==

===College All-Stars===
Hirsch was discharged from the military in May 1946. On August 23, 1946, he led the college all-star team to a 16–0 victory over the NFL champion Los Angeles Rams in the Chicago College All-Star Game. Hirsch was named the game&#x27;s outstanding player, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described his performance in the game as a &quot;one-man show&quot; after he scored the game&#x27;s only touchdowns, including a 68-yard touchdown sprint, for the college squad. Hirsch later described the game as his greatest athletic thrill.

===Chicago Rockets===

In January 1945, the Cleveland Rams selected Hirsch in the first round (fifth overall pick) of the 1945 NFL draft. In May, he announced that he would not sign a contract with the Rams, stating that he intended to return to the University of Wisconsin after his discharge from the military.

He ultimately opted not to play in the NFL, instead playing for the Chicago Rockets of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Hirsch chose the Rockets because they were coached by Dick Hanley, who had been Hirsch&#x27;s coach with the El Toro Marines team. Hirsch played three seasons with the Rockets from 1946 to 1948. During those three years, the Rockets compiled a 7–32 record and won only one game in each of the 1947 and 1948 seasons. Hirsch later said the decision to sign with the Rockets was the worst decision he ever made.

In a remarkable display of versatility, Hirsch appeared in all 14 games for the Rockets in 1946, contributing 1,445 yards: 384 kickoff return yards and one touchdown; 347 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns; 235 punt return yards and one touchdown; 226 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown; 156 passing yards and one passing touchdown; and 97 return yards on six interceptions.

In September 1947, Hirsch caught a 76-yard touchdown pass for an AAFC record. However, injuries limited Hirsch to five games in 1947. He was described in December 1947 as probably &quot;the highest paid waterboy in pro football.&quot;

In the fifth game of the 1948 season, Hirsch sustained a fracture on the right side of his skull after being kicked in the head during a game against the Cleveland Browns. Hirsch did not return to action during the 1948 season, totaling 101 receiving yards and 93 rushing yards in five games.

===Los Angeles Rams===
In June 1949, Hirsch alleged that the Hornets (the Chicago Rockets were renamed the Hornets in 1949) had breached a contractual obligation to pay him a bonus and sought a release to allow him to play for the Green Bay Packers. However, the Los Angeles Rams held Hirsch&#x27;s NFL rights having selected him in the 1945 NFL Draft, and Hirsch was therefore unable to sign with the Packers. Instead, he signed with the Rams in July 1949. Hirsch earned $20,000 a year from the Rams, following a bidding war with the Hornets. However, after the 1949 season, the AAFC folded, and the Rams reduced his salary with the competition from the AAFC gone. During his career with the Rams, Hirsch never again attained the salary level he was paid as a rookie.

Rams head coach Clark Shaughnessy played Hirsch at the end position. In his first game for the Rams, a 27–24 victory over the Detroit Lions, Hirsch scored two touchdowns, including a 19-yard touchdown reception from Norm Van Brocklin. Over the course of the 1949 season, Hirsch tallied 326 receiving yards, 287 rushing yards, and 55 return yards on two interceptions. During the 1949 season, Hirsch also became one of the first NFL players to wear a plastic helmet. After Hirsch sustained a second head injury (having previously suffered a skull fracture in 1948), Rams coach Shaughnessy had a special, 11-ounce helmet designed for Hirsch, using a strong, light plastic that had been used previously in the construction of fighter planes.
In the opening game of the 1951 season, Norm Van Brocklin passed for an NFL record 554 yards, including 173 yards and four touchdown passes to Hirsch. During the season, Hirsch, Van Brocklin, Bob Waterfield, and Tom Fears (all four of whom have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame) led the Rams to an 8–4 record and a victory over the Cleveland Browns in the 1951 NFL Championship Game. Easily the best year of his career, Hirsch tied or broke multiple NFL receiving records in 1951. These records include:
* Hirsch set a new NFL record with 1,495 receiving yards. Despite the fact that the NFL season consisted of only 12 games in 1951, Hirsch&#x27;s single-season receiving record stood for nearly 20 years, until the merger of the AFL and the NFL. 
* Hirsch&#x27;s average of 124.6 receiving yards per game also set a new NFL record. Through the end of the 2015 NFL season, only two players have exceeded this record. 
* Hirsch also had 17 touchdown receptions in 1951, tying an NFL record set by Don Hutson in 1942. Despite the expansion of the NFL schedule to 16 games, the Hirsch/Hutson mark of 17 touchdown catches lasted until the 1980s, and only four players through the end of the 2015 NFL season have exceeded the mark. 
* On his 17 touchdown catches, Hirsch averaged 51.2 yards, including a 91-yard reception that was the longest of the year in the NFL. For this reason, Bob Oates of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that, even in the era of Jerry Rice, Hirsch &quot;remains the greatest long-distance receiving threat of all time.&quot;
* Hirsch&#x27;s 66 receptions also led the NFL in 1951 and was the fifth highest total in NFL history to that date.

After the 1951 season, Hirsch finished second behind Otto Graham in voting conducted by the United Press (UP) for the NFL Player of the Year award. He was also selected as a first-team All-Pro player by both the Associated Press (AP) and the UP. He was also selected to play in the Pro Bowl each year from 1951 to 1953. Hirsch had another strong season in 1953, leading the NFL with a career-high average of 23.6 yards per reception. He also finished second in the NFL with 941 receiving yards in 1953 and was selected as a first-team All-Pro by the AP and a second-team All-Pro by the UP.

Hirsch continued to play for the Rams through the 1957 season. He announced his retirement as a player at age 34 in January 1958. In nine years with the Rams, Hirsch totaled 343 receptions for 6,299 yards and 53 touchdowns. He also gained 317 rushing yards with the Rams.

==Television, radio, and movie career==

After retiring from football, Hirsch accepted a job with Union Oil to replace Bob Richards as the sports director of Union Oil Co.&#x27;s &quot;76 Sports Club&quot; and the host of its Thursday evening sports television show. He also hosted a daily sports commentary show on KNX radio from 1961 to 1967.

During the 1950s, Hirsch also starred in several motion pictures, including the following:

* &quot;Crazylegs&quot;, a motion picture released in November 1953 focusing on Hirsch&#x27;s life as a football player at Wausau High School and the Universities of Wisconsin and Michigan. Hirsch played himself as the lead in the film. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; movie critic John L. Scott wrote of Hirsch&#x27;s performance: &quot;Hirsch as an actor is both likable and believable. He does very well in his first film assignment.&quot; Hirsch&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Crazylegs&quot; has been credited with expanding his fame beyond sports fans and making him &quot;a star in the eyes of the general public.&quot;
* &quot;Unchained&quot;, a prison drama released in July 1955 and shot at a correctional facility in Chino, California. Hirsch played the lead as a prisoner in a prison without bars or armed guards. In the film, Hirsch&#x27;s character planned an escape but changed his mind due to the influence of another prisoner. The film is notable for introducing its theme song, &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; which was sung by Todd Duncan.
* &quot;Zero Hour!&quot;, an airline disaster movie released in November 1957. Hirsch played the role of the pilot who became incapacitated (along with the co-pilot and many passengers) after eating tainted fish served as part of the flight&#x27;s meal service. &quot;Zero Hour!&quot; was later used as the basis (including much of the original dialogue) for the Zucker brothers&#x27; parody film &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar playing the co-pilot.

Hirsch also appeared as himself in a 1956 episode of the &quot;Captain Midnight&quot; television series in a spot advertising Ovaltine milk flavoring. He was also featured in 1965 in episode 29 of &quot;The Munsters&quot; television show, entitled &quot;Herman the Rookie.&quot; In his appearance, he is seen on the street discussing the Rams&#x27; need for a punter when a football kicked by Herman hits him in the face.

==Administrative career==

===Los Angeles Rams===
In March 1960, Hirsch signed a three-year contract to serve as the general manager of the Los Angeles Rams; he replaced Pete Rozelle as the Rams&#x27; general manager after Rozelle was hired as NFL commissioner. The Rams began the 1960s in the lower tier of the NFL, compiling a losing record each year from 1959 to 1965. As general manager, he was in charge of scouting, the college draft, and negotiating player and coach contracts. During his tenure as general manager, the team drafted numerous talented players, including quarterback Roman Gabriel (first-round pick in 1961), Deacon Jones (14th-round pick in 1961), and Merlin Olsen (first-round pick in 1962), player who helped the Rams improve to 11–1–2 in 1967 and 10–3–1 in 1968. In 1963, after Dan Reeves acquired outright ownership of the Rams, Hirsch&#x27;s title was changed to assistant to the president. He continued to serve as Reeves&#x27; assistant through the 1968 season.

===University of Wisconsin===
In February 1969, Hirsch was hired away from the Rams to serve as the athletic director at the University of Wisconsin. Within four years, he had raised home attendance at football games from an average of 43,000 to 70,000 per game. During his tenure as athletic director, the number of sports offered by the UW athletics department doubled and the Badgers won national titles in ice hockey, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s crew, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country. However, the program also had problems with recruiting violations and a fundraising controversy. Hirsch announced his resignation as Wisconsin&#x27;s athletic director in December 1986; the resignation became effective at the end of June 1987. In July 1987, he was hired to do color commentary on radio broadcasts of Wisconsin football games.

==Legacy and honors==
During his pro football career, Hirsch had 387 receptions for 7,029 yards and 60 touchdowns. In a film profile of Hirsch produced by the NFL Films, Michael MacCambridge, author of &quot;America&#x27;s Game&quot;, described Hirsch as &quot;the first true flanker deep threat&quot; and stated:

We talk today about yards after the catch, but he would get acres of yards after the catch because he was so elusive in the open field. When the ball was up in the air, he looked like Willie Mays in center field. He could adjust and wind up catching the ball over his shoulder in stride about as well as anyone. If you take a look at the offensive stats in pro football then, he was not just the best in the league, he was head and shoulders above his competitors.

NFL executive Bill Granholm recalled that it was Hirsch&#x27;s ability to make the overhead or over-the-shoulder catch that set him apart: &quot;He would run down the field with his chin high in the air – with his head all the way back. Under a long pass, he didn&#x27;t look left or right as they do today – he looked up and back at the ball as it came to him over his head... [H]e put his head between the ball and the defensive back. That&#x27;s how he caught so many bombs.&quot;

Hirsch was inducted into both the Pro Football Hall of Fame (inducted 1968) and the College Football Hall of Fame (inducted 1974). In September 1969, at the time of the NFL&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Hirsch was one of 16 players named to the all-time All-Pro team selected by the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was also named to the NFL&#x27;s 1950s All-Decade Team (as a flanker) in August 1969. He has also received many other honors, including the following:

* He was inducted into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1964.
* In January 1983, Hirsch tossed the honorary coin at the start of Super Bowl XVII. He was the third former player to be so honored, following Red Grange and Bobby Layne.
* Hirsch was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1984.
* In September 1986, Hirsch was selected by Los Angeles fans as a first-team receiver on the Rams&#x27; All-Time Team. He received the seventh highest total in the voting.
* In September 1987, Oakland Avenue, a short street located just south of Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wisconsin, was renamed &quot;Crazylegs Lane&quot; in Hirsch&#x27;s honor.
* In November 1987, the University of Wisconsin retired Hirsch&#x27;s jersey number 40. Hirsch&#x27;s jersey was only the third to be retired at Wisconsin.
* In July 1988, Hirsch was inducted into the National High School Sports Hall of Fame based on his accomplishments as a football and basketball player at Wausau High School.
* In August 1999, Hirsch was ranked number 89 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.
* In May 2005, Hirsch was honored with a bronze plaque in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum&#x27;s &quot;Court of Honor&quot;.
* In 2021, &quot;The Athletic&quot; listed him as the 94th greatest player ever.

Hirsch is also the namesake of the Crazylegs Classic, an annual eight-kilometer running race from the Wisconsin State Capitol to Camp Randall Stadium with proceeds benefiting the University of Wisconsin athletics programs.

==Family and later years==

Hirsch married his high school sweetheart, Ruth Stahmer (1923–2011), in June 1946. They remained married until Hirsch&#x27;s death 58 years later. They had a son, Win Steven (1949–2009), and a daughter, Patricia Caroline (later Patricia Hirsch-Malmquist), born in approximately 1957.

Hirsch died of natural causes at an assisted living home in Madison, Wisconsin in January 2004 at age 80.

<doc id="445861" wikidata="Q1261570" url="?curid=445861" title="Frank Gifford">
<text>Francis Newton Gifford (August 16, 1930 – August 9, 2015) was an American professional football player, actor, and television sports commentator. After a 12-year playing career as a halfback, flanker and safety for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL), he was a play-by-play announcer and commentator for 27 years on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;.

Gifford won the NFL Most Valuable Player Award from United Press International (UPI) in 1956, the same season his team won the NFL Championship. During his career, he participated in five league championship games and was named to eight Pro Bowls. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977. After retiring as a player Gifford was an Emmy Award-winning sportscaster, known for his work on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;, and the Olympics. He was married to television host Kathie Lee Gifford from 1986 until his death.

== Early life ==
Gifford was born in Santa Monica, California, the son of Lola Mae (née Hawkins) and Weldon Gifford, an oil driller. He graduated from Kern County Union High School, later renamed Bakersfield High School.

Following Gifford&#x27;s death in 2015, his wife Kathie Lee Gifford said that her late husband grew up in a poverty-stricken home and that he and his family sometimes ate dog food. She said they lived in 29 places before Gifford attended high school, because his father could not find work during the Depression. She also said that as a young child, the family attended church every week and Gifford &quot;asked Jesus into his heart and that remained with him for the rest of his life&quot;.

==College career==
Gifford was unable to gain an athletic scholarship to the University of Southern California (USC) because of his low grade point average in high school. As a result, he played a season of football for Bakersfield Junior College. While at Bakersfield, he made the Junior College All-America team and earned the grades needed to enroll at USC. At USC, Gifford was named an All-American after rushing for 841 yards on 195 carries during his final season. While at USC he was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. He graduated from USC in 1952.

== NFL career ==
Gifford spent his entire National Football League (NFL) career with the New York Giants, beginning in 1952, playing both offense and defense. He made eight Pro Bowl appearances and had five trips to the NFL Championship Game. Gifford&#x27;s best season may have been 1956, when he won the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award and led the Giants to the NFL title over the Chicago Bears.

He lost 18 months in the prime of his career when he was tackled by Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Chuck Bednarik, in what is widely considered the hardest defensive hit, or one of the hardest, in the history of the NFL and is often referred to simply as The Hit. During a 1960 season game against the Eagles, he was knocked out by Bednarik on a passing play, suffering a severe concussion that led him to retire from football in 1961. However, Gifford returned to the Giants in 1962, changing positions from halfback to flanker.

His Pro Bowl selections came at three positions, safety, halfback, and flanker. He permanently retired following the 1964 season.

During his 12 seasons with the Giants (136 regular-season games) Gifford had 3,609 rushing yards and 34 touchdowns in 840 carries; he also had 367 receptions for 5,434 yards and 43 touchdowns. Gifford completed 29 of the 63 passes he threw for 823 yards and 14 touchdowns with 6 interceptions. The 14 touchdowns is the most among any non-quarterback in NFL history; the 6 interceptions is tied with Walter Payton for most thrown by a non-quarterback.

Gifford was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on July 30, 1977.

After his death, an autopsy on his brain revealed that he lived with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), a disease closely related to repeated head trauma. As of September 18, 2015, 87 out of 91 former NFL players tested had been diagnosed with the disease.

== Broadcasting career ==
After his playing days ended, Gifford became a broadcaster for CBS, covering football, golf and basketball. When &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; was launched in 1970, ABC had originally planned to have Gifford in their broadcast booth, but he still had a year remaining on his contract with CBS. Instead Gifford recommended his friend Don Meredith who was hired. The following year, Gifford replaced Keith Jackson as &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;&#x27;s play-by-play announcer, and remained involved with the show for 27 of its next 28 years. His low-key delivery provided a perfect counterbalance to broadcast partners Meredith and Howard Cosell. In an era with only three television broadcast networks, the series became the longest-running prime-time sports program in television history, and developed into one of television&#x27;s most valuable franchises.

Gifford was providing play-by-play in the waning moments of a 1980 &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game between the New England Patriots and Miami Dolphins when he and Cosell learned of John Lennon&#x27;s murder. Cosell initially balked at breaking the news live on air, but Gifford convinced him, saying, &quot;You’ve got to. If you know it, we’ve got to do it. Don’t hang on it. It’s a tragic moment, and this is going to shake up the whole world&quot;. Cosell then informed the national audience of the tragedy.

On January 20, 1985, Gifford provided play-by-play for the first Super Bowl to be broadcast on ABC, Super Bowl XIX between the San Francisco 49ers and Miami Dolphins in Stanford, California. Gifford was joined in the booth by Don Meredith and Joe Theismann.

In 1986, Al Michaels took over play-by-play duties, and Gifford switched to a color commentator role. However, Gifford did play-by-play for the next several years (Gifford was joined by Lynn Swann and O. J. Simpson on color commentary in 1986 and by Dan Dierdorf for the rest of his run on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;) whenever Michaels was covering post-season baseball games for the network.

Following his affair with airline flight attendant Suzen Johnson in 1997, Gifford was replaced in the broadcast booth by Boomer Esiason in 1998. That season he was reassigned to a nominal role for ABC&#x27;s Monday night pregame show, but that program was cancelled after one season. Gifford was not offered a new role by the network. Gifford was also host of British TV network Channel 4&#x27;s NFL coverage with British born former New England Patriots kicker John Smith in 1986, which included coverage of Super Bowl XXI. Additionally, he narrated the official Super Bowl XLVIII highlight film for NFL Films, for which he had narrated the New York Giants&#x27; annual highlight films.
Gifford was also a reporter and commentator on other ABC sports programs, such as coverage of the Olympics (including the controversial men&#x27;s basketball gold medal game between the United States and Soviet Union at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, which Gifford called alongside Bill Russell), skiing and golf. He announced Evel Knievel&#x27;s jumps for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; in the 1970s, including when Knievel failed to clear 13 buses at Wembley Stadium in 1975. Gifford also guest hosted &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on occasion, including once when he met his future wife Kathie Lee.

In 1977, Gifford won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Sports Personality. He was given the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award by the Pro Football Hall of Fame In 1995 for his NFL television work.

&quot;Monday Night Football&quot; paid tribute to Gifford on September 14, 2015, by having ESPN announcers Mike Tirico and Jon Gruden wear the gold jackets that Gifford helped make famous as a broadcaster.

== Acting roles ==
Frank Gifford appeared as Ensign Cy Mount in the 1959 World War II submarine film drama &quot;Up Periscope&quot;, starring James Garner, Edmond O&#x27;Brien, Andra Martin, and Alan Hale Jr.

Gifford appeared as himself as a guest star on the NBC television series, &quot;Hazel&quot;, in the episode, &quot;Hazel and the Halfback&quot;, which originally aired December 26, 1963. In the story, Gifford is interested in investing in a local bowling alley. In 1977, Gifford appeared as himself in the episode &quot;The Shortest Yard&quot; of the ABC sitcom &quot;The San Pedro Beach Bums&quot;. He also appeared as himself in a two-hour episode of &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; titled &quot;The Bionic Boy&quot; in the same year. In 1994, Gifford also appeared as himself in the Nickelodeon kids show &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot; as a customer for the boy&#x27;s Dad&#x27;s driving range. In season one episode 4 titled &quot;Rangeboy&quot;, Gifford and his wife Kathie Lee appeared in the February 28, 1995, episode of the ABC sitcom &quot;Coach&quot;, titled &quot;The Day I Met Frank Gifford&quot;, in which a character on the show plots to meet the former football star who will attend an event to receive an award.

Gifford also had acting roles in television commercials.

== Personal life ==
Gifford married his college sweetheart, USC&#x27;s homecoming queen Maxine Avis Ewart, on January 13, 1952, after she became pregnant while they were students at USC. They had three children, Jeff (b. 1952), Kyle, and Victoria; and five grandchildren. Victoria Gifford married Michael LeMoyne Kennedy, son of Robert F. Kennedy. Frank Gifford was next married to fitness trainer Astrid Lindley from 1978 to 1986. His first two marriages ended in divorce. Gifford married television presenter and singer Kathie Lee Johnson, who was 23 years his junior, on October 18, 1986. The couple settled in Greenwich, Connecticut, with their son, Cody Newton Gifford and daughter, Cassidy Erin Gifford. Gifford and his third wife Kathie Lee shared the same birthday, August 16. The couple co-hosted ABC&#x27;s coverage of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.

Gifford had an older sister, Winona, and a younger brother, Waine. 
In 1997, the tabloid magazine &quot;Globe&quot; paid a woman named Suzen Johnson to meet, befriend, and lure Gifford into a New York City hotel room secretly equipped with videotape systems enabling the Globe to take and obtain photos of Gifford being seduced. They published photos and stories. ESPN reported that the tabloid paid Johnson $75,000 to lure Gifford to the room while &quot;The Atlantic&quot; said it was $125,000. &quot;National Enquirer&quot; editor Steve Coz observed, &quot;There&#x27;s a difference between reporting the news and creating the news ... [w]ithout &quot;The Globe&quot;, there would be no story here. I&#x27;m in the tabloid industry, and this is way over the top. It&#x27;s downright cruel.&quot;

Henry Bushkin, Johnny Carson&#x27;s former lawyer, claimed that Gifford had an affair with Carson&#x27;s second wife Joanne in 1970.

== Death ==
On August 9, 2015, a week before his 85th birthday, Gifford died from natural causes at his Greenwich, Connecticut, home.

In November 2015, Gifford&#x27;s family revealed that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The family said, &quot;After losing our beloved husband and father, Frank Gifford, we as a family made the difficult decision to have his brain studied in hopes of contributing to the advancement of medical research concerning the link between football and traumatic brain injury... We decided to disclose our loved one&#x27;s condition to honor Frank&#x27;s legacy of promoting player safety dating back to his involvement in the formation of the NFL Players Association in the 1950s.&quot; He was one of at least 345 NFL players to be diagnosed after death with this disease, which is caused by repeated hits to the head.

<text>USS &quot;S-36&quot; (SS-141) was an S-class submarine of the United States Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;S-36&quot;&#x27;s keel was laid down on 10 December 1918 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation of San Francisco, California. She was launched on 3 June 1919 sponsored by Miss Helen Russell, and commissioned on 4 April 1923.

==Service history==
Following trials, &quot;S-36&quot; operated along the United States West Coast until the summer of 1925, with interruptions for exercises in Alaskan waters in June 1923 and for fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean Sea during the winter of 1924. She was then assigned to the United States Asiatic Fleet, departing the U.S. West Coast in mid-September 1925, and arriving at the Submarine Base, Cavite Navy Yard, Luzon, Philippines, on 4 November 1925.

===Asiatic Fleet===
For the next sixteen years, &quot;S-26&quot; remained in the western Pacific, conducting exercises and patrols and undergoing overhauls at Cavite during the winter, and operating off the China coast from Tsingtao during the summer months. With the increase of hostilities on the mainland, however, summer deployments were shortened and individual patrols were extended throughout the Philippines, into the South China Sea, and in 1938, into the Dutch East Indies.

From April to June 1940, &quot;S-36&quot; conducted her last China deployment and for the next year and a half remained in Philippine waters. By December 1941, the fleet was alerted to the possibility of a Japanese attack. On 2 December, her scheduled overhaul was cancelled and she was ordered north on patrol.

Water, stores, and torpedoes were taken on and she departed Cavite at 0100 on 3 December. By late afternoon, she was off Cape Bolinao, where she passed several Yangtze Patrol gunboats en route to Manila. At 1930, she entered Bolinao harbor, where she remained on continuous alert for the next week. On 8 December 1941, she received the news that the Japanese had started hostilities.

===World War II===
A few hours later, &quot;S-36&quot; sighted enemy aircraft; that afternoon, she took up patrol duties between Cape Bolinao and San Fernando. On 9 December excessive air leaks developed, but she remained on patrol. On 10 December, the crew listened to radio traffic as the Japanese bombed Cavite. After the raid, the submarine&#x27;s radio operator was unable to raise the station. On 12 December, &quot;S-36&quot;&#x27;s electrical steering failed, and she was still unable to contact Cavite. Exhaust valve leaks appeared on 13 December, and on 14 December she received an urgent message requesting her position. None of her previous messages had gotten through. Two days later, she was ordered to Mariveles at the entrance to Manila Bay.

Still unable to transmit and with worsening air and salt water leaks, &quot;S-36&quot; proceeded to Mariveles, anchoring there four days later. Repairs were made over the next few weeks and stores replenished, and she then started a final patrol in Philippine waters before heading south to join Allied forces gathering in the Dutch East Indies.

Clearing Mariveles Bay on 30 December 1941, she immediately commenced patrolling the Verde Island Passage between Luzon and Mindoro. On 1 January 1942, she reconnoitered the north and east coast of Batangas Bay, then moved to the west and south of Verde Island. In mid-afternoon, she sighted a small Japanese transport moored to the seawall at Calapan, Mindoro, fired one torpedo, and claimed the sinking of the target. However, this was not confirmed by Japanese loss records.

For seven more days, she maintained her patrol in the Passage. On 8 January, the port engine air compressor failed, and, because of battery water consumption and the distance and time involved in the transit to the Dutch East Indies, she began making her way south. On 10 January, the starboard engine air compressor became troublesome. On 12 January, she hunted in the Sulu Sea. On 13 January, her port main motor went out of commission, but on 14 January she resumed hunting in the Sulu Sea.

On the morning of 15 January, at the approximate intersection of the Sibutu-Makassar and Davao-Tarakan routes, diving was delayed by oil supply failures to the starboard engine, and she was spotted by a Japanese destroyer.

With one engine out, &quot;S-36&quot; submerged and prepared to fire torpedoes at the Japanese warship. But the destroyer was quicker, and before the submarine could fire, the enemy dropped seven depth charges which exploded off both quarters of the S-boat.

Immediate damage included the loss of power control over the bow planes; gyrocompass failure; blown fuses on the starboard lighting circuit, and broken lights in the motor room. By the time she reached a depth of , her gyrocompass was working again and she began turning slowly to starboard. The destroyer was kept astern.

&quot;S-36&quot; ran at one-third speed, but with poor depth control and trim. Soon her main motor bearing began smoking, and oil had to be continuously applied by hand with an squirt gun. At about 0630, almost an hour and a half after the initial contact, she lost depth control and her trim pump stalled. The No. 2 main ballast was blown and at the boat began to rise to the surface. Previous steps were reversed, and venting and flooding was started by the crew. The boat stopped at a depth of .

As the destroyer continued to hunt her, &quot;S-36&quot;&#x27;s depth continued to fluctuate between . Life jackets and escape lungs were issued. At 0700, control was reestablished, and at 0705 the crew heard the last efforts of the destroyer to locate her. Still in critical condition of trim and propulsion, &quot;S-36&quot; cleared the area and about noontime began making repairs to her port main motor. By 2030, the motor was operating &quot;after a fashion.&quot; Within six hours, however, it was smoking. The battery charge was secured. At 0320 on 16 January, the starboard motor lubrication supply again failed.

At dawn on 16 January, &quot;S-36&quot; submerged. Two hours later, she sighted the Sulawesi (Celebes) coast. At noon, fire broke out in the main motor auxiliary circulating pump and was extinguished. After 1900, she surfaced, and at 2308 passed North Watcher Island at the northern end of Makassar Strait.

On 17 January, she received orders to proceed to Surabaya, Java. Both port and starboard shafts went out of commission during the day and one man collapsed from the heat, but the main motor lube oil pumps were repaired. On 18 January, &quot;S-36&quot; had her &quot;1st day since January 8 with no major part of engineering plant out of commission.&quot; She continued south through Makassar Strait.

===Loss===
At 0404 on 20 January 1942, &quot;S-36&quot; ran hard aground on Taka Bakang Reef at the southern end of Makassar Strait, approximately west-northwest of Makassar, Celebes, Netherlands East Indies. For over twenty-four hours the crew battled to save the submarine, but chlorine gas generated by her flooded forward battery and the sea conditions combined against them. A plain-language radio request for aid was sent, and on the morning of 21 January, the Dutch launch &quot;Attla&quot; was dispatched from Makassar. Two officers and 28 men transferred to &quot;Attla&quot; and taken to Makassar, but &quot;S-36&quot;&#x27;s commanding officer (Lt. John R. McKnight, Jr.) and the remaining crew stayed on board for a final attempt to save &quot;S-36&quot;. However, the situation worsened, and when the Dutch cargo ship &quot;Siberote&quot; arrived after noon, McKnight decided the submarine was beyond saving, transferred himself and the remaining crew to the Dutch vessel, and scuttled &quot;S-36&quot; by flooding at 1330.

&quot;Siberote&quot; proceeded to Makassar to pick up the previously evacuated crew members, then to Surabaya, where they were reassigned.

<text>Raymond A. Moody Jr. (born June 30, 1944) is an American philosopher, psychiatrist, physician and author, most widely known for his books about afterlife and near-death experiences (NDE), a term that he coined in 1975 in his best-selling book &quot;Life After Life&quot;. His research explores personal accounts of subjective phenomena encountered in near-death experiences, particularly those of people who have apparently died but been resuscitated. He has widely published his views on what he terms near-death-experience psychology.

==Early life and education==

Moody was born in Porterdale, Georgia, the son of an agnostic surgeon. He earned a BA (1966), an M.A. (1967) and a PhD (1969) in philosophy from the University of Virginia. He also obtained a PhD in psychology from the University of West Georgia, then known as West Georgia College, where he later became a professor in the topic. In 1976, he received an M.D. from the Medical College of Georgia.

==Career==
=== Early career ===
After obtaining his M.D., Moody worked as a forensic psychiatrist in a maximum-security Georgia state hospital. In 1998, Moody was appointed chair in Consciousness Studies at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

===Near-death research===
While an undergraduate at the University of Virginia in 1965, Moody encountered psychiatrist, Dr. George Ritchie, who told Moody about an incident in which he believed he had journeyed into the afterlife while dead for nearly nine minutes at the age of 20 (which Ritchie would later recount in his book, &quot;Return From Tomorrow&quot;, published in 1978). Moody began documenting similar accounts by other people who had experienced clinical death and discovered that many of these experiences shared common features, such as the feeling of being out of one&#x27;s body, the sensation of traveling through a tunnel, encountering dead relatives, and encountering a bright light. In 1975, Moody published many of these experiences in his book, &quot;Life After Life&quot;, in which he coined the term &quot;near-death experience&quot;.

In an interview with Jeffrey Mishlove, Moody shared his personal conclusions about his research into near-death experiences:
===Later research===
Inspired by the Greek psychomanteums where the ancient Greeks would go to consult the apparitions of the dead (which Moody had read about in classic Greek texts that he encountered while a student at the University of Virginia), Moody built a psychomanteum in Alabama, which he calls the Dr. John Dee Theater of the Mind. By staring into a mirror in a dimly lit room, Moody claims that people are able to summon visions of spiritual apparitions &quot;(see mirror gazing)&quot;.

Moody has also researched past life regression and believes that he personally has had nine past lives.

==Criticism of Moody&#x27;s near-death research==

Barry Beyerstein, a professor of psychology, has written that Moody&#x27;s alleged evidence for an afterlife is flawed, both logically and empirically. The psychologist James Alcock has noted that Moody &quot;... appears to ignore a great deal of the scientific literature dealing with hallucinatory experiences in general, just as he quickly glosses over the very real limitations of his research method.&quot;

Moody has been described as a &quot;strong personal believer&quot; in the paranormal. His methods have drawn criticism from the scientific community as many of the personal reports he collected on NDEs were given by the patients themselves, months and even years after the event. Terence Hines commented &quot;such reports are hardly sufficient to argue for the reality of an afterlife.&quot;

The philosopher Paul Kurtz has written that Moody&#x27;s evidence for the NDE is based on personal interviews and anecdotal accounts and there has been no statistical analysis of his data. There also is the question of interpreting such data as has been published assuming that the factual matter is objectively correct; according to Kurtz, &quot;there is no reliable evidence that people who report such experiences have died and returned, or that consciousness exists separate from the brain or body.&quot;

The philosopher Robert Todd Carroll has written that a characteristic of Moody&#x27;s work is the omission of cases that do not fit his hypothesis, confirming the aspect of cherry picking. Carroll writes that what Moody describes as a typical NDE may be due to brain states triggered by cardiac arrest and anesthesia. Moody believes NDEs are evidence for an afterlife but Carroll states they can be explained by neurochemistry and are the result of a &quot;dying, demented or drugged brain.&quot;

== Personal life ==

Moody says he had a near-death experience in 1991 when he attempted suicide (which he talks about in his book &quot;Paranormal&quot;) which he says was the result of an undiagnosed thyroid condition which affected his mental state. In an interview in 1993, Moody stated he was placed in a mental hospital by his family for his work with mirror gazing.

<text>USS &quot;Chopper&quot; (SS/AGSS/IXSS-342) was a submarine of the United States Navy. It was their only ship to be named for the chopper, a common name for &quot;Pomatomus saltatrix&quot;, an aggressive game fish. She was in commission from 1945 to 1969, her active career ending due to damage from a nearly fatal accident.

==Career==

&quot;Chopper&#x27;s&quot; keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 4 February 1945, sponsored by Mrs. G. S. Beebe, and commissioned on 25 May 1945.

&quot;Chopper &quot; sailed from New London, Connecticut on 4 July 1945 for Pearl Harbor, where she lay from 21 September-24 October. On 30 October, she arrived at San Diego, California, her assigned home port. She sailed on 2 January 1946 for the Philippines, where she trained and offered local services until 11 May, when she returned to San Diego and began local operations. Her next deployment – a simulated war patrol to China – took place from 28 July to 9 November 1947. After west coast operations through 1948, she departed San Diego on 14 March 1949 for her new home port, Key West, Florida, arriving on 4 April. Operations in Florida waters and the Caribbean Sea were conducted until 15 September 1950, when she entered the Electric Boat Company yards for modernization. She returned to Key West for fleet exercises and training on 23 May 1951.

&quot;Chopper&quot; departed Key West, Florida on 7 January 1952 for a tour of duty in the Mediterranean Sea until 20 May. She resumed local operations, then joined in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) operations in the Atlantic from 12 September-14 October. Frequent trips to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and local operations continued until 25 May 1959, when she sailed to join in special exercises in the Mediterranean before returning to Key West on 9 August. Through 1960, she continued operations off Florida and in the Caribbean Sea, often acting as a target for surface ships in training.

==Accident==
On 11 February 1969, &quot;Chopper&quot; was participating in an ASW exercise off the coast of Cuba with when her electrical power tripped off-line. &quot;Chopper&quot; was making at a depth of with a slight down angle when she lost power.

Within seconds, &quot;Chopper&quot;″s angle increased to 45° down and her bow passed of depth. Because of the power loss, the officer of the deck could not communicate with the senior controller in the maneuvering room. Still, Ken Taylor, the senior chief petty officer in the maneuvering room, independently ordered both main motors back full. Despite the backing bell (an order for motors full astern), blowing ballast, and other efforts to regain control of the submarine, the down angle continued to increase, and within one minute of the power failure, &quot;Chopper&quot; was nearly vertical in the water, bow down. &quot;Chopper&quot;″s bow is estimated to have reached a depth of , her stern reaching .

The crew&#x27;s efforts began to take effect. &quot;Chopper&quot; lost the headway and started to make sternway. Her bow began to rise, reached level, and continued to climb. &quot;Chopper&quot; began to ascend with a rapidly increasing up-angle until she was again nearly vertical in the water, now bow up.

About two minutes after losing electrical power, &quot;Chopper&quot; shot nearly vertically through the ocean&#x27;s surface. The entire forward section of the submarine, to the aft edge of the sail, cleared the surface before she fell back. Her momentum carried her down to a depth of about before she surfaced again, leveled out, and remained on the surface.

&quot;Chopper&quot; returned to port under her own power. Reports that she had experienced a &quot;near disaster&quot; appeared in newspapers starting on 18 February. Inspection discovered that her hull had suffered extensive structural damage during the deep dive and rapid ascent. &quot;Chopper&quot; was decommissioned on 15 September 1969.

==Later career and disposal==
&quot;Chopper&quot; was re-classified, given hull classification symbol AGSS-342, and served as a United States Naval Reserve (USNR) dockside trainer in New Orleans, Louisiana until 1971, when the USNR Submarine Reserve program was discontinued. She was re-classified, given hull classification symbol IXSS-342, and was used for salvage and rescue training.

In 1976, &quot;Chopper&quot; was modified to serve as a tethered, submerged torpedo target for the submarine . On 21 July, while &quot;Spadefish&quot; was on her final approach, &quot;Chopper&quot; began to take on water, broke her tethers, and sank.

==Fiction==
In his book &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, author Tom Clancy mentions the misfortune of &quot;Chopper&quot; in 1969 while discussing the fate of the fictional Soviet fast-attack sub &quot;E.S. Politovskiy&quot;.
In &quot;Ice Station Zebra (novel)&quot; by Alistair MacLean there is a description of a sub that dives bow first far past its test depth, with the crew taking actions very similar to the ones taken by &quot;Chopper&quot;.

<text>Bikini waxing is the removal of pubic hair using a special wax, which can be hot or cold, that adheres to hairs and pulls them out when the wax is removed quickly from the skin, usually with a cloth strip. While the practice is mainly associated with women, male waxing has become a more common practice to remove men&#x27;s pubic hair.

A bikini line is the area of the upper leg and inner thigh in which pubic hair grows that is normally not covered by the bottom part of a swimsuit. In some cultures, visible pubic hair in this region is disliked and/or considered embarrassing and so it is sometimes removed. However, some people remove pubic hair that will not be exposed for aesthetics, personal grooming, hygiene, culture, religion, fashion and for sexual intercourse.

== Technique ==
Pubic hair can be removed in a number of ways, such as waxing, shaving, sugaring, electrolysis, laser hair removal or with chemical depilatory creams. Waxing involves applying melted, usually hot, wax to the pubic hair that an individual would like to remove. The wax, which adheres to the hair as it hardens, is then covered with small strips of cloth. When the wax hardens sufficiently, the cloth is pulled off quickly, removing the hair from its roots as the wax is pulled away. Waxing can be performed on oneself privately using a home kit or by a cosmetologist at a salon or spa.


If a person has never been waxed before, or has not been waxed for a long time, it may be necessary to trim the pubic hair using scissors or an electric razor prior to waxing. A patch test is recommended, usually on the upper thigh, to test for allergies or skin sensitivities to the ingredients in the wax. Sometimes a hair growth inhibitor is applied after waxing, which slows the regrowth of hair if applied daily for an extended period of time.

It is common to apply an antiseptic cleaner and powder to the area prior to waxing. Wax is applied with a spatula in the direction of hair growth the size of a strip about wide and long. When the wax is set but still pliable, the wax strips are pulled away against the direction of hair growth while keeping the skin taut. The strip is ideally pulled off as swiftly as possible.

The pubic area is one of the most sensitive areas in the body and during the procedure special attention must be paid to avoid irritation. Pain directly resulting from the procedure can be slight or severe and can continue from several seconds to several minutes. Some people experience less pain during subsequent treatments. It can be helpful to take a mild anti-inflammatory medication (such as ibuprofen) an hour or so before waxing to reduce potential pain from the waxing. Products such as topical anesthetics are available to lessen the pain involved. A bikini wax during pregnancy is generally more painful, due to increased sensitivity. The type of wax used for bikini lines is often made from a mixture of beeswax and tall oil rather than the more common synthetic waxes used for waxing regular leg hair. Beeswax is considered stronger and more effective at removing the thicker and coarser pubic hair.

Sometimes bumps or in-grown hair can result from waxing. Isolated hairs can be removed with tweezers or electrolysis. Discomfort following the procedure generally lasts two to five days or less. Application of egg oil for a few days post-waxing can help moisturize the skin and reduce inflammation, pain or growth of bacteria. With repeated removal over time, pubic hair becomes weaker and grows more slowly, leading to easier removal with less pain and less frequent waxing.

== Styles ==


Some people modify their pubic hair either to fit in with societal trends or simply as an expression of their own style or lifestyle, while others object to any styling or do not practice it because of cost considerations.

&quot;Natural&quot; (also known as &quot;au natural&quot; or &quot;bush&quot;) refers to pubic hair that has not been removed, trimmed or styled at all. &quot;Trimmed&quot; or &quot;cut&quot; refers to pubic hair that has been shortened, but not completely removed other than shaving the inner thighs. Some women trim, but keep hair on their labia, while removing the pubic hair on the mons pubis. Pubic hair may be styled into several basic styles which are often referred to by different names. Salons often use their own unique names for common types of waxing, for example referring to a Brazilian with a &quot;landing strip&quot; as a &quot;Mohican&quot; or a &quot;Hollywood&quot; as &quot;Full Monty&quot;.

The three major types are described below:

=== American waxing ===
&quot;American waxing&quot; is the removal of only the pubic hair that would not be covered by a swimsuit. For a bikini, it would be hair at the top of the thighs and under the navel. It is also known as a &quot;basic bikini wax&quot;, &quot;triangle&quot;, or &quot;bikini line&quot;, as it involves waxing hair from the sides to form a triangle so that pubic hair cannot be seen while wearing a swimsuit. Bikini bottoms or underwear are usually worn while getting an American wax. A normal American waxing job takes about 20 to 30 minutes to complete.

=== French waxing ===
&quot;French waxing&quot; (sometimes called a &quot;landing strip&quot; or a &quot;partial Brazilian wax&quot;) leaves a vertical strip of pubic hair about wide and long just above the vulva. Hair around the anus area and labia may be removed. The landing strip wax has become popular with models wearing garments that are very narrow in the crotch region. To create the &quot;landing strip&quot; (a line of hair) practitioners and clients prefer either lying face up or lying face down. Sometimes hard wax is used, though strip wax works as effectively.

=== Brazilian waxing ===
&quot;Brazilian waxing&quot; (or the &quot;sphinx wax&quot;) is the removal of all pubic hair from the pelvic region, labia, perineum, and anus, while sometimes leaving a thin strip of hair on the mons pubis. It can be used by those who wear thong bikinis. Brazilian waxing is also known as a &quot;full Brazilian wax&quot;, &quot;full bikini wax&quot;, or the &quot;Hollywood wax&quot;. This style was first called the Brazilian wax by the J. Sisters salon in Manhattan, founded in 1987 by seven sisters named Padilha from Brazil.

Brazilian waxing is more controversial than other types of waxing. Like all waxing, it can be a physically painful experience during and after waxing. Some believe it is more unpleasant to receive cunnilingus from a bearded partner after getting a Brazilian wax. Some critics of the procedure believe that Brazilian waxing can contribute to making an adult woman look underage, claiming that this may be one reason for its popularity in the sex industry. There is also a health risk involved if it is not done properly, as well as a risk of infection if done on a person with a weakened immune system.

== Health ==
In 2016, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study in which it was found that out of 3,316 American women surveyed, 84% reported a history of lifetime pubic hair grooming, with 59% reporting that the primary motivations for grooming were for hygienic purposes.

Bikini waxing has been credited with a significant global reduction in cases of pubic lice. However, the medical community has also seen a recent increase in folliculitis, or infection around the hair follicle, in women who wax or shave their bikini areas.

== Social attitudes ==
In Islam, the removal of unwanted body hair is known as an act of &quot;fitra&quot;. In India, ethnologist F. Fawcett writing in 1901, had observed the removal of body hair, including pubic hair about the vulva, as a custom of women from the Hindu caste group known as Nair. In Western societies, removal of female body hair (except for head hair, eyelashes and eyebrows) has traditionally been considered appropriate when it was visible.

The styling of pubic hair has become more fashionable as the coverage of swimwear has decreased, following innovations such as the introduction of the bikini in 1946 and the removal of skirts from swimsuits. The popularity of even briefer swimwear, such as the thong which exposes the buttocks, has led to the removal of more pubic hair.

Changes in lingerie styles also encouraged the removal of pubic hair, and the nude crotchi.e., the total removal of pubic hair, such as in a full Brazilian or the Sphinx stylebecame considered by many to be erotic and glamorous. A nude crotch is considered by some to be more youthful looking. According to Tschachler, Devine and Draxlbauer, removal of all visible body hair has come to be seen as an important aspect of femininity.

<doc id="445872" wikidata="Q7873634" url="?curid=445872" title="USS S-39">
<text>USS &quot;S-39&quot; (SS-144) was a United States Navy &quot;S&quot;-class submarine that saw combat in the Pacific Theater during World War II. She was accidentally run aground on her fifth war patrol and was subsequently abandoned.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;S-39&quot;′s keel was laid down on 14 January 1919 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation at San Francisco, California. She was launched on 2 July 1919 sponsored by Miss Clara M. Huber, and commissioned on 14 September 1923.

==Service history==
After commissioning and fitting out, &quot;S-39&quot; joined Submarine Force, Battle Fleet; and from October–December 1923, conducted maneuvers off southern California. With the next year, 1924, she moved south to the Panama Canal, thence proceeded into the Caribbean Sea for final trials, further exercises, and training dives. By April, she was back at Mare Island for her first overhaul.

===Asiatic fleet===
On 17 September, &quot;S-39&quot; departed San Francisco for the Philippines. Steaming &quot;via&quot; Pearl Harbor and Guam, she reached Manila on 5 November; joined the Asiatic Fleet as a member of Submarine Division 17 (SubDiv 17); and commenced local operations and drills in the Luzon area. In mid-May 1925, she sailed for the Asiatic mainland with her division; and, after brief stops at Amoy and Hong Kong, arrived at Tsingtao, whence she operated until early September. She then returned to Manila and for the next 16 years maintained, with few interruptions, a similar schedule: summers at Tsingtao, with patrols along the China coast; winters in the Philippines, for overhauls, engineering trials, joint Army-Navy maneuvers, type training exercises, and short patrols.

===World War II===
====1st war patrol====
Just prior to the entry of the United States into World War II, &quot;S-39&quot; (under the command of James W. Coe, Class of 1930) patrolled off southern Luzon. After 8 December, she moved into San Bernardino Strait to impede Japanese mining activities. The escorts screening the minelayers, however, kept the submarine at bay with persistent depth charging. On 11 December, &quot;S-39&quot; endured a day-long pounding. She then turned to cutting into the Japanese supply line. On 13 December, she sighted and attacked an enemy freighter, but escorts interfered and her crew was prevented from verifying a sinking. She continued her patrol, unsuccessfully chasing other targets, until 21 December, when she returned to Manila.

====2nd war patrol====
Increased enemy air activity rendered naval installations in the area untenable, and &quot;S-39&quot; was ordered to Java to join what in mid-January 1942 would become the ABDA command. Conducting her second war patrol en route, she arrived at Soerabaja on 24 January. She soon departed on her third patrol. Coe was transferred to command USS &quot;Skipjack&quot; in March 1942.

====3rd and 4th war patrol====
As Japanese landings at Timor were expected, &quot;S-39&quot; was ordered to the Karimata Strait. The main Japanese force transited the strait and landed at Java without &quot;S-39&quot; sighting it. Operating in the South China Sea and Java Sea, she reconnoitered Chebia Island in search of a British admiral and an air marshal who had supposedly escaped Singapore. &quot;S-39&quot; landed a search party, but failed to locate any refugees. She then sailed for Australia &quot;via&quot; the Sunda Strait, where on 4 March she found the tanker (credited as during the war) &quot;Erimo&quot;. &quot;S-39&quot; fired four Mark 10 torpedoes, scoring three contact hits. This made &quot;S-39&quot;, like her &quot;Sugar&quot; boat sisters, and , well known in the news. Two weeks later, she arrived at Fremantle, Australia. By the end of April, she had moved to Brisbane, which she departed on her fourth patrol on 10 May. For the next four weeks, she reconnoitered designated areas of the Louisiade Archipelago, and then operated in the Solomon Islands.

====5th war patrol and loss====
&quot;S-39&quot;″s fifth patrol (now under Francis E. Brown), delayed twice by mechanical failures and once by the necessity of hospitalizing her executive officer, began on 10 August. Assigned station off New Ireland, she made her way across the Coral Sea to the Louisiades. On the night of 13/14 August, she grounded on submerged rocks off Rossel Island and took on a 35° port list. &quot;S-39&quot; immediately blew ballast tanks dry and jettisoned fuel to lighten ship, then backed emergency, to no avail. Heavy seas pounded her and pushed her farther up on the rocks.

Throughout 14 August, breakers crashed over the submarine, but the crew maintained their fight to refloat the ship, including jettisoning more fuel and firing four deactivated torpedoes. By 15 August, the list had increased to 60°. The heavy seas had not abated; &quot;S-39&quot; continued to be pounded against the rocks, and a call for help brought word that the Australian minesweeper was coming. Efforts were begun to rescue the crew. Lieutenant C.N.G. Hendrix and Chief Petty Officer W. L. Schoenrock swam ashore, secured mooring lines to a torpedo which had lodged in the reef for use as riding lines, and assisted other crew members to safety. By noon, 32 men had reached shore. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Katoomba&quot; arrived and by the same time the next day had taken all of the crew of &quot;S-39&quot; on board. &quot;S-39&quot; was left on the rocks, rather than destroyed by gunfire, as her commander was satisfied she would continue breaking up. Her crew were taken to Townsville and reassigned to other submarines. The commanding officer almost faced court martial (grounding in peacetime is considered negligence), but was saved by Admiral Ralph W. Christie.

<doc id="445874" wikidata="Q283407" url="?curid=445874" title="Royal Jordanian Anthem">
<text>The Royal National Anthem () is the national anthem of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The translated name literally means &quot;Peace be upon the King of Jordan&quot;. &quot;As-salamu alaykum&quot; is the greeting in Arabic, therefore the name of the anthem can also be regarded as a Royal Salute. 

== History ==
It was adopted in 1946. The lyrics were penned by ʿAbdul Munʿim Rifāʿī, and the music was composed by ʿAbdul Qādir Tanīr. 

The first version of the lyrics was very short, as it only contained the first stanza of the current version. Since then, the anthem has been expanded. The abridged version of the anthem is usually used, while the full version is reserved for special occasions. The composition is in F major on the musical scale.

<text>Chloe Jones (née Melinda Dee Jones; June 17, 1975 – June 4, 2005) was an American pornographic actress.

==Early life and career==
Melinda Dee Jones was born and grew up in Silsbee, Texas. After graduating from Silsbee High School in 1994, she arrived in California with $400 in her pocket to start her acting career. She appeared in Baywatch, Comedy shows, a movie with Anna Nicole Smith, a Marilyn Monroe movie, and more. She later became a &quot;Playboy&quot; model and appeared in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Hustler&quot;, and &quot;Swank&quot;. Jones was the &quot;Penthouse magazine&quot; Pet of the Month in April 1998, and she reluctantly crossed over into adult movies in 2001. Jones signed an exclusive contract with adult film company New Sensations, followed by another contract with Vivid Entertainment in February 2003. Both associations were brief (her contract with Vivid lasted five months). She retired from the adult industry in 2004. After her retirement on camera in 2004, she continued to earn a living as an escort online and still received money from her website. Jones performed in around 18 films during this time. and, in March 2005, Jones appeared in a story in the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; claiming that Charlie Sheen was among her suitors in February, 2005. Sheen&#x27;s agent disputed the claim, stating that Sheen had not seen Jones since 1996.

She appeared twice on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; in 2003.

==Death==
Jones had been in and out of the hospital for 3 years prior to her death from drug overdoses and complications due to her faulty liver. Since March 2005 her health had deteriorated. Jones died in her sleep at home on June 4, 2005, at around 4:00 am, two weeks shy of her 30th birthday. Her early death has been reported as due to liver failure caused by alcohol and prescription drug abuse. Jones had been on the list for a liver transplant, however people close to her say that she did not take it seriously and continued to drink, eat poorly and continued misusing medications. Jones was survived by her husband, her then 9 year old daughter, her then 8 year old twin sons, her mother Donna and her older sisters Michelle and Melanie. She was buried six days after her death at Woodlawn Garden of Memories Cemetery in Houston, Texas.

<text>USS &quot;Hartford&quot; (SSN-768), a , is the second ship of the Navy to be named for Hartford, Connecticut. The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut on 30 June 1988 and her keel was laid down on 22 February 1992. She was launched on 4 December 1993 sponsored by Laura O&#x27;Keefe, wife of former Secretary of the Navy Sean O&#x27;Keefe, and commissioned on 10 December 1994, with Commander George Kasten in command.

In October 2007, the submarine successfully launched and recovered an AN/BLQ-11 unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV)—the first such operation from a submarine. The vehicle was launched via one of the boat&#x27;s torpedo tubes and recovered with the help of a 60-foot robotic arm.

==In the news==

===2003 grounding in Sardinia===

On 25 October 2003 &quot;Hartford&quot; ran aground near La Maddalena in Sardinia with such force that rudders, sonar and other electronic equipment were severely damaged. After the accident Commander Christopher R. Van Metre, captain of &quot;Hartford&quot;, and Captain Greg Parker, Commodore of Submarine Squadron 22, were relieved of command and sent back to the United States. Six other crewmen were also charged with dereliction of duty.

===2009 collision in Strait of Hormuz===

On 20 March 2009 &quot;Hartford&quot; collided with amphibious transport dock in the Strait of Hormuz, slightly injuring 15 sailors on board. Both vessels were able to proceed under their own power after the incident, although the &quot;New Orleans&quot; suffered a ruptured fuel tank, releasing 25,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the strait.

&quot;Hartford&quot; was escorted back to homeport by destroyer . &quot;Laboon&quot; was, at the time, attached to NATO under Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 and was directed to break away and perform escort duties by Sixth Fleet.

The Navy announced on 14 April 2009 that the submarine&#x27;s skipper, Commander Ryan Brookhart, had been relieved of duty by Rear Admiral Michael J. Connor because of a loss of confidence in Brookhart&#x27;s ability to command. Brookhart was replaced by Commander Chris Harkins, deputy commander of Submarine Squadron Eight.

A repair contract was awarded to General Dynamics. Repairs were initially expected to cost $37.4 million and be completed by January 2010. However, by November 2009, repair costs had already exceeded $100 million. Final repair cost was $120 million when &quot;Hartford&quot; returned to duty in February, 2011

===Modernization===
On 29 July 2022 a $698M contract was awarded to General Dynamics Electric Boat to repair and modernize the &quot;Hartford&quot;. 

==Service history==
&quot;Hartford&quot; took part in , surfacing through the Arctic ice on 21 March.

<text>Toni-Ville Henrik Virtanen (; born 17 July 1975), better known by his stage name Darude (), is a Finnish DJ and record producer from Eura, Satakunta. His music is characterised by its progressive/uplifting style. He started making music in 1995 and released the platinum-selling hit single &quot;Sandstorm&quot; in late 1999. His debut studio album, &quot;Before the Storm&quot;, was released on 18 September 2000, and sold 800,000 copies worldwide, earning Darude three Finnish Grammy Awards. It peaked at number one on Finland&#x27;s Official List and number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Electronic Albums chart in the United States. Darude&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Rush&quot;, reached number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance chart in 2003 and number 4 on weekly album chart in Finland.

His third studio album, &quot;Label This!&quot; was released in 2007. Though it did not chart as high as his previous albums, &quot;Gawker&quot; praised the album&#x27;s single &quot;In the Darkness&quot; as &quot;a floating, gossamer piece of trance music... it&#x27;s tightly composed, easy to dance to, and has a soaring, undeniable hook.&quot; In 2011, he co-founded the record label EnMass Music, through which he has released a number of mix compilations related to his radio show &quot;Salmiakki Sessions.&quot; After performing at festivals such as the tenth anniversary of Tomorrowland in 2014 and Future Music Festival in 2015, he released his most recent studio album, &quot;Moments&quot;, on August 14, 2015, followed by a tour of the United States and Canada in September 2015. He represented Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, alongside singer Sebastian Rejman, with the song &quot;Look Away&quot;.

==Career==

===1990s: Early years and &quot;Sandstorm&quot;===

Toni-Ville Henrik Virtanen was born on 17 July 1975, in the Finnish village of Hinnerjoki in Eura. Virtanen started his career as a musician while studying at Turku Polytechnic, making music using his PC&#x27;s tracker software. As his interest in music production rapidly grew, he moved on to more serious production techniques. While at a classmate&#x27;s party, Virtanen played the song &quot;Rude Boy&quot; (written by Swedish artist Leila K) several times in a row. This earned him the nickname &quot;Rude Boy,&quot; which gradually morphed into &quot;Da Rude&quot; and then &quot;Darude&quot;. Active in the Finnish music trance and house scene since 1995, Virtanen continued producing music into the 1990s. He began occasionally releasing demos to radio stations beginning in 1997, and offering his music for download on MP3.com, making him an early adopter of online file sharing for music promotion.

In 1999, he gave a demo for the track &quot;Sandstorm&quot; to his producer, JS16 (Jaakko Salovaara). Virtanen signed on with JS16&#x27;s 16 Inch Records label, and shortly thereafter, &quot;Sandstorm&quot; was released as a single. &quot;Sandstorm&quot; was a hit internationally, selling platinum and holding the No. 1 spot on the Finnish Dance Chart for seventeen consecutive weeks. After becoming the No. 3 single in the United Kingdom (becoming the first record by a Finnish artist to do so), &quot;Sandstorm&quot; eventually sold 2 million units worldwide, and was the world&#x27;s biggest selling 12-inch single in 2000. The song went on to be widely featured in the media, particularly at sporting events and on soundtracks for video games and television shows. Various videos and live streams of &quot;Sandstorm&quot; had gathered some 60 million hits by December 2014, and in October 2015, the track achieved platinum sales status in the UK as it surpassed 600,000 sales in the UK.

His first live gig was on 5 December 1999, in Tampere, Finland.

===2000–06: &quot;Before the Storm&quot; and &quot;Rush&quot;===

Darude&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Before the Storm&quot; was produced by JS16 (Jaakko Salovaara), and features two of JS16&#x27;s remixes. The album includes several singles, including &quot;Sandstorm.&quot; The second single &quot;Feel the Beat&quot; had replicated the success of &quot;Sandstorm&quot;, reaching No. 1 on the singles charts in Finland for 2 weeks and No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Before the Storm&quot; was released on September 5, 2000, and sold 800,000 copies worldwide, earning Darude three Finnish Grammy awards. It also peaked on a number of charts, including No. 1 on Finland&#x27;s Official List for albums, No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance/Electronic Albums chart and No. 11 on the US Independent Albums chart. It also charted at No. 9 in Sweden, No. 14 in Norway, and No. 18 in Canada, among other rankings. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release, Darude created a vocal edit of &quot;Out of Control&quot;, and released it as a single; &quot;Out of Control (Back for More)&quot;. This single also charted in major countries and was re-released on several editions of the album.

Darude began a world tour in 2001, releasing &quot;Before the Storm: Australian Tour Edition&quot; in the process. 2002 saw the release of &quot;Before the Storm: Special Edition&quot;, featuring a collection of remixes of Darude&#x27;s work.

After releasing the singles &quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Next to You&quot; in early 2003, in July of that year both tracks were included on Darude&#x27;s second album, &quot;Rush&quot;. The album reached No. 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Electronic Albums chart and No. 4 on weekly album chart in Finland, while &quot;Next to You&quot; charted at No. 1 on the Finnish singles chart. MacKenzie Wilson of Allmusic criticized the lack of variety between tracks but praised the release in general, writing that Darude &quot;builds upon the dynamics of &quot;Before the Storm&quot;, raises the pressure, and fuels the flame for an electrifying dozen-track set. Darude&#x27;s talent in keeping the energy at an elevated level without losing touch with the album&#x27;s overall ambience is what makes him a star and an integral part of the new-millennium dance scene. His classy of[sic] mix of techno and trance is perfected into a fashionably slick spiral of synthesized heat.&quot; After the release of &quot;Rush&quot; Darude maintained a heavy touring schedule, particularly the United States and Eastern Europe.

===2007–12: &quot;Label This!&quot; and EnMass Music===

His single &quot;Tell Me&quot; was released in Finland on April 11, 2007, and &quot;My Game&quot; on September 19, 2007. &quot;Label This!&quot; is the third studio album from Darude. Released on October 24, 2007, in Finland and on October 27 in Europe, the American edition was released in 2008, with the notable inclusion of Darude&#x27;s newest single, &quot;I Ran (So Far Away)&quot; featuring Blake Lewis, as the third track on the album. The album did not chart as high as Darude&#x27;s two previous album releases, though Gawker wrote that the album&#x27;s single &quot;In the Darkness&quot; &quot;is a floating, gossamer piece of trance music of the kind AraabMuzik spun into such magic on &quot;Electronic Dream&quot;. Like &#x27;Sandstorm,&#x27; it&#x27;s tightly composed, easy to dance to, and has a soaring, undeniable hook.&quot;
Darude was ranked No. 96 on the DJ List as of December 11, 2010 and No. 314 in the DJ Mag Top 100. He has also recently completed remixes for artists such as ATB and The Thrillseekers, with radio play from Radio 1 personalities such as Pete Tong, Judge Jules, Ferry Corsten, and Paul Oakenfold. Darude co-founded the record label EnMass Music in 2011. Through EnMass Music, Darude released a DJ mix compilation titled &quot;Salmiakki Sessions Vol. 1&quot; on December 20, 2011. The compilation is a reflection of his namesake radio mix show, and includes ten of his recent remix productions and eight of his track redone by Finnish artists and producers. Five of the tracks are previously unreleased exclusives for the compilation. He took part in a label showcase for EnMasse in Amsterdam in October 2012.

===2013–15: Touring and &quot;Moments&quot;===
Darude continued to tour into 2013, performing that year at the Groove Cruise out of Miami and playing two days of Tomorrowland in July 2014 in Belgium. In March 2015 he performed at Future Music Festival in Australia, playing at all five festival dates in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, also playing a variety of sideshows at clubs as part of the festival.
Darude&#x27;s most recent studio album, &quot;Moments&quot;, was his first full-length release in eight years. Guest artists included Caater and string band Apocalyptica, among others. The lead single from the album, &quot;Beautiful Alien,&quot; had previously charted at No. 1 on the Finnish iTunes charts, with a music video released as well in March 2015. &quot;Moments&quot; was officially released on August 14, 2015, through Warner Music Finland in Europe and overseas.

The album blends genres such as electro, progressive house, and We Rave You wrote that &quot;Darude&#x27;s ability is once again proven filling the spectrum from big-room to trance to dubstep-infused depth.&quot; The album&#x27;s mixing of genres was generally well-received, and Dancing Astronaut praised the release, writing that &quot;Darude’s return is a clear departure from what once defined him. In &quot;Moments&quot;, he steps outside the proverbial EDM box by toying around with a multitude of different styles, several of which appear simultaneously in each track.&quot; YourEDM opined that the album was &quot;gorgeous,&quot; explaining that it &quot;features a wide variety of influences and sounds&quot; with &quot;great production, atmospheres, and melodies riding alongside quaintly catchy vocals.&quot;

Shortly following the album&#x27;s release in September 2015, Darude embarked on a ten date tour of the United States and Canada, culminating in a performance at the inaugural TwitchCon, a gaming and tech convention organised by video streaming platform Twitch and held in San Francisco on September 25 and 26, 2015. With over 20,000 attendees over the weekend, Darude appeared as the headline DJ at the official afterparty, held in the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium on September 26, 2015, and also featuring a performance from deadmau5. In the run up to the event, Darude appeared as a guest in the deadmau5 Coffee Run series, chatting to the Canadian DJ about various topics while being driven in deadmau5&#x27;s Lamborghini Huracán supercar. deadmau5 noted that &quot;You [Darude] and a very select few others are responsible for the influx of electronic music into North America. It was &#x27;Sandstorm&#x27; – I&#x27;m totally being serious... that&#x27;s what all the clubs were hitting on. That&#x27;s the first time [electronic music] became less &#x27;underground and cool&#x27;... there wasn&#x27;t anything before that&quot;.

===2019: Eurovision Song Contest===

On January 29, 2019, Darude was announced as the Finnish representative for the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 in Tel Aviv, Israel. He performed alongside Sebastian Rejman, and his entry &quot;Look Away&quot; was decided in a special edition of &quot;Uuden Musiikin Kilpailu&quot;. They performed third in the first semi-final at Eurovision, but was placed last among the 17 countries competing in the semi-final, thus failing to qualify for the grand final.

<doc id="445891" wikidata="Q3600603" url="?curid=445891" title="ADRIFT">
<text>ADRIFT is a graphical user interface used to create and play text adventures. The name is an acronym for &quot;Adventure Development &amp; Runner - Interactive Fiction Toolkit&quot;. The project was solely developed by Campbell Wild until he made it open source in 2018. Since then, only minor contributions to the main programs (Developer and Runner) have been given by others, though there have been contributions elsewhere to alternative Runners and the default Standard Library. 

The toolkit consists of two programs; a developer (used to write games - known as the generator before ADRIFT 5), and a runner (used to play them), though the runner is available to download separately. In the current stable release (version 5.0.36), released in 2020, both programs only run on Microsoft Windows platforms as they are written in Visual Basic. ADRIFT started out as shareware. When ADRIFT 5 was released it became donationware until it became open source. For a while ADRIFT 5 was able to run on Linux using the Mono project but later updates did not work properly with Mono so these versions were skipped.

Coinciding with the 2011 Interactive Fiction competition, ADRIFT WebRunner was launched. This allows ADRIFT 5 games to be played online. Because the game runs server side, it allows games to be played on any device such as iPad. ADRIFT 5 went into Beta status as from 4 April 2011, where it became open for everyone to download.

Unlike many text adventure creation tools (such as TADS), the author needs little knowledge of how to program to use the ADRIFT Developer. Instead, the author is presented with a simple graphical interface with which to write their game. This allows for text adventures to be written more quickly by people who are primarily authors rather than programmers.

Two of the most critically acclaimed ADRIFT games to date are &quot;The PK Girl&quot;, which achieved 6th place in the Interactive Fiction Competition in 2002, and &quot;A Fine Day for Reaping&quot;, which took 7th place in the Interactive Fiction Competition and won the XYZZY Award for Best Story in 2007.

==Other Operating Systems==
Because ADRIFT only natively runs on Windows, many users on other operating systems are unable to run the original software. is an open-source Java application that runs ADRIFT 4 games. It allows anyone with a Java-enabled web browser regardless of platform to play ADRIFT games. Development of was discontinued in 2004. However, SCARE is an ANSI/ISO C secondary clone of and the project has resulted in the ability to play ADRIFT games on several platforms including Linux, Windows, DOS, Macintosh and Amiga. SCARE has become a standard interpreter in most multi-interpreter programs such as Gargoyle and Fabularium. Fabularium, furthermore, comes with an ADRIFT 5 interpreter called BEBEK. Furthermore, ADRIFT 5 games can be played on Linux and Mac using a new interpreter called FrankenDrift.

<doc id="445892" wikidata="Q2564297" url="?curid=445892" title="Earl of Orkney">
<text>Earl of Orkney, historically Jarl of Orkney, is a title of nobility encompassing the archipelagoes of Orkney and Shetland, which comprise the Northern Isles of Scotland. Originally founded by Norse invaders, the status of the rulers of the Northern Isles as Norwegian vassals was formalised in 1195. Although the Old Norse term &quot;jarl&quot; is etymologically related to &quot;earl&quot;, and the jarls were succeeded by earls in the late 15th century, a Norwegian &quot;jarl&quot; is not the same thing. In the Norse context the distinction between jarls and kings did not become significant until the late 11th century and the early jarls would therefore have had considerable independence of action until that time. The position of Jarl of Orkney was eventually the most senior rank in medieval Norway except for the king himself.

The jarls were periodically subject to the kings of Alba for those parts of their territory in what is now mainland Scotland (i.e. Caithness and Sutherland). In 1232, a Scottish dynasty descended from the mormaers of Angus replaced the previous family descended from the late 10th century jarl Torf-Einarr, although the isles remained formally subject to Norway. This family was in turn replaced by the descendants of the mormaers of Strathearn and later still by the Sinclair family, during whose time Orkney and Shetland became part of Scotland.

The second earldom was created by James VI of Scotland in 1581 for his half-uncle Robert Stewart but after only two incumbents the title was forfeited in 1614. After the third creation of 1696, which title still exists today, the earls&#x27; influence on Orcadian affairs became negligible.

==Norse Jarls==

Rognvald Eysteinsson, Jarl of Møre 865–890 is sometimes credited with being the founder of the jarldom. By implication the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; identifies him as such for he is given &quot;dominion&quot; over Orkney and Shetland by King Harald Finehair, although there is no concrete suggestion he ever held the title. The &quot;Heimskringla&quot; states that his brother Sigurd was the first to formally hold the title.

Sigurd&#x27;s son Guthorm ruled for a year and died childless. Rognvald&#x27;s son Hallad then inherited the title. However, unable to constrain Danish raids on Orkney, he gave up the jarldom and returned to Norway, which &quot;everyone thought was a huge joke&quot;. Torf-Einarr then succeeded in defeating the Danes and founded a dynasty which retained control of the islands for centuries after his death. Smyth concludes that the role of the brothers Eysteinsson lacks historical credibility and that Torf-Einarr “may be regarded as the first historical earl of Orkney”.

Drawing on Adam of Bremen&#x27;s assertion that Orkney was not conquered until the time of Harald Hardrada, who ruled Norway from 1043 to 1066, Woolf speculates that Sigurd “the Stout” Hlodvirsson, Torf-Einarr&#x27;s great-grandson, may have been the first Jarl of Orkney. Dates are largely conjectural, at least until his death recorded in 1014.

Assuming Torf-Einarr is a genuine historical figure, all of the subsequent jarls were descended from him, save for Sigurd Magnusson, whose short rule was imposed by his father Magnus Barelegs, and who later became Sigurd I of Norway.

One of the main sources for the lives and times of these jarls is the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, which has been described as having &quot;no parallel in the social and literary record of Scotland&quot;. One of the key events of the saga is the &quot;martyrdom&quot; of Jarl Magnus Erlendsson, later Saint Magnus, . The last quarter of the saga is taken up with a lengthy tale of Jarl Rögnvald Kali Kolsson and Sweyn Asleifsson — indeed the oldest version ends with the latter&#x27;s death in 1171.

After the murder of Jarl Jon Haraldsson some sixty years later, Magnus, son of Gille Brigte became the first of the Scottish earls. He may have been a descendant of Jarl Rögnvald Kali Kolsson, although this has never been corroborated. However, the line of specifically Norse jarls is said to have come to an end when Jarl Magnus II was granted his title by Haakon IV of Norway .

==Scottish Jarls under the Norwegian Crown==

After the close of the &quot;Jarls&#x27; Saga&quot; on the death of Jon Haraldsson in 1230, the history of Orkney is &quot;plunged into a darkness which is illuminated by very few written sources&quot;. The first &quot;jarl&quot; known to have held the title after the Norse dynasty came to and end in 1230 was Magnus II but the title may have been held by an unknown other prior to his investiture. Although successive jarls of Orkney were related, they each acquired the position by being personally appointed to the role by the Norwegian king; the jarldom was not inheritable.

===The Angus Jarls===
===Strathearn and Sinclair Jarls===
The lack of haste with which a new title was granted by the Norwegians to Orkney has led to the suggestion that Magnus Jonsson may have had an heir who was a minor, but who died before 1330. It is also likely that unravelling the genealogy of his potential successors and providing proofs of their descent was a time-consuming project. Whatever the reason, about a decade after Magnus&#x27;s death the title was granted to Maol Íosa, mormaer of Strathearn, a distant relative of Earl Gilbert. He ruled Orkney and Caithness from 1330 to 1350 and had several daughters, but no sons.

The earldom was then left vacant for about three years, following which Erengisle Sunesson was a titular earl for a few years but when his right to the title lapsed prior to 1360 the jarldom lay vacant again. King Haakon VI of Norway had married Margaret, the daughter of King Valdemar IV of Denmark. The sudden death of Haakon&#x27;s brother King Eric XII of Sweden triggered the foreign policy obligations Haakon had to Valdemar, as a result of the marriage. These drew Haakon&#x27;s attention away from Orkney, until the death of Valdemar, in 1375.

In 1375, Haakon decided upon Alexander of Ard, the son of Maol Íosa&#x27;s daughter Matilda and Weland of Ard (Aird, west of Inverness) as Sunesson&#x27;s successor. However, Alexander was merely appointed &quot;Lieutenant, Captain and Keeper&quot; of Orkney for a year on 30 June 1375. This was to be a probationary role, the intention being that if Haakon had been satisfied by Alexander&#x27;s behaviour after a year, he would be appointed as &quot;jarl&quot;. However, Haakon did not do so, possibly because Alexander failed to deal with the violence that had become rife during the long absence of an earl&#x27;s authority. In 1379, the jarldom was granted to another grandson of Maol Íosa, Henry Sinclair, by Haakon VI on 2 August 1379.

When James III of Scotland married Margaret of Denmark, her father, Christian I, king of the Kalmar Union, was unable to immediately provide a dowry. Instead, he promised that he would provide the dowry at a later date, and pledged the Norðreyjar as security for his promise. In 1470, James persuaded William to quitclaim his rights over Orkney and Shetland only, in return for lands in Fife; technically the Norðreyjar remained in existence as a Norwegian Jarldom, but William&#x27;s authority became limited to the mainland parts, while Orkney and Sheltland became jarl-free. After a few years, it became clear that the dowry was unlikely ever to be paid, so in 1472, James declared the Norðreyjar to be forfeit (and forwent the dowry). As an immediate consequence, the diocese of Caithness was transferred from the Archdiocese of Niðaróss (Trondheim), in Norway, to that of St Andrews, in Scotland.

==Scottish Earls==
===Dukes of Orkney===
* The next Orkney title was the dukedom of Orkney, which was given to James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1567. Later that year, however, he forfeited the title when Mary was forced to abdicate.

===Earls of Orkney, Second Creation===
The second earldom was created by James VI of Scotland. The Stewart earls were based at Kirkwall Castle, which had been built by Henry I Sinclair. It was demolished on the forfeiture of the title in 1614.

===Earls of Orkney, Third Creation (1696)===

The last creation of the earldom was in favour of the man who in 1735 would become the first Field Marshal of Great Britain, Lord George Hamilton, the fifth son of William Douglas, Duke of Hamilton. The peerage was created with &quot;remainder to the heirs whatsoever of his body&quot;, meaning that the title can be passed on through both male and female lines. The title passed to the O&#x27;Brien family, then to the Fitzmaurice family, and later to the St John family. The subsidiary titles of Viscount of Kirkwall and Lord Dechmont were created at the same time as the earldom.

None of these earls appear to have any connection with Orkney other than the honorific itself. The current earl, for example, was born and lives in Canada.

The 9th Earl is the son of Frederick Oliver St John, son of Isabella Annie Fitzmaurice, daughter of James Terence Fitzmaurice, fifth son of the fifth Earl. The heir apparent is the present holder&#x27;s son Oliver Robert St John (b. 1969), who holds the courtesy title, Viscount Kirkwall.

Earl of Orkney is also a separate, non-peerage earldom in the Baronage of Scotland. An earl in the Baronage of Scotland is also always a Scots baron.

<doc id="445895" wikidata="Q4366137" url="?curid=445895" title="Escape to Witch Mountain (1995 film)">
<text>Escape to Witch Mountain is a 1995 American fantasy-adventure television film written and directed by Peter Rader. It is a remake of the 1975 film of the same name. The film was announced by American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in September 1994, as the third of four Disney film remakes to air on the channel, the other three being &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot;, &quot;The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes&quot;, and &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;. The film was produced by Walt Disney Television and premiered on ABC on April 29, 1995, as an ABC Family Movie.

== Plot ==
On the outskirts of a small town there is a rock formation called Witch Mountain rumored to possess mysterious powers. A young waitress, Zoe Moon, witnesses infant twin children Anna and Danny appear behind the diner in a pillar of purple light, causing her to faint from shock. When a local hermit named Bruno finds them in the bed of his truck, he moves Anna to the back of another nearby truck but is seen by Sheriff Bronson while carrying Danny and is told to freeze. The truck containing Anna drives away before she is noticed, separating the two.

Danny spends the next nine years of his life between foster families and frequently runs away. After his latest attempt is thwarted, his frustrated social worker decides to leave him at an orphanage run by Lindsay Brown. He is reunited with Anna when she saves him from Xander, an older boy at the orphanage who has a soft spot for Anna. Neither Danny or Anna are initially aware of their relationship, despite performing identical odd mannerisms. However, their newly found proximity to one another reawakens their supernatural powers and they realize that they are siblings. When Edward Bolt, a local magnate seeking to develop the nearby Witch Mountain, notices their powers, he decides to care for both of them as their foster father. Though Danny is happy with the development because he has his sister and a nice home, Anna is apprehensive about being adopted by Bolt and befriends Bolt&#x27;s chauffeur, Luthor, who feels he has a connection to the twins.

During one of their outings to a purple general store, Anna uses her telekinetic abilities and catches the attention of the store&#x27;s owner, Waldo Fudd. Waldo reveals he has the same abilities they do and that they are extraterrestrials from another world where everyone has a twin. When they came to Earth to explore, everyone separated due to the quarrels they experienced on Earth. Waldo has been working to reunite them all and take them home. Meanwhile, Zoe sees the purple light from the front of the shop and recognizes it and confronts Waldo to discover the fate of the twins she saw years earlier. Though he dismisses her claims, Waldo leaves her clues regarding Anna and Danny&#x27;s fates if she wishes to help them.

Bolt reveals his true intention to exploit the twins&#x27; power to blast open Witch Mountain without explosives in order to obtain its valuable rock material, despite Waldo&#x27;s protest that the mountain must not be tampered with. Anna discovers the truth and telepathically warns Danny, only to be held hostage by Bolt so that Danny will do as he asks. The twins are rescued by a repentant Xander, and escape to Waldo&#x27;s shop on a horse that Danny communicates with to help them. Lindsay becomes suspicious of Bolt when he sends the police to retrieve the children from the shop.

Zoe and Bruno help Danny and Anna escape to Witch Mountain after the twins levitate Bruno&#x27;s truck, while Bolt is arrested by Bronson after Luthor exposes Bolt&#x27;s plot. At Witch Mountain, Waldo and the other reunited twins await Anna and Danny so they can all return home. The last set of twins arrive soon after—Bruno and Luthor. Using Waldo and his twin&#x27;s power on their home world, all of the twins return home in pairs, with Anna and Danny going last to close the gate between their home world and Earth. Waldo casually comments that he will be waiting for the next group of tourists, while Anna and Danny float up into the purple smoke to Witch Mountain. Zoe narrates that Witch Mountain is not haunted but has light in it.

<text>William de Sancto Claro, or simply William Sinclair († 1337), was a 14th-century bishop of Dunkeld. He was the son of Amicia de Roskelyn and Sir William Sinclair, Baron of Roslin. He was the brother of Sir Henry Sinclair, baron of Roslin. After the death of Bishop Matthew de Crambeth in 1309, William was elected to the bishopric. The following year, on 24 February 1310, William was one of twelve Scottish bishops to swear fealty to King Robert the Brus. However, king Edward II of England had his own candidate in mind, John de Leck. William went to the Holy See, where his election was contested by the said John. The diocese of Dunkeld lay vacant for three years. Pope Clement V appointed Cardinal James, cardinal deacon of St George in Velabro, to judge the issue. However, the issue was more or less resolved when, on 22 May 1311, John de Leck was promoted to the Archbishopric of Dublin. When John de Leck took over the see of Dublin on 20 July, he retired from the dispute. The pope then declared William&#x27;s election canonical, and sent him to Cardinal Berengar Fredol, bishop of Tusculum, in order to be consecrated. On 3 February 1313 king Edward II issued a safe-conduct to William, clearly indicating that the bishop was planning to arrive in England on his way back to Scotland, however Edward demanded cooperation in political matters as a condition. William became a frequent witness to King Robert&#x27;s charters, but that did not prevent Bishop William, on 24 September 1332, being present at the coronation of Edward Balliol. Bishop William attended the latter&#x27;s parliaments. William died on 27 June 1337, and was buried in the choir of Dunkeld Cathedral.

<text>David A. Kay (June 8, 1940 – August 13, 2022) was an American weapons expert, political commentator, and senior fellow at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies. He was best known for his time as United Nations Chief Weapons Inspector following the first Gulf War and for leading the Iraq Survey Group&#x27;s search for weapons of mass destruction following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Upon presentation of the Group&#x27;s finding that there had been significant errors in pre-war intelligence concerning Iraq&#x27;s weapons programs, Kay resigned. The ensuing controversy served as impetus for the formation of the Iraq Intelligence Commission.

==Education==
Kay received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Texas at Austin, and also a master&#x27;s in International Affairs and a Ph.D. from Columbia University&#x27;s School of International and Public Affairs.

Kay was an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin (Madison). Kay later worked for the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in an administrative position as head of the Evaluation Section and, as recommended by the US Mission to that Agency, he was named the UN Chief Weapons Inspector from 1991 to 1992. Following that, he was a Vice President at Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) from 1993 to 2002. He was then appointed a Special Advisor for Strategy regarding Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Programs. He received the International Atomic Energy Agency&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award and the U.S. Secretary of State&#x27;s Commendation.

After the 1991 Gulf War, Kay led teams of inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Iraq to search out and destroy banned chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons. Following the U.S. invasion of Iraq, he returned to the country, working with the Central Intelligence Agency and U.S. military in 2003 and 2004 to determine if Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime had continued developing banned weapons.

== Iraq Survey Group ==

The research of his team determined that the Iraqi unconventional weapons programs had mostly been held in check, with only small amounts of banned material uncovered (this included a number of vials containing biological agents stored in the home refrigerators of Iraqi scientists, for example). None of these substances had been &quot;weaponized&quot; — no such agents were found in missiles or artillery, and none could be easily installed. These discoveries indicate that some of the primary reasons President George W. Bush used for going to war with Iraq did not reflect the true situation in that country, and contradicted statements made by Kay himself in the lead-up to the war.

Before the 2003 war, as U.S. Government officials were pushing the idea that Saddam Hussein was in possession of WMD, many people would direct reporters toward David Kay to reinforce their point of view. In September 2002, Kay told &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; that &quot;Iraq stands in clear violation of international orders to rid itself of these weapons.&quot; His credibility as a former U.N. weapons inspector convinced many observers.

On January 23, 2004, Kay resigned, stating that Iraq did not have WMD and that &quot;I think there were stockpiles at the end of the first Gulf War and a combination of U.N. inspectors and unilateral Iraqi action got rid of them.&quot; Kay was replaced by Charles Duelfer and spent the following days discussing his discoveries and opinions with the news media and the U.S. political establishment. On January 28, 2004, he testified that “[i]t turns out that we were all wrong” and “I believe that the effort that has been directed to this point has been sufficiently intense that it is highly unlikely that there were large stockpiles of deployed, militarized chemical weapons there.” However, Kay defended the Bush administration, saying that even &quot;if&quot; Iraq did not have weapons stockpiles, this did not mean that it wasn&#x27;t dangerous. Kay also blamed faulty intelligence gathering for the prewar WMD conclusions. On February 2, 2004, Kay met with George W. Bush at the White House and maintained that Bush was right to go to war in Iraq and characterized Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government as “far more dangerous than even we anticipated” when it was thought he had WMDs ready to deploy.

=== Testimony before House and Senate committees ===
In testimony on the progress of the Iraq Survey Group on October 2, 2003, he revealed to House and Senate committees that the ISG had found that Iraq had a network of clandestine laboratories containing equipment that should have been (but was not) disclosed to UN inspectors. He also said that the ISG found an undeclared prison laboratory complex and an undeclared Unmanned Aerial Vehicle production facility. The Iraq Survey Group also found out that a UAV had been test flown out to a range of 500 kilometers, even though the agreed upon limit was 150 kilometers. Kay said that Iraq lied to the UN about the range of that particular UAV.

He testified that Iraq had done research on Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever and Brucella but had not declared this to the UN. Iraq also continued research and development work on anthrax and ricin without declaring it to the UN.

Kay told the committees that, between 1999 and 2002, Iraq attempted to obtain missile technology from North Korea that would allow them to build missiles with a range of 1300 kilometers, far beyond the UN limit of 150 kilometers that Iraq agreed upon in UN Resolution 687. They also sought anti-ship missiles with a range of 300 kilometers from North Korea.

&quot;With regard to delivery systems, the ISG team has discovered sufficient evidence to date to conclude that the Iraqi regime was committed to delivery system improvements that would have, if OIF had not occurred, dramatically breached UN restrictions placed on Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War,&quot; Kay testified.

=== Subsequent interviews ===
After the interview, Kay told National Public Radio that Iraq &quot;had a large number of WMD program-related activities.&quot; He said &quot;So there was a WMD program. It was going ahead. It was rudimentary in many areas.&quot; Kay also said that Iraq had been trying to weaponize ricin &quot;right up until&quot; Operation Iraqi Freedom; a claim not supported by the Iraq Survey Group final report.

=== Resignation ===
On January 23, 2004, the head of the ISG, David Kay, resigned his position, stating that he believed WMD stockpiles would not be found in Iraq. &quot;I don&#x27;t think they existed,&quot; commented Kay. &quot;What everyone was talking about is stockpiles produced after the end of the last Gulf War and I don&#x27;t think there was a large-scale production program in the nineties.&quot; In a briefing to the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), Kay criticized the pre-war WMD intelligence and the agencies that produced it, saying &quot;It turns out that we were all wrong, probably in my judgment, and that is most disturbing.&quot; Sometime earlier, CIA director George Tenet had asked David Kay to delay his departure: &quot;If you resign now, it will appear that we don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;re doing. That the wheels are coming off.&quot;

Kay told the SASC during his oral report the following, though: &quot;Based on the intelligence that existed, I think it was reasonable to reach the conclusion that Iraq posed an imminent threat. Now that you know reality on the ground as opposed to what you estimated before, you may reach a different conclusion — although I must say I actually think what we learned during the inspection made Iraq a more dangerous place, potentially, than, in fact, we thought it was even before the war.&quot;

Kay&#x27;s team established that the Iraqi regime had the production capacity and know-how to produce chemical and biological weaponry if international economic sanctions were lifted, a policy change which was actively being sought by a number of United Nations member states. Kay also believed some components of the former Iraqi regime&#x27;s WMD program had been moved to Syria shortly before the 2003 invasion, though the Duelfer Report Addenda (see below) later reported there was no evidence of this.

Kay explained the situation in Iraq before the war further in a February 1, 2004 interview on Fox News Sunday: &quot;I think Iraq was a dangerous place and becoming more dangerous, because, in fact, what we observe is that the regime itself was coming apart. It was descending into worse the part of moral depravity and corruption. Saddam was isolated in a fantasy land capable of wreaking tremendous harm and terror on his individual citizens, but corruption, money gain was the root cause. At the same time that we know there were terrorist groups in state still seeking WMD capability. Iraq, although I found no weapons, had tremendous capabilities in this area. A marketplace phenomena was about to occur, if it did not occur; sellers meeting buyers. And I think that would have been very dangerous if the war had not intervened.&quot; [sic] 

On February 6, 2004, George W. Bush convened the Iraq Intelligence Commission, an independent inquiry into the intelligence used to justify the Iraq war and the failure to find WMD. This was shortly followed by the conclusion of a similar inquiry in the United Kingdom, the Butler Review, which was boycotted by the two main opposition parties due to disagreements on its scope and independence.([4]) In 2003, the US-sponsored search for WMD had been budgeted for $400 million, with an additional $600 million added in 2004.

Kay&#x27;s successor, named by CIA Director George Tenet, was former UN weapons inspector Charles Duelfer, who stated at the time that the chances of finding any WMD stockpiles in Iraq were &quot;close to nil.&quot;

==Personal life==
Kay was born in Houston, Texas. He retired to Ocean View, Delaware, with his wife. He died of cancer on August 13, 2022, at his home. He is survived by his second wife, a daughter from his first marriage, and two grandchildren.

<doc id="445901" wikidata="Q157508" url="?curid=445901" title="Prunus laurocerasus">
<text>Prunus laurocerasus, also known as cherry laurel, common laurel and sometimes English laurel in North America, is an evergreen species of cherry (&quot;Prunus&quot;), native to regions bordering the Black Sea in southwestern Asia and southeastern Europe, from Albania and Bulgaria east through Turkey to the Caucasus Mountains and northern Iran.

The common names of &quot;P. laurocerasus&quot; refer to the similarity of foliage and appearance to bay laurel (&quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;, the true laurel, in the family Lauraceae), and like the bay laurel, &quot;Prunus laurocerasus&quot; was used for making laurel wreaths, but the two plants are not closely related. It is not to be confused with its American relative &quot;Prunus caroliniana&quot;, which is also called cherry laurel.

==Description==
&quot;Prunus laurocerasus&quot; is an evergreen shrub or small to medium-sized tree, growing to tall, rarely to , with a trunk up to 60 cm broad. The leaves are dark green, leathery, shiny, (5–)10–25(–30) cm long and 4–10 cm broad, with a finely serrated margin. The leaves can have the scent of almonds when crushed. The flower buds appear in early spring and open in early summer in erect 7–15 cm racemes of 30–40 flowers, each flower 1 cm across, with five creamy-white petals and numerous yellowish stamens with a sweet smell. The fruit is a small cherry 1–2 cm broad, turning black when ripe in early autumn.

==Cultivation==

&quot;Prunus laurocerasus&quot; is a widely cultivated ornamental plant, used for planting in gardens and parks in temperate regions worldwide. It is often used for hedges, as a screening plant, and as a massed landscape plant. Most cultivars are tough shrubs that can cope with difficult growing conditions, including shaded and dry conditions, and which respond well to pruning.

===Cultivars===
Over 40 cultivars have been selected, including
* &#x27;Aureovariegata&#x27;, variegated, leaves with a yellow margin
* &#x27;Magnifolia&#x27;, vigorous, with great leaves up to 30-cm wide and 11-cm broad
* &#x27;Otto Luyken&#x27; (named after Otto Luyken), half-dwarf, with small leaves 10-cm wide and 2–3-cm broad
* &#x27;Schipkaensis&#x27;
* &#x27;Zabeliana&#x27;, selected for winter cold tolerance

The cultivar &#x27;Otto Luyken&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.
==Invasive species==
It has become naturalised widely. In some regions (such as the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man and the Pacific Northwest of North America), this species can be an invasive plant. Its rapid growth, coupled with its evergreen habit and its tolerance of drought and shade, often allow it to out-compete and kill off native plant species. It is spread by birds, through the seeds in their droppings.

==Habitat==
The species is found in woods and in shrubbery places as an escape in Northern Ireland and commonly planted in parks and gardens.

The species that are mainly found in Turkey&#x27;s Eastern Black Sea Region (mainly Trabzon and Giresun) are categorized as endemic plants.

==Other uses==
The foliage is also used for cut greenery in floristry.
The fruits are astringent but edible. They contain small amounts of hydrogen cyanide; any fruit tasting bitter (which indicates larger concentrations of hydrogen cyanide) should not be eaten. The seed inside the fruit (and the leaves) contain larger concentrations of hydrogen cyanide, and should never be eaten. The toxicity of the seed inside the fruit is similar to the cyanide toxicity of the seeds inside the common fruits apricot and peach.

==Toxicity==
Leaves and seed may cause severe discomfort, and death, to humans if ingested. Historically, it was used for execution and political assassination in the Roman empire (e.g. Nero). The seeds contained within the cherries are poisonous like the rest of the plant, containing cyanogenic glycosides and amygdalin. This chemical composition is what gives the smell of almonds when the leaves are crushed. Laurel water, a distillation made from the plant, contains prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide) and other compounds and is toxic.

== Wood ==
Cherry laurel wood contains a lot of water. It tends to gum up blades while cutting. It tends to split and distort while drying.

The freshly cut wood is creamy white and smells of almonds, It turns to orange and brown when dried.

Sections that are large enough in diameter may be used to turn bowls.

==Similar species==
&quot;Prunus lusitanica&quot;, Portuguese laurel, is similar in appearance, but may be distinguished by its sharply toothed leaves and red petioles.

<text>Thomas Temple Ellard (born 1962) is an Australian electronic musician best known as the founding member of the electronic and industrial music group Severed Heads.

==Early life==
Ellard&#x27;s first music contributions began in the late 1970s as a teenager when he was influenced by groups that emerged from the early United Kingdom and Australian punk movement.

Predating music technology such as MIDI and personal computers, Ellard&#x27;s early work was performed with tape machines, tape loops and basic analogue equipment. In 1979, Richard Fielding and Andrew Wright formed an electronic dance group called Mr. and Mrs. No Smoking Sign, and they were soon joined by Ellard.

==Career==
Fielding renamed the group Severed Heads. Through the 1980s, Ellard began to take advantage of technological developments such as the music sequencer in combination with looping sounds before sampling arose. Severed Heads were probably most well known in Australia for chart success with a 1994 remix of the track &quot;Dead Eyes Opened&quot; (initially released in the early 1980s), which made the Australian top 40. Ellard is also noted for his early contributions to the electronic and industrial music movements in Australia and overseas.

In 2013, Ellard created the interactive game &quot;Hauntology House&quot;. He has expressed interest in the computer-gaming platform many times in interviews.

==Awards==
In 2005, Ellard received the Australian Record Industry Association&#x27;s ARIA Music Award for the best original soundtrack/cast/show for the soundtrack to the Australian film &quot;The Illustrated Family Doctor&quot;.

==Personal life==
, Ellard resides in Surry Hills, Sydney and continues to record music and soundtracks. He also lectures at a variety of educational facilities on music production in Australia. He is the creator and director of sevcom.com, a website for alternative methods of music distribution and creation.

<doc id="445912" wikidata="Q1277407" url="?curid=445912" title="Earl of Rosebery">
<text>Earl of Rosebery is a title in the Peerage of Scotland created in 1703 for Archibald Primrose, 1st Viscount of Rosebery, with remainder to his issue male and female successively. Its name comes from Roseberry Topping, a hill near Archibald&#x27;s wife&#x27;s estates in Yorkshire. The current earl is Harry Primrose, 8th Earl of Rosebery.

==History==
Archibald, the first Earl, was the fourth and youngest son of Sir Archibald Primrose, 1st Baronet, a Lord of Session under the title Lord Carrington, whose eldest son William was the father of James Primrose, who was created Viscount of Primrose in 1703. Archibald had already been created Lord Primrose and Dalmeny and Viscount of Rosebery in 1700, with remainder to his issue male and female successively, and in default thereof to the heirs of entail in the lands of Rosebery, and was made Lord Dalmeny and Viscount of Inverkeithing at the same time as he was given the earldom (and with similar remainders). These titles were also in the Peerage of Scotland.

He was succeeded by his son, James Primrose, the second Earl. In 1741, on the death of his cousin Hugh Primrose, 3rd Viscount Primrose, he succeeded as fifth Baronet, of Carrington (see the Viscount of Primrose, which title became extinct on the death of the third Viscount, for earlier history of the baronetcy). His son, Neil Primrose, the third Earl, sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1768 to 1784. He was succeeded by his son, Archibald John Primrose, the fourth Earl. He represented Helston and Cashel in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom and served as Lord Lieutenant of Linlithgowshire. In 1828 he was created Baron Rosebery, of Rosebery in the County of Edinburgh, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords.

His grandson, Archibald Philip Primrose, the fifth Earl (the son of Archibald Primrose, Lord Dalmeny), was a prominent Liberal politician. He served as Foreign Secretary in 1886 and between 1892 and 1894 and as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom between 1894 and 1895. In 1911 he was honoured when he was created Baron Epsom, of Hyde in the County of Surrey, Viscount Mentmore, of Mentmore in the County of Buckingham, and Earl of Midlothian, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Rosebery was married to Hannah de Rothschild, the wealthy daughter and heiress of Baron Mayer Amschel de Rothschild.

Their eldest son, Albert Edward Harry Primrose, the sixth Earl, represented Midlothian in Parliament from 1906 to 1910 but then did not take an active part in politics until the 1940s, when he served in Winston Churchill&#x27;s 1945 caretaker government as Secretary of State for Scotland. He was also Chairman of the National Liberal Party from 1945 to 1947. Since 2024 the titles are held by his grandson, the eighth Earl.

The heir apparent to the earldom is usually styled &quot;Lord Dalmeny&quot;, but the current Earl, while heir apparent to his father, the sixth Earl, was styled &quot;Lord Primrose&quot; instead, to avoid using the same courtesy title as his elder half-brother Ronald, who had been styled &quot;Lord Dalmeny&quot; before his death in 1931. The current heir has returned to the usual practice and is styled &quot;Lord Dalmeny&quot;.

The family seat is Dalmeny House, near Dalmeny, City of Edinburgh, in Scotland, and until 1977 also resided at Mentmore Towers, near Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, in England.

<doc id="445913" wikidata="Q16249890" url="?curid=445913" title="Higher Education Act 2004">
<text>The Higher Education Act 2004 (c. 8) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that introduced several changes to the higher education system in the United Kingdom, the most important and controversial being a major change to the funding of universities, and the operation of tuition fees, which affects England and Wales. University funding is a devolved matter for Northern Ireland and Scotland. After complex and controversial debates, the Higher Education Bill received royal assent on 1 July 2004.

==Background and political importance==
Until 1998, all education in the United Kingdom was free up to and including university courses. However, shortly after coming to power, the Labour Party under Prime Minister Tony Blair abolished the student maintenance grant system and introduced an up-front fee fixed at just over £1,000 per year for all university students. Up to a quarter of this fee was waived for the poorest students, but many maintained that education should remain a free public service, and that the system would place students in unnecessary levels of debt. The government, however, insisted that fees were the best means of providing university funding. At the same time, they stated that their aim was to increase the proportion of students going on to Higher Education to 50% by 2010.

In the years that followed, it became clear that the original fixed fees of around £1,000 per year were still not providing enough funding, leading to proposals of what are often referred to as &quot;top-up fees&quot;. The idea was that universities would be able to &quot;top up&quot; the fees to a level that more accurately reflected the funding they needed. However, widespread protests led the Labour Party to make a manifesto pledge at the 2001 general election not to introduce such a system.

In 2003, a new set of proposals was drafted, which were denounced by some as breaking that promise. Although the government tried to create a compromise that would raise the necessary funds in a fair way, the issue remained highly contentious. Despite vocal opposition within his own party, Tony Blair claimed that this proposal was the only way to secure the necessary funds, and the issue was seen as a key test of his leadership. The initial vote in the House of Commons, on 27 January 2004, came a day before the result of the Hutton Inquiry, and it was predicted that a bad result from one or both would lead to Blair&#x27;s resignation as Prime Minister. The Bill was passed at the first vote, known as &quot;second reading&quot;, by 316 votes to 311, with 71 Labour MPs voting against.

The Bill faced further opposition as it progressed through Parliament. There was some controversy regarding the appointment of mainly loyalist MPs to the Standing Committee assigned to review the Bill. Of the 16 Labour MPs on the committee, only one voted against the government at second reading, and one abstained, suggesting that little criticism was likely during this stage. It then returned to the floor of the Commons for the Report stage. The main opposition to the bill from Labour backbenchers concerned the &quot;variable&quot; or &quot;top-up&quot; fees, therefore an amendment tabled at Report stage to remove references to these variable fees appeared to have some chance of succeeding. In addition, some backbenchers were promised further concessions and changes to the Bill, and therefore voted in favour at the second reading. If these promises had been felt to have been broken, these members might well have vote against the Bill at &quot;third reading&quot;.

Additionally, if the Bill had been successfully passed at third reading, it would have moved to the House of Lords, where the Government did not have a majority, and where for this particular Bill, the Salisbury Convention – according to which legislation included in the manifesto of the ruling party should not be opposed – would not have applied. This is because the policy was not included in the Labour party manifesto in 2001 – and some would argue it went against the line reading &quot;We will not introduce top-up fees and have legislated to prevent them&quot;. Therefore, it is quite possible that the Lords would have rejected the bill outright, which would have meant that the government would have had to table the Bill again in the next session of Parliament, and would possibly have had to use the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 in order to force it through Parliament and gain royal assent. Alternatively, the Lords could have passed a &quot;wrecking amendment&quot; which would have needed to be reversed by the House of Commons.

==Details of the proposed changes to funding==
The Act incorporates several key changes to the financial arrangements of higher education students, including many additional terms that were added to convince those who opposed earlier drafts. The changes took effect in 2006, and apply to England and Wales.
*Up-front fees to be replaced by an income-linked deferred payment. Instead of having to pay each year while studying, students are to be loaned the funds by the government and repayments will be made out of income once the graduate is earning more than £15000 per year. The loan is charged at the Retail Prices Index (United Kingdom) rate.
**The payment rates will be entirely earnings based, so that as a graduate&#x27;s salary fluctuates, so will their fee payments. If their salary falls below £15000, no payments will be taken.
**Additionally, any amount of a student&#x27;s fees still outstanding after 25 years will be cancelled.
*Fixed rate of £1125 to be replaced by variable fees between 0 and £3000. Since different courses cost different amounts of money to run, it is argued that students should pay different levels of fees. Under the new system, universities will be able to set the level of the fees for each course, within a given range.
**Although the change does represent a significant increase in the level of fees, some universities had called for much higher rates – in some cases up to £12000 a year. Furthermore, the top rate cannot be increased without a motion being passed in both Houses of Parliament, and the government has promised not to propose such a motion before 2009, assuaging fears that it would rise dramatically soon after the legislation was passed.
**In order to charge more than the basic amount (equivalent to the current fixed rate), a university will have to produce an appropriate &quot;plan&quot;, which may have to include details of how students from poorer backgrounds will be encouraged to participate. These plans will be subject to approval and review by a new body called the &quot;Office for Fair Access&quot; (&quot;OFFA&quot;, see &#x27;Other Provisions&#x27; below).
*Increased levels of financial aid. As part of the &quot;package&quot; of this reform, increased government grants, and bursaries set up by the universities themselves, will be put in place in such a way that the maximum allowance will equal the maximum fee – i.e. £3000 – for the poorest students. Presently, this will come from several sources, making it hard to understand, but plans to combine the various elements may still be introduced during the committee stage.

==Arguments in favour of the proposals==
The principal argument in favour of a new funding system is that British universities are currently critically underfunded, and an increased level of fees will result in a cash injection and prevent them collapsing. Additionally, much is made of the need for British institutions to be internationally &quot;competitive&quot; in terms of quality and resources, and that this is impossible to achieve without a reform of their funding.

A key player on this side of the argument is the Russell Group of Universities, who have argued that they should be able to charge much increased fees in order to differentiate themselves from smaller universities. This attitude has proved unpopular, as a two-tier system of this kind is widely viewed as unnecessary and damaging. The levels called for by this group far exceed the maximum rate currently proposed.

Further to this argument, it is argued that since studies show that most graduates earn more during their career than non-graduates, it is logical that they should be the ones to pay for this opportunity, not the public at large. Critics, however, have suggested that if this is the case, they will pay more income tax anyway, and that this would be a fairer source of the money. Some have also pointed out that the country as a whole benefits from an increased level of expertise, and therefore it is in everyone&#x27;s interests to pay for higher education.

==Arguments against the proposals==
The most common criticism of the proposals is that increasing tuition fees will increase the level of debt graduates will have when they leave. Organisations such as the National Union of Students have argued that students are already under too much financial pressure, and that this will make things worse, not better. Many students have had to take up part-time work in order to pay living costs while studying, and this has been shown to have an adverse effect on their results.

Although the Bill removes the need to pay fees up front – meaning that students may have more spending money while studying – it will still leave them with a greater debt at the start of their careers. While it was predicted that people from poorer backgrounds may be put off from enrolling for a degree because of the measure, the number of young people engaged in higher education has actually risen, most markedly in those coming from poorer backgrounds.

A second line of criticism is that the introduction of &quot;variable&quot; fees represents a step towards the privatisation of education, and makes degrees into products quite unnecessarily. Although not the intention of the legislation, there is likely to be a perceived trade-off between price and quality when choosing a degree. The strict limits imposed on fee levels limit this in practice, but the concept of competition remains. This is not, however, so relevant today as the vast majority of universities opt to charge the maximum £3,290 (2010 Entry).

==Other provisions in the Bill==
The Higher Education Bill also includes several less well-known provisions:
*Creation of an &quot;Office for Fair Access&quot; (&quot;OFFA&quot;) to oversee the approval and review of universities&#x27; plans with regards fees.
*Transfer of additional powers to the Welsh Assembly, including a separate equivalent to OFFA and the right to organise both student support and tuition fees independently.
*A new body for dealing with student complaints which universities will be legally bound to deal with.
*An &quot;Arts and Humanities Research Council&quot; equivalent to existing Science and Technology Councils, as a replacement for the current Arts and Humanities Research Board. This is the only aspect of the Act to directly affect Scotland and Northern Ireland

<doc id="445914" wikidata="Q2098047" url="?curid=445914" title="Sharecropping">
<text>Sharecropping is a legal arrangement in which a landowner allows a tenant (sharecropper) to use the land in return for a share of the crops produced on that land. Sharecropping is not to be conflated with tenant farming, providing the tenant a higher economic and social status.

Sharecropping has a long history and there are a wide range of different situations and types of agreements that have used a form of the system. Some are governed by tradition, and others by law. The French &quot;métayage&quot;, the Catalan &quot;masoveria&quot;, the Castilian &quot;mediero&quot;, the Slavic &quot;połownictwo&quot; and &quot;izdolshchina, the Italian mezzadria&quot;, and the Islamic system of &quot;muzara‘a&quot; (المزارعة), are examples of legal systems that have supported sharecropping.

==Overview==
Under a sharecropping system, landowners provided a share of land to be worked by the sharecropper, and usually provided other necessities such as housing, tools, seed, or working animals. Local merchants usually provide food and other supplies to the sharecropper on credit. In exchange for the land and supplies, the cropper would pay the owner a share of the crop at the end of the season, typically one-half to two-thirds. The cropper used his share to pay off their debt to the merchant. If there was any cash left over, the cropper kept it—but if their share came to less than what they owed, they remained in debt.

A new system of credit, the crop lien, became closely associated with sharecropping. Under this system, a planter or merchant extended a line of credit to the sharecropper while taking the year&#x27;s crop as collateral. The sharecropper could then draw food and supplies all year long. When the crop was harvested, the planter or merchants who held the lien sold the harvest for the sharecropper and settled the debt.

Sociologist Jeffery M. Paige made a distinction between centralized sharecropping found on cotton plantations and the decentralized sharecropping with other crops. The former is characterized by long lasting tenure. Tenants are tied to the landlord through the plantation store. This form of tenure tends to be replaced by paid salaries as markets penetrate. Decentralized sharecropping involves virtually no role for the landlord: plots are scattered, peasants manage their own labor and the landowners do not manufacture the crops. This form of tenure becomes more common when markets penetrate.

Farmers who farmed land belonging to others but owned their own mule and plow were called tenant farmers; they owed the landowner a smaller share of their crops, as the landowner did not have to provide them with as much in the way of supplies.

==Application by region==
Historically, sharecropping occurred extensively in Scotland, Ireland and colonial Africa. Use of the sharecropper system has also been identified in England (as the practice of &quot;farming to halves&quot;). It was widely used in the Southern United States during the Reconstruction era (1865–1877) that followed the American Civil War, which was economically devastating to the Southern states. It is still used in many rural poor areas of the world today, notably in Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh.

=== Africa ===
In settler colonies of colonial Africa, sharecropping was a feature of the agricultural life. White farmers, who owned most of the land, were frequently unable to work the whole of their farm for lack of capital. They, therefore, had African farmers to work the excess on a sharecropping basis.

In South Africa the 1913 Natives&#x27; Land Act outlawed the ownership of land by Africans in areas designated for white ownership and effectively reduced the status of most sharecroppers to tenant farmers and then to farm laborers. In the 1960s, generous subsidies to white farmers meant that most farmers could afford to work their entire farms, and sharecropping faded out.

The arrangement has reappeared in other African countries in modern times, including Ghana and Zimbabwe.

Economic historian Pius S. Nyambara argued that Eurocentric historiographical devices such as &quot;feudalism&quot; or &quot;slavery&quot; often qualified by weak prefixes like &quot;semi-&quot; or &quot;quasi-&quot; are not helpful in understanding the antecedents and functions of sharecropping in Africa.

===United States===

Prior to the Civil War, sharecropping is known to have existed in Mississippi and is believed to have been in place in Tennessee. However, it was not until the economic upheaval caused by the American Civil War and the end of slavery during and after Reconstruction that it became widespread in the South. It is theorized that sharecropping in the United States originated in the Natchez District, roughly centered in Adams County, Mississippi with its county seat, Natchez.

After the war, plantations and other lands throughout the South were seized by the federal government. In January 1865, General William T. Sherman issued Special Field Orders No. 15, which announced that he would temporarily grant newly freed families 40 acres of this seized land on the islands and coastal regions of Georgia. Many believed that this policy would be extended to all formerly enslaved people and their families as repayment for their treatment at the end of the war. In the summer of 1865, President Andrew Johnson, as one of the first acts of Reconstruction, instead ordered all land under federal control be returned to the owners from whom it had been seized.
Southern landowners thus found themselves with a great deal of land but no liquid assets to pay for labor. They also maintained the &quot;belief that gangs afforded the most efficient means of labor organization&quot;, something nearly all formerly enslaved people resisted. Preferring &quot;to organize themselves into kin groups&quot;, as well as &quot;minimize chances for white male-black female contact by removing their female kin from work environments supervised closely by whites&quot;, black southerners were &quot;determined to resist the old slave ways&quot;. Not with standing, many formerly enslaved people, now called freedmen, having no land or other assets of their own, needed to work to support their families. A sharecropping system centered on cotton, a major cash crop, developed as a result. Large plantations were subdivided into plots that could be worked by sharecroppers. Initially, sharecroppers in the American South were almost all formerly enslaved black people, but eventually cash-strapped indigent white farmers were integrated into the system. During Reconstruction, the federal Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau ordered the arrangements for freedmen and wrote and enforced their contracts.

American sharecroppers worked a section of the plantation independently. In South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi, the dominant crop was usually cotton. In other areas it could be tobacco, rice, or sugar. At harvest time the crop was sold and the cropper received half of cash paid for the crop on his parcel. Sharecroppers also often received their farming tools and all other goods from the landowner they were contracted with. Landowners dictated decisions relating to the crop mix, and sharecroppers were often in agreements to sell their portion of the crop back to the landowner, thus being subjected to manipulated prices. In addition to this, landowners, threatening to not renew the lease at the end of the growing season, were able to apply pressure to their tenants. Sharecropping often proved economically problematic, as the landowners held significant economic control.
In the Reconstruction Era, sharecropping was one of few options for penniless freedmen to support themselves and their families. Other solutions included the crop-lien system (where the farmer was extended credit for seed and other supplies by the merchant), a rent labor system (where the farmer rents the land but keeps their entire crop), and the wage system (worker earns a fixed wage but keeps none of their crop). Sharecropping as historically practiced in the American South was more economically productive than the gang system plantations using enslaved workers, though less productive than modern agricultural techniques.
Sharecropping continued to be a significant institution in many states for decades following the Civil War. By the early 1930s, there were 5.5 million white tenant farmers, sharecroppers, and mixed cropping/laborers in the United States; and 3 million Blacks. In Tennessee, sharecroppers operated approximately one-third of all farm units in the state in the 1930s, with white people making up two thirds or more of the sharecroppers. In Mississippi, by 1900, 36% of all white farmers were tenants or sharecroppers, while 85% of black farmers were. In Georgia, fewer than 16,000 farms were operated by black owners in 1910, while, at the same time, African-Americans managed 106,738 farms as tenants.

Around this time, sharecroppers began to form unions protesting against poor treatment, beginning in Tallapoosa County, Alabama in 1931 and Arkansas in 1934. Membership in the Southern Tenant Farmers Union included both blacks and poor whites, who used meetings, protests, and labor strikes to push for better treatment. The success of these actions frightened and enraged landlords, who responded with aggressive tactics. Landless farmers who fought the sharecropping system were socially denounced, harassed by legal and illegal means, and physically attacked by officials, landlords&#x27; agents, or in extreme cases, angry mobs. Sharecroppers&#x27; strikes in Arkansas and the Missouri Bootheel, the 1939 Missouri Sharecroppers&#x27; Strike, were documented in the newsreel &quot;Oh Freedom After While&quot;. The plight of a sharecropper was addressed in the song &quot;Sharecropper&#x27;s Blues&quot;, recorded by Charlie Barnet and His Orchestra in 1944.The sharecropping system in the U.S. increased during the Great Depression with the creation of tenant farmers following the failure of many small farms throughout the Dustbowl. Traditional sharecropping declined after mechanization of farm work became economical beginning in the late 1930s and early 1940s. As a result, many sharecroppers were forced off the farms, and migrated to cities to work in factories, or became migrant workers in the Western United States during World War II. By the end of the 1960s, sharecropping had disappeared in the United States.

=== Sharecropping and socioeconomic status ===
About two-thirds of sharecroppers were white, the rest black. Sharecroppers, the poorest of the poor, organized for better conditions. The racially integrated Southern Tenant Farmers Union made gains for sharecroppers in the 1930s. Sharecropping had diminished in the 1940s due to the Great Depression, farm mechanization, and other factors.

== Impacts ==
Sharecropping may have been harmful to tenants, with many cases of high interest rates, unpredictable harvests, and unscrupulous landlords and merchants often keeping tenant farm families severely indebted. The debt was often compounded year on year leaving the cropper vulnerable to intimidation and shortchanging. Nevertheless, it appeared to be inevitable, with no serious alternative unless the croppers left agriculture.

Landlords opt for sharecropping to avoid the administrative costs and shirking that occurs on plantations and haciendas. It is preferred to cash tenancy because cash tenants take all the risks, and any harvest failure will hurt them and not the landlord. Therefore, they tend to demand lower rents than sharecroppers.

Some economists have argued that sharecropping is not as exploitative as it is often perceived. John Heath and Hans P. Binswanger write that &quot;evidence from around the world suggests that sharecropping is often a way for differently endowed enterprises to pool resources to mutual benefit, overcoming credit restraints and helping to manage risk.&quot;

Sharecropping agreements can be made fairly, as a form of tenant farming or sharefarming that has a variable rental payment, paid in arrears. There are three different types of contracts.
#Workers can rent plots of land from the owner for a certain sum and keep the whole crop.
#Workers work on the land and earn a fixed wage from the land owner but keep some of the crop.
#No money changes hands but the worker and land owner each keep a share of the crop.

According to sociologist Edward Royce, &quot;adherents of the neoclassical approach&quot; argued that sharecropping incentivized laborers by giving them a vested interest in the crop. American plantations were wary of this interest, as they felt that would lead to African Americans demanding rights of partnership. Many black laborers denied the unilateral authority that landowners hoped to achieve, further complicating relations between landowners and sharecroppers.

Sharecropping may allow women to have access to arable land, albeit not as owners, in places where ownership rights are vested only in men.

==Economic theories of share tenancy==
The theory of share tenancy was long dominated by Alfred Marshall&#x27;s famous footnote in Book VI, Chapter X.14 of &quot;Principles&quot; where he illustrated the inefficiency of agricultural share-contracting. Steven N.S. Cheung (1969), challenged this view, showing that with sufficient competition and in the absence of transaction costs, share tenancy will be equivalent to competitive labor markets and therefore efficient.

He also showed that in the presence of transaction costs, share-contracting may be preferred to either wage contracts or rent contracts—due to the mitigation of labor shirking and the provision of risk sharing. Joseph Stiglitz (1974, 1988), suggested that if share tenancy is only a labor contract, then it is only pairwise-efficient and that land-to-the-tiller reform would improve social efficiency by removing the necessity for labor contracts in the first place.

Reid (1973), Murrel (1983), Roumasset (1995) and Allen and Lueck (2004) provided transaction cost theories of share-contracting, wherein tenancy is more of a partnership than a labor contract and both landlord and tenant provide multiple inputs. It has also been argued that the sharecropping institution can be explained by factors such as informational asymmetry (Hallagan, 1978; Allen, 1982; Muthoo, 1998), moral hazard (Reid, 1976; Eswaran and Kotwal, 1985; Ghatak and Pandey, 2000), 
intertemporal discounting (Roy and Serfes, 2001), price fluctuations (Sen, 2011) or limited liability (Shetty, 1988; Basu, 1992; Sengupta, 1997; Ray and Singh, 2001).

<text>Paul Efthemios Tsongas ( ; February 14, 1941 – January 18, 1997) was an American politician who represented Massachusetts in the United States Senate from 1979 until 1985 and in the United States House of Representatives from 1975 until 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, he ran for president in 1992. He won eight contests during the presidential primaries but ultimately lost the nomination to Bill Clinton, who later won the general election.

Born in Lowell, Massachusetts, Tsongas graduated from Dartmouth College, Yale Law School and the Kennedy School of Government. After working for the Peace Corps and as an aide to Congressman F. Bradford Morse, Tsongas successively won election as a city councilor and county commissioner. In 1974, Tsongas was elected to the House of Representatives representing Massachusetts&#x27;s 5th congressional district, after defeating incumbent Paul W. Cronin. In 1978, he ran for Senate, and defeated incumbent Republican Edward Brooke.

In Congress, Tsongas established a reputation as a social liberal and fiscal conservative. Tsongas was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 1983 and declined to seek re-election in 1984. He returned to politics after undergoing a successful bone marrow transplant. He experienced early success in the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries, winning the New Hampshire primary, but withdrew from the race in March 1992 and endorsed Clinton. An opponent of deficit spending, Tsongas co-founded the Concord Coalition. He died in 1997 of complications from pneumonia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

== Early life ==
Tsongas was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, along with a twin sister, Thaleia, to a once working-class family who came to own a very successful dry cleaning business in Lowell. His father, Efthemios George Tsongas, was a Greek immigrant, and his mother, Katina (née Pappas; originally Panagiotopoulos), was of Greek descent.

After graduating from Lowell High School in 1958, Tsongas attended Dartmouth College, graduating in 1962 with a B.A. in economics, then Yale Law School and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University before settling in Lowell, Massachusetts. While at Dartmouth, Tsongas was a member of the men&#x27;s swimming team. He picked up the sport again, 27 years later, in 1986, after doctors suggested swimming as a way to rebuild his lung capacity while he was recovering from lymphoma. At a YMCA Masters meet, Tsongas once remarked, &quot;I always used to say breaststroke was an athletic event and the butterfly was the political statement.&quot;

Tsongas served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Ethiopia from 1962 to 1964, and as Peace Corps Country Director in the West Indies from 1967 to 1968. In 1967, Tsongas – working as an aide to Congressman F. Bradford Morse – met Niki Sauvage, who was spending the summer in Arlington, Virginia. They were married in 1969, and had three daughters: Ashley, Katina, and Molly. Niki Tsongas was a U.S. Representative from Massachusetts from 2007 to 2019. When Tsongas ran for office, out of concern that people would pronounce the silent T in his last name, the campaign distributed bumper stickers saying &quot;Tsenator Tsongas&quot;.

==Political career==
Tsongas first entered politics as a city councilor, elected to the Lowell City Council in 1969 where he served two consecutive terms. Tsongas went on to serve as a county commissioner of Middlesex County, Massachusetts. In 1974, he ran for United States House of Representatives from a district anchored by Lowell. The district had elected only three Democrats in its entire existence and had been in Republican hands continuously since 1895. However, in the massive Democratic wave of the post-Watergate election of 1974, he defeated freshman Republican Paul W. Cronin by a 21-point margin. He was reelected in 1976, becoming the first Democrat to hold the district for more than one term. Increasingly popular and well-liked in Massachusetts,

==U.S. senator==
in 1978 he ran for and was elected to the United States Senate, defeating incumbent Republican Edward Brooke by 202,699 votes.

In 1983, Tsongas was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, and in 1984 announced his retirement from the Senate. His seat went to a fellow Democrat, 2004 presidential nominee and future United States Secretary of State John Kerry. After undergoing a bone marrow transplant to treat the disease in 1986 and receiving a clean bill of health from doctors in 1991, he returned to politics, running for his party&#x27;s nomination for President in 1992. Until the 1992 campaign, Tsongas had never lost an election. He was the first former Peace Corps volunteer elected to the U.S. Senate (1978). In 1974, he and Chris Dodd were the first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.

In October 1979, after the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted in favor of Alaska public lands legislation, President Jimmy Carter issued a statement thanking Tsongas for his leadership in strengthening the bill. In May 1982, Tsongas was one of eight senators to vote against a $177.9 billion military authorization bill for 1983 that provided money for chemical weapons. In July 1982, Tsongas met with Prime Minister of Israel Menachem Begin, questioning Begin over where negotiations would fit in the event that Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization Yasser Arafat concede Israel&#x27;s right to exist along with reneging the Palestinian National Covenant over calls for Israel&#x27;s abolition and replacement by a secular state. Tsongas afterward stated the meetings were distressing.

During a May 27, 1983, hearing on the legal effects of the Equal Rights Amendment, the first in over a decade on the amendment, Tsongas was questioned by Utah Senator Orrin Hatch over the measure, being described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;visibly shaken by the treatment Senator Hatch gave him&quot;. Tsongas delivered an opening statement and replied &quot;That issue will be decided in the courts&quot; in response to most questions by Hatch.

===Political positions===

Tsongas was generally viewed as socially liberal and fiscally conservative. He was especially known for his efforts in Congress in support of historic preservation and environmental conservation on one hand, and for his pro-business economic policies on the other. He played a major role while in the House in the creation of Lowell National Historical Park, as well as in the establishment or expansion of a number of other National Park System areas.
Tsongas played an equally key role later in the Senate, working closely with then Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus, in successful passage of the massive Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, which had been hopelessly deadlocked in the Senate since its original passed by the House in 1978. Relative to business and economic matters, Tsongas focused in particular on the federal budget deficit, a cause he continued to champion even after his presidential primary campaign ended, by co-founding the Concord Coalition.

Tsongas was criticized on occasion by opponents as a Reaganomics-style politician, and as being closer to Republicans with regard to such issues. The &quot;Boston Herald&quot; editorialized that his political philosophy had &quot;far more in common&quot; with 1990s-era Republican Mitt Romney (who crossed over to vote for Tsongas in the 1992 primaries) than with traditional Massachusetts Democrats like Ted Kennedy. In the mid-1980s, he upset many of the members of the Americans for Democratic Action by advising them that they should focus more on economic growth than wealth redistribution. He once quipped, &quot;If anyone thinks the words &#x27;government&#x27; and &#x27;efficiency&#x27; belong in the same sentence, we have counselling available.&quot;

==1992 presidential campaign==
===Primaries===

Described as a &quot;long shot campaign&quot; by the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Paul Tsongas was the first Democrat to launch a bid for the 1992 presidential election, on April 30, 1991 in his hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts. Tsongas campaign was banking heavily on early success in New Hampshire. Like many of the candidates, Tsongas ignored the 1992 contest in Iowa, which was expected to go overwhelmingly to Iowa&#x27;s Senator Tom Harkin. Tsongas hoped that his New England independence and fiscal conservatism from neighboring Massachusetts would appeal to Granite Staters. He achieved recognition for the bluntness and clarity of his plan, distributing a short book titled &quot;A Call to Economic Arms&quot;, which focused on such issues as the growing federal deficit. When asked why he did not have a tax cut plan like the other candidates, Tsongas famously answered, &quot;I&#x27;m not trying to play Santa Claus.&quot;

====New Hampshire====

During the early weeks of 1992 things seemed to be going Tsongas&#x27;s way when one major candidate, Bill Clinton, stumbled over issues involving marital infidelity and avoidance of the military draft during the Vietnam War. But Clinton&#x27;s setback proved temporary, bottoming out weeks before the New Hampshire primary so that while Tsongas won the most votes, and was declared the winner, the margin of 33.2% to 24.78% gave each candidate 9 delegates. Clinton adviser James Carville then tagged his man &quot;the Comeback Kid&quot; and declared his campaign back on track, leaving Tsongas, still ostensibly the front-runner, to be seen by many as the underdog heading into Super Tuesday.

====After NH====
Following New Hampshire, Tsongas was unable to match Clinton&#x27;s fundraising. Clinton went on to win most of the Super Tuesday delegate contests. Tsongas won the primaries in Delaware, Maryland, Arizona, Washington, Utah and Massachusetts, but his campaign never recovered from Clinton&#x27;s comeback.

===Convention===
Tsongas pulled out of the race on March 19, 1992, and endorsed Clinton. However, a number of the Tsongas delegates continued to support the former Senator, and voted for Tsongas on the first ballot at the Convention. The roll call yielded 289 votes for Tsongas, placing him in 3rd place behind Clinton and then-former California Governor, Jerry Brown. During the convention Tsongas tried to include a platform plank calling for a delay in tax cuts or tax credits until the budget could be balanced, which was overwhelmingly defeated.

On October 13, 1993, Tsongas&#x27;s friend and fund raiser Nicholas Rizzo pleaded guilty to charges of embezzling more than $1 million dollars from the Tsongas presidential campaign. Prosecutors claimed that the embezzlement caused the campaign to stall at a critical point.

==Post-Senate career==

In late 1994, Tsongas briefly led an effort to establish a third party, to be led by someone with &quot;national authority&quot;, suggesting General Colin Powell for that role. By that time, Tsongas was considered &quot;the most popular political figure in Massachusetts&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Tsongas died on January 18, 1997, aged 55, of complications from pneumonia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. His funeral was held at Transfiguration Greek Orthodox Church. His obituary in the &quot;New York Times&quot; of January 20, 1997 states:

Mr. Tsongas, who was hospitalized on Jan. 3 with a liver problem related to his treatments for non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, a slow-growing cancer of the lymph system, and later developed pneumonia, died at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital. Mr. Tsongas made his survival from cancer an issue in his Presidential campaign when he and two of his doctors, Dr. Tak Takvorian and Dr. George P. Canellos, said he had been cancer-free since a bone-marrow transplant in 1986. 
In May 1996, he underwent another transplant, getting bone marrow from his twin sister, Thaleia Schlesinger, to correct myelodysplasia, a bone-marrow disorder that can occur in people who have recovered from lymph cancer.

On January 27, 1998, the Tsongas Center in Lowell was dedicated in his honor. In a special election held on October 16, 2007, his widow, Niki, won the Massachusetts Congressional seat that Tsongas once held. Preservation Massachusetts, a statewide nonprofit focused on preserving Massachusetts history, has an annual Paul Tsongas Award to honor restoration workers in the state.

<text>Neuropsychiatric quinism is a chronic encephalopathy due to intoxication by mefloquine, quinacrine, chloroquine. It is associated with brain dysfunction and brainstem dysfunction. It may be confused as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the opinion of one medical author it &quot;may have been widely unrecognized in veteran populations, and its symptoms misattributed to other causes.&quot; Symptoms include, but are not limited to, limbic encephalopathy and neurotoxic vestibulopathy.

==Symptoms==
This neuropsychiatric syndrome is defined by several symptoms that distinguish it from others:
===Very high probability===
* delirium
* confusion
* disorientation
===Moderate probability===
* dementia
* amnesia
* seizures
===Prodromal===
* anxiety
* depression
* sleep disturbance
* abnormal dreams
* dizziness
* vertigo
* paresthesias
