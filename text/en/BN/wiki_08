<text>The BMT Brighton Line, also known as the Brighton Beach Line, is a rapid transit line in the B Division of the New York City Subway in Brooklyn, New York. Local service is provided at all times by the Q train, but is joined by the B express train on weekdays. The Q train runs the length of the entire line from Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue to the Manhattan Bridge south tracks. The B begins at Brighton Beach and runs via the bridge&#x27;s north tracks.

The line first opened in 1878 as a two-track surface-level excursion railroad called the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway, transporting riders from Downtown Brooklyn via a connection with the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) to the seaside resorts at Coney Island. When its connection with the LIRR was severed in 1883, the line became the Brooklyn and Brighton Beach Railroad, which was eventually acquired by the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT, later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation [BMT]). From 1903 to 1908, all of the original line&#x27;s grade crossings were eliminated; This project also widened the line from two to four tracks from Church Avenue to Sheepshead Bay; From 1918 to 1920 the portion of original open-cut right-of-way from Church Avenue to Prospect Park station was widened to four tracks and a new subway alignment was built north of the Prospect Park station. The northern part of the original line became the modern-day BMT Franklin Avenue Line, which still runs today. In subsequent years, numerous improvements were made to the Brighton Line.

==History==

===Origins===

The Brighton Line opened from the Willink Plaza entrance of Prospect Park (modern intersection of Flatbush and Ocean Avenues and Empire Boulevard, now the Prospect Park station on both the renamed Brighton and the Franklin Avenue Shuttle lines) to Brighton Beach (modern Coney Island Avenue at the shoreline) on July 2, 1878, and the full original line on August 18. It was an excursion railroad – the Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway – to bring beachgoers from downtown Brooklyn (via a connection with the Long Island Rail Road) to the seashore at Coney Island on the Atlantic Ocean, at a location named Brighton Beach at the same time the railroad arrived. It has been known since its opening as the Brighton Beach Line but is now described as the Brighton Line in MTA literature and in public usage.

After losing its connection with the Long Island Rail Road in 1883, the railroad fell on hard times, reorganizing as the Brooklyn and Brighton Beach Railroad. Seeking a new route for its excursion business and its local trade in communities along the way, it formed an agreement with the Kings County Elevated Railway to connect to its Fulton Street Line, which gave access to the new Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan passengers. This was accomplished in 1896.

A series of mergers and leases put the Brighton Beach Line in the hands of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), a holding company which eventually controlled most of the rapid transit, streetcar, and bus lines in Brooklyn and part of Queens. The line was electrified with trolley wire and, for a time, trolleys from several surface routes and elevated trains operated together on the line.

The BRT was reorganized as the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) in 1923. In 1940, the BMT was purchased by the City of New York, and operation passed to the city&#x27;s Board of Transportation, which already operated the city-built Independent Subway System (IND).
The original line was a two-tracked high-speed surface steam railroad operating from Bedford Station, at Atlantic Avenue near Franklin Avenue in the City of Brooklyn, at which point it made a physical connection to the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Atlantic Branch. From Bedford the line ran on a surface private right-of-way several blocks south to Park Place, which it crossed at grade, and then in an open cut with street overpasses through what is now Crown Heights and Flatbush, as far as Church Lane (now Church Avenue) in the Town and Village of Flatbush. From that point the line continued on the surface to a point at current Beverley Road between Marlborough Road (East 15th Street) and East 16th Street, curving southeast and running on the surface between the lines of the latter streets through the Towns of Flatbush and Gravesend to Sheepshead Bay, then turning southerly to reach the beach at Brighton Beach on Coney Island in the Town of Gravesend.

The line was extended westward from Brighton Beach in 1903, so that it could terminate with the former Prospect Park and Coney Island Railroad at Culver Depot in Coney Island. Passengers, with this short extension, were given access to the developing area of Coney Island. The Culver Depot became the center of operations for the Culver Line and the Brighton Beach Line.

===Grade crossing eliminations, 1903–1908 and 1918–1920===
In 1903, the New York State Legislature created the Brooklyn Grade Crossing Elimination Commission (BGCEC) to eliminate all grade crossings on the Brighton Beach Line and the Bay Ridge Line of the Long Island Rail Road. The city was supposed to cover half of the costs, not exceeding $1 million, while the railroads were to cover the other half of the costs. The work started on December 30, 1905, and was completed in 1908. A short piece of two-tracked elevated railroad was built from the ramp connecting to the Fulton Street Elevated as far as Park Place, where the original 1878 open cut began. From the end of that original cut south of Church Avenue, the line was wholly rebuilt as a four-track railroad with express and local stations to a point south of Neptune Avenue at the border of Coney Island, continuing along its original right-of-way to Brighton Beach station. The portion from Church Avenue to Avenue H was placed in a depressed open cut, while the portion from Avenue H to south of Sheepshead Bay was raised onto an earthen embankment, primarily with earth excavated from the open-cut portion and from the Bay Ridge Improvement of the Long Island Rail Road. The separation of the railroad grade allowed the line&#x27;s trolley wire north of Sheepshead Bay to be replaced with ground-level third rail.

The work by the BGCEC left the line between Park Place and Church Avenue in substantially its original condition from steam railroad days. Between 1918 and 1920, however, further work rebuilt the portion between Prospect Park and Church Avenue as a four-track line. At the same time, the remaining portion of the line south of Neptune Avenue was replaced with a four-track elevated structure, including a four- to six-track elevated line extension, connecting the Brighton Line to the new Coney Island terminal at Surf and Stillwell Avenues. This same work rerouted mainline Brighton Beach trains from the Fulton Street elevated line via a new deep tunnel under Flatbush Avenue to connect to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line at DeKalb Avenue station, where trains could access the new BMT Broadway subway. This work was done as a part of the Dual Contracts.

A spur south of Neck Road, which split to Sheepshead Bay Race Track, was in use from 1909 to around 1929. The single-track spur was part of the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Manhattan Beach Branch, and it ran at street level to Ocean Avenue between Avenues X and Y, where it terminated at a six-track terminal.

===Brighton–Franklin Line===
The St. Felix Street and Flatbush Avenue Connection opened on August 1, 1920, providing direct service between the Brighton Line and midtown Manhattan. With the opening of the connection, the original portion of the line between the Fulton Street Elevated and the link to the new subway at Prospect Park became a secondary line, known as Brighton–Franklin, and now known as the BMT Franklin Avenue Line. At times through services (including expresses) operated on mainline Brighton tracks to Coney Island. Some special weekend trains even operated beyond Coney Island back to Manhattan via the BMT Sea Beach Line express tracks and the BMT Fourth Avenue Subway. This service was variously known as Franklin–Nassau and as the Coney Island Express, but its popular name was the &quot;Sunny Sunday Summer Special,&quot; because it was only supposed to operate as needed on the hottest beach-going days.

In Fiscal Year 1930, an additional control area with staircases to the platforms at Kings Highway were constructed, and additional stairs were added at Avenue M, Avenue U, and Avenue J.

Through services gradually diminished on the Brighton–Franklin, and after 1963 it became a pure shuttle, operating between Franklin Avenue station at Fulton Street and Prospect Park station, where it connects with mainline Brighton Beach trains.

During the era of route contraction from 1940 to about 1975, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle seemed a prime candidate for abandonment; its physical structure had been allowed to deteriorate and its service steadily curtailed. The New York City fiscal crisis of the &#x27;70s and the recession in 1990 contributed to plans to discontinue the line. By the 1990s the Franklin Avenue Shuttle was known as the &quot;ghost train&quot;. It was shrunk in size to only two cars and the Dean Street station was closed. The entire line was under consideration for abandonment, but community pressure forced the MTA to rebuild rather than abandon the line, and as a result, most of the supporting infrastructure and stations were completely rehabilitated in 1998–1999 at a cost of $74 million and reopened in 1999.

=== Platform extensions, track repairs, and Stillwell Avenue reconstruction ===
On June 16, 1964, Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. approved the award of a $2,283,933 contract for the second phase of work to extend platforms along the Brighton Line. The platforms were to be lengthened to feet to accommodate a ten-car train of long IND cars, or a nine-car train of long BMT cars, instead of the existing 8-cars. The contract for the first phase of work had been let the previous year for the seven stations between Atlantic Avenue and Newkirk Avenue. The platform extensions at these stations were completed during the 1964–1965 fiscal year. The contract for the second phase called for the extension of platforms at the ten remaining stations on the line from Avenue H to Stillwell Avenue. Work on the second contract was still ongoing in 1965.

Between April 26, 1986, and October 26, 1986, service was disrupted due to track repairs and other construction work along the line. The two local tracks were completely rebuilt between Prospect Park and Newkirk Avenue, in two phases, with the Manhattan-bound track rebuilt first between April and July, and the Brooklyn-bound track rebuilt between July and October. A temporary platform was built at Cortelyou Road while Beverley Road and Parkside Avenue were closed in one direction because temporary platforms could not be built at these locations. To reduce congestion, skip-stop service was implemented on weekdays, which lasted until 1988. 
From September 8, 2002, to May 23, 2004, service was suspended west of Brighton Beach due to allow rebuilding of the Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue terminal station, which had deteriorated due to the effects of salt water corrosion and deferred maintenance.

===Brighton Line Station Reconstruction Project===

In 2007, the MTA announced that it would reconstruct seven stations between Newkirk Avenue and Neck Road, inclusive. On December 8, 2008, the first phase of the Brighton Line Station Reconstruction Project began. The Coney Island-bound platforms at Avenue U and Neck Road were closed for rebuilding and all southbound trains ran on the express track from Kings Highway to Sheepshead Bay.

On September 14, 2009, the second phase of the project involving all stations from Newkirk Plaza to Kings Highway began. Express B train service was suspended and all trains ran local in both directions for the next two years. Over the next two weeks, temporary platforms were placed on the Manhattan-bound express track at Kings Highway and Avenue J for southbound service. On September 28, the southbound platforms of Avenue H, Avenue J, Avenue M, and Kings Highway began rebuilding. South of Cortelyou Road, a single crossover connected the southbound local track with the express one and all southbound trains skipped Avenue H and Avenue M.

On January 18, 2010, Coney Island-bound service was restored at Avenue U and Neck Road. The Manhattan-bound platforms were closed for rebuilding until October 25 and all northbound trains operated on the express track from Sheepshead Bay to Kings Highway.

On September 13, Coney Island-bound service to Avenue H and Avenue M was restored and the two southbound tracks south of Cortelyou Road were separated. Over the next two weeks, the temporary platforms at Avenue J and Kings Highway were moved to the southbound express track and the two northbound tracks were connected to each other north of Newkirk Plaza. On September 27, the Manhattan-bound platforms of those three stations as well as Avenues H and M, which were then being bypassed, began rehabilitation and all northbound service was directed to the express track until Cortelyou Road. The platforms of all stations reopened on September 12, 2011, and B express service was restored on October 3. However, rehabilitation work that did not affect service continued until the end of the year.

As part of the project, station platforms were replaced and widened, windscreens and canopies were replaced, station lighting was upgraded, new public address systems were installed, and new station agent booths were put into place. In addition, ADA-compliant elevators were installed at Kings Highway, the historic station house at Avenue H was restored, an additional southbound entrance was installed at Avenue H, and additional fare entrances were created to the northbound platform sections of the Avenue M and Avenue J stations.

==Service patterns==
The following services use part or all of the Brighton Line:

Since 1920, the primary service on the line has been through to Manhattan rather than over the tracks now used by the Franklin Avenue Shuttle. Local service has run all the time, while express service has generally been provided during weekday rush hours and later middays. Until the 1960s, all service on the line north of Prospect Park was labeled 1.

Standard local service ran through the Montague Street Tunnel and along the BMT Broadway Line local tracks; service instead crossed the Manhattan Bridge north tracks and ran express under Broadway during Broadway theatre hours (7:30 pm to midnight). Over the years, the local bridge service was expanded, and the local tunnel service ended up only from 6 am to 7 pm. Express service over the bridge to the Broadway express tracks, initially during rush hours, was also expanded to 6 am to 7 pm. The three patterns were assigned latter designations in the early 1960s: Q express via bridge, QT local via tunnel, and QB local via bridge.

The Chrystie Street Connection opened in late 1967, and almost all Brighton Line trains were removed from Broadway. The Q and QB were both combined with the D on the IND Sixth Avenue Line, running express during the day and local at other times. The daytime QT local was combined with the Jamaica local and express (then #15) to form the QJ, running through the tunnel to the BMT Nassau Street Line, which also replaced the limited rush hour Brighton “Bankers’ Specials” to Nassau Street. The only Brighton-Broadway service was a new QB, with a limited number of runs in the peak direction at rush hours on the local Brighton and express Broadway tracks. There were also a limited number of NX trains from Brighton Beach via Coney Island and the Sea Beach express tracks, then up Broadway, a short-lived service that also attempted to compensate for the elimination of major Brighton/Broadway service. (The two QB services were distinct; the old QB had run at non-peak times; this new QB had the same name and almost the same route but was a different service.)

The QJ″s Brighton section was replaced with an extension of the M in 1973. In 1985, the QB was renamed Q as the subway eliminated the double letter naming system for local routes. Reconstruction of the Manhattan Bridge subway tracks began, which would continue until 2004. Though the same general service patterns remained on the Brighton Line, all trains were sent over the bridge and onto the Broadway or Sixth Avenue Line, depending on which set of tracks was open. From 1986 to 1988, the south side (Broadway) was in service, and the D continued to serve the line at all times, the M was rerouted onto the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and Q service now also ran during middays. Because of the concurrent track and infrastructure repairs on the Brighton Line, express service was suspended for two years. As tracks between Prospect Park and Newkirk Avenue were rebuilt, the D and Q provided skip-stop service between Newkirk Avenue and Sheepshead Bay on weekdays. D trains served Neck Road, Avenue M and Avenue H; the Q skipped those stops, serving Avenue U and Avenue J, while both trains served Kings Highway. By 1987, as the line&#x27;s reconstruction progressed, the weekday skip-stop pattern expanded to Prospect Park, with D trains serving Beverley Road while Q trains served Cortelyou Road and Parkside Avenue, with Church Avenue as a mutual station.

On December 11, 1988, the Bridge&#x27;s north (Sixth Avenue) tracks reopened; at this time, the skip-stop pattern was eliminated, and the D became a full-time local service to Stillwell Avenue, while the Q ran express on weekdays to Brighton Beach. Both trains ran via Sixth Avenue Express. From April 30 to November 12, 1995, the Manhattan Bridge fully closed during middays and weekends. D service in Brooklyn was suspended during these hours; the Q replaced it, running local to Stillwell Avenue and via the Montague Street Tunnel and Broadway Express.

The 2001 shifting of trains back to the south side (Broadway) led to the D only running north of Midtown Manhattan; the Q replaced the D as the full-time Brighton Local while the Brighton express portion of the Q became the diamond &lt;Q&gt;. When both sides of the bridge reopened in 2004, the &lt;Q&gt; was discontinued and replaced by the B in Brooklyn. The B was restored to the Brighton Line rather than the West End Line, where it had run from 1967 to 2001, to combine two weekday-only services and because Brighton Line residents preferred Broadway Service, the Q was kept as the full-time local. In effect, this flipped the B and D services, as the D was transferred to the West End Line following the bridge&#x27;s reopening.

==Description==
The modern-day line shows a mix of its various re-buildings.

===DeKalb Avenue to Prospect Park===
The underground portion from the DeKalb Avenue connection to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line was built in 1920 as part of the Dual Contracts. This section contains two additional stations: the Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center and Seventh Avenue. Between Atlantic Avenue and Grand Army Plaza, the Brighton Line tunnel runs beside, under, and between the tracks of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)&#x27;s Eastern Parkway Line. The Eastern Parkway Line was built simultaneously with this part of the Brighton Line, and also opened in 1920.

At Prospect Park, the Brighton subway tunnel emerges into an open cut. The Prospect Park station contains a cross-platform interchange with the BMT Franklin Avenue Line, which is used by the . Franklin Avenue Line trains use the northbound local track, while the express tracks in both directions are used by the Brighton Line trains; the southbound local track is not in service. The former alignment of the Brighton Line ran along what is now the Franklin Avenue Line, which had been built as a surface railway in 1878 and rebuilt as a grade-separated open-cut and embankment line in 1905.

===Prospect Park to Brighton Beach===
South of Prospect Park, the Brighton Line widens to a four-track line for much of the rest of the route. The continues on the inner tracks and runs to Brighton Beach, serving only express stations, while the splits to the outer tracks, serving all stops until the end of the line at Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue. The original line built in 1878 ran in a two-track open cut. This segment was rebuilt in 1918 to 1920 to a four track line with an express station at Prospect Park, a local station at Parkside Avenue (replacing the original station at Woodruff Avenue) and another express station at Church Avenue. The line features slightly sloped and capped reinforced concrete walls, as well as cut-and-cover tunnels underneath cross-streets.

The segment between Church Avenue to Avenue H is a result of the BGCEC rebuilding program of 1903–1907. Just south of the tunnel under Church Avenue, the construction of the cut wall visibly changes. Steel trestles carry the streets above the line, giving it a more open appearance. Cottage-style station houses are suspended over the line at local stations at Beverley and Cortelyou Roads, and at the express station at Newkirk Plaza. Past Newkirk Plaza the line continues in an open cut, then begins to rise to street level at the north end of Avenue H station.

The station house at Avenue H is a wooden structure built in 1905 and originally housed a real estate office for the sale of homes in the new Fiske Terrace community surrounding the station. The building was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2004. At this point the line now runs on an earthen embankment with local stations at Avenue H, Avenue J and Avenue M, an express station at Kings Highway, local stops at Avenue U and (Gravesend) Neck Road, and an express station at Sheepshead Bay (formerly Shore Road). All of the station houses for these stops are located beneath the tracks at street level.

The line continues south on the 1907 embankment to a bridge over Neptune Avenue. At this point the BGCEC roadbed ends. Prior to the Dual Contracts rebuild in the late 1910s, the line descended to the surface on two single track concrete and steel ramps to operate on the surface to Brighton Beach. As part of the 1918–1920 Dual Contracts work, all four tracks now continue on a steel elevated structure to the junction of Coney Island and Brighton Beach Avenues, where the line turns west onto Brighton Beach Avenue and enters the Brighton Beach station.

===Brighton Beach to Coney Island===

Traveling west from Brighton Beach station, the line operates on a six track elevated structure over Brighton Beach Avenue. One track splits from each pair of local and express tracks in each direction. Only the outer two tracks are currently used for revenue service, carrying Q trains. The inner four are layup tracks used to store B trains that terminate at Brighton Beach; the innermost two tracks are the former right-of-way of the Sea View Railway, which originally provided service west of Brighton Beach.

Each of the two layup tracks between the local and express tracks ends before Ocean Parkway station, while the innermost and outermost tracks stop at the station. The outer tracks merge with the inner tracks, and the inner tracks climb to an upper level. The outer trackways remain at the same elevation, and shortly afterward merge with the two tracks of the IND Culver Line (), which merge into the structure from the north. Both lines then stop at the West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium station, a double-level steel structure with two tracks on each level. The Brighton trains occupy the upper level and the Culver Line trains the lower. Both lines then enter the 8-track Stillwell Avenue terminal, which was built in 1917–1920 and renovated in 2001–2004. The Brighton trains occupy tracks 3 and 4.

<text>The desert cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii), also known as Audubon&#x27;s cottontail, is a New World cottontail rabbit, and a member of the family Leporidae. Unlike the European rabbit (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;), they do not form social burrow systems, but compared with some other leporids, they are extremely tolerant of other individuals in their vicinity.

Cottontails give birth to their kits in burrows vacated by other mammals. They sometimes cool off, or take refuge in scratched out shallow created depressions of their own making, using their front paws like a back hoe. They are not usually active in the middle of the day, but can be observed foraging in the early morning, and early evening. Cottontails are rarely found out of their burrows looking for food on windy days, because the wind interferes with their ability to hear approaching predators, their primary defense mechanism.

==Lifespan==

The lifespan of a cottontail that reaches adulthood averages less than two years, depending on the location. Unfortunately for the cottontail, almost every local carnivore larger or faster than the lagomorph is its predator. Some predators, like snakes for example, are familiar with the area inhabited by the cottontails, and can catch and eat the young at will; the mother is unable to defend the litter. Although cottontails are highly active sexually, and mated pairs have multiple litters throughout the year, few young survive to adulthood. Those that survive grow quickly and are full grown at three months.

== Description ==

The desert cottontail is quite similar in appearance to the European rabbit, though its ears are larger and are more often carried erect. It is social among its peers, often gathering in small groups to feed. Like all cottontail rabbits, the desert cottontail has a greyish-brown, rounded tail with a broad white edge and white underside, which is visible as it runs away. It also has white fur on the belly.

Adults are long and weigh anywhere from . The tail is , ears are long and the hindfeet are large, about in length. There is little sexual dimorphism, but females tend to be larger than the males, but have much smaller home ranges, about compared with about for a male.
== Distribution and habitat ==

The desert cottontail is found throughout the Western United States from eastern Montana to western Texas, and in Northern and Central Mexico. Its eastern range extends barely into the Great Plains. Westward, its range extends to central Nevada, central and southern California and Baja California, touching the Pacific Ocean. It is found at heights of up to . It is particularly associated with the dry near-desert grasslands of the American southwest, though it is also found in less arid habitats such as pinyon-juniper forest. It is also frequently found in the riparian zones in arid regions.

== Behavior ==

=== Diet and feeding ===
Cottontails are herbivores, with 90% of their diet consisting of grass. They also feed on the leaves and peas of mesquite, barks, fallen fruit, the juicy pads of prickly pear and twigs of shrubs. It rarely needs to drink, getting its water mostly from the plants it eats or from dew. Due to seasonality and changes in moisture conditions of their habitat, cottontails adjust their diets based on many influential factors that impact the seasonal changes of vegetation (i.e. moisture content, abundance, nutrition value, etc.). Like most lagomorphs, it is coprophagic, re-ingesting and chewing its own feces to extract the nutrients as effectively as possible.

The desert cottontail, like all cottontails, eats on all fours. It can only use its nose to move and adjust the position of the food that it places directly in front of its front paws on the ground. The cottontail turns the food with its nose to find the cleanest part of the vegetation (free of sand and inedible parts) to begin its meal. The only time a cottontail uses its front paws to enable eating is when vegetation is above its head on a living plant. The cottontail then lifts a paw to bend the branch and bring the food within reach.

=== Thermoregulation ===
Due to variable temperatures of their habitats, desert cottontails must be adequate thermoregulators to minimize water loss during the hotter seasons and require shaded areas of their environment to conduct evaporative water loss through thermal heat transfer. In open-desert areas, they can withstand for a short period extremely high temperatures of around , and have a large evaporative water loss capacity of around 1.5% body mass/hour, though cottontails can withstand longer in an ideal environment with shaded areas. To cope with evaporative heat loss, they do panting and undergo changes in production of their basal metabolic rate in relation to the ambient temperature of the environment. Ears of desert cottontails make up 14% of their body size and may help with thermoregulation.

=== Predators and threats ===

Many desert animals prey on cottontails, including birds of prey, mustelids, coyotes, bobcats, Mexican wolves, mountain lions, snakes, weasels, humans, and even squirrels, should a cottontail be injured or docile from illness. Alien species, such as cats and dogs, are also known predators, and also pose a threat. Southwestern Native Americans hunted them for meat but also used their fur and hides. It is also considered a game species, due to which it is hunted for sport. The desert cottontail&#x27;s normal behavior upon spotting a potential predator is to freeze in place in an attempt to avoid being detected. If it determines that it is in danger, it will flee the area by hopping away in a zigzag pattern. Cottontails can reach speeds of over . When defending itself against small predators or other desert cottontails, it will nudge with its nose, or slap with its front paws, usually preceded by a hop straight upwards as high as two feet when threatened or taken by surprise.

Habitat loss due to land clearing and cattle grazing may severely affect the population of the desert cottontail. Human-induced fires are also a potential threat for desert cottontail populations. Another factor is its competition with the black-tailed jackrabbit (&quot;Lepus californicus)&quot;, because both have the same diet, and share the same habitat. When a season has been particularly dry, there is less plant life to go around. The cottontail does not fear the jackrabbit, in fact the jackrabbit is very skittish and will retreat from a confrontation in most instances. However, the black-tailed jackrabbit is much bigger, and consumes much more food at eating times.

==Weather and food supply==
An extremely wet winter season means increased plant life in the spring, and thus increases in cottontail populations. However, if the wet winter is followed by a particularly dry summer, the plant life dries up quickly due to the extreme desert summer temperatures, and can have the opposite effect, and can lead to hunger for the now over-populated cottontails.

== Status and conservation ==

Since 1996, the desert cottontail has been rated of least concern on the IUCN Red List; it does not appear on the state or federal list of endangered species. The desert cottontail is considered a game species in the United States by individual state wildlife agencies. It is also not considered to be threatened by the state game agencies in the United States, It is common throughout most of its range in Mexico. None of the twelve subspecies are thought to be under threat and no new conservation measures are needed.

<doc id="428246" wikidata="Q166210" url="?curid=428246" title="Tampico Affair">
<text>The Tampico Affair began as a minor incident involving United States Navy sailors and the Mexican Federal Army loyal to Mexican dictator General Victoriano Huerta. On April 9, 1914, nine sailors had come ashore to secure supplies and were detained by Mexican forces. Commanding Admiral Henry Mayo demanded that the US sailors be released, and that Mexico issue an apology, raise and salute the US flag, and perform a 21-gun salute. Mexico refused the demand. US President Woodrow Wilson backed the demand, and the conflict escalated when the Americans occupied the port city of Veracruz for more than six months. This contributed to the fall of Huerta, who resigned in July 1914. Since the US had not had diplomatic relations with Mexico since Huerta&#x27;s seizure of power in 1913, the ABC powers Argentina, Brazil, and Chile offered to mediate the conflict, in the Niagara Falls peace conference, held in Canada. The American occupation of Veracruz caused widespread anti-American sentiment.

==Background==
In the midst of the Mexican Revolution, General Victoriano Huerta became President of Mexico following a coup to oust the democratically-elected president, Francisco I. Madero. Opposition to Huerta grew from the forces of peasant leader Emiliano Zapata in the state of Morelos and the rapid advance of the Northern opposition Constitutionalists under the leadership of Governor of Coahuila Venustiano Carranza. By March 26, 1914, Carranza&#x27;s forces were from the prosperous coastal oil town of Tampico, Tamaulipas. There was a large settlement of US citizens there due to the immense investment by US firms in the local oil industry. Several US Navy warships commanded by Rear Admiral Henry T. Mayo were deployed off the coast for the stated purpose of protecting US citizens and property.

By the spring of 1914, relations between the US and Mexico were strained. US President Woodrow Wilson refused to recognize the presidency of Mexican General Victoriano Huerta, who came to power by a coup d&#x27;état, with rebel General Félix Díaz, a nephew of ex-President Porfirio Díaz, had signed the Embassy Pact with the approval of US Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson, who had since been removed by the president.

During his State of the Union address on 2 Dec. 1913, Wilson stated, &quot;There can be no certain prospect of peace in America until General Huerta has surrendered his usurped authority.&quot; In early 1914, Wilson lifted the arms embargo, which allowed the Constitutionalists to buy arms. With these moves, Wilson was moving closer to intervention.

Mayo&#x27;s Fifth Division of the Atlantic Fleet was in Tampico to protect American lives and interest. Ships at his disposal included the battleships and and cruisers and US interests included the Standard Oil refinery at Arbol Grande, other petroleum properties at Doña Cecilia, and associated American families and homes nearby. Although Tampico was besieged by Constitutionalist forces, relations between the US forces and Huerta&#x27;s federal garrison remained amicable. Mayo&#x27;s flagship, the gunboat , honored a request of the Mexican government and fired a 21-gun salute to the Mexican flag three times on 2 April. This was in commemoration of the capture of Puebla from the French in 1867 by General Porfirio Díaz. Additionally, sailors from the US gunboat and two cruisers, anchored off Tampico in the Pánuco River, went ashore each day to play baseball.

On 6 April, Constitutionalist rebel forces, under the command of Col. Emiliano J. Nafarrete, occupied La Barra, Doña Cecilia, and Arbol Grande. General Ignacio Morelos Zaragoza, Tamaulipas governor and commander of the Federal Army garrison, and nephew of the late Mexican military hero and Secretary of the Army and Navy Ignacio Zaragoza, sent his gunboat &quot;Veracruz&quot; to shell the rebel forces behind the oil tanks. Mayo sent a letter to both parties stating he would remain neutral, but to protect American lives and property, he would &quot;take all necessary steps.&quot; Mayo then evacuated several Americans, but refused to land troops to protect the American-owned refinery. After additional rebel attacks on 7 and 8 April at the Iturbide Bridge, the foreign population sought refuge on the US Navy ships, the German cruiser , and British cruiser . Clarence Miller, US consul in Tampico, sent an urgent request for help in evacuating the American population within the city. Then, on the evening of 8 April, a marine courier for the US consulate was detained but soon released. 

Running short on gasoline for an auxiliary engine, &quot;Dolphin&#x27;s&quot; Capt. Ralph Earle visited the US consulate on 9 April, where he arranged a purchase from a German civilian, Max Tyron. Capt. Earle was to arrange delivery from Tyron&#x27;s dock. However, the dock was located in close proximity to the Iturbide Bridge.

==Conflict==
Capt. Earle ordered Ensign Charles C. Copp to take a whaleboat, and crew, to pick up coal from Tyron&#x27;s dock. Though flying the US colors fore and aft, the US Navy sailors were unarmed and unable to speak Spanish. While loading the fuel, the sailors were surrounded by an armed squad of Zaragoza&#x27;s soldiers. Two sailors, Coxswain G. H. Siefert and Seaman J. P. Harrington, were still on board the American whaleboat, but they too were taken at gunpoint. All were taken to Col. Ramón H. Hinojosa&#x27;s headquarters. He released the Americans to continue reloading their gasoline, but they were not allowed to leave until permission was received from Zaragoza. 

Max Tyron informed Capt. Earle and Admiral Mayo aboard the &quot;Dolphin&quot;, and Mayo ordered Earle to seek his men&#x27;s release under strong protest. Earle, accompanied by Clarence Miller, met with Zaragoza who apologized, explaining his men were &quot;evidently ignorant of the first laws of war.&quot; Within an hour of their arrest, the whaleboat had returned to &quot;Dolphin&quot;. Ensign Copp was faulted by Mayo for allowing his men to be taken from a US vessel. Mayo viewed the incident as an insult to US sovereignty, requiring reparation. Mayo had Commander William A. Moffett deliver a note to Zaragoza stating, &quot;taking men from a boat flying the American flag is a hostile act, not to be excused.&quot; Mayo further demanded a &quot;formal disavowal&quot;, that the responsible officer &quot;receive severe punishment,&quot; and &quot;that you hoist the American flag in a prominent position on shore and salute it with 21 guns, which salute will be duly returned by this ship.&quot; 

Morelos Zaragoza referred the matter to the Mexican Ministry of War in Mexico City. When Wilson heard of the matter from Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan, Wilson responded, &quot;Mayo could not have done otherwise,&quot; and further, &quot;...unless the guilty persons are promptly punished consequences of gravest sort might ensue...&quot;

Nelson J. O&#x27;Shaughnessy, the US Chargé d&#x27;Affaires ad interim in Mexico City, was informed of the incident by Roberto A. Esteva Ruiz, Mexico&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Relations, on 10 April. Ruiz requested that Mayo&#x27;s demands be withdrawn, since Zaragoza had already made a verbal apology. Both O&#x27;Shaughnessy and Ruiz brought the matter to Huerta&#x27;s attention, who also agreed that Mayo&#x27;s ultimatum should be withdrawn. O&#x27;Shaughnessy then released the Mexican account to the Associated Press in Mexico, misstating that the arrested Americans involved were Marines, not sailors, and that they had been &quot;paraded&quot; through the streets of Tampico.

On 12 April, Huerta stated, via Ruiz to O&#x27;Shaughnessy, that since Zaragoza had apologized and arrested Hinojosa, the US had &quot;ample satisfaction.&quot; The Mexican government would not apologize further, nor salute the US flag. Huerta called these &quot;humiliating terms...carrying courtesy to that point would be equivalent to accepting the sovereignty of a foreign state to the derogation of national dignity and decorum, which the president is disposed to have respected in any case.&quot; O&#x27;Shaughnessy told Ruiz that Wilson might need to &quot;uphold our national dignity, even with armed force, if necessary.&quot;

On 13 April, Wilson told reporters, &quot;The salute will be fired.&quot; On 14 April, Wilson ordered the Atlantic Fleet, under the command of Vice Admiral Charles Johnston Badger, to Mexican waters. Huerta stated, &quot;Is it a calamity? No. It is the best thing that could happen to us.&quot; On 15 April, Wilson stated regarding the Mexico situation, there had been &quot;many cases...of the flouting of the rights of US citizens or the dignity of the government of the United States, and no attempt at either reparation or correction.&quot; On 16 April, Washington was notified that Huerta had agreed to a simultaneous salute, signifying &quot;satisfaction with which the two countries see the happy end of a conflict which has at no time been really serious.&quot; Yet Wilson decided the US fleet would stay to prevent any ...&quot;manifestations of ill-will and contempt for the United States which Huerta has exhibited in the past,&quot; and misunderstood Huerta&#x27;s meaning of simultaneous. When simultaneous was finally understood, Wilson opposed the idea, and fleet orders remained the same. Huerta maintained he had done &quot;everything he was obliged to do.&quot; On 18 April, Wilson stated he would see Congress, &quot;with a view of taking such actions as may be necessary to enforce the respect due to the nation&#x27;s flag,&quot; if Mexico did not fire the salute by the next day.

==Aftermath==

President Wilson sought Congressional approval for the use of armed forces on 20 April. In particular, Wilson advocated &quot;taking Vera Cruz,&quot; to get rid of Huerta and his illegitimate authority. Wilson received Congressional approval that evening, and ordered landings at Veracruz, so as to seize the Custom house, and intercept an expected arms shipment for Huerta&#x27;s forces.

In the ensuing United States occupation of Veracruz, 19 Americans were killed and 72 wounded. Mexican losses were estimated at 150 to 170 soldiers killed and between 195 and 250 wounded. An unknown number of civilians were killed. On the Pacific Coast of Mexico, US Naval units were monitoring the fight between Huerta&#x27;s forces and the rebels while they protected US citizens and interests. In Ensenada, Baja California, US Consul Claude E. Guyant and 250 of his fellow citizens were forced to seek safety in the US consulate building, as Mexican authorities were powerless to control anti-American demonstrations that had erupted on April 23. Guyant cabled Washington, &quot;Have taken refuge in consulate. Situation critical. Send warship immediately.&quot; USS &quot;Cheyenne&quot; was sent from San Diego, California, to Ensenada with orders to protect US lives at any cost, including capturing the port if necessary. , en route to Mazatlan, diverted course to Ensenada to assist &quot;Cheyenne&quot;. They were to evacuate Guyant and other Americans. The welfare of approximately 50,000 US citizens living in Mexico was affected by the invasion of Veracruz. Refugee camps were set up in San Diego, Texas, and New Orleans to receive the Americans. Ultimately, the US military transport ship USS sailed from San Francisco in early May and made stops at numerous ports on the west coast of Mexico to pick up additional American refugees. USS &quot;Iris&quot; also picked up numerous American refugees during May, including Clement Edwards, the US consul at Acapulco. By May 4, a total of 71 US Navy ships were operating in Mexican waters.

In January 1917, Germany sent the so-called Zimmermann Telegram, which implied that a Mexican alliance with Germany against the US would result in Mexico regaining territory taken from it by the US in prior wars and that Germany&#x27;s forthcoming unrestricted submarine warfare campaign would guarantee defeat of the British and French. The British interception of Zimmermann&#x27;s telegram and the German unrestricted submarine warfare against US merchant ships soon afterward, were effectively both final justifications that President Wilson needed to request a declaration of war against Germany, in April 1917.

Anti-American sentiment in Mexico from the Tampico incident was the chief reason that the Mexican government remained neutral in World War I. Mexico refused to participate with the US military excursion in Europe and granted full guarantees to German companies for keeping their operations open, specifically in Mexico City.

President Wilson considered another military invasion of Veracruz and Tampico in 1917–1918, to take control of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, the shortest overland route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and the Tampico oil fields. The relatively new Mexican president, Venustiano Carranza, threatened to destroy the oil fields in case the Marines landed there.

<doc id="428256" wikidata="Q3995076" url="?curid=428256" title="Toronto Santa Claus Parade">
<text>The Toronto Santa Claus Parade, also branded as The Original Santa Claus Parade, is a Santa Claus parade held annually in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

First held in 1905, it is one of the largest parade productions in North America, the oldest Santa Claus parade in the world, and one of the world&#x27;s oldest annual parades. Traditionally, it ran from Christie Pits along Bloor Street West and then south through Downtown Toronto before terminating at the downtown Eaton&#x27;s store (later the Eaton Centre) at Yonge Street and Queen Street. Since Eaton&#x27;s ceased its sponsorship of the parade in the 1980s, it has instead terminated at St. Lawrence Market. Its current route is almost long. By tradition, the parade concludes with the arrival of Santa Claus.

==History==

The idea for the parade originated from an earlier promotion by the Eaton&#x27;s chain of department stores, on 2 December 1904, when Santa walked from Union Station to the downtown Toronto Eaton store on Queen Street. The first official Toronto Santa Claus Parade was first held on December 2, 1905, with a single float. Sponsored by Eaton&#x27;s, Santa was collected at Union Station, and delivered to the downtown Toronto Eaton&#x27;s store. The parade grew in size each year and attracted large crowds.

From 1910 to 1912, the parade began its journey in Newmarket on a Friday afternoon, stopping overnight in York Mills and then continuing south along Yonge Street to Eaton&#x27;s downtown Toronto location on Saturday afternoon.

For the 1913 parade, Eaton&#x27;s brought in reindeer from Labrador to pull Santa&#x27;s sleigh. Until 1915, the parade was followed by Santa holding court at Massey Hall where he would meet with up to 5,000 children.

By 1917, the parade featured a number of floats and in 1919, Santa arrived in the city by plane. From 1925 until the late 1960s, the floats from the parade were reused in Montreal where Eaton&#x27;s had been holding Santa Claus Parades since 1909. The Montreal parade was cancelled in 1969 due to bombing threats by the Front de libération du Québec and did not resume until it was revived in the 1990s by the downtown Montreal business association as &quot;Défilé du Père Noël&quot;. Eaton&#x27;s also launched a Santa Claus Parade in Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 1909. Eaton&#x27;s sold the Winnipeg parade to the Winnipeg Firefighters Club in 1965 and continues as a community parade to this day, but is now operated by the Winnipeg Jaycees.
The Toronto parade continued to be held during World War II, without interruption. Due to a shortage of supplies, all of the floats were made out of paper.

Beginning in 1947, a recurring character, Punkinhead, was seen each year in the parade. Punkinhead was a character in a series of storybooks sold by Eaton&#x27;s. By the 1950s the Toronto parade was the largest Santa Claus parade in North America. Eaton&#x27;s continued to pay for the parade, which was used to promote its retail business. The company&#x27;s Merchandise Display Department worked year-round at Eaton&#x27;s Sheppard and Highway 400 service building to make costumes and build floats and mechanized window tableaux. In 1952, the parade was televised for the first time by CBC Television, and in 1970 the first colour broadcast was aired.

Eaton&#x27;s association with the parade ended in 1982 and almost led to the parade&#x27;s demise. Metro Chairman Paul Godfrey spearheaded a &quot;Save Our Parade&quot; campaign, and soon after a group of businessmen led by Ron Barbaro and George Cohon, with the help of 20 corporate sponsors, stepped in to save the parade. Cohon retired from the parade organization in 2014. Since the 1980s, the parade has received funding from various corporate sponsors (including McDonald&#x27;s, Canadian Tire, Lowe&#x27;s, The Walt Disney Company, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us Canada, Mattel, and Tim Horton&#x27;s) which are featured in floats. In 1983, the Celebrity Clowns began and remain a tradition of the parade.
By 2004, the parade was drawing crowds of over half a million. In 2011, the parade route moved its southbound leg from Yonge Street, via Dundas Street West, to Avenue Road, Queen&#x27;s Park Crescent and University Avenue, concluding at St. Lawrence Market; the change was made in order to provide more space for floats and spectators. In 2019, the route changed to begin from the east end of the city at Bloor and Parliament, owing to construction at its usual starting point.

The 2020 parade was cancelled as a public event due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Toronto. A broadcast-only version of the parade was filmed at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland in Vaughan. It aired on December 5, 2020, and featured musical performances from Meghan Trainor, Shaggy and Dolly Parton. The 2021 edition of the parade would once again be broadcast-only; organizers stated that it would be logistically difficult to enforce Ontario&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccine mandate during such a large scale event, and also cited safety concerns due to children under 11 years of age not yet being eligible for COVID-19 vaccines. The parade returned to a public event, with its traditional route, in 2022.

==Funding issues==
In November 2024, the parade&#x27;s CEO reported a $250,000 shortfall in the event&#x27;s 2025 budget and launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money. Usually, 75 to 85% of the parade&#x27;s funding comes from corporate sponsorship with the remainder being funded by the provincial 
government, but an increase in costs and decrease in corporate sponsorship since the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a projected shortfall. Subsequent to the announcement of the parade&#x27;s financial difficulties, an initial $75,000 was raised from the public and the city government contributed $100,000 to the event, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promising that the federal government would also contribute, which would be the first time all three levels of government provided funding. Parade CEO Clay Charters told CBC News &quot;all of our fundraising right now and our efforts with corporate sponsorship and these conversations we&#x27;ve been having with the various levels of government are all about ensuring that the parade has a foundation from which we can operate into the new year and begin planning.&quot;

==Broadcasting==
From 1952 to 1981, CBC Television broadcast the parade. The parade aired on CFRB radio from the 1930s through the 1950s and then on CBC Radio. CHFI-FM is an official sponsor of the parade and its current radio broadcaster having taken over from CBC Radio in the 1980s. In 1973, the parade received its first French-language television broadcast on Télé-Métropole. The broadcast was hosted by the puppets from the francophone children&#x27;s series &quot;Nic et Pic&quot;.

Global carried the parade from 1984 to 2009.

On April 6, 2010, it was announced that CTV had acquired the rights to the parade, with the telecast airing on CTV and CP24. From 2010 until 2023, the parade was streamed live on CP24&#x27;s website and then broadcast nationally as an early evening special on a tape delayed basis on CTV, in early December. 

The 2024 edition of the parade was the first to be streamed live on YouTube. The livestream was anchored by CHFI hosts Pooja Handa and Gurdeep Ahluwalia.

===Foreign coverage===
In the United States, the Toronto Santa Claus Parade was one of several formerly featured by CBS as part of its &quot;All American Thanksgiving Day Parade&quot; special, which featured unofficial coverage of the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City, as well as pre-recorded coverage from other major Christmas and Thanksgiving holiday parades in the United States. This aspect has since been dropped, and the special has since only covered the Macy&#x27;s parade.

The Global Television Network made its feed of the parade available in several other countries, including New Zealand, Ireland and Norway, primarily by broadcasters owned by or affiliated with Global&#x27;s parent company CanWest between 1984 and 2009. From 1989 to 1991, the parade was also broadcast in the Soviet Union, leading to Russia being invited to participate in the parade in 1991.

==Access and transit closures==
Streets around the downtown core are closed from approximately 8:00 a.m. through the afternoon of parade day. While some parking is available, organizers encourage viewers to take public transit. GO Transit (via Union Station) and Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s subway stations provide access to the parade route.

<text>In music, a ninth is a compound interval consisting of an octave plus a second.

Like the second, the interval of a ninth is classified as a dissonance in common practice tonality. Since a ninth is an octave larger than a second, its sonority level is considered less dense.

==Major ninth==

A major ninth is a compound musical interval spanning 14 semitones, or an octave plus 2 semitones. If transposed into a single octave, it becomes a major second or minor seventh. The major ninth is somewhat dissonant in sound.

===Transposition===
Some common transposing instruments sound a major ninth lower than written.
These include the tenor saxophone, the bass clarinet, the baritone/euphonium when written in treble clef, and the trombone when written in treble clef (British brass band music).

When baritone/euphonium or trombone parts are written in bass clef or tenor clef they sound as written.

==Minor ninth==

A minor ninth (m9 or -9) is a compound musical interval spanning 13 semitones, or 1 semitone above an octave (thus it is enharmonically equivalent to an augmented octave). If transposed into a single octave, it becomes a minor second or major seventh. The minor ninth is rather dissonant in sound, and in European classical music, often appears as a suspension. Béla Bartók wrote a study in minor 9ths for piano. The fourth movement (an intermezzo) of Robert Schumann&#x27;s &quot;Faschingsschwank aus Wien&quot; is constructed to feature prominent notes of the melody a minor ninth above the accompaniment: Alexander Scriabin&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 9, &#x27;Black Mass&#x27; is based around the interval of a minor ninth, creating an uncomfortable and harsh sound. Several of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s works open with a striking gesture that includes the interval of a minor 9th, either as a chord: &quot;Les Noces&quot; (1923) and &quot;Threni&quot; (1958); or as an upward melodic leap: &quot;Capriccio for Piano and Orchestra&quot; (1929), &quot;Symphony in Three Movements&quot; (1946), and &quot;Movements for Piano and Orchestra&quot; (1960).

==Augmented ninth==

An augmented ninth is a compound musical interval spanning 15 semitones, or 3 semitones above an octave. Enharmonically equivalent to a compound minor third, if transposed into a single octave, it becomes a minor third or major sixth.

See: Dominant seventh sharp ninth chord.

==Ninth chords==

Three types of ninth chords may be distinguished: dominant (9), major (M9), and minor (m9). They may easily be remembered as the chord quality of the seventh does not change with the addition of the second scale degree, which is a major second in both major and minor, thus:

 0 4 7 t + 2 = dominant seventh + ninth = dominant ninth chord
 0 4 7 e + 2 = major seventh + ninth = major ninth chord
 0 3 7 t + 2 = minor seventh + ninth = minor ninth chord

The dominant ninth (V9) is a dominant seventh plus a major or minor ninth.

<text>Patricia Dianne Krenwinkel (born December 3, 1947) is an American convicted murderer and former member of the Manson Family. On August 9, 1969, Patricia Krenwinkel, Tex Watson, and Susan Atkins murdered pregnant actress Sharon Tate, Jay Sebring, Wojciech Frykowski, Abigail Folger, and Steven Parent at 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles. During her time with Manson&#x27;s group, she was known by various aliases such as Big Patty, Yellow, Marnie Reeves and Mary Ann Scott, but to The Family, she was most commonly known as Katie.

Following the 2009 death of fellow Manson cult member Susan Atkins, Krenwinkel is now the longest-incarcerated female inmate in the California penal system.

==Early life==

Patricia Krenwinkel was born on December 3, 1947, in Los Angeles, California, to an insurance-salesman father and a homemaker mother. She attended University High School and then Westchester High School, both in the Los Angeles area. Patricia was often bullied at school by other students, suffered from low self-esteem, and was frequently teased for being overweight and for an excessive growth of body hair caused by an endocrine condition.

After her parents divorced, seventeen-year-old Krenwinkel remained in Los Angeles with her father until she graduated from Westchester High School. For a time, she taught catechism (Roman Catholic religious instruction) and considered becoming a nun. She decided to attend the Jesuit college Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama. Within one semester, however, she dropped out and moved back to California. Moving into her half-sister&#x27;s apartment in Manhattan Beach, she found an office job as a processing clerk.

==Manson Family==

She met Charles Manson in Manhattan Beach in 1967, along with Lynette Fromme and Mary Brunner. In later interviews, Krenwinkel stated that she had sex with Manson the first night they met, and that he was the first person who told her she was beautiful. Mesmerized by Manson&#x27;s charisma and starved for attention, she decided to go to San Francisco with him and the other two girls, leaving behind her apartment, car, and last paycheck.

As the Manson Family grew, Katie (as Krenwinkel was now known) and the others went on a drug- and sex-filled 18-month tour of the American west in an old school bus. She would later recount an idealized version of The Family&#x27;s early days: &quot;We were just like wood nymphs and wood creatures. We would run through the woods with flowers in our hair, and Charles would have a small flute&quot;.

In the summer of 1968, Krenwinkel and fellow Family member Ella Bailey were hitchhiking around Los Angeles when Beach Boys founding member and drummer Dennis Wilson picked them up. After being invited to his home while he continued on to a recording session, Krenwinkel and Bailey were able to contact the Family and tell them of their new &quot;crash pad&quot;. When Wilson returned later that evening, he found Manson and the rest of the Family eating his food, sleeping in his bedrooms, and partying inside and outside his home. The group ended up staying for several months. After causing financial problems for Wilson, Manson and the rest of the Family left his mansion.

In August 1968, Krenwinkel and the Family persuaded the nearly blind and elderly George Spahn to allow them to live on his property, Spahn Ranch, in the hills above the San Fernando Valley.

== Tate–LaBianca murders ==

Krenwinkel was a participant in the murders on August 9, 1969, at 10050 Cielo Drive, home of actress Sharon Tate and four others. After stabbing Abigail Folger, Krenwinkel went back inside and summoned Tex Watson, who also stabbed Folger. During her trial, Krenwinkel said, &quot;I stabbed her and I kept stabbing her.&quot; When asked how it felt, Krenwinkel replied: &quot;Nothing, I mean, what is there to describe? It was just there, and it was right.&quot;

Krenwinkel participated willingly in more murders the following night. She recounted during her December 29, 2016, parole hearing the events of the night of August 10, 1969. Along with Manson, Watson, Atkins, Clem Grogan, Leslie Van Houten, and Linda Kasabian, she went to the home of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca where she, Watson, and Van Houten murdered the couple.

When later questioned, she claimed the only thing going through her mind at the time was that &quot;Now he won&#x27;t be sending any of his children off to war.&quot; Before hitchhiking back to Spahn Ranch, the trio stayed a while in the LaBianca home — eating food, showering, and playing with the LaBiancas&#x27; two dogs.

== Arrest ==

While the Los Angeles police were busy investigating any leads they could find, back at Spahn Ranch, rumors of the involvement of Krenwinkel and the others in the murders began to circulate. Due to an unrelated investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, parts of stolen cars were spotted in and around the ranch by helicopter. One week after the murders on August 16, 1969, Krenwinkel, Manson and other Family members were rounded up by police and arrested on suspicion of auto theft. Because of a date error, the search warrant was later ruled invalid, and the group was released. Following this incident, the Family started to lose members one by one, due to the raid, the possible involvement of the Family in the Tate-LaBianca murders, and the newly rumored murder of Spahn ranch hand Donald &quot;Shorty&quot; Shea.

Because of the raid on August 16, Manson decided to move his &quot;Family&quot; to another ranch, this time near Death Valley. Barker Ranch now became home for the Family, including Krenwinkel. During their stay from August through October, the group spent its time converting cars it had stolen into dune buggies, but law enforcement eventually caught up with Manson and his followers. On October 10, 1969, the group was once again arrested. This time, Krenwinkel&#x27;s father bailed her out of jail, but she immediately returned to Barker Ranch. Upon her return, Manson (who was not present in the October 10 raid), ordered her to go to Alabama and live with her mother until he sent word for her to come home. The orders to return never came, however, because of Manson&#x27;s subsequent arrest on October 12 at Barker Ranch.

Meanwhile, still in jail, Susan Atkins began to tell all about their involvement in the Tate-LaBianca murders to cellmates Virginia Graham and Veronica &quot;Ronnie&quot; Howard. Because of Atkins&#x27; confessions and Howard&#x27;s disclosure, Krenwinkel was arrested near her aunt&#x27;s home in Mobile, Alabama on December 1, 1969. The following day, Krenwinkel was indicted for seven counts of first-degree murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder. After her arrest, Krenwinkel claimed that she had gone to Alabama because she feared Manson would find her and kill her, hence her attempt to fight extradition to California. Finally, in February 1970, she waived extradition proceedings and voluntarily returned to California to stand trial with defendants Manson, Van Houten, and Atkins. Watson was tried separately at a later date after unsuccessfully fighting extradition from his home state of Texas.

== Trial ==

Krenwinkel&#x27;s trial attorney, Paul Fitzgerald, suggested that although her fingerprints were found inside the Tate home, she might just have been &quot;an invited guest or friend.&quot; Seemingly unfazed by the possibility of a guilty verdict and a death sentence, Krenwinkel reportedly spent much of the trial drawing doodles of devils and other Satanic figures. All during the trial, she remained loyal to Manson and the Family. Demonstration of this unity included walking hand-in-hand with Atkins and Van Houten, singing songs written by Manson, as well as shaving their heads and carving an &quot;X&quot; on their foreheads, just as Manson was doing.

At the end of the nine-month trial, Krenwinkel was convicted of all counts and sentenced to death on March 29, 1971. She and the other two women were transferred from Los Angeles to the California Institution for Women (CIW) near Corona, California.

== Prison life ==
Krenwinkel arrived on
California&#x27;s death row on April 28, 1971. She received a death sentence for seven counts of first-degree murder for the August 9, 1969, deaths of Abigail Ann Folger, Wojciech Frykowski, Steven Earl Parent, Sharon Tate Polanski and Jay Sebring and the August 10, 1969, deaths of Leno and Rosemary La Bianca. She was also convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. The death sentence imposed on Krenwinkel (as well as Manson, Watson, Atkins, and Van Houten) was automatically commuted to life in prison after the California Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;People v. Anderson&quot; decision invalidated all death sentences imposed in California prior to 1972.

At the beginning of her life in prison, Krenwinkel remained loyal to Manson and the Family, but over time began to break away from them. In distancing herself from Manson, she has maintained a perfect prison record, and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Human Services from the University of La Verne.

She is active with prison programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous and, along with these involvements, she has also taught illiterate prisoners how to read. Reportedly, Krenwinkel writes both poetry and music, plays the guitar, plays on a prison volleyball team and gives dance lessons.

Krenwinkel&#x27;s initial parole consideration hearing was held on July 17, 1978. During a 2004 parole hearing, when asked who she would place at the top of the list of people she had harmed, Patricia Krenwinkel responded, &quot;Myself&quot;.

In an interview conducted by Diane Sawyer in 1994, Krenwinkel stated: &quot;I wake up every day knowing that I&#x27;m a destroyer of the most precious thing, which is life; and I do that because that&#x27;s what I deserve, is to wake up every morning and know that&quot;. During that same interview, she expressed the most remorse for what she did to Folger, telling Diane Sawyer, &quot;That was just a young woman that I killed, who had parents. She was supposed to live a life and her parents were never supposed to see her dead&quot;.

During that same interview, she said Manson was &quot;absolutely lying&quot; about not ordering the murders. She said, &quot;There wasn&#x27;t one thing done—that was even allowed to be done— without his express permission&quot;. She was denied parole following that hearing because, according to the panel, Krenwinkel still posed an &quot;unacceptable risk to public safety&quot;. At her January 2011 hearing, the two-member parole board said that the 63-year-old Krenwinkel would not be eligible for parole again for seven years. The panel said they were swayed by the memory of the crimes, along with 80 letters which came from all over the world urging Krenwinkel&#x27;s continued incarceration.

In Krenwinkel&#x27;s parole hearing on December 29, 2016, the decision was postponed to investigate the defense claim that Krenwinkel was suffering from battered woman syndrome at the hands of Manson during the time of the murders. The parole hearing resumed on June 22, 2017, when the 69-year-old Krenwinkel was denied parole. After her 2017 review, Krenwinkel has been denied parole fourteen times.
Following the 2009 death of fellow Manson cult member Susan Atkins, Krenwinkel is now the longest-incarcerated female inmate in the California penal system. Admitted to prison in April 1971, she has been continuously incarcerated for more than 50 years.

Krenwinkel was granted parole on May 26, 2022. On October 14, 2022, Governor Gavin Newsom reversed the decision, citing the continued threat she would pose to society if released.

Krenwinkel remains incarcerated at the California Institution for Women in Chino, California.

==In popular culture==
Patricia Krenwinkel was portrayed by actress Christina Hart in the made-for-TV film &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; (1976), and in the film&#x27;s 2004 remake by actress Allison Smith. She was also portrayed by Leslie Orr in the film &quot;The Manson Family&quot; (2003), by Kaniehtiio Horn in &quot;Leslie, My Name Is Evil&quot; (2009), by Vanessa Zima in &quot;Manson Girls&quot; (2013) and Serena Lorien in &quot;House of Manson&quot; (2014). Olivia Klaus made a documentary short film on Krenwinkel, &quot;Life After Manson.&quot; The film was shown at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival and included her first interview in 20 years. On television, Madisen Beaty portrayed Krenwinkel in the 2015–16 series &quot;Aquarius&quot;, while Leslie Grossman portrayed her in the 2017 season of &quot;American Horror Story: Cult&quot;. Krenwinkel was portrayed by Sosie Bacon in Mary Harron&#x27;s &quot;Charlie Says&quot; (2018) and played once again by Beaty (listed in the credits as &quot;Katie&quot;) in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; (2019).

<text>In music theory, an eleventh is a compound interval consisting of an octave plus a fourth.

A perfect eleventh spans 17 and the augmented eleventh 18 semitones, or 10 steps in a diatonic scale.

Since there are only seven degrees in a diatonic scale, the eleventh degree is the same as the subdominant (IV). The eleventh is considered highly dissonant with the major third.

An eleventh chord is the stacking of five thirds in the span of an eleventh. In common practice tonality, it usually had subdominant function as minor eleventh chord on the second degree (supertonic) of the major scale.

<doc id="428268" wikidata="Q2140261" url="?curid=428268" title="Thirteenth">
<text>In music or music theory, a thirteenth is the note thirteen scale degrees from the root of a chord and also the interval between the root and the thirteenth. The thirteenth is most commonly major or minor .

A thirteenth chord is the stacking of six (major or minor) thirds, the last being above the 11th of an eleventh chord. Thus a thirteenth chord is a tertian (built from thirds) chord containing the interval of a thirteenth, and is an extended chord if it includes the ninth and/or the eleventh. &quot;The jazzy thirteenth is a very versatile chord and is used in many genres.&quot; Since 13th chords tend to become unclear or confused with other chords when inverted, they are generally found in root position. For example, depending on voicing, a major triad with an added major sixth is usually called a sixth chord , because the sixth serves as a substitution for the major seventh, thus considered a chord tone in such context. 

However, Walter Piston, writing in 1952, considered that, &quot;a true thirteenth chord, arrived at by superposition of thirds, is a rare phenomenon even in 20th-century music.&quot; This may be due to four-part writing, instrument limitations, and voice leading and stylistic considerations. For example, &quot;to make the chord more playable [on guitar], thirteenth chords often omit the fifth and the ninth.&quot;

==Dominant thirteenth==
Most commonly, 13th chords serve a dominant function (V13), whether they have the exact intervals of a dominant thirteenth or not. Typically, a dominant chord anticipating a major resolution will feature a natural 13, while a dominant chord anticipating a minor resolution will feature a flat 13. Since thirteenth chords contain more than four notes, in four-voice writing the root, third, seventh, and thirteenth are most often included, excluding the fifth, ninth, and eleventh . The third indicates the quality of the chord as major or minor, the seventh is important for the quality as a dominant chord, while the thirteenth is necessary in a thirteenth chord.

In modern pop and jazz harmony, after the dominant thirteenth, a thirteenth chord (usually notated as &quot;X13&quot;, e.g. C13) contains an implied flatted seventh interval. Thus, a C13 consists of C, E, G, B, and A. The underlying harmony during a thirteenth chord is usually Mixolydian or Lydian dominant (see chord-scale system). A thirteenth chord does not imply the quality of the ninth or eleventh scale degrees. In general, what gives a thirteenth chord its characteristic sound is the dissonance between the flat seventh and the thirteenth, an interval of a major seventh.

In the common practice period the &quot;most common&quot; pitches present in V13 chord are the root, 3rd, 7th, and 13th; with the 5th, 9th, and 11th &quot;typically omitted&quot;. The 13th is most often in the soprano, or highest voice, and usually resolves down by a 3rd to the tonic I or i. If the V13 is followed by a I9 the 13th may resolve to the 9th.

==Other thirteenth chords==

These voice leading guidelines may not be followed after the common practice period in techniques such as parallel harmony and in the following example:

13th chords may less often be built on degrees other than the dominant, such as the tonic or subdominant.

While the dominant thirteenth is the most common thirteenth chord, the major thirteenth is also fairly common. A major thirteenth chord (containing a major seventh) will nearly always feature a chromatically raised eleventh (C E G B D F A) (see Lydian mode), except for cases when the eleventh is omitted altogether. &quot;It is customary to omit the eleventh on dominant or major thirteenth chords because the eleventh conflicts with the third,&quot; in these chords by a semitone.

==Inversions==
Generally found in root position, the inversion of a complete thirteenth chord including &quot;all&quot; seven notes, itself, &quot;a rare phenomenon&quot;, is a theoretical impossibility since a new thirteenth chord with a different root is produced, for example Cmaj13 (C-E-G-B-D-F-A) becomes Em139 (E-G-B-D-F-A-C) then G13 (G-B-D-F-A-C-E), and so on, when inverted.

==Gallery==
Given the number of notes that may be included, there are a great variety of thirteenth chords. The following chords are notated below lead sheet symbols:

<text>A suspended chord (or sus chord) is a musical chord in which the (major or minor) third is omitted and replaced with a perfect fourth or a major second. The lack of a minor or a major third in the chord creates an open sound, while the dissonance between the fourth and fifth or second and root creates tension. When using popular-music symbols, they are indicated by the symbols &quot;sus4&quot; and &quot;sus2&quot;. For example, the suspended fourth and second chords built on C (C–E–G), written as Csus4 and Csus2, have pitches C–F-G and C–D-G, respectively.&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;

 &lt;c f g&gt;1 &lt;c d g&gt;1
&lt;/score&gt;Suspended fourth and second chords can be represented by the integer notation {0, 5, 7} and {0, 2, 7}, respectively.

==Analysis==
The term is borrowed from the contrapuntal technique of &quot;suspension&quot;, where a note from a previous chord is carried over to the next chord, and then resolved down to the third or tonic, &quot;suspending&quot; a note from the previous chord. However, in modern usage the term concerns only the notes played at a given time – the suspended tone does not necessarily resolve and is not necessarily &quot;prepared&quot; (i.e., held over) from the prior chord. As such, after Csus4 (C–F–G), F may resolve to E (or E, in the case of C minor), but in rock and popular music the term indicates only the harmonic structure with no implications about what comes before or after, though preparation of the fourth still occurs about half the time and traditional resolution of the fourth occurs usually. In modern jazz, a third can be added to the chord voicing, as long as it is above the fourth.

Each suspended chord has two inversions. Suspended second chords are inversions of suspended fourth chords, and vice versa. For example, Gsus2 (G–A–D) is the first inversion of Dsus4 (D–G–A) which is the second inversion of Gsus2 (G–A–D). The sus2 and sus4 chords both have inversions that create quartal and quintal chords (A–D–G, G–D–A) with two stacked perfect fourths or perfect fifths.

Sevenths on suspended chords are &quot;virtually always minor sevenths&quot; (7sus4), while the 9sus4 chord is similar to an eleventh chord and may be notated as such. For example, C9sus4 (C–F–G–B–D) may be notated C11 (C–G–B–D–F).

==Jazz sus chord==
A jazz sus chord or 9sus4 chord is a dominant ninth chord with a suspended fourth, typically appearing on the dominant 5th degree of a major key. Functionally, it can be written as V9sus4. For example, the jazz sus chord built on G, written as G9sus4 has pitches G–C–D–F-A.
&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \clef treble
 \time 4/4
 \key c \major
 &lt;g c d f a&gt;1
&lt;/score&gt;
Compared to the otherwise similar dominant eleventh chord, the dominant 9sus4 chord generally does not include the third factor. It may be thought of as a slash chord: G9sus4 without the 5th (G–C–F–A) is equivalent to F/G (G–F–A–C). It may also be written Dm7/G, which shows the merging of ii7 and V7 functions in one chord. Although the suspended fourth is not always resolved down to a third, the note is still not usually notated as an eleventh because of the chord&#x27;s function as a cadence point to the tonic.

It is also possible to have the third included in a sus chord, the third being generally voiced above the fourth (i.e. as a tenth) though this is not absolutely necessary. For example, a G9sus4 chord played on a piano could have its root note played with the left hand, and the notes (from the bottom up) C (suspended 4th), F, A, and B (the third) with the right hand.

Red Garland&#x27;s piano introduction to &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird&quot; on the Miles Davis album &quot;&#x27;Round About Midnight&quot; features suspended 9th chords. In his book &quot;Thinking in Jazz&quot;, Paul Berliner writes at length and in detail about how the improvisation unfolds from this opening.

With the advent of modal jazz in the 1960s, suspended chords were to feature with increasing regularity. For example, they dominate the structure of Herbie Hancock&#x27;s 1965 composition &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot;. In his book, &quot;What to Listen For in Jazz&quot;, Barry Kernfeld cites Hancock&#x27;s own explanation of how the harmony works: &quot;You start with a 7th chord with the 11th on the bottom—a 7th chord with a suspended 4th—and then that chord moves up a minor third. ... It doesn&#x27;t have any cadences; it just keeps moving around in a circle.&quot; Kernfeld comments: &quot;Thus in addition to a slow-paced harmonic rhythm, this composition features chords that individually and collectively avoid a strong sense of tonal function.&quot; Kernfeld admires the way that &quot;Hancock&#x27;s cleverly ambiguous chords intentionally obscure the identity&quot; of a particular key. Roger Scruton sees the jazz sus chord in &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; as opening &quot;a completely new harmonic perspective... as we come to understand sus chords on the tonic as supporting improvisations on the dominant.&quot;

==Examples in popular music==
Suspended chords are commonly found in folk music and popular music. Ian MacDonald writes of the &quot;heartbreaking suspensions&quot; that characterise the harmony of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; from the Beatles&#x27; final album &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970). MacDonald describes another Beatles song &quot;Yes It Is&quot; as having &quot;rich and unusual harmonic motion&quot; through its use of suspensions. Joni Mitchell was perhaps one of the most prolific songwriters to make extensive use of multiple sus chords, explaining that &quot;so much in my life was unresolved from &#x27;when were they going to drop the big one?&#x27; to &#x27;where is my daughter?&#x27; that I had to use unresolved chords to convey my unresolved questions&quot;.

The instrumental opening to The Four Tops’ song &quot;Reach Out I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; (1966) features an E chord containing a suspended fourth, resolved immediately by being followed by an E minor chord. Burt Bacharach&#x27;s &quot;The Look of Love&quot; in the arrangement performed by Dusty Springfield (1967) opens with a clearly audible Dm7 suspension. Carole King&#x27;s song &quot;I Feel the Earth Move&quot; from her album &quot;Tapestry&quot; (1971) features a striking B9sus4 chord at the end of the phrase &quot;mellow as the month of May&quot;. The last chord of the first bridge of The Police&#x27;s &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot; is an unresolved suspended chord, the introduction and chorus of Shocking Blue&#x27;s &quot;Venus&quot; each contain an unresolved suspended chord, and the introduction of Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; has two different suspended chords without traditional resolution. The verses of Oasis’s Champagne Supernova (1996) is entirely based on an Asus2 chord. 

==Examples in classical music==

Examples of suspended chords can be found in the pieces below (usually in connection with pedal points).

The piano postlude to the song &quot;Ich grolle nicht&quot; from Robert Schumann&#x27;s 1844 song cycle &quot;Dichterliebe&quot;.

The concluding bars of the Prelude to Wagner&#x27;s final opera &quot;Parsifal&quot; (1882):

<text>The red-whiskered bulbul (Pycnonotus jocosus), or crested bulbul, is a passerine bird native to Asia. It is a member of the bulbul family. It is a resident frugivore found mainly in tropical Asia. It has been introduced in many tropical areas of the world where populations have established themselves. It has a loud three or four note call, feeds on fruits and small insects and perches conspicuously on trees. It is common in hill forests and urban gardens.

==Taxonomy==
The red-whiskered bulbul was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Lanius jocosus&quot;. The specific epithet is from Latin &quot;ioculus&quot; meaning &quot;merry&quot; (from &quot;iocus&quot; meaning &quot;joke&quot;). Linnaeus based his description on the &quot;Sitta Chinensis&quot; that had been described in 1757 by the Swedish naturalist Pehr Osbeck. Linnaeus specified the location as &quot;China&quot; but this was restricted to Hong Kong and Guangdong by Herbert Girton Deignan in 1948. The red-whiskered bulbul is now placed in the genus &quot;Pycnonotus&quot; that was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826.

Hybrids have been noted in captivity with the red-vented, white-eared, white-spectacled, black-capped and Himalayan bulbuls. Leucism has also been recorded.

===Subspecies===
Nine subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;P. j. fuscicaudatus&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in western and central India. Has a nearly complete breast band and no white tip to tail. 
* &quot;P. j. abuensis&quot; - : Found in north-western India (type locality Mount Abu) Is pale and has a broken breast band and no white tip to tail. 
* &quot;P. j. pyrrhotis&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species in the genus &quot;Ixos&quot;. Found in the Terai of northern India and Nepal. It is pale above with white tail tips and a widely separated breast band
* &quot;P. j. emeria&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species in the genus &quot;Motacilla&quot;. Found from eastern India to south-western Thailand. Is warm brown above with a slim bill and a long crest (also introduced into Florida)
* &quot;P. j. whistleri&quot; - : Found in the Andaman Islands and has a warm brown plumage above, a heavier bill and a shorter crest than &quot;P. j. emeria&quot;
* &quot;P. j. monticola&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species in the genus &quot;Ixos&quot;. Found from eastern Himalayas to northern Myanmar and southern China and has darker upperparts than &quot;P. j. pyrrhotis&quot;
* &quot;P. j. jocosus&quot; - : Found in south-eastern China
* &quot;P. j. hainanensis&quot; - : Found on Hainan Island (off south-eastern China)
* &quot;P. j. pattani&quot; - : Found from southern Myanmar and northern Malay Peninsula through Thailand, southern Indochina and even in java and Sumatra

==Description==
The red-whiskered bulbul is about in length. It has brown upper-parts and whitish underparts with buff flanks and a dark spur running onto the breast at shoulder level. It has a tall pointed black crest, red face patch and thin black moustachial line. The tail is long and brown with white terminal feather tips, but the vent area is red. Juveniles lack the red patch behind the eye, and the vent area is rufous-orange.

The loud and evocative call is a sharp &quot;kink-a-joo&quot; (also transcribed as &quot;pettigrew&quot; or &quot;kick-pettigrew&quot; or &quot;pleased to meet you&quot;) and the song is a scolding chatter. They are more often heard than seen, but will often perch conspicuously especially in the mornings when they call from the tops of trees. The life span is about 11 years.

==Distribution and habitat==

This is a bird of lightly wooded areas, more open country with bushes and shrubs, and farmland. Irruptions have been noted from early times with Thomas C. Jerdon noting that they were &quot;periodically visiting Madras and other wooded towns in large flocks.&quot;

It has established itself in Australia and in Los Angeles, Hawaii, and Florida in the United States, as well as in Mauritius, on Assumption Island and Mascarene Islands. In Florida, it is only found in a small area, and its population could be extirpated easily.
It was eradicated from Assumption Island in 2013–2015 to prevent colonisation of nearby Aldabra, the largest introduced bird-free tropical island.

The red-whiskered bulbul was introduced by the Zoological and Acclimatization Society in 1880 to Sydney, became well established across the suburbs by 1920, and continued to spread slowly to around 100 km away. It is now also found in suburban Melbourne and Adelaide, although it is unclear how they got there.

==Behaviour and ecology==

On the island of Réunion, this species established itself and also aided the spread of alien plant species such as &quot;Rubus alceifolius&quot;. In Florida they feed on fruits and berries of as many as 24 exotic plants including loquat (&quot;Eriobotrya japonica&quot;), &quot;Lantana&quot; spp., Brazilian pepper (&quot;Schinus terebinthifolius&quot;) and figs (&quot;Ficus&quot;). In Mauritius they aid the dispersal of &quot;Ligustrum robustum&quot; and &quot;Clidemia hirta&quot;. Seeds that pass through their gut germinate better. Populations of the red-whiskered bulbul on the island of Réunion have diversified in the course of thirty years and show visible variations in bill morphology according to the food resources that they have adapted to utilize.

===Breeding===
The breeding season is spread out and peaks from December to May in southern India and March to October in northern India. Breeding may occur once or twice a year. The courtship display of the male involves head bowing, spreading the tail and drooping wings. The nest is cup-shaped, and is built on bushes, thatched walls or small trees. It is woven of fine twigs, roots, and grasses, and embellished with large objects such as bark strips, paper, or plastic bags. Clutches typically contain two or three eggs. Adults (possibly the female) may feign injury to distract potential predators away from the nest. The eggs have a pale mauve ground colour with speckles becoming blotches towards the broad end. Eggs measure 21 mm and are 16 mm wide. Eggs take 12 days to hatch. Both parents take part in raising the young. Young birds are fed on caterpillars and insects which are replaced by fruits and berries as they mature. The chicks are psilopaedic (having down only in the pterylae). Eggs and chicks may be preyed on by the greater coucal and crows.

They defend territories of about during the breeding season. They roost communally in loose groups of a hundred or more birds.

===Food and feeding===
The red-whiskered bulbul feeds on fruits (including those of the yellow oleander that are toxic to mammals), nectar and insects.

===Health===
Several avian malaria parasites have been described from the species. &quot;Plasmodium jiangi&quot; was first discovered by He and Huang (1993) in this host, in southeast China.

== In culture ==
This species was once a popular cage bird in parts of India. C. W. Smith noted that 
:These birds are in great request among the natives, being of a fearless disposition, and easily reclaimed. They are taught to sit on the hand, and numbers may thus be seen in any Indian bazaar.

The species continues to be a popular cagebird in parts of Southeast Asia.

<text>Symphony No. 40 in G minor, K. 550 was written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1788. It is one of his most celebrated and widely performed works.

== History ==

=== Composition ===
Mozart had already written a G minor symphony as a precocious 17-year-old, following the then-current trend of &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; in music. This was his 25th symphony; it is sometimes called the &quot;little G minor symphony&quot; to distinguish it from the mature work discussed here. The two are the only extant minor key among Mozart&#x27;s symphonies.

The date of completion of the 40th Symphony is known exactly, since Mozart in his mature years kept a full catalog of his completed works; he entered the 40th Symphony into it on 25 July 1788. Work on the symphony occupied an exceptionally productive period of just a few weeks during which time he also completed the 39th and 41st symphonies (26 June and 10 August, respectively). Nikolaus Harnoncourt conjectured that Mozart composed the three symphonies as a unified work, pointing, among other things, to the fact that the Symphony No. 40, as the middle work, has no introduction (unlike No. 39) and does not have a finale of the scale of No. 41&#x27;s.

The 40th symphony exists in two versions, differing primarily in that one includes parts for a pair of clarinets (with suitable adjustments made in the other wind parts). Most likely, the clarinet parts were added in a revised version. The autograph scores of both versions were acquired in the 1860s by Johannes Brahms, who later donated the manuscripts to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna, where they reside today.

=== Premiere ===
As Neal Zaslaw has pointed out, writers on Mozart have often suggested – or even asserted – that Mozart never heard his 40th Symphony performed. Some commentators go further, suggesting that Mozart wrote the symphony (and its companions, Nos. 39 and 41) without even intending it to be performed, but rather for posterity, as (to use Alfred Einstein&#x27;s words) an &quot;appeal to eternity&quot;.

Modern scholarship suggests that these conjectures are not correct. First, in a recently discovered 10 July 1802 letter by the musician Johann Wenzel (1762–1831) to the publisher Ambrosius Kühnel in Leipzig, Wenzel refers to a performance of the symphony at the home of Baron Gottfried van Swieten with Mozart present, but the execution was so poor that the composer had to leave the room.

There is strong circumstantial evidence for other, probably better, performances. On several occasions between the composition of the symphony and the composer&#x27;s death, symphony concerts were given featuring Mozart&#x27;s music for which copies of the program have survived, announcing a symphony unidentified by date or key. These include:

*Dresden, 14 April 1789, during Mozart&#x27;s Berlin journey
*Leipzig, 12 May 1789, on the same trip
*Frankfurt, 15 October 1790
*Copies survive of a poster for a concert given by the Tonkünstler-Societät (Society of Musicians) 17 April 1791 in the Burgtheater in Vienna, conducted by Mozart&#x27;s colleague Antonio Salieri. The first item on the program was billed as &quot;A Grand Symphony composed by Herr Mozart&quot;.

Most important is the fact that Mozart revised his symphony (see above). As Zaslaw says, this &quot;demonstrates that [the symphony] was performed, for Mozart would hardly have gone to the trouble of adding the clarinets and rewriting the flutes and oboes to accommodate them, had he not had a specific performance in view.&quot; The orchestra for the 1791 Vienna concert included the clarinetist brothers Anton and Johann Nepomuk Stadler; which, as Zaslaw points out, limits the possibilities to just the 39th and 40th symphonies.

Zaslaw adds: &quot;The version without clarinets must also have been performed, for the reorchestrated version of two passages in the slow movement, which exists in Mozart&#x27;s hand, must have resulted from his having heard the work and discovered an aspect needing improvement.&quot;

Regarding the concerts for which the Symphony was originally intended when it was composed in 1788, Otto Erich Deutsch suggests that Mozart was preparing to hold a series of three &quot;Concerts in the Casino&quot;, in a new casino in the Spiegelgasse owned by Philipp Otto. Mozart even sent a pair of tickets for this series to his friend Michael Puchberg. But it seems impossible to determine whether the concert series was held, or was cancelled for lack of interest.

== Music ==

The symphony is scored for flute, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets (in the 2nd version of 1791), 2 bassoons, 2 horns, and strings.

The work is in four movements, in the usual arrangement for a classical-style symphony (fast movement, slow movement, minuet, fast movement):
=== I. Molto allegro ===
The first movement begins darkly, not with its first theme but with the accompaniment, played by the lower strings with divided violas. The technique of beginning a work with an accompaniment figure was later used by Mozart in his last piano concerto (KV. 595) and later became a favorite of the Romantics (examples include the openings of Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto and Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Third Piano Concerto). The first theme is as follows.

=== II. Andante ===
The second movement is a lyrical work in time. It is in the subdominant key of the relative major of G minor (B major): E major. The contrapuntal opening bars of this movement appear thus in keyboard reduction:

=== III. Menuetto. Allegretto – Trio ===
The minuet begins with an angry, cross-accented hemiola rhythm and a pair of three-bar phrases, as shown in the following piano reduction:
The severe character of the minuet stands in contrast to the form&#x27;s traditional use as dance music, a genre frequently used by Mozart. The contrasting gentle trio section, in G major, alternates the playing of the string section with that of the winds.
=== IV. Finale. Allegro assai ===
The fourth movement opens with a series of rapidly ascending notes outlining the tonic triad illustrating what is commonly referred to as the Mannheim rocket.
A remarkable modulating passage in which every tone in the chromatic scale but one is played, strongly destabilizing the key, occurs at the beginning of the development section; the single note left out is G (the tonic):

== Legacy ==
=== Reception ===
This work has elicited varying interpretations from critics. Robert Schumann regarded it as possessing &quot;Grecian lightness and grace&quot;. Donald Tovey saw in it the character of &quot;opera buffa&quot;. It is perhaps a more common perception today that the symphony is tragic in tone and intensely emotional; for example, in &quot;The Classical Style&quot;, Charles Rosen calls the symphony &quot;a work of passion, violence, and grief&quot;.

Although interpretations differ, the symphony is unquestionably one of Mozart&#x27;s most greatly admired works, and it is frequently performed and recorded.

=== Influence ===
Ludwig van Beethoven knew the symphony well, copying out 29 bars from the score in one of his sketchbooks. As Gustav Nottebohm observed in 1887, the copied bars appear amid the sketches for Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony, whose third movement begins with a pitch sequence similar to that of Mozart&#x27;s finale (see example below).

Franz Schubert likewise copied down the music of Mozart&#x27;s minuet, and the minuet of his Fifth Symphony strongly evokes Mozart&#x27;s. Zaslaw has suggested that a passage late in Joseph Haydn&#x27;s oratorio &quot;The Seasons&quot; (1801), a meditation on death, quotes the second movement of the 40th Symphony and was included by Haydn as a memorial to his long-dead friend.

The symphony is a cornerstone of the classical repertoire and is frequently performed.

== Recordings ==
There are a great many recordings, both using modern instruments and with instruments more like those of Mozart&#x27;s time. The first known recording was issued by the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1915, with the Victor Concert Orchestra performing under the direction of Victor&#x27;s house conductor, Walter B. Rogers.

<doc id="428273" wikidata="Q2736593" url="?curid=428273" title="Blind signature">
<text>In cryptography a blind signature, as introduced by David Chaum, is a form of digital signature in which the content of a message is disguised (blinded) before it is signed. The resulting blind signature can be publicly verified against the original, unblinded message in the manner of a regular digital signature. Blind signatures are typically employed in privacy-related protocols where the signer and message author are different parties. Examples include cryptographic election systems and digital cash schemes.

An often-used analogy to the cryptographic blind signature is the physical act of a voter enclosing a completed anonymous ballot in a special carbon paper lined envelope that has the voter&#x27;s credentials pre-printed on the outside. An official verifies the credentials and signs the envelope, thereby transferring his signature to the ballot inside via the carbon paper. Once signed, the package is given back to the voter, who transfers the now signed ballot to a new unmarked normal envelope. Thus, the signer does not view the message content, but a third party can later verify the signature and know that the signature is valid within the limitations of the underlying signature scheme.
Blind signatures can also be used to provide &quot;unlinkability&quot;, which prevents the signer from linking the blinded message it signs to a later un-blinded version that it may be called upon to verify. In this case, the signer&#x27;s response is first &quot;un-blinded&quot; prior to verification in such a way that the signature remains valid for the un-blinded message. This can be useful in schemes where anonymity is required.

Blind signature schemes can be implemented using a number of common public key signing schemes, for instance RSA and DSA. To perform such a signature, the message is first &quot;blinded&quot;, typically by combining it in some way with a random &quot;blinding factor&quot;. The blinded message is passed to a signer, who then signs it using a standard signing algorithm. The resulting message, along with the blinding factor, can be later verified against the signer&#x27;s public key. In some blind signature schemes, such as RSA, it is even possible to remove the blinding factor from the signature before it is verified. In these schemes, the final output (message/signature) of the blind signature scheme is identical to that of the normal signing protocol.

==Uses==

Blind signature schemes see a great deal of use in applications where sender privacy is important. This includes various &quot;digital cash&quot; schemes and voting protocols.

For example, the integrity of some electronic voting system may require that each ballot be certified by an election authority before it can be accepted for counting; this allows the authority to check the credentials of the voter to ensure that they are allowed to vote, and that they are not submitting more than one ballot. Simultaneously, it is important that this authority does not learn the voter&#x27;s selections. An unlinkable blind signature provides this guarantee, as the authority will not see the contents of any ballot it signs, and will be unable to link the blinded ballots it signs back to the un-blinded ballots it receives for counting.

==Blind signature schemes==

Blind signature schemes exist for many public key signing protocols. More formally a blind signature scheme is a cryptographic protocol that involves two parties, a user Alice that wants to obtain signatures on her messages, and a signer Bob that is in possession of his secret signing key. At the end of the protocol Alice obtains Bob’s signature on &quot;m&quot; without Bob learning anything about the message. This intuition of not learning anything is hard to capture in mathematical terms. The usual approach is to show that for every (adversarial) signer, there exists a simulator that can output the same information as the signer. This is similar to the way zero-knowledge is defined in zero-knowledge proof systems.

===Blind RSA signatures===
One of the simplest blind signature schemes is based on RSA signing. A traditional RSA signature is computed by raising the message &quot;m&quot; to the secret exponent &quot;d&quot; modulo the public modulus &quot;N&quot;. The blind version uses a random value &quot;r&quot;, such that &quot;r&quot; is relatively prime to &quot;N&quot; (i.e. &quot;gcd&quot;(&quot;r&quot;, &quot;N&quot;) = 1). &quot;r&quot; is raised to the public exponent &quot;e&quot; modulo &quot;N&quot;, and the resulting value formula_1 is used as a blinding factor. The author of the message computes the product of the message and blinding factor, i.e.:

: formula_2

and sends the resulting value formula_3 to the signing authority. Because &quot;r&quot; is a random value and the mapping formula_4 is a permutation it follows that formula_5 is random too. This implies that formula_3 does not leak any information about &quot;m&quot;. The signing authority then calculates the blinded signature &quot;s&#x27; &quot; as:

: formula_7

&quot;s&#x27; &quot; is sent back to the author of the message, who can then remove the blinding factor to reveal &quot;s&quot;, the valid RSA signature of &quot;m&quot;:

: formula_8

This works because RSA keys satisfy the equation formula_9 and thus

: formula_10

hence &quot;s&quot; is indeed the signature of &quot;m&quot;.

In practice, the property that signing one blinded message produces at most one valid signed message is usually desired. This means one vote per signed ballot in elections, for example. This property does not hold for the simple scheme described above: the original message and the unblinded signature is valid, but so is the blinded message and the blind signature, and possibly other combinations given a clever attacker. A solution to this is to blind sign a cryptographic hash of the message, not the message itself.

==Dangers of RSA blind signing==

RSA is subject to the RSA blinding attack through which it is possible to be tricked into decrypting a message by blind signing another message. Since the signing process is equivalent to decrypting with the signer&#x27;s secret key, an attacker can provide a blinded version of a message formula_11 encrypted with the signer&#x27;s public key, formula_3 for them to sign. The encrypted message would usually be some secret information which the attacker observed being sent encrypted under the signer&#x27;s public key which the attacker wants to learn more about. When the attacker removes the blindness the signed version will have the clear text:

: formula_13

where formula_3 is the encrypted version of the message. When the message is signed, the cleartext formula_11 is easily extracted:

: formula_16

Note that formula_17 refers to Euler&#x27;s totient function. The message is now easily obtained.

: formula_18

This attack works because in this blind signature scheme the signer signs the message directly. By contrast, in an unblinded signature scheme the signer would typically use a padding scheme (e.g. by instead signing the result of a cryptographic hash function applied to the message, instead of signing the message itself), however since the signer does not know the actual message, any padding scheme would produce an incorrect value when unblinded. Due to this multiplicative property of RSA, the same key should never be used for both encryption and signing purposes.

<doc id="428276" wikidata="Q4475661" url="?curid=428276" title="Eleventh chord">
<text>In music theory, an eleventh chord is a chord that contains the tertian extension of the eleventh. Typically found in jazz, an eleventh chord also usually includes the seventh and ninth, and elements of the basic triad structure. Variants include the dominant eleventh (C11, C–E–G–B–D–F), minor eleventh (Cm11, C–E–G–B–D–F), and major eleventh chord (Cmaj11, C–E–G–B–D–F). Using an augmented eleventh produces the dominant sharp eleventh (C911, C–E–G–B–D–F) and major ninth sharp eleventh (Cmaj911, C–E–G–B–D–F) chords.

A perfect eleventh creates a highly dissonant minor ninth interval with the major third of major and dominant chords. To reduce this dissonance the third is often omitted (such as for example in the dominant eleventh chord that can be heard 52seconds into the song &quot;Sun King&quot; on The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album), turning the chord into a suspended ninth chord (e.g. C9sus4, C–G–B–D–F), which can be also notated as Gm7/C.

Another solution to this dissonance is altering the third or eleventh factor of the chord to turn the problematic minor ninth interval within the chord into a major ninth. A dominant eleventh chord can be altered by lowering the third by a semitone for a minor eleventh chord, or by raising the eleventh by a semitone for a dominant sharp eleventh chord, implying the lydian dominant mode.

As its upper extensions (7th, 9th, 11th) constitute a triad, a dominant eleventh chord with the third and fifth omitted can be notated as a compound chord with a bass note. So C–B–D–F is written as B/C, emphasizing the ambiguous dominant/subdominant character of this voicing.
In the common practice period, the root, 7th, 9th, and 11th are the most common factors present in the V11 chord, with the 3rd and 5th typically omitted. The eleventh is usually retained as a common tone when the chord resolves to I or i.

==Relation to suspended fourth chord==

The fourth degree is octave equivalent to the eleventh. The dominant eleventh chord could be alternatively notated as the very unorthodox ninth added fourth chord (C9add4), from where omitting the 3rd produces the more common ninth suspended fourth chord (C9sus4, also known as the jazz sus chord).

<doc id="428277" wikidata="Q1996188" url="?curid=428277" title="Ninth chord">
<text>In music theory, a ninth chord is a chord that encompasses the interval of a ninth when arranged in close position with the root in the bass.

Heinrich Schenker and also Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov allowed the substitution of the dominant seventh, leading-tone, and leading tone half-diminished seventh chords, but rejected the concept of a ninth chord on the basis that only that on the fifth scale degree (V9) was admitted and that inversion was not allowed of the ninth chord.

==Dominant ninth==

There is a difference between a major ninth chord and a dominant ninth chord. A dominant ninth is the combination of a dominant chord (with a minor seventh) and a major ninth. A major ninth chord (e.g., Cmaj9), as an extended chord, adds the major seventh along with the ninth to the major triad. Thus, a Cmaj9 consists of C, E, G, B and D. When the symbol &quot;9&quot; is not preceded by the word &quot;major&quot; or &quot;maj&quot; (e.g., C9), the chord is a dominant ninth. That is, the implied seventh chord is a dominant seventh, i.e. a major triad plus the minor seventh, to which the ninth is added: e.g., a C9 consists of C, E, G, B and D. C dominant ninth (C9) would usually be expected to resolve to an F major chord (the implied key, C being the dominant of F). The ninth is commonly chromatically altered by half-step either up or down to create more tension and dissonance. Fétis tuned the chord 4:5:6:7:9.

In the common practice period, &quot;the root, 3rd, 7th, and 9th are the most common factors present in the V9 chord,&quot; with the 5th, &quot;typically omitted&quot;. The ninth and seventh usually resolve downward to the fifth and third of I.

Example of tonic dominant ninth chords include Bobbie Gentry&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; and Wild Cherry&#x27;s &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot;. James Brown&#x27;s &quot;I Got You (I Feel Good)&quot; features a striking dominant 9th arpeggio played staccato at the end of the opening 12-bar sequence. The opening phrase of Chopin&#x27;s well-known &quot;Minute Waltz&quot; climaxes on a dominant 9th chord:

César Franck&#x27;s Violin Sonata in A Major opens with a dominant ninth chord (E9) in the piano part. When the violin enters in the fifth bar, its melody articulates an arpeggio of this chord.

Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Hommage a Rameau&quot;, the second of his first Book of &quot;Images&quot; for piano solo climaxes powerfully on a dominant 9th, expressed both as a chord and as a wide-ranging arpeggio:

The starting point of Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s piece for vocal sextet, &quot;Stimmung&quot; (1968) is a chord consisting of the notes B, F, B, D, A and C. According to Nicholas Cook, &quot;Stimmung&quot; could, in terms of conventional tonal harmony, be viewed as &quot;simply a dominant ninth chord that is subject to timbral variation. The notes the performers sing are harmonics 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 of the implied but absent fundamental—the B flat below the bass clef.&quot;

:(Dominant minor ninth chord on C)
A dominant minor ninth chord consists of a dominant seventh chord and a minor ninth. In C: C E G B D. Fétis tuned the chord 8:10:12:14:17. In notation for jazz and popular music, this chord is often denoted, e.g., C79. In Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Erlkönig&quot;, a terrified child calls out to his father when he sees an apparition of the sinister Elf King. The dissonant voicing of the dominant minor ninth chord used here (C79) is particularly effective in heightening the drama and sense of threat.

The minor ninth chord consists of a minor seventh chord and a major ninth. The formula is 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. This chord is written as Am9. This chord has a more &quot;bluesy&quot; sound and fits very well with the dominant ninth.

* &quot;Wedding Day at Troldhaugen&quot; (Edvard Grieg)
* &quot;In una stanza con poca luce&quot; (Ennio Morricone: &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot; soundtrack no. 18)

The major ninth chord consists of a major seventh chord and a major ninth. The formula is 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. This chord is written as Cmaj9.
==Relation to other chords with the ninth==

 The 6/9 chord is a pentad with a major triad joined by a sixth and ninth above the root, but no seventh. For example, C6/9 is C–E–G–A–D. It is not a tense chord requiring resolution, and is considered a substitute for the tonic in jazz. The minor 6/9 chord is a minor triad with an added 6th and 9th, evoking the Dorian mode, and is also suitable as a minor tonic in jazz.

The second degree is octave equivalent to the ninth. The ninth chord could be alternatively notated as seventh added second chord (C7add2), from where omitting the 3rd produces the seventh suspended second chord (C7sus2).

An add9 chord, or added ninth chord, is any chord with an added ninth – Cadd9 consists of C, E, G and D, Cmadd9 consists of C, E flat, G, and D, Cdimadd9 consists of C, E flat, G flat, and D, etc. Added ninth chords differ from other ninth chords because the seventh is not necessarily included. An add9 can also be added to an interval, like a C5, resulting in a C5add9 chord which consists of C and G (C5) with D as an added 9 (C, G, D). Note that if the note is within an octave from the root, it is a second, not a ninth. In the case of C, D, G, within a fifth rather than spanning a ninth, this is a Csus2 chord, where the second, D, replaces the third, E (C, D, G instead of C, E, G).

<text>California Institution for Women (CIW) is an American women&#x27;s state prison located in the city of Chino, San Bernardino County, California, east of Los Angeles, although the mailing address states &quot;Corona,&quot; which is in Riverside County, California.

==Facilities==
Although the official California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation documents give a &quot;Corona, California&quot; mailing address for CIW in Riverside County, the prison has been physically located in the city of Chino since 2003 following an annexation of land in previously-unincorporated San Bernardino County.

CIW has . Its facilities include Level I (&quot;Open dormitories without a secure perimeter&quot;) housing, Level II (&quot;Open dormitories with secure perimeter fences and armed coverage&quot;) housing, and Level III (&quot;Individual cells, fenced perimeters and armed coverage&quot;) housing. In addition, a Reception Center &quot;provides short term housing to process, classify and evaluate incoming inmates.&quot;

As of Fiscal Year 2008/2009, CIW had 977 staff and an annual budget of $75 million Institutional and $2.6 million Education. As of October 31, 2013, it had a design capacity of 1,398 but a total institution population of 2,155, for an occupancy rate of 154.1 percent.

As of April 30, 2020, CIW was incarcerating people at 111.1% of its design capacity, with 2,640 occupants.

CIW is located east of Downtown Los Angeles, and it takes about one hour to travel to the prison from Downtown LA.

==History==
The original California Institution for Women was dedicated in Tehachapi in 1932; however, after the 1952 Kern County earthquake, the female inmates were transferred to the just-opened CIW in Chino, and the Tehachapi facility was rebuilt as the male-only California Correctional Institution. CIW was originally called &quot;California Institution for Women at Corona,&quot; but &quot;Corona residents objected to the use of their city in the prison&#x27;s name and it was changed March 1, 1962, to Frontera, a feminine derivative of the word frontier, symbolic for a new beginning.&quot; It housed the location of the death row for women in the state. CIW was the only women&#x27;s prison in California until 1987, when the Northern California Women&#x27;s Facility opened.

In the early years of CIW, convicted women wore Sunday dresses while walking and working at the campus-like setting until the 1980s when three towers were added with officers atop armed with shotguns. Among other programs for inmates at CIW is &quot;Voices from Within&quot; in which inmates read books on tapes for &quot;high school students in remedial classes,&quot; &quot;college students with reading disabilities,&quot; and the blind.

In 2007, the state of California proposed building 45 new units for mentally ill inmates at CIW and 975 at the nearby California Institution for Men; local officials opposed such plans.

From 2006 to 2013 one woman at CIW committed suicide. From January 1, 2013 to July 2016 six women committed suicide at CIW, and there had been an increase in suicide attempts.

<text>The Liberty Head nickel, sometimes referred to as the V nickel because of its reverse (or tails) design, is an American five-cent piece. It was struck for circulation from 1883 until 1912, with at least five pieces being surreptitiously struck dated 1913. The obverse features a left-facing image of the goddess of Liberty.

The original copper–nickel five-cent piece, the Shield nickel, had longstanding production problems, and in the early 1880s, the United States Mint was looking to replace it. Mint Chief Engraver Charles Barber was instructed to prepare designs for proposed one-, three-, and five-cent pieces, which were to bear similar designs. Only the new five-cent piece was approved, and went into production in 1883. For almost thirty years large quantities of coin of this design were produced to meet commercial demand, especially as coin-operated machines became increasingly popular.

Beginning in 1911, the Mint began work to replace the Liberty head design, and a new design, which became known as the Buffalo nickel, went into production in February 1913. Although no 1913 Liberty head nickels were officially struck, five are known to exist. While it is uncertain how these pieces originated, they have come to be among the most expensive coins in the world, with one selling in 2018 for $4.5 million.

== Origin ==

Industrialist Joseph Wharton, who had interests in nickel mining and production, had been influential in the decision to use the metal in coinage in the mid-1860s, leading to the introduction of the Shield nickel in 1866. The Shield nickel presented difficulties through its life: the intricate design made the coins not strike well. Modification to the design failed to solve the technical problems, and the mint had considered replacing the design as early as 1867. Nevertheless, the Shield nickel remained in production. With production of copper–nickel five-cent pieces lagging in the late 1870s, and with production of copper-nickel three-cent pieces nearly moribund, Wharton sought to increase his sales of nickel to the United States Mint. Although copper-nickel coins were struck only in small numbers, the bronze cent represented a major portion of the Mint&#x27;s production, and Wharton began to lobby for the piece to be struck in copper-nickel.

In 1881, this lobbying led Mint Superintendent Archibald Loudon Snowden to order Mint Chief Engraver Charles Barber to produce uniform designs for a new cent, three-cent nickel, and five-cent piece. Snowden informed Barber that the proposed designs were to feature on the obverse (or heads side) a classic head of Liberty with the legend &quot;Liberty&quot; and the date. The reverse (or tails side) was to feature a wreath of wheat, cotton, and corn around a Roman numeral designating the denomination of the coin; thus the five-cent piece was to have the Roman numeral &quot;V&quot;. The proposal for the cent would decrease its size to and its weight to , and the modifications to the three-cent piece would increase its size to and its weight to . The nickel would retain its weight of , but its diameter would be increased to .
Barber duly produced the required designs. Fairly large numbers of pattern coins were struck. Barber&#x27;s design for the nickel showed a portrait similar to that eventually adopted for the obverse, with &quot;United States of America&quot; and the date. The reverse featured the required wreath surrounding the &quot;V&quot;, and no other lettering. A modified pattern design later that year added the words &quot;In God We Trust&quot; to the reverse. Snowden decided that the proposed cents and three-cent pieces would be too small for effective use, but Barber continued work on the nickel, with the size adjusted to . Barber reworked the design in 1882, adding &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; to the reverse. One variant that was struck as a pattern, but was not adopted, was a coin with five equally spaced notches in the rim of the coin. This &quot;Blind Man&#x27;s nickel&quot; was struck at the request of Congressman and former Union General William S. Rosecrans, who stated that many of his wartime colleagues had been blinded by combat or disease.

Late that year, Barber&#x27;s 1882 design was endorsed by Mint authorities, and 25 specimens were sent to Washington for routine approval by Treasury Secretary Charles J. Folger. To Snowden&#x27;s surprise, Folger rejected the design. The secretary, on review of the coinage statutes, had realized that the laws required &quot;United States of America&quot; to appear on the reverse, not the obverse. Folger had then consulted with President Chester Arthur, who confirmed Folger&#x27;s opinion. Snowden suggested that an exception should be made, but Folger refused, and Barber modified his design accordingly. The revised design was approved, and the coin was ready for striking in early 1883.

== Release ==

Striking of the new coins began on January 30, 1883, and the Mint placed the first pieces in circulation on February 1. Snowden, concerned about reports of speculation in 1883 proof Shield nickels, received permission on February 6 to continue striking proof Shield nickels for several months alongside the new pieces.

It had not been thought necessary to inscribe the word &quot;cents&quot; on the nickel; the silver and copper-nickel three-cent pieces had circulated for years with only a Roman numeral to indicate the denomination. Enterprising fraudsters soon realized that the new nickel was close in diameter to that of the five-dollar gold piece, and if the new coin was gold-plated, it might be passed for five dollars. They soon did so, and had success in passing the coin. Some coins were given a reeded edge by the fraudsters, to make them appear more like the gold coins. A widespread tale is that one of the perpetrators of this fraud was a man named Josh Tatum, who would go into a store, select an item costing five cents or less, and offer the gold-plated piece in payment—and many clerks gave him $4.95 in change. According to the tale, the law had no recourse against Tatum, as he had tendered the value of his purchase and had merely accepted the change as a gift. By some accounts, Tatum could not have misrepresented the value of the coin as he was a deaf-mute.

The plating of the nickels caused consternation at the Mint, and brought production of Liberty Head nickels to a sudden stop. Barber was told to modify his design, which he did, moving other design elements to accommodate the word &quot;cents&quot; at the bottom of the reverse design. The revised nickel was issued on June 26, 1883, the date on which production of the Shield nickel was finally stopped. The public responded by hoarding the &quot;centless&quot; nickels, egged on by reports that the Treasury Department intended to recall those nickels, and that they would become rare.

== Production ==

After heavy mintages of the nickel in 1883 and 1884, production was much lower in 1885 and 1886. This was due to an economic downturn which lowered demand for the coins. The 1886 production was also depressed by the Treasury&#x27;s decision to reissue large numbers of worn minor coins. It was not until September 1886 that the Mint resumed full production of the coin. By 1887, however, the Mint was overwhelmed by orders, melting down large quantities of older copper-nickel coins to meet the demand. Despite these efforts, the Mint was forced to return many orders unfilled. Demand remained strong until 1894, when the Mint temporarily suspended production as it had accumulated a surplus during the Panic of 1893.

The Coinage Act of 1890 retired a number of obsolete denominations, including the three-cent piece. Another Act of Congress, also enacted on September 26, 1890 required that coinage designs not be changed until they had been in use 25 years, unless Congress authorized the change. However, the second act indicated that nothing in the law was to prevent the redesign of the current five-cent piece and silver dollar &quot;as soon as practicable after the passage of this act&quot;. In 1896, pattern nickels were struck for the first time since 1885, when experimental, holed coins had been tested. The 1896 pieces, which featured a simple shield with arrows crossed behind it, were struck in response to a resolution of the House of Representatives asking the Secretary of the Treasury to report to it on the advantages and disadvantages of using various alloys in coinage. Pattern nickels would not be struck again until 1909.

The turn of the century saw unprecedented demand for nickels, due to a booming economy and the use of nickels in coin-operated machines. In 1900, Mint Director George E. Roberts called on Congress to grant the Mint a larger appropriation to purchase base metals, allowing for greater production of nickels and cents. The same year, the design was modified slightly, lengthening some of the leaves on the reverse. This change occurred with the introduction of a new hub, from which coining dies were made. Demand for the coins remained heavy; in March 1911, &quot;Mehl&#x27;s Numismatic Monthly&quot; reported that the Mint was working twenty-four hours a day to produce cents and nickels, and even so was failing to satisfy demand.

Mint directors, in their annual reports, had long called for the authority to strike cents and nickels at all mints; by law they could then only be struck at Philadelphia. On April 24, 1906, this restriction was removed, although the first base metal coins, cents in both cases, were not struck at San Francisco until 1908 and Denver until 1911. In 1912, nickels were coined for the first time at each of the two branch mints. The 1912-S (for San Francisco) nickel was not struck until Christmas Eve, and was only struck for four business days. A 1912-S nickel, one of the first forty coined, was used by former San Francisco Mayor James D. Phelan to pay the first fare on the city&#x27;s first streetcar on December 28, 1912. Excluding the 1913 nickel, the 1912-S, with only 238,000 struck, is by far the rarest in the series.

== Replacement ==

In 1909, consideration was given to the replacement of the Liberty Head nickel by a new design. In an attempt to modernize the coinage, the cent and the gold pieces had been redesigned. Prominent artists from outside the Mint had been contracted to provide the designs of the new coins, much to Barber&#x27;s disgruntlement. Mint Director Frank A. Leach was an admirer of Barber&#x27;s work, and had him prepare designs to be struck as patterns. Barber, at Leach&#x27;s request, prepared a design showing Washington&#x27;s head, and newspapers reported that new coins might be issued by the end of 1909. In July 1909, however, Leach resigned, putting an end to the matter for the time being.

On May 4, 1911, Eames MacVeagh, son of Treasury Secretary Franklin MacVeagh wrote to his father:
A little matter that seems to have been overlooked by all of you is the opportunity to beautify the design of the nickel or five cent piece during your administration, and it seems to me that it would be a permanent souvenir of a most attractive sort. As possibly you are aware, it is the only coin the design of which you can change during your administration, as I believe there is a law to the effect that the designs must not be changed oftener than every twenty-five years. I should think also it might be the coin of which the greatest numbers are in circulation.
Soon afterwards, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Abram Andrew announced that the Mint would be soliciting new designs. Well-known sculptor James Earle Fraser approached Treasury officials, who were impressed by his proposals. Mint Director Roberts initially asked Fraser for a design featuring a bust of Lincoln, which he produced, mainly to please Roberts, but Fraser also developed a design featuring a Native American on the obverse, with an American bison on the reverse. This design was given preliminary approval by MacVeagh on January 13, 1912, and would come to be known as the Buffalo nickel. In late June, Fraser completed the model of the final design. The specifications of the new nickel were provided to the Hobbs Manufacturing Company, a maker of vending machines, which, following a meeting with Fraser in early November, opined that the new coins would likely jam its machines. At the company&#x27;s request, Fraser prepared a revised version, but Secretary MacVeagh rejected it on the grounds that the changes compromised the design, which he greatly admired.

On December 13, 1912, Roberts warned the Mint staff to take no action in preparation for the 1913 five-cent coinage until the new designs were ready. He ended production of the Liberty Head nickel at the Philadelphia Mint the same day. A minor change was made to the Buffalo design in an attempt to satisfy the Hobbs Company, which promptly provided a lengthy list of changes it wanted made to the coin. On February 15, 1913, with less than three weeks until he would have to leave office on the advent of the Wilson administration, McVeagh wrote to Roberts, noting that no other vending or slot machine maker had complained about the new design. The Secretary concluded that everything possible had been done to satisfy the Hobbs Company, and ordered the new nickel put into production.

== 1913 ==

The first information that a 1913 Liberty head nickel might have been struck came in December 1919, when coin dealer Samuel W. Brown placed advertisements in numismatic publications, offering to buy any such nickels. In August 1920, Brown displayed one such coin at the annual American Numismatic Association (ANA) convention. Brown related that a master die had been prepared for the 1913 Liberty head nickels, and a few pieces had been run off to test the die. As it turned out, Brown possessed five coins, which he eventually sold. After spending fifteen years in the hands of the eccentric Col. E.H.R. Green, the famous Fort Worth, Texas, area collector, the coins were finally dispersed in 1943. Since then, the coins have had several owners each. Today, three are on public display, one at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC and two reside at the ANA&#x27;s Money Museum in Colorado Springs, while two are owned privately. One price recorded for a 1913 Liberty Head nickel was in January 2010, when one sold for $3,737,500 in an auction. Recent sales of a 1913 Liberty Head nickel were in April 2013 for more than $3.1 million and for $4.5 million at auction in August 2018.

It is uncertain how the 1913 nickels came to be made. The Mint&#x27;s records show no production of 1913 Liberty head nickels, and none were authorized to be made. Dies were prepared in advance and sent to California for a 1913-S Liberty Head nickel coinage, but upon Roberts&#x27;s instruction to stop coinage, they were ordered returned to Philadelphia. They were received by December 23, and were almost certainly destroyed routinely by early January. Brown had been an employee at the Philadelphia Mint (although this was not known until 1963) and many theories focus suspicion on him.

<text>Azar Nafisi (; born 1948) is an Iranian-American writer and professor of English literature. Born in Tehran, Iran, she has resided in the United States since 1997 and became a U.S. citizen in 2008.

Nafisi has held several academic leadership roles, including director of the Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) Dialogue Project and Cultural Conversations, a Georgetown Walsh School of Foreign Service, Centennial Fellow, and a fellow at Oxford University.

She is the niece of a famous Iranian scholar, fiction writer and poet Saeed Nafisi. Azar Nafisi is best known for her 2003 book &quot;Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books&quot;, which remained on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for 117 weeks, and has won several literary awards, including the 2004 Non-fiction Book of the Year Award from Booksense.

In addition to &quot;Reading Lolita in Tehran,&quot; Nafisi has authored, &quot;Things I&#x27;ve Been Silent About: Memories of a Prodigal Daughter,&quot; &quot;The Republic of Imagination: America in Three Books&quot; and &quot;That Other World: Nabokov and the Puzzle of Exile.&quot; Her newest book, &quot;Read Dangerously: The Subversive Power of Literature in Troubled Times&quot; was published March 8, 2022.

==Early life and education==
Nafisi was born in Tehran, Iran. She is the daughter of Nezhat and Ahmad Nafisi, the former mayor of Tehran from 1961 to 1963. He was the youngest man ever appointed to the post at that time. In 1963, her mother was a member of the first group of women elected to the National Consultative Assembly.

Nafisi was raised in Tehran, but when she was thirteen, she moved to Lancaster, England, to finish her studies. She then moved to Switzerland before returning to Iran briefly in 1963. She completed her degree in English and American literature and received her Ph.D. from the University of Oklahoma.

Nafisi returned to Iran in 1979, after the Iranian Revolution and taught English literature at the University of Tehran. In 1981, she was expelled from the university for refusing to wear the mandatory Islamic veil. Years later, during a period of liberalization, she began teaching at Allameh Tabataba&#x27;I University. In 1995, Nafisi sought to resign from her position, but the university did not accept her resignation. After repeatedly not going to work, they eventually expelled her, but refused her ability to resign.

From 1995 to 1997, Nafisi invited several female students to attend regular meetings at her house every Thursday morning. They discussed their place as women within post-revolutionary Iranian society. They studied literary works, including some considered &quot;controversial&quot; by the regime, such as &quot;Lolita&quot; alongside other works such as &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;. She also taught novels by F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry James and Jane Austen, attempting to understand and interpret them from a modern Iranian perspective.

After staying in Iran for 18 years after the Revolution, Nafisi returned to the United States of America on June 24, 1997, and continues to reside there today.

==Literary and academic work==

In addition to her books, Nafisi has written for &quot;The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Guardian, and The Wall Street Journal&quot;. Her cover story, &quot;The Veiled Threat: The Iranian Revolution&#x27;s Woman Problem,&quot; published in The New Republic (February 22, 1999) has been reprinted in several languages. She also wrote the new introduction to the Modern Library Classics edition of Tolstoy&#x27;s Hadji Murad, as well as the introduction to Iraj Pezeshkzad&#x27;s My Uncle Napoleon, published by Modern Library (April 2006). She has published a children&#x27;s book (with illustrator Sophie Benini Pietromarchi) BiBi and the Green Voice (translated into Italian, as BiBi e la voce verde, and Hebrew).

She served as director of the Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) Dialogue Project and Cultural Conversations, a Georgetown Walsh School of Foreign Service Centennial Fellow, and a fellow at Oxford University.

In 2003, Nafisi published &quot; Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books&quot;. The book describes her experiences as a secular woman living and working in the Islamic Republic of Iran right after the Revolution. In 2008, Nafisi authored a memoir about her mother titled &quot;Things I&#x27;ve Been Silent About: Memories of a Prodigal Daughter.&quot;

On October 21, 2014, Nafisi authored &quot;The Republic of Imagination: America in Three Books&quot;, in which using &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, &quot;Babbitt&quot;, and &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot;, as well as the writings of James Baldwin and many others, Nafisi responds to an Iranian reader that questioned whether Americans care about or need their literature.

In 2019, the English translation of &quot;That Other World: Nabokov and the Puzzle of Exile&quot; was published by Yale University Press. Nafisi&#x27;s forthcoming book, &quot;Read Dangerously: The Subversive Power of Literature in Troubled Times&quot; will be published on March 8, 2022.

Nafisi has lectured and written extensively in English and Persian on the political implications of literature and culture, the human rights of Iranian women and girls and the important role they play in the change process for pluralism and open society in Iran. She has been consulted on issues related to Iran and human rights by policy makers and various human rights organizations in the U.S. and elsewhere. She is also involved in promoting not just literacy but of reading books with universal literary value. In 2011, she was awarded the Cristóbal Gabarrón Foundation International Thought and Humanities Award for her &quot;determined and courageous defense of human values in Iran and her efforts to create awareness through literature about the situation women face in Islamic society&quot;.

She also received the 2015 Benjamin Franklin Creativity Laureate Award. She has been awarded honorary doctorates from Susquehanna University (2019), Pomona College (2015), Mt. Holyoke College (2012), Seton Hill University (2010), Goucher College (2009), Bard College (2007), Rochester University (2005) and Nazareth College. In 2018, she was named a Georgetown University/Walsh School of Foreign Service, Centennial Fellow.

== Critical response ==
Nafisi&#x27;s books have received critical acclaim from authors, publishing houses, and newspapers.

Reading Lolita in Tehran (2003)

Michiko Kakutani described &quot;Reading Lolita in Tehran&quot; in &quot;The New York Times&quot; Book Review as &quot;resonant and deeply affecting… an eloquent brief on the transformative powers of fiction-- on the refuge from ideology that art can offer to those living under tyranny, and art&#x27;s affirmative and subversive faith in the voice of the individual&quot;. Stephen Lyons for USA Today called the book &quot;an inspiring account of an insatiable desire for intellectual freedom in Iran&quot;, and Publishers Weekly said of &quot;Reading Lolita,&quot; &quot;This book transcends categorization as memoir, literary criticism or social history, though it is superb as all three.&quot; Kirkus Reviews called &quot;Reading Lolita,&quot; &quot;A spirited tribute both to the classics of world literature and to resistance against oppression.&quot;

Margaret Atwood, author of &quot;The Handmaids Tale,&quot; reviewed Nafisi&#x27;s book for the Literary Review of Canada, stating that, &quot;&quot;Reading Lolita in Tehran&quot; is both a fascinating account of how she arrived at this belief and a stunning dismissal of it. All readers should read it. As for writers, it reminds us, with great eloquence, that our words may travel farther and say more than we could ever guess when we wrote them.&quot;

Things I&#x27;ve Been Silent About (2008)

After reviewing &quot;Things I&#x27;ve Been Silent About, The New York Times&quot; Book Review called Nafisi &quot;a gifted storyteller with a mastery of Western literature, Nafisi knows how to use the language both to settle scores and to seduce&quot;. Kirkus Reviews called the book &quot;an immensely rewarding and beautifully written act of courage, by turns amusing, tender and obsessively dogged&quot;.

The Republic of Imagination: America in Three Books (2014)

Iranian French novelist Marjane Satrapi&#x27;s review of &quot;The Republic of Imagination&quot;, says, &quot;We are all citizens of Azar Nafisi&#x27;s Republic of Imagination. Without imagination, there are no dreams; without dreams, there is no art; without art, there is nothing. Her words are essential.&quot;

Kirkus Reviews said the book is &quot;a passionate argument for returning to key American novels to foster creativity and engagement… Literature writes Nafisi, is deliciously subversive because it fires the imagination and challenges the status quo… Her literary exegesis lightly moves through her experience as a student, teacher, friend, and new citizen. Touching on myriad examples, from L. Frank Baum to James Baldwin, her work is poignant and informative.&quot;

Jane Smiley wrote in The Washington Post that Nafisi &quot;finds the essence of the American experience, filtered through narratives not about exceptionalism or fabulous success, but alienation, solitude and landscape&quot;. Laura Miller of Salon wrote that &quot;No one writes better or more stirringly about the way books shape a reader&#x27;s identity, and about the way that talking books with good friends becomes integral to how we understand the books, our friends and ourselves.

She appeared on &quot;Late Night with Seth Meyers&quot;, and PBS NewsHour to promote the book.

That Other World: Nabokov and the Puzzle of Exile (2019)

American literary critic Gary Saul Morson described &quot;That Other World&quot; as &quot;somewhere between a first-person encounter with literature and a critical study; this book reminds us of how meaningful literature can be&quot;.

 Read Dangerously: The Subversive Power of Literature in Troubled Times (2022)

Publishers Weekly authored a starred review of Nafisi&#x27;s forthcoming &quot;Read Dangerously,&quot; calling it a &quot;stunning look at the power of reading&quot; and characterizing Nafisi&#x27;s prose as &quot;razor-sharp&quot;. &quot;The Progressive Magazine&quot; printed that &quot;Read Dangerously&quot; lives up to its audacious title, demonstrating the subversive and transformative power of literature. It should start many a book-based conversation among the living and the dead.&quot;

===Political influences===

In a 2003 article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Brian Whitaker criticized Nafisi for working for the public relations firm Benador Associates which he argued promoted the neo-conservative ideas of &quot;creative destruction&quot; and &quot;total war&quot;.

In 2004, Christopher Hitchens wrote that Nafisi had dedicated &quot;Reading Lolita in Tehran&quot; to Paul Wolfowitz, the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense under George W. Bush and a principal architect of the Bush Doctrine. Hitchens had stated that Nafisi was good friends with Wolfowitz and several other key figures in the Bush administration. Nafisi later responded to Hitchen&#x27;s comments, neither confirming nor denying the claim.

In a critical article in the academic journal &quot;Comparative American Studies&quot;, titled &quot;Reading Azar Nafisi in Tehran&quot;, University of Tehran literature professor Seyed Mohammad Marandi states that &quot;Nafisi constantly confirms what orientalist representations have regularly claimed&quot;. He also claimed that she &quot;has produced gross misrepresentations of Iranian society and Islam and that she uses quotes and references which are inaccurate, misleading, or even wholly invented.&quot;

John Carlos Rowe, Professor of the Humanities at the University of Southern California, states that: &quot;Azar Nafisi&#x27;s Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books (2003) is an excellent example of how neo-liberal rhetoric is now being deployed by neo-conservatives and the importance they have placed on cultural issues.&quot; He also states that Nafisi is &quot;amenable.. to serving as a non-Western representative of a renewed defense of Western civilization and its liberal promise, regardless of its historical failures to realize those ends.&quot;

===Hamid Dabashi: criticisms and counter-criticisms===
In 2006, Columbia University professor Hamid Dabashi, in an essay published in the Cairo-based, English-language paper &quot;Al-Ahram&quot; (Dabashi&#x27;s criticism of Nafisi became a cover story for an edition of the Chronicle of Higher Education) compared &quot;Reading Lolita in Tehran&quot; to &quot;the most pestiferous colonial projects of the British in India&quot;, and asserted that Nafisi functions as a &quot;native informer and colonial agent&quot; whose writing has cleared the way for an upcoming exercise of military intervention on the Middle East. He also labeled Nafisi as a &quot;comprador intellectual,&quot; a comparison to the &quot;treasonous&quot; Chinese employees of mainland British firms, who sold out their country for commercial gain and imperial grace. In an interview Z magazine, he classed Nafisi with the U.S. soldier convicted of mistreating prisoners at Abu Ghraib: &quot;To me, there is no difference between Lynndie England and Azar Nafisi.&quot; Finally, Dabashi stated that the book&#x27;s cover image (which appears to be two veiled teenage women reading Lolita in Tehran) is in fact, in a reference to the September 11 attacks, &quot;Orientalised pedophilia&quot; designed to appeal to &quot;the most deranged Oriental fantasies of a nation already petrified out of its wits by a ferocious war waged against the phantasmagoric Arab/Muslim male potency that has just castrated the two totem poles of U.S. empire in New York.&quot;

Critics like Dabashi have accused Nafisi of having close relations with neoconservatives. Nafisi responded to Dabashi&#x27;s criticism by stating that she is not, as Dabashi claims, a neoconservative, that she opposed the Iraq war, and that she is more interested in literature than politics. In an interview, Nafisi stated that she has never argued for an attack on Iran and that democracy, when it comes, should come from the Iranian people (and not from US military or political intervention). She added that while she is willing to engage in &quot;serious argument...The polarized debate isn&#x27;t worth my time.&quot; She said she did not respond directly to Dabashi because &quot;You don&#x27;t want to debase yourself and start calling names.&quot; In the acknowledgements she makes in &quot;Reading Lolita in Tehran&quot;, Nafisi writes of Princeton University historian Bernard Lewis as &quot;one who opened the door&quot;. Nafisi, who opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, rejects such accusations as &quot;guilt by association&quot;, noting that she has both &quot;radical friends&quot; and &quot;conservative friends.&quot; Ali Banuazizi, the co-director of Boston College’s Middle East studies program, the co-director of Boston College&#x27;s Middle East studies program, stated that Dabashi&#x27;s article was very &quot;intemperate&quot; and that it was &quot;not worth the attention&quot; it had received. Christopher Shea of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; argued that while Dabashi spent &quot;several thousand words... eviscerating the book,&quot; his main point was not about the specific text but the book&#x27;s black-and-white portrayal of Iran.

Writing in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Marty Peretz sharply criticized Dabashi, and rhetorically asked, &quot;Over what kind of faculty does [Columbia University president] Lee Bollinger preside?&quot; In an article posted on Slate.com, author Gideon Lewis-Kraus described Dabashi&#x27;s article as &quot;a less-than-coherent pastiche of stock anti-war sentiment, strategic misreading, and childish calumny&quot; and that Dabashi &quot;insists on seeing [the book] as political perfidy&quot; which allows him &quot;to preserve his fantasy that criticizing Nafisi makes him a usefully engaged intellectual.&quot; Robert Fulford sharply criticized Dabashi&#x27;s comments in the &quot;National Post&quot;, arguing that &quot;Dabashi&#x27;s frame of reference veers from Joseph Stalin to Edward Said. Like a Stalinist, he tries to convert culture into politics, the first step toward totalitarianism. Like the late Edward Said, he brands every thought he dislikes as an example of imperialism, expressing the West&#x27;s desire for hegemony over the oppressed (even when oil-rich) nations of the Third World.&quot; Fulford added that &quot;While imitating the attitudes of Said, Dabashi deploys painful clichés.&quot; Firoozeh Papan-Matin, the Director of Persian and Iranian Studies at the University of Washington in Seattle, stated that Dabashi&#x27;s accusation that Nafisi is promoting a &quot;&#x27;kaffeeklatsch&#x27; worldview... callously ignores the extreme social and political conditions that forced Nafisi underground.&quot; Papan Matin also argued that &quot;Dabashi&#x27;s attack is that whether Nafisi is a collaborator with the [United States]&quot; was not relevant to the legitimate questions outlined in her book.

<doc id="428291" wikidata="Q60928" url="?curid=428291" title="Vladimir II Monomakh">
<text>Vladimir II Monomakh (; Christian name: &quot;Vasily&quot;; 26 May 1053 – 19 May 1125) was Grand Prince of Kiev from 1113 to 1125. He is considered a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church and is celebrated on May 6.

== Family background ==
His father was Vsevolod Yaroslavich, born as the fifth son of grand prince of Kiev Yaroslav the Wise (); he himself would go on to reign as grand prince Vsevolod I of Kiev from 1078 to 1093. In 1046, to seal an armistice in the Rus&#x27;–Byzantine War, Vsevolod Yaroslavich, then a junior member of the princely Rurikids of Kievan Rus&#x27;, contracted a diplomatic marriage with a relative of the reigning Byzantine emperor Constantine IX Monomachos (), from whom Vladimir (born in 1053) likely inherited his sobriquet, &quot;Monomakh&quot;.

The name and ancestry of his mother are unknown; Byzantine sources do not mention the marriage at all, and the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; only says that his father Vsevolod had him by a &quot;tsesaritsa Gr&#x27;kyna&quot;, meaning &quot;Greek princess&quot;. The fact that Vladimir Vsevolodovich was later given the nickname &quot;Monomakh&quot; provides the only significant clue, namely that his mother was likely a member of the Byzantine Monomachos family, the same as the then-reigning emperor Constantine IX. Contemporary Byzantine naming-practice allowed the adoption of a maternal surname if convention regarded the mother&#x27;s family as of a more exalted origin than the father&#x27;s.

According to a later fictitious story written in the early 16th century, &quot;The Tale of the Princes of Vladimir&quot;, Vladimir Vsevolodovich defeated Constantine Monomachos in a war, and Constantine sued for peace by offering him many gifts, after which Vladimir Vsevolodovich became known as Vladimir Monomakh; however, this is not possible, because Constantine died in 1055, when Vladimir was only one and a half years old. He is never called &quot;Monomakh&quot; in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, and the first time his name ever appears in primary sources as &quot;Volodimer&#x27; Monomakhŭ&quot; is not until his eulogy &quot;sub anno&quot; 1126 [sic] in the &quot;Kievan Chronicle&quot;. It has also been found on his seal.

== Reign ==
In his famous &quot;Instruction&quot; (also known as &quot;The Testament&quot;) to his own children, Monomakh mentions that he conducted 83 military campaigns and 19 times made peace with the Polovtsi. At first he waged war against the steppe jointly with his cousin Oleg, but after Vladimir was sent by his father to rule Chernigov and Oleg made peace with the Polovtsi to retake that city from him, they parted company. Since that time, Vladimir and Oleg were bitter enemies who would often engage in internecine wars. The enmity continued among their children and more distant posterity.

In 1068 he allied with the Cuman chief Bilge-Tegin.
From 1094, his chief patrimony was the southern town of Pereiaslav, although he also controlled Rostov, Suzdal, and other northern provinces (see Principality of Pereyaslavl). In these lands he founded several towns, notably his namesake, Vladimir, the future capital of Russia. In order to unite the princes of Rus&#x27; in their struggle against the Great Steppe, Vladimir initiated three princely congresses, the most important being held at Lyubech in 1097 and Dolobsk in 1103.

In 1107 he defeated Boniak, a Cuman khan who led an invasion on Kievan Rus&#x27;.

In 1111, Vladimir, alongside Sviatopolk II, led an army at the , where they defeated a Cuman army on the river. The site of this battle is probably at modern-day Izium.

When Sviatopolk II died in 1113, the Kievan populace revolted and summoned Vladimir to the capital. The same year he entered Kiev to the great delight of the crowd and reigned there until his death in 1125. As may be seen from his &quot;Instruction&quot;, he promulgated a number of reforms in order to allay the social tensions in the capital. These years saw the last flowering of Ancient Rus, which was torn apart 10 years after his death.

Vladimir Monomakh was buried at Saint Sophia Cathedral. Succeeding generations often referred to his reign as the golden age of that city. Numerous legends are connected with Monomakh&#x27;s name, including the transfer from Constantinople to Rus of such precious relics as the Theotokos of Vladimir and the Vladimir/Muscovite crown called Monomakh&#x27;s Cap.

== Marriages and children ==

Vladimir married three times. The 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus reported that, in what would have been his first marriage, Vladimir wed Gytha of Wessex, daughter of Harold, King of England, who had fallen at Hastings in 1066 and of Edith Swannesha. This marriage is not reported by any contemporary sources, and none of the Russian sources report the name or parentage of Vladimir&#x27;s first wife. The &quot;Testament of Vladimir Monomakh&quot; records the death of the mother of Vladimir&#x27;s son Yuri on 7 May 1107, but it does not mention her name. Most historians agree it was more likely Yuri&#x27;s mother was Gytha, based upon Yuri&#x27;s acceptable marriage age in 1108.

They had at least the following children:

* Mstislav I of Kiev (1 June 1076 – 14 April 1132)
* Izyaslav Vladimirovich, Prince of Kursk (c. 1077 – 6 September 1096)
* Svyatoslav Vladimirovich, Prince of Smolensk and Pereyaslav (c. 1080 – 16 March 1114)
* Yaropolk II of Kiev (1082 – 18 February 1139)
* Viacheslav I of Kiev (1083 – 2 February 1154)

A daughter has been attributed to either the first or the second wife:
* Marina Vladimirovna (d. 1146). Married Leon Diogenes, a pretender to the throne of the Byzantine Empire who claimed to be a son of Romanos IV and who rose to the rank of khan of the Cumans in Ossetia.

Vladimir&#x27;s second wife, Euphemia, is considered to have been a Byzantine noblewoman. This marriage produced at least five children:
* Roman, Prince of Volhynia (d. 6 January 1119)
* Euphemia of Kiev (d. 4 April 1139). Married Coloman of Hungary.
* Agafia (Agatha). Married Vsevolod Davidovich, Prince of Grodno. According to older historians her husband was a son of David Igorevich, Prince of Volhynia (d. 1113), but this theory was rejected.
* Yuri (George), later known as Yuri Dolgoruki (d. 15 May 1157).
* Andrew, Prince of Volhynia (11 July 1102 – 1141).

Vladimir&#x27;s third marriage is thought to have been to a daughter of Aepa Ocenevich, Khan of the Cumans. Her paternal grandfather was Osen. Her people belonged to the Kipchaks, a confederation of pastoralists and warriors of Turkic origin.

However the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; identifies Aepa as father-in-law to Yuri Dolgoruki, with Vladimir negotiating the marriage in name of his son. Whether father and son married sisters or the identity of intended groom was misidentified remains unclear.

<doc id="428299" wikidata="Q708228" url="?curid=428299" title="Korean court music">
<text>Korean court music () comprises three main musical genres: &quot;aak&quot;, an imported form of Chinese ritual music; a pure Korean form called &quot;hyangak&quot;; and a combination of Chinese and Korean styles called &quot;dangak&quot;.

Korean court music and its historical origins can be traced back to the Three Kingdoms Period (57 BCE–668), the Unified Silla (668–935), Goryeo (918–1392) and Joseon dynasties (1392–1910). It was partly modelled on the court music of China, known as &quot;yayue&quot;. Korean court music also shows similarities with the court music of Japan, known as &quot;gagaku&quot; and of Vietnam, known as &quot;nhã nhạc&quot;, which also are also derivative of yayue.

Performances in the form of banquet dances typically accompany the court music, in which musical institutions play a role in teaching and training musicians and performers on the forms of traditional Korean dance. The instruments used in Korean court music vary depending on the specific genre but do show various overlaps between the three different types. Traditional court music also continues to show significant cultural influence on contemporary society in South Korea, through government, national music associations, and forms of popular culture such as South Korean music.

== History ==

Korean court music and its origins have been traced as early as the Unified Silla period (668–935); however, the three categories commonly began their spread across Korea during the Goryeo dynasty (918–1392), mainly due to Chinese influence.

=== &quot;Aak&quot; ===
The genre of &quot;aak&quot; refers to Korean court ritual music originating from China. &quot;Aak&quot; means &#x27;elegant music&#x27;. It is similar to &quot;dangak&quot; as both genres are of Chinese origin. The types of Chinese court music within the &quot;aak&quot; genre included Korean royal processional music, referred to as &quot;daechwita&quot;; &quot;munmyo jeryeak&quot;, Confucian shrine music; j&quot;ongmyo jeryeak&quot;, also known as royal ancestral shrine music; &quot;hyangak&quot; and &quot;gagok&quot;, translated to the &#x27;classical song cycle&#x27;; and &quot;dangak&quot;. As these forms of court music eventually began to fade away, &quot;aak&quot; was decidedly later used only for Confucian shrine music. As time went on, it eventually also included forms of music played for aristocrats, nobility and court officials.

The first historical noting of &quot;aak&quot; was during the Unified Silla period of 668–935; however, this is only due to the existence of &quot;aak&quot; instruments, and no music or performance coexisted at this time. &quot;Aak&quot; music and performance to began to spread across Korea for the first time during the Goryeo dynasty of 918–1392. &quot;Aak&quot; was first introduced to Korea during 1116, when the Chinese emperor of the Sung dynasty first presented the Korean court with &quot;aak&quot; instruments and court dance instructions; Emperor Hyejong of Goryeo provided Emperor Huizong of Song with a gift of 428 music instruments, 572 costumes, and ritual dance objects imported from China. This created the growth in popularity for &quot;aak&quot; within Korea; however, the genre saw an eventual decline afterwards. The Yi dynasty during 1392–1910 then allowed for a completely finalised version of the &quot;aak&quot; system to rise across Korea, as the year 1430 saw the revival of the genre through a more modern reconstruction of traditional &quot;aak&quot; melodies.

Instruments used within the genre are all of Chinese origin and are mostly used for the purpose of playing &quot;aak&quot; music, as opposed to being used for other genres of traditional court music.

There are only two current surviving melodies of &quot;aak&quot;, both of which are played very slowly, and last around four minutes. Each piece contains 32 notes, and each note is played for at least four seconds, with the instruments rising in pitch at the end of every note.

=== &quot;Hyangak&quot; ===
The genre of &quot;hyangak&quot; refers to court banquet music originating from Korea. &quot;Hyangak&quot; means &quot;&#x27;indigenous/native music, folk music&quot;&#x27;. During the Unified Silla period of Korea, the genre widely included native Korean court music, along with music imported from China prior to the years of the Tang dynasty. As &quot;hyangak&quot; includes original Korean music, it is commonly acknowledged as the most prominent genre of court music, and its wider musical range has also led to the preference of Koreans to perform it more frequently than other genres.

Its historical origins trace as far back to the Three Kingdoms period (220 AD – 280 AD). However, the earliest recordings of &quot;hyangak&quot; were during the 14th century, which was seen through the very first few creations of instrumental &quot;hyangak&quot; compositions. The 15th century started to see the creation of 24 &quot;hyangak&quot; compositions in total, and by the year 1434, there were around 80 compositions of hyangak music. During the Unified Silla period of Korea, &quot;hyangak&quot; was only played alongside &quot;dangak&quot;. Within the Goryeo dynasty, &quot;hyangak&quot; was referred to instead as &quot;sokak&quot;. Some of the genre&#x27;s musical instruments were derived from the Unified Silla period, including the &quot;samhyeon&quot; and &quot;samjook&quot;; however, &quot;hyangak&quot; was also played with foreign instruments such as the &quot;janggu&quot;, &quot;haegeum&quot; and the daegeum. The Joseon dynasty finally saw less of a clear distinction between &quot;hyangak&quot; and &quot;dangak&quot; through each genre&#x27;s direct influence on one another.

&quot;Dangak&quot; music is typically accompanied with folk dance performances referred to as &quot;hyangak chongjae&quot;.

One of the most important &quot;hyangak&quot; pieces is referred to as &quot;yeomillak&quot;. Other &quot;hyangak&quot; pieces include &quot;pollyeong&quot;, &quot;haeryeong&quot;, and b&quot;oheoja&quot;, all of which are performed in Chinese style.

=== &quot;Dangak&quot; ===
The genre of &quot;dangak&quot; refers to Chinese court banquet music in Korea. &quot;Dangak&quot; means &#x27;Tang music&#x27;, as the genre was initially used for Chinese court music which originated during the Tang dynasty. However, during the Goryeo dynasty, &quot;dangak&quot; was then used to refer to music imported from China both during and after the Tang dynasty. The genre was then split into &quot;ubangak&quot;; music of the right, and &quot;hyangak&quot;; music of the left.

&quot;Dangak&quot; originated within the Goryeo dynasty of 918–1392, in which &quot;dangak&quot; music and performances first began to spread across Korea. During the Yi dynasty of 1392–1910, the genre further developed through an increase in the creation of compositions for instrumental &quot;dangak&quot; music. &quot;Dangak&quot; continued to spread in Korea throughout the Goryeo (918–1392) and Joseon (1392–1910) dynasties.

&quot;Dangak&quot; music is typically accompanied with dance performances referred to as &quot;dangak chongjae&quot;.

One of the most popular pieces of &quot;dangak&quot; is commonly known as &quot;Nakyangchun&quot;, and is one of the two only current surviving pieces of &quot;dangak&quot; music, of which the other is &quot;Boheoja&quot; (translated to &quot;Pacing the Void&quot;).

== Performance ==
Korean court performances included traditional banquet dances alongside musical accompaniments. Female court entertainers were called &quot;kinyo&quot; and &quot;kisaeng&quot;. Male musicians were separated into four different classes: &quot;aksaeng&quot;, &quot;aggong&quot;, &quot;kwanhyon maengin&quot;, and &quot;royal processional musicians&quot;.

=== &quot;Aak&quot; ===
The first recorded performance of &quot;aak&quot; was at the Royal Ancestral Shrine during the Goryeo period of Korea.

Modern &quot;aak&quot; musical performances are known as &quot;munmyo jeryeak&quot; or &quot;jongmyo jeryeak&quot;, which contain two instrumental ensembles; the &quot;terrace&quot; group who play on the porch of the main shrine, and the &quot;courtyard&quot; group, who play near the main entrance of the main shrine.

This is typically accompanied by modern dance performances known as &quot;munmyo ilmu&quot;, which contains two types of dances; a &quot;civil&quot; dance, or a &quot;military&quot; dance, in which 64 dancers perform in an 8 × 8 formation.

Audiences are welcome to watch &quot;aak&quot; performances at the National Gugak Center in Seoul. Performances are also played at certain ceremonies such as the Seokjeon Daeje, held at the Munmyo shrine of the Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul. This festival is held during the spring and autumn seasons every year as a festival with the purpose to honour Confucius.

=== &quot;Hyangak chongjae&quot; ===
&quot;Hyangak chongjae&quot; described banquet dances which were performed alongside &quot;hyangak&quot; instrumental music. The dance required musicians and entertainers to enter the stage alongside the beat of &quot;hyangak&quot; music. The entertainers would then pause their dancing, to sing Korean poems. Finally, performers would exit the stage after bowing, which concluded the performance.

=== &quot;Dangak chongjae&quot; ===
&quot;Dangak chongjae&quot; described banquet dances which were performed alongside &quot;dangak&quot; instrumental music. The dance required musicians and entertainers to enter the stage behind pole bearers. The dancers would then read Chinese poems. Finally, performers would exit the stage, concluding the performance. Musicians and performers of &quot;dangak chongjae&quot; were normally drawn from the lower classes of Korea.

=== Court music institutions ===

Court music institutions also play a heavy role in assisting musicians with their learning processes of Korean court performances.

The first modern theatre built by the royal court was referred to as &quot;Hyuomnyulsa&quot;. The theatre has since changed its name to &quot;Wongaksa&quot;.

Currently, court music institutions include the National Center for Korean Traditional Performing Arts and the Chongdong Theater, which foster the preservation and appreciation of traditional court music within contemporary society.

== Instruments used ==

The instruments used in Korean court music vary depending on the specific genre; however, they also show various overlaps between the three categories of &quot;aak&quot;, &quot;hyangak&quot; and &quot;dangak&quot;.

=== &quot;Aak&quot; ===
Instruments used for &quot;aak&quot; may include the &quot;tungga&quot;, &quot;honga&quot;, &quot;pyeonjong&quot;, &quot;pyongyong&quot;, &quot;kum&quot;, &quot;sul&quot;, &quot;saenghwang&quot;, and &quot;pak&quot;, along with the eight necessary types of materials (&quot;metal&quot;, &quot;stone&quot;, &quot;silk&quot;, &quot;wood&quot;, &quot;bamboo&quot;, &quot;leather&quot;, &quot;clay and gourd&quot;).

=== &quot;Hyangak&quot; ===
Instruments used for &quot;hyangak&quot; may include the &quot;geomungo&quot;, &quot;konghu&quot;, &quot;gayageum&quot;, &quot;koto&quot;, &quot;pipa&quot;, &quot;taegum chunggum&quot;, &quot;sogeum&quot;, &quot;pak&quot;, &quot;taego&quot;, &quot;piri&quot;, &quot;janggu&quot;, &quot;haegeum&quot;, &quot;junggeum&quot;, &quot;daegeum&quot;, &quot;tang-p’iri&quot;, &quot;tang-jok&quot;, and &quot;tang-pip’a.&quot;

=== &quot;Dangak&quot; ===
Instruments used for &quot;dangak&quot; may include the &quot;tango&quot;, &quot;yogo&quot;, &quot;janggu&quot;, &quot;pak&quot;, &quot;shō&quot;, &quot;hwengjok, tungso&quot;, &quot;piri&quot;, &quot;saeng&quot;, &quot;tang-pip’a&quot;, &quot;chang&quot;, &quot;konghu&quot;, &quot;panghyang&quot;, &quot;taego&quot;, &quot;tang-p’iri&quot;, &quot;ajaeng&quot;, &quot;kyobanggo&quot;, &quot;wolgum&quot;, &quot;haegeum&quot;, &quot;taepyeongso&quot;, &quot;pyeonjong&quot;, &quot;pyonyong&quot;, &quot;daegeum&quot;, and &quot;cholgo&quot;.

== Cultural influence on contemporary society ==
The word for music in the Korean language is e&quot;umak&quot;, which very closely resembles the word for the traditional Korean court music form &quot;aak&quot;. In North Korea, traditional court music and performances have mostly died out as a result of the nation&#x27;s strong political ideologies. However, traces of its legacy have continued to live on within South Korean culture and as a result, continues to cultivate cultural influence on contemporary South Korean society.

=== National institutions and associations ===

The South Korean government advocates for the preservation of traditional court music within contemporary society. National music institutions such as the National Center for Korean Traditional Performing Arts and the Chongdong Theater, along with associations such as the Korean Music Association and the Korean Vocal Music Association, also contribute to fostering the sustained appreciation of Korean court music within current and future generations.

=== Contemporary South Korean music ===
Popular Korean musicians have also drawn upon Korean court music as sources of inspiration for their songs, such as BTS&#x27; Agust D. Agust D&#x27;s &quot;Daechwita&quot; is heavily inspired by and directly named after and samples the Korean royal processional music genre.

<doc id="428308" wikidata="Q1142359" url="?curid=428308" title="UIC classification of locomotive axle arrangements">
<text>The UIC classification of locomotive axle arrangements, sometimes known as the German classification or German system, describes the wheel arrangement of locomotives, multiple units and trams. It is used in much of the world, notable exceptions being the United Kingdom and North America.

The classification system is managed by the International Union of Railways (UIC).

==Structure==
The UIC uses the following structure:
; Upper-case letters : Indicate driving axles, starting at A for a single axle. B thus indicates two and C indicates three consecutive pairs of driving wheels.
; Lower-case &quot;o&quot; : Related to driving axles (minimum 2, &quot;B&quot;), indicates they are individually driven by separate traction motors.
; Numbers : Consecutive non-driving axles, starting with 1 for a single axle.
; Prime symbol &quot; ′ &quot; : The axles indicated by a single letter or number are mounted on a bogie.
; Parentheses : Groups letters and numbers describing the same bogie. For example, (A1A) indicates a three-axle bogie with the outer two axles driven. When parentheses are used around a single letter or number, a prime is not needed to indicate a bogie. Articulated locomotives can be indicated by bracketing the front power unit — for example, the Union Pacific Big Boy, 4-8-8-4 in Whyte notation, is (2′D)D2′ in UIC notation.
; Plus sign &quot;+&quot; : The locomotive or multiple unit consists of permanently coupled but mechanically separate traction units.

Garratt locomotives are indicated by bracketing or placing plus signs between all individual units.
; Other suffixes:
:* h: superheated steam ()
:* n: saturated steam ()
:* v: compound ()
:* Turb: turbine
:* number: number of cylinders
:* t: tank locomotive
:* tr: tram (urban) locomotive
:* E: Engerth-type locomotive
:* G: freight (). Also used to indicate shunting locomotives
:* P: passenger ()
:* S: fast passenger ()

The most common wheel arrangements in modern locomotives are Bo′Bo′ and Co′Co′.

==Examples==
The following examples are based on the UIC classification: 
; (A1A)(A1A)
: Two bogies or wheel assemblies under the unit. Each bogie has one powered axle, one idle axle, and one more powered axle. All powered axles are individually driven by traction motors.
; BB
: Four powered axles all mounted in the locomotive&#x27;s frame, driven in pairs, i.e. each pair of axles is connected by driving rods or gears. Compare with &quot;D&quot; below. (Whyte notation: 0-4-4-0)
; B′B′
: Two bogies or wheel assemblies under the unit. Each bogie has two powered axles, connected by driving rods or gears. 
; Bo′(A1A)
: Two bogies or wheel assemblies. The &quot;Bo′&quot; bogie is under one end of the unit, and has two powered axles, while the &quot;(A1A)&quot; bogie under the other end of the unit has one powered axle, one idle axle, and another powered axle. All powered axles are individually driven by traction motors.
; Bo′Bo′
: Two bogies or wheel assemblies under the unit. Each bogie has two powered axles individually driven by traction motors. Three-quarters of all modern locomotives (and power cars of self-propelled trains) are configured in either this or the &quot;B′B′&quot; arrangement. 
; Bo′Bo′Bo′
: Three bogies or wheel assemblies under the unit. Each bogie has two powered axles individually driven by traction motors.
; C
: Three powered axles, connected by driving rods or gears, all mounted in the locomotive&#x27;s frame (Whyte notation: 0-6-0).
; C′C′
: Two bogies or wheel assemblies under the unit. Each bogie has three powered axles, connected by driving rods or gears. One such example of this type is Southern Pacific 9010. 
; Co′Co′
: Two bogies or wheel assemblies under the unit. Each bogie has three powered axles individually driven by traction motors.
; (2Co)()
: A locomotive with two bogies, each with two leading axles and three individually powered axles. A number of Japanese electric locomotives used this wheel arrangement, including the JNR Class EF58, and the PRR GG1.
; D
: Four powered axles, connected by driving rods or gears, all mounted in the locomotive&#x27;s frame (Whyte notation: 0-8-0).
; 1′D1′
: One leading idle (non-driven) axle mounted in a bogie, four driven axles mounted in the frame and connected by driving rods or gears, followed by one trailing idle axle mounted in a bogie (Whyte notation: 2-8-2).
; E
: Five powered axles, mounted in the locomotive&#x27;s frame (Whyte notation: 0-10-0).
; 2′D1′h3S
: Two front leading axles grouped in a bogie, four driving axles, one trailing axle in a bogie, simple steam expansion, superheated steam, three-cylinders, for fast trains (Whyte notation: 4-8-2).
; 1′E1′h2Gt
: One front leading axle in a bogie, five driving axles, one rear trailing axle, simple steam expansion, superheated steam, two-cylinder machine, for freight trains, tank engine (Whyte notation: 2-10-2T).
; 1′Dn4vP
: One front leading axle in a bogie, four driving axles, saturated steam, four-cylinder machine, compound (double steam expansion), for passenger trains (Whyte notation: 2-8-0).
; D′Dh4vtG
: No front leading axle, four driving axles in a bogie, four more driven axles mounted in the frame (Mallet locomotive), superheated steam, four-cylinder machine, compound (double steam expansion), tank locomotive, for freight trains (Whyte notation: 0-8-8-0T).

<text>The Slánský trial (officially English: &quot;Trial of the Leadership of the Anti-State Conspiracy Centre Headed by Rudolf Slánský&quot;) was a 1952 antisemitic show trial against fourteen members of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ), including many high-ranking officials. Several charges, including high treason, were announced against the group on the grounds of allegedly conspiring against the Czechoslovak Republic. General Secretary of the KSČ Rudolf Slánský was the alleged leader of the conspirators.

All fourteen defendants were found guilty of crimes that they did not commit. Eleven of them were sentenced to death and executed; the remaining three received life sentences.

== Background ==

After World War II, Czechoslovakia initially enjoyed limited democracy. This changed with the February 1948 coup, carried out by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia without the direct assistance of the Soviet Union. According to literature scholar Peter Steiner, the one-party Communist state had to find or conjure up imaginary enemies from within to justify its continuing existence; this was the motive for show trials. After the 1948 Tito–Stalin split, a sequence of high-level political trials against alleged Titoist and Western imperialist elements were held in Bulgaria, Hungary, and Albania, but these trials were not overtly antisemitic. The anti-cosmopolitan campaign, a thinly disguised antisemitic campaign in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, began in the fall of 1948. In the year before Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953 another Soviet antisemitic campaign, the Doctors&#x27; Plot, began to unfold. During this period, the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee&#x27;s leadership was murdered and antisemitic purges spread to other countries in the Soviet&#x27;s Eastern Bloc. 

==Arrests and interrogation==

The trial was orchestrated (and the subsequent terror staged in Czechoslovakia) on the order of Moscow leadership by Soviet advisors, who were invited by Rudolf Slánský and Klement Gottwald, with the help of the Czechoslovak State Security personnel following the László Rajk trial in Budapest in September 1949. 
Klement Gottwald, president of Czechoslovakia and leader of the Communist Party, feared being purged and decided to sacrifice Slánský, a longtime collaborator and personal friend, who was the second-in-command of the party. The others were picked to convey a clear threat to different groups in the state bureaucracy. A couple of them (Šváb, Reicin) were brutal sadists, conveniently added for a more realistic show.

Those put on trial confessed to all crimes (under duress or after torture) and were sentenced to punishment. Slánský attempted suicide while in prison. The people of Czechoslovakia signed petitions asking for death for the alleged traitors. Apropos of the conspiracy theories of &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, prosecutors claimed that a &quot;Zionist-Imperialist&quot; summit had taken place in Washington DC in April 1947 with President Harry S. Truman, undersecretary of state Dean Acheson, former treasury secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr., David Ben-Gurion and Moshe Sharret in attendance. The prosecution charged that defendants were acting in accordance with a so-called &quot;Morgenthau Plan&quot; (not to be confused with the contemporaneous Morgenthau Plan for German heavy industry) to commit espionage and sabotage against Czechoslovakia for the US in exchange for American support for Israel. Czechoslovakia was seen as especially pro-Zionist due to their armament support for Israel during the Palestine War. In actuality, most of the defendants were known to be ardent anti-Zionists.

==Trial==
The trial of Rudolf Slánský and 13 other high-ranking Communists (11 of whom, the lead prosecutor said, were &quot;of Jewish origin&quot;) began on 20 November 1952. They were charged with being Titoists and Zionists. Those tried with Slánský were Bedřich Geminder, Otto Šling, André Simone, Karel Šváb, Otto Fischl, Rudolf Margolius, Vladimir Clementis, Ludvik Frejka, Bedřich Reicin, Artur London, , Josef Frank and . 

The trial lasted eight days. Many of the defendants admitted their guilt and requested death. On the last day of the trial, Rudolf Slánský, General Secretary of the KSČ, and other leading party members were pronounced guilty. Eleven, including Slánský, were hanged at Pankrác Prison in Prague on 3 December, and three (Artur London, Eugen Löbl and Vavro Hajdů) were sentenced to life imprisonment. The state prosecutor at the trial in Prague was Josef Urválek.

==Reaction ==
===Domestic===
A Czech worker sent to attend the trial reported that the defendants did not display any emotion. He wondered why they were not afraid for their lives. On 14 December 1952, a few days after the execution, Zdeněk Nejedlý, Minister of Education, denied rumors that the confessions had been obtained with torture or drugs. Instead, the defendants admitted to their crimes because of the overwhelming evidence against them and because of their shame and guilt. Many Czechoslovak citizens were in favor of harsh measures against the supposed traitors. Czech poet called for &quot;a dog&#x27;s death for [such] dogs&quot; ().

After the deaths of both Stalin and Gottwald in March 1953, the harshness of the persecutions slowly decreased, and the victims of the trial quietly received amnesty one by one, including those who had survived the Prague Trial. Later, the official historiography of the Communist Party was rather quiet on the trial, vaguely putting blame on errors that happened as a result of a &quot;cult of personality.&quot; Many other political trials followed on, sending many innocent victims to jail and hard labour in the Jáchymov uranium mines and labour camps.

The full transcript of the trial was released in 1953; Steiner described it as &quot;an utterly indigestible book, crammed with so many names, dates, and particulars that I had a hard time finishing it and remembering all the details.&quot;

===International===
Raphael Lemkin considered the trial an example of judicial murder and, along with the fabrication of evidence to claim Jewish doctors were plotting to kill Soviet officials (the spuriously alleged Doctors&#x27; Plot), a potential precursor to the genocide of Jews in the Soviet bloc. He asked the United Nations to launch an investigation into the alleged genocide of Jews in the Soviet bloc. In &quot;Commentary&quot;, Peter Meyer wrote that &quot;the Prague trial with its lurid tale of a &#x27;Zionist conspiracy&#x27; recalled the Czarist-invented and Nazi-popularized legend of the Elders of Zion&quot;.

David Ben-Gurion, speaking hypothetically in the wake of both the Doctors Plot trial and the Slánský trial, considered suppressing Maki, the Israeli communist party. In internal discussions, Ben-Gurion suggested he would favor this even to the point of throwing communist activists in concentration camps, though he spoke of this as being a potential response rather than an imminent necessity. &quot;If there is a need to build camps, we will do it. If there is a need to shoot, we will shoot. We have already been through times when there was a need to shoot people – people who were even closer to us.&quot; This last comment referred to an earlier moment in Israel&#x27;s recent history where he first warned and then approved firing on the right-wing paramilitary group Irgun. A majority of the cabinet opposed Ben-Gurion&#x27;s view, including Golda Meir and Pinhas Lavon. Lavon observed in the discussion that an attempt to detain members of Maki would result in greater, not lesser influence for the party. The cabinet, by a vote of 13–7, voted for an alternate proposal which permitted &quot;the employment of all means at the government&#x27;s disposal, in the framework of the existing law and of laws yet to be passed, to deny Maki the opportunity to take public action, without declaring it an organization that exists outside the law.&quot;

Defense of the American Jewish Soviet spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg surged in November and December 1952 and was organized by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—confirmation of which occurred with the publication of KGB documents obtained by Alexander Vassiliev in 2011. Proponents of clemency argued that the Rosenbergs were actually &quot;innocent Jewish peace activists&quot;. According to American historian Ronald Radosh, the Soviet Union&#x27;s goal was &quot;to deflect the world&#x27;s attention from the sordid execution of the innocent [Slánský trial defendants] in Prague&quot;.

==Modern interpretations==
The Israeli-American scholar Martin Wein observed that although Slánský was not guilty of the charges he was forced to admit, he was guilty of mass murder as a high-level functionary in the Communist government. In Wein&#x27;s opinion, because all of the defendants (except Simone and Margolius) occupied high positions in the Czechoslovak Communist regime, they had command responsibility for crimes committed by it. Wein further commented that the three reprieved defendants all came from an upper-class background, while all of the middle-class and working-class defendants were executed. He hypothesizes that this was because if an upper-class person was a traitor to the Communist Party, he was not a traitor to his class. According to Stephen Norwood, the Slánský trial was the &quot;clearest illustration yet of state-sponsored antisemitism in the Soviet bloc&quot; and &quot;a secularized version of the Spanish Inquisition&#x27;s racialized antisemitism&quot;, because it insisted on that Jewish origin was an indelible defect which would pass to all descendents (similar to the guilt of Jewish deicide).

Artur London, one of the survivors of the trial, eventually moved to France, where he published his memoirs in 1968. His book &quot;L&#x27;Aveu&quot; (&quot;The Confession&quot;), is a major source about the trial. &quot;L&#x27;Aveu&quot; (1970), a film based on London&#x27;s book, was directed by Costa-Gavras and starred Yves Montand and Simone Signoret.

The Slánský trial is also a key element of the book &quot;Under a Cruel Star&quot;. A memoir by Heda Margolius Kovály, the book follows the life of a Jewish woman, starting with her escape from a concentration camp during World War II, up until her departure from Czechoslovakia after the Warsaw Pact countries invasion of 1968. Kovály&#x27;s husband, Rudolf Margolius, a fellow Holocaust survivor, was one of the 11 men executed during the Slánský trial. More encompassing information is available in the more recent book &quot;Hitler, Stalin and I&quot;, an interview of Heda Margolius Kovály by Helena Třeštíková published in 2018. Martin Wein was critical of the positive image of Margolius in Kovály&#x27;s book and in other media (Igor Lukes described him as &quot;a clean man in a filthy time&quot;), which he felt downplayed Margolius&#x27; complicity with the Stalinist regime. David Hertl on the other hand emphasised the mystery of Rudolf Margolius inclusion in the trial in his recent Czech interview program, &quot;The Youngest Hanged in the Trial with the Slánský Group was Rudolf Margolius. But Why Him, is a Mystery to Historians.&quot; (&quot;Nejmladším oběšeným v procesu se skupinou Slánského byl Rudolf Margolius. Proč zrovna on, je ale pro historiky záhadou.&quot;) broadcast on Czech Radio Plus, December 1, 2022.

The Slánský trial is the subject of the documentary &quot;A Trial in Prague&quot;, directed by Zuzana Justman (2000, 83 min).

On 22 March 2018, it was announced that insolvency administrators discovered 8.5 hours of original footage from the trial at a factory near Prague. The film was heavily damaged, and restoration is expected to take several years, to be paid for by the Ministry of Culture.

==Film documentary==
&quot;Le Procès – Prague 1952&quot;, an 1hr 10min French documentary film by Ruth Zylberman for ARTE France &amp; Pernel Media had the world premiere at FIPADOC International Documentary Festival, Biarritz, France on January 18, 2022. The new documentary made from the Slánský trial film and audio archives found by chance in 2018 in a warehouse in the suburb of Prague served as a starting point for the film. The director tells the trial through the descendants of three of the condemned: the daughter and grandson of Rudolf Slánský, the son and granddaughter of Rudolf Margolius, both executed after the trial, and the three children of Artur London, sentenced to life imprisonment.

<doc id="428316" wikidata="Q1343698" url="?curid=428316" title="Enric Bernat">
<text>Enrique Bernat Fontlladonosa; 20 October 1923 – 27 December 2003) was a Spanish scientist and businessman, and the founder of the Chupa Chups lollipop company.

==Life==
Bernat was the child of a confectioner Catalan family in the third generation and started his working life in his parents&#x27; cake shop. In the early 1950s he went to north Spain to revive an apple jam factory. As he introduced later his idea of lollipops to the investors, they left. Bernat took over the company in 1958 and renamed it Chupa Chups. In 1969 Salvador Dalí was paid a fortune to do the logo.

In the 1980s, Bernat failed a take-over of the insurance company Iberia de Seguros to fund a new Catalan investment bank. Despite the loss, he gained ownership of Gaudi&#x27;s Casa Batlló. In 1991, he passed formal control of Chupa Chups to his son Xavier. The Smint subsidiary brand/company was founded in 1994.

Together with his wife Núria Serra he had three sons and two daughters, all surviving him.

Bernat died aged 80 at home in Barcelona on 27 December 2003, from an illness. A hundred people attended his funeral in Les Corts.

In 2006, Chupa Chups was sold to the Italian-Dutch company Perfetti van Melle by Bernat&#x27;s sons.

<text>The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (in case citations, 1st Cir.) is a federal court with appellate jurisdiction over the district courts in the following districts:

* District of Maine
* District of Massachusetts
* District of New Hampshire
* District of Puerto Rico
* District of Rhode Island

The court is based at the John Joseph Moakley Federal Courthouse in Boston, Massachusetts. Most sittings are held in Boston, where the court usually sits for one week most months of the year; in one of July or August, it takes a summer break and does not sit. The First Circuit also sits for one week each March and November at the Jose V. Toledo Federal Building and United States Courthouse in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, and occasionally sits at other locations within the circuit.

With six active judges and four active senior judges, the First Circuit has the fewest judges of any of the thirteen United States courts of appeals. It covers most of New England, as well as Puerto Rico. Since retiring from the United States Supreme Court, Associate Justice David Souter has occasionally sat on the First Circuit by designation.

<text>The University of North Dakota (UND) is a public research university in Grand Forks, North Dakota. It was established by the Dakota Territorial Assembly in 1883, six years before the establishment of the state of North Dakota.

The university has the only schools of law and medicine in the state of North Dakota. The John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences was the first in the country to offer a degree in unmanned aircraft systems operation. Several national research institutions are on the university&#x27;s campus including the Energy and Environmental Research Center, the School of Medicine and Health Sciences, and the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral universities – very high research activity&quot;.

==History==
===Founding===
UND was founded in 1883, six years before North Dakota became a state. UND was founded with a liberal arts foundation and expanded to include scientific research. Grand Forks native George H. Walsh submitted the bill to the Territorial Legislature of Dakota Territory that called for the new state of North Dakota&#x27;s university to be in Grand Forks. The first classes were held on September 8, 1884. The first building at UND, Old Main, housed all classrooms, offices, dorm rooms, and a library. In the 1880s, UND consisted of only a few acres of property, surrounded by farms and fields, nearly two miles west of the city of Grand Forks. Students living off campus had to take a train or a horse and carriage bus, dubbed the &quot;Black Maria&quot;, from downtown to the campus.

===20th century===

As the university grew, more buildings were constructed on campus and a trolley system was built to connect the growing university to downtown Grand Forks. However, there were several major interruptions in the life of the university. In 1918, UND was the country&#x27;s hardest-hit single institution by the flu epidemic that killed 1,400 people in North Dakota alone. Later that year, classes were suspended so the campus could become an army base for soldiers during World War I. During the Great Depression, UND provided free housing to students willing to do manual labor on campus. &quot;Camp Depression,&quot; as it was called, consisted of railroad cabooses that each housed eight male students. &quot;Camp Depression&quot; students did not get regular meals from the cafeteria and had to be satisfied with free leftovers. However, Grand Forks citizens often opened their homes and kitchen tables to many of these young men.

After World War II, enrollment quickly grew to more than 3,000. A large amount of housing and several academic buildings had to be built on campus. The 1950s saw the rise of the Fighting Sioux hockey tradition. In the 1960s and 1970s, many student protests occurred at UND. The largest was in May 1970 when over 1,500 students protested the Kent State shootings. In 1975, enrollment swelled to a record 8,500. The 1970s also saw the establishment of the John D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences at UND. During the 1980s and 1990s the university continued to grow. However, the devastating 1997 Red River flood inundated numerous buildings on campus and forced the cancellation of the remainder of the school year.

===21st century===
The start of the 21st century was marked by the opening of two major venues for UND athletics. The Ralph Engelstad Arena, home of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey, and the Alerus Center, home of UND football, both opened in 2001. The Betty Engelstad Sioux Center opened in August 2004, and serves as home to UND volleyball and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball.

Millions of dollars worth of construction and renovation projects have dotted the campus landscape. As part of a plan to improve student facilities on campus, UND constructed a Wellness Center, a parking garage, new Memorial Union, renovated library, renovated Gershman Center for graduate students, and an apartment-style housing complex. Other construction projects around campus have included a new LEED Platinum-certified alumni center, a renovated and expanded College of Education and Human Development, and an expanded Energy and Environmental Research Center. In 2016, a $124-million Medicine and Health Services building was built on the north end of campus.

In 2015, UND&#x27;s economic impact on the state and region was estimated to be more than $1.4 billion a year according to the NDUS Systemwide Economic Study by the School of Economics at North Dakota State University. It was the fourth-largest employer in the state of North Dakota, after the Air Force.

In August 2021, UND became the first participant in the United States Space Force&#x27;s University Partnership program.

==Campus==

The University of North Dakota&#x27;s main campus sits in the middle of Grand Forks on University Avenue. The campus is made up of 240 buildings (6.4 million square feet) on . The campus stretches roughly one and half miles from east to west and is divided by the meandering English Coulee. The western edge is bordered by Interstate 29, the eastern edge is bordered with University Park, the Grand Forks railyards sit on the south side, and the north side is marked by U.S. Highway 2 which is called Gateway Drive in Grand Forks.

===Central campus and eastern campus===

The central campus area, the oldest part of UND, has many historic buildings. This area is home to most academic buildings on campus. At the heart of campus sits the Chester Fritz Library, the largest library in North Dakota. The tower of the library is a familiar landmark on University Avenue. Behind the library is the park-like setting of the central campus mall. The mall includes several statues and is a popular place for students to study. The mall is lined with historic buildings including Merrifield Hall, Twamley Hall, Babcock Hall, Montgomery Hall, and the old Carnegie Library. Old Main Memorial Plaza and the eternal flame of the Old Main Memorial Sphere mark the location of Old Main, the first building on campus. Other buildings in the central part of campus include the School of Law, the North Dakota Museum of Art, Memorial Union, Gamble Hall, and Burtness Theatre.

==Athletics==
North Dakota&#x27;s 17 athletic teams compete in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I. Teams compete in the Summit League, except men&#x27;s hockey, which is in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference, and the football team, which is in the Missouri Valley Football Conference (within the FCS subdivision). The men&#x27;s ice hockey team has won eight national championships, has been runner-up five times and play in the Ralph Engelstad Arena.

The football team won the Division II national championship in 2001 and was the runner-up in 2003, and play at the Alerus Center. The basketball and volleyball teams play in the Betty Engelstad Sioux Center. The women&#x27;s basketball team has won three national championships in 1997, 1998, and 1999 and was runner-up in 2001.

The colors of UND athletics are green and white, which were adopted in the 1920s. The university&#x27;s official school colors are green and pink, representative of North Dakota&#x27;s state flower, the Wild Prairie Rose; however, this combination is rarely employed outside of official or ceremonial applications. From 1904 until 1930, UND&#x27;s athletic teams bore the name of the Flickertails. Afterward they were the Fighting Sioux, but were without a nickname and mascot from 2012 to 2015, in compliance with the NCAA&#x27;s policy against the use of Native American nicknames. On November 18, 2015, it was announced the new nickname would be &quot;Fighting Hawks&quot;, effective immediately.

A notable UND athletic alumnus is National Basketball Association (NBA) coach and former player Phil Jackson, widely considered one of the greatest coaches in NBA history.

<text>The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (in case citations, 2d Cir.) is one of the thirteen United States Courts of Appeals. Its territory covers the states of Connecticut, New York, and Vermont, and it has appellate jurisdiction over the U.S. district courts in the following federal judicial districts:

* District of Connecticut
* Eastern District of New York
* Northern District of New York
* Southern District of New York
* Western District of New York
* District of Vermont

The Second Circuit has its clerk&#x27;s office and courtrooms at the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse at 40 Foley Square in Lower Manhattan. 

Because the Second Circuit includes New York City, it has long been one of the largest and most influential American federal appellate courts, especially in matters of contract law, securities law, and antitrust law. In the 20th century, it came to be considered one of the two most prestigious federal appellate courts, along with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Several notable judges have served on the Second Circuit, including three later named Associate Justices of the United States Supreme Court: John Marshall Harlan II, Thurgood Marshall, and Sonia Sotomayor. Judge Learned Hand served on the court from 1924 to 1961, as did his cousin, Augustus Noble Hand, from 1927 until 1953. Judge Henry Friendly served from 1959 to 1986.

<text>The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (in case citations, 3d Cir.) is a federal court with appellate jurisdiction over the district courts for the following districts:
* District of Delaware
* District of New Jersey
* Eastern District of Pennsylvania
* Middle District of Pennsylvania
* Western District of Pennsylvania

This circuit also hears appeals from the District Court of the Virgin Islands, which is an Article IV territorial court and not a district court under Article III of the Constitution.

The court is composed of 14 active judges and is based at the James A. Byrne United States Courthouse in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The court also conducts sittings in other venues, including the United States Virgin Islands. It is one of 13 United States courts of appeals. Due to the court&#x27;s appellate jurisdiction over Delaware, where more than half of publicly-traded companies in the United States incorporate, the court handles a significant number of influential commercial cases in the United States.

== Practice in the 4th Circuit ==
From 2000 to 2008, the Court had the highest rate of non-publication (92%) on the Federal Circuit.

The Chief Justice is always assigned to the Fourth Circuit as the circuit justice, due to Richmond&#x27;s close proximity to Washington, D.C.

The Fourth Circuit is considered an extremely collegial court. By tradition, the judges of the Fourth Circuit come down from the bench following each oral argument to greet the lawyers.

<doc id="428326" wikidata="Q250456" url="?curid=428326" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit">
<text>The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (in case citations, 5th Cir.) is one of the 13 United States courts of appeals. It has appellate jurisdiction over the U.S. district courts in the following federal judicial districts:

* Eastern District of Louisiana
* Middle District of Louisiana
* Western District of Louisiana
* Northern District of Mississippi
* Southern District of Mississippi
* Eastern District of Texas
* Northern District of Texas
* Southern District of Texas
* Western District of Texas

The Fifth Circuit has 17 active judgeships, and is headquartered at the John Minor Wisdom United States Court of Appeals Building in New Orleans, Louisiana, with the clerk&#x27;s office located at the F. Edward Hebert Federal Building in New Orleans. 

Originally, the Fifth Circuit also included the federal district courts in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. In 1981, the district courts for those states were transferred to the newly created U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

== History of the court ==

This court was created by the Evarts Act on June 16, 1891, which moved the circuit judges and appellate jurisdiction from the Circuit Courts of the Fifth Circuit to this court. At the time of its creation, the Fifth Circuit covered Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas.

On June 25, 1948, the Panama Canal Zone was added to the Fifth Circuit by 62 Stat. 870. The Fifth Circuit gained appellate jurisdiction over the United States District Court for the Canal Zone.

On October 1, 1981, under , the Fifth Circuit was split: Alabama, Georgia, and Florida were moved to the new Eleventh Circuit.

On March 31, 1982, the Fifth Circuit lost jurisdiction over the Panama Canal Zone, which was transferred to Panamanian control.

=== The Fifth Circuit Four ===
Starting in the late 1950s, judges Elbert Parr Tuttle (chief judge 1960–67), John Minor Wisdom, John R. Brown (chief judge 1967–79), and Richard T. Rives (chief judge 1959–60) became known as the &quot;Fifth Circuit Four&quot;, or simply &quot;The Four&quot;, for decisions crucial in advancing the civil rights of African Americans. In this, they were usually opposed by their fellow Fifth Circuit Judge, Benjamin F. Cameron of Mississippi, until his death in 1964.

=== Hurricane Katrina ===
Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans on August 29, 2005, devastating the city and slightly damaging the John Minor Wisdom Courthouse. All deadlines concerning filings were extended. The court temporarily relocated its administrative operations to Houston, and returned to normal operations in New Orleans in March 2007.

=== 2020s ===
During his first administration, President Donald Trump appointed six judges to the court, with many observers thereafter regarding it as the most conservative court of appeals. The Fifth Circuit&#x27;s reversal rate at the US Supreme Court from the beginning of the 2020 term through the end of the 2022 term was 74%, making it the 7th most frequently reversed circuit court; the average rate of reversals was 68%. Some members of the Supreme Court, including Chief Justice John Roberts, have indicated concern with how the Fifth Circuit approaches cases. Several court observers have interpreted the court as being exceptionally conservative in its rulings.

<text>The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (in case citations, 6th Cir.) is a federal court with appellate jurisdiction over the district courts in the following districts:

* Eastern District of Kentucky
* Western District of Kentucky
* Eastern District of Michigan
* Western District of Michigan
* Northern District of Ohio
* Southern District of Ohio
* Eastern District of Tennessee

* Western District of Tennessee

The court is composed of sixteen judges and is based at the Potter Stewart U.S. Courthouse in Cincinnati, Ohio. It is one of 13 United States courts of appeals.

The United States federal courts were divided into six circuits in 1801, but a circuit court of appeals was not established until the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1891.

William Howard Taft, the only person ever to serve as both President and Chief Justice of the United States, once served on the Sixth Circuit. Four other judges of the Sixth Circuit have been elevated to serve on the Supreme Court, the last being Potter Stewart in 1958.

<doc id="428330" wikidata="Q1189936" url="?curid=428330" title="Inline function">
<text>In the C and C++ programming languages, an inline function is one qualified with the keyword codice_1; this serves two purposes:
# It serves as a compiler directive that suggests (but does not require) that the compiler substitute the body of the function inline by performing inline expansion, i.e. by inserting the function code at the address of each function call, thereby saving the overhead of a function call. In this respect it is analogous to the codice_2 storage class specifier, which similarly provides an optimization hint.
# The second purpose of codice_1 is to change linkage behavior; the details of this are complicated. This is necessary due to the C/C++ separate compilation + linkage model, specifically because the definition (body) of the function must be duplicated in all translation units where it is used, to allow inlining during &quot;compiling&quot;, which, if the function has external linkage, causes a collision during &quot;linking&quot; (it violates uniqueness of external symbols). C and C++ (and dialects such as GNU C and Visual C++) resolve this in different ways.

== Example ==
An codice_1 function can be written in C or C++ like this:

inline void swap(int *m, int *n)
 int tmp = *m;
 *m = *n;
 *n = tmp;

Then, a statement such as the following:

swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);

may be translated into (if the compiler decides to do the inlining, which typically requires optimization to be enabled):

int tmp = x;
x = y;
y = tmp;

When implementing a sorting algorithm doing lots of swaps, this can increase the execution speed.

== Standard support ==
C++ and C99, but not its predecessors K&amp;R C and C89, have support for codice_1 functions, though with different semantics. In both cases, codice_1 does not force inlining; the compiler is free to choose not to inline the function at all, or only in some cases. Different compilers vary in how complex a function they can manage to inline. Mainstream C++ compilers like Microsoft Visual C++ and GCC support an option that lets the compilers automatically inline any suitable function, even those not marked as codice_1 functions. However, simply omitting the codice_1 keyword to let the compiler make all inlining decisions is not possible, since the linker will then complain about duplicate definitions in different translation units. This is because codice_1 not only gives the compiler a hint that the function should be inlined, it also has an effect on whether the compiler will generate a callable out-of-line copy of the function (see storage classes of inline functions).

== Nonstandard extensions ==
GNU C, as part of the dialect gnu89 that it offers, has support for codice_1 as an extension to C89. However, the semantics differ from both those of C++ and C99. armcc in C90 mode also offers codice_1 as a non-standard extension, with semantics different from gnu89 and C99.

Some implementations provide a means by which to force the compiler to inline a function, usually by means of implementation-specific declaration specifiers:
* Microsoft Visual C++: codice_12
* gcc or clang: codice_13 or codice_14, the latter of which is useful to avoid a conflict with a user-defined macro named codice_15.
Indiscriminate uses of that can result in larger code (bloated executable file), minimal or no performance gain, and in some cases even a loss in performance. Moreover, the compiler cannot inline the function in all circumstances, even when inlining is forced; in this case both gcc and Visual C++ generate warnings.

Forcing inlining is useful if:
* codice_1 is not respected by the compiler (ignored by compiler cost/benefit analyzer)
* inlining results is necessary for boosting performance

For code portability, the following preprocessor directives may be used:

#ifdef _MSC_VER
 #define forceinline __forceinline
#elif defined(__GNUC__)
 #define forceinline inline __attribute__((__always_inline__))
#elif defined(__CLANG__)
 #if __has_attribute(__always_inline__)
 #define forceinline inline __attribute__((__always_inline__))
 #else
 #define forceinline inline
 #endif
#else
 #define forceinline inline
#endif
== Storage classes of inline functions ==
codice_17 has the same effects in all C dialects and C++. It will emit a locally visible (out-of-line copy of the) function if required.

Regardless of the storage class, the compiler can ignore the codice_1 qualifier and generate a function call in all C dialects and C++.

The effect of the storage class codice_19 when applied or not applied to codice_1 functions differs between the C dialects and C++.

=== C99 ===
In C99, a function defined codice_1 will never, and a function defined codice_22 will always, emit an externally visible function. Unlike in C++, there is no way to ask for an externally visible function shared among translation units to be emitted only if required.

If codice_1 declarations are mixed with codice_22 declarations or with unqualified declarations (ie., without codice_1 qualifier or storage class), the translation unit must contain a definition (no matter whether unqualified, codice_1, or codice_22) and an externally visible function will be emitted for it.

A function defined codice_1 requires exactly one function with that name somewhere else in the program which is either defined codice_22 or without qualifier. If more than one such definition is provided in the whole program, the linker will complain about duplicate symbols. If, however, it is lacking, the linker does not necessarily complain, because, if all uses could be inlined, it is not needed. But it may complain, since the compiler can always ignore the codice_1 qualifier and generate calls to the function instead, as typically happens if the code is compiled without optimization. (This may be the desired behavior, if the function is supposed to be inlined everywhere by all means, and an error should be generated if it is not.) A convenient way is to define the codice_1 functions in header files and create one .c file per function, containing an codice_22 declaration for it and including the respective header file with the definition. It does not matter whether the declaration is before or after the include.

To prevent unreachable code from being added to the final executable if all uses of a function were inlined, it is advised to put the object files of all such .c files with a single codice_22 function into a static library file, typically with codice_34, then link against that library instead of the individual object files. That causes only those object files to be linked that are actually needed, in contrast to linking the object files directly, which causes them to be always included in the executable. However, the library file must be specified after all the other object files on the linker command line, since calls from object files specified after the library file to the functions will not be considered by the linker. Calls from codice_1 functions to other codice_1 functions will be resolved by the linker automatically (the codice_37 option in codice_34 ensures this).

An alternative solution is to use link time optimization instead of a library. gcc provides the flag codice_39 to omit sections in which all functions are unused. This will be the case for object files containing the code of a single unused codice_22 function. However, it also removes any and all other unused sections from all other object files, not just those related to unused codice_22 functions. (It may be desired to link functions into the executable that are to be called by the programmer from the debugger rather than by the program itself, eg., for examining the internal state of the program.) With this approach, it is also possible to use a single .c file with all codice_22 functions instead of one .c file per function. Then the file has to be compiled with codice_43. However, the gcc manual page warns about that, saying &quot;Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing so.&quot;

Some recommend an entirely different approach, which is to define functions as codice_17 instead of codice_1 in header files. Then, no unreachable code will be generated. However, this approach has a drawback in the opposite case: Duplicate code will be generated if the function could not be inlined in more than one translation unit. The emitted function code cannot be shared among translation units because it must have different addresses. This is another drawback; taking the address of such a function defined as codice_17 in a header file will yield different values in different translation units. Therefore, codice_17 functions should only be used if they are used in only one translation unit, which means that they should only go to the respective .c file, not to a header file.

=== gnu89 ===
gnu89 semantics of codice_1 and codice_22 are essentially the exact opposite of those in C99, with the exception that gnu89 permits redefinition of an codice_22 function as an unqualified function, while C99 codice_1 does not. Thus, gnu89 codice_22 without redefinition is like C99 codice_1, and gnu89 codice_1 is like C99 codice_22; in other words, in gnu89, a function defined codice_1 will always and a function defined codice_22 will never emit an externally visible function. The rationale for this is that it matches variables, for which storage will never be reserved if defined as codice_19 and always if defined without. The rationale for C99, in contrast, is that it would be astonishing if using codice_1 would have a side-effect—to always emit a non-inlined version of the function—that is contrary to what its name suggests.

The remarks for C99 about the need to provide exactly one externally visible function instance for inlined functions and about the resulting problem with unreachable code apply mutatis mutandis to gnu89 as well.

gcc up to and including version 4.2 used gnu89 codice_1 semantics even when codice_61 was explicitly specified. With version 5, gcc switched from gnu89 to the gnu11 dialect, effectively enabling C99 codice_1 semantics by default. To use gnu89 semantics instead, they have to be enabled explicitly, either with codice_63 or, to only affect inlining, codice_64, or by adding the codice_65 attribute to all codice_1 declarations. To ensure C99 semantics, either codice_61, codice_68, codice_69 or codice_70 (without codice_64) can be used.

=== C++ ===
In C++, a function defined codice_1 will, if required, emit a function shared among translation units, typically by putting it into the common section of the object file for which it is needed. The function must have the same definition everywhere, always with the codice_1 qualifier. In C++, codice_22 is the same as codice_1. The rationale for the C++ approach is that it is the most convenient way for the programmer, since no special precautions for elimination of unreachable code must be taken and, like for ordinary functions, it makes no difference whether codice_19 is specified or not.

The codice_1 qualifier is automatically added to a function defined as part of a class definition.

=== armcc ===
armcc in C90 mode provides codice_22 and codice_1 semantics that are the same as in C++: Such definitions will emit a function shared among translation units if required. In C99 mode, codice_22 always emits a function, but like in C++, it will be shared among translation units. Thus, the same function can be defined codice_22 in different translation units. This matches the traditional behavior of Unix C compilers for multiple non-codice_19 definitions of uninitialized global variables.

== Restrictions ==
Taking the address of an codice_1 function requires code for a non-inlined copy of that function to be emitted in any case.

In C99, an codice_1 or codice_22 function must not access codice_86 global variables or define non-codice_87 codice_86 local variables. codice_89 local variables may or may not be different objects in different translation units, depending on whether the function was inlined or whether a call was made. Only codice_17 definitions can reference identifiers with internal linkage without restrictions; those will be different objects in each translation unit. In C++, both codice_87 and non-codice_87 codice_86 locals are allowed and they refer to the same object in all translation units.

gcc cannot inline functions if
# they are variadic,
# use codice_94
# use computed codice_95
# use nonlocal codice_95
# use nested functions
# use codice_97
# use codice_98
# use codice_99, or
# use codice_100

Based on Microsoft Specifications at MSDN, MS Visual C++ cannot inline (not even with codice_12), if

# The function or its caller is compiled with /Ob0 (the default option for debug builds).
# The function and the caller use different types of exception handling (C++ exception handling in one, structured exception handling in the other).
# The function has a variable argument list.
# The function uses inline assembly, unless compiled with /Og, /Ox, /O1, or /O2.
# The function is recursive and not accompanied by codice_102. With the pragma, recursive functions are inlined to a default depth of 16 calls. To reduce the inlining depth, use codice_103 pragma.
# The function is virtual and is called virtually. Direct calls to virtual functions can be inlined.
# The program takes the address of the function and the call is made via the pointer to the function. Direct calls to functions that have had their address taken can be inlined.
# The function is also marked with the naked codice_104 modifier.

==Problems==
Besides the problems with inline expansion in general (see ), codice_1 functions as a language feature may not be as valuable as they appear, for a number of reasons:
* Often, a compiler is in a better position than a human to decide whether a particular function should be inlined. Sometimes the compiler may not be able to inline as many functions as the programmer indicates.
* An important point to note is that the code (of the codice_1 function) gets exposed to its client (the calling function).
* As functions evolve, they may become suitable for inlining where they were not before, or no longer suitable for inlining where they were before. While inlining or un-inlining a function is easier than converting to and from macros, it still requires extra maintenance which typically yields relatively little benefit.
* Inline functions used in proliferation in native C-based compilation systems can increase compilation time, since the intermediate representation of their bodies is copied into each call site.
* The specification of codice_1 in C99 requires exactly one external definition of the function, if it is used somewhere. If such a definition wasn&#x27;t provided by the programmer, that can easily lead to linker errors. This can happen with optimization turned off, which typically prevents inlining. Adding the definitions, on the other hand, can cause unreachable code if the programmer does not carefully avoid it, by putting them in a library for linking, using link time optimization, or codice_17.
* In C++, it is necessary to define an codice_1 function in every module (translation unit) that uses it, whereas an ordinary function must be defined in only a single module. Otherwise it would not be possible to compile a single module independently of all other modules. Depending on the compiler, this may cause each respective object file to contain a copy of the function&#x27;s code, for each module with some use that could not be inlined.
* In embedded software, oftentimes certain functions need to be placed in certain code sections by use of special compiler instructions such as &quot;pragma&quot; statements. Sometimes, a function in one memory segment might need to call a function in another memory segment, and if inlining of the called function occurs, then the code of the called function might end up in a segment where it shouldn&#x27;t be. For example, high-performance memory segments may be very limited in code space, and if a function belonging in such a space calls another large function that is not meant to be in the high-performance section and the called function gets inappropriately inlined, then this might cause the high-performance memory segment to run out of code space. For this reason, sometimes it is necessary to ensure that functions do &quot;not&quot; become inlined.

* District of Utah
* District of Wyoming

These districts were part of the Eighth Circuit until 1929.
The court is composed of nineteen active judges and is based at the Byron White U.S. Courthouse in Denver, Colorado. It is one of thirteen United States courts of appeals and has jurisdiction over 560,625 square miles, or roughly one seventh of the country&#x27;s land mass.

== History ==

Congress created a new judicial circuit in 1929 to accommodate the increased caseload in the federal courts. Between 1866 and 1912, twelve new states had entered the Union and been incorporated into the Eighth and Ninth Circuits. The Eighth Circuit encompassed 13 states and had become the largest in the nation.

Chief Justice William Howard Taft suggested the reorganization of the Eighth Circuit Court in response to widespread opposition in 1928 to a proposal to reorganize the nation&#x27;s entire circuit structure. The original plan had sprung from an American Bar Association committee in 1925 and would have changed the composition of all but two circuits.

The House of Representatives considered two proposals to divide the existing Eighth Circuit. A bill by Representative Walter Newton would separate the circuit&#x27;s eastern and western states. An alternate proposal divided the northern from the southern states. With the judges and bar of the existing Eighth Circuit for Newton&#x27;s bill and little opposition to dividing the circuit, lawmakers focused on providing for more judgeships and meeting places of the circuit courts of appeals in their deliberations.

In 1929, Congress passed a law that placed the federal U.S. district courts in Minnesota, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Missouri, and Arkansas in the Eighth Circuit and created a Tenth Circuit that included Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Three additional judgeships were authorized and the sitting circuit judges were reassigned according to their residence. The Tenth Circuit was assigned a total of four judgeships.

<text>The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (in case citations, 11th Cir.) is a federal appellate court over the following U.S. district courts:

* Middle District of Alabama
* Northern District of Alabama
* Southern District of Alabama
* Middle District of Florida
* Northern District of Florida
* Southern District of Florida
* Middle District of Georgia
* Northern District of Georgia
* Southern District of Georgia

These districts were originally part of the Fifth Circuit, but were split off to form the Eleventh Circuit on October 1, 1981. For this reason, Fifth Circuit decisions from before this split are considered binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.

The court is based at the Elbert P. Tuttle U.S. Court of Appeals Building in Atlanta, Georgia. The building is named for Elbert Tuttle, who served as Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit in the 1960s and was known for issuing decisions which advanced the civil rights of African-Americans.

The Eleventh Circuit is one of the 13 United States courts of appeals.

<text>The Cairns Group (Cairns Group of Fair Trading Nations) is an interest group of 20 agricultural exporting countries, composed of:
Argentina, 
Australia, 
Brazil, 
Canada, 
Chile, 
Colombia, 
Costa Rica, 
Guatemala, 
Indonesia, 
Malaysia, 
New Zealand, 
Pakistan, 
Paraguay, 
Peru,
Philippines, 
South Africa, 
Thailand, 
Ukraine, 
Uruguay, and 
Vietnam.

The Cairns Group seeks to liberalize global trade in agricultural produce. In particular, its members aim to abolish export subsidies and trade-distorting (&quot;amber box&quot;) domestic support for agricultural products and seek to improve market access for agricultural exports. The coalition attempts to present a common front in multilateral trade negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO), tabling joint proposals and occasionally working with like-minded groups such as the G20 group of developing nations.

In September 2018, the Institute of Economic Affairs proposed that the United Kingdom should join 
the Cairns Group &quot;as soon as possible&quot;, stating that although &quot;the UK is not a major agricultural exporter, it is locked into EU supply chains.&quot;.

==History==

===Founding===
The Cairns Group was founded in August 1986, when the Australian government spearheaded the formation of a group and organized the inaugural meeting in the city of Cairns, Australia. There were 14 original member countries—Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Fiji, Hungary, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, and Uruguay—a very diverse group politically and economically. The Australian government led the formation of the group, though some of the South East Asian countries had been working together on agricultural trade through ASEAN. &quot;One of the most striking aspects of the Cairns Group was the intellectual leadership provided by Australia and to a lesser extent Canada. Australia&#x27;s commitment to trade liberalization was the outcome of a long domestic debate in which neoliberal ideas had supplanted protectionism and become the guiding rationale of foreign and domestic policy. The Cairns Group offered a mechanism to promote this agenda in a key multilateral forum.&quot;

The move to form the group was largely a response to spiralling trade subsidies of the European Union&#x27;s Common Agricultural Policy and the United States&#x27; Export Enhancement Program. Particularly, the objection came to the double standards between the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) forcing countries to liberalise their economies, whilst the United States was granted a waiver for agricultural protection in the 1950s.

===Uruguay Round===
The Cairns Group successfully forced agriculture onto the agenda of the Uruguay Round, which eventually led to the Agreement on Agriculture. In April 1989 in Geneva, Switzerland, the Group played a critical role in the framework agreement with United States, the EU, and Japan to cover negotiations during the remainder of the Round.

===Continued protectionism===
In the ongoing Doha Round of trade negotiations, they are mainly opposed by WTO members seeking to uphold their high level of agricultural protection on grounds of public policy, such as the EU, Japan, Norway, South Korea, Switzerland, and United States (dubbed the &quot;multifunctionalists&quot;).

The Group&#x27;s newest member is Vietnam, which joined in November 2013 as its 20th member.

After its December 2013 meeting in Bali, Indonesia, the Cairns Group issued a communiqué stating its concern about &quot;the trend of import restrictions&quot; that go against the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and serve as technical barriers to trade on agricultural products. It criticized &quot;overly complex SPS measures and technical regulations, including food labelling&quot;.

<text>Chupa Chups () is a Spanish brand of confectionery found in over 150 countries. The brand was founded in 1958 by Enric Bernat, and is currently owned by the Italian-Dutch company Perfetti Van Melle. The name of the brand comes from the Spanish verb &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;to suck&quot;. Similar confections are known as lollipops or suckers in English.

== History ==
In the early 1950s, Enric Bernat founded the company Productos Bernat, which specialized in the production of confectionery. Bernat began working for an apple jam factory called &quot;Granja Asturias&quot; in 1954. By 1958, he controlled 100% of the capital of Granja Asturias and renamed the company &quot;Chupa Chups&quot; in 1961. He built the production machines and sold a striped bonbon on a wooden stick, but later it was changed to a plastic one. To ensure that competition in Spain was reduced, he purchased the Spanish patents for similar products in 1959.
In 1967, the company opened the Sant Esteve Sesrovires factory in Barcelona.

In 1977, the lollipops appeared in Japan. In the 1980s, it expanded to the United States, Germany, Italy, Russia and UK. Expansion to China and Mexico happened in the 1990s.

In 1991, Bernat passed formal control of the company to his children Xavier, Ramón, Marcos, Marta and Nina. The Smint subsidiary brand/company was founded in 1994.

In July 2006, the company as a whole was acquired by the Italian-Dutch group Perfetti Van Melle.

== Marketing ==
The Chupa Chups logo was designed in 1969 by the surrealist artist Salvador Dalí. Its first marketing campaign was the logo with the slogan &quot;&quot;Es redondo y dura mucho, Chupa Chups&quot;, which translates from Spanish as &quot;It&#x27;s round and long-lasting&quot;&quot;. Later, celebrities like Madonna were hired to advertise the product.

In the 1973 television series &quot;Kojak&quot;, actor Telly Savalas was featured consuming these lollipops.

In the 1980s, as falling birth rates reduced the number of juvenile consumers, an anti-smoking slogan &quot;Smoke Chupa Chups&quot; was tried to attract adult consumers. The company&#x27;s current anti-smoking slogan is &quot;Stop smoking, start sucking&quot;, with their packages parodying cigarette pack designs. Some packages parody the mandatory black and white warning labels of the European Union with the notice &quot;Sucking does not kill.&quot;

In the 1990s, Chupa Chups began supplying FC Barcelona manager Johan Cruyff with lollipops. Cruyff would suck Chupa Chups on the touchline during matches, having been forced to give up smoking for health reasons. When Cruyff died in 2016, fans left lollipops at his memorial.

Chupa Chups sponsored the 1992 video game &quot;Zool&quot;. Their logo was featured prominently in the first level, &quot;Sweet World&quot;.

In 1995, Chupa Chups became the first candy sent to the Mir space station.

In 1997, Chupa Chups launched a Spice Girls lollipop range with different packages each featuring a collectible Spice Girl sticker, toy microphones, and bubblegum packets that came with collectible Spice Girls temporary tattoos, as well as &quot;Push Pops&quot; and &quot;Crazy Dips&quot;.

Between 2000 and 2003, Chupa Chups was the main shirt sponsor of English football team Sheffield Wednesday.

Since 2010, Chupa Chups was the signature of the Marriott brand hotel Springhill Suites. Chupa Chups were available at the front desk of any Springhill Suites property for free to any guest, child or adult. As of August 2021, Marriott has begun stepping away from Chupa Chups as a signature item for Springhill Suites. 

Messer Chups is a surf rock band from Saint Petersburg, Russia. In the group&#x27;s name, &quot;Messer&quot; is taken from the German word for &quot;knife&quot; and &quot;Chups&quot; from Chupa Chups lollipops.

<doc id="428356" wikidata="Q677659" url="?curid=428356" title="Maison carrée">
<text>The Maison carrée (; French for &quot;square house&quot;) is an ancient Roman temple in Nîmes, southern France; it is one of the best-preserved Roman temples to survive in the territory of the former Roman Empire. It is a mid-sized Augustan provincial temple of the Imperial cult, a &quot;caesareum&quot;.

The Maison carrée inspired the neoclassical Église de la Madeleine in Paris, St. Marcellinus Church in Rogalin, Poland, and in the United States the Virginia State Capitol, which was designed by Thomas Jefferson, who had a stucco model made of the Maison carrée while he was minister to France in 1785.

In September 2023, the Maison carrée of Nîmes was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

== History ==

In about 4–7 AD, the Maison carrée was dedicated or rededicated to Gaius and Lucius Caesar, grandsons and adopted heirs of Augustus who both died young. The inscription dedicating the temple to Gaius and Lucius was removed in medieval times. However, a local scholar, Jean-François Séguier, was able to reconstruct the inscription in 1758 from the order and number of the holes on the front frieze and architrave, to which the bronze letters had been affixed by projecting tines. According to Séguier&#x27;s reconstruction, the text of the dedication read (in translation): &quot;To Gaius Caesar, son of Augustus, Consul; to Lucius Caesar, son of Augustus, Consul designate; to the princes of youth.&quot; During the 19th century the temple slowly began to recover its original splendour, due to the efforts of Victor Grangent.

== Architecture ==
The Maison carrée is similar to a Tuscan style Roman temple as described in the writings of Vitruvius, a contemporary Roman writer on architecture, although it uses the Corinthian order. Raised on a 2.85 m high podium, and at 26.42 m by 13.54 m forming a rectangle almost twice as long as it is wide, the temple dominated the forum of the Roman city of Nîmes, in what is now southern France. The facade contains a deep portico or pronaos that is almost a third of the building&#x27;s length and is richly decorated in terms of its columns and capitals. This deep porch emphasizes the temple front, and distinguishes the layout from ancient Greek temples.

It is a hexastyle design with six Corinthian columns under the pediment at either end, and pseudoperipteral in that twenty engaged columns are embedded along the walls of the cella. Above the columns, the architrave is divided into three levels with ratios of 1:2:3. Egg-and-dart decoration divides the architrave from the frieze. On three sides the frieze is decorated with fine ornamental relief carvings of rosettes and acanthus leaves beneath a row of very fine dentils. However, the refinement of the decorative carvings on the building is not nearly as precise and mathematically perfect as the decoration on the Parthenon or other Greek temples.

A large door (6.87 m high by 3.27 m wide) leads to the small and windowless interior, where the shrine was originally housed. This is now used to house a tourist oriented film on the Roman history of Nîmes. No ancient decoration remains inside the cella.

== Restorations ==
The building has undergone extensive restoration over the centuries. Until the 19th century, it formed part of a larger complex of adjoining buildings. These were demolished when the Maison carrée housed what is now the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nîmes (from 1821 to 1907), restoring it to the isolation it would have enjoyed in Roman times. The pronaos was restored in the early part of the 19th century when a new ceiling was provided, designed in the Roman style. The present door was made in 1824.

It underwent a further restoration between 1988 and 1992, during which time it was re-roofed and the square around it was cleared, revealing the outlines of the forum. Sir Norman Foster was commissioned to build a modern art gallery and public library, known as the Carré d&#x27;Art, on the far side of the square, to replace the city theater of Nîmes, which had burnt down in 1952. This provides a startling contrast to the Maison carrée but renders many of its features, such as the portico and columns, in steel and glass. The contrast of its modernity is thus muted by the physical resemblance between the two buildings, representing architectural styles 2000 years apart.

<doc id="428364" wikidata="Q135005" url="?curid=428364" title="Phishing">
<text>Phishing is a form of social engineering and a scam where attackers deceive people into revealing sensitive information or installing malware such as viruses, worms, adware, or ransomware. Phishing attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and often transparently mirror the site being targeted, allowing the attacker to observe everything while the victim navigates the site, and transverses any additional security boundaries with the victim. As of 2020, it is the most common type of cybercrime, with the FBI&#x27;s Internet Crime Complaint Center reporting more incidents of phishing than any other type of cybercrime.

The term &quot;phishing&quot; was first recorded in 1995 in the cracking toolkit AOHell, but may have been used earlier in the hacker magazine &quot;2600&quot;. It is a variation of &quot;fishing&quot; and refers to the use of lures to &quot;fish&quot; for sensitive information.

Measures to prevent or reduce the impact of phishing attacks include legislation, user education, public awareness, and technical security measures. The importance of phishing awareness has increased in both personal and professional settings, with phishing attacks among businesses rising from 72% in 2017 to 86% in 2020, already rising to 94% in 2023.

==Types==

===Email phishing===
Phishing attacks, often delivered via email spam, attempt to trick individuals into giving away sensitive information or login credentials. Most attacks are &quot;bulk attacks&quot; that are not targeted and are instead sent in bulk to a wide audience. The goal of the attacker can vary, with common targets including financial institutions, email and cloud productivity providers, and streaming services. The stolen information or access may be used to steal money, install malware, or spear phish others within the target organization. Compromised streaming service accounts may also be sold on darknet markets.

This type of social engineering attack can involve sending fraudulent emails or messages that appear to be from a trusted source, such as a bank or government agency. These messages typically redirect to a fake login page where users are prompted to enter their credentials.

=== Spear phishing ===
Spear phishing is a targeted phishing attack that uses personalized messaging, especially e‑mails, to trick a specific individual or organization into believing they are legitimate. It often utilizes personal information about the target to increase the chances of success. These attacks often target executives or those in financial departments with access to sensitive financial data and services. Accountancy and audit firms are particularly vulnerable to spear phishing due to the value of the information their employees have access to.

The Russian government-run Threat Group-4127 (Fancy Bear) (GRU Unit 26165) targeted Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign with spear phishing attacks on over 1,800 Google accounts, using the domain to threaten targeted users.

A study on spear phishing susceptibility among different age groups found that 43% of youth aged 18–25 years and 58% of older users clicked on simulated phishing links in daily e‑mails over 21 days. Older women had the highest susceptibility, while susceptibility in young users declined during the study, but remained stable among older users.

=== Voice phishing (Vishing) ===

Voice over IP (VoIP) is used in vishing or voice phishing attacks, where attackers make automated phone calls to large numbers of people, often using text-to-speech synthesizers, claiming fraudulent activity on their accounts. The attackers spoof the calling phone number to appear as if it is coming from a legitimate bank or institution. The victim is then prompted to enter sensitive information or connected to a live person who uses social engineering tactics to obtain information. Vishing takes advantage of the public&#x27;s lower awareness and trust in voice telephony compared to email phishing.

=== SMS phishing (smishing) ===

SMS phishing or smishing is a type of phishing attack that uses text messages from a cell phone or smartphone to deliver a bait message. The victim is usually asked to click a link, call a phone number, or contact an email address provided by the attacker. They may then be asked to provide private information, such as login credentials for other websites.

The difficulty in identifying illegitimate links can be compounded on mobile devices due to the limited display of URLs in mobile browsers.

Smishing can be just as effective as email phishing, as many smartphones have fast internet connectivity. Smishing messages may also come from unusual phone numbers.

===Page hijacking===

Page hijacking involves redirecting users to malicious websites or exploit kits through the compromise of legitimate web pages, often using cross site scripting. Hackers may insert exploit kits such as MPack into compromised websites to exploit legitimate users visiting the server. Page hijacking can also involve the insertion of malicious inline frames, allowing exploit kits to load. This tactic is often used in conjunction with watering hole attacks on corporate targets.

===Quishing===

A relatively new trend in online scam activity is &quot;quishing&quot;. The term is derived from &quot;QR&quot; (Quick Response) codes and &quot;phishing&quot;, as scammers exploit the convenience of QR codes to trick users into giving up sensitive data, by scanning a code containing an embedded malicious web site link. Unlike traditional phishing, which relies on deceptive emails or websites, quishing uses QR codes to bypass email filters and increase the likelihood that victims will fall for the scam, as people tend to trust QR codes and may not scrutinize them as carefully as a URL or email link. The bogus codes may be sent by email, social media, or in some cases hard copy stickers are placed over legitimate QR codes on such things as advertising posters and car park notices. When victims scan the QR code with their phone or device, they are redirected to a fake website designed to steal personal information, login credentials, or financial details.

As QR codes become more widely used for things like payments, event check-ins, and product information, quishing is emerging as a significant concern for digital security. Users are advised to exercise caution when scanning unfamiliar QR codes and ensure they are from trusted sources, although the UK&#x27;s National Cyber Security Centre rates the risk as far lower than other types of lure.

===Man-in-the-Middle phishing===

Traditional phishing attacks are typically limited to capturing user credentials directly inputted into fraudulent websites. However, the advent of Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) phishing techniques has significantly advanced the sophistication of these attacks, enabling cybercriminals to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanisms during a user&#x27;s active session on a web service. MitM phishing attacks employ intermediary tools that intercept communication between the user and the legitimate service. 

Evilginx, originally created as an open-source tool for penetration testing and ethical hacking, has been repurposed by cybercriminals for MitM attacks. Evilginx works like a middleman, passing information between the victim and the real website without saving passwords or login codes. This makes it harder for security systems to detect, since they usually look for phishing sites that store stolen data. By grabbing login tokens and session cookies instantly, attackers can break into accounts and use them just like the real user, for as long as the session stays active.

Attackers employ various methods, including phishing emails, social engineering tactics, or distributing malicious links via social media platforms. Once the victim interacts with the counterfeit site, the MitM tool intercepts the authentication process, effectively bypassing 2FA protections.

== Techniques ==

===Link manipulation===
Phishing attacks often involve creating fake links that appear to be from a legitimate organization. These links may use misspelled URLs or subdomains to deceive the user. In the following example URL, , it can appear to the untrained eye as though the URL will take the user to the &quot;example&quot; section of the &quot;yourbank&quot; website; this URL points to the &quot;yourbank&quot; (i.e. phishing subdomain) section of the &quot;example&quot; website (fraudster&#x27;s domain name). Another tactic is to make the displayed text for a link appear trustworthy, while the actual link goes to the phisher&#x27;s site. To check the destination of a link, many email clients and web browsers will show the URL in the status bar when the mouse is hovering over it. However, some phishers may be able to bypass this security measure.

Internationalized domain names (IDNs) can be exploited via IDN spoofing or homograph attacks to allow attackers to create fake websites with visually identical addresses to legitimate ones. These attacks have been used by phishers to disguise malicious URLs using open URL redirectors on trusted websites. Even digital certificates, such as SSL, may not protect against these attacks as phishers can purchase valid certificates and alter content to mimic genuine websites or host phishing sites without SSL.

===Social engineering===

Phishing often uses social engineering techniques to trick users into performing actions such as clicking a link or opening an attachment, or revealing sensitive information. It often involves pretending to be a trusted entity and creating a sense of urgency, like threatening to close or seize a victim&#x27;s bank or insurance account.

An alternative technique to impersonation-based phishing is the use of fake news articles to trick victims into clicking on a malicious link. These links often lead to fake websites that appear legitimate, but are actually run by attackers who may try to install malware or present fake &quot;virus&quot; notifications to the victim.

==History==
===Early history===
Early phishing techniques can be traced back to the 1990s, when black hat hackers and the warez community used AOL to steal credit card information and commit other online crimes. The term &quot;phishing&quot; is said to have been coined by Khan C. Smith, a well-known spammer and hacker, and its first recorded mention was found in the hacking tool AOHell, which was released in 1994. AOHell allowed hackers to impersonate AOL staff and send instant messages to victims asking them to reveal their passwords. In response, AOL implemented measures to prevent phishing and eventually shut down the warez scene on their platform.

===2000s===
In the 2000s, phishing attacks became more organized and targeted. The first known direct attempt against a payment system, E-gold, occurred in June 2001, and shortly after the September 11 attacks, a &quot;post-9/11 id check&quot; phishing attack followed. The first known phishing attack against a retail bank was reported in September 2003. Between May 2004 and May 2005, approximately 1.2 million computer users in the United States suffered losses caused by phishing, totaling approximately . Phishing was recognized as a fully organized part of the black market, and specializations emerged on a global scale that provided phishing software for payment, which were assembled and implemented into phishing campaigns by organized gangs. The United Kingdom banking sector suffered from phishing attacks, with losses from web banking fraud almost doubling in 2005 compared to 2004. In 2006, almost half of phishing thefts were committed by groups operating through the Russian Business Network based in St. Petersburg. Email scams posing as the Internal Revenue Service were also used to steal sensitive data from U.S. taxpayers. Social networking sites are a prime target of phishing, since the personal details in such sites can be used in identity theft; In 2007, 3.6 million adults lost due to phishing attacks. The Anti-Phishing Working Group reported receiving 115,370 phishing email reports from consumers with US and China hosting more than 25% of the phishing pages each in the third quarter of 2009.

===2010s===
Phishing in the 2010s saw a significant increase in the number of attacks. In 2011, the master keys for RSA SecurID security tokens were stolen through a phishing attack. Chinese phishing campaigns also targeted high-ranking officials in the US and South Korean governments and military, as well as Chinese political activists. According to Ghosh, phishing attacks increased from 187,203 in 2010 to 445,004 in 2012. In August 2013, Outbrain suffered a spear-phishing attack, and in November 2013, 110 million customer and credit card records were stolen from Target customers through a phished subcontractor account. CEO and IT security staff subsequently fired. In August 2014, iCloud leaks of celebrity photos were based on phishing e-mails sent to victims that looked like they came from Apple or Google. In November 2014, phishing attacks on ICANN gained administrative access to the Centralized Zone Data System; also gained was data about users in the system - and access to ICANN&#x27;s public Governmental Advisory Committee wiki, blog, and whois information portal. Fancy Bear was linked to spear-phishing attacks against the Pentagon email system in August 2015, and the group used a zero-day exploit of Java in a spear-phishing attack on the White House and NATO. Fancy Bear carried out spear phishing attacks on email addresses associated with the Democratic National Committee in the first quarter of 2016. In August 2016, members of the Bundestag and political parties such as Linken-faction leader Sahra Wagenknecht, Junge Union, and the CDU of Saarland were targeted by spear-phishing attacks suspected to be carried out by Fancy Bear. In August 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency reported the receipt of phishing emails sent to users of its database claiming to be official WADA, but consistent with the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear. In 2017, 76% of organizations experienced phishing attacks, with nearly half of the information security professionals surveyed reporting an increase from 2016. In the first half of 2017, businesses and residents of Qatar were hit with over 93,570 phishing events in a three-month span. In August 2017, customers of Amazon faced the Amazon Prime Day phishing attack, when hackers sent out seemingly legitimate deals to customers of Amazon. When Amazon&#x27;s customers attempted to make purchases using the &quot;deals&quot;, the transaction would not be completed, prompting the retailer&#x27;s customers to input data that could be compromised and stolen. In 2018, the company block.one, which developed the EOS.IO blockchain, was attacked by a phishing group who sent phishing emails to all customers aimed at intercepting the user&#x27;s cryptocurrency wallet key, and a later attack targeted airdrop tokens.

===2020s===
Phishing attacks have evolved in the 2020s to include elements of social engineering, as demonstrated by the July 15, 2020, Twitter breach. In this case, a 17-year-old hacker and accomplices set up a fake website resembling Twitter&#x27;s internal VPN provider used by remote working employees. Posing as helpdesk staff, they called multiple Twitter employees, directing them to submit their credentials to the fake VPN website. Using the details supplied by the unsuspecting employees, they were able to seize control of several high-profile user accounts, including those of Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Joe Biden, and Apple Inc.&#x27;s company account. The hackers then sent messages to Twitter followers soliciting Bitcoin, promising to double the transaction value in return. The hackers collected 12.86 BTC (about $117,000 at the time).

==Anti-phishing==
There are anti-phishing websites which publish exact messages that have been recently circulating the internet, such as FraudWatch International and Millersmiles. Such sites often provide specific details about the particular messages.

As recently as 2007, the adoption of anti-phishing strategies by businesses needing to protect personal and financial information was low. There are several different techniques to combat phishing, including legislation and technology created specifically to protect against phishing. These techniques include steps that can be taken by individuals, as well as by organizations. Phone, web site, and email phishing can now be reported to authorities, as described below.

=== User training ===

Effective phishing education, including conceptual knowledge and feedback, is an important part of any organization&#x27;s anti-phishing strategy. While there is limited data on the effectiveness of education in reducing susceptibility to phishing, much information on the threat is available online.

Simulated phishing campaigns, in which organizations test their employees&#x27; training by sending fake phishing emails, are commonly used to assess their effectiveness. One example is a study by the National Library of Medicine, in which an organization received 858,200 emails during a 1-month testing period, with 139,400 (16%) being marketing and 18,871 (2%) being identified as potential threats. These campaigns are often used in the healthcare industry, as healthcare data is a valuable target for hackers. These campaigns are just one of the ways that organizations are working to combat phishing.

Nearly all legitimate e-mail messages from companies to their customers contain an item of information that is not readily available to phishers. Some companies, for example PayPal, always address their customers by their username in emails, so if an email addresses the recipient in a generic fashion (&quot;Dear PayPal customer&quot;) it is likely to be an attempt at phishing. Furthermore, PayPal offers various methods to determine spoof emails and advises users to forward suspicious emails to their spoof@PayPal.com domain to investigate and warn other customers. However it is unsafe to assume that the presence of personal information alone guarantees that a message is legitimate, and some studies have shown that the presence of personal information does not significantly affect the success rate of phishing attacks; which suggests that most people do not pay attention to such details.

Emails from banks and credit card companies often include partial account numbers, but research has shown that people tend to not differentiate between the first and last digits.

A study on phishing attacks in game environments found that educational games can effectively educate players against information disclosures and can increase awareness on phishing risk thus mitigating risks.

The Anti-Phishing Working Group, one of the largest anti-phishing organizations in the world, produces regular report on trends in phishing attacks.

===Technical approaches===
A wide range of technical approaches are available to prevent phishing attacks reaching users or to prevent them from successfully capturing sensitive information.

====Filtering out phishing mail====
Specialized spam filters can reduce the number of phishing emails that reach their addressees&#x27; inboxes. These filters use a number of techniques including machine learning and natural language processing approaches to classify phishing emails, and reject email with forged addresses.

====Browsers alerting users to fraudulent websites====

Another popular approach to fighting phishing is to maintain a list of known phishing sites and to check websites against the list. One such service is the Safe Browsing service. Web browsers such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer 7, Mozilla Firefox 2.0, Safari 3.2, and Opera all contain this type of anti-phishing measure. Firefox 2 used Google anti-phishing software. Opera 9.1 uses live blacklists from Phishtank, cyscon and GeoTrust, as well as live whitelists from GeoTrust. Some implementations of this approach send the visited URLs to a central service to be checked, which has raised concerns about privacy. According to a report by Mozilla in late 2006, Firefox 2 was found to be more effective than Internet Explorer 7 at detecting fraudulent sites in a study by an independent software testing company.

An approach introduced in mid-2006 involves switching to a special DNS service that filters out known phishing domains.

To mitigate the problem of phishing sites impersonating a victim site by embedding its images (such as logos), several site owners have altered the images to send a message to the visitor that a site may be fraudulent. The image may be moved to a new filename and the original permanently replaced, or a server can detect that the image was not requested as part of normal browsing, and instead send a warning image.

====Augmenting password logins====
The Bank of America website was one of several that asked users to select a personal image (marketed as SiteKey) and displayed this user-selected image with any forms that request a password. Users of the bank&#x27;s online services were instructed to enter a password only when they saw the image they selected. The bank has since discontinued the use of SiteKey. Several studies suggest that few users refrain from entering their passwords when images are absent. In addition, this feature (like other forms of two-factor authentication) is susceptible to other attacks, such as those suffered by Scandinavian bank Nordea in late 2005, and Citibank in 2006.

A similar system, in which an automatically generated &quot;Identity Cue&quot; consisting of a colored word within a colored box is displayed to each website user, is in use at other financial institutions.

Security skins are a related technique that involves overlaying a user-selected image onto the login form as a visual cue that the form is legitimate. Unlike the website-based image schemes, however, the image itself is shared only between the user and the browser, and not between the user and the website. The scheme also relies on a mutual authentication protocol, which makes it less vulnerable to attacks that affect user-only authentication schemes.

Still another technique relies on a dynamic grid of images that is different for each login attempt. The user must identify the pictures that fit their pre-chosen categories (such as dogs, cars and flowers). Only after they have correctly identified the pictures that fit their categories are they allowed to enter their alphanumeric password to complete the login. Unlike the static images used on the Bank of America website, a dynamic image-based authentication method creates a one-time passcode for the login, requires active participation from the user, and is very difficult for a phishing website to correctly replicate because it would need to display a different grid of randomly generated images that includes the user&#x27;s secret categories.

====Monitoring and takedown====
Several companies offer banks and other organizations likely to suffer from phishing scams round-the-clock services to monitor, analyze and assist in shutting down phishing websites. Automated detection of phishing content is still below accepted levels for direct action, with content-based analysis reaching between 80% and 90% of success so most of the tools include manual steps to certify the detection and authorize the response. Individuals can contribute by reporting phishing to both volunteer and industry groups, such as cyscon or PhishTank. Phishing web pages and emails can be reported to Google.

====Multi-factor authentication====
Organizations can implement two factor or multi-factor authentication (MFA), which requires a user to use at least 2 factors when logging in. (For example, a user must both present a smart card and a password). This mitigates some risk, in the event of a successful phishing attack, the stolen password on its own cannot be reused to further breach the protected system. However, there are several attack methods which can defeat many of the typical systems. MFA schemes such as WebAuthn address this issue by design.

===Legal responses===
On January 26, 2004, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed the first lawsuit against a Californian teenager suspected of phishing by creating a webpage mimicking America Online and stealing credit card information. Other countries have followed this lead by tracing and arresting phishers. A phishing kingpin, Valdir Paulo de Almeida, was arrested in Brazil for leading one of the largest phishing crime rings, which in two years stole between and . UK authorities jailed two men in June 2005 for their role in a phishing scam, in a case connected to the U.S. Secret Service Operation Firewall, which targeted notorious &quot;carder&quot; websites. In 2006, Japanese police arrested eight people for creating fake Yahoo Japan websites, netting themselves () and the FBI detained a gang of sixteen in the U.S. and Europe in Operation Cardkeeper.

Senator Patrick Leahy introduced the Anti-Phishing Act of 2005 to Congress in the United States on March 1, 2005. This bill aimed to impose fines of up to $250,000 and prison sentences of up to five years on criminals who used fake websites and emails to defraud consumers. In the UK, the Fraud Act 2006 introduced a general offense of fraud punishable by up to ten years in prison and prohibited the development or possession of phishing kits with the intention of committing fraud.

Companies have also joined the effort to crack down on phishing. On March 31, 2005, Microsoft filed 117 federal lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The lawsuits accuse &quot;John Doe&quot; defendants of obtaining passwords and confidential information. March 2005 also saw a partnership between Microsoft and the Australian government teaching law enforcement officials how to combat various cyber crimes, including phishing. Microsoft announced a planned further 100 lawsuits outside the U.S. in March 2006, followed by the commencement, as of November 2006, of 129 lawsuits mixing criminal and civil actions. AOL reinforced its efforts against phishing in early 2006 with three lawsuits seeking a total of under the 2005 amendments to the Virginia Computer Crimes Act, and Earthlink has joined in by helping to identify six men subsequently charged with phishing fraud in Connecticut.

In January 2007, Jeffrey Brett Goodin of California became the first defendant convicted by a jury under the provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. He was found guilty of sending thousands of emails to AOL users, while posing as the company&#x27;s billing department, which prompted customers to submit personal and credit card information. Facing a possible 101 years in prison for the CAN-SPAM violation and ten other counts including wire fraud, the unauthorized use of credit cards, and the misuse of AOL&#x27;s trademark, he was sentenced to serve 70 months. Goodin had been in custody since failing to appear for an earlier court hearing and began serving his prison term immediately.

<doc id="428370" wikidata="Q751239" url="?curid=428370" title="Triforium">
<text>A triforium is an interior gallery, opening onto the tall central space of a building at an upper level. In a church, it opens onto the nave from above the side aisles; it may occur at the level of the clerestory windows, or it may be located as a separate level below the clerestory. Masonry triforia are generally vaulted and separated from the central space by arcades. Early triforia were often wide and spacious, but later ones tend to be shallow, within the thickness of an inner wall, and may be blind arcades not wide enough to walk along. The outer wall of the triforium may itself have windows (glazed or unglazed openings), or it may be solid stone. A narrow triforium may also be called a &quot;blind-storey&quot;, and looks like a row of window frames.

==History==
&quot;Triforium&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;tres&quot;, &quot;tria&quot; &#x27;three&#x27; and &quot;foris&quot; &#x27;door, entrance&#x27;; its Greek equivalent is τρίθυρον, which originally referred to a building with three doors.
The earliest examples of triforia are those in the pagan basilicas, where a triforium constituted an upper gallery for conversation and business; in the early Christian basilicas such a passageway was usually reserved for women, and the same applied to those in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

In Romanesque and Gothic buildings it is either a spacious gallery over the side aisles or is reduced to a simple passage in the thickness of the walls; in either case it forms an important architectural division in the nave of the cathedral or church, and being of less height gives more importance to the ground storey or nave arcade. In consequence of its lesser height its bay was usually divided into two arches, which were again subdivided into two smaller arches and these subdivisions increased the apparent scale of the aisle below and the clerestory above.
On account of the richness of its mouldings and carved ornament in the sculpture introduced in the spandrels, it became the most highly decorated feature of the interior. The triforium at Lincoln has been described as one of the most beautiful compositions of English Gothic architecture. Even when reduced to a simple passage it was always a highly enriched feature. In the 15th-century churches in England, when the roof over the aisles was comparatively flat, more height being required for the clerestory windows, the triforium was dispensed with altogether. In the great cathedrals and abbeys the triforium was often occupied by persons who came to witness various ceremonies, and in early days was probably used by the monks and clergy for work connected with the church.

The triforium sometimes served structural functions, as under its roof are arches and vaults which carry thrust from the nave to the outer wall. When the flying buttress was frankly adopted by the Gothic architect and emphasized by its architectural design as an important feature, other cross-arches were introduced under the roof to strengthen it.

==Matroneum==
A matroneum (plural: matronea; earlier also matronaeum, plural matronaea) in architecture is a gallery on the interior of a building, originally intended to accommodate women, in , Latinised as &quot;gynecaeum&quot;. This definition is disputed by Valerio Ascani, professor of the history of medieval art at the University of Pisa: according to Ascani, &quot;matronea&quot; were in fact intended for all persons who could not, or did not want to, enter the main body of the church below, including men as well as women, although the sexes were always separated to left and right.

In medieval churches, matronea lost their function of accommodation and became purely architectonic elements, placed over the side aisles with the structural purpose of containing the thrust of the central nave, and came to consist solely of bays so placed.

In Early Gothic churches, the matronea were one of the four elements which constituted the interior walls (arch, matroneum, triforium and clerestory), but they grew rare in the succeeding period of full-blown Gothic architecture.

<text>Janus Friis (; born 26 June 1976) is a Danish entrepreneur best known for co-founding the file-sharing application Kazaa, and the peer-to-peer telephony application Skype. In September 2005, he and his business partner Niklas Zennström sold Skype to eBay for $2.6B. Friis has maintained ownership interest in Skype through Silver Lake Partners, which sold Skype to Microsoft for $8.5 billion (~$ in ), in May 2011.

Friis and Zennström also developed Joost—an interactive software application for distributing TV shows and other forms of video content over the Web. The assets of this service were sold to Adconion Media Group in November 2009. Independently, Friis founded video streaming startup Vdio in 2011.

Friis and Ahti Heinla founded Starship Technologies in 2014, to develop small self-driving delivery robots.

==Career==
Friis had no formal higher education, dropping out of high school before starting a job at the help desk of CyberCity, one of Denmark&#x27;s first Internet service providers. He met Zennström in 1996. At that time, Zennström headed Tele2 in Denmark, and Friis was hired to run its customer support. Friis and Zennström worked together at Tele2 to launch get2net, another Danish ISP, and the portal everyday.com.

After this, the partners decided to leave Tele2. Friis moved into Zennström&#x27;s small apartment in Amsterdam in January 2000 where they started developing KaZaA, the company responsible for the most popular software for use with the FastTrack file sharing network protocol. Janus Friis and Niklas Zennström developed the FastTrack protocol in 2001.

From the success of KaZaA&#x27;s peer-to-peer technology the duo co-founded Joltid, a software company developing and marketing peer-to-peer solutions and peer-to-peer traffic optimization technologies to companies.

Friis is also co-founder of Altnet, a network that sells commercial music to KaZaA users.

Friis founded the online music streaming service Rdio with Zennström in 2010. It filed for bankruptcy in November 2015 and announced the sale of assets to Pandora Radio for $75 million (~$ in ).

In 2012, Friis co-founded Wire, a secure collaboration platform that uses end-to-end encryption to protect digital assets.

Friis and Ahti Heinla founded Starship Technologies in 2014, to develop small self-driving delivery robots. In September 2016, the robots took the streets in San Francisco in a test authorized by the city.

==Awards==
Friis was named in &quot;Time Magazine&quot;&#x27;s list of 100 most influential people in 2006.

In 2006 Janus Friis got the prestigious award “IT-prisen” (&quot;The IT Prize&quot;) in his home country, given by the Danish IT industry and IDG, for his work and innovation.

He and Zennström were also the co-recipients of the 2006 Wharton Infosys Business Transformation Award, given to business and individuals who have used information technology in a way that changed an industry or society as a whole.

== Personal life ==
He was engaged to Danish recording artist Aura Dione but the couple split up in April 2015.

<text>A nanotube is a nanoscale cylindrical structure with a hollow core, typically composed of carbon atoms, though other materials can also form nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are the most well-known and widely studied type, consisting of rolled-up sheets of graphene with diameters ranging from about 1 to tens of nanometers and lengths up to millimeters. These structures exhibit remarkable physical, chemical, and electrical properties, including high tensile strength, excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, and unique quantum effects due to their one-dimensional nature. Nanotubes can be classified into two main categories: single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs), each with distinct characteristics and potential applications. Since their discovery in 1991, nanotubes have been the subject of intense research and development, with promising applications in fields such as electronics, materials science, energy storage, and medicine.

== Types ==
* BCN nanotube, composed of comparable amounts of boron, carbon, and nitrogen atoms
* Boron nitride nanotube, a polymorph of boron nitride
* Carbon nanotube, includes general nanotube terminology and diagrams
* DNA nanotube, a two-dimensional lattice which curves back upon itself, somewhat similar in size and shape to a carbon nanotube
* Gallium nitride nanotube, a nanotube of gallium nitride
* Silicon nanotube, made of silicon atoms
* Non-carbon nanotube, especially tungsten(IV) sulfide nanotubes
* Tunneling nanotube, a tubular membrane connection between cells
* Titanium nanotubes, created by the conversion of the mineral anatase by hydrothermal synthesis

==Nanotubes builders ==
* Chiraltube. Atomistic builder for any nanotubes with any chirality from any 2D material. 
* TubeASP. For carbon nanotubes.
* Nanotuve Modeler. For carbon nanotubes only.

<text>Anton Turek (18 January 1919 – 11 May 1984) was a German footballer who played as a goalkeeper.

== Career ==
Born in Duisburg, Turek started his career at Duisburger Sportverein, but he soon moved to TuS Duisburg 48/99. He first came to the attention of later West Germany national team coach Sepp Herberger was on 27 September 1936, when West Germany played a preparation game against Luxembourg in Krefeld. Before that game, the youth teams of Krefeld and TuS Duisburg 48/99 had met with the 17-year-old Turek standing in the Duisburg goal. During World War II Turek was lucky things did not turn out worse for him as a shell splinter struck through his helmet.

In 1950 Turek transferred to Fortuna Düsseldorf. Between 1950 and 1954 he played 20 games for the West Germany national team. He played in &quot;The Miracle of Bern&quot; 1954 FIFA World Cup final against Hungary and won the Championship.

After a fine save from a very close shot by Nándor Hidegkuti, he was described by the sports reporter Herbert Zimmermann with the words &quot;Toni, you&#x27;re a football God&quot;. He later had to apologize for that comment because the church complained about the comparison of a football player with God.

==Death==
Turek died in Neuss in 1984. He had been paralyzed from the waist down since August 1973.

==Legacy==
He has received numerous honours and is still highly regarded in Germany, especially in the Rhineland.

<text>Tagansky District () is a district of Central Administrative Okrug of the federal city of Moscow, Russia, located between the Moskva and Yauza Rivers near the mouth of the latter. Population: 

== Name ==
The district takes its name from the former &quot;Taganskaya&quot; &quot;sloboda&quot;, where the copper-smiths lived in the 16th century. &quot;Tagan&quot; is the old Russian word for their product, a trivet to set a pot on (known in English as &quot;brand-iron&quot;). 

== History ==

=== 14th - 19th centuries ===

The city of Moscow expanded beyond the boundaries of the Kremlin and Zaryadye at the turn of the 14th and 15th centuries. Around the same time, settlement began on the left bank of the Yauza River, primarily by artisans who were relocated from the city due to the fire hazards associated with their trades, such as potters and blacksmiths. &lt;br&gt;
In the 16th century, the rapidly growing blacksmiths&#x27; settlement pushed the potters&#x27; community to the eastern part of what is now Goncharnaya Street, which emerged as a branch off the main Kolomenskaya Road.

In the mid-17th century, the population density in Zayauzye became one of the highest in Moscow. At that time, Zayauzye was bordered to the east by the Earthen Rampart, with the only gate located at Taganskaya Square. A market formed there, known as Tagansky Market, where most of the stalls in the 17th century were run by the streltsy.

In the fire of 1812, Zayauzye burned down almost completely. In the Yauza part of the district, 36 houses remained, in Rogozhskaya - 63, in Taganskaya - only 13. The fire of 1886 almost completely destroyed subdistrict. Reconstruction of the area took place slowly, without any plan.

=== Great October Revolution - World War II ===

The first residential building built in Moscow after the revolution appeared on Taganka. On October 14, 1923, the Dynamo plant building, No. 9 Sorokosvyatskaya Street, renamed Dynamovskaya in 1924, was ceremoniously occupied.

The most visible contribution of the pre-war decade to the architectural appearance of Taganka was the development of the embankments and the new Bolshoy Ustinsky and Bolshoy Krasnokholmsky Bridges.

== The modern district of Taganka ==

The modern center of the Taganka district is the Taganskaya Square, where the Taganka Theatre is located. The skyline is dominated by the Kotelnicheskaya Embankment Building, once the tallest skyscraper in the Soviet Union. The area contains a fine set of pre-Petrine parish churches, including the Athonite metochion and the Bolvanovka Church of St. Nicholas.

Apart from Taganka proper, the modern district includes other historic neighbourhoods such as Kulishki in the eastern Bely Gorod, Khitrovka, Solyanka, Krutitsy, and (the spiritual centre of Old Believers). Major sights include the 18th-century Foundling Home and at least three walled monasteries — the Andronikov, the Pokrovsky, and the Novospassky.

<text>A sky marshal is a covert law enforcement or counter-terrorist agent on board a commercial aircraft to counter aircraft hijackings. Such an agent is also known as an air marshal, a flight marshal, or an in-flight security officer (IFSO). Sky marshals may be provided by airlines such as El Al (who provide sky marshals on every flight), or by government agencies such as the Austrian Einsatzkommando Cobra, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, German Federal Police, National Security Guard in India, Metropolitan Police MO19 (Specialist Firearms Command) from London, Pakistan Airports Security Force, or US Federal Air Marshal Service.

==History==

The history of in-flight security began in March 1971 when the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) directed a program to combat airplane hijackings. In that same year, there were numerous airplane hijackings in the United States that were planned with the ultimate aim to fly to Cuba. In response, the FAA created the title of FAA peace officer. FAA peace officers were the first people to provide armed security onboard commercial aircraft.

===Australia===
In response to the September 11 attacks, the commonwealth instituted an air security officer (ASO) program under the Australian Federal Police in December 2001. These officers are generally referred to in the media as &quot;sky marshals&quot;. The ASO Program provides a discreet anti-hijacking capability for Australian civil aviation by putting armed security personnel on board aircraft. This involves both random and intelligence-led placement of armed ASOs on flights operated by Australian registered air carriers, on both domestic and international flights.

Officers are armed, trained and equipped for a variety of situations on both domestic and international flights.

===Austria===
In Austria, armed air marshals have been provided since 1981 by the Einsatzkommando Cobra.

===Canada===
The Canadian Air Carrier Protection/Protective Program (CACPP) began on September 17, 2002, when a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Royal Canadian Mounted Police with Transport Canada, the authority responsible for Canadian aviation security, and the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA), for the implementation and administration of the CACPP. The program is conducted by specially trained undercover armed RCMP officers (known as &quot;aircraft protective officers&quot; – APOs) on selected domestic and international flights and all flights to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in the United States. Pilots and flight attendants are advised of their presence and the officer is authorized to physically intervene should an unauthorized person attempt to gain control of an aircraft. APOs, however, will not get involved in controlling unruly passengers. While they are peace officers within Canadian territories, they rely on section 6(2) of the Tokyo Convention as a legal basis for intervening in an incident outside of Canadian airspace. By law, such officers are exempt from acquiring a permit for importing or exporting their duty firearms when crossing the border. However, the exact nature of their weaponry is not released to the public except they are &quot;deadly and effective and should not damage the aircraft&quot;. The Canadian Forces Military Police members of the Canadian Forces Air Marshal Detail, are responsible for providing security to Canadian forces aircraft, crew and passengers – passengers who may include the governor general, the prime minister and members of the royal family.

===India===
Sky marshals were introduced by Indian Airlines in December 1999, following the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814 in Kandahar. Following the September 11 attacks, private operators like Air Sahara also introduced sky marshals on some flights and stated plans to increase these.

In 2003, Air India had an agreement with a US directive to have air marshals on all of its US-bound flights. They are recruited from India&#x27;s elite commando force National Security Guard. Ipsita Biswas of India&#x27;s Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL) were developing frangible bullets which shatter if they hit a substance that is harder than the bullet is. The application would allow their sky marshals to use these bullets to shoot, or threaten to shoot, hijackers on board aircraft, with the assurance that the aircraft itself would not suffer substantial damage.

===Ireland===
Ireland does not have a dedicated sky marshal agency, although there is a National Civil Aviation Security Committee (NCASC). Limited capabilities are provided by the Garda Síochána emergency response unit (ERU), the national police armed tactical unit, and backup may be provided by the counter-terrorism the Garda Special Detective Unit (SDU) and the Army Ranger Wing (ARW) special forces unit in certain situations.

The Irish government allows armed flight marshals from the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Israel, Australia and specific European Union countries onboard international flights landing from or destined for those countries in Irish airspace, once they are informed of their presence beforehand. Weapons carried by an air marshal in Ireland include a concealed handgun, taser, knife and pepper spray.

=== Israel ===
Undercover agents carrying concealed firearms sit among the passengers on every international El Al flight. Most El Al pilots are former Israeli Air Force pilots. The cockpits in all El Al aircraft have double doors to prevent entry by unauthorized persons. A code is required to access the doors, and the second door will open only after the first has closed and the person has been identified by the captain or first officer. Furthermore, there are reinforced steel floors separating the passenger cabin from the baggage hold.

In April 2013, the Israeli government increased payments to El Al to secure 97.5% of the airline&#x27;s security costs ahead of the Open Skies agreement to take effect in 2014 with the European Union.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, armed sky marshals are deployed on all flights. Sky marshals are provided by Airports Security Force (ASF).

The ASF was established in 1976 under the Airports Security Force Act LXXVII of 1975, initially as the directorate within the Department of Civil Aviation. After the hijacking of a Pakistan International Airlines aircraft in March 1981, sensing the contradictory requirements of security and facilitation, the ASF was separated, and, in December 1983, was placed under the folds of the Ministry of Defence.

===Singapore===
Singapore Airlines deploys sky marshals on its flights. Such members are armed with firearms loaded with special ammunition and dart-firing stun guns.

Members are usually from either the air marshal unit, the security command or the special tactics and rescue (STAR) of the Singapore Police Force. Members have undergone extensive training to enable them to operate effectively within the confines of an aircraft.

===United Kingdom===
An armed Air Marshal program began operating in the United Kingdom in 2002, it was in response to growing threats to civilian passenger aircraft. The Metropolitan Police Service Specialist Firearms Command SO19 is tasked with operating the Aircraft Protection Operations (APO) Program, for which all UK Air Marshals report to. The extent and size of the program is relatively unknown as few details are released to the media due to the sensitivity of the operation.

===United States===

The US Federal Aviation Administration began its sky marshal program in 1968, which eventually became the FAA Federal Air Marshal Program, in 1982; the program later became the Federal Air Marshal Service in January 2002 and after the handover of FAA security duties to the Transportation Security Administration. In 2005, Rigoberto Alpizar was shot dead by two sky marshals on a jetway at Miami International Airport. Currently, federal air marshal officers are under the Transportation Security Administration. Under the Visible Intermodal Prevention Response (VIPR) system, started around 2005, federal air marshals began to patrol non-aviation sites like bus terminals and train stations.

<text>The Yauza () is a river in Moscow and Mytishchi, Russia, a tributary of the Moskva. It originates in the Losiny Ostrov National Park northeast of Moscow, flows through Mytishchi, enters Moscow in the Medvedkovo District and flows through the city in an irregular, meandering, generally north-south direction. The Yauza joins the Moskva River in Tagansky District just west of Tagansky Hill, now marked by the Kotelnicheskaya Embankment tower. Valleys of the Yauza, from the MKAD beltway in the north to the Moscow-Yaroslavl railway west of Sokolniki Park, are protected as natural reserves.

The Yauza has been mentioned in Russian chronicles since 1156; the exact origin of the name is unknown. Moscow crossed its former natural eastern boundary (marked by the Yauza) in the beginning of the 16th century. The banks of the Yauza within the Garden Ring were densely urbanized by the middle of the 17th century; upstream valleys housed suburban residences of the House of Romanov, from Mikhail to Catherine II. Settlements along the Yauza (German Quarter, Lefortovo, Preobrazhenskoye) played a significant role in the history of Russia in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Industrialization in the 19th and 20th centuries made the Yauza &quot;the biggest gutter for waste in Moscow&quot;. In the 2000s the ecology improved, with the closing or conversion of old factories and cleanup efforts by the city government. In 2007 the Yauza waters were reclassified from &quot;dirty&quot; to &quot;polluted&quot; status, but in 2008 the trend reversed and pollution in the Yauza exceeded its 2006 levels. As of 2008, Yauza water passing the Moscow city boundary is rated as &quot;polluted&quot;, and reaches a &quot;very dirty&quot; level at its inlet. Untreated surface runoff in the Central Administrative District remains the main source of pollution.

==Geology==

The Yauza is arguably one of the most ancient European rivers. A proto-Yauza River first appeared in Permian-Triassic period, at which time it flowed to the east of its present riverbed, down today&#x27;s Izmailovo Gully. After being periodically submerged during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, the region finally became land in the Tertiary period. Due to minor elevation changes, the Yauza diverted into its present course, with its former riverbed taken over by the present-day Serebryanka, which forms part of Yauza basin and flows in the westward direction opposite to the original Yauza.

==Geography==

The Yauza is long, and has a drainage basin of . It consists of three parts: 
The Yauza collects waters from many tributaries, most of them confined to underground sewers (e.g. Rachka, Rybenka and Khapilovka). The few that remain on the surface, at least partially, are (north to south):


The flow of the Yauza is regulated (particularly in winter) and reinforced with water from the Volga that reaches the city through the Moscow Canal. 80 million cubic meters of Volga water is sourced each year from the Khimki Reservoir in northwest Moscow and fed through underground pipes and an open channel to Golovinsky Ponds and the Likhoborka River (a tributary of the Yauza). The water level in the lower Yauza is regulated by the Pererva Dam () on the Moskva River, and by the locks () on the Yauza itself east of Kursky Rail Terminal. Raised water levels in the downtown portion of the Yauza basin led to long-term flooding and death of trees deep inside Losiny Ostrov.

Within the city of Moscow the Yauza is spanned by 21 road bridges, five railroad bridges, one dedicated tram bridge, two Moscow Metro bridges, numerous pedestrian bridges and the historical Rostokino Aqueduct. Spring floods due to low clearance under old bridges were common, with four in the 1950s alone (1951, 1952, 1955 and 1957); they were practically eliminated when these bridges were rebuilt to modern standards. The most recent flash flood on the Yauza occurred August 14, 2003, following a record-setting rainfall. The Yauza and its valleys are not particularly prone to the landslides and erosion common in the western and southern districts of Moscow. There were two minor landslides on the Yauza in 2008, compared with 40 on the Chertanovka River and 33 on the Gorodnya River.

There is no commercial or recreational shipping, although the river is accessible to small motor boats as far as Preobrazhenskaya Square ().

==History==

===Prehistory to the Time of Troubles===

The first mention of the Yauza (as &quot;Auza&quot;) in Russian chronicles is directly connected to the foundation of Moscow: according to the chronicles, in 1156 Yury Dolgoruky &quot;founded Moscow at the estuary of Neglinnaya above the Yauza&quot; on the site owned by Stepan Kuchka and known through another chronicle since 1147. There is no generally accepted etymology for &quot;Yauza&quot; or &quot;Auza&quot;. Similar toponyms (&quot;Auzas&quot;, &quot;Auzes&quot;, &quot;Auzi&quot;) exist in modern Latvia; the Baltic origins of &quot;Yauza&quot; are generally accepted but have not been proven.

Medieval Moscow grew from its Kremlin primarily in a northeasterly direction, towards the Yauza. St. Andronik Monastery on the Yauza (established in 1357) formed the eastern defence arc, together with the Pokrovsky and Novospassky monasteries. The Yauza was used as a commercial waterway from Moscow to Vladimir until the 16th century; boats that reached the upper Yauza were dragged over land to the Klyazma River. 
After the fire of 1494, Ivan III of Russia set up his country residence on the western bank of the Yauza in Vorontsovo (). During the same period potters, blacksmiths and other craftsmen deemed a fire hazard were evicted from Moscow proper onto the opposite, eastern bank of the Yauza (the present-day area of Taganka Square), thus beginning the industrialization of the river.

===17th and 18th centuries===

Slobodas (settlements) of metalworkers&#x27; guilds expanded, and in the 17th century Taganka became the most densely populated, remote area of the city of Moscow. The lower Yauza was used by numerous watermills and public baths tending to the growing population.

Suburban valleys of the Yauza also flourished under the early Romanovs. Tsar Mikhail of Russia (reigned 1613–1645) established his country palace in Rubtsovo () and his former rival Prince Dmitry Pozharsky (1577–1642) lived further out, in Medvedkovo on the Yauza (). Alexis I of Russia (reigned 1645–1676) established a chain of country residencies in Preobrazhenskoye and Alekseevskoye () on the Yauza, and Izmaylovo Estate on its Serebryanka tributary. In 1653 Alexis yielded to the pressure of Orthodox clergy and expelled Catholics and Protestants from Moscow; they resettled in the German Quarter on the eastern bank of the Yauza, isolated from the city by the marshes around the Kokuy and Chechora streams.

Tsar Peter I (reigned 1682–1725) established his own headquarters in Preobrazhenskoye, and was a regular guest in the German Quarter. He neglected his father&#x27;s palaces, instead concentrating on the military (Preobrazhensky Lifeguard regiment, established 1687) and supporting the industries spreading on both banks of the river. Bartolomeo Rastrelli erected &quot;Annenhof&quot;, a summer residence for empress Anna of Russia, in Lefortovo in 1731. Annenhof burnt down in 1746 and was eventually replaced by Catherine&#x27;s Palace (), designed by Giacomo Quarenghi; the palace now houses a military academy, and the former palace gardens have become a public park. Elizabeth of Russia built her country palace in Rubtsovo, on the site of Mikhail&#x27;s former residence (), from 1735 to 1743.

The Old Believers, a persecuted religious minority, were allowed to practice their beliefs in two isolated communities east of the Yauza (Rogozhskoye Cemetery and Preobrazhenskoye Cemetery) beginning in the 1770s. Edinoverie, a moderate branch of Old Believers in communion with the official Orthodox Church, built a large church complex on a high eastern bank of Yauza in Lefortovo ().

In 1779 Catherine II authorized the construction of Moscow&#x27;s first water-supply network. Water from underground aquifers in the upper Yauza basin flowed to downtown Moscow through underground pipes, surface canals and an aqueduct which crossed the Yauza valley in Rostokino. After numerous delays and setbacks, the system was commissioned in 1804 and operated into the 20th century; the city of Mytishchi continues to use Yauza aquifers.

===Industrialization===
State-run factories established by Peter I on the Yauza provided the seed for a chain of private factories; by the end of the 18th century significant industrial clusters emerged in Lefortovo and former German Quarter (then practically devoid of Western-European influence). In 1846, pollution from these mills prompted Moscow governor Aleksey Shcherbatov to survey the banks of the Yauza and enforce administrative action against the offenders. 

Industrialization of the Yauza outside of the Garden Ring limits increased with the advent of railroads; within the Ring, the banks of the Yauza were the only heavily industrialized area. A major hub of three railway stations emerged north from the Yauza in the third quarter of the 19th century. The dense rail network helped establish the eastern perimeter of Moscow (Basmanny, Lefortovo, Rogozhskoye and Sokolniki) as &quot;the fastest growing and the most variegated area, holding dozens of textile and garment factories but also machinery enterprises and Moscow&#x27;s one steel mill.&quot;

The railroad infrastructure in Krasnoselsky District, a steady source of municipal revenue, was threatened by regular floods on numerous tributaries of the Yauza. This risk, along with the drive to free up land for development, led to the first modern flood control measures in the Yauza basin. Red Pond (), connected to the Yauza by the Chechora River, was drained and converted to municipal rail yards in 1900–1911. During the same period, the Chechora was diverted into an underground sewer and the Yauza was spanned by new bridges.

Higher education along the Yauza goes back to the Imperial Technical College, established in 1830 and now known as Moscow State Technical University. The present college community around MSTU includes Moscow Power Engineering Institute, Moscow Technical University of Communications and Informatics, the Military University in Lefortovo, Moscow State University of Geodesy and Cartography, the State University Of Land Use Planning, Moscow State Pedagogical University and others in Basmanny District.

===20th century===
TsAGI (the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute), established in 1918 in the former German Quarter, () became a seed for one of two aircraft-industry clusters in Moscow. An aircraft-engine plant (the present-day NPO Salyut) was established on the opposite bank in 1926. Andrey Tupolev&#x27;s design firm moved out of TsAGI into his own premises on the Yauza () in 1936; by 1945, the Tupolev staff reached 5,226. The postwar period added the Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant in Sokolniki and the Lyulka rocket-design bureau (now NPO Saturn) in Babushkinsky District.
Joseph Stalin&#x27;s 1935 Moscow Reconstruction Plan called for the creation of an inner ring of navigable waterways in northern Moscow. The proposed Northern Shipping Canal () connectingKhimki Reservoir with the Yauza would have made the latter navigable up to Sviblovo; the Yauza valley north from Sviblovo would have been flooded into a broad reservoir. A system of four sets of locks would gradually reduce the water level; the river itself was to be deepened and widened into a navigable canal with granite embankments and broad, riverside highways. Further industrialization of the Yauza was prohibited; the embankments of the Moskva and the Yauza were zoned for high-profile public and residential buildings.

The Northern Canal, initially planned for completion in 1939, was never built; instead, the water level in the Yauza was reinforced through a low-cost water pipe connecting the Khimki Reservoir and the Likhoborka River (right-side tributary of the Yauza). A single set of locks (instead of four), designed by Georgy Golts, was built in 1940. The river was widened and flanked with embankments according to plan, albeit at a slower pace.

The social and zoning policies made in 1935 were soon discarded; industrialization of the Yauza drainage basin continued unchecked through the Soviet period, particularly in the &quot;reviled south-east quadrant&quot; not obstructed by park and forest reserves. The territory immediately east and southeast of the Yauza became &quot;the city&#x27;s worst rust and smokestack belt&quot;. The &quot;problem child of the first Five Year Plan&quot; continued to grow until the economic collapse of early 1990s, and the river itself became &quot;a reeking porridge of raw wastes from eighty-two manufacturing plants.&quot;

In the 1990s manufacturing along the Yauza declined, and by 2009 many former industrial sites had been converted or rebuilt into offices and housing.

==Ecology==


The industrialization of the Soviet period polluted the Yauza drainage basin to a point where &quot;an oil-soaked tributary of Yauza burst into flame in 1971&quot;; the Yauza itself &quot;was called a river only by force of habit... the biggest gutter for waste in Moscow&quot; and caused a prominent surge in Moskva River pollution below the Yauza inlet. By 2005 this surge disappeared, although pollution levels in the lower Yauza remained 2–3 times higher than in the Moskva just below the Yauza inlet.

Untreated filthy surface runoff was (as of 2008) the main source of pollution; in the 1980s it contributed one to eight times more petrochemical waste than direct industrial waste. As of 2008, nearly 80% of the surface runoff in the Central Administrative District is still flushed into the Moskva and Yauza untreated. Until 2000 the river was used in winter as a dump for snow collected from the streets, adding chlorides, soot, rubbish and more oil into the mix. This practice is now banned; the city now employs a network of snow-melting dumps that feed polluted water into treatment facilities.

Pollution levels gradually decreased in the 1990s and 2000s, as riverside factories were closed and converted (or completely rebuilt) into offices and housing; by 2008, industry contributed less than 10% of the city&#x27;s waste water. The historical Kristall distillery () in Lefortovo remains the last major industrial pollutant on the Yauza.

Between 2001 and 2007 the city drained the lower stretches of the Yauza, swept poisonous sediments off its bottom and plugged hundreds of illegal sewage outlets. The city commissioner&#x27;s report for 2007 registered a significant decrease in pollution levels between 2006 and 2007 alone (a similar decrease was recorded in 2005), and reclassified Yauza water from &quot;dirty&quot; (pollution index of 4..6) to &quot;polluted&quot; (index just below 4), specifically mentioning high levels of iron and manganese.

In 2008, however, the trend reversed and pollution in the Yauza exceeded its 2006 levels. The petrochemical content in the Yauza was more than three times the national limit (2008: 0.93 mg/L vs. 0.3), suspended particles fivefold (2008: 56 mg/L vs. 10.25). Iron, manganese, formaldehyde, chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) also exceeded the maximum allowed limits. The Yauza tributaries (except the Ichka River) are still rated as either &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;very dirty&quot; (pollution index 6..10). The city (as of 2008) planned the rehabilitation of the Yauza tributaries Chermyanka and Likhoborka, which was then threatened by shortage of funds in the wake of the 2008 Russian financial crisis.

The upper, cleaner stretch of the Yauza is home to about 20 species of fish, predominantly burbot, perch, crucian carp and gobio, but the lower Yauza also has a population of hardy fish. Perch caught near the Yauza inlet in the 1990s contained over 250 times the maximum allowed amount of petrochemical substances. The abundance of crucian carp became public in April 2008, when an accidental release of hot water from a power plant killed over a hundred fish near the Rostokino Aqueduct. &quot;Gobio albipinnatus&quot;, a fish that was believed to be extinct in the Moscow Oblast, was rediscovered in the Yauza and the Setun River in 1993.

<doc id="428407" wikidata="Q4339810" url="?curid=428407" title="Memory debugger">
<text>A memory debugger is a debugger for finding software memory problems such as memory leaks and buffer overflows. These are due to bugs related to the allocation and deallocation of dynamic memory. Programs written in languages that have garbage collection, such as managed code, might also need memory debuggers, e.g. for memory leaks due to &quot;living&quot; references in collections.

==Overview==
Memory debuggers work by monitoring memory access, allocations, and deallocation of memory. Many memory debuggers require applications to be recompiled with special dynamic memory allocation libraries, whose APIs are mostly compatible with conventional dynamic memory allocation libraries, or else use dynamic linking. Electric Fence is such a debugger which debugs memory allocation with malloc. Some memory debuggers (e.g. Valgrind) work by running the executable in a virtual machine-like environment, monitoring memory access, allocation and deallocation so that no recompilation with special memory allocation libraries is required.

Finding memory issues such as leaks can be extremely time consuming as they may not manifest themselves except under certain conditions. Using a tool to detect memory misuse makes the process much faster and easier.

As abnormally high memory utilization can be a contributing factor in software aging, memory debuggers can help programmers to avoid software anomalies that would exhaust the computer system memory, thus ensuring high reliability of the software even for long runtimes.

==Comparison to static analyzer==
Some static analysis tools can also help find memory errors. Memory debuggers operate as part of an application while it&#x27;s running while static code analysis is performed by analyzing the code without executing it. These different techniques will typically find different instances of problems, and using them both together yields the best result.

==List of memory debugging tools==
This is a list of tools useful for memory debugging. A profiler can be used in conjunction with a memory debugger.

<text>The Arts Council of Great Britain was a non-departmental public body dedicated to the promotion of the fine arts in Great Britain. It was divided in 1994 to form the Arts Council of England (now Arts Council England), the Scottish Arts Council (later merged into Creative Scotland), and the Arts Council of Wales. At the same time the National Lottery was established and these three arts councils, plus the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, became distribution bodies.

==History==
In January 1940, during the Second World War, the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA) was appointed to help promote and maintain British culture. Chaired by Lord De La Warr, President of the Board of Education, the council was government-funded and after the war was renamed the Arts Council of Great Britain. Reginald Jacques was appointed musical director, with Sir Henry Walford Davies and George Dyson also involved. John Denison took over after the war.

A royal charter was granted on 9 August 1946 followed by another in 1967. The latter provided for functions in Scotland and Wales to be conducted by two committees known as the Scottish and Welsh Arts Councils – the basis for the later Scottish Arts Council and Arts Council of Wales.

The council&#x27;s first chairman was John Maynard Keynes who used his influence in government to secure a high level of funding despite Britain&#x27;s poor finances following the war. The majority of this funding was directed to organisations with which Keynes had close ties such as the Royal Opera House and was restricted to Central London. Keynes used his political influence to ensure that the Arts Council reported directly to the Treasury rather than an arts minister or the education department as had been the case with CEMA, establishing the principle of an &#x27;arms length&#x27; relationship between UK arts policy and the government of the day.

After Keynes&#x27; death in April 1946 government funding was reduced but the Arts Council received wide recognition for its contribution to the Festival of Britain thanks to the new chairman Kenneth Clark. Artworks commissioned by the council for the festival were retained to form the basis of the Arts Council Collection. The Arts Council commissioned 12 sculptors and 60 painters, who made large paintings, or more, to be displayed at the festival. Ultimately the works were to be given to new hospitals, libraries, schools, and health centres that emerged after the war. There were five cash prizes awarded: Robert Adams&#x27;s &quot;Apocalyptic Figure,&quot; Elinor Bellingham-Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Island,&quot; Lucian Freud&#x27;s &quot;Interior near Paddington,&quot; William Gear&#x27;s &quot;Autumn Landscape,&quot; and Robert MacBryde&#x27;s &quot;Figure and Still Life.&quot;

Under the Harold Wilson government of 1964–70 the Arts Council enjoyed a Golden Age thanks to the close relationship between chairman Arnold Goodman and the arts minister Jennie Lee. This period saw the council establish a network of arts organisations across the country as regular client organisations and a programme of touring exhibitions and performances. To support the council’s responsibilities in relation to the visual arts, it opened the Hayward Gallery on London&#x27;s South Bank in 1968 as a home for its major exhibitions and the base for the Arts Council Collection. Since 1987, the gallery has been independently managed by the South Bank Centre. In 2003 sculpture in the collection was moved to a base in Yorkshire.

During the 1970s and 1980s the Arts Council came under attack for being elitist and politically biased, in particular from the prominent Conservative Party minister Norman Tebbit. The government grant to the council was capped effecting a real-terms reduction in funding, though it was argued that any shortfall would be made up by increased sponsorship from the private sector. The secretary-general from 1975 to 1983, Roy Shaw, the last secretary-general to be knighted, faced the difficult task of reconciling the needs of arts organisations with the restricted funding. William Rees-Mogg was a political appointment as chairman and proposed slimming down the council&#x27;s responsibilities. This led to a series of clashes with prominent figures from the arts such as Peter Hall, who resigned from the council in protest. In 1987 the restructure inspired by Rees-Mogg cut by half the number of organisations receiving Arts Council funding. During the same period the Arts Council began encouraging a greater level of corporate sponsorship for the arts.

On 1 April 1994 it was replaced by the Arts Council of England, the Scottish Arts Council, and the Arts Council of Wales, each with their own new Royal Charter; the Arts Council of Northern Ireland already existed as a distinct body. At the same time, the National Lottery was established and the Arts Council of England became one of the distribution bodies. For the first year after the change in organisation, the Arts Council of England acted to follow through on the final plans of the Arts Council of Great Britain.

<doc id="428411" wikidata="Q11753" url="?curid=428411" title="Heinz Fischer">
<text>Heinz Fischer GColIH, OMRI, RSerafO, GCollSE (; born 9 October 1938) is an Austrian politician who served as the president of Austria from 2004 to 2016. Fischer previously served as minister of science from 1983 to 1987 and as president of the National Council of Austria from 1990 to 2002. A member of the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) until 2004, he suspended his party membership as he became president.

==Early life==
Fischer was born to a Jewish family in Graz, Styria, which had recently become part of Nazi Germany, following Germany&#x27;s annexation of Austria in March 1938. Fischer attended a grammar school which focused on humanities and graduated in 1956. He studied law at the University of Vienna, earning a doctorate in 1961. In 1963, at the age of 25, Fischer spent a year volunteering at Kibbutz Sarid, northern Israel. Apart from being a politician, Fischer also pursued an academic career, and became a professor of Political Science at the University of Innsbruck in 1994.

==Political career==

Fischer was a member of the Austrian parliament, the National Council, from 1971, and served as its president from 1990 to 2002. From 1983 to 1987 he was minister of science in a coalition government headed by Fred Sinowatz.

===First term as president===
In January 2004 Fischer announced that he would run for president to succeed Thomas Klestil. He was elected on 25 April 2004 as the candidate of the opposition Social Democratic Party. He polled 52.4 per cent of the votes to defeat Benita Ferrero-Waldner, then foreign minister in the ruling conservative coalition led by the People&#x27;s Party.

Fischer was sworn in on 8 July 2004 and took over office from the college of presidents of the National Council, who had acted for the president following Klestil&#x27;s death on 6 July.

===Second term as president=== 
 

In April 2010, Fischer was re-elected president of Austria, winning a second six-year term in office with almost 79% of the votes. The voter turnout of merely 53.6% was a record low. Around a third of those eligible to vote voted for Fischer, leading the conservative daily &quot;Die Presse&quot; to describe the election as an &quot;absolute majority for non-voters&quot;. The reasons behind the low turnout may have been that pollsters had predicted a safe victory for Fischer (past Austrian presidents running for a second term had always won) and that the other large party, ÖVP, had not nominated a candidate of their own, and had not endorsed any of the three candidates. Prominent ÖVP members, unofficially but in public, even suggested to cast a blank vote, which 7% of the voters did.

=== Post-presidency ===
In 2017, he and former UN secretary-general Ban-Ki Moon co-founded the Ban Ki-Moon Centre for Global Citizens, an international non-governmental organization to advance the Sustainable Development Goals, headquartered in Vienna.

==Personal life==
Fischer identifies himself as agnostic and as a social democrat. He and Margit Binder married in 1968. The couple have two grown children.

Despite being members of opposing parties, Fischer was close friends with former ÖVP politician Sixtus Lanner.

He enjoys mountaineering and has been president of the Austrian Friends of Nature for many years.

<text>Valgrind () is a programming tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling.

Valgrind was originally designed to be a freely licensed memory debugging tool for Linux on x86, but has since evolved to become a generic framework for creating dynamic analysis tools such as checkers and profilers.

==Overview==
Valgrind is in essence a virtual machine using just-in-time compilation techniques, including dynamic recompilation. Nothing from the original program ever gets run directly on the host processor. Instead, Valgrind first translates the program into a temporary, simpler form called intermediate representation (IR), which is a processor-neutral, static single assignment form-based form. After the conversion, a tool (see below) is free to do whatever transformations it would like on the IR, before Valgrind translates the IR back into machine code and lets the host processor run it. Valgrind recompiles binary code to run on host and target (or simulated) CPUs of the same architecture. It also includes a GDB stub to allow debugging of the target program as it runs in Valgrind, with &quot;monitor commands&quot; that allow querying the Valgrind tool for various information.

A considerable amount of performance is lost in these transformations (and usually, the code the tool inserts); usually, code run with Valgrind and the &quot;none&quot; tool (which does nothing to the IR) runs at 20% to 25% of the speed of the normal program.

==Tools==
===Memcheck===
There are multiple tools included with Valgrind (and several external ones). The default (and most used) tool is &quot;Memcheck&quot;. Memcheck inserts extra instrumentation code around almost all instructions, which keeps track of the &quot;validity&quot; (all unallocated memory starts as invalid or &quot;undefined&quot;, until it is initialized into a deterministic state, possibly from other memory) and &quot;addressability&quot; (whether the memory address in question points to an allocated, non-freed memory block), stored in the so-called &quot;V bits&quot; and &quot;A bits&quot; respectively. As data is moved around or manipulated, the instrumentation code keeps track of the A and V bits, so they are always correct on a single-bit level.

In addition, Memcheck replaces the standard C++ allocators and C memory allocator with its own implementation, which also includes &quot;memory guards&quot; around all allocated blocks (with the A bits set to &quot;invalid&quot;). This feature enables Memcheck to detect off-by-one errors where a program reads or writes outside an allocated block by a small amount. The problems Memcheck can detect and warn about include the following:
* Reading uninitialized memory
* Reading/writing invalid memory which may be
** memory that has been codice_1&#x27;d
** memory outside of codice_2&#x27;d blocks
** memory below the stack pointer
* Use of incorrect parameters for system calls
* Unsafe overlapping memory copies with codice_3 and codice_4 functions
* Memory leaks
* Mismatched allocations and deallocations which may be
** mixing C and C++ e.g., codice_2 and codice_6
** mixing scalar and array e.g., codice_7 and codice_8
** sized deallocation not the same size as allocation
** aligned deallocation not the same alignment as allocation
* Use of incorrect alignment
* Use of codice_9 with a size of zero

The price of this is lost performance. Programs running under Memcheck usually run 20–30 times slower than running outside Valgrind and use more memory (there is a memory penalty per allocation). Thus, few developers run their code under Memcheck (or any other Valgrind tool) all the time. They most commonly use such tools either to trace down some specific bug, or to verify that there are no latent bugs (of the kind Memcheck can detect) in the code.

===Other tools===
In addition to Memcheck, Valgrind has several other tools:
*&quot;None&quot;, runs the code in the virtual machine without performing any analysis and thus has the smallest possible CPU and memory overhead of all tools. Since Valgrind itself provides a trace back from a segmentation fault, the &quot;none&quot; tool provides this traceback at minimal overhead.
*&quot;Addrcheck&quot;, similar to Memcheck but with much smaller CPU and memory overhead, thus catching fewer types of bugs. Addrcheck has been removed as of version 3.2.0.
*&quot;Massif&quot;, a heap profiler. The separate GUI massif-visualizer visualizes output from Massif.
*&quot;Helgrind&quot; and &quot;DRD&quot;, detect race conditions in multithreaded code
*&quot;Cachegrind&quot;, a cache profiler. The separate GUI KCacheGrind visualizes output from Cachegrind.
*&quot;Callgrind&quot;, a call graph analyzer created by Josef Weidendorfer, added to Valgrind as of version 3.2.0. KCacheGrind can visualize output from Callgrind.
*&quot;DHAT&quot;, dynamic heap analysis tool which analyzes how much memory is allocated and for how long, as well as patterns of memory usage.
*&quot;exp-bbv&quot;, a performance simulator that extrapolates performance from a small sample set.
&quot;exp-sgcheck&quot; (named &quot;exp-ptrcheck&quot; prior to version 3.7), was removed in version 3.16.0. It was an experimental tool to find stack and global array overrun errors, which Memcheck cannot find.

There are also several externally developed tools available. One such tool is ThreadSanitizer, another detector of race conditions.

==Platforms supported==
As of version 3.4.0, Valgrind supports Linux on x86, x86-64 and PowerPC. Support for Linux on ARMv7 (used for example in certain smartphones) was added in version 3.6.0. Support for Solaris was added in version 3.11.0. Support for was added in version 3.5.0. Support for FreeBSD x86 and amd64 was added in version 3.18.0. Support for FreeBSD aarch64 was added in version 3.23.0. There are unofficial ports to other Unix-like platforms (like OpenBSD, NetBSD and QNX). From version 3.7.0 the ARM/Android platform support was added.

Since version 3.9.0 there is support for Linux on MIPS64 little and big endian, for MIPS DSP ASE on MIPS32, for s390x Decimal Floating Point instructions, for POWER8 (Power ISA 2.07) instructions, for Intel AVX2 instructions, for Intel Transactional Synchronization Extensions, both RTM and HLE and initial support for Hardware Transactional Memory on POWER.

== History and development ==

The name Valgrind is a reference to the main entrance of Valhalla from Norse mythology. During development (before release) the project was named Heimdall; however, the name would have conflicted with a security package.

The original author of Valgrind is Julian Seward, who in 2006 won a Google-O&#x27;Reilly Open Source Award for his work on Valgrind.

Several others have also made significant contributions, including Nicholas Nethercote, Bart Van Assche, Florian Krohm, Tom Hughes, Philippe Waroquiers, Mark Wielaard, Paul Floyd, Petar Jovanovic, Carl Love, Cerion Armour-Brown and Ivo Raisr.

It is used by a number of Linux-based projects.

==Limitations of Memcheck==
In addition to the performance penalty, an important limitation of Memcheck is its inability to detect all cases of bounds errors in the use of static or stack-allocated data. The following code will pass the &quot;Memcheck&quot; tool in Valgrind without incident, despite containing the errors described in the comments:
 int Static[5];
 int func(void)
 int Stack[5];
 Static[5] = 0; /* Error - Static[0] to Static[4] exist, Static[5] is out of bounds */
 Stack [5] = 0; /* Error - Stack[0] to Stack[4] exist, Stack[5] is out of bounds */
 return 0;


The inability to detect all errors involving the access of stack allocated data is especially noteworthy since
certain types of stack errors make software vulnerable to the classic
stack smashing exploit.

<text>Arts Council England is an arm&#x27;s length non-departmental public body of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. It is also a registered charity. It was formed in 1994 when the Arts Council of Great Britain was divided into three separate bodies for England, Scotland and Wales. The arts funding system in England underwent considerable reorganisation in 2002 when all of the regional arts boards were subsumed into Arts Council England and became regional offices of the national organisation.

Arts Council England is a government-funded body dedicated to promoting the performing, visual and literary arts in England. Since 1994, Arts Council England has been responsible for distributing lottery funding. This investment has helped to transform the building stock of arts organisations and to create many additional high-quality arts activities.

On 1 October 2011 the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council was subsumed into the Arts Council in England and they assumed the responsibilities of the council.

==History==
The Arts Council of Great Britain was created in 1946 by Royal Charter on the initiative of John Maynard Keynes. It received a revised charter in 1967. On 1 April 1994, it was divided to form the Arts Council of England, the Scottish Arts Council, and the Arts Council of Wales, each with their own new Royal Charter; the Arts Council of Northern Ireland already existed as a distinct body. At the same time, the National Lottery was established and the Arts Council of England became one of the distribution bodies. This increased responsibility saw the Arts Council of England grow back in size to the point where it was larger than before the 1987 restructuring.

In 2001 Chairman Gerry Robinson announced a further restructuring in which the Arts Council of England would be merged with the ten regional arts boards to form a single organisation: Arts Council England.

==Let&#x27;s Create==
In 2020, Arts Council England published &#x27;Let&#x27;s Create&#x27;, a new 10-year Strategy for the sectors within its remit.

&#x27;Let&#x27;s Create&#x27; includes a new vision statement, designed to inform Arts Council England&#x27;s work and priorities to 2030:

&quot;By 2030, we want England to be a country in which the creativity of each of us is valued and given the chance to flourish, and where every one of us has access to a remarkable range of high-quality cultural experiences.&quot;

The Strategy is structured around three outcomes:
* Creative People
* Cultural Communities
* A Creative and Cultural Country
Arts Council England has also set out 4 &#x27;investment principles&#x27;:
* Ambition and quality
* Dynamism
* Environmental responsibility
* Inclusivity and relevance
==Governance and administration==
Arts Council England has a national council of 15 members, including the chair. The national council meets ten times a year and is made up of representatives of the arts community with five of the members also representing the area councils. Each area council has a board of 15 members made up of representatives of their arts community and local government. There are five area councils:
* North
* Midlands 
* London
* South East 
* South West 

The chief executive of the Arts Council England is appointed by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. Alan Davey was chief executive from 2008 to 2014. He was succeeded by Darren Henley. Each area council has an executive director and each art form has a specialist advisor. The Arts Council England divides its funding into the following headings:
* Combined Art (Festivals)
* Dance
* Education

* Literature
* Music
* Research

* Theatre
* Touring
* Visual Arts
===Chairs of Arts Council England===
* Grey Gowrie (foundation–1998), 2nd Earl of Gowrie, former Arts Minister, poet and art dealer
* Sir Gerrard Robinson (1998–2004), businessman and executive
* Sir Christopher Frayling:(2004–February 2009); Rector of the Royal College of Art (London) 
* Dame Elizabeth Forgan (2009–2013); broadcaster and journalist
* Sir Peter Bazalgette (2013–2016); Executive Chairman of ITV plc
* Sir Nicholas Serota (2017–); former Director of the Tate

===Executive officers===
*Mary Allen: Secretary General, 1994 –1997

*Peter Hewitt: Chief Executive, 1997–2008

*Alan Davey: Chief Executive, 2008–2014

*Darren Henley Chief Executive, 2014 to present

== Funding programmes ==
Arts Council England is a distributor of a core funding programme, complemented by National Lottery funding.

=== Project Grants ===
National Lottery Project Grants is an open access programme for arts, libraries and museums projects. The fund supports thousands of individual practitioners, community and cultural organisations, distributing funds from the National Lottery. Grants awarded vary can be from £1,000 to £100,000. Project Grants is always open for new submissions.

=== Developing Your Creative Practice ===
Funding to support individuals who are cultural and creative practitioners and want to take time to focus on their creative development. Grants are awarded in rounds.

=== National Portfolio Organisations ===
Several hundred National Portfolio Organisations (NPO) and Investment Principles Support Organisations (IPSO) are allocated funding in multi-year tranches to support their on-going programmes.

=== Former funding programmes ===

==== Culture Recovery Fund ====
In 2020 it administered the Culture Recovery Fund to arts venues and organisations in England affected by the COVID-19 pandemic

==== Arts Capital Lottery ====
From 1994 it oversaw a national capital fund with grants for new buildings, public art and the renovation of existing arts buildings. The story of the Capital programme is told by Prue Skene who chaired the Lottery Panel, in &quot;Capital Gains: how the national lottery transformed England&#x27;s arts&quot;.

==Museums==
Arts Council England supports a limited number of museums as Major Partnership Museums: 16 single museums or consortia were supported 2012–2015, and a further five were added for 2015–2018, bringing the total to 21. Arts Council England also supports other museums via &quot;Strategic Funds.&quot;

The council also runs the Designation Scheme for collections in libraries or museums of national or international importance, and is the English partner in the UK Museum Accreditation Scheme.

==Litigation==
In 2023, a gender critical woman, Denise Fahmy, won a harassment claim against the Council at an employment tribunal, which ruled that hostile comments about her beliefs at an internal meeting (which followed the Arts Council funded organisation London Community Foundation granting and then suspending a grant to LGB Alliance), and other activity afterward, constituted &quot;an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment&quot; for employees with such protected beliefs.

==Criticism==
The Council attracted criticism from the Parliamentary select committee responsible for its oversight for supporting a lottery-funded programme to subsidise UK film production that resulted in a series of films that failed to find distribution. There was also a series of costly capital projects such as the Royal Opera House and the Lowry Centre that required additional funding. In the case of the Royal Opera House the select committee found the Arts Council had broken its own procedures. In 2005 it was announced that the Arts Council England&#x27;s budget was capped resulting in an effective £30m reduction in its budget.

In March 2006, the Arts Council announced a review of its National Office that would &quot;enhance efficiency and delivery while continuing to provide respected and focused arts leadership and drive&quot;, while proposing to lose 42 posts, mainly arts specialists, so that the organisation will no longer have dedicated national leads for areas including contemporary music, interdisciplinary art, moving image, architecture, broadcasting, opera, social inclusion, and disability.

Arts Council England&#x27;s music policy was controversial within the jazz world. Chris Hodgkins, in his 1998 paper &quot;Jazz in the UK&quot;, pointed out that more than 90% of its music budget went on opera while jazz, with an equivalent audience size, received less than 1%. The funding landscape has improved since with funding for NWJazzworks and Manchester Jazz Festival 2012. Among other areas funding has diversified into youth music such as National Youth Choirs of Great Britain, National Youth Jazz Collective and South Asian Music Youth Orchestra (SAMYO) etc. On 11 May 2006 it was raised in the House of Lords by Lord Colwyn, as documented in the Lords Hansard Columns (1058 to 1060).

In May 2015 the Board of Deputies of British Jews released a statement objecting to Arts Council England&#x27;s funding of &quot;The Siege&quot;. The Palestinian play depicts a 2002 incident where armed Hamas fighters sought refuge in Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. A 39-day siege ensued, and eight of the Hamas troops were killed by Israeli snipers, before the remaining forces surrendered.

The English Touring Opera attributed its firing of white musicians in 2021 to &quot;firm guidance&quot; from the Arts Council.

<text>Splint, short for Secure Programming Lint, is a programming tool for statically checking C programs for security vulnerabilities and coding mistakes. Formerly called LCLint, it is a modern version of the Unix lint tool.

Splint has the ability to interpret special annotations to the source code, which gives it stronger checking than is possible just by looking at the source alone. Splint is used by gpsd as part of an effort to design for zero defects.

Splint is free software released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

Main development activity on Splint stopped in 2010. According to the CVS at SourceForge, as of September 2012 the most recent change in the repository was in November 2010. A Git repository at GitHub has more recent changes, starting in July 2019.

==Example==

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main()
 char c;
 while (c != &#x27;x&#x27;);
 c = getchar();
 if (c = &#x27;x&#x27;)
 return 0;
 switch (c) {
 case &#x27;\n&#x27;:
 case &#x27;\r&#x27;:
 printf(&quot;Newline\n&quot;);
 default:
 printf(&quot;%c&quot;,c);
 }
 return 0;


Splint&#x27;s output:
Fixed source:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main()
 int c = 0; // Added an initial assignment definition.

 while (c != &#x27;x&#x27;) {
 c = getchar(); // Corrected type of c to int
 if (c == &#x27;x&#x27;) // Fixed the assignment error to make it a comparison operator.
 return 0;
 switch (c) {
 case &#x27;\n&#x27;:
 case &#x27;\r&#x27;:
 printf(&quot;Newline\n&quot;);
 break; // Added break statement to prevent fall-through.
 default:
 printf(&quot;%c&quot;,c);
 break; //Added break statement to default catch, out of good practice.
 }
 return 0;

<doc id="428422" wikidata="Q190915" url="?curid=428422" title="Low-cost carrier">
<text>A low-cost carrier (LCC) or low-cost airline, also called a budget, or discount carrier or airline, is an airline that is operated with an emphasis on minimizing operating costs. It sacrifices certain traditional airline luxuries for cheaper fares. To make up for revenue lost in decreased ticket prices, the airline may charge extra fees, such as for carry-on baggage.

The term originated within the airline industry referring to airlines with a lower operating cost structure than their competitors. The term is often applied to any carrier with low ticket prices and limited services regardless of their operating models. Low-cost carriers should not be confused with regional airlines that operate short-haul flights without service, or with full-service airlines offering some reduced fares.

Some airlines advertise themselves as low-cost while maintaining products usually associated with traditional mainline carriers’ services. These products include preferred or assigned seating, catering, differentiated premium cabins, satellite or ground-based Wi-Fi internet, and in-flight audio and video entertainment. The term ultra low-cost carrier (ULCC) has been used, particularly in North America and Europe to refer to carriers that do not provide these services and amenities.

==Business model==

The low-cost carrier business model practices vary widely. Some practices are more common in certain regions, while others are generally universal. The common theme among all low-cost carriers is the reduction of cost and reduced overall fares compared to legacy carriers.

Traditional airlines have also reduced their cost using several of these practices.

===Common practices===

====Aircraft====
While some low-cost carriers choose to operate more than one type of aircraft and configure their aircraft with more than one passenger class, most operate aircraft configured in a single class, as well as utilizing just a single aircraft type. In this way, cabin and ground crew only have to be trained to work on one type of aircraft. This is also beneficial from a maintenance standpoint as spare parts and mechanics will only be dedicated to one type of aircraft. These airlines tend to operate short-haul flights that suit the range of narrow-body (single aisle) planes. As of lately, however, there is also a rise in demand for long range low-cost flights and the availability of next generation planes that make long haul routes more feasible for LCCs.

In the past, low-cost carriers tended to operate older aircraft purchased second-hand, such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and older models of the Boeing 737. Since 2000, fleets generally consist of the newest aircraft, commonly the Airbus A320 family and Boeing 737. Although buying new aircraft is usually more expensive than second-hand, new planes are cheaper to operate in the long run since they are extremely efficient in terms of fuel, training, maintenance, and crew costs per passenger.

In 2013, ch-aviation published a study about the fleet strategy of low-cost carriers. They stated that major LCCs that order aircraft in large numbers get large discounts for doing so, and due to this they can sell their aircraft just a few years after delivery at a price high enough to keep their operating costs relatively low.

Aircraft often operate with a minimum set of equipment, further reducing costs of acquisition and maintenance, as well as keeping the weight of the aircraft lower and thus saving fuel. Depending on the low-cost airline seats do not recline and do not have rear pockets, to reduce cleaning and maintenance costs. Others have no window shades. Pilot conveniences, such as ACARS, may be excluded. Often, no in-flight entertainment systems are made available, though many US low-cost carriers do offer satellite television or radio in-flight. It is also becoming a popular approach to install LCD monitors onto the aircraft and broadcast advertisements on them, coupled with the traditional route–altitude–speed information. Some allow priority boarding for an extra fee instead of reserved seating, and some allow reserving a seat in an emergency exit row (for longer leg room) at an extra cost.

====Bases====
Like the major carriers, many low-cost carriers develop one or more bases to maximize destination coverage and defend their market. Many do not operate traditional hubs, but rather focus cities.

====Simplicity====

Airlines often offer a simpler fare scheme, such as selling only one-way tickets. Typically fares increase as the plane fills up, which rewards early reservations. 
In Europe (and early in Southwest&#x27;s history) luggage is not transferred from one flight to another, even if both flights are with the same airline. This saves costs and is thought to encourage passengers to take direct flights. Tickets are not sold with transfers, so the airline can avoid responsibility for passengers&#x27; connections in the event of a delay. Low-cost carriers often have a sparse schedule with one flight per day and route, so it would be hard to find an alternative for a missed connection. Modern US-based low-cost carriers generally transfer baggage for continuing flights, as well as transferring baggage to other airlines. Many airlines opt to have passengers board via stairs, since jetways generally cost more to lease.

Often, low-cost carriers fly to smaller, less congested secondary airports and/or fly to airports during off-peak hours to avoid air traffic delays and take advantage of lower landing fees. This is why Ryanair flies to Gatwick Airport, Luton Airport, and Stansted Airport in the London area and how easyJet is able to fly to Paris-Charles de Gaulle, and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. In London&#x27;s case however, low-cost carriers would not be able to use Heathrow as the airport is running at near capacity, so there is no room to build a base. The airlines tend to offload, service and re-load the aircraft (turnaround) in shorter time periods and do not wait for late passengers, allowing maximum utilization of aircraft.

====Non-flight revenue====
Low-cost carriers generate ancillary revenue from a variety of activities, such as à la carte features and commission-based products. Some airlines may charge a fee for a pillow or blanket or for carry-on baggage. In Europe, it is common for each and every convenience and service to have an additional charge. 
====Limit personnel costs====

Low-cost carriers intend to be low-cost, so in many cases employees work multiple roles. At some airlines flight attendants also work as gate agents or assume other roles, thereby limiting personnel costs. Southwest Airlines is well known for using fuel hedging programs to reduce its overall fuel costs. Check-in at the gate of luggage requires fees, as it requires addition to the weight calculation and last-minute baggage handling.

Online check-in is becoming common, again in the interest of avoiding personnel costs.

Where permissible, some airlines have a disinclination to handle Special Service passengers, for instance by placing a higher age limit on unaccompanied minors than full-service carriers. Often these airlines do not offer connecting tickets, since the airline will have to pay for ground crew to transfer luggage. A customer may create a connection manually by purchasing two separate tickets, but these are considered separate contracts, and the passenger bears the risk if a delayed inbound flight causes a missed connection.

When most countries had national monopolies, crews could negotiate pay raises and good pension benefits (something that costs money for the airlines only in the long term). During this period, most passengers were business travellers who paid high fares that covered these costs. After deregulation, which led to lower fares, many airlines remained bound to these salary agreements and pensions, whereas new low-cost carriers employed new staff with lower salaries, especially for cabin crew, keeping personnel costs low and allowing for competitive fares. In some cases airlines have gone bankrupt (e.g., Alitalia, Sabena, and Swissair), and new airlines replaced them.

Traditional carriers followed the low-cost carriers by enabling web check-in, encouraging machine check-in at the airport, and generally reducing ground personnel cost. 

The number of crew members follow international conventions that require one flight attendant per 50 passenger seats and two pilots. However, carriers can save money by reducing the amount of ground crew.

Carriers hire pilots through third-party agencies based in low-tax countries without benefits for sick pay, pensions or health insurance. Traditional carriers have also started to try this, including starting their own low-tax agencies. These agencies can easily find less experienced co-pilots and cabin crew, as the profession is popular, but there are problems for low-cost carriers to recruit and keep captains who have to be experienced.

====Principles of operation====

At IATA, a LCC operation is defined as including the following characteristics, at least to some degree:
* Primarily point-to-point operations
* Short-haul routes, often between regional or secondary airports
* Strong focus on price-sensitive traffic, mostly leisure passengers
* Typically a single service class, with no (or limited) customer loyalty programmes
* Limited passenger services, with additional charges for some services (e.g., on-board catering)
* Low average fares, with a strong focus on price competition
* Different fares offered, related to aircraft load factors and length of time before departure
* A very high proportion of bookings made through the Internet
* High aircraft utilisation rates, with short turnaround between operations
* A fleet of just one or two aircraft types
* Private-sector companies
* A simple management and overhead structure with a lean strategic decision-making process

While low-cost airlines differ in service offerings, by definition they feature most of the following:
* Standardized fleet (which lowers the cost of training and maintenance)
* Absent non-essential features (reclining seats, frequent flyer schemes)
* Use of secondary airports for lower landing fees and marketing support
* Avoidance of airports with high costs
* Rapid turnaround (less time on the ground, more flights per day)
* Fly at less desirable times (red-eye flights) of the day, which price sensitive tourists accept
* Online ticket sales to avoid the cost of call centres or agents
* Online check-in (fewer check-in desks), charge for desk check-in
* Baggage charges for checked bags to offset baggage handling and loading costs
* Use staff for multiple jobs (for example, check-in desk agents loading bags or cabin crew checking tickets at the gate)
* Hedge fuel costs (buying fuel in advance when cheaper)
* Charge for all services (including on-board services, reserved seating, and extra baggage)
* Do not use reserved seating (which slows down boarding), or charge extra for reserved seating or early boarding.
* Fly point-to-point (passenger transfers to other flights are not accommodated, no compensation for missed connections)
* Carry little extra fuel (reducing aircraft weight)
* Outfit plane with fuel-saving modifications, such as winglets
* Route planning before aircraft arrives at airport (saving time on the ground)
* Market destination services such as hotels and rental cars for commissions
* Cabin panels decorated with advertisements

===Differentiation===
Not every low-cost carrier implements all of the above points. For example, some try to differentiate themselves with allocated seating, while others operate more than one aircraft type, still others have relatively high operating costs but lower fares. JetBlue, for instance, has in-flight entertainment in every passenger seat. Other airlines are limited on what points they can implement based on local laws. For example, Irish low cost airlines cannot remove window blinds from its aircraft, as they are required by the Irish Aviation Authority. As supply increases, this sort of differentiation by brand is an important criteria for the future success of low-cost carriers, since many experts believe price competition alone is not enough, given the number of carriers.

As the number of low-cost carriers has grown, these airlines have begun to compete with one another in addition to the traditional carriers. In the US, airlines have responded by introducing variations to the model. In Europe, the emphasis has remained on reducing costs and no-frills service.

===Ultra low-cost carrier===
A secondary term ultra low-cost carrier (ULCC) has been used to differentiate some low-cost airlines whose model deviates further from that of a standard low-cost carrier, with ultra low-cost carriers having minimal inclusions in the fare and a greater number of add-on fees. 

In the US market, Allegiant Air, Avelo Airlines, Frontier Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and Sun Country Airlines are considered to be ULCCs. 

In Europe, Ryanair and Wizz Air are the most prominent ULCCs.

In Asia, AirAsia and Lion Air are the most prominent ULCCs.

===Pricing policy===
The pricing policy of the low-cost carriers is usually very dynamic as befits their business model, with frequent discounts and tickets in promotion. Like other carriers, however, even if the advertised base prices are very low, charges and taxes are typically not mentioned. With some airlines, some flights are advertised as free (plus applicable taxes, fees and charges). Depending on the airline, perhaps as many (or as few) as ten percent of the seats on any flight are offered at the lowest price and are the first to sell. The prices steadily rise thereafter to a point where they can be comparable or more expensive than a flight on a full-service carrier.

Most airlines charge additional taxes and fees on their tickets. Some low-cost airlines have been known to charge fees for the seemingly ridiculous, such as levying a credit card charge if credit card is the only payment method accepted.

==History==
While tour and package operators have offered lower-priced, lower-frilled traveling for a large part of modern airline history, not until during the post–Vietnam War era did this business model escalate. Through various ticket consolidators, charter airlines, and innovators in lower-frills flying, such as Channel Airways and Court Line, the traveling public had been conditioned to want to travel to new and increasingly further away and exotic locations on vacation, rather than short-haul trips to nearby beach resorts.

The world&#x27;s first low-cost airline was Pacific Southwest Airlines, which started intrastate flights connecting Southern and Northern California on 6 May 1949. PSA&#x27;s light-hearted atmosphere and efficient operations were a runaway success early on, and inspired a number of low-cost start-ups across the United States, beginning in the mid-1960s. Herb Kelleher studied the success of PSA, and copied their culture closely when he established Southwest Airlines in 1971.

The first airline to offer cheaper transatlantic fares was Icelandic airline Loftleiðir in 1964, often referred to as &quot;the Hippie Airline&quot;. Many young Americans travelled to Europe after graduation, to experience the &quot;old-world culture&quot;, and they were more concerned with getting there cheaply than comfortably or even exactly on time. Loftleiðir were not famous for speed or punctuality, but flying with the company became a sort of rite of passage for those young &quot;hippies&quot;, one of whom was Bill Clinton, later US President.
The first airline offering no-frills transatlantic service was Freddie Laker&#x27;s Laker Airways, which operated its famous &quot;Skytrain&quot; service between London and New York City during the late 1970s. The service was suspended after Laker&#x27;s competitors, British Airways and Pan Am, were able to price Skytrain out of the market.

In the United States, airline carriers such as Midway Airlines and America West Airlines, which commenced operations after 1978, soon realized a cost of available seat mile (CASM) advantage in relation to the traditional and established, legacy airlines such as Trans World Airlines and American Airlines. Often this CASM advantage has been attributed solely to the lower labor costs of the newly hired and lower pay grade workers of new start-up carriers, such as ValuJet, Midway Airlines, and their like. However, these lower costs can also be attributed to the less complex aircraft fleets and route networks with which these new carriers began operations, in addition to their reduced labor costs.

To combat the new round of low-cost and start-up entrants into the very competitive and deregulated United States airline industry, the mainline major carriers and network legacy carriers strategically developed no-frills divisions within the main airlines brand and corporate structures. Among these were Continental Lite, Delta Express, MetroJet, Shuttle by United, Song, and Ted. However, most of these &quot;airlines within an airline&quot; were short-lived and quickly disposed-of when economic rationalization or competitive pressures subsided.

Taking a page from the mainline, major, or legacy carriers&#x27; desire to reduce costs in all ways possible in regards regional route networks by outsourcing regional operations to the lowest expense airline bidder capable of operating regional aircraft, a new generation of low-cost airlines (in name only) soon evolved in the US with varying levels of success. Among these varieties of low-cost and discount operators were noteworthy starts-ups that managed to get off the ground by using the larger aircraft services of established charter airlines. Among this group were the virtual airlines; Direct Air, PeoplExpress, Western, and those that never began service such as JetAmerica.

In Japan, low-cost airlines made major inroads into the market in 2012 when Peach, Jetstar Japan and AirAsia Japan began operations, each with financial sponsorship by a domestic legacy airline and one or more foreign investors. By mid-2013, these new LCCs were operating at a unit cost of around 8 yen per seat-kilometer, compared to 10–11 yen per seat-kilometer for domestic legacy airlines. However, their unit cost was still much higher than the 3 yen per seat-kilometer for AirAsia in Malaysia, due to the higher cost of landing fees and personnel in Japan.

===Market share===

By 2017, low-cost carriers had achieved market share of 57.2% in South Asia and 52.6% in Southeast Asia. Market share remained somewhat lower in Europe at 37.9% and North America at 32.7%.

For the European Commission, the LCCs market share (44.8%) exceeded legacy carriers (42.4%) in 2012: between 2002 and 2017, LCC share of international seat capacity rose from 23% to 57% in the UK, from 10% to 55% in Italy and from 9% to 56% in Spain but have still room for growth in domestic seat-capacity In France with 19% and in Germany with 25% in 2017, compared with 66% in the UK, 48% in Spain and 47% in Italy.

By early 2019, there were more than 100 LCCs operating 6,000 aircraft, doubled from 2,900 aircraft at the end of 2009, while seat capacity reached nearly 1.7 billion in 2018.
LCCs accounted for 33% of intra-regional seat capacity in 2018 with 1.564 billion, up from 25% in 2008 with 753 million, and 13% of seat capacity between regions with 101 million, up from 6% in 2009 with 26 million.
In 2018, penetration rate was 41% of seats within Europe, 36% within Latin America, 32% within North America, 29% within Asia Pacific, 17% within the Middle East and 12% within Africa.
===Long-haul low-cost===

A long-haul low-cost operation would be harder to differentiate from a conventional airline as there are few cost savings possibilities, while the seat costs would have to be lower than the competition. Long-haul aircraft scheduling is often determined by time zone constraints, like leaving the US East Coast in the evening and arriving in Europe the following morning, and the longer flight times mean there is less scope to increase aircraft utilization as in short-haul. The business model is financially risky, and many companies have entered bankruptcy, like Laker Airways.

====History====
In 2004, Irish Aer Lingus maintains a full service on transatlantic flights while it lowered its prices to compete with Ryanair on short haul.
Late in 2004, Oasis Hong Kong Airlines offered London to Hong Kong flights from £199, and Canadian Zoom Airlines started selling transatlantic flights between the UK and Canada for £89. In August 2006, Zoom announced a UK subsidiary to offer low-cost long-haul flights to the United States and India, but suspended its operations from 28 August 2008 due to high fuel prices inducing financial problems.
In 2005, Emirates&#x27; Tim Clark viewed long-haul low-cost as inevitable, flights could be operated on 760 seats all-economy Airbus A380s, or 870 for an hypothetical A380 stretch.
Since 2005, Australia&#x27;s Jetstar Airways operates international flights, starting with Christchurch, New Zealand. In late 2006, others followed from Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, to popular tourist destinations within 10 hours like Honolulu, Japan, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia. With new aircraft deliveries, it hopes to fly to the continental US and Europe.

In April 2006, the industry magazine &quot;Airline Business&quot; analysed the potential for low-cost long-haul service and concluded that a number of Asian carriers, including AirAsia, were closest to making such a model work.
On 26 October 2006, Oasis Hong Kong Airlines started flying from Hong Kong to London-Gatwick. The lowest prices for flights between Hong Kong to London could be as low at £75 (approximately US$150) per leg (not including taxes and other charges) for economy class and £470 (approximately US$940) per leg for business class for the same route. From 28 June 2007, a second long-haul route to Vancouver, British Columbia, was started. The company ceased operations on 9 April 2008, after over a billion Hong Kong dollars in losses.
On 2 November 2007, AirAsia X, a subsidiary of AirAsia and Virgin Group flew its inaugural flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Gold Coast, Australia. AirAsia X claims that it is the first true low-cost long-haul carrier since the end of Skytrain.
In late 2007, Cebu Pacific, the Philippines&#x27; largest low-cost carrier, announced non-stop flights from the Philippines to the United States West Coast and other US cities from mid-2009. The airline also intends to launch low-cost service to Middle East, where around a million Filipinos are based, and in Europe. Flights to Dubai — its first long-haul destination — started in 2013. As of September 2024, it operates flights to Dubai daily, to Sydney four times a week, and Melbourne thrice weekly.
On 11 March 2009, AirAsia X started its first low-cost long-haul service into Europe, to London Stansted. The daily flights are operated by two leased Airbus A340-300s. A one-way economy-class ticket often costs £150, and the premium-class one-way often costs £350. On 12 January 2012, AirAsia announced that it would be suspending services to London on 1 April 2012.
Low-cost European airline, Norwegian Air Shuttle, started long-haul low-cost operations in May 2013 under their Norwegian Long Haul arm. Norwegian initially operated flights to Bangkok and New York from Scandinavia using leased Airbus A340 aircraft, switching to new Boeing 787s in the second half of 2013 after Boeing resumed deliveries following extensive problems and delays. It served direct routes from the United States (Los Angeles, Fort Lauderdale, New York City, Oakland-San Francisco, Boston and Orlando) into Scandinavia (Oslo, Stockholm, Copenhagen). In January 2021 Norwegian announced the immediate cessation of their long-haul operations, along with a large-scale reduction of its fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft and operations.
In March 2017, International Airlines Group established Level, a long-haul low-cost virtual airline based in Barcelona Airport and serving destinations in North and South America.
Long-haul low-cost carriers are emerging on the transatlantic flights market with 545,000 seats offered over 60 city pairs in September 2017 (a 66% growth over one year), compared to 652,000 seats over 96 pairs for Leisure airlines and 8,798,000 seats over 357 pairs for mainline carriers.
Former American Airlines CEO Bob Crandall thinks the legacy carriers will force Long-haul LCCS to lose too much money and will continue to dominate.
While Asian carriers like AirAsia X, Scoot, Cebu Pacific and Jetstar Airways are successful, the October 2018 demise of Primera Air and its $99 transatlantic flights illustrates the difficulties of the model, as the US World Airways will be relaunched in 2019.
Norse Atlantic Airways was founded in 2021 and commenced operations in 2022, operating transatlantic flights as well as flights to Thailand beginning in 2023.

In June 2024, HiSky started long haul operations between Bucharest-Otopeni to New York JFK.

===Low-cost business-only carriers===
A trend from the mid-2000s was the formation of new low-cost carriers exclusively targeting the long-haul business market. Aircraft are generally configured for a single class of service, initially on transatlantic routings.

Similarly, Midwest Express (later Midwest Airlines) which operated from 1984 until it was absorbed into Frontier Airlines in 2010, and Legend Airlines which ceased operations in late 2000 were also founded on this operating model.

Probably best described as &quot;fewer frills&quot; rather than &quot;no frills&quot;, the initial entrants in this market utilized second-hand, mid-sized, twin jets, such as Boeing 757 and Boeing 767, in an attempt to service the lucrative London-US Eastern Seaboard market:
* Eos Airlines, which ceased operating on 27 April 2008
* MAXjet, which ceased its scheduled business flights in December 2007 and was unable to transition to charter as planned.
* Silverjet, which ceased operations on 30 May 2008.
* La Compagnie

==Criticism==
Some elements of the low-cost model have been subject to criticism by governments and regulators; and in the UK in particular, the issue of &quot;unbundling&quot; of ancillary charges by both low-cost carriers and other airlines (showing airport fees or taxes as separate charges rather than as part of the advertised fare) to make the &quot;headline fare&quot; appear lower has resulted in enforcement action. Considering that this amounts to a misleading approach to pricing, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in February 2007 gave all carriers and travel companies three months to include all fixed non-optional costs in their basic advertised prices. Although the full-service carriers had complied within the specified timescales, the low-cost carriers have been less compliant in this respect, leading to the prospect of legal action by the OFT.

Some destination cities lie relatively far from the airports that low-cost airlines use to save costs. Examples of this are Hahn, Weeze and Girona airports—which low-cost airlines advertise as the destinations for Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, and Barcelona, respectively—even though these airports are 50 to 90 kilometres away. This has drawn criticism, mostly from competing airlines that fly closer to the destinations.

IAG CEO Willie Walsh found established airlines arrogant facing the LCC model. For instance, Aer Lingus turned down the opportunity to buy Ryanair for &quot;£&quot;29 million Irish pounds (€ million). The company further stated that it would not have developed Ryanair and instead would have shut it down.

<text>Catallactics is a theory of the way the free market system reaches exchange ratios and prices. It aims to analyse all actions based on monetary calculation and trace the formation of prices back to the point where an agent makes his or her choices. It explains prices as they are, rather than as they &quot;should&quot; be. The laws of catallactics are not value judgments, but aim to be exact, empirical, and of universal validity. It was used extensively by the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises.

==Etymology==
The term catallactics or catallaxy, respectively, comes from the Greek verb which means &quot;to exchange, to reconcile&quot;.

==Definition==
Catallactics is a praxeological theory. The term catallaxy was used by Friedrich Hayek to describe &quot;the order brought about by the mutual adjustment of many individual economies in a market.&quot; Hayek was dissatisfied with the usage of the word &quot;economy&quot; because its Greek root, which translates as &quot;household management&quot;, implies that economic agents in a market economy possess shared goals. He derived the word &quot;Catallaxy&quot; (Hayek&#x27;s suggested Greek construction would be rendered καταλλαξία) from the Greek verb &quot;katallasso&quot; (καταλλάσσω) which meant not only &quot;to exchange&quot; but also &quot;to admit in the community&quot; and &quot;to change from enemy into friend.&quot;

According to Mises and Hayek it was Richard Whately who coined the term &quot;catallactics&quot;. Whately&#x27;s &quot;Introductory Lectures on Political Economy&quot; (1831) reads:

<text>The 75th Ranger Regiment, also known as the [[United States Army Rangers|Army Rangers]], is the premier light infantry and direct-action raid force of the United States Army Special Operations Command. The 75th Ranger Regiment is also part of Joint Special Operations Command via the Regimental Reconnaissance Company (RRC). The regiment is headquartered at Fort Moore, Georgia, and is composed of a regimental headquarters company, a military intelligence battalion, a special troops battalion, and three Ranger battalions.

The 75th Ranger Regiment primarily handles direct action raids in hostile or sensitive environments, often killing or capturing high-value targets. Other missions include airfield seizure, special reconnaissance, personnel recovery, clandestine insertion, and site exploitation. The regiment can deploy one Ranger battalion within eighteen hours of alert notification.

The 75th Ranger Regiment is one of the U.S. military&#x27;s most extensively used units. On 17 December 2020, it marked 7,000 consecutive days of combat operations.

==History==
===Origin===

American Ranger history predates the American Revolutionary War. Captain Benjamin Church formed Church&#x27;s Rangers, which fought hostile Native American tribes during King Philip&#x27;s War. In 1756, Robert Rogers recruited nine Ranger companies to fight in the French and Indian War. They were known as &quot;Rogers&#x27; Rangers&quot;. The 75th Regiment&#x27;s history dates back to these rifle companies organized by Rogers, which made long-range attacks against French forces and their native allies, and were instrumental in capturing Fort Detroit.

During the American Revolutionary War, Rogers served as a Loyalist officer on the side of the Crown and many of his former Rangers served on both sides. One, John Stark, commanded the 1st New Hampshire Regiment, which gained fame at the Battles of Bunker Hill and Bennington. Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain Boys in Vermont were also designated as a ranger unit. In 1775, the Continental Congress later formed eight companies of expert riflemen to fight in the Revolutionary War. In 1777, this force commanded by Daniel Morgan, was known as The Corps of Rangers. Francis Marion, &quot;The Swamp Fox&quot;, organized another famous Revolutionary War Ranger element known as &quot;Marion&#x27;s Partisans&quot;. Perhaps the most famous Ranger unit in the Revolutionary War was Butler&#x27;s Rangers, from upstate New York.

During the War of 1812, companies of United States Rangers were raised from among the frontier settlers as part of the regular army. Throughout the war, they patrolled the frontier from Ohio to Western Illinois on horseback and by boat. Rangers participated in many skirmishes and battles with the British and their American Indian allies. Various military Ranger units such as the United States Mounted Rangers, United States Rangers, Loudoun Rangers, 43rd Virginia Rangers, and Texas Military Rangers continued until the modern formation of the Army Ranger Battalions in World War II.

===World War II battalions===

====1st Ranger Battalion====
Soon after the United States entered World War II in 1941, General George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, envisioned an elite unit of fifty men selected voluntarily from the 34th Infantry Division. To create and lead this new unit, Marshall picked Major William Orlando Darby, who was serving as General Russell P. Hartle&#x27;s aide in Belfast, Northern Ireland, where he was frustrated with his lack of hands-on experience. On 8 June 1942, Darby—now known as the founder of the modern Rangers—was put in charge of the 1st Ranger Battalion under General Hartle.

On 19 August 1942, fifty Rangers fought alongside Canadian and British Commandos in the ill-fated Dieppe Raid on the coast of occupied France. Three Rangers were killed and several were captured. The first American soldier killed in Europe in World War II, Ranger Lieutenant E. V. Loustalot, was part of this raid. During the mission, Loustalot took command after the British captain leading the assault was killed. While attempting to reach a machine gun nest at the top of a cliff, he was wounded three times by enemy fire and killed.

In November 1942, the entire 1st Ranger Battalion entered combat for the first time when they landed at Arzew, Algeria during Operation Torch. The 1st were split into two groups in hopes of assaulting Vichy-French batteries and fortifications before the 1st Infantry Division would land on the beach. The operation was successful, and the unit sustained minimal casualties.

On 11 February 1943, the Rangers moved to raid an Italian encampment at Sened Station. Moving at night, the Rangers slipped to within of the Italian outpost and began their attack. It took the battalion only 20 minutes to overtake the garrison and achieve their objective. Seventy-five Italians were killed and eleven were taken prisoner. Darby, along with four other officers and nine enlisted, was awarded the Silver Star Medal for this action. The battalion itself gained the nickname the &quot;Black Death&quot; by the Italians.

At the time, the Italians still held the pass at Djebel El Ank, located at the far east edge of El Guettar. The Rangers linked up with engineers elements of the 26th Infantry, 1st Infantry Division, to attack the area in preparation for the Battle of El Guettar. The 1st Rangers orders were to move overland, on foot to outflank the enemy&#x27;s position. In eight hours of fighting, the Americans captured the objective; the 1st Rangers took 200 prisoners.

====Creation of 3rd and 4th Ranger Battalions====
With the success of the 1st Ranger Battalion during the Tunisian campaign, Darby requested that the Rangers be expanded to a full Regiment. The request was granted. The 3rd and 4th Ranger Battalions were authorized shortly after and were trained and led by veteran officers and NCOs from the 1st Battalion. After getting the &quot;green light&quot; to expand, Darby ran into a problem: the Rangers only took volunteers. Darby, knowing that the best man for the job was not always a volunteer, sought out men around Oran. Although he was still limited in that he could only accept volunteers, he began to find ways around this. For instance, he began to give speeches, put up posters, and encourage his officers to scout around for eligible candidates. By June 1943, the three Ranger battalions were fully operational. 1st Rangers were still under Colonel Darby; the 3rd Rangers under Major Herman Dammer, and the 4th Rangers commanded by Major Roy Murray.

1st and 4th Ranger Battalions were paired together and placed with General Terry Allen&#x27;s 1st Division to spearhead the American landings of the Sicily campaign. Landing outside Gela, the Rangers took the town just after midnight, starting off the Battle of Gela. They held Gela, enduring 50 hours of constant attack by enemy artillery, tank, and air forces.

Following their success, the two Ranger battalions were then ordered to take the town of Butera, a fortress suspended on the high edge of the cliff at Butera beach. After almost withdrawing from the battle, and requesting artillery to level the city, a platoon of Rangers volunteered to breach its defenses. Two privates, John See and John Constantine, sneaked in behind enemy lines and tricked the Italians and Germans into surrendering the city.

Meanwhile, the 3rd Ranger Battalion headed out into the area of Agrigento, where they marched through Campobello, Naro, and Favara, successfully occupying each town. The 3rd then took the town of Porto Empedocle.

Colonel Darby was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and was promoted by General George Patton; however, Darby, wanting to be closer to his men, turned down this promotion.

====Fall of 1st, 3rd and 4th Battalions====

After a break for Christmas 1943, the Rangers were put together for a joint effort to occupy the town of Cisterna before the main infantry division moved in. On the night of 30 January 1944, the 1st and 3rd battalions moved into the town, passing many German soldiers who did not appear to notice the Rangers slip by. The 4th Ranger Battalion, which approached the town from the opposite end, met opposition almost immediately on the road. During the night, the 1st and 3rd Ranger battalions separated by about , and when daylight caught the 1st Ranger Battalion out in an open field, the Germans began their ambush. Surrounded and unable to escape, the two Ranger battalions fought on until they exhausted their ammunition and resources. The 4th Ranger Battalion pushed to save their comrades but were forced to withdraw. After five hours of fighting, the Rangers surrendered to the German armor and mechanized infantry. The two battalions sustained 12 killed, 36 wounded, and 743 captured—only eight were able to escape. The 4th Battalion suffered 30 killed and 58 wounded.

This marked the end of the three Ranger battalions. The remaining 400 Rangers were scattered around the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, and the 137 original Rangers were sent home. 1st and 3rd Battalions were disbanded on 15 August 1944 while 4th Battalion was disbanded on 24 October 1944 at Camp Butner, North Carolina.

====2nd and 5th Ranger Battalions====
The 2nd Ranger Battalion and 5th Ranger Battalion were trained at Camp Forrest, Tennessee, on 1 April 1943. They first saw action 6 June 1944, during Operation Overlord. During D-day 2nd Rangers companies D, E, and F, were ordered to take a strategic German outpost at Pointe du Hoc. This coastal cliff was supposed to have several 155 mm artillery cannons aimed down at the beach. Once they arrived at the bottom of the cliff, they had an enormous climb to make up rope ladders while receiving a barrage of machinegun fire from the Germans above. The 2nd Rangers took the area even with the intense German resistance but the guns were not in sight. A patrol scouting the area found the 155 mm coastal guns a mile away; the patrol party quickly disabled the guns and resistance in the area. In an interview, Leonard Lomell and Jack Kuhn explained the events that took place that day:

Meanwhile, the rest of the 2nd and 5th Ranger Battalions spearheaded the attack on the beach at Omaha. An apocryphal story tells of when General Norman Cota, leading the 29th Infantry Division, met with Major Max F. Schneider, commanding the 5th Ranger Battalion. When Schneider was asked his unit by Cota, someone yelled out &quot;5th Rangers!&quot;, to which Cota replied, &quot;Well then Goddammit, Rangers, lead the way!&quot; This drive cut the German line allowing the conventional army to move in. The phrase &quot;Rangers lead the way&quot; later became the motto of the regiment.
The 2nd and 5th Ranger Battalions worked on special operation tasks in the Normandy Campaign. The two battalions fought in many battles such as Battle for Brest and the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest. The 2nd Rangers were responsible for capturing Le Conquet Peninsula, where they disabled a 280 mm gun and took many German prisoners. The 2nd Ranger Battalion also went on to take several tactical German positions, cutting the German line in the Rhineland. In Saar west of Zerf, the 5th Battalion took an overlooking German position cutting of all supply routes to German forces.

====6th Ranger Battalion====
The 6th Ranger Battalion was stationed in the Pacific, and served mostly in the Philippines and New Guinea. All operations completed by the 6th Battalion were done in company- or platoon-size behind enemy lines. They were the first soldiers to hit the Philippines, three days before the army would launch the first invasion. The 6th Ranger Battalion conducted long-range reconnaissance, operating miles past the front line.

At Cabanatuan, on the island of Luzon in January 1945, a company of the 6th Ranger Battalion executed the Raid at Cabanatuan. The Rangers penetrated behind enemy lines, including crawling a mile () across an open field on their stomachs. During their final assault the Rangers destroyed a garrison of Japanese soldiers twice their size and rescued 500 POWs.

The 6th Ranger Battalion&#x27;s final mission was to secure a drop zone for 11th Airborne Division paratroopers into enemy territory. They linked up with the 37th Infantry Division and ended the war in the Philippines.

===Merrill&#x27;s Marauders===
In August 1944, after five months of fighting in China Burma India Theater with the Japanese Army, Merrill&#x27;s Marauders (5307th Composite Unit (Provisional)) were consolidated into then 475th Infantry, afterwards the 75th Infantry Regiment. As a special force group led by Brigadier General Frank Merrill, to commemorate its companion Chinese Expeditionary Force (Burma), Merrill&#x27;s Marauders put the sun from the National emblem of the Republic of China and the Star from Burma&#x27;s flag on its badge. The lightning bolt signifies the swiftness of their strikes. Merrill&#x27;s Marauders would later become part of the regiment&#x27;s lineage.

===Korean War===

The outbreak of hostilities in Korea in June 1950 again signaled the need for Rangers. Fifteen Ranger companies were formed during the Korean War, drawing their lineages from the World War II era Ranger battalions. The Rangers went to battle throughout the winter of 1950 and the spring of 1951. They were nomadic warriors, attached first to one Regiment and then to another. They performed &quot;out front&quot; work—scouting, patrolling, raids, ambushes, spearheading assaults, and as counterattack forces to regain lost positions. In all six airborne Ranger companies, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 8th, averaging 125 soldiers in each company served during the conflict. Two other companies, the 10th and 11th, were scheduled for Korea but were deactivated in Japan. During the course of the Korean War, 100 Rangers were killed in action and 296 were wounded in action.

===Vietnam War===
The history of Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP—pronounced &quot;Lurp&quot;), LRP, and Ranger units deployed during the Cold War in Europe and Vietnam is based on three time periods: 1) LRRP from late 1965 to 20 December 1967; 2) LRP from late December 1967 through January 1969; and 3) Ranger from 1 February 1969 to 1972 when the Vietnam War drew down and the U.S. Vietnam Ranger units were deactivated. Despite sharing a similar name, these Ranger units under the 75th Infantry Regiment (Ranger) drew their lineages not from the World War II/Korean War era Ranger battalions but from 5307 Composite Unit, also known as Merrill&#x27;s Marauders. In 1974, their colors and lineage were passed to newly formed Ranger Battalions based in the United States.

The first period above began in Vietnam in November 1966 with the creation of a provisional LRRP Detachment by the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile); followed by the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division; the 1st Infantry Division; and the 25th Infantry Division in June 1966. General William C. Westmoreland, commander of Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), ordered the creation of provisional LRRPs in all Infantry brigades and divisions on 8 July 1966. By the winter of 1966 the 4th and 9th Infantry Divisions had operational LRRP units, and in January 1967 the 196th Light Infantry Brigade had the same. The 101st Airborne Division &quot;main body,&quot; while still at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, converted its divisional Recondo School into a provisional LRRP unit in the summer of 1967, before the division deployed to Vietnam. This provisional company arrived in Vietnam in late November 1967.
The second period began in late June 1967, when the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Earle G. Wheeler, authorized the formation of two long-range patrol companies for I and II Field Forces. Company E (Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol), 20th Infantry (Airborne) was activated on 25 September 1967 and assigned to I Field Force and stationed at Phan Rang. The nucleus of this unit came from the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division LRRP Platoon, along with soldiers from the replacement stream. Company F (Long Range Patrol), 51st Infantry (Airborne) was activated on 25 September 1967 and assigned to II Field Force stationed at Bien Hoa. Its nucleus came from the LRRP platoon of the 173d Airborne Brigade, along with soldiers from the replacement stream. Each of the two Field Force LRP companies had a strength of 230 men, and was commanded by a major. In an apparent response to division commanders&#x27; tactical requirements, and bolstered by the combat effectiveness of the provisional LRRP units, in the winter of 1967 the Army authorized separate company designations for Long Range Patrol (LRP) units in divisions and detachments in separate brigades. The divisional LRP companies were authorized 118 men and the brigade detachments 61 men. The wholesale renaming of existing divisional LRP units occurred on 20 December 1967 in the 1st Cavalry, 1st Infantry, 4th Infantry, 9th Infantry, 23d (Americal), and 25th Infantry Divisions. LRP detachments were created in the 199th Light Infantry Brigade on 10 January 1968, in the 173d Airborne Brigade on 5 February 1968, and in the 3d Brigade 82d Airborne Division and 1st Brigade 5th Mechanized Division on 15 December 1968.

On 1 February 1969, the final period of the existence of these units began when the Department of the Army redesignated the LRP companies and detachments as lettered Ranger companies of the 75th Infantry Regiment under the Combined Arms Regimental System (CARS). The &quot;re-flagged&quot; Ranger companies were: &quot;A&quot; V Corps Rangers, Fort Hood, Texas; &quot;B&quot; VII Corps Rangers, Fort Lewis, Washington; &quot;C&quot; I Field Forces, Vietnam; &quot;D&quot; II Field Forces, Vietnam; &quot;E&quot; 9th Infantry Division, Vietnam; F 25th Infantry Division, Vietnam; &quot;G&quot; 23rd Infantry Division, Vietnam; &quot;H&quot; 1st Cavalry Division, Vietnam; &quot;I&quot; 1st Infantry Division, Vietnam; &quot;K&quot; 4th Infantry Division, Vietnam; &quot;L&quot; 101st Airborne Division, Vietnam; &quot;M&quot; 199th Light Infantry Brigade, Vietnam; &quot;N&quot; 173rd Airborne Brigade, Vietnam; &quot;O&quot; 3rd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division, Vietnam; &quot;P&quot; 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division (Mechanized), Vietnam; &quot;D/151&quot; Indiana National Guard; and &quot;F/425 &quot; Michigan National Guard. The third period ended when the Ranger companies were inactivated as their parent units were withdrawn from the war between November 1969 (starting with Company O, 3rd Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division) to 15 August 1972 (ending with Company H, 1st Cavalry Division). On 9 June 1972, H Company (Ranger) lost SGT Elvis Weldon Osborne Jr. and CPL Jeffrey Alan Maurer to enemy action. Three other US soldiers were killed by non-hostile action that day, but SGT Osborne and CPL Maurer were the last US Army infantrymen killed on the ground, as well as the last Rangers killed in the Vietnam War.

===Post-Vietnam War===

In January 1974, General Creighton Abrams, Army Chief of Staff, directed the formation of a Ranger battalion. General Kenneth C. Leuer was charged with activating, organizing, training and leading the first battalion sized Ranger unit since World War II. Though the Vietnam War era Ranger companies of the 75th Infantry Regiment (Ranger), which drew their lineages from Merrill&#x27;s Marauders, had all been deactivated (or soon would be), they passed their lineages and colors to these new battalions. The 1st Battalion, which carried its legacy from Merrill&#x27;s Marauders via Company C, 75th Infantry Regiment (Ranger) was activated and parachuted into Fort Stewart, Georgia, on 1 July 1974. The 2nd Battalion, which drew lineage from Company H, 75th Infantry (Ranger), followed shortly afterward with activation at Fort Lewis, Washington on 1 October 1974. The 3rd Battalion and Headquarters Company were activated and received their colors on 3 October 1984 from Company F, 75th Infantry Regiment (Ranger) at Fort Moore, Georgia. On 3 February 1986, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions of the 75th were consolidated with active and inactive units which carried the lineages of the World War II era: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Ranger Battalions. The regiment as a whole was concurrently redesignated as the 75th Ranger Regiment.

The modern Ranger battalions were first called upon in 1980 when elements of 1st Ranger Battalion participated in Operation Eagle Claw, the Iranian hostage-rescue mission. In October 1983, 1st and 2nd Ranger Battalions spearheaded Operation Urgent Fury, conducting a dangerous low-level parachute assault to seize Point Salines Airfield and rescue American citizens at True Blue Medical Campus in Grenada.

The entire 75th Ranger Regiment participated in Operation Just Cause, which lasted from December 1989 to January 1990. Rangers spearheaded the action by conducting two important operations. Simultaneous parachute assaults were conducted onto Torrijos/Tocumen International Airport, Rio Hato Airfield, and General Manuel Noriega&#x27;s beach house to neutralize Panamanian Defense Forces. The Rangers captured more than 1,014 prisoners of war and more than 18,000 weapons.

Elements of Company B, and 1st Platoon Company A, 1st Ranger Battalion, deployed to Saudi Arabia from 12 February 1991 to 15 April 1991 for Operation Desert Storm. They conducted raids and provided a quick reaction force in cooperation with allied forces. In December 1991, 1/75 and the Regimental headquarters deployed to Kuwait in a show of force called Operation Iris Gold. The Rangers performed an airborne assault onto Ali Al Salem airfield, near Kuwait City, conducted a foot march through devastation (including mine fields) left from the ground campaign, conducted a live fire exercise, and left on foot.

In August 1993, elements of 3rd Ranger Battalion deployed to Somalia to help United Nations forces attempting to bring order to the chaotic and starving nation. On 3 October 1993, the Rangers conducted a daylight raid with Delta Force. They captured the high-value targets but the ensuing Battle of Mogadishu ended in chaos as the American forces were trapped for hours inside the city by Somalian militias, due to a series of planning and command errors, resulting in the death of several American soldiers. Rangers held improvised positions for nearly 18 hours, killing between 500 and 1,000 Somalis before American QRF, Pakistani, and Malaysian troops with armor rescued them and the American troops could retreat. The mission was seen as a pyrrhic victory

===Regimental Reconnaissance Company===

In 1984, the 75th Ranger Regiment established a Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment (RRD). On 24 November 2000, the detachment deployed with a command-and-control element to Kosovo for Task Force Falcon. By 2005, the unit—enlarged and renamed the Regimental Reconnaissance Company (RRC)—had become an elite special operations force and a member of Joint Special Operations Command. In 2006, the Regimental Reconnaissance Company was moved into the new Regimental Special Troops Battalion.

===Regimental Special Troops Battalion===
Several years into the War on Terror, the 75th Ranger Regiment created a Regimental Special Troops Battalion (RSTB) to help switch from short-term &quot;contingency missions&quot; to continuous combat operations. Activated on 17 July 2006, the RSTB conducts sustainment, intelligence, reconnaissance and maintenance missions that were previously accomplished by small detachments assigned to the Regimental Headquarters and then attached within each of the three Ranger battalions. The battalion consists of the Ranger Reconnaissance Company, the Ranger Communications Company (RCC), the Ranger Military Intelligence Company (RMIC), and the Ranger Selection and Training Company (RST&amp;C). The RSTB draws its lineage from Company N, 75th Infantry Regiment (back to Merrill&#x27;s Marauders) and Company B, 1st Ranger Infantry Battalion.

===Global War on Terrorism===
While the Ranger Regiment has traditionally been considered an elite light infantry force, its operations in Afghanistan and Iraq from 2001 to 2012 demonstrated its ability to conduct a full range of special operations missions.

In October 2007, a D Company was added to each of the three battalions of the 75th Ranger Regiment.

By 2012, the 75th Ranger Regiment was conducting sustained combat operations in multiple countries, deploying from multiple locations in the United States—an unprecedented task for the regiment. Rangers conducted combat operations with almost every deployed special operations, conventional, and coalition force in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Ranger Regiment executed a wide range of operations, including airborne and air assaults into Afghanistan and Iraq, mounted infiltrations behind enemy lines, complex urban raids on high-value targets (HVTs), and rescue operations. Ranger battalion operational tempo while deployed was high. During one Afghanistan deployment, the 1st Ranger Battalion conducted more than 900 missions, captured nearly 1,700 enemy combatants (including 386 high-value targets), and killed more than 400 fighters.

By mid-2015 each Ranger battalion had completed its twentieth deployment to Afghanistan and Iraq.

&quot;Army Times&quot; reported that in December 2016, the first female officer completed RASP, making the 75th Ranger Regiment the first special operations unit to have a female soldier graduate its selection course.

====Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan====
After the events of 11 September 2001, Rangers were called into action for the War on Terror. On 19 October 2001, 200 Rangers of 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment spearheaded ground forces by conducting an airborne assault to seize Objective Rhino during the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, the opening battle of Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan. Spc. Jonn J. Edmunds and Pfc. Kristofer T. Stonesifer became the first combat casualties in the War on Terror when their MH-60L helicopter crashed at Objective Honda in Pakistan, a temporary staging site used by a company of Rangers from 3rd Battalion. Ranger protection force teams were part of Task Force Sword, a black SOF unit whose primary objective was capturing or killing senior leaders and HVTs with al-Qaeda and the Taliban. A squadron of Delta Force operatives, supported by Rangers from TF Sword, conducted an operation outside Kandahar at a location known as Objective Gecko; they missed the mission&#x27;s target but killed some 30 Taliban fighters in a heavy firefight.

In November 2001, the 75th Ranger Regiment carried out its second combat parachute drop into Afghanistan: a platoon-sized Ranger security element, including the Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment Team 3 conducted the missions: Objective Wolverine, Raptor and Operation Relentless Strike. During the Battle of Tora Bora in December 2001, a CIA Jawbreaker team (a small group of CIA SAD ground branch operators) requested that the 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment be inserted into the mountains to block escape routes from Tora Bora to Pakistan. They would serve as an &quot;anvil&quot; while Special Forces with the Afghan Militia Forces would be the &quot;hammer&quot;. With the attached Air Force Combat Controllers, the Rangers could have directed airstrikes onto enemy concentrations or engaged them in ambushes, but their requests to do so were denied.

In March 2002, 35 Rangers from 1st Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment had been assigned as QRF for all Task Force operations, but only half of the platoon was available for the Battle of Takur Ghar. In the final days of Operation Anaconda, a mixed force of Rangers travelling in Blackhawk helicopters backed up operators from DEVGRU who intercepted a convoy of al-Qaeda fighters traveling in three SUVs via three MH-47Es. A firefight left 16 al-Qaeda fighters dead and two seriously wounded and captured. On 18 August, Rangers and other coalition special forces joined the 82nd Airborne Division in Operation Mountain Sweep, carrying out five combat air assault missions in the area around the villages of Dormat and Narizah, south of Khowst and Gardez. The force found an anti-aircraft gun, two 82mm mortars, recoilless rifles, rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, machine guns, small arms and ammunition for all of them; they also detained 10 people. Later in 2002, TF 11 was replaced by a small JSOC element manned by SEALs and Rangers.

In 2003, after Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was arrested in a joint CIA-ISI operation in Pakistan, Rangers and 82nd Airborne Division troops helped transport him to a U.S. black site prison. After the troops secured an improvised desert strip in a dry river bed near the Pakistani border, an MC-130 Combat Talon plane landed and lowered its ramp, whereupon SEALs from DEVGRU drove Desert Patrol Vehicles carrying the detainee up the ramp into the back of the plane, which taxied and lifted off.

In summer 2005, during Operation Red Wings, a Ranger patrol retrieved HM2 Marcus Luttrell five days after he went missing.

In July 2006, in Helmand Province, two MH-47Es from 160th SOAR attempted to insert a combined strike element of DEVGRU, Rangers, and Afghan commandos so they could attack a compound. With some troops on the ground, a large insurgent force ambushed them; both helicopters were struck by small arms fire. One MH-47E pilot put his aircraft in the line of fire to protect the assault team disembarking from the other MH-47E, but was struck by an RPG and crash-landed without serious injury. The Ranger commander and an attached Australian commando organized an all-round defense while the other MH-47E held back the advancing insurgents until its Miniguns ran out of ammunition. An AC-130 Spectre joined the battle and kept the downed crew and passengers safe until a British Immediate Response Team helicopter recovered them. The AC-130 then destroyed the MH-47E wreck, denying it to the Taliban. Also that year, a six-man RRD (Regimental Reconnaissance Detachment) team from the 75th Ranger Regiment attached to the JSOC Task Force inserted into the Hindu Kush mountain range after intelligence indicated that an insurgent chief, Haqqani, would be entering Afghanistan from Pakistan. After establishing an OP almost 4,000 meters above sea level, the RRD team waited and watched for their target. Insurgents arrived and began to fire on the Ranger team, whose attached JTAC called in an orbiting B-1B strategic bomber. The airplane killed an estimated 100 insurgents, but not Haqqani.

In 2007, after a CIA source reported seeing Bin Laden in Tora Bora, many theater ISR assets were sent the area. The initial plan based around a small helicopter assault force soon expanded to include Special Forces ODAs and a Ranger element to provide a cordon for the SEALs. Eventually, the operation was launched under the cover of Air Force bombing, but after fruitless searching through the mountains, no sign of Bin Laden was found.

In June 2009, Army soldier Bowe Bergdahl was captured by the Taliban. Over the five years that he was held by the Taliban and Haqqani Network, Rangers and DEVGRU &quot;spun up&quot; operations to rescue him, but each resulted in a &quot;dry hole.&quot;

On 8 October 2010, a troop from DEVGRU and two squads of Rangers tried to rescue Linda Norgrove, who was being held by the Taliban in compounds in the Korangal Valley. The rescue mission failed when a DEVGRU operator accidentally killed Norgrove with a grenade.

For actions between 14 and 16 November 2010, Charlie Company 1/75th, received the Valorous Unit Award for extraordinary heroism, combat achievement, and conspicuous gallantry.

With ISAF&#x27;s surge in Afghanistan at its peak in summer 2011, 1/75th (and Bravo Company in particular) received the Meritorious Unit Citation for actions during Operation Enduring Freedom between 15 May – 28 August 2011. These included conducting continuous combat operations, including time-sensitive raids and deliberate movement-to-contact operations in enemy-held terrain beyond reach of friendly forces in places like Khost, Paktika and Nangarhar Province. Two Rangers from the battalion were killed during this time. On 20 July, Delta Force supported by Rangers and Afghan SOF elements were inserted by the 160th SOAR into the mountainous region of Sar Rowzah District, Paktika Province. They were immediately engaged by insurgents who were heavily armed with DShK HMGs and RPGs; during that night&#x27;s fighting, about 30 insurgents were killed. As the sun rose, dozens of remaining insurgents who had been hiding in bunkers and caves became visible, and armed UAVs, AH-6s, and MH-60 DAPs flew in close air support, as did ground attack aircraft. Fighting continued into a second day as bunkers and fighting positions were systematically cleared, some using then-recently issued Mk14 Antistructural Grenades. An estimated 80 to 100 Haqqani and foreign fighters were killed in the two-day battle.

On 6 August, a platoon of U.S. Army Rangers began taking fire while trying to capture a senior Taliban leader in the Tangi Valley in Wardak province. A CH-47 helicopter carrying 38 American and Afghan servicemen was dispatched to help, but was shot down by the Taliban. All 38 aboard died in the deadliest single incident for Americans in the Afghanistan campaign.

====Operation Iraqi Freedom====
During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, all three Ranger Battalions were assigned to a new Task Force whose goals were to seize key locations, conduct long-range special reconnaissance, and capture HVTs. On 24 March 2003, 3rd Battalion 75th Ranger Regiment conducted a combat drop onto H-1 Air Base, securing the site as a staging area for operations in western Iraq. A company of Rangers and Royal Marines from 45 Commando flew into Iraq from Jordan to secure H-2 and H-3 airbases after they were captured by US, British and Australian SOF. On 26 March, B Company, 2/75th supported DEVGRU operators in the Objective Beaver raid on a suspected chemical and biological weapons site north of Haditha; they engaged numerous gunmen but found no chemical or biological weapons. On 1 April 2003, 290 Rangers from 1/75th and 2/75th helped rescue Private 1st Class Jessica Lynch; also that day, Delta Force and 3/75th captured the Haditha Dam and held it for five days.

After the invasion, the main 75th Ranger element deployed to Iraq carried out operations in northern Iraq and was based out of Mosul or Tikrit, supported by a small element of Delta Force operators. The DEVGRU squadron were supported by a reinforced Ranger platoon as was the Delta Force squadron, all part of the overall effort by JSOC in Iraq. On 18 June 2003, Delta Force operators and Rangers flew from Mosul via helicopter to chase a vehicle convoy of Ba&#x27;ath Party Iraqis who were fleeing over the border into Syria; JSOC suspected that Saddam Hussein was part of the convoy so the convoy was destroyed by an AC-130 Spectre. The operators then conducted a heliborne assault into a nearby compound that proved to be a Ba&#x27;athist safe house for ferrying former regime elements across the border. The operators came under fire from Syrian border guards, leading to a firefight that left several Syrians dead and 17 captured. Hussein was not in the convoy, but several of his cousins were.

On 23 July 2005, in Baghdad, Rangers acted as a back-up force for the British Special Boat Service during Operation Marlborough.

On 1 January 2006, Rangers raided a remote farmhouse outside Baghdad, capturing several gunmen without a fight and rescuing British freelance journalist Phillip Sands, who had been kidnapped a week earlier.

In Ramadi, the Rangers switched to riskier daylight raids after insurgents learned to move out of the city at night.

In November 2006, a new secret directive sanctioned by President Bush allowed U.S. forces in Iraq to kill or capture Iranian nationals if they were targeting coalition forces. The directive reflected Hezbollah&#x27;s success in the 2006 Lebanon War and Iran&#x27;s defiance on its nuclear issue; the new mission was known by its acronym CII (Counter Iranian Influence). The CII missions were given to Task Force 17, a new command based around the headquarters of an Army Special Forces group. To support TF 17, Rangers from B Company 2/75th flew into Sadr City to hunt a Shia Special Groups leader, leading to a fierce street battle; the Rangers conducted a fighting withdrawal that was likened to &quot;Mogadishu Mile.&quot; More than 45 insurgents were killed with no Ranger losses; when the Iraqi government was made aware of the operation, permission to conduct operations in Sadr City was immediately withdrawn, limiting the Task Force&#x27;s targeting.

In June 2008, Rangers eliminated perhaps their highest-profile target yet: Abu Khalaf, deputy leader of al Qaeda in Iraq. A reinforced platoon of Rangers assaulted the target house, codenamed Objective Crescent Lake. As the Ranger assault element placed their explosive breaching charges, two sentries on the roof of the house armed with AK-47 assault rifles approached them, who were then killed by an attached 4-man sniper team from the Ranger battalion&#x27;s sniper platoon. The assault element breached the house and methodically cleared each room; in one room, Rangers arrested a man and a woman. When the man reached under his clothing, the Rangers shot him, then the woman as she leapt on his body. The man was found to be wearing a suicide-bomb vest filled with ball bearings. Meanwhile, Khalaf ran to the road with a pistol and was shot dead by the Ranger snipers. The Rangers also discovered a plan for a chemical weapon attack on a coalition base.

By this time, the Rangers had sent an additional platoon to Iraq to help conduct a day-night raiding cycle, and conducted up to 100 missions in one three-month deployment.

After January 2009, the new Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) required JSOC and Ranger operations to seek Iraqi judicial permission for each mission.

On the night of 18 April 2010, ISOF troops, supported by U.S. troops, raided a terrorist safe house near Tikrit in Iraq, the ISOF killed Abu Ayyub al-Masri and Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the two leaders of ISI; 16 others were also arrested. A US UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter supporting the mission crashed, killing a Ranger NCO from 3/75th and wounding the aircrew.

====War in North-West Pakistan====
In March 2006, DEVGRU operators and a Ranger element are alleged to have attacked an al-Qaeda training camp in North Waziristan in Pakistan. In an operation reportedly named Operation Vigilant Harvest, they were flown across the Afghan-Pakistani border and killed as many as 30 terrorists, including the Chechen camp commandant Imam Asad. The operation has been credited to the Pakistani Special Service Group.

On 1 May 2011, a Ranger element was assigned to support Operation Neptune Spear, aimed at killing or capturing Osama bin Laden. The Ranger element and additional SEALs in MH-47E Chinooks served as QRF; the Ranger element would also protect the FARP north of Abbottabad. Following the successful completion of the operation, a Ranger team transported Bin Laden&#x27;s body to the aircraft carrier for burial at sea.

====Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel====
In November 2015, the U.S. military sent a company of Rangers to southeastern Afghanistan, as part of the post-ISAF phase of the war in Afghanistan, to help Afghan counter-terrorism forces destroy an al-Qaeda training camp in a &quot;fierce fight&quot; that lasted for several days.

On the evening of 26 April 2017, 50 Rangers from 3/75th joined 40 Afghan commandos in a joint US-Afghan raid on the headquarters of Abdul Hasib, the emir of ISIS-K, in a village in Achin District, Nangarhar Province. The force was flown into Mohmand Valley and within minutes were engaged in a heavy, close-quarter firefight with ISIL-KP militants. AC-130 gunships, Apache helicopters, F-16 fighters, and drones were called in. In the 3-hour firefight, two Rangers died (one each from C and D Companies, possibly from friendly fire) and one was wounded, while 35 ISIL-KP militants (including Abdul Hasib and an unspecified number of ISIL-KP leaders) were killed.

====Operation Inherent Resolve====
In March 2017, as part of Operation Inherent Resolve, &quot;CNN&quot; reported that about 100 Rangers in Strykers and armored Humvees deployed in and around Manbij, Syria, to protect the 11th MEU, which was providing artillery and other support to U.S.-backed forces in the battle to liberate Raqqa from ISIL, rather than the typical mission of training, advising and assisting local forces. U.S. officials took the unusual step of publicly talking about the Ranger deployment and where they are located to protect against them inadvertently coming under fire from forces fighting in the region or Turkish, Russian, or Syrian government forces.

====Regiment Military Intelligence Battalion (RMIB)====

On 22 May 2017, the Ranger Regiment Military Intelligence Battalion was established to specialize in intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, cyber, and electronic warfare operations. Based at Fort Moore, it consists of the Military Intelligence Company (MICO), Cyber Electro Magnetic Activities company (CEMA), and Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC). It draws its lineage from Company P, 75th Infantry (back to Merrill&#x27;s Marauders) and Company B, 2nd Ranger Infantry Battalion.

====Operation Kayla Mueller====
On 26 October 2019, the Rangers, Delta Force, and the 160th SOAR killed ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

===Selection and training===

Every volunteer for the Regiment, from new recruit to officer and any senior leader selected to command in the Regiment, will go through the Ranger Assessment and Selection Program (RASP) to assess their ability and provide the basic skills required to be an effective member of the 75th Ranger Regiment.

For new soldiers, RASP is conducted after applicants complete their basic Military Occupational Specialty course. After completing RASP, soldiers attend the Army parachutists course (Airborne School). For soldiers, both enlisted and officer, who have completed their first tour of duty and meet the recruiting qualifications, a RASP date will be scheduled upon application and conditional acceptance to the 75th Ranger Regiment.

RASP includes two levels of training: RASP 1 for junior non-commissioned officers and enlisted soldiers (pay grades E-1 through E-5) and RASP 2 for senior non-commissioned officers, officers, and warrant officers. Candidates train in physical fitness, marksmanship, small unit tactics, medical proficiency, and mobility. Training is fast-paced and intense, ensuring Ranger candidates can handle continued training and worldwide operations upon reaching their assigned Ranger unit. Throughout the course, candidates are screened to ensure that only the best soldiers are chosen for the Ranger Regiment. All candidates must meet the course requirements in order to serve in the Ranger Regiment. Upon completion of RASP, candidates will don the tan beret and 75th Ranger Regiment Scroll.

====RASP 1====
Ranger Assessment &amp; Selection Program 1 (RASP 1) is an 8-week selection course for junior non-commissioned officers and enlisted soldiers (pay grades E-1 through E-5) that is broken down into two phases. Ranger candidates endure a grueling test of physical and mental endurance, road marches with rucksacks, land navigation, leadership skills, and weapons training—performed under continuous food and sleep deprivation. Graduates have the advanced skills all Rangers are required to know to start their career with the 75th Ranger Regiment. Phase 1 focuses more on the critical events and skill level 1 tasks and Phase 2 focuses on training in marksmanship, breaching, mobility, and physical fitness.

====RASP 2====
Ranger Assessment &amp; Selection Program 2 (RASP 2) is a 21-day selection course for senior non-commissioned officers, officers, and warrant officers. Candidates&#x27; physical and mental capabilities are tested as they learn the special tactics, techniques and procedures of the Regiment, as well as learning the expectations of leading and developing young Rangers.

===Continued training===
To maintain readiness, Rangers train constantly. Rangers focus on the &quot;Big 5&quot;: marksmanship, physical training, medical training, small unit tactics, and mobility.

Throughout their time in the Ranger Regiment, Rangers may attend many types of special schools and training. Depending on occupation and job requirements, members of the 75th Ranger Regiment enjoy unparalleled access to countless military schools, including Jumpmaster, Sniper, Pathfinder, Military Freefall, Scuba, Survival-Evasion-Resistance-Escape (SERE), Special Operations Combat Medic and others. Before serving as a leader in the Regiment, Rangers are also expected to attend and graduate Ranger School. Members of the regiment may also get joint training and non-traditional military and civilian schooling.

Rangers are trained in &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; emergency medicine. Based on the premise that 90% of deaths from wounds are suffered before reaching medical facilities and that there are not enough medics and doctors to go around, the regiment began to train Rangers to give themselves immediate, preliminary treatment. A 2011 study found a 3 percent death rate from potentially survivable causes in the 75th Regiment between October 2001 and April 2010. That compares with a 24 percent rate in a previously reported set of U.S. military deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan, which included troops who didn&#x27;t have Ranger-style training.

===RFS/RFM===

As a U.S. Army Special Operations Command unit, the Rangers maintain more stringent standards for their personnel. If at any point a Ranger is deemed to be failing to meet these standards he may be relieved and removed from the regiment. This is commonly referred to as being RFSed, short for &quot;Released For Standards&quot;. A Ranger can be RFS&#x27;d for virtually any reason, ranging from lack of motivation to disciplinary problems. Similarly, a Ranger physically incapable of performing his mission through prolonged illness or injury can also be removed from the regiment through a process referred to as RFM or &quot;Relieved For Medical reasons&quot;.

==Honors, mottos and creed==

The 75th Ranger Regiment has been credited with numerous campaigns from World War II onwards. In World War II, they participated in 16 major campaigns, spearheading the campaigns in Morocco, Sicily, Naples-Foggia, Anzio, and Leyte. During the Vietnam War, they received campaign participation streamers for every campaign in the war. The regiment received streamers with arrowheads (denoting conflicts they spearheaded) for Grenada and Panama. The Rangers have earned six Presidential Unit Citations, nine Valorous Unit Awards, and four Meritorious Unit Commendation, the most recent of which were earned in Vietnam and Haditha, Iraq, respectively.

Sua Sponte, Latin for &quot;Of their own accord&quot; is the 75th Ranger Regiment&#x27;s Regimental motto. Contemporary rangers are triple-volunteers: for the U.S. Army, for Airborne School, and for service in the 75th Ranger Regiment.

The motto &quot;Rangers lead the way!&quot; dates from 6 June 1944, during the Normandy Landings on Dog White sector of Omaha Beach. Then Brigadier General Norman Cota (assistant CO of the 29th ID) calmly walked towards Maj. Max Schneider (CO of the 5th Ranger Battalion) while under heavy machine gun fire and asked &quot;What outfit is this?&quot; Someone yelled &quot;5th Rangers!&quot; To this, Cota replied &quot;Well then Goddammit, Rangers! Lead the way!&quot;

==The term &quot;Ranger&quot;==
Organizations define the term &quot;Ranger&quot; in different ways. For example, the annual &quot;United States Army Best Ranger Competition,&quot; hosted by the Ranger Training Brigade, can be won by pairs of participants from the 75th Ranger Regiment, or by ranger-qualified entrants from other units in the U.S. military. For an individual to be inducted into the U.S. Army Ranger Association&#x27;s &quot;Ranger Hall of Fame,&quot; they &quot;must have served in a Ranger unit in combat or be a successful graduate of the U.S. Army Ranger School.&quot; The Ranger Association further clarifies the type of unit: &quot;A Ranger unit is defined as those Army units recognized in Ranger lineage or history.&quot; Acceptance into the U.S. Army Ranger Association is limited to &quot;Rangers that have earned the U.S. Army Ranger tab, WWII Rangers, Korean War Rangers, Vietnam War Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol members and Rangers, and all Rangers that participated in Operations Urgent Fury, Just Cause, Desert Storm, Restore Hope, Enduring Freedom, as well as those who have served honorably for at least one year in a recognized Ranger unit.&quot;

===Ranger term controversy===
There is some dispute over the use of the word &quot;Ranger.&quot; According to John Lock, The problems of the Ranger Tab and indeed Ranger history is in large part caused by the lack of a clear-cut definition of who is a Ranger. The Ranger Department, the Infantry School, and Department of the Army have in the past carelessly accepted the definition of a Ranger unit to include the use of terms &#x27;Ranger-type&#x27; and &#x27;Units like Rangers,&#x27; and &#x27;Special Mission Units.&#x27; In his book &quot;Raiders or Elite Infantry&quot;, David Hogan of the Center of Military History writes that &#x27;By the time of the formation of LRRP units..., Ranger had become a term of legendary connotations but no precise meaning.&#x27; For the want of a definition of who and what is a Ranger, integrity was lost. As a result of Grenada, circumstances have changed. Since 1983, men have had the opportunity to earn and wear an authorized Ranger unit scroll or an authorized Ranger Tab or both. But there is a need for a firm definition of who and what constitutes a RANGER. Without that definition, we face the likelihood of future controversy.

==Beret change==
In June 2001, Army Chief of Staff General Eric Shinseki gave the order to issue black berets to regular soldiers. At the time, black berets were being worn exclusively by the Ranger Regiment. This created discontent within the 75th Ranger Regiment and even led to retired Rangers going on nationwide road marches to Washington, D.C. to protest against the decision. Because there was not a Presidential authorization to the regiment for exclusive wear of the black beret, they switched to wearing a tan beret to preserve a unique appearance, tan being reflective of the buckskin worn by the men of Robert Rogers&#x27; Rangers during the French and Indian War. A memorandum for the purpose of changing the Ranger beret from black to tan was sent and approved in March 2002. Press releases were issued and articles were published all over the nation about this change in headgear after it was formally announced by the Regimental Commander, Colonel P. K. Keen. In a private ceremony, past and present Rangers donned the tan beret on 26 July 2002. The Army G-1 released a memorandum in October 2017 stating the following: WEAR OF THE TAN BERET OUTSIDE OF RANGER REGIMENT. The memo from the Army G-1 expands authorization for wear of the Tan Beret in the following assignments: Headquarters elements of Combatant Commands, The Joint Staff, Department of the Army Headquarters, U.S. Special Operations Command, U.S. Army Special Operations Command, U.S. Special Operations Command Joint Task Force, Theater Special Operations Command, and Joint Special Operations Command. The Tan Beret is authorized for Ranger-qualified Soldiers in the above listed assignments if they previously served in the 75th Ranger Regiment and departed on honorable terms. This was formalized in DA Pam 670–1 in January 2021.

<text>The Blasket Islands () are an uninhabited group of islands off the west coast of the Dingle Peninsula in County Kerry, Ireland. The last island to hold a significant population, Great Blasket Island, was abandoned in 1954 due to population decline and is best known for a number of Irish language writers who vividly described their way of life and who kept alive old Irish folk tales of the land.

== Name ==
The etymology of the name of the islands is uncertain, but it may be Old Norse in origin. It may have come from the word &quot;brasker&quot; meaning sharp reef of rock or dangerous place. The islands have also been called Ferriter&#x27;s Islands. Topographer Charles Smith referred to Great Blasket, the largest of the group of islands, as Inishmore.

==History==

The earliest known reference to the habitation of the islands is from the late 16th century. However, the Norman-Irish Feiritéar (Ferriter) family who rented the islands from the Earl of Desmond since maintained a castle, possibly at Rinn an Chaisleáin on Great Blasket. The islands were reported to have a population of &quot;five or six families&quot; in the mid-18th century. In the first half of the 19th century, the islands saw a rise in population due to tenants fleeing evictions in Dún Chaoin by Lord Ventry.

The islands were inhabited until 1954 by a completely Irish-speaking population and today are part of the Gaeltacht. At its peak, the islands had 175 residents. The population declined to 22 by 1953. The government evacuated most of the remaining residents to the mainland on 17 November 1953 because of increasingly extreme winter weather that left the island&#x27;s ageing population cut off from emergency services. The evacuation was seen as necessary by both the Islanders and the government. The Ó Suilleabháin family were reluctant to leave, and became the final family to depart Great Blasket Island in 1954.

The islanders were the subject of much anthropological and linguistic study around the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries particularly from writers and linguists such as Robin Flower, George Derwent Thomson and Kenneth H. Jackson. Due to their encouragement and that of others, a number of books were written by islanders that record much of the islands&#x27; traditions and way of life. These include &quot;An tOileánach (The Islandman) and Allagar na hInise (Island cross-talk)&quot; by Tomás Ó Criomhthain, &quot;Peig and Machnamh Seanamhná (An Old Woman&#x27;s Reflections)&quot; by Peig Sayers, &quot;Fiche Blian ag Fás (Twenty Years A-Growing)&quot; by Muiris Ó Súilleabháin and &quot;Letters from the Great Blasket&quot; by Eilís Ní Shuilleabháin.

In 1974 politician Charles Haughey purchased Inishvickillane from the descendants of the Ó Dalaigh family, who had lived on the island 70 years prior. As Taoiseach, Haughey used the island as a summer retreat and hosted many prominent visitors, including French President François Mitterrand. In 1989, he introduced legislation to turn the Blasket Islands into a national park, including powers of compulsory purchase order. This was ruled unconstitutional by Justice Kimberley Budd in 1998.

The archipelago&#x27;s westernmost island, Tearaght, was inhabited by lighthouse keepers until 1988, when the lighthouse was automated.

==Geography==

The six principal Blasket islands, in order of largest to smallest, are:
*Great Blasket Island (&quot;An Blascaod Mór&quot;)
*Inishtooskert (&quot;Inis Tuaisceart&quot;)
*Inishvickillane (&quot;Inis Mhic Uileáin&quot;)
*Inishnabro (&quot;Inis na Bró&quot;)
*Tearaght Island (&quot;An Tiaracht&quot;)
*Beginish (&quot;Beiginis&quot;)

==Environment==
The Blasket Islands are an important breeding site for grey seals in Ireland and have at least 13 species of breeding seabird. The islands and the surrounding waters are designated by the European Environment Agency as a Natura 2000 special area of conservation and five of the islands (not Great Blasket Island) are also designated as a special protected area. The islands have also been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support breeding populations of several species of seabirds.

==Modern transport==
There is a ferry service that calls only to the Great Blasket and sails from Dún Chaoin. This ferry service is mainly for day-trippers. People can also camp on the island overnight. Passengers are transferred to a RIB (rigid inflatable boat) once the ferry gets close to the island, as there are no adequate landing facilities for a larger vessel.

<doc id="428434" wikidata="Q1118321" url="?curid=428434" title="Sizzle cymbal">
<text>A sizzle cymbal is a cymbal to which rivets, chains or other rattles have been added to modify the sound, attached either by means of holes bored in the cymbal or by means of an attachment known as a sizzler.

These rattles have two main effects on the tone of the cymbal:
*Most obviously, the sound of the &#x27;wash&#x27; of the cymbal is made louder and more penetrating, and is dominated by the sound of the rattles themselves. 
*Also important but less obvious, the cymbal loses some of its sustain and dynamic range, because whenever there is insufficient energy left in the cymbal to lift the rattles, the sound cuts out sharply.

Both effects have musical uses, and can also be used to mask unwanted overtones in cymbals of lesser quality. However the best results are still generally obtained with high quality cymbals.

==Uses and patterns==

The most common form of sizzle cymbal used in a drum kit is a large ride cymbal with a number of rivets loosely fitted but captive in holes spaced evenly around the cymbal close to the rim. This might be called the traditional pattern sizzle cymbal. The loose fit allows the rivets to rattle in the holes. Swish and to a lesser extent pang cymbals with rivets installed in this way were heavily used as main ride cymbals in the swing band era, and the swish is traditionally sold with rivets already fitted. Many early rock music drummers, such as Ringo Starr, used a secondary ride cymbal with rivets, normally a ride cymbal thinner than the main ride and ideally one size larger. This was used for variety, to back a lead break or to give extra tone colour to the whole of faster songs such as &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;. 

Many other rivet patterns have been tried, but the only one to have gained much following is a single cluster of two or three rivets close together in an arc close and parallel to the rim. This gained popularity in some genres during the late 1980s and early 1990s and was predicted to replace the traditional pattern, but the traditional pattern has remained more popular overall. 

Bottom hi-hats, crash cymbals, splash cymbals and even bell splashes have been fitted with rivets. The swish cymbal originally shipped with rivets, and is most commonly used with them to this day.

==Removing rivets== 
If the rivets are removed from a sizzle cymbal its previous tone will be restored, despite the small holes left in the cymbal. Large or numerous holes drilled in a cymbal will make the sound dryer, but ordinary rivet holes make an inaudible difference. Rivet holes may slightly decrease the resale value of a cymbal, but this is not usually the case with vintage cymbals.

==Accessory sizzlers==
In order to produce a sizzle sound without the need to bore holes in the cymbal, &quot;sizzlers&quot; may be used. There are two main patterns:
* Rivet sizzlers suspend rivets above the rim of the cymbal, normally in two groups 180 degrees apart.
* Chain sizzlers suspend several short lengths of ball chain on the surface of the cymbal, most often either near the rim or more commonly in many places along a diameter. These chains may be fixed, adjustable in length, or completely removable. Sometimes a single chain of balls from a cabasa is used. 

When a sizzle cymbal is required in an orchestra, most often a chain sizzler is used. The positions of the chains can be adjusted allowing finest control and greatest range of tone in the hands of a skilled percussionist. This also allows any cymbal to be used without any permanent effect on its tone.

<doc id="428437" wikidata="Q243778" url="?curid=428437" title="Gallows">
<text>A gallows (or less precisely scaffold) is a frame or elevated beam, typically wooden, from which objects can be suspended or &quot;weighed&quot;. Gallows were thus widely used to suspend public weighing scales for large and heavy objects such as sacks of grain or minerals, usually positioned in markets or toll gates. The term was also used for a projecting framework from which a ship&#x27;s anchor might be raised so it is no longer sitting on the seabed, riverbed or dock; &quot;weighing [the] anchor&quot; meant raising it using this apparatus while avoiding striking the ship&#x27;s hull.

In modern usage the term has come to mean almost exclusively a scaffold or gibbet used for execution by hanging.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;&quot; was derived from a Proto-Germanic word &quot;&quot; that refers to a &quot;pole&quot;, &quot;rod&quot; or &quot;tree branch&quot;. With the beginning of Christianization, Ulfilas used the term &quot;galga&quot; in his Gothic Testament to refer to the cross of Christ, until the use of the Latin term (crux = cross) prevailed.

==Forms of hanging==
Gallows can take several forms:
* The simplest form (as often used in the game &quot;Hangman&quot;) resembles an inverted &quot;L&quot; (or a Greek/Cyrillic &quot;Г&quot;), with a single upright and a horizontal beam to which the rope noose would be attached.
* The horizontal crossbeam is supported at both ends.
* The Tyburn gallows, commonly known as Tyburn Tree, was triangular in plan, with three uprights and three crossbeams, allowing up to 24 people to be executed simultaneously when all three sides were used.
*Metal eyes bolted at ceiling level, as at the Walla Walla State Penitentiary.

==Types==
===Permanent===
Gallows may be permanent, partly acting as a symbol of justice. The French word for gallows, &quot;potence&quot;, stems from the Latin word &quot;potentia&quot;, meaning &quot;power&quot;. Many old prints of European cities show such a permanent gallows erected on a prominent hill outside the walls, or more commonly near the castle or other seat of justice. In the modern era the gallows were often installed inside a prison; freestanding on a scaffold in the yard, erected at ground level over a pit, enclosed in a small shed, built into the gallery of a prison wing (with the beam resting in brackets on opposite walls), or in a purpose-built execution suite.

===Temporary===
Gallows can also be temporary. In some of the cases, they were even moved to the location of the crime. In England, pirates were typically executed using a temporary gallows, at low tide in the intertidal zone, then left for the sea to wash over them during the following high tides. John the Painter was hanged in 1777 from the mizzenmast of HMS Arethusa for arson in royal dockyards, the highest temporary gallows erected in British history.

The only surviving New Drop gallows in the UK is in Rutland County Museum. The gallows was portable and was set up on the gaol (jail) gatehouse roof when needed. This gallows was first used in 1813 to hang two burglars. The New Drop design was not very effective as the drop was too short to break the neck cleanly.

===Portable===
If a crime took place inside, gallows were sometimes erected—and the criminal hanged—at the front door. In some cases of multiple offenders it was not uncommon to erect multiple temporary gallows, with one noose per condemned criminal. In one case a condemned strangled to death in agony for forty minutes until he finally died from asphyxiation.

===Horse and cart===
Hanging people from early gallows sometimes involved fitting the noose around the person&#x27;s neck while he or she was on a ladder or in a horse-drawn cart underneath. Removing the ladder or driving the cart away left the person dangling by the neck to slowly strangle. A noted example of this type of execution in the USA was the hanging of British spy John André in 1780.

Later, a &quot;scaffold&quot; with a trapdoor tended to be used, so victims dropped down and died quickly from a broken neck rather than through strangulation, especially if extra weights were fixed to their ankles.

During the era of public execution in London, England, a prominent gallows stood at Tyburn, on what is now Marble Arch. Later executions occurred outside Newgate Prison, where the Old Bailey now stands.

==Astronomy==
* March 14 – John Herschel discovers the open cluster of stars now known as NGC 3603.
* Hermann Helmholtz proposes gravitational contraction as the energy source for the Sun.
* Johann Heinrich von Mädler and Wilhelm Beer publish &quot;Mappa Selenographica&quot;, the most complete map of the Moon up to this time.
* Thomas Henderson is appointed first Astronomer Royal for Scotland.

==Biology==
* James Paget discovers in human muscle the parasitic worm that causes trichinosis.
* Félix Dujardin proposes that single-cell animals should be classified in a group by themselves.

==Chemistry ==
* Phenol was discovered by Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge, who extracted it (in impure form) from coal tar.

==Geology==
* The Triassic is named by Friedrich August von Alberti for the three distinct layers of redbeds, capped by chalk, followed by black shales that are found throughout Germany and Northwest Europe, called the &#x27;Trias&#x27;.
* The Great Devonian Controversy begins.

==Paleontology==
* The large prehistoric whale Basilosaurus is discovered in Eocene rock deposits. It is presumed to be a large reptile.

==Mathematics==
* Charles Babbage begins the conceptual design of an &quot;analytical engine&quot;, a mechanical forerunner of the modern computer. It will not be built in his lifetime.

==Mechanics==
* Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi discovers his uniformly rotating self-gravitating ellipsoids.
* Scottish naval architect John Scott Russell first observes a nondecaying solitary wave (a soliton, which he calls &quot;the Wave of Translation&quot;) while watching a boat hauled through the water of the Union Canal near Edinburgh, subsequently using a tank to study the dependence of solitary wave velocities on amplitude and liquid depth.

==Medicine==
* Joseph-François Malgaigne publishes &quot;Manuel de medecine operatoire&quot;.
* St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital is set up in Dublin by Mary Aikenhead, staffed by the Religious Sisters of Charity, the first hospital staffed by nuns in the English-speaking world.

==Physics==
* Émile Clapeyron presents a formulation of the second law of thermodynamics.
* Michael Faraday publishes &quot;On Electrical Decomposition&quot; in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;, in which he coins the words &quot;electrode&quot;, &quot;anode&quot;, &quot;cathode&quot;, &quot;anion&quot;, &quot;cation&quot;, &quot;electrolyte&quot; and &quot;electrolyze&quot;.
* Heinrich Lenz discovers Lenz&#x27;s law.
* Jean-Charles-Athanase Peltier discovers the Peltier effect.

==Technology==
* June 21 – Cyrus McCormick receives his first patent for a mechanical reaper, in the United States.
* December 23 – English architect Joseph Hansom patents the Hansom cab.
* Joseph Chaley’s Grand Pont Suspendu in Fribourg is the first suspension bridge with cables assembled in mid-air.

<doc id="428469" wikidata="Q684112" url="?curid=428469" title="SM-62 Snark">
<text>The Northrop SM-62 Snark is an early-model intercontinental range ground-launched cruise missile that could carry a W39 thermonuclear warhead. Though the Snark was in training by the United States Air Force&#x27;s Strategic Air Command from 1958 through 1961, it was only deployed as an operational missile for less than a year during 1961. It represented an important step in weapons technology during the Cold War. The Snark was named by Jack Northrop and took its name from the author Lewis Carroll&#x27;s character the &quot;snark&quot;. The Snark was the only surface-to-surface cruise missile with such a long range that was ever deployed by the U.S. Air Force. Following the deployment of ICBMs, the Snark was rendered obsolete, and it was removed from deployment in 1961.

==Design and development==

Project Mastiff, to create a missile for delivery for an atom bomb began immediately after the existence of the atomic bomb was revealed. Due to protracted security concerns of the Manhattan Project the Army Air Force’s new Project Mastiff was a years long “Fiasco” Despite the failure of Project Mastiff the Army Air Force started a group of programs intended to create atomic bomb carrying missiles.

During the significant first decade of American strategic missile development the Air Force’s attention was upon developing air-breathing missiles. Designations for individual programs changed over time and thus they are best known by their MX numbers. Following the end of WWII the Guided Missile Committee decided that the development of guided missiles should be shifted from the existing ad hoc programs in order to concentrate upon basic research. Northrop was selected to study two concepts, the sub-sonic MX-775A Snark, and the super-sonic MX775B &quot;Boojum&quot;. The defense budget cuts of what was called the Black Christmas of 1946 drastically reduced the number of Army missile programs. Few of those programs which survived resembled the later missiles which they eventually produced. In March 1947 the MX-775B Boojum supersonic 5,000 mile range and not the subsonic MX-775A Snark was the only Northrop program. By March 1948 the MX-775A Snark was the preferred missile while the super-sonic MX-775B Boojum had been reduced in importance to a speculative prospect. Further intense budgetary pressure in 1949 saw the USAF surface to surface missile program reduced to two programs of which one was the MX-775A Snark. By July 1950 the Snark program was further reduced to development of the guidance subsystem and creation of a guidance test vehicle. The guidance test missile was the Northrop N-25. Development of the heavy stellar navigation system intended for the N-25 Snark was very difficult and required many hundreds of hours of flight aboard aircraft. Twenty-one flights of the N-25 occurred at Holloman AFB, New Mexico between April 1951 and March 1952.

A new requirement for intercontinental range required a new, larger missile. The resulting Northrop N-69 was originally powered by a J71 engine and in later variants a J57. While 10 of 25 N-25 missiles were recovered, only 11 of 39 N-69s were recovered. As the available space for tests of an intercontinental ranged missile did not exist at Holloman, testing was moved to the Atlantic Missile Test Range at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Test Snarks were recovered to a runway at the Joint Long Range Proving Ground which is still known as the &quot;Skid Strip&quot;. Unfortunately facilities at Cape Canaveral were still being constructed at the same time aerodynamic problems with the intended dive by the Snark on the target persisted, delaying development.

The Snark, which was originally projected to become operational in 1953, suffered a protracted test program which involved significant redesigns. Development of the N-69 dragged on with many failures which caused wags to jest of the “Snark Infested Waters” off Cape Canaveral. As the prospective operational date of the Snark slipped continuously into the future, Strategic Air Command (SAC) grew more skeptical of the missile. Criticism of the Snark grew from doubts by SAC in 1951 to serious objections in 1954. A high-level study by the Teapot Committee in early 1954 described the nascent Atlas ICBM project as beset by technical and administrative problems while advising that the ballistic missile offered the best means of delivering a thermonuclear weapon over intercontinental range. Also in early 1954 the Strategic Missile Evaluation Committee concluded that the Snark was an “overly complex” and would not become operational until “substantially later” than scheduled.

The failure of the Snark to achieve the necessary accuracy for the original W-8 nuclear weapon (striking within of target) was offset somewhat by the change to the much more powerful W-39-Y1 Mod 1 thermonuclear bomb (striking within of target). Extensive flight testing, weight reduction efforts, an improved 24 hour stellar navigation system, and the addition of pylon fuel tanks below the wings to restore range capabilities eventually resulted in the N-69E Snark which became the prototype for the SM-62 Intercontinental Missile (ICM)

By late 1957 N-69E Snarks had complete two flights down range to Ascension Island, showing the Snark achieved an estimated circular error probable (CEP) of . By 1958, the celestial navigation system used by the Snark allowed its most accurate test, which appeared to fall wide of the target. However, even with the decreased CEP, the design was notoriously unreliable, with the majority of tests suffering mechanical failure thousands of miles before reaching the target. Other factors, such as the reduction in operating altitude from , and the inability of the Snark to detect countermeasures and perform evasive maneuvers also made it a questionable strategic deterrent. A total of 97 N-25, N69 and SM-62 Snarks tests were made between December 1950 and December 1960. SAC then changed requirements to require the launch of 20% of Snarks within 15 minutes of notification, 40% within 75 minutes, and all in four hours. A daunting requirement given the base design and requirements of the missile.

In late 1957 SAC’s 556 Strategic Missile Squadron launched its first N-69E to begin the Snark Employment and Suitability Test program. In December 1957 the 556th Strategic Missile Squadron was activated and began training to launch operational SM-62 Snark Missiles. In January 1958, SAC began accepting delivery of Snark missiles at Patrick Air Force Base for training, and in 1959, the 702d Strategic Missile Wing was formed. Snark launches for developmental purposes continued through 1958 but the training activities of the 556th were reduced. Training of Snark missile men at the Cape continued until December 1959.

From December 1950 until December 1960 118 N-25, N-69 and SM-62 test flights were made.

===Technical description===

The jet propelled, long Snark missile had a top speed of about and a maximum range of about . Its complicated celestial navigation system gave it a claimed CEP of about .

The Snark was an air-breathing missile, intended to be launched from a truck-mounted platform by two solid-fueled rocket booster engines. The Snark was propelled by an internal turbojet engine for the rest of its flight. The engine was a Pratt and Whitney J57, which was the first jet engine featuring a thrust of or more.
Since the Snark lacked a horizontal tail surface, it used elevons as its primary flight control surfaces, and it flew with an unusual nose-high angle during level flight. During the final phase of its flight, its nuclear warhead would have separated from its fuselage and then followed a ballistic trajectory towards its target. Due to the sudden shift in its center of gravity caused by separation, the fuselage would have performed an abrupt pitch-up maneuver in order to avoid a collision with the warhead. The resulting break-up of the missiles structure added clutter which confused enemy radar.

==Operational history==
In May 1957, a Detachment of Air Force instructors was formed at Amarillo Air Force Base, Texas as the first cadre of Air Force personnel supporting an Intercontinental missile system. None of the detachment members had any previous training or experience in missile maintenance. They were trained at the Northrop factory in California and then returned to Amarillo to establish the training school for the Snark maintenance personnel.

On January 1, 1959 the 702nd Strategic Missile Wing was activated at Presque Isle, Maine. On 27 May 1959, Presque Isle Air Force Base, Maine, the only Snark missile base, received its first missile. It was ten months before the 702nd placed its first Snark on Alert on March 18, 1960. The first far superior Atlas D had already gone on Alert on October 31, 1957. Exercises in 1960 indicated that only 20% of the missiles at Presque Isle met SAC standards of effectiveness. Reliability improved over time with reliability achieving 95% in February 1961.

The 702nd Wing was not declared to be fully operational until February 1961. A total of 30 Snarks were deployed to the USAF&#x27;s first and only long-range cruise missile base. The duration of the SM-62 in active service was brief before the reality which had haunted the program since the Teapot Committee caught up with it. In March 1961, President John F. Kennedy declared the Snark to be &quot;obsolete and of marginal military value&quot;, and on 25 June 1961, the 702nd Wing was inactivated.

Many in the U.S. Military were surprised the Snark, due to its dubious guidance system, was ever operational. The most accurate of the seven full-range flights from June 1958 and May 1959 had fallen left of and short the target. In flight tests many were lost. A missile launched from Cape Canaveral in 1956 that was supposed to fly to Puerto Rico and back, flew so far off course that it was last seen on radar off the coast of Venezuela. The wreckage of the wayward Snark missile was found in northeastern Brazil in 1983. Many of those connected with the program commented in jest &quot;that the Caribbean was full of &#x27;Snark infested waters&#x27;.&quot; The Snark suffered from deficiencies in missile technology, design, and development which delayed its entry into service until it had been overtaken by development of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. The ICBM was capable of delivering the same thermonuclear weapon over the same distance much faster and without possibility of interception.

<text>The National Assembly (, &quot;Majlis al-ʾUmma&quot;) is the unicameral legislature of Kuwait. The National Assembly meets in the National Assembly building in Kuwait City. The National Assembly is made up of 50 elected members and 16 directly appointed government ministers (ex officio members).

The assembly was frequently dissolved by the Emir of Kuwait. From 2006 to 2024, the assembly was dissolved 13 times. The assembly has been suspended since 10 May 2024 for a four-year constitutional re-evaluation due to frequent inaction, corruption, bribery, vote purchasing and political deadlock.

==Overview==
The National Assembly is the legislature in Kuwait, established in 1963. Its predecessor, the 1938 National Assembly, was formally dissolved in 1939 after &quot;one member, Sulaiman al-Adasani, in possession of a letter, signed by other Assembly members, addressed to Iraq&#x27;s King Ghazi, requesting Kuwait&#x27;s immediate incorporation into Iraq.&quot; This demand came after the merchant members of the Assembly attempted to extract oil money from Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, a suggestion refused by him and upon which he instigated a crackdown which arrested the Assembly members in 1939.

The National Assembly normally consists of 65 members; this total includes 50 elected deputies as well as 15 cabinet members directly appointed by the Emir. Fifty deputies are elected by one non-transferable vote to serve four-year terms. Members of the cabinet also sit in the parliament as deputies. The constitution limits the size of the cabinet to 16. The cabinet ministers have the same rights as the elected MPs, with the following two exceptions: they do not participate in the work of committees, and they cannot vote when an interpolation leads to a no-confidence vote against one of the cabinet members. As per Article 107 of the Kuwait constitution, the National Assembly can be dissolved by the Emir by decree, giving the reasons for the dissolution. However, the National Assembly shall not be dissolved again on the same grounds, and elections for the new Assembly must be held within a period not exceeding two months from the date of the dissolution. 

In contrast to parliaments in other Gulf kingdoms, the Kuwaiti assembly has considerably more formal and informal power than elsewhere in the region.

The assembly was previously suspended from 1976-1981 and 1986-1991.

===Gender balance===
Kuwaiti women gained the right to vote in 2005. Women first won seats in the National Assembly in the 2009 election, in which four women, Aseel al-Awadhi, Rola Dashti, Massouma al-Mubarak and Salwa al-Jassar, were elected.

==Building==

The parliament building was designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon, who also designed the Sydney Opera House.

==Political factions==
While political parties are not legal in Kuwait, a number of political factions existed. The house was composed of different political factions:

* The liberal bloc.
* The Shaabi (populist) bloc: A coalition of populists (Sunni and Shia), liberals and nationalist political organizations with a focus on middle-class issues. The Popular Action Bloc is their main political organization.
* The Islamist bloc: Consisting of Sunni Islamist members.

Kuwait&#x27;s 2024 elections witnessed an increase in voter turnout.

<text>Mititaiagimene Young Vivian (born 12 November 1935) is a Niuean politician and diplomat, who served as Premier of Niue twice, the first time from December 1992 to March 1993 following the death of Sir Robert Rex, and the second from 2002 to 2008. He also served as a Cabinet Minister multiple times, first as Minister of Education, Economic Development and Agriculture and later as Minister of Finance under Robert Rex, and in the Cabinet of Sani Lakatani. From 1979 to 1982 he served as Secretary-General of the South Pacific Commission.

==Early life==
Vivian attended primary school on Niue, before going to New Zealand for his secondary education. He was educated at St George&#x27;s Preparatory School in Wanganui from 1949, and then Wanganui Collegiate School as a boarder between 1951 and 1954. After completing teacher training at Ardmore Teachers&#x27; College, Vivian returned to Niue and worked as a teacher for almost 10 years. He then took a course on the teaching of English as a second language at Victoria University of Wellington, and returned again to Niue in 1969.

==Early political career==
Vivian was first elected to the Niue Assembly in the 1969 general election and appointed to the Executive Council, serving as Member of Education in Robert Rex&#x27;s pre-independence government. Vivian was re-elected at the 1972 election, and was part of the team which negotiated Niue&#x27;s independence. He was re-elected at the 1975 election and reappointed as Minister for Education, Agriculture, and Economic Development, but lost the Tourism portfolio to Frank Lui.

In 1978, Vivian was elected Secretary-General of the South Pacific Commission, giving up his position as a Minister to take the job. He served in the role from 1979 to 1982, after which he worked as a cultural officer for the Niuean Government. In 1984 he was back in the Legislative Assembly, but was not reappointed to Cabinet. In an early speech, he denounced the decolonisation process as being forced on Niue, and attacked New Zealand for its lack of assistance following independence. In 1985, when Premier Robert Rex talked of retirement, he was seen as a likely successor.

==Leader of the opposition and first Premiership==
Vivian was re-elected in the 1987 election, and became leader of the new Niue People&#x27;s Action Party (NPAP). As leader of the opposition, he led a confidence vote against Rex in 1989, which while unsuccessful, saw three government MP&#x27;s cross the floor. At the 1990 election the NPAP gained 12 of 20 seats, giving it a majority, but a dispute over the leadership between Vivian and newly elected MP Sani Lakatani saw Rex lure a group of MPs led by the latter switch sides, and Rex won the premiership on a 12–8 vote. Less than six months later Lakatani was sacked from Cabinet after attempting to oust Rex, and Vivian was appointed as Minister of Finance, Education, and Administration in his place. He later served as acting Premier during Rex&#x27;s illness, and following his death in December 1992, was elected Premier. He was re-elected to the Assembly at the 1993 election, but lost the Premiership to Frank Lui 11 votes to 9.

==Second opposition period==
After losing the Premiership, Vivian became leader of the Opposition again. In 1995 he allied with Sani Lakatani, who had once again been dismissed from Cabinet, to effectively deadlock Parliament, preventing any legislation from being passed. An attempt by the government to break the deadlock by declaring the seats of opposition MPs vacant was ultimately declared illegal by the Niue Court of Appeal. The deadlock was finally broken when Vivian agreed that the NPP would support the government&#x27;s budget in an effort to avoid an early election.

Vivian was re-elected unopposed at the 1996 election, but did not stand for Premier.

==Cabinet and second Premiership==
The renamed Niue People&#x27;s Party won a majority at the 1999 election, and Sani Lakatani was elected Premier. Vivian was appointed to Cabinet as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Education.

Vivian was returned unopposed at the 2002 election and elected leader of the NPP in place of Lakatani. He was subsequently elected premier, defeating Hunukitama Hunuki by 14 votes to 6. He appointed Lakatani as his Deputy, but fired him just three months later after he voted against the budget. As premier he arranged direct flights to Niue by Polynesian Airlines to boost tourism, negotiated for European Union funding for renewable energy, and negotiated for greater New Zealand assistance. A proposal to allow immigration from Tonga and Samoa if Niueans did not return from New Zealand proved unpopular.

In January 2004 Vivian&#x27;s wife, Leone Tofuola Vivian, died after a long illness in New Zealand. While Vivian was still in Auckland, Niue was struck by Cyclone Heta which destroyed the capital Alofi and the island&#x27;s only hospital. The government was heavily criticised over its reconstruction efforts, particularly the distribution of aid and allocation of new houses.

He was again re-elected unopposed in the 2005 election and re-elected Premier, defeating O&#x27;Love Jacobsen 17 votes to 3. His 2005 budget cut spending, and in December 2005 a leaked government report revealed that Niue was virtually bankrupt. A further report in 2006 revealed further financial difficulties and that cyclone aid had been used to prop up the government&#x27;s accounts. New Zealand provided funds for a bailout, but Vivian&#x27;s government cut public services and imposed user-pays charges to balance the books. Vivian was accused of economic mismanagement, but survived a confidence vote. The financial problems were temporarily solved with $750,000 obtained on an official visit to China. A proposal to introduce a goods and services tax was rejected by the Assembly.

He was again re-elected unopposed to Parliament in the 2008 elections, but lost the Premiership to Toke Talagi, who won fourteen votes to Vivian&#x27;s five, and one abstaining.

==Later life==
In the 2017 general election, Vivian lost the Hakupu seat to Michael Jackson. At the 2020 general election, Vivian stood for election to one of the six common roll seats, but was unsuccessful.

In December 2021, Vivian was evacuated by air ambulance from Niue to New Zealand for medical treatment.

==Honours and awards==

At the inaugural Niue National Awards in 2020, Vivian was awarded the Niue Distinguished Service Cross. He was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2023 New Year Honours, for services to Niue.

<doc id="428484" wikidata="Q2995274" url="?curid=428484" title="Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers">
<text>In set theory, several ways have been proposed to construct the natural numbers. These include the representation via von Neumann ordinals, commonly employed in axiomatic set theory, and a system based on equinumerosity that was proposed by Gottlob Frege and by Bertrand Russell.

== Definition as von Neumann ordinals ==

In Zermelo–Fraenkel (ZF) set theory, the natural numbers are defined recursively by letting be the empty set and for each &quot;n&quot;. In this way for each natural number &quot;n&quot;. This definition has the property that &quot;n&quot; is a set with &quot;n&quot; elements. The first few numbers defined this way are: 

:formula_1

The set &quot;N&quot; of natural numbers is defined in this system as the smallest set containing 0 and closed under the successor function &quot;S&quot; defined by . The structure is a model of the Peano axioms . The existence of the set &quot;N&quot; is equivalent to the axiom of infinity in ZF set theory.

The set &quot;N&quot; and its elements, when constructed this way, are an initial part of the von Neumann ordinals. Quine refer to these sets as &quot;counter sets&quot;.

== Frege and Russell ==

Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell each proposed defining a natural number &quot;n&quot; as the collection of all sets with &quot;n&quot; elements. More formally, a natural number is an equivalence class of finite sets under the equivalence relation of equinumerosity. This definition may appear circular, but it is not, because equinumerosity can be defined in alternate ways, for instance by saying that two sets are equinumerous if they can be put into one-to-one correspondence—this is sometimes known as Hume&#x27;s principle.

This definition works in type theory, and in set theories that grew out of type theory, such as New Foundations and related systems. However, it does not work in the axiomatic set theory ZFC nor in certain related systems, because in such systems the equivalence classes under equinumerosity are proper classes rather than sets. However, cardinals can be defined in ZF using Scott&#x27;s trick.

For enabling natural numbers to form a set, equinumerous classes are replaced by special sets, named cardinal. The simplest way to introduce cardinals is to add a primitive notion, Card(), and an axiom of cardinality to ZF set theory (without axiom of choice). 

Axiom of cardinality: The sets A and B are equinumerous if and only if Card(A) = Card(B)

Definition: the sum of cardinals K and L such as K= Card(A) and L = Card(B) where the sets A and B are disjoint, is Card (A ∪ B).

The definition of a finite set is given independently of natural numbers:

Definition: A set is finite if and only if any non empty family of its subsets has a minimal element for the inclusion order. 

Definition: a cardinal n is a natural number if and only if there exists a finite set of which the cardinal is n.

0 = Card (∅) 

1 = Card({A}) = Card({∅})

Definition: the successor of a cardinal K is the cardinal K + 1

Theorem: the natural numbers satisfy Peano’s axioms

== Hatcher ==

William S. Hatcher (1982) derives Peano&#x27;s axioms from several foundational systems, including ZFC and category theory, and from the system of Frege&#x27;s &quot;Grundgesetze der Arithmetik&quot; using modern notation and natural deduction. The Russell paradox proved this system inconsistent, but George Boolos (1998) and David J. Anderson and Edward Zalta (2004) show how to repair it.

<text>Jilava is a commune in Ilfov County, Muntenia, Romania, near Bucharest. It is composed of a single village, Jilava.

The name derives from a Romanian word of Slavic origin (Bulgarian жилав &quot;žilav&quot; (tough), which passed into Romanian as &quot;jilav&quot;) meaning &quot;humid place&quot;.

In this commune there is an operating prison and also the Fort 13 Jilava.

==Fort 13 Jilava==

Jilava was the location of a fort built by King Carol I of Romania, as part of the capital&#x27;s defense system. At a later date, the fort was converted into a prison. Jilava Prison is now a historical monument.

This prison is the site where, on November 26–27, 1940, the Iron Guard authorities of the National Legionary State killed 64 political prisoners as revenge for the previous killing of their leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu (see &quot;Jilava Massacre&quot;); it was also here that Ion Antonescu, dictator (&quot;Conducător&quot;) of Romania during World War II, was executed for war crimes in 1946 and where on 23 October 1971 the serial killer, Ion Rîmaru was executed by firing squad.

The prison also was a detention site for political prisoners after the start of Communist rule in Romania. According to a study done by the International Centre for Studies into Communism, 36.1% of all such prisoners did some time at Jilava Prison. Among the political prisoners detained at Jilava were Corneliu Coposu, Richard Wurmbrand, Gen. Radu Korne, Gen. Nicolae Ciupercă, and Gen. Radu R. Rosetti, as well as Gheorghe Arsenescu, Gen. Radu Băldescu, Aristide Blank, Matei Boilă, Victor Cădere, Gen. Dumitru Carlaonț, Gen. Dumitru Coroamă, Gen. Nicolae Dăscălescu, Gen. Ioan Dumitrache, Anton Durcovici, Radu Filipescu, Paul Goma, Iuliu Hirțea, Iuliu Hossu, Ion Ioanid, George Ivașcu, Adm. Horia Macellariu, Mihail Manoilescu, Gen. Gheorghe Manoliu, Gen. Ion Negoițescu, Constantin Noica, Ovidiu Papadima, Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu, Gherman Pântea, I. Peltz, Nicolae Penescu, Constantin Titel Petrescu, Gen.

<doc id="428496" wikidata="Q7691316" url="?curid=428496" title="Teaching stories">
<text>A teaching story is a narrative that has been deliberately created as a vehicle for the transmission of wisdom. The practice has been used in a number of religious and other traditions, though writer Idries Shah&#x27;s use of it was in the context of Sufi teaching and learning, within which this body of material has been described as the &quot;most valuable of the treasures in the human heritage&quot;. The range of teaching stories is enormous, including anecdotes, accounts of meetings between teachers and pupils, biographies, myths, fairy tales, fables and jokes. Such stories frequently have a long life beyond the initial teaching situation and (sometimes in deteriorated form) have contributed vastly to the world&#x27;s store of folklore and literature.

==Function==
It is the teaching function of teaching stories that characterises them rather than any other categorisation, however much they may have other uses. Shah likened the Sufi story to a peach:

:&quot;A person may be emotionally stirred by the exterior as if the peach were lent to you. You can eat the peach and taste a further delight ... You can throw away the stone – or crack it and find a delicious kernel within. This is the hidden depth.&quot;

Thus these narratives also often have a wide circulation outside of any instructional function, where they frequently have cultural significance and entertainment value, or contain a moral answer or solution of some kind, or are put to use to reinforce belief. What makes them distinctively teaching stories however is something different: they are likely to be open-ended, depending on the individual members of their audience for a variety of interpretations. Their purpose is ultimately to change the thinking process itself. They put at the disposal of those who know them an instrument for measuring themselves, the world and situations that they encounter. It is for this reason that the reading, rereading, discussion and interpretation of narratives in a group setting became a significant part of the activities in which the members of Shah&#x27;s study circles engaged.

According to Doris Lessing:
:&quot;A real teaching story, whether thousands of years old, or new, goes far beyond the parables that are still part of our culture. A parable has a simple message: this means that. But in a Sufi teaching story, there may be layers of meaning, some of them not to be verbalized. Current ways of &quot;teaching&quot; literature in schools and universities may make it difficult for literary people to approach Sufi literature as it should be: Sufis do not pull apart a tale to find its meaning, but cite the case of the child who has dismantled a fly and, left with a heap of wings, a head, legs, asks &quot;Where is the fly?&quot; In other words, a student learns to use the mind in ways unfamiliar to us. They &quot;soak themselves&quot; in the material. They ignore the analytical approach, and the practice of memorizing and regurgitating. The meaning of a Sufi tale comes through contemplation, and may take years.&quot;

==Folktales==
Shah described many of the folktales widely dispersed across the world as teaching stories, writing in the introduction to one such tale, The Lost Camel, collected in his &quot;World Tales&quot;:

:&quot;Most of the instrumental and interpretative function of the folktale have tended to be overlooked in the literature, which still usually concentrates upon origins, upon fragmentary beliefs enshrined in the tales, and upon the light which is cast by plots and treatments on the attitudes of the people among whom the story is told.&quot; 

Without denying the entertainment or moral value in the stories, Shah emphasised that there is in such tales an often hidden dimension of instruction. Stories, such as those from the Thousand and One Nights and other collections of traditional myths and folktales, are considered to fall into this category. Modern examples (although maybe not generally recognized as such) are some of the stories that have been retold and adapted by Disney. These tales have been adapted and laid out in the simplest form of their wisdom, making them easily accessible for children in particular. As Robert Ornstein has written:

:&quot;On the surface teaching stories often appear to be little more than fairy or folk tales. But they are designed to embody - in their characters, plots and imagery - patterns and relationships that nurture a part of the mind that is unreachable in more direct ways, thus increasing our understanding and breadth of vision, in addition to fostering our ability to think critically.&quot;

==Fables==
Though a &quot;moral&quot; is appended to many fables, for instance the fables of Aesop, Shah insisted that there were levels of meaning hidden in them that lay beyond the merely didactic:
:&quot;The fables of all nations provide a really remarkable example of this, because, if you can understand them at a technical level, they provide the most striking evidence of the persistence of a consistent teaching, preserved sometimes through mere repetition, yet handed down and prized simply because they give a stimulus to the imagination or entertainment for the people at large.&quot;

== Nasrudin stories ==
Shah published four books of tales of the Mulla Nasrudin. These stories are known throughout the Muslim world. Superficially, most of the stories may be told as jokes. They are told and retold endlessly in the teahouses and caravanserais of Asia and can be heard in homes and on the radio. But it is inherent in a Nasrudin story that it may be understood at many levels. There is the joke, but there is also the structure of the tale that functions as an analogy or metaphor for some aspect of human nature or learning.

==Worldwide dispersal and diffusion==
It is impossible to say how far back in time teaching stories go. Shah&#x27;s collection &quot;World Tales&quot; includes the Tale of Two Brothers, an ancient Egyptian story from around the 12th century BC. Jataka tales from India as far back as the 3rd century BC have travelled westwards via the Panchatantra and have long been recognised as having a teaching function. An example is The Tiger, the Brahmin and the Jackal which made its first appearance In Europe some 900 years ago in Petrus Alphonsi&#x27;s collection of tales, the &quot;Disciplina Clericalis&quot; (which, according to E.L. Ranelagh, could be translated as &quot;a course of study for the reader&quot;).

The blind men and an elephant is a well-known tale that has been used among Jainists, Buddhists and Hindus in India, as well as by Persian Sufi writers Sanai of Ghazni, Attar of Nishapur and Rumi. Shah&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Dervishes&quot;, a collection of narratives gathered from classical Sufi texts and oral sources spanning a period from the 7th to the 20th centuries, gives Sanai&#x27;s version.

Parallels with other religious traditions are obvious, wherever narratives are used instructionally rather than to generate or perpetuate belief or conformity. Examples might be Zen koans, Hasidic tales, and the parables of Jesus. Sometimes, as in The Tiger, the Brahmin and the Jackal or The Blind men and an elephant, versions of the same story are put to use.

<text>Sir Robert Richmond Rex (25 January 190912 December 1992) was the first Premier of the Pacific island state of Niue.

==Early life and family==
Rex was born to parents Leslie Lucas Richmond Rex, a European trader on Niue, and Fisimonomono Tufaina of Avatele Village in the south of Niue. He later settled down in Alofi, the capital of Niue, with his wife of that village, Patricia Rex, (1918–2004).

Rex was the great uncle of the rugby player Frank Bunce.

==Political career==
Rex was Premier of Niue from its establishment as a self-governing territory on 19 October 1974 until his death in 1992. Upon his death in office, he was succeeded by Mititaiagimene Young Vivian, until General Elections the following year resulted in the election of Frank Fakaotimanava Lui into office. Having served 18 years in office, he is Niue&#x27;s longest serving Premier.

Although Rex was opposed to party politics on Niue, he was supported by the Niue People&#x27;s Action Party after its formation in 1987. During his almost two decades in office, Rex held virtually all Government ministerial portfolios from time to time. His Cabinet of Ministers included prominent Niuean figures such as Dr Enetama Lipitoa, Mititaiagimene Young Vivian and Frank Fakaotimanava Lui, the latter two also going on to become Premiers of Niue.

==Honours==
In the 1973 New Year Honours, Rex was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for valuable services to the people of Niue. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1977 Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee and Birthday Honours.

Rex was the first Niuean to receive a knighthood, being appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1984 New Year Honours.
