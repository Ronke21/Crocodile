<text>A political realignment is a set of sharp changes in party related ideology, issues, leaders, regional bases, demographic bases, and/or the structure of powers within a government. Often also referred to as a critical election, critical realignment, or realigning election, in the academic fields of political science and political history. These changes result in a restructuring of political focus and power that lasts for decades, usually replacing an older dominant coalition. Scholars frequently invoke the concept in American elections as this is where it is most common, though the experience also does occur in governments across the globe. It is generally accepted that the United States has had five distinct party systems, each featuring two major parties attracting a consistent political coalition and following a consistent party ideology, separated by four realignments. Two of the most apparent examples include the 1896 United States presidential election, when the issues of the American Civil War political system were replaced with those of the Populist and Progressive Era. As well as the 1932 United States presidential election, when the issues of the Populist and Progressive Eras were replaced by New Deal liberalism and modern conservatism. Realigning elections also contribute significantly to realigning (what are known in the field of comparative politics as) party systems—with 1828, for example, separating the First Party System and the Second Party System in the US.

Political realignments can be sudden (1–4 years) or can take place more gradually (5–20 years). Most often, as demonstrated in V. O. Key Jr.&#x27;s (1955) original hypothesis, a single &quot;critical election&quot; marks a sudden realignment. However he also argued that a cyclical process of realignment exists, wherein political views within interests groups gradually begin to separate which he designated as &quot;secular realignment&quot;. Political scientists and historians often disagree about which elections are realignments and what defines a realignment, and even whether realignments occur. The terms themselves are somewhat arbitrary, however, and usage among political scientists and historians does vary. In the US, Walter Dean Burnham argued for a 30–38 year &quot;cycle&quot; of realignments. Many of the elections often included in the Burnham 38-year cycle are considered &quot;realigning&quot; for different reasons.

Other political scientists and quantitative elections analysts reject realignment theory altogether, arguing that there are no long-term patterns. Political scientist David R. Mayhew states, &quot;Elections and their underlying causes are not usefully sortable into generation-long spans ... It is too slippery, too binary, too apocalyptic, and it has come to be too much of a dead end.&quot; Sean Trende, senior elections analyst at &quot;RealClearPolitics&quot;, also argues against the realignment theory and the &quot;emerging Democratic majority&quot; thesis proposed by journalist John Judis and political scientist Ruy Teixeira. In his 2012 book &quot;The Lost Majority,&quot; Trende states, &quot;Almost none of the theories propounded by realignment theorists has endured the test of time... It turns out that finding a &#x27;realigning&#x27; election is a lot like finding an image of Jesus in a grilled-cheese sandwich – if you stare long enough and hard enough, you will eventually find what you are looking for.&quot; In August 2013, Trende observed that U.S. presidential election results from 1880 through 2012 form a 0.96 correlation with the expected sets of outcomes (i.e. events) in the binomial distribution of a fair coin flip experiment. In May 2015, statistician and &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; editor-in-chief Nate Silver argued against a blue wall Electoral College advantage for the Democratic Party in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and in post-election analysis, Silver cited Trende in noting that &quot;there are few if any permanent majorities&quot; and both Silver and Trende argued that the &quot;emerging Democratic majority&quot; thesis led most news coverage and commentary preceding the election to overstate Hillary Clinton&#x27;s chances of being elected.

==Realignment theory==
The central holding of realignment theory, first developed in the political scientist V. O. Key Jr.&#x27;s 1955 article, &quot;A Theory of Critical Elections&quot;, is that American elections, parties and policymaking routinely shift in swift, dramatic sweeps as well as slow, gradual movements. 

V. O. Key Jr., E. E. Schattschneider, James L. Sundquist, Walter Dean Burnham are generally credited with developing and refining the theory of realignment. Though they differed on some of the details, earlier realignments scholars generally concluded that systematic patterns are identifiable in American national elections. Such that cycles occur on a regular schedule: once every 36-years or so. This period of roughly 30 years fits with the notion that these cycles are closely linked to generational change. However later scholars, such as Shafer and Reichley, argue that the patterns are longer, closer to 50 to 60 years in duration. Pointing to the Democratic dominance from 1800 to 1860, and Republican rule from 1860 to 1932 as examples, Reichley argues that the only true realigning elections occurred in these 60 year periods. Given the much longer length of time since the last generally accepted realignment in 1932, more recent scholars have theorized that realignments don&#x27;t in fact operate on any consistent time scale, but rather occur whenever the necessary political, social, and economic changes occur.

===Voter realignments===
A central component of realignment is the change in behavior of voting groups. Realignment within the context of voting relates to the switching of voter preferences from one party to another. This is in contrast to dealignment where a voter group abandons a party due to voter apathy or to become independent. In the US and Australia, as the ideologies of the parties define many of the aspects of voters&#x27; lives and the decisions that they make, a realignment by a voter tends to have a longer-lasting effect.

In Britain, Canada, and other countries the phenomenon of political realignment is not as drastic. Due to the multi-party system, voters have a tendency to switch parties on a whim, perhaps only for one election, as there is far less loyalty towards one particular party.

== Cultural Issues ==
The major political parties in the United States have held the same name for over a century, yet there is no doubt that their values and intentions have changed. While realignment is caused by various reasons, one of the largest factors is cultural issues. The culture of a population is altered over time as technology advances, needs change, and values evolve. With this shift, a population&#x27;s views and desires will also change, thus resulting in parties realigning to be relevant to present topics.

In recent years, the LGBTQ community has become a growing factor in politics around the world. Their increasing presence has created many important concerns that are more widespread and broadcast than they once would have been. These issues and concerns are acknowledged by political parties, thus creating small shifts and realignments. For example, in 2022, there were 315 bills introduced to various state legislatures across the United States that were found to be anti-LGBTQ. Out of these 315, 29 of them were signed into the state&#x27;s law. These new laws will ultimately lead to public divergence and political realignment as parties support different values. This shows the reality of cultural changes (publicized LGBTQ presence) and it&#x27;s correlation to not only rights and politics, but the reality of political parties shifting to adhere to certain values and goals regarding a specific social issue. 

While further discussing evolving social issues and it&#x27;s relation to party realignment, the growing issue of abortion has been found in relevancy to newly found party values. These values which differentiate between certain parties can be attributed to federal abortion policies, which have been altered, fought for, and lost, thus creating a mass social issue. Since Roe v. Wade, abortion has largely become a major aspect of US politics. Furthermore, the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization case has sparked further issues in the US political scene, as it overturned the constitutional right of abortion that was granted from Roe v. Wade, in 1973. The issue of abortion, state restrictions, and overturning of federal funding for procedures has created a political uproar in the US. For example, many state legislatures, members of congress, and other politically powered members have created restrictions on insurance, funding, and the overall accessibility of having an abortion. These actions have created the movement of activists to fight for the right of abortion. Furthermore, this battle has caused political parties to acknowledge the cause, determine their stance, and realign overall.

===Political realignment in United States history===

* 1800 presidential election — Thomas Jefferson
** This election completed the turnover of power in the First Party System from the Federalist Party, led by Alexander Hamilton, to Jefferson and his Democratic-Republican Party. The center of power shifted from New England to the South and Jeffersonian democracy became the dominant ideology.
** Republicans gained 19.7% of House seats in 1800, 9.4% in 1802 and 9.7% in 1804, for a total gain of 38.8% in 3 elections.
** As late as 1812, the Federalists came within one state of winning. A larger shift in electoral politics arguably came in the 1812–1816 period, as the Federalists became discredited after opposing the War of 1812.
* 1828 presidential election — Andrew Jackson
** This election redefined the party system in the United States, setting up the Second Party System, which was dominated by Jacksonian democracy. The Democratic-Republicans split into two parties, later renamed as the Democratic Party and the Whig Party. The Democrats were led by Andrew Jackson of Tennessee and Martin Van Buren of New York. By 1834 the Whigs emerged as the opposition to Andrew Jackson, led by Henry Clay of Kentucky.
* 1860 presidential election — Abraham Lincoln
** After the Whigs collapsed after 1852, party alignments were in turmoil, with several third parties, such as the Know Nothings and the Opposition Party. The system stabilized in 1858 and the presidential election marked the ascendence of the Republican Party. Abraham Lincoln beat out three other contenders — but even if they had somehow united he still had the majority of the electoral vote. The Republican party was pledged to the long-term ending of slavery, which was proximate cause of secession. Republicans rallied around nationalism in 1861 and fought the American Civil War to end secession. During the war the Republicans, under Lincoln&#x27;s leadership, switched to a goal of short-term ending of slavery. By 1864, the Republicans had a coalition built around followers of the &quot;free labor&quot; ideology, as well as soldiers and veterans of the Union Army. (Since then, the military establishment has favored the Republicans.)
*** The Republican Party went from 18.3% of the House in 1854, to 38.0% in 1856, 48.7% in 1858, and 59.0% in 1860, for a total gain of 40.7% in 4 elections.
* 1896 presidential election — William McKinley
** The status of this election is hotly disputed; some political scientists, such as Jerome Clubb, do not consider it a realigning election. Other political scientists and historians, such as Kleppner and Burnham consider this the ultimate realignment and emphasize that the rules of the game had changed, the leaders were new, voting alignments had changed, and a whole new set of issues came to dominance as the old Civil War-era issues faded away. Funding from office holders was replaced by outside fund raising from business in 1896 — a major shift in political history. Furthermore, McKinley&#x27;s tactics in beating William Jennings Bryan (as developed by Mark Hanna) marked a sea change in the evolution of the modern campaign. McKinley raised a huge amount of money from business interests, outspending Bryan by 10 to 1. Bryan meanwhile invented the modern technique of campaigning heavily in closely contested states, the first candidate to do so. Bryan&#x27;s message of populism and class conflict marked a new direction for the Democrats. McKinley&#x27;s victory in 1896 and repeat in 1900 was a triumph for pluralism, as all sectors and groups shared in the new prosperity brought about by his policy of rapid industrial growth.
** While Republicans lost House seats in 1896, this followed a massive two-election gain: from 25.9% in 1890 to 34.8% in 1892 and 71.1% in 1894, for a total 45.2% gain. Republicans lost 13.4% in 1896, but still held 57.7% of House seats.
** In terms of correlations among counties, the election of 1896 is a realignment flop, but this is only a problem if realignment is considered to occur in single elections. Rather, if realignment is thought of as a generational or long-term political movement, then change will occur over several elections, even if there is one &quot;critical&quot; election defining the new alignment. So, as pointed out above, the 1896 realignment really began around 1892, and the 130 seat GOP gain in 1894, the all-record for a house election, meant there were almost no seats left to pick up in 1896. However, the presidential election in 1896 is usually considered the start of the new alignment since the national election allowed the nation to make a more conscious decision about the future of industrial policy by selecting McKinley over Bryan, making this the defining election in the realignment. The election of 1876 passes the numbers test much better compared to 1896 alone, and Mayhew (2004) argues it resulted in far more drastic changes in United States politics: Reconstruction came to a sudden halt, African-Americans in the South would soon be completely disenfranchised, and politicians began to focus on new issues (such as tariffs and civil service reform).
* 1932 presidential election — Franklin D. Roosevelt
** Of all the realigning elections, this one musters the most agreement from political scientists and historians; it is the archetypal realigning election. FDR&#x27;s admirers such as Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. have argued that New Deal policies, developed in response to the crash of 1929 and the miseries of the Great Depression under Herbert Hoover, represented an entirely new phenomenon in American politics. More critical historians such as Carl Degler and David Kennedy see a great deal of continuity with Hoover&#x27;s energetic but unsuccessful economic policies. In many ways, Roosevelt&#x27;s legacy still defines the Democratic Party; he forged an enduring New Deal Coalition of big city machines, the White South, intellectuals, labor unions, Catholics, Jews, and Westerners. In 1936, African-Americans were added to the coalition (African-Americans had previously been denied the vote or voted Republican). For instance, Pittsburgh, which was a Republican stronghold from the Civil War up to this point, suddenly became a Democratic stronghold, and has elected a Democratic mayor to office in every election since this time.
** The Democrats went from controlling 37.7% of House seats in 1928 to 49.6% in 1930 and 71.9% in 1932, for a total gain of 34.2% in two elections.
** In the Senate, the Democrats went from controlling 40.6% of seats in 1928 to 49% in 1930 and 61.5% in 1932, for a total gain of 20.9% in two elections.

===Other possible political realignments===
Some debate exists today as to what elections could be considered realigning elections after 1932. Although several candidates have been proposed, there is no widespread agreement:

* 1874 elections
** The 1874 elections saw a resurgence of the Democratic Party. Discontent with the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant and the economic depression known at the time as the Panic of 1873, and the slow return of disillusioned Liberal Republicans from their 1872 third party ticket, all energized the Democrats. The Democrats had not controlled either chamber of Congress since before the War. The realignment meant the Democrats generally controlled the House of Representatives from 1875 to their massive defeat in 1894. Republicans eked out very narrow wins in most of the presidential elections in that period. The Civil Rights Act of 1875, enacted in the lame-duck session of Congress following the 1874 elections, was the last major Reconstruction law, and it was chiefly of symbolic value. The new strength of the Democrats marked the end of Reconstruction legislation. With the end of Reconstruction, the 11 former states of the Confederacy became a dominant-party system known as the Solid South. The tariff and especially monetary policy emerged as the great ideological debates after 1874.
* 1964 and 1968 presidential elections — Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon
** The 1968 election is often cited due to the innovative campaign strategy of Nixon. In running against Hubert Humphrey, he used what became known as the Southern strategy. He appealed to white voters in the South with a call for &quot;states&#x27; rights&quot;, which they interpreted as meaning that the federal government would no longer demand the forced busing of school children as ordered by federal courts. Democrats protested that Nixon exploited racial fears in winning the support of white southerners and northern white ethnics. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal coalition had lasted over 30 years but after the urban riots and Vietnam crisis of the mid-1960s one by one the coalition partners peeled away until only a hollow core remained, setting the stage for a GOP revival. Nixon&#x27;s downfall postponed the realignment which came about under Reagan, as even the term &quot;liberalism&quot; fell into disrepute. 
** Including this as a realignment preserves the roughly 30-year cyclical pattern: 1896 to 1932, 1932 to 1964, and 1964 to 1994.
** For political scientists, 1964 was primarily an issue-based realignment. The classic study of the 1964 election, by Carmines and Stimson (1989), shows how the polarization of activists and elites on race-related issues sent clear signals to the general public about the historic change in each party&#x27;s position on Civil Rights. Notably, while only 50% of African-Americans self-identified as Democrats in the 1960 National Election Study, 82% did in 1964, and the numbers are higher in the 21st century. The clearest indicator of the importance of this election was that Deep Southern states, such as Mississippi, voted Republican in 1964. In contrast, much of the traditional Republican strongholds of the Northeast and Upper Midwest voted Democratic. Vermont and Maine, which stood alone voting against FDR in 1936, voted for LBJ in 1964.
** Many analysts do not consider 1968 a realigning election because control of Congress did not change; the Democrats would control the Senate until 1980 (and again from 1986 to 1994) and the House until 1994. Also missing was a marked change in the partisan orientation of the electorate. Importantly, these two elections are consistent with the theory in that the old New Deal issues were replaced by Civil Rights issues as the major factor explaining why citizens identified with each party. Other scholars contend that this is the beginning of a thirty-year dealignment, in which citizens generally moved towards political independence, which ended with the 1994 election.
* 1980 presidential election — Ronald Reagan
** In this election, Ronald Reagan won a sweeping victory over Democrat Jimmy Carter, who won only six states (plus the District of Columbia), which accounted for just 10% of the electoral vote. Republicans also took control of the Senate for the first time in over 25 years. (See Reagan&#x27;s coattails.)
** The 1980 election can be seen as an ideological realignment, as it marked the beginning of the Reagan Era and marked a realignment towards conservatism and conservative policies. In addition, Reagan Democrats are a result of his presidency and campaigns. Many scholars viewed Reagan&#x27;s policies as sufficiently new to consider this a realigning election.
** On the other hand, critics like Mayhew (2004) note that control of the House did not change, nor even come close to changing, at this time. Republicans actually held fewer House seats in 1983 than they held in 1973. In addition, the Republicans lost the Senate again only six years later, leading some to conclude that the Senators simply rode in on Reagan&#x27;s coattails, and did not represent a true shift in the ideological preferences of their constituents. Also absent was a shift in partisan alignment from public opinion polls. Both liberals, such as Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, and conservatives, such as Reagan communications director Pat Buchanan, would also argue that Nixon&#x27;s victory in 1968 set the stage for Reagan&#x27;s victory, and the fact that Reagan did so well in Southern states, traditionally a Democratic stronghold, as well as the fact that some of Reagan&#x27;s rhetoric involving law and order and states&#x27; rights seemed to mirror Nixon&#x27;s Southern Strategy seem to bear this fact out.
* 1992 presidential election — Bill Clinton
** Clinton carried several states that had previously been Republican or swing states in both the Northeast and on the West Coast. Most notably, the largest state California switched from being a reliably Republican state to being consistently Democratic: it has been carried by Democratic candidates ever since. Other states that switched and have remained with the Democrats since include Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, and Vermont. In contrast, despite the fact Clinton came from the South, he only carried four of the former Confederate states: Arkansas (his home state), Louisiana, Tennessee (his vice president&#x27;s home state) and Georgia, confirming it as a Republican base of support.
** Since 1992, the Democratic candidate has won the national popular vote in every presidential election except 2004 and 2024, suggesting some manner of national realignment away from the Republican domination of the 1970s and 1980s. This national tendency toward Democratic presidential candidates did not necessarily translate to Democratic victories in congressional elections. However Republicans remained competitive nationally, making historic gains in the 1994 and 2010 midterms, although the composition of the electorate in presidential versus midterm elections vary significantly.
* 1994 House of Representatives and Senate elections
** This election is now generally seen as a realigning election by political scientists. Republicans won majorities in both the House and the Senate, taking control of both chambers for the first time since 1954. In addition, control of the House continued until 2007. Newt Gingrich, who promoted a &quot;Contract with America&quot;, successfully nationalized the campaign by coordinating races around the country. The overwhelming nature of the Republicans&#x27; victory points to a realignment; the party gained 54 seats, while neither party would gain more than a handful of seats in any election until 2006.
** The GOP gained seats in 43 of 46 state houses. These gains continued into the next decade, so that by 2002 the GOP held the majority of state legislative seats for the first time in fifty years.
** Notably, the period of party decline and mass dealignment appears to have ended in the 1990s. Strength of partisanship, as measured by the National Election Study, increased in the 1990s, as does the percentage of the mass public who perceive important differences between each party.
** This election also indicates the rise of religious issues as one of the most important cleavage in American politics. While Reagan&#x27;s election hinted at the importance of the religious right, it was the formation of the Christian Coalition (the successor to the Moral Majority) in the early 1990s that gave Republicans organizational and financial muscle, particularly at the state level. By 2004 the media portrayed the political nation as divided into &quot;red&quot; (Republican) and &quot;blue&quot; (Democratic) states, with reputed differences in cultural attitudes and politics between the two blocs.
** The Republicans made historic inroads in the Solid South where they picked up total of 19 House seats. Going into the election, House Democrats outnumbered House Republicans. Afterwards, the Republicans outnumbered Democrats for the first time since Reconstruction.
* 2008 presidential election — Barack Obama
** In the 2008 elections, the Democrats expanded their majorities in the Congress, and won the presidency decisively. This was due to the momentum carried over from the Democrats&#x27; 2006 successes, as well as the continued unpopularity of President George W. Bush, whose administration was now faced with a financial crisis and economic recession. Some people believe that 2008 is possibly a realigning election with a long-lasting impact, just as the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt was in 1932 and the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 were. President Obama was reelected in the 2012 election as well, becoming only the third Democrat to win an absolute majority of the popular vote more than once while losing only two entire states that he had won in 2008.
** On the other hand, the Republican Party experienced major gains two years later in 2010, retaking the house with a gain of 63 seats, the largest Republican gain in 72 years. Additionally, the Republican Party gained 6 seats in the Senate, slimming the Democratic majority. Despite Obama&#x27;s reelection in 2012, the Republicans had another strong performance in the 2014 midterms; they not only increased their majority in the House and recaptured the Senate, but also made gains in the gubernatorial races and other statewide and local races, resulting in 31 Republican governorships and 68 state legislative houses under Republican control, thus increasing their influence to the largest Republican majority in the entire country in nearly a century.
* 2016 presidential election — Donald Trump
** In this election, Donald Trump, the Republican candidate, won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, all Midwestern and/or Rust Belt states that some had previously considered safely Democratic, though those states were close in several prior elections. Trump also came close to winning New Hampshire, Minnesota, and Maine.
** However, like with the 2008 Obama election, two years later in the 2018 United States elections, the Republican Party lost control of the House in a loss of 40 seats, but gained two seats in the Senate, so the full effect of the 2016 election and Trump Presidency as a critical election remains to be seen.
**Furthermore, Donald Trump lost to former vice president and Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election. In particular, Trump lost the three states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that were cited as key to his victory in 2016, although by relatively narrow margins compared to the Obama era.

==Canada==
The history of the critical realigning elections in Canada, both nationally and in the provinces, is covered by Argyle (2011).

===Federal===
According to recent scholarship, there have been four party systems in Canada at the federal level since Confederation, each with its own distinctive pattern of social support, patronage relationships, leadership styles, and electoral strategies. Steve Patten identifies four party systems in Canada&#x27;s political history
* The first party system emerged from pre-Confederation colonial politics, had its &quot;heyday&quot; from 1896 to 1911 and lasted until the Conscription Crisis of 1917, and was characterized by local patronage administered by the two largest parties, the Liberals and the Conservatives.
* The second system emerged following the First World War, and had its heyday from 1935 to 1957, was characterized by regionalism and saw the emergence of several protest parties, such as the Progressives, the Social Credit Party, and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation.
* The third system emerged in 1963 and had its heyday from 1968 to 1983 and began to unravel thereafter. The two largest parties were challenged by a strong third party, the New Democratic Party. Campaigns during this era became more national in scope due to electronic media, and involved a greater focus on leadership. The dominant policy of the era was Keynesian economics.
* The fourth party system has involved the rise of the Reform Party, the Bloc Québécois, and the merger of the Canadian Alliance with the Progressive Conservatives. It saw most parties move to one-member-one-vote leadership contests, and a major reform to campaign finance laws in 2004. The fourth party system has been characterized by market-oriented policies that abandoned Keynesian policies, but maintained the welfare state.

Clarkson (2005) shows how the Liberal Party has dominated all the party systems, using different approaches. It began with a &quot;clientelistic approach&quot; under Laurier, which evolved into a &quot;brokerage&quot; system of the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s under Mackenzie King. The 1950s saw the emergence of a &quot;pan-Canadian system&quot;, which lasted until the 1990s. The 1993 election — categorized by Clarkson as an electoral &quot;earthquake&quot; which &quot;fragmented&quot; the party system, saw the emergence of regional politics within a four party-system, whereby various groups championed regional issues and concerns. Clarkson concludes that the inherent bias built into the first-past-the-post system, has chiefly benefited the Liberals.

* 1896 election
** 1896 saw a Liberal victory under Sir Wilfrid Laurier. From the 1867 election until 1896, the Conservative Party of John A. Macdonald had governed Canada, excepting a single term from 1873 to 1878. The Liberals had struggled to retake office, under Laurier and his predecessor, Edward Blake. 1896 was the first election held after the death of Macdonald in 1891, and the Conservatives had been in complete disarray in the ensuing years, with no fewer than four leaders. The Liberals would remain in office until 1911. Beyond that, political scientists often consider this election that made the Liberal Party the dominant force in Canadian politics, holding office for more than two thirds of the time between 1896 and 2006.
* 1993 election
** 1993 saw not only the sweeping success of the Liberals under Jean Chrétien, but also the collapse of the Progressive Conservatives as their support base switched to regional parties in Quebec and the western provinces, resulting in a five party political system with the Liberals as the dominant party. During his second term, the PCs&#x27; policies were unpopular, while the failure of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords frustrated Quebec and stirred up Western alienation. New regional parties which formed in protest: the Bloc Québécois in Quebec and the Reform Party in the west. Meanwhile, the New Democratic Party, the longtime third party in parliament, fell from 43 seats to nine, as their endorsement of the Charlottetown Accord and Quebec nationalism cost them support among organized labour and rural voters in the west, which switched their support to Reform. Meanwhile, the Progressive Conservatives were nearly wiped out, falling from 156 seats to only two—the worst defeat of a sitting government at the federal level.
** The Liberals under Chrétien would win a further two consecutive majorities in 1997 and 2000, while never being seriously challenged as the largest party. The Progressive Conservatives never recovered, ultimately merging with the Reform Party&#x27;s successor, the Canadian Alliance, to form the new Conservative Party of Canada in late 2003.
** The Bloc Québécois would remain a major presence in federal politics, with the party winning either the most or second-most seats in the province in every election since (with the exception of 2011 and 2015).
* 2004 election
** While Paul Martin&#x27;s Liberals retained enough seats to continue as the government, it saw the re-emergence of a united Conservative Party, resulting in a four party system. This was also the first of three elections where no party managed a majority of seats.

===Alberta===
Alberta has had a tradition of one-party dominance, where a party forms government for an extended period before losing power. From 1905 to 2015, Alberta only changed governments (often called &quot;dynasties&quot;) four times, with no party ever returning to government. The elections of 1921, 1935, 1971 and 2015 each marked the end of a particular dynasty and a realignment of the province&#x27;s party system.

The 2019 election has also been suggested as a realignment: although the New Democratic Party was defeated after only one term, they retained a strong base of seats and remained competitive in opinion polling and fundraising, pointing to a possible development of a competitive two-party system against the United Conservative Party.

===British Columbia===
* 1991 British Columbia general election – End of Social Credit as an effective political force in British Columbia politics. The Socreds under Premier Rita Johnston was reduced to third party status, while the New Democratic Party of Mike Harcourt formed the government. Liberal Party leader Gordon Wilson surprised observers by leading his party to winning one-third of the votes cast. This was enough to not only return them to the legislature, but make them the official opposition.
* 2001 British Columbia general election - The centre-right coalesced around the BC Liberal Party, which won 77 of 79 seats and 57.6% of the popular vote. This essentially rebuilt much of the Socred coalition around the BC Liberal Party. At the same time, the NDP faced significant unpopularity after several scandals (such as the Fast Ferry Scandal), and failed to break the Liberal majority until 2017.
* 2024 British Columbia general election - The centre-right rallied around the Conservative Party of BC, which won 44 of 93 seats and 43.28% of the popular vote. The first time the party won seats in almost 50 years and it best electoral performance in 72 years. The election saw the once dominate BC United (formerly the BC Liberals), who served as the official opposition, withdraw from the race before the election to avoid splitting the vote.

===Quebec===
A considerable number of Quebec general elections have been known characterized by high seat turnovers, with certain ones being considered realigning elections, notably:
* The 1936 election which ended 39 years of Liberal rule (16 of them recently under Louis-Alexandre Taschereau); and saw the rise of Maurice Duplessis&#x27;s Union Nationale, which would go on to form government for all but one term until 1960.
* The 1960 election, which not only ended 15 continuous years of Union Nationale rule and precipitated its gradual decline, but ushered in the Quiet Revolution under Jean Lesage.
* The 1976 election, which saw René Lévesque&#x27;s Parti Québécois not only make a breakthrough in the National Assembly. It also made sovereignty the dominant political issue from then on, with parties subsequently aligning themselves on a sovereignty–federalist spectrum.
*The 2018 election suggested the end of the sovereignty-federalist split due to the emergence of the Coalition Avenir Québec, which campaigned on a nationalist platform while explicitly ruling out sovereignty.

Since the 1990s, provincial elections in Quebec show increasing voter realignment and volatility in party support. The Quebec Liberal Party (unaffiliated with the federal Liberals since 1955) been a major party since Confederation, but they have faced different opposition parties.

===Asia===
* 1977 Indian general election - Janata Party victory, defeating the Indian National Congress
** The left-wing Indian National Congress, which had led the country to independence from the United Kingdom in 1947 and had won every general election since the first post-independence election in 1952, lost power to the Janata Party led by Morarji Desai, after the immensely unpopular imposition of The Emergency by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975. Both Indira Gandhi and her son Sanjay lost their seats.
**
* 2014 Indian general election - Bharatiya Janata Party victory, defeating the Indian National Congress
** The Congress party suffered a major decline on both the national and state level, with the BJP occupying the dominant position Congress used to have since. Congress was defeated by the BJP again in the 2019 and 2024 elections. Until 2019, Congress had never been out of power for two consecutive terms.
* 1977 Israeli legislative election
** Likud defeated the Alignment, led by the Israel Labor Party, allowing Likud to lead a government for the first time ever. For the first 29 years of Israel&#x27;s independence, politics had been dominated by the left-wing parties Labor and its predecessor, Mapai. The leadership of the right, especially Menachem Begin, were considered by the Left to be beyond the pale, and as Ben Gurion had said in the early years of the State, he would enter coalitions with any parties, except the communists and Begin. Prior to this election a hypothetical bloc of right-wing and religious parties would rarely ever approach the threshold of a majority government; however since 1977, a combination of these two blocs have made up the majority of Israel&#x27;s electorate since then with exceptions of a few elections but no longer running far behind in comparison to pre-1977. Due to corruption in the Labor Party, many former Labor voters defected to the new Democratic Movement for Change, which won 15 seats and finished in third place, behind the Likud with 46 seats and Alignment (Labor plus Mapam) with 32 seats. The DMC collapsed within three years, allowing Labor to rebound at the next election. Labor and Likud dominated Israeli politics until 2003 when Labor went into sudden decline due to a backlash against the failed Oslo Accords and the outbreak of the Second Intifada.
* 2000 Taiwanese presidential election — Chen Shui-bian
** Though more popular and consistently ranked higher in the polls, James Soong failed to gain the ruling Kuomintang&#x27;s (KMT) nomination over incumbent Vice President Lien Chan. As a result, he announced his candidacy as an independent candidate, and was consequently expelled from the party. The split in the KMT vote resulted in a victory for Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party, even though he won only 39% of the popular vote. After the election, Soong founded the People First Party, which attracted members from the KMT and the pro-unification New Party, which was by that time beginning to fade. Angry from the defeat, the KMT expelled chairman Lee Teng-hui, who was president until 2000 and was widely suspected of causing the KMT split so that Chen would win. Lee then founded the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union. The impact of these events changed the political landscape of Taiwan. Not only did the KMT lose the presidency for the first time in half a century, but its policies swung away from Lee&#x27;s influence and it began intra-party reform. The two newly founded parties became far more viable than other minor parties in the past, and the multi-party nature of Taiwan&#x27;s politics was confirmed by the legislative elections of 2001. The KMT would not return to power until 2008 under the leadership of Ma Ying-jeou.
* 2002 Turkish general election — Justice and Development Party victory
** This election was notable in that every party in the previous Grand National Assembly of Turkey was ejected from Parliament, as none of them crossed the 10% threshold. This not only included the governing coalition of the Democratic Left Party, Motherland Party and Nationalist Movement Party, but the largest opposition party, the True Path Party. The AKP, which formed the government following this election, has dominated Turkish politics ever since.
* 2006 Palestinian legislative election (Palestinian National Authority) — Hamas victory; Ismail Haniyeh Prime Minister
** In January 2006 the militant Hamas organisation, classified as a terrorist group by the United States government and other groups, won a landslide victory over the ruling Fatah party which had been in power under the leadership of former PLO chairman Yasser Arafat. The Bush Administration, the Quartet, and Israel all threatened to cut off foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority if Hamas refused to abandon terrorist tactics and recognise the right of the State of Israel to exist. This concession, though discussed in Hamas circles, did not come about soon enough to prevent a serious breakdown in services under Hamas government, and Western (especially American) support of Fatah paramilitaries eventually led to the breakout of the Fatah–Hamas conflict (termed a &quot;Palestinian Civil War&quot; by some) in December 2006. The Hamas government was suspended by PA President Mahmoud Abbas, a member of Fatah, after some weeks of fighting, and installed a caretaker government under the leadership of Salam Fayyad.

===Europe===

==== United Kingdom ====
* 1918 United Kingdom general election in Ireland — Sinn Féin victory
** For the previous four decades, Irish politics had been dominated by the moderate nationalist Irish Parliamentary Party, which sought Home Rule within the United Kingdom. The 1918 general election was a landslide victory for the republican Sinn Féin party, which won nearly 70% of the seats. The new Sinn Féin MPs refused to take their seats in the House of Commons, and instead set up their own republican assembly called Dáil Éireann. This assembly issued a unilateral declaration of independence, which led to the start of the War of Independence and eventually led to Irish independence from the United Kingdom in 1922. The Irish Parliamentary Party never recovered from this defeat. The two largest parties in Ireland, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, originated from splits in the Sinn Féin party which won the election of 1918.
* 1922 United Kingdom general election – Labour Party forms Loyal Opposition
** For over 200 years, the Liberals and Conservatives (and their antecedents) had been the UK&#x27;s two major parties; however, the 1922 general election saw Labour overtake the Liberals in the political landscape. Labour and the Conservatives have been the UK&#x27;s two major parties since then, and government has alternated only between the two parties ever since.
* 1979 United Kingdom general election – Conservative victory; Margaret Thatcher Prime Minister
** This election brought the Conservatives into government where they remained for eighteen uninterrupted years. Thatcher&#x27;s policies of monetarism and privatisation represented a very different strand of Conservatism to that of previous governments and a bold shift from the post-war consensus that had existed since 1945. The shockwaves led to a new centrist party being formed by some disenchanted Labour MPs (the SDP) in 1981, and a long period in opposition for Labour, during which they abandoned many socialist policies (notably Clause IV which advocated common ownership) and were transformed into &quot;New Labour&quot; before they returned to government in a landslide victory at the 1997 general election under the leadership of Tony Blair. At a more base level, it led to a shift in voting patterns as the traditional class-based voting started to break down and many of the working classes (in particular skilled workers, homeowners and those in southern England) voted Conservative, whilst at the same time many public sector professionals shifted their support to Labour.
* 2015 United Kingdom general election
**The election saw Euroscepticism and Scottish Nationalism emerge as major forces in the UK political discourse, with the UK Independence Party and Scottish National Party finishing third in the popular vote and seat count respectively, and the Liberal Democrats, the country&#x27;s traditional third-party, losing 49 of the 57 seats it had won at the previous general election. The SNP&#x27;s victories, largely at the expense of the Scottish Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, established them as the dominant party in Scotland&#x27;s electoral politics, a position they have since maintained. UKIP did not continue to enjoy electoral success (in part because they only won a single seat despite finishing third in the popular vote) and rapidly declined thereafter, but many of their policies were subsequently adopted by the Conservative Party, who formed a majority government for the first time since 1992.
* 2019 United Kingdom general election – Conservative victory; Boris Johnson Prime Minister
** The Conservative Party won a landslide victory over the Labour Party, winning many seats in the red wall, including seats that have never voted Conservative for over a century. This was repeated again in 2021 local elections for mayoral and council elections, where the Conservatives made large gains in red wall areas but Labour (along with the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party) made gains in the south of England, with more educated voters.

==== Ireland ====
* 1932 Irish general election – Fianna Fáil victory; Éamon de Valera President of the Executive Council
** This election resulted in Fianna Fáil, led by Éamon de Valera, becoming the largest party in Dáil Éireann for the first time. Fianna Fáil remained in power for the next sixteen years and remained the largest party in the Dáil for the next 79 years, serving as the government more than 58 of those years.
* 2011 Irish general election
** Fianna Fáil, who had governed Ireland for most of the post-independence era, were heavily defeated at the election following anger over the Irish financial crisis. For the first time, Fine Gael overtook Fianna Fáil to win the most votes and seats, while Fianna Fáil fell from first place to third place, in terms of both votes and seats. Fine Gael and the second largest party in the Dáil, the Labour Party formed a coalition government.
* 2020 Irish general election
**This election resulted in the three largest parties each winning a share of the vote between 20% and 25%, along with the best result for Sinn Féin since 1923 (37 of the 160 seats) (before the formation of Fianna Fáil). Along with the two dominant parties Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil not having enough seats between them (38 and 35 respectively) to have a majority (at least 80 seats needed out of 160 seats), this election resulted in a break from a two-party dominant legislature, with something closer to a three party result.

==== Denmark ====
*1973 Danish general election – Poul Hartling Prime Minister
** The 1973 Danish general election is referred to as the &quot;Landslide Election&quot; (), as five new or previously unrepresented parties won seats, and more than half the members of the parliament were replaced. The Social Democratic Party, which had led a minority government until this election, lost one-third of their seats. After the election, Poul Hartling, the leader of the liberal Venstre, formed the smallest minority government in Danish history with only 22 seats, supported by the Progress Party, the Conservative People&#x27;s Party, the Social Liberal Party, the Centre Democrats and the Christian People&#x27;s Party.

==== Spain ====
* 1982 Spanish general election – Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) victory
** This election saw the ruling Union of the Democratic Centre (UCD), the party that had shepherded the country through its transition to democracy, nearly wiped out. The UCD fell to only 11 seats, being replaced as the main non-socialist party by the People&#x27;s Alliance (AP), and would dissolve itself as a party shortly after the election. The PSOE and AP – later transformed into the People&#x27;s Party (PP) – would go on to dominate Spanish politics for the next three decades. At the same time, the PSOE would establish itself as the dominant party of Spanish politics until the 1996 general election.

==== Italy ====
*1994 Italian general election – Forza Italia/Pole of Freedoms victory
** This election resulted in the near-destruction of the Italian People&#x27;s Party (the renamed Christian Democracy), which had been the largest party in the country since 1946. The Italian Socialist Party, a major coalition partner for the last thirty years, was decimated as well.

==== Germany ====
*1998 German federal election – first federal level red-green coalition victory
** The election resulted in the first left of center majority in Germany on the federal level ever. The SPD came in first place for the first time since 1972 and the second time overall since the war. The election unseated Helmut Kohl after 16 years in office and having presided over German reunification and with five factions achieving more than the five percent electoral threshold of votes, it gave a first indication of the more fractious political landscape of the Berlin Republic. The FDP was removed from government after 29 consecutive years.

==== Lithuania ====
* 2000 Lithuanian parliamentary election
** In these elections both electoral blocs (one led by the Communist Party of Lithuania/Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania and another led by the Sąjūdis/Homeland Union), which dominated political landscape since 1990, lost out to populist (New Union (Social Liberals)) and liberal (Liberal Union of Lithuania) parties. Those parties (and their successors, the Labour Party, Liberal and Centre Union, Liberal Movement) would become vital players to coalitions&#x27; after that.

==== Poland ====
* 2005 Polish parliamentary election
** The elections resulted in a widely expected heavy defeat for the post-Communist Democratic Left Alliance government, with conservative parties such as Law and Justice and Civic Platform emerging as the dominant parties (and coalitions led by them) in Poland.

==== Estonia ====
* 2007 Estonian parliamentary election
** The elections resulted the Estonian Reform Party becomimg the largest party on national level, the position which is retained ever since.

==== Hungary ====
* 2010 Hungarian parliamentary election
** The election resulted the landslide victory of the Fidesz, gaining a two-thirds majority in parliament, while long-time rival, the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) had drastically weakened, ending the &quot;de facto&quot; two-party system that existed since 1998. Two major parties of the &quot;regime change&quot;, the MDF and the SZDSZ, lost their all parliamentary seats. Two new parties, Jobbik and LMP, emerged. After 2010, under the Fidesz government led by Viktor Orbán, Hungary was reclassified by Freedom House from a democracy to a transitional or hybrid regime.

==== Greece ====
* May 2012 Greek legislative election
** Greece&#x27;s two main political parties since the restoration of democracy in 1974, New Democracy and the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), saw a combined fall in support from nearly 80% in 2009 to just one-third for their role in supporting austerity measures to alleviate the Greek government-debt crisis. At this election, PASOK fell dramatically from first place to third place. This election also saw the shift of left-leaning support to the Eurosceptic Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) which has been at the forefront of opposition to the austerity measures and to the neoliberal economic policies of the European Union.

==== France ====
* 2017 French presidential election
** Neither the mainstream left Socialist Party nor the mainstream right Republicans made the second round of voting, the first time since the Second World War that both of the formerly dominant strands of French politics have not been represented. Instead, the two leading candidates – the eventual winner, centrist liberal pro-European Emmanuel Macron of En Marche and far-right Eurosceptic Marine Le Pen of the National Front – were identified by many analysts as representing a new open–closed political spectrum between conservative protectionism and liberal globalism. A similar realignment happened in the concurrent 2017 legislative election.

===Latin America===
* 2002 Brazilian general election — Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva President
** According to political theorist and former spokesman of the Brazilian Presidency (2003–2007) André Singer, the rise to power of the Worker&#x27;s Party (PT) and the subsequent creation and expansion of income redistribution policies (Bolsa Família, minimum wage increases, etc.) has realigned the Brazilian political scene. Even in the event of an PT&#x27;s electoral defeat, it is argued, no president would risk reverting Lula&#x27;s programs, for fear of the reaction of the lower classes. Lula&#x27;s victory in 2002 marked the beginning of the first left-wing government since 1964.
* 1930 Colombian presidential election - Enrique Olaya Herrera President
** After a 44-year domination in national politics by the Conservative Party (since 1886), the division of the conservative ticket (along with the economic crisis and the Banana Massacre) caused the first victory of the Liberal Party in half a century. This was the start of the period known as &quot;Liberal Republic&quot;, in which the liberals kept the presidency for 16 years. Furthermore, this also started a winning-strike in legislative elections that would last until 2006, with the liberals winning in all elections they participated in with either a majority or plurality, being the first force in Congress in 68 out of 75 years.
* 1998 Venezuelan presidential election — Hugo Chávez Frías President
**The result meant the end of the Puntofijismo that had dominated the political atmosphere of the country in the last 40 years and the beginning of the dominance of the new MVR party, later reformed as the PSUV.
* 2018 Brazilian general election — Jair Bolsonaro was elected president, ending 13 years of Workers Party rule. Anger over the previous administration&#x27;s failure to tackle widespread corruption and other crises engulfing Brazil handed the conservative politician victory.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
* 1910 Australian federal election — Labor victory; Andrew Fisher Prime Minister 
** The unification of the Protectionist Party and the Anti-Socialist Party (originally the Free Trade Party) into the Commonwealth Liberal Party earlier in 1909 made this election the first under what would become a two-party system, between the democratic socialist Labor Party versus a non-Labor, conservative party as the nation&#x27;s two main parties. It also marked the first elected majority government federally.
* 1922 Australian federal election — Nationalist-Country coalition victory 
** This was the first time a conservative party formed the Coalition with the Country Party which represented graziers, farmers, and regional voters in the aftermath of the 1922 election. Despite some interruptions in Coalition agreements such as in 1931, 1939 and 1987, this coalition has existed until today, now between the Liberal Party (successor to the Nationalists) and National party (which was renamed from the Country party). The Liberal/National coalition alternates in power with their main opponents, the Australian Labor Party to form the federal government of Australia at every federal election. 
* 1949 Australian federal election — Liberal victory; Robert Menzies Prime Minister
** Previously, the United Australia Party (UAP) was seen as close to big business and the upper class, while their opponents, the Australian Labor Party appealed to trade unionists, and working and lower classes. By founding the Liberal Party to replace the UAP after its 1943 election defeat, Menzies began selling his party&#x27;s appeal to middle-classes which he famously called “The Forgotten People” in the class conflict between the upper and lower social classes. Forming a coalition with the Country Party (now the National Party which represented rural graziers and farmers), this resulted in a coalition of liberals, conservatives and rural interests against the democratic socialists of the Australian Labor Party. Menzies kept free-traders and economic moderates; hard-line conservatives and social liberals united under one party, the Liberal party, by focusing on Labor&#x27;s “socialism” and the international threat of communism amidst the Cold War.
** During his 17 years in power from 1949 to 1966, the Menzies government presided over the longest period of economic prosperity in Australia&#x27;s history, lasting from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Continued economic growth, rising standards of living, and his widening of government support for education and universities led to the vast expansion of the Australian middle class and changed the Australian workforce from manual labour towards service, science and new technology industries; the ANZUS Treaty of 1951 and voting rights for Aboriginal Australians are legacies which still stand today. Arguably, Labor was forced to modernise and adopt a more social democratic approach (away from democratic socialism and nationalisation of industry) to appeal to the expanded middle class, under Gough Whitlam.
* 1972 Australian federal election – Labor victory; Gough Whitlam Prime Minister
** After twenty-three years of Liberal rule under Menzies, Harold Holt, John Gorton and William McMahon, the Labor Party took power in 1972, with the slogan, &#x27;It&#x27;s Time&#x27;. The significance of this election was broader than merely a change of partisan rule; elections would be no longer decided only on economic issues, but also, new issues such as the environment, Aboriginal affairs, abortion, multiculturalism, and a broader acceptance of state spending, resulted from the Whitlam government, which in many respects created a bipartisan consensus on major issues of social policy. Although the Whitlam government was relatively brief, its policy legacy—in creating new government policies for society and culture—lasted in many respects to the 1996 election, and even to the present day.

====New Zealand====
* 1890 New Zealand general election – Liberal victory; John Ballance Prime Minister
** The coming to power of the Liberal Party is heralded as a major milestone in New Zealand history. It marked the beginning of proper party politics in New Zealand. While groupings of &#x27;Liberal&#x27; and &#x27;Conservative&#x27; politicians date back to the 1870s they were more akin to loose factions rather than properly organised parties. Massive economic and social reforms took place following 1890 with a progressive land tax partnered with leasehold sponsorship to stimulate agriculture which recovered the country from the Long Depression. Ballance&#x27;s successor Richard Seddon carried on reforms concentrating largely on establishing welfare. Arguably the Liberal&#x27;s most famous and important achievement was the enfranchisement of women, a major social upheaval which saw New Zealand become the first country in the world to allow women to vote.
* 1935 New Zealand general election – Labour victory; Michael Joseph Savage Prime Minister
** The 1935 election brought Labour to power for the first time. Huge economic change resulted from their entry into office at the height of the Great Depression which was to remain in place for half a century. A generous welfare system labeled as &quot;social security&quot; was instigated and the country&#x27;s existing free market economy was completely abandoned in favour of a Keynesian based system with higher tariffs, guaranteed prices for producers and emphasis on local manufacturing to create jobs. The government was praised for their policies resulting in another landslide victory in 1938. The political landscape was also to change. The three-party era of the early 20th century ended with the United and Reform parties (who had formed a coalition between 1931 and 1935) completely merging a year later into the new National Party, who remain Labour&#x27;s main rival to the present day, both occupying either government or opposition ever since.
* 1984 New Zealand general election – Labour victory; David Lange Prime Minister
** The election of the Labour Government under the leadership of David Lange and Roger Douglas, brought about radical economic reform, moving New Zealand from what had probably been one of the most protected, regulated and state-dominated system of any capitalist democracy to an extreme position at the open, competitive, free-market end of the spectrum. Social policies also took a dramatic change with New Zealand&#x27;s largely socially conservative outlook being reshaped with more liberal outlooks in the Lange government&#x27;s policy epitomised by policies such as the passing of anti-nuclear legislation and the legalisation of homosexuality. Foreign relations also changed dramatically with New Zealand abandoning their allegiances with the United States, largely over the issue of anti-nuclear policy, culminating in their exclusion from ANZUS by both the US and Australia.
* 1996 New Zealand general election – National–New Zealand First coalition victory; Jim Bolger Prime Minister
** The 1996 election was the first held under the new mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting system, introduced after two referendums in 1992 and 1993, and signalled the transition from the two-party era to a new multi-party era.

<text>Isle Royale (, ) is an island of the Great Lakes located in the northwest of Lake Superior and part of the U.S. state of Michigan. The island and the 450 surrounding smaller islands and waters make up Isle Royale National Park.

Isle Royale is long and wide, with an area of , making it the fourth-largest lake island in the world. In addition, it is the largest natural island in Lake Superior, the second-largest island in the Great Lakes (after Manitoulin Island), the third-largest in the contiguous United States (after Long Island and Padre Island), the largest in the contiguous US with no road link to the mainland, and the 33rd-largest island in the United States.

Isle Royale is defined by the United States Census Bureau as Census Tract 9603 of Keweenaw County, Michigan (a county found in the state&#x27;s Upper Peninsula). As of the 2000 census there was no permanent population on Isle Royale. After the island was made a national park, some existing residents were allowed to stay, and a few leases are still in effect.

==Geography==
In 1875, Isle Royale was set off from Keweenaw County, as a separate county, Isle Royale County. In 1897, the county was dissolved, and the island was reincorporated into Keweenaw County. The highest point on the island is Mount Desor at , or about above lake level.

Isle Royale is within about from the shore of the Canadian province of Ontario (near the city of Thunder Bay), and adjacently, the state of Minnesota and is from the Michigan shore, on the Keweenaw Peninsula, itself part of Upper Peninsula. There are no roads on the island, and wheeled vehicles or devices, other than wheelchairs, are not permitted. Rock Harbor has wheeled carts available to move personal belongings from the Rock Harbor marina to the cabins and hotel. Also, the National Park Service employs tractors and utility terrain vehicles to move items around the developed areas at Windigo, Rock Harbor, and Mott Island.

Topsoil tends to be thin, which favors trees that have horizontal root patterns such as balsam fir, white spruce, and black spruce.

===Interior lakes===
Siskiwit Lake is the largest lake on the island. It has cold, clear water which is relatively low in nutrients. Siskiwit Lake contains several islands, including Ryan Island, the largest.

*Chicken Bone Lake
*Lake Desor
*Feldtmann Lake
*Intermediate Lake (Isle Royale)
*Lake Ritchie
*Sargent Lake

==Climate==

Source climate data for Isle Royale is lacking, particularly for the winter season, though general summaries of seasonal variations are available and data from nearby areas have been used to derive deductions for purposes of scientific study. For example, see the monthly temperature and precipitation table on the Isle Royale National Park page.
==Geology==

 The island is composed largely of ridges, running roughly southwest-to-northeast. The main ridge, Greenstone Ridge, is over in many places. Greenstone belts are exposed, with rounded stones of chlorastrolite, also known as greenstone, near and in the lake.
According to the National Park Service, the north sides of the ridges tend to be steeper than the south sides. Coastal areas were once submerged beneath prehistoric lake waters, and contain many tumbled boulders and other large rocks.

==History==
The island was a common hunting ground for native people from nearby Minnesota and Ontario. A canoe voyage of thirteen miles is necessary to reach the island&#x27;s west end from the mainland.

In prehistoric times, large quantities of copper were mined on Isle Royale and the nearby Keweenaw Peninsula. The region is scarred by ancient mine pits and trenches up to 20 meters deep. Carbon-14 testing of wood remains found in sockets of copper artifacts indicates that they are at least 6500 years old. 

In &quot;Prehistoric Copper Mining in the Lake Superior Region&quot;, published in 1961, Drier and Du Temple estimated that over 750,000 tons of copper had been mined from the region. However, David Johnson and Susan Martin contend that their estimate was based on exaggerated and inaccurate assumptions. In 1670, a Jesuit missionary named Dablon published an account of &quot;an island called &quot;Menong&quot;, celebrated for its copper.&quot; &quot;Menong&quot;, or &quot;Minong&quot;, was the native term for the island, and is the basis for the name of the Minong Ridge on the island.

Isle Royale was given to the United States by the 1783 treaty with Great Britain, but the British remained in control until after the War of 1812, and the Ojibwa peoples considered the island to be their territory. The Ojibwas ceded the island to the U.S. in the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe, with the Grand Portage Band unaware that neither they nor Isle Royale were in British territory. With the clarification to the Ojibwas of the 1842 Webster–Ashburton Treaty that was signed before the Treaty of La Pointe, the Ojibwas re-affirmed the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe in the 1844 Isle Royale Agreement, with the Grand Portage Band signing the agreement as an addendum to the 1842 treaty.

In the mid-1840s, a report by Douglass Houghton, Michigan&#x27;s first state geologist, set off a copper boom in the state, and the first modern copper mines were opened on the island. Evidence of the earlier mining efforts was everywhere, in the form of many stone hammers, some copper artifacts, and places where copper had been partially worked out of the rock but left in place. The ancient pits and trenches led to the discovery of many of the copper deposits that were mined in the 19th century. The remoteness of the island, combined with the small veins of copper, caused most of the 19th-century mines to fail quickly. Between the miners and commercial loggers, much of the island was deforested during the late 19th century. Once the island became a national park in 1940, logging and other exploitive activities ended, and the forest began to regenerate.

The island was once the site of several lake trout and whitefish fisheries, as well as a few resorts. Today, it has no permanent inhabitants; the small communities of Scandinavian fishermen were removed by the United States National Park Service (NPS) after the island became a national park in the 1940s. About 12 families have lifetime leases for their cabins and claim Isle Royale as their heritage, and several descendant fishermen fish the Isle Royale waters commercially. The western tip of the island is home to several shipwrecks that are very popular with scuba divers, including the SS &quot;America&quot;. The NPS Submerged Resources Center mapped the 10 most famous of the shipwrecks contained within the park, and published &quot;Shipwrecks of Isle Royale National Park; The Archeological Survey&quot;, which gives an overview of the maritime history of the area.

== The Survival of Angelique Mott ==
In 1845, an Ojibwe woman named Angelique and her voyageur husband Charlie Mott were left on Isle Royale, as hires for Cyrus Mendenhall and the Lake Superior Copper Company. They were hired and carried to Isle Royale by Mendenhall&#x27;s schooner, the &quot;Algonquin&quot;, first to scout for copper. Angelique found a large mass of copper ore, upon which she and her husband were hired to stay and guard until a barge could come to retrieve it, promised in no more than 3 months&#x27; time. They were dropped off in July and were left stranded there until the following Spring. They were left with minimal provisions, which consisted of a half-barrel of flour, six pounds of butter, and some beans. A supply boat was promised to arrive after the first few weeks, but it was never sent out. 

Angelique and her husband were left to survive in the wilderness with limited supplies, on an island with scarce resources. They lost their canoe in a fall storm, and their fishing net was destroyed. By January 1846, Charlie went mad with hunger and even threatened to murder and eat Angelique. He returned to himself, loving and soft, but was weakening greatly, and eventually succumbed to his starvation, dying. Angelique was forced to leave the body in the cabin and created a brush shelter for herself to live in. She survived by eating poplar bark, bitter berries, and by pulling out her own hair, plaiting the strands, and creating snares with it, by which she caught rabbits on rare occasions. In the Spring of 1846, the &quot;Algonquin&quot; returned, and brought Angelique back to her mother. She died in 1874, in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.

The full events were chronicled in a footnote as told by Angelique in the first printing of a book called &quot;The Honorable Peter White&quot; by Ralph D. Williams in 1907; Angelique&#x27;s story was pulled from the subsequent printing, thus making it the only written record that survives. Humans haven&#x27;t normally settled year-round on Isle Royale. For about three thousand years, Native Americans used the land for copper and fish. These Native Americans usually limited their visiting to the island in the summer. Americans in the nineteenth century did the same thing.

==National Park==
The island and the 450 surrounding smaller islands and waters make up Isle Royale National Park. It is the least visited national park in the lower 48 states.

==Recreational activities==

Recreational activity on Isle Royale includes hiking, backpacking, fishing, boating, canoeing, kayaking, and observing nature. Wheeled vehicles are not permitted on Isle Royale, such as bicycles or canoe portage devices; however, wheelchairs are allowed.

There are numerous campgrounds, many of which are only accessible by water. There are two small settlements on the island proper: Rock Harbor, which has a resort, a marina, and basic amenities, and Windigo, a smaller facility on the far western end of the island. Both Rock Harbor and Windigo have paid showers and provisions available.

A typical National Park Service campground consists of a few shelters (cabin-like structures with one wall of mosquito-proof screen), individual tent sites with picnic table, and group camping sites. There are one or more pit toilets at each facility. Campgrounds along the shore have a boat dock and overnight boaters are a common sight at some campgrounds. Waterfront locations also attract canoeists and kayakers. No wells are available, thus all water is usually filtered or thoroughly boiled to prevent infection by parasites and bacteria.


===Hiking===
The island offers approximately of hiking trails for everything from day hikes to a two-week circumnavigation hike. Some of the hiking trails are quite challenging, with steep grades. &quot;The most popular, best marked and longest single route ...is the 40-mile Greenstone Ridge Trail that extends down the island&#x27;s backbone.&quot; The trail leads to the peak of Mount Desor, at , the highest point on the island, and passes through northwoods wilderness, and by inland glacial lakes, swamps, bogs and scenic shorelines. The most difficult trail is the Minong Ridge, which has a 13-mile hike from North Lake Desor to Windigo. It passes through quick elevation changes, high plants, and miles upon miles of hiking on ridges overlooking Lake Superior.

==Ecology==
A number of habitats exist on the island, the primary being boreal forest, similar to neighboring Ontario and Minnesota. Upland areas along some of the ridges are effectively &quot;balds&quot; with exposed bedrock and a few scrubby trees, blueberry bushes, and hardy grasses. Occasional marshes exist, which are typically the by-product of beaver activities. There are also several lakes, often with wooded or marshy shores. The climate, especially in lowland areas, is heavily influenced by the cold waters of Lake Superior.

The island is well known among ecologists as the site of a long-term study of a predator-prey system, between moose and eastern timber wolves. L. David Mech began this study in 1958 as a graduate student at Purdue University. There is a cyclical relationship between the two animals: as the moose increase in population, so do the wolves. Eventually, the wolves kill too many moose and begin to starve and lower their reproductive rates.

Historically neither moose nor wolves inhabited Isle Royale. Just prior to becoming a national park the largest mammals on Isle Royale were Canadian lynx and the boreal woodland caribou. Archeological evidence indicates both of these species were present on Isle Royale for 3,500 years prior to being removed by direct human actions (hunting, trapping, mining, logging, fires and possibly the introduction of invasive species). The last boreal woodland caribou documented on Isle Royale was in 1925. Though Canadian lynx were removed by the 1930s some have periodically crossed the ice bridge from neighboring Ontario, Canada, the most recent being an individual sighting in 1980. Though Lynx are no longer present on the island, their primary prey, snowshoe hares, remain. Before the appearance of wolves, coyotes were also a predator on the island. Coyotes appeared around 1905 and disappeared shortly after wolves arrived in the 1950s. Four wolves were brought from Minnesota in 2018, after some debate as to whether the introduction was an unnatural intervention.

Other common mammals are red foxes, beavers, and red squirrels. Some foxes are quite used to human contact, and can be seen prowling the campgrounds at dawn, looking for stray scraps left by unwary campers. For its part, the wolf is an elusive species which avoids human interaction. Few documented cases of direct wolf/human contact exist. Ermine have been periodically sighted around docks. Other mammals that can be seen include mink (along the various lake shores) and muskrats (occasionally at beaver ponds). Several species of bat also exist on the island. Reptiles include the eastern garter snake, painted turtle, and northern redbelly snake. Six species of frogs and three species of salamander also live on the island.

==Access==

The island is accessible by private boat, seaplane, three private commercial ferries, and a National Park Service ferry.

Scheduled ferry service generally runs May through September:

* From Houghton, Michigan, the &quot;Ranger III&quot;, operated by the National Park Service, makes round trips to Rock Harbor two days a week.

* From Copper Harbor, Michigan, the &quot;Isle Royale Queen IV&quot; makes daily round trips to Rock Harbor.

<text>Lead guitar (also known as solo guitar) is a musical part for a guitar in which the guitarist plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs and chords within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops.
In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are often supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs.

==History==
The first form of lead guitar emerged in the 18th century, in the form of classical guitar styles, which evolved from the Baroque guitar, and Spanish Vihuela. Such styles were popular in much of Western Europe, with notable guitarists including Antoine de Lhoyer, Fernando Sor, and Dionisio Aguado. It was through this period of the classical shift to romanticism the six-string guitar was first used for solo composing. Through the 19th century, the classical guitar would find prominence in chamber music ensembles, used for melodic accompaniment, as well as being used in solo composures. These styles would spread into America by the mid-19th century, and would influence early &quot;parlor music&quot;.

Through the later 19th century, Steel Strings began to appear, particularly by Martin Guitars, and by the 1880s the Piedmont Blues style was emerging in the rural south. The Piedmont guitar style would become a heavy influence on Ragtime music, which in turn would influence emerging blues styles in the early 20th century. Through the 1910s, blues guitarists including Willie Brown and Charley Patton began pioneering slide guitar techniques, which would become a staple of the Delta Blues. These techniques would be built upon heavily through the upcoming decades and through the Great Depression by such artists as Tommy Johnson, Ishmon Bracey, Robert Johnson, and Robert Wilkins. Through this period other forms of blues guitar developed often with heavy ragtime or piedmont influence. Among the most prominent of these guitarists include Blind Blake, and Blind Willie McTell the latter playing with thumb and metal finger picks on a Twelve-string guitar to better replicate the sound of the piano. Piedmont and ragtime guitar styles also provided a foundation for early Country Music guitar styles with such musicians as Maybelle Carter, Sam McGee, Bayless Rose, Frank Hutchison heavily developing these styles.

Through the 1920s, the emergence of early jazz and swing guitar styles appear with virtuosos Eddie Lang and Lonnie Johnson, the latter with a heavy blues influence. Lang used a plectrum pick while Johnson played with both finger picks and a plectrum. Later Django Reinhardt would rise to prominence, playing in the Gypsy Jazz style. These guitarists are still often considered the greatest innovators of their styles. At the same time, The Delmore Brothers would pioneer flatpicking guitar through rapid-picking melodic solos which would greatly influence many future guitarists in bluegrass, early rock and roll, and country music. Robert Nighthawk became the first blues musician to record with an electric guitar and would greatly influence such greats as Muddy Waters and Elmore James.

Through the 1940s Merle Travis would greatly develop the fingerpicking techniques pioneered by guitarists like Maybelle and McGee, and develop a style of his own based upon the thumb solely providing the bass line, and the index finger solely providing the melody. This style would be the foundation for many future guitarists including Chet Atkins, Scotty Moore, Doc Watson, and Earl Hooker, though many used two fingers rather than just the index as Travis had done.
==Creating lead guitar lines==
To create lead guitar lines, guitarists use scales, modes, arpeggios, licks, and riffs that are performed using a variety of techniques. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz and fusion bands and some pop contexts as well as others, lead guitar lines often employ alternate picking, sweep picking, economy picking and legato (e.g., hammer ons, pull offs), which are used to maximize the speed of their solos or riffs. Such &quot;tricks&quot; can employ the picking hand used in the fret area (such as tapping), and even be augmented and embellished with devices such as bows, or separate electronic devices such as an EBow (electronic bow).

Some guitarists occasionally use skills that combine technique and showmanship, such as playing the guitar behind their head or picking with the front teeth. In a blues context, as well as others, guitarists sometimes create leads that use call and response-style riffs that they embellish with string bending, vibrato, and slides.

===Jazz guitar soloing===
Jazz guitarists integrate the basic building blocks of scales and arpeggio patterns into balanced rhythmic and melodic phrases that make up a cohesive solo. Jazz guitarists often try to imbue their melodic phrasing with the sense of natural breathing and legato phrasing used by horn players such as saxophone players. As well, a jazz guitarist&#x27;s solo improvisations have to have a rhythmic drive and &quot;timefeel&quot; that creates a sense of &quot;swing&quot; and &quot;groove&quot;. The most experienced jazz guitarists learn to play with different &quot;timefeels&quot; such as playing &quot;ahead of the beat&quot; or &quot;behind the beat&quot;, to create or release tension.

Another aspect of the jazz guitar style is the use of stylistically appropriate ornaments, such as grace notes, slides, and muted notes. Each subgenre or era of jazz has different ornaments that are part of the style of that subgenre or era. Jazz guitarists usually learn the appropriate ornamenting styles by listening to prominent recordings from a given style or jazz era. Some jazz guitarists also borrow ornamentation techniques from other jazz instruments, such as Wes Montgomery&#x27;s borrowing of playing melodies in parallel octaves, which is a jazz piano technique. Jazz guitarists also have to learn how to add in passing tones, and use &quot;guide tones&quot; and chord tones from the chord progression to structure their improvisations.

In the 1970s and 1980s, with jazz-rock fusion guitar playing, jazz guitarists incorporated rock guitar soloing approaches, such as riff-based soloing and usage of pentatonic and blues scale patterns. Some guitarists use rapid-fire guitar shredding techniques, such as tapping and tremolo bar bending. Guitarist Al Di Meola, who started his career with Return to Forever in 1974, was one of the first guitarists to perform in a &quot;shred&quot; style, a technique later used in rock and heavy metal playing. Di Meola used alternate-picking to perform very rapid sequences of notes in his solos.

When jazz guitar players improvise, they use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune&#x27;s chord progression. The approach to improvising has changed since the earliest eras of jazz guitar. During the Swing era, many soloists improvised &quot;by ear&quot; by embellishing the melody with ornaments and passing notes. However, during the bebop era, the rapid tempo and complicated chord progressions made it increasingly harder to play &quot;by ear&quot;. Along with other improvisers, such as saxes and piano players, bebop-era jazz guitarists began to improvise over the chord changes using scales (whole tone scale, chromatic scale, etc.) and arpeggios. Jazz guitar players tend to improvise around chord/scale relationships, rather than reworking the melody, possibly due to their familiarity with chords resulting from their comping role. A source of melodic ideas for improvisation is transcribing improvised solos from recordings. This provides jazz guitarists with a source of &quot;licks&quot;, melodic phrases and ideas they incorporate either intact or in variations, and is an established way of learning from the previous generations of players

==Role in a band==

In a band with two guitars, there can be a logical division between lead and rhythm guitars, although that division may be unclear. Two guitarists may perform as a guitar tandem, and trade off the lead guitar and rhythm guitar roles. Alternatively, two or more guitarists can share the lead and rhythm roles throughout the show, or both guitarists can play the same role (&quot;dual lead guitars&quot; or &quot;dual rhythm guitars&quot;). Often several guitarists playing individual notes may create chord patterns while mixing these &quot;harmonies&quot; with mixed unison passages creating unique sound effects with sound altering electronic special effects such as doublers or a &quot;chorus&quot; effect that over-pronounce the lead significantly sometimes to cut through to be heard in loud shows or throw its sound aesthetically both acoustically or electronically.

==Effects and equipment==
In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz and fusion bands and some pop contexts as well as others, the lead guitar line often involves melodies (as well as power chords from the rhythm guitars) with a sustained, singing tone. To create this tone on the electric guitar, guitarists often select certain pickups and use electronic effects such as effects pedals and distortion pedals, or sound compressors, or doubler effects for a more sustained tone, and delay effects or an electronic &quot;chorus&quot; effect as well as electronic reverb and echo for a reverberant sound.

To attain this sustain effect guitarists often use tube amplifiers such as those from Marshall or Fender.
The tube effect comes from the way amplifying tubes distort when pushed to the limits of their amplification power. As the guitar signal&#x27;s waveform reaches the amplifier&#x27;s limits, amplification decreases—rounding off the top of the waveform. This amounts to compression of individual wave cycles, and is pleasing to the ear.

High volume can induce audio feedback, which a guitarist can control to dramatically increase sustain. By holding the guitar at a certain distance and angle from the amplifier speakers, a guitarist can create a continuous, undecaying sound. Electronic special effects that use effects loops can artificially reproduce this. Other effects that embellish lead guitar tone and pitch include the vibrato bar which physically alters string tension, slides, and wah-wah and univibe effects.

<text>María de los Ángeles Fernández Abad (30 July 1924 – 25 March 1994), known professionally as Angelines Fernández, was a Spanish-born Mexican actress. She is best remembered for playing Doña Clotilde &quot;La Bruja del 71&quot; in the sitcom &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot;. She was an anti-Franco refugee who remained in Mexico (in addition to a brief stint in Cuba) from 1947 until the end of her life.

==Life and career==
María de los Ángeles Fernández Abad also known as María de los Angelines Fernández Abad, was born on 30 July, 1924 in Madrid, Spain. 

She made her acting debut in the musical comedy &quot;Carlo Monte en Monte Carlo&quot; in Isabela Garcés&#x27; theatre company in Madrid. She flew to Mexico in 1947 in fear for her life due to her support for the Spanish Maquis. During the Spanish Civil War, young Fernández was supportive of the Republican faction. She would remain in Mexico for the rest of her life, except for international tours and a short stint in Cuba during the late 1940s. In 1950, she returned to Mexico permanently.

Angelines Fernández starred in fourteen films, including the classic &quot;El Esqueleto de la señora Morales&quot; (1960). In 1964, she took the supporting role of Sara, the nemesis of Cantinflas&#x27;s character Padre Sebastián, in &quot;El padrecito&quot;. She starred in &quot;Cadenas de amor&quot; at the age of 37, and other telenovelas in the 1960s with the second to last one in 1970. It was not until she was hired in 1973 to play &quot;La Bruja del 71&quot; in &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot; that she cemented her status as a legend. She got that job when she asked her personal friend, Ramón Valdés, if he knew of any acting jobs she might be able to do.

She also participated in &quot;Chespirito&quot;″s other show, &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot;, years later. It was with &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot; and &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; that she achieved fame in her native Spain. The two Chespirito productions became wide international hits, reaching virtually every country in the Americas and also other, non-Spanish speaking, countries as well. The shows are still shown with re-runs in many countries. In 1974, she participated in her last telenovela and her last film and concentrated her work around Chespirito productions.

After the shows ended in 1979, she continued playing &quot;La Bruja&quot; on the hour-long &quot;Chespirito&quot; and on public tours. Starting later in the 1980s, she began playing Ignacia Fernández &quot;Doña Nachita&quot;, a second regular character on &quot;Chespirito&quot;, the gossipy neighbor in the &quot;Los caquitos&quot; sketches. She remained on the show until 1992.

==Personal life==
Fernández had a daughter named Paloma Fernández.

==Death==

An acknowledged tobacco smoker, she died on 25 March 1994 from a tobacco related cancer (sources mention it being throat cancer without giving further details). She is entombed at the Mausoleos del Ángel in Mexico City. She was 69.

<text>The Bass Islands are three American islands in the western half of Lake Erie. They are north of Sandusky, Ohio, and south of Pelee Island, Ontario. [[South Bass Island]] () is the largest of the islands, followed closely by [[North Bass Island]] () and [[Middle Bass Island]] (). They are located in Put-in-Bay Township, Ottawa County in the state of Ohio. Historically Middle Bass has also been called &quot;Ile de Fleurs&quot; and North Bass was known as &quot;Isle St. George&quot;.

The Bass Island Archipelago includes the three Bass Islands, plus the Ohio islands of Ballast, Buckeye, Catawba, Gibraltar, Green, Kelleys, Lost Ballast, Mouse, Rattlesnake, Starve, and Sugar, and the Ontario islands of East Sister, Hen (including her three &quot;chickens&quot;: Big Chicken, Chick, and Little Chicken), Middle, Middle Sister, North Harbour, and Pelee.

At their closest points, Middle Bass Island is approximately 0.5 mi (0.8 km) north of South Bass Island and North Bass Island is approximately 1.0 mi (1.6 km) north of Middle Bass Island. The border between Ohio and Ontario is approximately 1.0 mi (1.6 km) north of North Bass Island.

The village of Put-in-Bay on South Bass Island is a popular tourist stop during the summer. Perry&#x27;s Victory and International Peace Memorial, commemorating the Battle of Lake Erie, is located on South Bass Island, near Put-In-Bay. The island is also the annual host of the Inter-Lake Yachting Association regatta, known as Bay Week.

<doc id="440533" wikidata="Q2012827" url="?curid=440533" title="Obbligato">
<text>In Western classical music, obbligato (, also spelled obligato) usually describes a musical line that is in some way indispensable in performance. Its opposite is the marking &quot;ad libitum&quot;. It can also be used, more specifically, to indicate that a passage of music was to be played exactly as written, or only by the specified instrument, without changes or omissions. The word is borrowed from Italian (an adjective meaning &quot;mandatory&quot;; from Latin &quot;obligatus&quot; p.p. of &quot;&quot;, to oblige); the spelling &quot;obligato&quot; is not acceptable in British English, but it is often used as an alternative spelling in the US. The word can stand on its own, in English, as a noun, or appear as a modifier in a noun phrase (e.g. &quot;organ obbligato&quot;).

The term has also come to refer to a countermelody.

==Independence==
&quot;Obbligato&quot; includes the idea of independence, as in C. P. E. Bach&#x27;s 1780 Symphonies (with twelve &quot;obbligato&quot; parts) by which Bach was referring to the independent woodwind parts he was using for the first time. These parts were also &quot;obbligato&quot; in the sense of being indispensable.

==Continuo==
In connection with a keyboard part in the baroque period, &quot;obbligato&quot; has a very specific meaning: it describes a functional change from a &quot;basso continuo&quot; part (in which the player decided how to fill in the harmonies unobtrusively) to a fully written part of equal importance to the main melody part.

==Contradictory usage==
A later use has the contradictory meaning of &quot;optional&quot;, indicating that a part was not obligatory. A difficult passage in a concerto might be furnished by the editor with an easier alternative called the &quot;obbligato&quot; (but more commonly and correctly termed an &quot;ossia&quot;); or a work may have a part for one or more solo instruments, marked &quot;obbligato&quot;, that is decorative rather than essential; the piece is complete and can be performed without the added part. The traditional term for such a part is &quot;ad libitum&quot;, or &quot;ad lib.&quot;, or simply &quot;optional&quot;, since &quot;ad lib.&quot; may have a wide variety of interpretations.

==Contemporary usage==
In classical music the term has fallen out of use by modern-day practitioners, as composers, performers and audiences alike have come to see the musical text as paramount in decisions of musical execution. As a result, everything is now seen as &quot;obbligato&quot; unless explicitly specified otherwise in the score. It is still used to denote an orchestral piece with an instrumental solo part that stands out, but is not as prominent as in a solo concerto, as in Bloch&#x27;s Concerto Grosso mentioned below. The term is now used mainly to discuss music of the past. One contemporary usage, however, is that by Erik Satie in the third movement of &quot;Embryons desséchés&quot; (Desiccated Embryos), where the &quot;obbligato&quot; consists of around twenty F-major chords played at &quot;fortissimo&quot; (this is satirising Beethoven&#x27;s symphonic style).

==Examples==

<text>El Tatio is a geothermal field with many geysers located in the Andes Mountains of northern Chile at above mean sea level. It is the third-largest geyser field in the world and the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. Various meanings have been proposed for the name &quot;El Tatio&quot;, including &quot;oven&quot; or &quot;grandfather&quot;. The geothermal field has many geysers, hot springs, and associated sinter deposits. These hot springs eventually form the Rio Salado, a major tributary of the Rio Loa, and are a major source of arsenic pollution in the river. The vents are sites of populations of extremophile microorganisms such as hyperthermophiles, and El Tatio has been studied as an analogue for the early Earth and possible past life on Mars.

El Tatio lies at the western foot of a series of stratovolcanoes, which runs along the border between Chile and Bolivia. This series of volcanoes is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, one of several volcanic belts in the Andes, and of the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex (APVC). This is a system of large calderas and associated ignimbrites, which have been the sources of supereruptions between 10 and 1 million years ago. Some of these calderas may be the source of heat for the El Tatio geothermal system. There are no recorded eruptions of the Tatio volcanoes in the historical period.

The field is a major tourism destination in northern Chile. It was prospected over the last century for geothermal power production, but development efforts were discontinued after a major incident in 2009 in which a geothermal well blew out, creating a steam column. The blowout caused a political controversy about geothermal power development in Chile.

== Name and research history ==
The term &quot;tatio&quot; comes from the Kunza language and means &#x27;to appear&#x27;, &#x27;oven&#x27;, but it has also been translated as &#x27;grandfather&#x27; (whose tears form the geysers) or &#x27;burnt&#x27;. The geyser field is also known as the Copacoya geysers; Copacoya is the name of a mountain in the area.

The earliest mentions of geysers in the region are from the late 19th century, and they were already well known by 1952. The first geothermal prospecting of the field occurred in the 1920s and the field was mentioned in academic literature in 1943. More systematic research took place in 1967–1982; most research on this geothermal field was done in the context of geothermal prospecting.

}&lt;/mapframe&gt;El Tatio lies in the municipality of Calama, Antofagasta Province of northern Chile close to the border between Chile and Bolivia. The field is located north of the town San Pedro de Atacama and east of the town of Calama; Chile Route B-245 connects El Tatio to San Pedro de Atacama. Towns close to El Tatio are Toconce to the north, Caspana to the west and Machuca to the south. A workers&#x27; camp for a sulfur mine at Volcan Tatio was reported to exist in 1959. The old Inca trail from San Pedro de Atacama to Siloli crossed the geyser field; the Inca also operated a mountain sanctuary on Volcan Tatio. There are several unpaved roads and all parts of the field are easily accessible by foot.
El Tatio is part of the Central Volcanic Zone, a segment of the Andes between 14° and 28° southern latitude where the Andes are volcanically active. This volcanism manifests itself with about 10 silicic caldera complexes of the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex and more than 50 recently active volcanoes; Lascar volcano erupted in 1993 and produced a tall eruption column.

East of the field, andesitic stratovolcanoes reach elevations of about . From north to south, the andesitic stratovolcanoes include the or high Cerro Deslinde which is the highest in the area, the high Cerro El Volcan, the high Cordillera del Tatio and the high Volcan Tatio, which collectively form the El Tatio volcanic group. The Sierra de Tucle lies to the southwest of the field.

Mountains southwest of El Tatio include the high Alto Ojo del Cablor range, while high Cerro Copacoya is situated northwest of the geothermal field. Volcanism with dacitic composition, older than the easterly stratovolcanoes, has occurred west of El Tatio; this volcanism was known as the &quot;liparitic formation&quot; and it covers large areas in the region.

Firn and snow fields were reported in the middle 20th century on the El Tatio volcanic group, at elevations of . The region is too dry to support glaciers today, but in the past higher moisture allowed their formation on mountains of this part of the Andes. Glacially eroded mountains and moraines testify to their existence in the form of large valley glaciers. A large moraine complex, including both terminal structures and well-developed lateral moraines, can be found north of the geyser field and reflects the past existence of a long glacier, the longest valley glacier in the region. Two more moraine systems extend westward both northeast and southeast of El Tatio, and the terrain surrounding the geyser field is covered by sands that are interpreted as glacial outwash sands. Surface exposure dating indicates that some moraines were emplaced at or before the Last Glacial Maximum and others in a time period 35,000 to 40,000 years before present. Smaller moraines at higher altitude may date to the Antarctic Cold Reversal or the Younger Dryas climate periods; moraines related to the Lake Tauca stage are either absent or restricted to high elevation sites.
Drainage in the area is generally from east to west down the Occidental Cordillera, often in form of steeply incised valleys. The Rio Salado drains most of the hot spring water and has its headwaters in the field where it is joined by the Rio Tucle and the Vicuna stream. Temperature measurements of the water flowing to the Rio Salado have yielded values of , while the discharge of the Rio Salado amounts to . The Rio Salado eventually joins the Rio Loa, a major source of freshwater for the region; thus, El Tatio plays an important role in the regional water supply. In the early 20th century there were several hydraulic engineering projects at El Tatio, aiming either to use its waters or to mitigate its impact on downstream water quality.

=== Geothermal field ===
El Tatio is well known as a geothermal field in Chile, and is the largest geyser field in the Southern Hemisphere with about 8% of all geysers in the world. Only the fields at Yellowstone in the United States and Dolina Geizerov in Russia are larger. They also have taller geysers than at El Tatio, where geyser fountains are on average only high. Together with Sol de Mañana, which is just east of El Tatio in Bolivia, it is also the highest-altitude geyser field in the world.
The geothermal field covers an area of at elevations of , and is characterized by fumaroles, hot springs, steam vents and steaming soil. Stronger geothermal activity is located within three discrete areas covering a total of surface, and includes boiling water fountains, hot springs, geysers, mudpots, mud volcanoes and sinter terraces; further, chimneys of extinct geysers have been noted. One of these three areas lies within a valley, the second on a flat surface and the third along the banks of the Rio Salado. The first area offers a notable contrast between the snow-covered Andes, the coloured hills that surround the field and the white deposits left by the geothermal activity. Most geysers of El Tatio are found here and are particularly noticeable in cold weather. A similar landscape exists at the third (lower) area, with the presence of the Rio Salado river adding an additional element to the landscape. The second area is located between a creek and a hill and includes an artificial pool for tourists. Its vents often have higher discharges than others in the field.

About 110 documented geothermal manifestations have been documented at El Tatio, but the total has been estimated at 400. The field once numbered 67 geysers and more than three hundred hot springs. Many vents are linked to fractures that run northwest–southeast or southwest–northeast across the field. Some geyser fountains in the past reached heights greater than ; usually, however, they do not exceed and their activity sometimes varies over time. A few geysers have received names, such as Boiling Geyser, El Cobreloa, El Cobresal, El Jefe, Terrace Geyser, Tower Geyser and Vega Rinconada. Minor eruptions of the geysers occur approximately every dozen minutes and major eruptions every few hours on average, and major eruptions take place after the conduit was &quot;prepared&quot; by multiple smaller ones. The terrain surrounding a geyser tilts as it recharges and discharges. An additional geothermal system lies southeast of and at elevations above El Tatio and is characterized by steam-heated ponds fed by precipitation water, and solfataric activity has been reported on the stratovolcanoes farther east.

Deposition of sinter from the waters of the geothermal field has given rise to spectacular landforms, including, but not limited to mounds, terraced pools, geyser cones and the dams that form their rims. Small-scale features include cones, crusts, mollusc-shaped formations, waterfall-like surfaces and very small terraces. These sinter deposits cover an area of about and include both active and inactive deposits, both of which were emplaced on glacial sediments. High contents of silica give the waters a blueish colour, organic compounds such as carotenoids conversely often colour the sinter with orange-brown, and greenish hues are owing to iron-oxidizing bacteria. Sinter accumulation is so rapid that debris and microbes can become entrapped and preserved in the sinter.

Individual vent types and deposits found at El Tatio include:
* Hot springs form pools with water temperatures of , which are often gently moving and surging and in the case of the warmer springs actively bubbling. These pools often contain ball-like rocks called oncoids and are surrounded by sinter rims, which have spicule-like textures. These sinter rims often form dam-like structures around deeper vents which are filled with water. Spherical grains develop in the hot springs as a consequence of hydrodynamic processes, and include biogenic material; during the growth of the sinter they often end up embedded in the material.
* Water draining from the springs deposits sinter, which can form fairly thick deposits and large aprons when sheet flow occurs, known as &quot;discharge deposits&quot;; sometimes terraces are developed instead. As in springs, oncoids and spicules are observed in channels. Much of the water evaporates and its temperature drops from to less than away from the springs; the low air temperatures cause it to freeze occasionally, resulting in frost weathering.
* Geysers and also water fountains discharge from up to high cones with gently sloping surfaces, which sometimes support splash mounds. The cones are made out of geyserite. Other geysers and fountains instead discharge from within rim-bounded pools, and some geysers are in the bed of the Rio Salado river. The activity of geysers is not stable over time; changes in water supply or in the properties of the conduit that supplies them can cause changes in their eruptive activity. Such changes can be triggered by rainfall events or earthquakes and at El Tatio geyser behaviour changes have been linked to the 2014 Iquique earthquake and a 2013 precipitation event. The water of geysers is hot.
* Mud pools are often bubbling, with the hot mud fountaining. They are mainly found at the edges of the geothermal field and often produce highly acidic water; it converts rocks to clays. Simmering pools of water have been recorded at El Tatio as well.

Subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate is responsible for the formation of the Andes. Volcanism does not occur along the entire length of the Andes; there are three volcanic zones called the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone and the Southern Volcanic Zone, all separated by areas with no Holocene-age volcanism.

El Tatio and a number of other geothermal fields such as Sol de Mañana are part of the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex. The region was dominated by andesitic volcanism producing lava flows until the late Miocene, then large-scale ignimbrite activity took place between 10 and 1 million years ago. This ignimbrite volcanism is part of the APVC proper and produced about of ignimbrites, covering a surface area of . The APVC activity continued into the Holocene with the emission of voluminous lava domes and lava flows, and Tatio was one of the last volcanic centres in the APVC to erupt; the present-day uplift of the Uturunku volcano in Bolivia may signal ongoing activity of the APVC. The APVC is underpinned by a large magma chamber with the shape of a sill, the Altiplano-Puna Magma Body; a number of volcanoes and geothermal systems including El Tatio are geographically associated with the Altiplano-Puna Magma Body.

The Laguna Colorada caldera lies east of El Tatio. The terrain at El Tatio is formed by Jurassic–Cretaceous sediments of marine and volcanic origin, Tertiary–Holocene volcanic formations that were emplaced in various episodes, and recent sediments formed by glaciers, alluvium, colluvium and material formed by the geothermal field, such as sinter. Volcanic formations fill the Tatio graben, including the Miocene Rio Salado ignimbrite and related volcanics which reach thicknesses of in some places, the Sifon ignimbrite, the Pliocene Puripicar ignimbrite and the Pleistocene Tatio ignimbrite; the Puripicar ignimbrite crops out farther west. Active volcanoes in the area include Putana and Tocorpuri.

Hydrothermal alteration of country rock at El Tatio has yielded large deposits of alteration minerals such as illite, nobleite, smectite, teruggite and ulexite. The summit parts of several volcanoes of the El Tatio volcanic group have been bleached and discoloured by hydrothermal activity.

=== Hydrology ===
Most of the water that is discharged by the hot springs appears to originate as precipitation, which enters the ground east and southeast of El Tatio. The source of heat of the complex appears to be the Laguna Colorada caldera, the El Tatio volcanic group, the Cerro Guacha and Pastos Grandes calderas or the Altiplano-Puna Magma Body. The movement of the water in the ground is controlled by the permeability of the volcanic material and the Serrania de Tucle–Loma Lucero tectonic block west of El Tatio that acts as an obstacle. As it moves through the ground, it acquires heat and minerals and loses steam through evaporation. Unlike geothermal fields in wetter parts of the world, given the dry climate of the area, local precipitation has little influence on the hot springs hydrology at El Tatio. Neither magmatic water nor water from local precipitation are mixed into this water. The time the water takes to traverse the whole path from precipitation to the springs is considered to be either 15 years or more than 60, and three-quarters of the heat is transported by steam.

The water travels through a number of aquifers that correspond to permeable rock formations, such as the Salado and Puripicar ignimbrites, the Tucle dacites as well as through faults and fractures in the rock. It steeply ascends under El Tatio and appears to be confined between northeast-trending fault systems such as the &quot;Tatio fault&quot;. Three separate geothermal reservoirs have been identified, which underlie the Cerros del Tatio and extend to the La Torta volcano; they are connected by, and partly formed in cavities formed by faults. The Puripicar ignimbrite appears to be the main hydrothermal reservoir, with temperatures reaching . The total heat output of El Tatio is about . The hydrothermal system beneath El Tatio appears to extend to the neighbouring La Torta system.

Depending on the season, the hot springs yield of water at temperatures reaching the local boiling point. The water is rich in minerals, especially sodium chloride and silica. Other compounds and elements in order of increasing concentration are antimony, rubidium, strontium, bromine, magnesium, caesium, lithium, arsenic, sulfate, boron, potassium and calcium. Inorganic carbon (carbonate) occurs at a low concentration.

Some of these minerals are toxic, especially arsenic which pollutes a number of waters in the region. Arsenic concentrations in waters at El Tatio can reach – among the highest concentrations found in hot springs of the whole world – and in sediments. Producing about , El Tatio is a principal source of arsenic in the Rio Loa system, and arsenic pollution in the region has been linked to health issues in the population.

Composition of these hot springs is not uniform in El Tatio, with chloride content decreasing from the northern springs over the southwestern ones to the eastern springs, where sulfate is more frequent. This sulfate enrichment appears to be driven by the steam-driven evaporation of the hot spring water, with the sulfate forming when hydrogen sulfide is oxidized by atmospheric oxygen. The decreasing chloride content on the other hand appears to be due to drainage coming from the east diluting the southern and western and especially eastern spring systems.

=== Fumaroles ===
Steam vents are particularly noticeable in the morning hours when the steam columns emanating from them are visible, and temperatures of have been found. Carbon dioxide is the most important fumarole gas, followed by hydrogen sulfide. The amount of water relative to these two gases is variable, probably due to condensation of water in the ground.

Additional components include argon, helium, hydrogen, methane, neon, nitrogen and oxygen. Characteristically for fumarole gases on convergent plate boundaries, much of this nitrogen is non-atmospheric. However, atmospheric air is also involved in generating the chemistry of the El Tatio fumarole gases.

=== Composition of spring deposits ===
Opal is the most important component of sinter associated with hot springs; halite, sylvite and realgar are less common. This dominance of opal is because usually conditions favour its precipitation from water but not of other minerals, and it occurs both in subaqueous environments and on surfaces that are only occasionally wetted. During the precipitation, the opal forms tiny spheres which can aggregate as well as glassy deposits.

Halite and other evaporites are more commonly encountered on the sinter surfaces outside of the hot springs, and while opal dominates these environments too, sassolite and teruggite are found in addition to the aforementioned four minerals in the discharge deposits.
Cahnite has also been identified in sinter deposits. Volcanic minerals such as plagioclase and quartz are found within cavities of the sinter. Sandstone formed by debris flows and redeposited volcanic material is found embedded in sinter at some localities. Finally, antimony, arsenic and calcium form sulfidic deposits in some springs.

Various facies have been identified in drill cores through the sinter, including arborescent, columnar, fenestral palisade, laminated (both inclined and planar), particulate, spicular and tufted structures. These structures contain varying amounts of microfossils and formed at diverse temperatures and locations of individual sinter mounds. Microorganisms and material like pollen is found integrated within the sinter deposits. The rate at which sinter is deposited has been estimated at .

== Climate and biology ==
The climate is dry with about precipitation per year. Most of it falls between December and March, a precipitation pattern mediated by the South American monsoon and by the South Pacific High which is responsible for the dry climate. The whole Central Andes were wetter in the past, resulting in the formation of lakes such as Lake Tauca in the Altiplano. This, and a colder climate, resulted in the development of glaciers at El Tatio, which have left moraines.

The region is additionally rather windy with mean windspeeds of , which influence the hot springs by enhancing evaporation and imparting a directional growth to certain finger-like sinter deposits. The evaporation rates per month reach and they facilitate the deposition of sinters. There is a diurnal cycle in wind and atmospheric humidity, with no wind and high humidity during the night and wind with low humidity during the day. The atmospheric pressure at this elevation drops to about 0.58 atmospheres, lowering the boiling point of water to about .

Apart from precipitation, the area is characterized by extreme temperature variations between day and night which can reach and induce freeze-thaw cycles. The Chilean Dirección General del Agua operates a weather station at El Tatio; according to data from this station air temperatures average and precipitation . El Tatio further features high ultraviolet (UV) insolation, which can reach UV-A and UV-B. The low atmospheric pressure and high UV irradiation has led scientists to treat El Tatio as an analogue for environments on Mars.

The dry grassland vegetation of the region is classified as Central Andean dry puna and lies above the treeline. About 90 plant species have been identified at El Tatio and surroundings, such as the endemic &quot;Adesmia atacamensis&quot;, &quot;Calceolaria stellariifolia&quot;, &quot;Junellia tridactyla&quot; and &quot;Opuntia conoidea&quot;. Tussock grasses like &quot;Anatherostipa&quot;, &quot;Festuca&quot; and &quot;Stipa&quot; occur at elevation, while rosette and cushion plants reach elevations of ; these include &quot;Azorella&quot;, &quot;Chaetanthera&quot;, &quot;Mulinum&quot;, &quot;Senecio&quot;, &quot;Lenzia&quot;, &quot;Pycnophyllum&quot; and &quot;Valeriana&quot;. Bushland species include &quot;Lenzia chamaepitys&quot;, &quot;Senecio puchii&quot; and &quot;Perezia atacamensis&quot;, while &quot;Arenaria rivularis&quot;, &quot;Oxychloe andina&quot; and &quot;Zameioscirpus atacamensis&quot; grow in wetlands. Riparian vegetation occurs along the Rio Salado. Among the animals in the region are chinchillas and viscachas and llamas, mainly the vicuña.

=== Spring biology ===
The geothermal field El Tatio is populated by various plants, microbes and animals. The vents are an extreme environment, given the presence of arsenic, the large amount of UV radiation that El Tatio receives and its high elevation.

Hot springs have characteristic microbial communities associated with them that leave characteristic fossil traces in the spring deposits; environmental conditions on the early Earth resembled these of hot springs with potentially high UV radiation exposure, as the ozone layer did not yet exist and life probably developed within such conditions. In addition, microbial metabolism of arsenic influences its toxicity and the effects of arsenic pollution.

==== Microorganisms ====
Biofilms and microbial mats are omnipresent at El Tatio, including &quot;Arthrospira&quot;, &quot;Calothrix&quot;, &quot;Fischerella&quot;, &quot;Leptolyngbya&quot;, &quot;Lyngbya&quot; and &quot;Phormidium&quot; cyanobacteria, which form mats within the hot springs covering the solid surfaces, including oncoids and the sinter. In other places, the aforementioned three genera form stromatolithic structures or floating rafts of bubbly mats. The mats have tufted, layered and conical textures and their colours include orange and olive green; they give the channels and pools their colour. Additional cyanobacteria genera reported from El Tatio are &quot;Chroococcidiopsis&quot;, &quot;Chlorogloeocystis&quot;, &quot;Chroogloeopsis&quot;, &quot;Fischerella&quot;, &quot;Synechococcus&quot; and &quot;Thermosynechococcus&quot;. Non-cyanobacteria bacteria have also been found in the mats and sinter; they include heterotrophic bacteria such as &quot;Isosphaera pallida&quot;.

There is a thermal gradation of microorganisms, with the hottest waters supporting &quot;Chloroflexus&quot; green bacteria and hyperthermophiles, cyanobacteria at less than water temperature and diatoms at even lower temperatures. Microbial mats have been found at other hot springs in the world such as Yellowstone and Steamboat Springs, both in the United States, and New Zealand, but they are thinner at El Tatio.

These mats often have their organic material replaced with opal and thus end up forming much of the sinter, which has thus characteristic biogenic textures, such as filaments and laminae. Such biogenic textures have been observed on sinter deposits around the world and are usually microbial in origin, at El Tatio they sometimes feature still living bacteria which can get entombed and preserved within the sinter deposits. In the case of El Tatio, these biogenic textures are particularly well preserved in the sinter deposited by water flowing away from springs. &quot;Chloroflexus&quot; is a thermophilic filamentous green bacterium found in hot waters at Yellowstone; filamentous structures within geyser cones at El Tatio may have been formed by this bacterium. In splash cones &quot;Synechococcus&quot;-like microbes are instead responsible for the structures, which resemble those of hot springs. Sinter absorbs much of UV radiation, protecting microorganisms that dwell within the sinter against this harmful radiation although it also absorbs light required for photosynthesis.

Diatoms are also found in El Tatio waters, including &quot;Synedra&quot; species, which are often found attached to filamentous substrates, and algae are found in the waters. Among bacteria identified in the somewhat colder flowing waters are Bacteroidota and Pseudomonadota, with &quot;Thermus&quot; species in the hot waters. Various archaeans have been cultured from El Tatio waters, with hot springs producing Thermoproteota (formerly crenarchaea), desulfurococcales, and methanobacteriales. One species, &quot;Methanogenium tatii&quot;, has been discovered at El Tatio, and is a methanogen recovered from a warm pool. The species name is derived from the geothermal field and other methanogens may be active in El Tatio.

==== Macroorganisms ====
In the upper geyser basin, vegetation has been observed to grow within thermal areas, like a thermal marsh. A wetland, known as Vega Rinconada, with hydrothermal vents lies west of the upper geyser basin. Animal species found at El Tatio include the snail &quot;Heleobia&quot;, the frog &quot;Rhinella spinulosa&quot;, and water mites. The larvae of this frog at El Tatio live in water with approximately constant temperatures of and show atypical development patterns compared to frogs of the same species that developed in places with more variable water temperatures. &quot;Liolaemus&quot; lizard species have been recovered from the geyser area.

====Analogies to Mars====

The climate, environment and hydrothermal activity at El Tatio has been used as analogues for processes that took place on early Mars. Some microstructures found in the Columbia Hills at the Home Plate landform are similar to these biogenic structures at El Tatio, but do not necessarily imply that the microstructures on Mars are biogenic.

== Geological history ==
During the Pliocene–Quaternary the Cordillera Occidental was subject to extensional tectonics. A related fault system was active; it is linked to Sol de Mañana in Bolivia and controls the position of several vents in El Tatio. The intersection between northwest–southeast trending, north-northwest-south-southeast-trending lineaments at El Tatio has been correlated with the occurrence of geothermal activity. The tectonics of the El Tatio area were originally interpreted as reflecting the existence of a graben before a compressive tectonic regime was identified.

A series of ignimbrites was emplaced. The first was the 10.5–9.3 million year old Rio Salado ignimbrite, which forms a thick layer; this might imply that the source of this ignimbrite was close to El Tatio. The Rio Salado ignimbrite elsewhere crops out as two flow units, with varying colours, and close to El Tatio it is crystalline and densely welded. It was followed by the 8.3 million year old voluminous Sifon ignimbrite, which reaches a thickness of about in the area. The Pliocene Puripicar ignimbrite reaches a similar thickness, and it was later downwarped by faulting.

This strong ignimbrite volcanism is associated with activity of the Altiplano–Puna volcanic complex, which has produced large volume dacite ignimbrites and sizable calderas, starting from the middle Miocene. Among these, Cerro Guacha, La Pacana, Pastos Grandes and Vilama produced supereruptions.

The Tatio ignimbrite was emplaced 710,000 ± 10,000 years ago, while the Tucle volcanics are dated to 800,000 ± 100,000 years ago. The ignimbrite reaches a volume of and crops out over a surface area of . The Tatio ignimbrite contains rhyolitic pumice and crystals, while the Tucle volcanics are andesitic and include both lava and tuffs. The El Tatio ignimbrite ponded in the El Tatio area and may have originated at the Tocorpuri rhyolite dome, which is less than one million years old, in a vent now buried beneath the El Tatio volcanic group, or at the Laguna Colorada caldera.

The El Tatio volcanic group has likewise been dated to be less than one million years old, and its lavas overlie the older formations. Volcan Tatio erupted mafic lavas probably during the Holocene; later this volcano was reinterpreted to be of Pleistocene age. Petrological data suggest that over time the erupted lavas of the El Tatio volcanic group have become more mafic, with older products being andesitic and later ones basaltic-andesitic.

There is no recorded historical volcanism in the El Tatio area and volcanism has not directly affected it for about 27,000 years. Based on the rates of sinter precipitation and the thickness of the sinter deposits, it has been estimated that the sinters at El Tatio started to form between 4,000 and 1,500 years ago; these age estimates were not based on direct dating of the deposits, however, and older sinter deposits extend past the present-day geothermal field. Later, radiocarbon dating of the sinter deposits found that their deposition began after the end of the last ice age, an observation endorsed by the presence of glacial deposits beneath the sinter and radiocarbon dating evidence that sinter deposition began after glaciers retreated. Research published in 2020 suggests that the geothermal activity commenced in the southern part of the field about 27,000–20,000 years ago and spread northwards, reaching the western part of the field less than 4,900 years ago. Secular variations in the deposition rate have been found, with an increase noted in the last 2,000 years.

== Geothermal exploitation ==

Geothermal energy comes from the internal heat of the Earth, where the heat flow is sufficiently high that it can be used for heating and for the generation of electrical power. In Chile, various legal and economic hurdles have so far prevented substantial development of geothermal energy.

The earliest references to geothermal power at El Tatio go back to the beginning of the 20th century, when a private society &quot;Comunidad de El Tatio&quot; was founded by Italians in Antofagasta and employed Italian engineers from Larderello, which in 1921 and 1922 probed the field. Technical and economic problems prevented this first effort from further progress. Feasibility studies in northern Chile identified El Tatio as a potential site for geothermal power generation, with large-scale prospecting taking place in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1973 and 1974, wells were drilled and it was estimated that if the geothermal resources were fully exploited, about of electric power could be produced, but the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;etat derailed further exploration efforts. Also in 1974 a desalination facility was built at El Tatio and could still be seen there in 2003; a thermal desalination process was developed at El Tatio, which could be used both for creating fresh water and brine that could be reprocessed for valuable minerals. Drilling substantially altered the behaviour of the hot springs; already in November 1995, reports indicated that a number of geysers had disappeared or become hot springs and fumaroles.

El Tatio is remote and this along with economic difficulties eventually led to the abandonment of the efforts at power generation; a bidding process for exploration rights in 1978 to attract private companies to El Tatio was interrupted by government changes and until 2000 geothermal development programs were paralyzed.

More recently in the 2000s several companies expressed interest in restarting geothermal power projects at El Tatio. A dispute over gas supplies for Northern Chile from Argentina in 2005 helped push the project forward, and after an environmental impact review in 2007 the Chilean government in 2008 granted a concession to develop geothermal resources in the field, with the expected yield being about 100-40 megawatt. The first drilling permits were issued for the Quebrada de Zoquete area away from the main field.

=== Controversy ===

On 8 September 2009, an older well in El Tatio that was being reused blew out, generating a high steam fountain that was not plugged until 4 October. The operator of the geothermal project restricted access to the blow-out vent and stated through the technical manager of the El Tatio geothermal project that the blowout was neither a threat to the springs nor to tourists visiting El Tatio, and the Empresa Nacional de Geotermia company that operates it denied any responsibility for the incident.

The project had earlier been opposed by the local Atacameño population, owing to concerns about environmental damage and the religious importance of water and El Tatio in the region. Before the incident, an issue of the English-language newspaper &quot;The Economist&quot; had called attention to the adverse consequences of geothermal power extraction; the incident triggered a major controversy over geothermal power, with ramifications beyond Chile. The controversy gained widespread national and international attention, leading to the Chilean government shutting down geothermal exploration at El Tatio and drawing attention to the drawbacks of geothermal power generation. There were public demonstrations against the project, such as the march of two women to the capital Santiago to defend the geothermal field. The environmental authorities of Antofagasta subsequently suspended the El Tatio geothermal project, and the Geotérmica del Norte company responsible for the project received strong criticism and was targeted by legal action. Both the Ministers of Mining and Energy cautioned against stigmatizing geothermal energy, however, and some local authorities disagreed with the rejection. The director of the National Geology and Mining Service (SERNAGEOMIN) stated that the company had no plans to handle such a situation. The Geotérmica del Norte company was fined 100 (a Chilean unit of account for fines and sanctions) for violating mitigation plans, a fine upheld in 2011 by the Court of Appeals in Santiago. Legal cases related to the Tatio field went as far as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.

Industry-community disputes have occurred before in northern Chile, typically tied to conflicts about the use of water, which was in large part privatized during the Pinochet era; during the Tatio controversy, power generation and relations between the Chilean government and native communities also gained prominence among the disputed issues. An important factor in the Tatio controversy is the role of the tourism industry, which viewed the geothermal project as a threat; this kind of industry-industry conflict was unusual. Geothermal projects in New Zealand and the United States have resulted in the extinction of geysers. While the incident ultimately did not result in lasting changes to the El Tatio geysers, the widespread media attention did create adverse publicity and social opposition - in particular among indigenous leaders in the region - against geothermal energy in Chile.

== Tourism ==
El Tatio is a tourism destination, with substantial numbers of travelers both from Chile and other countries. This tourism is an important economic resource for the region, and the site is administered by the local Atacameño population as part of a wider trend of cooperations between native communities and heritage sites in the region. About 100,000 tourists visit El Tatio every year. In 2009, there were more than 400 daily visitors of the geysers, about 90 percent of all tourism of San Pedro de Atacama from where El Tatio can be reached. Aside from viewing the geysers, bathing in the hot water, watching the natural scenery and visiting surrounding Atacameño villages with their adobe buildings are other activities possible at El Tatio. Environmental impacts such as pollution and vandalism of geothermal landforms have been documented.
El Tatio displays some typical hazards of geothermal areas. Exposure to the hot gases and water can result in burn injuries, and both sudden eruptions of geysers and fountains and fragile ground above vents and above boiling water, concealed beneath thin covers of solid ground, increase the risk to unwary travelers. The site lies at high altitude, frequently leading to altitude sickness, and the cold dry climate creates further danger. The Chilean government recommends that tourists take warm clothing, sunscreen and mineral water.

The indigenous communities of Toconce and Caspana administer the geysers. In 2002, El Tatio was declared part of a &quot;zone of touristic interest&quot;; a classification which implies that local institutions ought to develop an action plan to induce the development of tourism. In 2009, José Antonio Gómez Urrutia, then-senator of Chile for the Antofagasta region proposed that El Tatio be declared a natural sanctuary (a type of protected area); the corresponding parliamentary motion was approved in the same year. In 2010, the El Tatio area was declared to be a protected area, with a surface area of . It was not clear at that time what the exact status would be, with the regional Secretary of Agriculture proposing that it should become a national park. In 2022, the International Union of Geological Sciences listed it among its 100 heritage sites.

<text>USS &quot;Grunion&quot; (SS-216) was a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine that sank at Kiska, Alaska, during World War II. She was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the grunion.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Grunion&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut, on 1 March 1941. She was launched on 22 December 1941, sponsored by Mrs. Stanford C. Hooper, wife of Rear Admiral Stanford Caldwell Hooper, and commissioned on 11 April 1942 with Lieutenant Commander Mannert L. Abele, USNA class of 1926, in command.

==Service history==
After shakedown from New London, Connecticut, &quot;Grunion&quot; sailed for the Pacific on 24 May. A week later, as she transited the Caribbean Sea for Panama, she rescued 16 survivors of the USAT &quot;Jack&quot;, which had been torpedoed by the German U-boat , and conducted a fruitless search for 13 other survivors presumed to be in the vicinity. Arriving at Coco Solo on 3 June, &quot;Grunion&quot; landed the survivors and continued on to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 20 June.

Departing Hawaii on 30 June after ten days of intensive training, &quot;Grunion&quot; touched Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands before heading toward the Aleutian Islands for her first war patrol. Her first report, made as she patrolled north of Kiska Island, stated she had been attacked by a Japanese destroyer and had fired Mark 14 torpedoes at her with inconclusive results. She operated off Kiska throughout July and sank two Japanese sub-chasers (&quot;CH-25&quot; and &quot;CH-27&quot;) as she waited for enemy shipping. On 30 July, the submarine reported intensive antisubmarine activity and was ordered back to Dutch Harbor.

&quot;Grunion&quot; was never heard from again. Air searches off Kiska were fruitless, and on 5 October &quot;Grunion&quot; was reported overdue from patrol and assumed lost with all hands. Her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 2 November 1942. Captured Japanese records show no antisubmarine attacks in the Kiska area, and the fate of &quot;Grunion&quot; remained a mystery for 65 years, until the discovery in the Bering Sea in August 2007 of a wreck believed to be her. In October 2008, the U.S. Navy verified that the wreck is &quot;Grunion&quot;.

==Honors and awards==
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with one battle star for World War II service.

== Finding &quot;Grunion&quot; ==
In 1998 Lieutenant Colonel Richard Lane purchased for $1 a wiring diagram from a Japanese cargo ship, &quot;Kano Maru&quot;, which had been active during World War II. Hoping to authenticate the document, Lane posted it on a Japanese naval historical website, asking if anyone could help. He was contacted by Yutaka Iwasaki, a Japanese naval historian, who not only authenticated it, but suggested he knew what happened to &quot;Grunion&quot;. Lane contacted ComSubPac, and their public affairs officer, Darrel Ames, posted the information on ComSubPac&#x27;s &quot;Grunion&quot; Web site.

When &quot;Grunion&quot; disappeared in 1942, her captain, Lieutenant Commander Abele, left behind three sons — Bruce, Brad, and John. For nearly 65 years, they had been searching for information about the loss of their father&#x27;s boat.

When the Abele brothers encountered the post, they contacted Yutaka Iwasaki. He sent them a translation of an article written by the officer who had commanded the merchant ship &quot;Kano Maru&quot;. The article described an encounter with a submarine near Kiska Island in the Aleutians about the time &quot;Grunion&quot; was reported missing.

Several years later, John Abele, cofounder of Boston Scientific, met Dr. Robert Ballard, famous for discovering the wreck of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. Ballard gave him advice on how to locate a shipwreck, and Abele decided to fund an expedition to find the lost submarine &quot;Grunion&quot;.

In 2006, Williamson Associates, using side-scan sonar, located a promising target almost at the exact location indicated by the commander of &quot;Kano Maru&quot;. The sunken object had many characteristics typical of a submarine. In 2007, using a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV), DSSI/&quot;Oceaneering&quot;, returned to the site and took video recordings of the imploded remains of a submarine, which had markings in English, and propeller guards and limber holes identical to those of &quot;Grunion&quot;. The following year, the U.S. Navy confirmed that the find was &quot;Grunion&quot;.

Although it is not absolutely certain, the evidence strongly suggests that &quot;Grunion&quot; was lost as a result of multiple torpedo failures during her encounter with &quot;Kano Maru&quot;. Her first torpedo ran low, but despite its magnetic pistol it failed to detonate. Two more bounced harmlessly off &quot;Kano Maru&quot; without exploding. However, the remaining torpedo missed its target and circled back, striking the periscope supports on the submerged submarine without exploding. The damage the torpedo inflicted, combined with a jammed rear dive plane, triggered a sequence of events that caused the loss of depth control. &quot;Grunion&quot; lunged below her maximum operational depth, and at about would have imploded. What remained of the ship struck the seabed, breaking off about of her bow. The wreckage then slid down the side of an extinct volcano, coming to rest on a notch in the underwater mountain.

In 2019, the missing bow section was located from the rest of the submarine on a slope of an underwater volcano at a depth of over .

<doc id="440540" wikidata="Q7403" url="?curid=440540" title="Emperor An of Jin">
<text>Emperor An of Jin (; 382 – 28 January 419), personal name Sima Dezong (), was an emperor of the Eastern Jin in China. He was described as so developmentally disabled that he was unable to speak, clothe himself, or be able to express whether he was hungry or full. He was created crown prince in 387 and ascended the throne in 397. Because of his disability, the actual power was controlled by his uncle, Sima Daozi, Prince of Kuaiji. During his reign, regents and warlords dominated the Jin regime. Revolts by various governors also ravaged the land. From 398 to 403, there were constant revolts and civil war campaigns. In 403, the Jin regime was usurped by the warlord Huan Xuan, and while Emperor An was restored in 404, the Jin Dynasty was nearing its end. With the warlord Liu Yu as the actual power, Jin destroyed Southern Yan and Later Qin, greatly expanding its territory. However, with Liu Yu up in the north, the renegade governor of Guang Province (廣州, modern Guangdong and Guangxi), Lu Xun (卢循; descendant of Lu Zhi), rebelled and threatened the capital city Jiankang, before Liu Yu returned and crushed the revolt. In 419, Emperor An was strangled under the order of Liu Yu and replaced with his brother Emperor Gong, who would be the last emperor of the dynasty, before Liu Yu took the throne and establish the Liu Song dynasty.

== Early life ==
Sima Dezong was the oldest son of Emperor Xiaowu, born of his concubine Consort Chen Guinü in 382. It is not known when Sima Dezong&#x27;s developmental disability became known, but it was likely very early in his childhood, for the degree of his disability, according to historians, was great. When he was just seven years old, in 390, his mother died. Even though he had a younger brother, Sima Dewen, born of Consort Chen as well (in 386), who was described to be intelligent and careful, and who learned to take care of him throughout the years, for reasons unknown, Emperor Xiaowu appeared to have never seriously considered making Sima Dewen his heir; in 16 September 387, Sima Dezong was created crown prince. In 395, he was set up in his own residence, the eastern palace, as was customary for crown princes. In 396, he married the daughter of the official Wang Xianzhi, Wang Shen&#x27;ai, as his crown princess.

In 397, Emperor Xiaowu was killed by his concubine Honoured Lady Zhang, after offending her. However, with the emperor&#x27;s only brother Sima Daozi, Prince of Kuaiji, being incompetent and Crown Prince Dezong being developmentally disabled, no investigation into Emperor Xiaowu&#x27;s death was conducted. Crown Prince Dezong succeeded to the throne as Emperor An, and Sima Daozi became regent.

== Under Sima Daozi&#x27;s regency ==
Sima Daozi, as regent, was constantly drunk and greatly trusted Wang Guobao () and Wang Xu () because of their flattery, and his regency quickly developed a reputation for being corrupt and incompetent. The provincial governor Wang Gong (), whom Emperor Xiaowu entrusted with the armies of the northeastern part of the empire, considered starting a rebellion to overthrow Wang Guobao and Wang Xu. In 397, Wang Guobao and Wang Xu suggested to Sima Daozi that the armies that Wang Gong and another provincial governor, Yin Zhongkan (), were in charge of be reduced; Wang Gong and Yin, who was in command of the western provinces, in response, mobilized their forces and declared that Wang Guobao and Wang Xu should be executed. Sima Daozi, in fear, forced Wang Guobao to commit suicide and executed Wang Xu. Wang Gong and Yin then retreated. From this point on, Sima Daozi trusted no one but his teenage heir apparent, Sima Yuanxian, and entrusted the capital guards to Sima Yuanxian. He also gave military commands to his distant relatives Sima Shangzhi () the Prince of Qiao and Sima Shangzhi&#x27;s brother Sima Xiuzhi, as well as Wang Yu (), in 398.

The giving of a military command to Wang Yu oddly drew a reaction from Wang Gong and Yin—as Wang Yu&#x27;s command included four commanderies originally under the command of Yu Kai (; grandson of Yu Liang), who became angry and managed to persuade Wang Gong and Yin that Sima Daozi&#x27;s intention was to act against them as well. They therefore rose again, but Sima Daozi was able to persuade Wang Gong&#x27;s general Liu Laozhi (), who was in command of the elite Beifu Forces (), to suddenly turn against Wang Gong, capturing and executing him. Yin, hearing of Wang Gong&#x27;s death, was in fear but considered proceeding anyway—and Sima Daozi, under suggestion by Huan Xuan&#x27;s cousin Huan Xiu (), managed to cause dissension between Yin and his generals Huan Xuan and Yang Quanqi () by offering Huan and Yang key posts; although Huan and Yang nominally remained Yin&#x27;s allies, Yin was forced to withdraw his troops, and from that point on no longer posed a major threat, as his domain had now been divided into three, with Huan and Yang each given a third.

In late 398, the magician Sun Tai (), a friend of Sima Yuanxian&#x27;s, who had gathered great following due to his magic, was exposed as planning a plot to take over the central government, and Sima Daozi ordered Sima Yuanxian to trap Sun Tai and execute him. Sun Tai&#x27;s nephew Sun En fled to Zhoushan Island and planned revenge.

In summer 399, Sima Yuanxian, wanting even greater power, took an opportunity when his father was very drunk to have Emperor An issue an edict transferring Sima Daozi&#x27;s authorities to Sima Yuanxian. When Sima Daozi awoke from his stupor, he was enraged, but after that point his power became extremely limited, even though he nominally remained regent.

== Under Sima Yuanxian&#x27;s regency ==
Sima Yuanxian&#x27;s regency was one in which he became surrounded by flatterers, and he began to have unrealistic ambitions of ending the threat that various provincial warlords posed to his rule. He greatly trusted the strategist Zhang Fashun (), and also introduced many trusted associates into the administration. While he appeared to have some abilities, he also was, according to traditional historians, wasting the government&#x27;s money in luxury and not paying attention to the burdens of the people. Late in 399, Sun En, seeing how the only province remaining under Jin imperial government&#x27;s actual control—Yang Province (揚州, modern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu) -- had been mismanaged by Sima Yuanxian, launched a major attack from Zhoushan Island, briefly taking over nearly all of Yang Province and advancing on the capital Jiankang (modern Nanjing, Jiangsu). Sun&#x27;s rebellion was soon put down by Liu Laozhi, and Sun fled back to Zhoushan (but would remain a menace for several years), but Yang Province had been laid to waste. Despite this, Sima Yuanxian grew increasingly extravagant and arrogant.

In late 401, apprehensive of the growing power of Huan Xuan (who had in late 399 defeated and killed Yin Zhongkan and Yang Quanqi, seizing their domains and now controlled more than two thirds of Jin territory), Sima Yuanxian declared Huan a renegade and ordered an attack against Huan. However, he was largely dependent on Liu Laozhi&#x27;s army, and Liu distrusted Sima Yuanxian. Meanwhile, Huan advanced east toward the capital and, after he made overtures to Liu, Liu turned against Sima Yuanxian. Jiankang fell to Huan, and Sima Yuanxian was captured and executed, along with all of his major associates. Huan also had Sima Daozi exiled and killed and became in full control of the empire. Not trusting of the treacherous Liu, Huan stripped him of his military command, and Liu tried to rebel again—but his own army officers were tired of repeated rebellions and deserted him, and he committed suicide.

== Takeover and usurpation by Huan Xuan ==
Huan Xuan initially tried to institute reforms of the imperial government, and the populace and governmental officials were pleased with changes he introduced, and he also tried to make peace with Sun En&#x27;s brother-in-law Lu Xun (), who replaced Sun En after Sun En committed suicide after a battlefield loss in 402, by offering Lu a commandery governorship. However, Huan Xuan soon took to living luxuriously and modifying laws at whim, and it was said that supplies to the imperial household were so reduced that even Emperor An almost suffered from hunger and cold.

In fall 403, Huan Xuan had Emperor An create him the Prince of Chu and give him the nine bestowments—both signs of an impending usurpation. In winter 403, Huan Xuan had Emperor An issue an edict (an edict that, according to traditional historians, Huan Xuan had Sima Bao () the Prince of Linchuan force Emperor An to personally write, although this account appears doubtful, as Emperor An&#x27;s handicap makes it unlikely that he could personally write this edict) giving the throne to Huan Xuan. Huan then took the throne as emperor of a new Chu state. He created Emperor An as the Prince of Pinggu, but kept the emperor and his brother Sima Dewen the Prince of Langya (now reduced in rank to Duke of Shiyang) under virtual house arrest.

In spring 404, Huan Xuan&#x27;s general Liu Yu, seeing that Huan Xuan lacked actual talent or popular support, led an uprising of a coalition of generals against him, starting the uprising at Jingkou (京口, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) and reaching Jiankang within a few days. Huan Xuan fled, but took Emperor An and Sima Dewen with him, back to his old power base Jiangling (江陵, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei). Liu Yu declared the restoration of Jin, and by summer 404, forces under his confederates Liu Yi (), He Wuji (), and his brother Liu Daogui () had reached the vicinity of Jiangling and defeated Huan Xuan&#x27;s troops. Huan Xuan tried to flee again, but was killed by forces of the general Mao Qu (). Emperor An was declared to be restored at Jiangling by the officials Wang Kangchan () and Wang Tengzhi (). However, Huan Xuan&#x27;s nephew Huan Zhen () soon surprised Wang Kangchan and Wang Tengzhi and captured Jiangling, taking Emperor An hostage, although ostensibly honoring him as the emperor. In spring 405, Jiangling fell to Liu Yi&#x27;s forces, and Huan Zhen fled. Emperor An was welcomed back to Jiankang, but at this point on, Liu Yu was largely in control of the situation.

== Under Liu Yu&#x27;s regency ==

=== Early years ===
Liu Yu, although he had ambitions to be emperor, learned from Huan Xuan&#x27;s failures that he could not act too quickly, but must establish his authority through further victories first, particularly since because he led a coalition of generals and officials with different agendas in his victory over Huan. He therefore proceeded cautiously, initially sharing power with He Wuji and Liu Yi, among others. For the next few years, he also made several offers to resign his posts, judging correctly that the imperial officials would not dare to accept them, to further establish the image that he was indispensable.

In spring 405, Mao Qu&#x27;s soldiers, from Yi Province (modern Sichuan and Chongqing), unhappy that Mao sent them on long-distance campaigns initially against Huan Xuan and then against Huan Zhen, rebelled, supporting the military officer Qiao Zong as their leader. They defeated and killed Mao and captured Chengdu (成都, in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), and Qiao Zong established his independent Western Shu state there.

Also in 405, Lu Xun, who had in 404 marched south and captured Panyu (番禺, in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong) during the wars relating to Huan Xuan, offered peace to the imperial government by paying a tribute. Liu Yu, believing that he had no abilities to defeat Lu by this point, made Lu the governor of Guang Province (廣州, modern Guangdong and Guangxi) and Lu&#x27;s brother-in-law and lieutenant Xu Daofu () the governor of Shixing Principality (始興, roughly modern Shaoguan, Guangdong).

In 407, Liu Yu commissioned his friend Liu Jingxuan (劉敬宣, Liu Laozhi&#x27;s son) to launch a major attack on Qiao Zong&#x27;s Western Shu, but in 408, Liu Jingxuan&#x27;s forces became stalled against the Western Shu general Qiao Daofu () and was forced to retreat when food supplies ran out.

=== Campaigns against Southern Yan and Lu Xun ===
In 409, the Southern Yan emperor Murong Chao began a campaign of attacking and pillaging the Jin northern borders, intending to capture men and women to be trained as musicians. In response, Liu Yu decided to launch a campaign to destroy Southern Yan, over the objections of most imperial officials, but was supported by one of Liu Yu&#x27;s initial allies in starting the uprising against Huan Xuan, Meng Chang (). While Liu Yu was quickly able to defeat Southern Yan main forces in late 409 and put the Southern Yan capital Guanggu (廣固, in modern Qingzhou, Shandong) under siege, Guanggu did not fall quickly. While Liu Yu was sieging Guanggu, Xu Daofu persuaded a reluctant Lu Xun (who was afraid of a confrontation with Liu Yu) to attack north, reasoning that eventually when Liu Yu was ready, Liu Yu would attack first, and that with Liu Yu sieging Guanggu, they could capture the rest of the empire together.

In spring 410, Liu Yu, captured Guanggu, ending Southern Yan, and considered further readying a campaign against Later Qin, was informed that Lu and Xu were attacking north, and therefore quickly returned south toward Jiankang. Meanwhile, He Wuji led a fleet against Xu at Yuzhang (豫章, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), but was defeated and killed by Xu. A second force commanded by Liu Yi was also defeated by Xu and Lu. However, Liu Yi&#x27;s captured soldiers informed Lu that Liu Yu was on his way back to Jiankang, and Lu, intimidated, considered ending his campaign, but continued to Jiankang at Xu&#x27;s insistence. A number of imperial officials, including Meng, suggested that Emperor An be taken across the Yangtze River to evade Lu&#x27;s forces, but Liu Yu refused, choosing to defend Jiankang.

Once at Jiankang, Lu refused several strategies that Xu offered that were risky but offered chances of success, instead trying to intimidate Liu Yu&#x27;s forces into collapsing, which he could not do. Soon he ran out of food supplies and withdrew to Xunyang (尋陽, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi). Liu Yu gave chase, but also ordered his generals Sun Chu () and Shen Tianzi () to take a fleet by sea to attack Panyu, fully confident that he can defeat Lu and make it impossible for Lu to then retreat to his home base. Meanwhile, Xu attacked Jing Province (荊州, modern Hubei and Hunan), but was defeated by Liu Yu&#x27;s brother Liu Daogui (), and rejoined Lu, preparing for a confrontation with Liu Yu. Around the new year 411, they engaged Liu Yu at Dalei (大雷, in modern Anqing, Anhui), but Liu Yu destroyed their fleet with fire. Lu and Xu fled toward Panyu, which had however been captured by Sun at this point. Lu put Panyu under siege, but Shen, who was then trying to capture other commanderies, returned to Panyu and defeated Lu along with Sun. Lu fled toward Jiao Province (交州, modern northern Vietnam). The governor of Jiao Province, Du Huidu (), defeated Lu, and Lu killed his wife and concubines, and then committed suicide by jumping into a river.

=== Campaigns against Western Shu and Later Qin ===
With the state having been stabilized after Lu Xun&#x27;s destruction, Liu Yu again turned his attention outward, hoping to use military victories to propel himself into sufficiently high public standing that he can take the throne for himself. At the same time, however, he began to remove members of his coalition who stood or might stand in his way. In 412, believing that Liu Yi, then governor of Jing Province, was about to act against him along with Liu Yi&#x27;s cousin Liu Fan () the governor of Yan Province (兗州, then modern central Jiangsu), he arrested Liu Fan and his friend Xie Hun (), and then made a surprise attack against Liu Yi, defeating Liu Yi&#x27;s forces easily. Liu Yi was killed in flight. In 413, Liu Yu also surprised and killed his assistant, the general Zhuge Zhangmin (), whom he suspected of considering to act against him when he was away from Jiankang attacking Liu Yi.

Meanwhile, in late 412, Liu Yu commissioned the general Zhu Lingshi () to attack Qiao Zong&#x27;s Western Shu, secretly instructing him to take the long route to Qiao Zong&#x27;s capital Chengdu by Min River (), rather than the short route by Fu River (). Zhu&#x27;s forces were able to surprise Qiao Zong&#x27;s main general Qiao Daofu and Qiao Zong himself, capturing Chengdu in 413 and annexing Western Shu back into Jin.

In 414, Liu Yu began to suspect Liu Yi&#x27;s replacement as the governor of Jing Province, Sima Xiuzhi (), who was a member of the imperial clan and whose son Sima Wensi () had been created the Prince of Qiao and had gathered many adventurers around him. In spring 414, Liu Yu had Sima Wensi&#x27;s confederates arrested and executed, while delivering Sima Wensi to Sima Xiuzhi, intending for Sima Xiuzhi to show submission by executing Sima Wensi himself. Instead, Sima Xiuzhi only requested that Sima Wensi&#x27;s princely title be stripped. In spring 415, Liu Yu arrested another son of Sima Xiuzhi, Sima Wenbao (), and Sima Xiuzhi&#x27;s nephew Sima Wenzu (), ordering the two to commit suicide, and then launched an attack on Sima Xiuzhi, who was joined by Lu Zongzhi () the governor of Yong Province (雍州, then modern northwestern Hubei). Initially, Sima Xiuzhi and Lu Zongzhi enjoyed some successes, defeating Liu Yu&#x27;s son-in-law Xu Kuizhi (), but after Liu Yu himself arrived, he defeated Sima Xiuzhi&#x27;s forces, capturing Jiangling and forcing Sima Xiuzhi and Lu Zongzhi to flee to Later Qin. Liu Yu now no longer had significant opposition in Jin.

In 416, Liu Yu launched a major attack against Later Qin, in light of the recent death of the Later Qin emperor Yao Xing, entrusting the capital to his assistant Liu Muzhi (), with his teenage heir apparent Liu Yifu being nominally in charge. In winter 416, the important city Luoyang fell to Liu Yu&#x27;s general Tan Daoji (). In light of Luoyang&#x27;s fall, Liu Yu had Emperor An create him Duke of Song and bestow him the nine bestowments, showing his intentions to take the throne eventually, although he declined both honors at that point.

In spring 417, Tan Daoji and another general, Shen Linzi (), engaged in a major campaign with Later Qin&#x27;s most prominent general, Yao Shao () the Duke of Lu, the uncle of the emperor Yao Hong. After a month of battles, Yao Shao was defeated, and he died in anger. With Yao Shao dead, the other Later Qin generals could not resist Jin forces. Liu Yu&#x27;s fleet, commanded by Wang Zhen&#x27;e (王鎮惡, Wang Meng&#x27;s grandson), advanced quickly, while Yao Hong tried to first destroy Liu Yu&#x27;s flank forces, commanded by Shen Linzi&#x27;s brother Shen Tianzi. Despite Yao Hong&#x27;s large advantage in numbers, Shen Tianzi crushed him, forcing him to flee back to his capital Chang&#x27;an. Wang Zhen&#x27;e&#x27;s fleet then arrived and defeated Later Qin&#x27;s final resistance, entering Chang&#x27;an. Yao Hong surrendered, and Liu Yu had him delivered to Jiankang and executed, ending Later Qin.

=== Emperor An&#x27;s death ===
With Later Qin destroyed, there was an expectation that Liu Yu would next advance northwest and either destroy or force the subjugation of the several states in the northwest still—Xia, Western Qin, Northern Liang, and Western Liang. Indeed, at this point, Western Qin&#x27;s prince Qifu Chipan, Northern Liang&#x27;s prince Juqu Mengxun, and Western Liang&#x27;s prince Li Gao were all sufficiently intimidated that they nominally submitted to Jin&#x27;s authority. However, Liu Muzhi then died at this time, and Liu Yu, intending on taking the throne, decided to return to Jiankang himself, leaving his 11-year-old son Liu Yizhen () and the generals Wang Zhen&#x27;e, Shen Tianzi, Mao Dezu (), and the official Wang Xiu () in charge of Chang&#x27;an.

With Liu Yu having left Chang&#x27;an, Xia&#x27;s emperor Helian Bobo was intent on taking Chang&#x27;an himself. He had his sons Helian Gui () and Helian Chang, along with his general Wang Maide () make a three-pronged advance toward Chang&#x27;an while cutting off the supply route between Luoyang and Chang&#x27;an. Meanwhile, with Wang Zhen&#x27;e and Shen Tianzi being previously envious of each other, Shen Tianzi suspected Wang Zhen&#x27;e of being on the verge of rebellion, and decided to have him killed. Wang Xiu then executed Shen Tianzi, but then Liu Yizhen believed the accusations that Wang Zhen&#x27;e was in fact about to rebel and that Wang Xiu was ready to as well, and so executed Wang Xiu. Once Wang Xiu was executed, Liu Yizhen himself was without supervision, and he, in fear of Xia forces, withdrew all of his forces inside Chang&#x27;an, and Xia forces then sieged the city. Liu Yu, hearing this, sent Zhu Lingshi to replace Liu Yizhen and ordered Liu Yizhen to withdraw. Liu Yizhen&#x27;s forces, however, having pillaged Chang&#x27;an, could not withdraw quickly, and they were crushed by Xia forces at Qingni (青泥, in modern Xi&#x27;an, Shaanxi), with nearly the entire army killed or captured. Liu Yizhen barely escaped with his life, and the Chang&#x27;an region became Xia possession, although Jin retained the Luoyang region.

Liu Yu, after accepting the Duke of Song title and the nine bestowments in summer 418, had Emperor An offer to create him as the Prince of Song, but went on to publicly decline it. Meanwhile, he became convinced of the truth of a prophecy that stated, &quot;There will be two more emperors after Changming.&quot; (&quot;Changming&quot;, which meant &quot;dawn&quot;, was the courtesy name of Emperor An&#x27;s father Emperor Xiaowu.) He therefore became resolved to kill Emperor An, and he tried several times to have Emperor An&#x27;s servants poison him, but because Emperor An&#x27;s brother Sima Dewen continuously attended to him, the servants had no chance to poison him. However, around the new year 419, Sima Dewen was himself ill and had to be at his house. Liu Yu&#x27;s assassin Wang Shaozhi () then took the opportunity to kill Emperor An—according to &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, by twisting clothes into a rope and then using it to strangle Emperor An. Liu Yu then made Sima Dewen emperor (as Emperor Gong).

<text>, known in PAL regions as is a 1996 platform game in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series for the Sega Genesis and Sega Saturn. As Sonic the Hedgehog, the player embarks on a journey to save the Flickies, birds enslaved by Doctor Robotnik. The player must guide Sonic through a series of themed levels to collect Flickies and defeat Robotnik. Though it retains game mechanics from prior &quot;Sonic&quot; games, &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; is differentiated by its 2D isometric perspective, with pre-rendered 3D models converted into sprites.

The concept for &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; originated during the development of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; (1994). Most of the programming was outsourced to the British studio Traveller&#x27;s Tales, as the Japanese Sonic Team staff was preoccupied with &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; (1996). Development lasted eight months, and the team drew inspiration from &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; (1994) and &quot;Sonic Labyrinth&quot; (1995). &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; was developed alongside the Saturn game &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot;. When &quot;X-treme&quot; was canceled, Sega commissioned a port of &quot;3D Blast&quot; featuring improved graphics for the Saturn.

Both versions were published by Sega in November 1996, with a Windows port released the following year. &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; was the final &quot;Sonic&quot; game for the Genesis, and has been re-released through &quot;Sonic&quot; compilations and digital distribution platforms. The game was commercially successful and received positive reviews for the Genesis version; critics welcomed the new gameplay style as well as the graphics and music. Subsequent releases were met with more mixed reviews, with the Saturn version being seen as too similar to the Genesis version. Retrospective reviews criticized the isometric gameplay, controls, and pace, although reception to the visuals and soundtrack remained positive. An unofficial director&#x27;s cut version, featuring adjusted gameplay elements and improved controls, was released by the Genesis version&#x27;s lead programmer, Jon Burton, in 2017.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; is a platform game presented from an isometric perspective. Players control Sonic the Hedgehog, whose goal is to save the Flickies, collect the seven Chaos Emeralds, and defeat Doctor Robotnik and his robot army. Sonic retains most of his abilities from prior games: he can jump and spin in mid-air to defeat robots or hop on platforms, perform a spin-dash on the ground to gain speed, and collects rings as a form of health. Sonic can also collect power-ups, such as elemental shields, speed shoes, or invincibility, by breaking television monitors containing them.

The game is split into several levels called zones. Every zone has three acts: two standard levels, where the player must collect Flickies by defeating robots in order to proceed; and a boss fight against Robotnik, without any Flicky-collecting involved. In normal levels, once the player collects all five Flickies from each section of an act, Sonic is either further advanced into the act or taken to the next act. If Sonic and the following Flickies are hit by an obstacle or enemy, the Flickies and the rings Sonic collected will scatter. Each individual Flicky&#x27;s color determines its behavior: blue, pink and orange Flickies make an effort to find Sonic, while green and red Flickies wander off at random; the latter even jumping about, making them harder to recollect. Sonic starts the game with four lives; if he is hit with no Flickies or rings in his possession, he will lose a life. Losing all lives results in a game over. Lives can be replenished by collecting a 1-up, and continues are obtained by collecting ten Sonic-shaped medals.

As with previous games, &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; includes &quot;special stages&quot;, in which the player collects Chaos Emeralds. Obtaining all seven Emeralds allows the player to play the final boss battle and discover the true ending of the game. To access these stages, the player must find one of Sonic&#x27;s friends (either Tails or Knuckles the Echidna) hidden within a level, and stand next to them with at least 50 rings collected. Doing so allows the player to exchange the rings in order for the chance to play the game&#x27;s special stage. During special stages, the camera shifts to behind Sonic as he runs down a preset path and must collect rings while avoiding obstacles that, when run into, make him lose rings. A certain number of rings need to be obtained at certain checkpoints to continue through the stage, and ultimately be able to make it to the end in order to receive a Chaos Emerald. Collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds also allows the &quot;Final Fight&quot; level to be played, consisting of a final boss fight and the good ending of the game.

==Plot==
Doctor Robotnik discovers mysterious birds called Flickies that live on an island in an alternate dimension. He learns that they can travel anywhere using large rings, so he decides to exploit them by turning them into robots to help him search for the Chaos Emeralds. Sonic arrives at the island only to discover the presence of Robotnik, and he is tasked with saving the Flickies and defeating his nemesis.

Sonic travels through the island, saving the Flickies and clashing with Robotnik in his various machines. If the player collects all the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic proceeds into a black void, where he engages in a final battle with Robotnik, who pilots a large robot. Sonic manages to destroy the robot&#x27;s weapons and defeats Robotnik, freeing the Flickies. If the player fails to collect the Emeralds, Robotnik escapes with it in his possession.

==Development==

&quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; was the final &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; game produced for the 16-bit Sega Genesis, and was developed as a swan song for the system. Sega had discontinued support for the Genesis in 1995, but produced the game because games typically sell for one to two years after their platforms&#x27; discontinuation. The basic concept was conceived by members of Sonic Team during the development of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 3&quot; (1994), but most of the programming was done by the British studio Traveller&#x27;s Tales because Sonic Team was developing &quot;Nights into Dreams&quot; (1996) at the time. According to founder Jon Burton, Traveller&#x27;s Tales had just finished developing a &quot;Toy Story&quot; game and wanted to start developing games for 32-bit systems such as the Saturn and PlayStation. Sega, impressed with their work on &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Mickey Mania&quot;, approached them with &quot;3D Blast&quot;; as &quot;Sonic&quot; was extremely popular at the time, the concept &quot;got their attention&quot;. In retrospect, Burton stated that he believed the game was commissioned because &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot;, in development for the Saturn at the time, was struggling, and Sega wanted to bring Sonic into the 3D era of gaming.

The game was developed from scratch in eight months, beginning in July 1995. It was originally titled &quot;Sonic Spindrift&quot;. Burton, who served as lead programmer, implemented an exception handler where, should an error occur, the game would greet the player with a secret level select screen instead of crashing; this was done so the game could easily pass Sega&#x27;s approval process for publishing games. Burton also gave the game a unique full motion video intro sequence, and used compression methods to make the video fit in the 4MB cartridge and appear higher resolution. The game makes use of some pre-rendered 3D models converted into sprites. The team decided to use 3D instead of 2D because they thought &quot;it was time for something new.&quot; Inspiration for the isometric viewpoint was drawn from &quot;Sonic Labyrinth&quot; (1995) and &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; (1996). The item collection was influenced by the 1984 &quot;Flicky&quot; game, and the graphics were inspired by &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; (1994). Sonic Team provided Traveller&#x27;s Tales with game, level, and character designs. Burton remembered the partnership with Sega fondly, recalling that he greatly enjoyed &quot;making a machine do something you haven&#x27;t seen it do&quot;. Towards the end of development, Traveller&#x27;s Tales began to expand its scope, and Burton passed the rest of programming to his employees.

Sega also commissioned a version of the game for the Sega Saturn in case &quot;Sonic X-treme&quot; was canceled. This cancellation did indeed occur, so &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; was safely released in time for Christmas 1996 in its stead. The game was ported in seven weeks, during development of the Sega Genesis version. While it does feature graphical changes, such as weather effects and higher resolution textures, the game largely plays the same as the original version. It features a higher quality opening video and improved graphics. Sonic Team filled in for development of the special stage in the Saturn version of the game, which includes polygonal graphics as opposed to sprites only. This version is also compatible with the Saturn&#x27;s analog control pad. The team attempted to rework &quot;X-treme&quot; into bonus stages in the Saturn version. However, they were unable to properly transfer Sonic&#x27;s model from &quot;X-treme&quot; into &quot;3D Blast&quot;, so the feature was scrapped.

The soundtrack for the Genesis version, which features 24 tracks in total, was primarily composed by Jun Senoue and Tatsuyuki Maeda, with Masaru Setsumaru and Seirou Okamoto composing the final boss and staff roll themes respectively. The Saturn version features a different soundtrack by Richard Jacques and features a vocal ending theme titled &quot;You&#x27;re My Hero&quot;, performed by Debbie Morris. The musical styles on the soundtrack were described by &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; as both traditional &quot;Sonic&quot; music and &quot;hardcore techno&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; was released for the Genesis in North America and Europe in November 1996. The launch coincided with the release of the Game Gear game &quot;Sonic Blast&quot;, which also features pre-rendered 3D graphics. The Saturn version of &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; was released in North America later that year and in Europe in February 1997. In Japan, the Saturn version was released on October 14, 1999 as &quot;Sonic 3D: Flickies&#x27; Island&quot;. A port of the Sega Saturn version was released for Windows in Europe on September 11, 1997, and worldwide later that year.

The Genesis version of the game is available in several &quot;Sonic&quot;-themed compilations. These include &quot;Sonic Mega Collection&quot; for the GameCube; &quot;Sonic Mega Collection Plus&quot; for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Windows; and &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was also re-released for the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2007, with &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; being the Japanese title this time, and on Steam in 2010. In October 2022, it was released again as one of the games included on the Sega Genesis Mini 2.

==Reception==
===Contemporary===

Reception to the Genesis version of &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; was generally positive upon its original release. While Dan Jevons of &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; was initially skeptical of the first 3D &quot;Sonic&quot; game appearing on the Genesis, he proclaimed &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; to be &quot;a legitimate addition to the &quot;Sonic&quot; series, and a smart game in its own right&quot;. He and Angus Swan of the same publication were grateful for the change in gameplay style, which they said added depth to the structure of the series formula. They additionally praised the music, controls, and sense of inertia in Sonic&#x27;s movement. Ed Lomas of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; considered &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; to be &quot;the first essential Mega Drive game in years&quot;, and remarked that the new gameplay style would appeal to all fans of the series, as well as those who &quot;couldn&#x27;t be bothered with running right all the time&quot;. Although Art Angel of &quot;GamePro&quot; considered the levels cleverly designed, he was initially frustrated by the isometric perspective, which he felt steepened the learning curve for the controls; Dan Hsu of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; experienced a similar adjusting period. Shawn Smith and Sushi-X, also of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, admired the size of the levels, though Hsu wished for a map due to becoming sidetracked on occasion, and found the level designs too similar. Lomas and &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s Crispin Boyer observed a lack of secret locations to discover in relation to previous &quot;Sonic&quot; entries, which the former felt lowered the replay value. Jevons and Swan regarded the difficulty as somewhat low for experienced gamers, with Art Angel likewise finding the game easy to beat upon mastering the controls, whereas Lomas deemed it to be harder and longer than most other &quot;Sonic&quot; titles.

The graphics were widely praised, with Lomas finding the game&#x27;s rendered intro and fluid animation impressive for the console. Art Angel additionally noted that the sprites and animations never glitch regardless of the action&#x27;s intensity. Smith and Hsu deemed the game the pinnacle of the Genesis&#x27;s capabilities in terms of its color palette and sense of 3D. While the &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; reviewers and Lomas found the checkerboard floor patterns repetitive, Lomas deemed them necessary for judging difficult sections correctly. Art Angel approved of the eclectic music selection, which he described as ranging from techno pop to contemporary jazz, and the &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; reviewers cited the remixes for the second act of each stage as a positive point. Mike Wallis, an employee of Sega at the time, recalled in an interview that the Genesis version was successful for the company, eventually selling over 700,000 copies. Later in 2015, he stated it sold over a million copies. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; named &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; a runner-up for Genesis Game of the Year (behind &quot;Vectorman 2&quot;).

Reception to the Saturn version was mixed. Though Lee Nutter of &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; compared the gameplay unfavorably to previous &quot;Sonic&quot; games, he found it had a great deal of fun to offer and praised it as being more challenging than any previous &quot;Sonic&quot; game. &quot;GameSpot&quot;&#x27;s Jeff Gerstmann appreciated this version&#x27;s superior handling of certain animations. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, however, noted the game&#x27;s unusually similar presentation on two platforms with differing expectations, claiming that &quot;while &quot;3D Blast&quot; is super by 16-bit standards, it falls flat on Sega Saturn, where 32-bit games with far more sophisticated 3-D graphics and gameplay are the norm.&quot; Smith and Hsu of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; agreed that the Saturn version is overly similar to the Genesis version, though Hsu added, &quot;that&#x27;s a compliment to the Genesis, not a rip on the Saturn&quot;. Hsu and Boyer both also said that the game&#x27;s controls are considerably improved with the Saturn&#x27;s analog controller, though Sushi-X found it of little help. The Saturn version was also a commercial success and was one of the system&#x27;s better-selling games, according to Wallis.

The staff of &quot;GameSpot&quot; saw the PC version as similar to the others, but pointed out some slowdown effects while the camera scrolled, attributing these to its wide colour palette.

===Retrospective===

Critical opinions of the game have lessened over time. Reviewers generally disapproved of &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot;″s gameplay style, some finding its isometric perspective limiting. Lucas M. Thomas of &quot;IGN&quot; lamented that &quot;the sense of speed and intense action that Sonic&#x27;s name was built on is absent here, replaced by, essentially, a looping, lazy fetchquest&quot;. Austin Shau of &quot;GameSpot&quot; echoed this concern, calling the gameplay &quot;an exercise in tedium&quot;. Besides the game&#x27;s goals, Shau and Thomas criticized the controls, particularly in the area of Sonic&#x27;s overly slow-paced movement and slippery deceleration. Thomas did admit that the game &quot;has its moments&quot; of quick-footed vigor, but characterized these as few and far between, and Shau summarized that, while not unsalvageable in isolation, the game&#x27;s elements violently clashed and customers would be &quot;spending 800 Wii points for a vat of oil and water&quot;. Damien McFerran of &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; stated that its repetition was broken only by its boss battles and special stages, the latter of which Shau wrote off as &quot;childishly easy&quot;. However, reflecting on its complaints years earlier upon the game&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Sonic Mega Collection Plus&quot;, Jeremy Parish of &quot;1UP.com&quot; called the game &quot;much better than you might be led to believe&quot;. Brett Alan Weiss of &quot;AllGame&quot; voiced a similar opinion, feeling it was a &quot;nice departure&quot; from the style of the side-scrolling &quot;Sonic&quot; games.

Reviewers remained positive about the game&#x27;s presentation. McFerran greatly enjoyed the game&#x27;s visuals and welcomed the graphical improvements of the Saturn version: &quot;the CGI visuals are stunning considering the hardware, the animation is excellent and the level design is colourful and varied&quot;. Thomas praised the game&#x27;s &quot;valiant&quot; pre-rendered graphics, especially taking its limited hardware into account. Shau stated that the graphics and sound were the only areas in which the game bore a welcome resemblance to its Genesis predecessors, and particularly appreciated the return of the ring-scattering sound effect and similar music. Z-Roc of &quot;Game Revolution&quot; praised the rounded, cartoon-like graphics, referring to them as &quot;some of the sharpest graphics we have ever seen.&quot; Weiss wrote that the visuals, though not an improvement from other games artistically, were well-produced and high-quality. Thomas gave the music a subscore of 7.5/10, the highest of any element of the game, and noted that its themes would be memorable to players.

Some journalists have called &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; one of the worst games in the &quot;Sonic&quot; franchise. &quot;USgamer&quot; and &quot;Complex&quot; wrote that the game did not feel like a true &quot;Sonic&quot; game, the latter stating that it was &quot;offensive&quot; to call it 3D. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; described it as &quot;the first sign that &quot;Sonic&quot; in 3D was just plain not going to work&quot;. The game is remembered as a black sheep in the franchise.

==Legacy==
Archie Comics published a comic book adaptation of &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; for a 48-page special in December 1996, written by Mike Gallagher. A loose adaptation of the game also appeared in issues 104 through 106 (May through July 1997) of &quot;Sonic the Comic&quot;.

Senoue re-arranged two of his musical pieces from the Genesis version for &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; (1998), saying he wanted the Japanese market to hear them as the Genesis version was not released in Japan. He also used a cut theme as the boss theme in &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I&quot;.

After &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot;, Traveller&#x27;s Tales and Sonic Team collaborated again on the Saturn racing game &quot;Sonic R&quot; (1997). &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot; was one of Traveller&#x27;s Tales earliest games; the studio later became known for their work on video games based on the Lego toy line, through which it would revisit the &quot;Sonic&quot; franchise as part of the 2015 crossover game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;. In 2017, Burton released an unofficial director&#x27;s cut patch for the Mega Drive version of &quot;Sonic 3D Blast&quot;, with improved controls and additions such as a level editor, a password save system, time attack challenges, and the ability to transform into Super Sonic.

<doc id="440549" wikidata="Q630189" url="?curid=440549" title="Oath of Supremacy">
<text>The Oath of Supremacy required any person taking public or church office in the Kingdom of England, or in its subordinate Kingdom of Ireland, to swear allegiance to the monarch as Supreme Governor of the Church. Failure to do so was to be treated as treasonable. The Oath of Supremacy was originally imposed by King Henry VIII of England through the Act of Supremacy 1534, but repealed by his elder daughter, Queen Mary I of England, and reinstated under Henry&#x27;s other daughter and Mary&#x27;s half-sister, Queen Elizabeth I of England, under the Act of Supremacy 1558. The Oath was later extended to include Members of Parliament (MPs) and people studying at universities. In 1537, the Irish Supremacy Act was passed by the Parliament of Ireland, establishing Henry VIII as the supreme head of the Church of Ireland. As in England, a commensurate Oath of Supremacy was required for admission to offices.

In 1801, retained by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the oath continued to bar Catholics from Parliament until substantially amended by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. The requirement to take the oath for Oxford University students was not removed until the Oxford University Act 1854.

The oath was finally repealed in 1969 by Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1969.

==Text ==
As published in 1535, the oath read – repealed in 1559 by Act of Supremacy 1558:

In 1559, it was published as follows – repealed in 1969 by Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1969:

==Punishment==
Roman Catholics who refused to take the Oath of Supremacy were indicted for treason on charges of &quot;praemunire&quot;. For example, Sir Thomas More opposed the King&#x27;s separation from the Roman Catholic Church in the English Reformation and refused to accept him as Supreme Head of the Church of England, a title which had been given by parliament through the Act of Supremacy of 1534. He was imprisoned in 1534 for his refusal to take the oath, because the act discredited papal authority, and his refusal to accept the annulment of Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon. In 1535, he was tried for treason, convicted on perjured testimony, and beheaded.

==Exceptions and retention==
Under the reigns of Charles II and James II, the Oath of Supremacy was not so widely employed by the Crown. This was largely due to the Catholic sympathies and practices of these monarchs, and the resulting high number of Roman Catholics serving in official positions. Examples of officials who never had to take the Oath include the Catholic Privy Counsellors, Sir Stephen Rice and Justin McCarthy, Viscount Mountcashel. The centrality of the Oath was re-established under the reign of William III and Mary II, following the Glorious Revolution, and in Ireland following the Williamite reconquest. The Oath was retained in the Acts of Union 1800 that transferred Irish representation, still wholly Protestant, from the Irish Parliament in Dublin to the Westminster parliament, reconstituted as the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

==Abolition for MPs==
In 1828, the Irish Catholic leader Daniel O&#x27;Connell defeated William Vesey-FitzGerald in a parliamentary by-election in County Clare. His triumph, as the first Catholic to be returned in a parliamentary election since 1688, made a clear issue of the oath, as it required that MPs acknowledge the King as &quot;Supreme Governor&quot; of the Church and thus forswear the Roman communion. Fearful of the widespread disturbances that might follow from continuing to insist on the letter of the oath, the government finally relented. With the Prime Minister, the Duke of Wellington, persuading the King, George IV, and the Home Secretary, Sir Robert Peel, engaging the Whig opposition, the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 became law.

<doc id="440559" wikidata="Q1626313" url="?curid=440559" title="Homosexuality in Japan">
<text>Records of men who have sex with men in Japan date back to ancient times. Western scholars have identified these as evidence of homosexuality in Japan. Though these relations had existed in Japan for millennia, they became most apparent to scholars during the Tokugawa (or Edo) period. Historical practices identified by scholars as homosexual include , and .

The Japanese term is the Japanese reading of the same characters in Chinese, which literally mean &quot;male colors&quot;. The character () has the added meaning of &quot;lust&quot; in both China and Japan. This term was widely used to refer to some kind of male-to-male sex in a pre-modern era of Japan. The term is also used, especially in older works.

During the Meiji period &quot;nanshoku&quot; started to become discouraged due to the rise of sexology within Japan and the process of westernization. However, during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II the Chinese mocked and insulted Puyi and the Japanese as homosexuals and presented it as proof of their perversion and being uncivilized. The only time homosexual sodomy has been banned in Japan was for short time for 8 years in 1872-1880 due to western influence.

Modern terms for homosexuals include , , , or , , / and .

== Pre-Meiji Japan ==

Historically, the Shinto religion &quot;had no special code of morals and seems to have regarded sex as a natural phenomenon to be enjoyed with few inhibitions.&quot; While Shinto beliefs are diverse, Japanese Shintoism does not condemn homosexuality. A variety of obscure literary references to same-sex love exist in ancient sources, such as Japanese mythology, but many of these are so subtle as to be unreliable; another consideration is that declarations of affection for friends of the same sex were common. Due to the Chinese influence of Confucianism and Buddhism, homosexuality was socially discouraged.

Nevertheless, references do exist, and they become more numerous in the Heian period, roughly in the 11th century. For example, in &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, written in the early 11th century, men are frequently moved by the beauty of youths. In one scene the hero rejects a lady and instead sleeps with her young brother: &quot;Genji pulled the boy down beside him ... Genji, for his part, or so one is informed, found the boy more attractive than his chilly sister&quot;. &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; is a novel, but there are several Heian-era diaries that contain references to homosexual acts and practices. Some of these contain references to Emperors involved in homosexual relationships with &quot;handsome boys retained for sexual purposes&quot;.

=== Monastic homosexuality ===

&quot;Nanshoku&quot; relationships inside Buddhist monasteries were typically pederastic: an age-structured relationship where the younger partner is not considered an adult. The older partner, or , would be a monk, priest or abbot, while the younger partner was assumed to be an , who would be a prepubescent or adolescent boy; the relationship would be dissolved once the boy reached adulthood (or left the monastery). Both parties were encouraged to treat the relationship seriously and conduct the affair honorably, and the &quot;nenja&quot; might be required to write a formal vow of fidelity. Outside of the monasteries, monks were considered to have a particular predilection for male prostitutes, which was the subject of much ribald humor.

There is no evidence so far of religious opposition to homosexuality within Japan in non-Buddhist traditions. Tokugawa commentators felt free to illustrate kami engaging in anal sex with each other. During the Tokugawa period, some of the Shinto gods, especially Hachiman, Myoshin, Shinmei and Tenjin, &quot;came to be seen as guardian deities of &quot;nanshoku&quot;&quot; (male–male love). Tokugawa-era writer Ihara Saikaku joked that since there are no women for the first three generations in the genealogy of the gods found in the Nihon Shoki, the gods must have enjoyed homosexual relationships—which Saikaku argued was the real origin of &quot;nanshoku&quot;. Nonetheless, during the Edo period, male-female relationships were highly valued as it ensured propagation of offspring and social status.

=== Samurai &quot;shudō&quot; ===
In contrast to the norms in religious circles, in the warrior (samurai) class it was customary for a boy in the &quot;wakashū&quot; age category to undergo training in the martial arts by apprenticing to a more experienced adult man. According to Furukawa, the relationship was based on the model of a typically older &quot;nenja,&quot; paired with a typically younger &quot;chigo&quot;. The man was permitted, if the boy agreed, to take the boy as his lover until he came of age; this relationship, often formalized in a &quot;brotherhood contract&quot;, was expected to be exclusive, with both partners swearing to take no other (male) lovers.

This practice, along with clerical pederasty, developed into the codified system of age-structured homosexuality known as &quot;shudō&quot;, abbreviated from &quot;wakashūdō&quot;, the &quot;way (&quot;Tao&quot;) of &quot;wakashū&quot;&quot;. The older partner, in the role of &quot;nenja&quot;, would teach the &quot;chigo&quot; martial skills, warrior etiquette, and the samurai code of honor, while his desire to be a good role model for his &quot;chigo&quot; would lead him to behave more honorably himself; thus a &quot;shudō&quot; relationship was considered to have a &quot;mutually ennobling effect&quot;. In addition, both parties were expected to be loyal unto death, and to assist the other both in feudal duties and in honor-driven obligations such as duels and vendettas. Although sex between the couple was expected to end when the boy came of age, the relationship would, ideally, develop into a lifelong bond of friendship. At the same time, sexual activity with women was not barred (for either party), and once the boy came of age, both were free to seek other &quot;wakashū&quot; lovers.

Like later Edo same-sex practices, samurai &quot;shudō&quot; was strictly role-defined; the &quot;nenja&quot; was seen as the active, desiring, penetrative partner, while the younger, sexually receptive &quot;wakashū&quot; was considered to submit to the &quot;nenja&quot;&#x27;s attentions out of love, loyalty, and affection, rather than sexual desire&quot;d&quot;] Among the samurai class, adult men were (by definition) not permitted to take the &quot;wakashū&quot; role; only preadult boys (or, later, lower-class men) were considered legitimate targets of homosexual desire. In some cases, &quot;shudō&quot; relationships arose between boys of similar ages, but the parties were still divided into &quot;nenja&quot; and &quot;wakashū&quot; roles.

=== Kabuki and male prostitution ===
Male prostitutes (&quot;kagema&quot;), who were often passed off as apprentice kabuki actors and catered to a mixed male and female clientele, did a healthy trade into the mid-19th century despite increasing restrictions. Many such prostitutes, as well as many young kabuki actors, were indentured servants sold as children to the brothel or theatre, typically on a ten-year contract. Sexual relations between merchants and boys hired as shop staff or housekeepers were common enough, at least in the popular imagination, to be the subject of erotic stories and popular jokes. Young kabuki actors often worked as prostitutes off-stage, and were celebrated in much the same way as modern celebrities are, being much sought after by wealthy patrons, who would vie with each other to purchase the Kabuki actors&#x27; favors. &quot;Onnagata&quot; (female-role) and &quot;wakashū-gata&quot; (adolescent boy-role) actors in particular were the subject of much appreciation by both male and female patrons, and figured largely in &quot;nanshoku&quot; shunga prints and other works celebrating &quot;nanshoku&quot;, which occasionally attained best-seller status.

Male prostitutes and actor-prostitutes serving male clientele were originally restricted to the &quot;wakashū&quot; age category, as adult men were not perceived as desirable or socially acceptable sexual partners for other men. During the 17th century, these men (or their employers) sought to maintain their desirability by deferring or concealing their coming-of-age and thus extending their &quot;non-adult&quot; status into their twenties or even thirties; this eventually led to an alternate, status-defined &quot;shudō&quot; relationship which allowed clients to hire &quot;boys&quot; who were, in reality, older than themselves. This evolution was hastened by mid-17th-century bans on the depiction of the &quot;wakashū&quot;&#x27;s long forelocks, their most salient age marker, in kabuki plays; intended to efface the sexual appeal of the young actors and thus reduce violent competition for their favors, this restriction eventually had the unintended effect of decoupling male sexual desirability from actual age, so long as a suitably &quot;youthful&quot; appearance could be maintained.

===Art of same-sex love===
These activities were the subject of countless literary works, most of which have yet to be translated. However, English translations are available for Ihara Saikaku who created a bisexual main character in &quot;The Life of An Amorous Man&quot; (1682), Jippensha Ikku who created an initial male-male relationship in the post-publication &quot;Preface&quot; to &quot;Shank&#x27;s Mare&quot; (1802 et seq), and Ueda Akinari who had a homosexual Buddhist monk in &quot;Tales of Moonlight and Rain&quot; (1776). Likewise, many of the greatest artists of the period, such as Hokusai and Hiroshige, prided themselves in documenting such loves in their prints, known as ukiyo-e &quot;pictures of the floating world&quot;, and where they had an erotic tone, shunga &quot;pictures of spring&quot;.

&quot;Nanshoku&quot; was not considered incompatible with heterosexuality; books of erotic prints dedicated to &quot;nanshoku&quot; often presented erotic images of both young women (concubines, &quot;mekake&quot;, or prostitutes, &quot;jōrō&quot;) as well as attractive adolescent boys (&quot;wakashū&quot;) and cross-dressing youths (&quot;onnagata&quot;). Indeed, several works suggest that the most &quot;enviable&quot; situation would be to have both many &quot;jōrō&quot; and many &quot;wakashū&quot;. Likewise, women were considered to be particularly attracted to both &quot;wakashū&quot; and &quot;onnagata&quot;, and it was assumed that many of these young men would reciprocate that interest. Therefore, both many practitioners of &quot;nanshoku&quot; and the young men they desired would be considered bisexual in modern terminology. Men and male youths (there are examples of both) who were purely homosexual might be called &quot;woman-haters&quot; (&quot;onna-girai&quot;); this term, however, carried the connotation of aggressive distaste of women in all social contexts, rather than simply a preference for male sexual partners. Not all exclusively homosexual men were referred to with this terminology.

=== Exclusive homosexuality and personal sexual identity ===

&quot;The Great Mirror of Male Love&quot; (男色大鏡) by Ihara Saikaku was the definitive work on the subject of &quot;male love&quot; in Tokugawa Era Japan. 
In his introduction to &quot;The Great Mirror of Male Love&quot;, Paul Gordon Schalow writes, &quot;In the opening chapter of Nanshoku Okagami, Saikaku employed the title in its literal sense when he stated &#x27;I have attempted to reflect in this great mirror all of the varied manifestations of male love. It was intended to be a societal reflection of all the different ways men in Tokugawa society loved other men.

The most common narrative of male to male sex and/or love was what we would now consider a &quot;bisexual&quot; experience: the &quot;connoisseur of boys&quot; or &quot;shojin-zuki&quot;. This term was applied not simply to men who engaged in &quot;bisexual&quot; behavior, but most often to men who engaged sexually and/or romantically with boys &quot;often&quot;, but not exclusively. 

In &quot;History of homosexuality in Japan&quot; by Vanja Zenzerovic, he writes:Male homosexuality in Japan has a long tradition that goes back to the eighth century, even if, until very recently, the notion of the homosexual intended as a person with different erotic preferences wasn’t present in Japanese culture. To the point that there wasn’t a specific term for homosexuals besides “wakashū” and “okama” and consequently the majority of the homosexual slang was imported from English terminology such as ‘gei’ or ‘homo’.

There were &quot;wakashū&quot; who would now be considered &quot;homosexual&quot;, &quot;wakashū&quot; who would now be considered &quot;bisexual&quot;, and &quot;wakashū&quot; who would now be considered &quot;heterosexual&quot;, as well as many who could not be easily sorted into these categories.

References to &quot;wakashū&quot; exclusively interested in men were relatively common, as in the example of the popular actor described in the story &quot;Winecup Overflowing&quot;, who was sent many love letters from women, but who, &quot;ignored them completely, not out of cold heartedness, but because he was devoted to the way of male love.&quot;

&quot;Wakashū&quot; who felt this way could simply transition to being the &quot;man&quot; partner to a &quot;boy&quot;, or, in some circumstances (of varying social acceptability), continue his life in the sociosexual role of &quot;boy&quot;.

There is also much evidence of young men who engaged in this behavior out of duty, rather than love, or lust. Like in, &quot;The Boy Who Sacrificed His Life&quot;, where Saikaku writes, &quot;it seems that Yata Nisaburo of whom you spoke to me in private is not a believer in boy love. He was not interested in the idea of having a male lover and so, though only seventeen and in the flower of youth, has foolishly cut off his forelocks. I found his profuse apologies rather absurd but have decided to let the matter drop. Last night everyone came over and we spent the whole night laughing about it...&quot;

Another Tokugawa author, Eijima Kiseki, who references exclusive homosexuality, writes of a character in his 1715 The &quot;Characters of Worldly Young Men&quot;, &quot;who had never cared for women: all his life he remained unmarried, in the grip of intense passions for one handsome boy after another.&quot;

There is a genre of stories dedicated to debating the value of &quot;male colors&quot;, &quot;female colors&quot;, or the &quot;following of both paths&quot;. &quot;Colors&quot; here indicating a specific way of sexual desire, with the desire coming from the adult male participant, to the receiving woman or &quot;youth&quot;. Depending on what audience the story was written for, the answer to the preferred way of life might be that the best way is to be exclusive to women, moderately invested in both women and boys, or exclusive to boys. Although these &quot;ways of loving&quot; were not considered incompatible, there were people and groups who advocated the exclusive following of one way, considered them spiritually at odds, or simply only personally experienced attractions in line with one of these &quot;ways&quot;.

=== Social role play in man and boy roles ===

Traditional expressions of male to male sexual and romantic activity were between a man who had gone through with his coming of age ceremony, and a male youth who had not.

In his introduction to &quot;The Great Mirror of Male Love&quot;, Schallow writes, &quot;a careful reading of nanshoku okagami makes clear that the constraint requiring that male homosexual relations be between an adult male and a &quot;wakashū&quot; was sometimes observed only in the form of fictive roleplaying. This meant that relations between pairs of man-boy lovers were accepted as legitimate whether or not a real man and a real boy were involved, so long as one partner took the role of &#x27;man&#x27; and the other the role of &#x27;boy.
In &quot;Two Old Cherry Trees Still in Bloom&quot;, the protagonists are two men who have been in love since they were youths. The &quot;man&quot; in this relationship is 66, and the &quot;boy&quot; in this relationship is 63.

In the realm of male kabuki (as opposed to &quot;boy&quot; kabuki), Saikaku writes,now, since everyone wore the hairstyle of adult men, it was still possible at age 34 or 35 for youthful-looking actors to get under a man&#x27;s robe...If skill is what the audience is looking for, there should be no problem in having a 70 year old perform as a youth in long sleeved robes. So long as he can continue to find patrons willing to spend the night with him, he can then enter the new year without pawning his belongings.The protagonist of Saikaku&#x27;s &quot;An Amorous Man&quot; hires the services of a &quot;boy&quot; who turns out to be ten years his senior, and finds himself disappointed.

In the &quot;Ugetsu Monogatari&quot;, written by Ueda Akinari (1734–1809), the story &quot;Kikuka no chigiri&quot; is commonly believed to be about a romantic relationship between two adult men, where neither obviously holds the sociosexual role of &quot;wakashū&quot;, though they do structure it with their age difference in mind, using the &quot;male love&quot; terminology &quot;older brother&quot; versus &quot;younger brother&quot;. In the story of Haemon and Takashima, two adult men, they also use this terminology, and Takashima additionally presents himself as a &quot;wakashū&quot;.

Mentions of men who openly enjoy both being the penetrating and penetrated partner are not found in these works, but are found in earlier Heian personal diaries, like in the diary of Fujiwara no Yorinaga, who writes on wanting to perform both the penetrative, and the receptive, sexual role. This is also referenced in a Muromachi era poem by the Shingon priest Socho (1448–1532). This may indicate that the mores surrounding appropriate homosexual conduct for men had changed rapidly in the course of one-to-two centuries.

== Meiji Japan ==
As Japan progressed into the Meiji era, same-sex practices continued, taking on new forms. However, there was a growing animosity towards same-sex practices. Despite the animosity, &quot;nanshoku&quot; continued, specifically the samurai version of &quot;nanshoku&quot;, and it became the dominant expression of homosexuality during the Meiji period.

&quot;Nanshoku&quot; practices became associated with the Satsuma region of Japan, the reason being that this area was deeply steeped in the &quot;nanshoku&quot; samurai tradition of the Tokugawa period. Also, when the Satsuma oligarchs supported the restoration of power to the emperor, they were put into positions of power, allowing &quot;nanshoku&quot; practices to be brought more into the spotlight during this time period. Satsuma also made up the majority of the newly created Japanese navy, thus associating the navy with &quot;nanshoku&quot; practices. Though during this time Japan briefly adopted anti-sodomy laws in an attempt to modernize its code (more on this below), the laws were repealed when French legalist Gustave Boissonade advised adopting a similar legal code to France&#x27;s. Moreover, &quot;nanshoku&quot; flourished during the time of the Sino- and Russo-Japanese wars, due to the association of the warrior code of the samurai with nationalism. This led to close associations between the &quot;Bushidō&quot; samurai code, nationalism, and homosexuality. After the Russo-Japanese War, however, the practice of &quot;nanshoku&quot; began to die down and receive pushback.

=== Rejection of homosexuality ===
Eventually Japan began to shift away from its tolerance of homosexuality, moving towards a more hostile stance toward &quot;nanshoku&quot; and homosexual practices more generally. For instance, the Ministry of Justice passed a sodomy law in 1873 criminalizing homosexual practices, termed the code. This code had the effect of criticizing an act of homosexuality without actually criticizing &quot;nanshoku&quot; culture itself, which at the time was associated with the samurai code and masculinity. The &quot;keikan&quot; code came to be more apparent with the rise of groups of delinquent students that would engage in so called battles. These groups would go around assaulting other students and incorporate them into their group, often engaging in homosexual activity. Newspapers became highly critical of these &quot;bishōnen&quot;-hunting gangs, resulting in an anti-sodomy campaign throughout the country.

Sexology, a growing field in Japan at the time, was also highly critical of homosexuality. Originating from Western thought, sexology was transferred to Japan by way of Meiji scholars, who were seeking to create a more Western Japan. Sexologists claimed that males engaging in a homosexual relationship would adopt feminine characteristics and would assume the psychic persona of a woman. They also claimed that homosexuality would degenerate into androgyny, in that the very body would come to resemble that of a woman with regard to such features such as voice timbre, growth of body hair, texture of hair and skin, muscular and skeletal structure, distribution of fatty tissues, body odor and mammary development.

The only time homosexual sodomy (anal sex) has been banned in Japan was for eight years in 1872–1880 due to western influence.

Ming dynasty China banned homosexual sodomy (anal sex) in the Ming Code since the Jiajing emperor&#x27;s reign and continued into the Qing dynasty until 1907, when western influence led to the law being repealed. The Chinese mocked and insulted Puyi and the Japanese as homosexuals and presented it as proof of their perversion and being uncivilized. During World War II, straight Japanese soldiers were documented to forcing gay people into sexual slavery in lands occupied by Japan, and forcibly turning some gay natives into &quot;comfort women&quot; and prisoners.

==Homosexuality in modern Japan==

Despite the recent trends that suggest a new level of tolerance, as well as open scenes in more cosmopolitan cities (such as Tokyo and Osaka), Japanese gay men and lesbian women often conceal their sexuality, with many even marrying persons of the opposite sex.

===Politics and law===

Japan has no laws against homosexual activity and has some legal protections for gay individuals. While civil rights laws do not extend to protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation, some governments have enacted such laws. The government of Tokyo has passed laws that ban discrimination in employment based on sexual identity.

Japan&#x27;s society and government are predominantly conservative. Most political parties in Japan have formal positions in favor or against LGBT rights in their party&#x27;s platform or manifesto. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has indicated opposition to legalizing same-sex marriage, whereas the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), the Japanese Communist Party (JCP), the Japan Innovation Party, and the Social Democratic Party have indicated support for legalization. In a 2023 survey, Pew Research Center estimated that nearly 70% of Japanese people support same-sex marriage, the highest percentage of acceptance out of the Asian countries surveyed.

Some political figures are beginning to speak publicly about they themselves being gay. Kanako Otsuji, an assemblywoman from Osaka, came out as a lesbian in 2005. She became the first elected member of the House of Councillors and of the Diet in 2013 and 2015 respectively to do so. Taiga Ishikawa was elected in 2019, becoming the first openly gay man to sit in the Diet. He was out also during his time previously as a ward councillor for Nakano.

The current Constitution of Japan, which was written during American occupation, defines marriage as exclusively between a man and a woman. In an unconventional effort to circumvent marriage restrictions, some gay couples have resorted to using the adult adoption system, which is known as futsu, as an alternate means of becoming a family. In this method, the older partner adopts the younger partner which allows for them to be officially recognized as a family and receive some of the benefits that ordinary families receive such as common surnames and inheritance. In regards to the workplace, there are no anti-discrimination protections for LGBT employees. Employers play a visible role in reinforcing the Confucian tenets of marriage and procreation. Male employees are considered ineligible for promotions unless they marry and procreate.

While same-sex marriage is not legalized at the national level, the Shibuya District in Tokyo passed a same-sex partnership certificate bill in 2015 to &quot;issue certificates to same-sex couples that recognize them as partners equivalent to those married under the law.&quot; Similar partnerships are available in Setagaya District (Tokyo), Sapporo (Hokkaido), Takarazuka (Hyogo), and over 20 other localities, as well as one prefecture (Ibaraki).

===Popular culture===

====Mass media====
A number of artists, nearly all male, have begun to speak publicly about being gay, appearing on various talk shows and other programs, their celebrity often focused on their sexuality; twin pop-culture critics Piko and Osugi are an example. Akihiro Miwa, a drag queen and former lover of author Yukio Mishima, is the television advertisement spokesperson for many Japanese companies ranging from beauty to financial products. 

Some entertainers have used stereotypical references to homosexuality to increase their profile. Masaki Sumitani a.k.a. Hard Gay (HG), a comedian, shot to fame after he began to appear in public wearing a leather harness, hot pants, and cap. His outfit, name, and trademark pelvis thrusting and squeals earned him the adoration of fans and the scorn of many in the Japanese gay community.

After 2010 the situation for people belonging to the LGBT community changed in many ways. They began to be viewed as a market for mainstream Japanese businesses and businesses started to promote LGBT rights protection in their self-marketing. Since then many companies developed environments that protect LGBT rights to attract diverse new employees and increase their brand value in the global market.

, Hiromi, a fashion model, came out publicly as a lesbian.

A greater number of gay characters have also begun appearing (with positive portrayals) on Japanese television, such as the highly successful &quot;Hanazakari no Kimitachi e&quot; and &quot;Last Friends&quot; television series. Boys&#x27; Love drama &quot;Ossan&#x27;s Love&quot; aired first in 2016 as a standalone TV movie and was expanded to a TV series in 2018. The programme was so successful that a movie sequel was released the following year entitled &quot;Ossan&#x27;s Love: LOVE or DEAD&quot;. In 2019 male same-sex relationships became further visible with the popular adapted drama &quot;What Did You Eat Yesterday?&quot;. &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; also brought homosexuals into the forefront with characters &quot;Haruka Ten&#x27;oh&quot; and &quot;Michiru Kaiou&quot;, two female senshi in a committed same sex relationship.

 is a Japanese reality dating show on Netflix. It is the nation&#x27;s first same-sex dating program. It premiered on July 9, 2024.

====Media====
The subscription-based gay magazine &quot;&quot; was published from 1952 to 1962.

In 1975 twelve women became the first group of women in Japan to publicly identify as lesbians, publishing one issue of a magazine called Subarashi Onna (Wonderful Women).

In the early 1990s many forms of media started to show interest in gay culture and especially the experiences gay men. They focused on gay men in relationships with heterosexual women. Examples of media being produced in this time are the movies: &quot;Okoge&quot; (Fag Hag, 1992), &quot;Kira kira hikaru&quot; (Twinkle, 1992), the drama series &quot;Dōsokai&quot; (Class Reunion, 1993), and the movie adaptation of Matsu’ura Rieko’s 1987 lesbian-themed novel &quot;Nachuraru ūman&quot; (Natural Women,1994). Moreover, new gay magazines established themselves such as &quot;Badī&quot; (Buddy, 1993–2019) and G-men (1995–2016) and forged new ways in which the gay community could represent and build a community. Additionally, new magazines about lesbian experiences were published that challenged heteronormativity unlike former publications that often sexualised and pathologised lesbian experiences. In 1987 the first commercial publication by and for lesbian women &quot;Onna o aisuru onnatachi no monogatari&quot; (Stories of Women Who Love Women) was published.

One of famous Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda&#x27;s earliest movies, a documentary called &quot;August without Him&quot;, released in 1994, follows Hirata Yutaka, the first openly gay AIDS sufferer in Japan. Filmed over a series of months, it contrasts his public life as an outspoken figure on the lecture circuit with his personal descent into illness and death.

With the rise in visibility of the gay community and the attendant rise of media for gay audiences, the Hadaka Matsuri (&quot;Naked Festival&quot;) has become a fantasy scenario for gay videos.

Gei-comi (&quot;gay-comics&quot;) are gay-romance themed comics aimed at gay men. While yaoi comics often assign one partner as a &quot;uke&quot;, or feminized receiver, gei-comi generally depict both partners as masculine and in an equal relationship. Another common term for this genre is &quot;bara&quot;, stemming from the name of the first publication of this genre to gain popularity in Japan, &quot;Barazoku&quot;. Yaoi works are massive in number with much of the media created by women usually for female audiences. In the west, it has quickly caught on as one of the most sought-after forms of pornography. There is certainly no disparity between yaoi as a pornographic theme, vs Yuri.

Lesbian-romance themed anime and manga is known as &quot;yuri&quot; (which means &quot;lily&quot;). It is used to describe female-female relationships in material and is typically marketed towards straight people, homosexuals in general, or lesbians despite significant stylistic and thematic differences between works aimed at the different audiences. Another word that has become popular in Japan as an equivalent term to Yuri is &quot;GL&quot; (short for &quot;Girls&#x27; Love&quot; in opposite to &quot;Boys&#x27; Love&quot;). There are a variety of yuri titles (or titles that integrate yuri content) aimed at women, such as &quot;Revolutionary Girl Utena&quot;, &quot;Oniisama e...&quot;, &quot;Maria-sama ga Miteru&quot;, some aspects of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; (most notably Haruka and Michiru), &quot;Strawberry Shake Sweet&quot;, &quot;Love My Life&quot;, etc.; and there are a variety of yuri titles of anime such as &quot;Kannazuki no Miko&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Panic!,&quot; &quot;Simoun&quot;, and &quot;My-Hime&quot;. &quot;Comic Yuri Hime&quot; is a long-time running manga magazine in Japan that focuses solely on yuri stories, which gained merges from its other subsidiary comics and currently runs as the only Yuri Hime named magazine. Other magazines and anthologies of Yuri that have emerged throughout the early 21st century are &quot;Mebae&quot;, &quot;Hirari&quot;, and &quot;Tsubomi&quot; (the latter two ceased publication before 2014).

===2021 court ruling===
In March 2021, the Sapporo District Court of Japan declared and announced that the 1984 law banning same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. However, in June 2022, the Osaka District Court released a ruling which upheld the ban as unconstitutional.

<doc id="440570" wikidata="Q1244579" url="?curid=440570" title="William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford">
<text>William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford, Lord of Breteuil ( 1011 – 22 February 1071), was a relative and close counsellor of William the Conqueror and one of the great magnates of early Norman England. FitzOsbern was created Earl of Hereford in 1067, one of the first peerage titles in the English peerage. He is one of the very few proven companions of William the Conqueror known to have fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. His chief residence was Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight, one of many castles he built in England.

==Origins==
William FitzOsbern was the son of Osbern the Steward, a nephew of Duchess Gunnor, the wife of Duke Richard I of Normandy. Osbern was the steward of his cousin Duke Robert I of Normandy. When Robert left the Duchy to his young son William, Osbern became one of Duke William&#x27;s guardians. Osbern married Emma, a daughter of Count Rodulf of Ivry, who was a half-brother of Duke Richard I of Normandy. Through her he inherited a large property in central Normandy, including the honours of Pacy and Breteuil.

==Career pre-1066==

William FitzOsbern was probably raised at the court of his cousin William, Duke of Normandy, and like his father, became one of the ducal stewards. He married Adeliza de Tosny, probably in about 1030. Together they founded Lyre Abbey (La Vieille-Lyre) and later Cormeilles Abbey. FitzOsbern also founded Saint-Evroul Abbey.

He was one of the earliest and most vigorous advocates of the invasion of England, and tradition holds that, at the Council of Lillebonne, he convinced the doubters amongst the Norman barons of the feasibility of the invasion. FitzOsbern&#x27;s younger brother Osbern FitzOsbern was one of Edward the Confessor&#x27;s chaplains, and possessed the rich church of Bosham in Sussex, where King Harold went to in the first scene of the Bayeux tapestry, and was well placed to pass along intelligence on the situation in England. He later became Bishop of Exeter.

==In England after 1066==
After William became King of England, FitzOsbern was made an earl, with major land holdings in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Oxfordshire, and the Isle of Wight, and smaller areas under his authority in Berkshire, Dorset, Wiltshire, and Worcestershire. In the summer of 1067 King William returned to Normandy and left his half-brother Bishop Odo of Bayeux and FitzOsbern in charge of England during his absence. The king was back in England in 1068 and FitzOsbern accompanied him in the subjugation of south-west England. He attended the King&#x27;s Whitsun court in May 1068, and then visited Normandy, where he fell ill for some months.

In February or March 1069 FitzOsbern was asked by William to oversee the peace in York, where Gilbert de Ghent was made castellan of the new castle, but FitzOsbern returned south in time to attend the King&#x27;s Easter court in April 1069 before returning to York.

Eadric the Wild launched a campaign of Anglo-Saxon resistance in the West Midlands, with the assistance of a number of Welsh princes (who had lately been allies of the Anglo-Saxon kings). In 1069 the revolt was crushed, and it is likely FitzOsbern played a major part in this, although the details are not certain. During this time FitzOsbern and his followers pushed on westwards into Wales, thus beginning the Norman conquest of the Welsh Kingdom of Gwent.

===Castle builder===
As part of the assertion of Norman control over England and Wales, FitzOsbern was one of the major Norman castle builders. Early castles attributed to him include Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight, Chepstow Castle (Striguil) in South Wales, Snodhill Castle, Wigmore Castle and Clifford Castle in Herefordshire, Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire and Monmouth Castle in Wales. FitzOsbern also created or improved fortifications in the towns of Hereford and Shrewsbury.

===Distraction and death in Flanders===
In 1070 trouble arose in Flanders, where King William&#x27;s brother-in-law Count Baldwin VI of Flanders had died, leaving his county and his young sons in the hands of his widow Richilde, Countess of Mons and Hainaut. Her control of Flanders was challenged by the brother of her late husband, Robert the Frisian. Looking for help, she offered herself in marriage to FitzOsbern. He could not resist the chance to become also Count of this rich principality close to Normandy, and hurried there with his army. However, he was defeated by the Count of Flanders and killed in the Battle of Cassel on 22 February 1071.

==Marriages and children==
FitzOsbern married twice:
*Firstly to Adeliza de Tosny, daughter of Roger I of Tosny, by whom he had four children:
**William of Breteuil, who succeeded his father in Normandy. He was held captive and tortured by Ascelin Gouel de Perceval &#x27;Lupus&#x27;, Sire d&#x27;Yvry, until he finally granted his daughter Isabella de Breteuil in marriage to him.
**Roger de Breteuil, 2nd Earl of Hereford, who succeeded his father in England and Wales;
**Emma de Breteuil, wife of Ralph de Gael, 1st Earl of Norfolk
** Adela married John, Lord of Croy
*Secondly, it is assumed he married Richilde, Countess of Mons and Hainaut in 1070, shortly before the Battle of Cassel. They had a son who was taken to the Burgundy region of Savoy.
**Godfrey de Crepon Candie

==Popular culture==
He is portrayed by Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson in the 2025 TV series &quot;King and Conqueror&quot;.

<text>Pinscreen animation makes use of a screen filled with movable pins, which can be moved in or out by pressing an object onto the screen. The screen is lit from the side so that the pins cast shadows. The technique has been used to create animated films with a range of textural effects difficult to achieve with any other animation technique, including traditional cel animation.

==Origin==

The technique was invented and developed by Alexandre Alexeïeff and his wife Claire Parker in their own studio in Paris, between 1932 (first tests) and 1935, when Claire Parker registered in her own name the Brevet d´Invention nº 792340 at the Direction de la Propriété Industrielle, Ministère du Commerce et de L´Industrie, République Française, Paris 1935. They made a total of 6 very short films with it, over a period of fifty years. The films have short running time, because the device is difficult to use, and have a monochrome nature, due to the images being created using shadows over a white surface.

There is no material evidence that the National Film Board of Canada was involved in the development of the technique. The National Film Board of Canada did buy one of the pinboards built by them and, as guests of the NFB, on August 7, 1972, Alexeïeff and Parker demonstrated the pinscreen to a group of animators at the NFB. Due to Cecile Starr (friend of Alexeieff and Parker, and distributor of their work in the US) most insisting intervention talking to Norman McLaren that the opportunity should not be missed to preserve Alexeïeff&#x27;s knowledge, this demonstration was filmed, and later released by the NFB as &quot;Pin Screen&quot;. This film, along with &quot;Pinscreen Tests&quot; (1961), appear on disc 7 of the &quot;Norman McLaren: The Master&#x27;s Edition&quot; DVD collection. In this film several animators can be seen in the end of the demonstration experimenting with the pinscreen board, including Caroline Leaf.

Until his retirement in 2005, the National Film Board&#x27;s Jacques Drouin remained involved in pinscreen animation. Drouin&#x27;s pinscreen work included the 1976 film &quot;Mindscape (Le paysagiste)&quot;. He later passed his pinscreen on to Michèle Lemieux, who used the pinscreen with support of the NFB for her 2012 film &quot;Here and the Great Elsewhere&quot;. In 2015, the CNC acquired and restored the Épinette, the last pinscreen that Alexeïeff and Parker built in 1977. Eight artists were invited to train on the newly restored device, under the direction of Lemieux as part of an initiative to inspire a new generation of pinscreen artists. French animator Justine Vuylsteker was one of the artists selected for the intensive four-week residency on the Épinette. This residency led Vuylsteker to complete the short film &quot;Embraced&quot; in 2018.

==The pinscreen device==

A pinscreen is a white screen perforated with thousands of pins in small holes. Light shines from the side of the screen causing each pin to cast a shadow. Each pin, being able to slide back and forth through the holes, can cast different shadows. The pins do not move easily, presenting some resistance to movement in order to avoid unintended dislocation and thus image error. The pins&#x27; motion resistance depends on the pinscreen calibration. The white screen becomes darker the farther the pins are pushed out, protruding from the surface. The more the pins are pushed in less shadows are cast, the lighter the screen becomes, giving a grayish tone and eventually an all-white screen again.

==The animation technique==
According to Claire Parker, the images created by the pinscreen made it possible to make an animated movie which escaped from the flat, &quot;comic&quot; aspect of cel animation and plunged instead into the dramatic and the poetic by the exploitation of chiaroscuro, or shading effects. To obtain the desired gray tones that are cast from the shadows of the pins, several methods are used.

The original pinscreens built and used by Alexeïeff and Parker had more than 1 million pins. Today those pinscreens are at National Center of Cinematography and the moving image, near Paris. The pinscreen currently in Montreal, at National Film Board of Canada, has 240,000 pins. The pins are usually pressed with a small tool, groups of pins at a time, or with other specialized instruments. Being so thin, it is very difficult, and actually not desirable, to manipulate individual pins: moving one pin at a time there is the risk that it bends, thus ruining the pinscreen. Furthermore, the shadow cast by one single pin is negligible, almost non perceivable; only when manipulated in groups are the pins&#x27; shadows sufficiently dense to produce the chiaroscuro effect. Groups of pins are pressed and protruded with different tools, from specially created ones to more mundane, such as lamp bulbs, spoons, forks, and even Russian Matryoshka dolls. Frames are created one at a time, each frame being the incremental modification of the previous one. After each frame has been photographed, the images are strung together to create an image without pauses. The frame assembly containing the pins was built very solidly and mounted in a secure fashion to offer a stable image to the animation camera day after day, week after week as each image of the movie was painstakingly composed.
This form of animation is extremely time consuming and difficult to execute, rendering it the least popular method of animation. An additional reason for its unpopularity is its expensive nature. Individually, the pins are relatively cheap; however, it is not uncommon that a million or more may be used to complete a single screen, quickly increasing the cost for manufacture.

Probably the most famous use of Pin Screen technique is Orson Welles&#x27; 1962 film of Kafka&#x27;s novel &quot;The Trial&quot;; the film begins with a brief but striking memorable Pin Screen segment, elements of which reappear in a later scene projected onto and behind the actors.

==Digital pinscreen animation==
Because of the cost and labor-intensive animation process, several computer programs have been made with the goal of simulating the images generated by a physical pinscreen. One of the advantages of using digital pinscreen animation is the recovery of images. With the traditional pinscreen, there is no way to recover a previous image except for creating it all over again with no guarantee of precision. With digital pinscreen, the same image can be retrieved and altered without having to be recreated.

<text>Sciadopityaceae, commonly called umbrella pines, is a family of conifers now endemic to Japan but in prehistoric times they could also be found in Europe and China. The sole living member of the family is &quot;Sciadopitys verticillata&quot;, while several extinct genera are known from the fossil record. Wood suggested to belong to the family has been reported from the Jurassic of China, though the relationship of pre-Cretaceous fossils to &quot;Sciadopitys&quot; is ambiguous. &quot;Sciadopitys&quot; species are known from the Late Cretaceous of Japan before becoming widespread across Laurasia during most of the Cenozoic, especially in Europe until the Pliocene.

<text>Yoshi, known as Mario &amp; Yoshi in PAL regions, is a puzzle video game developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo. It was released for the NES and Game Boy platforms. Both versions were first released simultaneously in Japan on December 14, 1991, and released in all other regions the following year.

In &quot;Yoshi&quot;, the player is tasked with clearing monsters from the on-screen playing field. The monsters fall in from the top of the screen to build vertical stacks; the player must prevent a stack from growing too high such that it exits the play field. In order to do so, the player swaps and moves the stacks about such that falling monsters collide with identical monsters stationed atop the stacks, causing them to be removed from play. &quot;Yoshi&quot; offers both a scoring-focused single-player mode and a competitive two-player mode.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Yoshi&quot; is a falling block game in which the player is given a playing field that is divided into four columns. The objective is to match Yoshi egg shells to hatch them and prevent the four stacks, which pile up from the falling monsters, from growing too tall. The player character, Mario, swaps the stacks around such that the falling monsters will be eliminated by coming into contact with the blocks they match.

Monsters, which consist of various &quot;Mario&quot; enemies, appear at the top of the screen and fall into each the columns, turning into blocks as they land and creating stacks that incrementally grow in height. The main objective is to prevent the four stacks from growing too high by eliminating blocks from the field; a game over occurs when any of the stacks crosses the black line drawn across the top of the play field. A stack can hold up to eight objects in the NES version or seven in the Game Boy version.

To eliminate a block from the top of a stack, it must come in contact with a falling monster that matches it. For example, if a Goomba falls directly onto a Goomba block, both will be removed. The player controls Mario, who resides below the playing field and has the ability to swap the positions of any two adjacent stacks at a time. Thus, the player is required to switch around the stacks to ensure that the monsters fall into the correct places. Points are awarded for each set of monsters that are eliminated.

In addition to the four different types of monsters, two halves of a Yoshi eggshell will also fall. The bottom eggshell half behaves like a monster: it disappears when it comes into contact with another bottom half. However, if a falling top half comes into contact with a bottom half, the two will join and hatch a Yoshi, earning the player bonus points. Furthermore, if a stack of monsters grows atop a bottom half and a top half is then added, all monsters between the halves will be encased and eliminated. Larger Yoshi characters will hatch depending on the number of monsters encased, which also increases the number of bonus points awarded. If a falling top half does not have any bottom half to join to in the stack it touches, it is automatically removed and no points are awarded.

The single-player mode has two variations: A-Type and B-Type. In A-Type, the game is played indefinitely until the player receives a game over. In B-Type, the player plays a series of levels in which the player is required to completely clear the playing field of all the blocks. The initial number of blocks inside the playing field grows as the player progresses. In multiplayer mode, a second player controls Luigi. The two players play simultaneously in separate playing fields using the traditional rules. A player wins the match by clearing all the blocks in the field or when the other receives a game over; the first player to win three matches wins overall.

==Development==
&quot;Yoshi&quot; was the first collaboration between developer Game Freak and publisher Nintendo. Nintendo had previously passed on publishing Game Freak&#x27;s first title, &quot;Mendel Palace&quot; for the NES. After the smaller company incorporated and began work on its second release, &quot;Smart Ball&quot; for the SNES, Nintendo made Game Freak the offer to develop &quot;Yoshi&quot;. It was suggested by Tsunekazu Ishihara, an associate of Game Freak co-founder Satoshi Tajiri, that they develop smaller games like &quot;Yoshi&quot; in order to give the company the financial backing to eventually realize its larger-scale project, the RPG series &quot;Pokémon&quot;. &quot;Yoshi&quot; was developed in six months with Tajiri as its director. Ken Sugimori came up with the gameplay concept. Ishihara and Yoshi creator Shigeru Miyamoto served as producers. Tajiri explained that it was during the development of &quot;Yoshi&quot; that he learned the &quot;wave&quot; design of game difficulty in which the player is presented with an easy stage directly after a challenging one to allow them to savor their accomplishment. Junichi Masuda composed the game&#x27;s music and sound. Masuda stated that he spent an extensive amount of time programming the movement of the game&#x27;s menu items to its music. Game Freak had also wanted to add in a realistic-sounding Yoshi voice, but Nintendo disapproved of it. In 2024, a prototype of an unreleased Nintendo DS remake was discovered as part of the October 2024 Game Freak leak, hidden in the source code of &quot;Pokémon Black and White&quot;; evidence led some to believe that the prototype may have been based on an unreleased Super Famicom version.

==Release==
The NES version of &quot;Yoshi&quot; was made available for purchase on the Virtual Console for the Wii in 2007. The game was then re-released on September 1, 2011, as a downloadable title on the Nintendo 3DS, available only to members of the Nintendo Ambassador program. &quot;Yoshi&quot; was made available for purchase in the Nintendo eShop on August 22, 2012, in Japan, on February 21, 2013, in North America and on May 2, 2013, in Europe. It was also released for the Wii U on June 12, 2013, as the part of the 30th anniversary of the Famicom with the price of 30 cents which become the regular price starting on July 12, 2013. The NES version was also released on Nintendo Switch Online on September 18, 2018.

==Reception==
===Contemporary===
&quot;Yoshi&quot; sold 500,000 copies in Japan on its first day on sale. In the United States, the game topped Babbage&#x27;s NES sales charts for two months in 1992, from August to September. In the United Kingdom, the Game Boy version still sold 100,000 copies in 1997, years after release.

Upon release, the game received a positive review from the Europress gaming magazine &quot;N-Force&quot;, which stated in a preview for the game in its September 1992 issue that &quot;basically [the game] is great. The fun of Tetris, but with colour and sound effects. Just as hard, maybe harder – definitely just as addictive.&quot; It later rated the game 4 out of 5 in the Buyers&#x27; Guide for its January 1993 issue, summarizing that &quot;Yoshi is great fun. Gameplay&#x27;s nothing new – Tetris all over again! Graphics are a treat. Lots of fun – in short bursts.&quot;

===Retrospective===
&quot;Yoshi&quot; received mixed reviews from retrospective critics, with common criticism directed towards its perceived repetitive gameplay and dependence on luck, which led to insufficient replay value. Brett Alan Weiss of &quot;Allgame&quot; called &quot;Yoshi&quot; a &quot;surprisingly dull game,&quot; noting that while the game&#x27;s controls are unique, &quot;the novelty wears off after a while.&quot;

Reviews of &quot;Yoshi&quot;″s Virtual Console release on Wii in 2007 were also mixed. Both Frank Provo of &quot;GameSpot&quot; and Lucas M. Thomas of &quot;IGN&quot; rated &quot;Yoshi&quot; 5 out of 10. Thomas regarded the gameplay as &quot;slow&quot; and the controls &quot;cumbersome,&quot; and concluded that the game is a &quot;beginner&#x27;s puzzler, holding little appeal for experienced players&quot;. While Provo complimented both the game&#x27;s graphics and music, he stated that the gameplay did not involve much strategy, inciting little reason to play more than a few minutes. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; felt that &quot;Yoshi&quot; was &quot;uninspired&quot;, rating the game 4 out of 10.

Several websites that covered recent Virtual Console releases recommended that players refrain from purchasing &quot;Yoshi&quot;. Nintendo World Report stated that &quot;there&#x27;s too much luck and chance in the game to make playing it satisfying,&quot; and &quot;Joystiq&quot; also stated that &quot;while [the gameplay is] admittedly a pretty interesting way to spend an afternoon, it still feels like kind of a ripoff.&quot; Jeremy Parish of &quot;1UP.com&quot; stated that the gameplay in &quot;Yoshi&quot; was &quot;not enough to justify the asking price [of 500 points],&quot; though he later stated that, compared to the &quot;uninspired&quot; &quot;Yoshi&#x27;s Cookie&quot;, &quot;Yoshi&quot; was &quot;decent and actually had some relationship to the Mario series.&quot; &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; placed &quot;Yoshi&quot; last in its ranking of 13 &quot;Yoshi&quot; games, writing: &quot;&quot;Yoshi&quot; is hardly the most scintillating of puzzlers, but we&#x27;ve played worse tile-matching games in our time and it does have a relatively unique plate/column switching mechanic.&quot;

<doc id="440579" wikidata="Q502261" url="?curid=440579" title="Silence">
<text>Silence is the absence of ambient audible sound, the emission of sounds of such low intensity that they do not draw attention to themselves, or the state of having ceased to produce sounds; this latter sense can be extended to apply to the cessation or absence of any form of communication, whether through speech or other medium. Remaining mute can be a symptom of mental illness.

Sometimes speakers fall silent when they hesitate in searching for a word, or interrupt themselves before correcting themselves. Discourse analysis shows that people use brief silences to mark the boundaries of prosodic units, in turn-taking, or as reactive tokens, for example, as a sign of displeasure, disagreement, embarrassment, desire to think, confusion, and the like. Relatively prolonged intervals of silence can be used in rituals; in some religious disciplines, people maintain silence for protracted periods, or even for the rest of their lives, as an ascetic means of spiritual transformation.

==Perception==
In the philosophy of perception and the science of perception, there has been a longstanding controversy as to how humans experience silence: &quot;the perceptual view (we literally hear silence), and the cognitive view (we only or infer silence)&quot;, with prominent theories holding the latter view. However, a study published in 2023 in the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot; reported findings based on empirical experiments testing whether temporal distortions known to be experienced with respect to sounds, were also analogously experienced with respect to periods of silence. The experimental results in all cases suggested that, at least in this context, humans respond to moments of silence the same way as to sounds—supporting the perceptual view that humans literally hear silence.

== Rhetorical practice ==

Silence may become an effective rhetorical practice or communication tactic when people choose to be silent for a specific purpose. It has not merely been recognized as a theory but also as a phenomenon with practical advantages. When silence becomes rhetorical, it is intentional since it reflects a meaning. Rhetorical silence targets an audience rather than the rhetorician.

Strategic silence be an instrument in negotiations, debates, interpersonal relationships, and even broader social and political contexts. Its effectiveness lies in its ambiguity. It can be interpreted in a multitude of ways, fostering uncertainty and prompting introspection in the other party. This ambiguity can be leveraged to gain an advantage, create space for reflection, or even exert pressure without uttering a single word.

==Uses==
===History===
Joseph Jordania has suggested that in social animals (including humans), silence can be a sign of danger. Many social animals produce seemingly haphazard sounds which are known as contact calls. These are a mixture of various sounds, accompanying the group&#x27;s everyday business (for example, foraging, feeding), and they are used to maintain audio contact with the members of the group. Some social animal species communicate the signal of potential danger by stopping contact calls and freezing, without the use of alarm calls, through silence. Charles Darwin wrote about this in relation with wild horse and cattle. Jordania has further suggested that human humming could have been a contact method that early humans used to avoid silence. According to his suggestion, humans find prolonged silence distressing (suggesting danger to them). This may help explain why lone humans in relative sonic isolation feel a sense of comfort from humming, whistling, talking to themselves, or having the TV or radio on.

===Spirituality===
&quot;Silence&quot; in spirituality is often a metaphor for inner stillness. A silent mind, freed from the onslaught of thoughts and thought patterns, is both a goal and an important step in spiritual development. Such &quot;inner silence&quot; is not about the absence of sound; instead, it is understood to bring one in contact with the divine, the ultimate reality, or one&#x27;s own true self, one&#x27;s divine nature. Many religious traditions imply the importance of being quiet and still in mind and spirit for transformative and integral spiritual growth to occur. In Christianity, there is the silence of contemplative prayer such as centering prayer and Christian meditation; in Islam, there are the wisdom writings of the Sufis who insist on the importance of finding silence within. In Buddhism, the descriptions of silence and allowing the mind to become silent are implied as a feature of spiritual enlightenment. In Hinduism, including the teachings of Advaita Vedanta and the many paths of yoga, teachers insist on the importance of silence, &quot;Mauna&quot;, for inner growth. Ramana Maharishi, a revered Hindu sage, said, &quot;The only language able to express the whole truth is silence.&quot; Perkey Avot, the Jewish Sages guide for living, states that, &quot;Tradition is a safety fence to Torah, tithing a safety fence to wealth, vows a safety fence for abstinence; a safety fence for wisdom ... is silence.&quot; In some traditions of Quakerism, communal silence is the usual context of worship meetings, in patient expectancy for the divine to speak in the heart and mind. In the Baháʼí Faith, Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah said in &quot;Words of Wisdom&quot;, &quot;the essence of true safety is to observe silence&quot;. Eckhart Tolle says that silence can be seen either as the absence of noise, or as the space in which sound exists, just as inner stillness can be seen as the absence of thought, or the space in which thoughts are perceived.

===Commemoration===
A common way to remember a tragic incident and to remember the victims or casualties of such an event is a commemorative moment of silence.

===Debate===
Argumentative silence is the rhetorical practice of saying nothing when an opponent in a debate expects something to be said. Poorly executed, it can be offensive, like refusing to answer a direct question. A well-timed silence can throw an opponent off and give the debater the upper hand.

An argument from silence () is an argument based on the assumption that someone&#x27;s silence on a matter suggests (an informal fallacy) that person&#x27;s ignorance of the matter. In general, &quot;ex silentio&quot; refers to the claim that the absence of something demonstrates the proof of a proposition.
===Law===
The right to silence is a legal protection enjoyed by people undergoing police interrogation or trial in certain countries. The law is either explicit or recognized in many legal systems.

===Film===
The documentary film &quot;In Pursuit of Silence&quot; (2016) portrays the spiritual and physical benefits of silence, as well as the price paid individually and collectively for a noisy world. It is narrated by authors Helen Lees (&quot;Silence in Schools&quot;), Pico Iyer (&quot;The Art of Stillness&quot;), Susan Cain (&quot;&quot;), Maggie Ross (&quot;Silence: A User&#x27;s Guide&quot;), and George Prochnik (&quot;In Pursuit of Silence&quot;).

===Music===

Music inherently depends on silence, in some form or another, to distinguish other periods of sound and allow dynamics, melodies, and rhythms to have greater impact. For example, most music scores feature &quot;rests&quot;, which denote periods of silence. In addition, silence in music can be seen as a time for contemplation. The audience feels the effects of the previous notes and melodies, and can intentionally reflect on what they have heard. Silence does not hinder musical excellence but can enhance the sounds of instruments and vocals within a given musical composition.

In his book &quot;Sound and Silence&quot; (1970), the composer John Paynter says, &quot;the dramatic effect of silence has long been appreciated by composers.&quot; He gives as an example &quot;the general pause in the middle of the chorus &#x27;Have lightnings and thunders …&#x27; in Bach&#x27;s &quot;St. Matthew Passion&quot;&quot;:

After the pause, the music continues to the words: &quot;Open up the fiery bottomless pit, O hell!&quot; The silence is intended to communicate a momentary sensation of terror, of staring into unfathomable darkness. Another example of a dramatic silence comes in the &quot;rest full of tension&quot; at the climactic ending of the &quot;Hallelujah&quot; chorus in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;:

Musical silences may also convey humour. Haydn&#x27;s Quartet in E flat, Op. 33 was nicknamed &quot;The Joke&quot;, because of the comic timing of the pauses at the end of the last movement: 

Taruskin (2010, p. 552) says, &quot;whenever this ending is performed, it takes the audience an extra second or so to recover its wits and realize that the piece is indeed over. The result is an inevitable giggle—the same giggle that overtakes a prestidigitator&#x27;s audience when it realizes that it has been &#x27;had&#x27;.&quot;

Barry Cooper (2011, p. 38) writes extensively of Beethoven&#x27;s many uses of silence for contemplation, for dramatic effect and especially for driving the rhythmic impetus of the music. He cites the start of the second movement of the Ninth Symphony, where the silences contribute to a powerful sense of propulsion: &quot;The rhythm of bar 1 is incomplete and demands a note at the beginning of bar 2. The substitution of such a note by a whole-bar rest therefore gives the effect of a suppressed sound, as if one were about to speak but then refrains at the last moment. The &#x27;suppressed sound&#x27; is then repeated in bar 4, and &#x27;developed&#x27; (by being doubled) in bars 7 and 8.&quot; writes of the &quot;strange irregularity of rhythm in the sixth bar&quot; of this movement.

Robert Schumann&#x27;s song &quot;Ich hab&#x27; im Traum geweinet&quot; from his song cycle &quot;Dichterliebe&quot; uses silence to convey an almost gothic ambiance, suggesting the darkness of the grave where the dreaming poet imagines his lover has been placed: &quot;I wept in my dreams, I dreamt you were lying in your grave.&quot; 

In his book advising pianists and singers about interpretation, the pianist Gerald Moore stresses the need to fully observe the precisely notated rests, especially in the fourth bar above &quot;where nothing is happening, that is to say nothing except a silence, a pregnant silence which, if shortened, dissipates the suffering it is intended to convey.&quot;

Much has been said about the harmony of the opening to Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, which Taruskin (2010, p. 540) calls &quot;perhaps the most famous, surely the most commented-on, single phrase of music ever written.&quot; His strategic use of silences between phrases intensifies the troubled ambiguity of the music: &quot;The chord that fills the ensuing silence in the listener&#x27;s inner ear… is the unstated – indeed never to be stated, and ultimately needless to be stated – tonic of that key.&quot;

Some of the most effective musical silences are very short, lasting barely a fraction of a second. In the spirited and energetic finale of his Symphony No. 2, Brahms uses silences at several points to powerfully disrupt the rhythmic momentum that has been building. (See also syncopation.) 

During the 20th century, composers explored further the expressive potential of silence in their music. The contemplative concluding bars of Anton Webern&#x27;s Symphony (1928) and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Les Noces&quot; The Wedding, 1923) make telling and atmospheric use of pauses. Eric Walter White (1947, p. 74) describes the ending of &quot;Les Noces&quot; as follows: &quot;As the voices cease singing, pools of silence come flooding in between the measured strokes of the bell chord, and the music dies away in a miraculously fresh and radiant close.&quot;

John Paynter (1970, p. 24) vividly conveys how silence contributes to the titanic impact of the third section of Messiaen&#x27;s orchestral work &quot;Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum&quot; (1964):Woodwinds jump, growl and shriek. Silence. Eight solemn bell strokes echo and die. Again silence. Suddenly the brasses blare, and out of the trombones&#x27; awesome processional grows a steady roar … the big gongs the tam-tam beaten in a long and powerful resonance, shattering and echoing across mountains and along valleys. This is music of the high hills, music for vast spaces: &#x27;The hour is coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God&#x27;. We can feel the awe and the majesty of the High Alps and the great churches. The instrumental sounds are vast the silences are deep. The words of St John are alive in the music, and through these sounds Messiaen reveals himself and his vision.An extreme example from 1952 is &quot;4′33″&quot;, an experimental musical work by avant-garde composer John Cage, incorporating ambient sounds not foreseeable by the composer. Though first performed on the piano, the piece was composed for any instrument or instruments and is structured in three movements. The length of each movement is not fixed by the composer, but the total length of the combination of three movements is. The score instructs the performer(s) to remain silent throughout the piece.

There are telling examples of the use of silence in jazz. A frequently used effect, known as &quot;stop-time&quot;, places silences at moments where listeners or dancers might expect a strong beat, contributing to the syncopation. Scott Joplin&#x27;s &quot;Rag-Time Dance&quot; (1902) features stop-time silences: 
Early recordings of the &quot;Rag Time Dance&quot; follow Joplin&#x27;s instructions as follows: &quot;To get the desired effect of &#x27;Stop Time&#x27;, the pianist will please stamp the heel of one foot heavily upon the floor.&quot; Later recordings disregard this direction – the regular beat is implied rather than stated and the silences are more palpable. Keith Swanwick (1979, p. 70) is enchanted by the &quot;playfulness and humour&quot; engendered by the stop-time effects in Jelly Roll Morton&#x27;s solo piano recording of &quot;The Crave&quot; (1939): &quot;If we listen to this, tapping or clicking along with the beat, we shalt find ourselves surprised by two patches of silence near the end. The beat goes on but the sound stops. The effect is something like being thrown forward when a car stops suddenly. It is the biggest surprise in an engaging piece of music full of little deviations (syncopations) from the repeated beat.&quot;

Other examples include the closing bars of Louis Armstrong&#x27;s recording of &quot;Struttin&#x27; with Some Barbecue&quot; (1928) and the hair&#x27;s-breadth pause at the end of pianist Bill Evans&#x27; solo on Miles Davis&#x27; recording of &quot;On Green Dolphin Street&quot; (1959). Duke Ellington&#x27;s &quot;Madness in Great Ones&quot;, from his Shakespearean Suite &quot;Such Sweet Thunder&quot; (1957) conveys the feigned madness of Prince Hamlet through abrupt and unpredictable pauses that interrupt the flow of the music. The reggae band Black Slate had a hit in 1980 with the song &quot;Amigo&quot;. The instrumental introduction features sudden silences before the voice enters.

<text>Kai Lung () is a fictional character in a series of books by Ernest Bramah, consisting of &quot;The Wallet of Kai Lung&quot; (1900), &quot;Kai Lung&#x27;s Golden Hours&quot; (1922), &quot;Kai Lung Unrolls His Mat&quot; (1928), &quot;The Moon of Much Gladness&quot; (1932; published in the US as &quot;The Return of Kai Lung&quot;), &quot;Kai Lung Beneath the Mulberry Tree&quot; (1940), &quot;Kai Lung: Six&quot; (1974) and &quot;Kai Lung Raises His Voice&quot; (2010).

==Overview==
Kai Lung is a Chinese storyteller whose travels and exploits serve mainly as excuses to introduce substories, which generally take up the majority of a Kai Lung book. He is a man of very simple motivations; most frequently, he is animated by a desire for enough taels to be able to feed and clothe himself. Otherwise, his main motivation is love for his wife, Hwa-mei, and he seeks nothing more than a simple, sustainable lifestyle. Generally, he does not intrude in other people&#x27;s affairs unless he thinks it necessary to teach them the rudiments of classical proportion with one of his fables.

He usually comes into conflict with barbarians, bandits, and other people who are not classically educated, as well as various unscrupulous individuals who are intent on taking away his property.

In Thorne Smith&#x27;s comedic fantasy &quot;The Stray Lamb&quot;, the character Mr. Lamb relaxes while reading Kai Lung.

Dorothy L. Sayers mentions Kai Lung and/or quotes from the books in several Lord Peter Wimsey novels, specifically &quot;Strong Poison&quot;, &quot;Gaudy Night&quot; and &quot;Busman&#x27;s Honeymoon&quot;

In &quot;&#x27;He Cometh and He Passeth By!&#x27;&quot; by H. Russell Wakefield, one of the principal characters reads &quot;The Wallet of Kai-Lung&quot; before retiring to bed.

Ford Madox Ford repeatedly quoted the allegedly Chinese proverb &quot;It would be hypocrisy to seek for the person of the Sacred Emperor in a Low Tea House.&quot; It has been convincingly argued that Ford originally acquired this proverb from the Kai Lung novels of Ernest Bramah, and that Bramah had created it for Kai Lung, rather than quoting a genuine Chinese proverb.

Irene the Librarian quotes Kai Lung in Genevieve Cogman’s novel “The Secret Chapter”.

<text>Tyger (; ) was the ship used by the Dutch captain Adriaen Block during his 1613 voyage to explore the East Coast of North America and the present day Hudson River. Its remains were uncovered in 1916 during the construction of the New York City Subway on land that is now part of the World Trade Center complex.

==History==
In late summer of 1613, &quot;Tyger&quot; had moored in Lower Manhattan on the Hudson to trade with the Lenape Indians along with its partner Hendrick Christiaensen&#x27;s &quot;Fortuyn&quot;. By November, &quot;Tyger&quot; had been filled with pelts of beaver, otter, and other skins obtained in barter.

In November, an accidental fire broke out and &quot;Tyger&quot; rapidly burned to the waterline. The charred hull was beached and all but the small section of prow and keel salvaged in 1916 remained in that location, buried beneath what later became the intersection of Greenwich and Dey Streets in Lower Manhattan. During the fire, the crew salvaged some sails, rope, tools and fittings.

Over the winter, Block and his menpresumably with help from the Indiansbuilt &quot;Onrust&quot; (&quot;Restless&quot;), which they used to explore the East River and Long Island Sound before returning to Europe in 1614.

==Rediscovery==
The shore of Manhattan was expanded through landfill in the centuries following the fire.

In 1916, workmen led by James A. Kelly uncovered the prow and keel of &quot;Tyger&quot; while excavating an extension for the New York City Subway BMT Broadway Line near the intersection of Greenwich and Dey Streets. The ship and some related artifacts were discovered by Kelly&#x27;s crew at a depth of about below the streetright where it had been beached on the shoreline of Manhattan Island at the time of the ship&#x27;s burning. Over a period of 150 years after the vessel had been beached, approximately of silt accumulated and, in 1763, a waterfront fill-in project added another .

Although the excavation crew was under great pressure to keep the pace of work on schedule, Kelly persuaded his supervisors to allow sufficient excavation to remove about of prow and keel with three of the hull&#x27;s ribs. The timbers were placed in the seal tank of the New York Aquarium in Battery Park. In 1943, they were presented to the Museum of the City of New York for exhibition in the Marine Gallery.

The remainder of the ship may still rest approximately below ground, due east of the former site of the North Tower of the World Trade Center; however, it might have been dug up in the process of building the World Trade Center. Also, &quot;Tyger&quot; appears not to have been the only ship wrecked on the World Trade Center site.

<doc id="440599" wikidata="Q7662591" url="?curid=440599" title="Synon">
<text>Synon was a software company which, at its height, dominated the worldwide market for third-party application development tools for the IBM i (formerly AS/400) platform. Its products continue to be used in that sector today, distributed and supported by Broadcom Inc.

==Chronology==
Synon Ltd was founded in London in 1984 by Simon Williams (CEO), Melinda Horton (COO) and Nick Knowles (CTO) with the objective of developing an application generator for the IBM System/38 platform. They were soon joined by Simon Haigh (VP Sales).

Synon&#x27;s first product was Synon/1, a programming productivity toolkit for the System/38, launched in 1985. In the same year the company appointed its first overseas distributors, in Australia and Norway.

Synon&#x27;s flagship product, Synon/2 was launched in 1986 and became an immediate success with System/38 users. The same year, Chris Herron, formerly CEO of Fusion, along with Patrick Batty of Toronto, and Gerard Wolf of Chicago, set up Synon Inc, Synon&#x27;s US sales and marketing subsidiary, in Larkspur, California. Synon also established a worldwide distribution channel with subsidiaries in France, Germany, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan.

*In 1987, Synon played a key role alongside IBM at the UK launch of its AS/400 platform. The AS/400 version of Synon/2 was named Synon/2E.
*In 1989, Synon, along with Bachman, Intersolv, KnowledgeWare and Systematica, was chosen by IBM to be at the heart of AD/Cycle, its framework for application development and CASE. IBM later acquired an equity stake in Synon.
*In 1990, French Connection sold its equity stake to General Atlantic Partners and TA Associates, two US VCs. As a condition of the transaction, Synon moved its HQ to Larkspur and became a Delaware corporation, changing its name to Synon Corporation. Shortly afterwards, Chris Herron became CEO. Simon Williams, who remained based in the UK, continued as Chairman and CTO.
*In 1990, Technicolor Rome following the vision of IT Director: Vincenzo Compagnoni, used Synon (at that time, a pioneer technology), to develop its entire information system (6,000 RPG programs) computerising the whole Film Laboratory supply chain and demonstrating the consistency of CASE TOOL technologies.
*In 1991, Synon launched Synon Model Applications, an accounting package developed using Synon/2E. In the same year, the company won the Queen&#x27;s Awards for Technology and for Export, becoming one of only a handful of companies ever to win both awards in the same year.
*In 1992, Simon Williams, believing that the company was in danger of missing the client/server technology wave, left Synon together with Melinda Horton to establish Dysys, a self-funded UK start-up whose object was to develop a client/server, cross-platform successor to Synon/2E. In 1993 Williams and Horton sold Dysys to Synon, and returned to the fold. Their new product, Obsydian, was launched by Synon in 1994.
*In 1994, Synon/PE (Performance Expert) was created by Lou Kurrelmeyer and added to the Synon product line as a royalty product. Synon/PE analyzed 2E design models and suggested/automatically made corrections that reduced resource utilization by up to 600% when comparing end results of the executing application with starting results.
*By 1997, Synon&#x27;s revenue was $80 million, with around 6,000 customers worldwide.
*In 1998, Synon was acquired by Sterling Software of Plano, Texas. Sterling continued to distribute and support Synon/2E and Obsydian as COOL:2E and COOL:Plex. La Crosse Management Systems of La Crosse, Wisconsin acquired Synon Model Applications from Sterling and continues to distribute it as La Crosse Financials.
*In 2000, Sterling was acquired by Computer Associates, which continued to distribute and develop Synon/2E and Obsydian as CA 2E and CA Plex.
*In 2018, Computer Associates (by then CA Technologies Inc.) was acquired by Broadcom Inc. Broadcom continues to distribute Synon/2E and Obsydian as CA 2E and CA Plex.

Simon Williams went on to develop the Associative Model of Data and to found Lazysoft.

==Technology==
As early as 1986, Synon pioneered the approach to development which in early 2005 became known as Architected Rapid Application Development (ARAD). Such tools use abstract patterns as building blocks to automatically generate the components of an application.

In Synon/2, developers use a specialized language to define an application&#x27;s data model and the rules that ensure its integrity. They then select from a set of around 30 pre-built program design templates which perform edit, display and print functions in full screen, multi-line and transaction (full screen header above a multi-line detail) modes. Developers may further specialise the procedural logic of the selected templates and link templates together by using action diagrams.

The tool then automatically instantiates the specialized templates over the data model and generates high-level language code in RPG or COBOL without any further developer intervention. It also generates the SQL or DDS code to define the necessary database tables and views.

Synon kept precise productivity metrics during the internal development of its SMA accounting system. In total, 2,385 days of effort were expended on development and QA over a 14-month period, which resulted in the creation of 2.42 million lines of HLL code (excluding comments) in 2,081 programs. This is equivalent to the production of 1,016 lines of fully tested and documented code per person per day. The all-in, fully loaded cost (including management, design and end-user documentation) was £416 per program.

Synon/2 was also ahead of its time by adopting a strictly object oriented approach to the programs that it generated. For instance, programmers could not use native HLL commands to operate on database tables: instead, all physical database creates, changes and retrievals were encapsulated within individual templates, which were in turn evoked by generated programs. Thus programs could be automatically regenerated with no manual intervention following changes to the structure of the database.

In 2001, CA introduced an add-on tool to CA 2E called Web Option, which allows 2E customers to web-enable their existing applications and to run those applications (which were originally designed for an IBM &#x27;green-screen&#x27;) inside a standard web browser.

Obsydian follows the same general principles as Synon/2, with the important exception that developers can create and re-use their own abstract design templates. The CA Plex toolset also operates web and client-server applications, and generates in C#, C++, Java, RPG/III and IV/ILE IBM RPG and is multi-platform.

<doc id="440602" wikidata="Q1760573" url="?curid=440602" title="River Westbourne">
<text>The Westbourne or Kilburn, also known as the Ranelagh Sewer, is a culverted small River Thames tributary in London, rising in Hampstead and Brondesbury Park and which as a drain unites and flows southward through Kilburn and Bayswater (west end of Paddington) to skirt underneath the east of Hyde Park&#x27;s Serpentine lake then through central Chelsea under Sloane Square. It passes centrally under the south side of Royal Hospital Chelsea&#x27;s Ranelagh Gardens before discharging into Inner London&#x27;s combined sewer system, with exceptional discharges (to be abated by a 2021-completion scheme) into the Inner London Tideway. Since the latter 19th century, the population of its catchment has risen further but to reduce the toll it places on the Beckton Sewage Treatment Works and related bills its narrow basin has been assisted by private soakaways, and public surface water drains. Its depression has been replaced with and adopted as a reliable route for a gravity combined sewer.
The formation of the Serpentine relied on the water, a lake with a long, ornate footbridge and various activities associated, which today uses little-polluted water from a great depth.

==Names==
The river was originally called the Kilburn (Cye Bourne – royal stream, &#x27;Bourne and burn&#x27; being the Germanic word equivalent to rivulet as in the geographical term &#x27;winterbourne&#x27;) but has been known, at different times and in different places, as Kelebourne, Kilburn, Bayswater, Bayswater River, Bayswater Rivulet, Serpentine River, The Bourne, Westburn Brook, the Ranelagh River and the Ranelagh Sewer. It is of similar size to the Fleet.

==Course==
Rising from several sources in Hampstead, and Brondesbury Park, the river or drain flows south through Kilburn (also the name of the river at that point) running west along Kilburn Park Road and then south along Shirland Road. After crossing Bishops Bridge Road, the river continued more or less due south, between what is now Craven Terrace and what is now Gloucester Terrace. At this point, the river was known until the early 19th century as the Bayswater rivulet and from that it gave its name to the area now known as Bayswater. Originally Bayswater was the stretch of the stream where it crosses Bayswater Road, &quot;Bayards Watering&quot; in 1652 and &quot;Bayards Watering Place&quot; in 1654. It is said that there is a reference to Bayards Watering Place as early as 1380. There were a few houses at this spot in the eighteenth century and, it seems, a man called Bayard used or offered it as a watering place for horses on this road (formerly Uxbridge Road). The river entered Hyde Park at what is now the Serpentine and is within the park joined by a tributary, Tyburn Brook. The Serpentine was formed in 1730 by building a dam across the Westbourne at the instigation of Queen Caroline, wife of George II, to beautify the royal park. The Westbourne ceased to provide the water for the Serpentine in 1834, as the culverted Westbourne had become the most convenient main sewer and the Serpentine is now supplied from three boreholes from the upper chalk underneath Hyde Park. The Serpentine was widely imitated in parks and gardens nationwide.

The Westbourne left Hyde Park (both before and after it had been dammed to form the Serpentine) at Knightsbridge which was originally a bridge over the Westbourne itself. It is recorded that, in the year 1141, the citizens of London met Matilda of England (Queen Maud) at this bridge. The river ran from Knightsbridge south under Bourne Street, SW1 and followed very closely the boundary between the City of Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, joining the River Thames at Chelsea.

The waters of the Westbourne or Bayswater were originally pure and in 1437 and 1439 conduits were laid to carry water from the Westbourne into the City of London, for drinking. In the 19th century, however, the water became foul by its use as a sewer, and the rise of the water closet as the prevailing form of sanitation.

When west Belgravia, east Chelsea and Paddington were developed, it was becoming obvious the river would have to remain a combined or foul sewer, with a certain storm element until such time as surface water drains (if ever) were built upstream. Pipes were therefore wrought in the early part of the 19th century with larger successors completed in the 1850s. The Westbourne is one of the lost rivers of London.

The storm drain, combined sewer, pipe of the lower course can still be seen running above the platform of Sloane Square tube station. Made, in the 19th century, of riveted sections it is below the ceiling towards the end of the platforms closest to the exits. The station was badly bombed during the Bombing of London in November 1940 but the pipe was not damaged.

After flowing beneath the eastern lands of the Royal Military Hospital Gardens and beneath a corner of Chelsea Barracks, the drain was in all but exceptional storms entirely designed to be received by the Joseph Bazalgette-designed Northern Low Level Sewer. As some of its foul content overwhelms the system with further inflows from the west, an improvement, the Thames Tideway Scheme tunnel will enable that sewer to continue to cope.

A clearance in sand against the tideway is about west of Chelsea Bridge. An emergency combined sewer overflow also called the Ranelagh Sewer, is obvious except at high tide. The combined sewer aims to be caught only by two intercept sewers capable of its flow, the Middle Level Sewer and the Northern Low Level Sewer in the London sewerage system.

==Maps==
The finest and most intelligible map of the whole course of the Westbourne, superimposed over the Victorian street plan, is found in an article by J. G. Waller, published in the &quot;Transactions of the London and Middlesex Archaeological Society&quot;, vol VI (1882) pp 272–279.

Waller&#x27;s map shows that the stream never ran further west than the easternmost extremity of Westbourne Grove, Notting Hill (an east–west road ending at Queensway where the course lay). Westbourne Grove is, as its name suggests, west of the bourne.

<doc id="440603" wikidata="Q7728445" url="?curid=440603" title="The Current (radio program)">
<text>The Current is a Canadian current affairs radio program which airs weekday mornings on CBC Radio One. It airs from 8:37 a.m. local time to 10 a.m., with the exception of Newfoundland, where it runs from 9:07 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.

The show features interview sessions and radio documentaries that typically take up a half hour each.

==History==
The program premiered in 2002, and was hosted from its inception by investigative journalist Anna Maria Tremonti. It was created as a replacement for &quot;This Morning&quot;, partially in response to criticism that the prior program&#x27;s prerecorded format had hamstrung the network&#x27;s ability to pivot to a live breaking news broadcast on the day of the September 11 attacks.

Tremonti retired from the program in June 2019. Laura Lynch served as interim host until the end of 2019, and Matt Galloway took over as the program&#x27;s new permanent host effective January 6, 2020.

During the COVID-19 pandemic until May 15, 2020, &quot;The Current&#x27;s&quot; runtime was extended to the rest of the morning for most of the nation to cover that issue, replacing &quot;Q&quot; (although it still had its shorter evening broadcast slot) and the various half-hour 11:30 AM shows with the host of the former show, Tom Power appearing for selected arts stories related to the pandemic. In addition, the final hour was pre-empted in most of the nation&#x27;s time zones by a daily scheduled public address by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and analysis of it with the remaining time of the final hour covered by reruns of interviews earlier of that day&#x27;s show.

==Guest hosts==
On Fridays during the regular season period, a guest host was often used for the broadcast, who would be introduced on the preceding Thursday to read listener correspondence with Tremonti. Guest hosts were usually CBC personalities such as Maureen Taylor, Adrienne Arsenault, Nancy Wilson, Erica Johnson, Ian Hanomansing, Piya Chattopadhyay and Anthony Germain, although other Canadian journalists, including Haroon Siddiqui, Jan Wong and David Frum, also appeared.

In 2004, the program also did a one-off joint broadcast with the American radio program &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, with Amy Goodman acting as the guest host of &quot;The Current&quot;.

During the summer months of July and August, the regular host is replaced as host for the entire period with guests; on major holidays, the show is usually preempted for other network programming, commonly repeat broadcasts of entertainment programs, holiday music, or selections from the CBC&#x27;s library of podcasts.

==Season-long story themes==
From 2007 to 2018, the series ran regular season-long arcs of stories that dealt with a particular theme. The themes that were explored have included:
* 2007–08 — &quot;Diet for a Hungry Planet&quot;: Food and world hunger.
* 2008–09 — &quot;Watershed&quot;: The politics and issues dealing with water.
* 2009–10 — &quot;Work in Progress&quot;: Labour and employment related issues. 
* 2010–11 — &quot;Shift&quot;: Population demographics and the changing nature of Canada&#x27;s population.
* 2011–12 — &quot;Gamechangers&quot;: People and significant events that had made a noticeable change in the world in some fashion. 
* 2012–13 — &quot;Line in The Sand: Dilemmas that Define Us&quot;: Moral dilemmas. 
* 2013–14 — &quot;Project Money&quot;: Money and related financial issues.
* 2014–15 — &quot;By Design&quot;: Design issues such as industrial design and social design.
* 2015–16 — &quot;Ripple Effect&quot;: Stories of consequences of various decisions and technologies, intended or otherwise.
* 2016–17 — &quot;The Disruptors&quot;: Stories of people, ideas and things that are disrupting today&#x27;s society, both negatively and positively.
* 2017–18 — &quot;Adaptation&quot;: Stories of people adapting to changing realities in the world.

During the network&#x27;s summer schedule when &quot;The Current&quot; was shortened to an hour, selections of these features were rerun as a separate half-hour program. In 2018, &quot;The Current&quot; ran at the regular length year-round with segments over the regular season rerun during the summer period in addition to new stories. However, in 2019, a compromise in the format was reached with the series running CBC Radio One&#x27;s original documentary podcasts for the summer, having new content for the first portion of the show and taking advantage of the remaining hour&#x27;s time to accommodate the podcasts&#x27; irregular length. In the 2021–22 season, there was a less formal revisiting of the &quot;Work in Progress&quot; theme regarding employment, especially concerning the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with selected interviews occasionally rerun during the summer months in addition to the podcasts.

==Humour==
Although primarily a serious news program, &quot;The Current&quot; from 2003 to 2012 began each show with a brief satirical commentary by a character credited only as The Voice. The role was performed by actor Stephen Hart.

The Voice also announced fictional advertisements for the &quot;Ambiguous Party&quot;, a fictional political party. A few campaign ads were created and aired for morning show listeners&#x27; amusement in which The Voice tried to persuade listeners to vote for the Ambiguous Party. Comparisons are made between the Ambiguous Party (complete and utter fence-sitters on all issues) and the current parties of the day.

On June 20, 2019, Hart returned for a guest appearance to pay tribute to Anna Maria Tremonti on her last regular appearance as the show&#x27;s host.

==Repeat airings==
An abbreviated edition of each day&#x27;s program is repeated at 10 p.m. under the title &quot;The Current Review&quot;. Prior to 2008, &quot;The Review&quot; aired a single feature from &quot;The Current&quot;, alongside one from &quot;Sounds Like Canada&quot;, under the title &quot;Nighttime Review&quot;.

The program is also currently repeated at 3 a.m. as part of the &quot;CBC Radio Overnight&quot; schedule. Although the overnight airing uses the same abbreviated edit as the previous evening&#x27;s &quot;The Current Review&quot;, it is titled as &quot;The Current&quot;.

<doc id="440604" wikidata="Q7404" url="?curid=440604" title="Emperor Gong of Jin">
<text>Emperor Gong of Jin (; 386 – October or November 421), personal name Sima Dewen (), was the last emperor of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (266–420) in China. He became emperor in January 419 after his developmentally disabled brother Emperor An was killed by the regent Liu Yu, and during his brief reign, actual power was in Liu Yu&#x27;s hands. On 7 July 420, under pressure from Liu Yu, he yielded the throne to Liu Yu, ending Jin&#x27;s existence. Liu Yu founded the Liu Song dynasty, and in October or November 421, believing that the former Jin emperor posed a threat to his rule, had him asphyxiated with a blanket.

==Early life==
Sima Dewen was the second son of Emperor Xiaowu of Jin and his concubine Consort Chen Guinü in 386, born four years after Consort Chen had given birth to their oldest son, Sima Dezong. Contrary to his older brother who was described as so developmentally disabled that he was unable to speak, clothe himself, or express whether he was hungry or full, Sima Dewen was described as an intelligent child. From childhood, he became accustomed to care for his brother, especially after their mother&#x27;s death in 390. Their father did not have any other sons. Despite Sima Dezong&#x27;s severe up developmental disability, he was made crown prince in 387 at the age of five by Emperor Xiaowu. On 27 Dec 392, Emperor Xiaowu bestowed upon Sima Dewen the title of &quot;Prince of Langye&quot; – the second most prestigious title for a prince after &quot;Crown Prince&quot;. In 396, Emperor Xiaowu was strangled by his favorite concubine Honoured Lady Zhang after making an offensive remark about her age, and in 397 Sima Dezong succeeded the throne as Emperor An of Jin. Sima Dewen continued to care for his brother after his ascension to the throne.

==During Emperor An&#x27;s reign==
Sometime during Emperor An&#x27;s reign, Sima Dewen married his wife, Chu Lingyuan, who was from an aristocratic family. She had two daughters, Sima Maoying, later created the Princess Haiyan, and the later Princess Fuyang.

Throughout Emperor An&#x27;s early reign, Sima Dewen received increasingly honorific offices, but had little actual power, as the power was initially in the hands of his uncle, the regent Sima Daozi the Prince of Kuaiji, and later in the hands of Sima Daozi&#x27;s son Sima Yuanxian. The situation continued after Sima Yuanxian was overthrown by the warlord Huan Xuan in 402.

In 403, Huan Xuan forced Emperor An to yield the throne to him, temporarily ending Jin. Huan Xuan established a new state of Chu, and he created Emperor An the Prince of Pinggu (平固王) and Sima Dewen the Duke of Shiyang (石阳县公), but kept them close to him to watch them. In 404, however, a rebellion by the general Liu Yu quickly led to Huan Xuan&#x27;s destruction and Emperor An&#x27;s restoration. When, however, later that year Emperor An and Sima Dewen fell into the hands of Huan Xuan&#x27;s nephew Huan Zhen (), Huan Zhen considered executing Emperor An to avenge Huan Xuan&#x27;s young son Huan Sheng (), who was killed by the rebels. It took great pleading on Sima Dewen&#x27;s part, explaining that neither he nor Emperor An had had anything to do with Huan Sheng&#x27;s death, for Huan Zhen to spare Emperor An. In early 405, Huan Zhen was defeated, and Emperor An and Sima Dewen returned to the capital Jiankang, but by this point power was in Liu Yu&#x27;s hands, albeit in a power-sharing agreement with a number of allies whom he had had to recruit in his campaign against Huan Xuan.

As the years went by, Liu Yu gradually concentrated more and more power in his hands, destroying rivals including Liu Yi (), Zhuge Zhangmin (), and Sima Xiuzhi (), while greatly showing his strength in campaigns destroying rival states Southern Yan, Western Shu, and Later Qin. Sima Dewen continued to be largely ceremonially honored but actually powerless during this period. In 416, during Liu Yu&#x27;s campaign against Later Qin, Sima Dewen asked to undertake a mission in Luoyang, recently captured from Later Qin, to try to restore the imperial tombs of the early Jin emperors, but it is not known what came of the mission. He returned to Jiankang in 418 after Liu Yu destroyed Later Qin.

Late that year, Liu Yu, intending to seize the throne and believing a prophecy stating, &quot;There will be two more emperors after Changming&quot; (&quot;Changming&quot;, which meant &quot;dawn,&quot; was the courtesy name of Emperor Xiaowu), became intent on killing Emperor An and replacing him with Sima Dewen. However, because Sima Dewen continuously attended to his brother, assassins whom Liu Yu sent to poison Emperor An did not have the opportunity to do so. However, around the new year 419, Sima Dewen was ill and had to be at his own house, and Liu Yu&#x27;s assassin Wang Shaozhi () took the opportunity to kill Emperor An. Liu Yu then declared Sima Dewen emperor, as Emperor Gong.

==Reign==
Emperor Gong&#x27;s reign was a brief and powerless one. He created his wife Princess Chu empress in spring 419. He also promoted Liu Yu, then carrying the title Duke of Song, to the Prince of Song, which Liu Yu initially declined but accepted in fall 419. In spring 420, Liu Yu, then at Shouyang sent his assistant Fu Liang to Jiankang to pressure Emperor Gong to yield the throne. Emperor Gong responded by summoning Liu Yu back to the capital in summer 419, and Fu then offered him a draft of an abdication edict, requesting that he write it personally. Sima Dewen did so, and then left the palace and went to his old house while he was Prince of Langya. Three days later, Liu Yu took the throne and established the Liu Song dynasty, ending Jin.

==After abdication==
Liu Yu created Sima Dewen the Prince of Lingling and built a palace for him near Jiankang. He had the general Liu Zunkao (), a distant cousin, lead a group of guards, ostensibly to protect the prince but instead to keep him under watch.

Soon, Liu Yu, still believing Sima Dewen to be a threat, sent Sima Dewen&#x27;s former attendant Zhang Wei () a bottle of poisoned wine, ordering him to poison Sima Dewen. Zhang, not wanting to carry out the order, drank the wine himself and died. Meanwhile, however, in order to prevent any likelihood that Sima Dewen would have a male heir, Liu Yu ordered Princess Chu&#x27;s brothers Chu Xiuzhi () and Chu Danzhi () to poison any male children whom Princess Chu or Sima Dewen&#x27;s concubines would bear. Sima Dewen himself feared death greatly, and he and Princess Chu remained in the same house, cooking their own meals, with Princess Chu paying for the material herself. Assassins whom Liu Yu sent initially could find no chance to kill the former emperor.

In fall 421, Liu Yu sent Chu Danzhi and his brother Chu Yuzhi () to visit their sister. As Princess Chu came out to meet her brothers in a different house, soldiers sent by Liu Yu intruded into Sima Dewen&#x27;s house and ordered him to take poison. He refused, stating that Buddhist doctrines prohibit suicide and that those who commit suicide could not be reborn as humans in their next lives. The assassins therefore used a blanket to cover his head and asphyxiated him. He was buried with imperial honors.

As for the title of &quot;Prince of Lingling&quot;, it remained in the Sima clan until it was abolished by Emperor Wu of Liang in April 502, when he ascended the throne. The last known Prince of Lingling was Sima Yaoshi (司马药师), who died on 30 March 490.

<text>Adriaen Courtsen Block (c. 1567 – 27 April 1627) was a Dutch private trader, privateer, and ship&#x27;s captain who is best known for exploring the coastal and river valley areas between present-day New Jersey and Massachusetts during four voyages from 1611 to 1614, following the 1609 expedition by Henry Hudson. He is noted for possibly having named Block Island, Rhode Island, and establishing early trade with the Native Americans, and for the 1614 map of his last voyage on which many features of the mid-Atlantic region appear for the first time, and on which the term New Netherland is first applied to the region. He is credited with being the first European to enter Long Island Sound and the Connecticut River, and to determine that Manhattan and Long Island are islands.

==Early life==
Though spending much of his time at sea, Block called Amsterdam his home. There, on 26 October 1603, he married Neeltje Hendricks van Gelder, with whom he would have five or possibly six children between 1607 and 1615. In 1606 they moved into a house called &quot;De Twee Bontecraijen&quot; (&quot;The Two Hooded Crows&quot;) on Amsterdam&#x27;s Oude Waal street, where his family would live for the remainder of Block&#x27;s life.

In the 1590s, Block already was active in the shipping trade, transporting wood from Northern Europe to deforested Spain. He is for example mentioned delivering Norwegian timber in April 1596 in Bilbao. From there he headed for Ribadeo to buy goods for Cádiz. In April 1601, he was part of a convoy of ships leaving Amsterdam for the Dutch East Indies, at that time probably as far as the Moluccas, returning home in 1603.

In the spring of 1604, after delivering goods in Liguria, Block sailed on to Cyprus buying cargo (rice, cotton, nuts, etc.) he hoped to sell in Venice. This trade fell through, and he headed home to Amsterdam. Passing Lisbon, he came upon a Lübeck-based ship returning from a trip to Brazil. He had written permission from Dutch authorities to capture enemy ships, which he put to use as a privateer, taking the ship and its load to Amsterdam. Though the ship and some of its goods were returned to its owners, Block made a lot of money, with which he probably bought the house on the Oude Waal.

==Block&#x27;s new world expeditions==
===Early voyages (1611–1612)===
Following Hudson&#x27;s contact with the Native Americans in the Hudson Valley in 1609, the Dutch merchants in Amsterdam had deemed the area worth exploring as a potential source of trade for beaver pelts, which were a lucrative market in Europe at the time.

Cornelis Rijser successfully returned in the &quot;St. Pieter&quot; in 1611, and Block and his fellow captain Hendrick Christiaensen returned the next year in 1612, bringing back furs and two sons of a native sachem in the &quot;Fortuyn&quot; and another ship outfitted by a group of Lutheran merchants. It took about ten weeks to sail to New Netherland, sometimes longer. The prospect of successful fur trade prompted the States General, the governing body of the Dutch Republic, to issue a statement on 27 March 1614, stipulating that the discoverers of new countries, harbors, and passages would be given an exclusive patent good for four voyages undertaken within three years to the territories discovered if the applicant should submit a detailed report within 14 days after his return.

===The 1614 expedition===
In 1613, Block made a fourth voyage to the lower Hudson in the &quot;Tyger&quot; accompanied by several other ships especially equipped for trading. While moored along southern Manhattan, the &quot;Tyger&quot; was accidentally destroyed by fire. Over the winter, he and his men, with help from the Lenape (La-Na-Pae), built the ship 16-ton &quot;Onrust&quot; (Dutch for &quot;Restless&quot;).

In this later ship, he explored the East River and was the first known European to navigate the &quot;Hellegat&quot; (now called Hell Gate) and to enter Long Island Sound. Traveling along the Sound, he entered the Housatonic River (which he named &quot;River of Red Hills&quot;) and the Connecticut River, which he explored at least as far as the site of present-day Hartford, today&#x27;s capital of the state of Connecticut, some sixty miles up the river. Leaving Long Island Sound, he charted Block Island, which is named for him and Narragansett Bay, where he possibly named &quot;Roode Eylandt&quot; after the red (Dutch &quot;rood&quot;) color of its soil. On Cape Cod, he rendezvoused with one of the other ships of the expedition and left the &quot;Onrust&quot; behind before returning to Europe.

===Life in the colony===
Block&#x27;s exploration would lead to the eventual colonization of Connecticut. The life was hard, as it was settled in the winter as a result of the Connecticut River turning to ice. Block sailed upstream and established the Dutch base that later became Hartford.

He is credited with naming Fishers Island (Vischer&#x27;s Island) after a shipmate. Though it lies physically closer to Connecticut than New York, the island is a part of Long Island&#x27;s Suffolk County.

===New Netherland company===
Upon returning, Block compiled a map of his voyage together with known information of the time. The Block map was the first to apply the name &quot;New Netherland&quot; to the area between English Virginia and French Canada, as well as the first to show Long Island as an island.

On 11 October 1614 Block, together with Christiaensen and a group of twelve other merchants, presented to the States General a petition to receive exclusive trading privileges for the area. Their company, the newly formed New Netherland Company, was granted exclusive rights for three years to trade between the 40th parallel north and the 45th parallel north.

=== Final voyages and death ===
After his return to Amsterdam in July 1614, he would not return to the New World again. In 1615, Block was Commissary-General of three men-of-war and eleven whaleships sent to Spitsbergen by the Noordsche Compagnie. 

He remained sailing until his death in 1627. He was buried that year on April 27 in Amsterdam&#x27;s Oude Kerk in a grave next to his wife, who had predeceased him two years earlier.

==Legacy==
A multimillion-dollar redevelopment on the Connecticut River in Hartford, Connecticut is named &quot;Adriaen&#x27;s Landing&quot; after Block.
Adriaen Block has a middle school in Flushing, Queens (NYC) named after him, as is Block Island, off the southern coast of Rhode Island.

<doc id="440635" wikidata="Q2607536" url="?curid=440635" title="Liza Dalby">
<text>Liza Crihfield Dalby (born 1950) is an American anthropologist and novelist specializing in Japanese culture. For her graduate studies, Dalby studied and performed fieldwork in Japan of the geisha community of Ponto-chō, which she wrote about in her Ph.D. dissertation, entitled &quot;The institution of the geisha in modern Japanese society&quot;. Since that time, she has written five books. Her first book, &quot;Geisha&quot;, was based on her early research. The next book, &quot;Kimono: Fashioning Culture&quot; is about traditional Japanese clothing and the history of the kimono. This was followed with a fictional account of the Heian era noblewoman Murasaki Shikibu, titled &quot;The Tale of Murasaki&quot;. In 2007 she wrote a memoir, &quot;East Wind Melts the Ice&quot;, which was followed two years later by a second work of fiction, &quot;Hidden Buddhas&quot;.

Dalby is considered an expert in the study of the Japanese geisha community, and acted as consultant to novelist Arthur Golden and filmmaker Rob Marshall for the novel &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; and the film of the same name.

== Background ==
As a high school student, Dalby visited Japan in a student exchange program; there she learned to play the , the traditional three stringed Japanese guitar. In 1975, she returned to Japan for a year to research the geisha community, as part of her anthropology fieldwork. Dalby&#x27;s research, done as part of her Ph.D studies at Stanford University, was presented in her dissertation, and became the basis for her first book, &quot;Geisha&quot;, about the culture of the geisha community. Her study, which included interviews with more than 100 geisha, was considered to be excellent and received praise from scholars at the time of publication, although some retrospective scholarship is more critical.

During her Ph.D. studies about the geisha community, conducted first in Tokyo and then Ponto-chō in Kyoto, she was invited to join a geisha house in Kyoto, after her primary contact in the city, a former geisha who had gone by the name of Ichiraku in her working days, suggested it. As such, Dalby began attending banquets under the name Ichigiku, with another geisha, Ichiume, acting as her ceremonial &quot;older sister&quot;.

Though Dalby was fluent in Japanese and skilled at playing the , she performed at geisha parties and banquets, collectively referred to as , in an unofficial capacity, having never undergone the rites of debuting as a geisha due to the temporary nature of her stay in Japan. As such, she was not paid for her performances, though guests and various geisha &quot;mothers&quot; within the community would not uncommonly give her a tip for her time. Though Dalby&#x27;s experience of geisha society was conducted for academic purposes, Dalby formed strong friendships and relationships with geisha in both Kyoto and Tokyo, and came to be regarded as talented in the skills required to be a geisha:

On my last visit [to the Yamabuki in Yoshichō, Tokyo]...the proprietress [of the house] felt she had to say something. &quot;When we first met, Kikuko, you were so studious—all those serious questions that we had to try and answer. You&#x27;ve really changed a lot... I&#x27;d say your training in Pontochō has taken very well. What a waste to go back to your country now, when you could be such a wonderful geisha!&quot;

==Works==
===&quot;Geisha&quot;===
Dalby&#x27;s first non fiction book, &quot;Geisha&quot; (filmed as &quot;American Geisha&quot;), is based on her experiences in Japan&#x27;s various geisha communities, specifically within the district of Pontochō in Kyoto. In the book, Dalby writes of her experiences in both the contemporary geisha communities of the mid 1970s and the experiences of geisha in previous decades, emphasising a number of changes in the community and the profession of geisha stemming from WWII, changes in the economy and the changing status of women in wider Japanese society, amongst other issues. Dalby writes about the tightly knit geisha community, and the lives of the geisha within its hierarchical society of female artists, cutting between vignettes from her experiences in the geisha community and wider explanations of the many facets of geisha in Japanese society.

===&quot;Kimono&quot;===
&quot;Geisha&quot; was followed by a book about kimono, entitled &quot;Kimono: Fashioning Culture&quot;; &quot;Fashioning Culture&quot; leading on from the last chapter of &quot;Geisha&quot;, which briefly covers kimono in the context of geisha. In an interview with &quot;Salon.com&quot;, Dalby explained that in 11th century Japanese court literature, female authors such as Murasaki Shikibu wrote lengthy descriptions of the clothing people wore, with outright descriptions of people&#x27;s faces or names considered highly rude and almost non-existent in Heian period literature; as such, definitions of beauty and high fashion of the time period centred around the symbolism represented in the layering of clothing and its interaction with the depiction of nature and the seasons in Heian period art and literature. The fine interaction between clothing and art was often described in texts such as Murasaki&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. In the book, Dalby presents essays about the social symbolism of the kimono, as well as its development over a period of several centuries, beginning in early 7th and 8th century Japan, through to the present status of the kimono in post WWII Japan, and the reasons behind wearing the kimono in a modern society where the kimono is no longer the predominant item of clothing.

===&quot;The Tale of Murasaki&quot;===
Dalby&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Murasaki&quot;, a fictional biography of Murasaki Shikibu, 11th century court poet, whose work &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; is considered a classic, was published in 2000. Dalby stated her decision to write a fictional account of Murasaki&#x27;s life was driven by the fact that she &quot;couldn&#x27;t contribute anything scholarly&quot;. Fascinated by an 11th century Heian period court culture oriented for the most part around poetic art and literature reflecting the natural world, Dalby wove much of it into the book, writing about the clothing the women wore; the love affairs they had; the manner in which poetry was frequently exchanged; and the seclusion of women within the Heian period court, where they were often seen by men behind screens, their faces unseen by lovers. Dalby explains that the geisha society did not develop until at least 500 years later, and that a lady-in-waiting such as Murasaki would not have had the temperament to become a geisha, due to the reserved nature expected of court women at the time.

===&quot;East Wind Melts the Ice&quot;===
Dalby followed &quot;The Tale of Murasaki&quot; with her memoir, entitled &quot;East Wind Melts the Ice: A Memoir Through the Seasons&quot;, published in 2007. In the book, Dalby follows a system of time and the seasons derived in ancient China, wherein a year is divided into 72 five day periods. The memoir consists of 72 vignettes, titled as chapters in lowercase letters, such as &quot;chrysanthemums are tinged yellow&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; praised &quot;East Wind Melts the Ice&quot;, calling Dalby&#x27;s writing style &quot;eccentric&quot;, presenting unusual yet interesting material, weaving together experiences from Japan, China and northern California to create a &quot;wealth of information&quot;. Dalby received praise from &quot;Booklist&quot; for the manner in which she uses a stream of consciousness style of writing, to create a work in which the Eastern concept of time is contrasted with the Western; her ability to see with an anthropologist&#x27;s eye and yet to bring an imaginative and creative view to the book; and, in particular, to bring together the various places she has lived, from Kyoto, where she lived as the first Western woman to unofficially become a geisha in the 1970s, to northern California, where she currently lives.

===&quot;Hidden Buddhas&quot;===
Dalby&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Hidden Buddhas: A Novel of Karma and Chaos&quot;, was published in 2009, in which she returns to writing fiction. In this book, set in modern day Japan, Paris, and California, she writes a story set against the backdrop of the concept of (secret Buddha statues) in Japanese Buddhist temples.

<doc id="440638" wikidata="Q1109077" url="?curid=440638" title="Emm Gryner">
<text>Emm Gryner (born in Sarnia, Ontario) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, recording artist, and author. She has released 20 albums as a solo performer, and has collaborated with artists including David Bowie and Chris Hadfield.

== Early life ==
Gryner&#x27;s childhood was spent in Forest, Ontario. Her father was of half Irish heritage and her mother was Filipina. She started to learn piano at age 4, picked up bass around age 14, and later took up guitar as well.

Gryner attended North Lambton Secondary School in Forest, Ontario. Following high school, she graduated from Fanshawe College&#x27;s Music Industry Arts program in 1995.

Gryner has two brothers, Tony and record producer and musician Frank.

== Career ==
Gryner started her music career in Toronto, where her original song &quot;Wisdom Bus&quot; won a nationwide songwriting contest sponsored by Standard Broadcasting. With the prize money, she recorded an album called &quot;The Original Leap Year&quot; and released it on her own Dead Daisy Records. The album attracted the attention of Mercury Records, who signed Gryner to a recording contract.

Gryner&#x27;s first release on Mercury was 1998&#x27;s &quot;Public&quot;, a Britpop-inspired album that yielded a Canadian hit called &quot;Summerlong&quot;. She was nominated for the Best New Solo Artist Juno Award in 1999.

=== Bowie Band ===

Also in 1999, Gryner was asked to join David Bowie&#x27;s band as a backup singer and keyboard player. The gig saw Gryner performing with Bowie at Glastonbury Festival, on &quot;Later with Jools Holland&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and other venues around America and Europe. She appears on the live albums &quot;Glastonbury 2000&quot; and &quot;Bowie at the Beeb&quot;, as well as &quot;Toy&quot;.

=== Solo career ===
After Universal Music took over Mercury Records, Gryner returned to her Dead Daisy Records label, releasing several albums, including &quot;Girl Versions&quot; and &quot;Asianblue&quot;, which were both nominated for Pop Album of the Year at the Juno Awards.

Gryner released &quot;Songs of Love and Death&quot;, an album of cover versions of Irish songs, in 2005. The album attracted the attention of Irish media, and Gryner appeared on programs like The Late Late Show during her subsequent tour of Ireland.

Between 2006 and 2020, Gryner released 11 albums, four EPs, and a &quot;best of&quot; compilation with two unreleased tracks. &quot;The Summer of High Hopes&quot;, produced by Nathan Larson, was released in Canada and later in Ireland on the heels of a performance at Oxegen Festival; The Irish Times&#x27; Siobhàn Long said it was &quot;the distilled voice of an original&quot;. In the November 2006 issue of &quot;Q&quot;, U2 frontman Bono recognized the track &quot;Almighty Love&quot; as one of six songs that he wished he had written from the last twenty years of music.

Her 2014 album &quot;Torrential&quot; was called &quot;superb pop&quot; by The Irish Times&#x27; Tony Clayton-Lea.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Gryner released the singles &quot;Stronger Someone&quot;, in support of Bluewater Health Foundation, and &quot;All Love All The Time&quot; with Rob Wells, as well as the album &quot;Just For You&quot;, a collection of jazz standards.

=== Space Oddity in space ===

In May 2013, Gryner arranged and performed piano on astronaut Chris Hadfield&#x27;s cover version of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Space Oddity&quot;. The music video for the song features Hadfield on the International Space Station and is considered the first ever filmed in space.

Fanshawe College presents an annual Emm Gryner and Chris Hadfield Music Industry Arts Award to a Year 2 student in the School of Contemporary Media who demonstrates &quot;a keen interest [...] in the creative and technical aspects of the music industry [and] leadership characteristics with respect to his or her classmates, faculty and staff, as well as exceptional creativity and dedication&quot;.

=== Other collaborations ===

Gryner collaborated with Larson in the band Hot One and appeared on the group&#x27;s self-titled album in 2006.

She is also a member of the collective The Cake Sale, along with Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol, Bell X1, Josh Ritter and Glen Hansard. The collective is featured on &quot;The Cake Sale&quot;, a multi-platinum-selling Irish album with proceeds to Oxfam&#x27;s Make Trade Fair.

In 2011, Gryner formed Trent Severn with Dayna Manning and Laura C. Bates. Their debut self-titled album was released on Gryner&#x27;s Dead Daisy Records label in 2012, followed by Trillium (2015) and Portage (2017).

In 2014, Gryner assembled the band Trapper with Sean Kelly (on guitar), brother Frank Gryner (on guitar), Jordan Kern (on bass) and Tim Timleck (ex-Universal Honey on drums), playing &quot;1980s-style melodic hard rock.&quot; In May 2015, Trapper opened for Brit-rockers Def Leppard on three Canadian tour dates in Montréal, Ottawa and London, Ontario. Gryner had met and become friends with Def Leppard lead singer Joe Elliott when she toured as a backing singer with David Bowie.

Gryner performs her ballad-style cover of Def Leppard&#x27;s &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot;, arranged for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra by Eric Gorfain, with the band on their album Drastic Symphonies. She also appeared with Def Leppard and the BBC Concert Orchestra on BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Piano Room&quot; in support of the album, performing &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me&quot;, &quot;Hysteria&quot;, and Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Life On Mars&quot;.

=== Other work ===
In 2005, Gryner was featured as a fallen angel in the video for Daniel Victor&#x27;s &quot;The Grace&quot; of album &quot;Act I:A Goodbye Friends of the Heavenly Bodies&quot;, reaching #1 on Much Music and International modern rock radio charts, becoming the sixth most-played song on Canadian Rock Radio charts and certified Gold in 2006. 

In 2008 Gryner acted and sang in &quot;One Week&quot;, a film by director Michael McGowan. In the film she sings Un Canadien errant; she also contributed her song &quot;Blackwinged Bird&quot; to the soundtrack.

In the summers of 2007 and 2008, Gryner and Danny Michel co-hosted &quot;Under the Covers&quot;, a radio show about cover songs, on CBC Radio One.

In October 2016 Gryner starred in &quot;Joni Mitchell: River&quot; at the Grand Theatre in London, Ontario along with Louise Pitre and Brendan Wall. The play and performers met with positive reviews: in the London Free Press Joe Belanger commented that &quot;her vocal range, the emotional qualities of her voice and its sound [are] like a touchstone to Mitchell throughout,&quot; and Mary Alderson wrote that &quot;she is stunning in her a capella numbers&quot;.

In September 2021 ECW Press released Gryner&#x27;s book &quot;The Healing Power of Singing: Raise Your Voice, Change Your Life (What Touring with David Bowie, Single Parenting and Ditching the Music Business Taught Me in 25 Easy Steps)&quot;, described as &quot;part study in the art of singing, part guide to finding one&#x27;s voice, and part memoir.&quot; The book became an Amazon bestseller in 2022.

=== Dead Daisy Records ===

Gryner&#x27;s label, Dead Daisy Records, also released the debut records for Atlantic Canadian indie band In-Flight Safety, Daniel Ledwell, Andrew Spice, Cicero, and Toronto songwriter Royal Wood.

<text>The Territory of New Mexico was an organized incorporated territory of the United States from September 9, 1850, until January 6, 1912. It was created from the U.S. provisional government of New Mexico, as a result of &quot;Nuevo México&quot; becoming part of the American frontier after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. It existed with varying boundaries until the territory was admitted to the Union as the U.S. state of New Mexico in 1912. This jurisdiction was an organized, incorporated territory of the US for nearly 62 years, the longest period of any territory in the contiguous United States.

==Before the territory was organized==


In 1846, during the Mexican–American War, the United States established a provisional government of New Mexico. Territorial boundaries were somewhat ambiguous. After the Mexican Republic formally ceded the region to the United States in 1848, this temporary wartime/military government operated until September 9, 1850.

Earlier in 1850, organizers proposing New Mexico for statehood had drafted a state constitution that prohibited slavery. The request was approved at the same time that the Utah Territory was created to the north. The proposed state boundaries were to extend as far east as the 100th meridian West and as far north as the Arkansas River, thus encompassing the present-day Texas and Oklahoma panhandles and parts of present-day Kansas, Colorado, Utah, and Arizona, as well as most of present-day New Mexico. The state of Texas (admitted to the US in 1845) strongly criticized this plan, as it claimed much of the same territory, although it did not control these lands. In addition, slaveholders worried about not being able to expand slavery to the west of their current slave states.

==Compromise of 1850 and disputes over slavery==


The Compromise of 1850 put an end to the push for immediate New Mexico statehood. Approved by the United States Congress in September 1850, the legislation provided for the establishment of New Mexico Territory and Utah Territory. It also defined the disputed western boundary of Texas.

During the territorial period, the status of slavery provoked considerable debate. Congress was sharply divided on the slavery issue, with Southern representatives determined to protect their options for expansion of slavery in the West. Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois and others maintained that the territory could not restrict slavery, as under the earlier Missouri Compromise. Others, including Abraham Lincoln, insisted that older Mexican Republic legal traditions of the territory, which abolished black slavery in 1834, took precedence and should be continued. (Indian slavery had been abolished in Spanish colonies in 1769.) Regardless of the official status, slavery was rare in antebellum New Mexico. Black slaves never numbered more than about a dozen.

As one of the final attempts at compromise to avoid the Civil War, in December 1860, a U.S. House of Representatives committee proposed to admit New Mexico as a slave state immediately. Although the measure was approved by the committee on December 29, 1860, Southern representatives did not take up this offer. Many had already left Congress due to the imminent declarations of secession by their states.

On February 24, 1863, during the Civil War, Congress passed the &quot;Arizona Organic Act&quot;, which split off the western portion of the 12-year-old New Mexico Territory, establishing the new Arizona Territory, where it abolished slavery. As in New Mexico, slavery was already extremely limited, due to earlier Mexican traditions, laws, and patterns of settlement. The northwestern corner of New Mexico Territory was included in Arizona Territory until it was added to the southernmost part of the newly admitted State of Nevada in 1864. Eventually, Arizona Territory was admitted in 1912 as the State of Arizona.

==Territorial evolution==

The Purchase treaty defined the new border as &quot;up the middle of that river (the Rio Grande) to the point where the parallel of 31° 47&#x27; north latitude crosses the same ; thence due west one hundred miles; thence south to the parallel of 31° 20&#x27; north latitude; thence along the said parallel of 31° 20&#x27; to the 111th meridian of longitude west of Greenwich ; thence in a straight line to a point on the Colorado River twenty English miles below the junction of the Gila and Colorado rivers; thence up the middle of the said river Colorado until it intersects the present line between the United States and Mexico.&quot; The new border included a few miles of the Colorado River at the western end; the remaining land portion consisted of line segments between points, including at the Colorado River, west of Nogales at , near AZ-NM-Mexico tripoint at , the eastern corners of NM southern bootheel (Hidalgo County) at , and the west bank of Rio Grande at .

The boundaries of the New Mexico Territory at the time of establishment (September 9, 1850) contained most of the present-day State of New Mexico, more than half of the present-day State of Arizona, and portions of the present-day states of Colorado and Nevada. Although this area was smaller than what had been included in the failed statehood proposal of early 1850, the boundary disputes with Texas had been dispelled by the Compromise of 1850.

The Gadsden Purchase was acquired by the United States from Mexico in 1853/1854 (known as the &quot;Venta de La Mesilla&quot; or the &quot;Sale of La Mesilla&quot;), arranged by the then-American ambassador to Mexico, James Gadsden. This added today&#x27;s southern strip of Arizona and a smaller area in today&#x27;s southwestern New Mexico to the New Mexico Territory, bringing its land area to the maximum size achieved in its history as an organized territory. The land of provided a more easily constructed route for a future southern transcontinental railroad line (second of the routes) for the future Southern Pacific Railroad, constructed later in 1881/1883.

The Colorado Territory was established by the &quot;Colorado Organic Act&quot; on February 28, 1861, with the same boundaries that would ultimately constitute the State of Colorado. This Act removed the Colorado lands from the New Mexico Territory.

The creation of the Union Arizona Territory (two years after the ill-fated Confederate Arizona Territory) by the &quot;Arizona Organic Act&quot; on February 24, 1863, removed all the land west of the 109th meridian from the New Mexico Territory, i.e. the entire present-day State of Arizona plus the land that would become the southern part of the State of Nevada in 1864. This Act left the New Mexico Territory with boundaries identical to the eventual State of New Mexico for a half-century until admitted to the Union in 1912 as the 47th state (followed just under six weeks later by the Arizona Territory/State of Arizona, which became the 48th state, finally filling out the coast-to-coast continental expanse of the United States).

In 1850, all 73 churches with regular services in the New Mexico Territory were Catholic. In the 1910 United States census, 26 counties in the New Mexico Territory reported the following population counts (after 7 reported the following counts in the 1850 United States census):
==American Civil War==
As the route to California, New Mexico Territory was disputed territory during the American Civil War. Settlers in the southern part of the Territory willingly joined the Confederate States in 1861 as the newly organized Confederate Territory of Arizona, with a representative delegate to the Confederate Congress in the capital of Richmond. This territory consisted of the southern half of the earlier Federal New Mexico Territory of 1851 and was in contrast to the later Federal Arizona Territory established by the Union in 1863, which was the western half split off from the original U.S. New Mexico Territory. The short-lived Confederate Arizona Territory was the first American territorial entity to be called &quot;Arizona&quot;.

The Battle of Glorieta Pass in May 1862, following the retreat of Texan Confederate forces back south to El Paso, placed the area of the Rio Grande valley and eastern New Mexico Territory with the capital of Santa Fe under the control of the Federals with their Union Army. However, the government and leadership of Confederate Arizona persisted until the end of the Civil War in June 1865 with the surrender of the Trans-Mississippi Department, living in exile in El Paso, Texas with its delegate still in Richmond.

==Territorial symbols==

A coat of arms of New Mexico was adopted by the territorial legislature in 1887, formalizing an earlier design, introduced in the early 1860s, already used in the territory&#x27;s great seal. The legislation, titled &quot;An Act adopting and establishing the coat of arms and great seal of the territory&quot;, was approved by Governor Edmund G. Ross on February 1:

The coat of arms of the territory of New Mexico shall be the Mexican Eagle grasping a serpent in its beak, the cactus in its talons, shielded by the American eagle with outspread wings, and grasping arrows in its talons. The date MDCCCL [1850], under the eagles, and above that, on a scroll, the motto: . That the great seal of the territory have the coat of arms thereon, being the same seal now used by the secretary of the territory, and that the same be adopted and established as the official seal and coat of arms of the territory of New Mexico.

The &quot;American&quot; bald eagle&#x27;s outstretched wings over the smaller &quot;Mexican&quot; harpy eagle represents the territory&#x27;s change of sovereignty. The territorial motto, , was later added to the seal. The same design was later adapted for use in the seal of the new state of New Mexico in 1913.

<doc id="440643" wikidata="Q2455370" url="?curid=440643" title="Yevsektsiya">
<text>A Yevsektsiya (; ) was the ethnically Jewish section of the Soviet Communist Party and its main institutions. These sections were established in fall of 1918 with consent of Vladimir Lenin to carry Party ideology and Marxist-Leninist atheism to the Soviet Jewish masses. The Yevsektsiya published a Yiddish periodical, der &quot;Emes&quot;. According to Walter Kolarz, the Yevsektsiya inside the League of Militant Godless, &quot;had a total of 40,000 Jewish members in 1929, the year when the anti-religious campaign was at its peak. These &#x27;Jewish sections&#x27; were much despised by the bulk of Russia&#x27;s Jewry. Their members were regarded with as much contempt as the Jewish renegades who turned persecutors of the own brethren in the Middle Ages.&quot;

==Mission==
The Yevsektsiya sought to draw Jewish workers into the revolutionary organisations; chairman Semyon Dimanstein, at the first conference in October 1918, pointed out that, &quot;when the October revolution came, the Jewish workers had remained totally passive ... and a large part of them were even against the revolution. The revolution did not reach the Jewish street. Everything remained as before&quot;.

==History==
The Yevsektsiya remained fairly isolated from both the Jewish intelligentsia and working class. The sections were staffed mostly by Jewish ex-members of the Bund, which eventually joined the Soviet Communist Party as the &quot;Kombund&quot; in 1921, and the United Jewish Socialist Workers Party.

Former elements of the Bund and Faraynigte were historically hostile to Zionism. As they later joined Yevsektsiya, they deemed Russian Zionist organisations to be counter-revolutionary, and critiqued them. Delegates to a Zionist congress in March 1919 complained about administrative harassment of their activities - not from government agencies, but from Jewish communists. At the Yevsektsiya&#x27;s second conference in July 1919, it demanded that the Zionist organizations be dissolved. After an appeal from the Zionists, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee issued a decree in that the Zionist organisation was not counter-revolutionary and its activities should not be disrupted. The campaign continued, however. In 1920, the first All-Russian Zionist Congress was disrupted by members of the Cheka and a female representative of the Yevsektsiya. At its third conference in July 1921, the Yevsektsiya demanded the &quot;total liquidation&quot; of Zionism.

According to Richard Pipes, &quot;in time, every Jewish cultural and social organization came under assault&quot;. The section in Rostov-on-Don persecuted local Jewish leaders, both Zionist and religious, and especially the sixth Chabad rebbe Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn

The Yevsektsiya attempted to use its influence to cut off state funds to Habima Theatre, branding it counter-revolutionary. The theatre left Russia to go on tour in 1926, before settling in Mandatory Palestine in 1928 to become Israel&#x27;s national theatre.

== Dissolution ==
The Yevsektsia were disbanded as no longer needed in 1929. Many leading members were murdered during the Great Purge of the late 1930s, including Chairman Dimanstein. Executed in 1938, he was posthumously rehabilitated in 1955, two years after the death of Joseph Stalin.

<doc id="440644" wikidata="Q1818316" url="?curid=440644" title="List of AMD Opteron processors">
<text>Opteron is a central processing unit (CPU) family within the AMD64 line. Designed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) for the server market, Opteron competed with Intel&#x27;s Xeon. The Opteron family is succeeded by the Zen-based Epyc, and Ryzen Threadripper and Threadripper Pro series.

For Socket 940 and Socket 939 Opterons, each chip has a three-digit model number, in the form &quot;Opteron XYY. For Socket F and Socket AM2 Opterons, each chip has a four-digit model number, in the form &quot;OpteronXZYY. For all Opterons, the first digit (the X) specifies the number of CPUs on the target machine:
* 1 – has 1 processor (uniprocessor)
* 2 – has 2 processors (dual processor)
* 8 – has 4 or 8 processors

For Socket F and Socket AM2 Opterons, the second digit (the Z) represents the processor generation. Presently, only 2 (dual-core), DDR2, 3 (quad-core) and 4 (six-core) are used.

For all Opterons, the last two digits in the model number (the YY) indicate the clock rate (frequency) of a CPU, a higher number indicating a higher clock rate. This speed indication is comparable to processors of the same generation if they have the same amount of cores. Single-cores and dual-cores have different indications, despite sometimes having the same clock rate.

Model number methodology for the AMD Opteron 4000 and 6000 Series processors.
AMD Opteron processors are identified by a four digit model number, ZYXX, where:
Z – denotes product series
* 4000 Series = Low cost and power optimized 1- and 2-way servers
* 6000 Series = High performance 2- and 4-way servers
Y – denotes series generation
* 41xx = 1st generation of 4000 series
* 61xx = 1st generation of 6000 series
XX – communicates a change in product specifications within the series, and is not a relative measure of performance.

The suffix HE or EE denotes a high-efficiency or energy-efficiency model with a lower thermal design power (TDP) than a standard Opteron. The suffix SE denotes a top-of-the-line model with a higher TDP than a standard Opteron.

<text>Oligochaeta () is a subclass of soft-bodied animals in the phylum Annelida, which is made up of many types of aquatic and terrestrial worms, including all of the various earthworms. Specifically, oligochaetes comprise the terrestrial megadrile earthworms (some of which are semiaquatic or fully aquatic), and freshwater or semiterrestrial microdrile forms, including the tubificids, pot worms and ice worms (Enchytraeidae), blackworms (Lumbriculidae) and several interstitial marine worms.

With around 10,000 known species, the Oligochaeta make up about half of the phylum Annelida. These worms usually have few setae (chaetae) or &quot;bristles&quot; on their outer body surfaces, and lack parapodia, unlike polychaeta.

==Diversity==
Oligochaetes are well-segmented worms and most have a spacious body cavity (coelom) used as a hydroskeleton. They range in length from less than up to in the &#x27;giant&#x27; species such as the giant Gippsland earthworm (&quot;Megascolides australis&quot;) and the Mekong worm (&quot;Amynthas mekongianus&quot;).

Terrestrial oligochaetes are commonly known as earthworms and burrow into the soil. The four main families with large numbers of species are Glossoscolecidae, Lumbricidae, Megascolecidae and Moniligastridae. Earthworms are found in all parts of the world except for deserts. They have a requirement for moist surroundings and the larger species create burrows that may go down several metres (yards) while young individuals and smaller species are restricted to the top few centimetres of soil. The largest numbers are found in humus-rich soils and acid soils. A few species are found in trees, among damp moss and in the debris that accumulates in leaf axils and crevices; some others make their homes in the rosettes of bromeliads.

The majority of aquatic oligochaetes are small, slender worms, whose organs can be seen through the transparent body wall. They burrow into the sediment or live among the vegetation mostly in shallow, freshwater environments. Some are transitional between terrestrial and aquatic habitats, inhabiting swamps, mud or the borders of water bodies. About two hundred species are marine, mostly in the families Enchytraeidae and Naididae; these are found largely in the tidal and shallow subtidal zones, but a few are found at abyssal depths.

==Anatomy==
The first segment, or prostomium, of oligochaetes is usually a smooth lobe or cone without sensory organs, although it is sometimes extended to form a tentacle. The remaining segments have no appendages, but they do have a small number of bristles, or chaetae. These tend to be longer in aquatic forms than in the burrowing earthworms, and can have a variety of shapes.

Each segment has four bundles of chaetae, with two on the underside, and the others on the sides. The bundles can contain one to 25 chaetae, and include muscles to pull them in and out of the body. This enables the worm to gain a grip on the soil or mud as it burrows into the substrate. When burrowing, the body moves peristaltically, alternately contracting and stretching to push itself forward.

A number of segments in the forward part of the body are modified by the presence of numerous secretory glands. Together, they form the clitellum, which is important in reproduction.

===Internal anatomy===
Most oligochaetes are detritus feeders, although some genera are predaceous, such as &quot;Agriodrilus&quot; and &quot;Phagodrilus&quot;. The digestive tract is essentially a tube running the length of the body, but has a powerful muscular pharynx immediately behind the mouth cavity. In many species, the pharynx simply helps the worm suck in food, but in many aquatic species, it can be turned inside out and placed over food like a suction cup before being pulled back in.

The remainder of the digestive tract may include a crop for storage of food, and a gizzard for grinding it up, although these are not present in all species. The oesophagus includes &quot;calciferous glands&quot; that maintain calcium balance by excreting indigestible calcium carbonate into the gut. A number of yellowish chloragogen cells surround the intestine and the dorsal blood vessel, forming a tissue that functions in a similar fashion to the vertebrate liver. Some of these cells also float freely in the body cavity, where they are referred to as &quot;eleocytes&quot;.

Most oligochaetes have no gills or similar structures, and simply breathe through their moist skin. The few exceptions generally have simple, filamentous gills. Excretion is through small ducts known as metanephridia. Terrestrial oligochaetes secrete urea, but the aquatic forms typically secrete ammonia, which dissolves rapidly into the water.

The vascular system consists of two main vessels connected by lateral vessels in each segment. Blood is carried forward in the dorsal vessel (in the upper part of the body) and back through the ventral vessel (underneath), before passing into a sinus surrounding the intestine. Some of the smaller vessels are muscular, effectively forming hearts; from one to five pairs of such hearts is typical. The blood of oligochaetes contains haemoglobin in all but the smallest of species, which have no need of respiratory pigments.

The nervous system consists of two ventral nerve cords, which are usually fused into a single structure, and three or four pairs of smaller nerves per body segment. Only a few aquatic oligochaetes have eyes, and even then they are only simply ocelli. Nonetheless, their skin has several individual photoreceptors, allowing the worm to sense the presence of light, and burrow away from it. Oligochaetes can taste their surroundings using chemoreceptors located in tubercles across their body, and their skin is also supplied with numerous free nerve endings that presumably contribute to their sense of touch.

==Distribution and habitat==
Oligochaetes occur in every continent in the world occupying terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats. Of the 1700 known aquatic species, about 600 are marine and 100 inhabit groundwater. Aquatic oligochaetes occur in most groups, with the Naididae being the most speciose.

==Locomotion==
Movement and burrowing of earthworms is performed by peristalsis, with the alternation of contraction and relaxation of the circular and longitudinal muscles. To move forward, the anterior portion of the worm is extended forward by the contraction of the circular muscles, while the portion just behind this is made shorter and fatter by the contraction of longitudinal muscles. Next the anterior circular muscles relax, and a wave of circular contraction moves backwards along the worm. At the same time, the cheatae expand to grip the ground as the body shortens and are retracted as it lengthens. The steps are typically long and the worm moves at the rate of seven to ten steps per minute. The worm is able to reverse its direction of travel with the tail leading. Aquatic species use a similar means of locomotion to work their way through sediment and massed vegetation, but the tiny Aeolosomatids swim by means of the cilia on their prostomia.

Burrowing is performed by forcing the front end of the worm into a crevice and widening the gap by body expansion. Large quantities of soil are swallowed in the process. This is mixed with mucus as it passes through the gut, being used to plaster the tunnel walls, forming a lining. Excess material is extruded on the ground surface, forming a faecal casting. The burrow may have two entrances and several vertical and horizontal tunnels.

==Reproduction==
Whereas in general, polychaetes are marine and have separate sexes, external sperm transfer and external fertilisation, oligochaetes live on land or in fresh water, are hermaphrodites, have no external sperm transfer and fertilisation takes place in the clitellum or cocoon. However there are exceptions to this, with some polychaetes inhabiting non-marine environments and a few species of oligochaetes being marine. Development of the offspring also differs between the two subclasses. The eggs of polychaetes are deposited in the sea where they develop into trochophore larvae that disperse as part of the plankton, while the yolky eggs of oligochaetes do not have a larval stage and develop directly into juvenile worms in the cocoon.

Reproduction among oligochaetes is mainly by sexual means but clonal reproduction is common in some genera, especially among aquatic species. Members of the Naididae reproduce asexually, primarily by paratomy, in which the body breaks into two pieces after the &quot;pregeneration&quot; of certain anterior structures by the posterior portion. Other species undergo fragmentation, in which the worm breaks into several pieces, each of which develops into a new worm. Parthenogenesis also occurs in some species.

==Evolution and taxonomy==
With their soft bodies, earthworms do not fossilize well, though they may form trace fossils. The name &quot;Protoscolex&quot; was given to a genus of segmented worms without bristles found in the Upper Ordovician of Kentucky, United States. Another species placed in the same genus was found in Herefordshire, England, but it is unclear whether these worms are in fact oligochaetes. Stephenson postulated in 1930 that the common ancestor of oligochaetes came from the primitive aquatic family Lumbriculidae. The more advanced families such as Glossoscolecidae, Hormogastridae, Lumbricidae and Microchaetidae may have evolved later than the other families. Because of its ability to colonise new areas and become dominant, the Lumbricidae has followed humans round the world and displaced many native species of earthworm.

An early but now outdated classification system was to divide the oligochaetes into &quot;Megadrili&quot;, the larger terrestrial species, and &quot;Microdili&quot;, the smaller, mostly aquatic ones.

<text>Dead Like Me is an American comedy-drama television series starring Ellen Muth and Mandy Patinkin as grim reapers who reside and work in Seattle, Washington. Filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, the show was created by Bryan Fuller for the Showtime cable network, where it ran for two seasons (2003–04). Fuller left the show five episodes into the first season because of creative differences; creative direction was taken over by executive producers John Masius and Stephen Godchaux. A direct-to-DVD film titled &quot;Dead like Me: Life After Death&quot; was released on February 17, 2009.

Eighteen-year-old Georgia &quot;George&quot; Lass (Ellen Muth) is the show&#x27;s protagonist and narrator. George dies early in the pilot episode and becomes one of the &quot;undead&quot;, a &quot;grim reaper&quot;. George soon learns that a reaper&#x27;s job is to remove the souls of people, preferably just before they die, and escort them until they move on into their afterlife. George&#x27;s death leaves behind her mother (Cynthia Stevenson) and the rest of her family at a point when her relationships with them were on shaky ground.

The show explores the experiences of a small team of such reapers, as well as the changes in George and her family as they deal with George&#x27;s death.

== Series overview ==

=== Introduction ===
The first scene of the pilot episode introduces an origin-of-death myth where at the dawn of time, &quot;god (lower-case g)&quot; was busy with creation and gave Toad a clay jar containing death which Toad promised to guard. Frog begged Toad to let him hold the jar, something to which Toad finally agreed. An excited Frog juggled the jar and finally dropped it, shattering it on the ground. When it broke open, death got out.

===Main plot===

Georgia Lass is aloof and emotionally distant from her family and shies away from her life. After dropping out of college, she takes a temp job through Happy Time Temporary Services. During her lunch break on her first day, she is hit and killed by a toilet seat falling from the deorbiting &quot;Mir&quot; space station. She is soon informed that, rather than moving on to the &quot;great beyond&quot;, she will become a grim reaper in the External Influence Division, collecting souls of people who die in accidents (many of which have a Rube Goldberg-style complexity), and homicides. Each reaper has a secret quota of souls; once the quota is met, the reaper moves on to another realm and the last soul reaped then takes his or her job collecting souls.

In Season 1, George has trouble adjusting to her circumstances – collecting souls while holding down a day job. By Season 2, she has mostly adjusted to her new role, with few unresolved issues with her life and her afterlife.

George&#x27;s family is struggling to deal with her death. Her father, Clancy (Greg Kean), has an affair that affects his marriage to Joy (Cynthia Stevenson). Her sister, Reggie (Britt McKillip), acts out – stealing toilet seats from neighbors and school and hanging them on a tree – until her mother sends her to therapy. Reggie clings to the belief that George visits her, but she is starting to lie to cover this up. At the start of Season 2, the family begins to break apart as Joy and Clancy divorce.

All of the main characters have issues with their life after death, but they cope with it in different ways: Mason (Callum Blue) resorts to alcohol and drugs; Daisy (Laura Harris) puts on a veneer of perkiness; and Roxy (Jasmine Guy) is physically and verbally aggressive. Rube (Mandy Patinkin) and George are more straightforward about their sadness.

=== Bryan Fuller&#x27;s departure ===
Bryan Fuller left early in the first season because of conflicts with MGM Television, including disagreement over major script and storyline cuts considered important to the main theme. He stated that the &quot;lack of professionalism...made it really difficult. It was like being at war. They were constantly trying to strong arm me. It was the worst experience of my life.&quot; According to Fuller, Showtime canceled the show due to &quot;a loss of quality and a sense the problems would continue.&quot; Actress Rebecca Gayheart also departed the show after the series&#x27; fifth episode.

== Characters ==
=== Reapers ===

* Georgia &quot;George&quot; Lass (Ellen Muth): (1985–2003) The show&#x27;s protagonist, an 18-year-old college dropout. In addition to being a grim reaper she has a day job at Happy Time Temporary Services, under the assumed name &quot;Millie Hagen&quot;. She was killed on June 27, 2003, when a toilet seat from the de-orbiting Mir space station fell on her. Because of this, she is known among the reapers as &quot;Toilet Seat Girl&quot;, a fact which earns her instant recognition/respect for dying in such a bizarre way.
* Rube John Sofer (Mandy Patinkin): (1876 – ) The head of the group of reapers. He is responsible for passing out reaping assignments, nearly always on yellow post-it notes. He becomes a father figure for George (whom he calls &quot;Peanut&quot;) in her grim-reaping afterlife, and had a daughter named Rose (&quot;Rosie&quot;), whom he had also called &quot;Peanut&quot;. The manner of his death was not revealed, but in one episode his name and picture are seen on an old &quot;Wanted&quot; poster alleging that he was a bank robber. Because of this, it is believed that he died at the hands of the police (i.e. shoot-out or execution). He looks the same as he did while alive, possibly because his time of death was nearly one hundred years earlier and everyone who could possibly identify him has died, including his daughter Rosie (Rose Anne Sofer, born March 19, 1925; lived at 243 Georgian Lane, Englewood, New Jersey) and his Czechoslovakian wife Lucy Sonia Sofer (née Debrowski), born in 1901.
* Mason (Callum Blue): (1939–1966) A British drug addict, alcoholic and thief, but a likable person. He acts as an &quot;older brother&quot; figure to George, and is attracted to Daisy. He is originally from London, and died in 1966 by drilling a hole in his head to achieve a &quot;permanent high&quot;. He&#x27;s considered the least responsible of &quot;Rube&#x27;s Post-it Crew&quot; and often makes gaffes, cuts his reaps close, or is drunk or high much of the time.
* Roxy Harvey (Jasmine Guy): (before 1960–1982) A strong-willed, sassy, independent woman. Her day job is initially as a meter maid, but she later becomes a police officer. She was strangled to death by a jealous roommate in 1982 with leg warmers, which Roxy had invented. Although she is generally seen as tough and no-nonsense, she has a softer side, shown in &quot;Reapercussions&quot; after saving the life of J. H. Arnold.
* Betty Rhomer (Rebecca Gayheart): (1899–1926) A confident, well-adjusted reaper in the first five episodes. She keeps Polaroids of each of the souls she reaps, in department store shopping bags organized by personality type. She refers to this as her signature, as a way to separate herself from &quot;the whole cloak and sickle thing.&quot; George begins to bond with her early in the first season, but she &quot;hitches a ride&quot; into the afterlife with one of the souls George had reaped and is never seen again. She died in 1926 while cliff-diving with her fiancé. In a similar fashion to the reaping of George, though Rube did not personally reap Betty, he did collect her soul, as shown in the season 1 episode &quot;Reaping Havoc&quot;. (Though she refers later to having been alive in 1927, that is presumably an error in her memory since we are shown her tombstone.)
* Daisy Adair (Laura Harris): (before 1915–1938) A spoiled actress who often tells stories about her (alleged) sexual escapades with classic film stars. She died on December 13, 1938, of asphyxiation/smoke inhalation in Marietta, Georgia, though she originally claimed this occurred on the set of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. Her last thought before she died was, &quot;Why has no one ever loved me?&quot; Daisy is sent from New York City to Seattle in episode six as a replacement when Betty leaves. She is traumatically affected by the violent deaths of defenseless women by abusive men, and although Roxy yelled at her for tampering with a crime scene after such a reap, Daisy then revealed to Mason that she had a sister who (presumably) died that way. At the end of the second season, Daisy begins to acquire a reputation as a &quot;bad luck charm&quot; when Ray accuses her of killing people. When Ray&#x27;s soul is transformed into a graveling, she enigmatically states in that and the next episode that she has &quot;seen it before&quot; and that it&#x27;s &quot;happening again.&quot; Daisy is recognized in the last episode by an elderly man in Der Waffle Haus while she is dressed as a police officer for Halloween; as stated in that episode, on Halloween, all reapers look as they did when alive.

=== George&#x27;s family ===
* Reggie Lass (Britt McKillip): George&#x27;s younger sister. Though George ignored her while she was alive, Reggie is very much affected by the death of her sister. She believes that George&#x27;s ghost still roams about the city and visits their home from time to time – technically, she is right. Due to her eccentric, seemingly pathological way of grieving her sister&#x27;s death, Reggie is placed in psychiatric therapy.
* Joy Lass (Cynthia Stevenson): George&#x27;s mother has a pathological fear of balloons and who hates the word &#x27;moist&#x27; because she thinks &quot;it sounds pornographic&quot;. She likes to have order, rules, and control in her life. Other characters in the show, such as Joy&#x27;s own mother, believe that her obsession with control is how she copes with denial of her own out-of-control life, her daughter George&#x27;s death, her younger daughter&#x27;s rather unconventional style of grieving over George&#x27;s death, and her divorce from her husband. In the episode where her mother comes to visit, however, it becomes clear that Joy&#x27;s problems stem more from the chaotic lifestyle and abandonment issues of her own childhood.
* Clancy Lass (Greg Kean): George&#x27;s father. He is an English Professor at the University of Washington. His relationship with Joy begins to deteriorate seriously after George&#x27;s death. He has an affair with one of his Shakespeare-class students (A.J. Cook), which becomes the final death knell to the marriage. In the Pilot it was suggested, by an overly-long hug, that his affair was with a young man but this homosexual thread was dropped and the student confirmed to be female in later episodes.

=== Happy Time Temporary Services ===
* Delores Herbig, as in, as she says, &quot;her big brown eyes&quot; (Christine Willes): George&#x27;s boss. Delores disliked George, but becomes friends with &quot;Millie&quot;, for whom she becomes something of a maternal figure, offering advice and support, and on one occasion bailing &quot;Millie&quot; out of jail. Delores is optimistic, dynamic, and motivated; she has an active Internet presence through various social and dating sites, and runs a website (her home life on webcam) called &#x27;Getting Things Done With Delores&#x27;. Occasionally, Delores will try to empathize with George by revealing startling facts about her past – including a cocaine habit, tattoos, and &quot;all those restraining orders&quot;. She has a very elderly cat named Murray.
* Crystal Smith (Crystal Dahl): Happy Time&#x27;s mysterious receptionist whose Happy Time record indicates that she speaks several languages and previously served as a special forces operative in Southeast Asia. Crystal once helped the reapers organize into computer files a collection of souls&#x27; last thoughts. She also dressed as a grim reaper for Halloween. She is also seen to steal great amounts of Post-it notes (like those used to notify reapers of their assignments) from Happy Time.

=== Miscellaneous characters ===
* Kiffany (Patricia Idlette): The reapers&#x27; usual server at &quot;Der Waffle Haus&quot;. She is a quiet observer of the group, and takes their individual idiosyncrasies in stride. She also seems able to see their true faces, as on Halloween (despite their having &quot;returned&quot; to life appearances), Kiffany is able to recognize and interact with all of them without surprise – even newly dead George (spoiling the idea that only reapers so old as to be unrecognizable get their &#x27;true faces&#x27;). Some of the characters believe her to be psychic.
* Charlie (Spencer Achtymichuk): The youngest Reaper George knows is a child reaper, who she initially meets in a vet&#x27;s waiting room when Delores&#x27; cat Murray has a health scare. (Charlie is really there to reap a rabbit.) Child reapers reap animals, and Charlie is seen reaping a komodo dragon in Reggie&#x27;s school, and later her dog, J.D. (Just Dog). He died after being struck by a drunk driver&#x27;s car seven years previously, and lives on the streets.
* Penny (Yeardley Smith): The oldest Reaper George meets is Penny, who died during the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; and whom Mason calls &quot;older than forever and a day.&quot; Penny is one of Rube&#x27;s old Post-It Crew in External Influences Division before she was transferred to a cushier gig in Long Term Care, where she works as a nurse in a nursing home. She says it is less hectic because everyone has a name tag, and no one is going anywhere. Mason and Roxy both greet Penny with affection upon her giving Rube a courtesy heads-up that his daughter, unbeknownst to him living in a long-term care center, was to be her reap that day. He accompanied Penny to say goodbye to Rose in &quot;Always&quot;, and sang his dying daughter to sleep with the lullaby he had sung to her on the day of her childhood that he left and then died.

== Mythology ==

=== Grim reapers ===
In the world of &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;, grim reapers do not wear black cloaks or carry scythes (cloaks and scythes are only featured during the opening credits, for humorous effect), but their role remains traditional: they remove the souls of the living shortly before death and escort them into their afterlife. One becomes a reaper by being the last soul collected when one&#x27;s own reaper meets his or her secret quota.

In the series, Death has a list of who is scheduled to die and when. This list is delivered to the head of each group by a shadowy figure (when the delivery is made to Rube&#x27;s apartment; it is shown that the delivery is made by an actual shadow, with the list of names becoming corporeal only when it is delivered). The head of each group then gives each reaper a non-transferable assignment to collect a particular soul or souls. Completing that assignment is often difficult for the reapers, who receive only the first (and sometimes middle) initial and last name of the person about to die, the location, and estimated time of death (ETD). If a reaper refuses to take a soul at their place of death and the person somehow survives their appointed time, the soul will &quot;wither and die and rot inside&quot; them. If a reaper does not take a soul and the person does die, the soul remains trapped in the body and is subject to extremely traumatic experiences such as witnessing the autopsy of their own body. Deaths can be at least temporarily postponed without risk to the soul&#x27;s well-being by interfering well in advance of the time of death; thus reapers would not be interfering with the events that lead to the death. However, this may have unintended consequences, such as other people dying because of actions taken by the person who should have died.

Reapers have a physical body and may interact with the living and the dead. Besides collecting souls, reapers have powers to remain ageless, heal extremely quickly (George once severed her middle finger, but was able to reattach it by just putting it back in place, while Mason has sustained what should have been fatal damage on multiple occasions, such as being shot and hit by a car), drink alcohol without suffering a hangover (see &quot;Gravelings&quot;), and forcibly pull a soul from a living body and put it back (as seen done by Roxy in Episode 9 &quot;Sunday Mornings&quot;). When seen by the living, reapers&#x27; physical appearances are different from when they were alive to those who knew them, except on Halloween when the living see them as they were in life, and fellow reapers always see their original appearances. Although George is seen by her family and Delores as &quot;Millie,&quot; Rube&#x27;s image was recognizable by a records clerk in a wanted poster seen while Rube and the clerk were doing some research into his past life. Laura Boddington portrays lead character George&#x27;s undead appearance in the TV series, with Jennifer Rae Westley playing her in the later film.

The passage into the afterlife is shown as a brightly lit scene towards which the newly deceased is drawn. The portal is unique to each soul: for a child, it may be a wonderful carnival, but for a yoga master, it may be a Deva beckoning from within a Divine Lotus. Souls cannot be forced to enter the portals, so part of the reapers&#x27; job is to convince them to do so.

Groups of reapers are organized into &quot;divisions&quot; according to various causes of death. Generally, reapers are assigned to a division based upon their own cause of death; Mason tells George in a deleted scene that most of the members of the Plague Division died because of the Plague. In addition to Rube&#x27;s &quot;external influence&quot; team, the three other divisions mentioned in the series are Circulatory Systems Division, the very uneventful and bored reapers of the Plague Division (who spend much of their time playing bocce ball) and the Natural Causes (Old Age) Division mentioned in the 27th and 28th episodes (according to the running order). (In the pilot episode, the viewer is led to believe that the Plague Division members have been reapers for centuries and will be unable to meet their quota, as plague deaths have become so rare.) While the members of Rube&#x27;s team of reapers are instructed to never reap animals, George (and Reggie) do meet a child reaper who reaps the souls of animals — suggesting that there may be a fifth division that exists for this purpose. The teams are organized into jurisdictions of geographical areas, with several teams associated with different causes of death operating within one area. It is not known how much geographical area a single division covers, but the reapers in the series seem to cover only a limited area in Seattle and King County, Washington; with reaper Daisy Adair transferring from the SoHo area of New York City.

=== Gravelings ===

In the show, reapers do not actually kill the living. Instead, deaths are arranged by &quot;gravelings&quot;.

Gravelings are mischievous gremlin-like creatures that cause the accidents and mishaps (in the form of Rube Goldberg machine scenarios) that kill people. The living generally cannot see them, though in the episode &quot;Reaper Madness&quot;, a person with schizophrenia was able to, although Rube refused to believe that was possible. Reapers can see and interact with them to some extent: Daisy once shushed a graveling; Rube yelled, &quot;Get outta here!&quot; once when seeing gravelings desecrating a cemetery statue; and George once chased several angry gravelings around her apartment. Although gravelings seem to be self-aware and recognize the reapers, they do not communicate verbally with them, and talk to each other in a hushed and unintelligible babble; other times they growl or hiss.

According to the episode &quot;Vacation&quot;, gravelings are given one day off every few years. Despite the holiday, most reapers are disturbed by their lack of manners and behavior. During this time they display the odd habit of stacking objects into precarious, humanoid towers.

In the episode &quot;Reapercussions&quot; (Season 1, Episode 4), it is noted that if a reaper interferes with and prevents a scheduled death, a &quot;hunting season&quot; will be declared by the gravelings, who will pester the reaper until that soul is taken and order is restored. Some of the reapers, including George, Roxy, Mason, and Daisy, are plagued by the wrath of gravelings throughout the series.

A graveling rose from the body of Ray in &quot;Forget Me Not&quot; (Season 2, Episode 12) following his murder at the hands of a reaper. This graveling retained Ray&#x27;s mind or some other connection to his life, as it stayed close to Daisy and George&#x27;s house (where Ray was killed) and expressed anger toward Daisy and Mason for Ray&#x27;s death. It was also responsible for an unscheduled death at one of Daisy&#x27;s reaps. Later, in the episode &quot;Always&quot; (Season 2, Episode 14), the graveling was reaped by George, upon which it turned to dust.
In the episode &quot;The Shallow End&quot; (Season 2, Episode 4) a child George in a flashback sees gravelings as she sinks into a swimming pool, with the gravelings appearing to hesitate from claiming her life (although it is not clear whether she actually saw the gravelings), and again in &quot;Haunted&quot; (Season 2, Episode 15) George recalls a Halloween afternoon when as a young girl she saw a graveling scurrying around in the background behind a man who, after she became a reaper, she realizes is a serial killer.

=== Creation ===
Viewers are told that in the beginning, god created death and, not knowing what to do with it, kept it in a sealed urn. Toad was asked by god to watch the urn but Frog pestered Toad into giving it to him. Frog proceeded to juggle the jar from foot to foot and accidentally dropped it, thus letting death out, whereby everything from that point had to die. George is frequently shown caring for an albino Argentine horned frog (also known as a Pacman frog) identical to the one shown as Toad during the opening narration.

== Home media releases and streaming ==

=== DVD releases ===
=== Direct-to-DVD film ===
On April 18, 2007, MGM announced it was developing several direct-to-DVD movies and sequels. First among them was a new film based on &quot;Dead Like Me&quot;.

The movie is set five years after the first series episode. The movie&#x27;s release date was originally set for the summer of 2008, then changed to February 17, 2009. Before its general release, it had a television debut on January 16, 2009, on SuperChannel in Canada. In the movie, the role of Daisy is played by Sarah Wynter. Rube does not appear (he reportedly had moved on), but is mentioned by the characters; the new leader of the reapers is Cameron Kane, played by Henry Ian Cusick.

=== Soundtrack ===
La-La Land Records released a soundtrack containing the original score to the series composed by Stewart Copeland on May 25, 2010, as a limited release of 3000 units.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has an approval rating of 69% with an average score of 6.3 out of 10 based on 16 reviews. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Dead Like Me&quot; is a required (after)taste, but the series&#x27; acidic wit and wry observations about the simple pleasures of life and death overcome the deficit in likable characters.&quot;

=== Awards and nominations ===
=== Ratings ===
The show&#x27;s complete ratings were not released, though executives had claimed to at least one reporter that &quot;Dead Like Me&quot; had ratings three times Showtime&#x27;s primetime average. This contrasts with the network&#x27;s statement that the ratings were not high enough for a third season. The ratings for the series premiere were 1.11 million, a record for a Showtime series premiere that was not beaten until the premiere of &quot;Shameless&quot; seven years later.

<doc id="440663" wikidata="Q6942377" url="?curid=440663" title="Music of the Maldives">
<text>The Maldives is an island nation in the Indian Ocean, and its music is marked mainly by Indian, East African, and Arab influences.

==Traditional performances==

The most widely known form of indigenous music is called &quot;boduberu.&quot;. It is also the most popular, especially in the Northern Atolls. It is said to have appeared in the Maldives in about the 11th century and that it may have East African origins. It is a dance music, performed by about fifteen people, including a lead singer and three percussionists, as well as a bell and a small stick of bamboo with horizontal grooves called an &quot;onugandu&quot;.

&quot;Boduberu&quot; songs begin with a slow beat, eventually entering a frenetic crescendo accompanied by frenetic dancing. Lyrics can be about any number of subjects and often include vocables (meaningless syllables).

&quot;Thaara&quot; music is performed by about 22 people seated in two rows opposite each other. It is performed only by men and is somewhat religious. Like &quot;boduberu&quot;, &quot;thaara&quot; songs begin slowly and come to a peak. &quot;Thaara&quot; is said to have arrived with Arabs who came from the Persian Gulf in the middle of the 17th century.

&quot;Gaa odi lava&quot; is a special type of song performed after the completion of manual labor. It was said to have been invented during the reign of Sultan Mohamed Imadudeen I (1620–1648) for the workers who built defenses for the city of Malé.
In the early 20th century, during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Shamsuddeen III, the Maldives experienced a vibrant cultural transformation. It was in this rich historical context that the youth of the islands began to explore and innovate in the realm of music, leading to the emergence of a unique musical form known as &quot;[[langiri. This new genre was significantly influenced by &quot;thaara, a traditional style of music that served as its primary source. The youth, eager to express their creativity and cultural identity, adapted and modified the performance techniques associated with &quot;thaara&quot; infusing their interpretations and styles into the music. As a result, &quot;[[langiri]]&quot; not only represented a musical evolution but also a reflection of the changing social dynamics and the artistic aspirations of the Maldivian youth during this period.

The &quot;[[bolimalaafath neshun]]&quot; is a dance performed by women on special occasions or when giving gifts to the sultan. These gifts, most often shells, are kept in an intricately decorated box or vase called the &quot;[[kurandi malaafath]]&quot;. About twenty-four women typically participate in small groups of two to six. They march towards the sultan, singing songs of patriotism or loyalty. Since becoming a [[republic]] in 1968, this dance is no longer performed for any sultan, since one no longer exists.

Another women&#x27;s dance is called &quot;[[maafathi neshun]]&quot;, which is similar to &quot;[[langiri]]&quot;. It is performed by women dancing in two rows of ten each, carrying a semi-circular string with fake flowers attached.

A dance called &quot;[[fathigandu jehun]]&quot; is performed by either one person or a group of men, using two pieces of short bamboo sticks to accompany the dancers and a drummer, who also sings. These songs are typically [[Epic poetry|epic]]s, most famously one called &quot;[[Burunee Raivaru]].&quot;.

&quot;[[Bandiyaa jehun]]&quot; is perhaps related to the [[India]]n [[pot dance]], and is performed by women. Dancers mark the beat with a metal water po while wearing metal rings. Modern groups perform either standing or sitting and have added [[drum]]s and [[harmonica]]s.

[[Kulhudhuffushi (Haa Dhaalu Atoll)|Kulhudhuffushi]] (on [[Haa Dhaalu Atoll]]) is known for &quot;[[kadhaamaali]]&quot;, which is performed with numerous drums and a &quot;[[kadhaa]]&quot;, which is made of a [[copper]] plate and rod. About thirty men take part, dressed in costumes of evil spirits (&quot;maali&quot;). &quot;Kadhaamaali&quot; is associated with a traditional walk around the island late at night by the elders to ward off &quot;maali&quot; This walk lasted for three days, followed by music and dancing.

==Popular songs and dances==
Maldivians feel some affinity to Northern India through their language, which is related to the languages of North India. Most older generation or traditional Maldivians like to watch Hindi movies from the 1960s or 70s and like to listen to the songs of those movies. The reason is that out of a similar language, similar rhythms and cadences develop. It is very easy for Maldivians to fit local lyrics to a Hindi tune because of this cultural closeness. For example, the Hindi words &quot;Ek din&quot; (&quot;one day&quot;) are changed to &quot;E kudin&quot; (those kids) in [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]], and in this manner, a new local song develops.

Before cable TV, the most popular radio programmes from the [[Voice of Maldives]] (VOM) were those broadcasting older Hindi songs, like &quot;Vakivumuge kurin&quot; (&quot;Before the breakup&quot;). On rural islands, Hindi songs are still the most popular songs, especially the older ones from [[Mohammed Rafi]], [[Mukesh (singer)|Mukesh]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Asha Bhonsle]], [[Hemant Kumar]] and [[Kishore Kumar]]. Therefore, most popular Maldivian songs are based in (or influenced by) Hindi songs.

Similarly, the few popular local dances are based on North Indian dances, especially &quot;[[Kathak]].&quot;.

The favorite musical instrument of Maldivians, besides the drum, is the &quot;[[bulbul tarang],&quot; a kind of horizontal accordion. This instrument is also used to accompany devotional songs, like 
&quot;Maadhaha&quot;. Singers like Naifaru Dohokko became famous through songs with &quot;bulbul&quot; music in the background. The first &quot;bulbuls&quot; were brought from Calcutta]] in the early 19th century. Influences from North Indian music and dances date back to that time. They did not begin broadcasting Hindi songs on rthe adio until the 1960s and 1970s.

There are also female singers producing traditional songs; among them, the most popular were Fareeda Hasan and Jēmuge Donkamanaa, whose songs continue to be cherished by Maldivians, although both women have died.

==Religious songs==
Formerly, in the islands of Maldives, there was a festival called &quot;[[Maulu&#x27;ulu|Maulūdu]]&quot;, where religious songs were sung by groups of males within a pavilion (&quot;haruge&quot;) specially built for the occasion. When a &quot;Maulūd&quot; was arranged, local islanders had to build a large, open-sided pavilion with wooden poles. They would thatch it with coconut-palm fronds and decorate it with oil lamps and special patchwork draperies. On the day of the event, special food would be prepared and beautifully displayed for the benefit of the &quot;Maulūd&quot; singers and a great number of guests coming from their rival island (or village), in their best dresses, on festively decorated boats. Here,t he host islanders had to prove themselves hospitable in the preparations and accommodation to be able to compare favorably when it was their turn to receive hospitality in the rival island on a similar occasion. Another name for religious songs is &quot;madhaha&quot;.

==Modern music==

Hussain Shihab, formerly a musician and now the minister of state for arts, wrote a song to a foreign tune. This song was named &quot;hiy Adhu Roneeyey Nudhashey,&quot; which he admitted in a program broadcast on the anniversary of [[Television Maldives]] (TVM). Western music is more popular in the capital, as in any global city.

However, popular music has shifted from plagiarizing to more original concepts. The Dhivehi band [[Zero Degree Atoll]] released an album named &quot;Dhoni&quot; (&quot;[[Dhoni|Traditional Maldivian Boat]]&quot;). This album had roots in folk and ancient arts such as &quot;[[Raivaru],&quot; a type of traditional poetry where letters are swapped to be sung in a certain melody. The album was a huge success, followed by its remake with few new songs in 1997, the album titled &quot;Island Pulse&quot; recorded in France. The band had a huge impact on the local population, which unofficially claimed it as the saviors of traditional Dhivehi musical art and the pioneers of modern Dhivehi music. 

Another famous band is the [[Trio Band]]. Thetrio&#x27;s first performance was in the Dhanberu Live show, where they performed the well-known songs Chaaley, Raarukuga, an d Ey Manjey. The trio has a unique style for a young band. Lately, they became a boduberu-style band. Trio Band&#x27;s Lead Vocalist is Moosa Shifau. 

Many other bands and local performers have kept up the tradition. It is believed that the state-sponsored radio and TV grew more in favor of foreign musicwhen most quintessential Dhivehi musicians started including political content in their lyrics.

Such lyricists include [[Easa of Sea Child]], who was jailed for drug-related issues. Although Easa is not regarded professionally, many of his songs have been stolen and sung. While serving time at [[Maafushi (Kaafu Atoll)|Maafushi]], he is said to have written more than a hundred songs. Songs such as &quot;Jamalegge Soora&quot; (&quot;face of a camel&quot;), &quot;Filavalhu&quot; (&quot;lesson&quot;), &quot;Fangivinun&quot; (a collaboration of folk and an original &quot;Raivaru&quot;), &quot;Insaana&quot; (&quot;the Human&quot;) and &quot;Govaali Adu&quot; are very prominent among musicians, and in the underground music scene.

<text>The year 1860 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events, listed below.

==Astronomy==
* July 18 – Total solar eclipse. Warren De La Rue&#x27;s photographs of this event, taken in Spain, together with those of Angelo Secchi, demonstrate the solar character of the prominences or red flames seen around the limb of the Moon during such an eclipse.

==Biology==

* June 30 – Debate about evolution at the new Oxford University Museum of Natural History.
* John Curtis publishes &quot;Farm Insects, being the natural history and economy of the insects injurious to the field crops of Great Britain and Ireland... with suggestions for their destruction&quot; in Glasgow.

==Botany==
* Joseph Dalton Hooker concludes publication of &quot;The Botany of the Antarctic Voyage of H.M. Discovery Ships &quot;Erebus&quot; and &quot;Terror&quot; ... 1839–1843&quot; with issue of the final part of &quot;Flora Tasmaniae&quot; in London.

==Chemistry==
* September 3–5 – Karlsruhe Congress, the first international meeting of chemists.
* Marcellin Berthelot rediscovers and names acetylene.
* Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, using their newly improved spectroscope, discover and name caesium in mineral water from Bad Dürkheim, Germany.
* Stanislao Cannizzaro, resurrecting Avogadro&#x27;s ideas regarding diatomic molecules, compiles a table of atomic weights and presents it at the 1860 Karlsruhe Congress, ending decades of conflicting atomic weights and molecular formulas, and leading to Mendeleev&#x27;s discovery of the periodic law.
* Albert Niemann makes a detailed analysis of the coca leaf, isolating and purifying the crystalline alkaloid which he calls cocaine.
* The Erlenmeyer flask is created by German chemist Emil Erlenmeyer.

==Mathematics==
* Carl Wilhelm Borchardt first discovers and proves Cayley&#x27;s formula in graph theory.

==Medicine==
* July 9 – The Nightingale Training School and Home for Nurses, the first nursing school based on the ideas of Florence Nightingale, is opened at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London.

==Psychology==
* Gustav Fechner publishes &quot;Elemente der Psychophysik&quot;, establishing the discipline of psychophysics and introducing the Weber–Fechner law on the intensity of stimuli.

==Technology==

* April 9 – Earliest known decipherable sound recording of the human voice, a phonautogram, produced by Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville. Playback is impossible at this time.
* December 29 – Launch of HMS &quot;Warrior&quot; by the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, the first all-iron warship, for the first time combining steam engines delivering high speed, rifled breech-loading guns, iron frames and armoured cladding, and the propeller, in the largest naval ship built to this date.
* Benjamin Tyler Henry patents the Henry rifle, a 16-shot .44 caliber rimfire breech-loading lever action tubular magazine model, predecessor of the Winchester.
* Edward Samuel Ritchie, considered to be the most innovative instrument maker in nineteenth-century America, receives a U.S. patent for the first successful and practicable liquid-filled marine compass suitable for general use.

==Awards==
* Copley Medal: Robert Wilhelm Bunsen
* Wollaston Medal for geology: Searles Valentine Wood

==Births==
* February 29 – Herman Hollerith (died 1929), American statistician, punched card data processing inventor.
* May 2
** John Scott Haldane (died 1936), Scottish physiologist.
** D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth Thompson (died 1948), Scottish biologist.
* May 25 – James McKeen Cattell (died 1944), American psychologist.
* June 8 – Alicia Boole Stott (died 1940) Anglo-Irish mathematician.
* December 31 – John T. Thompson (died 1940), American inventor.

==Deaths==
* January 27 – János Bolyai (born 1802), Hungarian mathematician.
* January 27 – Thomas Brisbane (born 1773), British astronomer.
* April 1 – Joseph Guislain (born 1797), Belgian psychiatrist.

<text>The year 1859 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events, listed below.

==Archaeology==
* May 26 &amp; June 2 – Geologist Joseph Prestwich and amateur archaeologist John Evans report (to the Royal Society and Society of Antiquaries of London, respectively) the results of their investigations of gravel-pits in the Somme valley and elsewhere, extending human history back to what will become known as the Paleolithic Era.

==Astronomy==
* August 28–September 2 – The solar storm of 1859, the largest geomagnetic solar storm on record, causes the Northern lights aurora to be visible as far south as Cuba and knocks out telegraph communication. This is also called the Carrington event, Richard Carrington being the first known person to observe solar flares, due to this storm. It is also the first major solar radiation storm to be recorded.
* Marian Albertovich Kowalski publishes the first usable method to deduce the rotation of the Milky Way.
* English clergyman Thomas William Webb publishes the first edition of his popular amateur guide &quot;Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes&quot;.
* Attempting to explain Mercury&#x27;s solar orbit, French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier proposes the existence of a hypothetical planet, Vulcan, inside its orbit and amateur astronomer Edmond Modeste Lescarbault claims to have observed it on March 26.

==Biology==

* March 21 – The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania issues the charter establishing the Zoological Society of Philadelphia, the first organization of its kind in the United States and founder of the nation&#x27;s first zoo.
* November 3 – Alfred Russel Wallace&#x27;s paper &quot;On the Zoological geography of the Malay Archipelago&quot;, introducing the Wallace Line, is read by Charles Darwin to the Linnean Society of London.
* November 24 – Charles Darwin publishes &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;.
* December – Joseph Dalton Hooker&#x27;s &quot;Introductory Essay to the Flora Tasmaniae&quot; supports Darwin&#x27;s theories.
* Pollen is identified as the cause of allergic rhinitis by Charles Harrison Blackley.
* Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, in the second volume of &quot;Histoire naturelle générale des Règnes organiques&quot;, introduces the term &quot;ethology&quot;.
* Wilhelm Peters first describes the guppy (fish &quot;Poecilia reticulata&quot;) from Venezuela.
* Rudolf Virchow publishes &quot;Vorlesungen über Cellularpathologie in ihrer Begründung auf physiologischer und pathologischer Gewebelehre&quot;, a major textbook on cellular pathology.

==Chemistry==
* Benjamin Collins Brodie reports the highly lamellar structure of thermally reduced graphite oxide.
* Aleksandr Butlerov discovers hexamine.
* August von Hofmann isolates sorbic acid.
* Gustav Robert Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen invent an improved spectroscope.
* Pinacol is discovered through Pinacol coupling reaction by Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig.

==Climatology==
* John Tyndall discovers that some gases block infrared radiation. He suggests that changes in the concentration of these gases could bring climate change.

==Geography==
* The Royal Geographical Society of London is granted a Royal Charter by Queen Victoria.
* French mathematician Nicolas Auguste Tissot first proposes Tissot&#x27;s indicatrix in cartography.

==Mathematics==
* Emanoil Bacaloglu develops the &quot;Bacaloglu pseudosphere&quot;.
* Arthur Cayley produces the first Cayley–Klein metric.
* Bernhard Riemann publishes his paper on number theory, &quot; die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen &quot; (&quot;On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude&quot;) including the Riemann zeta function and Riemann hypothesis.

==Medicine==
* Florence Nightingale publishes &quot;Notes on Nursing: What it is and What it is Not&quot; in London.
* District nursing begins in Liverpool, England, when philanthropist William Rathbone employs Mary Robinson to nurse the sick poor in their own homes.

==Technology==
* May 2 – Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s Royal Albert Bridge for the Cornwall Railway at Saltash in England is officially opened.
* November 24 – French ironclad &quot;Gloire&quot; launched, the first ocean-going ironclad battleship.
* Thomas Aveling of Rochester, Kent, England, produces the first traction engine, by modification of an existing machine.
* Étienne Lenoir, working in Paris, produces the first single-cylinder two-stroke Lenoir cycle gas engine with an electric ignition system.

== Physics ==
* Gustav Kirchhoff first states Kirchhoff&#x27;s law of thermal radiation in several papers.

==Awards==
* February 23 – William Armstrong created a Knight Bachelor
* Copley Medal: Wilhelm Weber
* Wollaston Medal for geology: Charles Darwin

<text>Peter Gunn is an American private eye television series, starring Craig Stevens as Peter Gunn with Lola Albright as his girlfriend, lounge singer Edie Hart. The series was broadcast by NBC from September 22, 1958, to 1960 and by ABC in 1960–61. The series was created by Blake Edwards, who also wrote 39 episodes and directed nine.

According to Vincent Terrace, &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; was the first detective series whose character was created especially for television, instead of adapted from other media.

The series is probably best remembered today for its music, including the iconic &quot;Peter Gunn Theme&quot;, which was nominated for an Emmy Award and two Grammys for Henry Mancini. Subsequently it has been performed and recorded by many jazz, rock and blues musicians. The progressive rock band Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer recorded the song, adding synthesizers. The series was number 17 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1958–59 TV season and number 29 for the 1960–61 TV season.

==Plot==
Peter Gunn is a suave, well-dressed private investigator whose hair is always in place and who loves cool jazz. Whereas other gumshoes are often coarse and vulgar, Gunn is a sophisticate with expensive tastes. A contemporary article in &quot;Life&quot; noted that Edwards &quot;deliberately tailored the part after the famous movie smoothie Cary Grant&quot;.

Gunn operates in a gloomy waterfront city, the name and location of which is not revealed in the series. He often visits Mother&#x27;s, a smokey, wharfside jazz club that Gunn uses as his &quot;office&quot;, usually meeting new clients there. Gunn has a reputation for integrity and being among the best investigators; he has many reliable informants and is well-connected. His reputation is so good, the police occasionally ask him for help or advice. He sometimes works cases out of state and occasionally out of the country. Gunn was observed in &quot;Murder on the Midway&quot; as &quot;wearing $30 shoes ($321 in 2023 dollars), a $200 suit ($2144 in 2023 dollars) and carrying a solid gold cigarette lighter&quot;. Gunn drives a 1958 two-tone DeSoto two-door hardtop in the first few episodes of the first season, then a 1959 Plymouth Fury convertible with a white top and a car phone. In the third season Gunn drives a 1960 white Plymouth Fury convertible with a car phone, later changing to a 1961 Plymouth Fury convertible.

Gunn&#x27;s girlfriend, Edie Hart (Lola Albright), is a sultry singer employed at Mother&#x27;s; she opens her own restaurant and nightclub in season 3, named Edie&#x27;s. Gunn&#x27;s pet name for Edie is &quot;Silly&quot;. Herschel Bernardi costarred as Lieutenant Jacoby, a jaded veteran police detective and friend of Gunn who works at the 13th Precinct. Occasionally he refers people to Gunn as clients. He is especially notable for his crackling, cynical sardonic wit. In 1959, Bernardi received his only Emmy nomination for the role. Hope Emerson appeared as Mother, who had been a singer and piano player in speakeasies during Prohibition. She received an Emmy nomination for the role. For the second season, Mother was played by Minerva Urecal, following the departure of Emerson for a starring role in &quot;The Dennis O&#x27;Keefe Show&quot;. Associate producer Byron Kane portrayed Barney, the bartender at Mother&#x27;s; Kane was not credited for playing this role. Bill Chadney appeared as Emmett, Mother&#x27;s piano player. (Chadney and Albright were married in 1961.)

Both Billy Barty as diminutive pool hustler Babby and Herbert Ellis as Beat bistro owner, painter, and sculptor Wilbur, appeared in several episodes as occasional &quot;information resources&quot;, as &quot;Mother&quot; also often is. Capri Candela appeared as Wilbur&#x27;s girlfriend, Capri. Morris Erby had the recurring role of Sgt. Lee Davis during all three seasons of the show. Frequent director Robert Gist appeared as an actor in different roles in three episodes. James Lanphier portrayed Leslie the maitre d&#x27;hôtel at Edie&#x27;s restaurant and nightclub during season 3.

==Episodes==


&quot;Peter Gunn&quot; ran for three seasons starting in late 1958. A total of 114 episodes were produced during the three season run. &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; premiered on September 22, 1958 with the episode &quot;The Kill&quot;. The first season ran from September 1958 through June 1959 and contained 38 episodes.

==Origin of series==
Edwards developed &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; from an earlier fictional detective that he had created. &quot;Richard Diamond, Private Detective&quot; starred Dick Powell, and aired as a radio series from 1949 to 1953. David Janssen later starred in the television adaptation from 1957 to 1960. It was this character&#x27;s success which prompted his creator to revisit the concept as Peter Gunn. Edwards had earlier written and directed a &quot;Mike Hammer&quot; television pilot for Brian Keith.

According to Blake Edwards, Gunn was &quot;a present-day soldier of fortune who has found himself a gimmick that pays him a very comfortable living. The gimmick was trouble. People who had major trouble will pay handsomely to get rid of it, and Peter Gunn was a man who will not only accept the pay but do something about it. He knows every element of the city, from cops to crooks. He also, of course, has his soft side and will occasionally take on a charity job for free. But we&#x27;ll never make the mistake of letting her [Edie] catch him. Never.&quot;

For the part of Edie, Edwards said, &quot;We toyed at first with the idea of getting a name singer. But we soon realized it would be impractical to have a name singer cast in what is primarily a straight dramatic role. It wouldn&#x27;t be fair, either to the singer or the audience. Once that idea was discarded, my first thought was Lola Albright. Lola had been going along well but not terribly well, if you know what I mean. But I&#x27;d always felt she had a potential that had never really been tapped. She&#x27;s sort of two beats off center in the way she talks and sings, and that&#x27;s what we were looking for.&quot;

Speaking of Albright in 1992, Henry Mancini said, &quot;She was perfect casting for that role because she had an off-the-cuff kind of jazz delivery that was very hard to find.&quot;

Lola Albright said, &quot;My whole career had been sort of ordinary. &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; changed all that.&quot; Albright said that Blake Edwards had her in mind from the outset, &quot;But he had no idea I could sing. I had just recorded my first album.&quot;

Craig Stevens discusses how he and co-star Lola Albright were cast for the show, with cable TV host Skip E. Lowe, in an interview taped in 1993.

Initially, the title of the program was to be Gunn for Hire. The change to &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; occurred after officials at Paramount Pictures complained that the title was similar to that of the 1942 Paramount film &quot;This Gun for Hire&quot;.

==Production==
Besides those directed by Blake Edwards, other episodes were directed by Boris Sagal, Robert Gist, Jack Arnold, Lamont Johnson, Robert Altman (for one episode) and several others. A total of 114 thirty-minute episodes were produced by Spartan Productions. Season one was filmed at Universal Studios, while seasons two and three were filmed at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Philip H. Lathrop and William W. Spencer were cinematographers on many episodes. Craig Stevens&#x27; wardrobe was tailored by Don Richards and Lola Albright&#x27;s fashions by Emeson&#x27;s for 2 episodes (&quot;The Vicious Dog&quot;, &quot;The Blind Pianist&quot;) and by Jax for the remainder of the episodes. Wardrobe was not credited in episode 1, &quot;The Kill&quot;.

==Music==
The show&#x27;s use of modern jazz music was a distinctive touch that helped set the standard for many years to come, with cool jazz themes accompanying every move Gunn made. The music, composed by Henry Mancini, was performed by a small jazz ensemble which included a number of prominent Los Angeles-based jazz and studio musicians. Trumpeter Pete Candoli, alto saxophonist Ted Nash, flutist Ronny Lang, trombonist Dick Nash, and pianist and future composer John Williams provided most of the improvised jazz solos. Williams plays the piano part on the title music ostinato.

Prominent jazz musicians occasionally made on-screen appearances. Trumpeter Shorty Rogers appeared in the episode titled &quot;The Frog&quot; playing flugelhorn as Lola sings &quot;How High the Moon&quot;. Drummer Shelly Manne, in addition to performing on the soundtrack album, was credited with a Special Guest role in the 1959 episode &quot;Keep Smiling&quot; playing drums in the &quot;Bamboo Club&quot; combo. Brazilian guitarist Laurindo Almeida plays guitar as himself in the 1959 episode &quot;Skin Deep&quot;.

In his autobiography &quot;Did They Mention the Music?&quot; Mancini stated: 

The &quot;Peter Gunn Theme&quot; became an instant hit, earning Mancini an Emmy Award nomination and two Grammys. The RCA Victor soundtrack album by Henry Mancini, &quot;The Music from Peter Gunn&quot;, was voted Album of the Year at the 1st Annual Grammy Awards in 1959 and reached No. 1 in Billboard&#x27;s Pop LP Charts. The popularity of this album prompted RCA Victor to issue a second Mancini album of &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; music titled &quot;More Music from Peter Gunn&quot;. Bandleader Ray Anthony&#x27;s recording of the theme music reached No. 8 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100. Shelly Manne recorded two jazz albums of themes from the show in 1959, &quot;Shelly Manne &amp; His Men Play Peter Gunn&quot; and &quot;Son of Gunn!!&quot;.

&quot;The Peter Gunn Theme&quot; has been recorded and performed by numerous musicians.

In 2019, Jasmine Records released a CD combining both Henry Mancini soundtracks of &quot;The Music of Peter Gunn&quot; and &quot;More Music from Peter Gunn&quot;.

The theme was also used in the &quot;Spy Hunter&quot; arcade video game, and has been used by the Kilgore College Rangerettes as the tryout music for their specialty jazz group since the 1960s.

==Emmy nominations==
The series was nominated for eight prime time Emmys without wins, all in 1959. They were for Best Dramatic Series - Less than One Hour, Craig Stevens as best lead actor in a drama, Herschel Bernardi as best supporting actor in a drama, Lola Albright and Hope Emerson as best supporting actress in a drama, Henry Mancini for best musical contribution to a television production, and Blake Edwards for best writing and direction of a single episode of a drama series.

==Adaptations==
The series made the transition to other media. An original novel and a comic book adaptation were published by Dell Publishing in 1960. The novel, entitled &quot;Peter Gunn: Murder to a Jazz Beat&quot;, was written by Henry Kane. The comic book issue &quot;Four Color&quot; #1087 (published by Dell Comics), entitled &quot;Peter Gunn,&quot; featured a photo cover that read, &quot;Pete tries to stop a postage stamp counterfeiter, and gets a parcel of trouble – special delivery!&quot; Lowell Toy Mfg. produced the &quot;Peter Gunn Detective Game&quot;, a board game in 1960.

A feature film, &quot;Gunn&quot;, was released by Paramount Pictures in 1967, scripted by Edwards and William Peter Blatty and directed by Edwards with Stevens reprising the title role. A long-gestating ABC 90-minute pilot, &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, aired in April 1989 was written, produced, and directed by Edwards and starred Peter Strauss in the lead role, but the network failed to order a series despite strong ratings and reviews.

In 2001, Edwards and his son, Geoffrey, joined with producers Jeffrey Tinnell and John Michaels and writer Norman Snider in developing an updated television series, &quot;The New Peter Gunn&quot; for Muse Entertainment in Canada. The project fell through when producers John Woo and David Permut began developing a big screen remake for Paramount with screenwriter W. Peter Iliff. &quot;Once Upon a Time in L.A.&quot; was pitched as a possible vehicle for John Travolta or Harrison Ford. Neither revival made it beyond the script stage.

TNT announced a new series was in development in May 2013 from producers Steven Spielberg, Julie Andrews, Lou Pitt, Justin Falvey and Darryl Frank with writers Scott Rosenberg, Jeff Pinkner, Josh Appelbaum, and André Nemec. The proposed series was not picked up for the 2014–2015 season.

In 2017, Paramount renewed its agreement with The Blake Edwards Estate with the intent of developing the property.

==Media==
From 1992 to 1996, Rhino Entertainment released various episodes of &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; on VHS cassettes. In 1999, Diamond Entertainment Corporation released a five-cassette set comprising ten episodes. Marathon Music &amp; Video released a seven-cassette box set entitled &quot;TV Cops and Private Eyes&quot;, in which an episode of &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; was included.

In 2002, A&amp;E Home Video released two volume sets of &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; on DVD in Region 1, which comprise 32 episodes from Season One. These releases used edited-for-syndication versions of episodes.

Timeless Media Group released &quot;Peter Gunn – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1 in 2012. The 12-disc set features all 114 episodes of the series, as well as a bonus CD of Henry Mancini&#x27;s score, The Music from Peter Gunn

<text>The VIC-II (Video Interface Chip II), specifically known as the MOS Technology 6567/6566/8562/8564 (NTSC versions), 6569/8565/8566 (PAL), is the microchip tasked with generating Y/C video signals (combined to composite video in the RF modulator) and DRAM refresh signals in the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 home computers.

Succeeding the original MOS Technology VIC used in the VIC-20, the VIC-II was one of the key custom chips in the Commodore 64 (the other being the MOS Technology 6581 sound chip).

==Development history==
The VIC-II chip was designed primarily by Albert Charpentier and Charles Winterble at MOS Technology, Inc. as a successor to the MOS Technology 6560 &quot;VIC&quot;. The team at MOS Technology had previously failed to produce two graphics chips named &quot;MOS Technology 6562&quot; for the Commodore TOI computer, and &quot;MOS Technology 6564&quot; for the Color PET, due to memory speed constraints.

In order to construct the VIC-II, Charpentier and Winterble made a market survey of current home computers and video games, listing up the current features, and what features they wanted to have in the VIC-II. The idea of adding sprites came from the TI-99/4A computer and its TMS9918 graphics coprocessor. The idea to support collision detection came from the Mattel Intellivision. The Atari 800 was also mined for desired features, particularly bitmap mode, which was a desired goal of the MOS team as all of Commodore&#x27;s principal home computer rivals had bitmap graphics while the VIC-20 only had redefinable characters. About 3/4 of the chip surface is used for the sprite functionality.

The chip was partly laid out using electronic design automation tools from &quot;Applicon&quot; (now a part of UGS Corp.), and partly laid out manually on vellum paper. The design was partly debugged by fabricating chips containing small subsets of the design, which could then be tested separately. This was easy since MOS Technology had both its research and development lab and semiconductor plant at the same location. The initial batch of test chips came out almost fully functional, with only one bad sprite. The chip was developed in 5 micrometer technology.

The work on the VIC-II was completed in November 1981 while Robert Yannes was simultaneously working on the SID chip. Both chips, like the Commodore 64, were finished in time for the Consumer Electronics Show in the first weekend of January 1982.

==VIC-II features==

* 16 kB address space for screen, character and sprite memory
* 320 × 200 pixels video resolution (160 × 200 in multi-color mode)
* 40 × 25 characters text resolution
* Three character display modes and two bitmap modes
* 16 colors
* Concurrent handling of 8 sprites per scanline, each of 24 × 21 pixels (12 × 21 multicolor)
* Raster interrupt (see details, below)
* Smooth scrolling
* Independent dynamic RAM refresh
* Bus mastering for a 6502-style system bus; CPU and VIC-II accessing the bus during alternating half-clock cycles (the VIC-II will halt the CPU when it needs extra cycles)

==Technical details==
Note that below register addresses are stated as seen by CPU in a C64. To yield the register numbers as usually given in data sheets (i. e. starting with 0), the leading &quot;D0&quot; should be omitted.

===Programming===
The VIC-II is programmed by manipulating its 47 control registers (up from 16 in the VIC), memory mapped to the range – in the C64 address space. Of all these registers, 34 deal exclusively with sprite control (sprites being called MOBs, from &quot;Movable Object Blocks&quot;, in the VIC-II documentation). Like its predecessor, the VIC-II handles light pen input, and with help from the C64&#x27;s standard character ROM, provided the original PETSCII character set from 1977 on a similarly dimensioned display as the 40-column PET series.

By reloading the VIC-II&#x27;s control registers via machine code hooked into the raster interrupt routine (the scanline interrupt), one can program the chip to generate significantly more than 8 concurrent sprites (a process known as sprite multiplexing), and generally give every program-defined slice of the screen different scrolling, resolution and color properties. The hardware limitation of 8 sprites per scanline can be increased further by letting the sprites flicker rapidly on and off. Mastery of the raster interrupt is essential in order to unleash the VIC-II&#x27;s capabilities. Many demos and some later games would establish a fixed &quot;lock-step&quot; between the CPU and the VIC-II so that the VIC registers could be manipulated at exactly the right moment.

===Character graphics===
The C64 shipped with the PETSCII character set in a 4k ROM, but, like the VIC-20 before it, the actual data for the characters was read from memory at a specified location. This location is one of the VIC-II registers, which allowed programmers to construct their own characters sets by placing the appropriate data in memory; each character is an 8x8 grid, a byte representing 8 bits horizontally, so 8 bytes are required for a single character and thus the complete 256-character set uses a total of 2,048 bytes. Theoretically as many as eight character sets can be used if the entire 16k of video memory were filled.

In addition to charsets, the VIC-II also uses 1000 bytes to store the 25 lines of 40 characters per line, one byte for each character, which in power on default configuration sits at -. Color RAM is accessed as bits 8 to 11 of the video matrix; in the 64 and 128, it is located in I/O space at - and cannot be moved from that location. It contains the values for color 1 (color 3 in multicolor mode) of each character.

The character ROM is mapped into two of the VIC-II&#x27;s four &quot;windows&quot;, at - and -, although the CPU cannot see it there (the character ROM may be switched into - where it is visible to the CPU, but not the VIC-II). Thus graphics data or video buffers cannot be placed at - or - because the VIC-II will see the character ROM there instead. Because these areas of RAM could not be used by the VIC-II graphics chip, they were frequently used for music/sound effects (the SID chip). The C64 has the ability to have RAM and ROM at the same address in memory but the CPU would &quot;see&quot; one and the VIC-II chip would &quot;see&quot; the other.

In default high-resolution character mode, the foreground of each character may be set individually in the color RAM. In multicolor character mode, color 3 is limited to the first eight possible color values; the fourth bit is then used as a flag indicating if this character is to be displayed in high-resolution or multicolor, thus making it possible to mix both types on one screen. Colors 1 and 2 are set by the registers at and and are global for all characters.

If Extended Background Color Mode is used, the upper two bits of the character code are used to select one of four background color registers. This allows four different background colors on the screen, but at the expense of only allowing 64 different characters instead of 256. Because this is limiting, games seldom used it.

===Bitmap mode===
Adding an all-points-addressable bitmap mode was one of the Commodore design team&#x27;s primary goals, as the VIC-I lacked such a feature. However, in order to use as little additional circuitry as possible, they organized it in the same manner as character mode, i.e. 8x8 and 4x8 tiles. Bitmap graphics require an 8k page for the pixel data and each byte corresponds to one row of eight or four pixels. The next byte is the row underneath it and after the 8th row, returning to the top of the next tile.

In hi-res bitmaps, screen RAM is used to hold the foreground and background colors of each tile (high and low nibble of each byte). This is the only VIC-II mode that does not make any use of the color RAM at or the background color register at .

Multicolor bitmap mode allows three colors per tile (the fourth is the background color as set in ). Colors 1 and 2 are selected by the bits in screen RAM (same as hires bitmaps) and the third is from color RAM.

Despite the high level of color detail and all-points-addressable capabilities of bitmap mode, it is generally impractical for in-game graphics due to requiring a high amount of system resources (8k for the pixel data plus considerable more CPU cycles to modify each tile) and normally cannot be scrolled. Thus, it is most commonly seen on loader and sometimes title screens.

===Sprites===
VIC-II sprites are either 24x21 monochrome or 12x21 multicolor. Similar to character graphics, the latter have one individual color for each sprite and two global ones. VIC-II has eight sprites, each of which uses 64 bytes of memory to store but, with certain limitations, it can display many more. Sprite multiplexing is a common method of getting more than eight on screen (although there still is a maximum of eight per scan line). The VIC-II scanline counter can be polled until the desired point is reached on screen, or a raster interrupt can be programmed to trigger at a certain scanline, after which the program quickly changes the sprite coordinates. This method can result in many additional sprites onscreen at once, often for a total of 16 to 24 or more. For a demo, though, the limit is considerably more flexible.

In theory the maximum number of different sprites visible at the same time is 256 (assuming the VIC-II&#x27;s entire 16k page was filled). They are addressed by using a block number to refer to each sprite pattern in memory beginning with 0 and going to 255 ($FF) depending on their position in the video page. (if the second video bank (numbered as 0 1 2 and 3) is used, Block 0 would refer to the sprite stored at and Block 255 would be at ).

Each sprite may be double-sized vertically, horizontally or both. This does not increase the sprite resolution (it is still 24 pixels wide and 21 tall) but each pixel will be twice as wide and/or twice as tall.

Because the horizontal position register for each sprite is one byte and limited to a maximum value of 255, it alone cannot cover the entire 320 pixels of the VIC-II&#x27;s screen area, so an additional register called the Most Significant Byte Flag provides a 9th position bit for all sprites.

 and contain the Background and Sprite-to-Sprite Collision registers. The former is rarely used because it cannot provide information on the specific background object the sprite is touching.

 contains the Sprite To Background priority register, which is used to govern whether a sprite moves behind or in front of background graphics. When a sprite enters the same space as another sprite, the lower-numbered ones will always pass over the higher numbered ones.

===Scrolling===
In order to scroll a character screen, the VIC-II is set to 38-column and/or 24-line mode via the registers at and . This creates an off-screen buffer where the row of characters to be scrolled is placed. By adjusting the scroll bits in the above-mentioned registers, one row may be moved on-screen after which it repeats unless a new row is put in the buffer. Color RAM is scrolled simultaneous with screen RAM and works the same way.

VIC-II scrolling is a relatively complicated, CPU intensive task, although it is not uncommon for C64 game programmers to cheat by designing graphics so that the color RAM can remain static. Another standard trick is to use a section of the screen (perhaps the bottom or top 4 or 5 character rows) as a game status area to display score, lives, etc. reducing the amount of scrolling that has to be performed. Finally, it is often necessary to use the &quot;double-buffering&quot; technique to prevent screen tearing. Two 1k blocks of screen ram are reserved; one is displayed while another is written to, then during vblank they are quickly swapped through manipulation of the VIC-II registers. Unfortunately this cannot be done with color RAM.

Late in the C64&#x27;s commercial lifespan, an exploit known as VSP (Variable Screen Positioning) was discovered that involved manipulation of the control bits in to produce fast scrolling at a much lower CPU cycle cost than the standard scroll registers, however it required careful, cycle-exact coding and did not work reliably on some VIC-II revisions; also it can only be used for horizontal scrolling. It is notably used in &quot;Mayhem in Monsterland&quot;.

===Raster interrupts===
Utilization of raster interrupts is an essential part of C64 game programming. In the computer&#x27;s power-on default state, the first MOS Technology CIA chip generates a maskable interrupt (IRQ) 60 times per second (whether NTSC or PAL, this is unrelated to video refresh) which sends the CPU to the kernel IRQ handler at . The handler acknowledges the CIA&#x27;s IRQ, updates the clock, scans the keyboard, and blinks the cursor in BASIC.

Games normally disable the CIA&#x27;s interrupt and instead set up the VIC-II to generate interrupts when a specific scanline is reached, which is necessary for split-screen scrolling and playing music. The game remaps the IRQ vector at / to its raster handler which performs these functions and then optionally executes a JMP instruction to return control to the kernel.

Some games use only one IRQ; however, chained IRQs are more common and improve program stability. In this setup, the IRQ is remapped to the second routine and so forth for each one until the last one restores it to the address of the first IRQ. When chained IRQs are used, only one JMP instruction is needed in the chain and the others can be ended with JMP , which simply goes to the end of the kernel handler. Also it is not uncommon for games to switch out the kernal and use their own IRQ handler instead. The NMI can be used for an additional interrupt thread, although undesirable side effects can result from accidentally pressing the Restore key as it triggers an NMI if pressed.

The VIC-II may also generate a raster interrupt from the collision registers, but this feature is rarely used as it provides insufficient information to the program in most cases.

===Memory mapping===
The VIC-II has a 14-bit address bus and can use any of the four 16k segments of the C64&#x27;s memory space for video data. To manage this, two additional address bits are contributed by port bits of CIA. - is the power-on default. The second segment (–) is typically the best choice for programming from BASIC as it is the only segment that is completely free RAM with no ROMs or I/O registers mapped into it. The fourth segment (–) is also a good choice provided that machine language is used, as the kernel ROMs must be disabled to gain read access by the CPU, and it avoids having discontiguous program code and data that would result from using -. Note that graphics data may be freely stored underneath the BASIC ROM at -, the kernel ROM at - or I/O registers and color RAM at –, since the VIC-II only sees RAM, regardless of how the CPU memory mapping is adjusted; character ROM is visible only in the first and third segment, thus if segment two or four is used, the programmer must supply his own character data. The screen RAM, bitmap page, sprites, and character sets must all occupy the same segment window (provided the CIA bits aren&#x27;t changed via scanline interrupt). The last six bytes of system memory (-) contain the IRQ, NMI, and reset vectors so if the top of memory is used to store a character set or sprite data, and the KERNAL ROM is switched out revealing the RAM underneath to the CPU, it will be necessary to sacrifice one character or sprite to avoid overwriting the vectors.

===Registers===
The VIC-II has 47 read/write registers listed below:

===Colors===
In multicolor character mode (160×200 pixels, which most games use) characters have 4×8 pixels (the characters are still approximately square since the pixels are double width) and 4 colors out of 16 colors. Three of the colors are the same for the entire screen (the background color, multicolor 1, and multicolor 2 registers), while the remaining color can be set individually for every such 4×8 pixel area as defined in color RAM. Sprites in multicolor mode (12×21 pixels) have three colors plus transparency: two colors shared among all sprites and one individual. Artists pick shared colors such that the combination with individual colors leads to a colorful impression. Some games reload shared colors during the raster interrupt; for example, the game &quot;Turrican II&#x27;s&quot; underwater area (which was vertically distinct) has different colors. Others, such as Epyx&#x27;s &quot;Summer Games&quot; and &quot;COMPUTE!&#x27;s Gazette&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Basketball Sam &amp; Ed&quot;, overlay two high-resolution sprites to allow two foreground colors to be used without sacrificing horizontal resolution . Of course, this technique reduces the number of available sprites by half.

On PAL C64s, the PAL delay line in the monitor or TV which averages the color hue, but not the brightness, of consecutive screen lines can be used to create seven nonstandard colors by alternating screen lines showing two colors of identical brightness. There are seven such pairs of colors in the VIC chip.

The C64&#x27;s team did not spend much time on mathematically computing the 16 color palette. Robert Yannes, who was involved with the development of the VIC-II, said: &quot;I&#x27;m afraid that not nearly as much effort went into the color selection as you think. Since we had total control over hue, saturation and luminance, we picked colors that we liked. In order to save space on the chip, though, many of the colors were simply the opposite side of the color wheel from ones that we picked. This allowed us to reuse the existing resistor values, rather than having a completely unique set for each color.&quot;

Early versions of the VIC-II used in PAL C64s have a different color palette than later revisions.

The full palette of sixteen colors is generated based on variations of YPbPr signals as shown below:

===The VIC-IIe===

The 8564/8566 VIC-IIe in the Commodore 128 uses 48 pins rather than 40, as it produces more signals, among them the clock for the additional Zilog Z80 CPU of that computer. It also has two extra registers. One of the additional registers is for accessing the added numerical keypad and other extra keys of that computer; this function was added to the VIC merely because that proved to be the easiest place in the computer to add the necessary three extra output pins. The other extra register is for toggling between a 1 MHz and a 2 MHz system clock; at the higher speed the VIC-II&#x27;s video output is merely displaying every second byte in the code as black hires bit-pattern on the screen, suggesting use of the C128&#x27;s 80-column mode at that speed (via the 8563 VDC RGB chip). Rather unofficially, the two extra registers are also available in the C128&#x27;s C64 mode, permitting some use of the extra keys, as well as double-speed-no-video execution of CPU-bound code (such as intensive numerical calculations) in self-made C64 programs. The extra registers are also one source of minor incompatibility between the C128&#x27;s C64 mode and a real C64 - a few older C64 programs inadvertently wrote into the toggle bit, which would do nothing at all on a real C64, but would result in a messed-up display on a C128 in C64 mode.

The VIC-IIe has the little-known ability to create an additional set of colors by manipulating the registers in a specific way that puts the color signal out of phase with what other parts of the chip consider it to be in. This ability was demonstrated in the &quot;Risen from Oblivion&quot; demo. Unfortunately it does not work on all monitors - correct colors are confirmed on Commodore CRT monitors and their equivalents.

Using the specific behavior of the VIC-IIe&#x27;s test bit, it is furthermore capable of producing a real interlace picture with a resolution of 320×400 (hires mode) and 160×400 (multicolor mode).

==List of VIC-II versions ==
Commodore made many modifications to the VIC-II during its lifetime. &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot;″s first issue, in July 1983, reported that there had already been eight since the Commodore 64&#x27;s release in mid-1982.

The earliest revision of the VIC-II was used in machines made during 1982 and early 1983; it had a ceramic shell for thermal reasons and generated 64 NTSC color clocks per line. These chips also did not output separated chroma and luminance signals. Later revisions had a lower cost plastic shell and 65 color clocks per line (for NTSC, 63 for PAL), as well as separated chroma and luminance, allowing for an early form of S-video. Several revisions were made chiefly in the interest of improving video output quality, which was poor on the early units, and eliminating a bug that would cause random pixels to appear on screen (a few early games intentionally exploited this for graphics effects that consequently did not work on later C64s). The 64 color clocks on the initial VIC-II was done with the intention of allowing NTSC artifact color in high resolution bitmap mode as the Atari 8-bit computers did, but that idea was quickly dropped.

Because it was necessary for cost reasons to switch to a plastic shell, overheating tended to be a problem with the VIC-II. This was for several reasons including the high density of the die relative to the process used, and its high internal speed (8 MHz). Commodore tried an impromptu solution for this by using the aluminum RF shield as a heat sink (on NTSC machines; PAL machines were sold in countries with less restrictive RF interference standards than the United States and so only used aluminized cardboard), however it was not entirely effective at preventing overheating and chip failure.

The 85xx VIC-II used in C64Cs was made with the more modern 3.5 μm HMOS process and requires only a single 5V power rail instead of the dual 12V and 5V rails of the 65xx VIC-II. These chips run significantly cooler and do not suffer from the overheating issues that affect the 65xx VIC-II.

Several revisions of 6569 exist: 6569R1 (usually gold plated), 6569R3, 6569R4 and 6569R5. The most common version of 8565 is 8565R2.

<text>Crédit Agricole Group (), sometimes called La banque verte (, , due to its historical ties to farming), is a French international banking group and the world&#x27;s largest cooperative financial institution. It is the second largest bank in France, after BNP Paribas, as well as the third largest in Europe and tenth largest in the world. It consists of a network of Crédit Agricole local banks, 39 Agricole regional banks and a central institute, the Crédit Agricole S.A.. It is listed through Crédit Agricole S.A., as an intermediate holding company, on Euronext Paris&#x27; first market and is part of the CAC 40 stock market index. Local banks of the group owned the regional banks, in turn the regional banks majority owned the S.A. via a holding company, in turn the S.A. owned part of the subsidiaries of the group, such as LCL, the Italian network and the CIB unit. It is considered to be a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board.

It was the title sponsor of the Crédit Agricole professional road cycling team from 1998 to 2008.

Crédit Agricole has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.

== History==
In the second half of the 19th century, French farmers struggled to obtain long-term, flexible, reasonably-priced credit. There were several attempts to set up farming banks, including Crédit Foncier de France in 1861, but none were successful.

=== Birth of Crédit Agricole and creation of the local and regional banks 1894–1900 ===


Crédit Agricole can trace its history back to the end of the 19th century, specifically to the Act of 1884 establishing the freedom of professional association, which authorised, among other things, the creation of syndicat agricoles (farm unions) and the foundation of local mutual banks. &quot;Société de Crédit Agricole&quot; was created on 23 February 1885 at Salins-les-Bains in the district of Poligny in the Jura region. It was the first of its kind in France.

Drawing on this experience to promote lending to small family farms, the Act of 5 November 1894, which had the support of the Minister for Agriculture Jules Méline, paved the way for the creation of Crédit Agricole&#x27;s local banks. The first local banks were set up by local elites, including agronomists, teachers, and property owners, with farmers playing a minority role.

In the early years, business consisted exclusively of short-term loans provided as advances on harvests, enabling farmers to live more comfortably. Medium-term and long-term loans were added later, making it possible to buy equipment and livestock.

The 1894 Act did not confer any financial advantages, and the local banks soon faced financial problems, such as a lack of capital and insufficient collateral from small farmers. It was not until 1897 that the government addressed these problems by requiring the Banque de France to fund Crédit Agricole through an endowment of 40 million gold francs and an annual fee of 2 million francs. A year later, the Act of 1898 resolved the collateral issues. Meanwhile, the Act of 31 March 1899 instituted a commission within the Ministry for Agriculture to distribute the government advances between the regional banks, which were also created at this time. These cooperative entities brought together the local banks in their catchment area and acted as their clearing organisations.

=== Building nationwide coverage 1900–1945 ===
More and more local and regional banks were established from the turn of the century. Every region had at least one by the eve of the First World War. However, the government continued to provide three-quarters of the funding, and short-term lending still accounted for the lion&#x27;s share of business despite the authorisation to issue long-term loans granted by the Acts of 29 December 1906 and 19 March 1910. With some regions becoming isolated owing to the War, the need for a central bank to regulate business became more apparent, especially as Crédit Agricole was asked to provide financing to rebuild farming operations damaged during the conflict.

New legislation of 5 August 1920 established a public central clearing organisation for the regional banks: the Office National de Crédit Agricole (ONCA), with Louis Tardy as its chief executive officer, merging two services that were previously embedded in the Ministry of Agriculture. In 1926, the institution was renamed Caisse Nationale de Crédit Agricole (CNCA).

In the 1920s, the bank continued to build its nationwide coverage and expand its business activities, notably by introducing loans to small-scale rural craftsmen in 1920, financing rural electrification, and financing local authorities in rural areas from 1923.

Local and regional banks did not emerge from the 1930 crisis unscathed. The Caisse Nationale took on a greater role and aided the most heavily exposed banks. A joint deposit guarantee fund was set up in 1935. The following year, Crédit Agricole provided additional support by financing wheat stocks through discounting when the National Cereals Board (ONIC) was established. The payment mechanisms used helped to make cheques and bank accounts more popular in the countryside.

Between 1939 and 1945, the Vichy regime imposed stricter state supervision on Crédit Agricole. Major financial developments also took place at this time, including the creation of the five-year note.

=== Post-War period and creation of Fédération Nationale du Crédit Agricole 1945–1966 ===
To finance the post-war reconstruction and encourage the mechanisation of farming, CNCA stepped up deposit-taking to supplement the funds provided by the government. The regional banks opened many offices, with the total increasing from 1,000 in 1947 to 2,259 by 1967.

In 1959, Crédit Agricole was authorised by decree to finance property loans for primary residences in rural areas, irrespective of the status of the owner (even non-farmers). 

Crédit Agricole continued to modernise, with an influx of new managerial talent both in the regional banks and at CNCA. In 1960, became the first Chairman of CNCA to come from a farming background. He remained in this position for 14 years.

=== Birth of a universal bank 1966–1988 ===
In 1966, as part of efforts to boost savings and remove Crédit Agricole from its budget, the government gave CNCA financial autonomy. Savings inflows no longer passed through the Treasury, and CNCA was now responsible for balancing the surpluses and deficits of the regional banks. The 1971 &quot;Rurality Act&quot; extended Crédit Agricole&#x27;s potential financing sources to rural zones and to new types of customers, such as craftsmen and food producers. Lending to SMEs and mid-tier firms followed after.

The Banking Reform of 1966 allowed the organisation to offer households the same products as those provided by competitors, including passbook accounts and home savings plans.

The first subsidiaries were set up at the end of the 1960s to address the specific needs of CNCA: &quot;Union d&#x27;études et d&#x27;investissements&quot; (UI) was created in 1967 to make equity investments, followed by Segespar for asset management in 1968, and Unicrédit to grant loans to food producers in 1971. Crédit Agricole began distributing home purchase savings products from 1967, government-regulated mortgages from 1972 and first-time-buyer loans in 1977.

In 1976, the group adopted the slogan &quot;le bon sens près de chez vous&quot; (&quot;common sense close to home&quot;).

Crédit Agricole opened its first foreign branch, in Chicago, in 1979.

The group&#x27;s business diversification started in the 1980s. The life insurance subsidiary was set up in 1986, while property &amp; casualty unit was created in 1990. The group expanded into bancassurance, offering the first retirement savings plans. At this time, many local bank directors were also directors of Groupama, an insurer from the farming sector. There was talk of a merger between the two, but this did not come to pass.

=== Institutional changes 1988–2001 ===
On 18 January 1988, the CNCA Mutualisation Act came into force. CNCA was reincorporated into a public limited company, with a 90% stake sold to the regional banks and 10% to staff. Crédit Agricole became fully independent of the government, putting an end to the latter&#x27;s practice of skimming off surplus funds. In 1990, Crédit Agricole lost the monopoly on granting low-interest loans to farmers and one year later, in 1991, the &quot;normalisation&quot; process was completed as it was allowed to begin financing large corporations.

International expansion continued with the acquisition of stakes in Banco Ambrosiano Veneto in Italy in 1989 and Banco Espírito Santo in Portugal in 1991.

Consolidation among the regional banks began officially in 1990, with the aim of reducing costs. The aim was to halve the number of regional banks, and that objective had been surpassed by the turn of the 21st century. 

In 1993, Lucien Douroux, who led the plan to mutualise FNCA, became CNCA&#x27;s first chief executive officer, having been appointed by Crédit Agricole from existing staff.

In 1996, the group bought Banque Indosuez and then created Indocam, an asset management subsidiary (renamed Crédit Agricole Asset Management in 1999), and Crédit Agricole Indosuez for corporate and investment banking. In 1999, diversification continued as the group took a stake in the newly privatised Crédit Lyonnais, and acquired leading consumer finance company Sofinco.

CNCA was listed on the stock market in 2001 under the name Crédit Agricole S.A. This gave the regional banks a listed vehicle through which to carry out major acquisitions.

== Crédit Agricole in the 21st century ==
=== Business overview ===
The group&#x27;s acquisitions enabled it to strengthen its leadership in French retail banking, expand its position in corporate and investment banking and build up its international network of branches and subsidiaries. By now, the group was the number-one bank in France with 28% of the domestic market, the global number-two by revenues and number-ten by profits, according to Fortune magazine, and number-15 worldwide according to Forbes rankings.

=== Crédit Agricole and the 2008–2012 crisis ===
Although less negatively impacted than some rivals by the 2007–2008 financial crisis, when the interbank lending market seized up, Crédit Agricole was forced in January 2008 to sell its long-standing stake in Suez for €1.3 billion and then in May 2008 to organise a €5.9 billion rights issue to which all the regional banks subscribed to meet Basel II regulatory requirements. It also undertook a €5 billion programme of non-strategic asset disposals.

At the end of 2008, the government decided to loan France&#x27;s six largest banks €21 billion in two tranches, at an interest rate of 8%, to enable them to continue to play their role in the economy. Crédit Agricole did not take part in the second tranche and repaid the government in October 2009. Crédit Agricole&#x27;s crisis exit strategy was well received by the markets, with the share price gaining more than 40% over 2009.

In 2012, Crédit Agricole continued to report negative results, posting a loss of around €3 billion in the third quarter. The Greek branch Emporiki was separated from its profitable wealthy parts in Albania, Bulgaria and Romania which were integrated into the Crédit Agricole group. The whole investment into Emporiki cost around €9 billion. The remaining Greek part was sold off to Alpha Bank for €1. Crédit Agricole also withdrew totally from Spanish bank Bankinter, resulting in a book loss of €193 million, and took a massive €600 million write-down on consumer credit, notably owing to difficulties in Italy. Furthermore, Crédit Agricole had to write down the goodwill on its balance sheet. Goodwill amounted to €17.7 billion in September 2012, well above the actual value. In early February 2013, the bank announced that it would book €3.8 billion in writedowns and costs – a record amount according to the media.

=== Mergers and acquisitions from 2014 ===
In March 2014, the Crédit Agricole Group unveiled its medium-term strategic plan, which put the emphasis on retail banking, insurance and saving. Internationally, the group decided to refocus on its core markets, starting with Italy, the group&#x27;s second-largest market.

The Crédit Agricole Group sold its Bulgarian subsidiary to Corporate Commercial Bank for €160 million. On 22 April 2014, Crédit Agricole S.A., Crédit Agricole Nord and Crédit Agricole Nord-Est announced that they would sell 50% of their stake in Crelan S.A., a Belgian bank created out of the merger of Crédit Agricole Belgique and Centea, to Caisses coopératives belges by June 2015.

In 2017, the group bought three small Italian banks.

== Corporate governance ==
Crédit Agricole has a three-tier structure, comprising the local banks, the regional banks (and their branches and equity investments) and Crédit Agricole S.A. (and its subsidiaries). The local and regional banks are cooperative companies. Crédit Agricole S.A. is a &quot;société anonyme&quot;. Crédit Agricole is one of the leading cooperative companies in the world.

; Promoting employment for people with disabilities
Through an association set up to promote the employment of people with disabilities within Crédit Agricole (HECA), the Crédit Agricole regional banks devote resources to the recruitment, integration and continued employment of disabled workers. Measures include workstation modifications, transport facilities and training. Since a lack of training makes it harder for people with disabilities to get work, Crédit Agricole has set up work/study training programmes to enable people who have their high school diploma to receive post-secondary qualifications. The goal was to recruit more than 800 disabled persons between 2006 and end-2010, and by end-2009, more than 360 permanent contracts and 670 work/study contracts had been signed. Former Miss France runner-up Sophie Vouzelaud, who has been deaf from birth, is HECA&#x27;s official ambassador.

; Promoting the cooperative model
The regional banks help to promote the cooperative model locally through a variety of initiatives, such as the Perspectives Mutualistes conference series (Pau in 2006, Angers in 2007, Reims in 2008, Orléans in 2009), and by issuing special bank cards for stakeholders.

; Senior management of Crédit Agricole S.A.
* Chairman: Dominique Lefebvre
* CEO: Philippe Brassac

; Board of directors
The Board is made up of members elected by the annual general meeting, representatives of trade organisations, members elected by employees, a non-voting member and a representative of the Works Council.

; A complex structure
The regional banks own 54% of Crédit Agricole S.A., which in turn holds 25% of their capital in the form of non-voting cooperative securities (&quot;certificats coopératifs d&#x27;associés&quot;). An internal debate is continually underway on striking a balance between growing activities that serve the regional banks directly and promoting businesses that lie outside their sphere. Institutional investors, particularly in the UK and US, are not always at ease with this approach.

<doc id="440693" wikidata="Q2594423" url="?curid=440693" title="Lais of Marie de France">
<text>The &quot;lais&quot; of Marie de France are a series of twelve short narrative Breton lais by the poet Marie de France. They are written in Anglo-Norman and were probably composed in the late 12th century, most likely between 1155-1170. The short, narrative poems generally focus on glorifying the concept of courtly love by the adventures of their main characters. Marie&#x27;s lais are thought to form the basis for what would eventually become the genre known as the Breton lais. Despite her stature in Anglo-Norman literature and medieval French literature generally, little is known of Marie herself, but it is thought that she was born in France and wrote in England.

==Literacy characters==

Marie de France&#x27;s lais, told in octosyllables or eight-syllable verse, are notable for their celebration of love, individuality of character, and vividness of description, hallmarks of the emerging literature of the times. Five different manuscripts contain one or more of the lais, but only one, Harley 978, a 13th-century manuscript housed in the British Library, preserves all twelve. It has been suggested that if the author had indeed arranged the &quot;Lais&quot; as presented in Harley 978, she may have chosen this overall structure to contrast the positive and negative actions that can result from love. In this manuscript, the odd lais (&quot;Guigemar&quot;, &quot;Le Fresne&quot;, etc.) praise the characters who express love for other people. By comparison, the even lais, such as &quot;Equitan&quot;, &quot;Bisclavret&quot; and so on, warn how love that is limited to oneself can lead to misfortune.

The Harley 978 manuscript also includes a 56-line prologue in which Marie describes the impetus for her composition of the lais. In the prologue, Marie writes that she was inspired by the example of the ancient Greeks and Romans to create something that would be both entertaining and morally instructive. She also states her desire to preserve for posterity the tales that she has heard. Two of Marie&#x27;s lais, &quot;Lanval,&quot; a very popular work that was adapted several times over the years (including the Middle English &quot;Sir Launfal&quot;) and &quot;Chevrefoil&quot; (&quot;The Honeysuckle&quot;), a short composition about Tristan and Iseult, mention King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. Marie&#x27;s lais were precursors to later works on the subject, and she was probably a contemporary of Chrétien de Troyes, another writer of Arthurian tales.

==Influence==
Marie&#x27;s &quot;lais&quot; were among the first works translated into Old Norse, in which they (and a number of other &quot;lais&quot;) are known as the &quot;Strengleikar&quot;.

<text>In classical architecture, a colonnade is a long sequence of columns joined by their entablature, often free-standing, or part of a building. Paired or multiple pairs of columns are normally employed in a colonnade which can be straight or curved. The space enclosed may be covered or open. In St. Peter&#x27;s Square in Rome, Bernini&#x27;s great colonnade encloses a vast open elliptical space.

When in front of a building, screening the door (Latin &quot;porta&quot;), it is called a portico. When enclosing an open court, a peristyle. A portico may be more than one rank of columns deep, as at the Pantheon in Rome or the stoae of Ancient Greece. 

When the intercolumniation is alternately wide and narrow, a colonnade may be termed &quot;araeosystyle&quot; (Gr. αραιος, &quot;widely spaced&quot;, and συστυλος, &quot;with columns set close together&quot;), as in the case of the western porch of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and the east front of the Louvre.

== History ==

Colonnades (formerly as colonade) have been built since ancient times and interpretations of the classical model have continued through to modern times, and Neoclassical styles remained popular for centuries. At the British Museum, for example, porticos are continued along the front as a colonnade. The porch of columns that surrounds the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., (in style a &quot;peripteral&quot; classical temple) can be termed a colonnade. As well as the traditional use in buildings and monuments, colonnades are used in sports stadiums such as the Harvard Stadium in Boston, where the entire horseshoe-shaped stadium is topped by a colonnade. The longest colonnade in the United States, with 36 Corinthian columns, is the New York State Education Building in Albany, New York.

<doc id="440706" wikidata="Q2060528" url="?curid=440706" title="Neuroevolution">
<text>Neuroevolution, or neuro-evolution, is a form of artificial intelligence that uses evolutionary algorithms to generate artificial neural networks (ANN), parameters, and rules. It is most commonly applied in artificial life, general game playing and evolutionary robotics. The main benefit is that neuroevolution can be applied more widely than supervised learning algorithms, which require a syllabus of correct input-output pairs. In contrast, neuroevolution requires only a measure of a network&#x27;s performance at a task. For example, the outcome of a game (i.e., whether one player won or lost) can be easily measured without providing labeled examples of desired strategies. Neuroevolution is commonly used as part of the reinforcement learning paradigm, and it can be contrasted with conventional deep learning techniques that use backpropagation (gradient descent on a neural network) with a fixed topology.

==Features==

Many neuroevolution algorithms have been defined. One common distinction is between algorithms that evolve only the strength of the connection weights for a fixed network topology (sometimes called conventional neuroevolution), and algorithms that evolve both the topology of the network and its weights (called TWEANNs, for Topology and Weight Evolving Artificial Neural Network algorithms).

A separate distinction can be made between methods that evolve the structure of ANNs in parallel to its parameters (those applying standard evolutionary algorithms) and those that develop them separately (through memetic algorithms).

==Comparison with gradient descent==

Most neural networks use gradient descent rather than neuroevolution. However, around 2017 researchers at Uber stated they had found that simple structural neuroevolution algorithms were competitive with sophisticated modern industry-standard gradient-descent deep learning algorithms, in part because neuroevolution was found to be less likely to get stuck in local minima. In &quot;Science&quot;,
journalist Matthew Hutson speculated that part of the reason neuroevolution is succeeding where it had failed before is due to the increased computational power available in the 2010s.

It can be shown that there is a correspondence between neuroevolution and gradient descent.

==Direct and indirect encoding==

Evolutionary algorithms operate on a population of genotypes (also referred to as genomes). In neuroevolution, a genotype is mapped to a neural network phenotype that is evaluated on some task to derive its fitness.

In &quot;direct&quot; encoding schemes the genotype directly maps to the phenotype. That is, every neuron and connection in the neural network is specified directly and explicitly in the genotype. In contrast, in &quot;indirect&quot; encoding schemes the genotype specifies indirectly how that network should be generated.

Indirect encodings are often used to achieve several aims:
* modularity and other regularities;
* compression of phenotype to a smaller genotype, providing a smaller search space;
* mapping the search space (genome) to the problem domain.

===Taxonomy of embryogenic systems for indirect encoding===

Traditionally indirect encodings that employ artificial embryogeny (also known as artificial development) have been categorised along the lines of a &quot;grammatical approach&quot; versus a &quot;cell chemistry approach&quot;. The former evolves sets of rules in the form of grammatical rewrite systems. The latter attempts to mimic how physical structures emerge in biology through gene expression. Indirect encoding systems often use aspects of both approaches.

Stanley and Miikkulainen propose a taxonomy for embryogenic systems that is intended to reflect their underlying properties. The taxonomy identifies five continuous dimensions, along which any embryogenic system can be placed:
* Cell (neuron) fate: the final characteristics and role of the cell in the mature phenotype. This dimension counts the number of methods used for determining the fate of a cell.
* Targeting: the method by which connections are directed from source cells to target cells. This ranges from specific targeting (source and target are explicitly identified) to relative targeting (e.g., based on locations of cells relative to each other).
* Heterochrony: the timing and ordering of events during embryogeny. Counts the number of mechanisms for changing the timing of events.
* Canalization: how tolerant the genome is to mutations (brittleness). Ranges from requiring precise genotypic instructions to a high tolerance of imprecise mutation.
* Complexification: the ability of the system (including evolutionary algorithm and genotype to phenotype mapping) to allow complexification of the genome (and hence phenotype) over time. Ranges from allowing only fixed-size genomes to allowing highly variable length genomes.

==Examples==

Examples of neuroevolution methods (those with direct encodings are necessarily non-embryogenic):
