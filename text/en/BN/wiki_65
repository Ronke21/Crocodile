<text>Stephanus van Cortlandt (May 7, 1643 – November 25, 1700) was the first native-born mayor of New York City, a position which he held from 1677 to 1678 and from 1686 to 1688. He was the patroon of Van Cortlandt Manor and was on the governor&#x27;s executive council from 1691 to 1700. He was the first resident of Sagtikos Manor in West Bay Shore on Long Island, which was built around 1697. A number of his descendants married English military leaders and Loyalists active in the American Revolution, and their descendants became prominent members of English society.

== Early life ==
Stephanus van Cortlandt was born on May 7, 1643, the son of Captain Olof Stevense van Cortlandt. His father had been born at Wijk bij Duurstede, in the Dutch Republic, and in 1637 arrived in New Amsterdam. Beginning as a soldier and bookkeeper, Olof Stevense van Cortland rose to high office in the colonial service of the Dutch West India Company, serving many terms as burgomaster and alderman before dying in 1684. His mother, nicknamed &quot;Anna&quot;, was Annetje ( Loockermans) van Cortlandt (born Turnhout; March 17, 1618), who may have been the person who began the &quot;Santa Claus&quot; tradition in America.

His parents had four children: Stephanus van Cortlandt (1643–1700); Jacobus van Cortlandt (1658–1739), who married Eva de Vries Philipse (born 1660); Maria van Cortlandt, who married Jeremias van Rensselaer (1632–1674); and Catherine van Cortlandt, who married firstly Johannes Derval and secondly, after his death, Frederick Philipse (1626–1702), the first lord of Philipsborough Manor. Philipse was previously married to Margaret Hardenbroeck (1637–1691) and during that marriage, had adopted her daughter, Eva de Vries (born 1660), who thus took the name of Philipse. Eva&#x27;s father and Margaret&#x27;s first husband was Peter Rudolphus de Vries (died 1661).

==Career==
In 1668, he was appointed ensign of one of the militia companies of New York City. In 1677, he was appointed by the English Governor of the Province of New York to a two-year term as mayor of New York City, the first who had been born in America. Although of Dutch parentage, he was reportedly appointed due to his intelligence, and social position in the community. In 1685, he joined partners Francis Rombouts and Jacobus Kip in being awarded what became known as the Rombout Patent to lands along the Hudson River in what is today&#x27;s southern Dutchess County.

During his time in office, van Cortland remained an adherent of the aristocratic Whig party, especially during Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion from 1689 to 1691. When Delanoy, the Leisler candidate, was elected to the mayoralty, in place of Van Cortland, the latter refused to deliver up the city seal. It has been said that when a committee came to his home, his wife shut the door in their faces.

==Personal life==
Van Cortlandt married Gertruj van Schuyler (b. 1654), the daughter of Philip Pieterse Schuyler and the sister of Pieter Schuyler (a colonial governor of New York and mayor of Albany). They lived at the &quot;Waterside,&quot; on the present line of Pearl street, near Broad, where he engaged in business as a merchant. Together, they had:
* Johannes Van Cortlandt (1672–1702), who married Anna Maria Van Schaick.
** Gertrude Van Cortlandt (1697–1766), who married Philip Verplanck, a grandson of Gulian Verplanck.
* Margaretta Van Cortlandt (b. 1674), who married Judge Samuel Bayard, the son of Nicholas Bayard and a descendant of the Stuyvesant family. A number of their descendants were Loyalists who relocated to England. 
* Anne van Cortlandt (1676–1724), who married Stephen DeLancey (1663–1741).
* Catherine Van Cortlandt, who married New Jersey politician Andrew Johnston (1694-1762), the son of John Johnstone (1661–1732), the 32nd Mayor of New York City.
* Elizabeth Van Cortlandt, who married the Rev. William Skinner.
* Philip Van Cortlandt (1683–1746), who married Catherine de Peyster (1688-1766), daughter of Abraham de Peyster the 20th Mayor of New York City and his wife Catharine de Peyster. Philip and Catherine had six children: 
** Stephen (1714–1756), who married Mary Walton Ricketts in 1738.
** Abraham (1713–1745)
** Philip (1715–1745)
** John (1718–1747)
** Pierre Van Cortlandt (1721–1814), first Lt. Governor of the State of New York, who married his second cousin, Joanna Livingston (1722–1808), daughter of Cornelia Beekman (1693–1742), niece of Gerardus Beekman and granddaughter of Wilhelmus Beekman, and Gilbert Livingston (1690–1746), a son of Robert Livingston the Elder and Alida Schuyler; 
** Catherine Van Cortlandt (1725–1735), who died young.

Stephanus Van Cortlandt died in New York on November 25, 1700.

===Descendants===
His granddaughter, Gertrude Bayard, married Peter Kemble (1704–1789), a prominent New Jersey businessman and politician, and his great-granddaughter, Margaret Kemble (1734–1824), married Thomas Gage (1718/19–1787) who was General of the British Army during the American Revolutionary War. Descendants of this union are found in England, including amongst the Viscount Gages and the noble Bertie family in England (including those holding the title of Earls of Abingdon). 

A grandson, James DeLancey (1703–1760) became New York Governor, and granddaughter Susannah DeLancey (1707–1771) married Vice-Admiral Sir Peter Warren (1703–1752). Another grandson, Oliver De Lancey Sr. (1718–1785) married Phila Franks, daughter of a prominent New York Jewish family.

Grandson, Lt. General William Skinner, was an American Revolutionary Loyalist whose son, Brig. Gen. Cortlandt Skinner (1727–1799) was also a Loyalist who married Elizabeth Kearney (1731–1810). Another grandson, Pierre Van Cortlandt (1721–1814) was the 1st Lieutenant Governor of New York who married to Joanna Livingston (granddaughter of Robert Livingston). Their descendants include Philip Van Cortlandt (1749-1831) and Pierre Van Cortlandt, Jr. (1762–1848).

It was revealed on a 2024 episode of &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; that the American writer, director, actor, and producer Lena Dunham (b. 1986) is a descendant of Stephanus van Cortlandt.

<doc id="439014" wikidata="Q1146238" url="?curid=439014" title="Dinorwig Power Station">
<text>The Dinorwig Power Station (; ), known locally as Electric Mountain, or Mynydd Gwefru, is a pumped-storage hydroelectric scheme, near Dinorwig, Llanberis in Snowdonia national park in Gwynedd, north Wales. The scheme can supply a maximum power of and has a storage capacity of around .

== Purpose ==

The scheme was built at a time when responsibility for electricity generation in England and Wales was in the hands of the government&#x27;s Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB); with the purpose of providing peak capacity, very rapid response, energy storage and frequency control. Dinorwig&#x27;s very rapid response capability significantly reduced the need to hold spinning reserve on part loaded thermal plant. When the plant was conceived the CEGB used low efficiency old coal and oil fired capacity to meet peaks in demand. More efficient 500MW thermal sets were introduced in the 1960s, initially for baseload operation only. Dinorwig could store cheap energy produced at night by low marginal cost plant and then generate during times of peak demand, so displacing low efficiency plant during peak demand periods.

There were plans for a pumped storage facility near Exmoor but it was not built. With the increase of renewables such as wind and solar power, the need for storage is expected to increase to deal with intermittency. A 50 MW pumped storage facility at nearby Glyn Rhonwy in disused slate pits was approved in 2013, with an expected cost of £120 million. As of 2019, this project has reached the &quot;detailed engineering design&quot; stage.

Dinorwig is operated not only to help meet peak loads but also as a short term operating reserve (STOR), providing a fast response to short-term rapid changes in power demand or sudden loss of power stations. In a common scenario (known as TV pickup), the end of a popular national television programme or advertising breaks in commercial television programmes results in millions of consumers switching on electric kettles in the space of a few minutes, leading to overall demand increases of up to 2,800MW.

==Financial case==
In 2016 it was suggested that in Britain&#x27;s open energy market the financial justification for pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES) was hard to quantify. Arbitrage allows PHES operators to charge high prices for energy supplied at short notice when demand is high but studies suggest that revenue from sales alone, even at peak prices, does not warrant the initial investment; projections for similar projects indicate a payback time of up to forty years. Additionally, however, Dinorwig PHES receives a steady income for maintaining a permanent on-call capacity for urgent frequency regulation; in 2016 this was approximately £10.8million.

== Construction ==
The scheme was constructed under the terms of the North Wales Hydro Electric Power Act 1973. It was constructed in the abandoned Dinorwic slate quarry. To preserve the natural beauty of Snowdonia National Park, the power station itself is located deep inside the mountain Elidir Fawr, inside tunnels and caverns. The project – begun in 1974 and taking ten years to complete at a cost of £425million – was the largest civil engineering contract ever awarded by the UK government at the time. The work was undertaken by an Alfred McAlpine / Brand / Zschokke consortium. Twelve million tonnes (12,000,000longtons; 13,000,000shorttons) of rock had to be moved from inside the mountain, creating tunnels wide enough for two lorries to pass comfortably and an enormous cavern tall, long, and wide known as &quot;the concert hall&quot;.

The power station is connected to the National Grid substation at Pentir by 400kV cables that are buried for approximately , rather than using transmission towers or pylons to transmit the electricity across an area of outstanding natural beauty.

==Specification==
The power station comprises six 300MW GEC generator/motors coupled to Francis-type reversible turbines. The generators are vertical-shaft, salient-pole, air-cooled units each having 12 electromagnetic poles weighing 10tonnes each, producing a terminal voltage of 18kV; synchronous speed is 500rpm. From standstill, a single 450-tonne generator can synchronise and achieve full load in approximately 75seconds. With all six units synchronised and spinning-in-air (water is dispelled by compressed air and the unit draws a small amount of power to spin the shaft at full speed), 0MW to 1800MW load can be achieved in approximately 16seconds. Once running, at full flow, the station can provide power for up to six hours before running out of water.

The energy storage capacity of the station is approximately 9.1GWh. At peak output water flows through the generators at per second (about the volume of a swimming pool every second).

== Operation ==
Water is stored at above sea level in Marchlyn Mawr reservoir. When power needs to be generated, water from the reservoir is sent down through the turbines into Llyn Peris, which is at approximately . Water is pumped back from Llyn Peris to Marchlyn Mawr during off-peak times. Although it uses more energy to pump the water up than is generated on the way down, pumping is generally done when electricity is cheaper and generation when it is more expensive.

The plant runs on average at 74–76% efficiency. It fills an important need in the system by responding to sudden surges in electricity demand because of its rapid ability to deliver power on load spikes. One of the alternatives would be to have spare capacity from conventional power stations running part loaded (&quot;spinning reserve&quot;), hence at lower efficiency than otherwise, and thus capable of being rapidly run up to full load. Other forms of power plant compete in this market for reserve power such as gas turbines and diesel generators for the National Grid Reserve Service.

Excess water will overflow to Llyn Padarn and is then lost from the reservoir system. Both Llyn Peris and Llyn Padarn were ancestral homes to the Arctic char, a rare fish in the United Kingdom. When the scheme was commissioned, a fish rescue was undertaken to transfer the char from Llyn Peris to other local suitable lakes and it is believed that due to the very variable water levels in Llyn Peris, Arctic char are now absent from the lake.

== Tourism ==
The power station was also promoted as a tourist attraction, with visitors able to take a minibus trip from &quot;Electric Mountain&quot; – the name of its nearby visitor centre in Llanberis – to see the workings inside the power station; 132,000 people visited the attraction in 2015. In 2021, First Hydro Company announced that tours inside the power station would cease and the visitor centre would close, and then that the visitor centre would be demolished in 2023.

<text>International Rifle events that occur in three positions are conducted with an equal number of shots fired from the Kneeling, Prone and Standing positions, although the order has changed over the years. Each of the three positions shot during the match has a fixed time limit that the shooter is able to shoot unlimited numbers of sighting shots and 10 or 20 shots for record.

In qualification rounds, shots are scored as integers, so each shot scores from 0-10 with no decimal points, while in finals shots are scored as decimal values (i.e. 9.8 instead of what would have been a 9 under integer scoring.) The center of the bullseye is commonly the 10 and the score drops points as it distances from the center. It is up to the organization&#x27;s discretion to score using outside ring or inside ring scoring. Outside ring scoring measures what ring the hole breaks and measures accordingly. Inside ring scoring scores by determining whether the hole breaks the inside line of the bullseye.

== Types of three positions matches ==
The International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) recognizes four three-position events. Two of these events, both called 50 m Rifle, are shot in the Olympics, one for men, the other for women. The two Olympic events are shot with a rimfire rifle at 50m. The two three-position events not in the Olympics, 300 m Rifle and 300 m Standard Rifle, are shot with a centerfire rifle at a distance of 300m.

For the Olympic events, up until the 2016 Olympic Games, men would shoot a 3 X 40, or rather 40 shots in prone, 40 shots in standing, and 40 shots in kneeling, and women a 3 X 20, 20 shots in each position. This is considered the qualification round, and shots are scored as integers. In January 2018, these rules were changed so that men and women now both shoot a 3x40. The maximum qualification score is 1200. This will first be seen in the Olympic Games in 2020. Following the qualification round, the top eight shooters participate in a final. Previously, this would consist of an additional 10 shots in the standing position, with the winner of the match being the shooter with the highest aggregate in both the qualification round and the final. However, in 2013 a new finals format was introduced, still for the top eight shooters in the qualification round. Both men and women shoot an additional 45 shots - 15 in each position - and qualification scores are discarded. The 15 shots in kneeling position come first, followed by the 15 prone shots, then once 10 standing shots have been fired, the two lowest-ranking shooters are eliminated, then after every single shot thereafter the lowest-ranked shooter is again eliminated until the 15th shot decides the gold and silver medalists.

The two non-Olympic 300m three position events are shot historically by men only. The first course of fire is with a free rifle, for a 3 X 40. The second course of fire is with a standard rifle, for a 3 X 20. Neither of these events have a final. The 300m events are no longer in the Olympics primarily due to the price of constructing a 300m range.

In the United States, a coalition of the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP), USA Shooting, JROTC, 4-H, and the American Legion recognize three position events for juniors using air rifles. The course of fire is a 3 X 20, or 3 X 10, depending on the organization and location, with the top eight shooters competing in a final. The winner is again the shooter with the highest aggregate between the qualification round and the final. In most cases junior shooting is done at either 10m or 50 ft. distances. The CMP manages these matches for the National Three-Position Air Rifle Council, and recognizes the best junior shooters via the Distinguished program.

== Shooting a three Position Match ==
At the beginning of a standard match the range officer will go over the rules of the range and the competition. They will state the course of fire and any change over times. In between each string of shooting the range will generally give about 10-minute change over time to get ready for the next position. During this time shooters can get their spotting scope set up, adjust rifle butt plates, or anything else without handling or shouldering the rifle. In addition to this time the range officer may also give a three-minute prep time for shooters to shoulder their rifle and do their last changes before the string starts. When the range officer gives the command to commence firing the timer is started for the match being shot. Shooters start by shooting sighting shots to ensure the rifle is sighted in and boost the confidence of the shooter. Shooters use a simple spotting scope to review their shots and adjust accordingly. The scopes come very useful for seeing any patterns with their shots or any missed bulls eyes. When the shooter has finished shooting all the shots for record they must wait for the range officer instructions to begin preparing for the next position.

== Types ==
The kneeling, prone and standing positions all are equally as important when shooting a three position match. Each count for the same number of points and have specific guidelines for each position. In ISSF three position matches, the first position is kneeling, followed by prone and then standing. 

=== Kneeling ===

The first position in a three positions match is the kneeling position. Shooters generally use a kneeling roll and place it under the rear foot while aiming downrange. They sit on their rear foot and the other foot is pointed downrange. Shooters are allowed to use a sling just like the prone position. This sling is extremely important for creating a stable position. For many shooters kneeling begins as a struggle. With practice each shooter finds different keys for their position to make the most comfortable and stable position. There is a great fluctuation in scores and often depends on the stability and comfort of the shooters position.

=== Prone ===

The prone position comes second in the match and is often the first learned shooting position. The prone position is the easiest to master and is often easy to sight in rifles using this position due to its stability. The added stability that this position gives the shooter makes this position, in most cases, the easiest to learn and typically is the highest scoring string of the match. Shooters are able to use a “sling” to support the rifle. The sling is a belt like device that goes around the non-shooting bicep and wraps around the wrist and attaches to the handstop of the rifle. This gives support so the sling holds up the weight instead of your arms.

=== Standing ===
The standing position is the final part of the three position match. This position is the hardest to master in most cases. Most competitors have a standing stand that they rest the rifle on then pick up to aim down range. The standing position is a freestanding position. For more stability it is common for shooters to place a fist or grip the rifle near or under the trigger guard and place their forearm against their body. Natural point of aim is especially crucial in this position. Natural point of aim is where your body is naturally aiming at while aiming downrange. If shooters fight their natural point of aim it is very difficult to stay stable and make a good shot. There are many tricks for finding a shooters natural point of aim and can be very difficult to teach to new shooters.

<text>Toxteth is an inner-city area of Liverpool in the county of Merseyside.

Toxteth is located to the south of Liverpool city centre, bordered by Aigburth, Canning, Dingle, and Edge Hill.

The area was originally part of a royal park and known as Toxteth Park. It remained predominantly rural up until the 18th century. Toxteth was then developed during this time and into the 19th century, mainly as a residential area to accommodate the increasing working-class community centred on Liverpool following the Industrial Revolution. The Welsh Streets in Toxteth were constructed in the mid-19th century to accommodate this demand. Immigration continued into the 20th century, resulting in a significant number of ethnic minority communities in the area.

Toxteth was badly hit by economic stagnation and unemployment in the late 1970s, culminating in riots in July 1981. Although attempts have been made to regenerate the area and improve living standards, significant problems with unemployment and crime remain into the 21st century. Many Victorian properties in the area continue to lie derelict awaiting redevelopment.

==Description==
The district lies within the borders of the ancient township of Toxteth Park. Industry and commerce are confined to the docks on its western border and a few streets running off Parliament Street. Toxteth is primarily residential, with a mixture of old terraced housing, post-World War II social housing and a legacy of large Victorian houses.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, as Liverpool expanded the ancient park of Toxteth was gradually urbanised. Large Georgian houses were built in the Canning area, followed in the Victorian era by more grand houses, especially along the tree-lined Prince&#x27;s Road/Avenue boulevard and around Prince&#x27;s Park. The district quickly became home to the wealthy merchants of Liverpool, alongside a much larger poor population in modest Victorian terraces. Now, some of these streets of terraces are boarded up, awaiting demolition.

Two of the city&#x27;s largest parks, Sefton Park and Princes Park, are located in or around Toxteth. The earlier Princes Park was laid out by Richard Vaughan Yates around 1840, intending it to be used as open space, funded by the grand houses to be constructed around its edge, as would later happen with Sefton Park. Sefton Park was created by the Corporation of Liverpool in 1872, inspired partly by Birkenhead Park, across the River Mersey. Sefton Park has a large glass Palm House, which contains a statue of William Rathbone V unveiled in 1887, and originally had many other features including an aviary and an open-air theatre.

==History==
===Toponymy===
There is some ambiguity as to the origin of the name. One theory is that the etymology is &quot;Toki&#x27;s landing-place&quot;. However, Toxteth is mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, and at this time, it appears as &quot;Stochestede&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot; &quot;the stockaded or enclosed place&quot;, from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;stocc&quot; &quot;stake&quot; and Anglo-Saxon &quot;stede&quot; &quot;place&quot; (found in many English placenames, usually spelled &quot;stead&quot;).

===The manor===
Before the time of the Norman conquest, Toxteth was divided into two manors of equal size. One was owned by Bernulf and the other by Stainulf. After the conquest, part was granted by Count Roger of Poitou to the ancestor of the Earl of Sefton. From this time to about 1604, the land formed part of West Derby forest. The boundaries of the manor are described in the perambulation of 1228 as follows, &quot;&#x27;Where Oskell&#x27;s brook falls into the Mersey; up this brook to Haghou meadow, from this to Brummesho, following the syke to Brumlausie, and across by the old turbaries upon two meres as far as Lombethorn; from this point going down to the &#x27;waterfall&#x27; of the head of Otter pool, and down this pool into the Mersey.&quot; In 1327, Toxteth was granted to Henry, Earl of Lancaster.

Over the years, various leases and grants were made and the park was owned by Adam, son of William de Liverpool, in 1338. In 1385, William de Liverpool had licence &quot;to take two cartloads of gorse weekly from the park for 12d. a year rent.&quot; In 1383 a grant was made to William Bolton and Robert Baxter, in 1394 the lease was resigned and handed over to Richard de Molyneux. The park finally came into the hands of Sir Thomas Stanley in 1447. The parkland descended within the Stanley family until 1596, when it was sold by William Stanley, Earl of Derby, to Edmund Smolte and Edward Aspinwall. In 1604, the Earl sold it to Richard Molyneux of Sefton at a cost of £1,100. The estate descended from this time until 1972 with the death of the 7th Earl.

===Toxteth Park===

The ancient township of Toxteth contains the village of &quot;Smeedon&quot; or &quot;Smithdown&quot;. It stretches over an area of three miles along the River Mersey and two miles inland, the highest point being on the corner of Smithdown Lane and Lodge Lane. A brook ran from the northern end of the area, near the boundary of Parliament Street, where it was used to power a water wheel before it ran into the river. Along the river are two creeks; the one near the middle is known as Knot&#x27;s Hole, and another further south, called Dickinson&#x27;s Dingle, received a brook which ran past the east end of St Michael&#x27;s Church, Aigburth.

At some time in history the creeks were filled in. The Dingle is now in the area where the old northern creek was situated, and St Michael&#x27;s Hamlet is situated around the southern creek. Outside the southern boundary of the area lies the creek known as Otterspool, which formed the boundary between Wavertree and West Derby. The major road through the area was Park Lane, now Park Place and Park Road. The road ran from the Coffee House, which stood near Fairview Place, down towards the Dingle, and the &quot;Ancient Chapel of Toxteth&quot;.

Toward the end of the 16th century, the royal park ceased to be and Puritan farmers from Bolton settled in the area. Setting up 25 farms on land outside Church of England control, which became Toxteth Village, these Dissenters worshipped at the &quot;Ancient Chapel&quot; on Park Road, now known as the Toxteth Unitarian Chapel (not to be confused with Ullet Road Unitarian Church, in Toxteth, south Liverpool). In 1611, they built a school at the Dingle, appointing Richard Mather as schoolmaster. Some years later, he began preaching to the local farmers in the chapel. Toxteth Town Hall, which as &quot;Toxteth Park Public Offices&quot; was the municipal centre of Toxteth Park, was completed in 1866.

In 1796, the Herculaneum Pottery was established on the site of an old copper works. The site later became Herculaneum Dock, which was filled in during the 1980s.

The Pavilion Theatre opened on Lodge Lane in 1908, and hosted a Beatles concert in 1962. It later became a bingo hall and then a supermarket.

===Smithdown===
Smithdown, referred to as &quot;Esmedune&quot; in the Domesday Book, and variously as &quot;Smededon&quot;, &quot;Smeddon&quot;, &quot;Smethesdune&quot;, &quot;Smethedon&quot;, &quot;Smethdon&quot;, &quot;Smethden&quot;, has been merged into Toxteth Park since the granting of the Liverpool Charter in 1207. The definite boundaries of Smithdown have never been fully recorded, but the name continued in use from 1207 until the 16th century, although it is thought to have reached from Lodge Lane to the eastern boundary of Toxteth Park. In 1066, Smithdown was held as a separate manor, by Ethelmund. During the reign of King John the Manor of Smithdown was taken from its owner, and the king gave him Thingwall instead.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War, the Free French 13th Demi Brigade of the French Foreign Legion were stationed in Toxteth. On 30 August 1940, the Demi Brigade departed Liverpool for operations against Vichy forces that would include the abortive Battle of Dakar and the storming of Libreville.

==Places of worship==

As the area began to develop and become more urbanised, several places of worship were built to serve the growing community. The first church was St James&#x27;s, in 1774. Other churches built during the 19th century include St Patrick&#x27;s, 1827; St John the Baptist&#x27;s, 1832; St Thomas&#x27;s, 1840; St Barnabas&#x27;s, 1841; St Clement&#x27;s Windsor, 1841; St Matthew&#x27;s, 1847; St Paul&#x27;s, 1848; Holy Trinity, 1858; St Silas&#x27;s, 1865; St Cleopas&#x27;s, 1866; St Margaret&#x27;s, 1869; Christ Church, 1870; St Philemon&#x27;s, 1874; Our Lady of Mount Carmel, 1878; All Saints&#x27;, 1884; St Gabriel&#x27;s, 1884; St Agnes&#x27;s, 1884; St Bede&#x27;s, 1886; and St Andrew&#x27;s, 1893;.

In addition, the following may be considered landmarks: the Welsh Presbyterian Church, nicknamed &quot;Toxteth Cathedral&quot;, 1868; the Ullet Road Unitarian Church, 1899, &quot;one of the most elaborate Non-conformist ensembles in the country&quot;; the Church of St. Agnes and St. Pancras, also in Ullet Road; the Church of St Clare on the corner of Arundel Avenue and York Avenue, and the Princes Road Synagogue, 1874, &quot;impressively combining Gothic revival and Moorish revival architecture&quot;. The Al-Rahma Mosque on Hatherley Street opened in 2008.

==Politics==
Politically, Toxteth is within the parliamentary constituency of Liverpool Riverside. In the 2019 United Kingdom general election, Kim Johnson of the Labour Party, was elected the Member of Parliament. The council ward is Princes Park, and has three Labour councillors.

==Demographics==
After the end of World War II, Toxteth became a popular destination for Commonwealth immigrants who arrived in Liverpool from the West Indies and the Indian subcontinent.

Immigration to Toxteth has taken place from the 19th century with the arrival of African and Chinese sailors and thousands of Irish Catholic and Welsh migrants, to the present day, most recently from the Caribbean, Yemen and Somalia with relatively few from the Indian sub-continent. The area has a very large community of mixed ethnicity as a result.

== Unrest and crime ==

The economic decline of Britain during the 1970s and early 1980s hit Toxteth and most of the rest of Liverpool particularly hard, leaving it with some of the highest unemployment rates in the country. Crime increased as a result. The standard of housing in both the public and private sector also declined, which would lead to eventual widespread demolition and refurbishment.

July 1981 saw riots in which dozens of young males clashed with police, resulting in numerous injuries on both sides as well as extensive damage to properties and vehicles. Poverty, unemployment, racial tension, racism and hostility towards the police were largely blamed for the disturbances, which were among the worst scenes of unrest seen during peacetime in Britain. Hundreds of people were injured, one man was killed by a police Land Rover, and numerous buildings and vehicles were damaged. This wave of rioting was perhaps the most prominent of a series of riots which other inner city areas during the spring and summer of 1981, with Brixton in London being the scene of another similarly violent riot.

A second, less serious riot occurred in Toxteth on 1 October 1985. This was largely overshadowed by the riots which occurred that autumn in the Handsworth area of Birmingham and the Tottenham area of London.

Vehicle crime has also blighted Toxteth since around 1980. A notable tragedy occurred on 30 October 1991, when two children (nine-year-old Daniel Davies and 12-year-old Adele Thompson) were fatally injured by a speeding sportscar driven by 18-year-old joyrider Christopher Lewin in Granby Street. Lewin was found guilty on a double manslaughter charge at Liverpool Crown Court on 24 September 1992 and sentenced to seven and a half years in prison, as well as being banned from driving for seven years. At the end of his trial, relatives and friends of the two victims pelted him with missiles and threatened to attack him. Five of them were ejected from the court.

With Toxteth still fresh in the mind of British people a decade after the 1981 riots, it was reported in the international media during December 1991 that the area still suffered from many of the problems that were said to have triggered the original riots, and some local residents claimed that things had gone from bad to worse. Despite the efforts of community groups and other services to help train young people for jobs, youth unemployment in the area was reported to be above 50%.
In April 1994, &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper highlighted that Toxteth was still one of the most deprived areas in Britain, with unemployment in some districts exceeding 40%, and theft, drug abuse and violent crime abundant.

A third wave of rioting broke out in Toxteth on the evening of 8 August 2011 at a time when riots flared across England. This was again overshadowed by worse riots happening in Birmingham and London. Vehicles and wheelie bins were set alight in the district, as well as in nearby Dingle and Wavertree, and a number of shops were looted. Two police officers suffered minor injuries as a result of the rioting. It was brought under control in the early hours of the following morning.
Individuals arrested and charged were from addresses all across the city, with Toxteth residents being a clear minority.
Just like in 1991, once again at a time when unemployment and social unrest were high as a result of a recession, various districts of London were even more affected by this wave of national rioting than Liverpool.

== Regeneration ==
Much of the area continues to suffer from poverty and urban degradation. House prices reflect this; in summer 2003, the average property price was just £45,929 (compared to the national average of £160,625).

Despite government-led efforts to regenerate Toxteth after the 1981 riots, few of the area&#x27;s problems appeared to have improved by 1991, by which time joyriding had also become a serious problem; on 30 October that year, a 12-year-old was killed by a speeding stolen car on Granby Street, seriously injuring a nine-year-old who died in hospital from his injuries six days later.

By the time of the riot&#x27;s 20th anniversary in July 2001, it was reported that many of the issues which contributed to the riots were still rife; not least unemployment and racial tension, as well as a decline in the sense of community in some neighbourhoods. Urban dereliction and gun crime remained a significant problem. However, there had already been some significant improvements by this stage, including the rebuilding of the Rialto complex (which was destroyed in the 1981 riot) as a mix of retail, residential and commercial properties.

Housing in Toxteth tends to be in terraces but there is a growing number of flats available as larger Victorian properties are broken up into separate dwellings. This is particularly the case in Canning, and around Princes Park.

Extensive regeneration has taken place in Toxteth over the last few years, including demolition of many of the Victorian terraces in the area. This has created much new development but also scarred the area with cleared sites and derelict streets. There has been strong local opposition to demolition of the Granby Triangle and the Welsh Streets, attracting extensive coverage in the national media and ultimately the Granby Four Streets were removed from the clearance plans. In 2015 a community regeneration initiative which involved a collaboration between a Community Land Trust, Steinbeck Studios and the artists collective Assemble was nominated for the Turner Prize. The prize was awarded to Assemble in December 2015.

===Welsh Streets===

By 1850, over 20,000 Welsh builders worked in Liverpool who required housing and land in Toxteth was leased for housing development. The Welsh Streets were designed by Richard Owens and built by David Roberts, Son and Co. Through this collaboration, Owens designed over 10,000 terraced houses in the city of Liverpool, particularly those in the surrounding Toxteth area where the Welsh Streets are located. The streets were named after Welsh towns, valleys and villages and were built for Welsh migrants, by Welsh builders. Musician Ringo Starr was born in 9 Madryn Street, where he lived until the age of 4 before moving to 10 Admiral Grove.

Council survey data published in 2005 showed the Welsh Streets were broadly popular with residents and in better than average condition, but were condemned for demolition because of a perceived &#x27;over-supply&#x27; of &#x27;obsolete&#x27; terraced houses in Liverpool. The proposals have divided the local community. Following unsuccessful demolition plans in 2013, Voelas Street was the first in 2017 to be fully refurbished and offered for rent to tenants. Popularity of the scheme would determine whether further regeneration of the other streets would be undertaken, with later refurbishment work undertaken on Rhiwlas Street, Powis Street, Madryn Street, and Kinmel Street.

==Parks==
Toxteth has two parks within its borders:
* Sefton Park, one of the last remnants of the royal hunting park. The park was designed by French landscape architect Édouard André.
* Princes Park, first major park created by Joseph Paxton.

==Landmarks==

==Transport==
===Rail===
The local railway station is Brunswick, located on Sefton Street in the south-western extremity of the district. The station is on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network with trains departing to Southport via Liverpool city centre and to Hunts Cross.

St. James Station is a disused railway station in Toxteth. It was located at the corner of St. James Place and Parliament Street, on the Merseyrail Northern Line. This station is in a deep cutting, cut into the Northern Line tunnel, being in effect an underground station with no roof. It was closed in 1917 as being too near to the terminus at Liverpool Central High Level railway station. Liverpool City Region Combined Authority announced in August 2019 that they were planning to use part of a £172m funding package to reopen the station, subject to the plans being approved. The station is well located to serve the Liverpool Echo Arena at King&#x27;s Dock and Liverpool Cathedral.

Sefton Park railway station, another disused station, was located at Smithdown Road and Garmoyle Road in nearby Wavertree. The station was closed to passengers in 1960. The station is on the West Coast Main Line Spur with Merseyrail trains running through from Liverpool South Parkway and Lime Street stations.

===Buses===
Toxteth is well served with bus routes.

<text>Allen Fisher (born 1944) is a poet, painter, publisher, teacher and performer associated with the British Poetry Revival.

Fisher was born in London and started writing poetry in 1962. In the late 1960s, he was involved with Fluxshoe, the United Kingdom offshoot of Fluxus, and performance has remained an important part of his practice. He established himself as a poet through his early, decade-long, poetry project &quot;Place&quot;, which was published in a series of books and pamphlets during the 1970s. This project which drew, in part, on the Olson tradition of &#x27;open field&#x27; projective verse poetics and, in part, on the procedural tradition of poets like Jackson Mac Low, was one of the major works of the British Poetry Revival, although it wasn&#x27;t published as a single volume until 2005, when it was brought out by Ken Edwards&#x27;s Reality Street. After the abandonment (as planned) of &quot;Place&quot;, he worked on a project called &quot;Gravity as a consequence of shape&quot; from 1982 which he completed in 2007. As with &quot;Place&quot;, this was published in a series of books and pamphlets throughout this period. The total work amounts to some 800 pages. This project was followed by a book of emblems (poem-image-commentary) called &quot;Proposals&quot; and, in 2014, a collage book of poetry, visual images and prose quotations called &quot;SPUTTOR&quot;. In this work and others, the techniques of collage seen in his painting were also applied by Fisher to his poetic practice. Fisher’s books are also &quot;deeply interested in issues involving empathy and scientific enquiry&quot;.

Fisher also made an important contribution to the British Poetry Revival as a publisher. As editor of &quot;Spanner&quot; and &quot;New London Pride&quot;, he published many of the British Poetry Revival poets. He was also co-editor of Aloes Books. Fisher has also sustained a concurrent art practice. During the 1980s, he gained a BA from Goldsmiths&#x27; College, University of London, where he was taught by Harry Thubron and Elma Thubron. He gained an MA from Essex University in Art History. He has had a number of solo shows, including &#x27;Dispossession and Cure&#x27; at the Mayor&#x27;s Parlour Gallery in Hereford. His last retrospective painting show was in Hereford Museum &amp; Art Gallery in 1993. He has over 150 publications in his name consisting of art documentation, poetry and theory. A book of essays &quot;Imperfect Fit: Aesthetic Function, Facture and Perception&quot; regarding American and British Poetry &amp; Art Since 1950 and other essays on poetics was published by the University of Alabama in 2016. An edited collection of essays on his work from the start through to &quot;SPUTTOR&quot;, &quot;The Allen Fisher Companion&quot;, edited by Robert Hampson and cris cheek, was published by Shearsman in 2020. Forthcoming:an &quot;Allen Fisher Reader&quot;.

Fisher is Emeritus Professor of Poetry and Art at Manchester Metropolitan University. He has exhibited widely and his work is represented in the Tate Gallery.

He edits the magazine &quot;Spanner&quot;.

<doc id="439021" wikidata="Q13411080" url="?curid=439021" title="Mysida">
<text>Mysida is an order of small, shrimp-like crustaceans in the malacostracan superorder Peracarida. Their common name opossum shrimps stems from the presence of a brood pouch or &quot;marsupium&quot; in females. The fact that the larvae are reared in this pouch and are not free-swimming characterises the order. The mysid&#x27;s head bears a pair of stalked eyes and two pairs of antennae. The thorax consists of eight segments each bearing branching limbs, the whole concealed beneath a protective carapace and the abdomen has six segments and usually further small limbs.

Mysids are found throughout the world in both shallow and deep marine waters where they can be benthic or pelagic, but they are also important in some fresh water and brackish ecosystems. Many benthic species make daily vertical migrations into higher parts of the water column. Mysids are filter feeders, omnivores that feed on algae, detritus and zooplankton. Some mysids are cultured in laboratories for experimental purposes and are used as a food source for other cultured marine organisms. They are sensitive to water pollution, so are sometimes used as bioindicators to monitor water quality.

==Description== 
The head of a mysid bears two pairs of antennae and a pair of large, stalked eyes. The head and first segment (or sometimes the first three segments) of the thorax are fused to form the cephalothorax. The eight thoracic segments are covered by the carapace which is attached only to the first three. The first two thoracic segments bear maxillipeds which are used to filter plankton and organic particulate from the water. The other six pairs of thoracic appendages are biramous (branching) limbs known as pereopods, and are used for swimming, as well as for wafting water towards the maxillipeds for feeding. Unlike true shrimps (Caridea), females have a marsupium beneath the thorax. This brood pouch is enclosed by the large, flexible oostegites, bristly flaps which extend from the basal segments of the pereopods and which form the floor of a chamber roofed by the animal&#x27;s sternum. This chamber is where the eggs are brooded, development being direct in most cases.

The abdomen has six segments, the first five of which bear pleopods, although these may be absent or vestigial in females. The fourth pleopod is longer than the others in males and has a specialized reproductory function.

The majority of species are long, and vary in colour from pale and transparent, through to bright orange or brown. They differ from other species within the superorder Peracarida by featuring statocysts on their uropods (located on the last abdominal segment). These help the animal orient itself in the water and are clearly seen as circular vesicles: together with the pouch the statocysts are often used as features that distinguish mysids from other shrimp-like organisms.

==Distribution==
Mysids have a cosmopolitan distribution and are found in both marine and freshwater environments, the deep sea, estuaries, shallow coastal waters, lakes, rivers and underground waters. They are primarily marine and fewer than ten percent are found in freshwater. There are about 72 freshwater species in total, being predominantly found in the Palearctic and Neotropical realms. These non-marine mysids occur in four distinct types of habitats; some are estuarine species; some were isolated in the Ponto-Caspian Basin where &quot;Paramysis&quot; has since radiated enormously (23 species); some are glacial relicts and some are subterranean Tethyan relicts.

==Behavior==

Some species are benthic (living on the seabed) and others pelagic (living in mid-water), but most are found close to, crawling on or burrowing into the mud or sand. Most marine species are benthic by day but leave the seabed at night to become planktonic. Locomotion is mostly by swimming, the pleopods being used for this purpose. Some mysids live among algae and seagrasses, some are solitary while many form dense swarms. Mysids form an important part of the diet of such fish as shad and flounder. In general, they are free-living, but a few species, mostly in the subfamily Heteromysinae, are commensal and are associated with sea anemones and hermit crabs. Several taxa have also been described from different freshwater habitats and caves. &quot;Mysis relicta&quot; and its close relatives inhabit cold, deep lakes and have a diurnal cycle of vertical migrations. The species &quot;Mysidium integrum&quot; has a mutualistic relationship with longfin damselfish, the shrimp providing nutrients for the algae farms the fish feed on and the fish providing protection from predators.

The majority of Mysida are omnivores, feeding on algae, detritus, and zooplankton. Scavenging and cannibalism are also common, with the adults sometimes preying on their young once they emerge from the marsupium. The pelagic and most other species are filter feeders, creating a feeding current with the exopods of their pereopods. This wafts food particles into a ventral food groove along which they are passed before being filtered by setae (bristles) on the second maxillae. Larger planktonic prey can be caught in a trap composed of the endopods of the thoracic appendages. Some benthic species, especially members of the subfamily Erythropinae, have been observed feeding on small particles which they collected by grooming the surfaces of their bodies and legs.
Individual mysids are either male or female, and fertilisation is external. The gonads are in the thorax and are tubular in shape. Males have two gonopores in the eighth thoracic segment and a pair of long penises. The female gonopores are in the sixth thoracic segment and the oostegites are attached to the first to seventh pereopods to form a brood pouch. Mating usually takes place at night and lasts only a few minutes. During the process, the male inserts his penises into the marsupium and releases sperm. This stimulates the female and the eggs are usually released into the marsupium within an hour. Here they are fertilised and retained, development of the embryos in the brood pouch being direct with the young hatching from the eggs as miniature adults. The size of a mysid brood generally correlates with body length and environmental factors such as density and food availability. The age at which mysids reach sexual maturity depends on water temperature and food availability. For the species &quot;Mysidopsis bahia&quot;, this is normally at 12 to 20 days. The young are released soon afterwards, and although their numbers are usually low, the short reproductive cycle of mysid adults means a new brood can be produced every four to seven days.

==Uses==
Some species of mysids are easy to culture on a large scale in the laboratory as they are highly adaptive, and can tolerate a wide range of conditions. Despite low fecundity, these species have a short reproductive cycle which means they can quickly reproduce in vast numbers. They can be cultured in static or flow-through systems, the latter having been shown to be able to maintain a higher stocking density than a static system. In flow-through systems, juvenile mysids are continuously separated from the adult brood stock in order to reduce mortality due to cannibalism. &quot;Artemia&quot; (brine shrimp) juveniles (incubated for 24 hours) are the most common food in mysid cultures, sometimes enriched with highly unsaturated fatty acids to increase their nutritional value.

Cultured mysids are thought to provide an ideal food source for many marine organisms. They are often fed to cephalopods, fish larvae, and commercial farmed shrimp due to their small size and low cost. Their high protein and fat content also makes them a good alternative to live enriched &quot;Artemia&quot; when feeding juveniles (especially those that are difficult to maintain such as young seahorses) and other small fauna.

Their sensitivity to water quality also makes them suitable for bioassays. &quot;Americamysis bahia&quot; and &quot;Americamysis almyra&quot; are frequently used to test for pesticides and other toxic substances, with &quot;A. bahia&quot; found to be more sensitive during the periods when it is moulting.

==Systematics==
The Mysida belong to the superorder Peracarida, which means &quot;near to shrimps&quot;. Although in many respects mysids appear similar to some shrimps, the main characteristic separating them from the superorder Eucarida is their lack of free-swimming larvae. The order Mysida is extensive and currently includes approximately 160 genera, containing more than 1000 species.

Traditionally, Mysida were united with another, externally similar group of pelagic crustaceans, the Lophogastrida, into a broader order Mysidacea, but that classification is generally abandoned at present.
While the previous grouping had good morphological support, molecular studies do not corroborate the monophyly of this group. Previously Mysida included two other families, Lepidomysidae and Stygiomysidae, but these have now been placed in a separate order, Stygiomysida.

<text>Neomysis americana is an &quot;extremely common&quot; species of opossum shrimp along the Atlantic coast of North and South America. The species has a disjunct distribution, being present in an area extending from the Saint Lawrence River to Florida, and separately in parts of Argentina (Blanca Bay, Anegada Bay and Samborombón Bay). There may be a further division within the North American populations between those north of Cape Henry, Virginia (including Georges Bank) and those from North Carolina southwards. &quot;N. americana&quot; is an important prey item for a number of fish species, including the Atlantic silverside, the bluefish and the windowpane flounder, &quot;Scophthalmus aquosus&quot;.

<text>Acer negundo, also known as the box elder, boxelder maple, Manitoba maple or ash-leaved maple, is a species of maple native to North America from Canada to Honduras. It is a fast-growing, short-lived tree with opposite, ash-like compound leaves. It is sometimes considered a weedy or invasive species, and has been naturalized throughout much of the world, including South America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, much of Europe, and parts of Asia.

==Description==
&quot;Acer negundo&quot; is a fast-growing and fairly short-lived tree that grows up to tall, with a trunk diameter of , rarely up to diameter. It often has several trunks and can form impenetrable thickets. The typical lifespan of box elder is 60 - 75 years. Under exceptionally favorable conditions, it may live to 100 years.

The shoots are green, often with a whitish to pink or violet waxy coating when young. Branches are smooth, somewhat brittle, and tend to retain a fresh green color rather than forming a bark of dead, protective tissue. The bark on its trunks is pale gray or light brown, deeply cleft into broad ridges, and scaly.

Unlike most other maples (which usually have simple, palmately lobed leaves), &quot;Acer negundo&quot; has pinnately compound leaves that usually have three to seven leaflets. Simple leaves are also occasionally present; technically, these are single-leaflet compound leaves. Although some other maples (such as &quot;Acer griseum&quot;, &quot;Acer mandshuricum&quot; and the closely related &quot;A. cissifolium&quot;) have trifoliate leaves, only &quot;A. negundo&quot; regularly displays more than three leaflets. The leaflets are about long and wide with slightly serrate margins. Leaves have a translucent light green color and turn yellow in the fall.

The yellow-green flowers are small and appear in early spring, with staminate flowers in clusters on slender pedicels and pistillate flowers on drooping racemes long.

The fruit is a schizocarp of two single-seeded, winged samaras on drooping racemes. Each seed is slender, long, with a incurved wing; they drop in autumn or they may persist through winter. Seeds are usually both prolific and fertile.

Unlike most other maples, &quot;A. negundo&quot; is fully dioecious and both a male and female tree are needed for reproduction to occur. The male and female flowers appear on separate plants, with males featuring clusters that generally have four flowers together, while females appear as a raceme.

==Taxonomy==
The Box elder is not in the Elder genus Sambucus in the family Adoxaceae. A few botanists treat boxelder maple in its own distinct genus (&quot;Negundo aceroides&quot;) but this is not widely accepted.

=== Common names ===
Indicative of its familiarity to many people over a large geographic range, &quot;A. negundo&quot; has numerous common names. The names &quot;box elder&quot; and &quot;boxelder maple&quot; are based upon the similarity of its whitish wood to that of boxwood and the similarity of its pinnately compound leaves to those of some species of elder.

Other common names are based upon this maple&#x27;s similarity to ash, its preferred environment, its sugary sap, a description of its leaves, its binomial name, and so on. These names include &quot;Manitoba maple&quot;, &quot;ash-leaf maple&quot;, &quot;cut-leaved maple&quot;, &quot;three-leaf maple&quot;, &quot;ash maple&quot;, &quot;sugar maple&quot;, &quot;negundo maple&quot;, and &quot;river maple&quot;.

Names vary regionally. Box elder, boxelder maple, ash-leaved maple, and maple ash are among its common names in the United States. In Canada it is commonly known as Manitoba maple and occasionally as elf maple. In the British Isles it is known as box elder or ashleaf maple. In Russia it is known as American maple () as well as ash-leaf maple ().

Because of its leaflets&#x27; superficial similarity to those of poison ivy, &quot;Acer negundo&quot; saplings are often mistaken for the allergenic plant. While both poison ivy and &quot;Acer negundo&quot; have compound leaves composed of three leaflets with ragged edges, &quot;Acer negundo&quot; exhibits an opposite branching pattern, as opposed to the alternating pattern of poison ivy. Like poison ivy, &quot;Acer negundo&quot; is also a noted riparian species, and can often be found growing along riverbeds and in wet soils generally. For all these reasons, and despite their obvious differences, &quot;Acer negundo&quot; is sometimes referred to informally as the poison ivy tree.

===Subspecies===
&quot;Acer negundo&quot; is often divided into three or more subspecies, some of which were originally described as separate species. These are:
* &quot;Acer negundo&quot; subsp. &quot;negundo&quot;, native from the Atlantic Coast to the Rocky Mountains.
* &quot;Acer negundo&quot; subsp. &quot;interior&quot; , with more leaf serration than the nominate subspecies and a more matte leaf surface, is native from Saskatchewan to New Mexico, between the eastern and western subspecies.
* &quot;Acer negundo&quot; var. &quot;arizonicum&quot; is native to Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Mexico.
* &quot;Acer negundo&quot; subsp. &quot;californicum&quot; , with larger leaves with a velvety texture, is found in parts of California.
* &quot;Acer negundo&quot; subsp. &quot;mexicanum&quot; is native to Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras.
* &quot;Acer negundo&quot; var. &quot;texanum&quot; is native to the southern United States from Virginia to New Mexico, and to northeastern Mexico.
* &quot;Acer negundo&quot; var. &quot;violaceum&quot; is native to the Northeastern coastal United States and to the northern interior United States from the Ohio Valley to the Columbia River basin.

Some authors further subdivide &quot;A. negundo&quot; subsp. &quot;negundo&quot; into a number of regional varieties but these intergrade and their maintenance as distinct taxa is disputed by many. Even the differences between recognized subspecies are probably a matter of gradient speciation.

==Distribution and habitat==

&quot;Acer negundo&quot; is native across much of the United States (mostly in the east) and south-central Canada, and can be found as far south as Guatemala.

Box Elder County, Utah is named for this tree.

Although native to North America, it is considered a weedy species in some areas, such as in parts of the Northeastern United States, and has increased greatly in these areas. In 1928, Joseph Illick, chief forester for the state of Pennsylvania, wrote in &quot;Pennsylvania Trees&quot; that box elder was &quot;rare and localized&quot; in the state. After World War II, box elder&#x27;s rapid growth made it a popular landscaping tree in suburban housing developments despite its poor form, vulnerability to storm damage, and tendency to attract large numbers of box elder bugs. Intentional cultivation has thus made the tree far more abundant than it once was.

It can quickly colonize both cultivated and uncultivated areas and the range is therefore expanding both in North America and elsewhere. In Europe where it was introduced in 1688 as a park tree it is able to spread quickly and is considered an invasive species in parts of Central Europe, including Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, Poland and Russia where it can form mass growth in lowlands, disturbed areas, and riparian biomes on calcareous soils. It has also become naturalized in eastern China, is listed as a pest invasive species in some of the cooler areas of the Australian continent, and is invasive in the Rio de la Plata area. 

This species prefers bright sunlight. It often grows on flood plains and other disturbed areas with ample water supply, such as riparian habitats. Human influence has greatly favored this species; it grows around houses and in hedges, as well as on disturbed ground and vacant lots.

==Ecology==
Several birds and some squirrels feed on the seeds. The evening grosbeak uses them extensively.

The boxelder bug (&quot;Boisea trivittata&quot;) lays its eggs on all maples, but prefers this species, clustering the eggs in bark crevices. The rosy maple moth (&quot;Dryocampa rubicunda&quot;) also lays its eggs on the leaves of maple trees, including &quot;Acer negundo&quot;. The larvae feed on the leaves, and in very dense populations can cause defoliation.

Small galls are formed on the leaves by a bladder mite, &quot;Aceria negundi&quot;. A gall midge, &quot;Contarinia negundinis&quot; joins and enlarges the galls of &quot;Aceria negundi&quot;. The midge sometimes creates a separate, tubular gall on the midrib or veins of the undersides of the leaves.

The cottony maple leaf scale, &quot;Pulvinaria acericola&quot;, occurs on the foliage of &quot;Acer negundo&quot;. A leaf spot fungus, &quot;Septoria negundinis&quot; creates black-ringed lesions on the leaves.

== Cultivation ==
Although its weak wood, irregular form, and prolific seeding might make it seem like a poor choice for a landscape tree, &quot;A. negundo&quot; is one of the most common maples in cultivation. Long-term success has been noted as far north as Yellowknife. Many cultivars have been developed, such as:

* &#x27;Auratum&#x27; – yellowish leaves with smooth undersides
* &#x27;Aureomarginatum&#x27; – creamy yellow leaf margins
* &#x27;Baron&#x27; – Hardier &amp; seedless variety
* &#x27;Elegans&#x27; – distinctively convex leaves
* &#x27;Flamingo&#x27; – pink and white variegation (very popular)
* &#x27;Pendulum&#x27; – with weeping branches.
* &#x27;Variegatum&#x27; – creamy white leaf margins
* &#x27;Violaceum&#x27; – younger shoots and branches have bluish color

==Toxicity==
A protoxin present in the seeds of &quot;Acer negundo&quot;, hypoglycin A, has been identified as a major risk factor for, and possibly the cause of, a disease in horses, seasonal pasture myopathy (SPM). SPM is an equine neurological disease which occurs seasonally in certain areas of North America and Europe, with symptoms including stiffness, difficulty walking or standing, dark urine and eventually breathing rapidly and becoming recumbent. Ingestion of sufficient quantities of box elder seeds or other parts of the plant results in breakdown of respiratory, postural, and cardiac muscles. The cause of SPM was unknown for centuries despite the disease being well known among affected areas and was only positively determined in the 21st century. It is analogous to Jamaican vomiting sickness in humans, also caused by hypoglycin A.

&quot;Acer negundo&quot; pollen, which is released in winter or spring (varying with latitude and elevation) is a severe allergen.

==Uses==
===Wood===
Although its light, close-grained, soft wood is considered undesirable for most commercial uses, this tree has been considered as a source of wood fiber, for use in fiberboard. There is also some commercial use of the tree for various decorative applications, such as turned items (bowls, stem-ware, pens). Such purposes generally use burl or injured wood, as the injured wood develops a red stain.

The wood has been used for a variety of purposes by Native Americans, such as by the Navajo to make tubes for bellows, by the Cheyenne to make bowls, and by the native peoples of Montana who use the large trunk burls or knots to make bowls, dishes, drums, and pipe stems. The Tewa use the twigs as pipe stems and the Keres make the twigs into prayer sticks.

The Dakota people and the Omaha people make the wood into charcoal, which is used in ceremonial painting and tattooing. The Kiowa burn the wood in the altar fire during the peyote ceremony.

&quot;Acer negundo&quot; was identified as the material used in the oldest extant wood flutes from the Americas. The flutes, excavated by Earl H. Morris in 1931 in Northeastern Arizona, have been dated to 620–670 CE.

===Medicinal use===
&quot;Acer negundo&quot; has been used by Native Americans for several medicinal purposes. The Cheyenne burn the wood as incense for making spiritual medicines, and during Sun Dance ceremonies. The Meskwaki use a decoction of the inner bark as an emetic, and the Ojibwa use an infusion of the inner bark for the same purpose.

===As food===
The sap has been used to make syrup by Native Americans, including the Dakota, Omaha, Pawnee, Ponca, Winnebago, Cree, Sioux, and the indigenous people of Montana. The Chiricahua and Mescalero Apache dry scrapings of the inner bark and keep it as winter food, and they also boil the inner bark until sugar crystallizes out of it. The Cheyenne mix the boiled sap with shavings from the inner sides of animal hides and eat them as candy. The Ojibwa mix the sap with that of the sugar maple and drink it as a beverage.

<text>Lancashire is an English cow&#x27;s-milk cheese from the county of Lancashire. There are three distinct varieties of Lancashire cheese. Young &quot;Creamy Lancashire&quot; and mature &quot;Tasty Lancashire&quot; are produced by a traditional method, whereas &quot;Crumbly Lancashire&quot; (more commonly known as &quot;Lancashire Crumbly&quot; within Lancashire) is a more recent creation suitable for mass production.

It is traditionally paired with Eccles cakes and Chorley cakes.

==Creamy Lancashire==

For centuries, Lancashire dairy farmers&#x27; wives made cheese from surplus milk. On small farms there was insufficient milk from a single day to make a cheese, and so each day&#x27;s milk was curdled and accumulated for several days until there was enough curd to make a cheese. Uniquely amongst all British cheeses, two or three days&#x27; curd of varying maturity are blended together, giving Lancashire cheese a distinctive character. The traditional method was standardised in the 1890s by Joseph Gornall of Garstang and Pilling, a county council employee, who visited many Lancashire farms to establish a method and recipe that is still used today – the &quot;Gornall method&quot;. His &quot;Gornall Patent Cheesemaker&quot; was sold between 1892 and 1919.

Creamy Lancashire cheese is made by this traditional method and matured for a period of four to twelve weeks. It has a fluffy texture and creamy flavour, and is good for toasting, as it does not become stringy when melted.

Beacon Fell Traditional Lancashire Cheese is a Protected Designation of Origin name. The name can be used only for cheese made with milk from an area north of the River Ribble including the Fylde, Preston, and Blackpool and made in the same area by a designated method. The verbatim PDO-registered name is &quot;Beacon Fell Traditional Lancashire Cheese&quot;. It is named after Beacon Fell within the designated area.

==Tasty Lancashire==

Tasty Lancashire cheese is made by the same traditional method as Creamy Lancashire, but is matured for longer, from 12 weeks to 24 months. It has a mature nutty taste.

Leigh Cheese was a version of Lancashire Cheese that ceased production in the 19th century.

==Crumbly Lancashire==

In the 1950s, Crumbly Lancashire cheese was created. Unlike the other Lancashire varieties, this is made from a single day&#x27;s milk and resembles other crumbly cheeses such as Cheshire and Wensleydale. It is the only Lancashire cheese that is produced outside the county of Lancashire. It tends to be matured for only 6–8 weeks, resulting in a crumbly, fresh, high-acid cheese.

<doc id="439040" wikidata="Q265236" url="?curid=439040" title="Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union">
<text>The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (CFR) enshrines certain political, social, and economic rights for European Union (EU) citizens and residents into EU law. It was drafted by the European Convention and solemnly proclaimed on 7 December 2000 by the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission. However, its then legal status was uncertain and it did not have full legal effect until the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009.

The Charter forms part of the area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ) policy domain of the EU. It applies to all the bodies of the European Union and Euratom which must act and legislate in accordance with its provisions, as the EU&#x27;s courts will invalidate any EU legislation or ruling assessed as non-compliant with the Charter.

The EU member states are also bound by the Charter when engaged in implementation of the European Union law. However, Poland has been granted a partial opt-out from enforcement of the CFR in spite of participating in the AFSJ; in contrast, Denmark and Ireland have fully adopted the Charter, in spite of having been granted opt-outs from the AFSJ (a general and a partial one, respectively).

==Background==

The Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (Treaty of Rome) did not include any reference to fundamental or human rights. The EEC Treaty was written a few years after the failure of the European Defence Community Treaty and the European Political Community Treaty. The latter treaty had included rights provisions and Craig and de Búrca argue that, in light of that failure, the drafters of the EEC Treaty wished to eschew any implicitly political elements. However, the idea that the purely economic end of the new EEC Treaty would be unlikely to have any implications for fundamental rights was soon to be tested.

===Court cases===
Soon after the entry into force of the EEC Treaty, the Community established itself as a major political entity with policy ramifications beyond its economic aims. In 1964, the European Court of Justice handed down its decision in &quot;Costa v ENEL&quot;, in which the Court decided that Union law should take precedence over conflicting national law. This meant that national governments could not escape what they had agreed to at a European level by enacting conflicting domestic measures, but it also potentially meant that the EEC legislator could legislate unhindered by the restrictions imposed by fundamental rights provisions enshrined in the constitutions of member states. This issue came to a head in 1970 in the Internationale Handelsgesellschaft case when a German court ruled that a piece of EEC legislation infringed the German Basic Law. On a reference from the German court, the ECJ ruled that whilst the application of Union law could not depend on its consistency with national constitutions, fundamental rights did form an &quot;integral part of the general principles of [European Community] law&quot; and that inconsistency with fundamental rights could form the basis of a successful challenge to a European law.

In ruling as it did in &quot;Internationale Handelsgesellschaft&quot; the ECJ had in effect created a doctrine of unwritten rights which bound the Community institutions. While the court&#x27;s fundamental rights jurisprudence was approved by the institutions in 1977 and a statement to that effect was inserted into the Maastricht Treaty. It was only in 1999 that the European Council formally went about the initiating the process of drafting a codified catalogue of fundamental rights for the EU.

===Proclamation===
In 1999 the European Council proposed that a &quot;body composed of representatives of the Heads of State and Government and of the president of the Commission as well as of members of the European Parliament and national parliaments&quot; should be formed to draft a fundamental rights charter. On being constituted in December of that year the &quot;body&quot; entitled itself the European Convention.

The Convention adopted the draft on 2 October 2000 and it was solemnly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission on 7 December 2000. It was at the same time, however, decided to defer making a decision on the Charter&#x27;s legal status. However, it did come with the political weight of having been approved by three powerful institutions and as such was regularly cited by the ECJ as a source of fundamental rights.

===Legal force===
A modified Charter formed part of the defunct European Constitution (2004). After that treaty&#x27;s failure, its replacement, the Lisbon Treaty (2007), also gave force to the Charter albeit by referencing it as an independent document rather than by incorporating it into the treaty itself. However, both the version included in the Constitution and the one referenced in the Lisbon Treaty were amended versions of the Charter.

On the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding proposed that Commissioners should swear to uphold all EU treaties and the Charter. On 3 May 2010, the European Commission swore a solemn declaration at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, pledging to respect the EU Treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate. For the first time, the Commissioners also explicitly pledged to respect the new Charter of Fundamental Rights.

Several states insisted upon an opt-out from national application of the charter (see below for details).

==Legal status==

Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009 the fundamental rights charter has the same legal value as the European Union treaties. The Charter referred to in the Treaty is an amended version of the 2000 document which was solemnly declared by the same three institutions a day before the signing of the Lisbon Treaty itself.

Article 51(1) of the Charter addresses the Charter to the EU&#x27;s institutions, bodies established under EU law and, when implementing EU laws, the EU&#x27;s member states. In addition both Article 6 of the amended Treaty of European Union and Article 51(2) of the Charter itself restrict the Charter from extending the competences of the EU. A consequence of this is that the EU will not be able to legislate to vindicate a right set out in the Charter unless the power to do such is set out in the Treaties proper. Furthermore, individuals will not be able to take a member state to court for failing to uphold the rights in the Charter unless the member state in question was implementing EU law. It is this last point that has been subject to the most debate.

The Charter is not the first attempt to place human rights principles at the core of European Union law. All EU member states are, and candidate states are required to be, signatories to the Council of Europe&#x27;s European Convention on Human Rights, so that many principles from the convention, such as the right to a fair trial, were taken as the baseline for European Court of Justice jurisprudence even before their formal reiteration in Charter. In interpreting the human rights protections provided by the general principles of EU law (described in the Court cases section above), the ECJ had already dealt with the issue of whether the rights protected by those general principles applied to member states. Having ruled in &quot;Johnston v Royal Ulster Constabulary&quot; that a right to fair procedures was one of the general principles of EU law, in &quot;Kremzow v Austria&quot; the ECJ had to decide whether or not a member state was obliged to apply that principle in relation to a wrongful conviction for murder. Kremzow&#x27;s lawyers argued that his case came within the scope of EU law on the grounds that his wrongful conviction and sentence had breached his right to free movement within the EU. The ECJ responded by saying that since the laws under which Kremzow had been convicted were not enacted to secure compliance with EU law, his predicament fell outside the scope of EU law.

The wording in &quot;Kremzow v Austria&quot;, referring to the &quot;field of application of EU law&quot;, differs from the wording in the Charter which refers to the implementation of EU law. However, the amended explanatory memorandum issued alongside the Charter in 2007 describes the wording used in the Charter as reflecting ECJ precedent.

In 2019, the German Federal Constitutional Court established in &quot;Recht auf Vergessen II&quot; that it applies the Charter as the standard of review for matters regarding EU law and its national implementation, under the premise that the Charter offers sufficiently effective protection of relevant fundamental rights when compared to the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany.

===The British and Polish protocol===
In the negotiations leading up to the signing to the Lisbon Treaty, Poland and the United Kingdom secured a protocol to the treaty relating to the application of the Charter of the Fundamental Rights in their respective countries.

The protocol, in article 1(1) states that the &quot;Charter does not extend the ability of the Court of Justice of the European Union, or any court or tribunal of Poland or of the United Kingdom, to find that the laws, regulations or administrative provisions, practices or actions of Poland or of the United Kingdom are inconsistent with the fundamental rights, freedoms and principles that it reaffirms.&quot; Article 1(2) then says that the Title IV of the Charter, which contains economic and social rights, does not create justiciable rights, unless Poland and the UK have provided for such rights in their national laws.

Poland and the United Kingdom wanted the protocol for different reasons. The United Kingdom originally opposed a legally binding charter over concerns that it would result in a stream of British citizens going to the European Court of Justice in attempts to enforce their Charter rights in the United Kingdom, and in increased costs for business. While the British accepted a legally binding rights charter during the negotiations of the failed European Constitution, they negotiated a protocol during the Lisbon negotiations which, according to the then British Minister for Europe, would ensure that the Charter would not extend the powers of the European Court of Justice over United Kingdom law. Poland, on the other hand, disliked what it perceived as the Charter&#x27;s liberal stance on social issues, and so in September 2007 the Polish government indicated that they wished to be included in the British protocol.

There is considerable debate concerning the legal effect of the protocol. One view, shared by Jan Jirásek, is that the protocol is an opt-out that excludes the application of the Charter to Poland and the United Kingdom. Another, shared by Ingolf Pernice, is that the protocol is only an interpretive one which will either have limited or no legal consequence. Craig and de Burcá argue that the protocol is merely declaratory. It says that the &quot;Charter does not extend the ability&quot; of the ECJ or other court to overturn British or Polish law, but the ECJ already had the power to do this in any case. Accordingly, the Protocol is &quot;unlikely that it will have any significant effect in practice.&quot;

In &quot;NS v Home Secretary&quot;, the ECJ ruled that Article 1(1) of the protocol &quot;explains Article 51 of the Charter with regard to the scope thereof and does not intend to exempt the Republic of Poland or the United Kingdom from the obligation to comply with the provisions of the Charter or to prevent a court of one of those Member States from ensuring compliance with those provisions.&quot;

Under section 5(4) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, the Charter of Fundamental Rights was not retained in British law after its exit from the EU.

===Proposed Czech protocol===
During the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Czech President Václav Klaus expressed concern that the Charter would allow families of Germans who were expelled from territory in modern-day Czech Republic after the Second World War to challenge the expulsion before the EU&#x27;s courts, though legal experts have suggested that the laws under which the Germans were expelled, the Beneš decrees, did not fall under the jurisdiction of EU law. After Klaus refused to finalize the Czech Republic&#x27;s ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon unless the country was excluded from the Charter, as Poland and the United Kingdom had been, EU leaders agreed in October 2009 to amend the protocol to include the Czech Republic at the time of the next accession treaty in a measure designed to persuade Klaus to sign the treaty which he subsequently signed.

In September 2011, the Czech government formally submitted a request to the Council that the promised treaty revisions be made to extend the protocol to the Czech Republic, and a draft amendment to this effect was proposed by the European Council. However, the Czech Senate passed a resolution in October 2011 opposing their accession to the protocol. When Croatia&#x27;s Treaty of Accession 2011 was signed in late 2011, the Czech protocol amendment was not included. During the Czech Republic&#x27;s parliamentary ratification of the accession treaty in the spring of 2012, the government attempted to combine the approval of the Charter opt-out with the ratification bill. However, with the Senate controlled by the opposition parties, their objections to the opt-out could have led to the accession treaty being rejected. As a result, the government decided to separate the proposed opt-out from the accession treaty bill.

A vote on a draft report by the European Parliament Constitutional Affairs Committee in January 2012 recommending against granting the Czech Republic&#x27;s request to be added to Protocol 30 resulted in a tie. The report argued that Protocol 30 was not functioning as a general opt-out from the Charter, but only allowed the countries to limit the application of subsequent EU laws based solely on the charter. Thus, the Czech Republic would still be bound by the Charter even if they were added to the Protocol. In October 2012, the committee approved the report, and a third draft of the report was published on 11 December 2012. The report was tabled in Parliament during its session on 22 May 2013, and the Parliament voted in favour of calling on the European Council &quot;not to examine the proposed amendment of the Treaties&quot;. The Parliament did, however, give its consent in advance that a treaty revision to add the Czech Republic to Protocol 30 would not require a new convention.

In January 2014, after presidential and parliamentary elections the previous year had resulted in new leadership in the country, new Czech Human Rights Minister Jiří Dienstbier said that he would attempt to have his country&#x27;s request for an opt-out withdrawn. This was confirmed on 20 February 2014 by the new Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, who withdrew the request for an opt-out during a meeting with President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso shortly after his newly elected government won the confidence of Parliament. In May 2014, the Council of the European Union formally withdrew their recommendation to hold an Intergovernmental Conference of member states to consider the proposed amendments to the treaties.

==Content==
The Charter contains some 54 articles divided into seven titles. The first six titles deal with substantive rights under the headings: dignity, freedoms, equality, solidarity, citizens&#x27; rights and justice, while the last title deals with the interpretation and application of the Charter. Much of Charter is based on the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), European Social Charter, the case-law of the European Court of Justice and pre-existing provisions of European Union law.

* The first title (Dignity) guarantees the right to life and personal integrity and prohibits torture, slavery, the death penalty, eugenic practices and reproductive human cloning. Its provisions are mostly based on the ECHR, although Article 1 closely reflects Article 1 of the German Basic Law.
* The second title (Freedoms) covers liberty, privacy, protection of personal data, marriage, thought, religion, expression, assembly, education, work, property and asylum.
* The third title (Equality) covers equality before the law, prohibition of all discrimination including on basis of disability, age and sexual orientation, cultural, religious and linguistic diversity, the rights of children and the elderly.
* The fourth title (Solidarity) covers social and workers&#x27; rights including the right to fair working conditions, protection against unjustified dismissal, and access to health care, social and housing assistance, environmental protection and consumer protection.
* The fifth title (Citizen&#x27;s Rights) covers the rights of the EU citizens such as the right to vote and right to candidacy in elections to the European Parliament and municipal elections and the right to move freely within the EU. It also includes several administrative rights such as a right to good administration, to access documents and to petition the European Parliament.
* The sixth title (Justice) covers justice issues such as the right to an effective remedy, a fair trial, to the presumption of innocence, the principle of legality, non-retrospectivity and double jeopardy.
* The seventh title (General Provisions) concerns the interpretation and application of the Charter. These issues are dealt with above.

==Raising the Charter&#x27;s profile==
The EU has attempted to raise the profile of the Charter so that citizens are more aware of their rights. For example, the EU Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) has produced apps for iOS and Android with the text of the Charter in all EU languages and related information. It has also published mini-versions of the Charter in all EU languages.

In 2010, the FRA put out a tender for poets to turn the Charter into an 80-minute-long epic poem, with music, dance and multimedia elements. This was also to raise awareness and to simplify the legal text into more understandable language. However, Viviane Reding, the European Commissioner for Justice, Freedom &amp; Security, wrote to the director of the FRA slamming the idea on cost and dignity grounds and instructing him to cancel the project.

<text>Plinking is informal target shooting done for leisure, typically at non-standard targets such as tin cans, logs, bottles, balloons, fruits or any other man-made or naturally occurring objects. The term is an onomatopoeia of the sharp, ringing sound (or &quot;plink&quot;) that a projectile makes when hitting a metallic target such as a tin can or a road sign plate.

==Practice==
In contrast to shooting done at established target ranges, plinking is generally done at home in one&#x27;s backyard, in an open field, or on other private land, the owner of which does not demand entrance fees.

==Appeal==
The primary attributes of plinking that make it appealing as a sport are as follows: easy availability and a broad variety of locations, minimum cost, freedom in practice, outdoors environment, and more engaging shooting experience when compared to established target ranges. Since not all people have reasonable access to a target range, outdoor shooting done at home or another nearby piece of land is a natural alternative, and for many, homemade shooting ranges are the only way to keep up good marksmanship.


Since target ranges generally charge a fee for the use of their facilities, and shooters usually have to buy their own paper targets, going to a target range can incur significant costs, especially when added up over time. In addition, gun ranges by necessity have many strict rules about the use of their facilities, concerning shot rate, types of ammunition, and firearms permitted, where the shooter is allowed to stand, and when they can go downrange to check their targets, which some shooters may find stifling. Many shooters also find the open air to be a much more pleasant shooting environment than an indoor target range, which is usually windowless and made of concrete and steel.

By contrast, plinking can be done at home or during casual excursions whenever the urge strikes (subject to local regulations), for merely the cost of ammunition, and the targets used can be any item of suitable size that is at hand, with beverage cans being one of the more popular choices. Plinking can be done alone or in small groups at the individual pace of the shooters.

The targets that are used are one of the main reasons why plinking is popular among gun enthusiasts, especially hunters. A three-dimensional target in an outdoor setting is much more akin to a real-world hunting scenario, allowing a hunter the opportunity for practice. Since any reasonably sized object, from a soda can or a charcoal briquet to an arbitrary spot on a tree can be used as a target, a three-dimensional plinking range can easily be set up that will simulate situations commonly found while hunting small game, such as when the animal is behind cover, or up in a tree. A plinking target will also often react much more positively to a hit than a paper target will, either with an audible impact, or visual confirmation by moving, splattering, or falling over. Steel targets, which are used for formal action and long range shooting competitions, are also popular among plinksters due to their relative ease to set up, as well as their clear evidence of good hits.

<text>The Irish Football Association (IFA) is the governing body for association football in Northern Ireland. It organised the Ireland national football team from 1880 to 1950, which after 1954, became the Northern Ireland national football team.

==History==
===Foundation of the IFA===

The IFA was formed on 18 November 1880 by seven football clubs mostly in the Belfast area, as the organising body for the sport across all of Ireland. A meeting was called by Cliftonville of other football clubs that followed the rules set out by the Scottish Football Association (SFA). At that meeting, on 18 November of that year, seven clubs formed the IFA, making it the fourth oldest national football association in the world (after those of England, Scotland and Wales). The founding members were: Alexander, Avoniel, Cliftonville, Distillery, Knock, Moyola Park and Oldpark. The IFA&#x27;s first decision was to form an annual challenge cup competition similar to the FA Cup and Scottish Cup competitions, called the Irish Cup. Two years later, Ireland played its first international against England, losing 13–0 (which remains a record for both teams; a record win for England, and a record loss for (Northern) Ireland).

===North/South split and the foundation of the Football Association of Ireland===
Shortly after the partition of Ireland, in 1921, the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) was established as a rival association to regulate the game in what was to become the Irish Free State. The immediate cause of the split lay in a bitter dispute over the venue for the replay of an Irish Cup match in 1921 involving Glentoran of Belfast and Shelbourne of Dublin. When the first cup match was drawn in Belfast, because of the Irish war of independence, the IFA reneged on a promise to play the replay in Dublin and scheduled the rematch again for Belfast. Shelbourne refused to comply and forfeited the Cup. Such was the anger over the issue that the Leinster Football Association broke away from the IFA and formed its own national association. Those behind the FAI believed that football should be regulated by a federation based in the Irish Free State&#x27;s capital, Dublin; they also accused the IFA of neglecting the development of the game in the South. The IFA&#x27;s supporters argued that the federation should be based where the game was mainly played – namely Ulster, and its principal city Belfast.

Both associations claimed to represent the whole of the island, each competing internationally under the name &quot;Ireland&quot; and selecting players from both the rival national leagues, which also split at this time. Interventions by FIFA gave the FAI &quot;de jure&quot; organising rights over the 26 counties of the Republic, with the IFA restricted to Northern Ireland. From the 1950s onwards, the IFA no longer claimed it was the association for the whole of Ireland. In 1960, the association moved to Windsor Avenue in south Belfast, in a building once occupied by Thomas Andrews. The IFA moved again in 2016 to its current location at the National Football Stadium at Windsor Park, Belfast. The IFA continued to regulate the game in Northern Ireland, and all results obtained by the Irish national side and records in the Irish Football League and the cup competition stand as Northern Irish records.

===Summary===

:1880 – IFA founded in Belfast, representing all of Ireland (&quot;Ireland&quot;)
:1921 – FAI founded in Dublin, representing Southern Ireland (&quot;Irish Free State&quot;)
:1936 – FAI begins also selecting Northern players (&quot;Ireland&quot;/&quot;Éire&quot;)
:1946 – FAI stops selecting Northern players (&quot;Republic of Ireland&quot; as of 1954)
:1950 – IFA stops selecting Southern players (&quot;Northern Ireland&quot; as of 1954)
Therefore,
:IFA (today Northern Ireland) represented all of Ireland between 1880–1950
:FAI (today Republic of Ireland) represented all of Ireland between 1936–1946

Along with the other Home Nations&#x27; associations (the English FA, the Scottish Football Association, and the Football Association of Wales), the IFA sits on the International Football Association Board, which is responsible for the laws of the game. The IFA continues to have responsibility for the running of the Northern Irish national team.

==Women&#x27;s football==
The Northern Ireland Women&#x27;s Football Association (NIWFA) is the IFA&#x27;s women&#x27;s football arm. It runs a Women&#x27;s Cup, Women&#x27;s League, a range of underage football camps and the Northern Ireland women&#x27;s national football team. In April 2014, Northern Ireland&#x27;s Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure Carál Ní Chuilín threatened to cut the IFA&#x27;s funding unless it stopped treating women&#x27;s football as &quot;an after thought&quot;.

<doc id="439058" wikidata="Q29201" url="?curid=439058" title="Yellow Emperor">
<text>The Yellow Emperor, also known as the Yellow [[Thearch]] or by his Chinese name Huangdi (), is a mythical Chinese sovereign and culture hero included among the legendary Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, (&quot;shen&quot;). He is revered as a deity individually or as part of the Five Regions Highest Deities () in Chinese folk religion. Regarded as the initiator of Chinese culture, he is traditionally credited with numerous innovations – including the lunar calendar (Chinese calendar), Taoism, wooden houses, boats, carts, the compass needle, &quot;the earliest forms of writing&quot;, and cuju, a ball game. Calculated by Jesuit missionaries, as based on various Chinese chronicles, Huangdi&#x27;s traditional reign dates begin in either 2698 or 2697 BC, spanning one hundred years exactly, later accepted by the twentieth-century promoters of a universal calendar starting with the Yellow Emperor.

Huangdi&#x27;s cult is first attested in the Warring States period, and became prominent late in that same period and into the early Han dynasty, when he was portrayed as the originator of the centralized state, as a cosmic ruler, and as a patron of esoteric arts. A large number of texts – such as the &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot;, a medical classic, and the &quot;Huangdi Sijing&quot;, a group of political treatises – were thus attributed to him. Having waned in influence during most of the imperial period, in the early twentieth century Huangdi became a rallying figure for Han Chinese attempts to overthrow the rule of the Qing dynasty, remaining a powerful symbol within modern Chinese nationalism. 

==Names==
===&quot;Huangdi&quot;: Yellow Emperor, Yellow Thearch===
Until 221 BC, when Qin Shi Huang of the Qin dynasty coined the title &quot;huangdi&quot; () – conventionally &quot;emperor&quot; - the character &quot;di&quot; did not refer to earthly rulers but to Shangdi, the highest god of the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BC) pantheon. In the Warring States period (c. 475–221 BC), the term &quot;di&quot; on its own could also refer to the deities associated with the five Sacred Mountains of China and colors. Huangdi (), the &quot;yellow &quot;di&quot;&quot;, was one of the latter. To emphasize the religious meaning of &quot;di&quot; in pre-imperial times, historians of early China commonly translate the god&#x27;s name as &quot;Yellow Thearch&quot; and the first emperor&#x27;s title as &quot;August Thearch&quot;, in which &quot;thearch&quot; refers to a godly ruler.

In the late Warring States period, the Yellow Emperor was integrated into the cosmological scheme of the Five Phases, in which the color yellow represents the earth phase, the Yellow Dragon, and the center. The correlation of the colors in association with different dynasties was mentioned in the &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot; (late 3rd century BC), where the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s reign was seen to be governed by earth. The character &quot;huang&quot; (&quot;yellow&quot;) was often used in place of the homophonous &quot;huang&quot; , which means &quot;august&quot; (in the sense of &#x27;distinguished&#x27;) or &quot;radiant&quot;, giving Huangdi attributes close to those of Shangdi, the Shang supreme god.

===Xuanyuan and Youxiong===
The &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, compiled by Sima Qian in the first century BC, gives the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s name as &quot;Xuan Yuan&quot; ( &lt; Old Chinese (B-S) *&quot;qʰa[r]-[ɢ]ʷa[n]&quot;, lit. &quot;Chariot Shaft&quot;). Third-century scholar Huangfu Mi, who wrote a work on the sovereigns of antiquity, commented that Xuanyuan was the name of a hill where Huangdi had lived and that he later took as a name. The &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot; mentions a Xuanyuan nation whose inhabitants have human faces, snake bodies, and tails twisting above their heads; Yuan Ke, a contemporary scholar of early Chinese mythology, &quot;noted that the appearance of these people is characteristic of gods and suggested that they may reflect the form of the Yellow Thearch himself&quot;. The Qing dynasty scholar Liang Yusheng (, 1745–1819) argued instead that the hill was named after the Yellow Emperor. Xuanyuan is also the name of the star Regulus in Chinese, the star being associated with Huangdi in traditional astronomy. He is also associated to the broader constellations Leo and Lynx, of which the latter is said to represent the body of the Yellow Dragon ( &quot;Huánglóng&quot;), Huangdi&#x27;s animal form.

Huangdi was also referred to as &quot;Youxiong&quot; (). This name has been interpreted as either a place name or a clan name. According to British sinologist Herbert Allen Giles (1845–1935), that name was &quot;taken from that of [Huangdi&#x27;s] hereditary principality&quot;. William Nienhauser, a modern translator of the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, states that Huangdi was originally the head of the Youxiong clan, which lived near what is now Xinzheng in Henan. Rémi Mathieu, a French historian of Chinese myths and religion, translates &quot;Youxiong&quot; as &quot;possessor of bears&quot; and links Huangdi to the broader theme of the bear in world mythology. Ye Shuxian has also associated the Yellow Emperor with bear legends common across northeast Asia people as well as the Dangun legend.

===Other names===
Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; describes the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s ancestral name as Gongsun ().

In Han dynasty texts, the Yellow Emperor is also called upon as the &quot;Yellow God&quot; ( &quot;Huángshén&quot;). Certain accounts interpret him as the incarnation of the &quot;Yellow God of the Northern Dipper&quot; ( &quot;Huángshén Běidǒu&quot;), another name of the universal god (&quot;Shangdi&quot; or &quot;Tiandi&quot; ). According to a definition in apocryphal texts related to the &quot;Hétú&quot; , the Yellow Emperor &quot;proceeds from the essence of the Yellow God&quot;.

As a cosmological deity, the Yellow Emperor is known as the &quot;Great Emperor of the Central Peak&quot; ( &quot;Zhōngyuè Dàdì&quot;), and in the &quot;Shizi&quot; as the &quot;Yellow Emperor with Four Faces&quot; ( &quot;Huángdì Sìmiàn&quot;). In old accounts the Yellow Emperor is identified as a deity of light (and his name is explained in the &quot;Shuowen jiezi&quot; to derive from &quot;guāng&quot; , &quot;light&quot;) and thunder, and as one and the same with the &quot;Thunder God&quot; ( &quot;Léishén&quot;), who in turn, as a later mythological character, is distinguished as the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s foremost pupil, such as in the &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot;.

==Historicity==

The Chinese historian Sima Qianand much Chinese historiography following himconsidered the Yellow Emperor to be a more historical figure than earlier legendary figures such as Fu Xi, Nüwa, and Shennong. Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; begins with the Yellow Emperor, while passing over the others.

Throughout most of Chinese history, the Yellow Emperor and the other ancient sages were considered to be historical figures. Their historicity started to be questioned in the 1920s by historians such as Gu Jiegang, one of the founders of the Doubting Antiquity School in China. In their attempts to prove that the earliest figures of Chinese history were mythological, Gu and his followers argued that these ancient sages were originally gods who were later depicted as humans by the rationalist intellectuals of the Warring States period. Yang Kuan, a member of the same current of historiography, noted that only in the Warring States period had the Yellow Emperor started to be described as the first ruler of China. Yang thus argued that Huangdi was a later transformation of Shangdi, the supreme god of the Shang dynasty&#x27;s pantheon.

Also in the 1920s, French scholars Henri Maspero and Marcel Granet published critical studies of China&#x27;s accounts of high antiquity. In his &quot;Danses et légendes de la Chine ancienne&quot; [&quot;Dances and legends of ancient China&quot;], for example, Granet argued that these tales were &quot;historicized legends&quot; that said more about the time when they were written than about the time they purported to describe.

In the &quot;middle of the [20th] century, a group of&quot; Chinese &quot;historians proposed the theory that [the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]&quot; were originally Chinese gods who became thought of as human during the later period of the Zhou dynasty. Most scholars now agree that the Yellow Emperor originated as a god who was later represented as a historical person. K. C. Chang sees Huangdi and other cultural heroes as &quot;ancient religious figures&quot; who were &quot;euhemerized&quot; in the late Warring States and Han periods. Historian of ancient China Mark Edward Lewis speaks of the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s &quot;earlier nature as a god&quot;, whereas Roel Sterckx, a professor at University of Cambridge, calls Huangdi a &quot;legendary cultural hero&quot;.

==Origin of the myth==
The origin of Huangdi&#x27;s mythology is unclear, but historians have formulated several hypotheses about it. Yang Kuan, a member of the Doubting Antiquity School (1920s–40s), argued that the Yellow Emperor was derived from Shangdi, the highest god of the Shang dynasty. Yang reconstructs the etymology as follows: Shangdi → Huang Shangdi → Huangdi → Huangdi , in which he claims that &quot;huang&quot; (&quot;yellow&quot;) either was a variant Chinese character for &quot;huang&quot; (&quot;august&quot;) or was used as a way to avoid the naming taboo for the latter. Yang&#x27;s view has been criticized by Mitarai Masaru and by Michael Puett.

Historian Mark Edward Lewis agrees that &quot;huang&quot; and &quot;huang&quot; were often interchangeable, but disagreeing with Yang, he claims that &quot;huang&quot; meaning &quot;yellow&quot; appeared first. Based on what he admits is a &quot;novel etymology&quot; likening &quot;huang&quot; to the phonetically close &quot;wang&quot; (the &quot;burned shaman&quot; in Shang rainmaking rituals), Lewis suggests that &quot;Huang&quot; in &quot;Huangdi&quot; might originally have meant &quot;rainmaking shaman&quot; or &quot;rainmaking ritual.&quot; Citing late Warring States and early Han versions of Huangdi&#x27;s myth, he further argues that the figure of the Yellow Emperor originated in ancient rain-making rituals in which Huangdi represented the power of rain and clouds, whereas his mythical rival Chiyou (or the Yan Emperor) stood for fire and drought.

Also disagreeing with Yang Kuan&#x27;s hypothesis, Sarah Allan finds it unlikely that such a popular myth as the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s could have come from a taboo character. She argues instead that pre-Shang &quot;&#x27;history&#x27;,&quot; including the story of the Yellow Emperor, &quot;can all be understood as a later transformation and systematization of Shang mythology.&quot; In her view, Huangdi was originally an unnamed &quot;lord of the underworld&quot; (or the &quot;Yellow Springs&quot;), the mythological counterpart of the Shang sky deity Shangdi. At the time, Shang rulers claimed that their mythical ancestors, identified with &quot;the [ten] suns, birds, east, life, [and] the Lord on High&quot; (i.e., Shangdi), had defeated an earlier people associated with &quot;the underworld, dragons, west.&quot; After the Zhou dynasty overthrew the Shang dynasty in the eleventh century BC, Zhou leaders reinterpreted Shang myths as meaning that the Shang had vanquished a real political dynasty, which was eventually named the Xia dynasty. By Han times – as seen in Sima Qian&#x27;s account in the &quot;Shiji&quot; – the Yellow Emperor, who as lord of the underworld had been symbolically linked to the Xia, had become a historical ruler whose descendants were thought to have founded the Xia.

Given that the earliest extant mention of the Yellow Emperor was on a fourth-century BC Chinese bronze inscription claiming that he was the ancestor of the royal house of the state of Qi, Lothar von Falkenhausen speculates that Huangdi was invented as an ancestral figure as part of a strategy to claim that all ruling clans in the &quot;Zhou dynasty culture sphere&quot; shared common ancestry.
==History of Huangdi==

===Earliest mention===
Explicit accounts of the Yellow Emperor started to appear in Chinese texts during the Warring States period. The earliest extant mention of Huangdi is an inscription on the Chen Hou Yinqi &quot;dui&quot; (), cast during the first half of the fourth century BC by the royal family (surnamed Tian ) of the state of Qi, a powerful eastern state. As the Tian family had usurped the throne of Qi, establishing such a divine heritage would positively affect their claim to legitimacy.

Harvard University historian Michael Puett writes that the Qi bronze inscription was one of several references to the Yellow Emperor in the fourth and third centuries BC within accounts of the creation of the state. Noting that many of the thinkers who were later identified as precursors of the Huang–Lao – &quot;Huangdi and Laozi&quot; – tradition came from the state of Qi, Robin D. S. Yates hypothesizes that Huang–Lao originated in that region.

===Warring States period===
The cult of Huangdi became very popular during the Warring States period (5th century – 221 BC), a period of intense competition between rival states which ended with the unification of the realm by the state of Qin. In addition to his role as ancestor, he became associated with &quot;centralized statecraft&quot; and emerged as a figure paradigmatic of emperorship.

===The state of Qin===

In his &quot;Shiji&quot;, Sima Qian claims that the state of Qin started worshipping the Yellow Emperor in the fifth century BC, along with Yandi, the Fiery Emperor. The altars were established at Yong (near modern Fengxiang County in Shaanxi province), which was the capital of Qin from 677 to 383 BC. By the time of King Zheng, who became king of Qin in 247 BC and First Emperor of a unified China in 221 BC, Huangdi had become by far the most important of the four &quot;thearchs&quot; (&quot;di&quot; ) who were then worshiped at Yong.

===The &quot;Shiji&quot; version===
The figure of Huangdi had appeared sporadically in Warring States texts. Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Shiji&quot; (or &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;, completed around 94 BC) was the first work to turn these fragments of myths into a systematic and consistent narrative of the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s &quot;career&quot;. The &quot;Shiji&quot;″s account was extremely influential in shaping how the Chinese viewed the origin of their history.

The &quot;Shiji&quot; begins its chronological account of Chinese history with the life of Huangdi, whom it presents as a sage sovereign from antiquity. It recounts that Huangdi&#x27;s father was Shaodian and his mother was Fubao(). The Yellow Emperor had four wives. His first wife Leizu of Xiling bore him two sons. His other three wives were his second wife Fenglei (), third wife Tongyu () and fourth wife Momu (). The emperor had a total of 25 sons, 14 of whom began their own surnames and clans. The oldest was Shaohao or Xuan Xiao, who lived in Qingyang by the Yangtze River. Changyi, the second son, lived by the Ruo River. When the Yellow Emperor died, he was succeeded by Changyi&#x27;s son, Zhuan Xu.

The chronological tables found in chapters 13 of the &quot;Shiji&quot; represent all past rulers – legendary ones such as Yao and Shun, the first ancestors of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties, as well as the founders of the main ruling houses in the Zhou sphere – as descendants of Huangdi, giving the impression that Chinese history was the history of one large family.

===Imperial era===
The (), compiled by Dai De towards the end of the Western Han dynasty, carries a quote attributed to Confucius: 

The Yellow Emperor was credited with an enormous number of cultural legacies and esoteric teachings. While Taoism is often regarded in the West as arising from Laozi, many Chinese Taoists claim the Yellow Emperor formulated many of their precepts, including the quest for &quot;long life&quot;. The &quot;Yellow Emperor&#x27;s Inner Canon&quot; ( &quot;Huángdì Nèijīng&quot;), which presents the doctrinal basis of traditional Chinese medicine, was named after him. He was also credited with composing the Four Books of the Yellow Emperor ( &quot;Huángdì Sìjīng&quot;), the &quot;Yellow Emperor&#x27;s Book of the Hidden Symbol&quot; ( &quot;Huángdì Yīnfújīng&quot;), and the &quot;Yellow Emperor&#x27;s Four Seasons Poem(軒轅黃帝四季詩)&quot; included in the Tung Shing fortune-telling almanac.
&quot;Xuanyuan (+ number)&quot; is also the Chinese name for Regulus and other stars of the constellations Leo and Lynx, of which the latter is said to represent the body of the Yellow Dragon. In the Hall of Supreme Harmony in Beijing&#x27;s Forbidden City, there is also a mirror called the &quot;Xuanyuan Mirror&quot;.

===In Taoism===
In the second century AD, Huangdi&#x27;s role as a deity was diminished because of the rise of a deified Laozi. A state sacrifice offered to &quot;Huang-Lao jun&quot; was not offered to Huangdi and Laozi, as the term Huang-Lao would have meant a few centuries earlier, &quot;yellow Laozi&quot;. Nonetheless, Huangdi kept being considered as an immortal: he was seen as a master of longevity techniques and as a god who could reveal new teachings – in the form of texts such as the sixth-century &quot;Huangdi Yinfujing&quot; – to his earthly followers.

===Twentieth century===

The Yellow Emperor became a powerful national symbol in the last decade of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) and remained dominant in Chinese nationalist discourse throughout the Republican period (1912–1949). The early twentieth century is also when the Yellow Emperor was first referred to as the ancestor of all Chinese people.

====Late Qing====
Starting in 1903, radical publications started using the projected date of his birth as the first year of the Chinese calendar. Intellectuals such as Liu Shipei (1884–1919) found this practice necessary in order to &quot;preserve the [Han] race&quot; (&quot;baozhong&quot; ) from both dominance by Manchu people and foreign encroachment. Revolutionaries motivated by Anti-Manchuism such as Chen Tianhua (1875–1905), Zou Rong (1885–1905), and Zhang Binglin (1868–1936) tried to foster the racial consciousness they thought was missing from their compatriots, and thus depicted the Manchus as racially inferior barbarians who were unfit to rule over Han Chinese. Chen&#x27;s widely circulated pamphlets claimed that the &quot;Han race&quot; formed one big family descended from the Yellow Emperor. The first issue (Nov. 1905) of the &quot;Minbao&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Journal&quot;), which was founded in Tokyo by revolutionaries of the Tongmenghui, featured the Yellow Emperor on its cover and called Huangdi &quot;the first great nationalist of the world.&quot; It was one of several nationalist magazines that featured the Yellow Emperor on their cover in the early twentieth century. The fact that Huangdi meant &quot;yellow&quot; emperor also served to buttress the theory that he was the originator of the &quot;yellow race&quot;.

Many historians interpret this sudden popularity of the Yellow Emperor as a reaction to the theories of French scholar Albert Terrien de Lacouperie (1845–94), who in a book called &quot;The Western Origin of the Early Chinese Civilization, from 2300 B.C. to 200 A.D.&quot; (1892) had claimed that Chinese civilization was founded around 2300 BCE by Babylonian immigrants. Lacouperie&#x27;s &quot;Sino-Babylonianism&quot; posited that Huangdi was a Mesopotamian tribal leader who had led a massive migration of his people into China around 2300 BC and founded what later became Chinese civilization. European sinologists quickly rejected these theories, but in 1900 two Japanese historians, Shirakawa Jirō and Kokubu Tanenori, omitted these criticisms and published a long summary that presented Lacouperie&#x27;s views as the most advanced Western scholarship on China. Chinese scholars were quickly attracted by &quot;the historicization of Chinese mythology&quot; that the two Japanese authors advocated.

Anti-Manchu intellectuals and activists who searched for China&#x27;s &quot;national essence&quot; (&quot;guocui&quot; ) adapted Sino-Babylonianism to their needs. Zhang Binglin explained Huangdi&#x27;s battle with Chi You as a conflict opposing the newly arrived civilized Mesopotamians to backward local tribes, a battle that transformed China into one of the most civilized places in the world. Zhang&#x27;s reinterpretation of Sima Qian&#x27;s account &quot;underscored the need to recover the glory of early China.&quot; Liu Shipei also presented these early times as the golden age of Chinese civilization. In addition to tying the Chinese to an ancient center of human civilization in Mesopotamia, Lacouperie&#x27;s theories suggested that China should be ruled by the descendants of Huangdi. In a controversial essay called &quot;History of the Yellow Race&quot; (&quot;Huangshi&quot; ), which was published serially from 1905 to 1908, Huang Jie (; 1873–1935) claimed that the &quot;Han race&quot; was the true master of China because it was descended from the Yellow Emperor. Reinforced by the values of filial piety and the Chinese patrilineal clan, the racial vision defended by Huang and others turned vengeance against the Manchus into a duty owed to one&#x27;s ancestors.

====Republican period====
The Yellow Emperor continued to be revered after the 1911 Revolution, which overthrew the Qing dynasty. In 1912, for instance, banknotes carrying Huangdi&#x27;s effigy were issued by the new Republican government. After 1911, however, the Yellow Emperor as national symbol changed from first progenitor of the Han race to ancestor of China&#x27;s entire multi-ethnic population. Under the ideology of the Five Races Under One Union, Huangdi became the common ancestor of the Han Chinese, the Manchu people, the Mongols, the Tibetans, and the Hui people, who were said to form the Zhonghua minzu, a broadly understood Chinese nation. Sixteen state ceremonies were held between 1911 and 1949 to Huangdi as the &quot;founding ancestor of the Chinese nation&quot; () and even &quot;the founding ancestor of human civilization&quot; ().

===Modern significance===

The cult of the Yellow Emperor was forbidden in the People&#x27;s Republic of China until the end of the Cultural Revolution. The prohibition was halted during the 1980s when the government reversed itself and resurrected the &quot;Yellow Emperor cult&quot;. Starting in the 1980s, the cult was revived and phrases relating to the &quot;Descendants of Yan and Huang&quot; were sometimes used by the Chinese state when referring to people of Chinese descent. In 1984, for example, Deng Xiaoping argued for Chinese unification saying &quot;Taiwan is rooted in the hearts of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor,&quot; whereas in 1986 the PRC acclaimed the Chinese-American astronaut Taylor Wang as the first of the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s descendants to travel in space. In the first half of the 1980s, the Party had internally debated whether this usage would make ethnic minorities feel excluded. After consulting experts from Beijing University, the Chinese Academy of Social Science, and the Central Nationalities Institute, the Central Propaganda Department recommended on March 27, 1985, that the Party speak of the Zhonghua Minzu – the &quot;Chinese nation&quot; broadly defined – in official statements, but that the phrase &quot;sons and grand-sons of Yandi and the Yellow Emperor&quot; could be used in informal statements by party leaders and in &quot;relations with Hong Kong and Taiwanese compatriots and overseas Chinese compatriots&quot;.

After retreating to Taiwan in late 1949 at the end of the Chinese Civil War, Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang (KMT) ruled that the Republic of China (ROC) would keep paying homage to the Yellow Emperor on April 4, the National Tomb Sweeping Day, but neither he nor the three presidents that succeeded him ever paid homage in person. In 1955, the KMT, which was led by Mandarin speakers and still poised on retaking the mainland from the Communists, sponsored the production of the movie &quot;Children of the Yellow Emperor&quot; (&quot;Huangdi zisun&quot; ), which was filmed mostly in Taiwanese Hokkien and showed extensive passages of Taiwanese folk opera. Directed by Bai Ke (1914–1964), a former assistant of Yuan Muzhi, it was a propaganda effort to convince speakers of Taiyu that they were linked to mainland people by common blood. In 2009 Ma Ying-jeou was the first ROC president to celebrate the Tomb Sweeping Day rituals for Huangdi in person, on which occasion he proclaimed that both Chinese culture and common descent from the Yellow Emperor united people from Taiwan and the mainland. Later the same year, Lien Chan – a former Vice President of the Republic of China who is now Honorary Chairman of the Kuomintang – and his wife Lien Fang Yu paid homage at the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor in Huangling, Yan&#x27;an, in mainland China.

Gay studies researcher Louis Crompton has cited Ji Yun&#x27;s report in his popular &quot;Notes from the&quot; Yuewei &quot;Hermitage&quot; (1800), that some claimed the Yellow Emperor was the first Chinese to take male bedmates, a claim that Ji Yun dismissed. Ji Yun argued that this was probably a false attribution.

Today, Xuanyuanjiao based on Taiwan represents an organised form of Yellow Emperor worship married to Confucian orthodoxy.

==Elements of Huangdi&#x27;s myth==
As with any myth, there are numerous versions of Huangdi&#x27;s story, emphasizing different themes and interpreting the main character&#x27;s significance in different ways.

===Birth===
According to Huangfu Mi (215–282), the Yellow Emperor was born in Shou Qiu (&quot;Longevity Hill&quot;), which is today on the outskirts of the city of Qufu in Shandong. Early on, he lived with his tribe near the Ji River – Edwin Pulleyblank states that &quot;there seems to be no record of a Ji River outside the myth&quot; – and later migrated to Zhuolu in modern-day Hebei. He then became a farmer and tamed six different special beasts: the bear (), the brown bear (), the &quot;pí&quot; () and &quot;xiū&quot; () (which later combined to form the mythical Pixiu), the ferocious &quot;chū&quot; (), and the tiger ().

Huangdi is sometimes said to have been the fruit of extraordinary birth, as his mother Fubao conceived him as she was aroused, while walking in the country, by a lightning bolt from the Big Dipper. She delivered her son on the mount of Shou (Longevity) or mount Xuanyuan, after which he was named.

Another story states that &quot;Huang Di came into being when the energies that instigated the beginning of the world merged with one another, and created human beings by placing earthen statues at the cardinal points of the world and leaving them exposed for 300 years. During that time, the statues became filled with the breath of creation and eventually began to move [after the 300 years]. Huang Di...received his magic powers when he was 100 years old. He [became a &quot;xian&quot;] and, riding a dragon, rose to heaven where he became one of the five [Wufang Shangdi]. Huang Di himself rules over the fifth cardinal point, the centre.&quot;

===Achievements===
In traditional Chinese accounts, the Yellow Emperor is credited with teaching his people how to build shelters, tame wild animals, and grow the Five Grains, although other accounts credit Shennong with the last. He invents carts, boats, and clothing.

Other inventions credited to the emperor include the Chinese diadem (), throne rooms (), the bow sling, early Chinese astronomy, the Chinese calendar, math calculations, code of sound laws (), coins and the concept of money, and &quot;cuju&quot;, an early Chinese version of football. He is also sometimes said to have been partially responsible for the invention of the &quot;guqin&quot; zither, although others credit the Yan Emperor with inventing instruments for Ling Lun&#x27;s compositions.

There are other major traditions where Fuxi was the one who invented the calendar and the Yellow Emperor merely reformed and intercalated it.

In traditional accounts, he also goads the historian Cangjie into creating the first Chinese character writing system, the Oracle bone script, and his principal wife Leizu invents sericulture and teaches his people how to weave silk and dye clothes.

At one point in his reign the Yellow Emperor allegedly visited the mythical East sea and met a talking beast called the Bai Ze who taught him the knowledge of all supernatural creatures. This beast explained to him there were 11,522 (or 1,522) kinds of supernatural creatures.

===Battles===

The Yellow Emperor and the Yan Emperor were both leaders of a tribe or a combination of two tribes near the Yellow River. The Yan Emperor hailed from a different area around the Jiang River, which a geographical work called the &quot;Shuijingzhu&quot; identified as a stream near Qishan in what was the Zhou homeland before they defeated the Shang. Both emperors lived in a time of warfare. The Yan Emperor proving unable to control the disorder within his realm, the Yellow Emperor took up arms to establish his domination over various warring factions.

According to traditional accounts, the Yan Emperor meets the force of the &quot;Nine Li&quot; () under their bronze-headed leader, Chi You, and his 81 horned and four-eyed brothers and suffers a decisive defeat. He flees to Zhuolu and begs the Yellow Emperor for help. During the ensuing Battle of Zhuolu the Yellow Emperor employs his tamed animals and Chi You darkens the sky by breathing out a thick fog. This leads the emperor to develop the south-pointing chariot, which he uses to lead his army out of the miasma. He next calls upon the drought demon Nüba to dispel Chi You&#x27;s storm. He then destroys the Nine Li and defeats Chi You. Later he engages in battle with the Yan Emperor, defeating him at Banquan and replacing him as the primary ruler.

===Death===

The Yellow Emperor was said to have lived for over a hundred years before meeting a phoenix and a qilin and then dying. Two tombs were built in Shaanxi within the Mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor, in addition to others in Henan, Hebei and Gansu.

Modern-day Chinese people sometimes refer to themselves as the &quot;Descendants of Yan and Yellow Emperor&quot;, although non-Han minority groups in China may have their own myths or not count as descendants of the emperor.

==Meaning as a deity==

===Symbol of the centre of the universe===


As the Yellow Deity with Four Faces ( Huángdì Sìmiàn) he represents the centre of the universe and vision of the unity which controls the four directions. It is explained in the &quot;Huangdi Sijing&quot; (&quot;Four Scriptures of the Yellow Emperor&quot;) that regulating &quot;heart within brings order outside&quot;. In order to reign, one must &quot;reduce himself&quot; abandoning emotions, &quot;drying up like a corpse&quot;, never allowing oneself to be carried away, as the Yellow Emperor himself did during his three years of refuge on Mount Bowang in order to find himself according to the myth. This practice creates an internal void where all the vital forces of creation gather, and the more indeterminate they remain, the more powerful they will be.

It is from this centre that equilibrium and harmony emanate, equilibrium of the vital organs which becomes harmony between the person and the environment. As sovereign of the centre, the Yellow Emperor is the very image of the concentration or re-centering of the self. By self-control, taking charge of his own body one becomes powerful outside. The centre is also the vital point in the microcosm by means of which the internal universe viewed as an altar is created. The body is a universe, and by going into himself and by incorporating the fundamental structures of the universe, the sage will gain access to the gates of Heaven, the unique point where communication between Heaven, Earth and Man can occur. The centre is the convergence of within and outside, the contraction of chaos on the point which is equidistant from all directions. It is the place which is no place, where all creation is born and dies.

The Great Deity of the Central Peak ( &quot;Zhōngyuèdàdì&quot;) is another epithet representing Huangdi as the hub of creation, the &quot;axis mundi&quot; (which in Chinese mythology is Kunlun) that is the manifestation of the divine order in physical reality, that opens to immortality.

===As ancestor===

Throughout history, several sovereigns and dynasties claimed (or were claimed) to descend from the Yellow Emperor. Sima Qian&#x27;s &quot;Shiji&quot; presented Huangdi as ancestor of the two legendary rulers Yao and Shun, and traced various lines of descent from Huangdi to the founders of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties. He claimed that Liu Bang, the first emperor of the Han dynasty, was a descendant of Huangdi. He believed that the ruling house of the Qin dynasty was originated also from the Yellow Emperor, but by stating that Qin Shihuang was in fact the child of Qin chancellor Lü Buwei, he perhaps meant to leave the First Emperor out of Huangdi&#x27;s descent.

Claiming descent from illustrious ancestors remained a common tool of political legitimacy in the following ages. Wang Mang (c. 45 BC – 23 AD), of the short-lived Xin dynasty, claimed to descend from the Yellow Emperor in order to justify his overthrow of the Han. As he announced in January of 9 AD: &quot;I possess no virtue, [but] I rely upon the fact that] I am a descendant of my august original ancestor, the Yellow Emperor...&quot; About two hundred years later a ritual specialist named Dong Ba , who worked for at the court of the Cao Wei, which had recently succeeded the Han, promoted the idea that the Cao family was descended from Huangdi via Emperor Zhuanxu.

During the Tang dynasty, non-Han rulers also claimed descent from the Yellow Emperor, for individual and national prestige, as well as to connect themselves to the Tang. Most Chinese noble families also claimed descent from Huangdi. This practice was well established in Tang and Song times, when hundreds of clans claimed such descent. The main support for this theory – as recorded in the &quot;Tongdian&quot; (801 AD) and the &quot;Tongzhi&quot; (mid 12th century) – was the &quot;Shiji&quot;″s statement that Huangdi&#x27;s 25 sons were given 12 different surnames, and that these surnames had diversified into all Chinese surnames. After Emperor Zhenzong (r. 997–1022) of the Song dynasty dreamed of a figure he was told was the Yellow Emperor, the Song imperial family started to claim Huangdi as its first ancestor.

A number of overseas Chinese clans that keep a genealogy also trace their family ultimately to Huangdi, explaining their different surnames as name changes claimed to have derived from the fourteen surnames of Huangdi&#x27;s descendants. Many Chinese clans, both overseas and in China, claim Huangdi as their ancestor to reinforce their sense of being Chinese.

Gun, Yu, Zhuanxu, Zhong, Li, Shujun, and Yuqiang are various emperors, gods, and heroes whose ancestor was also supposed to be Huangdi. The Huantou, Miaomin, and Quanrong peoples were said to be descended from Huangdi.

==Traditional dates==

Although the traditional Chinese calendar did not mark years continuously, some Han-dynasty astronomers tried to determine the years of the life and reign of the Yellow Emperor. In 78 BC, under the reign of Emperor Zhao of Han, an official called Zhang Shouwang () calculated that 6,000 years had passed since the time of Huangdi; the court refused his proposal for reform, countering that only 3,629 years had elapsed. In the proleptic Julian calendar, the court&#x27;s calculations would have placed the Yellow Emperor in the late 38th century BC rather than in the 27th century BC that is conventional nowadays.

During their Jesuit missions in China in the seventeenth century, the Jesuits tried to determine what year should be considered the epoch of the Chinese calendar. In his &quot;Sinicae historiae decas prima&quot; (first published in Munich in 1658), Martino Martini (1614–1661) dated the royal ascension of Huangdi to 2697 BC, but started the Chinese calendar with the reign of Fuxi, which he claimed started in 2952 BCE. Philippe Couplet&#x27;s (1623–1693) &quot;Chronological table of Chinese monarchs&quot; (&quot;Tabula chronologica monarchiae sinicae&quot;; 1686) also gave the same date for the Yellow Emperor. The Jesuits&#x27; dates provoked great interest in Europe, where they were used for comparisons with Biblical chronology. Modern Chinese chronology has generally accepted Martini&#x27;s dates, except that it usually places the reign of Huangdi in 2698 BC (see next paragraph) and omits Huangdi&#x27;s predecessors Fuxi and Shennong, who are considered &quot;too legendary to include.&quot;

Helmer Aslaksen, a mathematician who teaches at the National University of Singapore and specializes in the Chinese calendar, explains that those who use 2698 BC as a first year probably do so because they want to have &quot;a year 0 as the starting point&quot;, or because &quot;they assume that the Yellow Emperor started his year with the Winter solstice of 2698 BC&quot;, hence the difference with the year 2697 BC calculated by the Jesuits.

Starting in 1903, radical publications started using the projected date of birth of the Yellow Emperor as the first year of the Chinese calendar. Different newspapers and magazines proposed different dates. &quot;Jiangsu&quot;, for example counted 1905 as year 4396 (making 2491 BC the first year of the Chinese calendar), whereas the &quot;Minbao&quot; (the organ of the Tongmenghui) reckoned 1905 as 4603 (first year: 2698 BC). Liu Shipei (1884–1919) created the Yellow Emperor Calendar to show the unbroken continuity of the Han race and Han culture from earliest times. There is no evidence that this calendar was used before the 20th century. Liu&#x27;s calendar started with the birth of the Yellow Emperor, which was reckoned to be 2711 BC. When Sun Yat-sen declared the foundation of the Republic of China on January 2, 1912, he decreed that this was the 12th day of the 11th month of year 4609 (epoch: 2698 BCE), but that the state would now be using the solar calendar and count 1912 as the first year of the Republic. Chronological tables published in the 1938 edition of the &quot;Cihai&quot; () dictionary followed Sun Yat-sen in using 2698 as the year of Huangdi&#x27;s accession; this chronology is now &quot;widely reproduced, with little variation.&quot;

<text>Fulcrum Press (1965 – 1974) was founded in London in the mid-1960s by medical student Stuart Montgomery (born 1938, in Rhodesia) and his wife Deirdre. Montgomery later became an eminent psychiatrist and expert in depression. Earning a reputation as the premier small press of the late 1960s to early &#x27;70s, Fulcrum published major American and British poets in the modernist and the &quot;avant-garde&quot; traditions in carefully designed books on good paper. The Fulcrum Press made a significant contribution to the British Poetry Revival and was one of the best known little presses of the period, recognized for publishing the works of Modernist poets including Ezra Pound, Basil Bunting, Allen Ginsberg and Roy Fisher.

Montgomery published Basil Bunting&#x27;s &quot;Loquitur&quot; (1965), &quot;First Book of Odes&quot; (1965), &quot;Ode II/2&quot; (1965), his landmark &quot;Briggflatts: An Autobiography&quot; (1966) and the same poet&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1968). It produced about forty books by more than twenty poets, including Pete Brown, Ed Dorn (&quot;Gunslinger 1 &amp; 2&quot;, 1970), Robert Duncan, Larry Eigner, Paul Evans, Roy Fisher, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Donald Gardner (born 1938, &quot;For the flames&quot;, 1974), Allen Ginsberg, Michael Hamburger, Lee Harwood, Spike Hawkins, Alan Jackson, David Jones, Christopher Middleton, Lorine Niedecker, Jeff Nuttall, George Oppen, Tom Pickard (with a preface by Bunting), Omar S. Pound, F. T. Prince, Tom Raworth, Jerome Rothenberg and Gary Snyder. Stuart Montgomery published two books of his own poems, &quot;Circe&quot; (1969) and &quot;Shabby Sunshine&quot; (1973), and his medical study &quot;Measures of Depression&quot; (1978).

Fulcrum Press had much of their printing done by Villiers Press in London, which in the words of Alastair Johnston &quot;was serviceable though typographically uninspired (like the City Lights books they also printed)...However, Montgomery frequently had exceptional cover art from Tom Phillips, Barnett Newman, Patrick Caulfield, Ian Dury, Ron Kitaj or Richard Hamilton.&quot;

The demise of Fulcrum came about as the consequence of a lengthy legal dispute with Scottish poet Ian Hamilton Finlay over the mistaken description of his collection &quot;The Dancers Inherit the Party&quot; as a first edition when it was published by Montgomery, who was unable to meet the costs of losing the case.

When Fulcrum Press folded in the 1970s most of the stock was pulped.

<text>The Surrey Commercial Docks were a large group of docks in Rotherhithe, South East London, located on the south bank (the Surrey side) of the River Thames. 

The docks operated in one form or another from 1696 to 1969. Most were subsequently filled in and redeveloped for residential housing, and the area is now known as Surrey Quays, although the name Surrey Docks is retained for the electoral ward.

==History==



The sparsely populated Rotherhithe peninsula was originally wet marshland alongside the river. It was unsuitable for farming, but its riverside location just downstream from the City of London made it an ideal site for docks. The area had long been associated with maritime activities: in July 1620 the Pilgrim Fathers&#x27; ship the Mayflower sailed from Rotherhithe for Southampton, to begin loading food and supplies for the voyage to New England, and a major Royal Navy dockyard was located just down the river at Deptford. In 1696, Howland Great Wet Dock (named after the family who owned the land) was dug out to form the largest dock of its time, able to accommodate 120 sailing ships.

By the mid-18th century the dock had become a base for Arctic whalers and was renamed Greenland Dock. However, by the 19th century an influx of commercial traffic from Scandinavia and the Baltic (principally timber) and Canada (foodstuffs for London&#x27;s population) led to Greenland Dock being greatly expanded and other docks being dug to accommodate the increasing number of vessels. Eventually, 85% of the peninsula, an area of 460 acres (1.9 km2), was covered by a system of nine docks, six timber ponds and a canal. Several of the docks were named after the origins of their customers&#x27; cargos, hence Canada Dock, Quebec Pond, Norway Dock and Russia Dock. The Grand Surrey Canal was opened in 1807 to link the docks with inland destinations, but proved a commercial failure and only 3 miles of it were ever built. 

The docks evolved a distinctive working culture, quite different from that of the Isle of Dogs across the river. A characteristic sight of the docks were the &quot;deal porters&quot;, dockers who specialised in carrying huge baulks of deal (timber) across their shoulders and wore special headgear to protect their heads from the rough wood. 

The decline of the docks set in after World War II, when they suffered massive damage from German air raids. The South Dock was pumped dry and used for construction of some of the concrete caissons which made up the Mulberry Harbours used on D-Day. When the shipping industry adopted the container system of cargo transportation, the docks were unable to accommodate the much larger vessels needed by containerisation. They finally closed for lack of custom in 1969. The Grand Surrey Canal was closed in 1971 and was subsequently drained and filled in. The area remained derelict for over a decade, with much of the warehousing demolished and over 90% of the docks filled in. The only surviving areas of open water were Greenland Dock, South Dock, remnants of Canada Dock (renamed Canada Water), and a basin renamed Surrey Water. In 1981, the Conservative government of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher established the London Docklands Development Corporation to redevelop the former dockyard areas east of the City of London, including the Surrey Docks.

==The area today==

During the 1980s and early 1990s, the Surrey Docks were extensively redeveloped, and renamed Surrey Quays. Over 5,500 new homes were built, ranging from individual detached housing to large apartment complexes. South Dock was converted into a marina – now the largest in London – and a watersports centre was constructed on Greenland Dock. Canada Water and the infilled Russia Dock became wildlife reserves, with a woodland park planted on the latter site. Most of Norway Dock was re-excavated to form a water feature surrounded by residential development, and another ornamental feature, the Albion Channel, was created along the eastern side of the former Albion Dock, linking Canada and Surrey Waters. Leisure facilities and a number of light industrial plants were also built, notably a new printing works for Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. 

In July 1988, the Surrey Quays shopping centre was opened as the centrepiece of the redevelopment (and rebranding) of the area. The nearby London Underground station was renamed as Surrey Quays a few months later. 

Surrey Docks is also a ward of the London Borough of Southwark. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 13,435.

<text>A sylph (also called sylphid) is an air spirit stemming from the 16th-century works of Paracelsus, who describes sylphs as (invisible) beings of the air, his elementals of air. A significant number of subsequent literary and occult works have been inspired by Paracelsus&#x27;s concept: Robert Alfred Vaughan noted that &quot;the wild but poetical fantasies&quot; of Paracelsus had probably exercised a larger influence over his age and the subsequent one than is generally supposed, particularly on the Rosicrucians, but that through the 18th century they had become reduced to &quot;machinery for the playwright&quot; and &quot;opera figurantes with wings of gauze and spangles&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Sylph&quot; is possibly a blend of from Latin &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, &quot;sylvestris&quot; being a common synonym for sylph in Paracelsus. Anthon and Trollope note a similar usage in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, where &quot;silvestris&quot; is taken as an elliptical form of &quot;nympha silvestris&quot; (&quot;forest nymph&quot;). Jacob Grimm uses this phrase as a gloss for the Anglo-Saxon &quot;wudu-mær&quot; (roughly equivalent to &quot;woodmare&quot;), which he also takes as a metaphorical name for an echo. Jan Baptist van Helmont, a near contemporary of Paracelsus and coiner of the word &quot;gas&quot;, uses &quot;sylvestris&quot; in the sense of &quot;wild&quot; to describe gaseous emissions, which may be connected to the Paracelsian usage. Thorpe&#x27;s &quot;Northern Mythology&quot; connects the adjective &quot;sylvestres&quot; and the related &quot;silvaticas&quot; to European wild man legends. A related idea is that &quot;sylph&quot; is from a hyper-urbane respelling of a Latin neologism &quot;silves&quot;, but in either case this connection to the Latin root &quot;silva&quot; (&quot;forest&quot;) is supported by Paracelsus&#x27; use of &quot;sylphes&quot; as a synonym for &quot;schrötlein&quot;, a German word for a tree spirit or especially an earth spirit in his &quot;Liber de Sanguine ultra Mortem&quot;.

An alternative theory is that it derives from silphē (), which a number of etymological sources gloss as &quot;moth&quot;. French etymological sources often derive it from a Latin word &quot;sylphus&quot;, glossed as &quot;genius&quot; (in the Latin sense, a type of spirit) and only known from an inscription rather than literary Latin. The &quot;Deutsches Wörterbuch&quot; however indicates that this idea arises from a 19th-century misreading of the inscription in question. Similarly, the σίλφη etymology can be dismissed from the lack of an objective historical and thus semantic connection. The idea of an intentional portmanteau is also considered doubtful, though extensive evidence can be found that indicates that Paracelsus considered the various sylvan spirits and wild men of legend to be examples of sylphs, which he occasionally took to be earth elementals rather than air elementals.

==Paracelsus&#x27; conception==
The Swiss German physician and alchemist Paracelsus first coined the term sylph in the 16th century to describe an air spirit in his overarching scheme of elemental spirits associated with the four Classical elements. Paracelsus drew from earlier sources, but his systematic treatment of the idea was definitive, with the names of three of the four types having originated in his works. The other three elemental spirits named were Gnomes (earth), Salamanders (fire), and Undines (water). These ideas were adopted in Rosicrucianism and were widely encountered in subsequent hermetic literature.

In the &quot;Liber de Nymphis&quot; of the &quot;Philosophia Magna&quot;, Paracelsus discusses the characteristics of the elementals at length. Sylphs, he says, are rougher, coarser, taller, and stronger than humans. The elementals are said to be able to move through their own elements as human beings move through air. Because of this, sylphs are the closest to humans in his conception because they move through air like we do, while in fire they burn, in water they drown, and in earth, they get stuck.

==In literature==
Sylphs are mentioned by that name in the 1668 German novel &quot;Simplicius Simplicissimus&quot;, though its author Grimmelshausen seems to have taken them to be water spirits.

The French pseudo-novel &quot;Comte de Gabalis&quot; (1670) was important in passing sylphs into the literary sphere. It appears to have originated the derivative term &quot;sylphid&quot; (French &quot;sylphide&quot;), which it uses as the feminine counterpart to &quot;sylph&quot;. While modern scholars consider &quot;Comte de Gabalis&quot; to have been intended as a satire of occult philosophy, many of its contemporaries considered it to be an earnest exposition of occult lore. Its author, Abbé de Montfaucon de Villars, was assassinated on the road in 1673 and one rumor had it that he had been killed by a gang of sylphs for disclosing their secrets.

One of the best-known discussions of sylphs comes with Alexander Pope. In &quot;Rape of the Lock&quot; (final ed. 1717), Pope satirizes French Rosicrucian and alchemical writings when he invents a theory to explain the sylph. In a parody of heroic poetry and the &quot;dark&quot; and &quot;mysterious&quot; alchemical literature, and in particular the sometimes esoterically Classical heroic poetry of the 18th century in England and France, Pope pretends to have a new alchemy, in which the sylph is the mystically, chemically condensed humors of peevish women. In Pope&#x27;s poem, women who are full of spleen and vanity turn into sylphs when they die because their spirits are too full of dark vapors to ascend to the skies. Belinda, the heroine of Pope&#x27;s poem, is attended by a small army of sylphs, who foster her vanity and guard her beauty.

The poem is a parody of Paracelsian ideas, inasmuch as Pope imitates the pseudo-science of alchemy to explain the seriousness with which vain women approach the dressing room. In a slight parody of the divine battle in Pope&#x27;s &quot;Rape of the Lock&quot;, when the Baron of the poem attempts to cut a lock of Belinda&#x27;s hair, the sylphs interpose their airy bodies between the blades of the scissors (to no effect whatsoever).

Ariel, the chief sylph in &quot;the Rape of the Lock&quot;, has the same name as Prospero&#x27;s servant Ariel in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; (ca. 1611), and Shakespeare&#x27;s character is described literally as an &quot;airy spirit&quot; in the &quot;dramatis personae&quot;. This name is generally thought to have been original with Shakespeare, though the exact inspiration for the character is unclear. Pope explicitly cited &quot;Comte de Gabalis&quot; as a source for elemental lore in the dedication.

In the 1778 British novel &quot;The Sylph&quot;, a sylph appears as a guardian spirit for the female protagonist.

By 1765, the French author Jean-François Marmontel had found the sylph legend notable enough that he included among his &quot;Moral Tales&quot; the story of &quot;the Sylph-Husband,&quot; in which a young woman obsessed with the idea of marrying a sylph is deluded into falling in love with her arranged-husband after he impersonates one.

In Fernando Pessoa&#x27;s &quot;Book of Disquiet&quot;, (entry 214 - New Directions, 2017) he writes (translated from the Portuguese by Margaret Jill Costa): &quot;And as with books so with everything else...Given that anything can be dreamed to serve as a real interruption to the silent flow of my days, I raise eyes of weary protest to the sylph who is mine alone, to the poor girl who, had she only learned to sing, could perhaps have been a siren&quot;.

==In ballet and opera==
The famous ballet &quot;La Sylphide&quot; (&quot;The (Female) Sylph&quot;, Paris, 1832) is a prominent example of sylph lore in theater in the 19th century. It appeared in a second version in Denmark in 1836. A similarly themed opera &quot;The Mountain Sylph&quot; appeared in England in 1834. Sylphs again took to the stage in the 1909 ballet &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;.

==In popular culture==
*Willow, a character in Terry Brooks&#x27; &quot;Magic Kingdom of Landover&quot; series of novels (1986), is a sylph and the wife of protagonist Ben Holiday. She is the daughter of the River Master and a wood elemental, giving her pale green skin and emerald hair. Her dual nature is reflected in the fact that she must transform into a willow tree once every 21 days to maintain her life force. She has a tense and distant relationship with her father, as her existence serves as a permanent reminder to him of the brief relationship he desires to reclaim, but never can. And so it is to her mother that she turns for guidance.
*The Silph Company, featured prominently within the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise, manufactures a device called the Silph Scope, which allows the user to view spectral entities otherwise unidentifiable to the naked eye. Some Pokémon are known for being inspired by the sylph.
*In Brandon Sanderson&#x27;s &quot;The Stormlight Archive&quot; series of novels (2010), the character Sylphrena is introduced as a windspren, a creature that is drawn to the element of wind and its characteristics. As other windspren, Sylphrena (Syl) possesses the ability to travel freely through the air and change her form—allowing her to adopt the features of a human, beast, or anything she wishes, including a ribbon of light.
*The lyrics of the song &quot;Desire As&quot; by Prefab Sprout from their 1985 album &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; mentions a &quot;sylph-figured creature that changes her mind&quot;. The same lyric is quoted in a song by LYR, called &quot;Winter Solstice&quot;, featuring poet laureate Simon Armitage.
* Ellen Hutter, a character in Nosferatu (2024), is referred to as a sylph by Herr Knock.

==Association with fairies==
Because of their association with the ballet &quot;La Sylphide&quot;, where sylphs are identified with fairies and the medieval legends of fairyland, as well as a confusion with other &quot;airy spirits&quot; (e.g., in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;), a slender girl may be referred to as a sylph.

&quot;Sylph&quot; has passed into general language as a term for minor spirits, elementals, or faeries of the air. Fantasy authors will sometimes employ sylphs in their fiction, for example creating giant artistic clouds in the skies with airy wings.

<doc id="439066" wikidata="Q764412" url="?curid=439066" title="Birkdale, Southport">
<text>Birkdale is an area of Southport, within the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, Merseyside, though historically in Lancashire, in the north-west of England. The area is located on the Irish Sea coast, approximately a mile away from the centre of Southport. At the 2001 census, the local government ward called Birkdale had a population of 12,265. The population of the area at the 2011 Census is shown under Birkdale (ward) (qv). Other parts of Birkdale are included in Dukes wardwhich contains a significant part of the village centre and the Royal Birkdale Golf ClubKew and Ainsdale wards.

Birkdale also inspired the name for a new urban mixed use community in the United States north of Charlotte, North Carolina in Huntersville, North Carolina called Birkdale Village.

==Etymology==
Birkdale probably takes its name from two Old Norse words, &quot;birki&quot; meaning &quot;birch-copse&quot; and &quot;dalr&quot; meaning &quot;dale&quot; or &quot;valley&quot;.

==Governance==
Birkdale is part of the Southport constituency for elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, it is currently represented by Patrick Hurley, a member of the Labour Party.

For elections to Sefton Council Birkdale acts as a single electoral ward, it currently has three councillors, their names are Iain Brodie - Browne, Richard Hands, and Simon Shaw, all are members of the Liberal Democrats.

Birkdale was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of North Meols, in 1866 Birkdale became a separate civil parish, in 1894 Birkdale became an Urban District which from 1905 also contained the parish of Ainsdale, on 1 April 1912 the district and parish were abolished and merged with Southport. In 1911 the parish had a population of 15,900.

Until 1 April 1974, Birkdale lay in the county of Lancashire.

==Demography==
On the whole it is a wealthy area featuring many large Victorian and Edwardian houses; many of the houses have not yet been broken up into individual flats, and still house families. The area is almost entirely residential, with mainly semi-detached houses as the norm. In the summer of 2003, the average property price was £149,550 (just under £10,000 less than the national average). This has risen to £200,844 in July 2005, more than £20,000 over the national mix-adjusted national average house price. The area has been a popular area with footballers from local Merseyside or Lancashire clubs.

Birkdale Village is on Liverpool Road and features a variety of shops, bars and restaurants. Birkdale railway station is situated on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network, that links Southport to Liverpool.

==Sport==
Despite its small size, Birkdale receives a great deal of sporting attention once every few years as it plays host to The Open Championship. It was last played at the Royal Birkdale golf course in July 2017. To lesser fame, the home ground of the Southport and Birkdale Cricket Club on Trafalgar Road is used for county level cricket matches approximately once a year. Southport and Birkdale squash club also play here and are in the North West Counties Squash League.

Red Rum, a racehorse who was trained by Ginger McCain, had his stables in Upper Aughton Road in Birkdale, while a horse named after the village took part and finished tenth in the 2002 Grand National. Birkdale United AFC played a crucial part in the footballing education of Premiership footballers such as Jack Rodwell, Dominic Matteo, Shaun Teale and Paul Dalglish, and still has its home in the village, boasting teams for boys from the age of 6 and girls from the age of 7 through to open age teams. The club was also presented the FA&#x27;s highest accolade in January 2008, becoming the first FA Charter Community Club in Southport.

<text>Metapolitics (sometimes written meta-politics) describes political attempts to speak in a metalinguistic sense about politics; that is, to have a political dialogue about politics itself. Activists who use the phrase often view metapolitics as a form of &quot;inquiry&quot; in which the discourse of politics, and the political itself, is reimagined and reappropriated. The term was coined by Marxists and is almost always used in the context of ideological discourse among the far-left and far-right, unlike the wider academic field of political philosophy. Those citing the term often do so in an attempt to take a &quot;self-conscious&quot; role in describing their preferred form of political inquiry.

==Contemporary thought==

The term &quot;metapolitics&quot; originated from left-wing French academics, being first popularized by Alain Badiou and Jacques Rancière. Discussing Badiou&#x27;s &quot;Metapolitics&quot;, Bruno Bosteels asserts that:

<doc id="439075" wikidata="Q3991639" url="?curid=439075" title="Hair coloring">
<text>Hair coloring, or hair dyeing, is the practice of changing the color of the hair on humans&#x27; heads. The main reasons for this are cosmetic: to cover gray or white hair, to alter hair to create a specific look, to change a color to suit preference or to restore the original hair color after it has been discolored by hairdressing processes or sun bleaching.

Hair coloring can be done professionally by a hairdresser or independently at home. Hair coloring is very popular, with 50-80% of women in the United States, Europe, and Japan having reported using hair dye. At-home coloring in the United States reached sales of $1.9 billion in 2011 and was expected to rise to $2.2 billion by 2016.

==History==

The dyeing of hair is an ancient art that involves treatment of the hair with various chemical compounds. Assyrian herbals dating back to contain some of the oldest recipes for cosmetic preparations known, including hair dye. The ancient Egyptian Ebers Papyrus, , has recipes for dyeing gray hair and eyebrows. Assyrian clay tablets dated to the 7th century BCE mention using the gall of a black ox, cypress oil, licorice, and honey to turn gray hair black. In ancient times, the dyes were frequently obtained from plants. Some of the most well known are henna (&quot;Lawsonia inermis&quot;), indigo dye, &quot;Cassia obovata&quot;, senna, turmeric, and amla. Others include katam (&quot;buxus dioica&quot;), black walnut hulls, red ochre, and leeks.

Diodorus Siculus, a Greek historian, described in detail how Celtic people dyed their hair blonde: &quot;Their aspect is terrifying. They are very tall in stature, with rippling muscles under clear white skin. Their hair is blond, but not naturally so: they bleach it, to this day, artificially, washing it in lime and combing it back from their foreheads. They look like wood-demons, their hair thick and shaggy like a horse&#x27;s mane. Some of them are clean-shaven, but others — especially those of high rank — shave their cheeks but leave a moustache that covers the whole mouth.&quot;

Hair coloring recipes were common in the medieval period and Renaissance. Trotula&#x27;s &quot;De ornatu mulierum&quot; (&quot;On Women’s Cosmetics&quot;), from the 12th century, has multiple recipes for bleaching and coloring hair. In the 1661 book &quot;Eighteen Books of the Secrets of Art &amp; Nature&quot;, various methods of coloring hair black, gold, green, red, yellow, and white are explained. The development of synthetic dyes for hair is traced to the 1860s discovery of the reactivity of para-phenylenediamine (PPD) with air. Eugène Schueller, the founder of L&#x27;Oréal, is recognized for creating the first synthetic hair dye in 1907. In 1947 the German cosmetics firm Schwarzkopf launched the first home color product, &quot;Poly Color&quot;. Hair dyeing is now a multibillion-dollar industry that involves the use of both plant-derived and synthetic dyes.

==Application techniques==
All coloring techniques can be used with any type of color. For lightening, the hair has to be bleached.

===Off-scalp ===
Hair color was traditionally applied to the hair as one overall color. The modern trend is to use several colors to produce streaks or gradations. These are referred to as:

* &quot;Highlighting&quot;, where sections of hair are treated with lighteners
* &quot;Lowlighting&quot;, where sections of hair are treated with darker hair colors
* &quot;Splashlighting&quot;, a horizontal band of bleached hair from ear to ear

There are also newer coloring techniques such as ombré, shatush, balayage, airtouch, in which hair is dark on the crown and bit by bit becomes lighter toward the ends.

These are off-the-scalp techniques, and can be applied by the following methods:
* &quot;Foiling&quot;, where pieces of foil or plastic film are used to separate the hair to be colored. Employed especially when more than one color is to be applied, this method ensures that only the desired hair strands are colored, and the rest spared.
* &quot;Cap&quot;, when a plastic cap is placed tightly on the head and strands are pulled through with a hook, a method infrequently practiced other than for applying highlights to short hair.
* &quot;Balayage&quot;, where hair color is painted directly onto sections of the hair with no foils used to keep the color contained, a method growing in popularity due to its observed effect of appearing more natural. The difference between balayage and ombré is that a balayage requires more precise hand-painting sections of hair and typically costs more. 
* &quot;Baby lights&quot;, very thin highlights that are created by using a fine color technique, baby light results are very natural and subtle.
* &quot;Dipping or tip dyeing&quot;, where tips of the hair are dipped directly into dye.

===On-scalp===
Hair coloring can also be applied on the scalp for a more solid level of coverage.

* &quot;All-over color&quot;, where the person wants all of their hair to be a different solid color
* &quot;Root touch-up&quot;, where color is applied only to the most recent section of re-growth, usually the first inch of hair nearest the scalp. Root touch-ups are repeated every 4 to 6 weeks as the natural color grows in and becomes apparent. People who color their hair to disguise gray often have root touch-ups. 
* &quot;Block coloring&quot;, where the person wants two or more colors applied to their hair, resulting in dimension and contrast

==Plant-based dyes==
Henna is an orange dye commonly used as a deposit-only hair color whose active component, lawsone, binds to keratin. It is therefore considered semi-permanent to permanent, depending on a person&#x27;s hair type. Most people will achieve a permanent color from henna, especially after the second dye. With repeated use the orange color builds up into red and then auburn. While &quot;natural&quot; henna is generally a red color, variations exist. These variations usually contain ingredients from other plants and even synthetic dyes.

Indigo is natural dye from a plant (&quot;Indigofera tinctoria&quot;, &quot;I. suffructicosa&quot;, or &quot;I. arrecta&quot;) that can be added to henna or layered on top of it to create brown to black colors in the hair. Henna is orange, and indigo is blue, so as complementaries on a standard color wheel, the two colors&#x27; combined effect is to create brown tones. Like henna, indigo may fade after one application, but it becomes permanent on the hair with repeated use.

Using a plant-based color such as henna can cause problems later when trying to do a perm or permanent synthetic hair color, as some store-bought henna in addition contains metallic salts which react to hydrogen peroxide. This reaction may lead to unpredictable results, such as unwanted greenish or blueish tones. These added metallic salts also can cause skin irritation. Pure henna and purely plant-based mixes of henna, indigo (&quot;black henna&quot;), walnut hulls etc. without such addition are commercially available, too.

In 2018, a system for making semi-permanent hair dyes from renewable waste blackcurrant (&quot;Ribes nigrum L.&quot;) fruit skins from the fruit pressing industry was developed. Anthocyanin pigments were extracted from the blackcurrant skin waste and formulated into hair dyes. The dyes showed high buildup on hair and gave an intense blue color, which was stable to multiple washes.

==Synthetic dyes==
The four most common classifications are &quot;permanent&quot;, &quot;demi-permanent&quot; (sometimes called &quot;deposit only&quot;), &quot;semi-permanent&quot;, and &quot;temporary&quot;.

===Permanent synthetic dyes===
Permanent hair color generally contains ammonia and must be mixed with a developer or oxidizing agent in order to permanently change hair color. Ammonia is used in permanent hair color to open the cuticle layer so that the developer and colorants together can penetrate into the cortex. The developer, or oxidizing agent, comes in various volumes. The higher the developer volume, the higher the &quot;lift&quot; will be of a person&#x27;s natural hair pigment. Someone with dark hair wishing to achieve two or three shades lighter may need a higher developer whereas someone with lighter hair wishing to achieve darker hair will not need one as high. Timing may vary with permanent hair coloring but is typically 30 minutes or 45 minutes for those wishing to achieve maximum color change.

===Demi-permanent synthetic dyes===
(24±4 shampoos typically) Demi-permanent is hair coloring that contains an alkaline agent (e.g. ethanolamine, sodium carbonate) other than ammonia, and while always employed with a developer, the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in that developer may be lower than used with a permanent hair color. These products provide almost no lightening of hair&#x27;s color during dyeing, since the alkaline agents employed in demi-permanent colors are less effective in removing the natural pigment of hair than ammonia. As the result, they cannot color hair to a lighter shade than it was before dyeing and are less damaging to hair than their permanent counterpart.

Demi-permanents are much more effective at covering gray hair than semi-permanents, but less so than permanents.

Demi-permanents have several advantages as compared with permanent color. Because there is essentially no lifting (i.e., removal) of natural hair color, the final color is less uniform/homogeneous than a permanent and therefore more natural looking; they are gentler on hair and therefore safer, especially for damaged hair; and they wash out over time (typically 20 to 28 shampoos), so root regrowth is less noticeable and if a change of color is desired, it is easier to achieve. Demi-permanent hair colors are not permanent but the darker shades in particular may persist longer than indicated on the packet.

===Semi-permanent synthetic dyes===
(6±2 shampoos typically) Semi-permanent hair coloring cannot lighten the hair either. Because it involves no developer (hydrogen peroxide) or ammonia, it is thus less damaging to hair strands than their demi-permanent counterpart.

There will be subtle variations in shade across the entire head, because of hair&#x27;s color and porosity along the length of a hair strand. The final color of each strand of hair will depend on its original color and porosity. This variation gives a more natural looking result than the solid all over color of a permanent. Because gray or white hairs have a different starting color than other hair, they will not appear as the same shade as the rest of the hair when treated with semi-permanent color. If there are only minimal grey/white hairs, the effect will usually be enough for them to blend in, but as the gray spreads, there will come a point where it will not be disguised as well. In this case, the move to demi-permanent as a base can be used sometimes adding highlights, to delay permanent coloring.

Semi-permanent hair color uses compounds of lower molecular weight than are found in temporary hair color dyes. These dyes are only able to wedge under the cuticle layer of the hair shaft only. For this reason, the color will survive limited washing, typically 4–8 shampoos.

Semi-permanents may still contain the suspected carcinogen p-phenylenediamine (PPD) or other related colorant carcinogens. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reported chronic exposure to PPD in the diet of rats and mice depressed body weight of the animals, with no other clinical signs of toxicity observed in several studies.

== Temporary color ==
Temporary hair color is available in various forms including rinses, shampoos, gels, sprays, and foams. Temporary hair color is typically brighter and more vibrant than semi-permanent and permanent hair color. It is most often used to color hair for special occasions such as Christmas and Halloween costume parties.

The pigments in temporary hair color cannot penetrate the cuticle layer of the hair. The color particles remain (closely adherent) to the surface of the hair shaft and are easily removed with a single shampooing. Temporary hair color can persist on hair that is excessively dry or damaged in a way that allows for migration of the pigment to the interior of the hair shaft.
Some plants can be used for temporary coloring, too, e.g. beet juice. 

== Alternative color ==

Alternative hair coloring products are designed to create hair colors not typically found in nature. These are also referred to as &quot;vivid color&quot; in the hairstyling industry. The available colors are diverse, such as the colors green and fuchsia.
Permanent alternatives in some colors are available. More recently, blacklight-reactive hair dyes have been brought to market that fluoresce under blacklights, such as those often used at nightclubs.

The chemical formulae of alternative color dyes typically contain only tint and have no developer. This means that they will only create the bright color of the packet if they are applied to light blond hair. Darker hair (medium brown to black) would need to be bleached in order for these pigment applications to take to the hair desirably. Some types of fair hair may also take vivid colors more fully after bleaching. Gold, yellow and orange undertones in hair that has not been lightened enough can muddy the final hair color, especially with pink, blue and green dyes. Although some alternative colors are semi-permanent, such as blue and purple, it could take several months to fully wash the color from bleached or pre-lightened hair.

== Hair bleaching ==
Hair is given a lighter color by bleaching it. Melanin pigments, which give hair a darker color, can be broken down with oxidation. The oxidizing agent used to bleach hair is hydrogen peroxide. It is mixed with ammonia to create an alkaline solution and to speed up the reaction. When melanin is oxidized, oxygen gas is released.

Products for bleaching one&#x27;s hair at home usually contain a 6% solution of hydrogen peroxide, while products for use in a hair salon can contain up to 9%.

Peroxide bleached hair can have undesirable brassy or yellow hue. A product known as a toner is used to slightly alter the hair color&#x27;s undertones. Purple shampoo (shampoo with purple coloring agents) can also be used to counteract brassy undertones.

== Adverse effects ==
Hair coloring can involve the use of chemicals capable of removing, replacing, and/or covering up pigments naturally found inside the hair shaft. Use of these chemicals can result in a range of adverse effects, including temporary skin irritation and allergy, hair breakage, skin discoloration and unexpected hair color results. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), in vitro and in vivo studies (in exposed human populations) have shown that some hair dyes and many chemicals used in the hair dyeing process can be considered mutagenic and carcinogenic.

===Skin irritation and allergy===
In certain individuals, the use of hair coloring can result in allergic reactions and/or skin irritation. Individuals allergic to gluten for example, will need to be cautious when purchasing hair color since certain hair dye includes gluten. Gluten does not need to be ingested for it to cause an allergy. Skin contact with gluten may cause a reaction; therefore, leading to an allergy. Symptoms of these reactions can include redness, sores, itching, burning sensation and discomfort. Symptoms will sometimes not be apparent immediately following the application and processing of the tint, but can also arise after hours or even a day later.

To help prevent or limit allergic reactions, the majority of hair color products recommend that the client conduct a patch test before using the product. This involves mixing a small quantity of tint preparation and applying it directly to the skin for a period of 48 hours. If irritation develops, manufacturers recommend that the client not use the product.

European dermatologists have, however, strongly advised against such pre-use testing, as it entails additional sensitisation (allergy) risk and the interpretation by lay people may not be sufficiently accurate.

===Skin discoloration===
Skin and fingernails are made of a similar type of keratinized protein as hair. That means that drips, slips and extra hair tint around the hairline can result in patches of discolored skin. This is more common with darker hair colors and persons with dry absorbent skin. That is why it is recommended that latex or nitrile gloves be worn to protect the hands.

This discoloration will disappear as the skin naturally renews itself and the top layer of skin is removed (typically takes a few days or at most a week). Ways of preventing skin discoloration are to wear latex or nitrile gloves to protect the hands and also by applying a thin layer of petroleum jelly or oil-based preparation around the hairline. Gentle abrasives such as moist baking soda or a small amount of toothpaste applied with a toothbrush may also help remove the uppermost layer of skin and dye (neither removes just the dye). Acetone and nail polish remover are not considered effective; laundry detergent may sometimes work as may moist cigarette ash rubbed into the stained area.{explain}

===Health concerns===
* The salt lead acetate (formerly the active ingredient in gradual darkening products such as Grecian formula) is toxic. Lead acetate trihydrate has also been shown to cause reproductive toxicity.
* Articles link the development of some forms of cancer (including leukemia, non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, bladder cancer, blood cancer, and multiple myeloma) with use of hair color. More specifically, prolonged use of permanent dark hair dyes can double a person&#x27;s risk of getting some types of blood cancer.
*In 2004 a known human carcinogen, 4-aminobiphenyl or 4-ABP, was found in some commercial hair dyes. However, evidence is limited and inconsistent for the link between cancer from hair dye.
*Phenylenediamine is known to cause health concerns, such as skin irritation. Exposure to phenylenediamine can occur during manufacturing or during the use of hair dyes. According to the Product Safety Summary Sheet by DuPont, Para-Phenyenediamine (PPD) is labeled as toxic and can cause adverse effects on aquatic organisms and could cause long-term effects in aquatic environments.
In October 2017, the leading breast surgeon Professor Kefah Mokbel published a meta-analysis showing that use of hair dyes might increase the risk of developing breast cancer by 20% among users. Another 2019 study found similar results.

==Chemistry of synthetic permanent hair coloring==
Synthetic permanent hair coloring requires three components: (1) 1,4-diaminobenzene (historically) or 2,5-diaminotoluene (currently), (2) a coupling agent, and (3) an oxidant. The process is typically performed under basic conditions. The mechanism of oxidation dyes involves three steps:
1) Oxidation of 1,4-diaminobenzene derivative to the quinone state.
2) Reaction of this diimine with a coupler compound (more detail below).
3) Oxidation of the resulting compound to give the final dye.

The preparation (dye precursors) is in the leuco (colorless) form. Oxidizing agents are usually hydrogen peroxide, and the alkaline environment is usually provided by ammonia. The combination of hydrogen peroxide and ammonia causes the natural hair to be lightened, providing a &quot;blank canvas&quot; for the dye. Ammonia opens the hair shaft pores so that the dye can actually diffuse inside the fiber. These dye intermediates and coupler compounds can undergo oxidation and coupling reaction as shown in the scheme below to form high molecular weight products, which are trapped in the hair matrix and cannot be readily removed through washing.

Various combinations of primary intermediates and coupler compounds provide a spectrum of shades of hair colors. The primary intermediates are aromatic para compounds, such as 1,4-diaminobenzene or 4-aminophenol. The coupler compounds (couplers) are meta-substituted derivatives of aniline. They come in three major classes based on the color that they produce when they react with the primary intermediate.
*Blue couplers include 1,3-diaminobenzene and its derivatives.
*Red couplers include phenols and naphthols, such as 3-aminophenol (CAS#591-27-5), 5-amino-2-methylphenol (CAS#2835-95-2) and 1-naphthol (CAS#90-15-3). The combination of 2,5-diaminotoluene with the coupler 3-aminophenol gives a magenta-brown dye, while the combination of 2,5-diaminotoluene with the coupler 1-naphthol gives a purple dye.
*Yellow-green couplers include resorcinol, 4-chlororesorcinol, and benzodioxoles. These compounds produce broad-band absorption when they react to form dyes, allowing for more natural-looking hair colors. The combination of 2,5-diaminotoluene with the coupler resorcinol gives a greenish brown dye.
The first step shows the oxidation of p-phenylenediamine to the quinonediimine (C6H4(NH)2):
This species exists in equilibrium with the monoprotonated form (C6H4(NH)(NH2)+) (not shown). The second step involves the attack of this quinonediimine on the coupler. In organic chemistry, this reaction is called electrophilic aromatic substitution:
In the third and final step, the product from the quinonediimine-coupler reaction oxidizes to the final hair dye.
It was once believed that the dye forms in the above reaction bonds to hair permanently. It was later shown that the main reason that this reaction imparts a permanent color on hair is that it produces larger dye molecules, which is locked inside the hair.

== Legal restrictions ==
Hair dyes are cosmetic compounds that make contact with the skin during application. Because of this skin contact, there exists some health risk associated with use of hair dyes. Thus, hair dyes are regulated in the commercial marketplace and, as new toxicity data is generated for some hair dyes and health risks are discovered, some of these hair dyes are being legally restricted from the cosmetic marketplace.

The European Union is particularly stringent with regard to health regulations. To ensure that hair dyes contain only safe substances, the European Commission adopted the Directive 2012/21/EU to restrict the use of around 45 chemicals in hair dyes. The directive on dyes is part of a general and comprehensive set of regulations, the EU Cosmetics Directive 76/768/EC.

== Religion ==
For Muslims, if a man is not of advanced age, there is no harm in his using black dye. Some of the early Muslims, including some sahabah, permitted the use of black dye. As narrated in a hadith, the best thing with which to dye gray hair is henna and katam (a plant from Yemen which colors it black tinged with red).

<doc id="439082" wikidata="Q6927157" url="?curid=439082" title="Moving frame">
<text>In mathematics, a moving frame is a flexible generalization of the notion of an ordered basis of a vector space often used to study the extrinsic differential geometry of smooth manifolds embedded in a homogeneous space.

==Introduction==

In lay terms, a &quot;frame of reference&quot; is a system of measuring rods used by an observer to measure the surrounding space by providing coordinates. A moving frame is then a frame of reference which moves with the observer along a trajectory (a curve). The method of the moving frame, in this simple example, seeks to produce a &quot;preferred&quot; moving frame out of the kinematic properties of the observer. In a geometrical setting, this problem was solved in the mid 19th century by Jean Frédéric Frenet and Joseph Alfred Serret. The Frenet–Serret frame is a moving frame defined on a curve which can be constructed purely from the velocity and acceleration of the curve.

The Frenet–Serret frame plays a key role in the differential geometry of curves, ultimately leading to a more or less complete classification of smooth curves in Euclidean space up to congruence. The Frenet–Serret formulas show that there is a pair of functions defined on the curve, the torsion and curvature, which are obtained by differentiating the frame, and which describe completely how the frame evolves in time along the curve. A key feature of the general method is that a preferred moving frame, provided it can be found, gives a complete kinematic description of the curve.

In the late 19th century, Gaston Darboux studied the problem of constructing a preferred moving frame on a surface in Euclidean space instead of a curve, the Darboux frame (or the &quot;trièdre mobile&quot; as it was then called). It turned out to be impossible in general to construct such a frame, and that there were integrability conditions which needed to be satisfied first.

Later, moving frames were developed extensively by Élie Cartan and others in the study of submanifolds of more general homogeneous spaces (such as projective space). In this setting, a frame carries the geometric idea of a basis of a vector space over to other sorts of geometrical spaces (Klein geometries). Some examples of frames are:

* A linear frame is an ordered basis of a vector space.
* An orthonormal frame of a vector space is an ordered basis consisting of orthogonal unit vectors (an orthonormal basis).
* An affine frame of an affine space consists of a choice of origin along with an ordered basis of vectors in the associated difference space.
* A Euclidean frame of an affine space is a choice of origin along with an orthonormal basis of the difference space.
* A projective frame on &quot;n&quot;-dimensional projective space is an ordered collection of &quot;n&quot;+2 points such that any subset of &quot;n&quot;+1 points is linearly independent. 
* Frame fields in general relativity are four-dimensional frames, or vierbeins, in German.

In each of these examples, the collection of all frames is homogeneous in a certain sense. In the case of linear frames, for instance, any two frames are related by an element of the general linear group. Projective frames are related by the projective linear group. This homogeneity, or symmetry, of the class of frames captures the geometrical features of the linear, affine, Euclidean, or projective landscape. A moving frame, in these circumstances, is just that: a frame which varies from point to point.

Formally, a frame on a homogeneous space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; consists of a point in the tautological bundle &quot;G&quot; → &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;. A moving frame is a section of this bundle. It is &quot;moving&quot; in the sense that as the point of the base varies, the frame in the fibre changes by an element of the symmetry group &quot;G&quot;. A moving frame on a submanifold &quot;M&quot; of &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; is a section of the pullback of the tautological bundle to &quot;M&quot;. Intrinsically a moving frame can be defined on a principal bundle &quot;P&quot; over a manifold. In this case, a moving frame is given by a &quot;G&quot;-equivariant mapping φ : &quot;P&quot; → &quot;G&quot;, thus &quot;framing&quot; the manifold by elements of the Lie group &quot;G&quot;.

One can extend the notion of frames to a more general case: one can &quot;solder&quot; a fiber bundle to a smooth manifold, in such a way that the fibers behave as if they were tangent. When the fiber bundle is a homogenous space, this reduces to the above-described frame-field. When the homogenous space is a quotient of special orthogonal groups, this reduces to the standard conception of a vierbein. 

Although there is a substantial formal difference between extrinsic and intrinsic moving frames, they are both alike in the sense that a moving frame is always given by a mapping into &quot;G&quot;. The strategy in Cartan&#x27;s method of moving frames, as outlined briefly in Cartan&#x27;s equivalence method, is to find a &quot;natural moving frame&quot; on the manifold and then to take its Darboux derivative, in other words pullback the Maurer-Cartan form of &quot;G&quot; to &quot;M&quot; (or &quot;P&quot;), and thus obtain a complete set of structural invariants for the manifold.

== Method of the moving frame ==
 formulated the general definition of a moving frame and the method of the moving frame, as elaborated by . The elements of the theory are

* A Lie group &quot;G&quot;.
* A Klein space &quot;X&quot; whose group of geometric automorphisms is &quot;G&quot;.
* A smooth manifold Σ which serves as a space of (generalized) coordinates for &quot;X&quot;.
* A collection of &quot;frames&quot; ƒ each of which determines a coordinate function from &quot;X&quot; to Σ (the precise nature of the frame is left vague in the general axiomatization).

The following axioms are then assumed to hold between these elements:

* There is a free and transitive group action of &quot;G&quot; on the collection of frames: it is a principal homogeneous space for &quot;G&quot;. In particular, for any pair of frames ƒ and ƒ′, there is a unique transition of frame (ƒ→ƒ′) in &quot;G&quot; determined by the requirement (ƒ→ƒ′)ƒ = ƒ′.
* Given a frame ƒ and a point &quot;A&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;, there is associated a point &quot;x&quot; = (&quot;A&quot;,ƒ) belonging to Σ. This mapping determined by the frame ƒ is a bijection from the points of &quot;X&quot; to those of Σ. This bijection is compatible with the law of composition of frames in the sense that the coordinate &quot;x&quot;′ of the point &quot;A&quot; in a different frame ƒ′ arises from (&quot;A&quot;,ƒ) by application of the transformation (ƒ→ƒ′). That is, formula_1

Of interest to the method are parameterized submanifolds of &quot;X&quot;. The considerations are largely local, so the parameter domain is taken to be an open subset of Rλ. Slightly different techniques apply depending on whether one is interested in the submanifold along with its parameterization, or the submanifold up to reparameterization.

== Moving tangent frames ==

The most commonly encountered case of a moving frame is for the bundle of tangent frames (also called the &quot;frame bundle&quot;) of a manifold. In this case, a moving tangent frame on a manifold &quot;M&quot; consists of a collection of vector fields &quot;e&quot;1, &quot;e&quot;2, …, &quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot; forming a basis of the tangent space at each point of an open set .

If formula_2 is a coordinate system on &quot;U&quot;, then each vector field &quot;ej&quot; can be expressed as a linear combination of the coordinate vector fields formula_3:formula_4where each formula_5 is a function on &quot;U&quot;. These can be seen as the components of a matrix formula_6. This matrix is useful for finding the coordinate expression of the dual coframe, as explained in the next section.

===Coframes===

A moving frame determines a dual frame or coframe of the cotangent bundle over &quot;U&quot;, which is sometimes also called a moving frame. This is a &quot;n&quot;-tuple of smooth &quot;1&quot;-forms
:&quot;θ&quot;1, &quot;θ&quot;2, …, &quot;θ&quot;&quot;n&quot;

which are linearly independent at each point &quot;q&quot; in &quot;U&quot;. Conversely, given such a coframe, there is a unique moving frame &quot;e&quot;1, &quot;e&quot;2, …, &quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot; which is dual to it, i.e., satisfies the duality relation &quot;θ&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;e&quot;&quot;j&quot;) = &quot;δ&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;j&quot;, where &quot;δ&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;j&quot; is the Kronecker delta function on &quot;U&quot;.

If formula_2 is a coordinate system on &quot;U&quot;, as in the preceding section, then each covector field &quot;θ&quot;i can be expressed as a linear combination of the coordinate covector fields formula_8:formula_9where each formula_10 is a function on &quot;U.&quot; Since formula_11, the two coordinate expressions above combine to yield formula_12; in terms of matrices, this just says that formula_6 and formula_14 are inverses of each other.

In the setting of classical mechanics, when working with canonical coordinates, the canonical coframe is given by the tautological one-form. Intuitively, it relates the velocities of a mechanical system (given by vector fields on the tangent bundle of the coordinates) to the corresponding momenta of the system (given by vector fields in the cotangent bundle; i.e. given by forms). The tautological one-form is a special case of the more general solder form, which provides a (co-)frame field on a general fiber bundle.

===Uses===

Moving frames are important in general relativity, where there is no privileged way of extending a choice of frame at an event &quot;p&quot; (a point in spacetime, which is a manifold of dimension four) to nearby points, and so a choice must be made. In contrast in special relativity, &quot;M&quot; is taken to be a vector space &quot;V&quot; (of dimension four). In that case a frame at a point &quot;p&quot; can be translated from &quot;p&quot; to any other point &quot;q&quot; in a well-defined way. Broadly speaking, a moving frame corresponds to an observer, and the distinguished frames in special relativity represent inertial observers.

In relativity and in Riemannian geometry, the most useful kind of moving frames are the orthogonal and orthonormal frames, that is, frames consisting of orthogonal (unit) vectors at each point. At a given point &quot;p&quot; a general frame may be made orthonormal by orthonormalization; in fact this can be done smoothly, so that the existence of a moving frame implies the existence of a moving orthonormal frame.

===Further details===

A moving frame always exists &quot;locally&quot;, i.e., in some neighbourhood &quot;U&quot; of any point &quot;p&quot; in &quot;M&quot;; however, the existence of a moving frame globally on &quot;M&quot; requires topological conditions. For example when &quot;M&quot; is a circle, or more generally a torus, such frames exist; but not when &quot;M&quot; is a 2-sphere. A manifold that does have a global moving frame is called &quot;parallelizable&quot;. Note for example how the unit directions of latitude and longitude on the Earth&#x27;s surface break down as a moving frame at the north and south poles.

The method of moving frames of Élie Cartan is based on taking a moving frame that is adapted to the particular problem being studied. For example, given a curve in space, the first three derivative vectors of the curve can in general define a frame at a point of it (cf. torsion tensor for a quantitative description – it is assumed here that the torsion is not zero). In fact, in the method of moving frames, one more often works with coframes rather than frames. More generally, moving frames may be viewed as sections of principal bundles over open sets &quot;U&quot;. The general Cartan method exploits this abstraction using the notion of a Cartan connection.

== Atlases==
In many cases, it is impossible to define a single frame of reference that is valid globally. To overcome this, frames are commonly pieced together to form an atlas, thus arriving at the notion of a local frame. In addition, it is often desirable to endow these atlases with a smooth structure, so that the resulting frame fields are differentiable.

==Generalizations==
Although this article constructs the frame fields as a coordinate system on the tangent bundle of a manifold, the general ideas move over easily to the concept of a vector bundle, which is a manifold endowed with a vector space at each point, that vector space being arbitrary, and not in general related to the tangent bundle.

==Applications==
Aircraft maneuvers can be expressed in terms of the moving frame (aircraft principal axes) when described by the pilot.

<text>The Pregolya or Pregola (; ; ; ) is a river in the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast exclave.

==Name==
A possible ancient name by Ptolemy of the Pregolya River is Chronos (from Germanic *&quot;hrauna&quot;, &quot;stony&quot;), although other theories identify Chronos as a much larger river, the Nemunas.

The oldest recorded names of the river are &quot;Prigora&quot; (1302), &quot;Pregor&quot; (1359), &quot;Pregoll, Pregel&quot; (1331), &quot;Pregill&quot; (1460). Georg Gerullis connected the name with Lithuanian &quot;prãgaras&quot;, &quot;pragorė̃&quot; (&quot;abyss&quot;) and the Lithuanian verb &quot;gérti&quot; (&quot;drink&quot;). Vytautas Mažiulis instead derived it from &quot;spragė́ti&quot; or &quot;sprógti&quot; (&quot;burst&quot;) and the suffix -&quot;ara&quot; (&quot;river&quot;).

==Overview==
It starts as a confluence of the Instruch and the Angrapa and drains into the Baltic Sea through the Vistula Lagoon. Its length under the name of Pregolya is 123 km, 292 km including the Angrapa. The basin has an area of 15,500 km2. The average flow is 90 m3/s.

Euler&#x27;s Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem was based on the bridges crossing the river in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad).

<doc id="439094" wikidata="Q1761319" url="?curid=439094" title="Cheek piercing">
<text>Cheek piercing (also known as a &quot;dimple&quot;) is a facial body piercing through the cheek. The most common variation of the cheek piercing penetrates the facial tissue into the oral cavity. The usual placement is symmetrical on either side of the face, either penetrating (and enhancing) or imitating dimples. 

The piercing can cause nerve damage and may leak or secrete lymph fluid, which has a saliva-like texture and can create an unpleasant odor. An alternative is microdermal implants, placed in the intended dimple location. This method avoids drawbacks of full cheek piercings. Though microdermals do have a slightly larger chance to leave a scar than a piercing, they will heal eventually and be almost unnoticeable. The rate of infection is also lower in the long run. Because the piercing does not penetrate the cheek completely, there is little to no chance of tooth or gum damage. Microdermals are like a &#x27;one hole&#x27; piercing, where the &#x27;foot&#x27; of the jewelry sits below the skin and the decorative jewel or flat disc is above the skin.

==Jewelry==
Cheek piercings are sometimes pierced with 1.6mm flat backed labret studs, but is mostly done with a regular barbell so the cheek tissues do not grow over the back of the jewelry. Also, so the wearer doesn&#x27;t accidentally break/crack the jewelry by means of unintentional biting. The flat back provides comfort and lessens the chance of the jewelry damaging the teeth and gums of the wearer. However it proves problematic during the healing process because the cheek will likely heal over the flat back if the bar&#x27;s length is too short. In this case, the piercer will have to cut the barbell out from the inside of the mouth. The cheek is pierced with a 22 - 24 mm labret/barbell during the procedure. This will accommodate for swelling. After the piercing is healed, shortened jewelry further reduces the chance of damage to the teeth from unintentional biting.

==History and culture==

Permanent cheek piercing appears to be of primarily contemporary origin. 

Ritual cheek piercings were and are common throughout the world in both primitive and modern cultures. Perhaps the most well known of these rituals is the annual vegetarian festivals in Phuket, Thailand where &quot;mediums&quot; (both lay people and monks) pierce their cheeks with an array of objects in varying sizes, while in an altered state.

<text>The Estádio do Dragão (; English: Dragon Stadium) is an all-seater football stadium in Porto, Portugal, and the home ground of FC Porto since 2003. It has a seating capacity of 50,033, making it the third largest football stadium in Portugal.

Designed by Portuguese architect Manuel Salgado, the stadium was constructed to replace Porto&#x27;s former ground, the Estádio das Antas, along with becoming one of the host venues for the UEFA Euro 2004 final tournament. The inauguration took place on 16 November 2003 with a friendly match against Barcelona, setting an attendance record of 52,000 spectators.

A UEFA category four stadium, it has held several international club and national team competition matches, including the 2019 UEFA Nations League Final and 2021 UEFA Champions League Final.

The stadium is one of the potential venues for the 2030 FIFA World Cup which Portugal will co-host along with Morocco and Spain.

==Construction and inauguration==
Construction works began in late 2001, and were completed in November 2003, some months after what was expected, since in February 2002, Porto mayor Rui Rio changed the estate distribution, criticizing the plan for including high-scale housing and shopping for the area. These actions forced the chairman of FC Porto, Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa, to halt all building operations, which were only resumed after a consensus was reached.

Designed by Portuguese architect Manuel Salgado and built by Portuguese contractor Somague, it cost €97,755,318, of which €18,430,956 was subsidized by the government. To help underwrite costs, each stand carries one or two sponsor names: Super Bock (south), tmn (east), meo (west), and Coca-Cola (north stand). Away fans are placed in the right corner of the upper tier of the east stand, while home Ultra groups, Super Dragões and Colectivo Ultras 95, occupy the south stand and the north stand, respectively, like on the old stadium.

The stadium was inaugurated on November 16, 2003, with a match against FC Barcelona, which featured the debut of a 16-year-old Lionel Messi in the Spanish side. Porto won 2–0 with goals by Derlei and Hugo Almeida. Due to severe turf problems, however, Porto was forced to return and play in the old &quot;Estádio das Antas&quot;, until the turf was replanted by mid-February 2004.

The stadium is characterized by a frame of 21 000 m2 of azulejos.

==Naming==
Prior to the inauguration, the stadium&#x27;s name was debated internally between elements of Porto&#x27;s administration, with various alternatives in consideration, such as retaining the old name, Estádio das Antas (officially, unlike the former stadium), or name it after some of the club&#x27;s biggest historical figures like former player Artur de Sousa Pinga, manager José Maria Pedroto or president Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa, the latter being, the one with most gathered consensus but ended dismissed by the president himself. After a deliberation period, the name Estádio do Dragão was revealed to the general public.

==International matches==
===Portugal national team matches===
The following national team matches were held in the stadium.

===UEFA Euro 2004===
Constructed to become one of the venues of the UEFA Euro 2004 tournament, it staged the inaugural match between hosts Portugal and eventual winners Greece, as well as three group stage, one quarterfinal, and one semifinal fixtures.

===2019 UEFA Nations League Finals===
One of the venues of the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals.

===2021 UEFA Champions League Final===

The final originally planned at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, but was moved due to travel restrictions by England government caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, the final hosts were shifted back a two-year, with Istanbul instead hosting the 2023 final. Chelsea FC won the match 1–0 against Manchester City, with Kai Havertz scoring the only goal.

==Other uses==

A major source of income granted by the infrastructure is the planned capability to monetize on organizing events outside of regular football matches. Those extend from business meetings, congresses, summits, festivals, expos and other sports competitions. For example, the ROC committee picked the stadium to host the 2009 Race of Champions South Europe Regional Final, therefore, the grass pitch was converted into an asphalt course in order to accommodate the race. The 2019 ESSMA Summit is also noteworthy by having joined several clubs, leagues and federations representatives together at the venue to discuss matters on the developments and trends of the football industry.

In addition, through different music promoters and specialized event management companies, the stadium already served as a concert venue to four international tour schedules from recognized musical artists along with selected opening acts.

==Access and transportation==

Access by vehicle is possible through the VCI (&quot;Via de Cintura Interna&quot;), a roadway that passes right next to the stadium, granting a direct connection. In the event of coming from the city center, driving down the main Alameda da Antas is another viable route towards the destination. In spite of this, the recommendation is the use of the public transports, which results in a better flux of public movement around the perimeter. Having its own station combined with the infrastructure, the metro functions as the main way of reaching the stadium, with different lines linking the various city areas and a direct connection to the international Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport. Alternatively, the STCP bus service also grants routes for the purpose and there are 150 bicycle parking spots available.

<text>A facial is a family of skin care treatments for the face, including steam, exfoliation (physical and chemical), extraction, creams, lotions, facial masks, peels, and massage. They are normally performed in beauty salons, but are also a common spa treatment. They are used for general skin health as well as for specific skin conditions. Types of facials include European facial, LED light therapy facials, hydrafacials and mini-facials.

== Facial mask ==
There are different kinds of masks (e.g., clay, cactus, cucumber) for different purposes: deep-cleansing, by penetrating the pores; healing acne scars or hyper-pigmentation; brightening, for a gradual illumination of the skin tone. Facial masks also help with anti-aging, acne, crows feet, under eye bags, sagging lids, dark circles, puffiness, and more. Some masks are designed to dry or solidify on the face, almost like plaster; others just remain wet. The green face mask is very essential and benefited. 

Masks are removed by either rinsing the face with water, wiping off with a damp cloth, or peeling off of the face. Duration for wearing a mask varies with the type of mask, and manufacturer&#x27;s usage instructions. The time can range from a few minutes to overnight. Those with sensitive skin are advised to first test out the mask on a small portion of the skin, in order to check for any irritations. Some facial masks are not suited to frequent use. A glycolic mask should not be used more frequently than once a month to avoid the risk of burning the skin.

Masks can be found anywhere from drugstores to department stores and can vary in consistency and form. Setting masks include: clay, which is a thicker consistency, and will draw out impurities (and sometimes, natural oils, too) from the pores; a cream, which stays damp to hydrate the skin; sheet-style, in which a paper mask is dampened with liquid to tone and moisturize the skin; and lastly, a hybrid/clay and cream form that includes small beads for removing dead surface skin cells. Non-setting facial masks include warm oil and paraffin wax masks. These different forms are made to suit different skin types (e.g., oily or dry), and different skincare goals or needs (e.g., moisturizing, cleansing, exfoliating). Clay and mud masks suit oily and some &quot;combination&quot; skin types, while cream-based masks tend to suit dry and sensitive skin types. There are also peel-off masks which are used to remove thin layers of dead skin cells and dirt.

<doc id="439103" wikidata="Q7577341" url="?curid=439103" title="Spilt Milk (Jellyfish album)">
<text>Spilt Milk is the second and final studio album by American rock band Jellyfish, released on February 9, 1993, by Charisma Records. It features a harsher and more ornate sound than their previous, &quot;Bellybutton&quot; (1990). As with &quot;Bellybutton&quot;, &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; was written and co-produced by founding members Andy Sturmer and Roger Manning. Albhy Galuten and Jack Joseph Puig also returned as producers.

Named for the hard work and turmoil surrounding its making, &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; was recorded after the departure of bassist Chris Manning (who was replaced by Tim Smith) and lead guitarist Jason Falkner. Guitar duties were instead handled by session musicians Jon Brion and Lyle Workman. Production lasted several months due to the record&#x27;s complicated orchestrations, and ultimately ran over-budget.

The album was supported with a yearlong tour that introduced guitarist Eric Dover into the band&#x27;s line-up. &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; performed below commercial expectations, peaking at number 164 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 21 on the UK Albums Chart. Singles &quot;The Ghost at Number One&quot; and &quot;New Mistake&quot; charted at numbers 43 and 55 in the UK, respectively. An expanded deluxe edition of the album was released by Omnivore Recordings in 2015.

==Background==

During the yearlong promotional tour for the band&#x27;s debut &quot;Bellybutton&quot;, tensions arose amongst the band members. The band&#x27;s bassist Chris Manning left the group at the end of the tour to pursue a quieter life as a producer. The band&#x27;s lead guitarist Jason Falkner had grown increasingly frustrated with having his songwriting contributions ignored by Andy Sturmer and Roger Manning. He left the group after the tour. In regards to his departure, Falkner recalled being diagnosed with an ulcer due to his deteriorating relationship with Sturmer.

After the tour, Manning and Sturmer collaborated with Ringo Starr for his 1992 solo album &quot;Time Takes Time&quot;. They were then invited to work with Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. Wilson and Jellyfish only had one songwriting session that was unproductive. Manning described the experience as &quot;utterly surreal&quot;. After their sessions with Starr and Wilson, the band was dedicated to making their next album &quot;their masterpiece&quot;.

==Production==
The songs were written in Cotati, CA between October 1991 and March 1992. Manning would go over to Sturmer&#x27;s home to work on the album for eight hours a day, six days a week. Production lasted from April to September 1992; recording sessions used massed choirs, strings, brass, flutes, wind chimes, harpsichords and other instruments. The album was produced by the same producers as their debut, Albhy Galuten (of Bee Gees fame) and Jack Joseph Puig alongside Manning and Sturmer themselves. Also featured on the album were guitarists Tom &quot;T-Bone&quot; Wolk, Lyle Workman, and Jon Brion (who soon formed the Grays with Falkner). Friend Andy Zax wrote of an anecdote in which he met Manning for a late-night meal at a delicatessen, only for Manning to excuse himself &quot;back to the studio because everyone was still there working. It was 3AM.&quot; Sturmer remembered: &quot;Once I literally passed out doing a vocal and woke up in the next room. Making this record was like that Army commercial: &#x27;The toughest job you&#x27;ll ever love.&#x27;&quot;

In reference to the band&#x27;s influences on &quot;Spilt Milk&quot;, Sturmer denied that they were &quot;over-the-top, like we have somehow created &quot;A Night at the Opera Part 2&quot; or something, or &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.&quot; Referencing comparisons to the Beach Boys on &quot;The Ghost at Number One&quot;, Manning stated: &quot;The Beach Boys would never have done it that way, with really hard verses surrounding it and a banjo at the end of the song. We really take pride in exploring the arrangements. Our strength is in incorporating a lot of different things and twisting them in a way that they haven&#x27;t been twisted before. Music critic Jon Pareles offered that the band distinguished itself from their influences by adding &quot;a fondness for excess: more sudden shifts, pushier drums and guitars, more bursts of vocal harmony. ... The idea is to cram the music with ideas, turning each song into a Rube Goldberg contraption of pop, daring to incorporate the information overload that pop used to hold at bay.&quot;

The title was chosen in reference to the record going over-budget and behind schedule and the group turmoil that followed &quot;Bellybutton&quot;. The cover was designed by Charisma&#x27;s staff creative director Mick Haggerty, known for also designing the cover of Supertramp&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast in America&quot; and Hall and Oates&#x27; &quot;H2O&quot;. He later commented in an interview: &quot;I can’t remember where the little girl came in, but I do remember the casting call from hell. It’s very uncomfortable to put out a call requesting lots of young girls in ballet tights and tiaras, knowing full well you’re going to chose the saddest and most pathetic one you can find. ... I shot the studio interior first, then the little girl. We tried everything to make her cry, but in the end, used glycerin for her tears, although I know mine were real. The hand pulling back the curtain was to hint at the &#x27;Greatest Show On Earth meets Sgt. Pepper&#x27; mood that prevailed in the studio.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Spilt Milk&quot; was released on February 9, 1993, on Charisma Records and later peaked at No. 164 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Its poor sales were attributed to being released during the height of the popularity of grunge. The album also made an appearance on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, peaking at No. 8. Internationally, the album peaked at No. 21 on the UK Official Albums Chart and No. 100 on the Japan Oricon charts.

The band embarked on a year-long tour in promotion of the album which included a new line up (Tim Smith on bass and Eric Dover on guitar). Two singles were also issued in support of the album. These were &quot;The Ghost at Number One&quot; (which reached No. 9 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and No. 43 on the UK Official Singles Chart) and &quot;New Mistake&quot; (which reached No. 55 on the UK Official Singles Chart).

==Critical reception==

===Contemporary===
In his review for &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;, Justin Mitchell called &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; a &quot;lavishly produced album that begs comparisons to the best of Queen, Supertramp, Squeeze and Paul McCartney, remixed through Jellyfish&#x27;s &#x27;90s sensibilities.&quot; He wrote that &quot;what pulls the whole CD together is an unerring sense of superb melodies, harmonies and a lush wall of instruments ranging from basic guitars, bass and drums to the occasional banjo or woodwind section flying through the mix. ... symphonic but never pretentious, sweet but not cloying and crafted throughout with a sly, lyrical sense of humor.&quot; Jon Pareles, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said that the band &quot;proudly join[ed] pop&#x27;s lineage of tuneful tricksters.&quot; &quot;OffBeat&quot;″s Pete Fight wrote that the production was &quot;superb, full of clever flourishes and turnarounds&quot; and that &quot;the songs themselves are great, full of memorable melodies, hooks and lyrics&quot;. Although he believed the album was less immediately accessible than &quot;Bellybutton&quot;, &quot;the more complex arrangements hold promise for future endeavors.&quot;

Bruce Bitt of the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; described &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; as being &quot;as compelling a homage to the Beatles and the Beach Boys as there is&quot;, but one that is &quot;so heavy on production sleight-of-hand that the melodies sometimes collapse beneath the weight of the sound.&quot; Though he criticized the album for being &quot;frustratingly derivative&quot;, he praised its &quot;sprawling production and loving performances&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot;″s Eric Weisbard said that &quot;by pretending to emulate the past, Jellyfish obliterates it. ... When events of not-so-great importance occur twice, the first time it&#x27;s a farce, the second time it&#x27;s a dull tragedy.&quot;

David Barton of &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; wrote that the album &quot;stoops beneath the Beatles to borrow from Supertramp and Queen at its most bombastic, which may be fascinating listening at first, but quickly grows irritating.&quot; He also criticized the lackluster songs and the band for failing to define their own &quot;style and personality&quot;. Mark Caro of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; praised the album&#x27;s instrumentation, production, and Manning and Sturmer&#x27;s songwriting, but asked, &quot;Is it possible for &quot;The Ghost at Number One&quot; to cram in just a few more Beach Boys/&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; touches? Is there really a song here called &quot;Too Much, Too Little, Too Late&quot;?&quot; He concluded that &quot;Pop&#x27;s greatest groups have been about more than just craftsmanship, and they didn&#x27;t require the listener to expend so much energy discerning between the homage and the fromage.&quot;

===Retrospective===
Writing in &quot;Far Out&quot; magazine in 2015, Tony Curran wrote that &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; had improved with age and said it was a &quot;wonderfully unpretentious homage to pop music in its essential form: catchiness and melody are the keynotes here. From the soaring &#x27;Joining A Fan Club&#x27; ... to the psychedelic pop doodlings of &#x27;Sebrina, Paste and Plato&#x27; the band explore a range of possibilities within the pop format—and well beyond.&quot; Jon Meyers of &quot;The Vinyl District&quot; said the album was &quot;sharper and far more vibrant than its predecessor, with clever hooks galore.&quot; Reviewing the album&#x27;s 2015 remaster, Alan Sculley of &quot;Florida Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Spilt Milk&quot; was an excellent follow-up to the debut, rocking a bit harder without losing any hookiness.&quot; Also reviewing the remaster, John Borack of &quot;Goldmine&quot; opined that &quot;Jellyfish [took] a great leap forward in songwriting, arranging and sonic sheen.&quot;

AllMusic&#x27;s Mark Deming gave &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; a positive review, describing it as &quot;conceived and executed on a grand scale&quot;. He noted that &quot;Sturmer and Manning sound like joyous kids left in a toy shop and making splendid use of every plaything at their disposal.&quot; While Deming criticized the production for being &quot;too big for its own good&quot;, he concluded that the album was a &quot;a massive balancing act that Jellyfish miraculously pull off; it might seem like a power pop Spruce Goose, but in this case it not only takes off, it flies high as a remarkable experiment in pop-minded rock on the grandest scale.&quot;

In 2011, the album was included in a listicle by &quot;PopMatters&quot; of &quot;The Best Music for Summer&quot;. It also appeared in a similar 2015 list by &quot;Newsweek&quot; of the &quot;best summer albums (released between 1985 and 1997)&quot;. Contributor Zach Schonfeld decreed that &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; was a &quot;lost power-pop masterwork&quot; containing &quot;12 unfashionably sunny and remarkably well-built pop gems about fan clubs, kindergarten classrooms and—in one less-than-subtle instance—the singer&#x27;s penis. It&#x27;s the colorfulness of it all that makes it such a great summer record.&quot; McFly took influence from &quot;Spilt Milk&quot; when recording their third album &quot;Motion in the Ocean&quot; (2006), having been introduced to it by Matt Willis of Busted. Tom Fletcher of McFly described Jellyfish&#x27;s album as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;.

<doc id="439104" wikidata="Q745257" url="?curid=439104" title="Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador">
<text>Gander is a town located in the northeastern part of the island of Newfoundland in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador, approximately south of Gander Bay, south of Twillingate and east of Grand Falls-Windsor. Located on the northeastern shore of Gander Lake, it is the site of Gander International Airport, once an important refuelling stop for transatlantic aircraft. The airport is still a preferred emergency landing point for aircraft facing on-board medical or security issues.

When the U.S. closed its airspace after the September 11 attacks, Gander International Airport took in 38 commercial aircraft and four military aircraft, and accommodated nearly 6,700 evacuees from Olympic Airways, Air France, Lufthansa, British Airways, Alitalia and more.
Most of the streets in Gander are named after famous aviators, including Alcock and Brown, Amelia Earhart, Charles Lindbergh, Eddie Rickenbacker, Marc Garneau and Chuck Yeager.

==History==
Gander was chosen for the construction of an airport in 1935 because it is very close to the great circle route between New York and London. In 1936, construction of the base began, and the town started to develop. On 11 January 1938, Captain Douglas Fraser made the first landing at &quot;Newfoundland Airport,&quot; now known as Gander International Airport, or &quot;CYQX,&quot; in a single-engine biplane, Fox Moth VO-ADE.

During the Second World War, as many as 10,000 Canadian, British and American military personnel resided in Gander. The area became a strategic post for the Air Ferry Command of the Royal Air Force, with approximately 20,000 American- and Canadian-built fighters and bombers stopping at Gander en route to Europe. After the war, the airbase became a civilian airport, and the location of the town was moved a safe distance from the runways. Construction of the present town site began in the 1950s, and the present municipality was incorporated in 1958; the settlement around the airport was eventually abandoned.

After the Second World War, the town grew as the airport was used as a refuelling stop for transatlantic flights, earning its name &quot;Cross-roads of the world.&quot; Efforts were made to diversify the economy from being dependent on the airport, particularly as new aircraft designs permitted longer-range flights without the need for landing to refuel.

Gander was the site of a major aircraft accident, Arrow Air Flight 1285, on 12 December 1985; 256 people were killed in the disaster, probably caused by ice contamination on the wings, making it the deadliest air crash ever to happen in Canada.

=== Assistance following September 11 attacks ===

In 2001, Gander International Airport played an integral role in world aviation in the hours immediately following the September 11 attacks when all of North America&#x27;s airspace was closed by Transport Canada and the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). As part of Operation Yellow Ribbon, 38 civilian and 4 military flights bound for the United States were ordered to land at the airport—more flights than any Canadian airport other than Halifax International. More than 6,600 passengers and airline crew members—equivalent to 66% of the local population at the time—were forced to stay in the Gander area for up to six days until airspace was reopened. Gander received the third highest volume of passengers following Operation Yellow Ribbon, behind Vancouver International Airport, which received 8,500, and Halifax International. Residents of Gander and surrounding communities volunteered to house, feed, and entertain the travellers as part of Operation Yellow Ribbon. This was largely because Transport Canada and Nav Canada asked that transatlantic flights avoid diverting to major airports in central Canada, such as Toronto Pearson and Montréal-Dorval.

Lufthansa named one of its Airbus A340 (registration D-AIFC) aircraft &quot;Gander/Halifax&quot; to thank both cities for their handling of rerouted travellers on 11 September. A book, &quot;The Day the World Came to Town&quot;, included several stories about Gander&#x27;s role during that and subsequent days. A radio play, &quot;The Day the Planes Came&quot;, by Caroline and David Stafford, dealing with the effect on Gander of the 11 September passengers was first broadcast in June 2008 on BBC Radio 4 and was repeated in October 2009. A TV movie, &quot;Diverted&quot;, was made in 2009. In February 2010, NBC aired a report by Tom Brokaw covering Gander&#x27;s part in the grounding of hundreds of planes on 9/11 during coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. A musical by Irene Sankoff and David Hein, &quot;Come from Away&quot;, which retells the stories of passengers and Newfoundlanders in Gander after Operation Yellow Ribbon, was mounted on Broadway in 2017. The same year, &quot;Come from Away&quot; was nominated for seven Tony Awards and won the Tony for Best Direction of Musical. The town was also profiled in Moze Mossanen&#x27;s 2018 documentary film &quot;You Are Here&quot;. National Geographic Episode &quot;9/11: Control The Skies&quot; tells the story of the air traffic controllers, first broadcast on 11 September 2019.

The Town of Gander continues to pursue business opportunities in the aerospace industry.

==Geography==
Gander is located northwest of the provincial capital of St. John&#x27;s. Ordovician age shale, slate and greywacke form the underlying bedrock, which is covered by stony loam to silt loam podzolic or gleysolic soil.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, Gander had a population of 11,880 living in 5,068 of its 5,424 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 11,688. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

As of the 2021 census, the population of Gander was found to be 89.7% white with all visible minorities totalling 2.7% of the population and the Indigenous population totalling 7.5%.

==Climate==
Gander has a cool to cold humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;). It combines moderately warm and rainy summers with cold and very snowy winters. Due to the maritime influence from the Atlantic Ocean, seasonal changes are slightly less pronounced than in Canada&#x27;s interior, but still substantial given its near-coastal position. Its average frost-free period runs from June 1 to October 16–136 days.

== Services ==
===James Paton Memorial Health Centre===
Medical services are provided by the James Paton Memorial Health Centre, on the Trans-Canada Highway. The hospital opened in May 1964 and has undergone many changes since then, making it a prominent hospital in the central region. The hospital has a rated beds capacity of 92.
===Gander Public Library===
===Steele Community Centre===
The Steele Community Centre, previously named the Gander Community Centre, is a multi-purpose venue located on Airport Boulevard. The community centre, owned and operated by the Town of Gander, is used to host trade shows, conferences, sporting events and special events. It is home to the Gander Flyers of the Central West Senior Hockey League.

During Operation Yellow Ribbon, the people of Gander and surrounding communities donated large amounts of food and other supplies for the unexpected visitors. The Gander Community Centre became a giant &quot;walk-in fridge&quot; for the food donations.

== In popular culture ==
Gander airport features in the Nevil Shute novel &quot;No Highway&quot; and the film adaptation, called &quot;No Highway in the Sky&quot; in Anglophone countries other than the UK.

in 2006, the miniseries &quot;Above and Beyond&quot; deals with the Atlantic Ferry Organization, tasked with ferrying aircraft from North America to Europe in the early years of the Second World War. The production was filmed primarily at the Gander airport, and details the development of the airport as a ferry stop.

In 2013, &quot;Come from Away&quot;, a musical by Irene Sankoff and David Hein based on the events in Gander on and after 11 September was first performed at Sheridan College in Oakville, Ontario, following a workshop there the previous year. It became a co-production of the La Jolla Playhouse and the Seattle Repertory Theatre, and opened in San Diego on 29 May 2015. The show saw a production in Washington, D.C., at Ford&#x27;s Theatre, from September to October 2016, then, prior to opening in Toronto, staged a pair of shows in Gander. It opened at Toronto&#x27;s Royal Alexandra Theatre, running from November 2016 to January 2017, where it set a ticket sales record for the 109-year-old venue. It opened in New York on Broadway at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre on 12 March 2017, and is scheduled to return to the Royal Alex in Toronto on 13 February 2018. In the year 2017, at the 71st Tony Awards, the musical was nominated for seven Tony Awards, alongside other musical award nominations, ultimately winning one for Best Direction of a Musical by Christopher Ashley. The show has gone on to be played in various cities around North and South America and Europe for over a decade.

==Planetary nomenclature==
In 1991, the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (IAU/WGPSN) officially named a crater on Mars after Gander. Gander Crater lies at latitude 31.5° south, longitude 265.9° west; its diameter is .

<text>Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus (4 February 1776, Bremen – 16 February 1837, Bremen) was a German physician, naturalist, and proto-evolutionary biologist.

His younger brother, Ludolph Christian Treviranus (1779–1864), was also a naturalist and botanist, and also a notable taxonomist and zoologist.

==History==
Treviranus was born in Bremen and studied medicine at the University of Göttingen, where he took his doctor&#x27;s degree in 1796.

During the following year, he was appointed professor of medicine and mathematics at the Bremen lyceum. In 1816, he was elected a corresponding member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

===Works===
Treviranus was a proponent of the theory of the transmutation of species, a theory of evolution held by some biologists prior to the work of Charles Darwin. He put forward this belief in the first volume of his &quot;Biologie; oder die Philosophie der lebenden Natur&quot;, published in 1802, the same year similar opinions were expressed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.

In the 1830s, he was the first to identify rod photoreceptor cells in the retina using a microscope.

<doc id="439117" wikidata="Q150961" url="?curid=439117" title="Arena AufSchalke">
<text>Arena AufSchalke (), currently known as Veltins-Arena () for sponsorship reasons, is a retractable roof and pitch, football stadium in Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It opened on 13 August 2001, as the new home ground for FC Schalke 04. The stadium has a capacity of 62,271 (standing and seated) for league matches and 54,740 (seated only) for international matches. It hosted four matches at UEFA Euro 2024. The naming rights to the stadium were sold in July 2005 to the German brewery Veltins.

In the late 1990s, plans emerged to construct a new stadium for Schalke 04 to replace the outdated Parkstadion. Following Schalke 04&#x27;s 1996–97 UEFA Cup victory and anticipating the club&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 2004, a contract to build the new stadium was awarded to the German construction firm HBM in 1998. The Veltins-Arena is located near the old Parkstadion on a club-owned property known as &quot;Berger Feld.&quot; Due to the presence of two mine shafts beneath the site, the stadium&#x27;s main axis was rotated to ensure structural integrity. The arena features a two-tier layout with a foundation of cast concrete and packed slag from steel smelting.

The Veltins-Arena features a Teflon-coated fiberglass canvas retractable roof that spans the entire venue and is supported by a rectangular truss and 24 steel pylons. The pitch can slide out of the stadium, allowing for optimal grass growth and versatility for various events. The stadium also features a centrally suspended scoreboard, a first in football stadiums. The extensive catering facilities include 15 small restaurants, 50 grilling stations, and 35 cafés, all supplied by a 5km beer-line capable of dispensing 52,000 liters of beer per match day.

The arena has hosted significant events, including the 2004 UEFA Champions League final, five matches at the 2006 FIFA World Cup including a quarter-final, and the 2010 Ice Hockey World Championship. It has been a venue for concerts and other sports events such as the German Speedway Grand Prix and the 2018 German Darts Masters. The Veltins-Arena has inspired other stadiums, including State Farm Stadium and Friends Arena, due to its innovative features like the retractable roof and slide-out pitch. The arena has hosted concerts by major artists and bands, including The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, Metallica, AC/DC, Taylor Swift and Rammstein.

==History==

Plans to construct a new stadium emerged in the late 1990s, as fans and managers sought to move out of the outdated Parkstadion, and create a modern multifunctional arena. Following Schalke 04&#x27;s 1997 victory in the UEFA Cup and the club&#x27;s upcoming 100th anniversary in 2004, the contract to construct a stadium was given in 1998 to the German construction firm HBM.

==Site and layout==
The site chosen for Schalke 04&#x27;s new stadium is in the direct vicinity of the old Parkstadion, on an extensive piece of club owned property known as the &quot;Berger Feld&quot;. Unfortunately, two mine shafts of the &quot;Consolidation&quot; and &quot;Hugo&quot; coal-mines run directly beneath this field at a depth of 800 m. These shafts (in use until 2000) would have caused unwanted shifts and tensions that could have compromised the structural integrity of the stadium. To avoid this, the main axis was rotated from the classic north–south arrangement to a northeast–southwest alignment, making the arena parallel to the mines.

The Veltins-Arena was created as a multi-functional arena of two tiers that completely surround the playing field. These allow for a league capacity of 62,271 spectators (standing and seated) and an international capacity of 54,740. For league matches, the North stand is left as standing rows (capacity: 16,307) to accommodate the Schalke 04 fans, while for international matches, these are converted to seats (capacity: 8,600). The 72 VIP lounges form a ring around the entire stadium, separating the first tier from the second tier. On the main Western grandstand, the VIP capacity is increased by a second level of lounges directly beneath the main belt.

The foundation for the stadium was created out of cast concrete and of packed slag, a waste product from the steel smelting industry. These were packed into mounds to support the four main stands, which were made out of pre-fabricated, reinforced concrete sections. Leading into the four corners of the arena are tunnels, which serve both as access for construction and assembly, and as ventilation for the interior.

==Roof and pitch==

The Veltins-Arena features a Teflon-coated fiberglass canvas retractable roof, which spans the entire stadium. The roof is supported by a rectangular truss that is suspended above the field, which is in turn connected to the main building via 24 steel pylons. The center of the roof can be opened into two halves, allowing for an opened or covered stadium, depending on weather and event. To reduce the exterior noise of up to 105 decibels during concerts, a second layer of Teflon-coated fiberglass canvas was added over the first, creating a dampening air cushion. Hanging over the center of the pitch are four video screens, each with a surface area of . The centrally suspended scoreboard, similar to those found inside indoor sports arenas, was the first of its kind in football stadium, and has since been copied in the Deutsche Bank Park in Frankfurt and the Merkur Spiel-Arena in Düsseldorf.
Like the Sapporo Dome in Japan, the State Farm Stadium and Allegiant Stadium in the U.S. and the GelreDome in the Netherlands, the Veltins-Arena features a slide-out pitch. Supported by a substructure, the playing field can be moved in and out of the stadium within four hours. This has several advantages:

*The grass playing surface can grow under normal outside conditions without suffering from a lack of circulation and light as in other arenas.
*The football pitch is not damaged during indoor events such as concerts.
*The floor of the multi-functional hall can be converted and retro-fitted within a short amount of time.
*The outside area that is not occupied by the field can be used as parking facilities for buses during football matches.

==Catering and venues==

To provide for over 60,000 spectators, the Veltins-Arena is equipped with an abundance of catering facilities. With 15 small restaurants, 50 grilling stations and 35 cafés, the stadium can serve up to of sausages, 7,000 pretzels, and of pizza in one day. These catering areas are connected to a long beer-line, supplying them with roughly of beer per match day.

==Other events==

The Veltins-Arena has hosted major events in football and other sports. Among them was the 2004 UEFA Champions League final between AS Monaco and Porto, which drew over 53,000 spectators. During the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League, the stadium served as the temporary home of Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk due to the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War. During the renovation of Rheinstadion in Düsseldorf, the Arena served as the temporary home of the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe, an American football league. World Bowl XII was hosted by the stadium. In May 2004, the Veltins-Arena hosted a pop concert, a Bundesliga match and an NFL Europe game all within 96 hours. Other events have included the biathlon World Team Challenge exhibition race, stock car races and operas. In June 2009, it was the scene of a world heavyweight championship boxing match between Wladimir Klitschko and Ruslan Chagaev, which drew an audience of 60,000. The Veltins-Arena was among several venues to bid for a UEFA Europa League final or a UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League final for either 2026 or 2027.

===2006 FIFA World Cup===

The stadium was one of the venues for the 2006 World Cup. However, because FIFA controls all sponsorship associated with its tournaments (including that of competition venues), the arena was called &quot;FIFA World Cup Stadium Gelsenkirchen&quot; (; ) during the World Cup. Wayne Rooney was sent off for England in the quarterfinal game against Portugal.

The following games were played at the stadium during the 2006 World Cup:


=== Speedway ===
2007 Speedway Grand Prix of Germany
The Veltins-Arena hosted the final Grand Prix of the 2007 motorcycle speedway World Championship season on 13 October 2007, the &quot;2007 Speedway Grand Prix of Germany&quot;, the 100th Grand Prix in the history of the competition. It was billed as &quot;The richest minute in motorsport&quot;. The winner of the event won US by virtue of winning the final heat of the event, with each heat taking about one minute to complete. 25,000 fans saw the Grand Prix won by Swedish rider Andreas Jonsson, who beat American Greg Hancock, and Australians, Jason Crump and Leigh Adams in the final. Nicki Pedersen who went out of the competition at the semi-final stage was crowned World Champion.

The temporary speedway track at the Veltins-Arena was in length. Andreas Jonsson and Greg Hancock jointly hold the four-lap record, having set a time of 56.9 seconds in heats 21 and 23 respectively.

2008 Speedway Grand Prix of Germany
The Veltins-Arena was supposed to host the &quot;2008 Speedway Grand Prix of Germany&quot;. It was scheduled to take place on 11 October 2008. However, the meeting was cancelled because the track (temporary) was deemed unsafe by the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) jury due to adverse weather conditions (even though the retractable roof was closed for the duration of laying the track). The event was re-staged at the Polonia Stadium, Bydgoszcz, Poland, on 18 October and was renamed the 2008 FIM Final Speedway Grand Prix.

===2010 Ice Hockey World Championship===
The opening game of the 74th IIHF World Championship took place at Veltins-Arena on 7 May 2010. At this occasion the crowd of 77,803 set a then World Record for ice hockey attendance. The host team Germany beat the United States 2–1 in overtime.

===2018 German Darts Masters===
The stadium hosted the 2018 German Darts Masters. The event achieved a record-breaking attendance of 20,210, the most ever at a darts event. The event was won by Mensur Suljović.

===UEFA Euro 2024===
The stadium was one of the venues for the UEFA Euro 2024. However, due to sponsorship contracts, the arena used its non-sponsored name during the tournament.

The following matches were played at the stadium:
==Inspiration of other stadiums==

The Veltins-Arena served as a model for State Farm Stadium, which shares features with its German counterpart, such as a retractable roof and slide-out pitch. Veltins-Arena has been a source of inspiration for Friends Arena. The arena also has ties to Lucas Oil Stadium. In that stadium, the retractable-roof also opens lengthwise from the center to the touchlines.

<doc id="439125" wikidata="Q865593" url="?curid=439125" title="Birching">
<text>Birching is a form of corporal punishment with a birch rod, typically used to strike the recipient&#x27;s bare buttocks, although occasionally the back and/or shoulders.

==Implement==
A birch rod (often shortened to &quot;birch&quot;) is a bundle of leafless twigs bound together to form an implement for administering corporal punishment.

Contrary to what the name suggests, a birch rod is not a single rod and is not necessarily made from birch twigs, but can also be made from various other strong and smooth branches of trees or shrubs, such as willow. A &quot;hazel rod&quot; is particularly painful; a bundle of four or five hazel twigs was used in the 1960s and 1970s on the Isle of Man, the last jurisdiction in Europe to use birching as a judicial penalty.

Another factor in the severity of a birch rod is its size—i.e. its length, weight and number of branches. In some penal institutions, several versions were in use, which were often given names. For example, in Dartmoor Prison the device used to punish male offenders above the age of 16—weighing some , and long—was known as the &quot;senior birch&quot;. 

In the 1860s, the Royal Navy abandoned the use of the cat o&#x27; nine tails on boy seamen. The cat had acquired a nasty reputation because of its use in prisons, and was replaced by the birch, with which the wealthy classes were more familiar, having been chastised with it during their schooling. Around the same time, the civilian courts system followed the Navy&#x27;s example and switched to birches for the judicial corporal punishment of boys and young men, where previously a whip or cat had been used. In an attempt to standardise the Navy&#x27;s birches, the Admiralty had specimens called &quot;patterned birch&quot; (as well as a &quot;patterned cane&quot;), kept in every major dockyard, as birches had to be procured on land in quantities.

The term judicial birch generally refers to the severe type in use for court-ordered birchings, especially the Manx hazel birch. A 1951 memorandum (possibly confirming earlier practice) ordered all UK male prisons to use birches (and cats-o&#x27;-nine-tails) from only a national stock at South London&#x27;s Wandsworth prison, where they were to be &#x27;thoroughly&#x27; tested before being supplied in triplicate to a prison whenever required for use as prison discipline.

By contrast, terms like &quot;Eton birch&quot; are used for a school birch made from smaller birch tree twigs.

==Position==
Only if the recipient was a small child could he or she practicably be punished over the knee of the applicant. Otherwise the child would be bent over an object such as a chair. For judicial punishments the recipient could even be tied down if likely to move about too much or attempt to escape.

In some prisons and reformatories, a wooden apparatus known as birching donkey or birching pony was specially constructed for birchings. As there were no detailed rules, prisons and police stations devised, adapted and used many different contraptions under various names that juvenile and adult offenders were bent over for punishment. Some models also allowed a standing or leaning position for other implements.

A simple alternative position known from school discipline is horsing, where the person to be punished is held by the arms over the back of another person (e.g. a classmate), or on the shoulders of two or more colleagues. However, at Eton College and schools of similar standing, the recipient was made to kneel on a special wooden block.

Another device used to immobilise offenders was a birching table, used in Scotland, with two holes in it through which the offender&#x27;s arms were inserted but otherwise left free and untied. The offender&#x27;s feet were tied into position and a strap fastened immediately above the waist.

Whatever position is adopted, care must be taken not to strike the back of the genitals (e.g. by having the recipient&#x27;s legs kept together).

==History==


It was the most common school and judicial punishment in Europe up to the mid-19th century, when caning gained increasing popularity. According to some accounts, even the legendary sting of the cat o&#x27; nine tails was less feared than the birch in certain prisons. The birch was always applied to the bare buttocks (as also on the Continent), a humiliation usually befalling boys (like the boy&#x27;s cat, likewise on the naked posterior), the &#x27;adult&#x27; cat to the back or shoulders of adults; although in the 20th century, judges increasingly ordered the birch rather than the cat, even for robbery with violence (the only offence for which adult judicial corporal punishment was ordered in the latter decades of its use in mainland Britain).

Birching was also featured in the French Revolution. One leader of the revolution, Anne-Josèphe Théroigne de Méricourt, went mad, ending her days in an asylum after a public birching. On 31 May 1793 the Jacobin women seized her, stripped her naked, and flogged her on the bare bottom in the public garden of the Tuileries.
Judicial birching in 20th-century Britain was used much more often as a fairly minor punishment for male juveniles, typically for petty larceny, rather than as a serious penalty for adult men. This was applied to boys aged up to 14 in England and Wales, and up to 16 in Scotland. In this juvenile version, the birch was much lighter and smaller, and the birch was administered privately by a policeman, usually immediately after the magistrate&#x27;s court hearing, either in a room in the court building or at the nearest police station.

In Lewis Carroll&#x27;s early poem &quot;The Two Brothers&quot;, 1853, one laments: &quot;Oh would I were back at Twyford School, Learning lessons in fear of the birch!&quot; as his sadistic brother uses him as fish bait.

Today birching is rarely used as a judicial punishment, and it has also almost completely died out as a punishment for children.

In the United Kingdom, birching as a judicial penalty, in both its juvenile and adult versions, was abolished in 1948, but it was retained until 1962 as a punishment for violent breaches of prison discipline. The punishment of Birching and cat o&#x27; nine tails continued to be used in Northern Ireland into the 1940s.

The Isle of Man caused a good deal of controversy by continuing to birch young offenders until 1976. The birch was also used on offending teenage boys until the mid-1960s on the Channel Islands of Guernsey and Jersey.

In Trinidad and Tobago, the Corporal Punishment Act 1953 allows the High Court to order males, in addition to another punishment (often concurrent with a prison term), to undergo corporal punishment in the form of either a &#x27;flogging&#x27; with a knotted cat o&#x27; nine tails (made of cords, as in the Royal Navy tradition) or a &#x27;whipping&#x27; with a &#x27;rod&#x27; [i.e. switch] of tamarind, birch or other switches, and it allows the President to approve other instruments; in 2000, the minimum age was raised from 16 to 18, the legal threshold of adulthood. It may now be the only country in the world still officially using the birch.

==Non-punitive uses==
In Scandinavia, the Baltics, Russia and Finland there is a tradition called sauna whisking, in which one strikes their own body with soaked birch twigs in the sauna or banya, as a form of massage and to increase blood circulation and open the pores. The twigs are chosen carefully and do not have their leaves removed, and are often softened by keeping them in hot water prior to use. Being struck by the twigs induces a pleasant stinging sensation and very little actual pain.

<text>The spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) is a small chorus frog widespread throughout the eastern United States and Canada. It prefers permanent ponds due to its advantage in avoiding predation; however, it is very adaptable with respect to the habitat it can live in. In northern regions, the frog is able to endure below freezing temperatures due to the capacity of its liver to exude and flush the bloodstream with a glucose cryoprotectant which acts both as an anti-freeze in its blood, and allows organs like the heart to enter into a state of protected dormancy. The peeper earned its name from its chirping call, which marks the beginning of spring. &quot;Crucifer&quot; is derived from the Latin root meaning &quot;cross-bearing&quot;, a reference to the cross-like pattern on the spring peeper&#x27;s dorsal side.

These chirping calls are significant for communication in mating as females choose their mates based on the frequency and volume associated with them. Satellite males who do not make any calls also strategically place themselves near those that make louder calls in an attempt to intercept females.

Temperature plays a large role in when the spring peeper begins breeding as well as the duration of mating. Warm spells result in a massive increased calling rate.

== Description ==
The spring peeper is a tan or brown frog with a dark cross on its dorsa (thus the Latin name &quot;crucifer&quot;, meaning cross-bearer), though sometimes the marking may be indistinct. Dark lines can also be found between the eyes and in a crossband on the hindlimbs of &quot;P. crucifer&quot;. It has a body length between less than to and a mass between .

Unlike some other &quot;Pseudacris&quot; species, &quot;P. crucifer&quot; does not have white lines on its lips, but its lips may be lighter than its head.

== Anatomy and physiology ==
The species has large toe pads for climbing, although it is more at home amid the loose debris of the forest floor. Because of its toepads, the spring peeper was once thought to be more closely related to treefrogs than chorus frogs and was placed in the genus &quot;Hyla&quot;, but it is now in the genus &quot;Pseudacris&quot;.

The color variations of &quot;P. crucifer&quot; are mostly tan, brown, yellow, pink, olive green, and gray. All have a slightly pale yellow coloration on the inside of the thighs. Females are lighter-colored, while males are slightly smaller and usually have dark throats. Females have a bulkier abdomen. Skin color of Spring Peepers is also affected by temperature and light. Coloration is dynamic and adaptable in this species. It can be altered quickly, in 15 to 45 minutes, in order to better camouflage from predators.

This frog has a vocal sac that expands and deflates like a balloon to create a short and distinct peeping sound. Only males can make this loud high-pitched noise, and they use it to attract mates.
In the female spring peeper, protruding beyond the lower jaw of the frog sits its snout. Through the use of adhesive pads located on the tips of their non-webbed fingers, spring peepers can stick to particular materials. Males and females are differentiated from one another through the darkening of the skin beneath the jaw in males. Males have a body length ranging from , and females have a body length ranging from .

=== Glands and toxins ===
In &quot;Hyla crucifer&quot; males, the blackened pigmentation of the testis affects the seminiferous tubules, the underside of the peritoneum, and the organ itself. The tubules of the testis are surrounded by a pigment layer and a layer of flattened epithelial cells which are located within the surrounding connective tissue. The thickness of an average testis is about 1.10 mm and 2.5 mm in length. The spermatogonia are a cluster of masses jutting out from the tubule lumen. In the late fall, the spermatozoa, located in the seminiferous tubules of the spring peeper, mature and remain there until the spring for breeding. After the seminiferous tubules are emptied, during mating season, the pigmentation of the testis changes from black to a dull grey.

In the spring peeper, most of its energy is used during courtship. Higher energetic costs in female spring peepers are associated with gametogenesis, which occurs before breeding. Stored reserves of fat and glycogen contents can be measured early in the reproductive process to determine the amount used in spring peepers and their correlation to body size. Nonpolar lipid and glycogen content in male spring peepers increased with body mass, whereas in females, it decreased or had minimal variation. The fiber triglyceride and glycogen contents of the female spring peeper&#x27;s liver increased significantly slower than in males as body mass increased. At the beginning of the breeding season, male spring peepers have more significant amounts of bodily lipid content. Therefore, those that are larger are experiencing lower efficiencies in calling. More reserves of glycogen and lipids are required to maintain calling during the season and require additional rationing of reserves to prepare themselves for courtship. In females, there is a positive correlation between their snout length and wet ovary mass, which also correlates to an increase in body size.

=== Respiratory and circulatory system ===
The bigger, older, and more fit male spring peepers are typically superior callers. These types of males utilize citrate synthase and β-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase in their muscles at greater levels. Males with higher calling rates also tend to inhibit larger ventricles and greater concentrations of blood hemoglobin; both the large ventricle size and blood hemoglobin concentrations play a significant role in the speed of oxygen consumption, which is intensely linked to the calling rate. When a male spring peeper calls, the sound is made by the contraction of external and internal oblique muscles which subsequently force air out of the lungs, then move through the larynx to the vocal sac. Of the total body weight of male spring peepers, 15% is made up of the trunk muscles – which contain 2% of lipids in the body by volume – and showcase enzymes with mitochondrial markers. Calls that occur at rapid rates result in prominent energetic costs, which is why stored lipids are the source of 90% of energy applied to calling.

=== Thermoregulation ===
Climate plays a major role in the timing of spring peeper breeding: studies have shown a correlation between temperature and the date of first call (when spring peepers start to breed). Though the precise factors affecting breeding timing are complex, there has been a trend towards earlier breeding as average temperatures have increased since the early 20th century.

Another impact of temperature is the duration of mating calls. There is a negative relationship between the length of mating calls and throat temperature. However, male spring peepers with superior calling frequencies are positively related to throat temperature. The temperature of the surrounding environment of spring peepers also plays a role in the rate of calls, which is positively associated with the success of males during the mating and breeding period, showing that increasing site and throat temperatures result in increasing dominant frequency.

Spring peepers are known to tolerate freezing temperatures by producing a glucose-based cryoprotectant to limit cell shrinkage and prevent cell freezing.

== Geographic range and habitat ==
The southern spring peeper&#x27;s habitat includes the Gulf Coast from southeastern Texas to southeastern Georgia and northern Florida, United States. Its northern conspecific occurs in the entire east of the Mississippi and ranges to the Atlantic provinces in Canada as far west as Saskatchewan.

Spring peepers live primarily in forests and regenerating woodlands near ephemeral or semipermanent wetlands. It frequently occurs in breeding aggregations of several hundred individuals, and commonly breeds in temporary ponds (vernal ponds, which eventually dry during the summer months), intermediate ponds that have interchanging periods of being dry and wet every year, ponds customarily filled year-round, swamps, and disturbed habitats, such as farm ponds and borrow pits. During the breeding season, the spring peeper will be found near bodies of water that are free of fish and pollutants. During actual breeding, their choruses form near where trees hang by bushy plants or secondary forests. Their choruses can also be located within ponds, marshes, or swamps. They will usually resume call activity during warm rain, and are not commonly seen outside of their breeding choruses. During the non-breeding season, they will inhabit dead plant material from trees, shrubs, and other plants in the woods.

Although they are able to inhabit multiple types of ponds, spring peepers have been seen to be superior competitors in permanent ponds due to their higher caliber of predation resistance within the environment. This amphibious species requires marshes, ponds, or swamp regions to support the aquatic environment the eggs and tadpoles need.

In the northern reaches of their range, spring peepers must endure occasional periods of subfreezing temperatures during the breeding season. The species can tolerate the freezing of some of its body fluids, and undergoes hibernation under logs or behind loose bark on trees. It is capable of surviving the freezing of its internal body fluids to temperatures as low as −8 °C (17.6 °F).

== Home range and territoriality ==
The mating displays of male spring peepers vary with different environmental factors: humidity and vegetation density. These factors play a significant role in the arboreal behavior and nature of spring peepers during mating. At sites with higher humidity and air temperature, there is increased dominance of arboreal behavior, which showcases that latitude may play a role. Spring peepers which reside in areas of warmer temperatures tend to exhibit arboreal behavior to greater extents compared to those in environments of lower temperatures. When comparing the improvement of mating calls in males, calls from above ground compared to those near the ground showcased better results. Local vegetation may also play a role in the betterment of arboreal calling compared to calling from lower levels due to the spatial aspects interrupting the call.

Spring peepers almost always migrate at night. This is most likely to prevent drying out.

== Diet ==
=== Larva (tadpole) ===
Tadpoles are suspension feeders, therefore they graze on inorganic and organic matter. They also feed on algae and other organisms in the water.

=== Adult ===
Spring peepers are nocturnal insectivores, emerging at night to feed primarily on small invertebrates, such as beetles, ants, flies, and spiders. They do not climb high into trees, but hunt in low vegetation. Spring peepers living in deep, damp forests are active hunters both day and night, whereas those found in woodland edges restrict most hunting and other activity to night. The spring peeper&#x27;s diet involves the filtering of particles from water columns and scouring periphyton and detritus (dead, organic matter) from environmental surfaces in their habitat.

== Reproduction and lifecycle ==
=== Brood size ===
Spring peepers breed in southern areas from October to March, depending on the local temperature. In northern areas, they breed between March and June, when the warm rains start. &quot;P. crucifer&quot; typically lays around 900 eggs per clutch, but up to 1000 are possible. Females will lay eggs singularly or in groups of two or three. Egg clusters are hidden under vegetation or debris at the water base.

=== Lifespan ===

After they hatch, they remain tadpoles for two to three months before transforming into frogs and are ready to leave the water. Following breeding in the spring, the spring peepers&#x27; larval stage lasts two to three months. The spring peeper can live an estimated three years in the wild.

By looking at the different shading/coloring of concentric rings in the skeletons of spring peepers, age can be determined regarding the way of bone growth. Darker lines coincide with periods of higher survival rates during winter months. Lighter lines and areas represent periods of bone deposition and rapid growth. These lines allow it to be determined that spring peepers begin to breed, going into their third spring when they are two years old. Male spring peepers have reached sexual maturity at this time yet are smaller in size than females. Between spring peepers&#x27; second and third years, their body size increases significantly, then subsequently plateaus. During the first season of breeding, the two-year-old males produce higher frequency calls than males in their third and fourth seasons do 

== Mating ==

=== Mate searching behavior ===
As their common name implies, the spring peeper has a high-pitched call similar to that of a young chicken, only much louder and rising slightly in tone. They are among the first frogs in the regions to call in the spring. Unlike &quot;A. americanus&quot; and &quot;P. feriarum&quot; whose call activity is dependent on seasonality, 63% of variance in &quot;P. crucifer&quot; call is explained by temperature. Calling rate can be modified by interactions among neighboring males, which tend to alternate calls with one another. The mating calls of the spring peeper consist of a sound very similar to a &quot;peep&quot; and are repeated by males up to 13,500 times per night. As a chorus, they resemble the sounds of sleigh bells. They are heard early in spring not long after the ice melts on the wetlands. The males usually call from the edges of the bodies of water in which they breed, hidden near the bases of shrubs or grasses. Even when calling, they may be difficult to locate and are most easily seen when in amplexus in the shallows. As in other frogs, an aggressive call is made when densities are high. This call is a rising trill closely resembling the breeding call of the southern chorus frog (&quot;Pseudacris nigrita nigrita&quot;).

=== Female/male interactions ===

==== Courting ====

Females choose mates based on the speed and volume of these male calls. Interestingly, females also discriminate between distinct genetic lineages, with females preferring males of their own lineage, possibly due to the detrimental effects of hybridization. Older, larger males tend to have faster and louder calls that are preferred by the females. A segment of the male population, known as &#x27;satellite males&#x27; do not make these calls, but instead position themselves near loud males and attempt to intercept females drawn in by these calls. Males can switch between satellite-ing and calling. The satellite tactic is not associated with size or inferiority. Males normally call between 15 and 25 times per minute to attract mates starting in the evening and continuing through the night. Though only weighing a few grams, the Spring Peeper can produce a call as loud as songbirds that weigh 10-100 times as much. Male spring peepers have also been found to increase the duration and frequency of aggressive calls in response to increased calling intensity from others. These satellite males are also known to circumvent female choice and increase rates of hybridization between spring peeper lineages. Males produce both advertisement calls, long-range calls that signal a male&#x27;s position to other males and to attract females, and courtship calls, short-range calls that are directed toward nearby females to inform them that the male is ready to mate.
==== Mate choice ====
It has been established that the mating call of male spring peepers acts as an etiological isolating mechanism. As a potential agent of sexual selection, the mating call has many variations that may come into play as a major factor in mate choice by females. During mating, females monitor body size in correlation to the frequency of calls in an inverse matter. The basilar papilla of the inner ear is responsible for decoding and detecting mating calls. The basilar papilla units within the female ear are tuned between 2100 and 3700 Hz and are dependent on intensity. Females tend to select low-frequency calls over high-frequency ones because the calls at the lower end of the spectrum are easier to detect. The calls of spring peepers are often repeated, which has been deemed essential concerning the evolution of the mate choice of females reacting to particular mating and courtship behavior.

==Predation==

Spring peepers predators include great diving beetle larvae (when in tadpole form), snakes, skunks, and larger frogs.

Drying periods of ponds typically align before or during the metamorphic larval stage of spring peepers due to their slower growth rates. This suggests that higher mortality rates may be an effect. Salamanders and particular kinds of fish are seen to have profound impacts on the survivorship of spring peeper tadpoles. Each type of pond typically hosts different predators: temporary ponds host beetle larvae and dragonflies, intermediate ponds host salamanders and beetle larvae, and permanent ponds host fishes and dragonfly larvae. Each predator plays a role as a potential predator to the spring peeper, depending on which type of pond they inhabit.

Spring peeper larvae are thought to be poor competitors in environments where other anurans are present. This is typically due to the larval spring peepers&#x27; small size and lower levels of activity. The small size of the larval allows them to be able to deal with their depressed resource density. Larval spring peepers harvest smaller amounts of resources, resulting in them having lower metabolic costs and a maintained growth rate. Spring peepers are said to occupy locations where predators have previously gotten ridden of bigger competitors.

== Conservation status ==
The spring peeper has no special status in most areas. It is common and widespread in the eastern regions. However, its habitats change quickly due to loss of wetlands. In some areas, its populations have decreased significantly.

The species is listed as threatened in both Iowa and Kansas.

== Taxonomy ==
There are currently two subspecies recognized, although detailed genetic and behavioral analysis demonstrates they likely are not taxonomically accurate:
* The northern, &quot;P. c. crucifer&quot;, found all over the eastern United States and eastern Canada.
* The southern, &quot;P. c. bartramiana&quot;. The southern is distinguished by a strong dark marking on its belly. &quot;P. c. bartramiana&quot; is found along the southern Gulf Coast from southeastern Texas to northern Florida and southern Georgia.

<doc id="439139" wikidata="Q1140782" url="?curid=439139" title="HMS Illustrious (87)">
<text>HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; was the lead ship of her class of aircraft carriers built for the Royal Navy before World War II. Her first assignment after completion and working up was with the Mediterranean Fleet, in which her aircraft&#x27;s most notable achievement was sinking one Italian battleship and badly damaging two others during the Battle of Taranto in late 1940. Two months later the carrier was crippled by German dive bombers and was repaired in the United States. After sustaining damage on the voyage home in late 1941 by a collision with her sister ship , &quot;Illustrious&quot; was sent to the Indian Ocean in early 1942 to support the invasion of Vichy French Madagascar (Operation Ironclad). After returning home in early 1943, the ship was given a lengthy refit and briefly assigned to the Home Fleet. She was transferred to Force H for the Battle of Salerno in mid-1943 and then rejoined the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean at the beginning of 1944. Her aircraft attacked several targets in the Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies over the following year before &quot;Illustrious&quot; was transferred to the newly formed British Pacific Fleet (BPF). The carrier participated in the early stages of the Battle of Okinawa until mechanical defects arising from accumulated battle damage became so severe she was ordered home early for repairs in May 1945.

The war ended while she was in the dockyard and the Admiralty decided to modify her for use as the Home Fleet&#x27;s trials and training carrier. In this role she conducted the deck-landing trials for most of the British post-war naval aircraft in the early 1950s. She was occasionally used to ferry troops and aircraft to and from foreign deployments as well as participating in exercises. In 1951, she helped to transport troops to quell rioting in Cyprus after the collapse of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936. She was paid off in early 1955 and sold for scrap in late 1956.

==Background and description==

The Royal Navy&#x27;s 1936 Naval Programme authorised the construction of two aircraft carriers. Admiral Sir Reginald Henderson, Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy, was determined not to simply modify the previous unarmoured design. He believed that carriers could not be successfully defended by their own aircraft without some form of early-warning system. Lacking that, there was nothing to prevent land-based aircraft from attacking them, especially in confined waters like the North Sea and Mediterranean. This meant that the ship had to be capable of remaining in action after sustaining damage and that her fragile aircraft had to be protected entirely from damage. The only way to do this was to completely armour the hangar in which the aircraft would shelter, but putting so much weight high in the ship allowed only a single-storey hangar due to stability concerns. This halved the aircraft capacity compared with the older unarmoured carriers, exchanging offensive potential for defensive survivability.

&quot;Illustrious&quot; was in length overall and at the waterline. Her beam was at the waterline and she had a draught of at deep load. She displaced at standard load as completed. Her complement was approximately 1,299 officers and enlisted men upon completion in 1940. By 1944, she was severely overcrowded with a total crew of 1,997. After post-war modifications to convert her into a trials carrier, her complement was reduced to 1,090 officers and enlisted men.

The ship had three Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft, using steam supplied by six Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , enough to give a maximum speed of at deep load. On 24 May 1940 &quot;Illustrious&quot; ran her sea trials and her engines reached . Her exact speeds were not recorded as she had her paravanes streamed, but it was estimated that she could have made about under full power. She carried a maximum of of fuel oil which gave her a range of at or at or at .

The armoured flight deck had a usable length of , due to prominent &quot;round-downs&quot; at each end designed to reduce the effects of air turbulence caused by the carrier&#x27;s structure on aircraft taking-off and landing, and a maximum width of . A single hydraulic aircraft catapult was fitted on the forward part of the flight deck. The ship was equipped with two unarmoured lifts on the centreline, each of which measured . The hangar was long and had a maximum width of . It had a height of which allowed storage of Lend-Lease Vought F4U Corsair fighters once their wingtips were clipped. The hangar was designed to accommodate 36 aircraft, for which of aviation spirit was provided.

===Armament, electronics and protection===
The main armament of the &quot;Illustrious&quot; class consisted of sixteen quick-firing (QF)  dual-purpose guns in eight twin-gun turrets, four in sponsons on each side of the hull. The roofs of the gun turrets protruded above the level of the flight deck to allow them to fire across the deck at high elevations. Her light antiaircraft defences included six octuple mounts for QF 2-pounder (&quot;pom-pom&quot;) antiaircraft guns, two each fore and aft of her island, and two in sponsons on the port side of the hull.

The completion of &quot;Illustrious&quot; was delayed two months to fit her with a Type 79Z early-warning radar; she was the first aircraft carrier in the world to be fitted with radar before completion. This version of the radar had separate transmitting and receiving antennas which required a new mainmast to be added to the aft end of the island to mount the transmitter.

The &quot;Illustrious&quot;-class ships had a flight deck protected by of armour and the internal sides and ends of the hangars were thick. The hangar deck itself was thick and extended the full width of the ship to meet the top of the 4.5-inch waterline armour belt. The underwater defence system was a layered system of liquid- and air-filled compartments backed by a splinter bulkhead.

===Wartime modifications===
While under repair in 1941, &quot;Illustrious&quot;″s rear &quot;round-down&quot; was flattened to increase the usable length of the flight deck to . This increased her aircraft complement to 47 aircraft by use of a permanent deck park of 6 aircraft. Her light AA armament was also augmented by the addition of 10 Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon in single mounts. In addition the two steel fire curtains in the hangar were replaced by asbestos ones. After her return to the UK later that year, her Type 79Z radar was replaced by a Type 281 system and a Type 285 gunnery radar was mounted on one of the main fire-control directors. The additional crewmen, maintenance personnel and facilities needed to support these aircraft, weapons and sensors increased her complement to 1,326.

During her 1943 refits, the flight deck was modified to extend its usable length to , and &quot;outriggers&quot; were probably added at this time. These were U-shaped beams that extended from the side of the flight deck into which aircraft tailwheels were placed. The aircraft were pushed back until the main wheels were near the edge of the flight deck to allow more aircraft to be stored on the deck. Twin Oerlikon mounts replaced most of the single mounts. Other twin mounts were added so that by May she had a total of eighteen twin and two single mounts. The Type 281 radar was replaced by an upgraded Type 281M, and a single-antenna Type 79M was added. Type 282 gunnery radars were added for each of the &quot;pom-pom&quot; directors, and the rest of the main directors were fitted with Type 285 radars. A Type 272 target-indicator radar was mounted above her bridge. These changes increased her aircraft capacity to 57 and caused her crew to grow to 1,831.

A year later, in preparation for her service against the Japanese in the Pacific, one starboard octuple &quot;pom-pom&quot; mount, directly abaft the island, was replaced by two 40 mm Bofors AA guns. Two more twin Oerlikon mounts were added, and her boilers were retubed. At this time her complement was 1,997 officers and enlisted men. By 1945, accumulated wear-and-tear as well as undiagnosed shock damage to &quot;Illustrious&quot;″s machinery caused severe vibrations in her centre propeller shaft at high speeds. In an effort to cure the problem, the propeller was removed, and the shaft was locked in place in February; these radical measures succeeded in reducing, but not eliminating, the vibrations and reduced the ship&#x27;s speed to about .

===Post-war modifications===
&quot;Illustrious&quot; had been badly damaged underwater by a bomb in April 1945, and was ordered home for repairs the following month. She began permanent repairs in June that were scheduled to last four months. The RN planned to fit her out as a flagship, remove her aft 4.5-inch guns in exchange for increased accommodation, and replace some of her Oerlikons with single two-pounder AA guns, but the end of the war in August caused the RN to reassess its needs. In September, it decided that the &quot;Illustrious&quot; would become the trials and training carrier for the Home Fleet and her repairs were changed into a lengthy refit that lasted until June 1946. Her complement was sharply reduced by her change in role and she retained her aft 4.5-inch guns. Her light AA armament now consisted of six octuple &quot;pom-pom&quot; mountings, eighteen single Oerlikons, and seventeen single and two twin Bofors mounts. The flight deck was extended forward, which increased her overall length to . The high-angle director atop the island was replaced with an American SM-1 fighter-direction radar, a Type 293M target-indication system was added, and the Type 281M was replaced with a prototype Type 960 early-warning radar. The sum total of the changes since her commissioning increased her full-load displacement by . In 1947 she carried five 8-barrel pom-poms, 17 Bofors and 16 Oerlikons. A five-bladed propeller was installed on her centre shaft although the increasing wear on her outer shafts later partially negated the reduction in vibration. While running trials in 1948, after another refit, she reached a maximum speed of from . Two years later, she made 29.2 knots from . At some point after 1948, the ship&#x27;s light AA armament was reduced to two twin and nineteen single 40 mm guns and six Oerlikons.

==Construction and service==

&quot;Illustrious&quot;, the fourth ship of her name, was ordered as part of the 1936 Naval Programme from Vickers-Armstrongs on 13 April 1937. Construction was delayed by slow deliveries of her armour plates because the industry had been crippled by a lack of orders over the last 15 years as a result of the Washington Naval Treaty. As a consequence, her flight-deck armour had to be ordered from Vítkovice Mining and Iron Corporation in Czechoslovakia. She was laid down at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard two weeks later as yard number 732 and launched on 5 April 1939. She was christened by Lady Henderson, wife of the recently retired Third Sea Lord. &quot;Illustrious&quot; was then towed to Buccleuch Dock for fitting out and Captain Denis Boyd was appointed to command her on 29 January 1940. She was commissioned on 16 April 1940 and, excluding her armament, she cost £2,295,000 to build.

While &quot;Illustrious&quot; was being moved in preparation for her acceptance trials on 24 April, the tugboat &quot;Poolgarth&quot; capsized with the loss of three crewmen. The carrier conducted preliminary flying trials in the Firth of Clyde with six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers that had been craned aboard earlier. In early June, she loaded the personnel from 806, 815, and 819 Squadrons at Devonport Royal Dockyard; 806 Squadron was equipped with Blackburn Skua dive bombers and Fairey Fulmar fighters, and the latter two squadrons were equipped with Swordfish. She began working up off Plymouth, but the German conquest of France made this too risky, and &quot;Illustrious&quot; sailed for Bermuda later in the month to continue working up. This was complete by 23 July, when she arrived in the Clyde and flew off her aircraft. The ship was docked in Clydeside for a minor refit the following day; she arrived in Scapa Flow on 15 August, and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Lumley Lyster. Her squadrons flew back aboard, and she sailed for the Mediterranean on 22 August with 15 Fulmars and 18 Swordfish aboard.

After refuelling in Gibraltar, &quot;Illustrious&quot; and the battleship were escorted into the Mediterranean by Force H as part of Operation Hats, during which her Fulmars shot down five Italian bombers and her AA guns shot down two more. Now escorted by the bulk of the Mediterranean Fleet, eight of her Swordfish, together with some from the carrier , attacked the Italian seaplane base at Rhodes on the morning of 3 September. A few days after the Italian invasion of Egypt, &quot;Illustrious&quot; flew off 15 Swordfish during the moonlit night of 16/17 September to attack the port of Benghazi. Aircraft from 819 Squadron laid six mines in the harbour entrance while those from 815 Squadron sank the destroyer and two freighters totalling . The destroyer later struck one of the mines and sank. During the return voyage to Alexandria, the made an unsuccessful attack on the British ships. While escorting a convoy to Malta on 29 September, the carrier&#x27;s Fulmars broke up attacks by Italian high-level and torpedo bombers, shooting down one for the loss of one fighter. While returning from another convoy escort mission, the Swordfish of &quot;Illustrious&quot; and &quot;Eagle&quot; attacked the Italian airfield on the island of Leros on the evening of 13/14 October.

===Battle of Taranto===
Upon his arrival in the Mediterranean, Lyster proposed a carrier airstrike on the Italian fleet at its base in Taranto, as the Royal Navy had been planning since the Abyssinia Crisis of 1935, and Admiral Andrew Cunningham, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, approved the idea by 22 September 1940. The attack, with both available carriers, was originally planned for 21 October, the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar, but a hangar fire aboard &quot;Illustrious&quot; on 18 October forced its postponement until 11 November when the next favourable phase of the moon occurred. The fire destroyed three Swordfish and heavily damaged two others, but they were replaced by aircraft from &quot;Eagle&quot;, whose contaminated fuel tanks prevented her from participating in the attack.

Repairs were completed before the end of the month, and she escorted a convoy to Greece, during which her Fulmars shot down one shadowing CANT Z.506B floatplane. She sailed from Alexandria on 6 November, escorted by the battleships , , and &quot;Valiant&quot;, two light cruisers, and 13 destroyers, to provide air cover for another convoy to Malta. At this time her air group was reinforced by several of &quot;Eagle&quot;″s Gloster Sea Gladiators supplementing the fighters of 806 Squadron as well as torpedo bombers from 813 and 824 Squadrons. The former aircraft were carried &quot;...as a permanent deck park...&quot; and they shot down a CANT Z.501 seaplane two days later. Later that day seven Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 medium bombers were intercepted by three Fulmars, which claimed to have shot down one bomber and damaged another. In reality, they heavily damaged three of the Italian aircraft. A Z.501 searching for the fleet was shot down on 10 November by a Fulmar and another on the 11th. A flight of nine SM.79s was intercepted later that day and the Fulmars claimed to have damaged one of the bombers, although it actually failed to return to base. Three additional Fulmars had been flown aboard from &quot;Ark Royal&quot; a few days earlier, when both carriers were near Malta; that brought its strength up to 15 Fulmars, 24 Swordfish, and two to four Sea Gladiators. Three Swordfish crashed shortly after take-off on 10 and 11 November, probably due to fuel contamination, and the maintenance crewmen spent all day laboriously draining all the fuel tanks and refilling them with clean petrol. This left only 21 aircraft available for the attack.
Now augmented by reinforcements from the UK, the Mediterranean Fleet detached &quot;Illustrious&quot;, four cruisers, and four destroyers to a point south-east of Taranto. The first wave of a dozen aircraft, all that the ship could launch at one time, flew off by 20:40 and the second wave of nine by 21:34. Six aircraft in each airstrike were armed with torpedoes and the remainder with bombs or flares or both to supplement the three-quarter moon. The Royal Air Force (RAF) had positioned a Short Sunderland flying boat off the harbour to search for any movement to or from the port and this was detected at 17:55 by acoustic locators and again at 20:40, alerting the defenders. The noise of the on-coming first airstrike was heard at 22:25 and the anti-aircraft guns defending the port opened fire shortly afterwards, as did those on the ships in the harbour. The torpedo-carrying aircraft of the first wave scored one hit on the battleship and two on the recently completed battleship while the two flare droppers bombed the oil storage depot with little effect. The four aircraft loaded with bombs set one hangar in the seaplane base on fire and hit the destroyer with one bomb that failed to detonate. The destroyer , or &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot;, shot down the aircraft that put a torpedo into the latter ship, but the remaining aircraft returned to &quot;Illustrious&quot;.

One torpedo-carrying aircraft of the second wave was forced to return when its long-range external fuel tank fell off, but the others hit the &quot;Littorio&quot; once more and the was hit once when they attacked beginning at 23:55. The two flare droppers also bombed the oil storage depot with minimal effect, and one bomb penetrated through the hull of the heavy cruiser without detonating. One torpedo bomber was shot down, but the other aircraft returned. A follow on airstrike was planned for the next night based on the pessimistic assessments of the aircrews, but it was cancelled due to bad weather. Reconnaissance photos taken by the R.A.F. showed three battleships with their decks awash and surrounded by pools of oil. The two airstrikes had changed the balance of power in the Mediterranean by rendering the &quot;Conte di Cavour&quot; unavailable for the rest of the war, and badly damaging the &quot;Littorio&quot; and the &quot;Duilio&quot;.

===Subsequent operations in the Mediterranean===
While en route to Alexandria the ship&#x27;s Fulmars engaged four CANT Z.506Bs, claiming three shot down and the fourth damaged, although Italian records indicate the loss of only two aircraft on 12 November. Two weeks later, 15 Swordfish attacked Italian positions on Leros, losing one Swordfish. While off Malta two days later, six of the carrier&#x27;s fighters engaged an equal number of Fiat CR.42 Falco biplane fighters, shooting down one and damaging two others. One Fulmar was lightly damaged during the battle. On the night of 16/17 December, 11 Swordfish bombed Rhodes and the island of Stampalia with little effect. Four days later &quot;Illustrious&quot;″s aircraft attacked two convoys near the Kerkennah Islands and sank two merchant ships totalling . On the morning of 22 December, 13 Swordfish attacked Tripoli harbour, starting fires and hitting warehouses multiple times. The ship arrived back at Alexandria two days later.
On 7 January 1941, &quot;Illustrious&quot; set sail to provide air cover for convoys to Piraeus, Greece and Malta as part of Operation Excess. For this operation, her fighters were reinforced by a detachment of three Fulmars from 805 Squadron. During the morning of 10 January, her Swordfish attacked an Italian convoy without significant effect. Later that morning three of the five Fulmars on Combat Air Patrol (CAP) engaged three SM.79s at low altitude, claiming one shot down. One Fulmar was damaged and forced to return to the carrier, while the other two exhausted their ammunition and fuel during the combat and landed at Hal Far airfield on Malta. The remaining pair engaged a pair of torpedo-carrying SM.79s, damaging one badly enough that it crashed upon landing. They were low on ammunition and out of position, as they chased the Italian aircraft over from &quot;Illustrious&quot;. The carrier launched four replacements at 12:35, just when 24–36 Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers of the First Group/Dive Bomber Wing 1 (I. Gruppe/Sturzkampfgeschwader (StG) 1) and the Second Group/Dive Bomber Wing 2 (II. Gruppe/StG 2) began their attack, led by Paul-Werner Hozzel. Another pair were attempting to take off when the first bomb struck just forward of the aft lift, destroying the Fulmar whose engine had failed to start and detonating high in the lift well; the other aircraft took off and engaged the Stukas as they pulled out of their dive.

The ship was hit five more times in this attack, one of which penetrated the un-armoured aft lift and detonated beneath it, destroying it and the surrounding structure. One bomb struck and destroyed the starboard forward &quot;pom-pom&quot; mount closest to the island, while another passed through the forwardmost port &quot;pom-pom&quot; mount and failed to detonate, although it did start a fire. One bomb penetrated the outer edge of the forward port flight deck and detonated about above the water, riddling the adjacent hull structure with holes which caused flooding in some compartments and starting a fire. The most damaging hit was a large bomb that penetrated through the deck armour forward of the aft lift and detonated 10 feet above the hangar deck. The explosion started a severe fire, destroyed the rear fire sprinkler system, bent the forward lift like a hoop and shredded the fire curtains into lethal splinters. It also blew a hole in the hangar deck, damaging areas three decks below. The Stukas also near-missed &quot;Illustrious&quot; with two bombs, which caused minor damage and flooding. The multiple hits at the aft end of the carrier knocked out her steering gear, although it was soon repaired.

Another attack by 13 Ju 87s at 13:20 hit the ship once more in the aft lift well, which again knocked out her steering and reduced her speed to . This attack was intercepted by six of the ship&#x27;s Fulmars which had rearmed and refuelled ashore after they had dropped their bombs, but only two of the dive bombers were damaged before the Fulmars ran out of ammunition. The carrier, steering only by using her engines, was attacked several more times before she entered Grand Harbour&#x27;s breakwater at 21:04, still on fire. The attacks killed 126 officers and men and wounded 91. Nine Swordfish and five Fulmars were destroyed during the attack. One additional Swordfish, piloted by Lieutenant Charles Lamb, was attempting to land when the bombs began to strike and was forced to ditch when it ran out of fuel; the crew was rescued by the destroyer . The British fighters claimed to have shot down five Ju 87s, with the fleet&#x27;s anti-aircraft fire claiming three others. Germans records show the loss of three Stukas, with another forced to make an emergency landing.
While her steering was being repaired in Malta, the &quot;Illustrious&quot; was bombed again on 16 January by 17 Junkers Ju 88 medium bombers and 44 Stukas. The pilots of 806 Squadron claimed to have shot down two of the former and possibly damaged another pair, but a 500 kg bomb penetrated her flight deck aft of the rear lift and detonated in the captain&#x27;s day cabin; several other bombs nearly hit the ship but only caused minor damage. Two days later, one of three Fulmars that intercepted an Axis air raid on the Maltese airfields was shot down with no survivors. Only one Fulmar was serviceable on 19 January, when the carrier was attacked several times and it was shot down. &quot;Illustrious&quot; was not struck during these attacks but was near-missed several times and the resulting shock waves from their detonations dislodged enough hull plating to cause an immediate 5-degree list, cracked the cast-iron foundations of her port turbine, and damaged other machinery. The naval historian J. D. Brown noted that &quot;There is no doubt that the armoured deck saved her from destruction; no other carrier took anything like this level of punishment and survived.&quot;

Without aircraft aboard, she sailed to Alexandria on 23 January escorted by four destroyers, for temporary repairs that lasted until 10 March. Boyd was promoted to rear admiral on 18 February and relieved Lyster as Rear Admiral Aircraft Carriers. He transferred his flag to &quot;Formidable&quot; when she arrived at Alexandria on 10 March, just before &quot;Illustrious&quot; sailed for Port Said to begin her transit of the Suez Canal. The Germans had laid mines in the canal earlier. Clearing the mines and the ships sunk by them was a slow process and &quot;Illustrious&quot; did not reach Suez Bay until 20 March. The ship then sailed for Durban, South Africa, to have the extent of her underwater damage assessed in the drydock there. She reached Durban on 4 April and remained there for two weeks. The ship ultimately arrived at the Norfolk Navy Yard in the United States on 12 May for permanent repairs.
Some important modifications were made to her flight deck arrangements, including the installation of a new aft lift and modification of the catapult for use by American-built aircraft. Her light antiaircraft armament was also augmented during the refit. Captain Lord Louis Mountbatten relieved her acting captain on 12 August, although he did not arrive aboard her until 28 August. He was almost immediately sent on a speaking tour to influence American public opinion, until he was recalled home in October and relieved by Captain A. G. Talbot on 1 October. The work was completed in November and &quot;Illustrious&quot; departed on 25 October, for trials off Jamaica and to load the dozen Swordfish of 810 and 829 Squadrons. She returned to Norfolk on 9 December, to rendezvous with &quot;Formidable&quot;, which had also been repaired there, and the carriers sailed for home three days later. On the night of 15/16 December, &quot;Illustrious&quot; collided with &quot;Formidable&quot; in a moderate storm. Neither ship was seriously damaged, but &quot;Illustrious&quot; had to reduce speed to shore up sprung bulkheads in the bow and conduct temporary repairs to the forward flight deck. She arrived at Greenock on 21 December and permanent repairs were made from 30 December to late February 1942 at Cammell Laird&#x27;s shipyard in Birkenhead. While working up her air group in March, reinforced by the Grumman Martlet fighters (the British name of the F4F Wildcat) of 881 and 882 Squadrons, she conducted trials of a &quot;hooked&quot; Supermarine Spitfire fighter, the prototype of the Seafire.

===In the Indian Ocean===

The conquest of British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies in early 1942 opened the door for Japanese advances into the Indian Ocean. The Vichy French-controlled island of Madagascar stood astride the line of communication between India and the UK and the British were worried that the French would accede to occupation of the island as they had to the Japanese occupation of French Indochina in 1940. Preventing this required a preemptive invasion of Diego Suarez scheduled for May 1942. &quot;Illustrious&quot; had her work up cut short on 19 March to prepare to join the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean and participate in the attack. She sailed four days later, having embarked twenty-one Swordfish, nine Martlet IIs of 881 Squadron and six Martlet Is of 882 Squadron, and two Fulmar fighters prior to escorting a troop convoy carrying some of the men allocated for the assault. A hangar fire broke out on 2 April that destroyed 11 aircraft and killed one crewman, but failed to cause any serious damage to the ship. Repairs were made in Freetown, Sierra Leone, where her destroyed aircraft were replaced and augmented by twelve additional Martlet II fighters from HMS &quot;Archer&quot;, while two Martlet I aircraft were, in turn, transferred to &quot;Archer&quot;, bringing &quot;Illustrious&quot;″s total aircraft complement to 47. After her stay at Freetown, &quot;Illustrious&quot; proceeded to Durban; during the voyage her staff also fitted ASV radar to the replacement Swordfish. One Martlet I was fitted with folding wings.

&quot;Illustrious&quot;″s aircraft were tasked to attack French naval units and shipping and to defend the invasion fleet, while her half-sister provided air support for the ground forces. For the operation the carrier&#x27;s air group numbered 25 Martlets, 1 night-fighting Fulmar and 21 Swordfish, and was consequently forced to have a permanent deck park of 5 Martlets and one Swordfish. Before dawn on 5 May, she launched 18 Swordfish together with 8 Martlets. The first flight of 6 Swordfish, carrying torpedoes, unsuccessfully attacked the aviso , but sank the armed merchant cruiser . The second flight, carrying depth charges, sank the submarine while the third flight dropped leaflets over the defenders before attacking an artillery battery and &quot;D&#x27;Entrecasteaux&quot;. One aircraft of the third flight was forced to make an emergency landing and its crew was captured by the French. Later in the day, &quot;D&#x27;Entrecasteaux&quot; attempted to put to sea, but she was successfully bombed by an 829 Squadron Swordfish and deliberately run aground to avoid sinking. Three other Swordfish completed her destruction. The next morning, Martlets from 881 Squadron intercepted three Potez 63.11 reconnaissance bombers, shooting down two and forcing the other to retreat, while Swordfish dropped dummy parachutists as a diversion. One patrolling Swordfish sank the submarine and another spotted for ships bombarding French defences. On the morning of 7 May, Martlets from 881 Squadron intercepted three Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters on a reconnaissance mission. All three were shot down for the loss of one Martlet. In addition to the other losses enumerated, 882 Squadron&#x27;s Fulmar was shot down while providing ground support. &quot;Illustrious&quot;&#x27; aircraft flew 209 sorties and suffered six deck landing crashes, including four by Martlets.
She was then formally assigned to the Eastern Fleet and, after a short refit in Durban, sailed to Colombo, Ceylon, and became the flagship of the Rear Admiral Aircraft Carriers, Eastern Fleet, Denis Boyd, her former captain. At the beginning of August, the ship participated in Operation Stab, a decoy invasion of the Andaman Islands to distract the Japanese when the Americans were beginning the Guadalcanal Campaign in the South Pacific. Captain Robert Cunliffe relieved Talbott on 22 August. On 10 September the carrier covered the amphibious landing that opened operations Stream, Line and Jane, the occupation of the remainder of Madagascar, and the landing at Tamatave eight days later, but no significant resistance was encountered and her aircraft were not needed. For this operation she had aboard six Fulmars of 806 Squadron, 23 Martlets of 881 Squadron and 18 Swordfish of 810 and 829 Squadrons.

===European waters===

After a farewell visit from the Eastern Fleet commander, Admiral Sir James Somerville on 12 January 1943, &quot;Illustrious&quot; sailed for home the next day. She flew off her aircraft to Gibraltar on 31 January and continued on to the Clyde where she arrived five days later. She conducted deck-landing trials for prototypes of the Blackburn Firebrand and Fairey Firefly fighters, as well as the Fairey Barracuda dive/torpedo bomber from 8 to 10 February. On 26 February she began a refit at Birkenhead that lasted until 7 June during which her flight deck was extended, new radars were installed, her light anti-aircraft armament was augmented, and two new arrestor wires were fitted aft of the rear lift which increased her effective landing area. While conducting her post-refit trials, she also conducted flying trials for Martlet Vs and Barracudas. Both sets of trials were completed by 18 July, by which time the &quot;Illustrious&quot; had joined the Home Fleet.

On 26 July, she sortied for the Norwegian Sea as part of Operation Governor, together with the battleship , the American battleship , and the light carrier , an attempt to fool the Germans into thinking that Sicily was not the only objective for an Allied invasion. 810 Squadron was the only unit retained from her previous air group and it had been re-equipped with Barracudas during her refit. Her fighter complement was augmented by 878 and 890 Squadrons, each with 10 Martlet Vs, and 894 Squadron with 10 Seafire IICs. These latter aircraft lacked folding wings and could not fit on the lifts. The British ships were spotted by Blohm &amp; Voss BV 138 flying boats and 890 Squadron shot down two of them before the fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 29 July. She transferred to Greenock at the end of the month and sailed on 5 August to provide air cover for the ocean liner as she conveyed Prime Minister Winston Churchill to the Quebec Conference. Once the convoy was out of range of German aircraft, the &quot;Illustrious&quot; left the convoy and arrived back at Greenock on 8 August.
Together with the &quot;Unicorn&quot;, she sailed for the Mediterranean on 13 August to prepare for the landings at Salerno (Operation Avalanche), reaching Malta a week later. Her air group was reinforced at this time by four more Martlets each for 878 and 890 Squadrons. She was assigned to Force H for the operation which was tasked to protect the amphibious force from attack by the Italian Fleet and provide air cover for the carriers supporting the assault force. The Italians made no effort to attack the Allied forces, and the most noteworthy thing that any of her aircraft did was when one of 890 Squadron&#x27;s Martlets escorted a surrendering Italian aircraft to Sicily. Before the &quot;Illustrious&quot; steamed for Malta she transferred six Seafires to the &quot;Unicorn&quot; to replace some of the latter&#x27;s aircraft wrecked in deck-landing accidents. Four of these then flew ashore to conduct operations until they rejoined &quot;Illustrious&quot; on 14 September at Malta.

She then returned to Britain on 18 October for a quick refit at Birkenhead that included further improvements to the flight deck and the reinforcement of her light anti-aircraft armament. She embarked the Barracudas of 810 and 847 Squadrons of No. 21 Naval Torpedo-Bomber Reconnaissance Wing on 27 November before beginning her work up three days later. No. 15 Naval Fighter Wing with the Vought Corsairs of 1830 and 1833 Squadrons were still training ashore and flew aboard before the work up was finished on 27 December.

===Return to the Indian Ocean===

&quot;Illustrious&quot; departed Britain on 30 December and arrived in Trincomalee, Ceylon, on 28 January 1944. She spent most of the next several months training although she participated in several sorties with the Eastern Fleet searching for Japanese warships in the Bay of Bengal and near the coast of Sumatra. The fleet departed Trincomalee on 21 March to rendezvous with the American carrier in preparation for combined operations against the Japanese facilities in the Dutch East Indies and the Andaman Islands. The first operation carried out by both carriers was an airstrike on the small naval base at Sabang at the northern tip of Sumatra (Operation Cockpit). The carrier&#x27;s air group consisted of 21 Barracudas and 28 Corsairs for the operation; &quot;Illustrious&quot; launched 17 of the former escorted by 13 of the latter on the morning of 19 April. The American bombers attacked the shipping in the harbour while the British aircraft attacked the shore installations. The oil storage tanks were destroyed and the port facilities badly damaged by the Barracudas. There was no aerial opposition and the fighters claimed to have destroyed 24 aircraft on the ground. All British aircraft returned safely although one American fighter was forced to ditch during the return home.

The &quot;Saratoga&quot; was ordered to depart for home for a refit by 19 May and Somerville wanted to mount one more attack as she was leaving the Indian Ocean. He chose the naval base and oil refinery at Surabaya, Java (Operation Transom), and the distance from the newly renamed East Indies Fleet&#x27;s base at Ceylon required refuelling at Exmouth Gulf on the western coast of Australia before the attack. The necessity to attack from the south, across the full width of Java, meant that the target was outside the Barracuda&#x27;s range and 810 and 847 Squadrons were replaced by the 18 Grumman Avengers of 832 and 845 Squadrons for the mission. Early on the morning of 17 May, the ship launched all 18 Avengers, escorted by 16 Corsairs. One Avenger crashed on take-off and an American Avenger was shot down over the target; only one small ship was sunk, and little damage was done to the refinery. The &quot;Saratoga&quot; and her escorts separated after refuelling again in Exmouth Gulf and the East Indies Fleet was back in Trincomalee on 27 May where No. 21 Wing reembarked.

On 10 June, the &quot;Illustrious&quot; and the escort carrier put to sea to simulate another airstrike on Sabang as a means of distracting the Japanese while the Americans were attacking airfields in the Mariana Islands and preparing to invade the island of Saipan. For the planned attack on Port Blair in the Andaman Islands in mid-June her air group was reinforced by the 14 Corsairs of 1837 Squadron; six Barracudas from No. 21 TBR Wing were landed to make room for the additional fighters. On 21 June, the ship launched 15 Barracudas and 23 Corsairs against the airfield and harbour of Port Blair. Two of the Barracudas were forced to return with engine trouble before the attack began and another was shot down over the target. In addition, one Corsair was forced to ditch; the pilot was rescued by a destroyer. Bad weather degraded the accuracy of the Barracudas and little damage was inflicted aside from a few aircraft destroyed on the ground and a few small craft sunk in the harbour. With over 50 aircraft airborne at one point, the British realised that a single deck accident might result in the loss of every aircraft in the air because there was no other carrier available to land aboard. The carrier and her escorts arrived back at Trincomalee on 23 June where 847 Squadron was merged into 810 Squadron a week later.

Her sister ships, the &quot;Indomitable&quot; and the arrived at the end of June although only the latter&#x27;s pilots were combat-ready. Captain Charles Lambe was appointed as the new captain of the &quot;Illustrious&quot; on 21 May, but he could not join his new ship until 9 July. Somerville decided to attack Sabang again (Operation Crimson), although the ships of the East Indies Fleet would bombard the port while the fighters from the &quot;Illustrious&quot; and the &quot;Victorious&quot; spotted for them and protected the fleet. As the Barracudas were needed only for anti-submarine patrols, the former embarked only nine while the latter ship flew off all her Barracudas. On the early morning of 25 July, &quot;Illustrious&quot; launched 22 Corsairs for CAP and to observe the naval gunfire and take photos for post-attack damage assessments. The bombardment was very effective, sinking two small freighters, and severely damaging the oil storage and port facilities. One Corsair was shot down by Japanese flak although the pilot was rescued after ditching. As the fleet was withdrawing, &quot;Illustrious&quot;″s CAP intercepted and shot down a Nakajima Ki-43 (codenamed &quot;Oscar&quot;) fighter and a Mitsubishi Ki-21 &quot;Sally&quot; medium bomber on reconnaissance missions. Later in the day her Corsairs intercepted 10 Ki-43s and shot down two of them while driving off the remainder. After arriving in Trincomalee, 1837 Squadron was transferred to the &quot;Victorious&quot;.

On 30 July, she sailed for Durban to begin a refit that lasted from 15 August to 10 October and arrived back at Trincomalee on 1 November. 810 Squadron and its Barracudas were transferred off the ship the next day and were later replaced by the Avengers of 854 Squadron. For the next six weeks she carried out an intensive flying regime in preparation for the next operations against the Japanese together with the other carriers of the fleet. On 22 November she was assigned to the newly formed British Pacific Fleet (BPF), commanded by Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser. She was assigned to the 1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron (1st ACS), commanded by Rear Admiral Sir Philip Vian when he arrived at Colombo aboard the carrier . A week later, &quot;Illustrious&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; sortied to attack an oil refinery at Pangkalan Brandan, Sumatra (Operation Outflank); the former&#x27;s airgroup now consisted of 36 Corsairs of 1830 and 1833 Squadrons and 21 Avengers of 857 Squadron. When the aircraft approached the target on the morning of 20 December, it was obscured by clouds so they diverted to the secondary target of the port at Belawan Deli. It was partially obscured by clouds and heavy squalls so the attacking aircraft had only moderate success, setting some structures on fire and destroying several aircraft on the ground.

On 16 January 1945 the BPF sailed for its primary base in the Pacific Ocean, Sydney, Australia. En route, the carriers of the 1st ACS attacked Palembang on 24 January and 29 January (Operation Meridian). &quot;Illustrious&quot;″s air group consisted of 32 Corsairs and 21 Avengers by now and she contributed 12 of her Avengers and 16 Corsairs to the first attack, which destroyed most of the oil storage tanks and cut the refinery&#x27;s output by half for three months. Five days later, the BPF attacked a different refinery and the ship launched 12 Avengers and 12 Corsairs. The attack was very successful at heavy cost; between the two air operations, her squadrons lost five Corsairs to enemy flak or fighters and one due to a mechanical problem on take-off as well as three Avengers to enemy action. Her Corsairs claimed four enemy aircraft shot down as did one Avenger pilot who claimed victory over a Nakajima Ki-44 &quot;Tojo&quot; fighter. The fleet&#x27;s fire discipline was poor when it was attacked by seven Japanese bombers shortly after the strike aircraft began landing. The attackers were all shot down, but two shells fired by either &quot;Indomitable&quot; or the battleship struck &quot;Illustrious&quot;, killing 12 and wounding 21 men.

===Service in the Pacific Ocean===

She arrived on 10 February and repairs began when she entered the Captain Cook Dock in the Garden Island Dockyard the next day, well before it was officially opened by the Duke of Gloucester, the Governor-General of Australia on 24 March. By this time the vibration problems with her centre propeller shaft, which had never been properly repaired after she was bombed at Malta, were so bad that the propeller was removed and the shaft locked in place, reducing her maximum speed to 24 knots. On 6 March she sailed to the BPF&#x27;s advance base at Manus Island and, after her arrival a week later, &quot;Illustrious&quot; and her sisters &quot;Indomitable&quot; and &quot;Victorious&quot;, as well as the carrier &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, exercised together before sailing for Ulithi on 18 March. The BPF joined the American Fifth Fleet there two days later, under the designation Task Force 57 (TF 57), to participate in the preliminary operations for the invasion of Okinawa (Operation Iceberg). The British role during the operation was to neutralise airfields on the Sakishima Islands, between Okinawa and Formosa, beginning on 26 March. Her air group now consisted of 36 Corsairs, 16 Avengers and two Supermarine Walrus flying boats for rescue work.

From 26 March to 9 April, the BPF attacked the airfields with each two-day period of flying operations followed by two or three days required to replenish fuel, ammunition and other supplies. While the precise details on activities of the carrier&#x27;s squadrons are not readily available, it is known that the commanding officer of 854 Squadron was forced to ditch his Avenger on the morning of 27 March with the loss of both his crewmen; he was ultimately rescued that evening by an American submarine. On the afternoon of 6 April, four kamikaze aircraft evaded detection and interception by the CAP, and one, a Yokosuka D4Y3 &quot;Judy&quot; dive bomber, attacked &quot;Illustrious&quot; in a steep dive. The light AA guns managed to sever its port wing so that it missed the ship, although its starboard wingtip shattered the Type 272&#x27;s radome mounted on the front of the bridge. When the bomb that it was carrying detonated in the water only from the side of the ship, the resulting shock wave badly damaged two Corsairs parked on the deck and severely shook the ship. The initial damage assessment was that little harm had been done, although vibrations had worsened, but this was incorrect as the damage to the hull structure and plating proved to be extensive. Vice Admiral Sir Bernard Rawlings, commander of Task Force 57, ordered the recently arrived &quot;Formidable&quot; to join the task force to replace &quot;Illustrious&quot; on 8 April. In the meantime, she continued to conduct operations with the rest of the fleet. On 12 and 13 April, the BPF switched targets to airfields in northern Formosa and her sister joined the task force on 14 April. Since the beginning of the operation, her aircraft had flown 234 offensive and 209 defensive sorties, claiming at least two aircraft shot down. Her own losses were two Avengers and three Corsairs lost in action and one Avenger and six Corsairs due to non-combat causes.
&quot;Formidable&quot;″s arrival allowed Rawlings to order &quot;Illustrious&quot; to the advance base in San Pedro Bay, in the Philippines, for a more thorough inspection. She arrived on 16 April and the examination by divers revealed that some of her outer plating was split and that some transverse frames were cracked. The facilities there could provide only emergency repairs, enough to allow her to reach the bigger dockyard in Sydney. Task Force 57 arrived in San Pedro Bay on 23 April for a more thorough replenishment period and &quot;Illustrious&quot; transferred aircraft, spares, stores, and newly arrived pilots to the other carriers before sailing for Sydney on 3 May. She arrived on 14 May and departed 10 days later, bound for Rosyth for permanent repairs. 854 Squadron was disembarked while at Sydney, but the carrier kept her two Corsair squadrons until after arriving in the UK on 27 June.

===Post-war career===
On 31 July Captain W. D. Stephens relieved Lambe. The end of the war several weeks later meant that there was no longer any urgency in refitting the &quot;Illustrious&quot; in time to participate in the invasion of the Japanese Home Islands and the Admiralty decided that she would become the Home Fleet training and trials carrier. Her catapult was upgraded to handle heavier aircraft, her flight deck was further improved, and her radar suite was modernized. She began her post-refit trials on 24 June 1946 and flying trials the following month. She relieved as the trials carrier in August and conducted trials on Firefly FR.4s, Firebrand TF.4s, de Havilland Sea Mosquitoes and de Havilland Sea Vampires over the next several months. Captain Ralph Edwards relieved Stephens on 7 January 1947.
On 1 February, she joined the other ships of the Home Fleet as they rendezvoused with the battleship , which was serving as the royal yacht to escort King George VI as he set out for the first royal tour of South Africa. Over the next several months she conducted deck-landing practice for Avenger and Seafire pilots before starting a short refit on 2 April. After the tour&#x27;s conclusion on 12 May, she sailed for Scottish waters for more deck-landing practice with the destroyer as her planeguard. On 18 July she rendezvoused with the Home Fleet to participate in manoeuvres before George VI reviewed the fleet on 22–23 July. The King and Queen inspected &quot;Illustrious&quot; and her crew, as did Prime Minister Clement Attlee and his wife. Afterwards, she was opened for visits by the public before returning to Portsmouth. En route she served as the centrepiece of a convoy-defence exercise as the RAF successfully &quot;attacked&quot; the convoy. After summer leave for her crew, she resumed deck-landing trials in September and October, including the initial trials of the prototype Supermarine Attacker jet-powered fighter in the latter month. In November the government accelerated the demobilisation of some National Servicemen and almost 2,000 men serving in the Mediterranean became eligible for release. They had to be replaced by men from the UK so &quot;Illustrious&quot; ferried the replacements to Malta, sailing on 21 November and returning on 11 December to Portsmouth.

She was refitted and modernised from January to August 1948. Captain John Hughes-Hallett relieved Edwards on 14 June. The ship was recommissioned in early September. While at anchor in Portland Harbour on 17 October, one of her boats foundered short of the ship in heavy weather; 29 men lost their lives. For his gallantry during a rescue attempt, Boy 1st Class Alf Lowe was awarded the Albert Medal for Lifesaving.

&quot;Illustrious&quot; resumed her duties in early 1949 and conducted trials and training for Avengers, Fireflies, Gloster Meteors, de Havilland Sea Hornets, Vampires and Seafires. On 10 June Hughes-Hallet was relieved by Captain Eric Clifford. During a severe gale in late October, the ship aided the small coastal steamer that had lost power. The weather was too bad for &quot;Illustrious&quot; to rescue the steamer&#x27;s crew, but she pumped fuel oil overboard to flatten the seas until a tug arrived to rescue the ship on 27 October. On 2 May 1950, she arrived at Birkenhead to commemorate the launch of the new carrier the following day with the First Lord of the Admiralty, George Hall, 1st Viscount Hall, aboard. A Hawker Sea Fury crashed while landing on 15 May, killing the pilot and two members of the deck crew. The prototype of the turboprop-powered Fairey Gannet anti-submarine aircraft made its first carrier landing aboard on 16 June. This event was also the first landing of any turboprop aircraft aboard an aircraft carrier.
Captain S. H. Carlill assumed command on 24 June and the &quot;Illustrious&quot; resumed deck-landing training. On 8 and 9 November the Supermarine 510 research aircraft made the first ever landings by a swept-wing aircraft aboard a carrier. This aircraft was one of the ancestors of the Supermarine Swift fighter. A month later the ship began a four-month refit and hosted the first carrier landing of the de Havilland Sea Venom on 9 July 1951. Later in the month she hosted the Sea Furies of 802 and the Fireflies of 814 Squadrons for Exercise Winged Fleet. Captain C. T. Jellicoe relieved Carlill on 27 August and the ship ferried 10 Fireflies of 814 Squadron to Malta beginning on 1 October. She exchanged them for Firebrands for the return voyage. On 3 November she began loading the 39th Infantry Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division in response to the riots in Cyprus that broke out when Egypt abrogated the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936. She set sail two days later and arrived at Famagusta on 11 November. She returned to Portsmouth on 19 November and began loading the 45th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, the 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards, and the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment two days later. &quot;Illustrious&quot; set sail on 23 November and reached Famagusta on 29 November. She returned to Portsmouth on 7 December and she did not leave harbour until 30 January 1952 when she resumed her customary role as a training ship.

After a brief refit in early 1952, she participated in Exercise Castanets off the Scottish coast in June and hosted 22,000 visitors during Navy Days at Devonport Royal Dockyard in August. On 1 September she hosted No. 4 Squadron and No. 860 Squadrons, Royal Netherlands Naval Aviation Service (RNNAS) for training, as well as 824 Squadron. Between the three squadrons they had 20 Fireflies and 8 Sea Furies when they participated in the major NATO exercise Main Brace later in the month. Jellicoe was relieved by Captain R. D. Watson on 26 September and &quot;Illustrious&quot; resumed training until 9 December when her crew was granted leave and the ship began a refit. She next put to sea on 24 April 1953 for trials and did not resume training pilots until the following month. She was reunited with the four other carriers that served with the BPF for the first time since the war for the Coronation Fleet Review of Queen Elizabeth II on 15 June at Spithead. The following day, the Fireflies of No. 4 Squadron, RNNAS and 824 Squadron landed aboard for more deck-landing training. During September she participated in Exercise Mariner with three British squadrons of Fireflies and Sea Furies and a Dutch Squadron of Avengers. The ship resumed flying training off the north coast of Scotland in October for two weeks, but she spent most of the rest of the year on trials of the new mirror-landing system that automated the process of landing aircraft aboard. &quot;Illustrious&quot; began her final maintenance period at Devonport Royal Dockyard on 10 December. Captain K. A. Short relieved Watson on 28 December. The refit was completed by the end of January 1954 and she resumed her normal role. The ship completed 1,051 deck landings and steamed by April. She made her first foreign port visit in many years at Le Havre, France, on 20–22 March, where 13,000 people came aboard. After another round of flying operations, she visited Trondheim, Norway, on 19 June. During 12 days of training in September, she completed 950 daytime and nighttime arrested landings and 210 helicopter landings. She conducted her last landings on 3 December and arrived at Devonport four days later to begin decommissioning. &quot;Illustrious&quot; was paid off at the end of February 1955 and she was towed to Gareloch and placed in reserve. She was sold on 3 November 1956 and broken up in early 1957.

<text>The third HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; of the British Royal Navy was a pre-dreadnought battleship. The ship was built at the Chatham Dockyard; her keel was laid down in March 1895, her completed hull was launched in September 1896, and she was commissioned into the fleet in April 1898. She was armed with a main battery of four guns and a secondary battery of twelve guns. The ship had a top speed of .

&quot;Illustrious&quot; was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet until 1904. Transferred to the Channel Fleet (which was subsequently reorganised to the Atlantic Fleet) she underwent a refit which was duly completed in early 1906. Rendered obsolete by the emergence of the new dreadnoughts, she served with the Home Fleet from 1908. One of the oldest battleships in the Royal Navy when the First World War broke out, she served as a guard ship at various regions around Northern England until late 1915. Her main armament was removed and she then served as a store ship for the remainder of the war. She was decommissioned in 1919 and scrapped the following year.

== Design ==

&quot;Illustrious&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines powered by eight coal-fired, cylindrical fire-tube Scotch marine boilers. By 1907–1908, she was re-boilered with oil-fired models. Her engines provided a top speed of at . The &quot;Majestic&quot;s were considered good seaboats with an easy roll and good steamers, although they suffered from high fuel consumption. She had a crew of 672 officers and ratings.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four BL Mk VIII guns in twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The turrets were placed on circular barbettes, unlike six of her sisters, which retained earlier pear-shaped barbettes. &quot;Illustrious&quot; also carried a secondary battery of twelve QF /40 guns. They were mounted in casemates in two gun decks amidships. She also carried sixteen QF 12-pounder guns and twelve QF 2-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. She was also equipped with five torpedo tubes, four of which were submerged in the ship&#x27;s hull, with the last in a deck-mounted launcher.

&quot;Illustrious&quot; and the other ships of her class had 9 inches (229 mm) of Harvey steel in their belt armour, which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour. This allowed &quot;Illustrious&quot; and her sisters to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss in protection. The barbettes for the main battery were protected with of armour, and the conning tower had the same thickness of steel on the sides. The ship&#x27;s armoured deck was thick.

== Service history ==

The keel for HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; was laid down at the Chatham Dockyard on 11 March 1895 and the ship was launched on 17 September 1896. She commissioned at Chatham for service in the Fleet Reserve on 15 April 1898, Captain Sir Richard Poore in command. She went into full commission there on 10 May 1898 for service in the Mediterranean Fleet.

While in the Mediterranean, &quot;Illustrious&quot; participated between September and December 1898 in the operations at Crete of the International Squadron, a multinational force made up initially of ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, French Navy, Imperial German Navy, Italian Royal Navy (&quot;Regia Marina&quot;), Imperial Russian Navy, and Royal Navy that intervened between February 1897 and December 1898 in the 1897-1898 Greek Christian uprising against the Ottoman Empire′s rule on the island. By the time &quot;Illustrious&quot; joined the squadron, Austria-Hungary and the German Empire had withdrawn from the squadron, but the other four countries remained active in it. Its senior admirals formed an &quot;Admirals Council&quot; that governed Crete during the intervention, and the admirals decided in early September 1898 that the British should take control of the customs house at Candia (now Heraklion) in order to exact an export duty to fund the administration of the island. This resulted in a violent riot by Cretan Turks against British soldiers, sailors, and Christian civilians in Candia on 6 September 1898, which in turn prompted a flood of reinforcements to the town by the International Squadron. &quot;Illustrious&quot; was among the ships that arrived in the harbour in mid-September 1898 to help maintain order in the wake of the riot.

Captain Frank Finnis was appointed in command in February 1900, and in 1901 she underwent a refit at Malta. Captain Francis John Foley was appointed in command on 24 March 1902, and the following June she was the lead ship in a coronation fête at Gibraltar. In July 1904, &quot;Illustrious&quot; transferred to the Channel Fleet. As a result of a reorganisation on 1 January 1905, the Channel Fleet became the Atlantic Fleet, and she became an Atlantic Fleet ship. &quot;Illustrious&quot; ended her Atlantic Fleet service in September 1905 and began a refit at Chatham.

Emerging from the refit, she commissioned into the Reserve at Chatham on 14 March 1906, then went into full commission for service in the new Channel Fleet (formerly the Home Fleet) on 3 April 1906, serving as Flagship, Rear Admiral. She collided with schooner &quot;Christa&quot; in the English Channel in fog on 13 June 1906. She was relieved as flagship and ended her Channel Fleet service on 1 June 1908, paying off at Chatham. &quot;Illustrious&quot; recommissioned at Chatham on 2 June 1908 for service with the Portsmouth Division of the new Home Fleet. On 22 March 1909 she collided with third-class cruiser in Portsmouth Harbour, but suffered no damage. She suffered another mishap on 21 August 1909 when she damaged her bottom by striking a reef in Babbacombe Bay. She underwent a refit in 1912, and later that year was transferred to the 3rd Fleet and participated in manoeuvres as Flagship, Vice Admiral, 7th Battle Squadron.

In late July 1914, the Royal Navy began a precautionary mobilisation, as war seemed imminent. The ships were by then the oldest and least effective battleships in service in the Royal Navy. At first, it was planned that &quot;Illustrious&quot; would pay off to provide crewmen for the new dreadnought battleship , but instead she was placed in full commission to serve as a guard ship for the Grand Fleet once the First World War began in August 1914. She began guard ship duty at Loch Ewe on 23 August 1914, transferring to Loch Na Keal on 17 October 1914, to the Tyne in November 1914, and to Grimsby on the Humber in December 1914. She remained on guard ship duty on the Humber until November 1915.

&quot;Illustrious&quot; paid off at Grimsby on 26 November 1915 to be converted to a disarmed harbour ship; two of her 12-inch (305-mm) guns were re-used in the Tyne Turrets. Her conversion was completed in March 1916. She served at Grimsby in her new role until August 1916, when she transferred to Chatham. &quot;Illustrious&quot; commissioned there on 20 November 1916 for use as a munitions storeship, and on 24 November 1916 she transferred to the Tyne to serve in this role. In November 1917, she transferred to Portsmouth to continue service as a munitions storeship there. &quot;Illustrious&quot; paid off on 21 April 1919 and was placed on the sale list at Portsmouth on 24 March 1920. She was sold for scrapping on 18 June 1920, and was broken up at Barrow.

<text>In mathematics, a modular equation is an algebraic equation satisfied by &quot;moduli&quot;, in the sense of moduli problems. That is, given a number of functions on a moduli space, a modular equation is an equation holding between them, or in other words an identity for moduli.

The most frequent use of the term &quot;modular equation&quot; is in relation to the moduli problem for elliptic curves. In that case the moduli space itself is of dimension one. That implies that any two rational functions &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, in the function field of the modular curve, will satisfy a modular equation &quot;P&quot;(&quot;F&quot;,&quot;G&quot;) = 0 with &quot;P&quot; a non-zero polynomial of two variables over the complex numbers. For suitable non-degenerate choice of &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, the equation &quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;) = 0 will actually define the modular curve.

This can be qualified by saying that &quot;P&quot;, in the worst case, will be of high degree and the plane curve it defines will have singular points; and the coefficients of &quot;P&quot; may be very large numbers. Further, the &#x27;cusps&#x27; of the moduli problem, which are the points of the modular curve not corresponding to honest elliptic curves but degenerate cases, may be difficult to read off from knowledge of &quot;P&quot;.

In that sense a modular equation becomes the equation of a modular curve. Such equations first arose in the theory of multiplication of elliptic functions (geometrically, the &quot;n2&quot;-fold covering map from a 2-torus to itself given by the mapping &quot;x&quot; → &quot;n&quot;·&quot;x&quot; on the underlying group) expressed in terms of complex analysis.

<doc id="439159" wikidata="Q231121" url="?curid=439159" title="Yayoi Kusama">
<text>is a Japanese contemporary artist who works primarily in sculpture and installation, and she is also active in painting, performance, video art, fashion, poetry, fiction, and other arts. Her work is based in conceptual art and shows some attributes of feminism, minimalism, surrealism, , pop art, and abstract expressionism, and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She has been acknowledged as one of the most important living artists to come out of Japan, the world&#x27;s top-selling female artist, and the world&#x27;s most successful living artist. Her work influenced that of her contemporaries, including Andy Warhol and Claes Oldenburg.

Kusama was raised in Matsumoto, and trained at the Kyoto City University of Arts for a year in a traditional Japanese painting style called nihonga. She was inspired by American Abstract impressionism. She moved to New York City in 1958 and was a part of the New York avant-garde scene throughout the 1960s, especially in the pop-art movement. Embracing the rise of the hippie counterculture of the late 1960s, she came to public attention when she organized a series of happenings in which naked participants were painted with brightly coloured polka dots. She experienced a period in the 1970s during which her work was largely forgotten, but a revival of interest in the 1980s brought her art back into public view. Kusama has continued to create art in various museums around the world, from the 1950s through the 2020s.

Kusama has been open about her mental health and has resided since the 1970s in a mental health facility. She says that art has become her way to express her mental problems. &quot;I fight pain, anxiety, and fear every day, and the only method I have found that relieved my illness is to keep creating art&quot;, she told an interviewer in 2012. &quot;I followed the thread of art and somehow discovered a path that would allow me to live.&quot;

== Biography ==

=== Early life: 1929–1949 ===
Yayoi Kusama was born on 22 March 1929 in Matsumoto, Nagano. Born into a family of merchants who owned a plant nursery and seed farm, Kusama began drawing pictures of pumpkins in elementary school and created artwork she saw from hallucinations, works of which would later define her career. Her mother was not supportive of her creative endeavors; Kusama would rush to finish her art because her mother would take it away to discourage her. Her mother was physically abusive, and Kusama remembers her father as &quot;the type who would play around, who would womanize a lot&quot;. The artist says that her mother would often send her to spy on her father&#x27;s extramarital affairs, which instilled within her a lifelong contempt for sexuality, particularly the male&#x27;s lower body and the phallus: &quot;I don&#x27;t like sex. I had an obsession with sex. When I was a child, my father had lovers and I experienced seeing him. My mother sent me to spy on him. I didn&#x27;t want to have sex with anyone for years ... The sexual obsession and fear of sex sit side by side in me.&quot; Her traumatic childhood, including her fantastic visions, can be said to be the origin of her artistic style.

When Kusama was ten years old, she began to experience vivid hallucinations which she has described as &quot;flashes of light, auras, or dense fields of dots&quot;. These hallucinations included flowers that spoke to Kusama, and patterns in fabric that she stared at coming to life, multiplying, and engulfing or expunging her, a process which she has carried into her artistic career and which she calls &quot;self-obliteration&quot;. Kusama&#x27;s art became her escape from her family and her own mind when she began to have hallucinations. She was reportedly fascinated by the smooth white stones covering the bed of the river near her family home, which she cites as another of the seminal influences behind her lasting fixation on dots.

When Kusama was 13, she was sent to work in a military factory where she was tasked with sewing and fabricating parachutes for the Japanese army, then embroiled in World War II. Discussing her time in the factory, she says that she spent her adolescence &quot;in closed darkness&quot; although she could always hear the air-raid alerts going off and see American B-29s flying overhead in broad daylight. Her childhood was greatly influenced by the events of the war, and she claims that it was during this period that she began to value notions of personal and creative freedom. She attended Arigasaki High School.

She went on to study &quot;Nihonga&quot; painting at the Kyoto Municipal School of Arts and Crafts in 1948. Frustrated with this distinctly Japanese style, she became interested in the European and American avant-garde, staging several solo exhibitions of her paintings in Matsumoto and Tokyo in the 1950s.

=== Early success in Japan: 1950–1956 ===
By 1950, she was depicting abstract natural forms in water colour, gouache, and oil paint, primarily on paper. She began covering surfaces—walls, floors, canvases, and later, household objects, and naked assistants—with the polka dots that became a trademark of her work.

The vast fields of polka dots, or &quot;infinity nets&quot;, as she called them, were taken directly from her hallucinations. The earliest recorded work in which she incorporated these dots was a drawing in 1939 at age 10, in which the image of a Japanese woman in a kimono, presumed to be the artist&#x27;s mother, is covered and obliterated by spots. Her first series of large-scale, sometimes more than 30 ft-long canvas paintings, &quot;Infinity Nets&quot;, were entirely covered in a sequence of nets and dots that alluded to hallucinatory visions.

On her 1954 painting &quot;Flower (D.S.P.S)&quot;, Kusama has said:
=== New York City: 1957–1972 ===
After living in Tokyo and France, Kusama left Japan at the age of 27 for the United States. She has stated that she began to consider Japanese society &quot;too small, too servile, too feudalistic, and too scornful of women&quot;. Before leaving Japan for the United States, she destroyed many of her early works. In 1957, she moved to Seattle, where she had an exhibition of paintings at the Zoe Dusanne Gallery. She stayed there for a year before moving on to New York City, following correspondence with Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe in which she professed an interest in joining the limelight of the city, and sought O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s advice. During her time in the US, she quickly established her reputation as a leader in the avant-garde movement and received praise for her work from the anarchist art critic Herbert Read.

In 1961, she moved her studio into the same building as Donald Judd and sculptor Eva Hesse; Hesse became a close friend. In the early 1960s, Kusama began to create so-called soft sculptures by covering items such as ladders, shoes and chairs with white phallic protrusions. Despite the micromanaged intricacy of the drawings, she turned them out fast and in bulk, establishing a rhythm of productivity which she still maintains. She established other habits too, like having herself routinely photographed with new work and regularly appearing in public wearing her signature bob wigs and colorful, avant-garde fashions.

In June 1963, one of Kusama&#x27;s soft sculpture pieces, a couch covered with phallus-like protrusions she had sewn, was exhibited at the Green Gallery. Included in the same exhibition was a papier-mache sculpture by Claes Oldenburg, who had not worked in soft sculpture. Kusama&#x27;s piece received the most attention from attendees and critics, and by September Oldenburg was exhibiting sewn soft sculpture, some pieces of which were very similar to Kusama&#x27;s; Oldenburg&#x27;s wife apologized to Kusama at the exhibit. According to Fordham professor of art Midori Yamamura, Oldenburg likely was inspired by Kusama&#x27;s work to use sewn pieces himself, pieces which made him an &quot;international star&quot;. Kusama became depressed over the incident. A similar incident occurred soon after when Kusama exhibited a boat she had covered in soft sculpture, with photographs of the boat completely covering the walls of the exhibit space, which was very innovative. Andy Warhol remarked on the exhibit, and not long after covered the walls of an exhibit space with photos of a cow, for which he drew significant attention. Kusama became very secretive about her studio work. Helaine Posner, of the Neuberger Museum of Art, said it was likely some combination of racism and sexism that kept Kusama, who was creating work of equal importance to men who were using her ideas and taking the credit for them, from getting the same kinds of backing.

Since 1963, Kusama has continued her series of &quot;Mirror/Infinity&quot; rooms. In these complex infinity mirror installations, purpose-built rooms lined with mirrored glass contain scores of neon-colored balls, hanging at various heights above the viewer. Standing inside on a small platform, an observer sees light repeatedly reflected off the mirrored surfaces to create the illusion of a never-ending space.

During the following years, Kusama was enormously productive, and by 1966, she was experimenting with room-size, freestanding installations that incorporated mirrors, lights, and piped-in music. She counted Judd and Joseph Cornell among her friends and supporters. However, she did not profit financially from her work. Around this time, Kusama was hospitalized regularly from overwork, and O&#x27;Keeffe persuaded her own dealer Edith Herbert to purchase several works to help Kusama stave off financial hardship. She was not able to make the money she believed she deserved, and her frustration became so extreme that she attempted suicide.

In the 1960s, Kusama organized outlandish happenings in conspicuous spots like Central Park and the Brooklyn Bridge, often involving nudity and designed to protest the Vietnam War. In one, she wrote an open letter to Richard Nixon offering to have sex with him if he would stop the Vietnam war. Between 1967 and 1969, she concentrated on performances held with the maximum publicity, usually involving Kusama painting polka dots on her nude performers, as in the &quot;Grand Orgy to Awaken the Dead at the MoMA&quot; (1969), in which performers were instructed embrace each other while engaging the sculptures around them at the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art. During the unannounced event, eight performers under Kusama&#x27;s direction removed their clothing, stepped nude into a fountain, and assumed poses mimicking the nearby sculptures by Picasso, Giacometti, and Maillol.

In 1968, Kusama presided over the happening &quot;Homosexual Wedding&quot; at the Church of Self-obliteration at 33 Walker Street in New York and performed alongside Fleetwood Mac and Country Joe and the Fish at the Fillmore East in New York City. She opened naked painting studios and a gay social club called the &quot;Kusama &#x27;Omophile Kompany (kok)&quot;. The nudity present in Kusama&#x27;s art and art protests was severely shameful for her family; her high school removed her name from its list of alumni. This made her feel alone, and she attempted suicide again.

In 1966, Kusama first participated in the Venice Biennale for its 33rd edition. Her &quot;Narcissus Garden&quot; comprised hundreds of mirrored spheres outdoors in what she called a &quot;kinetic carpet&quot;. As soon as the piece was installed on a lawn outside the Italian pavilion, Kusama, dressed in a golden kimono, began selling each individual sphere for 1,200 lire (US$2), until the Biennale organizers put an end to her enterprise. &quot;Narcissus Garden&quot; was as much about the promotion of the artist through the media as it was an opportunity to offer a critique of the mechanization and commodification of the art market.

During her time in New York, Kusama had a brief relationship with artist Donald Judd. She then began a passionate, platonic relationship with the surrealist artist Joseph Cornell. She was 26 years his junior – they called each other daily, sketched each other, and he would send personalized collages to her. Their lengthy association lasted until his death in 1972.

=== Return to Japan: 1973–1977 ===
In 1973, Kusama returned to Japan. Her reception from the Japanese art world and press was unsympathetic; one art collector recalled considering her a &quot;scandal queen&quot;. She was in ill health, but continued to work, writing shockingly visceral and surrealistic novels, short stories, and poetry.

She became so depressed she was unable to work and made another suicide attempt, then in 1977, found a doctor who was using art therapy to treat mental illness in a hospital setting. She checked herself in and eventually took up permanent residence in the hospital. She has been living at the hospital ever since, by choice. Her studio, where she has continued to produce work since the mid-1970s, is a short distance from the hospital in Tokyo. Kusama is often quoted as saying: &quot;If it were not for art, I would have killed myself a long time ago.&quot;

From this base, she has continued to produce artworks in a variety of media, as well as launching a literary career by publishing several novels, a poetry collection, and an autobiography. Her painting style shifted to high-colored acrylics on canvas, on an amped-up scale.

=== Revival: 1980s–present ===
Kusama&#x27;s move to Japan meant she had to build a new career from scratch.
Her organically abstract paintings of one or two colors (the &quot;Infinity Nets&quot; series), which she began upon arriving in New York, garnered comparisons to the work of Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Barnett Newman. When she left New York she was practically forgotten as an artist until the late 1980s and 1990s, when a number of retrospectives revived international interest. &quot;Yayoi Kusama: A Retrospective&quot; was the first critical survey of Yayoi Kusama presented at the Center for International Contemporary Arts (CICA) in New York in 1989, and was organized by Alexandra Munroe.

Following the success of the Japanese pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1993, a dazzling mirrored room filled with small pumpkin sculptures in which she resided in color-coordinated magician&#x27;s attire, Kusama went on to produce a huge, yellow pumpkin sculpture covered with an optical pattern of black spots. The pumpkin came to represent for her a kind of alter-ego or self-portrait. The 2.5-meter-wide &quot;Pumpkin,&quot; made of fiberglass-reinforced plastic, was installed in 1994 on a pier on Naoshima, Kagawa, becoming iconic as the artist&#x27;s profile grew in the following decades; it was reinstalled in 2022 after being destroyed by a typhoon a year earlier. Kusama&#x27;s later installation &quot;I&#x27;m Here, but Nothing (2000–2008)&quot; is a simply furnished room consisting of table and chairs, place settings and bottles, armchairs and rugs, however its walls are tattooed with hundreds of fluorescent polka dots glowing in the UV light. The result is an endless infinite space where the self and everything in the room is obliterated.


The multi-part floating work &quot;Guidepost to the New Space&quot;, a series of rounded &quot;humps&quot; in fire-engine red with white polka dots, was displayed in Pandanus Lake. Perhaps one of Kusama&#x27;s most notorious works, various versions of &quot;Narcissus Garden&quot; have been presented worldwide venues including Le Consortium, Dijon, 2000; Kunstverein Braunschweig, 2003; as part of the Whitney Biennial in Central Park, New York in 2004; and at the Jardin de Tuileries in Paris, 2010.

Kusama continued to work as an artist in her ninth decade. She has harkened back to earlier work by returning to drawing and painting; her work remained innovative and multi-disciplinary, and a 2012 exhibition displayed multiple acrylic-on-canvas works. Also featured was an exploration of infinite space in her &quot;Infinity Mirror&quot; rooms. These typically involve a cube-shaped room lined in mirrors, with water on the floor and flickering lights; these features suggest a pattern of life and death.

In 2015–2016, the first retrospective exhibition in Scandinavia, curated by Marie Laurberg, travelled to four major museums in the region, opening at Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark and continuing to Henie Onstad Kunstsenter Museum, Norway; Moderna Museet in Sweden, and Helsinki Art Museum in Finland. This major show contained more than 100 objects and large scale mirror room installations. It presented several early works that had not been shown to the public since they were first created, including a presentation of Kusama&#x27;s experimental fashion design from the 1960s.

In 2017, a 50-year retrospective of her work opened at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, DC. The exhibit featured six &quot;Infinity Mirror&quot; rooms, and was scheduled to travel to five museums in the US and Canada.

On 25 February 2017, Kusama&#x27;s &quot;All the Eternal Love I Have for the Pumpkins&quot; exhibit, one of the six components to her &quot;Infinity Mirror&quot; rooms at the Hirshhorn Museum, was temporarily closed for three days following damage to one of the exhibit&#x27;s glowing pumpkin sculptures. The room, which measures and was filled with over 60 pumpkin sculptures, was one of the museum&#x27;s most popular attractions ever. Allison Peck, a spokeswoman for the Hirshhorn, said in an interview that the museum &quot;has never had a show with that kind of visitor demand&quot;, with the room totalling more than 8,000 visitors between its opening and its temporary closure. While there were conflicting media reports about the cost of the damaged sculpture and how exactly it was broken, Allison Peck stated that &quot;there is no intrinsic value to the individual piece. It is a manufactured component to a larger piece.&quot; The exhibit was reconfigured to make up for the missing sculpture, and a new one was to be produced for the exhibit by Kusama. The Infinity Mirrors exhibit became a sensation among art critics as well as on social media. Museum visitors shared 34,000 images of the exhibition to their Instagram accounts, and social media posts using the hashtag #InfiniteKusama garnered 330 million impressions, as reported by the Smithsonian the day after the exhibit&#x27;s closing. The works provided the perfect setting for Instagram-able selfies which inadvertently added to the performative nature of the works.

Later in 2017, the Yayoi Kusama Museum opened in Tokyo, featuring her works.

On 9 November 2019, Kusama&#x27;s Everyday I Pray For Love exhibit was shown at David Zwirner Gallery until 14 December 2019. The exhibition incorporated sculptures and paintings, and included the debut of her &quot;Infinity Mirrored Room – Dancing Lights That Flew Up To The Universe&quot;. The catalogue, published by David Zwirner books, contained texts and poems from the artist.

In January 2020, the Hirshhorn announced it would debut new Kusama acquisitions, including two Infinity Mirror Rooms, at a forthcoming exhibition called &quot;One with Eternity: Yayoi Kusama in the Hirshhorn Collection&quot;. The name of the exhibit is derived from an open letter Kusama wrote to then-President Richard Nixon in 1968, writing: &quot;let’s forget ourselves, dearest Richard, and become one with the absolute, all together in the altogether.&quot;

In November 2021, a monumental exhibition offering an overview of Kusama&#x27;s main creative periods over the past 70 years, with some 200 works and four Infinity Rooms (unique mirror installations) debuted in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. The retrospective spans almost 3,000 m2 across the museum&#x27;s two buildings, in six galleries and includes 2 new works: A Bouquet of Love I Saw in the Universe, 2021 and Light of the Universe Illuminating the Quest for Truth, 2021.

As of late December 2022, the Hong Kong&#x27;s M+ museum has a retrospective on Kusama&#x27;s career entitled &quot;Yayoi Kusama: 1945 to now&quot;. The exhibit, showing until May 2023, is the largest retrospective of her art in Asia, not including her home country.

The Pérez Art Museum Miami has the most recent showing of Kusama&#x27;s work in South Florida. &quot;Yayoi Kusama: LOVE IS CALLING&quot; will be on view and accessible to the public through 2024.

== Meaning and origins of her work ==
Curator Mika Yoshitake has stated that Kusama&#x27;s works on display are meant to immerse the whole person into her accumulations, obsessions, and repetitions. These infinite, repetitive works were originally a way for Kusama to eliminate her intrusive thoughts. Claire Voon has described one of Kusama&#x27;s mirror exhibits as being able to &quot;transport you to quiet cosmos, to a lonely labyrinth of pulsing light, or to what could be the enveloping innards of a leviathan with the measles&quot;.

Creating these feelings amongst audiences was intentional. These experiences seem to be unique to her work because Kusama wanted others to sympathise with her in her troubled life. Bedatri D. Choudhury has described how Kusama feeling not in control throughout her life made her, either consciously or subconsciously, want to control how others perceive time and space when entering her exhibits. Art had become a coping mechanism for Kusama.

In 1962, Kusama created her work, &quot;Accumulation of Stamps, 63&quot;. The medium used are pasted labels and ink on paper with dimensions of 23 3/4 x 29&quot; (60.3 x 73.6 cm). The art was donated by Phillip Johnson to the Department of Drawings and Prints at the Museum of Modern Art. Kusama experienced hallucinations of flowers, dots, and nets during her childhood. These visions engulfed her surroundings, covering everything from ceilings to windows and walls. She saw the same pattern expanding to encompass her body and the entire universe. Kusama&#x27;s struggle with these hallucinations, which were linked to her mental illness, influenced her artistic style. To cope with her condition, Kusama adopted repeated forms in her art, using store-bought labels and stickers. She does not view her art as an end in itself but rather as a means to address her disability that originated in her childhood. The process of repetition, evident in her collages, reflects her artistic approach. Consequently, many of her artworks bear titles that include words like &quot;accumulation&quot; and &quot;infinity&quot;.

Art critic for &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper, Christopher Allen, called Kusama &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most determinedly vacuous artists&quot;.

== Works and publications ==

=== Performance ===
In Kusama&#x27;s &quot;Walking Piece&quot; (1966), a performance that was documented in a series of eighteen color slides, Kusama walked along the streets of New York City in a traditional Japanese kimono while holding a parasol. The kimono suggested traditional roles for women in Japanese custom. The parasol, however, was made to look inauthentic, as it was actually a black umbrella, painted white on the exterior and decorated with fake flowers. Kusama walked down unoccupied streets in an unknown quest. She then turned and cried without reason, and eventually walked away and vanished from view.

This performance, through the association of the kimono, involved the stereotypes that Asian-American women continued to face. However, as an avant-garde artist living in New York, her situation altered the context of the dress, creating a cross-cultural amalgamation. Kusama was able to highlight the stereotype in which her white American audience categorized her, by showing the absurdity of culturally categorizing people in the world&#x27;s largest melting pot.

=== Film ===
In 1968, Kusama and Jud Yalkut&#x27;s collaborative work &quot;Kusama&#x27;s Self-Obliteration&quot; won a prize at the Fourth International Experimental Film Competition in Belgium and the Second Maryland Film Festival and the second prize at the Ann Arbor Film Festival. The 1967 experimental film, which Kusama produced and starred in, depicted Kusama painting polka dots on everything around her including bodies.

In 1991, Kusama starred in the film &quot;Tokyo Decadence&quot;, written and directed by Ryū Murakami, and in 1993, she collaborated with British musician Peter Gabriel on an installation in Yokohama.

=== Fashion ===
In 1968, Kusama established Kusama Fashion Company Ltd, and began selling avant-garde fashion in the &quot;Kusama Corner&quot; at Bloomingdale&#x27;s. In 2009, Kusama designed a handbag-shaped cell phone entitled &quot;Handbag for Space Travel&quot;, &quot;My Doggie Ring-Ring&quot;, a pink dotted phone in accompanying dog-shaped holder, and a red and white dotted phone inside a mirrored, dotted box dubbed &quot;Dots Obsession, Full Happiness With Dots&quot;, for Japanese mobile communication giant KDDI Corporation&#x27;s &quot;iida&quot; brand. Each phone was limited to 1,000 pieces.

In 2011, Kusama created artwork for six limited-edition lipglosses from Lancôme. That same year, she worked with Marc Jacobs (who visited her studio in Japan in 2006) on a line of Louis Vuitton products, including leather goods, ready-to-wear, accessories, shoes, watches, and jewelry. The products became available in 2012 at a SoHo pop-up shop, which was decorated with Kusama&#x27;s trademark tentacle-like protrusions and polka-dots. Eventually, six other pop-up shops were opened around the world. When asked about her collaboration with Marc Jacobs, Kusama replied that &quot;his sincere attitude toward art&quot; is the same as her own. Louis Vuitton created a second set of products in 2023.

=== Writing ===
In 1977, Kusama published a book of poems and paintings entitled &quot;7&quot;. One year later, her first novel &quot;Manhattan Suicide Addict&quot; appeared. Between 1983 and 1990, she finished the novels &quot;The Hustler&#x27;s Grotto of Christopher Street&quot; (1983), &quot;The Burning of St Mark&#x27;s Church&quot; (1985), &quot;Between Heaven and Earth&quot; (1988), &quot;Woodstock Phallus Cutter&quot; (1988), &quot;Aching Chandelier&quot; (1989), &quot;Double Suicide at Sakuragazuka&quot; (1989), and &quot;Angels in Cape Cod&quot; (1990), alongside several issues of the magazine &quot;S&amp;M Sniper&quot; in collaboration with photographer Nobuyoshi Araki. Her most recent writing endeavor includes her autobiography &quot;Infinity Net&quot; published in 2003 that depicts her life from growing up in Japan, her departure to the United States, and her return to her home country, where she now resides. &quot;Infinity Net&quot; includes the artist&#x27;s poetry and photographs of her exhibitions.

In October 2023, Kusama apologized for a number of racist comments against Black people in her writing.

=== Commissions ===
To date, Kusama has completed several major outdoor sculptural commissions, mostly in the form of brightly hued monstrous plants and flowers, for public and private institutions including &quot;Pumpkin&quot; (1994) for the Fukuoka Municipal Museum of Art; &quot;The Visionary Flowers&quot; (2002) for the Matsumoto City Museum of Art; &quot;Tsumari in Bloom&quot; (2003) for Matsudai Station, Niigata; &quot;Tulipes de Shangri-La&quot; (2003) for Euralille in Lille, France; &quot;Red Pumpkin&quot; (2006) for Naoshima Town, Kagawa; &quot;Hello, Anyang with Love&quot; (2007) for Pyeonghwa Park (now referred as World Cup Park), Anyang; and &quot;The Hymn of Life: Tulips&quot; (2007) for the Beverly Gardens Park in Los Angeles. In 1998, she realized a mural for the hallway of the Gare do Oriente subway station in Lisbon. Alongside these monumental works, she has produced smaller scale outdoor pieces including &quot;Key-Chan&quot; and &quot;Ryu-Chan&quot;, a pair of dotted dogs. All the outdoor works are cast in highly durable fiberglass-reinforced plastic, then painted in urethane to glossy perfection.

In 2010, Kusama designed a Town Sneaker styled bus, which she titled &quot;Mizutama Ranbu (Wild Polka Dot Dance)&quot; and whose route travels through her hometown of Matsumoto. In 2011, she was commissioned to design the front cover of millions of pocket London Underground maps; the result is entitled &quot;Polka Dots Festival in London&quot; (2011). Coinciding with an exhibition of the artist&#x27;s work at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2012, a reproduction of Kusama&#x27;s painting &quot;Yellow Trees&quot; (1994) covered a condominium building under construction in New York&#x27;s Meatpacking District. That same year, Kusama conceived her floor installation &quot;Thousands of Eyes&quot; as a commission for the new Queen Elizabeth II Courts of Law, Brisbane.

== Exhibitions ==
In 1959, Kusama had her first solo exhibition in New York at the Brata Gallery, an artist&#x27;s co-op. She showed a series of white net paintings which were enthusiastically reviewed by Donald Judd (both Judd and Frank Stella then acquired paintings from the show). Kusama has since exhibited work with Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, and Jasper Johns, among others. Exhibiting alongside European artists including Lucio Fontana, Pol Bury, Otto Piene, and Günther Uecker, in 1962, she was the only female artist to take part in the widely acclaimed &quot;Nul&quot; (Zero) international group exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam.

== Collections ==
Kusama&#x27;s work is in the collections of museums throughout the world, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Phoenix Art Museum, Phoenix; Tate Modern, London; Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto; Utah Museum of Fine Arts, Salt Lake City, UT; and the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo and in the City Museum of Art in her home town of Matsumoto entitled The Place for My Soul.

== Recognition ==

Kusama&#x27;s image is included in the iconic 1972 poster &quot;Some Living American Women Artists&quot; by Mary Beth Edelson.

In 2017, a fifty-year retrospective of Kusama&#x27;s work opened at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, DC. That same year, the Yayoi Kusama Museum was inaugurated in Tokyo. Other major retrospectives of her work have been held at the Museum of Modern Art (1998), the Whitney Museum (2012), and the Tate Modern (2012). In 2015, the website Artsy named Kusama one of its top 10 living artists of the year.

Kusama has received many awards, including the Asahi Prize (2001); Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (2003); the National Lifetime Achievement Award from the Order of the Rising Sun (2006); and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Women&#x27;s Caucus for Art. In October 2006, Kusama became the first Japanese woman to receive the Praemium Imperiale, one of Japan&#x27;s highest honors for internationally recognized artists. She received the Person of Cultural Merit (2009) and Ango awards (2014). In 2014, Kusama was ranked the most popular artist of the year after a record-breaking number of visitors flooded her Latin American tour, &quot;Yayoi Kusama: Infinite Obsession&quot;. Venues from Buenos Aires to Mexico City received more than 8,500 visitors each day.

Kusama gained media attention for partnering with the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden to make her 2017 &quot;Infinity Mirror&quot; rooms accessible to visitors with disabilities or mobility issues; in a new initiative among art museums, the venue mapped out the six individual rooms and provided disabled individuals visiting the exhibition access to a complete 360-degree virtual reality headset that allowed them to experience every aspect of the rooms, as if they were actually walking through them.

According to Hanna Schouwink of David Zwirner Gallery speaking in 2018, Kusama is &quot;officially the world&#x27;s most successful living artist&quot;. Kusama was recognized as one of the Asia Game Changer awardees in 2023 by Asia Society for her actions that strengthened the bounds between Asia and the world.

== Art market ==
Kusama&#x27;s work has performed strongly at auction: top prices for her work are for paintings from the late 1950s and early 1960s. As of 2012, her work has the highest turnover of any living woman artist. In November 2008, Christie&#x27;s New York sold a 1959 white &quot;Infinity Net&quot; painting formerly owned by Donald Judd, &quot;No. 2&quot;, for US$5.1 million, then a record for a living female artist. In comparison, the highest price for a sculpture from her New York years is £72,500 (US$147,687), fetched by the 1965 wool, pasta, paint and hanger assemblage &quot;Golden Macaroni Jacket&quot; at Sotheby&#x27;s London in October 2007. A 2006 acrylic on fiberglass-reinforced plastic pumpkin earned $264,000, the top price for one of her sculptures, also at Sotheby&#x27;s in 2007. Her &quot;Flame of Life – Dedicated to Tu-Fu (Du-Fu)&quot; sold for US$960,000 at Art Basel/Hong Kong in May 2013, the highest price paid at the show. Kusama became the most expensive living female artist at auction when &quot;White No. 28&quot; (1960) from her signature &quot;Infinity Nets&quot; series sold for $7.1 million at a 2014 Christie&#x27;s auction.

== In popular culture ==
* Superchunk, an American indie band, included a song called &quot;Art Class (Song for Yayoi Kusama)&quot; on its &quot;Here&#x27;s to Shutting Up&quot; album.
* In 1967, Jud Yalkut made a film of Kusama titled &quot;Kusama’s Self-Obliteration&quot;.
* In 2013, the British indie pop duo The Boy Least Likely To made song tribute to Kusama, writing a song specially about her. They wrote on their blog that they admire Kusama&#x27;s work because she puts her fears into it, something that they themselves often do.

<text>Robert Kelly Slater (born February 11, 1972) is an American professional surfer, best known for being crowned World Surf League champion a record 11 times. Slater is widely regarded as the greatest professional surfer of all time, and holds 56 Championship Tour victories. He won the Laureus World Action Sportsperson of the Year four-times (2007, 2009, 2011, 2012). Slater is also the oldest surfer still active on the World Surf League, winning his 8th Billabong Pipeline Masters title at age 49.

== Early years ==
Of Syrian-Irish descent, Slater grew up in Cocoa Beach, Florida, where he still lives. He is the son of Stephen Slater and Judy Moriarity. He has two brothers, Sean and Stephen.

The son of a bait-store proprietor, Slater grew up near the water, and he began surfing at age five. By age 10 he was winning age-division events up and down the Atlantic coast, and in 1984 he won his first age-division United States championship title. Two years later he finished third in the junior division at the world amateur championships in England, and he won the Pacific Cup junior championship in Australia the following year. Kelly attended Cocoa Beach High School.

== Professional career ==
Kelly turned pro in 1990 and qualified for the Bud Pro Tour (The World Surf League&#x27;s qualifying tour at the time). He then immediately won his first contest on the Bud Pro Tour, The Body Glove Surf Bout in Trestles, California. At the end of the year he qualified for the World Surf League Championship Tour for the 1991 season. After qualifying for 1991, Slater struggled during his first year on the Championship Tour and was 43rd out of 44 in the world rankings. In 1992 he secured podium (top 3) finishes in three of his first five events before winning his first professional tour event, the Rip Curl Pro, in France. His win in that year&#x27;s prestigious Pipeline Masters in Hawaii secured his first World Title, and at age 20 he became the youngest surfing world champion ever. Slater finished sixth in the 1993 rankings but came back to win 5 world titles in a row from 1994 to 1998, during which time televised surfing events had become increasingly popular. He then took a break from competitive surfing at the end of 1998, before returning to the world pro tour in 2002.

=== Sponsors and equipment ===

Slater historically and exclusively rode Channel Islands Surfboards equipped with his own signature series of FCS fins. As the media hype grew around Slater&#x27;s lack of board stickers in 2015, Slater had been seen riding unlabelled Firewire surfboards, acquiring the company in 2014. In 2016 Slater released his own line of boards. there are four Slater Designs models in the Firewire range: the Gamma, Cymatic, Omni and Sci-fi.

Since 1990 Slater had been sponsored primarily by surfwear industry giant Quiksilver until his departure on April 1, 2014. After Leaving Quiksilver, Slater, in collaboration with Kering, established the eco-friendly and sustainable apparel company &#x27;Outerknown&#x27;.

== Accomplishments ==
=== Surfing ===
Slater, having grown up in Florida, was never truly comfortable in waves of consequence until a trip to Oahu in 1987. A giant northwest swell was pounding the coast, closing out breaks from Waimea to Sunset. He drove to Makaha, where he was greeted with 40&#x27; (Hawaiian scale) waves breaking across the bay. Slater parked and saw Brandon &quot;Big Wave&quot; Davis waxing up his 11&#x27; board. Big Wave Davis simply gave Slater a wink and they paddled out, trading waves all afternoon. Slater credits Davis in his biography stating &quot;Brandon&#x27;s knowledge and poise in large surf had a huge impact on my career. Anytime I&#x27;m dropping in to a big wave, I think back to that wink in the Makaha parking lot and I push myself over the edge.&quot; Some of his favorite surf spots include Lower Trestles in San Clemente, California, US, Pipeline in Hawaii, Kirra in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, Jeffreys Bay in South Africa, Taghazout in Morocco, Soup Bowls in Barbados, and Sebastian Inlet near his home in Florida.

In 2022, Slater won his eighth Pro Pipeline surfing title at the Pipe Masters in Hawaii, 30 years after his first win. In 2023, he announced his intention to qualify for the 2024 Olympics in Paris.

===Musical appearances and collaborations===
Slater plays guitar and ukulele, and has performed with Jack Johnson and Angus Stone. In the mid 1990s Kelly Slater joined Rob Machado and Peter King in a band called &quot;The Surfers.&quot;The trio released an album in 1998 titled Songs from the Pipe, a reference to the famous surf spot Pipeline on Oahu, Hawaii. Slater toured Australia with his band, performing in venues such as the Opera House and Parliament House.

Slater performed a song with Ben Harper during Harper&#x27;s concert in Santa Barbara on August 1, 2006. He also performed &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; with grunge band Pearl Jam on July 7, 2006, in San Diego.

In 1999, he appeared alongside Garbage singer Shirley Manson in the promotional video for the band&#x27;s single &quot;You Look So Fine&quot;. He played a man washed up on a seashore, then rescued by Manson.

===Mixed media===
Slater played the recurring character Jimmy Slade on seven episodes of the popular TV show &quot;Baywatch&quot; in the early 1990s. He appeared in an episode of the reality show &quot;The Girls Next Door&quot;, and has starred in many surf films during his career.

A video game named &quot;Kelly Slater&#x27;s Pro Surfer&quot; by Treyarch and published by Activision was released in 2002. Slater also appeared as a playable character in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot; prior to this, complete with a surfboard.

In addition to the ASP tour, Slater competed in the X-Games in 2003 and 2004 winning back to back gold medals.

===Environmentalism and philanthropy===
Slater is an advocate of a sustainable and clean living lifestyle. Slater is also a fundraiser and spokesperson for suicide prevention awareness. He has surfed in celebrity events for Surfers Against Suicide, telling sports website &#x27;Athletes Talk&#x27;: &quot;I&#x27;ve lost a couple of friends myself to suicide and it&#x27;s just a horrible thing that can be prevented. People get in this dark place and they don&#x27;t know what to do so it&#x27;s always nice to see a non-profit that isn&#x27;t turning into anything else other than just trying to help people.&quot;

Slater is passionate about preserving oceans globally and protecting temperate reefs in California through his relationship with Reef Check.

In February 2017, Slater and fellow competitive surfer Jérémy Florès called for a daily cull of bull sharks by French authorities on Réunion following eight shark-related fatalities over the preceding six years. Environmentalists criticized the proposal, with Ken Collins of the University of Southampton describing it as &quot;insane&quot;.

On May 8, 2010, the United States House of Representatives honored Slater in H. Res. 792 for his &quot;outstanding and unprecedented achievements in the world of surfing and for being an ambassador of the sport and excellent role model.&quot; This resolution, sponsored by Florida representative Bill Posey and sponsored by 10 representatives, passed without objection by a voice vote.

Slater is on the Board of Advisors (the Ocean Advocacy Advisory Board) of ocean conservation organization Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.

== Other ventures ==

===Outerknown===
In 2014 Kelly Slater ended his 20-year partnership with apparel brand Quiksilver. From there Slater wanted to start a brand founded on the morals instilled in him through surfing, mainly environmentalism and sustainable production practices using recycled materials whenever possible. That brand came to be known as &quot;Outerknown&quot;

===Purps===
In 2014, Slater launched the beverage company Purps in collaboration with RVCA founder Pat Tenore and Dr. Chris Schaumburg. Since 2013, Slater has been a brand ambassador for The Chia Company, based in western Australia.

===Wave Pool===

Wave Pool was a ten-year &#x27;experiment&#x27; to create the perfect inland wave pool situated in inland California. Kelly modeled the wave after a combination of Lower Trestles, California, a tubing wave on Oahu, Hawaii, and a secret right in Micronesia in the Marshall Islands. The project was a success and the surfing world was abuzz with the possibilities, mostly due to the wave&#x27;s perfect shape and speed. In 2016 the World Surf League (WSL) acquired a majority stake in the Kelly Slater Wave Company (KSWC) for an undisclosed sum.

===Kelly Slater Surf Ranch===
The WSL held a test event for professional surfers, including Filipe Toledo, Mick Fanning, Kanoa Igarashi, Gabriel Medina and others, at the Kelly Slater Surf Ranch (located at ) on Tuesday, September 19, 2017. The Surf Ranch also hosted the WSL Founders Cup on May 5–6, 2018. The contest featured five teams – US, Brazil, Australia, Europe and World – made up of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s surfers from the WSL Championship Tour. The WSL Surf Ranch was constructed outside of Lemoore, California and has remained private and exclusive.

===Surf Ranch Florida===
There were previously plans to develop Surf Ranch Florida, a man-made surfing lake in Palm Beach County. County commissioners unanimously approved plans for the county to evaluate the proposed surf facility in 2017. Brian Waxman, project leader for Surf Ranch Florida, said the World Surf League was considering bringing the wave lake to the Sunshine State for its weather and heritage of world-class surfers. It would have encompassed an 80-acre lot east of Jupiter Farms, near the Pine Glades natural area. Despite acquiring the 80-acre property for $6.5 million dollars in November 2017, WSL announced that plans to develop the surf facility at this location were cancelled in 2019 due to &quot;unforeseen challenges&quot; related to an unexpectedly high groundwater table elevation.

===La Quinta, California===
Coral Mountain is a proposed $200-million complex on in La Quinta, California that would include a hotel and housing built around a surfing basin created by Kelly Slater Wave Co.

===Freaks of Nature===
In 2024, Slater founded and launched Freaks of Nature. A skin care company whose main focus is sunscreen. 

==Competitive achievements==
Slater has been crowned World Surf League Champion a record 11 times, including five consecutive titles in 1994–98. He is the youngest (at age 20) and the oldest (at age 39) to win the WSL men&#x27;s title. On winning his fifth world title in 1997, Slater passed Australian surfer Mark Richards to become the most successful male champion in the history of the sport. In 2007 he also became the all-time leader in career event wins by winning the Boost Mobile Pro event at Lower Trestles near San Clemente, California. The previous record was held by Slater&#x27;s childhood hero, three-time world champion Tom Curren. After earlier being awarded the title prematurely as a result of a miscalculation by the Association of Surfing Professionals (ASP), on November 6, 2011, Slater officially won his eleventh ASP world title at the Rip Curl Pro Search San Francisco, by winning his fourth round heat.

In May 2005, in the final heat of the Billabong Tahiti Pro contest at Teahupo&#x27;o, Slater became the first surfer ever to be awarded two perfect scores for a total 20 out of 20 points under the ASP two-wave scoring system (fellow American Shane Beschen made the first perfect score under the previous three-wave system in 1996).

Slater did it again in June 2013 at the quarter finals at the Volcom Fiji Pro with two perfect ten waves, only the fourth person in history to do so.

Slater is also the oldest surfer to perform a ten-point ride in World Surf League competition at the age of 47 at the 2019 Billabong Pipe Masters.

==Personal life==
Slater is an avid golfer and practices the sport of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. His biggest surfing inspiration is 3× WSL champion Tom Curren. Curren was the first American surfer to win a World Title. Kelly got his chance to compete against him when Kelly became a full time tour competitor in 1991. Big wave surfers Todd Chesser and Brock Little were also mentors to him when he was a teenager.

Kelly dated Pamela Anderson for several years in the early 1990s, sometimes not exclusively, meeting her on the set of &quot;Baywatch&quot;. Kelly was also in a relationship with Gisele Bündchen from 2005 to 2006, and Cameron Diaz in 2007.

Slater has a daughter, Taylor (b. 1996), from a previous relationship with Tamara Mitchell.

Kelly&#x27;s long-term girlfriend is Kalani Miller. The couple confirmed they had a baby together prior to him
Surfing in the Fiji Pro in Aug.

She was baptized in the Palace Chapel on 31 March 1932 and her godparents were: her paternal grandparents, King Haakon VII and Queen Maud of Norway; her maternal grandparents, Prince Carl and Princess Ingeborg of Sweden; her maternal aunt, Princess Astrid, Duchess of Brabant; Elizabeth, Duchess of York (later Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother); her grandaunt, Princess Thyra of Denmark; her granduncle, Prince Eugen of Sweden; and Prince George of the United Kingdom. Princess Astrid was named after her maternal aunt, paternal grandmother, and maternal grandmother.

Princess Astrid grew up on the royal estate of Skaugum in Asker and was privately educated during her childhood. During World War II, she joined her family fleeing the Nazis and spent the war with her mother, brother and sister in exile in Washington, DC. Following the royal family&#x27;s return to Norway she attended Nissen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School and graduated with the examen artium university entrance exam in 1950. She then studied economics and political history for two years at Oxford University.

Her Confirmation took place on 9 May 1948 in the Palace Chapel. The princess later learnt other skills including dressmaking and cooking and pursued her interests in handicrafts. Princess Astrid studied ceramics with Halvor Sandøs.

Princess Astrid&#x27;s mother died on 5 April 1954 from cancer at age 53 when Astrid was 22 years old. From her mother&#x27;s death until her brother&#x27;s marriage in August 1968, Princess Astrid was the senior lady of the court and acted as first lady of Norway, working side-by-side with her father on all representation duties, including state visits. In September 1954, she took part in the ship tour organized by Queen Frederica and her husband King Paul of Greece, which became known as the “Cruise of the Kings” and was attended by over 100 royals from all over Europe.

Princess Astrid raised her family in Vinderen; she now lives in Nordmarka, Oslo. Her hobbies include knitting, embroidery, reading and painting porcelain.

In 2002, the Government granted the Princess an honorary pension in recognition of all her efforts on behalf of Norway both during and following her years as first lady. In 2005, she took part in ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, including the unveiling of a plaque marking the Norwegian monarch&#x27;s exile in London.

In February 2012, Princess Astrid celebrated her 80th birthday with a private dinner at the Royal Palace in Oslo.

<doc id="439169" wikidata="Q6299782" url="?curid=439169" title="Maud Angelica Behn">
<text>Maud Angelica Behn (born 29 April 2003) is a member of the Norwegian royal family, however, she is a private citizen and holds no royal title. She is the firstborn child of Princess Märtha Louise of Norway and her late husband Ari Behn, and the eldest grandchild of King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.

Behn came to national attention with the speech she gave at her father&#x27;s funeral, and in 2021 published her first book.

In 2022, she competed in the Norwegian version of &quot;Masked Singer&quot;, &quot;Maskorama&quot;.

==Birth and baptism==
Maud Angelica Behn was born on 29 April 2003 at The National Hospital, a University Hospital in Oslo, Norway, where her mother had also been born. Her great-great-grandmother was Maud of Wales, youngest daughter of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom.

Behn was christened at Slottskapellet, Royal Palace, Oslo, Norway on 2 July 2003, the one-hundredth birthday of her great-grandfather, King Olav V of Norway. Her godparents are her grandfather King Harald V, her uncle Crown Prince Haakon, Princess Alexandra of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, her aunt Anja Sabrina Bjørshol, her mother&#x27;s cousin Marianne Ulrichsen, the actor Kåre Conradi and the politician Trond Giske.

She has two younger sisters, Leah Isadora Behn, born on 8 April 2005, and Emma Tallulah Behn, born on 29 September 2008.

The web site of the Norwegian royal family names the members of the family as King Harald and Queen Sonja, Crown Prince Haakon, Crown Princess Mette-Marit, Princess Ingrid Alexandra, Prince Sverre Magnus, Princess Märtha Louise, her three daughters, and Princess Astrid.

==Succession to the throne==
Maud Angelica Behn is the eldest grandchild of Norway&#x27;s King Harald and Queen Sonja. In 1990, the Norwegian constitution was changed, introducing full cognatic primogeniture to the Norwegian throne, so that the eldest child, regardless of sex, comes first in the line of succession. However, this change was made without displacing Crown Prince Haakon, as it only affects those born after 1989. Controversially, women born between 1971 and 1989 (in practice, only Behn&#x27;s mother Märtha Louise), were given succession rights, but primogeniture would not apply. This was controversial. At present, she is fifth in the line of succession to the Norwegian throne.

==Education==
The Behn family lived in Islington, London, then in New York, and finally in Lommedalen, a valley outside Oslo.

In the autumn of 2009, Maud Angelica Behn was enrolled at the Bærum Waldorf School (&quot;&quot;), an independent Steiner school in Bærum, a suburb west of Oslo.

==Family==
On 5 August 2016, her parents began divorce proceedings, which were finalized in 2017. Ari Behn died by suicide on Christmas Day, 2019, and was buried in Oslo Cathedral.

Behn made a speech at her father&#x27;s funeral and later talked about his death. In an article devoted to the speech, &quot;Aftenposten&quot; commented &quot;It does not get more powerful than this&quot;.

For her public thoughts on mental illness and suicide, she was awarded the Acute Psychiatry Prize for 2020. In October 2021, she published her first book, &quot;Threads of Tears&quot;, her debut as a poet and illustrator, which tells the story of a girl whose life is dark but who learns to weave the threads she cries. 
Ten thousand copies were printed, and on release the book went straight to first place on the Norwegian Booksellers Association bestseller list.

Behn regularly publishes her own drawings on Instagram. In 2021, Princess Märtha Louise stated that she was planning to move to the United States with her daughters when the COVID-19 pandemic was out of the way, but they did not.

<doc id="439171" wikidata="Q143631" url="?curid=439171" title="Bergmann's rule">
<text>Bergmann&#x27;s rule is an ecogeographical rule that states that, within a broadly distributed taxonomic clade, populations and species of larger size are found in colder environments, while populations and species of smaller size are found in warmer regions. The rule derives from the relationship between size in linear dimensions meaning that both height and volume will increase in colder environments. Bergmann&#x27;s rule only describes the overall size of the animals, but does not include body proportions like Allen&#x27;s rule does.

Although originally formulated in relation to species within a genus, it has often been recast in relation to populations within a species. It is also often cast in relation to latitude. It is possible that the rule also applies to some plants, such as &quot;Rapicactus&quot;.

The rule is named after nineteenth century German biologist Carl Bergmann, who described the pattern in 1847, although he was not the first to notice it. Bergmann&#x27;s rule is most often applied to mammals and birds which are endotherms, but some researchers have also found evidence for the rule in studies of ectothermic species, such as the ant &quot;Leptothorax acervorum&quot;. While Bergmann&#x27;s rule appears to hold true for many mammals and birds, there are exceptions.

Larger-bodied animals tend to conform more closely to Bergmann&#x27;s rule than smaller-bodied animals, at least up to certain latitudes. This perhaps reflects a reduced ability to avoid stressful environments, such as by burrowing. In addition to being a general pattern across space, Bergmann&#x27;s rule has been reported in populations over historical and evolutionary time when exposed to varying thermal regimes. In particular, temporary, reversible dwarfing of mammals has been noted during two relatively brief upward excursions in temperature during the Paleogene: the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum and the Eocene Thermal Maximum 2.

==Examples==

===Humans===
Human populations near the poles, including the Inuit, Aleut, and Sami people, are on average heavier than populations from mid-latitudes, consistent with Bergmann&#x27;s rule. They also tend to have shorter limbs and broader trunks, consistent with Allen&#x27;s rule. According to Marshall T. Newman in 1953, Native American populations are generally consistent with Bergmann&#x27;s rule although the cold climate and small body size combination of the Eastern Inuit, Canoe Nation, Yuki people, Andes natives and Harrison Lake Lillooet runs contrary to the expectations of Bergmann&#x27;s rule. Newman contends that Bergmann&#x27;s rule holds for the populations of Eurasia, but it does not hold for those of sub-Saharan Africa.

Human populations also show a decrease in stature with an increase in mean annual temperature. Bergmann&#x27;s rule holds for Africans with the pygmy phenotype and other pygmy peoples. These populations show a shorter stature and smaller body size due to an adaptation to hotter and more humid environments. With elevated environmental humidity, evaporative cooling (sweating) is a less effective way to dissipate body heat, but a higher surface area to volume ratio should provide a slight advantage through passive convective heat loss.
===Birds===
A 2019 study of changes in the morphology of migratory birds used bodies of birds which had collided with buildings in Chicago from 1978 to 2016. The length of birds&#x27; lower leg bones (an indicator of body size) shortened by an average of 2.4% and their wings lengthened by 1.3%. A similar study published in 2021 used measurements of 77 nonmigratory bird species captured live for banding in lowland Amazon rainforest. Between 1979 and 2019, all study species have gotten smaller on average, by up to 2% per decade. The morphological changes are regarded as resulting from global warming, and may demonstrate an example of evolutionary change following Bergmann&#x27;s rule.

===Reptiles===
Bergmann&#x27;s rule has been reported to be vaguely followed by female crocodilians. However, for turtles or lizards the rule&#x27;s validity has not been supported.

===Invertebrates===
Evidence of Bergmann&#x27;s rule has been found in marine copepods.

===Plants===
Bergmann&#x27;s rule cannot generally be applied to plants. Regarding Cactaceae, the case of the saguaro (&quot;Carnegiea gigantea&quot;), once described as &quot;a botanical Bergmann trend&quot;, has instead been shown to depend on rainfall, particularly winter precipitation, and not temperature. Members of the genus &quot;Rapicactus&quot; are larger in cooler environments, as their stem diameter increases with altitude and particularly with latitude. However, since &quot;Rapicactus&quot; grow in a distributional area in which average precipitation tends to diminish at higher latitudes, and their body size is not conditioned by climatic variables, this could suggest a possible Bergmann trend.

==Explanations==
The earliest explanation, given by Bergmann when originally formulating the rule, is that larger animals have a lower surface area to volume ratio than smaller animals, so they radiate less body heat per unit of mass, and therefore stay warmer in cold climates. Warmer climates impose the opposite problem: body heat generated by metabolism needs to be dissipated quickly rather than stored within.

Thus, the higher surface area-to-volume ratio of smaller animals in hot and dry climates facilitates heat loss through the skin and helps cool the body. When analyzing Bergmann&#x27;s Rule in the field, groups of populations being studied are of different thermal environments, and also have been separated long enough to genetically differentiate in response to these thermal conditions. The relationship between stature and mean annual temperature can be explained by modeling any shape that is increasing in any dimension. As you increase the height of a shape, its surface area-to-volume ratio will decrease. Modeling a person&#x27;s trunk and limbs as cylinders shows a 17% decrease in surface area-to-volume ratio from a person who is five feet tall to a person who is six feet tall even at the same body mass index (BMI).

In marine crustaceans, it has been proposed that an increase in size with latitude is observed because decreasing temperature results in increased cell size and increased life span, both of which lead to an increase in maximum body size (continued growth throughout life is characteristic of crustaceans). The size trend has been observed in hyperiid and gammarid amphipods, copepods, stomatopods, mysids, and planktonic euphausiids, both in comparisons of related species as well as within widely distributed species. Deep-sea gigantism is observed in some of the same groups, possibly for the same reasons. An additional factor in aquatic species may be the greater dissolved oxygen concentration at lower temperature. This view is supported by the reduced size of crustaceans in high-altitude lakes. A further possible influence on invertebrates is reduced predation pressure at high latitude. A study of shallow water brachiopods found that predation was reduced in polar areas relative to temperate latitudes (the same trend was not found in deep water, where predation is also reduced, or in comparison of tropical and temperate brachiopods, perhaps because tropical brachiopods have evolved to smaller sizes to successfully evade predation).

== Hesse&#x27;s rule==
In 1937 German zoologist and ecologist Richard Hesse proposed an extension of Bergmann&#x27;s rule. Hesse&#x27;s rule, also known as the heart–weight rule, states that species inhabiting colder climates have a larger heart in relation to body weight than closely related species inhabiting warmer climates.

==Criticism==
In a 1986 study, Valerius Geist claimed Bergmann&#x27;s rule to be false: the correlation with temperature is spurious; instead, Geist found that body size is proportional to the duration of the annual productivity pulse, or food availability per animal during the growing season.

Because many factors can affect body size, there are many critics of Bergmann&#x27;s rule. Some believe that latitude itself is a poor predictor of body mass. Examples of other selective factors that may contribute to body mass changes are the size of food items available, effects of body size on success as a predator, effects of body size on vulnerability to predation, and resource availability. For example, if an organism is adapted to tolerate cold temperatures, it may also tolerate periods of food shortage, due to correlation between cold temperature and food scarcity. A larger organism can rely on its greater fat stores to provide the energy needed for survival as well being able to procreate for longer periods.

Resource availability is a major constraint on the overall success of many organisms. Resource scarcity can limit the total number of organisms in a habitat, and over time can also cause organisms to adapt by becoming smaller in body size. Resource availability thus becomes a modifying restraint on Bergmann&#x27;s Rule.

Some examinations of the fossil record have found contradictions to the rule. For example, during the Pleistocene, hippopotamuses in Europe tended to get smaller during colder and drier intervals. Further, a 2024 study found the size of dinosaurs did not increase at northern Arctic latitudes, and that the rule was &quot;only applicable to a subset of homeothermic animals&quot; with regard to temperature when all other climatic variables are ignored.

<text>The PATCO Speedline, signed in Philadelphia as the Lindenwold Line and also known colloquially as the PATCO High Speed Line, is a rapid transit route operated by the Port Authority Transit Corporation (PATCO), which runs between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Camden County, New Jersey.

The line runs underground in Philadelphia, crosses the Delaware River on the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, runs underground in Camden, then runs above ground to the east end of the line in Lindenwold, New Jersey (with the Haddonfield, New Jersey stop being below street level). The Port Authority Transit Corporation and the Speedline are owned and operated by the Delaware River Port Authority. The line opened between Lindenwold and Camden on January 4, 1969, with the entire line to Philadelphia opening a few weeks later on February 15, 1969.

The PATCO Speedline operates 24 hours a day, one of only a few U.S. mass transit systems to do so. In , the line saw rides, or about per weekday in .

== History ==
=== Philadelphia to Camden ===

The present-day PATCO Speedline follows the route of several historical mainline railroad lines, some dating back to the 19th century. These railroads all terminated in Camden, where passengers could catch ferries across the Delaware River to Philadelphia. Early in the 20th century, the idea of a fixed Delaware River crossing connecting Camden and Philadelphia gained traction. In 1919, Pennsylvania and New Jersey states formed the Delaware River Bridge Joint Commission to build a bridge between the two cities. The Delaware River Bridge, now the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, was designed to accommodate both rail and road traffic. When it opened on July 1, 1926, it had two outboard structures beside the main roadway for rail and space for two streetcar tracks (never installed) on the main road deck. Construction of the rail line did not begin until 1932, and the &quot;Bridge Line&quot; opened on June 7, 1936. Relatively short, it only had four stations: 8th Street and Franklin Square in Philadelphia, and City Hall and Broadway in Camden. Connection was available to the Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines at Broadway.

In Philadelphia, the line joined the 1932-opened Broad-Ridge Spur just west of Franklin Square and shared its 8th Street/Market Street station. An underground tunnel continuing south following 8th Street, then west following Locust Street to 18th Street, had been started in 1917 as part of plans for a Center City subway loop. The shell of this 8th–Locust Street subway was completed, but not outfitted for passenger service, in 1933. Beginning in June 1949, Bridge Line and Ridge Spur services were through-routed, providing one-seat service between Girard station and Camden. Construction on the 8th–Locust Street subway resumed in 1950. Bridge Line service was extended to 15–16th &amp; Locust station, with intermediate stations at 12–13th &amp; Locust station and 9–10th &amp; Locust station, on February 14, 1953. This section is owned by the City of Philadelphia and leased by PATCO.

=== Extension to Lindenwold ===

Despite the extension, Bridge Line ridership was limited by high fares and not extending east of Camden. In January 1954, due to low ridership on the extension, off-peak service and Saturday again began operating between Girard and Camden, with a shuttle train operating between 8th and 16th stations. Sunday service was suspended west of 8th Street at that time due to minimal usage. By 1962, only 1,900 daily passengers boarded the line west of 8th Street.

To facilitate the construction of extensions in Southern New Jersey, the states expanded the powers of the Delaware River Joint Commission (which owned the Benjamin Franklin Bridge and the New Jersey portion of the Bridge Line), rechristening it as the Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA) in 1951. The agency commissioned Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Hall &amp; MacDonald to study possible rapid transit services for South Jersey; Parsons, Brinckerhoff&#x27;s final report recommended building a new tunnel under the Delaware and three lines in New Jersey. Route A would run to Moorestown, Route B to Kirkwood (now Lindenwold), and Route C to Woodbury Heights. A later study by Louis T. Klauder &amp; Associates recommended using the Bridge Line instead to reach Philadelphia and suggested building Route B first, as it had the highest potential ridership.

Over the weekend of August 23 to 27, 1968, the Ridge Spur was connected to a new upper-level terminal platform at 8th Street station to allow conversion of the Bridge Line into the &quot;High-Speed Line&quot;. Bridge Line service was split into 16th Street–8th Street and 8th Street–Camden segments during the conversion, with a cross-platform transfer at 8th Street. Bridge Line service was suspended on December 29, 1968, for final conversion of the line. Service from Lindenwold station to Camden along former Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines trackage began on January 4, 1969; full service into Center City Philadelphia over the bridge began on February 15, 1969. The Lindenwold extension cost $92 million.

An infill park and ride station, Woodcrest, was added on February 1, 1980, along with the PATCO II railcars. Ferry Avenue Local trains were replaced with Woodcrest Local trains on September 20, 1980.

=== Expansion proposals ===

In 2005, PATCO officials began planning a new route in the corridor of the originally proposed Route C that would serve Gloucester County and end in Glassboro on the grounds of Rowan University, formerly Glassboro State College. On May 12, 2009, Jon Corzine, the Governor of New Jersey, formally endorsed a diesel light rail along an existing Conrail right-of-way, which was selected because of its lower capital cost and operating cost. The proposed Glassboro–Camden Line would require riders to transfer to the Speedline at the Walter Rand Transportation Center for trips to Philadelphia.

The 1936 Franklin Square station, closed since 1979, is scheduled to reopen in 2025. The project is budgeted at $29.3 million with construction expected to begin in 2021. The station will be updated to modern standards and accessibility with a surface structure planned at Franklin Square.

In 2021, the City of Philadelphia proposed a westward PATCO expansion to the rapidly-growing University City district via a new rail tunnel under the Schuylkill River. The 40th Street Trolley Portal was identified as a possible terminus, near the University of Pennsylvania and several major hospitals. A connection at Penn Medicine station would provide direct SEPTA Regional Rail transfers with the Media/Wawa Line to Delaware County, the Wilmington/Newark Line to the state of Delaware, and the Airport Line to Philadelphia International Airport. Next steps include a feasibility study and cost estimate.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
The line began operating limited service on March 28, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with trains bypassing , , , and stations. Westbound express service was also suspended. The four stations reopened on September 14, 2020, but express service remained suspended.

== Rolling stock ==

PATCO originally operated 121 cars which were acquired in two separate orders, labeled PATCO I and PATCO II. The original PATCO I cars were designed and manufactured by Budd of Philadelphia in 1968. Cars numbered 101-125 were single units, and cars numbered 201-250 were in permanently coupled married pairs. The PATCO II cars were delivered in 1980 (in parallel with the opening of the Woodcrest Park and ride facility) and consisted of married pairs numbered 251-296. The PATCO II cars were manufactured by Vickers Canada under a license from Budd, but are nearly indistinguishable from the PATCO I&#x27;s, the only differences being that the PATCO II cars had a fixed partition behind the operator&#x27;s booth and lack a stainless steel shroud below the door line to ease access to traction components.

The single units differed from the married pairs by having an extra single leaf door behind each operator&#x27;s booth. This was installed before the fare collection system was finalized and there was a possibility of operators collecting fares on board during the late night hours.

=== Mechanical features ===
The PATCO I cars were originally fitted with WABCO Model N-2 MU couplers. Because of reliability issues, these were replaced by Tomlinson type couplers manufactured by Ohio Brass Company. The original electrical system in the PATCO I cars was found to have certain reliability issues and was completely rebuilt to the PATCO II standard after the PATCO II cars arrived.

As built, the PATCO cars used camshaft resistance type motor controllers common to DC powered rapid transit vehicles up through the 1980s. The unique whine of the motors and gear assemblies can lead many to mistake the cars for using thyristor drive or even a variable-frequency drive, but this is not the case. Bogies are of the Budd designed Pioneer III variety and while lightweight, provide for a very bouncy ride. The married cars shared a single motor control unit and automatic operation box. Many PATCO Car design features also appeared in the M1/M3 class of MU railcars for the Long Island Rail Road which provides for a similar riding experience.

=== Cabin ===

PATCO maintained the same interior styling in its vehicles from their introduction in 1969 through the end of the rebuilding process in 2018, with the 1980 PATCO II cars receiving the same look. The color combination was a base of cream with an avocado green fill. The rebuild replaced this with a grey and white interior with brighter fluorescent lighting. Seating is a 2+2 arrangement, with half of the seats in each car facing the direction of travel, and half facing the opposite direction. Seats originally ran the full length of the car, with the front seats next to the operator&#x27;s booth having the benefit of a large picture window. However, the newly refurbished cars now have full-width operator&#x27;s cabs, resulting in the loss of four passenger seats, in addition to a number of folding longitudinal seats for ADA compliance.

Each PATCO car has a pair of doors on each side with a foyer area inside the doors for standing passengers. There are also hand-holds on all seatbacks for standing passengers at the entire length of the aisles. Car end-doors are unlocked, but inter-car movement is discouraged because of the extreme motions between cars. Interior cabs are halved to free up the space for passengers, however, both cabs at the front and rear of any train are left in their full width configuration.

==== Refurbishment ====

PATCO announced plans to refurbish the entire fleet with work expected to begin in 2009. The contract for rebuilding the rolling stock was awarded to Alstom, at a cost of $194.2 million, beating Bombardier&#x27;s bid by $35 million, though Bombardier claimed the contract was incorrectly awarded. PATCO began to ship the railcars with their trucks removed and replaced with highway tires for the road trip to the Alstom facility in Hornell, New York, in March 2011.

The refurbishment consisted of a completely new interior with more modern colors, wheelchair access, and more reliable HVAC systems. The rollsigns were replaced with digital displays, and the cars received automated announcement systems, with announcements recorded by Bernie Wagenblast. These changes reduced seating by eight seats, from 160 to 152. The refurbishment also saw the replacement of the propulsion and automatic train operation systems, which used technology last updated in the early 1980s; the camshaft resistance type motor controller was replaced by a new solid state unit using IGBTs and the relay based ATO unit was replaced by a computerized system. The General Electric DC motors, Pioneer III trucks and gearboxes were not replaced, but rebuilt by Alstom as well. Also, Alstom purchased many extra GE 1255 A2 motors from retired Metro-North Railroad M-1A&#x27;s from a scrap dealer in Ohio, and rebuilt them to provide PATCO with extra DC motors for future replacement if needed, or required.

The first rebuilt cars were redelivered to PATCO&#x27;s Lindenwold, New Jersey Shops on November 12, 2013, and were tested accordingly before going into service. Rebuilt cars are being renumbered into the 1000 series instead of their former numbers. The former single unit cars were converted into married-pair type cars with the single-leaf door behind the train operator&#x27;s position removed and sealed-off. The rebuilding is expected to extend the lives of these cars by 20 years. After over a year and a half of testing, the first four rebuilt cars were placed in revenue service on May 28, 2015. Alstom proceeded with the rebuilding of the remaining fleet of cars at a production and delivery rate of 4 to 6 cars per month until all cars went through the rebuilding process.

The final run of the non-refurbished &quot;legacy&quot; trains took place on June 10, 2018, with a special day of &quot;last rides&quot; and a contest held for a rider to sit in the front row seat for the last ride. , the refurbishment work has been completed with a total of 120 of the previous 121 cars accepted back into service. The remaining single unit #116 was excluded from the rebuilding program due to having been damaged beyond repair by an arson fire in 1997 and subsequently used as a source of spare parts.

== Operation ==

PATCO was one of the first transit systems to incorporate automatic train operation (ATO) for regular service. The PATCO ATO is an analog system that makes use of pulse code cab signaling supplied by Union Switch &amp; Signal. The cab signals supply one of five different speeds (, , , or full stop) and the on-board ATO gear will supply maximum acceleration or maximum braking force to reach that target speed. Track mounted transponders handle automatic station stops and can be overridden by the operator for non-stopping trains.

The system has problems handling slippery track conditions, and human operators are required to take control in any sort of precipitation. Because of the ATO limitations, drivers must make one trip per day under manual operation to stay in practice and are not penalized for running their trains manually at any time of their choosing. In practice, most operators prefer automatic operation because it is less effort and tends to result in faster trips.

The system was designed for one-person operation by exclusively utilizing island platforms and right-handed operation with operators sitting on the left side of the vehicle where they can open their window and monitor the boarding process. Where trains have to use the &quot;wrong&quot; side, mirrors are provided to give the operator a proper view. Before the rebuild, the operator was not isolated from the passenger cabin, instead surrounded by a low partition. all of the legacy vehicles have been rebuilt with modern controls and full width cabs. Operators are still responsible for opening and closing the doors, sounding the horn, starting the train from station stops and manually operating the train when necessary. The rebuild also replaced the manual announcements with automated announcements.

Trains operate at a maximum of on the surface portion of the system, over the bridge, and in the subway portion. Trains used to have a top speed of on the surface portion, but this caused excessive wear on the traction motors and was cut back to in the 1970s.

=== Train lengths ===

PATCO runs the majority of its trains in 2-, 4- or 6-car configurations. Before the Alstom rebuild, single-unit trains were occasionally seen late at night, while 3- or 5-car trains were encountered only when not enough cars are available to meet the service requirement. All stations are capable of handling 7- or 8-car trains, but these lengths have never been run except for brief testing and for the annual holiday &quot;Santa Train&quot; special for children. In its first several decades, PATCO actively managed consist length based on ridership levels as opposed to running trains in fixed sets, with single car trains making the occasional appearance overnight before eliminating single cars as part of the rebuild. Due to recent capital improvements, weekend and mid-day headways have grown, prompting PATCO to run 4 or 6 car trains during most off peak times, albeit less frequently than the 2-car trains and social distancing requirements of the COVID 19 pandemic further increased the use of 6-car trainsets during off-peak times.

Since December 2019 4-car (doors not open on the first and last cars) late night trains operate every 60 minutes instead of the previous schedule of every 45 minutes with a PATCO police officer reported to be onboard all trains from 12 a.m. to 4 a.m. on weekdays and from 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. on weekends. City Hall station in Camden and 9/10th &amp; Locust station in Philadelphia are closed overnight due to low ridership.

=== Signaling ===
PATCO trains are governed by a Pulse code cab signaling system which transmits signal codes to the trains via the running rails. Wayside signals are located only at interlockings. Even when the Automatic Train Operation System is not in use, the cab signal speed control function is still enabled and if an operator goes above the permitted speed, the power is cut and the brakes are applied until the speed is back within the limit. The entire PATCO system is run from Center Tower, centrally located above a substation near the Broadway station in Camden.

=== Power ===
All PATCO trains are electrically powered. Power comes from a top contact covered third rail at 750 V DC. There are two feeds from the commercial power grid, one located in Philadelphia from PECO Energy for the old Bridge Line tunnel segments and the other in New Jersey from PSE&amp;G for the new mainline segments. In New Jersey power is distributed via wayside AC transmission lines in the 26.4 kV range and a series of 7 substations, located approximately every .

== Fare collection ==
PATCO was one of the first transit systems to employ automated fare collection and tickets with magnetically stored data. It currently uses two types of farecards: reusable contactless smart cards for frequent riders, known as a Freedom Card, and magnetic stripe paper cards, valid for three days. PATCO has five different fare zones, and one must retain one&#x27;s ticket (or card) to exit the station in the proper zone. There is no discount for using the stored value Freedom Card or multi-ride paper tickets. There are also no unlimited ride pass options, however, a reduced fare Freedom Card is available for senior citizens and disabled riders.

=== Magnetic back tickets (1969–2006) ===
At the start of service in 1969, PATCO used a system of plastic tickets with an oxide layer on the entire back side for the magnetic encoding of data. Tickets were pre-encoded with a number of rides and a destination zone and sold from ticket vending machines in each station. These machines only accepted coins so bill changers were placed in stations to support paper currency. Each ticket vending machine could sell two types of tickets, which the rider chose by pushing a button after inserting the correct fare. Because the system has multiple fare zones, several machines were needed in each station. Stations in New Jersey had machines selling one-way or round-trip tickets to Philadelphia and machines selling tickets to other stations in New Jersey. Ticket machines in Philadelphia would sell single ride tickets to each of the four New Jersey fare zones, with the Camden zone tickets also used for intra-Philadelphia travel. Used tickets with no remaining rides were retained by the faregates, re-encoded at a PATCO facility, and returned for use in the vending machine. Ten-trip tickets could also be purchased through mail order or from ticket windows at select suburban stations.

At its inception, this system was state-of-the-art, but became increasingly problematic as it aged. Tickets were vulnerable to damage from magnetic sources, and the equipment needed to read and code the farecards began to suffer from reliability problems, with little replacement part availability. More importantly, the fare system could not accept payment cards and the reliance on change machines created an extra step for those needing to pay with paper currency.

=== Smart cards (2006–present) ===

In July 2006, PATCO announced that it would start the transition from a magnetic ticket fare system to a contactless smart card system designed, built and integrated by Cubic Corporation, the firm responsible for the 1969 magnetic card system. Magnetic tickets are still sold, however, they are now in the form of disposable paper magnetic stripe cards that expire after 3 days. The new computer vending machines support payment cards. Additional ticket vending machines were installed at each station inside of fare control so that if a rider has purchased the wrong fare, they may pay the remaining fare to exit.

== Connections to other transit systems ==
=== New Jersey Transit connections ===

NJ Transit buses connect to most PATCO stations in New Jersey. The New Jersey Transit Atlantic City Line also stops at Lindenwold Station, and the River Line connects at Broadway Station (Walter Rand Transportation Center).

=== SEPTA connections ===

The SEPTA Market–Frankford Line connects to PATCO at the 8th &amp; Market Station, which is two blocks away from SEPTA&#x27;s Jefferson Station, where all but one of SEPTA&#x27;s Regional Rail trains stop.

SEPTA&#x27;s Broad Street Line connects to PATCO at the Walnut–Locust station via a short underground walkway to PATCO&#x27;s 12th-13th &amp; Locust, and 15-16th &amp; Locust stations. The Broad-Ridge Spur connects to PATCO at the 8th &amp; Market Station via a pedestrian walkway.

Formerly, a special &quot;SEPTA Transfer&quot; ticket could be purchased from the unpaid side of any New Jersey station. These tickets were sold for $3.50 ($1.75 per ride, a savings compared to a single $2.25 cash fare or a token for $2.00) and dispensed two paper receipts, one good for a ride within one hour of the time of purchase and another good for a ride within 24 hours of the time of purchase. Originally, both transfers were going to be valid for 24 hours, however, PATCO changed the time limit to prevent the unauthorized sale of PATCO transfers at Pennsylvania stations.

With the release of SEPTA Key, a new type of Freedom card is now required to purchase a transfer to the SEPTA system. With this system, the cost of a transfer is $2, and it is debited directly from an account-based Freedom Card account, provided a new Freedom Share card is used, which is compatible with both PATCO Freedom and SEPTA Key card systems.

<text>Henri Maillardet (born &quot;Jean Henri Nicholas Maillardet&quot;; 1745–1830), was a Swiss mechanician of the 18th century who worked in London producing clocks and other mechanisms. He spent a period of time in the shops of Pierre Jaquet-Droz, who was in the business of producing watches, clocks, and automata.

With his brothers Jaques-Rodolphe and Jean David Maillardet, Henri produced a series of automata depicting magicians.

In 1805 Henri Maillardet built a spring-activated automaton that draws pictures and writes verses in both French and English. The motions of the hand are produced by a series of cams located on shafts in the base of the automaton, which produces the necessary movement to complete seven sketches and the text. It is believed that this automaton has the largest cam-based memory of any automaton of the era.

When first presented to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia in 1928, the automaton was of unknown origin. Once restored to working order, the automaton itself provided the answer when it penned the words &quot;written by the automaton of Maillardet&quot;.

Maillardet died in Malines, Belgium, in 1830 where he is buried.

<text>The Laptev Sea () is a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean. It is located between the northern coast of Siberia, the Taimyr Peninsula, Severnaya Zemlya and the New Siberian Islands. Its northern boundary passes from the Arctic Cape to a point with co-ordinates of 79°N and 139°E, and ends at the Anisiy Cape. The Kara Sea lies to the west, the East Siberian Sea to the east.

The sea is named after the Russian explorers Dmitry Laptev and Khariton Laptev; formerly, it had been known under various names, the last being Nordenskiöld Sea (), after explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld. The sea has a severe climate with temperatures below 0 °C (32 °F) over more than nine months per year, low water salinity, scarcity of flora, fauna and human population, and low depths (mostly less than 50 meters). It is frozen most of the time, though generally clear in August and September.

The sea shores were inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous tribes of Yukaghirs and then Evens and Evenks, which were engaged in fishing, hunting and reindeer husbandry. They were then settled by Yakuts and later by Russians. Russian explorations of the area started in the 17th century. They came from the south via several large rivers which empty into the sea, such as the prominent Lena River, the Khatanga, the Anabar, the Olenyok, the Omoloy and the Yana. The sea contains several dozen islands, many of which contain well-preserved mammoth remains.

==Extent==

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Laptev Sea as follows:
On the West The eastern limit of Kara Sea&lt;br&gt;Komsomolets Island from Cape Molotov to South Eastern Cape; thence to Cape Vorochilov, Oktiabrskaya Revolutziya Island to Cape Anuchin. Then to Cape Unslicht on Bolshevik Island. Bolshevik Island to Cape Yevgenov. Thence to Cape Pronchisthehev on the main land (see Russian chart No. 1484 of the year 1935).

On the North A line joining Cape Molotov to the Northern extremity of Kotelni Island ().

On the East From the Northern extremity of Kotelni Island – through Kotelni Island to Cape Madvejyi. Then through Malyi Island [Little Lyakhovsky Island], to Cape Vaguin on Great Liakhov Island. Thence to Cape Sviatoy Nos on the main land.
Using current geographic names and transcription this definition corresponds to the area shown in the map.

# The sea&#x27;s border starts at Arctic Cape (formerly Cape Molotov) on Komsomolets Island at and connects to Cape Rosa Luxemburg &quot;(Mys Rozy Lyuksemburg)&quot;, the southeastern cape of the island.
# The next segment crosses Red Army Strait and leads to Cape Vorochilov on October Revolution Island and afterwards through that island to Cape Anuchin at .
# Next, the border crosses Shokalsky Strait to Cape Unslicht at on Bolshevik Island. It goes further through the island to Cape Yevgenov at .
# From there, the border goes through Vilkitsky Strait to Cape Pronchishchev at on the Tamyr peninsula.
# The southern boundary is the shore of the Asian mainland. Prominent features are the Khatanga Gulf (estuary of the Khatanga River) and the delta of the Lena River.
# In the east, the polygon crosses the Dmitry Laptev Strait. It connects Cape Svyatoy Nos at with Cape Vagin at in the very east of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island.
# Next, the Laptev Sea border crosses the Eterikan Strait to Little Lyakhovsky Island (aka Malyi Island) at up to Cape Medvezhiy.

# The last link reaches from there back to Arctic Cape.

==Geography==

The Lena River, with its large delta, is the biggest river flowing into the Laptev Sea, and is the second largest river in the Russian Arctic after Yenisei. Other important rivers include the Khatanga, the Anabar, the Olenyok or Olenek, the Omoloy and the Yana.

The sea shores are winding and form gulfs and bays of various sizes. The coastal landscape is also diverse, with small mountains near the sea in places. The main gulfs of the Laptev Sea coast are the Khatanga Gulf, the Olenyok Gulf, the Buor-Khaya Gulf and the Yana Bay.

There are several dozens of islands with the total area of , mostly in the western part of the sea and in the river deltas. Storms and currents due to the ice thawing significantly erode the islands, so the Semenovsky and Vasilievsky islands (74°12&quot;N, 133°E) which were discovered in 1815 have already disappeared. The most significant groups of islands are Severnaya Zemlya, Komsomolskaya Pravda, Vilkitsky and Faddey, and the largest individual islands are Bolshoy Begichev (1764 km2), Belkovsky (500 km2), Maly Taymyr (250 km2), Stolbovoy (170 km2), Starokadomsky (110 km2), and Peschanyy (17 km2). (see Islands of the Laptev Sea)

More than half of the sea (53%) rests on a continental shelf with the average depths below , and the areas south from 76°N are shallower than 25 m. In the northern part, the sea bottom sharply drops to the ocean floor with the depth of the order of (22% of the sea area). There it is covered with silt, which is mixed with ice in the shallow areas.

The Laptev Sea is bound to the south by the East Siberian Lowland, an alluvial plain mainly composed of sediments of marine origin dating back to the time when the whole area was occupied by the Verkhoyansk Sea, an ancient sea at the edge of the Siberian Craton in the Permian period. As centuries went by, gradually, most of the area limiting the sea to the south became filled with the alluvial deposits of modern rivers.

==Climate==
The climate of the Laptev Sea is Arctic continental and, owing to the remoteness from both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, is one of the most severe among the Arctic seas. Polar night and midnight sun last about three months per year on the south and five months on the north. Air temperatures stay below 0 °С 11 months a year on the north and nine months on the south. The average temperature in January (coldest month) varies across the sea between and and the minimum is . In July, the temperature rises to 0 °С (maximum 4 °С) in the north and to 5 °С (maximum 10 °С) in the south, however, it may reach 22–24 °С on the coast in August. The maximum of was recorded in Tiksi. Strong winds, blizzards and snow storms are common in winter. Snow falls even in summer and is alternating with fogs.

The winds blow from south and south-west in winter with the average speed of 8 m/s which subsides toward the spring. In summer, they change direction to the northerly, and their speed is 3–4 m/s. Relatively weak winds result in low convection in the surface waters, which occurs only to the depth of 5–10 meters.

==Ice==

The Laptev Sea is a major source of arctic sea ice. With an average outflow of 483,000 km2 per year over the period 1979–1995, it contributes more sea ice than the Barents Sea, Kara Sea, East Siberian Sea and Chukchi Sea combined. Over this period, the annual outflow fluctuated between 251,000 km2 in 1984–85 and 732,000 km2 in 1988–89. The sea exports substantial amounts of sea ice in all months but July, August and September.

Usually, ice formation starts in September on the north and October on the south, though it has progressively begun later because of human-driven climate change. In 2020 Siberia experienced record-breaking heat and formation did not begin until late October, marking the latest start ever recorded. The ice formation results in a large continuous sheet of ice, with the thickness up to in the south-eastern part of the sea as well as near the coast. The coastal sheet ends at the water depth of 20–25 m which occurs at several hundred kilometers from the shore, thus this coastal ice covers some 30% of the sea area. Ice is drifting north to this coastal band, and several polynyas are formed by the warm south winds around there. They have various names, such as the Great Siberian Polynya, and can stretch over many hundreds kilometers. The ice sheet usually starts melting from late May to early June, creating fragmented ice agglomerates on the north-west and south-east and often revealing remains of the mammoths. The ice formation varies from year to year, with the sea either clear or completely covered with ice.

==Hydrology==
The sea is characterized by the low water temperatures, which ranges from in the north to in the south-eastern parts. The medium water layer is warmer, up to 1.5 °С because it is fed by the warm Atlantic waters. It takes them 2.5–3 years to reach the Laptev Sea from their formation near Spitsbergen. The deeper layer is colder at about −0.8 °С. In summer, the surface layer in the ice-free zones warms up by the sun up to 8–10 °С in the bays and 2–3 °С in the open sea, and remains close to 0 °С under ice. The water salinity is significantly affected by the thawing of ice and river runoff. The latter amounts to about 730 km3 and would form a 135 cm freshwater layer over the entire sea; it is the second largest in the world after the Kara Sea. The salinity values vary in winter from 20 to 25‰ (parts per thousand) in the south-east to 34‰ in the northern parts of the sea; it decreases in summer to 5–10‰ and 30–32‰ respectively.

Most of the river runoff (about 70% or 515 km3/year) is contributed by the Lena River. Other major contributions are from Khatanga (more than 100 km3), Olenyok (35 km3), Yana (greater than 30 km3) and Anabar (20 km3), with other rivers contributing about 20 km3. Owing to the ice melting season, about 90% of the annual runoff occurs between June and September with 35–40% in August alone, whereas January contributes only 5%.

Sea currents form a cyclone consisting of the southward stream near Severnaya Zemlya which reaches the continental coast and flows along it from west to east. It is then amplified by the Lena River flow and diverts to the north and north-west toward the Arctic Ocean. A small part of the cyclone leaks through the Sannikov Strait to the East Siberian Sea. The cyclone has a speed of 2 cm/s which decreases toward the center. The center of the cyclone drifts with time that slightly alters the flow character.

The tides are mostly semi-diurnal (rise twice a day), with the average amplitude of . In the Khatanga Gulf it may reach 2 m because of the funnel-like shape of the gulf. This tidal wave is then noticeable up to the unusually long distance of 500 km up to the Khatanga River – the tidal wave is damped at much shorter distance in other rivers of the Laptev Sea.

The seasonal variations of the sea level are relatively small – the sea level rises up to in summer near the river deltas and lowers in winter. Wind-induced changes are observed all through the year, but are more frequent in autumn when the winds are strong and steady. In general, the sea level rises with northern and lowers with southern winds, but depending on the area, the maximum amplitude is observed for a specific wind direction (e.g. western and north-western in the south-eastern part of the sea). They average amplitudes are 1–2 m and may exceed near Tiksi.

Owing to the weak winds and shallow waters, the sea is relatively calm with the waves typically within . In July–August waves up to 4–5 m are observed near the sea center, and they may reach in autumn.

==History and exploration==
The coast of the Laptev Sea was inhabited for ages by the native peoples of northern Siberia such as Yukaghirs and Chuvans (sub-tribe of Yukaghirs). Those tribes were engaged in fishing, hunting and reindeer husbandry, as reindeer sleds were essential for transportation and hunting. They were joined and absorbed by Evens and Evenks around the 2nd century and later, between 9th and 15th centuries, by much more numerous Yakuts. All those tribes moved north from the Baikal Lake area avoiding confrontations with Mongols. Whereas they all practiced shamanism, they spoke different languages.

Russians started exploring the Laptev Sea coast and the nearby islands some time in the 17th century, going through the rivers emptying into the sea. Many early explorations were likely unreported, as indicated by graves found on some of the islands by their official discoverers. In 1629, Siberian Cossacks went through the Lena River and reached its delta. They left a note that the river flows into a sea. In 1633, another group reached the delta of Olenyok.

By 1712, Yakov Permyakov and Merkury Vagin explored the eastern part of the Laptev Sea and discovered Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island. However, they were killed on the way back from their expedition by mutineering team members. In 1770, the merchant Ivan Lyakhov revisited the islands and then asked the government for permission to commercially develop their ivory resources. Catherine II granted permission and named the islands after Lyakhov. While exploring the area in the 1770s, Lyakhov described several other islands, including Kotelny, which he named so after a large kettle ( – kotel) left there by previous visitors. He also established first permanent settlements on those islands.

In 1735, Russian explorer of Siberia Vasili Pronchishchev sailed from Yakutsk down the Lena River on his sloop &quot;Yakutsk&quot;. He explored the eastern coast of the Lena delta, and stopped to winter at the mouth of the Olenyok River. Unfortunately many members of his crew fell ill and died, mainly from scurvy. Despite these difficulties, in 1736, he reached the eastern shore of the Taymyr Peninsula and went north surveying its coastline. Pronchishchev and his wife succumbed to scurvy and died on the way back. Maria Pronchishcheva Bay in the Laptev Sea is named after the wife of Pronchishchev.

During the 1739–1742 Great Northern Expedition, Russian Arctic explorer and Vice Admiral Dmitry Laptev described the sea coastline from the mouth of the Lena River, along the Buor-Khaya and Yana gulfs, to the strait that bears his name, Dmitry Laptev Strait. As part of the same expedition, Dmitry&#x27;s cousin Khariton Laptev&#x27;s led a party that surveyed the coast of the Taimyr Peninsula starting from the mouth of the Khatanga River.
Detailed mapping of the coast of the Laptev Sea and New Siberian Islands was performed by Pyotr Anjou, who in 1821–1823 traveled some over the region on sledges and small boats, searching for the Sannikov Land and demonstrating that large-scale coastal observations can be performed without ships. Anzhu Islands (the northern part of New Siberian Islands) were named after him. In 1875, Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld was the first to travel across the whole sea on a steamship &quot;Vega&quot;.

In 1892–1894, and again in 1900–1902, Baron Eduard von Toll explored the Laptev Sea in the course of two separate expeditions. On the ship &quot;Zarya&quot;, Toll carried out geological and geographical surveys in the area on behalf of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences. In his last expedition Toll disappeared off the New Siberian Islands under mysterious circumstances. Toll noted sizable and economically significant accumulations of perfectly preserved fossil ivory in recent beaches, drainage areas, river terraces and river beds within the New Siberian Islands. The later scientific studies demonstrated that the ivory accumulated over a period of some 200,000 years.

===Naming===
The name of the Laptev Sea changed several times. It was apparently known as the Tartar Sea () in the 16th century, the Lena Sea () in the 17th century, the Siberian Sea () in the 18th century and the Icy Sea () in the 19th century. It acquired the name Nordenskjold Sea () in 1893. On 27 June 1935, the sea finally received its current name after the cousins Dmitry Laptev and Khariton Laptev who first mapped its shores in 1735–1740.

==Flora and fauna==

Both flora and fauna are scarce owing to the harsh climate. Vegetation of the sea is mostly represented by diatoms, with more than 100 species. In comparison, the number of green algae, blue-green algae and flagellate species is about 10 each. The phytoplankton is characteristic of brackish waters and has a total concentration of about 0.2 mg/L. There are about 30 species of zooplankton with the concentration reaching 0.467 mg/L. The coastal flora mainly consists of mosses and lichens and a few flowering plants including Arctic poppy (&quot;Papaver radicatum&quot;), &quot;Saxifraga&quot;, &quot;Draba&quot; and small populations of polar (&quot;Salix polaris&quot;) and creeping (&quot;Salicaceae&quot;) willows. Rare vascular plants include species of &quot;Cerastium&quot; and &quot;Saxifraga&quot;. Non-vascular plants include the moss genera &quot;Detrichum&quot;, &quot;Dicranum&quot;, &quot;Pogonatum&quot;, &quot;Sanionia&quot;, &quot;Bryum&quot;, &quot;Orthothecium&quot; and &quot;Tortura&quot;, as well as the lichen genera &quot;Cetraria&quot;, &quot;Thamnolia&quot;, &quot;Cornicularia&quot;, &quot;Lecidea&quot;, &quot;Ochrolechia&quot; and &quot;Parmelia&quot;.

Permanent mammal species include ringed seal (&quot;Phoca hispida&quot;), bearded seal (&quot;Erignathus barbatus&quot;), harp seal (&quot;Pagophilus groenlandicus&quot;), walrus (&quot;Odobenus rosmarus&quot;), collared lemming (&quot;Dicrostonyx torquatus&quot;), Arctic fox (&quot;Alopex lagopus&quot;), reindeer (&quot;Rangifer tarandus&quot;) wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;), ermine (&quot;Mustela erminea&quot;), Arctic hare (&quot;Lepus timidus&quot;) and polar bear (&quot;Ursus maritimus&quot;), whereas beluga whales (&quot;Delphinapterus leucas&quot;) visit the region seasonally. The walrus of the Laptev Sea is sometimes distinguished as a separate subspecies &quot;Odobenus rosmarus laptevi&quot;, though this attribution is questioned. There are several dozens species of birds. Some belong to permanent (tundra) species, such as snow bunting (&quot;Plectrophenax nivalis&quot;), purple sandpiper (&quot;Calidris maritima&quot;), snowy owl (&quot;Bubo scandiacus&quot;) and brent goose and other make large colonies on the islands and sea shores. The latter include little auk (&quot;Alle alle&quot;), black-legged kittiwake (&quot;Rissa tridactyla&quot;), black guillemot (&quot;Cepphus grylle&quot;), ivory gull (&quot;Pagophila eburnea&quot;), &quot;uria&quot;, &quot;charadriiformes&quot; and glaucous gull (&quot;Larus hyperboreus&quot;). Among other bird species are skua, sterna, northern fulmar, (&quot;Fulmarus glacialis&quot;), ivory gull (&quot;Pagophila eburnea&quot;), glaucous gull (&quot;Larus hyperboreus&quot;), Ross&#x27;s gull (&quot;Rhodostethia rosea&quot;), long-tailed duck (&quot;Clangula hyemalis&quot;), eider, loon and willow grouse (&quot;Lagopus lagopus&quot;). There are 39 fish species, mostly typical of braskish environment; the major ones are grayling and &quot;Coregonus&quot; (whitefishes), such as muksun (&quot;Coregonus muksun&quot;), broad whitefish (&quot;Coregonus nasus&quot;) and omul (&quot;Coregonus autumnalis&quot;). Also common are sardine, Arctic cisco, Bering cisco, polar smelt, saffron cod, polar cod, flounder and Arctic char and inconnu.

In 1985, the Ust-Lena Nature Reserve was established in the delta (from – &quot;ust&quot;, meaning &quot;delta&quot;) of the Lena River with an area of 14,300 km2. In 1986, New Siberian Islands were included into the reserve. The reserve hosts numerous plants (402 species), fishes (32 species), birds (109 species) and mammals (33 species).

==Human activities==
The coast of the sea is shared by the Sakha Republic (Anabarsky, Bulunsky District and Ust-Yansky districts) on the east and Krasnoyarsk Krai (Taymyrsky Dolgano-Nenetsky District) of Russia on the west. The coastal settlements are few and small, with the typical population of a few hundred or less. The only exception is Tiksi (population 5,873), which is the administrative center of the Bulunsky District.

===Fishery and navigation===

Fishery and hunting have relatively small volume and are mostly concentrated in the river deltas. Data are available for the Khatanga Bay and deltas of the Lena and Yana rivers from 1981 to 1991 which translate into about 3,000 tonnes of fish annually. Extrapolated, they give the following annual estimates (in thousand tonnes) by species: sardine (1.2), Arctic cisco (2.0), Bering cisco (2.7), broad whitefish (2.6), Muksun (2.4) and others (3.6). Hunting sea mammals is only practiced by native people. In particular, walrus hunting is only allowed by scientific expeditions and local tribes for subsistence.

Despite freezing, navigation is a major human activity on the Laptev Sea with the major port in Tiksi. During Soviet times, the Laptev Sea coastal areas experienced a limited boom owing to the first icebreaker convoys plying the Northern Sea Route and the creation of the Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route. The route was difficult even for icebreakers – so &quot;Lenin&quot; (pictured) and her convoy of five ships were trapped in ice in the Laptev Sea around September 1937. They spent an enforced winter there and were rescued by another icebreaker &quot;Krasin&quot; in August 1938. The major transported goods were timber, fur and construction materials. Tiksi had an active airport, and Nordvik harbor further west was &quot;a growing town,&quot; though it was closed in the mid-1940s.

After the break-up of the Soviet Union commercial navigation in the Siberian Arctic went into decline in the 1990s. More or less regular shipping is to be found only from Murmansk to Dudinka in the west and between Vladivostok and Pevek in the east. Ports between Dudinka and Pevek see next to no shipping at all. Logashkino was abandoned in 1998 and is now a ghost town.

===Mining===
In the 1930, deposits of coal, oil and salt were discovered around the Nordvik Bay. In order to explore them in the extreme Arctic conditions, a Gulag penal labor camp was established in Nordvik. Drilling revealed only small, shallow oil pockets in connection with salt structures with little commercial significance. However the salt was extracted on a large scale by means of forced laborers in a penal colony. From the 1930s onwards Nordvik became an important source of salt supply for the northern fisheries. Although the original prospects for oil at Nordvik did not materialize, experience was gained in the exploration for hydrocarbons within the continuous permafrost zones. This experience proved invaluable in the later exploration and exploitation of the massive oil and gas fields of Western Siberia. The penal colony was closed and its traces erased in the mid-1940s right before Americans arrived in Nordvik as allies of the Soviet Union.

In 2017, Rosneft found oil in the Laptev Sea at its Tsentralno-Olginskaya-1 well.

In the Anabar District of Sakha, in the village of Mayat there is one of the northernmost diamond mines. There are also tin and gold mines in the Ust-Yansky District.

===Research===
The meteorological station of Tiksi has been renovated in 2006 (for example, it has internet connection and security cameras with a wireless interface) and has become part of the Atmospheric Observatory program of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration agency. The program aims at long-term, systematic and thorough measurements of clouds, radiation, aerosols, surface energy fluxes and chemistry in the Arctic. It is based on four Arctic stations at one of the world&#x27;s northernmost settlements, namely Eureka and Alert in Canada (in particular, Alert is the northernmost permanently inhabited place on Earth, only from the North Pole), Tiksi in Russia, and Utqiagvik in Alaska.

==Pollution==
The water pollution is relatively low and mostly originates from the numerous plants and mines standing on the Lena, Yana and Anabar rivers. Their waste is contaminated with phenols (0.002–0.007 mg/L), copper (0.001–0.012 mg/L) and zinc (0.01–0.03 mg/L) and is continuously washed down the rivers into the sea. Another regular polluter is the coastal Urban-type settlement of Tiksi. Occasional petrol spills occurred due to navigation and petrol mining. Another major contaminant is associated with floating and sunken wood in the sea, due to decades of rafting activities. As a result, the phenol concentration in the Laptev Sea is the highest over the Arctic waters.

<text>Humorism, the humoral theory, or humoralism, was a system of medicine detailing a supposed makeup and workings of the human body, adopted by Ancient Greek and Roman physicians and philosophers.

Humorism began to fall out of favor in the 17th century and it was definitively disproved in microbes.

==Origin==
The concept of &quot;humors&quot; may have origins in Ancient Egyptian medicine, or Mesopotamia, though it was not systemized until ancient Greek thinkers. The word &quot;humor&quot; is a translation of Greek , (literally &#x27;juice&#x27; or &#x27;sap&#x27;, metaphorically &#x27;flavor&#x27;). Early texts on Indian Ayurveda medicine presented a theory of three or four humors (doṣas), which they sometimes linked with the five elements (): earth, water, fire, air, and space.

The concept of &quot;humors&quot; (chemical systems regulating human behaviour) became more prominent from the writing of medical theorist Alcmaeon of Croton (c. 540–500 BC). His list of humors was longer and included fundamental elements described by Empedocles, such as water, earth, fire, air, etc. Hippocrates is usually credited with applying this idea to medicine. In contrast to Alcmaeon, Hippocrates suggested that humors are the vital bodily fluids: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. Alcmaeon and Hippocrates posited that an extreme excess or deficiency of any of the humors (bodily fluid) in a person can be a sign of illness. Hippocrates, and then Galen, suggested that a moderate imbalance in the mixture of these fluids produces behavioral patterns. One of the treatises attributed to Hippocrates, &quot;On the Nature of Man&quot;, describes the theory as follows:

The Human body contains blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. These are the things that make up its constitution and cause its pains and health. Health is primarily that state in which these constituent substances are in the correct proportion to each other, both in strength and quantity, and are well mixed. Pain occurs when one of the substances presents either a deficiency or an excess, or is separated in the body and not mixed with others. The body depends heavily on the four humors because their balanced combination helps to keep people in good health. Having the right amount of humor is essential for health. The pathophysiology of disease is consequently brought on by humor excesses and/or deficiencies. 

The existence of fundamental biochemical substances and structural components in the body remains a compellingly shared point with Hippocratic beliefs, despite the fact that current science has moved away from those four Hippocratic humors.

Although the theory of the four humors does appear in some Hippocratic texts, other Hippocratic writers accepted the existence of only two humors, while some refrained from discussing the humoral theory at all. Humoralism, or the doctrine of the four temperaments, as a medical theory retained its popularity for centuries, largely through the influence of the writings of Galen (129–201 AD). The four essential elements—humors—that make up the human body, according to Hippocrates, are in harmony with one another and act as a catalyst for preserving health. Hippocrates&#x27; theory of four humors was linked with the popular theory of the four elements (earth, fire, water, and air) proposed by Empedocles, but this link was not proposed by Hippocrates or Galen, who referred primarily to bodily fluids. While Galen thought that humors were formed in the body, rather than ingested, he believed that different foods had varying potential to act upon the body to produce different humors. Warm foods, for example, tended to produce yellow bile, while cold foods tended to produce phlegm. Seasons of the year, periods of life, geographic regions, and occupations also influenced the nature of the humors formed. As such, certain seasons and geographic areas were understood to cause imbalances in the humors, leading to varying types of disease across time and place. For example, cities exposed to hot winds were seen as having higher rates of digestive problems as a result of excess phlegm running down from the head, while cities exposed to cold winds were associated with diseases of the lungs, acute diseases, and &quot;hardness of the bowels&quot;, as well as ophthalmies (issues of the eyes), and nosebleeds. Cities to the west, meanwhile, were believed to produce weak, unhealthy, pale people that were subject to all manners of disease. In the treatise, &quot;On Airs, Waters, and Places&quot;, a Hippocratic physician is described arriving to an unnamed city where they test various factors of nature including the wind, water, and soil to predict the direct influence on the diseases specific to the city based on the season and the individual.

A fundamental idea of Hippocratic medicine was the endeavor to pinpoint the origins of illnesses in both the physiology of the human body and the influence of potentially hazardous environmental variables like air, water, and nutrition, and every humor has a distinct composition and is secreted by a different organ. Aristotle&#x27;s concept of eucrasia—a state resembling equilibrium—and its relationship to the right balance of the four humors allow for the maintenance of human health, offering a more mathematical approach to medicine.

The imbalance of humors, or dyscrasia, was thought to be the direct cause of all diseases. Health was associated with a balance of humors, or eucrasia. The qualities of the humors, in turn, influenced the nature of the diseases they caused. Yellow bile caused warm diseases and phlegm caused cold diseases. In &quot;On the Temperaments&quot;, Galen further emphasized the importance of the qualities. An ideal temperament involved a proportionally balanced mixture of the four qualities. Galen identified four temperaments in which one of the qualities (warm, cold, moist, or dry) predominated, and four more in which a combination of two (warm and moist, warm and dry, cold and dry, or cold and moist) dominated. These last four, named for the humors with which they were associated—sanguine, choleric, melancholic and phlegmatic—eventually became better known than the others. While the term &quot;temperament&quot; came to refer just to psychological dispositions, Galen used it to refer to bodily dispositions, which determined a person&#x27;s susceptibility to particular diseases, as well as behavioral and emotional inclinations.

Disease could also be the result of the &quot;corruption&quot; of one or more of the humors, which could be caused by environmental circumstances, dietary changes, or many other factors. These deficits were thought to be caused by vapors inhaled or absorbed by the body. Greeks and Romans, and the later Muslim and Western European medical establishments that adopted and adapted classical medical philosophy, believed that each of these humors would wax and wane in the body, depending on diet and activity. When a patient was suffering from a surplus or imbalance of one of the four humors, then said patient&#x27;s personality and/or physical health could be negatively affected.

Therefore, the goal of treatment was to rid the body of some of the excess humor through techniques like purging, bloodletting, catharsis, diuresis, and others. Bloodletting was already a prominent medical procedure by the first century, but venesection took on even more significance once Galen of Pergamum declared blood to be the most prevalent humor. The volume of blood extracted ranged from a few drops to several litres over the course of several days, depending on the patient&#x27;s condition and the doctor&#x27;s practice.

==Four humors==
Even though humorism theory had several models that used two, three, and five components, the most famous model consists of the four humors described by Hippocrates and developed further by Galen. The four humors of Hippocratic medicine are black bile (Greek: , &#x27;), yellow bile (Greek: , &#x27;), phlegm (Greek: , &quot;&quot;), and blood (Greek: , ). Each corresponds to one of the traditional four temperaments. Based on Hippocratic medicine, it was believed that for a body to be healthy, the four humors should be balanced in amount and strength. The proper blending and balance of the four humors was known as .

Humorism theory was improved by Galen, who incorporated his understanding of the humors into his interpretation of the human body. He believed the interactions of the humors within the body were the key to investigating the physical nature and function of the organ systems. Galen combined his interpretation of the humors with his collection of ideas concerning nature from past philosophers in order to find conclusions about how the body works. For example, Galen maintained the idea of the presence of the Platonic tripartite soul, which consisted of &quot; (spiritedness), (directed spiritedness, i.e. desire), and (wisdom)&quot;. Through this, Galen found a connection between these three parts of the soul and the three major organs that were recognized at the time: the brain, the heart, and the liver. This idea of connecting vital parts of the soul to vital parts of the body was derived from Aristotle&#x27;s sense of explaining physical observations, and Galen utilized it to build his view of the human body. The organs (named ) had specific functions (called ) that contributed to the maintenance of the human body, and the expression of these functions is shown in characteristic activities (called ) of a person. While the correspondence of parts of the body to the soul was an influential concept, Galen decided that the interaction of the four humors with natural bodily mechanisms were responsible for human development and this connection inspired his understanding of the nature of the components of the body.

Galen recalls the correspondence between humors and seasons in his &quot;On the Doctrines of Hippocrates and Plato&quot;, and says that, &quot;As for ages and the seasons, the child () corresponds to spring, the young man () to summer, the mature man () to autumn, and the old man () to winter&quot;. He also related a correspondence between humors and seasons based on the properties of both. Blood, as a humor, was considered hot and wet. This gave it a correspondence to spring. Yellow bile was considered hot and dry, which related it to summer. Black bile was considered cold and dry, and thus related to autumn. Phlegm, cold and wet, was related to winter.

Galen also believed that the characteristics of the soul follow the mixtures of the body, but he did not apply this idea to the Hippocratic humors. He believed that phlegm did not influence character. In his &quot;On Hippocrates″ The Nature of Man&quot;, Galen stated: &quot;Sharpness and intelligence () are caused by yellow bile in the soul, perseverance and consistency () by the melancholic humor, and simplicity and naivety () by blood. But the nature of phlegm has no effect on the character of the soul ().&quot; He further said that blood is a mixture of the four elements: water, air, fire, and earth.

These terms only partly correspond to modern medical terminology, in which there is no distinction between black and yellow bile, and phlegm has a very different meaning. It was believed that the humors were the basic substances from which all liquids in the body were made. Robin Fåhræus (1921), a Swedish physician who devised the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, suggested that the four humors were based upon the observation of blood clotting in a transparent container. When blood is drawn in a glass container and left undisturbed for about an hour, four different layers can be seen: a dark clot forms at the bottom (the &quot;black bile&quot;); above the clot is a layer of red blood cells (the &quot;blood&quot;); above this is a whitish layer of white blood cells (the &quot;phlegm&quot;); the top layer is clear yellow serum (the &quot;yellow bile&quot;).

Many Greek texts were written during the golden age of the theory of the four humors in Greek medicine after Galen. One of those texts was an anonymous treatise called &quot;On the Constitution of the Universe and of Man&quot;, published in the mid-19th century by J. L. Ideler. In this text, the author establishes the relationship between elements of the universe (air, water, earth, fire) and elements of the man (blood, yellow bile, black bile, phlegm). He said that:

* The people who have red blood are friendly. They joke and laugh about their bodies, and they are rose-tinted, slightly red, and have pretty skin.
* The people who have yellow bile are bitter, short tempered, and daring. They appear greenish and have yellow skin. 
* The people who are composed of black bile are lazy, fearful, and sickly. They have black hair and black eyes.
* Those who have phlegm are low spirited, forgetful, and have white hair.

Seventeenth century English playwright Ben Jonson wrote humor plays, where character types were based on their humoral complexion.

===Blood===
It was thought that the nutritional value of the blood was the source of energy for the body and the soul. Blood was believed to consist of small proportional amounts of the other three humors. This meant that taking a blood sample would allow for determination of the balance of the four humors in the body. It was associated with a sanguine nature (enthusiastic, active, and social). Blood is considered to be hot and wet, sharing these characteristics with the season of spring.

===Yellow bile===
Yellow bile was associated with a choleric nature (ambitious, decisive, aggressive, and short-tempered). It was thought to be fluid found within the gallbladder, or in excretions such as vomit and feces. The associated qualities for yellow bile are hot and dry with the natural association of summer and fire. It was believed that an excess of this humor in an individual would result in emotional irregularities such as increased anger or irrational behaviour.

===Black bile===
Black bile was associated with a melancholy nature, the word &quot;melancholy&quot; itself deriving from the Greek for &#x27;black bile&#x27;, (). Depression was attributed to excess or unnatural black bile secreted by the spleen.
Cancer was also attributed to an excess of black bile concentrated in a specific area. The seasonal association of black bile was to autumn as the cold and dry characteristics of the season reflect the nature of man.

===Phlegm===
Phlegm was associated with all phlegmatic nature, thought to be associated with reserved behavior. The phlegm of humorism is far from phlegm as it is defined today. Phlegm was used as a general term to describe white or colorless secretions such as pus, mucus, saliva, or sweat. Phlegm was also associated with the brain, possibly due to the color and consistency of brain tissue. The French physiologist and Nobel laureate Charles Richet, when describing humorism&#x27;s &quot;phlegm or pituitary secretion&quot; in 1910, asked rhetorically, &quot;this strange liquid, which is the cause of tumours, of chlorosis, of rheumatism, and cacochymia – where is it? Who will ever see it? Who has ever seen it? What can we say of this fanciful classification of humors into four groups, of which two are absolutely imaginary?&quot; The seasonal association of phlegm is winter due to the natural properties of being cold and wet.

== Humor production ==
Humors were believed to be produced via digestion as the final products of hepatic digestion. Digestion is a continuous process taking place in every animal, and it can be divided into four sequential stages. The gastric digestion stage, the hepatic digestion stage, the vascular digestion stage, and the tissue digestion stage. Each stage digests food until it becomes suitable for use by the body. In gastric digestion, food is made into chylous, which is suitable for the liver to absorb and carry on digestion. Chylous is changed into chymous in the hepatic digestion stage. Chymous is composed of the four humors: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. These four humors then circulate in the blood vessels. In the last stage of digestion, tissue digestion, food becomes similar to the organ tissue for which it is destined.

If anything goes wrong leading up to the production of humors, there will be an imbalance leading to disease. Proper organ functioning is necessary in the production of good humor. The stomach and liver also have to function normally for proper digestion. If there are any abnormalities in gastric digestion, the liver, blood vessels, and tissues cannot be provided with the raw chylous, which can cause abnormal humor and blood composition. A healthy functioning liver is not capable of converting abnormal chylous into normal chylous and normal humors.

Humors are the end product of gastric digestion, but they are not the end product of the digestion cycle, so an abnormal humor produced by hepatic digestion will affect other digestive organs.

== Relation to jaundice ==
According to Hippocratic humoral theory, jaundice is present in the Hippocratic Corpus. Some of the first descriptions of jaundice come from the Hippocratic physicians (icterus). The ailment appears multiple times in the Hippocratic Corpus, where its genesis, description, prognosis, and therapy are given. The five kinds of jaundice mentioned in the Hippocratic Corpus all share a yellow or greenish skin color.

A modern doctor will undoubtedly start to think of the symptoms listed in contemporary atlases of medicine after reading the clinical symptoms of each variety of jaundice listed in the Hippocratic Corpus. Despite the fact that the Hippocratic physicians&#x27; therapeutic approaches have little to do with contemporary medical practice, their capacity for observation as they described the various forms of jaundice is remarkable. In the Hippocratic Corpus, the Hippocratic physicians make multiple references to jaundice. At that time, jaundice was viewed as an illness unto itself rather than a symptom brought on by a disease.

==Unification with Empedocles&#x27;s model==
Empedocles&#x27;s theory suggested that there are four elements: earth, fire, water, and air, with the earth producing the natural systems. Since this theory was influential for centuries, later scholars paired qualities associated with each humor as described by Hippocrates/Galen with seasons and &quot;basic elements&quot; as described by Empedocles.

The following table shows the four humors with their corresponding elements, seasons, sites of formation, and resulting temperaments:


==Influence and legacy==
===Islamic medicine===

Medieval medical tradition in the Golden Age of Islam adopted the theory of humorism from Greco-Roman medicine, notably via the Persian polymath Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; (1025). Avicenna summarized the four humors and temperaments as follows:

===Perso-Arabic and Indian medicine===
The Unani school of medicine, practiced in Perso-Arabic countries, India, and Pakistan, is based on Galenic and Avicennian medicine in its emphasis on the four humors as a fundamental part of the methodologic paradigm.

===Western medicine===

The humoralist system of medicine was highly individualistic, for all patients were said to have their own unique humoral composition. From Hippocrates onward, the humoral theory was adopted by Greek, Roman and Islamic physicians, and dominated the view of the human body among European physicians until at least 1543 when it was first seriously challenged by Andreas Vesalius, who mostly criticized Galen&#x27;s theories of human anatomy and not the chemical hypothesis of behavioural regulation (temperament).
Typical 18th-century practices such as bleeding a sick person or applying hot cups to a person were based on the humoral theory of imbalances of fluids (blood and bile in those cases). Methods of treatment like bloodletting, emetics and purges were aimed at expelling a surplus of a humor. Apocroustics were medications intended to stop the flux of malignant humors to a diseased body part.

16th-century Swiss physician Paracelsus further developed the idea that beneficial medical substances could be found in herbs, minerals and various alchemical combinations thereof. These beliefs were the foundation of mainstream Western medicine well into the 17th century. Specific minerals or herbs were used to treat ailments simple to complex, from an uncomplicated upper respiratory infection to the plague. For example, chamomile was used to decrease heat, and lower excessive bile humor. Arsenic was used in a poultice bag to &#x27;draw out&#x27; the excess humor(s) that led to symptoms of the plague. Apophlegmatisms, in pre-modern medicine, were medications chewed in order to draw away phlegm and humors.

Although advances in cellular pathology and chemistry criticized humoralism by the 17th century, the theory had dominated Western medical thinking for more than 2,000 years. Only in some instances did the theory of humoralism wane into obscurity. One such instance occurred in the sixth and seventh centuries in the Byzantine Empire when traditional secular Greek culture gave way to Christian influences. Though the use of humoralist medicine continued during this time, its influence was diminished in favor of religion. The revival of Greek humoralism, owing in part to changing social and economic factors, did not begin until the early ninth century. Use of the practice in modern times is pseudoscience.

===Modern use===
Humoral theory was the grand unified theory of medicine, before the invention of modern medicine, for more than 2000 years. The theory was one of the fundamental tenets of the teachings of the Greek physician-philosopher Hippocrates (460–370 BC), who is regarded as the first practitioner of medicine, appropriately referred to as the &quot;Father of Modern Medicine&quot;.

With the advent of the Doctrine of Specific Etiology, the humoral theory&#x27;s demise hastened even further. This demonstrates that there is only one precise cause and one specific issue for each and every sickness or disorder that has been diagnosed. Additionally, the identification of messenger molecules like hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters suggests that the humoral theory has not yet been made fully moribund. Humoral theory is still present in modern medical terminology, which refers to humoral immunity when discussing elements of immunity that circulate in the bloodstream, such as hormones and antibodies.

Modern medicine refers to humoral immunity or humoral regulation when describing substances such as hormones and antibodies, but this is not a remnant of the humor theory. It is merely a literal use of &quot;humoral&quot;, i.e. pertaining to bodily fluids (such as blood and lymph).

The concept of humorism was not definitively disproven until 1858. There were no studies performed to prove or disprove the impact of dysfunction in known bodily organs producing named fluids (humors) on temperament traits simply because the list of temperament traits was not defined up until the end of the 20th century.

===Culture===
Theophrastus and others developed a set of characters based on the humors. Those with too much blood were sanguine. Those with too much phlegm were phlegmatic. Those with too much yellow bile were choleric, and those with too much black bile were melancholic. The idea of human personality based on humors contributed to the character comedies of Menander and, later, Plautus.
Through the neo-classical revival in Europe, the humor theory dominated medical practice, and the theory of humoral types made periodic appearances in drama. The humors were an important and popular iconographic theme in European art, found in paintings, tapestries, and sets of prints.

The humors can be found in Elizabethan works, such as in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, in which the character Petruchio, a choleric man, uses humoral therapy techniques on Katherina, a choleric woman, in order to tame her into the socially acceptable phlegmatic woman. Some examples include: he yells at the servants for serving mutton, a choleric food, to two people who are already choleric; he deprives Katherina of sleep; and he, Katherina and their servant Grumio endure a cold walk home, for cold temperatures were said to tame choleric temperaments.

The theory of the four humors features prominently in Rupert Thomson&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;Divided Kingdom&quot;.

<text>Neil N. LaBute (born March 19, 1963) is an American playwright, film director, and screenwriter. He is best known for a play that he wrote and later adapted for film, &quot;In the Company of Men&quot; (1997), which won awards from the Sundance Film Festival, the Independent Spirit Awards, and the New York Film Critics Circle. He wrote and directed the films &quot;Your Friends &amp; Neighbors&quot; (1998), &quot;Possession&quot; (2002) (based on the A. S. Byatt novel), &quot;The Shape of Things&quot; (2003) (based on his play of the same name), &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (2006), &quot;Some Velvet Morning&quot; (2013), and &quot;Dirty Weekend&quot; (2015). He directed the films &quot;Nurse Betty&quot; (2000), &quot;Lakeview Terrace&quot; (2008), and the American adaptation of &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot; (2010). LaBute created the TV series &quot;Billy &amp; Billie&quot;, writing and directing all of the episodes. He is also the creator of the TV series &quot;Van Helsing&quot;. Recently, he executive produced, co-directed and co-wrote Netflix&#x27;s &quot;The I-Land&quot;. He also directed several episodes for shows such as &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; and &quot;Billions&quot;.

==Early life==
LaBute was born in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Marian, a hospital receptionist, and Richard LaBute, a long-haul truck driver. LaBute is of French Canadian, English, and Irish ancestry, and was raised in Spokane, Washington. He studied theater at Brigham Young University (BYU), where he joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). At BYU, he also met actor Aaron Eckhart, who would later play leading roles in several of his films. He produced a number of plays that pushed the envelope of what was acceptable at the conservative religious university, some of which were shut down after their premieres. However, he also was honored as one of the &quot;most promising undergraduate playwrights&quot; at the BYU theater department&#x27;s annual awards. Labute did graduate work at the University of Kansas, New York University, and the Royal Academy of London, and he participated in a writing workshop at London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre.

==Career==
===Early career and success===
LaBute burst onto the theater scene in 1989 with his controversial debut &quot;Filthy Talk for Troubled Times&quot;. His interest in the film industry came with a viewing of &quot;The Soft Skin&quot; (&quot;La Peau Douce&quot; 1964), said the director to Robert K. Elder in a 2011 interview for &quot;The Film That Changed My Life&quot;.
It exposed me, probably in the earliest way, to &quot;Hey, I could do that.&quot; I&#x27;ve never been one to love the camera or even to be as drawn to it as I am to the human aspect of it, and I think it was a film that speaks in a very simple way of here&#x27;s a way that you can tell a story on film in human terms. It was the kind of film that made me go, &quot;I could do this; I want to tell stories that are like this and told in this way.&quot; And so it was altering for me in that way, in its simplicity or deceptive simplicity.

In 1993, he returned to BYU to premiere his play &quot;In the Company of Men&quot;, for which he received an award from the Association for Mormon Letters. He taught drama and film at IPFW in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in the early 1990s where he adapted and filmed the play, shot over two weeks and costing $25,000, beginning his career as a film director. The film won the Filmmakers Trophy at the Sundance Film Festival, and major awards and nominations at the Deauville Film Festival, the Independent Spirit Awards, the Thessaloniki Film Festival, the Society of Texas Film Critics Awards and the New York Film Critics Circle.

&quot;In the Company of Men&quot; portrays two businessmen (one played by Eckhart) cruelly plotting to romance and emotionally destroy a deaf woman. His next film &quot;Your Friends &amp; Neighbors&quot; (1998), with an ensemble cast including Eckhart and Ben Stiller, earned an R-rating for its portrayal of the sex lives of three yuppie couples in the big city.

His play &quot;&quot; is a set of three short plays (&quot;Iphigenia in Orem&quot;, &quot;A Gaggle of Saints&quot;, and &quot;Medea Redux&quot;) depicting essentially good Latter-day Saints doing disturbing and violent things. It ran Off-Broadway at the Douglas Fairbanks Theatre in 1999. &quot;Medea Redux&quot; is a one-person performance by Calista Flockhart. This play resulted in his being disfellowshipped from the LDS Church (i.e., losing some privileges of church membership without being excommunicated). He has since formally left the LDS Church.

===Early 21st century===
In 2001, LaBute wrote and directed the play &quot;The Shape of Things&quot;, which premièred in London, featuring film actors Paul Rudd and Rachel Weisz. It was turned into a film in 2003 with the same cast and director. Set in a small university town in the American Midwest, it focuses on four young students who become emotionally and romantically involved with each other, questioning the nature of art and the lengths to which people will go for love. Weisz&#x27;s character manipulates Rudd&#x27;s character into changing everything about himself and discarding his friends in order to become more attractive to her. She even pretends to fall in love with him, prompting an offer of marriage, whereupon she cruelly exposes and humiliates him before an audience, announcing that he has simply been an &quot;art project&quot; for her MFA thesis. 

In 2001, LaBute and producer Gail Mutrux founded the Pretty Pictures firm, with a first-look deal at USA Films.

LaBute&#x27;s 2002 play &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; was a theatrical response to the September 11, 2001, attacks. Set on September 12, it concerns a man who worked at the World Trade Center but was away from the office during the infamous 2001 terrorist attack – with his mistress. Expecting that his family believes that he was killed in the towers&#x27; collapse, he contemplates using the tragedy to run away and start a new life with his lover. Starring Liev Schreiber and Sigourney Weaver, the play was a commercial and critical success. While hesitant to term &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; &quot;political theater&quot;, Labute said, &quot;I refer to this play in the printed introduction as a kind of emotional terrorism that we wage on those we profess to love.&quot; He dedicated this edition to David Hare, in response to Hare&#x27;s &quot;straightforward, thoughtful, probing work&quot;.

His next play, &quot;Reasons to Be Pretty&quot;, played Off-Broadway from May 14 to July 5, 2008, in a production by MCC Theater at the Lucille Lortel Theatre. It went on Broadway in 2009, with previews at the Lyceum Theatre beginning March 13, and its opening on April 2. The play was nominated for three 2009 Tony Awards, including Best Play, Best Leading Actor in a Play (Thomas Sadoski), and Best Featured Actress in a Play (Marin Ireland), but did not win in any category. The production&#x27;s final performance was on June 14. In March 2013, the play was mounted at the San Francisco Playhouse.

===2010–present===
In 2010, LaBute directed &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot;, a remake of a 2007 British film of the same name. It was written by Dean Craig (who also wrote the original screenplay) and starred Chris Rock. Throughout the decade, various productions of his existing works were mounted as he continued to produce new material. He wrote new scenes and an introduction for the Chicago Shakespeare Theater production of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; by William Shakespeare which ran from April 7 to June 6, 2010. LaBute framed the classic play in overtly metatheatrical terms, adding a lesbian romance subplot. His short play, &quot;The Unimaginable&quot;, premiered as part of the Terror 2010 season at the Southwark Playhouse in London, October 12–31, 2010.

LaBute&#x27;s first produced play, &quot;Filthy Talk for Troubled Times&quot; (1989), which was a series of biting exchanges between two &quot;everyman&quot; characters in a bar, was staged from June 3–5, 2010, by MCC Theater as a benefit for MCC&#x27;s Playwrights&#x27; Coalition and their commitment to developing new work. LaBute also directed the reading. Originally when it premiered in New York City at the Westside Dance Project, &quot;[legend] has it ... that one unimpressed member of the audience shouted: &quot;Kill the playwright!&quot;&quot; 

&quot;The Break of Noon&quot; premiered Off-Broadway at the Lucille Lortel Theatre in an MCC Theater production on October 28, 2010 (previews), running to December 22, 2010. The play then opened in 2011 in Los Angeles at the Geffen Theater, again directed by Jo Bonney, with January 25 preview and opening on February 2. It ran through March 6. It featured Tracee Chimo, David Duchovny, John Earl Jelks, and Amanda Peet.

LaBute took part in the Bush Theatre&#x27;s 2011 project &quot;Sixty Six Books&quot;, for which he wrote a piece based upon a book of the King James Bible. In 2012, he joined the Chicago-based storefront theatre company, &quot;Profiles Theatre&quot; as a Resident Artist. &quot;The Way We Get By&quot; opened Off-Broadway at the Second Stage Theatre on May 19, 2015, starring Amanda Seyfried and Thomas Sadoski, with direction by Leigh Silverman.

The LaBute New Theater Festival is a festival of world premiere one-act plays that is produced by William Roth and St. Louis Actors&#x27; Studio each summer at their Gaslight Theater and each winter at 59E59 street theaters in New York. In 2013, &quot;Some Girl(s)&quot; was directed by Daisy von Scherler Mayer, with the screenplay adapted by Labute&#x27;s from his 2005 play. In an interview with Screen Comment&#x27;s Sam Weisberg, he said: &quot;I have had a lot of people direct my material for the theater, but I haven&#x27;t had anyone do my work on film. I was excited by what would be brought to it. It was great to have someone else in there that you could trust visually and intellectually and emotionally to make something that was respectful of the material but also creative.&quot;

In August 2016, the Utah Shakespeare Festival produced a preview of LaBute&#x27;s play &quot;How to Fight Loneliness&quot; in Cedar City, Utah, and announced its intention to stage the play during its 2017 summer season. In February 2018, MCC Theater terminated its relationship with him ending his place as their playwright-in-residence and their plans to produce his next play &quot;Reasons to Be Pretty Happy&quot; in the summer. Blake West, MCC Theater&#x27;s executive director, said, “We’re committed to creating and maintaining a respectful and professional work environment for everyone we work with.” In September 2018, it was announced that Netflix had given order for the production of the science fiction miniseries &quot;The I-Land&quot;. LaBute is credited as the showrunner and executive producer of the miniseries. The miniseries premiered on September 12, 2019.

==Critical response==
Critics have responded to his plays as having a misanthropic tone. Rob Weinert-Kendt in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; referred to LaBute as &quot;American theater&#x27;s reigning misanthrope&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that critics labeled him a misanthrope on the release of his film &quot;Your Friends &amp; Neighbors&quot; because of the film&#x27;s strong misanthropic plot and characters. Britain&#x27;s &quot;Independent&quot; newspaper in May 2008 dubbed him &quot;America&#x27;s misanthrope par excellence&quot;. Citing the misanthropic tone of the plot in the films &quot;In the Company of Men&quot;, &quot;Your Friends &amp; Neighbors&quot; and &quot;The Shape of Things&quot;, film critic Daniel Kimmel identified a pattern running through LaBute&#x27;s work of being that the unlikeable, main antagonists of those three films end up getting away with their lying, scheming and mis-deeds, coming out on top of all the other characters as the real winners of those stories by quoting: &quot;Neil LaBute is a misanthrope who assumes that only callous and evil people, who use and abuse others, can survive in this world.&quot; Critics labeled him a misogynist after the release of &quot;In the Company of Men&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2016, LaBute married actress Gia Crovatin.&lt;ref name=&quot;punchdrunkcritics/crovatin-labute-maggie&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honors===
In 2013, LaBute was named one of the winners of the American Academy of Arts and Letters&#x27; Arts and Letters Awards in Literature.

LaBute became a Fellow of the International Association of Theatre Leaders (IATL) in 2023.

===Style===
LaBute&#x27;s style is very language-oriented. His work is terse, rhythmic, and highly colloquial. His style bears similarity to one of his favorite playwrights, David Mamet. LaBute even shares some similar themes with Mamet including gender relations, political correctness, and masculinity.

<doc id="439198" wikidata="Q1943982" url="?curid=439198" title="Monaco (band)">
<text>Monaco are an English rock band, originally formed in 1995 as a side project of New Order bassist Peter Hook, together with David Potts, the only remaining member of Hook&#x27;s previous New Order side project, Revenge. The group is best known for the 1997 single &quot;What Do You Want from Me?&quot; and the album from which it was taken, &quot;Music for Pleasure&quot;, which sold over half a million copies. Hook, Potts and Kehoe currently perform together in Peter Hook and the Light. 

In July 2019, Hook announced that the band were to return, performing a new Monaco track, &quot;Higher, Higher, Higher Love&quot; during Peter Hook and the Light&#x27;s &#x27;Joy Division Orchestrated&#x27; show at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall.

==Debut album==
Potts initially met Hook while working as a tape operator in his studio. He was later recruited to play guitar on Revenge&#x27;s EP, &quot;Gun World Porn&quot; in 1992. After the breakup of Revenge, Hook and Potts reunited to form a more dance-oriented alternative group. Their first album, &quot;Music for Pleasure&quot;, was released in 1997. Some critics remarked on the similarities to New Order&#x27;s sound, owing to Hook&#x27;s recognisable bass style and the resemblance between Potts&#x27; vocal style and Bernard Sumner&#x27;s. Three singles were released from the album: &quot;What Do You Want from Me?&quot;, &quot;Sweet Lips&quot;, and &quot;Shine (Someone Who Needs Me)&quot;.

== Second album==
In 1999, Polydor Records rejected Monaco&#x27;s eponymous second album, due to changing trends in music.. Papillon Records agreed to release the album, though the planned single release of &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Feeling&quot; was recalled in the UK due to sample clearance issues. &quot;See-Saw&quot; was later released as a limited run 12&quot; single. Despite favorable reviews, the album was released with little to no promotion, and has become a collectible item.

==Break-up, live reunions and The Light==
In 2000, tensions mounted in the studio, partly due to Potts&#x27; dissatisfaction with the band&#x27;s failure to depart from a New Order-like sound, and partly due to Potts&#x27; workload. Following what Potts called &quot;a disastrous gig&quot; at the Eclipse festival, Hook and Potts had a major argument. They both took a break, and after letting things cool down, they met and decided it was best to split up Monaco. Potts eventually went on to form RAM and released a solo album, &quot;Coming Up for Air&quot;. Meanwhile Hook reunited with New Order, playing with them until 2007, and formed Freebass in 2007.

After the success of the Revenge reissues in 2005, Hook announced that he and Potts were working on similar Monaco reissues for release some time in 2007: however, the reissues were not released.

In March 2007, Hook and Potts performed Monaco songs together at the Hard Rock Cafe in Manchester under the name &quot;Hooky &amp; Pottsy&quot;. Original Monaco drummer Paul Kehoe also played along with Hook&#x27;s son Jack. In October 2007, the same line up performed again as Monaco at the Ritz in Manchester which raised money for Oxfam.

In July 2013, it was announced that David Potts would be the new guitarist for the Light, Hook&#x27;s new band, formed in 2009.

At a book signing in Bath, promoting Hook&#x27;s New Order biography &quot;Substance&quot;, Hook revealed that he and Potts intended to reunite as Monaco in January 2017. However, at a similar event in 2017, Hook revealed the reunion was currently shelved, with Potts devoting time to his new baby.

==2019 return==
At the &#x27;Joy Division Orchestrated&#x27; show at the Royal Albert Hall on July 6, 2019, Hook announced the return of Monaco, debuting their first new song in twenty years, &quot;Higher, Higher, Higher Love&quot;.

<doc id="439202" wikidata="Q245591" url="?curid=439202" title="Electron cyclotron resonance">
<text>Electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) is a phenomenon observed in plasma physics, condensed matter physics, and accelerator physics. It happens when the frequency of incident radiation coincides with the natural frequency of rotation of electrons in magnetic fields. A free electron in a static and uniform magnetic field will move in a circle due to the Lorentz force. The circular motion may be superimposed with a uniform axial motion, resulting in a helix, or with a uniform motion perpendicular to the field (e.g., in the presence of an electrical or gravitational field) resulting in a cycloid. The angular frequency (&quot;ω&quot; = 2&quot;π&quot;&quot;f&quot; ) of this &quot;cyclotron motion&quot; for a given magnetic field strength &quot;B&quot; is given (in SI units) by
: formula_1.
where formula_2 is the elementary charge and formula_3 is the mass of the electron. For the commonly used microwave frequency 2.45 GHz and the bare electron charge and mass, the resonance condition is met when &quot;B&quot; = .

For electron moving at relativistic speeds &quot;v&quot;, the formula needs to be adjusted according to the special theory of relativity to:
: formula_4
where
* &quot;m&quot;e is the electron rest mass
* formula_5.

== In plasma physics ==
An ionized plasma may be efficiently produced or heated by superimposing a static magnetic field and a high-frequency electromagnetic field at the electron cyclotron resonance frequency. In the toroidal magnetic fields used in magnetic fusion energy research, the magnetic field decreases with the major radius, so the location of the power deposition can be controlled within about a centimetre. Furthermore, the heating power can be rapidly modulated and is deposited directly into the electrons. These properties make electron cyclotron heating a very valuable research tool for energy transport studies. In addition to heating, electron cyclotron waves can be used to drive current. The inverse process of electron cyclotron emission can be used as a diagnostic of the radial electron temperature profile.
== ECR ion sources ==
The use of electron cyclotron resonance for efficient plasma generation, especially to obtain large numbers of multiply charged ions, has been applied in diverse fields:
* advanced cancer treatment, where ECR ion sources are crucial for proton therapy,
* advanced semiconductor manufacturing, especially for high density DRAM memories, through plasma etching or other plasma processing technologies,
* electric propulsion devices for spacecraft propulsion, where a broad range of devices (HiPEP, some ion thrusters, or electrodeless plasma thrusters),
* for particle accelerators, on-line mass separation and radioactive ion charge breeding,
* and, as a more mundane example, painting of plastic bumpers for cars.

The ECR ion source makes use of the electron cyclotron resonance to ionize a plasma. Microwaves are injected into a volume at the frequency corresponding to the electron cyclotron resonance, defined by the magnetic field applied to a region inside the volume. The volume contains a low pressure gas. The alternating electric field of the microwaves is set to be synchronous with the gyration period of the free electrons of the gas, and increases their perpendicular kinetic energy. Subsequently, when the energized free electrons collide with the gas in the volume they can cause ionization if their kinetic energy is larger than the ionization energy of the atoms or molecules. The ions produced correspond to the gas type used, which may be pure, a compound, or vapour of a solid or liquid material.

ECR ion sources are able to produce singly charged ions with high intensities (e.g. H+ and D+ ions of more than 100 mA (electrical) in DC mode using a 2.45 GHz ECR ion source).

For multiply charged ions, the ECR ion source has the advantages that it is able to confine the ions for long enough for multiple collisions and multiple ionization to take place, and the low gas pressure in the source avoids recombination. The VENUS ECR ion source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has produced in intensity of 0.25 mA (electrical) of Bi29+.

Some important industrial fields would not exist without the use of this fundamental technology, which makes electron cyclotron resonance ion and plasma sources one of the enabling technologies of today&#x27;s world.

== In condensed matter physics ==
Within a solid the mass in the cyclotron frequency equation above is replaced with the effective mass tensor formula_6. Cyclotron resonance is therefore a useful technique to measure effective mass and Fermi surface cross-section in solids. In a sufficiently high magnetic field at low temperature in a relatively pure material
: formula_7
where formula_8 is the carrier scattering lifetime, formula_9 is the Boltzmann constant and formula_10 is temperature. When these conditions are satisfied, an electron will complete its cyclotron orbit without engaging in a collision, at which point it is said to be in a well-defined Landau level.

<text>Folk devil is a person or group of people who are portrayed in folklore or the media as outsiders and deviant, and who are blamed for crimes or other sorts of social problems.

The pursuit of folk devils frequently intensifies into a mass movement that is called a moral panic. When a moral panic is in full swing, the folk devils are the subject of loosely organized but pervasive campaigns of hostility through gossip and the spreading of urban legends. The mass media sometimes get in on the act or attempt to create new folk devils in an effort to promote controversy. Sometimes the campaign against the folk devil influences a nation&#x27;s politics and legislation.

== Concept ==
The concept of the folk devil was introduced by sociologist Stanley Cohen in 1972, in his study &quot;Folk Devils and Moral Panics&quot;, which analysed media controversies concerning Mods and Rockers in the United Kingdom of the 1960s.

Cohen&#x27;s research was based on the media storm over a violent clash between two youth subcultures, the mods and the rockers, on a bank holiday on a beach in England, 1964. Though the incident only resulted in some property damage without any serious physical injury to any of the individuals involved, several newspapers published sensationalist articles surrounding the event. 
Cohen examined articles written about the topic and noted a pattern of distorted facts and misrepresentation, as well as a distinct, simplistic depiction of the respective images of both groups involved in the disturbance. He articulated three stages in the media&#x27;s reporting on folk devils:

# Symbolisation: the folk devil is portrayed in one singular narrative, their appearance and overall identity oversimplified to be easily recognizable.
# Exaggeration: the facts of the controversy surrounding the folk devil are distorted, or fabricated all together, fueling the moral crusade.
# Prediction: further immoral actions on the part of the folk devil are anticipated.

In the case of the mods and rockers, increased police presence the following year on the bank holiday led to another occurrence of violence. Cohen noted that the depiction of mods and rockers as violent, unruly troublemakers actually led in itself to a rise in deviant behaviour by the subcultures.

== Cases ==
The basic pattern of agitations against folk devils can be seen in the history of witchhunts and similar manias of persecution; the histories of predominantly Catholic and Protestant European countries present examples of adherents of the rival Western Christian faith as folk devils; minorities and immigrants have often been seen as folk devils; in the long history of anti-Semitism, which frequently targets Jews with allegations of dark, murderous practices, such as blood libel; or the Roman persecution of Christians that blamed the military reverses suffered by the Roman Empire on the Christians&#x27; abandonment of paganism.

In modern times, political and religious leaders in many nations have sought to present atheists and secularists as deviant outsiders who threaten the social and moral order. The identification of folk devils may reflect the efforts of powerful institutions to displace social anxieties. Some Christian groups alleged that there were fifty million Americans who engaged in some form of devil worship within their lifetimes.

Another example of religious and ethnic discrimination associated with Cohen&#x27;s folk devil theory would be Islamophobia, the discrimination of Muslims and those perceived as being Middle Eastern in origin. Post-9/11 reactions by Western countries stereotyped Muslims as violent, hateful, and of possessing fanatical extremist ideology. The group was depicted as posing a threat to social peace and safety in the Western world, and was subject to much hostility politically, from the media and from society.

Certain politicians, pundits, and media outlets are reportedly attempting to trigger that fear response by portraying transgender individuals as society’s folk devils, crafting a narrative that paints them as sexual deviants and labeling them as “groomers.” Even as such accusations are debunked or explained, multiple states have introduced or implemented anti-LGBT legislation as a response to the panic. The proposed laws include bans on gender-affirming care, limits on the participation of transgender athletes in sports, requirements for transgender individuals to use public bathrooms based on their assigned sex at birth and restrictions on public drag performances.

===Columbine===
In a 2014 study, Cohen&#x27;s theory of the moral panic was applied to the media reaction to the Columbine massacre.

On April 20, 1999, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, two students from Columbine High School in Columbine, Colorado, went on a shooting spree which resulted in the deaths of 15 people. News reports in the weeks following the tragedy labelled the shooters as being “obsessed” with goth subculture, and suggested a link between Harris and Klebold&#x27;s alleged identification with gothic subculture and their acts of violence.

In their attempt to make sense of the Columbine shootings, journalists and other media commentators linked goths to terrorism, Charles and Marilyn Manson, self-mutilation, hostage-taking, gang culture, the Waco cult, the Oklahoma City bombing, Satanism, mass murder, ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, suicide, the Internet, video games, skinhead music, white extremism and Adolf Hitler.

The ABC news program 20/20 aired a special entitled “The Goth Phenomenon” in which it reinforced claims that the shooters were heavily submerged in goth culture, and suggested that individuals of gothic subculture were to blame for homicidal activity in the past. 
The hostility and hysteria over the perceived ‘evil’ goth culture amplified in the years following the shooting. Goths were stereotyped in the media as being perpetuators or supporters of violence donned in black trench coats. Several high schools across the United States banned black trench coats and other apparel perceived as being linked to goth culture. Some police departments in the United States labelled gothic subculture as being “gang-based”, and as something that should be subjected to “increased police surveillance”. From the time of the Columbine shooting until 2003, there were reports of individuals sporting what was seen as gothic dress being interrogated, ticketed and arrested. In 2002, U.S. Representative Sam Graves caused Blue Springs, Missouri to be granted US$273,000 to combat the “new gothic threat”.
The backlash against goth subculture after the Columbine shooting draws many parallels to Stanley Cohen&#x27;s research on the mods and rockers, two other youth subcultures cast as folk devils by society. In both instances the groups were portrayed in one distinct, dumbed-down image, ostracized, stripped of any redeeming qualities, and blamed for wrongdoings in society.
