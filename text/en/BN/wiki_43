<text>James Hood (16 May 1948 – 3 December 2017) was a Scottish Labour Party politician, who served as a Member of Parliament from 1987 until being defeated in 2015. He represented the Clydesdale constituency until 2005, and the Lanark and Hamilton East constituency thereafter. Hood, a National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) trade union official during the miners&#x27; strike of 1984–85, remained a backbencher throughout his parliamentary career.

==Early life==
James Hood was born in Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire and was educated at the Lesmahagow Higher Grade School in Lesmahagow, Coatbridge College, Motherwell Technical College and the University of Nottingham.

He worked with the National Coal Board (NCB) for 23 years, as a mining engineer from 1964, the year he joined the NUM until 1987. He started his career with the NCB in the Lanarkshire Coalfield, at Auchlochan Colliery, moving to Nottinghamshire on the closure of the coalfield in the summer of 1968 and became a NUM trade union official in 1973. During the miners&#x27; strike of 1984–85 he led the striking Nottinghamshire miners.

From 1973 to 1987 he was a member of Ollerton Parish Council. In 1979 he was elected as a councillor to Newark and Sherwood District Council and served until his election to Westminster.

==Parliamentary career==
He was elected to the House of Commons as the Member of Parliament for Clydesdale at the 1987 general election, following the retirement of the sitting Labour MP Judith Hart. Hood won the seat with a majority of 10,502 votes. His Clydesdale-based seat was abolished as part of boundary changes directly before the 2005 general election. Hood then stood for the newly created seat and was elected as MP for Lanark and Hamilton East. He represented the seat until his defeat at the 2015 general election to the Scottish National Party candidate, Angela Crawley.

In Parliament, he joined the left-wing Campaign group and initially refused to pay the poll tax. In 1998, he called for the abolition of the system of parliamentary whips in a debate on workplace bullying, arguing that workplace abuses existed in Parliament &quot;where careers are controlled by the carrot and stick of political patronage&quot; and suggesting that &quot;career assassination&quot; was commonplace. Despite his credentials as a left-wing firebrand, he subsequently came to be regarded as a relatively loyal supporter of Tony Blair&#x27;s &#x27;New Labour&#x27;.

He voted against the first Gulf War, and was one of many Labour rebels that voted against the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

In Parliament, he served as the Chairman of the European legislation select committee from 1992 to 2006, having been a member from 1987. He was also member of the Liaison Committee from 1992 to 2006 and on the Defence Select Committee between 1997 and 2001. He was a Member of the Speaker&#x27;s panel of Chairmen from 1997.

In November 2008, Hood was one of 18 MPs who signed a Commons motion backing a Team GB football team at the 2012 Olympic Games, saying football &quot;should not be any different from other competing sports and our young talent should be allowed to show their skills on the world stage&quot;. The football governing bodies of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are all opposed to a Great Britain team, fearing it would stop them competing as individual nations in future tournaments.

In February 2014, Hood outlined his opposition to Scottish independence in a commons debate, stating &quot;Even if the SNP was right and there was a grand, great thing at the end of the rainbow for the SNP and its debate for independence, I would still be against it. If the Scottish people are going to be better off economically and so on, I would still be against breaking away from the Union&quot;.

In October 2014, Hood invoked parliamentary privilege to link former Home Secretary Leon Brittan to accusations of improper conduct with children. He added that &quot;I am just repeating what I read in the papers&quot;.

On 7 May 2015, Hood was unseated by the Scottish National Party candidate Angela Crawley, a South Lanarkshire Council councillor. Crawley overturned Hood&#x27;s previous majority of 13,478 votes to command a 10,100 majority for the SNP.

=== Expenses ===
During the MPs expenses scandal, it was reported that Hood had claimed £1,000 per month in second home expenses without claiming receipts, which was up to the permissible limits in place at the time. Hood said his second London home was necessary because of the distance of Westminster from Lanarkshire, and he accepted it would not be possible to make claims of that size in future without receipts and he &quot;fully supported&quot; putting details of expenses online.

==Personal life==
He married Marion McCleary in 1967; the couple had a son and a daughter and five grandchildren. He suffered a heart attack in 1998. Hood died of a second heart attack on 3 December 2017, aged 69.

<text>Philip Ian Hope (born 19 April 1955) is a former British Labour and Co-operative politician who was the member of parliament (MP) for Corby from 1997 until 2010, when he lost his seat to the Conservatives. He held several ministerial roles during his time as an MP. Since January 2011 he has been co-director of ImprovingCare.

==Early life==
Phil Hope was born in Battersea, the son of A.G. Hope, a Metropolitan Police commander, and Grace Thorogood. He was educated at Wandsworth Comprehensive School (later John Archer School, now closed) in Southfields and St Lukes College, Exeter where he was awarded a BEd degree in 1978. On leaving university in Exeter, he taught science for a year at Kettering School for Boys, before joining the National Council for Voluntary Organisations in 1979 as a youth policy advisor. He was appointed as the head of the Young Volunteers Resource Unit at the National Youth Bureau in 1982, before becoming a management consultant from Framework in 1985, becoming the Director of the Framework in Print Publishing Co-operative.

==Parliamentary career==
Hope joined the Labour Party in 1978, and the Co-operative party in 1982. He was elected as a councillor to the Kettering Borough Council in 1983, becoming the deputy Labour group leader in 1986, before leaving the council in 1987. He unsuccessfully contested Kettering at the 1992 General Election where he came second to the sitting Conservative Party transport minister Roger Freeman by 11,154 votes. He was elected to the Northamptonshire County Council in 1993, becoming the chairman of the Labour group in the same year, before standing down in 1997. He was elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 General Election for Corby, defeating the Conservative MP William Powell by 11,860 votes. He made his maiden speech on 14 May 1997. He remained the MP for Corby until the 2010 election when he was defeated by the Conservative candidate.

In parliament he was appointed as the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Nick Raynsford, the Minister of State at the former Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions in 1999, and after the 2001 General Election he became the PPS to the Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. He was promoted to the government of Tony Blair in 2003 as the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, again under John Prescott, at the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. He served as the Parliamentary Under Secretary at the Department for Education and Skills from the 2005 general election as the minister for vocational education until the department was disbanded in the reshuffle on 28 June 2007. He then moved to become Minister for the Third Sector, based in the Cabinet Office. Following a reshuffle on 24 January 2008 he took on additional responsibility as Minister for the East Midlands. He retained the latter role but moved from the Cabinet Office to become a Minister of State in the Department of Health following a reshuffle in October 2008.

===Employment of children during university holidays===
In 2008, following the Investigation and withdrawal of the whip from MP Derek Conway the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; revealed that Hope had &#x27;admitted&#x27; employing his children, both Politics students, at unspecified times during university holidays. Hope was one of at least 177 MPs employing family members and the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority report published 2 years later, whilst tightening the rules, confirmed that a member may employ one relative subject to general conditions relating to expenses.

===Expenses controversy===
In May 2009, Hope was criticised for claiming £37,000 in expenses from the taxpayer over 4 years for a London flat. The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; claimed that the total size of the items claimed for would have difficulty fitting inside the small flat. Less than a week after this revelation, Hope voluntarily agreed to return £41,709 to the taxpayer, despite claiming that he &#x27;kept to the rules laid down by Parliament&#x27;.
Following this announcement there were calls on other MPs to take Hope&#x27;s lead, while the Legg Report into the scandal found that he was only liable to repay £4,365.65.

The overall cost of his flat, including refurbishing, i.e. &#x27;staying away from main home&#x27; during the previous 8 years was 166th out of 647 MPs whilst his 2008-2009 costs were ranked 467.

==Personal life==
He married Allison Butt on 25 July 1980 in Chipping Sodbury and they have a son (born February 1984) and a daughter (born September 1986). He once appeared on the 1970s television drama series Z-Cars and can also both tap dance and juggle. Diagnosed with Hodgkin&#x27;s Disease in December 2006, Hope was later given the all-clear after successful treatment at Kettering and Northampton General Hospitals. He has been a governor of Park Junior School and Montagu Secondary School in Kettering.

Hope lived in the village of Pipewell near Kettering and now lives in Gloucestershire.

<text>John Rhodes Horam, Baron Horam (born 7 March 1939) is a Conservative politician in the United Kingdom. He has represented three parties in Parliament—originally a Labour MP, he defected to the SDP on its foundation in 1981, then to the Conservatives in 1987, and has served as a minister in both Labour and Conservative governments. On 4 September 2013, he was created a working life peer as Baron Horam of Grimsargh in the County of Lancashire. He is a founder and vice chair of the Common Sense Group of Conservative parliamentarians.

==Early life==
Horam was born in Grimsargh in the city of Preston, Lancashire. He went to the independent Silcoates School in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, where he was Head Boy, and won an Exhibition to St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge where he studied Economics, gaining an MA in 1960. From 1960 to 1962 he was a market research officer with the York firm of Rowntree &amp; Co. During his time at Rowntree&#x27;s, he did the market research for the new product “After Eight” Thin Mints. He then went into economic journalism, becoming a feature writer for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and &quot;The Economist.&quot; Leaving journalism, he started, with a partner, a new company, CRU International Ltd, an international business consultancy specialising in minerals and metals. He was also the first Chair of Circle Thirty Three Housing Association, now part of Clarion Housing.

==Parliamentary career==

===Labour===
Horam contested Folkestone and Hythe for Labour in the 1966 election, but lost to the incumbent, Albert Costain. He was elected as the Labour MP for Gateshead West at the 1970 general election. He was a Chair of The Manifesto Group of right-wing Labour MPs, who supported James Callaghan to lead the Labour Party. Callaghan was duly elected party leader in September 1976 and thus became Prime Minister, and Horam was appointed to the government as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State to Bill Rodgers in the Department of Transport. After Labour’s election defeat of 1979, Horam became a Labour Opposition spokesman on Economic Affairs.

===SDP===
Horam was one of the first to leave the Labour Party for the SDP in 1981, having become uneasy with the leftward direction of Labour. From 1981 to 1983 he was SDP spokesman for Economic Affairs under Roy Jenkins. In 1983, his constituency of Gateshead West having been abolished, he fought Newcastle Central, unsuccessfully, as an SDP candidate.

===Conservative===
Horam joined the Conservative Party shortly before the 1987 election and in 1991 was selected as the Conservative candidate for Orpington, famous for the Liberal by-election victory when Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister. He won the 1992 election with a majority of 12,935 over the Liberal Democrats. When Tony Blair triumphed in 1997 Horam held the seat with a reduced majority. In 2001 when William Hague was the Conservative leader he held on by only 269 votes. In 2005 however he increased his majority to 4,947 over the longstanding Liberal Democrat candidate Chris Maines. The seat has remained Conservative ever since. Despite his constituency being only a short train journey from the House of Commons, Horam claimed expenses for the second home that he maintained there.

==== Ministerial positions ====
In March 1994 Horam was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Office of Public Service and Science in the Cabinet Office. In November 1995 he moved sideways to become Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Health. Here he had 31 different areas of responsibility but had two particularly large policy areas: reorganising Community Health Councils and establishing the Private Finance Initiative in health. He occupied this position until the Conservative defeat in the 1997 election. He is the only MP in recent times who has served as a Minister for both major parties.

==== Select Committee activity in the Commons ====
Following election as a Conservative MP in 1992, Horam was appointed a member of the Public Accounts Committee. This lasted until he was appointed a Minister in 1995. Following the Labour victory in 1997, he was elected the first Chair of the new Environmental Audit Committee, set up by the Labour government. The main focus of the Committee was the emerging problem of climate change. He held this position until July 2003. When he stood down a Commons motion praised him for his work. During this time, as Chair of a Committee, Horam was a member of the Commons Liaison Committee, which, among other duties, took evidence from the Prime Minister three times a year.

Following re-election in 2005, Horam was appointed a member of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, a position he held until 2010.

==== Political activity in the Commons ====
Horam gained some notoriety during the 1997 election when he became the first member of the Major government to come out publicly against joining a single currency.

In 2003 he was one of a handful of Conservative MPs who voted against Britain’s participation in the Iraq War.

From 2003 to 2008 he was an elected member of the Executive of the Conservative Backbench 1992 Committee.

As part of his interest in parliamentary reform, he drafted the original &quot;Equal Votes&quot; legislation which stipulated that Parliamentary constituencies should be of roughly equal size.

On 12 October 2009, Horam announced his intention to stand down at the next general election.

==== Electoral Commission ====
On retiring from the House of Commons, Horam was appointed a Commissioner at the Electoral Commission, which supervises all elections and referendums in the UK. He held this post from 2011 to 2018.

==== House of Lords ====
On 4 September 2013 Horam was created a working life peer as Baron Horam of Grimsargh in the County of Lancashire.

==== Lords Committee Activity ====
On  becoming a working peer, he was appointed to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee (2013-2014). He then moved to the Communications and Digital Committee (2014-2015). After this he became a member of the External Affairs Subcommittee of the European Union Committee (2015–19).

In March 2020 he joined the High Speed (West Midlands-Crewe) Bill Select Committee until its report in 2021.

==== Political activity in the Lords ====
In the Lords he has advocated a Living Wage, raising the Income Tax threshold, better vocational training and more apprenticeships, more help for the Trouble Families Programme, and a big housing drive. A member of the Conservative European Mainstream Group, he remains strongly pro-EU, believing that the UK maximises its influence and prosperity in the EU. After Brexit, he accepted the decision, but argued that Britain should remain a member of the Single European Market, like Norway.

==== Economic Policy ====
In a speech in the Lords on 3 December 2020 on the Government’s spending Review, Horam said that he is a supporter of Modern Monetary Theory believing that &quot;the economic Policy should balance the economy, rather than the Budget&quot;. Stating that, &quot;rather than worrying too much about deficits, the advantage of MMT is that it enables Governments to concentrate on what should be done to improve the economy and society, and not be perpetually bogged down in arguments about how to pay for it.&quot; He positioned himself, on the raising of taxes, &quot;that they should only be raised to damp down demand should inflation rise.&quot;

In support of the 2021 Budget he told the Lords that he, &quot;[takes] the view the first fiscal rule of economics is, in all circumstances, to maximise real economic growth. The second rule is to make the distribution of the rewards of growth as fair as practically possible. I support the Budget because it made some real progress in both these areas. My only doubt about the Budget is the proposed rise in Corporation Tax, which is also a reservation on the part of the Office of Budget Responsibility.&quot;

In a speech on the second budget in 2021 in the Lords on 3 November 2021 he said: &quot;The fact is that Britain has, for too long, been trying to get European levels of public service and welfare at US levels of taxation. The crunch has now come. The Government have given clear indication that they prioritise maintaining, and if possible improving, public services and are therefore prepared to put up taxation to the same extent. That is fundamentally right... There is therefore no evidence that a higher tax rate, within the sort of limits that we are talking about, necessarily adversely affects the rate of growth... A factor that is important is the way in which you use the money that you have raised.&quot; Lord Horam went on to criticise the decision to scrap the £20 uplift in Universal Credit, but said that apart from that blemish the Government’s economic strategy was right.

In the debate on the Autumn 2023 statement, Horam said: &quot;I am afraid to say that we have been running the economy since what I call the Blair-Brown days in a very sub-optimal way, because it has relied on high and increasing levels of immigration... I suggest that the Government at the centre, in Downing Street or the Cabinet Office, take a long-term, holistic view of the demographic, environmental, societal and economic trends in the country and start to adjust the economic model that we have been pursuing over the last 20 or 30 years.&quot;

In a speech to the Lords on the Spring Budget 2024 debate on 18 March 2024 he said: &quot;As an economist as well as a politician, I have always believed that the economy should work for everyone.&quot;

==== Levelling Up ====
In his response to the Queen’s Speech of 2020 in January 2020, Lord Horam called for the Government to deliver on its promises made in the election to help the “towns and cities of the North of England and the Midlands”. He welcomed the £3.5 billion being put behind the so-called Towns Fund. He also called for greater investment in technical education,  better connections between London, the north and midlands and criticised the apprenticeship levy.

Also in that Queen’s speech, he was critical of the roll-out of Universal credit, which he said needs &quot;urgent attention&quot; and acknowledged that while something needed to be done about social care, what was really needed was &quot;a big cheque&quot;. The government could not deal with this investment by &quot;a more relaxed approach to debt&quot; and called for an increase in taxation specifically in relation to capital gains and dividends. He said that the UK was a &quot;lightly taxed&quot; country compared to others in Europe.

In a speech on 14 October 2021 in the Lords in a debate on Inequalities of Region and Place Horam praised the government’s efforts in helping the north. He said: &quot;We have a levelling-up fund, a community renewal fund, a shared prosperity fund, and free ports and towns funds. We have the beginning of effective localism in the shape of city mayors. I also think that levelling up will help the south. As the Prime Minister said when he was Mayor of London: &quot;Do we really want the south-east of Britain, already the most densely populated major country in Europe, to resemble a giant suburbia?&quot;

==== Environment, population growth and immigration ====
In a speech in the Lords on 10 December 2020 on the Statutory Instruments introducing new immigration rules, Horam said that ‘this Statutory instrument has been brought about by the UK’s exiting of the EU and therefore leaving the free movement of people system which prevails in the EU.&quot; He stated that the Blair Labour Government had bought in heavily to free movement and mass immigration and the results were devastating for some working class communities. He specifically cited the experience of Paul Embery, the Labour and trade union activist, whose book, &quot;Despised&quot;, sets out the effect on Dagenham, where he was born. Horam said he hopes that &quot;present politicians of all parties understand the lessons of the last 20 years and listen more to the views of the British people&quot;.

In a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; on 7 September 2022, Horam wrote: “the rapid population growth of recent decades is causing significant housing, environmental and social problems for our already heavily populated island...and most (80 per cent) of the increase is down to immigration. The answer is to restore the limits and restraints on the number of work and other visas granted each year; these were part of government policy under all parties until the Blair government steadily abolished them.”

In a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; on 20 May 2023, Horam wrote: &quot;There is a way of proving more genuinely affordable homes without destroying even more of the precious countryside in our small island. It includes reducing net immigration, banning second homes or taxing them more heavily, doing the same for foreign ownership of homes and revising the compulsory purchase laws to give local authorities the power to buy land at a reasonable rate.&quot;

==== The Union ====
In a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; on 2 July 2021 Lord Horam suggested that one way of improving Union relations within the UK would be to have “regular meetings between the Prime Minister and the First Ministers, revolving between Cardiff, Belfast, Edinburgh and London.”

==== Common Sense Group of Conservatives ====
In 2021 Lord Horam helped in setting up, with Sir John Hayes, MP for South Holland the Deepings, the Common Sense Group of Conservative Parilamentarians. This is now a substantial group in Parliament with a strong core of new “Red Wall” MPs. It campaigns for a robust approach to immigration, law and order and “wokery” and supports the Levelling Up agenda.

== Personal life ==
He married Judith Jackson, formerly Motoring Editor of The Sunday Times and The Guardian, in 1987. She has two sons by a previous marriage, including the soldier and politician Lincoln Jopp, who was elected as Conservative MP for Spelthorne in the 2024 United Kingdom general election.

In 2010 he was elected a Fellow Commoner of St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

in July 2018 he become Patron of the Grimsargh Wetlands Trust.

<doc id="434656" wikidata="Q689546" url="?curid=434656" title="George Howarth">
<text>Sir George Edward Howarth (born 29 June 1949) is a British Labour Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Knowsley until 2024. He also served the seat&#x27;s predecessors since being elected in a by-election in 1986, firstly as the MP for Knowsley North (until 1997) and then Knowsley North and Sefton East (1997–2010).

==Early life and career==

Born in Prescot, Howarth was educated at the local Huyton Secondary School, the Kirkby College of Further Education, and the Liverpool John Moores University. He went on to study at the University of Salford. He served his apprenticeship for four years from 1966 as an engineer, and then worked as an engineer until 1975 when he moved into teaching.

In 1980 he joined Cooperative Development Services, and in 1982 was appointed the Chief Executive at the Wales Cooperative Centre. He became the Chief Executive of the Wales Trades Union Congress sponsored Centre in Cardiff, a position he held before his election to the House of Commons.

Howarth was elected as a councillor to the Huyton District Council in 1971 and served in its successor the Knowsley Borough Council until 1986, becoming its deputy leader from 1982 to 1983. He was the chair of the Knowsley South Constituency Labour Party for four years from 1981.

==Parliamentary career==

The sitting Labour MP for Knowsley North, Robert Kilroy-Silk, resigned from Parliament in 1986 mid term to follow a career with the BBC. In the by-election on 13 November 1986, Howarth was elected with a safe majority of 6,724. He subsequently became MP for Knowsley North &amp; Sefton East in 1997 and Knowsley in 2010 as constituency boundaries were redrawn. In the 2017 general election, he received 85% of the vote, one of the greatest majorities for a British MP since the advent of universal suffrage.

He served as an opposition spokesperson on Environment 1989–1994 and Home Affairs 1994–1997. In 1997, he was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Home Office, and in 1999 to the same position at the Northern Ireland Office. He left the government in 2001. He has served on a wide variety of select committees. He became a member of the Privy Council in 2005.

Howarth helped to enact the modern postal voting system. By 1999, the system of postal and proxy voting for those unable to vote at polling stations was seen as cumbersome and complex. Howarth, as Minister of State at the Home Office, chaired the Working Party on Electoral Procedures, which recommended that: absent voting should be allowed on demand and that the application and voting procedures for absent voting should be simplified. The Representation of the People Act 2000 implemented the recommendations. The Representation of the People (England &amp; Wales) Regulations 2001 introduced the changes to the absent voting arrangements from 16 February 2001. The main change was to allow postal voting on demand.

Howarth was appointed one of two temporary Deputy Speakers of the House after the 2015 Queens Speech, until the new deputy speakers were elected on 3 June 2015. Following the 2017 Queens Speech, Howarth again served until the new deputy speakers were elected on 28 June 2017 without standing for the position himself.

He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election.

Howarth was knighted in the 2019 Birthday Honours. He briefly acted as First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means at the start of the 2019 Parliament.

He announced in June 2023 that he would retire at the 2024 general election. He was succeeded as MP by Anneliese Midgley.

==Personal life==
Howarth is the father of three children. In 2011, Howarth&#x27;s daughter, Sián, died at the age of 24 due to complications from Type 1 diabetes.

<text>James Alexander Hood (November 10, 1942 – January 17, 2013) was one of the first African Americans to enroll at the University of Alabama in 1963, and was made famous when Alabama Governor George Wallace attempted to block him and fellow student Vivian Malone from enrolling at the then all-white university, an incident which became known as the &quot;Stand in the Schoolhouse Door&quot;.

== Early life ==
Hood was born on November 10, 1942, in Gadsden, Alabama. His father, Octavie Hood, drove a tractor at a Goodyear tire plant.

Hood began college at the historically-black Clark College, but wanted to transfer so he could pursue a degree in clinical psychology, which wasn&#x27;t available at Clark.

== University of Alabama ==

On June 11, 1963, in a ceremonial demonstration, Wallace stood in front of the university&#x27;s Foster Auditorium. Hood arrived to pay his fees, accompanied by Vivian Malone and Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach. Wallace intended to keep true to his promise of upholding segregation in the state and stopping &quot;integration at the schoolhouse door&quot;. As Malone and Hood waited in a car, Deputy Attorney General Katzenbach and a small team of federal marshals confronted Wallace to demand that he step aside and allow Malone and Hood entry, by order of the state court. Wallace not only refused the order, he interrupted Katzenbach and, in front of the crowds of media crews surrounding him, delivered a short, symbolic speech concerning state sovereignty, claiming that: &quot;The unwelcomed, unwanted, unwarranted and force-induced intrusion upon the campus of the University of Alabama... of the might of the Central Government offers frightful example of the oppression of the rights, privileges and sovereignty of this State by officers of the Federal Government.&quot;

After seeing that Wallace would not step aside, Katzenbach called upon the assistance of President John F. Kennedy to force Wallace to permit the black students&#x27; entry into the university. President Kennedy federalized the Alabama National Guard later the same day, which put them under the command of the President, rather than the Governor of Alabama. Guardsmen escorted Hood and Malone back to the auditorium, where Wallace moved aside at the request of General Henry Graham. Hood and Malone then entered the building, albeit through another door.

Hood left the university after only two months. He&#x27;d started his time on campus on a dorm floor shared only by federal marshals, and had a dead black cat mailed to him. He was then threatened with expulsion for a speech he gave that berated Governor Wallace and the University of Alabama. The final straw was his father&#x27;s cancer, and so he left to avoid a &quot;complete mental and physical breakdown.&quot; He received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Michigan&#x27;s Wayne State University and a master&#x27;s degree from Michigan State University, concentrating in criminal justice and sociology.

== Later life ==
Hood then moved to Wisconsin, where he worked at the Madison Area Technical College for 26 years. He was a deputy police chief in Detroit at one point, and worked in the police science program at the Madison Area Technical College.

Hood returned to the University of Alabama in the 1990s to begin earning his doctorate degree in interdisciplinary studies. In 1996, he started a book on George Wallace, the governor who had tried to prevent his integration of the University of Alabama back in 1963. Hood sat at Wallace&#x27;s bedside for hours of interviews and the two became friends, although Hood grappled with how Wallace could explain his actions. Hood decided that Wallace was a politician willing to exploit racism for votes rather than a deeply racist person, although other black people who knew Wallace contested Hood&#x27;s justifications. Hood earned his Ph.D. in interdisciplinary studies in 1997 and requested that Wallace present his degree, and Wallace would have if not for his poor health. Hood believed that Wallace&#x27;s apologies for his past actions were sincere, as he wrote in an interchange following a PBS documentary on Wallace, &quot;Setting the Woods on Fire&quot;. Hood attended Wallace&#x27;s funeral in 1998, saying that Wallace was haunted by the lack of forgiveness for his actions and that he had already forgiven Wallace, since Wallace had publicly apologized for his opinions and actions. Vivian Malone, the other black student who integrated the university with Hood, had similarly forgiven Wallace in his later years, and met with him in 1996 as well.

== Personal life ==
Hood retired in 2002 as chairman of public safety services in charge of police and fire training at the Madison Area Technical College. He then moved back to Gadsden, Alabama, the city in which he was born, where he died at home on January 17, 2013, at the age of 70. He was survived by his daughters Mary Hood and Jacquelyn Hood-Duncan, and sons Darrell, Anthony, and Marvis Hood.

<doc id="434662" wikidata="Q689589" url="?curid=434662" title="Gerald Howarth">
<text>Sir James Gerald Douglas Howarth (born 12 September 1947) is a British Conservative Party politician. He was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Aldershot from 1997 until 2017, having been the MP for Cannock and Burntwood from 1983 to 1992.

He was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defence as Minister for International Security Strategy from May 2010 to September 2012 and is chairman of Conservative Way Forward. In 2016, he joined the political advisory board of Leave Means Leave. He stood down at the 2017 general election.

==Early life and career==
The son of James and Mary Howarth, he was educated at Bloxham School and the University of Southampton (BA Hons), and married Elizabeth Jane (née Squibb) in 1973; the couple have two sons and a daughter, Emily, who is married to Conservative MP James Cartlidge.

Howarth joined the Conservative party in 1964. and in March 1968 was present at the Grosvenor Square anti-Vietnam War demonstration, waving a US flag in support of the war, saying &quot;I suspect that I am unique among those of us who were there in Grosvenor Square on that horrifying and frightening occasion in so far as mine was the only banner in support of the Americans. I took the precaution of ensuring that there was a thin blue line of men from the Metropolitan police between me and the hordes, and very wise I was, too&quot;. On 16 April 1970, Howarth demonstrated in favour of the abolition of exchange controls outside the Bank of England. On 14 January 1975 he wrote to &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper defending the conviction of Ricky Tomlinson and Des Warren over the Shrewsbury building strike.

A qualified private pilot, he was commissioned into the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as an acting pilot officer in 1968, serving until late 1969. Twenty years later, in 1988, he received the Britannia Airways Parliamentary Pilot of the Year Award. In 1971 Howarth was employed by the Bank of America International Ltd, where he remained until 1977, when he moved to the European Arab Bank. He then became the Syndication Manager for the Standard Chartered Bank for the next two years, after which he was first elected to parliament.

Howarth was General Secretary of the Society for Individual Freedom, a right-wing pressure group, from 1969 to 1971 after leaving university. He was also once an active member of the Conservative Monday Club while at university. From 1973 to 1977 he was Director of the Freedom Under The Law Group. He served as an elected councillor on the London Borough of Hounslow from 1982 to 1983, and sat on its Environmental Planning, and Finance and General Purposes Committees.

While South Africa was governed under the apartheid system, Howarth set up a &quot;Hain prosecution fund&quot; to raise money to privately prosecute anti-apartheid activist Peter Hain, later a Labour cabinet minister. The prosecution was sponsored by the Society for Individual Freedom, of which Howarth was the general secretary. According to John Mann, Howarth and Francis Bennion set up an organisation to counter the anti-apartheid movement called &quot;Freedom Under Law&quot;.

==Parliamentary career==
===First spell (1983–92)===
Howarth was first elected for the Cannock and Burntwood constituency in the Conservative landslide victory at the 1983 general election. Allegations of far-right sympathies were made against Howarth in a controversial January 1984 &quot;Panorama&quot; programme, &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Militant Tendency&quot;. Howarth and his close friend Neil Hamilton both successfully sued the BBC and were each awarded £20,000 damages for libel in October 1986, with their court costs paid.

Howarth was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Michael Spicer when Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Energy 1987–90, and as Minister of State, Department of the Environment in 1990. In November that year he voted for first of all Margaret Thatcher in the leadership election of the Conservative Party. When she resigned he voted for John Major to succeed her.

He lost his seat at the 1992 general election. He was absent from parliament for five years, but was re-elected at the 1997 general election as MP for Aldershot.
===Second spell (1997–2017)===
He is a supporter of the British defence industry, when, speaking in support of the industry, he told delegates at a meeting in 2009 sponsored by the Defense Industries Council that &quot;People who decry the defence industry should hang their heads in shame because it is a noble industry&quot;. He also told the meeting that, should his party attain government, he could accept the title of &quot;Minister for War&quot; reflecting his belief that wider Government should recognise that Great Britain is at war and support the armed forces appropriately.

In 2001, Howarth was one of several famous faces duped into appearing on the Channel Four &quot;Brass Eye&quot; television programme; this was the &quot;Paedogeddon&quot; spoof episode, where he agreed to read out anti-paedophile warnings.

In a programme in 2008 about the fall of Margaret Thatcher, Howarth told Michael Portillo that he was &quot;gutted&quot; when Thatcher resigned in November 1990.

At the 2015 general election Howarth was joined in the Commons by his son-in-law, James Cartlidge, the Conservative MP for South Suffolk. On 20 April 2017, Howarth announced he would not be seeking re-election in the 2017 general election and now resides in Suffolk.

=== Race relations ===
In 1999, Howarth questioned the conclusion of the Macpherson report (into Stephen Lawrence&#x27;s death) that the Metropolitan police are &quot;institutionally racist&quot; as &quot;a grotesque over-reaction.&quot;

In 2005, he said about Muslims: &quot;If they don&#x27;t like our way of life, there is a simple remedy: go to another country, get out. There are plenty of other countries whose way of life would appear to be more conducive to what they aspire to. They would be happy and we would be happy&quot;.

After British Airways in November 2006 indicated that a member of its check-in staff would not be permitted to display a cross over her uniform, Howarth announced his decision to boycott the flag carrier and said that &quot;the idea that somehow it has become unacceptable to demonstrate that (Christian) faith is bizarre...the cross is a modest symbol. It is not an aggressive or provocative gesture... it is a quiet demonstration of faith&quot;.

In August 2014, he warned about the dangers of immigration to Britain as he perceives them in a leaked e-mail to a constituent and declared that Enoch Powell was right in his anti-immigration &quot;rivers of blood&quot; speech in April 1968: &quot;Clearly, the arrival of so many people of non-Christian faith has presented a challenge, as so many of us, including the late Enoch Powell, warned decades ago&quot;.

=== Homosexuals ===
In 2000, he described the lifting of the ban on homosexuals in the military as &quot;appalling&quot; and went on to state that the &quot;decision will be greeted with dismay, particularly by &quot;ordinary&quot; soldiers in Her Majesty&#x27;s forces, many of whom joined the services precisely because they wished to turn their backs on some of the values of modern society&quot;.

In 2005 he criticised the gay Labour Minister Peter Mandelson because his life-partner, Reinaldo Avila da Silva, a Brazilian translator who had been living in the UK for seven years, had received British citizenship. Howarth described Avila da Silva as Mandelson&#x27;s &#x27;consort&#x27;, who was less deserving of citizenship than others.

On 20 May 2013, whilst debating the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, Howarth warned of &quot;the aggressive homosexual community who see this as but a stepping stone to something even further.&quot; Howarth did not elaborate on what &quot;something further&quot; would be.

=== Expenses ===
Following the expenses scandal of 2009, Howarth said that he had &quot;acted within the rules&quot; set out by the House of Commons, but nonetheless repaid expenses identified by Sir Thomas Legg as being unreasonable.

=== Honours and appointments ===

After the 2012 reshuffle, he was recommended for a knighthood and was appointed a Knight Bachelor on 20 September 2012.

In April 2013, he was appointed chairman of the Thatcherite campaign group Conservative Way Forward.

===Whistleblowing===
Howarth is now the chairman of Addveritas – advisers on whistleblowing.

<text>Sir Lindsay Harvey Hoyle (born 10 June 1957) is a British politician who has served as Speaker of the House of Commons since 2019 and as Member of Parliament (MP) for Chorley since 1997. Before his election as speaker, he was a member of the Labour Party.

As a Labour MP, Hoyle served as Chairman of Ways and Means and a deputy speaker to John Bercow from 2010 to 2019, before being elected as Speaker on 4 November 2019. Hoyle was unanimously re-elected as Speaker after both the 2019 general election and the 2024 general election.

==Early life and career==

Lindsay Hoyle was born on 10 June 1957 in Adlington, the son of the future Labour MP Doug Hoyle (later Lord Hoyle) and Pauline Spencer. He went to Adlington County School and Lord&#x27;s College in Bolton. Prior to being elected as an MP, he ran his own textile and screen printing business.

In the 1980 local elections, Hoyle was elected as the Labour councillor for the ward of Adlington on Chorley Borough Council, defeating the sitting Conservative. He was re-elected four times, and served as Deputy Leader from 1994 to 1997. After being elected as an MP at the 1997 general election, he ended his time on the council as the annual mayor before stepping down at the local election in 1998.

== Parliamentary career ==
In February 1996, Hoyle was chosen as the Labour candidate for Chorley at the 1997 general election; he was elected to Parliament as MP for Chorley with 53% of the vote and a majority of 9,870.

In the days after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in August 1997, Hoyle asked for a new national children&#x27;s hospital to be built as a memorial to her. A few days later, Hoyle wrote to airport operator BAA, operators of London Heathrow Airport, urging them to change the airport&#x27;s name to Diana, Princess of Wales Airport. However, neither proposal was carried out.

Hoyle served as a member of the Trade and Industry Committee (later the Business Committee) from 1998 to 2010 and as a member of the European Scrutiny Committee from 2005 to 2010. He was previously the Honorary President of the All-Party British Gibraltar Group in Parliament (of which his father was the Treasurer) and a Vice Chair of the All-Party British Virgin Islands Group.

Hoyle was re-elected as MP for Chorley at the 2001 general election with a decreased vote share of 52.3% and a decreased majority of 8,444. He was again re-elected at the 2005 general election with a decreased vote share of 50.7% and a decreased majority of 7,625.

Hoyle clashed with then Prime Minister Tony Blair over issues such as Gibraltar and tuition fees. Regarding those clashes, Hoyle would say &quot;I&#x27;m not anti-Tony; he made us electable and won three times. But there are principles and promises you don&#x27;t break&quot;.

Hoyle voted against the Lisbon Treaty in 2008. He is one of the few MPs who have not revealed whether they voted Leave or Remain in the 2016 referendum.

===Chairman of Ways and Means===

At the 2010 general election, Hoyle was again re-elected with a decreased vote share of 43.2% and a decreased majority of 2,593.

Hoyle was elected Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons and Chairman of Ways and Means on 8 June 2010, the first time this appointment had been made by ballot of MPs, rather than by nomination of the Leader of the House. He was appointed to the Privy Council in January 2013.

On 20 March 2013, Hoyle won wide public acclaim for his handling of the Budget proceedings, which were frequently interrupted by jeering MPs.

Hoyle was again re-elected at the 2015 general election, with an increased vote share of 45.1% and an increased majority of 4,530.

In February 2017, Hoyle scolded SNP MPs for singing the European Anthem during the vote for the Brexit bill in the House of Commons, stating that he did not want parliament to turn into a sing-off. The same night, he had a clash with former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond in a heated exchange over whether Hoyle had cut off an SNP MP while speaking.

In March 2017, Hoyle called on social media companies to take swifter action to crack down on offensive posts, arguing it &quot;it could damage democracy and deter women from certain backgrounds from becoming MPs&quot;.

Hoyle was in the Speaker&#x27;s Chair during the terrorist attack in Westminster on 22 March 2017, and the subsequent suspension and lockdown of the Commons.

At the snap 2017 general election, Hoyle was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 55.3% and an increased majority of 7,512.

Hoyle was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for parliamentary and political services.

=== Speaker of the House of Commons (2019–present) ===


On 4 November 2019, Hoyle entered the election for Speaker to replace John Bercow. In the days leading up to the election, Hoyle was consistently seen by the media as the front runner. He maintained a substantial lead in the first, second, and third ballots of the election, but without reaching the required 50% to win outright.

Hoyle was elected Speaker on the fourth ballot, defeating Chris Bryant and winning 325 votes out of a total of 540 cast. Hoyle then duly received royal approbation in the House of Lords. In accordance with convention that the Speaker&#x27;s post is strictly non-partisan, following the election Hoyle rescinded his Labour membership.

In his acceptance speech, Hoyle stated that &quot;this House will change, but it will change for the better&quot;, and stated that he would be a &quot;transparent&quot; Speaker, also pledging to take the welfare of House of Commons staff seriously.

At the 2019 general election, Hoyle was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 67.3% and an increased majority of 17,392.

On 16 October 2021, Hoyle accompanied Boris Johnson, Keir Starmer and Priti Patel in laying wreaths at the church in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex where MP David Amess was murdered the day before.

In September 2022, Hoyle described the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II as &quot;the most important event the world will ever see&quot;. Hoyle&#x27;s comments received criticism. Graham Smith, CEO of the republican campaign group Republic, responded by saying that it was &quot;one of the most stupid things the world has ever heard&quot;. In the &quot;Indy100&quot;, Liam O&#x27;Dell wrote that Hoyle was ignoring current issues like the ongoing cost of living crisis and Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In December 2022, Hoyle voiced opposition to his former party&#x27;s plan of replacing the House of Lords with an elected upper chamber.

On 9 May 2023, Hoyle unveiled two new stained glass windows in the Speaker&#x27;s House, at the Palace of Westminster. One featuring his new personal coat of arms, with a rugby league ball, bees and Lancashire roses. The other window celebrates Britain&#x27;s Coat of Arms of all three Crown Dependencies and all sixteen British Overseas Territories. Hoyle said at the unveiling the windows were and &quot;will forever be tangible reminders of the strong, close links between the United Kingdom, the overseas territories and the crown dependencies&quot;. Adding &quot;The two windows represent part of our United Kingdom family&quot;.

Hoyle was again re-elected in the 2024 general election, with an increased vote share of 74.3% and an increased majority of 20,575.

On 9 July 2024 he was re-elected unopposed as speaker.

==== Criticism ====
===== Gaza Early Day Motion controversy =====
On 21 February 2024, Conservative MP William Wragg tabled an Early day motion (EDM) in the House of Commons stating &quot;That this House has no confidence in Mr Speaker&quot;. By 20 March the EDM had gained the support of 92 MPs, including 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady and parliamentary leader of the SNP Stephen Flynn. The motion effectively requests the Speaker to resign from his role. An SNP motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza had been submitted on one of the rare opposition days allotted to them. Hoyle was accused of breaking long-standing convention rules of the House and ignoring his own clerk&#x27;s legal advice by allowing a vote on each of the amendments from the Government and the Official Opposition (normally, when opposition day motions are considered, only an amendment from the Government is selected). The Speaker&#x27;s selection of amendments was viewed as partisan towards Labour. The Government withdrew their amendment at the last moment, ensuring that a vote would not take place in the Division lobby, instead Labour&#x27;s non-binding amendment was nodded through by default, without a vote. Hoyle later offered his regret and gave his apologies to the House and stated his intention to meet party leaders and whips, &quot;to discuss the way forward&quot;.

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; was critical of Hoyle&#x27;s actions saying, &quot;Lindsay stands accused of being partisan towards his former party — Labour&quot; adding that Hoyle had previously &quot;made it clear he wants to stay as Speaker after the election,&quot; the inference being that Labour would withdraw support for his re-election if their preferred amendment of a humanitarian ceasefire was denied. The Speaker was forced to deny in the Chamber that he had had a meeting with Labour advisor Sue Gray but admitted to meeting Keir Starmer, prior to his controversial amendment decision. Starmer said he &quot;simply urged&quot; the Speaker to ensure there was the &quot;broadest possible debate&quot; over calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.

The day after the debate, the Speaker attempted to placate Stephen Flynn, by renewing his apologies and offering the SNP an emergency debate under Standing Order 24. Flynn responded that he and his party had &quot;no confidence&quot; in the Speaker and he subsequently added his signature to Wragg&#x27;s EDM.

The SNP tabled a new motion, for an emergency debate on an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and Israel, calling on the UK Government to take &quot;concrete steps&quot; to push for a ceasefire. Hoyle rejected the new motion on 26 February and Flynn renewed his call for Hoyle to immediately step down. Flynn told the PA news agency: &quot;Last week the Speaker of the House of Commons broke the rules, this week he has broken his word.&quot; A &quot;furious&quot; Flynn said, &quot;If 30,000 dead Palestinians aren&#x27;t worthy of an emergency debate – what is?&quot; On 27 February, three Plaid Cymru MPs added their support to the &quot;No confidence motion&quot; followed in March by Independent MP Crispin Blunt. On 13 March, Lee Anderson, sitting as a Reform Party MP, withdrew his previous support for the EDM while sitting as a Conservative.

=====Ignoring Diane Abbott=====
On 13 March 2024, Diane Abbott sitting as an Independent MP, criticised Hoyle for denying her the opportunity to ask a question during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, when she was referred to by Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer in relation to Frank Hester&#x27;s alleged racist comments made about her in 2019. On 46 separate occasions she rose to her feet, to catch the Speaker&#x27;s attention, but was ignored. She later posted that &quot;Hoyle had failed both the Commons and democracy.&quot; Hoyle&#x27;s spokesperson responded by saying that PMQs &quot;takes place within a limited time frame, with the Chair prioritising members who are already listed on the order paper. This week – as is often the case – there was not enough time to call all members who wanted to ask a question&quot;.

==Personal life==

Hoyle lives in Adlington, Lancashire. As Speaker of the House of Commons he has an official residence at Speaker&#x27;s House, at the northeast corner of the Palace of Westminster, which is used for official functions and meetings and which has private accommodation in a four-bedroom apartment upstairs.

Hoyle has been married twice and has had two daughters. He was married from 1974 to Lynda Anne Fowler; they divorced in 1982. In June 1993, Hoyle married Catherine Swindley, who succeeded him as the Labour Councillor for Adlington in May 1998. He has also employed his wife as his part-time constituency secretary. Hoyle&#x27;s elder daughter, Emma Fox, used to work at his constituency office, in which capacity she represented him at Chorley Borough Council.

Hoyle and Conservative Maldon District Councillor Miriam Lewis also had a daughter, Natalie Lewis-Hoyle, a Conservative parish councillor who was found hanged in her bedroom, in December 2017, at the age of 28. Hoyle said he was &quot;truly devastated&quot; by her death. An inquest subsequently returned an open conclusion verdict as to the cause of her death. Shortly before the 2019 general election, he revealed that he had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.

Away from politics, he is a supporter of his local football league team, Bolton Wanderers, and rugby league team Warrington Wolves. He currently serves as president of the Rugby Football League.

Hoyle has described himself as an animal lover and has a number of pets, which he has named after notable figures in British political history. Amongst them are his parrot Boris (after former Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson), his tortoise Maggie (after Margaret Thatcher) and Attlee (Clement Attlee), his brown tabby Maine Coon cat who spends time in the House off Commons. In July 2024, he announced the addition of another cat called Clem, a black cat with Bengal markings, and suggested, &quot;I think we should have cats across the House that look after the rodent population&quot;. He also operates an Instagram page for Attlee, where he regularly shares pictures of cat in the House of Commons. On 15 February 2024 Hoyle presented a Guinness World Record certificate to the 192-year-old giant tortoise Jonathan, the world&#x27;s oldest living land animal, during a visit to the island of St Helena.

From his father&#x27;s ennoblement in 1997 he was entitled to the style of The Honourable. He gained the style of The Right Honourable when sworn into the Privy Council on 12 February 2013. Hoyle was appointed as the Chancellor of the University of Gibraltar in 2020.

Hoyle&#x27;s father Doug Hoyle died in April 2024 at the age of 98.

In January 2025 Hoyle made a guest appearance, in a cameo role as a Lancastrian rambler, in the ITV soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, to celebrate its 10,000th edition.

<text>Kevin Michael Hughes (15 December 1952 – 16 July 2006) was a British Labour politician. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Doncaster North from 1992 to 2005. He served as a government whip and was previously a coal miner and official for the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).

==Background==
Hughes was born in Doncaster in 1952, the son of a coal miner. He was educated at Owston Park secondary modern and took up his father&#x27;s profession in 1970. He remained a miner until 1990 and attended University of Sheffield for three years under a day-release scheme.

==Political career==
Originally a communist, he joined the New Communist Party in 1977 but left to join the Labour Party in 1978. He served as a branch delegate and member of the Yorkshire area committee of the NUM. He was elected as a member of Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council in 1986 and elected to Parliament in the 1992 general election for the safe Labour seat of Doncaster North. As an MP, he was sponsored by the NUM, although the number of working coal pits in his constituency had been reduced from 6 to only 1. He campaigned on pit safety issues before the privatisation of British Coal in the early 1990s.

Despite allegations being made against him by fellow councillor Ron Rose, Hughes avoided blame in the &quot;Donnygate&quot; scandal, which resulted in 21 former members of Doncaster council being convicted for fraud offences. He retained his seat in the House of Commons in 1997, despite being opposed by an &quot;anti-fraud&quot; candidate, and again in 2001. He became a whip for the opposition in 1996 and was a junior whip in the Labour government from 1997 to 2001. He was viewed as a Blairite and vigorously supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

During a November 2001 debate in Parliament, Hughes expressed support for anti-terrorism legislation following the September 11 attacks, with a comment which became famous for disparaging left-liberal readers of &quot;The Guardian&quot; who opposed such measures:
==Personal life==
Hughes married Lynda Saunders in 1972, and they had a son and a daughter together. His son joined the Army and served in the 2003 Gulf War.

Hughes stood down early from Parliament in 2005 after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease. He died in Doncaster on 16 July 2006, at the age of 53.

<doc id="434668" wikidata="Q222116" url="?curid=434668" title="John Boyd Dunlop">
<text>John Boyd Dunlop (5 February 1840 – 23 October 1921) was a Scottish inventor and veterinary surgeon who spent most of his career in Ireland. Familiar with making rubber devices, he invented the first practical pneumatic tyres for his child&#x27;s tricycle and developed them for use in cycle racing. He sold his rights to the pneumatic tyres to a company he formed with the president of the Irish Cyclists&#x27; Association, Harvey du Cros, for a small cash sum and a small shareholding in their pneumatic tyre business. Dunlop withdrew in 1896. The company that bore his name, Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company, was not incorporated until later and, despite its name, was Du Cros&#x27;s creation.

==Veterinary practice==
He was born on a farm in Dreghorn, North Ayrshire, and studied to be a veterinary surgeon at the Dick Vet, University of Edinburgh, moving to Downpatrick, Ireland now in Northern Ireland, in 1867.

Quite early in his life he was told he had been a premature birth, two months before his mother had expected. He convinced himself his health was delicate and throughout his life acted accordingly, but he had no serious illness until he contracted a chill in October 1921 aged 81 and died unexpectedly. Sir Arthur Du Cros described him as a diffident and gentle-mannered man but confident in his abilities.

He married Margaret Stevenson in 1871 and they had a daughter and a son. He established Downe Veterinary Clinic in Downpatrick with his brother James Dunlop before moving to a practice in 38–42 May Street, Belfast where, by the mid 1880s, his was one of the largest practices in Ireland. Downpatrick is now in Northern Ireland.

Dunlop developed pneumatic tyres for his son&#x27;s tricycle and soon had them made commercially in Scotland. A cyclist using his tyres began to win all races and drew the attention of Harvey Du Cros. Dunlop sold his rights into a new business with Du Cros for some cash and a small shareholding. With Du Cros he overcame many difficulties experienced by their business, including the loss of his patent rights. In 1892 he retired from his veterinary practice and moved to Dublin soon after Harvey Du Cros with his assistance successfully refloated Booth Bros of Dublin as the Pneumatic Tyre and Booth&#x27;s Cycle Agency. The pneumatic tyre revolutionised the bicycle industry, which had boomed after the 1885 introduction of J K Starley&#x27;s safety bicycle.

J B Dunlop sold out in 1895 and took no further interest in the tyre or rubber business. His remaining business interest was a local drapery.

==Pneumatic tyres==

In October 1887, John Boyd Dunlop developed the first practical pneumatic or inflatable tyre for his son&#x27;s tricycle and, using his knowledge and experience with rubber, in the yard of his home in Belfast fitted it to a wooden disc 96 centimetres across. The tyre was an inflated tube of sheet rubber. He then took his wheel and a metal wheel from his son&#x27;s tricycle and rolled both across the yard together. The metal wheel stopped rolling but the pneumatic continued until it hit a gatepost and rebounded. Dunlop then put pneumatics on both rear wheels of the tricycle. That too rolled better, and Dunlop moved on to larger tyres for a bicycle &quot;with even more startling results.&quot; He tested that in Cherryvale sports ground, South Belfast, and a patent was granted on 7 December 1888. Unknown to Dunlop another Scot, Robert William Thomson from Stonehaven, had patented a pneumatic tyre in 1847.

Willie Hume demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop&#x27;s tyres in 1889, winning the tyre&#x27;s first-ever races in Ireland and then England. The captain of the Belfast Cruisers Cycling Club, he became the first member of the public to purchase a bicycle fitted with pneumatic tyres, so Dunlop suggested he should use them in a race. On 18 May 1889 Hume won all four cycling events at the Queen&#x27;s College Sports in Belfast, and a short while later in Liverpool, won all but one of the cycling events. Among the losers were sons of the president of the Irish Cyclists&#x27; Association, Harvey Du Cros. Seeing an opportunity, Du Cros built a personal association with J B Dunlop, and together they set up a company which acquired his rights to his patent.

Two years after he was granted the patent, Dunlop was officially informed that it was invalid as Scottish inventor Robert William Thomson (1822–1873), had patented the idea in France in 1846 and in the US in 1847. (see Tyres.) To capitalise on pneumatic tyres for bicycles, Dunlop and Du Cros resuscitated a Dublin-listed company and renamed it Pneumatic Tyre and Booth&#x27;s Cycle Agency. Dunlop retired in 1895. In 1896 Du Cros sold their whole bicycle tyre business to British financier Terah Hooley for £3 million. Hooley arranged some new window-dressing, titled board members, etc., and re-sold the company to the public for £5 million. Du Cros remained head of the business until his death. Early in the 20th century it was renamed Dunlop Rubber.

Though he did not participate after 1895, Dunlop&#x27;s pneumatic tyre did arrive at a crucial time in the development of road transport. His commercial production of cycle tyres began in late 1890 in Belfast, but the production of car tyres did not begin until 1900, well after his retirement. J B Dunlop did not make any great fortune by his invention.

==Death and legacy==

John Boyd Dunlop died at his home in Dublin&#x27;s Ballsbridge in 1921 and is buried in Deans Grange Cemetery.

Although the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company no longer exists as a corporate entity, the Dunlop name lives on in a number of Dunlop-branded products, including automotive, aerospatial, industrial and sporting products around the world. The Dunlop brand commonly appears as a corporate sponsor of international sporting events such as motor racing and tennis matches.

From the 1980s, Dunlop was commemorated in Northern Ireland when his image featured on the £10 banknote issued by the Northern Bank as part of its Inventor Series. The notes have been re-issued several times, and the banknotes bearing Dunlop&#x27;s likeness (now issued by the Danske Bank) are still in circulation today.

In 2005, Dunlop was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame.

An avenue in the city of Campinas, in southeast Brazil, is also named after him; that is because a Dunlop tyre factory was established there in 1953.

John Boyd Dunlop has been commemorated with a blue plaque by the Ulster Historical Circle for inventing the first successful pneumatic tyre. https://openplaques.org/plaques/1333

<text>Alan Arthur Hurst (2 September 1945 – 31 January 2023) was a British solicitor and Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Braintree in Essex from 1997 to 2005.

==Early life==
Hurst was born in Southend, the son of George Hurst. He attended Westcliff High School for Boys in Westcliff-on-Sea. From the University of Liverpool, he gained a BA in History.

Before being elected an MP, he had been deputy leader of Southend-on-Sea Council, joining the council in 1968. He continued to practise part-time as a solicitor while an MP. In 1993, he was elected to Essex County Council for the Orsett &amp; Stifford division.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1997 general election, he caused a stir by overturning Tony Newton&#x27;s majority of 17,494, with a majority of 1,494; Braintree had been Conservative since the 1955 election. Almost as surprising (though not with hindsight, since the Tories made next to no progress nationally in 2001) was his holding the seat at the 2001 general election, though this time with a majority of 358, making it Labour&#x27;s second-most marginal victory at that election and the sixth-most overall. He lost the seat in the 2005 general election to Brooks Newmark of the Conservative Party.

Hurst never held government office, remaining a backbencher. He served on the select committee for agriculture for a time (including during the 2001 foot and mouth crisis) and then on the Speaker&#x27;s Panel. He occasionally rebelled against the government, often on judicial issues, though not on any high-profile issues or as part of any major rebellions, with the exception of supporting an amendment to the top-up fees bill (Higher Education Act 2004) which would have removed such fees from the bill whilst maintaining other aspects of it, an attempt to have the bill&#x27;s increased funding for universities without higher fees (presumably by putting up the basic or higher rate of income tax or introducing a graduate tax); the government claimed that the greater funding (almost, though not quite, universally accepted to be necessary) could only be achieved with top-up fees, so the choice was fees or continuing underfunding, but many saw this as a false dichotomy imposed by the government (which had pledged not to raise income tax – indeed, had cut it in its first term – and had already raised National Insurance contributions once, though this move was very popular) to hold funding hostage, as it were, and ensure the bill&#x27;s passing. This rebellion was not overly important, as the much larger rebellion on the bill&#x27;s second reading had already failed (by a mere five votes). He did vote for a total ban on hunting with dogs when the government was proposing mere restriction, but this was not, strictly speaking, a rebellion as it was a free vote.

==Personal life==
Hurst married in July 1969 and had one son in 1974. Hurst married Hilary Burch in 1976; they had a son and a daughter.

Hurst died in Southend on 31 January 2023 at the age of 77.

<doc id="434673" wikidata="Q5198223" url="?curid=434673" title="Cyclic order">
<text>In mathematics, a cyclic order is a way to arrange a set of objects in a circle. Unlike most structures in order theory, a cyclic order is not modeled as a binary relation, such as &quot;&quot;. One does not say that east is &quot;more clockwise&quot; than west. Instead, a cyclic order is defined as a ternary relation , meaning &quot;after , one reaches before &quot;. For example, [June, October, February], but not [June, February, October], cf. picture. A ternary relation is called a cyclic order if it is cyclic, asymmetric, transitive, and connected. Dropping the &quot;connected&quot; requirement results in a partial cyclic order.

A set with a cyclic order is called a cyclically ordered set or simply a cycle. Some familiar cycles are discrete, having only a finite number of elements: there are seven days of the week, four cardinal directions, twelve notes in the chromatic scale, and three plays in rock-paper-scissors. In a finite cycle, each element has a &quot;next element&quot; and a &quot;previous element&quot;. There are also cyclic orders with infinitely many elements, such as the oriented unit circle in the plane.

Cyclic orders are closely related to the more familiar linear orders, which arrange objects in a line. Any linear order can be bent into a circle, and any cyclic order can be cut at a point, resulting in a line. These operations, along with the related constructions of intervals and covering maps, mean that questions about cyclic orders can often be transformed into questions about linear orders. Cycles have more symmetries than linear orders, and they often naturally occur as residues of linear structures, as in the finite cyclic groups or the real projective line.

==Finite cycles==

A cyclic order on a set with elements is like an arrangement of on a clock face, for an -hour clock. Each element in has a &quot;next element&quot; and a &quot;previous element&quot;, and taking either successors or predecessors cycles exactly once through the elements as .

There are a few equivalent ways to state this definition. A cyclic order on is the same as a permutation that makes all of into a single cycle, which is a special type of permutation - a circular permutation. Alternatively, a cycle with elements is also a -torsor: a set with a free transitive action by a finite cyclic group. Another formulation is to make into the standard directed cycle graph on vertices, by some matching of elements to vertices.

It can be instinctive to use cyclic orders for symmetric functions, for example as in

where writing the final monomial as would distract from the pattern.

A substantial use of cyclic orders is in the determination of the conjugacy classes of free groups. Two elements and of the free group on a set are conjugate if and only if, when they are written as products of elements and with in , and then those products are put in cyclic order, the cyclic orders are equivalent under the rewriting rules that allow one to remove or add adjacent and .

A cyclic order on a set can be determined by a linear order on , but not in a unique way. Choosing a linear order is equivalent to choosing a first element, so there are exactly linear orders that induce a given cyclic order. Since there are possible linear orders (as in permutations), there are possible cyclic orders (as in circular permutations).

==Definitions==
An infinite set can also be ordered cyclically. Important examples of infinite cycles include the unit circle, , and the rational numbers, . The basic idea is the same: we arrange elements of the set around a circle. However, in the infinite case we cannot rely upon an immediate successor relation, because points may not have successors. For example, given a point on the unit circle, there is no &quot;next point&quot;. Nor can we rely upon a binary relation to determine which of two points comes &quot;first&quot;. Traveling clockwise on a circle, neither east or west comes first, but each follows the other.

Instead, we use a ternary relation denoting that elements , , occur after each other (not necessarily immediately) as we go around the circle. For example, in clockwise order, [east, south, west]. By currying the arguments of the ternary relation , one can think of a cyclic order as a one-parameter family of binary order relations, called &quot;cuts&quot;, or as a two-parameter family of subsets of , called &quot;intervals&quot;.

===The ternary relation===
The general definition is as follows: a cyclic order on a set is a relation , written , that satisfies the following axioms:
#Cyclicity: If then 
#Asymmetry: If then not 
#Transitivity: If and then 
#Connectedness: If , , and are distinct, then either or 

The axioms are named by analogy with the asymmetry, transitivity, and connectedness axioms for a binary relation, which together define a strict linear order. considered other possible lists of axioms, including one list that was meant to emphasize the similarity between a cyclic order and a betweenness relation. A ternary relation that satisfies the first three axioms, but not necessarily the axiom of totality, is a partial cyclic order.

===Rolling and cuts===
Given a linear order on a set , the cyclic order on induced by is defined as follows:
: if and only if or or 

Two linear orders induce the same cyclic order if they can be transformed into each other by a cyclic rearrangement, as in
cutting a deck of cards. One may define a cyclic order relation as a ternary relation that is induced by a strict linear order as above.

Cutting a single point out of a cyclic order leaves a linear order behind. More precisely, given a cyclically ordered set formula_1, each element formula_2 defines a natural linear order formula_3 on the remainder of the set, formula_4, by the following rule:

Moreover, formula_3 can be extended by adjoining formula_6 as a least element; the resulting linear order on formula_7 is called the principal cut with least element formula_6. Likewise, adjoining formula_6 as a greatest element results in a cut formula_10.

===Intervals===
Given two elements formula_11, the open interval from formula_6 to formula_13, written formula_14, is the set of all formula_15 such that formula_16. The system of open intervals completely defines the cyclic order and can be used as an alternate definition of a cyclic order relation.

An interval formula_14 has a natural linear order given by formula_3. One can define half-closed and closed intervals formula_19, formula_20, and formula_21 by adjoining formula_6 as a least element and/or formula_13 as a greatest element. As a special case, the open interval formula_24 is defined as the cut formula_25.

More generally, a proper subset formula_26 of formula_7 is called convex if it contains an interval between every pair of points: for formula_28, either formula_14 or formula_30 must also be in formula_26. A convex set is linearly ordered by the cut formula_32 for any formula_33 not in the set; this ordering is independent of the choice of formula_33.

===Automorphisms===
As a circle has a clockwise order and a counterclockwise order, any set with a cyclic order has two senses. A bijection of the set that preserves the order is called an ordered correspondence. If the sense is maintained as before, it is a direct correspondence, otherwise it is called an opposite correspondence. Coxeter uses a separation relation to describe cyclic order, and this relation is strong enough to distinguish the two senses of cyclic order. The automorphisms of a cyclically ordered set may be identified with C2, the two-element group, of direct and opposite correspondences.

==Monotone functions==
The &quot;cyclic order = arranging in a circle&quot; idea works because any subset of a cycle is itself a cycle. In order to use this idea to impose cyclic orders on sets that are not actually subsets of the unit circle in the plane, it is necessary to consider functions between sets.

A function between two cyclically ordered sets, , is called a &quot;monotonic function&quot; or a &quot;homomorphism&quot; if it pulls back the ordering on : whenever , one has . Equivalently, is monotone if whenever and , and are all distinct, then . A typical example of a monotone function is the following function on the cycle with 6 elements:
:

A function is called an &quot;embedding&quot; if it is both monotone and injective. Equivalently, an embedding is a function that pushes forward the ordering on : whenever , one has . As an important example, if is a subset of a cyclically ordered set , and is given its natural ordering, then the inclusion map is an embedding.

Generally, an injective function from an unordered set to a cycle induces a unique cyclic order on that makes an embedding.

===Functions on finite sets===
A cyclic order on a finite set can be determined by an injection into the unit circle, . There are many possible functions that induce the same cyclic order—in fact, infinitely many. In order to quantify this redundancy, it takes a more complex combinatorial object than a simple number. Examining the configuration space of all such maps leads to the definition of an polytope known as a cyclohedron. Cyclohedra were first applied to the study of knot invariants; they have more recently been applied to the experimental detection of periodically expressed genes in the study of biological clocks.

The category of homomorphisms of the standard finite cycles is called the cyclic category; it may be used to construct Alain Connes&#x27; cyclic homology.

One may define a degree of a function between cycles, analogous to the degree of a continuous mapping. For example, the natural map from the circle of fifths to the chromatic circle is a map of degree 7. One may also define a rotation number.

=== Completion ===
* A cut with both a least element and a greatest element is called a &quot;jump&quot;. For example, every cut of a finite cycle is a jump. A cycle with no jumps is called &quot;dense&quot;.
* A cut with neither a least element nor a greatest element is called a &quot;gap&quot;. For example, the rational numbers have a gap at every irrational number. They also have a gap at infinity, i.e. the usual ordering. A cycle with no gaps is called &quot;complete&quot;.
* A cut with exactly one endpoint is called a &quot;principal&quot; or &quot;Dedekind&quot; cut. For example, every cut of the circle is a principal cut. A cycle where every cut is principal, being both dense and complete, is called &quot;continuous&quot;.

The set of all cuts is cyclically ordered by the following relation: if and only if there exist such that:
: , and

A certain subset of this cycle of cuts is the Dedekind completion of the original cycle.

==Further constructions==
=== Unrolling and covers ===
Starting from a cyclically ordered set , one may form a linear order by unrolling it along an infinite line. This captures the intuitive notion of keeping track of how many times one goes around the circle. Formally, one defines a linear order on the Cartesian product , where is the set of integers, by fixing an element and requiring that for all :
: If , then .
For example, the months 2025, 2025, 2025, and 2026 occur in that order.

This ordering of is called the universal cover of . Its order type is independent of the choice of , but the notation is not, since the integer coordinate &quot;rolls over&quot; at . For example, although the cyclic order of pitch classes is compatible with the A-to-G alphabetical order, C is chosen to be the first note in each octave, so in note-octave notation, B3 is followed by C4.

The inverse construction starts with a linearly ordered set and coils it up into a cyclically ordered set. Given a linearly ordered set and an order-preserving bijection with unbounded orbits, the orbit space is cyclically ordered by the requirement:
: If , then .
In particular, one can recover by defining on .

There are also -fold coverings for finite ; in this case, one cyclically ordered set covers another cyclically ordered set. For example, the is a double cover of the . In geometry, the pencil of rays emanating from a point in the oriented plane is a double cover of the pencil of unoriented lines passing through the same point. These covering maps can be characterized by lifting them to the universal cover.

===Products and retracts===
Given a cyclically ordered set and a linearly ordered set , the (total) lexicographic product is a cyclic order on the product set , defined by if one of the following holds:
* and 
* and 
* and 
* and 

The lexicographic product globally looks like and locally looks like ; it can be thought of as copies of . This construction is sometimes used to characterize cyclically ordered groups.

One can also glue together different linearly ordered sets to form a circularly ordered set. For example, given two linearly ordered sets and , one may form a circle by joining them together at positive and negative infinity. A circular order on the disjoint union } is defined by , where the induced ordering on is the opposite of its original ordering. For example, the set of all longitudes is circularly ordered by joining all points west and all points east, along with the prime meridian and the 180th meridian. use this construction while characterizing the spaces of orderings and real places of double formal Laurent series over a real closed field.

==Topology==
The open intervals form a base for a natural topology, the cyclic order topology. The open sets in this topology are exactly those sets which are open in &quot;every&quot; compatible linear order. To illustrate the difference, in the set [0, 1), the subset [0, 1/2) is a neighborhood of 0 in the linear order but not in the cyclic order.

Interesting examples of cyclically ordered spaces include the conformal boundary of a simply connected Lorentz surface and the leaf space of a lifted essential lamination of certain 3-manifolds. Discrete dynamical systems on cyclically ordered spaces have also been studied.

The interval topology forgets the original orientation of the cyclic order. This orientation can be restored by enriching the intervals with their induced linear orders; then one has a set covered with an atlas of linear orders that are compatible where they overlap. In other words, a cyclically ordered set can be thought of as a locally linearly ordered space: an object like a manifold, but with order relations instead of coordinate charts. This viewpoint makes it easier to be precise about such concepts as covering maps. The generalization to a locally partially ordered space is studied in ; see also &quot;Directed topology&quot;.

==Related structures==
===Groups===

A cyclically ordered group is a set with both a group structure and a cyclic order, such that left and right multiplication both preserve the cyclic order. Cyclically ordered groups were first studied in depth by Ladislav Rieger in 1947. They are a generalization of cyclic groups: the infinite cyclic group and the finite cyclic groups . Since a linear order induces a cyclic order, cyclically ordered groups are also a generalization of linearly ordered groups: the rational numbers , the real numbers , and so on. Some of the most important cyclically ordered groups fall into neither previous category: the circle group and its subgroups, such as the subgroup of rational points.

Every cyclically ordered group can be expressed as a quotient , where is a linearly ordered group and is a cyclic cofinal subgroup of . Every cyclically ordered group can also be expressed as a subgroup of a product , where is a linearly ordered group. If a cyclically ordered group is Archimedean or compact, it can be embedded in itself.

===Modified axioms===
A partial cyclic order is a ternary relation that generalizes a (total) cyclic order in the same way that a partial order generalizes a total order. It is cyclic, asymmetric, and transitive, but it need not be total. An order variety is a partial cyclic order that satisfies an additional &quot;spreading&quot; axiom. Replacing the asymmetry axiom with a complementary version results in the definition of a &quot;co-cyclic order&quot;. Appropriately total co-cyclic orders are related to cyclic orders in the same way that is related to .

A cyclic order obeys a relatively strong 4-point transitivity axiom. One structure that weakens this axiom is a CC system: a ternary relation that is cyclic, asymmetric, and total, but generally not transitive. Instead, a CC system must obey a 5-point transitivity axiom and a new &quot;interiority&quot; axiom, which constrains the 4-point configurations that violate cyclic transitivity.

A cyclic order is required to be symmetric under cyclic permutation, , and asymmetric under reversal: . A ternary relation that is &quot;asymmetric&quot; under cyclic permutation and &quot;symmetric&quot; under reversal, together with appropriate versions of the transitivity and totality axioms, is called a betweenness relation. A separation relation is a quaternary relation that can be thought of as a cyclic order without an orientation. The relationship between a circular order and a separation relation is analogous to the relationship between a linear order and a betweenness relation.

==Symmetries and model theory==

These conditions are analogues of o-minimality and weak o-minimality for the case of linearly ordered structures. continues with some characterizations of ω-categorical structures.

==Cognition==
Hans Freudenthal has emphasized the role of cyclic orders in cognitive development, as a contrast to Jean Piaget who addresses only linear orders. Some experiments have been performed to investigate the mental representations of cyclically ordered sets, such as the months of the year.

==Notes on usage==
The relation may be called a &quot;cyclic order&quot; , a &quot;circular order&quot; , a &quot;cyclic ordering&quot; , or a &quot;circular ordering&quot; . Some authors call such an ordering a &quot;total cyclic order&quot; , a &quot;complete cyclic order&quot; , a &quot;linear cyclic order&quot; , or an &quot;l-cyclic order&quot; or ℓ-&quot;cyclic order&quot; , to distinguish from the broader class of partial cyclic orders, which they call simply &quot;cyclic orders&quot;. Finally, some authors may take &quot;cyclic order&quot; to mean an unoriented quaternary separation relation .

A set with a cyclic order may be called a &quot;cycle&quot; or a &quot;circle&quot; . The above variations also appear in adjective form: &quot;cyclically ordered set&quot; (&quot;cyklicky uspořádané množiny&quot;, ), &quot;circularly ordered set&quot;, &quot;total cyclically ordered set&quot;, &quot;complete cyclically ordered set&quot;, &quot;linearly cyclically ordered set&quot;, &quot;l-cyclically ordered set&quot;, ℓ-&quot;cyclically ordered set&quot;. All authors agree that a cycle is totally ordered.

There are a few different symbols in use for a cyclic relation. uses concatenation: . and use ordered triples and the set membership symbol: . uses concatenation and set membership: , understanding as a cyclically ordered triple. The literature on groups, such as and , tend to use square brackets: . use round parentheses: , reserving square brackets for a betweenness relation. use a function-style notation: . Rieger (1947), cited after ) uses a &quot;less-than&quot; symbol as a delimiter: . Some authors use infix notation: , with the understanding that this does not carry the usual meaning of and for some binary relation &lt; . emphasizes the cyclic nature by repeating an element: .

 calls an embedding an &quot;isomorphic embedding&quot;.

In this case, write that is &quot;rolled up&quot;.

The map &quot;T&quot; is called &quot;archimedean&quot; by , &quot;coterminal&quot; by , and a &quot;translation&quot; by .

 calls the &quot;universal cover&quot; of . write that is &quot;coiled&quot;. call the &quot;∞-times covering&quot; of . Often this construction is written as the anti-lexicographic order on .

<text>Per Teodor Cleve (10 February 1840 – 18 June 1905) was a Swedish chemist, biologist, mineralogist and oceanographer. He is best known for his discovery of the chemical elements holmium and thulium.

Born in Stockholm in 1840, Cleve earned his BSc and PhD from Uppsala University in 1863 and 1868, respectively. After receiving his PhD, he became an assistant professor of chemistry at the university. He later became professor of general and agricultural chemistry. In 1874 he theorised that didymium was in fact two elements; this theory was confirmed in 1885 when Carl Auer von Welsbach discovered neodymium and praseodymium. 

In 1879 Cleve discovered holmium and thulium. His other contributions to chemistry include the discovery of aminonaphthalenesulfonic acids, also known as Cleve&#x27;s acids. From 1890 on he focused on biological studies. He developed a method of determining the age and order of late glacial and postglacial deposits from the types of diatom fossils in the deposits, and wrote a seminal text in the field of oceanography. He died in 1905 at age 65.

==Early life==

Cleve was born in Stockholm, Sweden, as the thirteenth child of his father, a merchant known as Fredrik Theodor Cleve. Cleve&#x27;s ancestors on his father&#x27;s side came from western Germany and settled in Sweden in the late 18th century.

Cleve showed interest in natural science and natural history from an early age. He attended the Stockholms Lyceum in 1858, studying chemistry and biology. He gained a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Uppsala in 1863 and a PhD from the same university in 1868.

==Career==
In 1860, aged 20, Cleve became assistant professor of mineralogy at the University of Uppsala, and was appointed assistant professor of chemistry in 1868. He also taught at the Royal Institute of Technology between 1870 and 1874, and eventually became professor of general and agricultural chemistry at the University of Uppsala. He was the chair of chemistry at the University of Uppsala starting in 1874. He was also the president of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry.

Cleve&#x27;s first work was &quot;Några ammoniakaliska chromföreningar&quot; (&quot;Some compounds of ammonia and chromium&quot;, 1861). He also wrote several more papers on complex compounds, including the compounds of platinum. Additionally, Cleve synthesized several hundred complex platinum compounds.

Cleve visited a number of laboratories in England, France, Italy, and Switzerland in the 1860s. While in Paris, he visited the laboratory of Charles-Adolphe Wurtz and also made a number of friends there.
Cleve worked on the synthesis of complex chemical compounds until 1872. He theorized in 1874 that the element didymium consisted of two elements. This theory was proven right with the discovery of praseodymium and neodymium in 1885 by Carl Auer von Welsbach. In 1879, Cleve proved that the newly discovered element scandium was an element predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev to be &quot;eka-boron&quot;. He isolated a quantity of scandium in this same year and determined its atomic weight. He discovered the element holmium in 1879 by examining a sample of erbium oxide. While removing impurities from a sample of erbium oxide, Cleve discovered a brown substance and a green substance, and the brown substance was holmium oxide (the green substance was thulium oxide). However, this sample may have been impure. He separated thulium from an erbium oxide sample in 1879. Additionally, Cleve and Abraham Langlet discovered helium in the mineral cleveite in 1895.

Cleve discovered six forms of dichloronaphthalene and discovered aminonaphthalenesulfonic acids, which are sometimes named after him. He prepared a number of nitrosulfonic acids as well. In 1883, Cleve was the first person to describe the plankton species &quot;Nitzschia seriata&quot;. In 1890, Cleve began to mainly focus on the field of biology, mainly studying freshwater algae, diatoms, and plankton. Cleve participated in a Swedish expedition to Spitsbergen in 1898. While on this mission, he discovered a number of species of spumellarians, nassellarians, and phaeodarians. With Johann Diedrich Möller he issued and distributed an exsiccata-like series of microscope slides under the title &quot;Diatoms edited by P. T. Cleve and J. D. Möller&quot;.

Cleve, in collaboration with 
Otto Höglund 
prepared numerous previously-undiscovered salts of yttrium and erbium. The two also did work on the chemistry of the chemical elements thorium and lanthanum. By 1874, Cleve discovered that thorium was a element and also determined lanthanum to be . These findings were initially doubted by the scientific community.

Cleve was the first observer of isomerism in platinumamine derivatives.

Additionally, Cleve created a method of dating glacial and post-glacial deposits in the fossil record.

Cleve&#x27;s PhD dissertation was &quot;Mineral-analytiska under-sökningar&quot;. He wrote a paper on samarium in 1879 and &quot;The Seasonal Distribution of Atlantic Plankton Organisms&quot; in 1900. In 1883, he published &quot;Kemiskt Handlexicon&quot;, which translates to &quot;Chemical Handbook&quot;. Notable students of Cleve include Ellen Fries (the first Swedish woman to earn a PhD) and Svante Arrhenius (a winner of the Nobel Prize).

Cleve also studied hydrography and geology.

==Personal life, family, and death==
In 1874, Cleve married Carolina Alma &quot;Caralma&quot; Öhbom (known as Alma Cleve), a teacher and author; the couple had three daughters. The first daughter, Astrid Maria Cleve (born 22 January 1875), became a botanist. His son-in-law and grandson, Hans von Euler-Chelpin and Ulf von Euler, both won Nobel Prizes. Cleve was friends with Thomas Edward Thorpe. The second daughter, Agnes Cleve-Jonand (born Agnes Elisabet Cleve) (1876-1951), was a visual artist and pioneer of Modernism in Sweden. The third and last daughter, Célie Brunius (born Gerda Cecilia Afrodite Cleve) (1882-1980), was a journalist. His daughter Agnes was married to illustrator, set designer and artist John Jon-And. His daughter Célie was married to writer August Brunius and was the mother of artist Göran Brunius, journalist Clas Brunius and associate professor Teddy Brunius. The television host and politician Lisette Schulman was his great-granddaughter.

Per Teodore Cleve was a supporter of women&#x27;s equality and Ellen Fries, the first Swedish woman to receive a PhD, was one of his students.

Cleve began experiencing pleurisy in December 1904 and it affected his heart. He thought that he had recovered by the spring of 1905, and he returned home to Uppsala, Sweden. but he died there on 18 June 1905.

==Awards and legacy==
Cleve joined the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1871. He received a Davy Medal in 1894 and 1904.

The mineral cleveite is named for Cleve.

<text>Humanitarian aid is material and logistic assistance, usually in the short-term, to people in need. Among the people in need are the homeless, refugees, and victims of natural disasters, wars, and famines. The primary objective of humanitarian aid is to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity.

While often used interchangeably, humanitarian aid and humanitarian assistance are distinct concepts. Humanitarian aid generally refers to the provision of immediate, short-term relief in crisis situations, such as food, water, shelter, and medical care. Humanitarian assistance, on the other hand, encompasses a broader range of activities, including longer-term support for recovery, rehabilitation, and capacity building. Humanitarian aid is distinct from development aid, which seeks to address underlying socioeconomic factors.

Humanitarian aid can come from either local or international communities through international non-governmental organizations (INGOs). In reaching out to international communities, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) of the United Nations (UN) is responsible for coordination responses to emergencies. It taps to the various members of Inter-Agency Standing Committee, whose members are responsible for providing emergency relief. The four UN entities that have primary roles in delivering humanitarian aid are United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Programme (WFP).According to the &quot;Global Humanitarian Overview&quot; of OCHA, nearly 300 million people need humanitarian assistance and protection in 2024, or 1 out of 27 people worldwide. In 2024, the estimated global humanitarian response requirements amount to approximately US$46.4 billion, targeting around 188 million of the most vulnerable people in 69 countries. The three major drivers of humanitarian needs worldwide are conflicts, climate-related disasters, and economic factors.

== Types ==

=== Food aid ===
Food aid is a type of aid whereby food that is given to countries in urgent need of food supplies, especially if they have just experienced a natural disaster. Food aid can be provided by importing food from the donor, buying food locally, or providing cash.

The welfare impacts of any food aid-induced changes in food prices are decidedly mixed, underscoring the reality that it is impossible to generate only positive intended effects from an international aid program.

==== Changed consumption patterns ====
Food aid that is relatively inappropriate to local uses can distort consumption patterns. Food aid is usually exported from temperate climate zones and is often different than the staple crops grown in recipient countries, which usually have a tropical climate. The logic of food export inherently entails some effort to change consumers&#x27; preferences, to introduce recipients to new foods and thereby stimulate demand for foods with which recipients were previously unfamiliar or which otherwise represent only a small portion of their diet.

Massive shipments of wheat and rice into the West African Sahel during the food crises of the mid-1970s and mid-1980s were widely believed to stimulate a shift in consumer demand from indigenous coarse grains – millet and sorghum – to western crops such as wheat. During the 2000 drought in northern Kenya, the price of changaa (a locally distilled alcohol) fell significantly and consumption seems to have increased as a result. This was a result of grain food aid inflows increasing the availability of low-cost inputs to the informal distilling industry.

==== Natural resource overexploitation ====
Recent research suggests that patterns of food aid distribution may inadvertently affect the natural environment, by changing consumption patterns and by inducing locational change in grazing and other activities. A pair of studies in Northern Kenya found that food aid distribution seems to induce greater spatial concentration of livestock around distribution points, causing localized rangeland degradation, and that food aid provided as whole grain requires more cooking, and thus more fuelwood is consumed, stimulating local deforestation.

=== Medical humanitarian aid ===

There are different kinds of medical humanitarian aid, including: providing medical supplies and equipment; sending professionals to an affected region; and long-term training for local medical staff. Such aid emerged when international organizations stepped in to respond to the need of national governments for global support and partnership to address natural disasters, wars, and other crises that impact people&#x27;s health. Often, a humanitarian aid organization would clash with a government&#x27;s approach to the unfolding domestic conflict. In such cases, humanitarian aid organizations have sought out autonomy to extend help regardless of political or ethnic affiliation.

==== Limitations ====
Humanitarian medical aid as a sector possesses several limitations. First, multiple organizations often exist to solve the same problem. Rather than collaborating to address a given situation, organizations frequently interact as competitors, which creates bottlenecks for treatment and supplies. A second limitation is how humanitarian organizations are focused on a specific disaster or epidemic, without a plan for whatever might come next; international organizations frequently enter a region, provide short term aid, and then exit without ensuring local capacity to maintain or sustain this medical care. Finally, humanitarian medical aid assumes a biomedical approach which does not always account for the alternative beliefs and practices about health and well-being in the affected regions. This problem is rarely explored as most studies conducted are done from the lens of the donor or Westernized humanitarian organization rather than the recipient country&#x27;s perspective. Discovering ways of encouraging locals to embrace bio-medicinal approaches while simultaneously respecting a given people&#x27;s culture and beliefs remains a major challenge for humanitarian aid organizations; in particular as organizations constantly enter new regions as crises occur. However, understanding how to provide aid cohesively with existing regional approaches is necessary in securing the local peoples&#x27; acceptance of the humanitarian aid&#x27;s work.

== Funding sources ==

Aid is funded by donations from individuals, corporations, governments and other organizations. The funding and delivery of humanitarian aid is increasingly international, making it much faster, more responsive, and more effective in coping to major emergencies affecting large numbers of people (e.g. see Central Emergency Response Fund). The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) coordinates the international humanitarian response to a crisis or emergency pursuant to Resolution 46/182 of the United Nations General Assembly. The need for aid is ever-increasing and has long outstripped the financial resources available.

The Central Emergency Response Fund was created at the 2005 Central Emergency Response Fund at the United Nations General Assembly.

== Delivery of humanitarian aid ==
=== Methods of delivery ===

Humanitarian aid spans a wide range of activities, including providing food aid, shelter, education, healthcare or protection. The majority of aid is provided in the form of in-kind goods or assistance, with cash and vouchers constituting only 6% of total humanitarian spending. However, evidence has shown how cash transfers can be better for recipients as it gives them choice and control, they can be more cost-efficient and better for local markets and economies.

It is important to note that humanitarian aid is not only delivered through aid workers sent by bilateral, multilateral or intergovernmental organizations, such as the United Nations. Actors like the affected people themselves, civil society, local informal first-responders, civil society, the diaspora, businesses, local governments, military, local and international non-governmental organizations all play a crucial role in a timely delivery of humanitarian aid.

How aid is delivered can affect the quality and quantity of aid. Often in disaster situations, international aid agencies work in hand with local agencies. There can be different arrangements on the role these agencies play, and such arrangement affects the quality of hard and soft aid delivered.

=== Humanitarian access ===
Securing access to humanitarian aid in post-disasters, conflicts, and complex emergencies is a major concern for humanitarian actors. To win assent for interventions, aid agencies often espouse the principles of humanitarian impartiality and neutrality. However, gaining secure access often involves negotiation and the practice of humanitarian diplomacy. In the arena of negotiations, humanitarian diplomacy is ostensibly used by humanitarian actors to try to persuade decision makers and leaders to act, at all times and in all circumstances, in the interest of vulnerable people and with full respect for fundamental humanitarian principles. However, humanitarian diplomacy is also used by state actors as part of their foreign policy.

=== United Nations&#x27; response ===
The UN implements a multifaceted approach to assist migrants and refugees throughout their relocation process. This includes children&#x27;s integration into the local education system, food security, and access to health services. The approach also encompasses humanitarian transportation, the goal of which is to ensure migrants and refugees retain access to basic goods and services and the labour market. Basic needs, including access to shelter, clean water, and child protection, are supplemented by the UN&#x27;s efforts to facilitate social integration and legal regularization for displaced individuals.

=== Use of technology and data ===
Since the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, the institutional and operational focus of humanitarian aid has been on leveraging technology to enhance humanitarian action, ensuring that more formal relationships are established, and improving the interaction between formal humanitarian organizations such as the United Nations (UN) Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and informal volunteer and technological communities known as digital humanitarians.

The recent rise in Big Data, high-resolution satellite imagery and new platforms powered by advanced computing have already prompted the development of crisis mapping to help humanitarian organizations make sense of the vast volume and velocity of information generated during disasters. For example, crowdsourcing maps (such as OpenStreetMap) and social media messages in Twitter were used during the 2010 Haiti Earthquake and Hurricane Sandy to trace leads of missing people, infrastructure damages and raise new alerts for emergencies.

=== Gender and humanitarian aid ===
Even prior to a humanitarian crisis, gender differences exist. Women have limited access to paid work, are at risk of child marriage, and are more exposed to Gender based violence, such as rape and domestic abuse. Conflict and natural disasters exacerbate women&#x27;s vulnerabilities. When delivering humanitarian aid, it is thus important for humanitarian actors, such as the United Nations, to include challenges specific to women in their humanitarian response. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee provides guidelines for humanitarian actors on how be inclusive of gender as a factor when delivering humanitarian aid. It recommends agencies to collect data disaggregated by sex and age to better understand which group of the population is in need of what type of aid. In recent years, the United Nations have been using sex and age disaggregated data more and more, consulting with gender specialists. In the assessment phase, several UN agencies meet to compile data and work on a humanitarian response plan. Throughout the plans. women specific challenges are listed and sex and age disaggregated data are used so when they deliver aid to a country facing a humanitarian crisis, girls and women can have access to the appropriate aid they need.

== Problematic aspects ==
=== Economic distortions due to food aid ===
Some of the unintended effects of food aid include labor and production disincentives, changes in recipients&#x27; food consumption patterns and natural resources use patterns, distortion of social safety nets, distortion of NGO operational activities, price changes, and trade displacement. These issues arise from targeting inefficacy and poor timing of aid programs. Food aid can harm producers by driving down prices of local products, whereas the producers are not themselves beneficiaries of food aid. Unintentional harm occurs when food aid arrives or is purchased at the wrong time, when food aid distribution is not well-targeted to food-insecure households, and when the local market is relatively poorly integrated with broader national, regional and global markets.

Food aid can drive down local or national food prices in at least three ways.

# First, monetization of food aid can flood the market, increasing supply. In order to be granted the right to monetize, operational agencies must demonstrate that the recipient country has adequate storage facilities and that the monetized commodity will not result in a substantial disincentive in either domestic agriculture or domestic marketing.
# Second, households receiving aid may decrease demand for the commodity received or for locally produced substitutes or, if they produce substitutes or the commodity received, they may sell more of it. This can be most easily understood by dividing a population in a food aid recipient area into subpopulations based on two criteria: whether or not they receive food aid (recipients vs. non-recipients) and whether they are net sellers or net buyers of food. Because the price they receive for their output is lower, however, net sellers are unambiguously worse off if they do not receive food aid or some other form of compensatory transfer.
# Finally, recipients may sell food aid to purchase other necessities or complements, driving down prices of the food aid commodity and its substitutes, but also increasing demand for complements. Most recipient economies are not robust and food aid inflows can cause large price decreases, decreasing producer profits, limiting producers&#x27; abilities to pay off debts and thereby diminishing both capacity and incentives to invest in improving agricultural productivity. However, food aid distributed directly or through FFW programs to households in northern Kenya during the lean season can foster increased purchase of agricultural inputs such as improved seeds, fertilizer and hired labor, thereby increasing agricultural productivity. Labor distortion can arise when Food-For-Work (FFW) Programs are more attractive than work on recipients&#x27; own farms/businesses, either because the FFW pays immediately, or because the household considers the payoffs to the FFW project to be higher than the returns to labor on its own plots. Food aid programs hence take productive inputs away from local private production, creating a distortion due to substitution effects, rather than income effects.

Beyond labor disincentive effects, food aid can have the unintended consequence of discouraging household-level production. Poor timing of aid and FFW wages that are above market rates cause negative dependency by diverting labor from local private uses, particularly if FFW obligations decrease labor on a household&#x27;s own enterprises during a critical part of the production cycle. This type of disincentive impacts not only food aid recipients but also producers who sell to areas receiving food aid flows.

FFW programs are often used to counter a perceived dependency syndrome associated with freely distributed food. However, poorly designed FFW programs may cause more risk of harming local production than the benefits of free food distribution. In structurally weak economies, FFW program design is not as simple as determining the appropriate wage rate. Empirical evidence from rural Ethiopia shows that higher-income households had excess labor and thus lower (not higher as expected) value of time, and therefore allocated this labor to FFW schemes in which poorer households could not afford to participate due to labor scarcity. Similarly, FFW programs in Cambodia have shown to be an additional, not alternative, source of employment and that the very poor rarely participate due to labor constraints.

=== Increasing existing conflicts ===
In addition to post-conflict settings, a large portion of aid is often directed at countries currently undergoing conflicts. However, the effectiveness of humanitarian aid, particularly food aid, in conflict-prone regions has been criticized in recent years. There have been accounts of humanitarian aid being not only inefficacious but actually fuelling conflicts in the recipient countries. Aid stealing is one of the prime ways in which conflict is promoted by humanitarian aid. Aid can be seized by armed groups, and even if it does reach the intended recipients, &quot;it is difficult to exclude local members of a local militia group from being direct recipients if they are also malnourished and qualify to receive aid.&quot;

Furthermore, analyzing the relationship between conflict and food aid, recent research shows that the United States food aid promoted civil conflict in recipient countries on average. An increase in United States&#x27; wheat aid increased the duration of armed civil conflicts in recipient countries, and ethnic polarization heightened this effect. However, since academic research on aid and conflict focuses on the role of aid in post-conflict settings, the aforementioned finding is difficult to contextualize. Nevertheless, research on Iraq shows that &quot;small-scale [projects], local aid spending ... reduces conflict by creating incentives for average citizens to support the government in subtle ways.&quot; Similarly, another study also shows that aid flows can &quot;reduce conflict because increasing aid revenues can relax government budget constraints, which can [in return] increase military spending and deter opposing groups from engaging in conflict.&quot; Thus, the impact of humanitarian aid on conflict may vary depending upon the type and mode in which aid is received, and, &quot;inter alia,&quot; the local socio-economic, cultural, historical, geographical and political conditions in the recipient countries.

==== Increasing conflict duration ====
International aid organizations identify theft by armed forces on the ground as a primary unintended consequence through which food aid and other types of humanitarian aid promote conflict. Food aid usually has to be transported across large geographic territories and during the transportation it becomes a target for armed forces, especially in countries where the ruling government has limited control outside of the capital. Accounts from Somalia in the early 1990s indicate that between 20 and 80 percent of all food aid was stolen, looted, or confiscated. In the former Yugoslavia, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) lost up to 30 percent of the total value of aid to Serbian armed forces. On top of that 30 percent, bribes were given to Croatian forces to pass their roadblocks in order to reach Bosnia.

The value of the stolen or lost provisions can exceed the value of the food aid alone since convoy vehicles and telecommunication equipment are also stolen. MSF Holland, international aid organization operating in Chad and Darfur, underscored the strategic importance of these goods, stating that these &quot;vehicles and communications equipment have a value beyond their monetary worth for armed actors, increasing their capacity to wage war&quot;

A famous instance of humanitarian aid unintentionally helping rebel groups occurred during the Nigeria-Biafra civil war in the late 1960s, where the rebel leader Odumegwu Ojukwu only allowed aid to enter the region of Biafra if it was shipped on his planes. These shipments of humanitarian aid helped the rebel leader to circumvent the siege on Biafra placed by the Nigerian government. These stolen shipments of humanitarian aid caused the Biafran civil war to last years longer than it would have without the aid, claim experts.

The most well-known instances of aid being seized by local warlords in recent years come from Somalia, where food aid is funneled to the Shabab, a Somali militant group that controls much of Southern Somalia. Moreover, reports reveal that Somali contractors for aid agencies have formed a cartel and act as important power brokers, arming opposition groups with the profits made from the stolen aid&quot;

Rwandan government appropriation of food aid in the early 1990s was so problematic that aid shipments were canceled multiple times. In Zimbabwe in 2003, Human Rights Watch documented examples of residents being forced to display ZANU-PF Party membership cards before being given government food aid. In eastern Zaire, leaders of the Hema ethnic group allowed the arrival of international aid organizations only upon agreement not give aid to the Lendu (opposition of Hema). Humanitarian aid workers have acknowledged the threat of stolen aid and have developed strategies for minimizing the amount of theft en route. However, aid can fuel conflict even if successfully delivered to the intended population as the recipient populations often include members of rebel groups or militia groups, or aid is &quot;taxed&quot; by such groups.

Academic research emphatically demonstrates that on average food aid promotes civil conflict. Namely, increase in US food aid leads to an increase in the incidence of armed civil conflict in the recipient country. Another correlation demonstrated is food aid prolonging existing conflicts, specifically among countries with a recent history of civil conflict. However, this does not find an effect on conflict in countries without a recent history of civil conflict. Moreover, different types of international aid other than food which is easily stolen during its delivery, namely technical assistance and cash transfers, can have different effects on civil conflict.

Community-driven development (CDD) programs have become one of the most popular tools for delivering development aid. In 2012, the World Bank supported 400 CDD programs in 94 countries, valued at US$30 billion. Academic research scrutinizes the effect of community-driven development programs on civil conflict. The Philippines&#x27; flagship development program KALAHI-CIDSS is concluded to have led to an increase in violent conflict in the country. After the program&#x27;s initiation, some municipalities experienced a statistically significan large increase in casualties, as compared to other municipalities who were not part of the CDD. as a result, casualties suffered by government forces from insurgent-initiated attacks increased significantly.

These results are consistent with other examples of humanitarian aid exacerbating civil conflict. One explanation is that insurgents attempt to sabotage CDD programs for political reasons – successful implementation of a government-supported project could weaken the insurgents&#x27; position. Related findings of Beath, Christia, and Enikolopov further demonstrate that a successful community-driven development program increased support for the government in Afghanistan by exacerbating conflict in the short term, revealing an unintended consequence of the aid.

=== Waste and corruption in humanitarian aid ===
Waste and corruption are hard to quantify, in part because they are often taboo subjects, but they appear to be significant in humanitarian aid. For example, it has been estimated that over $8.75  billion was lost to waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement in the Hurricane Katrina relief effort. Non-governmental organizations have in recent years made great efforts to increase participation, accountability and transparency in dealing with aid, yet humanitarian assistance remains a poorly understood process to those meant to be receiving it—much greater investment needs to be made into researching and investing in relevant and effective accountability systems.

However, there is no clear consensus on the trade-offs between speed and control, especially in emergency situations when the humanitarian imperative of saving lives and alleviating suffering may conflict with the time and resources required to minimise corruption risks. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have highlighted the need to tackle corruption with, but not limited to, the following methods:

# Resist the pressure to spend aid rapidly.
# Continue to invest in audit capacity, beyond simple paper trails;
# Establish and verify the effectiveness of complaints mechanisms, paying close attention to local power structures, security and cultural factors hindering complaints;
# Clearly explain the processes during the targeting and registration stages, highlighting points such as the fact that people should not make payments to be included, photocopy and read aloud any lists prepared by leaders or committees.

=== Abuse of power by aid workers ===
Reports of sexual exploitation and abuse in humanitarian response have been reported following humanitarian interventions in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone in 2002, in Central African Republic and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

2021 reporting on a Racial Equity Index report indicated that just under two-thirds of aid workers have experienced racism and 98% of survey respondents witnessed racism.

=== Contrary practice ===
Countries or war parties that prevent humanitarian relief are generally under unanimous criticism. Such was the case for the Derg regime, preventing relief to the population of Tigray in the 1980s, and the prevention of relief aid in the Tigray War of 2020–2021 by the Abiy Ahmed Ali regime of Ethiopia was again widely condemned.

===Humanitarian aid in conflict zones===
== Aid workers ==

Aid workers are people who are distributed internationally to do humanitarian aid work.

=== Composition ===
The total number of humanitarian aid workers around the world has been calculated by ALNAP, a network of agencies working in the Humanitarian System, as 210,800 in 2008. This is made up of roughly 50% from NGOs, 25% from the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement and 25% from the UN system. In 2010, it was reported that the humanitarian fieldworker population increased by approximately 6% per year over the previous 10 years.

=== Psychological issues ===
Aid workers are exposed to tough conditions and have to be flexible, resilient, and responsible in an environment that humans are not psychologically supposed to deal with, in such severe conditions that trauma is common. In recent years, a number of concerns have been raised about the mental health of aid workers.

The most prevalent issue faced by humanitarian aid workers is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Adjustment to normal life again can be a problem, with feelings such as guilt being caused by the simple knowledge that international aid workers can leave a crisis zone, whilst nationals cannot.

A 2015 survey conducted by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, with aid workers of the Global Development Professionals Network, revealed that 79 percent experienced mental health issues.

===Attacks===
== Standards ==
The humanitarian community has initiated a number of interagency initiatives to improve accountability, quality and performance in humanitarian action. Four of the most widely known initiatives are, ALNAP, the CHS Alliance, the Sphere Project and the Core Humanitarian Standard on Quality and Accountability (CHS). Representatives of these initiatives began meeting together on a regular basis in 2003 in order to share common issues and harmonise activities where possible.

=== Sphere Project ===

The Sphere Project handbook, &quot;Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response,&quot; which was produced by a coalition of leading non-governmental humanitarian agencies, lists the following principles of humanitarian action:
* The right to life with dignity
* The distinction between combatant and non-combatants
* The principle of non-refoulement

=== Core Humanitarian Standard on Quality and Accountability ===

Another humanitarian standard used is the Core Humanitarian Standard on Quality and Accountability (CHS). It was approved by the CHS Technical Advisory Group in 2014, and has since been endorsed by many humanitarian actors such as &quot;the Boards of the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (HAP), People in Aid and the Sphere Project&quot;. It comprises nine core standards, which are complemented by detailed guidelines and indicators.

While some critics were questioning whether the sector will truly benefit from the implementation of yet another humanitarian standard, others have praised it for its simplicity. Most notably, it has replaced the core standards of the Sphere Handbook and it is regularly referred to and supported by officials from the United Nations, the EU, various NGOs and institutes.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

The beginnings of organized international humanitarian aid can be traced to the late 19th century. Early campaigns include British aid to distressed populations on the continent and in Sweden during the Napoleonic Wars, and the international relief campaigns during the Great Irish Famine in the 1840s.

In 1854, when the Crimean War began Florence Nightingale and her team of 38 nurses arrived to Barracks Hospital of Scutari where there were thousands of sick and wounded soldiers. Nightingale and her team watched as the understaffed military hospitals struggled to maintain hygienic conditions and meet the needs of patients. Ten times more soldiers were dying of disease than from battle wounds. Typhus, typhoid, cholera and dysentery were common in the army hospitals. Nightingale and her team established a kitchen, laundry and increased hygiene. More nurses arrived to aid in the efforts and the General Hospital at Scutari was able to care for 6,000 patients.
Nightingale&#x27;s contributions still influence humanitarian aid efforts. This is especially true in regard to Nightingale&#x27;s use of statistics and measures of mortality and morbidity. Nightingale used principles of new science and statistics to measure progress and plan for her hospital. She kept records of the number and cause of deaths in order to continuously improve the conditions in hospitals. Her findings were that in every 1,000 soldiers, 600 were dying of communicable and infectious diseases. She worked to improve hygiene, nutrition and clean water and decreased the mortality rate from 60% to 42% to 2.2%. All of these improvements are pillars of modern humanitarian intervention. Once she returned to Great Britain she campaigned for the founding of the Royal Commission on the Health of the Army. She advocated for the use of statistics and coxcombs to portray the needs of those in conflict settings.
The most well-known origin story of formalized humanitarian aid is that of Henri Dunant, a Swiss businessman and social activist, who upon seeing the sheer destruction and inhumane abandonment of wounded soldiers from the Battle of Solferino in June 1859, canceled his plans and began a relief response. Despite little to no experience as a medical physician, Dunant worked alongside local volunteers to assist the wounded soldiers from all warring parties, including Austrian, Italian and French casualties, in any way he could including the provision of food, water, and medical supplies. His graphic account of the immense suffering he witnessed, written in his book &quot;A Memory of Solferino&quot;, became a foundational text to modern humanitarianism.

&quot;A Memory of Solferino&quot; changed the world in a way that no one, let alone Dunant, could have foreseen nor truly appreciated at the time. To start, Dunant was able to profoundly stir the emotions of his readers by bringing the battle and suffering into their homes, equipping them to understand the current barbaric state of war and treatment of soldiers after they were injured or killed; in of themselves these accounts altered the course of history. Beyond this, in his two-week experience attending to the wounded soldiers of all nationalities, Dunant inadvertently established the vital conceptual pillars of what would later become the International Committee of the Red Cross and International Humanitarian Law: impartiality and neutrality. Dunant took these ideas and came up with two more ingenious concepts that would profoundly alter the practice of war; first Dunant envisioned a creation of permanent volunteer relief societies, much like the ad hoc relief group he coordinated in Solferino, to assist wounded soldiers; next Dunant began an effort to call for the adoption of a treaty which would guarantee the protection of wounded soldiers and any who attempted to come to their aid.

After publishing his foundational text in 1862, progress came quickly for Dunant and his efforts to create a permanent relief society and International Humanitarian Law. The embryonic formation of the International Committee of the Red Cross had begun to take shape in 1863 when the private Geneva Society of Public Welfare created a permanent sub-committee called &quot;The International Committee for Aid to Wounded in Situations of War&quot;. Composed of five Geneva citizens, this committee endorsed Dunant&#x27;s vision to legally neutralize medical personnel responding to wounded soldiers. The constitutive conference of this committee in October 1863 created the statutory foundation of the International Committee of the Red Cross in their resolutions regarding national societies, caring for the wounded, their symbol, and most importantly the indispensable neutrality of ambulances, hospitals, medical personnel and the wounded themselves. Beyond this, in order to solidify humanitarian practice, the Geneva Society of Public Welfare hosted a convention between 8 and 22 August 1864 at the Geneva Town Hall with 16 diverse States present, including many governments of Europe, the Ottoman Empire, the United States of America (USA), Brazil and Mexico. This diplomatic conference was exceptional, not due to the number or status of its attendees but rather because of its very raison d&#x27;être. Unlike many diplomatic conferences before it, this conference&#x27;s purpose was not to reach a settlement after a conflict nor to mediate between opposing interests; indeed this conference was to lay down rules for the future of conflict with aims to protect medical services and those wounded in battle.

The first of the renowned Geneva Conventions was signed on 22 August 1864; never before in history has a treaty so greatly impacted how warring parties engage with one another. The basic tenents of the convention outlined the neutrality of medical services, including hospitals, ambulances, and related personnel, the requirement to care for and protect the sick and wounded during the conflict and something of particular symbolic importance to the International Committee of the Red Cross: the Red Cross emblem. For the first time in contemporary history, it was acknowledged by a representative selection of states that war had limits. The significance only grew with time in the revision and adaptation of the Geneva Convention in 1906, 1929 and 1949; additionally, supplementary treaties granted protection to hospital ships, prisoners of war and most importantly to civilians in wartime.

The International Committee of the Red Cross exists to this day as the guardian of International Humanitarian Law and as one of the largest providers of humanitarian aid in the world.

=== Late 19th century ===

Internationally organized humanitarian aid efforts continued to be launched for the rest of the century, often with ever-greater logistical acumen and experience. In 1876, after a drought led to cascading crop failures across Northern China, a famine broke out that lasted several years—during its course as many as 10 million people may have died from hunger and disease. British missionary Timothy Richard first called international attention to the famine in Shandong in the summer of 1876 and appealed to the foreign community in Shanghai for money to help the victims. The Shandong Famine Relief Committee was soon established, with those participating including diplomats, businessmen, as well as Christian missionaries, Catholic and Protestant alike. An international network was set up to solicit donations, ultimately bringing in 204,000 silver taels, the equivalent of $7–10 million if valued at 2012 silver prices.

Simultaneously in India, another campaign was launched in response to the Great Famine of 1876–78. Retrospectively, authorities from across the administrative and colonial structures of the British Raj and princely states have been to various degrees blamed for the shocking severity of the famine, with critiques revolving around their laissez-faire attitude and the resulting lack of any adequate policy to address the mass death and suffering across the subcontinent, though meaningful relief measures began to be introduced towards the famine&#x27;s end. Privately, a famine relief fund was set up in the United Kingdom, raising £426,000 within its first few months of operation.

=== Early 20th century ===
Intertwined with and informed efforts related to the profound destruction and disruption caused by World War I, including that of the Red Cross and Red Crescent organization, the Russian famine of 1921–1922, taking place in a country already immensely burdened with systemic agriculture and logistical struggles—then ravaged by successive periods of industrial war, blockade, bad harvests, the Russian Revolution, its resulting political restructuring and social upheaval, and then the insurgency and war communism of the Russian Civil War that followed. In the nascent Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Vladimir Lenin allowed his personal friend and acclaimed thinker Maxim Gorky to pen an open letter to the international community asking for relief for the Russian people. Despite the ongoing ideological, material, and military conflicts levied by both the new socialist state and the capitalist international community towards one another, efforts to aid the starving population of Soviet Russia were intensive, deliberate, and effective. American efforts, led in large part future president Herbert Hoover, as well as those by the International Committee for Russian Relief joined extant humanitarian organizations in delivering food and medicine to Russia over the course of 1921 and 1922, at some points feeding over 10 millions Russians every day. With the United States left relatively untouched by World War I, its intensive private and public efforts in Russia constituted a clear expression of its new paramount soft power on the international stage, with power projection from European states having been either totally destroyed or severely limited in scope in the years following the conflict.

=== 1980s ===

Early attempts were in private hands and were limited in their financial and organizational capabilities. It was only in the 1980s, that global news coverage and celebrity endorsement were mobilized to galvanize large-scale government-led famine (and other forms of) relief in response to disasters around the world. The 1983–85 famine in Ethiopia caused upwards of 1 million deaths and was documented by a BBC news crew, with Michael Buerk describing &quot;a biblical famine in the 20th Century&quot; and &quot;the closest thing to hell on Earth&quot;.

Live Aid, a 1985 fund-raising effort headed by Bob Geldof induced millions of people in the West to donate money and to urge their governments to participate in the relief effort in Ethiopia. Some of the proceeds also went to the famine hit areas of Eritrea.

=== 2000s ===
A 2004 reform initiative by Jan Egeland, resulted in the creation of the Humanitarian Cluster System, designed to improve coordination between humanitarian agencies working on the same issues.

=== 2010s ===

==== World Humanitarian Summit ====
The first global summit on humanitarian diplomacy was held in 2016 in Istanbul, Turkey. An initiative of United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the World Humanitarian Summit included participants from governments, civil society organizations, private organizations, and groups affected by humanitarian need. Issues that were discussed included: preventing and ending conflict, managing crises, and aid financing.

Attendees at the summit agreed a series of reforms on aid spending called the Grand Bargain, including a commitment to spend 25% of aid funds directly through local and national humanitarian aid organizations.

COVID-19 Pandemic

Following the outburst of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, approximately 216 million individuals required humanitarian aid across 69 countries. Many efforts and reforms of humanitarian assistance were made following the pandemic to the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== 2020s ===
In 2020, there was an exponential increase in humanitarian needs, with 235 million people, or 1 in 33 individuals globally, requiring humanitarian assistance and protection by the year&#x27;s end. A report documented an 85% increase in humanitarian air during 2020 then the year before.

<text>The year 1751 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events.

==Astronomy==
* The globular cluster &quot;47 Tucanae&quot; (or 47 Tuc), visible with the unaided eye from the southern hemisphere, is discovered by the French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, who catalogues it in his list of southern nebulous objects: at a distance of 16000 lightyears, it has a total mass nearly 1 million times the Sun&#x27;s mass and is 120 light years across, making it appear in the sky as wide as the full moon.

==Biology==
* Linnaeus publishes his &quot;Philosophia Botanica&quot;, the first textbook of descriptive systematic botanical taxonomy and the first appearance of his binomial nomenclature.

==Chemistry==
* Nickel (symbol Ni, atomic weight 58.71, atomic number 28) is discovered, in the mineral nickeline, by chemist Axel Fredrik Cronstedt in Stockholm, Sweden (although nickel was used in coins in China as early as 235 BCE).

==Medicine and physiology==
* May 11 – Pennsylvania Hospital founded in Philadelphia by Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Bond, the first in the United States.
* Newcastle Infirmary founded in Newcastle upon Tyne, England.
* The pupil reflex is discovered: it is the first reflex of the human body to be discovered.

==Publications==
* Commencement of publication in Paris of the &quot;Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers&quot; edited by Denis Diderot and Jean d&#x27;Alembert.
* 1st edition of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Experiments and Observations on Electricity&quot; is published.

==Awards==
* Copley Medal: John Canton

==Births==
* April 5 – Maria Lullin, Swiss entomologist (died 1822)
* March 3 – Pierre Prévost, Swiss philosopher and physicist (died 1839)
* March 17 – Anders Dahl, Swedish botanist (died 1789)
* June 3 or 29 – William Roxburgh, Scottish surgeon and botanist, &quot;father of Indian botany&quot; (died 1815)
* July 1 – Antide Janvier, French precision clockmaker (died 1835)
* December 10 – George Shaw, English naturalist (died 1813)

==Deaths==
* June 9 – John Machin, English mathematician and astronomer (born c. 1686)
* August 22 – Andrew Gordon, Scottish-born Benedictine monk, physicist and inventor (born 1712)
* August 30 – Christopher Polhem, Swedish scientist and inventor (born 1661)
* November 30 – Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux, Swiss mathematician and astronomer (born 1718)

<text>The list of lakes of Sweden contains the major lakes in the nation of Sweden. However, Sweden has 22,600 lakes larger than 0.1 km² (100,000 m²) and over 97,500 lakes larger than , so the list is far from comprehensive. Using 0.1km² surface area as the measuring limit, Sweden place fifth on Countries with most lakes in the world. The great number of lakes in southern Sweden could according to Alfred Gabriel Nathorst be indebted to the creation of basins due to the stripping of an irregular mantle of weathered rock by glacier erosion.

Its capital is the city of İzmir, which is in itself composed of the province&#x27;s central 11 districts out of 30 in total. To the west, it is surrounded by the Aegean Sea, and it encloses the Gulf of Izmir. Its area is , and its population is 4,462,056 (2022). Neighboring provinces are Balıkesir to the north, Manisa to the east, and Aydın to the south. The traffic code of the province is 35.

Major rivers of the province include the Küçük Menderes river, Koca Çay (with Güzelhisar dam), and Bakırçay.

==History==
It is one of the oldest cities and ports of ancient Ionia in the Mediterranean Sea. The original settlement was founded around 3000 BC, and the city has survived through different iterations to this day. It was inhabited by Greek populations from antiquity until the destruction of Smyrna in 1922 and the exchange of populations that followed with the Treaty of Lausanne. In its long history it has changed location twice. 

The first location (prehistoric times) was mentioned by Strabo as &quot;Old Smyrna&quot; and the second location was built by Alexander the Great and his descendants (Hellenistic period). Ionians, in about 11th century BC, established the League of Ionia. It was later conquered by the Persians and retaken by the Greeks before being subsumed into the Roman Empire. In Roman times it became very prosperous and the Romans honored it three times with the praiseworthy title of &quot;young girl&quot; because of its amazing prosperity. 

The term &quot;Catholic Church&quot; was first used in 110 in a letter from St. Ignatius of Antioch to the Church of Smyrna. After the split of the Roman Empire, the area became part of what is now called the Byzantine Empire until it was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in the 14th century. In 1424, Smyrna was conquered by the Ottomans. However, before and after its occupation, Venetians and Genoese tried several times to include it in their Republics.

On September 13, 1472, the Venetians, under Pietro Mocenigo, captured and destroyed the city, in a failed attempt. Following the First World War, the province was ceded to Greece, but was retaken by the forces of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in the Turkish War of Independence.

As a result of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, all Greek Orthodox inhabitants of the province were deported, and İzmir Province was incorporated into the modern republic of Turkey.

An earthquake on 30 October 2020 killed 117 people in the area.

=== Archaeology ===
In January 2021, archaeologists headed by Elif Koparal, announced the discovery of the ruins of a 2500 year-old temple of Aphrodite from the 5th century BC in the Urla-Çeşme peninsula. Among other findings in and around the temple, they found a statue piece depicting a woman, a terracotta female head and an inscription that reads, &quot;This is the sacred area&quot;. The traces of the temple were first excavated in 2016.

Heath ran for the deputy leadership of the Liberal Democrats in 2006 and came third in the first round.

In March 2008 Heath was one of three Liberal Democrat spokesmen to defy the party whip and vote in favour of a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon, for which he was sacked from his frontbench role. In October 2008 he was given a partial reprieve when he was chosen to lead a Liberal Democrat commission on privacy in the UK, and in January 2009 he was reappointed as spokesman on the office of the Leader of the House of Commons. In 2010, he was re-elected as MP for Somerton and Frome.

<doc id="434703" wikidata="Q2426048" url="?curid=434703" title="Tommy McAvoy">
<text>Thomas McLaughlin McAvoy, Baron McAvoy, (14 December 1943 – 8 March 2024) was a British Labour and Co-operative politician serving as a life peer in the House of Lords from 2010 until his death in 2024. He served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Rutherglen from 1987 to 2005, and Rutherglen and Hamilton West from 2005 to 2010.

McAvoy held several positions in the Government Whips&#x27; Office under the Blair and Brown governments, serving as Comptroller of the Household from 1997 to 2008 and Treasurer of the Household from 2008 to 2010. He entered the Lords after choosing not to seek re-election to the Commons, where he served as an opposition spokesperson for Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as a senior whip. McAvoy held the position of Lords opposition chief whip from 2018 to 2021 after serving as Deputy Chief Whip from 2015 to 2018.

== Early life and career ==
McAvoy was born in Rutherglen, Lanarkshire, on 14 December 1943. He worked in a pawnbrokers, as a storeman at the Hoover factory in Cambuslang, and was a shop steward for the Amalgamated Engineering Union; following the succession of trade union mergers, he was a member of Unite the Union (Amicus Section).

In 1982, McAvoy was elected to Strathclyde Regional Council, and served until 1987.

== Parliamentary career ==
McAvoy was elected to Parliament in 1987 as the Scottish Labour and Co-operative Member for Glasgow Rutherglen. Along with Robert Brown of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, he successfully campaigned for his hometown (an independent royal burgh from the 1100s to the 1970s) to be removed from the district of Glasgow and allocated to South Lanarkshire ahead of local authority re-organisation in 1994, via a local referendum. From 2005 to 2010, he sat as the member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West.

McAvoy was an opposition whip from 1990 to 1993 and again from 1996 to 1997.

When the Labour Party came into government in 1997, McAvoy was appointed Comptroller of HM Household, the third highest position in the Government Whips&#x27; office. He retained the same job until 2008, becoming one of the longest serving Comptrollers in history. He was appointed to the Privy Council in 2003. In October 2008, he was promoted to Treasurer of the Household and Deputy Chief Whip.

McAvoy achieved the rare feat among whips of remaining popular with Labour MPs. An early day motion in July 2006 noted &quot;the difficult task he has of securing government business whilst accommodating the parliamentary, political and personal requirements of 352 Labour colleagues&quot; and congratulated him for &quot;the respect he has earned from all sides of the House for his ability to perform these duties&quot;; it was signed by 135 MPs.

On 20 February 2010, McAvoy announced that he would stand down at the next general election. The seat was retained by Labour with the election of Tom Greatrex. On 22 June 2010, McAvoy was created a life peer as Baron McAvoy, of Rutherglen in Lanarkshire, and was introduced in the House of Lords that day.

McAvoy remains to this day the longest serving Government Whip in the history of parliament with 13 years and 10 days service in the Government Whips Office. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;...[his] personal crusades have been for peace in Northern Ireland and against abortion&quot; (Andrew Roth, &quot;The Guardian&quot;).

After his introduction to the Lords, he served as a senior whip. In 2012, he took on the role of Opposition Spokesman for Scotland and Northern Ireland. In May 2015, after the election of Angela Smith as Leader of the Opposition in the Lords, he took over as Opposition Deputy Chief Whip in House of Lords, serving with Denis Tunnicliffe.

On 24 January 2018, he was elected Labour Chief Whip in the House of Lords and therefore Opposition Chief Whip, taking over from Steve Bassam.

McAvoy was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 2022 New Year Honours for political and public service.

==Personal life==
McAvoy and his wife Eleanor were married in 1968 in , Rutherglen, and had four sons. He was a school friend of Bobby Murdoch, later a successful footballer with Celtic and Scotland.

His brother Eddie is a retired local politician who also worked at Hoover and subsequently served as the leader of South Lanarkshire Council from 1999 to 2017.

Tommy McAvoy died on 8 March 2024, at the age of 80.

<text>Christine McCafferty (&quot;née&quot; Livesley; born 14 October 1945) is a British Labour Party politician who was Member of Parliament (MP) for Calder Valley from 1997 to 2010 when she retired.

==Early life==
Born in Manchester, she attended Whalley Range High School in Whalley Range, Manchester, then Footscray High School in Melbourne, Australia. She worked as welfare worker for disabled people for the Manchester Community Health Service from 1963 to 1970. From 1970 to 1972, she was an education welfare officer for the Manchester Education Committee. From 1978 to 1980, she was Registrar of Marriages for Bury registration district. From 1989 to 1997, she was a project manager for Calderdale Well Woman Centre.
Before her election to parliament, McCafferty was a member of Hebden Royd Town Council 1991–95. She was also a councillor on Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council 1991–7, where she was chair of the Adoption Panel 1992–6. She served as member of the West Yorkshire Police Authority 1994–7.

==Parliamentary career==
McCafferty was selected as a New Labour candidate through an all-women shortlist. She was elected in the 1997 Labour landslide, replacing the Conservative Sir Donald Thompson who had held the seat since 1979. Her election was subject of the book &quot;This England&quot; by Pete Davies. She held the seat in the 2001 and 2005 general elections despite Tory resurgence.

In Parliament, she was a member of the Procedure Committee 1997–9, and of the International Development Committee 2001–5. Since 1999, she has also been a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, chairing the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Population, Development and Reproductive Health. She was the author of the McCafferty Report, which proposed to limit the freedom of medical professionals to decline to perform controversial medical practices, such as abortion, in order to insure access to medical treatment. The initiative was ultimately defeated when, on 7 October 2010, a narrow majority of Members adopted a number of amendments that turned it into its opposite: it now re-affirms the free exercise of conscientious objection, instead of restricting it.

McCafferty was one of the Labour rebel MPs that voted against British involvement in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Later that year she voted against the hospital reform bill that introduced NHS foundation trusts.

In 2007, McCafferty announced that she would retire at the next general election.

==Personal life==
McCafferty married Michael McCafferty, with whom she had one son. Later she remarried to David Tarlo.

<doc id="434707" wikidata="Q694759" url="?curid=434707" title="Siobhain McDonagh">
<text>Dame Siobhain Ann McDonagh (born 20 February 1960) is a British Labour Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Mitcham and Morden since 1997. She served as an Assistant Whip in the Labour Government, but was dismissed following comments regarding a leadership contest to replace prime minister Gordon Brown.

==Early life and career==
Siobhain McDonagh was born on 20 February 1960 in Colliers Wood. Her father was a builder and her mother a nurse who moved to the area in 1958. She went to Holy Cross School, New Malden and later studied Politics at the University of Essex.

After graduating, McDonagh was a clerical officer for the DHSS between 1981 and 1983, a receptionist at the Wandsworth Homeless Persons Unit from 1984 to 1986, and a housing adviser from 1986 to 1988. Prior to being elected to Parliament she worked as a Development Manager for Battersea Churches Housing Trust from 1988 to 1997. She also served as a councillor on London Borough of Merton for Colliers Wood ward between 1982 and 1998, chairing the Housing Committee between 1990 and 1995, being instrumental in the rebuilding of Phipps Bridge Estate.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1997 general election, McDonagh was elected to Parliament as MP for Mitcham and Morden with 58.4% of the vote and a majority of 13,741.

In April 2000, her office sent a party political questionnaire to 200 of her constituents using parliamentary resources. A spokesman for McDonagh subsequently said it was a &quot;mistake&quot;. McDonagh promised to apologise and reimburse the cost to her office.

She was again re-elected as MP for Mitcham and Morden at the 2001 general election with an increased vote share of 60.4% and an increased majority of 13,785. After the 2001 general election, Tony Blair offered McDonagh the position of Parliamentary Undersecretary of State at the Department for Communities and Local Government. She declined the offer and remained a backbencher.

In March 2003, McDonagh voted in favour of the country going to war with Iraq. She has consistently voted against any inquiry into the Iraq War.

McDonagh was again re-elected at the 2005 general election, with a decreased vote share of 56.4% and a decreased majority of 12,560. Following the 2005 general election, she served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to John Reid until June 2007. She was appointed to the position of Assistant Whip in June 2007 in the re-shuffle brought about by Gordon Brown becoming prime minister.

In October 2007, her expenditure on stationery and postage attracted criticism, being more than any other MP&#x27;s for postage from 2003 to 2006. In total, her office spent £126,833 on postage in the four-year period, an average of almost £32,000 per year. When adding in stationery costs, the expenditure was approximately £50,000 in both 2004–05 and 2006–07. McDonagh responded stating, &quot;I believe the job of an MP is to keep in contact with constituents on important issues&quot;.

On 12 September 2008, McDonagh became the first member of the government to call for a leadership contest, resulting in dismissal from her government post.

McDonagh was again re-elected at the 2010 general election, with an increased vote share of 56.5% and an increased majority of 13,666.

In October 2010, McDonagh&#x27;s mobile phone was stolen from her car. Although not implicated in the robbery itself, it became evident that &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper had accessed the phone, including messages stored on it. McDonagh sued the paper and in March 2013 won &quot;substantial damages.&quot;

At the 2015 general election, McDonagh was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 60.7% and an increased majority of 16,922.

In June 2015, McDonagh nominated Liz Kendall, considered the Blairite candidate, for leadership of the Labour Party.

In December 2015, she was among the minority of Labour MPs who voted in favour of extending UK military airstrikes against ISIL into Syria. She has written that it was a decision &quot;not easy to come to&quot;.

She supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election.

McDonagh abstained from a vote on a motion withdrawing the UK&#x27;s support for Saudi Arabia&#x27;s military campaign in Yemen. The motion was defeated by a majority of 90.

At the snap 2017 general election, McDonagh was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 68.7% and an increased majority of 21,375.

In September 2018, McDonagh offered her support to Labour MP Chris Leslie when he faced a confidence motion from his CLP, a vote he subsequently lost.

In March 2019, McDonagh was criticised by some left-wing members of the party after she appeared to agree with a statement put forward by John Humphrys on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme. McDonagh said antisemitism is a problem in the Labour Party, because &quot;part of [Labour] politics, of hard left politics, [is] to be against capitalists and to see Jewish people as the financiers of capital&quot;. When Humphrys asked her if that meant that &quot;to be anti-capitalist you have to be antisemitic&quot;, McDonagh replied, &quot;Yes&quot;.

McDonagh was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with a decreased vote share of 61.1% and a decreased majority of 16,482.

McDonagh endorsed Jess Phillips in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election.

In October 2020, during the Covid Pandemic, McDonagh faced criticism after being filmed inside the House of Commons, for using her face mask to clean her glasses.

McDonagh is a member of Labour Friends of Israel.

At the 2024 general election, McDonagh was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 55.4% and an increased majority of 18,761.

In November 2024, McDonagh voted against the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, a Bill to allow adults who are terminally ill, subject to safeguards and protections, to request and be provided with assistance to end their own life; and for connected purposes.

==Personal life==
McDonagh lived in Colliers Wood in her constituency with her late sister Margaret, latterly Baroness McDonagh (1961 - 2023), who was General Secretary of the Labour Party between 1998 and 2001, during Tony Blair&#x27;s premiership. She is a Roman Catholic of Irish descent.

In March 2023 McDonagh took a £1.2 million interest-free loan from Labour donor Lord Alli, to buy a house in south-west London with downstairs bedroom and bathroom suited for her terminally ill sister.

She was a patron of Leap Forward Employment – a now defunct community interest company that found work for adults with mental health issues.

McDonagh was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2024 New Year Honours for parliamentary and political service.

<text>Calum Alistair MacDonald (; born 7 May 1956) is a Scottish former politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Western Isles from 1987 to 2005. A member of the Labour Party, he was a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland from 1997 to 1999.

==Early life==
MacDonald was born on 7 May 1956 and grew up on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland. Educated at the Bayble School in Point, Outer Hebrides and Nicolson Institute, Stornoway, he went on to graduate from the University of Edinburgh with MA Honours in History and Politics.

During the 1980s, MacDonald was a Teaching Fellow at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for three years where he also gained his PhD in Political Philosophy. He returned to the UK to help out with the family kitchen and bathroom fittings business.

His political interests are wide-ranging. MacDonald&#x27;s published journalism (&quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; and the &quot;New Statesman&quot;) include articles on: Northern Ireland; the Balkans; Russia; links between Labour and the Liberal Democrats; Voting Reform; the Debate on Clause IV, etc. He was an early advocate of European defence co-operation, in &quot;A New Model Army&quot; (Fabian Discussion Paper, 1991) and &quot;European Security at the Crossroads&quot; (in B Crawford and P Schulze, Ed, European Dilemmas after Maastricht, Centre for German and European Studies UC Berkeley, 1993).

In 1990, he co-founded the Future of Europe Trust, which acted as a forum for young politicians across Eastern and Western Europe to progress their views on Europe. Between 1988 and 1992 he served on the Commons Select Committee on Agriculture. In 1991, he piloted his own Private Members Bill through the House of Commons, the Crofter Forestry Act, which has since led to the planting of mixed woodland by crofter communities in the Highlands and Islands.

Between 1991 and 1995, he was a leading campaigner for Western military intervention in the former Yugoslavia and a persistent critic of the-then Government&#x27;s policy.

Between 1992 and 1997, he was Chair of Labour Initiative on Co-operation (LINC), a Labour Party pressure group promoting co-operation with the Liberal Democrats.

==Parliamentary career==
MacDonald was first elected as MP for Western Isles at the 1987 general election.

A europhile, he was one of only five Labour MPs to vote for the Third Reading of the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, defying his party Whip to abstain.

In May 1997, he was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Scotland.

Between December 1997 and July 1999, he was Minister for Housing, Planning and European Affairs at the Scottish Office. Between July 1998 and July 1999, he had additional responsibilities for Transport, Highlands and Islands and Gaelic. In his capacity as Minister for Gaelic, he gave the 1998 Sabhal Mòr Lecture.

MacDonald is a former Chair of the Fabian Society, the Labour Party&#x27;s senior think-tank. He is an Honorary Fellow of the European Economics and Financial Centre.

MacDonald was defeated by Angus MacNeil of the Scottish National Party at the 2005 general election.

==After parliament==
On 1 April 2006 he was appointed as a non-executive Commissioner for Scotland for the Forestry Commission for a three-year term.

<doc id="434712" wikidata="Q333396" url="?curid=434712" title="John MacDougall (British politician)">
<text>John William MacDougall (8 December 1947 – 13 August 2008) was a British Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Glenrothes from the 2005 general election until his death; he was first elected to the House of Commons for Central Fife in the 2001 general election.

He was an active constituency MP who was loyal to the Labour government. From 2007 he was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma, and due to his illness, his participation in Parliament became fleeting, although he remained as an MP until his death in August the following year.

==Early life==
MacDougall was educated at Templehall Junior Secondary School in Kirkcaldy, Fife. He later obtained a diploma in industrial management and a certificate in naval architecture studies. He began work as an apprentice caulker riveter at Rosyth Dockyard, but his main working life was spent as a boilermaker from 1964 at the oil rig construction yard in Methil. He became a shop steward for the GMB trade union, later full-time Shop Steward Convenor.

==Political career==
===Fife councillor===
After joining the Labour Party in 1981, MacDougall was elected as a Labour Party member of Fife Regional Council for Burntisland the following year. He became leader of the regional council in 1987, formally as Chairman of the Policy and Resources Committee, leaving work to be a full-time councillor, and serving until the Regional Council was abolished in the reform of local government.

MacDougall was elected to the new Fife unitary council in 1995 and became Convenor of the council when it assumed its powers in April 1996. MacDougall&#x27;s position as leader led him to accept several other appointments, including as Chair of the Rosyth Dockyard and Naval Base Coordinating Committee, a director of Fife Enterprise, and Chair and director of Community Business Fife Ltd. In the mid-1990s he led the council&#x27;s efforts to keep the Rosyth base open, including writing to every Conservative MP to ask them to support a defence review not led by the Treasury. He was a member of the Scottish Constitutional Convention which established the framework for the Scottish Parliament.

===Parliament===
When Henry McLeish announced that he would stand down from his UK Parliament seat in Central Fife on moving to the Scottish Parliament, MacDougall was thought to be likely to be beaten to the selection as his successor by the former Labour Party general secretary Alex Rowley. However MacDougall was announced as the winner of the ballot.

MacDougall won with a majority of 10,075.

====Boundary changes====
A boundary review cutting the number of United Kingdom Parliamentary seats in Scotland put MacDougall&#x27;s seat in danger by enlarging it with parts taken from Kirkcaldy; it was rumoured that Kirkcaldy MP Lewis Moonie intended to challenge MacDougall. MacDougall was said to be &quot;absolutely distraught&quot; and intended to defend himself. He was mentioned as a potential candidate for the Central Fife constituency in the Scottish Parliament when Henry McLeish announced his retirement; however the selection went to his successor as council leader, Christine May. MacDougall won the selection for the new Glenrothes constituency when Lewis Moonie opted to retire instead.

==Burns translation==
To celebrate Burns Night in 2003, MacDougall had some of Robert Burns&#x27; most famous poems translated out of the Scots language into contemporary English to make them comprehensible for English guests. When Labour MPs were reported to be plotting to get Tony Blair to resign the leadership in favour of Gordon Brown, MacDougall was quoted as a supporter of Brown in opposing the plotting as not in his interests.

==Illness and death==
In May 2007 MacDougall revealed that he had serious health problems. He had had major surgery and a lung removed after being diagnosed with Mesothelioma, which transpired after his death came from the shipyards, but his doctor expected him to return to full health after he took part in the MARS Trial. In October it was said that he was likely to stand down in the event of a snap general election; however no election was called.

MacDougall was not recorded as having participated in any Parliamentary votes from early December 2007, and by June 2008 it was clear that his health problems were serious and there was a rumour that he would have to resign. However another rumour said that he was recovering and likely to return to work. MacDougall attended the House of Commons on 11 June 2008 to support the government on a knife-edge vote on pre-charge detention periods, giving an interview in which he admitted to having had an operation for pleural mesothelioma; he declared his intention to stand for re-election. However, MacDougall died of mesothelioma at 6 AM on 13 August 2008 at the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy.

<doc id="434713" wikidata="Q334333" url="?curid=434713" title="John McFall, Baron McFall of Alcluith">
<text>John Francis McFall, Baron McFall of Alcluith (born 4 October 1944), is a Scottish politician and life peer who has served as Lord Speaker, the presiding officer of the House of Lords, since 2021. He was a member of Parliament for the Labour and Co-operative Party from 1987 to 2010, first for Dumbarton and then from 2005 for West Dunbartonshire. He also served as Chairman of the House of Commons Treasury Committee. Following his appointment to the House of Lords, McFall served as Senior Deputy Speaker from 2016 to 2021 before succeeding Lord Fowler as Lord Speaker.

==Early life==
McFall went to a boys&#x27; school, St Patrick&#x27;s Secondary School (since merged with Notre Dame High School to form Our Lady &amp; St Patrick&#x27;s High School), on Hawthornhill Road in Castlehill, Dumbarton, leaving without any qualifications at 15. His father was a school caretaker and his mother had a newsagents shop, which sparked his (later) interest in how to run businesses. He worked for the local Parks Department in Dumbarton and then in a factory.

At the age of 24, he studied at Paisley College of Technology (now the University of the West of Scotland) receiving a BSc in chemistry. In 1977, he wanted to widen his knowledge away from science and obtained a BA from the Open University in education and philosophy. He was a chemistry and maths teacher from 1974 to 1987 in Dumbarton, Kirkintilloch and Glasgow, becoming a deputy-head in Glasgow and secretary of his Constituency Labour Party before he entered Parliament. Whilst a teacher he completed a part-time course over three years at the University of Strathclyde for an MBA. In 1994, he became a visiting professor at Strathclyde University Business School, and now is a member of the Strategic Advisory Board at the University of Glasgow Business School. He is a member of the GMB Union.

==Political career==
He was first elected for the Dumbarton constituency, Scotland, at the 1987 general election, after the previous MP, Ian Campbell retired. His original majority was a little over 2,000. Dumbarton constituency was replaced with the new West Dunbartonshire constituency for the 2005 general election, which McFall won with a majority over 12,500.

In 1995 he introduced a private member&#x27;s bill, the Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill which, although unsuccessful, informed the Hunting Act 2004 outlawing the hunting of mammals by dogs in England and Wales.

He was a whip and junior minister (for Education, Training and Employment, Health and Community Relations, then in 1999 for Economy and Education) at the Northern Ireland Office from 1998 to 1999.

In 2001 he was appointed Chair of the Treasury Select Committee, and reappointed for a second term in this position in 2005. The committee conducted inquiries into the banking crisis, producing evidence of the bonus culture, the lack of banking qualifications among many top bankers and poor oversight of the industry by the Financial Services Authority.

On 29 January 2010, McFall announced his intention to stand down as an MP at the 2010 general election.

===House of Lords===

On 17 June 2010, he was created a life peer as Baron McFall of Alcluith, &quot;of Dumbarton in Dunbartonshire&quot;, and was introduced in the House of Lords on 6 July 2010.

He was the Vice-Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Overseas Development (Apgood).

In July 2016, he was appointed as Chairman of Committees of the House of Lords with effect from 1 September 2016. He was known as Senior Deputy Speaker while holding the office.

In the 2021 Lord Speaker election, McFall was elected as Lord Speaker, succeeding Lord Fowler.

In 2023 he suggested the House of Lords needs more independent, expert peers. Lord McFall stated he was making no direct criticism of recent peerage choices, but the upper house was in danger of becoming &quot;out of sync&quot; with its balance of legislators. McFall planned to meet Rishi Sunak to lift a cap limiting the number of new, non-party expert peers that can be created by the House of Lords Appointments Commission, currently set at a maximum of two a year.

==Other activities==
He was Chair of the Scotch Whisky and Spirits All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) and of the Royal Navy APPG.

He was Chairman of Strathleven Regeneration Company and of Clydebank re-built, two development companies based in his constituency.

He gave his backing to Dumpster Kids, a not-for-profit organisation aimed at rescuing abandoned children, in January 2011.

Since 2023, he routinely hosts the House of Lords themed podcast Lord Speaker&#x27;s Corner, which features him discussing peership and other political topics with fellow Lords in Parliament.

==Personal life==
McFall&#x27;s family lived in Bellsmyre, Dumbarton, where he met and married Joan Ward. They have three sons and a daughter.

<text>Dame Anne Catherine McGuire (&#x27;Long; born 26 May 1949) is a Scottish Labour Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Stirling from 1997 to 2015. She was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland from 2002 to 2005 and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Disabled People from 2005 to 2008.

==Early life==
Born in Glasgow, McGuire was educated at the city&#x27;s Our Lady and St Francis Secondary School (became part of St Mungo&#x27;s Academy in 1988) on Charlotte Street and the University of Glasgow where she was awarded an MA in politics with history. She went on to study for teacher training at the Notre Dame College of Education (merged with Craiglockhart College in 1981 to become the St Andrew&#x27;s College of Education, then became part of the Faculty of Education of the University of Glasgow in 1999) in Bearsden, gaining a Diploma in Secondary Education.

She worked in the University Court of the University of Glasgow as both a registrar and a secretary from 1971 to 1974. In 1983, she joined Community Service Volunteers (CSV), initially as a teacher, then as a fieldworker. She left the organisation in 1993 as its national officer. Upon leaving CSV, she became the deputy director of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, where she remained until her election to the UK Parliament in 1997.

She was the parliamentary election agent for Norman Hogg at the 1979 general election at Dunbartonshire East, when he ousted the Scottish National Party&#x27;s MP Margaret Bain (later Ewing). She remained as Hogg&#x27;s election agent for the 1983, 1987 and 1992 elections in his new Cumbernauld and Kilsyth constituency. She was elected a councillor on Strathclyde Regional Council in 1980 and served for two years.

From 1987 until 1991, she was a member of the national executive of the GMB Union.

==Parliamentary career==
McGuire was selected to stand for election for Labour through an all-women shortlist. She was elected to the House of Commons at the 1997 general election when she ousted the then Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Forsyth by 6,411 votes. In the same year as her first election, she was rewarded by becoming the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Secretary of State for Scotland Donald Dewar. A year later, she joined the New Labour government when she was appointed as an assistant whip, becoming a Lord Commissioner to the Treasury in 2001. She became a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland in 2002, moving sideways to the Department for Constitutional Affairs in 2003. She served in the Department for Work and Pensions with responsibility for disabilities from 2005 to 2008. In October 2008, she stood down from the government and it was announced she would be appointed to the Privy Council.

On 10 October 2010, McGuire was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to Leader of the Opposition Ed Miliband, despite having backed his brother in the leadership campaign. She later asked to step down for the role in order to be able to speak more freely, and became Labour&#x27;s spokesperson on disabilities again before announcing her decision to stand down at the next election.

She also served as a member of the Public Accounts Committee and as co-chair of the All-party group on Disability.

McGuire is a member of Labour Friends of Israel (LFI), becoming its chair in May 2013 and was described by LFI director Jennifer Gerber as &quot;a true friend of Israel&quot;.

McGuire was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours.

McGuire was described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as &quot;the ultimate loyalist&quot; for never having rebelled once in Parliament. She described votes over cutting benefits for single mothers as the closest she came to rebelling against the government and supporting the 2003 Iraq War most difficult decision she had to make.

==Personal life==
McGuire married her husband, Len, on 12 February 1972 and they have a son and a daughter and live in Cumbernauld. She is a keen linguist and speaks French and Gaelic. She enjoys Ceilidh dancing and is honorary vice-president of Glasgow University Shinty Club.

<text>Anne Caroline Ballingall McIntosh, Baroness McIntosh of Pickering (born 20 September 1954) is a British politician who has been a life peer since 2015.

A member of the Conservative Party, McIntosh served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Thirsk and Malton from 2010 to 2015, having been the MP for Vale of York from 1997, as well as previously a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1989 to 1999. McIntosh was not reselected by her Thirsk and Malton constituency association on 31 January 2014, although she continued to represent the Conservative Party in Parliament until the 2015 general election.

She was given a life peerage in the 2015 Dissolution Honours and created Baroness McIntosh of Pickering, of the Vale of York in the County of North Yorkshire, on 6 October 2015, and introduced into the House of Lords on 27 October.

==Early life==
Born in Edinburgh, the daughter of a Scottish doctor father and Danish mother, Anne McIntosh was educated at Harrogate Ladies College in North Yorkshire and at the University of Edinburgh where she read Law, graduating in 1977 as LLB. She also pursued post-graduate studies at the University of Aarhus in the Jutland region of Denmark.

In 1978, she became a trainee at the European Community (EEC) Competition Directorate, before joining Didier and Associates in Brussels in 1979 as a legal advisor. She trained for the Scottish Bar in Edinburgh from 1980, being admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in June 1982. She worked as an advocate with the Community Law Office in Brussels, before becoming a political advisor to the European Democrats group in the European Parliament in 1983 until 1989.

== European Parliament==
After an unsuccessful attempt at a UK Parliamentary seat (1987 general election at Workington), where she was defeated by the sitting Labour MP Dale Campbell-Savours, McIntosh was elected for Essex North East at the 1989 European Parliament election and later for its successor seat of Essex North and Suffolk South at the 1994 election. She served as a Member of the European Parliament until she stood down at the 1999 elections.

== Member of Parliament ==

===MP for Vale of York (1997-2010)===

McIntosh was elected to the House of Commons in the 1997 general election for the Vale of York which she won by a comfortable 9,721 majority and held the seat without difficulty until it was abolished in 2010. She was promoted to the Opposition frontbench in 2001 as Spokesperson for Culture, Media and Sport and has since held a number of front bench positions including Transport (2003–2005), Foreign Affairs (2005), Work and Pensions (2005–2007), and Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (2007–2010), though never at Shadow Cabinet level. McIntosh was elected as Chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee in 2010. In 2014 she received wide acclaim for her &quot;robust chairmanship&quot; and &quot;tackling the establishment head on&quot;.

After boundary changes agreed in 2006, the Vale of York constituency was divided up leaving no obvious successor; the seat most closely associated was Thirsk and Malton which was the successor to Ryedale, held since 1987 by John Greenway. McIntosh and Greenway went head-to-head for the newly created seat. On 18 November 2006, the newly formed Thirsk and Malton Conservative Association chose McIntosh as their candidate for the ensuing general election.

====Expenses====
Following an inquiry by Sir Thomas Legg into parliamentary expenses, Anne McIntosh was asked to repay £948. In her statement, she welcomed the lead in expenses reform from David Cameron, despite being one of only 21 Conservative MPs to vote against expenses reform on 4 July 2008.

===MP for Thirsk and Malton (2010-15)===

Following the death of UK Independence Party candidate John Boakes, the 2010 election in Thirsk and Malton was delayed until 27 May, some three weeks after the rest of the country. McIntosh won being returned to Parliament with a majority of 11,281.

After the 2010 election, McIntosh was not appointed a Minister from her shadow portfolio, but was elected Chair of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee. She was also elected Chair of the all-party parliamentary groups on Denmark, South Africa, Water, Floods and Environmental Quality.

As Chairman of the EFRA Committee, McIntosh has worked on: the EU Council Directive on the Welfare of Laying Hens, EU Common Fisheries Policy, the Farming in the Uplands Report and the CAP after 2013 report.

During 2010/11, McIntosh had been campaigning for the reopening of Ryedale Ward at Malton Community Hospital following its temporary closure as part of a pilot scheme. McIntosh secured an adjournment debate in the House of Commons on 17 November 2010 on the decision-making processes for closing hospital wards. In the run up to the budget, McIntosh tried to campaign for both a fair fuel stabilizer and a remote rural fuel duty rebate for North Yorkshire. Although McIntosh secured a debate, which took place on Tuesday 15 February, on introducing a potential fuel duty stabilizer and rebate for remote rural areas, it did not feature in the Budget. McIntosh had campaigned for the safety of some constituents living along the A64. She had been campaigning for better road safety and road speed measures in the local villages of Rillington, East Heslerton and West Heslerton.

===Issues with local party and deselection===

In August 2009, the local Conservative Party attempted to deselect McIntosh as their Parliamentary Candidate. McIntosh won the vote, which was held in Malton. Following this, she was elected as the new MP for Thirsk and Malton.

In January 2013, it was reported that the Conservative local party &#x27;Executive Committee&#x27; had voted not to reselect McIntosh automatically as the Parliamentary Candidate for the next general election.

On 31 January 2014, it was announced that McIntosh had lost a vote of confidence, and therefore was not reselected and would not be the Conservative candidate in Thirsk and Malton at the next election.

Following the result, Conservative Home speculated that McIntosh might stand as an Independent candidate in 2015. In March 2015 McIntosh publicly announced that she would not be standing as an Independent and would be standing down from Parliament as Member of Parliament for Thirsk and Malton in May 2015.

==Career in the Lords==
McIntosh was given a life peerage in the 2015 Dissolution Honours and created Baroness McIntosh of Pickering, &quot;of the Vale of York in the County of North Yorkshire&quot;, on 6 October. Since October 2015, she has sat in the House of Lords.

==Personal life==
Anne McIntosh married John Harvey in September 1992 in County Durham, and they have a house in the constituency near to Thirsk.

An accomplished linguist, she speaks six languages: English, Danish, French, German, Italian and Spanish.

<text>Shona McIsaac (born 3 April 1960) is a British Labour Party politician. She was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Cleethorpes from 1997 to 2010. She was defeated by Conservative candidate Martin Vickers in the 2010 election.

== Early life ==
McIsaac was born in Dunfermline, Fife in Scotland.

==Before politics==
She went to the SHAPE High School in Mons in Belgium, then Barne Barton Secondary Modern school in St Budeaux and Stoke Damerel High School for Girls in Stoke, Plymouth, which closed in 1986. She read for a BSc in Geography at St. Aidan&#x27;s College of University of Durham, being taught by David Bellamy, and graduated in 1981.

She wrote and worked on women&#x27;s weekly magazines, being deputy chief sub-editor of &quot;Bella&quot;, senior sub-editor of &quot;Chat&quot; and chief sub-editor of &quot;Woman&quot;.

==Parliament==
McIsaac started her political career as a councillor to the London Borough of Wandsworth in the Tooting ward in 1990. She was selected to stand for election for Labour in Cleethorpes through an all-women shortlist. She won the Cleethorpes seat with a majority of over 9,000, defeating Michael Brown, the sitting MP for the predecessor seat of Brigg and Cleethorpes. She was re-elected in 2001 with a majority of 5,620, and again four years later, finishing over 2,000 votes ahead of her Conservative rival.

She served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State within the Department of Health.

McIsaac proposed a bill limiting the use of fireworks, and supported anti-fox hunting measures.

McIsaac was described as a &#x27;government loyalist&#x27; and a &quot;super loyal backbencher&quot;. According to the website TheyWorkForYou.com, McIsaac rarely rebelled against the Government, with the BBC stating &quot;she regards it almost as a duty to support the government&#x27;s agenda&quot;. She supported the Government in the vote on the war in Iraq.

In October 2009, following significant research, McIsaac launched a small campaign to raise awareness of the poor state of many of Britain&#x27;s war memorials. Her principal case study was of the war memorial in Wold Newton, a small village in her constituency. She spoke on the subject in the House of Commons and an article appeared in the &quot;Telegraph&quot;.

In May 2010, she was defeated by Martin Vickers, losing by just over 4,000 votes. Following the general election, she blamed Gordon Brown personally on television for Labour&#x27;s defeat.

==Personal life==
McIsaac lives in Cleethorpes with her husband Peter Keith, whom she married in 1994. Keith unsuccessfully contested the seat of Cleethorpes in 2015 and 2017.

<text>Ann McKechin (born 22 April 1961) is a former British Labour Party politician and was Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Maryhill from 2001 until 2005 and Glasgow North from 2005 to 2015. She was a junior minister under Gordon Brown before becoming a member of Shadow Cabinet of Ed Miliband. She lost her seat to the Scottish National Party in the landslide at the 2015 general election.

==Early life==
Born in Paisley to Anne (née Coyle) and William Joseph McKechin, she was educated at Paisley Grammar School and Sacred Heart High School, before studying Scots law at the University of Strathclyde. She joined the Glasgow-based Pacitti Jones solicitors in 1983 as a solicitor, becoming a partner in 1990, she left the practice in 2000.

McKechin held several posts within the Glasgow Kelvin Labour Party from 1995, then the constituency of George Galloway, then a Labour MP. She was selected as a candidate for the 1999 European election, but failed to be elected.

==Political career==
She was elected to the House of Commons at the 2001 general election for the Glasgow Maryhill constituency, following the retirement of the previous Labour MP, Maria Fyfe. She retained the Maryhill seat with a majority of nearly 10,000 votes. In the boundary changes which came into force for the 2005 election, the Maryhill constituency was abolished, and McKechin was elected for the newly drawn Glasgow North constituency, but with a much-reduced majority of 3,338 over the Scottish Liberal Democrats.

In the House of Commons, McKechin served briefly as the Parliamentary Private Secretary to Jacqui Smith in 2005 in her capacity as Minister of State at both the Department of Trade and Industry and at the Department for Education and Skills. She also served on a number of select committees including; Scottish Affairs (2001–05) and International Development (since 2005). She replaced David Cairns as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Scotland Office on 16 September 2008.

In October 2010, McKechin was elected to the Shadow Cabinet and appointed as Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, but was replaced by Margaret Curran in shadow cabinet reshuffle on 7 October 2011.

She lost her seat to Patrick Grady of the Scottish National Party at the 2015 general election.

<text>Rosemary McKenna (&quot;née&quot; Harvey; born 8 May 1941) is a Scottish Labour Party politician, who sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2010. She was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Cumbernauld and Kilsyth at the 1997 general election, and held that seat until its abolition in boundary changes for the 2005 general election. She was then elected as the MP for the new Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East, from which she stood down at the next election, in 2010.

==Early life==
Born to the Irish Cornelius Harvey and a Scottish mother, Susan, she went to St Augustine&#x27;s RC Secondary School on &quot;Liddesdale Road&quot; in Milton, Glasgow. From 1958–65, she worked as a secretary. She joined the Labour Party in 1966 when she moved to Cumbernauld. She studied at the Roman Catholic Notre Dame College of Education, receiving a Diploma in Primary Education in 1974. She was a primary school teacher from 1974–94 before becoming a local councillor and eventual Provost of the former Cumbernauld and Kilsyth District Council.

==Parliamentary career==
McKenna was first elected in 1997 to represent the former Cumbernauld and Kilsyth seat, which she retained at the 2001 election.

The seat was abolished for the 2005 general election and she contested the new Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East constituency, winning with a 1.1% swing against her to the Scottish National Party. She retired at the 2010 general election.

In 2006, she gave the loyal address following the Queens Speech alongside Alun Michael.

She was responsible for chairing the Labour Party&#x27;s vetting procedure for candidates for the first election for the Scottish Parliament. This process saw many of the more left-oriented candidates rejected, including Dennis Canavan, Ian Davidson, Michael Connarty, all of whom were sitting Members of Parliament at the time, as well as Tommy Sheppard, a former Assistant General Secretary of the Labour Party in Scotland.

==Personal life==
She married James McKenna. They have three sons and one daughter.

<text>Andrew Stuart MacKinlay (born 24 April 1949) is a British Liberal Democrat politician, who was the Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Thurrock from 1992 until he stepped down at the 2010 general election.

In parliament MacKinlay built a reputation as a hard-working constituency MP, gaining respect from all sides and as a stalwart of Gibraltar. In 2021 he was elected as a Liberal Democrat councillor for Kingston upon Thames London Borough Council, although he stood down a short time later, at the 2022 election.

==Early life and career==
MacKinlay was born in Wembley on 24 April 1949. He was educated successively at St Joseph&#x27;s School, Wembley; Our Lady Immaculate Primary School, Tolworth; Salesian College (a private Catholic school at the time), now comprehensive Salesian School in Chertsey and Kingston College, now part of the South Thames College Group. He worked from 1965 as a committee clerk with Surrey County Council until 1975, when he served as a union official with the National and Local Government Officers&#x27; Association (NALGO). He joined NALGO in 1965. He joined the Labour Party in 1966. MacKinlay was elected as a Labour councillor in 1971 in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames and served for two terms as one of two councillors for the ward of Tolworth West until 1978. He unsuccessfully vied for his local seat of Surbiton in both of the 1974 general elections, keeping his deposit in what was then demonstrably a three-party contest.

==Parliamentary career==
Following unsuccessful election campaigns in the safe Conservative seats of Croydon Central in 1983 and Peterborough in 1987, MacKinlay regained the historically safe Labour seat of Thurrock in 1992 from the Conservatives.

On 15 June 1992, he tabled an Early day motion, seeking a pardon for executed soldiers. This campaign eventually succeeded with the Armed Forces Act 2006, where section 359 pardoned 306 British Empire soldiers.

In 1998 MacKinlay was the first to introduce a freedom of information bill to the House of Commons.

Although MacKinlay had originally come from the right of the Labour Party, as an MP he came to be associated with the Labour left as a leader of a group of left-wing Labour MPs nicknamed the &quot;awkward squad,&quot; known for rebelling against the New Labour leadership of Tony Blair. MacKinlay maintained that he had not moved toward the left, but that the leadership of the Labour Party under Blair had moved to the political right. He continued to rebel against his party under the New Labour leadership of Gordon Brown; by 2008, he had broken the party whip 72 times.

In 2003, MacKinlay described Dr David Kelly as &quot;chaff&quot; during Dr Kelly&#x27;s appearance before the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee. The committee was investigating issues around the British government&#x27;s dossier on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. MacKinlay&#x27;s question was:
:I reckon you are chaff; you have been thrown up to divert our probing. Have you ever felt like a fall-guy? You have been set up, have you not?
MacKinlay apparently meant &quot;chaff&quot; as in the radar countermeasure rather than something of little value. It emerged during Kelly&#x27;s subsequent inquest, however, that Kelly had been deeply upset by his treatment before the committee and had privately described an MP, assumed to be MacKinlay, as an &quot;utter bastard&quot;. MacKinlay reportedly apologised to Kelly&#x27;s widow for the remark.

According to one report, in May 2007, MacKinlay made the nomination that resulted in Gordon Brown having enough nominations to be certain of not facing a contest over the leadership of the party. However, another report states that the decisive nomination was made by Tony Wright with MacKinlay yet to nominate at that point.

===Notice of resignation===
On 24 July 2009, he announced that he would not stand at the next General Election due to disillusionment with the way he felt other MPs had caved in to party pressure rather than standing up for their beliefs. He said that the final straw was the failure of a number of Labour MPs who had expressed support for Gary McKinnon, awaiting extradition to the U.S. on computer hacking charges, to vote for a review of the extradition treaty.

===Damages win===
On 1 October 2009, MacKinlay accepted a public apology and libel damages from the BBC over allegations made on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme that he proposed an amendment to a British government motion on expenses of MPs so he would benefit financially.

===Ireland and the Commonwealth===

MacKinlay argued that initiatives should be taken to encourage Ireland to participate in the Commonwealth. He brought forward a motion on the issue in the House of Commons. Ireland had participated in the Commonwealth in the 1930s and 40s. Mackinlay&#x27;s view was that historians were wrong to say that Ireland had left the Commonwealth in 1949. This was, he said, because the Commonwealth, to the extent that it existed, was nothing like the Commonwealth of today. He felt that the London Declaration formula that permitted republics to participate in the Commonwealth had not been offered to Ireland as an option, though he felt it was not too late to do so. He argued that Ireland should be formally invited to join and that the Commonwealth was its &quot;natural place&quot;.

==Personal life==
MacKinlay lives in Malden Rushett, Surrey with his wife. He is a keen researcher on World War I history, travelling, and is an honorary patron of Tilbury Football Club. He and his wife Ruth (née Segar); have three children. While an MP, he employed his wife as his personal assistant. He was once a member of the editorial board of &quot;Total Politics&quot;, a political magazine, of which his daughter, Sarah, was editor until August 2009.

He was given the Freedom of Gibraltar in 2010.

==Political views==
In December 2018, he allowed his Labour Party membership to lapse and, in May 2019, he joined the Liberal Democrats. In the Chessington South by-election to Kingston upon Thames London Borough Council
held on 6 May 2021, he was elected for the Liberal Democrats. He stood down at the 2022 election.

MacKinlay publicly supports the abolition of the monarchy and is identified as a republican.

<text>Patrick Allen McLoughlin, Baron McLoughlin, (born 30 November 1957) is a British politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he first became the Member of Parliament (MP) for West Derbyshire following the 1986 by-election. The constituency became the Derbyshire Dales for the 2010 general election; McLoughlin remained the seat&#x27;s MP until 2019.

As a former miner, he is one of the few Conservative parliamentarians to have been a manual worker before being elected to Parliament. On 4 September 2012, he was appointed Secretary of State for Transport. On 14 July 2016, he became Chairman of the Conservative Party and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, under the new administration of Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May. He resigned as chairman on 8 January 2018 and was succeeded by Brandon Lewis. In January 2022, he was announced as the new chair of Transport for the North.

==Early life and career==
McLoughlin was born in Stafford on 30 November 1957, the son and grandson of coal miners. He was educated at the Cardinal Griffin Roman Catholic School in Cannock, Staffordshire, and Staffordshire College of Agriculture at Rodbaston College. From 1974, he worked for five years as a farm worker and, after 1979, worked underground at the Littleton Colliery in Cannock. He was a member of the National Union of Mineworkers, and became an industrial representative for the National Coal Board&#x27;s Western Area Marketing Department.

McLoughlin was elected as a councillor on Cannock Chase District Council, serving for seven years from 1980, and was a councillor on Staffordshire County Council from 1981 to 1987. In 1982, McLoughlin served as the Chairman of the National Young Conservatives.

Coal miners in Staffordshire were split in support of the NUM miners&#x27; strike in 1984–85. McLoughlin did not support the strike, and later came to national attention when he stood up at the 1984 Conservative Party Conference to announce that he was a working miner. He moved from underground belt attendant to Area Marketing representative in September 1985, five months after the end of the strike.

McLoughlin unsuccessfully contested Wolverhampton South East at the 1983 general election, losing to the sitting Labour MP Robert Edwards by 5,000 votes.

==Parliamentary career==
Matthew Parris, then Conservative MP for West Derbyshire, had resigned from the House of Commons to pursue a media career and McLoughlin was chosen to contest the 1986 by-election. He held the seat, albeit very narrowly, with a 100 majority.

In Parliament, McLoughlin served as the Parliamentary Private Secretary, initially to Angela Rumbold (Minister of State at the Department for Education and Science (1987–88) and then to David Young, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1988–89). McLoughlin was made a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1989, and served in the Department for Transport until 1992, when he was moved by Prime Minister John Major to serve in the same position at the Department of Employment. A year later, McLoughlin was moved to the Department of Trade and Industry.

He joined the government as Assistant Whip in 1995, becoming a Lord Commissioner in 1996. After the Conservative Party&#x27;s defeat at the 1997 general election, he remained in the whips&#x27; office in opposition, becoming the Deputy Chief Whip in 1998. He was then promoted to Chief Whip by David Cameron in 2005. McLoughlin has also served on many select committees. As Opposition Chief Whip, he was sworn of the Privy Council in June 2005.

Following boundary changes, the West Derbyshire constituency was abolished at the 2010 general election, and McLoughlin was elected to the successor seat of Derbyshire Dales, achieving exactly the same number of votes. Prime Minister David Cameron appointed McLoughlin as the government&#x27;s Chief Whip and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government. During his tenure as Chief Whip, he was reprimanded by the Speaker John Bercow for inappropriate behaviour within the House of Commons.

===Transport Secretary===
In a government reshuffle in September 2012, McLoughlin was appointed Secretary of State for Transport. Soon after his appointment he had to cancel the award of the InterCity West Coast franchise due to major technical flaws in the bidding process.

As Transport Secretary, McLoughlin oversaw large-scale government investment in rail in the wake of increasing passenger numbers in the years following rail privatisation. From 2014 to 2019, £38 billion of improvement works were planned, including Crossrail, the Thameslink Programme, electrification of the Great Western Main Line and the Northern Powerhouse scheme to boost transport links in the North of England.

In 2017, construction began on HS2, a high-speed link between major cities that will &quot;triple the long-distance capacity to the North of England&quot; as well as freeing up the West Coast Main Line for freight and commuter trains. In 2015, McLoughlin said &quot;So the argument has been won. HS2 will be built, the full ‘Y’ network, from London to Birmingham and Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds. HS2 will change the transport architecture of the north. But it will also change the economic architecture.&quot;

In November 2013, he made a speech praising the impact of the privatisation of British Rail, saying that &quot;Privatisation sparked a railway renaissance. Since 1993, passenger journeys have doubled in the UK to a level not seen since the 1920s. On a network roughly the same size as 15 years ago, today our railway is running 4,000 more services a day. And rail freight has grown by 60%. Revenue is up more than £3 billion since privatisation, almost all of it due to higher passenger numbers rather than fare rises. Safety levels are at an all time high. Punctuality is at near record levels. And passenger satisfaction is up by 10% over the past decade.&quot; However, a number of academics and journalists disputed this and subsequently argued that the evidence suggested the privatisation had largely failed, creating new inefficiencies, failing to create genuine competition and seeing steep rises in costs to passengers.

In December 2015, he announced the winners of the Northern and TransPennine Express franchises which include new trains, services and free wifi, saying &quot;Arriva Rail North and First TransPennine Express went far beyond our requirements with exciting, ambitious plans that will make a real difference to customers, and – coupled with our commitment to push ahead with electrifying the vital TransPennine route – will help the region realise its full economic potential, ensuring it has a modern 21st century transport system.&quot;

McLoughlin&#x27;s efforts to meet and pacify Cumbrian residents of Pooley Bridge and Soulsby following the 2015 floods were ridiculed in &quot;The Independent&quot; when the ministerial party arrived on the wrong side of the collapsed bridge. The paper compared the event to a scene from the BBC comedy &quot;The Thick of It&quot;.

McLoughlin oversaw the beginning of the £15 billion road upgrade package to improve routes and add lanes.

After the resignation of David Cameron as Prime Minister following the UK&#x27;s vote to leave the European Union on 23 June 2016, McLoughlin was made Conservative Party chairman by new Prime Minister Theresa May on 14 July 2016. He was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 2016 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours, by his colleague in the Conservative Party, for political and public service.

=== Chairman of the Conservative Party ===
In a 24 July 2016 interview on the &quot;Andrew Marr Show&quot;, Patrick McLoughlin said &quot;Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty will be triggered before the next general election. It&#x27;s very clear that Brexit means Brexit. Brexit means that we&#x27;re coming out of the European Union. We want to see our own borders under our own control.&quot;

McLoughlin stepped down as Chairman of the Conservative Party on 8 January 2018, saying that he had had &quot;a very good run&quot; and was replaced by Brandon Lewis. He also resigned as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, with David Lidington being his successor. Prior to his resignation, McLoughlin had come under increasing pressure to resign from colleagues in the Conservative Party over the disappointing performance of the party in the 2017 general election and various issues with the most recent party conference.

===After the Commons===
McLoughlin was appointed Chairman of Visit Britain. He served until 2023.

In January 2022, McLoughlin was appointed as Chair of Transport for the North. At the time of the appointment, he said: &quot;I believe firmly in the potential of the North of England and know from my personal experience and professional career just how vital reliable, cost-effective and sustainable transport is to people and business.&quot;

====Peerage====
McLoughlin was nominated for a life peerage in the 2019 Dissolution Honours. He was created &quot;Baron McLoughlin, of Cannock Chase in the County of Staffordshire&quot; on 8 September 2020. Lord McLoughlin made his maiden speech on 11 November 2020, remembering his time as a whip, meeting Lord Cormack and being a member of the cabinet in the Cameron/Clegg Years. In 2025, he was appointed chair of the Services Committee.

==Personal life==
He is married to Lynn McLoughlin, whom he employed as a Senior Parliamentary Assistant on a salary up to £40,000. His son James was also employed by the Conservative Party as a Special Advisor to the Prime Minister Theresa May.

<doc id="434728" wikidata="Q6396978" url="?curid=434728" title="Kevin McNamara (politician)">
<text>Joseph Kevin McNamara (5 September 1934 – 6 August 2017) was a British Labour politician who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for almost 40 years.

==Early life==
Born in West Derby, Merseyside, he was educated by the Irish Christian Brothers at St Mary&#x27;s College, Crosby. He studied for an LLB at the University of Hull. He was head of department in History at St Mary&#x27;s Grammar School (now called St Mary&#x27;s College) in Hull from 1958–64 and a Law lecturer at Hull College of Commerce from 1964–66.

==Parliamentary career==
After unsuccessfully contesting Bridlington in 1964, McNamara was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Kingston upon Hull North, in a by-election in January 1966 following the death of sitting Labour MP Henry Solomons. Labour&#x27;s hold of a former marginal seat with a significantly increased majority is widely considered to have helped to convince the prime minister Harold Wilson to call the 1966 election to seek a larger majority.

McNamara retained his seat at the 1966 general election, and at subsequent elections until the constituency was abolished for the February 1974 general election, when he transferred to the new Kingston upon Hull Central constituency. When that constituency was abolished for the 1983 election, McNamara was re-elected for the re-created Kingston upon Hull North constituency.

McNamara campaigned in his last years in parliament on many issues, protesting against the Act of Succession which prohibits a Roman Catholic or the spouse of a Roman Catholic to be the British monarch. He stepped down at the 2005 general election, with the local Constituency Labour Party choosing Diana Johnson to stand in his place.

During the 2005 general election campaign McNamara claimed some of the policies regarding illegal travellers&#x27; sites of the leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard had a &quot;whiff of the gas chambers&quot; about them. Howard&#x27;s grandmother was murdered at Auschwitz.

===Northern Ireland===
McNamara was known throughout his parliamentary career as a supporter of Irish nationalism who favoured a United Ireland. After entering parliament, he soon became interested in reports of discrimination against the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland and supported the Campaign for Democracy in Ulster (CDU). He served as a frontbench spokesman for the Labour Party, including Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland under Neil Kinnock, 1987–94, an appointment that was widely criticised by Unionists.

After Tony Blair became Labour leader, he replaced McNamara as Northern Ireland spokesman with Mo Mowlam. In 1997, he helped persuade the newly elected Labour government to donate £5,000 (thereby matching the contribution of the Irish government) for the erection of a memorial in Liverpool to the victims of the Great Irish Famine.

McNamara also supported Republicanism in the United Kingdom and joined the All-Party Parliamentary Republic Group.

==Personal life==
McNamara was a Roman Catholic, a Knight Commander of the Pontifical Order of Saint Gregory the Great and recipient of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. He was married to Nora McNamara, and was the father of four sons and a daughter.

In 2006, McNamara received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Hull in recognition of his long service in politics. He graduated with a PhD from the University of Liverpool in 2007 having completed a thesis on the MacBride Principles at the Institute of Irish Studies, where he gave the 2008 John Kennedy Lecture in Irish Studies, &quot;&quot;.

===Illness and death===
In 2017, McNamara was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer while on holiday in Spain. On 6 August, it was reported that he had died at his home in Formby, Merseyside, aged 82.

<doc id="434730" wikidata="Q334350" url="?curid=434730" title="Tony McNulty">
<text>Anthony James McNulty (born 3 November 1958) is a retired British politician who was the Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Harrow East from 1997 to 2010. During his ministerial career, which began in 2003, he was Minister for London and later Minister of State for Employment and Welfare Reform at the Department for Work and Pensions. He resigned his position on 5 June 2009 after allegations in the press regarding his expenses.

==Background, education and early political career==
His father migrated to England from County Donegal, Ireland.

McNulty was educated at the Salvatorian College, Wealdstone and at Stanmore Sixth Form College. He graduated from the University of Liverpool with a BA in Political Theory and Institutions and an MA in Political Science from Virginia Tech in the United States. Before becoming an MP, he was leader of the Labour group on Harrow council and a senior lecturer in Organisational Behaviour, at the University of North London from 1983–97. In 1986, he was elected to Harrow Council for Stanmore South ward.

==Parliamentary career==
McNulty was an unsuccessful Labour candidate for Harrow East in the 1992 general election, but was elected as the constituency&#x27;s MP in the May 1997 general election. He served as a Whip from 1999 to 2002, following a period as Parliamentary Private Secretary to David Blunkett. McNulty was then appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister with responsibility for neighbourhood renewal, housing and planning. He was moved to the Department for Transport in June 2003 as Parliamentary Under Secretary with responsibility for aviation, local transport, and London, and was promoted to Minister of State with responsibility for Rail and London in September 2004.

McNulty moved to the Home Office on 9 May 2005 as Minister of State for Immigration, following the general election reshuffle. In May 2006 his Home Office portfolio changed to responsibility over the policing and crime, security and counter-terrorism. In July 2007, he became a Privy Councillor. In Gordon Brown&#x27;s reshuffle on 3 October 2008, McNulty moved to become Minister of State for Employment and Welfare Reform at the Department for Work and Pensions and Minister for London, and was permitted to attend cabinet meetings until his resignation on 5 June 2009. During his period as Minister, McNulty was concerned with benefit fraud suggesting that &quot;we are absolutely determined to stop benefit thieves stealing from the British taxpayer. Our commitment extends beyond the borders of the UK. Even in sunny Spain, we&#x27;re closing in on benefit fraud&quot;.

===MPs&#x27; expenses controversy===

In 2009, McNulty was one of many MPs who were involved in a political scandal following the disclosure of expenses of Members of the United Kingdom Parliament. In March 2009, he admitted claiming expenses on a second home, occupied by his parents, which was 8 miles away from his primary residence, after details appeared in &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;. McNulty said that the claim was appropriate, but he ceased claiming the allowances. He was asked to apologise to the House of Commons and repay £13,837, which he did.

In an article headlined &quot;Tony McNulty, Benefit Cheat&quot;, Alex Massie in a blog for &quot;The Spectator&quot; contrasted the statements made by McNulty regarding benefit cheats with his own claims for expenses. On 18 May 2007, McNulty was one of the 98 MPs who voted in favour of exempting parliamentarians from the application of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.

On 5 June 2009, after the revelations in the expenses scandal, McNulty resigned from the government. At the 2010 general election, McNulty lost to Bob Blackman of the Conservative Party.

==Personal life==
In September 2002, McNulty married Christine Gilbert, Her Majesty&#x27;s Chief Inspector of Schools for Ofsted, in Hammersmith and Fulham. Gilbert was headmistress of Whitmore High School for eight years, starting when she was 32. It was the second marriage for both. McNulty had first married in 1994 to Gillian Travers, who later stood as a Labour candidate for Ruislip-Northwood in 2001.

In the 1980s McNulty played rugby union for Watford RFC, as did his brother Richard (Dickie).

<doc id="434731" wikidata="Q7822951" url="?curid=434731" title="Tony McWalter">
<text>Joseph Anthony McWalter, generally known as Tony McWalter, (born 20 March 1945 in Worksop) is a politician in the United Kingdom. He was the Labour Party and Co-operative Member of Parliament for Hemel Hempstead between 1997 and 2005.

==Early life==

===Education===
He went to the independent catholic St Benedict&#x27;s School in Ealing. At the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, he gained a BSc in Pure Maths in 1967, and a BSc in Philosophy in 1968. At McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, he gained an MA in Philosophy in 1968. At University College, Oxford, he gained a BPhil in Philosophy in 1971 and he was offered the degree of MLitt in 1983.

===Career===
From 1963 to 1964, he was a teacher at the catholic Cardinal Wiseman secondary school in Greenford, west London. From 1964 to 1967, he was periodically a lorry driver for EH Paterson Ltd. From 1968 to 1969, he was a teaching fellow at McMaster University.

He is a former philosophy lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield, beginning when it was known as Hatfield Polytechnic in 1974. He also lectured at Thames Polytechnic (now called the University of Greenwich) from 1972 to 1974. In the late 1980s he was Director of Computing at the university&#x27;s education campus at Wall Hall.

McWalter&#x27;s principal academic interest is in the philosophy of Kant, and with George MacDonald Ross he co-edited &quot;Kant and His Influence&quot;.

Following his electoral defeat in 2005, McWalter established an educational consultancy business offering one to one tuition in mathematics and the sciences. In this role he taught again at the University of Hertfordshire, teaching mathematics on a contract basis until 2007. In 2007 he was appointed as an associate lecturer at the Open University mathematics department (London region): and in 2010 he gained qualified teacher status from the Institute of Education (London University). He is a key stage five specialist teacher at The Thomas Alleyne Academy in Stevenage, teaching mathematics and physics.

==Political career==
McWalter served as a Labour councillor on North Hertfordshire District Council from the 1979 election until 1983, representing the Letchworth East ward.

He contested St Albans in 1987 and Luton North in 1992. He also contested two European Parliament seats, Hertfordshire (1984) and Bedfordshire South (1989).

McWalter won the Hemel Hempstead seat from Robert Jones (Conservative) in 1997 and held it in 2001, and was narrowly defeated by 499 votes by Mike Penning (Conservative) in 2005.

Early in his Westminster career, McWalter was one of a number of Labour MPs who petitioned for a planned cut in single-parents benefits, scheduled by the previous Conservative administration, to be cancelled before it came into effect. The cancellation of the cut was announced but then later revoked. McWalter abstained on the first vote in the Commons on implementing the cut. On later votes on the Welfare Reform bill McWalter voted with the government, but he did so having secured amendments on mobility allowance for disabled children aged between three and five, and on the bereavement allowance (which had been scheduled to be cut to six months so that widowers and widows could be given equal treatment). McWalter often cites this as evidence that it is possible for backbenchers to get laws beneficially amended.

McWalter served on the Northern Ireland select committee during the extraordinary period before and after the Good Friday Agreement. McWalter also served on the Procedure Committee, where his principal concern was the treatment of bill committees in the House. Specifically, the whips would only appoint &quot;nodding dogs&quot;, and many clauses would be left both unamended and even undebated.

On 27 February 2002, McWalter asked the prime minister the following question: &quot;My right hon. Friend is sometimes subject to rather unflattering or even malevolent descriptions of his motivation. Will he provide the House with a brief characterisation of the political philosophy that he espouses and which underlies his policies?&quot; The prime minister was famously confused. McWalter later claimed that he was annoyed by the constant theme in government that seemed to suggest that the main justification for a policy was that it was &quot;modern&quot;. McWalter also claimed that the prime minister had had four days&#x27; notice of the question, and that his only motive was to get a carefully thought-out and principled response.

McWalter hosted three adjournment debates which have been read widely. One was on the teaching of philosophy on 1 July 1999, and it was circulated in academic circles as a concise justification for why the subject is important. It attracted independent laudatory notes from Bernard Williams and Simon Blackburn (professors of philosophy at Oxford and Cambridge respectively). A second debate by him on mathematics (&quot;quadratic equations&quot;) was reprinted by the British Association for the History of Mathematics and by the American equivalent body, and is cited by Puzzi in a recent text &quot;The Equation They Couldn&#x27;t Solve&quot;.

The third debate for which McWalter is known was on scientific research. From 2001 he served on the Science and Technology select committee. At his initiative the committee reported in 2004 on the inadequacy of the current research council arrangements for funding research which would be of most immediate use for African countries: The report was strongly commended by the then secretary of state for international development (Hilary Benn) but despite that the report&#x27;s fundamental recommendation (to inaugurate a research council especially for subjects germane to the interests of developing nations) was not acted on. Following the report McWalter hosted a &quot;Science for Africa&quot; debate, but he could not extract from the Minister an agreement to work to change research council structures.

McWalter was one of the one hundred and thirty nine Labour MPs who voted against the principal resolution on the Iraq war on 20 March 2003.

==Personal life==
He married Karen Omer on 30 March 1991. He has one stepson and two daughters.

<text>John David McWilliam (16 May 1941 – 14 November 2009) was a British Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Blaydon from 1979 until he stood down at the 2005 general election.

==Early life==
Born in Grangemouth, the son of Alexander McWilliam, a post office engineer, he went to Leith Academy. He later attended evening classes as a Post Office Telephones Youth in Training at Heriot-Watt Technical College and Napier College of Science and Technology.

==Parliamentary career==
While a City of Edinburgh councillor, McWilliam fought Edinburgh Pentlands in February 1974, but was defeated by Malcolm Rifkind.

<doc id="434736" wikidata="Q695028" url="?curid=434736" title="Khalid Mahmood (British politician)">
<text>Khalid Mahmood (born 13 July 1961) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Perry Barr from 2001 until 2024 when he lost his seat. 

He served on the Labour front bench as a shadow Foreign Office minister under leader Jeremy Corbyn, and a shadow Defence minister under leader Keir Starmer until his resignation in 2021.

== Early life and career ==
Khalid Mahmood was born on 13 July 1961 in Lahore, Punjab. His family moved to Birmingham, England when he was two years old. He studied at UCE Birmingham.

Mahmood is a former engineer with a trade union background. He was a Birmingham City Councillor from 1990 to 1993.

== Political career ==
Mahmood was elected as MP for Birmingham Perry Barr at the 2001 general election with 46.5% of the vote and a majority of 8,753.

In November 2001, an article supportive of the war in Afghanistan was published in &quot;The Observer&quot; under Mahmood&#x27;s name, headlined &quot;The Five Myths Muslims Must Deny&quot;. A few days later however, it was revealed that the article had not in fact been written by Mahmood, but by fellow Labour MP Denis MacShane; Mahmood had agreed to put his name to the article after Lord Ahmed of Rotherham had refused. Mahmood&#x27;s actions were condemned by Inayat Bunglawala from the Muslim Council of Britain, who said that &quot;[after] Lord Ahmed refused, MacShane then found Mahmood—universally regarded as being not exactly the brightest spark in parliament—to be a more willing instrument for his scheme&quot;.

Mahmood absented himself from the 18 March 2003 vote in which the Commons called for the invasion of Iraq, but in 25 November 2002 had voted against even requiring a vote in the Commons before the Blair government could invade Iraq. In 2006, he notoriously claimed that those calling for an inquiry into the invasion and the false claims that he and the Blair government had made to justify the invasion were encouraging attacks by Iraqi freedom fighters that purportedly killed civilians.

He was re-elected as MP for Birmingham Perry Barr at the 2005 general election with an increased vote share of 47% and a decreased majority of 7,948. In November 2005 he was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Tony McNulty, then a minister in the Home Office. He resigned in September 2006 along with several colleagues after signing a letter calling for Tony Blair to resign as prime minister.

In May 2009, it was reported, as part of a series of leaked UK MPs expense details, that Mahmood claimed for £1,350 to stay in a five-star west London hotel with his girlfriend. He also claimed more than £35,000 in expenses for food over eight years.

At the 2010 general election, Mahmood was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 50.3% and an increased majority of 11,908.

Mahmood opposed the decision by Birmingham Metropolitan College in September 2013 to ban students wearing veils. 

In January 2015, he was nominated for the Politician of the Year award at the British Muslim Awards.

At the 2015 general election, Mahmood was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 57.4% and an increased majority of 14,828.

He initially supported Brexit in the 2016 European Union membership referendum, but switched his support to Remain just before the vote.

At the snap 2017 general election, Mahmood was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 68.1% and an increased majority of 18,383.

In May 2019, it was reported by the &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot; that Mahmood was the most expensive Birmingham MP in 2018, claiming £210,183 in expenses.

At the snap 2019 general election, Mahmood was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 63.1% and a decreased majority of 15,317.

In December 2019 he announced that he would stand in the 2020 Labour Party deputy leadership election, but pulled out of the contest in January 2020. 

In March 2020, Mahmood defended the anti-racist campaigner Trevor Phillips from claims of Islamophobia, saying that Labour had &quot;lost its way&quot; after it had suspended Phillips. Mahmood said that the move to discipline Phillips had brought &quot;disrepute&quot; on the party.

After Keir Starmer in April 2020 became leader of the Labour Party, Mahmood was appointed as Shadow Minister for Defence Procurement.

As of March 2021, Mahmood is a member of seven All-Party Parliamentary Groups, namely the groups for Bahrain, Cyber Security, International Relations, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Sovereign Defence Capability, and Terrorism.

On 13 April 2021, Mahmood resigned from the shadow frontbench, saying that his party had been taken over by &quot;a London-based bourgeoisie, with the support of brigades of woke social media warriors&quot;. He later spoke to &quot;Spiked&quot; about his decision.

Mahmood has always maintained that the Trojan Horse scandal, a conspiracy theory which claimed that Muslims whom he opposed were conspiring to oppose Zionism in British schools, involved genuine fears that non-violent extreme Islamist attitudes had infiltrated various Birmingham schools. He contributed an introduction to this effect in the Policy Exchange report into the topic published in December 2022.

In June 2024, Mahmood was reselected as the Labour candidate for Birmingham Perry Barr at the 2024 general election. He was defeated by independent candidate Ayoub Khan.

Mahmood is a member of Unite the Union.

== Personal life ==
=== Kidney failure ===
In January 2014, Mahmood underwent a kidney transplant at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Edgbaston, Birmingham, receiving an organ from a donor later revealed to be the Labour politician Siôn Simon. He had been on dialysis, following kidney failure in 2008. His twin brother had previously died from kidney failure.

In August 2018, it was reported that Mahmood became involved in an employment tribunal over alleged religious discrimination brought about by his parliamentary assistant, Elaina Cohen, who is Jewish and with whom he was formerly in a 17-year relationship. It emerged that the costs of the legal battle were covered by a Parliamentary expenses system, which was ultimately funded by the taxpayer. The total cost to the taxpayer was reported to be almost £40,000. In August 2022, Mahmood lost the claim against Cohen, with the court finding that she was unfairly dismissed and &#x27;isolated&#x27; by her boss after raising concerns about alleged criminal actions by a colleague. The panel also ruled she had suffered detriment as a result of making a &#x27;protected disclosure&#x27; in that she was &#x27;marginalised and isolated in the period January 2020 until her dismissal&#x27;.

=== Vaccination ===
It was reported that, despite being in Tier 4 of the Government&#x27;s priority list for the UK&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccination, Mahmood was vaccinated in December 2020 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, contrary to calls from National Health Service management that the public would be turned away without an appointment.

<text>Humfrey Jonathon Malins CBE (born 31 July 1945) is a British Conservative Party politician, who was Member of Parliament (MP) for Croydon North West and later Woking.

==Early life and career==
Malins was born in Nuneaton, Warwickshire and educated at St John&#x27;s School, Leatherhead and Brasenose College, Oxford; he gained an MA in Jurisprudence in 1967. He qualified as a solicitor in 1971 and worked in a major Surrey law firm from 1975 to 1988. From 1973 to 1983, Malins was a member of Mole Valley District Council.

He contested Liverpool Toxteth in both 1974 general elections and Lewisham East in the 1979 general election.

==Parliamentary career==
In the 1983 general election, Malins was elected MP for Croydon North West, defeating Bill Pitt who had been the constituency&#x27;s MP since the 1981 by-election. Malins spent most of his first period as an MP on the backbenches, but was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Tim Renton from 1987 to 1989 and then Virginia Bottomley from 1989 to 1992.

In the 1992 general election, he was defeated for re-election by the Labour candidate Malcolm Wicks. In 1993, he founded the Immigration Advisory Service, a charitable organisation providing free legal advice on immigration and asylum issues. He became a District Judge in 1991 and in 1996 became a Recorder at the Crown Court. In 1997 he was made a commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to immigration policy.

At the 1997 general election, he was selected for the safe Conservative seat of Woking. On his return to Parliament, he became a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee.

Malins supported Kenneth Clarke&#x27;s failed bid in the 2001 leadership contest, but nonetheless was appointed to Iain Duncan Smith&#x27;s front bench team as a junior home affairs spokesman.

In March 2003, he resigned from the opposition front bench in protest at their support of the Invasion of Iraq. He was later re-appointed to the front bench as a shadow home affairs minister when Michael Howard became leader in November 2003, but returned to the backbenches under David Cameron.

He announced in March 2009 his intention to stand down, and left parliament at the 2010 general election.

==Personal life==
He married Lynda on 21 July 1979 in Greenwich. They have a son Harry and daughter, Katherine.

<text>Yossi &amp; Jagger () is a 2002 Israeli romantic drama film directed by Eytan Fox about soldiers at the Israel–Lebanon border who try to find some peace and solace from the daily routine of war.

The film has a sequel entitled &quot;Yossi&quot; ( &quot;Yossi&#x27;s Story&quot;) released in 2012 that picks up the story a number of years after the events in the first film.

==Plot==
Yossi (Ohad Knoller) commands a company of soldiers in the snow-covered mountains near Lebanon. In secrecy, he leads a passionate romantic relationship with his second-in-command officer, Lior (Yehuda Levi), who is called Jagger by everyone for his rock star-like handsomeness and his lip-syncing Mick Jagger.
The pair, Yossi and Jagger, lead a loving, yet secret life together, venturing off to be alone and open with one another.
One day, a colonel (Sharon Raginiano) arrives at the base with two female soldiers, one of whom he immediately sleeps with in the bunker. The other one, Yaeli (Aya Koren, credited as Aya Steinovitz), is very interested in Jagger, while she refuses the sexual advances of Ofir (Asi Cohen), who tries to make clear to her that Jagger is not particularly interested in her.

The colonel is there to supervise a night-time ambush, of which Yossi is resentful because of the full moon, and also because he fears for his soldiers&#x27; safety. And indeed Jagger is fatally injured that night, dying in the arms of his lover, who only now is able to articulate his love for him.

At the funeral reception at Jagger&#x27;s parents&#x27; house, Jagger&#x27;s mother mistakes Yaeli for his girlfriend. She laments that she knew very little about her son, including his favorite song, which only Yossi is able to tell her was &quot;Bo&quot; sung by Rita. The song was also sung by Ivri Lider.

==Cast==
* Ohad Knoller as Yossi
* Yehuda Levi as Lior Amichai &#x27;Jagger&#x27;
* Assi Cohen as Ophir
* Aya Steinovitz as Yaeli
* Hani Furstenberg as Goldie
* Sharon Raginiano as The Colonel
* Yuval Semo as Psycho
* Yaniv Moyal as Samoncha
* Hanan Savyon as Adams
* Erez Kahana as Yaniv the Cook
* Shmulik Bernheimer as Shmuel &#x27;Shmulik&#x27; Amichai
* Yael Pearl as Varda Amichai

==Production==
Although &quot;Yossi &amp; Jagger&quot; originally didn&#x27;t receive any support from the Israeli military during its production, its popularity proved high enough with Israeli citizens that military bases in the country began to show screenings later on.

==Reception==
The film received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 88% out of 42 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with the site&#x27;s consensus being &quot;A tersely told yet deeply felt romance.&quot; At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from mainstream critics, the film received an average score of 70, based on 19 reviews. Stephen Holden from &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;If the situation has all the ingredients of a shrill, tearful melodrama, the filmmaker, working from a taut screenplay by Avner Bernheimer that doesn’t waste a word or a gesture, keeps the emotional lid firmly in place.&quot; Ella Taylor from &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot; wrote &quot;Enlivened by journalist Avner Bernheimer’s delicately witty script and some lively ensemble performances under the direction of Eytan Fox, the film offers a haunting portrait of a generation forced to risk their lives in the service of military goals they’re far from totally committed to.&quot; Wesley Morris from the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; wrote &quot;What the movie lacks in ambition, originality, and grit, it makes up for in pure feeling.&quot;

Actor Ohad Knoller won the award for best actor at the 2003 Tribeca Film Festival, for his portrayal of Yossi.

The film did not receive production assistance from the Israeli army but proved to be popular in Israel and was later shown on military bases.

<text>John Mann, Baron Mann (born 10 January 1960) is a British Labour Party politician who is a Member of the House of Lords. Before being granted a peerage, he was the Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Bassetlaw from the 2001 general election until 2019.

Mann served on the Treasury Select Committee. He had been the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Tessa Jowell and Richard Caborn. Mann is also a prominent campaigner against antisemitism. In 2019, he stood down as an MP before the general election and took up a full-time role as the UK Government&#x27;s independent adviser on antisemitism in the United Kingdom, at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.

Mann was nominated as a life peer in the House of Lords by Prime Minister Theresa May in her resignation honours list. He resigned his Commons seat on 28 October. He retook the Labour whip in May 2024.

==Early life and career==
Mann is the son of Brenda (&quot;née&quot; Cleavin) and James Mann. He attended Waterloo Infants school and Pudsey Waterloo Junior school in Pudsey, Yorkshire, then won a County Council scholarship to the private Bradford Grammar School. He holds a degree in Economics from the University of Manchester and a Diploma in Training Management.

Active in the Labour Party from his youth (Pudsey South Labour Party), he was formerly a councillor in the London Borough of Lambeth. He was chair of the National Organisation of Labour Students in 1983 and 1984, and as a consequence a member of Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee. He subsequently co-authored a Fabian Society tract on the organisation of Labour&#x27;s youth wing, which formed the basis of the later reorganisation of the youth wing by Tom Sawyer to reduce the influence of Militant tendency.

Before entering Parliament he worked for the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union as Head of Research and Education and as the National Training Officer at the TUC National Education Centre in North London (now defunct). Mann was national trade union officer for the 1997 general election. He also was involved in running a family business organising international conferences, interpretation, translation, microphone hire and sound systems, alongside his trades union work.

==Parliamentary career==
Mann sought and failed to be selected as Labour candidate in a by-election for the Yorkshire South constituency for the European Parliament in 1998, losing out to Linda McAvan who went on to win the by-election. Mann was first elected as MP for Bassetlaw at the 2001 general election after the previous MP Joe Ashton retired, and retained his seat at each subsequent election in which he stood.

Mann was the first Labour MP to call for Gordon Brown to resign following the 2010 general election. Mann was also vocal in criticising other MPs over the expenses scandal, arguing that they could not be trusted to self-regulate. He criticised the shredding of documents related to expenses before 2010, saying &quot;it looks like MPs trying to protect MPs again&quot;. He was also responsible for lodging the complaint that resulted in an inquiry into Maria Miller&#x27;s expense claims.

During the 2015 leadership campaign, he wrote an open letter to Jeremy Corbyn saying that it would be &quot;inappropriate&quot; for him to become Labour leader due to allegations that he had failed to act over allegations of child abuse in his constituency. Just over two months after Corbyn had won the leadership campaign, Mann continued to refuse to back him in an interview with the BBC, indicating he had no confidence in him. Instead, he said that he had confidence in the then shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn. He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Corbyn in the 2016 Labour leadership election.

Mann faced criticism for allegedly perpetuating racial stereotypes against Romani people and travellers in a booklet he produced on antisocial behaviour in 2007.
===Drug policy===
One of Mann&#x27;s earliest campaigns in his constituency was his inquiry into heroin use in the area. In September 2002, Mann called for more treatment for heroin users in North Nottinghamshire. The inquiry he instigated called for heroin addicts to be given the choice between treatment or prison. At the same time more local GPs were trained to help heroin addicts get their lives back under control. Following the reforms the number of addicts in treatment in Bassetlaw rose from 2 to 400, and acquisitive crime fell by 75%.

Following a local newspaper story in October 2005, Mann raised an Early day motion calling for the psychoactive plant species, &quot;Salvia divinorum&quot;, to be banned in the UK (EDM796). The motion only received 11 signatures. 

It was later reported that Mann had written to the Home Secretary in October 2008, urging her to take action with regard to salvia&#x27;s legal status. The same report said that the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs had met to discuss salvia, among other substances, in April 2009, and that there would be a follow-up meeting in May. &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper gave the content of Mann&#x27;s letter to Jacqui Smith. &quot;Sadly the issue has come to light again as our young people are using the internet and sites like YouTube to broadcast their friends taking the drug and witnessing the hallucinogenic effects. Our young people are at risk and a wider cultural attachment to this drug seems to be developing that I am sure you agree – regardless of its legal status – needs nipping in the bud&quot;.

===Local campaigns===
Mann was an active campaigner in his constituency of Bassetlaw, and an advocate of using campaigning strategies he refers to as &quot;organising to win&quot; elsewhere. He has organised numerous campaigns in his constituency, examples of which include, during 2003 and 2004, campaigning to save Bassetlaw Hospital Accident and Emergency Department, helping former coal miners fight double charging solicitors to get their compensation back, and fighting Bassetlaw District Council&#x27;s policy of &quot;topple testing&quot; headstones in local cemeteries. Mann kept a weekly column in the &quot;Worksop Guardian&quot; and – along with other local figures – wrote occasional pieces for the &quot;Retford Times&quot;.

===Operation Midland===
In December 2014, Mann gave a dossier, compiled by him and containing child sexual abuse allegations against 22 high-profile individuals, to the Metropolitan Police, which as part of Operation Midland was pursuing investigations into homicide and child abuse allegedly committed some decades previously at the Dolphin Square apartment building in Pimlico, London. Mann said that he had made a detailed examination of hundreds of pieces of evidence from members of the public and that he believed some of the twelve former UK government ministers named were &quot;definitely child abusers&quot;. He said that evidence against half of those on the list was &quot;very compelling&quot; and that some could &quot;definitely be prosecuted&quot;. Operation Midland was closed in 2016 when the allegations were found to be false.

===Stance on antisemitism===
Mann has described antisemitism as &quot;the worst of racisms&quot;, and chaired the All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Antisemitism during 2004–2019. In May 2009, Mann received the American Jewish Committee&#x27;s Jan Karski Award in recognition of his commitment to fighting antisemitism in all of its forms.

On 28 April 2016, Mann confronted Ken Livingstone in a public stairwell in front of a news camera crew, calling him a &quot;Nazi apologist&quot; and a &quot;fucking disgrace&quot; over Livingstone&#x27;s remarks in a radio interview that Adolf Hitler, on coming to power, supported Jewish emigration to Palestine. Labour&#x27;s chief whip, Rosie Winterton, told Mann it was &quot;completely inappropriate for Labour members of Parliament to be involved in very public rows on the television&quot;.

Mann wrote in &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; in early May 2016: &quot;If Labour cannot combat racism then we are nothing – and racism always includes antisemitism. If we cannot do that now, then we have no reason to exist&quot;. In June 2017, he criticised Corbyn as &quot;a man who claims he&#x27;s dedicated his entire life to racism&quot;(sic) but was &quot;not prepared to make a speech exclusively, explicitly, just on antisemitism&quot;. In September 2019, upon his announcement that he was leaving the Commons, Mann said he would &quot;never forgive&quot; Corbyn, believing he had allowed the party to be &quot;hijacked&quot; by antisemitic bigots.

In July 2019, Prime Minister Theresa May appointed Mann as a government advisor on antisemitism. In September 2019, Mann announced that he was taking up a full-time role as the government&#x27;s antisemitism advisor.

===Brexit===
Mann announced he would vote to leave the EU in the June 2016 referendum, saying he believed Labour voters &quot;fundamentally disagree&quot; with Labour&#x27;s official stance. His own constituency voted to leave by a margin of 68% to 32%.

Mann was one of only three Labour MPs, along with Ian Austin and Kevin Barron, to defy a three-line whip and to vote for Theresa May&#x27;s Brexit deal in the 15 January 2019 Meaningful vote. On 29 January 2019, Mann was one of seven Labour MPs to vote with the Conservative Government supporting Graham Brady&#x27;s amendment mandating Theresa May to renegotiate the Irish backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement. The other six MPs were Austin, Barron, Jim Fitzpatrick, Roger Godsiff, Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer. 

On 3 April 2019, Mann was one of twelve Labour and ex-Labour MPs to vote alongside the Conservatives against the Cooper Bill, which had been supported by the Labour Party. Nonetheless, the bill passed the House of Commons with a difference of one vote. On 3 September 2019, Mann and Hoey were the only Labour MPs to vote with the Government in an attempt to prevent MPs from taking control of the house to block a potential no-deal Brexit, saying &quot;I didn&#x27;t vote with the government. I voted against an amendment that is deliberately calculated to block Brexit&quot;.

==House of Lords==
On 7 September 2019, Mann announced that he would not stand as an MP at the next general election to take up a full-time role as the government&#x27;s antisemitism advisor, citing his belief that Corbyn was unfit to become Prime Minister for his mishandling of allegations of antisemitism within the Labour Party. Two days later, it was reported in &quot;The Times&quot; that Theresa May&#x27;s resignation honours list was held up by a row over her decision to give Mann a life peerage and that the independent watchdog on Lords appointments warned it would set a dangerous precedent and could be seen as a bribe for his support of her Brexit withdrawal bill. He was created Baron Mann, &quot;of Holbeck Moor in the City of Leeds&quot;, on 28 October 2019, and was introduced to the House of Lords the next day.

==Personal life==
Mann married Jo White in July 1986 in Leeds. White was a Labour councillor and was deputy leader of Bassetlaw District Council, and was employed by her husband as a part-time office manager, remunerated through his parliamentary expenses. The couple have two adult daughters and a son. He supports Leeds United. White was selected as Labour&#x27;s parliamentary candidate for Bassetlaw in August 2022 and was elected in the 2024 general election.

<text>James Marshall (13 March 1941 – 27 May 2004) was a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom.

==Education==
Marshall was born into a working-class family in the Attercliffe district of Sheffield. He was educated at Sheffield City Grammar School (now called The City School) on &quot;Orchard Lane&quot; and the University of Leeds, gaining a BSc in Physics in 1963 and PhD in 1968. He worked as a research scientist at the Wool Industries Research Association (became the Wira Technology Group, then British Textile Technology Group) in West Park, Leeds from 1963 to 1967. He was a councillor on Leeds City Council from 1965 to 1969.

==Politics==
In 1968, he became a lecturer at Leicester Polytechnic remaining until 1974, and in 1971 he was elected to Leicester City Council, becoming leader of the council in 1973. He contested the Harborough seat in the 1970 general election. In the February general election of 1974 he contested the constituency of Leicester South, and unseated the Conservative MP, Tom Boardman, in the October election that year. He held the seat until his death, with the exception of the period 1983–1987, when he lost the seat to the Conservative Derek Spencer by seven votes in the 1983 national election. During his time out of parliament, he worked as a supply teacher and market trader, developing a stronger, more community-oriented reputation.

Marshall was an assistant whip between 1977 and the end of James Callaghan&#x27;s government in 1979. In opposition, he was assistant home affairs spokesman from 1982 to 1983, serving just below Roy Hattersley in Michael Foot&#x27;s shadow cabinet, and deputy shadow spokesman on Northern Ireland from 1987 to 1992, serving under Kevin McNamara in Neil Kinnock&#x27;s shadow cabinet. In the 1992 Labour Party leadership election, which followed the resignation of Kinnock, he voted for Bryan Gould, seen as the left-wing candidate. The victorious candidate, John Smith, dispensed with Marshall&#x27;s services, and Marshall&#x27;s support for Margaret Beckett in the 1994 leadership election occasioned by Smith&#x27;s death did not endear him to subsequent leader Tony Blair. Increasingly out of step with the mainstream of the Labour Party, he concentrated on constituency matters and rebelled against Blair&#x27;s government many times, chiefly on matters relating to immigration and education. His constituency work, especially on immigration and benefit problems, won him strong personal support among local voters. Labour party chairman Ian McCartney described him as &quot;a hard-working and dedicated member of parliament who spoke up for his Leicester constituents and did a great deal to help to transform their communities and the opportunities open to them.&quot; 

==Personal life and death==
Marshall married Shirley Ellis on 9 June 1962 in Sheffield, and they had a son and daughter. They divorced and he married Susan Carter on 15 July 1986 in Leicester.

Marshall died suddenly and unexpectedly of a heart attack, precipitating a by-election dominated by the invasion of Iraq (which he had opposed).

<doc id="434750" wikidata="Q255448" url="?curid=434750" title="Porcia (wife of Brutus)">
<text>Porcia ( – June 43 BC), occasionally spelled Portia, especially in 18th-century English literature, was a Roman woman who lived in the 1st century BC. She was the daughter of Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis (Cato the Younger) and his first wife Atilia. She is best known for being the second wife of Marcus Junius Brutus, the most famous of Julius Caesar&#x27;s assassins, and appears primarily in the letters of Cicero.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Porcia was born around 73 BC. She had an affectionate nature, was interested in philosophy, and was &quot;full of an understanding courage.&quot; Plutarch describes her as being prime of youth and beauty. When she was still very young, her father divorced her mother for adultery.

At a young age she was married first to Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, her father&#x27;s political ally, between 58 BC and 53 BC. Porcia&#x27;s father was a member of the Roman Optimate faction, and adamantly opposed Julius Caesar. Porcia embraced these ideals, and did not outwardly object to the arranged marriage. With Bibulus she had two children, at least one of them a son. Lucius Calpurnius Bibulus (born around 59 BC) was possibly one of them, although most modern historians believe Porcia was too young to have mothered Lucius, and that he was Bibulus&#x27; son by his previous marriage, as he was old enough to fight in the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. He died in 32 BC. It is possible that a son of Porcia and Bibulus was the man who wrote the biography of Brutus.

A few years later, Quintus Hortensius applied to Cato, asking for Porcia&#x27;s hand in marriage. Bibulus, who was infatuated with his wife, was unwilling to let her go. Hortensius offered to marry her and then return her to Bibulus once she had given birth to a male heir. Such an arrangement was not uncommon at the time. He argued that it was against natural law to keep a girl of Porcia&#x27;s youth and beauty from producing children for his allies and impractical for her to overproduce for Bibulus. Nonetheless, Bibulus refused to divorce her. Cato disliked the idea of marrying his daughter to a man who was four times her age, and refused to break an arranged contract he held with Biblius. Instead, Cato divorced his wife, Porcia&#x27;s stepmother Marcia, and gave her to Hortensius; he remarried her after Hortensius died.

In 52 BC, Julius Caesar&#x27;s Gallic Wars came to an end, but he refused to return to Rome, despite the Senate&#x27;s demands that he lay down his arms. Cato personally detested Caesar, and was his greatest enemy in the Senate; Cato&#x27;s political faction, the Optimates (also known as the Boni), believed that Caesar should return to Rome, in order for the Optimates to strip him of his property and &quot;dignitas&quot;, and permanently exile Caesar. In 49 BC, Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his army, thus declaring war, beginning the Great Roman Civil War. Both Cato and Bibulus allied with Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus against Caesar. Though both Boni hated Pompey, he did not pose the threat to their faction that Caesar did. Bibulus commanded Pompey&#x27;s navy in the Adriatic Sea. He captured a part of Caesar&#x27;s fleet, although this was generally insignificant as Caesar went on to decisively defeat Pompey at the Battle of Pharsalus. Bibulus died in 48 BC from influenza following Pompey&#x27;s defeat, leaving Porcia a widow.

In 46 BC, Cato committed suicide following his defeat in the battle of Thapsus while Marcus Cato, Porcia&#x27;s brother, was pardoned by Caesar and returned to Rome.

===Marriage to Brutus===
Brutus, Porcia&#x27;s first cousin, divorced his wife Claudia and married Porcia in 45 BC. The marriage was scandalous as Brutus did not state any reasons for divorce despite having been married to Claudia for many years. Claudia was very popular for being a woman of great virtue, and was the daughter of Appius Claudius Pulcher, who had been Brutus&#x27;s ally for many years. She was also related to Pompey by marriage through her younger sister. The divorce was not well received by some, including Brutus&#x27;s mother, Servilia, who despised her half-brother, and appears to have been jealous of Brutus&#x27;s affection for Porcia. Therefore, Servilia supported Claudia&#x27;s interests against those of Porcia.

On the other hand, Porcia was highly favoured with the followers of both Pompey and Cato, so the marriage was favoured by people such as Marcus Tullius Cicero and Titus Pomponius Atticus. The marriage was Brutus&#x27;s way of honouring his uncle. Nonetheless, it appears that Porcia deeply loved Brutus and was utterly devoted to him. She resolved not to inquire into Brutus&#x27;s secrets before she had made a trial of herself and that she would bid defiance to pain.

Brutus, along with many other co-conspirators, murdered Caesar in 44 BC. He promised to share the &quot;heavy secrets&quot; of his heart with his wife but it is unclear if he ever got the chance. Some historians believe Porcia may have known about the plot, and may have even been involved in the conspiracy itself. Plutarch claims that she happened upon Brutus while he was pondering over what to do about Caesar and asked him what was wrong. When he did not answer, she suspected that he distrusted her on account of her being a woman, for fear she might reveal something, however unwillingly, under torture. In order to prove herself to him, she secretly inflicted a wound upon her own thigh with a barber&#x27;s knife to see if she could endure the pain. As a result of the wound, she suffered from violent pains, chills and fever. Some believe that she endured the pain of her untreated wound for at least a day. As soon as she overcame her pain, she returned to Brutus and said:

Brutus marveled when he saw the gash on her thigh and after hearing this he no longer hid anything from her, but felt strengthened himself and promised to relate the whole plot. Lifting his hands above him, he is said to have prayed that he might succeed in his undertaking and thus show himself a worthy husband. Yet Brutus never got the chance as they were interrupted and never had a moment&#x27;s privacy before the conspiracy was carried out. On the day of Caesar&#x27;s assassination, Porcia was extremely disturbed with anxiety and sent messengers to the Senate to check that Brutus was still alive. She worked herself up to the point whereupon her fainting, her maids feared that she was dying.

When Brutus and the other assassins fled Rome to Athens, it was agreed that Porcia should stay in Italy. Porcia was overcome with grief to part from Brutus, but tried hard to conceal it. When she came across a painting depicting the parting of Hector from Andromache in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, however, she burst into tears, feeling it reflected her own sorrow. She would go on to visit this painting multiple times per day. Brutus&#x27; friend Acilius heard of this, and quoted Homer where Andromache speaks to Hector:

Brutus smiled, saying he would never say to Porcia what Hector said to Andromache in return (&quot;Ply loom and distaff and give orders to thy maids&quot;), saying of Porcia:

===Death===

Porcia&#x27;s death has been a fixation for many historians and writers. It was believed by a majority of contemporary historians that Porcia committed suicide in 42 BC, reputedly by swallowing hot coals. Modern historians find this tale implausible, however, and one popular speculation has Porcia taking her life by burning charcoal in an unventilated room, thus succumbing to carbon monoxide poisoning.

The exact timing of Porcia&#x27;s death is also a problem. Some modern classicists like John H. Collins assert that she died in the summer of 43 BC. Most contemporary historians, however, (Cassius Dio, Valerius Maximus, and Appian) claim that she killed herself after hearing that Brutus had died following the second battle of Philippi. Nicolaus says it happened before Brutus&#x27; death, however, saying she died following the first battle of Philippi, claiming that she only thought he was dead, and that Brutus wrote a letter to their friends in Rome, blaming them for Porcia&#x27;s suicide. Plutarch dismisses Nicolaus&#x27; claims of a letter stating that too much was disclosed in the letter for it to be genuine. Plutarch also repeats the story of swallowing charcoal, but disbelieves it: As for Porcia, the wife of Brutus, Nicolaüs the philosopher, as well as Valerius Maximus, relates that she now desired to die, but was opposed by all her friends, who kept strict watch upon her; whereupon she snatched up live coals from the fire, swallowed them, kept her mouth fast closed, and thus made away with herself. And yet there is extant a letter of Brutus to his friends in which he chides them with regard to Porcia and laments her fate, because she was neglected by them and therefore driven by illness to prefer death to life. It would seem, then, that Nicolaüs was mistaken in the time of her death, since her distemper, her love for Brutus, and the manner of her death, are also indicated in the letter, if, indeed, it is a genuine one.

Plutarch also acknowledges the false image that Porcia displays, explaining that she was &quot;frightened with every little noise and cry,&quot; &quot;possessed with the fury of the Bacchantes,&quot; and had passed out and carried into her home. Plutarch&#x27;s description of Camma in &quot;Dialogue of Love&quot; is similar to his interpretation of Porcia in &quot;Brutus,&quot; and with both works being written around the same time period, Plutarch&#x27;s anecdotes concerning Camma might have influenced those about Porcia&quot;.&quot; The character of Panthea in Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; also presents similarities to Plutarch&#x27;s Porciawith both women expressing to their husbands that they are truly devoted, and are willing to harm themselves to prove themselvesbeing another possible inspiration for Plutarch&#x27;s portrayal of Porcia. In totality, Plutarch accentuates Porcia&#x27;s role as loyal wife using his portrayal of her suicide.

According to the political journalist and classicist Garry Wills, although Shakespeare has Porcia die by the method Plutarch repeats, but rejects, &quot;the historical Porcia died of illness (possibly of plague) a year before the battle of Philippi&quot;...“but Valerius Maximus [mistakenly] wrote that she killed herself at news of Brutus’s death in that battle. This was the version of the story celebrated in works like Martial&#x27;s &quot;Epigram&quot; 1.42.&quot; The claim that Porcia&#x27;s death occurred before that of Brutus is backed up by a letter sent by Cicero. This letter would have been sent in late June or early July 43 BC, before either battle of Philippi. It further suggests that Porcia did not commit suicide, but died of some lingering illness. As Plutarch states, if the letter was genuine Brutus lamented her death and blamed their friends for not looking after her. There is also an earlier letter from Brutus to Atticus, which hints at Porcia&#x27;s illness and compliments him for taking care of her. Cicero later wrote his surviving letter to Brutus, consoling him in his grief, calling Porcia &quot;one such as never before has been in the world.&quot; This is probably the most accurate account of Porcia&#x27;s death.

== Portia in popular culture ==
===Literature===

====Classic====
* In Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, she appears in fictionalised form as Brutus&#x27; wife. She makes only two appearances. Portia and Calpurnia are the only two substantial female roles in the play. It is reported in the fourth act that she died by swallowing fire.
* Portia is also briefly mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; in regards to the character of her namesake, Portia:

: In Belmont is a lady richly left;
: And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
: Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
: I did receive fair speechless messages:
: Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
: To Cato&#x27;s daughter, Brutus&#x27; Portia.
* In Robert Garnier&#x27;s play &quot;Porcie&quot;, she is the heroine of the play, which describes her suicide. In the play, she is devastated to hear of the death of her husband and kills herself. Her servant announces to the Romans that Portia died swallowing live coals, before taking her own life with a dagger.
* In &quot;The Purgatory of Suicide&quot; by Thomas Cooper, Portia is one of the suicides spoken of in the poem. Here Portia&#x27;s life is compared to the death of Arria, Pœtus&#x27; wife.

====Modern====
* In &quot;Masters of Rome&quot;, a series of seven novels by the Australian writer Colleen McCullough, Portia appears as a child in &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Women&quot;, as a teenager in &quot;Caesar&quot; and as a young woman in &quot;The October Horse&quot;. Portia is portrayed as being, first a rabid unthinking follower of republican values, then as a raving maniac, and then as perhaps totally insane. Servilia, who abuses her constantly, later writes to Brutus before the battle of Philippi to inform him that Portia went mad and killed herself by swallowing live coals. Brutus, however, recognizes that it is more likely that Servilia murdered Portia by forcing burning coals down her throat. Given the vicious character of Servilia in the novel, this murder is perfectly believable.
* She appears in &quot;The Ides of March&quot;, an epistolary novel by Thornton Wilder, describing the events leading up to the death of Julius Caesar. Portia is one of the main characters in fourth part of the book. Cicero speaks of her as the only person that Brutus loves. Portia and Servilia exchange several letters, hinting towards Servilia&#x27;s dislike of her. Caesar later sends a letter to Portia informing her that Brutus is returning to Rome, and Portia replies with a polite thank you; Caesar later confesses to Lucius Mamilius Turrinus (the chief character) that he greatly envies Brutus his marriage to her and often wishes he could have married her himself.

<doc id="434752" wikidata="Q4274006" url="?curid=434752" title="Magic pushbutton">
<text>The magic pushbutton is a common anti-pattern in graphical user interfaces.

At its core, the anti-pattern consists of a system partitioned into two parts: user interface and business logic, that are coupled through a &quot;single&quot; point, clicking the &quot;magic pushbutton&quot; or submitting a form of data. As it is a single point interface, this interface becomes over-complicated to implement. The temporal coupling of these units is a major problem: every interaction in the user interface must happen &quot;before&quot; the pushbutton is pressed, business logic can only be applied &quot;after&quot; the button was pressed. Cohesion of each unit also tends to be poor: features are bundled together whether they warrant this or not, simply because there is no other structured place in which to put them.

== Drawbacks ==

=== For users ===
To a user, a magic pushbutton system appears clumsy and frustrating to use. Business logic is unavailable before the button press, so the user interface appears as a bland form-filling exercise. There is no opportunity for assistance in filling out fields, or for offering drop-down lists of acceptable values. In particular, it is impossible to provide assistance with later fields, based on entries already placed in earlier fields. For instance, a choice from a very large list of insurance claim codes might be filtered to a much smaller list, if the user has already selected Home/Car/Pet insurance, or if they have already entered their own identification and so the system can determine the set of risks for which they&#x27;re actually covered, omitting the obscure policies that are now known to be irrelevant for this transaction.

One of the most off-putting aspects of a magic pushbutton is its tendency for the user interaction to proceed by entering a large volume of data, then having it rejected for some unexpected reason. This is particularly poor design when it is combined with the infamous &quot;Redo from scratch&quot; messages of older systems. Even where a form is returned with the entered data preserved and the problem field highlighted, it is still off-putting to users to have to return to a field that they thought they had completed some minutes earlier.

These features, and their lack with a magic pushbutton, are particularly important for naive users who are likely to make mistakes, less so for experts or the system&#x27;s own programmers. This type of interface failing has been highlighted by the web, and the need to support more public users, rather than a more traditional user group of role-based office workers, carrying out the same tasks on the same system, over and over. Even though a developer who knows the system intimately and can enter data perfectly the first time around is able to use it efficiently, this is no indication that such a system is suitable for use by its actual users.

=== For implementation ===
The magic pushbutton often arises through poor management of the design process in the early stages, together with a lack of importance placed on user experience, relative to project completion. At a simple view, the simplicity of the magic pushbutton is attractive as it has few user interface modules and their interactions appear simple too. This view hides the complexity inside each module, and also devalues interface quality relative to cost.

== Alternatives ==
In a modern system (i.e., one where processing is cheap and competing interface standards are high), users should simply not be left to enter data for long periods without some automatic interaction to guide, validate, or to tailor the system according to the developing state of the data they&#x27;ve so far entered. Leaving them alone to &quot;just get on with it&quot;, then validating everything at the end, means that the corrections needed will be detected further and further from when that data was entered. As an &quot;a priori&quot; principle, corrections needed should be highlighted as soon and as close to when they are either entered, or could first be identified.

In an event-driven interface, most events triggered by the &quot;completion&quot; of a field will present an opportunity to either validate that field, or to guide the choices for entering the next. They may even control which field the user is taken to next: sub-sections of a form are often made relevant or irrelevant by values entered early on, and users should not need to manually skip these, if it can be done for them.

In this scenario, the programmer draws the user interface first and then writes the business logic in the automatically created methods.

== Example ==
The following is a typical example of a magic pushbutton in Borland Delphi:

procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
var
 reg: TRegistry;
begin
 reg := TRegistry.Create;
 try
 reg.RootKey := HKey_Current_User;
 if reg.OpenKey(&#x27;\Software\MyCompany&#x27;, true) then
 begin
 reg.WriteString(&#x27;Filename&#x27;, Edit1.Text);
 end;
 finally
 reg.Free;
 end;
end;
A better way to do this is to refactor the business logic (in this example storing the filename to the registry) into a separate class.
type
 TPreferences = class
 private
 FFilename: String;
 procedure SetFilename(const Value: String);
 public
 property Filename: String read FFilename write SetFilename;
 procedure Load;
 procedure Save;
 end;
and call this class Save method from the Click handler:
procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
begin
 Preferences.Save;
end;

procedure TForm1.Edit1Change(Sender: TObject);
begin
 Preferences.Filename := Edit1.Text;
end;

<text>Stormtroopers of Death (abbreviated to S.O.D.) was an American crossover thrash band formed in New York City in 1985. They are credited as being amongst the first groups to fuse hardcore punk with thrash metal into a style often referred to as crossover thrash. The band is also known for reuniting Anthrax members, guitarist Scott Ian and drummer Charlie Benante, with their former bassist Dan Lilker. Their instrumental song &quot;March of the S.O.D.&quot; from their 1985 debut album, &quot;Speak English or Die&quot;, was the &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; intro anthem for many years. Another song from the same album, &quot;Chromatic Death&quot;, was also used during the show as a segue between ads and videos.

The band was controversial due to their deliberately offensive explicit lyrics. Ian described the songs on &quot;Speak English Or Die&quot; as &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;just a big inside joke&quot;, adding: &quot;Some people thought we were racist, and those people are stupid.&quot; Bassist Dan Lilker stated: &quot;The lyrics were never intended to be serious, just to piss people off.&quot; The band had several periods of inactivity following their formation in 1985. According to singer Billy Milano, the 24-song extended play of live and unreleased material called &quot;Rise of the Infidels&quot;, released in August 2007 by Megaforce Records, &quot;will finally be the last of S.O.D.&quot;, laying to rest rumors of another reunion.

==History==
===&quot;Speak English or Die&quot; and first hiatus (1985–1991)===
After finishing his guitar tracks on the Anthrax album &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot;, Scott Ian would draw pictures of a character known as &quot;Sargent D.&quot; The pictures would be accompanied by slogans such as &quot;I&#x27;m not racist; I hate everyone&quot; and &quot;Speak English or Die&quot;, and Ian would write lyrics about the character. He decided to form a hardcore band based on Sargent D, so he recruited Anthrax drummer Charlie Benante, ex-Anthrax bassist Dan Lilker, and Psychos bassist Billy Milano on vocals.

They recorded a 63-song demo called &quot;Crab Society North&quot; and set to work on an album for Johnny Zazula&#x27;s Megaforce Records. The album, titled &quot;Speak English or Die&quot;, was recorded and mixed over three days, and has since been hailed as a landmark album that was among the first to fuse hardcore punk with thrash metal. They toured in support of the album in 1985, opening for Motörhead and The Plasmatics, among others. Their music served as the theme of the 1980s incarnation of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. They planned a follow-up titled &quot;USA For S.O.D.,&quot; which was ultimately scrapped and never recorded.

After their tour ended, Lilker carried on with the band Nuclear Assault while Benante and Ian continued with Anthrax. Milano formed the spin-off band Method of Destruction, known as M.O.D. The band&#x27;s first album &quot;U.S.A. for M.O.D.&quot;, featured many lyrics written by Scott Ian, as well as an altered version of &quot;Aren&#x27;t You Hungry&quot;, an unrecorded S.O.D. song played during their 1985 tour.

===Reunions and &quot;Bigger Than the Devil&quot; (1992–2002)===
S.O.D. reformed for a one-off gig in New York City in 1992, which was recorded and released as the live album &quot;Live at Budokan.&quot; The record featured most songs from the &quot;Speak English or Die&quot; album, a few songs from the demo and covers of Ministry, Nirvana and Fear. In 1996, S.O.D. reunited to play opposite Biohazard at Irving Plaza, in New York City, for a benefit for Dana Cavalera, to solve his murder. In 1997, S.O.D. reunited again to play the Milwaukee Metal Fest. They played their first European gig at the With Full Force festival in Germany, and in 1999 they released their second studio album, titled &quot;Bigger Than the Devil&quot;. Its hardcore metal and black humor was welcomed by fans and the band toured again in the late 1990s. &quot;Bigger Than the Devil&quot; featured the original S.O.D. version of &quot;Aren&#x27;t You Hungry&quot;.

In 2001, the DVD/video &quot;Speak English or Live&quot; was released. It added to the original &quot;Live at Budokan&quot; video by including a gig from a German metal festival and footage of the band recording overdubs for live tracks recorded in Japan. These would be included on the platinum reissue of &quot;Speak English or Die&quot;, along with two new studio tracks, to celebrate one million copies of &quot;Speak English or Die&quot; sold. In 2002, the concert film &quot;Kill Yourself: The Movie&quot; was released on DVD. The footage in it from the “Ronnie Dobbs Entitilitus Foundation Benefit” was recorded at the Maritime Hall in San Francisco on Friday, November 12, 1999.

===Second breakup and subsequent activities (2003–present)===
Heavy metal news outlets reported in 2003 that the band had split up due to disagreements between Ian and Milano. In 2007, however, S.O.D. reconvened and released its third album, &quot;Rise of the Infidels.&quot; The album consists of previously unrecorded material and live recordings. However, Milano said that the album would be the band&#x27;s final release.

In October 2011, Scott Ian was asked by UnRatd Magazine if there was any chance of another reunion, to which he replied: 

In December 2012, it was announced that Billy Milano and Dan Lilker had reunited in a new band called United Forces.

In July 2015, Horns Up Rocks reported that S.O.D. would reunite again in celebration of their 30th anniversary. However, bassist Dan Lilker said that there were no plans for an S.O.D. reunion, and added that Billy Milano did not &quot;consult anybody else that played in S.O.D. He just kind of announced something.&quot;

In 2017, Lilker formed a new version of S.O.D. under the name Not S.O.D. – Fist Banging Maniacs, with Brazilian musicians João Gordo, Cléber Orsioli and Guilherme Cersosimo filling in for Milano, Ian and Benante respectively.

In April 2020, Benante posted video of himself along with Ian and Lilker on YouTube performing S.O.D. songs during the COVID-19 lockdown.

In May 2020, Benante, Ian and Lilker, along with Mike Patton on vocals, posted a video on YouTube of &quot;Speak Spanish or Die&quot;.

In February 2025, it was announced that a Stormtroopers of Death tribute would headline the Milwaukee Metal Fest in May of 2025, with Scott Ian on guitar, Dan Lilker on bass, and Scott Ian&#x27;s son Revel Ian on drums and Hatebreed&#x27;s Jamey Jasta on vocals.

==Legacy==
Speak English or Die is widely regarded as one of the first and most influential Crossover Thrash albums, and the band are regarded as pioneers of the genre, along with D.R.I., Corrosion of Conformity, and Suicidal Tendencies. The band&#x27;s influence extends beyond Crossover; Al Jourgensen, frontman of industrial metal band Ministry, was inspired by &quot;Speak English or Die&quot; to add Thrash Metal to his band&#x27;s music starting with 1989&#x27;s &quot;The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot;. He adds that &quot;Speak English or Die&quot; is &quot;one of the best records ever.&quot; The group would later cover &quot;United Forces&quot; for their 2012 album &quot;Relapse&quot;.

Additionally, Scott Ian once recalled that Eddie Vedder was so impacted by the album that he, &quot;cornered me one night at a party for 25 minutes telling me this story about the first time he heard &quot;Speak English Or Die&quot; and how it affected his life.&quot;

Furthermore, songs on &quot;Speak English or Die&quot; - such as &quot;Milk,&quot; - have been observed as containing some of the first blast beats. Drummer Charlie Benante has commented on this, saying, &quot;The thing was something that had been around the NY hardcore scene for ages but hadn&#x27;t been used for other things. The first time it really happened was on S.O. D&#x27;s &#x27;Milk&#x27; song, so I guess you could say I had a lot to do with it. Now a lot of bands are using it and doing it really well.&quot;

<doc id="434760" wikidata="Q917276" url="?curid=434760" title="Darién Gap">
<text>The Darién Gap (, , , ) is a geographic region that connects the American continents, stretching across southern Panama&#x27;s Darién Province and the northern portion of Colombia&#x27;s Chocó Department. Consisting of a large drainage basin, dense rainforest, and mountains, it is known for its remoteness, difficult terrain, and extreme environment, with a reputation as one of the most inhospitable regions in the world. Nevertheless, as the only land bridge between North and South America, the Darién Gap has historically served as a major route for both humans and wildlife.

The geography of the Darién Gap is highly diverse. The Colombian side is dominated primarily by the river delta of the Atrato River, which creates a flat marshland at least wide. The Tanela River, which flows toward Atrato, was Hispanicized to Darién by 16th Century European conquistadors. The Serranía del Baudó mountain range extends along Colombia&#x27;s Pacific coast and into Panama. The Panamanian side, in stark contrast, is a mountainous rainforest, with terrain reaching from in the valley floors to at the tallest peak, &quot;Cerro Tacarcuna,&quot; in the Serranía del Darién. The Darién Gap is inhabited mostly by the indigenous Embera-Wounaan and Guna peoples; in 1995, it had a reported population of 8,000 among five tribes. The only sizable settlement in the region is La Palma, the capital of Darién Province, with roughly 4,200 residents; other population centers include Yaviza and El Real, both on the Panamanian side.

Owing to its isolation and harsh geography, the Darién Gap is largely undeveloped, with most economic activity consisting of small-scale farming, cattle ranching, and lumber. Criminal enterprises such as human and drug trafficking are widespread. There is no road, not even a primitive one, across the Darién. The &quot;Gap&quot; interrupts the Pan-American Highway, which breaks at Yaviza, Panama, and resumes at Turbo, Colombia, roughly away. Infrastructure development has long been constrained by logistical challenges, financial costs, and environmental concerns; attempts failed in the 1970s and 1990s. As of 2024, there is no active plan to build a road through the Gap, although there is discussion of reestablishing a ferry service and building a rail link.

Consequently, travel within and across Darién Gap is often conducted with small boats or traditional watercraft such as &quot;pirogues&quot;. Otherwise, hiking is the only remaining option, and it is strenuous and dangerous. Aside from natural threats such as deadly wildlife, tropical diseases, and frequent heavy rains and flash floods, law enforcement and medical support are nonexistent, resulting in rampant violent crime, and causing otherwise minor injuries to ultimately become fatal.

Despite its perilous conditions, since the 2010s, the Darién Gap has become one of the heaviest migration routes in the world, with hundreds of thousands of migrants, primarily Haitians and Venezuelans, traversing north to the Mexico–United States border. In 2022, there were 250,000 crossings, compared to only 24,000 in 2019. In 2023, more than 520,000 passed through the gap, more than doubling the previous year&#x27;s number of crossings.

==Pan-American Highway==
The Pan-American Highway is a system of roads measuring about in length that runs north–south through the entirety of North, Central and South America, with the sole exception of a stretch of marshland and mountains between Panama and Colombia known as the Darién Gap. On the South American side, the Highway terminates at Turbo, Colombia, near . On the Panamanian side, the road terminus, for many years in Chepo, Panama Province, is since 2010 in the town of Yaviza at .

Many people, including local indigenous populations, groups and governments are opposed to completing the Darién portion of the highway. Reasons for opposition include protecting the rainforest, containing the spread of tropical diseases, protecting the livelihood of indigenous peoples in the area, preventing drug trafficking and its associated violence, and preventing foot-and-mouth disease from entering North America. The extension of the highway as far as Yaviza resulted in severe deforestation alongside the highway route within a decade.

Efforts were made for decades to fill this sole gap in the Pan-American Highway. Planning began in 1971 with the help of American funding, but was halted in 1974 after concerns were raised by environmentalists. US support was further blocked by the US Department of Agriculture in 1978, from its desire to stop the spread of foot-and-mouth disease. Another effort to build the road began in 1992, but, by 1994 a United Nations agency reported that the road, and the subsequent development, would cause extensive environmental damage. Cited reasons include evidence that the Darién Gap has prevented the spread of diseased cattle into Central and North America, which have not seen foot-and-mouth disease since 1954, and, since at least the 1970s, this has been a substantial factor in preventing a road link through the Darién Gap. The Embera-Wounaan and Guna are among five tribes, comprising 8,000 people, who have expressed concern that the road would bring about the potential erosion of their cultures by destroying their food sources.

An alternative to the Darién Gap highway would be a river ferry service between Turbo or Necoclí, Colombia and one of several sites along Panama&#x27;s Caribbean coast. Ferry services such as Crucero Express and Ferry Xpress operated to link the gap, but closed because the service was not profitable. , nothing has come of this idea.

Another idea is to use a combination of bridges and tunnels to avoid the environmentally sensitive regions.

== History ==

=== Pre-Columbian history ===

Scholars such as Max Uhle, William Henry Holmes, C. V. Hartman and George Grant MacCurdy undertook studies of archaeological sites and collections that were augmented by further research by Samuel Kirkland Lothrop, John Alden Mason, Doris Zemurray Stone, William Duncan Strong, Gordon Willey and others. There are a large number of sites with impressive platform mounds, plazas, paved roads, stone sculpture and artifacts made from jade, gold and ceramic materials.

The Guna people lived in what is now Northern Colombia and the Darién Province of Panama at the time of the Spanish conquest, and they subsequently began to move westward due to a conflict with the Spanish and other indigenous groups. Centuries before the conquest, the Gunas arrived in South America as part of a Chibchan migration that moved east from Central America. At the time of the Spanish invasion, they were living in the region of Uraba, near the borders of what are now Antioquia and Caldas. The Guna themselves attribute their several migrations to conflicts with other chiefdoms, and their migration to nearby islands in particular to escape malarial mosquito populations on the mainland.

=== European settlement ===
Vasco Núñez de Balboa and Alonso de Ojeda explored the coast of Colombia in 1500 and 1501. They spent the most time in the Gulf of Urabá, where they made contact with the Gunas. The regional border was initially created in 1508 after royal decree to separate the colonial governorships of Castilla de Oro and Nueva Andalucía, using the River Atrato as the boundary between the two governorships.

Balboa heard of the &quot;South Sea&quot; from locals while sailing along the Caribbean coast. On 25 September 1513, he saw the Pacific.

In 1519, the town of Panamá was founded near a small indigenous settlement on the Pacific coast. After the Spaniards entered what is now Peru, it developed into an important transshipment port as well as an administrative center.

In 1671, the Welsh pirate Henry Morgan crossed the Isthmus of Panama from the Caribbean side and destroyed the city; the town was subsequently relocated a few kilometers to the west on a small peninsula. The ruins of the old town, Panamá Viejo, are preserved and were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.

Silver and gold from the viceroyalty of Peru was taken across the isthmus by Spanish Silver Train to Porto Bello, where Spanish treasure fleets shipped them to Seville and Cádiz from 1707. Lionel Wafer spent four years between 1680 and 1684 among the Gunas.

In 1698, the Kingdom of Scotland tried to establish a settlement in a project known as the Darién scheme, intending to tame, occupy and administer the non-traversable land of the Darién Gap, and use it as a gateway to trade between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as was later achieved successfully by the Panama Railroad and then the Panama Canal. The first expedition of five ships (&quot;Saint Andrew&quot;, &quot;Caledonia&quot;, &quot;Unicorn&quot;, &quot;Dolphin&quot; and &quot;Endeavour&quot;) set sail from Leith on 14 July 1698, with around 1,200 people on board. Their orders were &quot;to proceed to the Bay of Darién, and make the Isle called the Golden Island ... some few leagues to the leeward of the mouth of the great River of Darién ... and there make a settlement on the mainland&quot;. After calling at Madeira and the West Indies, the fleet made landfall off the coast of Darién on 2 November. The settlers christened their new home &quot;New Caledonia&quot;.

The aim was for the colony to have an overland route that connected the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Since its inception, it has been said that the undertaking was beset by poor planning and provisioning, divided leadership, a poor choice of trade goods, devastating epidemics of disease, reported attempts by the East India Company to frustrate it, and a failure to anticipate the Spanish Empire&#x27;s military response. It was finally abandoned in March 1700 after a siege and harbor blockade by Spanish forces.

As the Company of Scotland was backed by approximately 20% of all the money circulating in Scotland, its failure left the Scottish Lowlands in substantial financial ruin; in fact, English financial incentives are thought to have been a factor in persuading those in power to support the 1707 union with England. According to this argument, the Scottish establishment of landed aristocracy and mercantile elites considered that their best chance of being part of a major power would be to share the benefits of England&#x27;s international trade and the growth of the English overseas possessions, so its future would have to lie in unity with England. Furthermore, Scotland&#x27;s nobles were almost bankrupted by the Darién fiasco.

==Panamanian independence==

Most of Panama was part of Colombia until it declared its independence in 1903, with encouragement and support from the United States. The geography of Darién, through which no troops could pass, made its Departamento of Panamá harder to defend and control.

The current border is regulated by the , signed in Bogotá on 20 August 1924 by the Foreign Ministers of Panama, , and Colombia, Jorge Vélez. This treaty is officially registered in the Register No. 814 of the Treaty League of Nations, on 17 August 1925; said border was based on the same Colombian law of 9 June 1855.

===Natural resources===

Two major national parks exist in the Darién Gap: Darién National Park in Panama and Los Katíos National Park in Colombia. The Darién Gap forests had extensive &quot;cedrela&quot; and mahogany cover until many of these trees were removed by loggers.

Darién National Park in Panama, the largest national park in Central America, covers roughly of land, and was established in 1980. The property includes a stretch of the Pacific Coast and almost the entire border with neighbouring Colombia.

===Copa Airlines Flight 201===

On 6 June 1992, Copa Airlines Flight 201, a Boeing 737 jet airplane covering a flight between Panama City and Cali, Colombia, crashed in the Darién Gap, killing all 47 people on board.

==Adventure travelers==
To travel between the continents through the Darién Gap has long been a challenge for adventure travelers.

The Gap can be transited by off-road vehicles attempting intercontinental journeys. The first post-colonial expedition to the Darién was the Marsh Darién Expedition in 1924–25, supported by several major sponsors, including the Smithsonian Institution, the American Museum of Natural History and the government of Panama.

The first vehicular crossing of the Gap was made by three Brazilians in two Ford Model T cars. They left Rio de Janeiro in 1928 and arrived in the United States in 1938. The expedition intended to bring attention for the Panamerican highway, after an International Conference in Chile, in 1923. The participants were Leonidas Borges de Oliveira, a lieutenant from Brazilian army, Francisco Lopez da Cruz from Brazilian air force, and Mário Fava, a young mechanic. They took what appears to be the last photo of Augusto Sandino, who received them in Nicaragua, and were received by Henry Ford and Franklin Roosevelt in the United States.

Another crossing was completed by the Land Rover &quot;La Cucaracha Cariñosa&quot; (The Affectionate Cockroach) and a Jeep of the Trans-Darién Expedition of 1959–60. They left Chepo, Panama, on 2 February 1960 and reached Quibdó, Colombia, on 17 June 1960, averaging per hour over 136 days.
In December 1960, on a motorcycle trip from Alaska to Argentina, adventurer Danny Liska attempted to transit the Darién Gap from Panama to Colombia. In Panama City, Liska decided to fly his motorcycle ahead to Medellin, and proceed across the Gap by boat and on foot. He was later forced to abandon it in Punta Arenas when he was not able to clear it at a customs office, and was once again afoot

In 1961, a team of three 1961 Chevrolet Corvairs and several support vehicles departed from Panama. After 109 days, they reached the Colombia Border with two Corvairs, the third having been abandoned in the jungle.

A pair of Range Rovers was used on the British Trans-Americas Expedition in 1972, with substantial support from the British Army, led by John Blashford-Snell, which is claimed to be the first vehicle-based expedition to traverse both American continents north to south through the Darién Gap. The Expedition crossed the Atrato Swamp in Colombia with the cars on special inflatable rafts that were carried in the backs of the vehicles.

The first fully overland wheeled crossing (others used boats for some sections) of the Gap was that of British cyclist Ian Hibell, who rode from Cape Horn to Alaska between 1971 and 1973. Hibell took the &quot;direct&quot; overland south-to-north route, including an overland crossing of the Atrato Swamp in Colombia.

Ed Culberson was the first one to follow the entire Pan-American highway proposed route, including the Darién Gap, on a motorcycle, a BMW R80G/S.

In the 1990s, the gap was briefly joined by a ferry service provided by Crucero Express, until it ceased operations in 1997.

A number of notable crossings have been made on foot. Sebastian Snow crossed the Gap with Wade Davis in 1975 as part of his unbroken walk from Tierra del Fuego to Costa Rica. The trip is documented in his 1976 book &quot;The Rucksack Man&quot; and in Wade Davis&#x27;s 1996 book &quot;One River&quot;. In 1981, George Meegan crossed the gap on a similar journey. He too started in Tierra del Fuego and eventually ended in Alaska. His 1988 biography, &quot;The Longest Walk&quot;, describes the trip and includes a 25-page chapter on his foray through the Gap.
In 1979, evangelist Arthur Blessitt traversed the gap while carrying a wooden cross, a trek confirmed by Guinness World Records as part of &quot;the longest round-the-world pilgrimage&quot; for Christ.

Most crossings of the Darién Gap region have been from Panama to Colombia. In July 1961, three college students, Carl Adler, James Wirth, and Joseph Bellina, crossed from the Bay of San Miguel to Puerto Obaldia on the Gulf of Parita (near Colombia) and ultimately to Mulatupu in the San Blas Islands. The trip across the Darién was by banana boat, piragua and foot via the Tuira river (La Palma and El Real de Santa Maria), Río Chucunaque (Yaviza), Rio Tuquesa (Chaua&#x27;s (General Choco Chief) Trading Post—Choco Indian village) and Serranía del Darién.

In 1985, Project Raleigh, which evolved from Project Drake in 1984 and in 1989 became Raleigh International, sponsored an expedition which also crossed the Darién coast to coast.

Between the early 1980s and mid-1990s, Encounter Overland, a British adventure travel company, organized two- to three-week trekking trips through the Darién Gap from Panama to Colombia or vice versa. These trips used a combination of whatever transport was available: jeeps, bus, boats, and walking, with travelers carrying their own supplies.

Complete overland crossings of the Darién rainforest on foot and riverboat (i.e., from the last road in Panama to the first road in Colombia) became more dangerous in the 1990s because of the Colombian conflict. The Colombian portion of the Darién rainforest in the Katios Park region eventually fell under control of armed groups. Furthermore, combatants from Colombia even entered Panama, occupied some Panamanian jungle villages and kidnapped or killed inhabitants and travelers.

==Migrants traveling northward==

While the Darién Gap has been considered to be essentially impassable, in the 21st century thousands of migrants, primarily Haitian during the 2010s and Venezuelan during the 2020s, crossed the Darién Gap to reach the United States. By 2021, the number was more than 130,000, increasing to 520,000 in 2023, but dropping to 300,000 in 2024, for the now more organized 2½ day trek, which used to take a week. Of the 334,000 migrants who crossed over the first eight months of 2023, 60% were Venezuelan, motivating the Biden administration to provide foreign assistance to help Panama deport migrants.

The hike, which involves crossing rivers which flood frequently, is unpleasant, demanding, and dangerous, with rape and robbery common, and there are numerous fatalities. In 2024 there were 55 known deaths, probably more, and 180 unaccompanied minors were abandoned and looked after by child care institutions, some because their relatives died or got lost, others travelling unaccompanied.

By 2013, the coastal route on the east side of the Darién Isthmus became relatively safe, by taking a motorboat across the Gulf of Uraba from Turbo to Capurganá and then hopping the coast to Sapzurro and hiking from there to La Miel, Panama. All inland routes through the Darién remain highly dangerous. In June 2017, CBS journalist Adam Yamaguchi filmed smugglers leading refugees on a nine-day journey from Colombia to Panama through the Darién.

People from Africa, South Asia, the Middle East, the Caribbean, and China have been known to cross the Darién Gap as a method of migrating to the United States. This route may entail flying to Ecuador to take advantage of its liberal visa policy, and attempting to cross the gap on foot. Journalist Jason Motlagh was interviewed by Sacha Pfeiffer on NPR&#x27;s nationally syndicated radio show &quot;On Point&quot; in 2016 concerning his work following migrants through the Darién Gap. Journalists Nadja Drost and Bruno Federico were interviewed by Nick Schifrin about their work following migrants through the Darién Gap in mid-2019, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic a year later, as part of a series on migration to the United States for &quot;PBS NewsHour&quot;.

In 2023, people fleeing China travelled to Ecuador, then to Necoclí in Colombia, with the intention of crossing the Darién Gap on foot. The number of Chinese people crossing the Darién Gap increased with each passing month in 2023.

In August 2024, journalist Caitlin Dickerson reported on immigration through the Darién Gap for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.

==The route in the 21st century==
Several video teams have traveled with migrants and thus the conditions of the route have become better known. It is possible, although arduous, dangerous, and extremely rainy, to hike from Colombia to Panama.

===By boat===
At various times scheduled boats, including sailboats, have sailed between the Colombian ports of Cartagena, Turbo, Necoclî and Capurganá and the Panamanian ports of El Porvenir and Colón. Chartering a small boat is also an option. Sea conditions make it a sometimes hazardous trip, and schedules can change frequently. Any of these options are more expensive than flying.

===By land===
It is possible to cross the Gap on foot, but the conditions are very difficult and often underestimated. The hazards are both those of traversing a difficult and dangerous jungle without tracks—the Darién Gap is one of the rainiest and most physically dangerous places on the planet—and, more recently, those of a lawless, unpoliced region with many criminals including drug smugglers, and sometimes political rebels. Records are not kept, but it is known that many migrants die on this trip.

The hiking trail ascends abruptly over a mountain; the four-day hike is a challenge even for a person in good physical shape. Most migrants are in mediocre physical shape or worse, and without equipment for hiking and camping. Women who are carrying babies or pregnant make the attempt. Three migrant women bore babies in the Darién between 2013 and 2021, with no medical help or supplies available.

The rainfall in the Darién Gap produces flash floods that can carry sleepers to their deaths. Several rivers with neither bridges nor boats must be crossed. No services of any kind are available; food, a tent and water purification materials sufficient for a hike of several days must be carried. Bodies of migrants are often found, but the numbers found are said to be grossly under-reported by authorities in Panama. There is no medical help and no way to evacuate someone ill, injured, or simply exhausted. A broken leg is usually fatal. There are many insects, snakes, and carnivorous animals. Many migrants are robbed or raped. There is no police presence and no cellphone service.
In Capurganá, Colombia, and Yaviza, Panama, many young men offer, for a fee, to serve as guides and to provide &quot;protection&quot;. There is no easy way to determine if those who offer these services are knowledgeable and trustworthy, or criminals looking for victims.

==Armed conflict==

The Darién Gap was subject to the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which led an insurgency against the Colombian government. FARC rebels were present on both the Colombian and Panamanian sides of the border.

Other non-political victims include three New Tribes missionaries, who died after disappearing from the Panamanian side in 1993.

In 2003, Robert Young Pelton, on assignment for &quot;National Geographic Adventure&quot; magazine, and two traveling companions, Mark Wedeven and Megan Smaker, were detained for a week by the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, a far-right paramilitary organization, in a highly publicized incident.

In May 2013, Swedish backpacker Jan Philip Braunisch disappeared in the area after leaving the Colombian town of Riosucio to attempt crossing on foot to Panama via the Cuenca Cacarica. The FARC admitted to killing him, having mistaken him for a foreign spy.

<doc id="434761" wikidata="Q198193" url="?curid=434761" title="Zhuge Jin">
<text>Zhuge Jin (174 – July or August 241), courtesy name Ziyu, was a Chinese military general and politician of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period of China. Born in the late Eastern Han dynasty, Zhuge Jin started his career in the 200s as an official under the warlord Sun Quan, who later became the founding emperor of Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms period. In 215, he served as Sun Quan&#x27;s representative in a territorial dispute over southern Jing Province between Sun Quan and his ally, Liu Bei. In 219, he joined Sun Quan&#x27;s general Lü Meng in an invasion of Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in Jing Province after Sun Quan broke the Sun–Liu alliance. He was subsequently appointed as a general and commandery administrator. Before the Battle of Xiaoting of 221–222, Zhuge Jin attempted to dissuade Liu Bei from going to war with Sun Quan but was unsuccessful. The battle ultimately concluded with victory for Sun Quan&#x27;s side; both sides made peace later and reestablished an alliance between the Eastern Wu and Shu Han states against their rival state, Cao Wei. From 222 until his death in 241, despite being rather incompetent in military affairs, Zhuge Jin served as one of Eastern Wu&#x27;s top generals and participated in some battles against Cao Wei forces.

Although Zhuge Jin was not as brilliant in statecraft and military strategy as his more famous brother Zhuge Liang, he was known throughout his life for his virtuous character. He had a reputation for conducting himself with grace and decorum, and for being thoughtful, magnanimous and tactful. In return, he gained Sun Quan&#x27;s trust, and Sun Quan never questioned his loyalty towards him. Zhuge Jin was also known for helping to mediate conflicts between Sun Quan and his subjects, including Zhu Zhi and Yu Fan.

==Family background==
Zhuge Jin&#x27;s ancestral home (and probably birthplace too) was in Yangdu County (), Langya Commandery (), which is located in present-day Yinan County or Yishui County, Shandong. There are two other accounts of his ancestral origins in the &quot;Wu Shu&quot; () and &quot;Fengsu Tong&quot; ().

The &quot;Wu Shu&quot; recorded that his ancestral family name was actually &quot;Ge&quot; () and his ancestors were originally from Zhu County (諸縣; southwest of present-day Zhucheng, Shandong) before they settled in Yangdu County. As there was already another &quot;Ge&quot; family in Yangdu County before they came, the locals referred to the newcomers as the &quot;Zhuge&quot; – combining &quot;Zhu (County)&quot; and &quot;Ge&quot; – to distinguish them from the other &quot;Ge&quot; family. Over time, Zhuge Liang&#x27;s ancestors adopted &quot;Zhuge&quot; as their family name.

The &quot;Fengsu Tong&quot; recorded that his ancestor was Ge Ying (), a general who served under Chen Sheng, the rebel king who led the Dazexiang uprising against the Qin dynasty. Chen Sheng later executed Ge Ying. During the early Western Han dynasty, Emperor Wen considered that Ge Ying was unjustly put to death, so he enfeoffed Ge Ying&#x27;s grandson as the Marquis of Zhu County to honour Ge Ying. Over time, Ge Ying&#x27;s descendants adopted &quot;Zhuge&quot; as their family name by combining &quot;Zhu (County)&quot; and &quot;Ge&quot;.

The earliest known ancestor of Zhuge Jin who bore the family name &quot;Zhuge&quot; was Zhuge Feng (), a Western Han dynasty official who served as Colonel-Director of Retainers () under Emperor Yuan ( 48–33 BCE). Zhuge Jin&#x27;s father, Zhuge Gui (), whose courtesy name was Jungong (), served as an assistant official in Taishan Commandery (泰山郡; around present-day Tai&#x27;an, Shandong) in the late Eastern Han dynasty under Emperor Ling ( 168–189 CE).

Zhuge Jin had two younger brothers and two sisters. His brothers were Zhuge Liang and Zhuge Jun (). One of their two sisters married Kuai Qi () while the other married Pang Shanmin (), a cousin of Pang Tong.

==Early life==
In his youth, Zhuge Jin visited Luoyang, the imperial capital, where he studied classical texts such as the &quot;Mao Commentary on the Classic of Poetry&quot;, &quot;Book of Documents&quot;, and &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;. When his mother died, he went home and dutifully performed filial mourning. He also treated his stepmother in a courteous and respectful manner, which earned him fame for his filial piety.

When chaos broke out throughout China towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, Zhuge Jin fled from home and headed south to the Jiangdong region for shelter. He travelled around the region with Bu Zhi and Yan Jun, and they earned themselves fine reputations as learned men. At the time ( 200s), Sun Quan had recently succeeded his deceased elder brother, Sun Ce, as the warlord ruling over the territories in Jiangdong. Hong Zi, a brother-in-law of Sun Quan (who married an elder half-sister of Quan&#x27;s) noticed and recognised Zhuge Jin&#x27;s talent so he recommended Zhuge Jin to serve under Sun Quan. Sun Quan treated Zhuge Jin, Lu Su and other talents who came to join him like honoured guests. Zhuge Jin then started his career under Sun Quan as a Chief Clerk (). Later, he was reassigned to the position of a Central Major ().

==Sun–Liu territorial dispute==
Sometime between June and August 215, Sun Quan sent Zhuge Jin as his representative to visit his ally, Liu Bei, who had recently seized control of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing). Zhuge Jin&#x27;s task was to ask Liu Bei to &quot;return&quot; the territories in southern Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) to Sun Quan, according to an earlier agreement that Liu Bei would only use Jing Province as a temporary base and would return them to Sun Quan once he found another base. However, Liu Bei refused and said he would return the territories after he seized Liang Province.

Sun Quan ignored Liu Bei and sent his officials to assume office in the three commanderies of Changsha (), Lingling () and Guiyang () in southern Jing Province. However, Guan Yu, Liu Bei&#x27;s general in charge of defending those territories, drove Sun Quan&#x27;s officials away. An enraged Sun Quan then ordered his general Lü Meng to lead 20,000 troops to seize the three commanderies by force. After a standoff between both sides and tense negotiations, Liu Bei agreed to divide southern Jing Province between his and Sun Quan&#x27;s domains along the Xiang River: Liu Bei would keep Nan, Lingling and Wuling commanderies in the west, while Sun Quan would take Changsha, Jiangxia and Guiyang commanderies in the east.

The territorial dispute was resolved by mid August to early September 215. Sun Quan then sent Zhuge Jin as his representative to visit Liu Bei again. During this trip, Zhuge Jin met his second brother Zhuge Liang, who was serving as an adviser to Liu Bei. They refrained from meeting each other in private to dispel any suspicions that either of them was secretly collaborating with his brother against his lord.

==Role in the Wu–Shu conflict==
===Wu invasion of Jing Province===
In 219, Sun Quan broke the Sun–Liu alliance and ordered his general Lü Meng to lead troops to seize Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in southern Jing Province, which were guarded by Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu, who was away at the Battle of Fancheng at the time. Zhuge Jin participated in the invasion, which turned out successful. Guan Yu was eventually captured and executed by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces. Lü Meng died of illness a few months after the victory. In recognition of Zhuge Jin&#x27;s contributions during the campaign, Sun Quan enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Xuancheng () and appointed him as General Who Pacifies the South () to replace Lü Meng as the Administrator () of Nan Commandery (南郡; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei), the former headquarters of Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in Jing Province. Zhuge Jin was stationed at Gong&#x27;an County, one of the key counties in Nan Commandery.

In 220, Cao Pi usurped the throne from Emperor Xian, ended the Eastern Han dynasty, and established the state of Cao Wei (or Wei) with himself as the new emperor. This event marked the end of the Eastern Han dynasty and the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in China. Sun Quan pledged nominal allegiance to Cao Pi and became a vassal of Wei. In return, Cao Pi awarded Sun Quan the title &quot;King of Wu&quot; and granted him autonomous rule over the Jiangdong (or Wu) territories. A year later, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and established the state of Shu Han (or Shu) to contest Cao Pi&#x27;s legitimacy.

===Battle of Xiaoting===
In 221, when Liu Bei started the Battle of Xiaoting against Sun Quan to retake his lost territories in southern Jing Province, Sun Quan sent Zhuge Jin as his representative to meet Liu Bei and begin peace talks. Zhuge Jin told Liu Bei: 

In his annotations to Zhuge Jin&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, the fifth-century historian Pei Songzhi rebutted Zhuge Jin&#x27;s speech to Liu Bei. From Pei Songzhi&#x27;s point of view, Liu Bei had good reason(s) to go to war with Sun Quan because Sun Quan thwarted his attempts to revive the Eastern Han dynasty when he broke the Sun–Liu alliance and seized Jing Province. Pei Songzhi also noted that Liu Bei&#x27;s relationship with Guan Yu was so close that it could not be described in words. He remarked that if Liu Bei and Guan Yu&#x27;s relationship were to be described in words in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, it would take up so much space that it becomes a waste of space.

The Battle of Xiaoting ended in late 222 with victory for Sun Quan&#x27;s forces, which were led by Sun Quan&#x27;s general Lu Xun. Liu Bei retreated to Baidicheng (in present-day Fengjie County, Chongqing) after his disastrous defeat and died of illness in early 223.

==Battles against Wei==
In late 222, Sun Quan, who was previously a vassal king under the Cao Wei state, broke ties with the Wei emperor Cao Pi and declared himself the independent ruler of his Eastern Wu state. He promoted Zhuge Jin to General of the Left (), granted him acting imperial authority, and ordered him to station at Gong&#x27;an County to oversee the Wu defences in southern Jing Province. He also enfeoffed Zhuge Jin as the Marquis of Wanling ().

===Battle of Jiangling (223)===
Between 222 and 223, the Wei generals Cao Zhen and Xiahou Shang led their troops to attack the Wu-controlled Jiangling County (江陵縣; in present-day Jingzhou, Hubei), which was defended by the Wu general Zhu Ran. At the same time, another detachment of Wei troops occupied Zhongzhou (), an island in the Yangtze River near Jiangling County. When Zhuge Jin heard about it, he led Wu forces from Gong&#x27;an County to reinforce Zhu Ran. However, he turned out to be an incompetent military commander as he showed weak leadership, adopted a slow and reactive approach, and spent too much time on discussion and planning as opposed to actively seizing opportunities to attack the enemy. Due to his incompetence, the siege dragged on, and Sun Quan became rather unhappy with him. The siege on Jiangling County was eventually lifted after the Wu general Pan Zhang came up with a plan to burn down the Wei forces&#x27; pontoon bridges and drive them back. Although Zhuge Jin did not make any significant achievements in the battle, he received credit for contributing to the Wu forces&#x27; overall success in defending Jiangling County.

===Battle of Xiangyang (226)===
Between September and early November 226, following Cao Pi&#x27;s death and Cao Rui&#x27;s accession to the Wei throne, Sun Quan personally led Wu forces to attack the Wei-controlled Jiangxia Commandery, which was defended by the Wei general Wen Ping. At the same time, he ordered Zhuge Jin and Zhang Ba () to lead a separate Wu army to attack the Wei-controlled city of Xiangyang. However, Zhuge Jin lost the battle against Wei forces led by Sima Yi. Zhang Ba was killed in battle and the Wu army lost over 1,000 men. In the meantime, Sun Quan mistakenly believed that Wei reinforcements had arrived at Jiangxia Commandery, so he pulled back his troops and returned to Wu.

===Battle of Xiangyang (234)===
Between mid June and early September 234, Sun Quan personally led a 100,000 strong Wu army to attack the Wei fortress of Xincheng at Hefei. At the same time, he ordered Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin to lead another 10,000 troops to attack Xiangyang, and Sun Shao and Zhang Cheng to lead their troops to attack Huaiyin County () in Guangling Commandery (around present-day Huai&#x27;an, Jiangsu). The Wei general Man Chong, who oversaw Xincheng&#x27;s defences, successfully repelled the Wu invaders and killed Sun Quan&#x27;s nephew Sun Tai in battle. Sun Quan eventually ordered a retreat when a plague broke out in his army and after he heard that the Wei emperor Cao Rui was personally leading reinforcements to Hefei. Sun Shao and Zhang Cheng also pulled back from Guangling Commandery after learning of Sun Quan&#x27;s retreat from Hefei.

In the meantime, Lu Xun ordered a close aide, Han Bian (), to deliver a report to Sun Quan. On the journey back, Han Bian was captured by a Wei patrol. When Zhuge Jin learnt of Han Bian&#x27;s capture, he became fearful so he wrote to Lu Xun and urged him to make a hasty retreat from Xiangyang. Lu Xun did not respond, and he instructed his men to plant turnips and peas while he played weiqi and other games with his officers as though nothing had happened. Zhuge Jin believed that Lu Xun knew what he was doing so he did not panic. He came to see Lu Xun, who told him: &quot;The enemy knows that His Majesty (Sun Quan) has withdrawn his forces, so they have no worries and will concentrate their attacks on us. Besides, they have already stationed troops at critical positions and are poised to strike. Hence, we should remain composed and calm our men, after which we will have a change of plans and prepare to withdraw. If we display signs of retreat now, the enemy will think that we are afraid and will definitely attack us, resulting in defeat for us.&quot;

Lu Xun then secretly conveyed his plan to Zhuge Jin and ordered him to supervise the fleet of vessels on which they would sail back to Wu, while he gathered his troops and headed towards Xiangyang. The Wei forces had been wary of Lu Xun all this while so they immediately retreated back into the city when they saw Lu Xun&#x27;s army approaching. Lu Xun organised his men in an orderly manner and instructed them to pretend to prepare for an attack on Xiangyang. By then, Zhuge Jin and the fleet had shown up, so Lu Xun and his forces progressively retreated to the vessels and left. The Wei forces in Xiangyang did not dare to make any move.

==Later life and death==
In 229, after Sun Quan declared himself emperor of Eastern Wu, he appointed Zhuge Jin as General-in-Chief (), Left Protector-General (), and as the nominal Governor () of Yu Province.

After the Lü Yi scandal ended in 238, Sun Quan sent a personal representative to meet all his senior generals and apologise to them, as well as to seek their views on how he could reform the bureaucracy to prevent corrupt officials like Lü Yi from abusing their powers again. However, to his disappointment, Zhuge Jin and other generals such as Bu Zhi, Zhu Ran and Lü Dai gave the excuse that they were not in charge of civil affairs and said that civil affairs were best left to civil officials such as Lu Xun and Pan Jun. Sun Quan then wrote an emotional letter to them, blaming himself for the mistakes and urging them to give him honest advice and point out his mistakes. After receiving the letter, Zhuge Jin was so moved that he wrote a clear, detailed and well-reasoned response to the Lü Yi scandal and Sun Quan&#x27;s queries.

Zhuge Jin died in July or August 241 at the age of 68 (by East Asian age reckoning). Before his death, he expressed a desire to be dressed in plain clothes and to have a simple funeral.

==Relationship with Sun Quan==
Throughout his life, Zhuge Jin was known for conducting himself with grace and decorum, and for being thoughtful and magnanimous. These traits earned him much admiration and respect from his contemporaries. Sun Quan also regarded him highly and often consulted him on important issues.

Zhuge Jin was known for being tactful whenever he spoke to Sun Quan, be it giving advice or small talk. He spoke in a toned-down and indirect manner, gave only a brief outline of what he wanted to say, and stopped immediately once he sensed that Sun Quan got his point. When he realised that Sun Quan&#x27;s views were at odds with his, he would subtly change the topic of the conversation and use other topics as analogies to persuade Sun Quan to see things from his point of view. He was successful as Sun Quan understood his views better and became more receptive of them.

After the Battle of Xiaoting of 221–222, someone secretly reported to Sun Quan that Zhuge Jin had sent a close aide to speak with Liu Bei. Sun Quan did not suspect Zhuge Jin&#x27;s loyalty towards him and instead remarked, &quot;I have made an oath with Ziyu. As long as Ziyu doesn&#x27;t let me down, I won&#x27;t let him down.&quot;

The &quot;Jiang Biao Zhuan&quot; () recorded that when Zhuge Jin was serving as the Administrator of Nan Commandery, someone secretly reported to Sun Quan that Zhuge Jin had covert dealings with Liu Bei. When Lu Xun heard of such rumours, he wrote a memorial to Sun Quan to speak up for Zhuge Jin and reassure his lord that Zhuge Jin was loyal towards him. Sun Quan wrote a reply to Lu Xun as follows: 

==Mediating conflicts between Sun Quan and his subjects==
Apart from being one of Sun Quan&#x27;s most trusted subjects, Zhuge Jin was also known for helping to mediate conflicts between his lord and his subjects on a number of occasions as follows.

===Zhu Zhi===
Zhu Zhi was the official who recommended Sun Quan as a &quot;xiaolian&quot; (civil service candidate) to serve in the government when Sun Quan was still in his youth. After Sun Quan became the warlord ruling over the Jiangdong territories, Zhu Zhi served under Sun Quan and was held in high regard. Later, for some reason, Sun Quan became unhappy with Zhu Zhi but he could not bring himself to scold the latter, out of respect for him. Zhuge Jin noticed Sun Quan&#x27;s frustration and figured out why. However, he kept quiet and decided to use an indirect method to help Sun Quan resolve the problem. He set up a hypothetical scenario similar to the conundrum Sun Quan faced, asked Sun Quan questions and guided his thoughts, and wrote them down as Sun Quan spoke. Once they were done, he presented his writing to Sun Quan, who was so pleased after reading it that he remarked: &quot;You have helped me resolve my frustration. Yan Hui spoke of promoting harmony among people as a virtue. Isn&#x27;t this an example of that?&quot;

===Yin Mo===
On one occasion, Sun Quan got angry at Yin Mo (), a colonel serving under him, and accused him of committing an offence so severe that Sun Quan&#x27;s other subjects were shocked. When his subjects pleaded with him to spare Yin Mo, Sun Quan became even more furious and he started quarrelling with them. Only Zhuge Jin remained silent. Sun Quan noticed it and asked him: &quot;Ziyu, why are you the only person who hasn&#x27;t spoken?&quot; Zhuge Jin then left his seat, stood up and said: Sun Quan felt deeply saddened after hearing Zhuge Jin&#x27;s words. He then said: &quot;I&#x27;ll let him off because of you.&quot;

===Yu Fan===
When Yu Fan, one of Sun Quan&#x27;s advisers, was banished to the remote Jiao Province for his disrespectful and offensive behaviour, Zhuge Jin not only repeatedly tried to persuade Sun Quan to pardon Yu Fan, but was also the only one among Sun Quan&#x27;s subjects who spoke up for Yu Fan.

Later, Yu Fan wrote a letter to a relative as follows: 

===Zhou Yin===
Sometime between 229 and 239, Zhou Yin (), a son of Zhou Yu, committed an offence and was exiled to Luling Commandery (廬陵郡; around present-day Ji&#x27;an, Jiangxi) as punishment. In 239, Zhuge Jin and Bu Zhi wrote a memorial to Sun Quan, requesting for Zhou Yin to be pardoned and restored of his titles on account of his father&#x27;s contributions. Sun Quan was reluctant to do so, as he noted the severity of Zhou Yin&#x27;s offence and said that Zhou Yin had not shown any sign of remorse. However, after much urging from Zhuge Jin, Bu Zhi, Zhu Ran and Quan Cong, Sun Quan eventually agreed, but Zhou Yin had already died of illness in exile by then.

==Family and descendants==
During Zhuge Jin&#x27;s lifetime, his family was one of the most illustrious families in China. While he was serving as General-in-Chief in Wu, his second brother Zhuge Liang served as the Imperial Chancellor of Wu&#x27;s ally state, Shu, and their cousin Zhuge Dan served as a general in Wu and Shu&#x27;s rival state, Wei. Two of Zhuge Jin&#x27;s sons, Zhuge Ke and Zhuge Rong, also served as generals in Wu.

Although Zhuge Jin was not as talented and brilliant as his better known brother Zhuge Liang, he was noted for his exemplary conduct and virtuous character. After his wife died, he did not promote his favourite concubine to the status of his formal spouse to replace his deceased wife. He also did not show any favouritism towards his son(s) born to his concubine.

Zhuge Jin&#x27;s eldest son, Zhuge Ke, was not only famous in Wu, but also highly regarded by Sun Quan. However, Zhuge Jin disapproved of Zhuge Ke&#x27;s behaviour, treated him coldly, and constantly worried that his eldest son would bring doom to their family. After Zhuge Jin died, his third son Zhuge Rong inherited his peerage as the Marquis of Wanling (); Zhuge Ke did not inherit his father&#x27;s peerage because he had already received a peerage of his own. Zhuge Rong also took control of the troops previously under his father&#x27;s command at Gong&#x27;an County.

In 253, Zhuge Ke, who briefly served as a regent for Sun Quan&#x27;s successor Sun Liang, was overthrown and assassinated in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; by Sun Jun, a distant relative of Sun Liang. Zhuge Ke&#x27;s two surviving sons, along with Zhuge Rong and Zhuge Rong&#x27;s three sons, as well as other members of Zhuge Ke&#x27;s extended family, were rounded up and executed.

Zhuge Jin&#x27;s second son, Zhuge Qiao, was adopted by his uncle Zhuge Liang because Zhuge Liang initially had no son and needed a male heir. Zhuge Qiao came to serve in Shu and died in 228. His son, Zhuge Pan (), also served as an official in Shu. However, after Zhuge Jin&#x27;s descendants were purged in 253, Zhuge Pan reverted to his original lineage and moved to Wu to continue Zhuge Jin&#x27;s bloodline there. However, Zhuge Pan was noted to have died young as well. In 264, Zhuge Pan&#x27;s son Zhuge Xian (), who somehow ended up in Wei, was moved to Hedong Commandery along with Zhuge Zhan&#x27;s second son Zhuge Jing (). Jin-era calligrapher Wang Xizhi wrote that he once met Zhuge Xian at Jiankang, and asked him about the situation in Shu. Zhuge replied that Chengdu&#x27;s city walls, houses and many other buildings were from the Qin era, where they were built by Sima Cuo.

Zhang Cheng, a general serving under Sun Quan, was a friend of Zhuge Jin. When his wife died, his father Zhang Zhao suggested that he marry Zhuge Jin&#x27;s daughter. Zhang Cheng initially felt awkward about becoming his friend&#x27;s son-in-law, but eventually agreed after Sun Quan persuaded him to do so. Zhang Cheng and Zhuge Jin&#x27;s daughter had a daughter, Consort Zhang (), who married Sun Quan&#x27;s third son Sun He.

<doc id="434770" wikidata="Q309733" url="?curid=434770" title="Vincenzo Scamozzi">
<text>Vincenzo Scamozzi (2 September 1548 – 7 August 1616) was an Italian architect and a writer on architecture, active mainly in Vicenza and Republic of Venice area in the second half of the 16th century. He was perhaps the most important figure there between Andrea Palladio, whose unfinished projects he inherited at Palladio&#x27;s death in 1580, and Baldassarre Longhena, Scamozzi&#x27;s only pupil.

The great public project of Palladio&#x27;s that Scamozzi inherited early in the process of construction was the Teatro Olimpico at Vicenza, which Palladio had designed in the last months of his life.

==Biography==
Scamozzi was born in Vicenza. His father was the surveyor and building contractor Gian Domenico Scamozzi; he was Scamozzi&#x27;s first teacher, imbuing him with the principles of Sebastiano Serlio, laid out in Serlio&#x27;s book. Vincenzo visited Rome in 1579–1580, and then moved to Venice in 1581. In 1599 to 1600, he visited the German Empire and France and left a sketchbook record of his impressions of French architecture, which first saw the light of day in 1959. Scamozzi is famous for having inherited several unfinished projects from Andrea Palladio at the time of Palladio&#x27;s death in 1580 and for bringing them to their completed form.

== &quot;The Idea of a Universal Architecture&quot; ==
Scamozzi&#x27;s influence spread far beyond his Italian commissions through his two-volume treatise, &quot;L&#x27;idea dell&#x27;architettura universale&quot; (&quot;The Idea of a Universal Architecture&quot;), which is one of the last works of the Renaissance dealing with the theory of architecture. It was originally published with woodcut illustrations at Venice in 1615. Scamozzi depended for sections of his treatment of Vitruvius on Daniele Barbaro&#x27;s commentary, published in 1556 with illustrations by Palladio; he also discussed issues of building practice. At that time, such treatises were becoming a vehicle for self-promotion. Scamozzi was aware of the potential value of publicity distributed through the established channels of the book trade and he included many of his own plans and elevations, as built, as they should have been built, and as idealized projects.

His first book entitled &quot;Discorsi sopra l&#x27;antichita di Roma&quot; (Venice: Ziletti, 1583) had been quickly cobbled together with some illustrated commentary on the ruins of Rome, assembled in &quot;the space of a few of days.&quot; According to his preface to the volumes, the images were stock productions that already existed. Over half were copied from a volume published by Hieronymus Cock in Antwerp in 1551.

His major book came out one year before his death and was too late to influence his own success. Scamozzi&#x27;s practice is sometimes spoken of as being a source of the neo-Palladian architecture as it was introduced by Inigo Jones, another follower of Andrea Palladio&#x27;s own example. Rudolf Wittkower referred to him as among &quot;the intellectual father(s) of neo-classicism&quot;.

==Piazza San Marco==
Scamozzi moved to Venice in 1581, where he had been invited to design the &quot;Procuratie Nuove&quot; on the Piazza San Marco itself. The &quot;Procuratie Nuove&quot; was built as a row of official housing for the Procuratorate of San Marco, presented as a unified palace front that continues the end facade of the Sansovino Library, with its arcaded ground floor and arch-headed windows of the first floor, but adding an upper floor to provide the necessary accommodation. In accomplishing this design, Scamozzi adapted a rejected project of Palladio&#x27;s for a re-faced Doge&#x27;s Palace, with colonnettes that flank the windows to support alternating triangular and arched pediments, upon which Scamozzi added reclining figures, to balance the richness of the Sansovinian decoration of the two lower floors. Eleven bays of this project were completed, and later were extended by Baldassare Longhena (Scamozzi&#x27;s only pupil) to fill the whole south flank of the piazza.

<text>Le Portel (; ) is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region of France about southwest of Boulogne town centre.

==History==
Le Portel translates as &quot;the little port.&quot; The original Le Portel was a hamlet east of the town of Outreau. It became an independent municipality on 13 June 1856 by an imperial decree of Napoleon III. &lt;br&gt;
In the 19th century, flint tools were discovered in the centre of the village, by the river near the Hamel Bridge, evidence of the long occupation of the site. A Gallo-Roman cemetery has been excavated in the hamlet of Châtillon.

Of agricultural origin, it grew rapidly during the 19th century because of fishing, along with the nearby port of Boulogne-sur-Mer. Sailors of Portel were as numerous as those of Boulogne before World War I. In 1841, two Le Portel sailors were on the ship &quot;Belle Poule&quot;, that brought back the remains of Napoleon.

During the Second World War, on 8 and 9 September 1943, Le Portel suffered as part of Operation Cockade, a diversionary manoeuvre by the Allies to fool the Germans into believing the possibility of a landing on the English Channel. The bombings, which destroyed 93% of the village, also killed 376 civilians. On 12 August 1944, Charles de Gaulle was at Le Portel for its liberation. The town received the Croix de guerre with silver star for its sacrifice.

==Population==
==Notable people==
* Alfred Desenclos, composer, was born there.
* Lucien Leduc, football player, was born there.

==Twin towns==
* Portel-des-Corbières, France
* Stockelsdorf, Germany
* Kawara, Burkina Faso

==Sport==
The ESSM Le Portel is a French basketball club, based in Le Portel.

<text>Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise (, literally &quot;Saint-Pol on Ternoise&quot;; ; Picard: &quot;Saint-Po-su-Térnoèse&quot;) is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in northern France. It is the seat of the canton of Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise.

==Geography==
Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise lies in the middle of the Pas-de-Calais department, on the river Ternoise. It lies 26 km southwest of Béthune, and 32 km west of Arras, the prefecture of Pas-de-Calais. Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise station is served by regional trains towards Lille, Arras, Béthune and Étaples.

==History==
The county of Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise, usually referred to as just Saint-Pol, was originally a stronghold of the Counts of Flanders and was established as a county in the late 9th century. When the county passed out of the family of the Flemish counts, it remained subject to the Count of Flanders as his vassals until 1180. It became subject to France, then Artois (1237–1329), then France again until it ceased to exist as a county and was annexed to France in 1702.

Saint-Pol was first controlled by the Flemish counts, then by the family known as Campdavaine from early in the 11th century. In 1205 the county passed to the seigneurs of Châtillon through marriage, and remained with this dynasty until 1360 when it passed to the Luxembourg dynasty. Around 1487 the county passed to the Capetian-Bourbon-Vendôme dynasty through marriage, then to the Longueville-Neuchâtel dynasty from around 1563. In 1702 it came under direct rule of France.

In the Middle Ages, several of the Counts of Saint-Pol were active in the Crusades.

On 7 November 1920, the remains of four unidentifiable, fallen British soldiers disinterred from the battlefields at Aisne, Arras, the Somme and Ypres were brought to the town&#x27;s chapel. There, Brigadier-General Louis John Wyatt of the North Staffordshire Regiment, aided by Lieutenant-Colonel EAS Gell, selected one to be carried to Westminster Abbey to be re-buried in the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior. The remaining three bodies were removed and reburied in the military cemetery at Wyatt&#x27;s headquarters at St Pol.

==Population==
==Notable people==

<text>A permissive society, also referred to as permissive culture, is used to describe a society in which social norms become increasingly liberal, especially with regard to sexual freedom and profanity. The term is often used pejoratively by cultural conservatives to criticise what is seen as a breakdown in traditional values, such as greater acceptance of premarital sex, an increase in divorce rates, and acceptance of non-traditional relationships such as cohabitation and homosexuality. A. P. Herbert, an English humorist, novelist, playwright, law reformist, and Member of Parliament, has been described as the &quot;Father of the Permissive Society,&quot; particularly for his championing of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1937, which extended the grounds for divorce. It was particularly used during the Sexual Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s in Western culture by opponents of the changes in attitudes of the era.

<text>Yury Bandazhevsky ( / Juryj Bandažeŭski, / Yuri Ivanovich Bandazhevski; born January 9, 1957, in Belarus), former director of the Medical Institute in Gomel (Belarus), is a scientist working on consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. He was the founding Rector of Gomel State Medical Institute in Belarus in 1991, specially dedicated to scientific work on the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Since 2013, Professor Bandazhevsky has been leading Chernobyl Ecology and Health in Ukraine, supported by European Commission. In the aftermath of Chernobyl accident and also 2020 April wildfire near Chernobyl, Bandazhevsky has been calling for international help.

== Background ==
In 1978, Bandazhevsky married Galina Bandazhevskaja, a medical doctor specialized in pediatrics. He studied at the Medical Institute of Grodno and became a specialist of anatomic pathology. He supported his doctoral thesis in 1987, and at the age of 31, he became the youngest professor in the USSR, a year after the Chernobyl disaster. He then named as the director of the Central Laboratory of Scientific Research. In 1990, he became the founding Rector (President) of the Gomel State Medical Institute. After 9 years of research including human body autopsy and animal experiments with cesium included feed, Professor Bandazhevsky made an official conclusion about the actual radiation effects on human body, especially concentrating on cesium accumulated in heart, kidney, liver, thyroid as well as genetic effects on fetus. In 1999, he was arrested on suspicion of terrorism, later convicted for allegedly receiving a bribe, and was released in 2005 and went to France. He became the 25th person to receive a Freedom Passport, approved by the European Parliament, and an honorary citizen of 17 French cities, including Paris. Since 2013, he has been leading an international research center &quot;Ecology and Health (https://chernobyl-health.org/)&quot;, established in Kyiv, conducting research on radiation effects on people especially on children in contaminated areas of Ukraine.

== Imprisonment and Research Afterwards ==
In June 2001, Yury Bandazhevsky was sentenced to eight years imprisonment on the grounds that he had received bribes from students&#x27; parents. The institute&#x27;s Deputy Director, Vladimir Ravkov, also received an eight-year prison sentence. Bandazhevsky&#x27;s lawyer claimed that he had been convicted on the basis of two testimonies made under duress, without any material evidence. According to many human rights groups Dr. Bandazhevsky was a prisoner of conscience. Amnesty International has stated on their website, &quot;His conviction was widely believed to be related to his scientific research into the Chernobyl catastrophe and his open criticism of the official response to the Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster on people living in the region of Gomel.&quot; His arrest came soon after he published reports critical of the official research being conducted into the Chernobyl incident, and was issued by presidential decree &quot;N21 On Urgent Measures for the Combat of Terrorism&quot;.

Yury Bandazhevsky was released on parole from prison on August 5, 2005, and prohibited for five months from leaving Belarus. He was afterward invited by the mayor of Clermont-Ferrand, in France, to work at the university and at the hospital on Chernobyl&#x27;s consequences. Clermont-Ferrand has been since 1977 linked to Gomel where Bandazhevsky used to work. In France, he is notably supported by the &quot;Commission de recherche et d&#x27;information indépendantes sur la radioactivité&quot; (CRIIRAD).

Since 2013, Bandazhevsky has been leading the research and health protection project, &quot;Chernobyl: Ecology and Health&quot; near Chernobyl in Ivankiv District in Ukraine, supported by European Commission.

==Scientific works==
Caesium-137 levels in children&#x27;s organs were examined at autopsy. The highest accumulation of 
Cs-137 was found in the endocrine glands, in particular the thyroid, pancreas and adrenal glands. According to his paper, &quot;Radiocesium and the Heart&quot;, high concentration of more than hundreds of Bq/kg were also found in other vital organs, including the heart, intestines, pancreas, kidney, brain, liver, etc. Professor Bandazhevsky&#x27;s papers since 2013 have been compiled at Chernobyl Ecology and Health.

<doc id="434790" wikidata="Q1413939" url="?curid=434790" title="List of Soviet and Russian submarine classes">
<text>Submarines of the Soviet Navy were developed by numbered &quot;projects&quot;, which were sometimes but not always given names. During the
Cold War, NATO nations referred to these classes by NATO reporting names, based on intelligence data, which did not always correspond with the projects. See:

* List of NATO reporting names for ballistic missile submarines
* List of NATO reporting names for guided missile submarines
* List of NATO reporting names for hunter-killer and experimental submarines

The NATO reporting names were based on the British (and later American) habit of naming submarines with a letter of the alphabet indicating the class, followed by a serial number of that class. The names are the radiotelephonic alphabet call sign of a letter of the alphabet. For security purposes, the &quot;pennant numbers&quot; of Soviet submarines were not sequential, any more than those of Soviet surface vessels were.

Most Russian (and Soviet) submarines had no &quot;personal&quot; name, but were only known by a number, prefixed by letters identifying the boat&#x27;s type at a higher level than her class. Those letters included:
* К (K): крейсерская (&quot;kreyserskaya&quot;, &quot;cruiser&quot;)
* ТК (TK): тяжёлая крейсерская (&quot;tyazholaya kreyserskaya&quot;, &quot;heavy cruiser&quot;)
* Б (B): большая (&quot;bolshaya&quot;, &quot;large&quot;)
* С (S): средняя (&quot;srednyaya&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;)
* М (M): малая (&quot;malaya&quot;, &quot;small&quot;)

Any of those prefixes could have С (S) added to the end, standing for специальная (&quot;spetsialnaya&quot;) and meaning &quot;designed for special missions&quot;:

* New weapon, engines and armament testing
* Submarines for long-range radio communications
* Target submarines for anti-submarine training
* Rescue service submarines
* Covert operations

<doc id="434802" wikidata="Q1207449" url="?curid=434802" title="Deûle">
<text>The Deûle (; ) is a river of northern France which is channeled for the main part of its course (from Lens to Lille). The upstream part is still partly free-flowing and is known as the Souchez. The Deûle flows into the Lys (right bank) in Deûlémont.

The Souchez is formed from the union, in the village of Souchez, of two smaller brooks, called the Carency and the Saint-Nazaire.

The channeled part comprises two branches:

*the high gauge canal known as Canal de la Deûle which ensures the connection between the channeled Lys and the Scarpe (a tributary of the Scheldt) in Douai, 
*the Canal de Lens, fed by the Souchez, which connects Lens with the Canal de la Deûle at Courrières. 
Immediately downstream of Lens, the channel is unusually elevated compared to the neighboring banks, as a result of mining depressions.

The Deûle flows through the departments of Pas-de-Calais and Nord, and the towns of Lens, Wingles, Loos, Lille, Wambrechies and Quesnoy-sur-Deûle, before it flows into the Lys at Deûlémont.

The Deûle does not yet profit from a Schéma d&#x27;aménagement et de gestion des eaux.

In the United States, the show is broadcast under the title &quot;MI-5&quot;. In Canada, the programme originally aired as &quot;MI-5&quot;, but later aired on BBC Canada as &quot;Spooks&quot;.

The series continued with a film, &quot;&quot;, which was released on 8 May 2015.

==Series synopses==


The show consists of 86 episodes, beginning in May 2002 and ending in October 2011. Most episodes end with the final scene freezing and changing to a black-and-white negative image that then compresses with a distinctive sound effect into a flat white line against a black screen.

===Series 1===

Starring Matthew Macfadyen, Keeley Hawes, David Oyelowo, Jenny Agutter, and Peter Firth, the initial series of six one-hour episodes premiered 13 May 2002. 

Due to its combination of stylistic photography with fast-paced storylines, the series was a critical and popular success, averaging 7.5 million viewers over its six episodes.

The second episode gained notoriety for the violent killing of character Helen Flynn (Lisa Faulkner), which drew the largest number of complaints to the Broadcasting Standards Commission in 2002. During an undercover operation Helen and Tom were captured by race riot instigator Robert Osborne, played by Kevin McNally, who tortured Helen with a deep fryer in an attempt to make Tom reveal classified information. He refused and she was killed. This provoked an angry reaction from many viewers who jammed BBC phone switchboards with complaints, despite the show airing after the 9 pm watershed.

===Series 2===

With the success of the first series, a second, longer series of ten episodes was commissioned and subsequently aired in 2003. New regular characters Sam Buxton (Shauna Macdonald) and Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker), were introduced in the first and second episodes respectively, while the series finale ended with a dramatic cliffhanger. The series averaged 7.1 million viewers.

===Series 3===

A third series of ten episodes was transmitted on BBC One in the autumn of 2004 and concluded on 13 December. The first episode features Rupert Penry-Jones as Adam Carter, who was drafted in from MI6 to help investigate Tom&#x27;s disappearance. He later takes over Tom&#x27;s position as Section Chief after the latter jeopardised an important operation.

In episode six, Zoe is taken to court for misconduct during an operation and is forced to leave MI5 and assume a new identity in Chile. She is replaced by Adam&#x27;s wife, Fiona (Olga Sosnovska). In the series finale, Danny is killed while he and Fiona are being held hostage. Audience figures dropped to a series average of 5.8 million viewers.

===Series 4===

The fourth series of &quot;Spooks&quot; began airing on Monday 12 September 2005 on BBC One at 9 pm with the first instalment of a two-part story. The next day the second episode was shown. The following week &quot;Spooks&quot; began airing in the Thursday 9 pm slot, a change from the Monday 9 pm slot that the previous three series had occupied. Once again, the series ran for ten episodes. It averaged 6.05 million viewers per episode, notably more than the previous series.

The opening two-part episode introduces two new characters to the series, Zafar Younis (Raza Jaffrey, whose character had first appeared in the final episode of series three), and Juliet Shaw (Anna Chancellor). The storyline involves a terrorist bombing in central London, something that, in reality, took place on 7 July, two months before the episode was due to air, but after it had already been filmed.

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, the day the first episode aired, &quot;The similarities were sufficient to cause head of drama, Jane Tranter and new BBC One controller Peter Fincham to agonise over whether to drop the episodes.&quot; The episodes were eventually aired unedited, although before both instalments of the two-parter the BBC One continuity announcer warned viewers that they featured scenes of terrorist bombing in London which some viewers might find disturbing.

In episode seven, the character Fiona Carter gets killed off because the actress portraying her, Olga Sosnovska, was pregnant during filming and chose to leave the programme. In that story arc, Fiona attempts to kill her deranged ex-husband, who she thought had been hanged several years earlier. However, her ex-husband ultimately abducts her and later shoots her dead in Adam&#x27;s presence during her attempted escape. Fiona Carter is replaced at MI5 by Jo Portman (played by Miranda Raison), a character who had been recruited by Adam Carter in a previous episode.

===Series 5===

The fifth (ten-part) series of &quot;Spooks&quot; aired its first episode in two parts, the first appearing on 17 September 2006. In it, elements within the British Government, MI6 and the British media conspire in an attempt to overthrow the Parliament and the Prime Minister. These elements agree that for Britain to survive the threats posed by modern-day terrorism, democracy had to be replaced with rule by committee. The second part followed the next day, marking &quot;Spooks&#x27;s&quot; return to BBC One&#x27;s Monday night schedule. These episodes introduced Ros Myers (Hermione Norris).

This series&#x27;s storylines include a fake home-grown Al-Qaeda cell that plans an attack on London; the British government selling nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia; and the US administration selling arms to African dictators.

The ratings for this series remained consistent with those of the previous series, averaging six million viewers.

===Series 6===

The sixth series was commissioned by Jane Tranter, Head of Drama Commissioning at the BBC, by the time series 5 was announced. The series returned on 16 October 2007 at 9 pm on BBC One, and concluded on 18 December. The series averaged 5.68 million viewers (the lowest to date)
The sixth series was different in certain respects from the previous five because it had a dominant storyline running through the entire season and the show contained end credits for the first time. There was also a less frequent use of the soundtrack composed by Jennie Muskett.

The primary storyline of Series 6 follows Iran seeking the ability to manufacture its own nuclear weapons and searching for sellers of nuclear armaments components. The governments of several nations (principally the United States and its CIA, Russia&#x27;s FSB, and a shadowy third organisation composed of disenfranchised members of other agencies, including MI5) are woven throughout the plot. Simon Abkarian plays the Iranian Special Consul liaising with the various governments. Agni Scott as his wife, Matthew Marsh as the CIA station chief, and Robert Glenister as the British Home Secretary, all have recurring roles throughout the series.

A new website called &quot;Spooks Interactive&quot; was created to coincide with the launch of the series. In April 2008, the &quot;Spooks&quot; production team won the BAFTA Award for Interactivity for their work on Spooks Interactive.

===Series 7===

Series seven of &quot;Spooks&quot; began airing on 27 October 2008 for an eight-episode run. Peter Firth returns as Harry Pearce, along with Alex Lanipekun as Ben Kaplan, Hugh Simon as Malcolm Wynn-Jones, Miranda Raison as Jo Portman and Gemma Jones as Connie James.

In the first episode, central character Adam Carter (portrayed by Rupert Penry-Jones) dies in a car explosion set by terrorists, and the character Ros Myers (played by Hermione Norris) returns to the show as a deep-cover agent in Moscow. Richard Armitage joins the cast as Lucas North, an agent who has been held in a Russian prison for the past eight years and released as part of a spy exchange. Following Adam&#x27;s death, Ros is made the section leader and Lucas assumes Ros&#x27;s previous position as senior case officer.

The series eight recommission press release announced that there would be a twist in the final episode of series 7. In that episode, a nuclear bomb is set to explode, triggered by a Russian sleeper agent who is part of Operation Tiresias. As Parliament and the Royal Family are evacuated, the nuclear threat to London is eliminated when Ros and Lucas are able to turn Connie James and elude an FSB kill squad. While defusing the bomb, Connie is killed by its conventional explosives. Seconds before the bomb explodes, Connie reveals it had not been Harry who sold Lucas North out to the Russians as Lucas had always believed but, rather, herself. The episode concludes with Harry, conscious but with his mouth taped shut, in the boot of a car being zipped up in a body bag by Viktor Sarkisian, head of the FSB&#x27;s London station.

===Series 8===

In December 2008, the BBC announced that series 8 would start filming in March 2009 and air in late 2009, and that both Hermione Norris (Ros) and Richard Armitage (Lucas) would be returning. Series 8 started on Wednesday 4 November 2009, at 9 pm on BBC One, with episode 2 broadcast on Friday 6 November at 9 pm on BBC Three. The opening episode of series 8 drew 6 million viewers, a 25% share of audience numbers between 9 pm and 10 pm.

The first episode of the series picks up the story from where it left off in a cliffhanger at the end of series 7, with Harry Pearce being held captive by the Russians. During this episode, Ruth Evershed is reintroduced, having spent her time since series 5 in Cyprus. The only character other than Harry who has been in the programme since its inception, Malcolm Wynn-Jones, departs, stating simply that he is &quot;too old&quot;. His replacement comes in the form of much a younger technician, Tariq Masood (Shazad Latif).

The series again revolves around one major plot arc, focused on a mysterious organisation known only as &quot;Nightingale&quot;. Over the course of the series, Lucas North&#x27;s loyalty is continually called into question, for the most part because of his ongoing relationship with CIA agent Sarah Caulfield, who is connected to Nightingale.

Jo Portman also briefly returns, but is killed by Ros in a dramatic act of martyrdom after being captured by a terrorist. Ros is haunted by the memory of this event for the remainder of this series.

At the end of the series, Section D does not appear to have made much progress in tackling Nightingale, and Ros Myers is killed in an explosion, along with the new Home Secretary, Andrew Lawrence.

===Series 9===

&quot;Spooks&quot; returned for a ninth series on Monday 20 September 2010 for an eight-episode run.

New cast members in this series include Sophia Myles and Max Brown as MI5 officers and Simon Russell Beale as the Home Secretary. Iain Glen and Laila Rouass also joined the series, playing Vaughn Edwards and Maya Lahan – figures from Lucas&#x27;s mysterious past.

The series ends with the death of Lucas&#x27;s lover Maya Lahan, following the death of Lucas&#x27;s blackmailer, Vaughn, at the climactic end of the penultimate episode. Lucas had kidnapped Ruth, binding and gagging her, and was attempting to get a top-secret computer file for the Chinese. The climactic scene is a showdown between Harry and Lucas on top of a tower block in London. After Harry reveals that the file never actually worked, and that Lucas had apparently betrayed his MI5 colleagues and stolen another man&#x27;s identity, &quot;Lucas&quot; (whose &quot;real&quot; name is apparently John Bateman) orders Harry to turn around. Harry anticipates execution, but no shots come. Hearing a car alarm and screams from the ground many seconds later, Harry turns around to find Lucas no longer on the roof. Forty-eight hours later, the Home Secretary calls Harry to inform him that a full investigation will be made into his actions at MI5 and to &quot;prepare for life after MI5&quot;. The series ends with Harry looking out over the London skyline at night. A caption reveals that a 10th series is planned for 2011.

===Series 10===
Production on the six-episode series reportedly began during March 2011, with Lara Pulver joining the series as an &quot;ambitious, hungry&quot; new spook &quot;determined to make her mark&quot;. Also joining the series were Geoffrey Streatfeild, Alice Krige and Jonathan Hyde, while Peter Firth, Nicola Walker, Max Brown, Shazad Latif and Simon Russell Beale reprised their roles, as did Matthew Macfadyen in a cameo appearance in the final episode. Sophia Myles did not return as Beth Bailey.

This series concludes with the revelation of a plot to force Britain and Russia into war. Harry manages to thwart the plot and decides to leave the service to live a normal life with Ruth Evershed. But when a vengeful Sasha Gavrik attempts to take revenge on him, Ruth takes the blow for Harry and dies in his arms. Harry then decides to return to MI5, since the prospect of a normal life, whatever that would mean without Ruth, no longer appeals to him.

Kudos and the BBC announced in a joint statement in August 2011 that Series 10 would be the last series. It began airing on BBC One on Sunday 18 September 2011 at 9:00 pm, moving from its former weekday evening slot, with the final episode airing on 23 October 2011.

=== &quot;Spooks: The Greater Good&quot; ===
A feature-length film, &quot;Spooks: The Greater Good&quot;, known in the US as &quot;MI-5&quot;, was released in May 2015. Peter Firth reprises his role as Harry Pearce. Also returning from the TV series are Tim McInnerny as Oliver Mace, Lara Pulver as Erin Watts, Hugh Simon as Malcolm Wynn-Jones, and Geoffrey Streatfeild as Calum Reed. Kit Harington and Jennifer Ehle star as new characters in leading roles.

==Production==

The programme was created by writer David Wolstencroft, and produced by Kudos for the BBC. A trademark style, coupled with the series&#x27; popularity, attracted a large number of high-profile guest stars. These included Martine McCutcheon, Hugh Laurie, Haluk Bilginer, Robert Hardy, Tim McInnerny, Bruce Payne, Reece Dinsdale, Ian McDiarmid, Ewen Bremner, Jimi Mistry, Andy Serkis, Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin McNally, Rupert Graves, Andrew Tiernan, Anton Lesser, Anupam Kher, Alexander Siddig, and Anthony Head.

===Locations===
The availability and iconic status of certain London landmarks made them popular locations throughout production. Exterior shots of Thames House, the headquarters of MI5 were used in many episodes to establish the location. However, due to the security risks involved with filming such a location, London&#x27;s Freemasons&#x27; Hall was used for scenes where actors were entering or leaving the building, and for some internal locations. This same location was later used as Thames House in &quot;&quot;. Establishing shots of the SIS Building were also used for scenes involving members of the Secret Intelligence Service or MI6. Other landmarks commonly used included the London Underground, and the Millennium Bridge. Many scenes are filmed in and around the Docklands, especially Canary Wharf, Rotherhithe, London Bridge and Greenwich (including The Old Royal Naval College), as well as the More London development. Some of the army barracks were filmed at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, Northwood.

==Broadcast and release==
The series was filmed on Super 16, rather than the more commonly used digital alternatives. Episodes were originally aired with no credits on BBC One, a choice made to maintain an atmosphere of the anonymity of real-life spies and the drama of each episode. Prior to series nine, each subsequent episode was aired on BBC Three one week ahead of its BBC One showing (the first and last episode were shown only on BBC One). BBC Three airings included a brief credit sequence following the trailer and before the Kudos and BBC logos. The entire 86 episodes were made available free-to-view on the BBC iPlayer in April 2020.

===International broadcast===
The series is a popular export, syndicated to more than 26 countries. However, it has struggled for popularity in some, notably the United States: two of the three channels to have broadcast &quot;Spooks&quot; in the US pulled the show during the fourth series due to low viewing figures. Because of the potentially racist connotations of the term &quot;Spooks&quot; in some countries, international broadcasts are often renamed.

===Home media===

All series of Spooks (most episodes cut down to 50 minutes) are available on iTunes, with series 7, 8, 9 and 10 becoming available to download one week after original broadcast. Series 1–8 have been released on DVD by Contender Home Entertainment with its successor Entertainment One then taking over; series 9 was released by Universal Playback.

==Awards and nominations==
==Music==

The music for series one to four and theme tune was composed by Jennie Muskett. Music for series five to ten was composed by Paul Leonard-Morgan. Four soundtracks have been released for the show, the first includes music from series one and two, the second (currently and perhaps only ever available on iTunes) featuring music from series five and six (Two additional tracks are available on the composer&#x27;s website). The third and fourth soundtracks (containing tracks from series seven &amp; eight, and nine &amp; ten respectively) were released on iTunes in November 2011. The track listings contain spoilers to the episode content.

Broadcast editions of the episodes have been known to feature alternate music to that found on the commercially available DVD releases. In the final episode of Series two, music from the film score &quot;Spy Game&quot; was used—composed by Harry Gregson-Williams. The tracks used are &quot;Beirut, a War Zone&quot; and &quot;Operation Dinner Out&quot;. Both are available on the official soundtrack release for the film.

==Wider universe==

===&quot;Spooks: Code 9&quot;===

Following the success of &quot;Torchwood&quot; (the BBC Three &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off series) the controller of BBC Three, Julian Bellamy, announced in December 2006 a &quot;Spooks&quot; spin-off entitled &quot;Spooks: Code 9&quot; (working titles: &quot;Rogue Spooks&quot; and &quot;Spooks: Liberty&quot;). The show started filming in Bradford in 2008 and the first and second episodes were broadcast on 10 August 2008. It was not well received by critics, who said &quot;the script is poor and the acting little better&quot; (&quot;The Sunday Times&quot;) and the production &quot;utterly uninspired and stale&quot; (&quot;Digital Spy&quot;), &quot;daft and unconvincing&quot; (&quot;The Telegraph&quot;), &quot;an utterly cynical venture&quot; that &quot;given its patronising awfulness ... actually damages the Spooks brand&quot; (&quot;The Guardian&quot;).

===Video games===
Video games based on the show were created by Preloaded for promotional purposes. In 2005, the video game &quot;The Grid&quot; (a promotion for &quot;Spooks&quot; series 3) was nominated for a Webby Award under the category of Best Game.

On 19 February 2004, BBC Worldwide announced that a video game based on the show would be released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Microsoft Windows for a fall 2004 release, developed by their in-house video game development studio Gamezlab. and would have run on a new game engine. It was not released, after BBC Worldwide closed Gamezlab and exited the video game publishing market.

<text>Eloquence (from French &quot;eloquence&quot; from Latin &quot;eloquentia&quot;) is fluent, elegant, persuasive, and forceful speech, persuading an audience. Eloquence is both a natural talent and improved by knowledge of language, study of a specific subject to be addressed, philosophy, rationale and ability to form a persuasive set of tenets within a presentation.

&quot;True eloquence,&quot; Oliver Goldsmith says, &quot;Does not consist ... in saying great things in a sublime style, but in a simple style; for there is, properly speaking, no such thing as a sublime style, the sublimity lies only in the things; and when they are not so, the language may be turgid, affected, metaphorical, but not affecting.&quot;

==Eloquence in antiquity==
The word eloquence itself derives from the Latin roots: &quot;ē&quot; (a shortened form of the preposition &quot;ex&quot;), meaning &quot;out (of)&quot;, and &quot;loqui&quot;, a deponent verb meaning &quot;to speak&quot;. Thus, eloquence is to speak fluently and understand and master language so as to employ a graceful style with persuasiveness, or gracefulness in interpretation and communication. 

The concept of eloquence could date back to the rhetoric of the ancient Greeks, Calliope (one of the nine daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne) being the Muse of epic poetry and eloquence. Hermes, the Greek God, was a patron of eloquence. Cicero, a rhetorician and prolific author, was well-regarded in Ancient Rome as an orator of excellent eloquence.

==Renaissance eloquence==
The Renaissance humanists focused on the correlation of speech and political principles as a powerful tool to present and persuade others to particular concepts. At the core of presentations was the use of graceful style, clear concise grammar and usage, and over time the insertion of rational and emotional arguments.

Petrarch (Fracesco Petrarca), in his study program of the classics and antiquity (Italian Renaissance) focused attention on language and communication. After mastering language, the goal was to reach a &quot;level of eloquence&quot;, to be able to present gracefully, combine thought and reason in a powerful way, so as to persuade others to a point of view. Petrarch encouraged students to imitate the ancient writers, from a language perspective, combining clear and correct speech with moral thought. 

Later, Fr. Louis Bourdaloue is regarded as one of the founders of French eloquence.

==Modern politicians and eloquence==

Many famous political leaders, like Winston Churchill and Martin Luther King Jr. and dictators such as Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini rose to prominence in large part due to their eloquence. In the Iranian Revolution, Ruhollah Khomeini came to power in part through the eloquence of his speeches, smuggled into the country on audio cassettes while he was still in exile.

<text>Sun-Times Media Group (formerly Hollinger International) was a Chicago-based newspaper holding company. The company formerly owned the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; until its acquisition by ownership group ST Acquisition Holdings in 2017.

==History==
Sun-Times Media Group was founded in 1986 under the name &quot;American Publishing Company&quot;, as a holding company for Hollinger Inc.&#x27;s American properties. It focused on newspapers, mostly in smaller markets. In February 1994, it acquired the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, holding an initial public offering (IPO) to fund the acquisition. At the time, it was the fifteenth-largest U.S. newspaper group. It changed its name to &quot;Hollinger International&quot; in 1994.

Hollinger&#x27;s non-American properties, which included &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, were added to the company in 1996, and its Canadian papers in 1997. It created the &quot;National Post&quot; from the &quot;Financial Post&quot; in 1998.

That year, it began a process of shrinking the company, selling many of its small papers to the private equity firm Leonard Green &amp; Partners, who formed Liberty Group Publishing. In 2000, it sold most of the rest to four media companies (Bradford Publications Company, Community Newspaper Holdings, Paxton Media Group, and Forum Communications). Its Canadian holdings, notably the &quot;National Post&quot;, several smaller papers, and a majority stake in the Southam newspaper chain, were sold to CanWest in 2000 in connection with Conrad Black renouncing his Canadian citizenship to gain a British peerage. That year, Hollinger International bought the Chicago-area publications of Copley Press (&quot;The Herald News&quot;, &quot;The Beacon-News&quot;, &quot;The Courier-News&quot;, and &quot;Lake County News-Sun&quot;, along with several smaller papers).

Conrad Black was fired by the Hollinger International board in 2004 for fraud. He attempted to sell his stake to the Barclay brothers in January 2004 and the brothers launched a takeover bid for the rest of Hollinger International. However the sale was blocked by a judge in the United States after the company&#x27;s board lodged a court action against the sale.

The Barclay brothers later bought The Telegraph Group which included &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, and &quot;The Spectator&quot;. On November 16, 2004, the sale of &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; to Mirkaei Tikshoret, a Tel Aviv–based publisher of Israeli newspapers, was announced. CanWest Global Communications, Canada&#x27;s biggest media concern, announced it has agreed to take a 50 percent stake in &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; after Mirkaei buys the property. In February 2006, Hollinger sold substantially all of its Canadian assets.

The corporation&#x27;s name was changed to Sun-Times Media Group on July 17, 2006.

On March 31, 2009, the company filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Code.

In September 2009, Chicago financier James C. Tyree and a team of investors had a $5 million bid accepted to purchase the Sun-Times Media Group, contingent on the paper&#x27;s unions accepting deep compensation cuts and work-rule changes. The purchase was completed the next month.

Tyree died suddenly in March 2011. Jeremy Halbreich, chief executive, said that Tyree will be greatly missed and that his death will make no changes in the media company&#x27;s strategy.

Since the Tyree-Halbreich takeover, the organization has shown accelerating declines in circulation, advertising revenue and quality of editorial content. Industry analysts have repeatedly pointed to the group&#x27;s failure to craft a competitive online product as evidence of continued decline. On December 6, 2011, the company announced it will institute a paywall to access its online content from December 8, 2011.

Later in December 2011, Chicago investment group Wrapports, L.L.C., led by Chairman Michael W. Ferro Jr. &amp; CEO Timothy Knight, bought the properties of Sun-Times Media Holdings.

On July 13, 2017, it was reported that a consortium consisting of private investors and the Chicago Federation of Labor led by businessman and former Chicago alderman Edwin Eisendrath through his company ST Acquisition Holdings, had acquired the Sun-Times Media Group from then-owner Wrapports, beating out Chicago-based publishing company Tronc (formerly Tribune Publishing Company) for ownership.

In March 2019, a new ownership group took over and took control of the Sun-Times from the previous union ownership. The group, Sun-Times Investment Holdings LLC, was backed by prominent Chicago investors Michael Sacks and Rocky Wirtz.

<doc id="434811" wikidata="Q3139370" url="?curid=434811" title="Hollinger Inc.">
<text>Hollinger Inc. was a Canadian media company based in Toronto which was established in 1985 by businessman Conrad Black. At one time, the company was the third-largest media empire in the world. In 1996, through stock purchases, it took over control of Southam Inc., at the time, Canada&#x27;s largest newspaper chain and a newswire service. It sold its Canadian newspaper holdings to Canwest Global Communications Inc., in August 2000, which included the company&#x27;s flagship national newspaper, the recently formed &quot;National Post&quot;. Hollinger, through its subsidiary [[ Sun-Times Media Group | Hollinger International]], continued to own newspapers in the United States, including the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. The company went bankrupt in 2007 and was delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange in August 2008.

== History ==
Hollinger Inc. was used by Conrad Black as a holding company for his media interests after he acquired control of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 1986. The company took its name from Hollinger Gold Mines, which started in 1909 and later became Hollinger Mines, owner of one of the world&#x27;s largest gold mines near Timmins, Ontario. It was acquired by E.P. Taylor&#x27;s conglomerate, Argus Corporation. Black took control of Argus in 1978, and he sold off its assets by 1985.

Hollinger Inc. was controlled by Canadian-based Ravelston Corporation, which was used as a personal holding company by Black. Ravelston was placed in receivership in the summer of 2005.

=== Holdings ===
Hollinger Inc. was the parent company of Chicago-based Hollinger International (now known as the Sun-Times Media Group), whose primary holdings included a group of Chicago newspapers. Its flagship paper was the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;. Hollinger also owned &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; and interests in Australian and Canadian newspaper chains. On 16 December 1996, Hollinger sold its 25 percent stake in Australian company John Fairfax Holdings to New Zealand&#x27;s Brierley Group for $600 million USD, partially to help fund the company&#x27;s recent purchase of Southam Inc.&#x27;s 32 newspapers in Canada. At the turn of the 21st century, Hollinger was the world&#x27;s third-largest media company. In 2000, Hollinger sold its Canadian newspaper, magazine and internet assets to Canwest Global for $3.5 billion. Canwest eventually went bankrupt and its newspapers and wire service were bought by Postmedia Network in July 2010, with the former Hollinger paper, &quot;National Post&quot;, as its new flagship paper.

=== Demise ===
Hollinger became a holding company for stakes in various companies, including its controlling stake in Hollinger International. However, the ownership structure of Hollinger and other related companies was described as &quot;complex&quot; and &quot;convoluted&quot; and lead to its demise.

A series of non-competition payments and management fees made between 1999 and 2003 to Black and his associates would later lead to lengthy court and regulatory proceedings. In 2003 and 2004, Black was removed as owner from Hollinger, and other corporate positions, after there were claims made that he had looted his companies for personal profit. Shareholders learned that the company was facing serious financial problems. Shortly afterward, a number of court and regulatory orders left the company with no income or operating business.

On August 2, 2007, Hollinger filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada and the United States. At the time, the company was 78% owned by Black&#x27;s company Ravelston. Hollinger continued to assert control over Sun-Media Times Group Inc. Hollinger shares were prevented from being traded by the Ontario Securities Commission on 23 July 2008, and were delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange on 22 August 2008.

<text>Thérouanne (; ; Dutch &quot;Terwaan&quot;) is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region of France west of Aire-sur-la-Lys and south of Saint-Omer, on the river Lys.

==Population==
==History==
At the time of the Gauls, &quot;Tarwanna&quot; or &quot;Tervanna&quot; was the capital of the Belgian tribe of the Morini. After the Romans conquered Gaul, they too made the city the capital of the &quot;Civitas Morinorum&quot; district.

The origin of the name has several theories. According to the historian Malbracq, it got its name from its founder &quot;Lucius Tauruannus&quot;, others say it is derived from &quot;Terra avanae&quot; The land of Oats. But this second derivation seems to be a generic used term.

In the 7th century, probably around 639, Saint Audomar (Saint Omer) established the bishopric of &quot;Terwaan&quot; or &quot;Terenburg&quot;, the diocese of Thérouanne, which during the Middle Ages controlled a large part of the left bank of the river Scheldt. Territorially it was part of the county of Artois which belonged to the county of Flanders. In 1303 the town was burnt by Flemish forces during the Franco-Flemish War.

Thanks to that ecclesiastical control of some of the most prosperous cities north of the Alps, like Arras and Ypres, the bishopric was able to build a cathedral which was at the time the largest in France.

The town was captured by the Emperor Maximilian and Henry VIII from the French in 1513 after the battle of the Spurs. In 1553 Charles V besieged Thérouanne, then a French enclave in the Holy Roman Empire, in revenge for a defeat by the French at the siege of Metz. After he captured the city he ordered it to be razed, the roads to be broken up, and the area to be ploughed and salted. Only a small commune which lay outside the city walls, then named Saint-Martin-Outre-Eaux, was left standing, and later (probably around 1800) took over the name &quot;Thérouanne&quot;. Part of the portal of the cathedral was acquired by Saint-Omer; a colossal statue of Christ is all that is left of it these days.

The disappearance of the former bishopric led to a reform of sees at the Council of Trent, and the bishopric of Thérouanne was split between those of Saint-Omer and Ypres.

Therouanne lies on the Via Francigena.

===Bishops===
* Saint Audomar, founder, 637-c.670
* Hunfrid of Prüm (d. 871)
* A certain Adam, 1213–1229 List of religious leaders in 1220
* Antipope Clement VII, 1361–1368
* John, Cardinal of Lorraine (d. 1550)

* The ruin of the Abbey of St. Jean-du-Mont contains the remnants of a gothic cathedral which has a seventh century Episcopal group and a Carolingian building, which are a registered historical monument

==Twin towns==
Thérouanne is twinned with Hamstreet in Kent (in southern England, across the English Channel).

==Notable people==
* Gérard Houllier, football manager, was born in Thérouanne.
* Hugh of Falkenberg (died c. 1106), crusader.

==In literature==
* The town appears as Taruenna in a novel about an English pilgrimage to Rome by Matthew Kneale.
* In Hilary Mantel&#x27;s novel &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; the first conversation between the central character Thomas Cromwell and Henry VIII, about the futility of war, sees Henry chide Cromwell for describing Thérouanne as a &#x27;dog hole&#x27; in a speech in parliament opposing funds for a new expedition in France.

<doc id="434816" wikidata="Q3019552" url="?curid=434816" title="The Seduction of Mimi">
<text>The Seduction of Mimi () is a 1972 Italian comedy drama film written and directed by Lina Wertmüller, starring Giancarlo Giannini, Mariangela Melato, Agostina Belli, Luigi Diberti, Elena Fiore, Tuccio Musumeci, Ignazio Pappalardo and Turi Ferro.

==Plot==
Set in both Sicily and mainland Italy, the film follows the adventures of a man nicknamed Mimi. Mimi is a poor laborer who is pressured by his employers to vote for the mafia candidate in a local election. Frustrated by the system and assured that the ballot will be secret, Mimi votes for the communist representative instead. However he is fired and assured he will never work again as the ballot was not secret. Disgusted Mimi flees to Turin, while his wife, Rosalia, stays in Sicily.

In Turin Mimi finds illegal construction work. When he witnesses one of the labourers falling to his death he helps the man into a van thinking that he is being taken to the hospital. When he discovers that his mafia bosses plan on dumping the body, Mimi tells him that his wife is the goddaughter of Liggio, a powerful mafioso. As a result, he is given a good union job at a factory. He also becomes further embroiled with the communist party.

One day, Mimi sees the beautiful Fiore on the street, selling sweaters. When she and her friend are attacked he helps them and learns that she is a Trotskyist. When they walk in the park he sexually assaults and tries to rape her, but Fiore fends Mimi off and says that she is a virgin, and will not make love with a man until she falls in love. Mimi continues to see her until finally, heartbroken he tells her that he loves her, but cannot bear to be around her as he feels she will never return his love. Fiore finally tells Mimi she loves him. Aware that Mimi is married, Fiore nevertheless takes him as a lover. She becomes pregnant, giving birth to a son, Mimi.

At the christening for their child, Mimi goes to get more champagne and happens upon a murder perpetrated by the mob. Though he is supposed to be shot, Mimi nevertheless ends up with only a scratch and, when the police question him, refuses to divulge any answers. As a result, he is promoted at work to a management job in Sicily. Terrified that his wife will discover his second family, Mimi hides Fiore and their child, and pretends to always be too tired for sex. That causes the townspeople to gossip, and begin to believe that Mimi is a homosexual. He is finally taken out by a few of his friends who tell him that Rosalia is pregnant with the child of another man, Amilcare. Mimi is outraged, and, after attacking Rosalia, tells her about Fiore and his son. Rosalia then decides to keep her child and refuses to divorce Mimi, gloating that her bastard child will bear his last name, while his son with Fiore will have a different name.

To avenge his honour, Mimi attempts to rape and then seduces Amalia, the wife of Amilcare. After sleeping with her he informs her that Amilcare had impregnated his wife, Rosalia. Initially horrified, Amalia decides that the best way for the two of them to get back at their cheating spouses is to conceive a child together, leading to monthly visits between the two.

When Amalia is several months pregnant, Mimi confronts her husband on the town steps, telling everyone there that Amalia is bearing Mimi&#x27;s child. Enraged, Amilcare threatens to shoot Mimi, but Mimi is unconcerned; having considered the possibility, he warned Amalia to empty Amilcare&#x27;s pistol. However, a man from the mafia, assigned to watch over Mimi, sees Amilcare reach for the pistol and shoots him, then shoves the smoking gun in Mimi&#x27;s hand; Mimi is then jailed for Amilcare&#x27;s murder. While in jail, Mimi is visited by a mafia man who informs him that, for taking the blame for the Amilcare murder, he is now a respected man and will be assured a job when he is released from jail. Mimi refuses; however, when released, Mimi is excited to see Fiore and little Mimi awaiting him. He is soon overwhelmed by Amalia and their child, and Rosalia&#x27;s bastard son, all of whom clamor for him, calling him &quot;Papa&quot;. In desperate need of money, Mimi goes to work for the mafia, promoting the election of Vico Tricarico. Disgusted that Mimi has abandoned his communist ideals, Fiore leaves him, taking young Mimi with her. Mimi chases after her, then collapses on the ground mourning his lost ideals.

==Production==
&quot;The Seduction of Mimi&quot; was the first collaboration between Lina Wertmüller and Mariangela Melato. For this film, she had to abandon Pietro Garinei&#x27;s and Alessandro Giovannini&#x27;s popular musical show &quot;Alleluja brava gente&quot;, which led to a dispute with the producers. &quot;The Seduction of Mimi&quot; was the start of a successful relationship between Wertmüller, Melato and Giannini that continued with &quot;Love and Anarchy&quot; (1973) and &quot;Swept Away&quot; (1974). Giannini had first worked with Wertmüller in &quot;Rita the Mosquito&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;The Seduction of Mimi&quot; was shown in competition at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival.

Though filmed before &quot;Love and Anarchy&quot;, &quot;The Seduction of Mimi&quot; did not receive a U.S. release until June 1974, two months after the successful U.S. release of &quot;Love and Anarchy&quot;.

==Awards==
* 1972 David di Donatello Award for Best Actor Giancarlo Giannini

==US remake==
&quot;The Seduction of Mimi&quot; was remade in the US as &quot;Which Way Is Up?&quot; starring Richard Pryor.

<text>Charles Brantley Aycock (November 1, 1859 – April 4, 1912) was the 50th governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1901 to 1905. After starting his career as a lawyer and teacher, he became active in the Democratic Party during the party&#x27;s Solid South period, and made his reputation as a prominent segregationist.

He became known as the &quot;Education Governor&quot; for advocating improvements to North Carolina&#x27;s public school systems. After he left office, he traveled the country promoting educational causes.

==Early life==
Charles B. Aycock was born in Wayne County, North Carolina, as the youngest of the 10 children of Benjamin and Serena Aycock. His family lived near the present-day town of Fremont, North Carolina, then known as Nahunta. Though his father died when he was 15, his mother and older brothers recognized his abilities and determined that he should go to college. Aycock attended the University of North Carolina (today the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) and joined the Philanthropic Society, a debate and literary society at the university. After graduating in 1880 with first honors in both oratory and essay writing, he entered law practice in Goldsboro and supplemented his income by teaching school. His success in both fields led to his appointment as superintendent of schools for Wayne County and to service on the school board in Goldsboro.

His political career began in 1888 as a presidential elector for Grover Cleveland, when he gained distinction as an orator and political debater. From 1893 to 1897, he served as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina.

==Personal life==
Aycock married Varina Woodard, daughter of Baptist lay minister and farmer William Woodard and Delpha Rountree Woodard, in 1881. They had three children together: Ernest Aycock, Charles Brantley Aycock, Jr., and Alice Varina Aycock. Ernest and the younger Charles died in childhood, while Alice went on to marry the writer Clarence Hamilton Poe. Varina died on July 9, 1889. On January 7, 1891, he married her sister, Cora Lily Woodard. They had seven children: William Benjamin Aycock, Mary Lily Aycock, Connor Woodard Aycock, John Lee Aycock, Louise Roundtree Aycock, Frank Daniels Aycock, and Brantley Aycock.

==White supremacy campaigns==
In 1898 and 1900, Aycock was prominent in the Democratic Party&#x27;s &quot;white supremacy&quot; campaigns. Aycock&#x27;s involvement with the Wilmington insurrection of 1898 is chronicled in an official state commission report. &quot;Planned violence to suppress the African American and Republican communities grew into unplanned bloodshed. The frenzy over white supremacy victory, incessantly repeated by orators such as Alfred Moore Waddell and Charles Aycock, simply could not be quieted after an overwhelming and somewhat anticlimactic election victory.&quot; Aycock was reportedly not present in Wilmington the day of the insurrection.

In 1899, the heavily Democratic state legislature of North Carolina passed a suffrage amendment to the state constitution. This amendment added a poll tax and literacy test intended to prevent black voting, and a grandfather clause to avoid disenfranchising poor white voters. Aycock supported the amendment, and urged legislatures to submit it to a popular vote in an August election, moved up from November. In that election, Aycock ran for governor against Republican Spencer B. Adams. On the campaign trail, his supporters displayed one of the rapid-fire guns from the Wilmington insurrection and Aycock regularly appeared with Red Shirts.

In the 1900 North Carolina gubernatorial election, the suffrage amendment was confirmed and Aycock was elected governor. He reportedly won 60% of the vote, but this was in part due to voter fraud. In several counties, the number of votes for Aycock exceeded the number of eligible voters by several hundred.

==Governor==
As governor, Aycock became known as the &quot;Education Governor&quot; for his support of the public school system. It was said that one school was constructed in the state for every day he was in office. He supposedly dedicated himself to education after watching his mother make her mark, rather than a signature, when signing a deed. Aycock felt that no lasting social reform could be accomplished without education. He supported increased salaries for teachers, longer school terms, and new school buildings: &quot;690 new schoolhouses erected, including 599 for whites and 91 for blacks.&quot;

Aycock is credited for adding schools for black students, but noted for advocating that black students be educated through curriculum and care tightly controlled by North Carolina whites, to &quot;benefit the black race to fit them into a subordinate role.&quot;

Historian Morgan Kousser wrote that Aycock&#x27;s progressive attitude toward black education was based on white Democrats&#x27; desire to ensure that the disfranchisement of black voters would not be reversed by federal government intervention. Kousser wrote, &quot;Some scholars have made a great deal of the opposition of &#x27;progressive&#x27; Governor Charles B. Aycock and state school superintendent James Y. Joyner to the movement for a constitutional amendment in North Carolina to limit black school expenditures to the amount paid by Negroes in taxes. It is true that Aycock threatened resignation if such a law passed and that, speaking to the legislature in 1903, he condemned the proposed measure as &#x27;unjust, unwise and unconstitutional.&#x27; Yet in the same address he put greater stress on his view that the act was impolitic than he did on its injustice. The law would invite a challenge in federal court, he believed, and &#x27;if it should be made to appear to the Court that in connection with our disfranchisement of the negro we had taken pains for providing to keep him in ignorance, then both amendments [the literacy test and racial separation of taxes] would fall together.&#x27; In other words, the disfranchisement of the almost unanimously Republican blacks, which was virtually priceless to the Democrats, would be bartered for the temporary gain of a few extra dollars of the school fund.&quot;Aycock presided other progressive measures as governor such as the building of roads, higher taxes taxes on corporations, the creation of new regulations on railroads, and the passage of child labor and temperance laws. Aycock fought against lynching as governor, but expanded the state&#x27;s convict leasing program, a &quot;de facto&quot; form of slavery.

==&quot;The Negro Problem&quot;==

On December 18, 1903, Governor Aycock went to Baltimore gave a speech to 300 people at the North Carolina Society. Entitled &quot;The Negro Problem,&quot; the speech outlined his thoughts on keeping blacks separate, subservient, and locked out of representative government by circumventing the Fifteenth Amendment, which guarantees the right to vote. Aycock&#x27;s may have been a response to the &quot;The Negro Problem,&quot; a book by prominent black scholars including W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington, that considers the web of economic, political, and social problems faced by blacks in their collective history as slaves and second-class citizens after Emancipation. The book had been released about two months before Aycock&#x27;s speech.

The speech is one of Aycock&#x27;s best-known and controversial:

I am proud of my State … because there we have solved the negro problem … We have taken him out of politics and have thereby secured good government under any party and laid foundations for the future development of both races. We have secured peace, and rendered prosperity a certainty.

I am inclined to give to you our solution of this problem. It is, first, as far as possible under the Fifteenth Amendment to disfranchise him; after that let him alone, quit writing about him; quit talking about him, quit making him “the white man’s burden,” let him “tote his own skillet”; quit coddling him, let him learn that no man, no race, ever got anything worth the having that he did not himself earn; that character is the outcome of sacrifice and worth is the result of toil; that whatever his future may be, the present has in it for him nothing that is not the product of industry, thrift, obedience to law, and uprightness; that he cannot, by resolution of council or league, accomplish anything; that he can do much by work; that violence may gratify his passions but it cannot accomplish his ambitions; that he may eat rarely of the cooking of equality, but he will always find when he does that “there is death in the pot.” Let the negro learn once for all that there is unending separation of the races, that the two peoples may develop side by side to the fullest but that they cannot intermingle; let the white man determine that no man shall by act or thought or speech cross this line, and the race problem will be at an end.

These things are not said in enmity to the negro but in regard for him. He constitutes one third of the population of my State: he has always been my personal friend; as a lawyer I have often defended him, and as Governor I have frequently protected him. But there flows in my veins the blood of the dominant race; that race that has conquered the earth and seeks out the mysteries of the heights and depths. If manifest destiny leads to the seizure of Panama, it is certain that it likewise leads to the dominance of the Caucasian. When the negro recognizes this fact we shall have peace and good will between the races.

But I would not have the white people forget their duty to the negro. We must seek the truth and pursue it. We owe an obligation to “the man in black”; we brought him here; he served us well; he is patient and teachable. We owe him gratitude; above all we owe him justice. We cannot forget his fidelity and we ought not to magnify his faults; we cannot change his color, neither can we ignore his service. No individual ever “rose on stepping stones of dead” others “to higher things,” and no people can. We must rise by ourselves, we must execute judgment in righteousness; we must educate not only ourselves but see to it that the negro has an opportunity for education. As a white man I am afraid of but one thing for my race and that is that we shall become afraid to give the negro a fair chance. The first duty of every man is to develop himself to the uttermost and the only limitation upon his duty is that he shall take pains to see that in his own development he does no injustice to those beneath him. This is true of races as well as of individuals. Considered properly it is not a limitation but a condition of development. The white man in the South can never attain to his fullest growth until he does absolute justice to the negro race. If he is doing that now, it is well for him. If he is not doing it, he must seek to know the ways of truth and pursue them. My own opinion is, that so far we have done well, and that the future holds no menace for us if we do the duty which lies next to us, training, developing the coming generation, so that the problems which seem difficult to us shall be easy to them.
==Later life ==
After leaving the governor&#x27;s office in 1905, Aycock resumed his law practice. He was persuaded to run for the Senate seat held by fellow Democrat Furnifold M. Simmons in 1912. But before the nomination was decided, Aycock died of a heart attack on April 4, 1912, while making a speech to 5,000 teachers at the convention of the Alabama Education Association in Birmingham. 

One account says, &quot;The subject of Aycock&#x27;s speech was &#x27;Universal Education&#x27;. After he had talked for a few minutes, Aycock spoke the words: &#x27;I have always talked about education—.&#x27; Here he stopped, threw up his hands, reeled backward, and fell dead&quot;. 

But another, by a reporter at the scene, says Aycock told the teachers, &quot;I have fought long the battles of education,&quot; and added, after asking a question of Alabama Governor Emmet O&#x27;Neal, &quot;However, I have determined, if such a thing is possible, to open the doors of the schools to every child...&quot; He stopped, staggered and fell dead of a heart attack.

==Legacy==

In Greensboro, North Carolina, the auditorium at UNC Greensboro, as well as a street, a neighborhood, and a middle school were named for him. Dormitories at UNC-Chapel Hill and East Carolina University campuses were named after him, although ECU renamed the dorm in 2015. UNC-Chapel Hill followed suit in 2020, renaming the dormitory for Hortense McClinton, the first black faculty member at the school. In Pikeville, North Carolina, there is a high school named after him. There is an Aycock Elementary School in Henderson.

The Aycock Elementary School in Asheville was closed in the 1980s and has been used as the campus for Asheville City Preschool and, more recently, Asheville Primary School (public Montessori); the plaque bearing the Aycock name was removed in 2020. Aycock High School in Cedar Grove graduated its last class in 1963. 

A small street in the Chapel Hill neighborhood of Governors Club is named after him, along with numerous other governors of North Carolina.

In 1965, a junior high school in Raleigh, North Carolina, was named after him; it was absorbed into William G. Enloe High School in 1979. A street in Raleigh&#x27;s Five Points neighborhood is named for him.

For most of the 20th century, Aycock was characterized by state historians and politicians as an admirable figure, reflected in the choice to have a statue of him as one of the two submitted by the state to the National Statuary Hall Collection. In the 1933 textbook &quot;The Story of North Carolina&quot;, Aycock is described as &quot;one of the best friends that colored people had.&quot; 

In recent years, that viewpoint has been challenged:

Often overlooked was Aycock&#x27;s role as a leading spokesman in the white supremacy campaigns of 1898 and 1900, which were marked by widespread violence, voter intimidation, voter fraud and even a coup d&#x27;état of the government of Wilmington … The campaigns had far-reaching consequences: blacks were removed from the voter rolls based on literacy tests, Jim Crow customs were encoded into law, and the Democratic Party controlled Tar Heel politics for two-thirds of the 20th century.
In 2011, the N.C. Democratic Party dropped Aycock&#x27;s name from its annual fundraiser after Democratic and Republican lawmakers drew attention to his white-supremacy ties. Aycock had been included in the fundraiser&#x27;s name since 1960.

On June 17, 2014, Duke University removed his name from a residence hall.

On February 20, 2015, East Carolina University trustees voted to remove Aycock&#x27;s name from a residence hall after a months-long debate with faculty, students, staff and alumni. The trustees directed the university to represent Aycock&#x27;s name in another campus location, where founders and other university supporters would be recognized.

In UNC Greensboro began reviewing proposals to remove Aycock&#x27;s name from campus buildings. On February 18, 2016, UNCG&#x27;s board of trustees voted unanimously to remove his name from the auditorium.

On August 25, 2015, the Guilford County school board voted 9–2 to rename Aycock Middle School in Greensboro, dropping the Aycock name.

On August 15, 2017, the Greensboro City Council voted to rename the Aycock Historic District, which included the formerly named Aycock Middle School (now Swann Middle School) to Dunleath Historic District.

On February 28, 2018, North Carolina governor Roy Cooper asked the Architect of the Capitol to replace Aycock&#x27;s statue with one of evangelist Billy Graham, pursuant to legislation signed in 2015. Graham&#x27;s statue was unveiled in National Stuatuary Hall on May 16, 2024, then moved to the Capitol Crypt.

On April 24, 2018, Greensboro City Council unanimously voted to rename North and South Aycock Street, which runs from West Florida Street to Wendover Avenue, to North and South Josephine Boyd Street after Josephine Boyd, the first black student to attend the all-white Greensboro High School (now Grimsley High School) in 1957.

On May 4, 2021, Raleigh City Council voted to rename Aycock Street to Roanoke Park Drive after a neighborhood petition.
