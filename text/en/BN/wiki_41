<text>Maryborough ( ) is a city and a suburb in the Fraser Coast Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , the suburb of Maryborough had a population of 15,287 people.

== Geography ==
Maryborough is located on the Mary River in Queensland, Australia, approximately north of the state capital, Brisbane. The city is served by the Bruce Highway. It is closely tied to its neighbour city Hervey Bay which is approximately northeast. Together they form part of the area known as the Fraser Coast.

The neighbourhood of Baddow is within the west of the suburb near the Mary River. It takes its name from Baddow House, a historic property in the area (). Baddow railway station () and Baddow Island () in the Mary River also take their names from the house.

== History ==
=== Original inhabitants, language and culture ===
Evidence of human inhabitation of the Maryborough region stretches back to at least 6,000 years ago. The Gubbi Gubbi (Kabi Kabi) and Batjala (Butchulla) people were the original inhabitants of the region. The Gubbi Gubbi were described as an inland tribe of the Wide Bay–Burnett area, whose lands extended over 3,700 sq. miles and lay west of Maryborough. The northern borders ran as far as Childers and Hervey Bay. On the south, they approached the headwaters of the Mary River and Cooroy. Westwards, they reached as far as the Coast Ranges and Kilkivan. The Batjala occupied the more coastal regions including K’gari (Fraser Island).

The Batjala and Gubbi Gubbi spoke dialects of the Dippil language, the Batjala dialect being spoken in the Fraser Coast region, while the Gubbi Gubbi dialect was spoken in what is now the Gympie and Sunshine Coast regions.

The escaped convict James Davis lived among various clans of the Gubbi Gubbi and John Mathew, a clergyman turned anthropologist, also spent five years with them and mastered their language. Dippil language was first described by the Reverend William Ridley on the basis of notes taken from an interview with James Davis in 1855.

The Queensland lungfish was native to Gubbi Gubbi waters and the species fell under a taboo among them, forbidding its consumption. It was known in their language as &#x27;dala&#x27;. The Batjala considered porpoises to be of a status close to sacred.

=== The arrival of the British ===
British navigators Matthew Flinders in 1802 and William Edwardson in 1822 were the first Europeans to take detailed surveys of the Hervey Bay coastline. They both noted that the native population living on its shores appeared numerous. The first British people to live in the region were escaped convicts from the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement. Convicts Richard Parsons and John Graham both briefly lived with local Aboriginals during the late 1820s. James Davis, however, lived with several Gubbi Gubbi clans from 1829 to 1842. He became a member of their society and was given the name Duramboi. In 1842, Andrew Petrie and Henry Stuart Russell sailed up the river known to the Gubbi as the &quot;Monoboola&quot; (later known as the Mary River) looking for land and timber to exploit. They found Duramboi living with the Ginginbara clan of the Gubbi along its banks at a camp close to where the town of Maryborough is now situated.

=== Colonisation and conflict ===
After these initial explorations, pastoral squatters started to enter the region looking to establish sheep stations. The first of these was Mynarton Joliffe who, under the employment of the prosperous squatter John Eales, overlanded 16,000 sheep and set up the Tiaro property in 1843. Aboriginal resistance was fierce, shepherds and livestock were killed, and Joliffe had to abandon the area within eighteen months. During this time, Commissioner of Crown Lands, Stephen Simpson visited the area and determined that the junction of two waterways (later known as the Mary river and Tinana Creek) would be a suitable place for a township. Squatters started to return to the area in 1847 after John Charles Burnett conducted a more thorough survey of the region.

Maryborough itself was founded in 1847 by George Furber who established a small wool depot on the banks of the river. A year later Edgar Thomas Aldridge with Henry Palmer and his brother Richard E. Palmer constructed several permanent buildings and in 1849 a post office, petty sessions court and police station overseen by John Carne Bidwill opened. Edmund Blucher Uhr established a boiling down facility in 1850 and John George Walker started a boatyard not long after. The site for the township was laid out by the government surveyor H.H. Labatt in 1850 and the first land sales occurred in January 1852. The name Maryborough was derived from the Mary River which itself was named in 1847 after Mary Lennox, the wife of Charles Augustus Fitzroy who was the Governor of New South Wales at the time.

Aboriginal resistance remained determined with numerous Mary River squatters and their shepherds being wounded or killed. Within weeks of his arrival, George Furber was seriously wounded by local Aboriginal people, as were other newly arrived colonists such as Alexander Scott. Furber would later shoot dead the Aboriginal man who tried to kill him outside a store in Maryborough. The body of the man was then taken by the local Aboriginal tribe to a location about half a mile away, where it was cut up, roasted, and eaten. About two or three years later, Furber and his newly arrived son-in-law was killed by two Aboriginal men in 1855. One of the Aboriginal men who murdered Furber was named Minni-Minni, and said that the murder was retribution for Furber killing his mother on suspicion of stealing some flour and other articles from his tent.

In November 1850, after receiving intelligence of the murder of a shepherd and the loss of a flock of sheep, the Native Police started to enter the area. Lieutenant Richard Marshall with the assistance of Mary River settlers such as John Murray and Henry Cox Corfield, conducted expeditions to find the stolen sheep. In 1851, the Commandant of the Native Police, Frederick Walker, was called in to apprehend a number of Aboriginal men who had committed criminal acts on the mainland, and were hiding out on K&#x27;gari. Walker sailed with three sections of troopers down the Mary River. After landing at K&#x27;gari, the men who were guarding the boats saw a group of Aboriginal men in a stolen boat, which was then later captured. Another stolen boat was observed and shot at, with the Aboriginal crew escaping to a nearby island. While the men camped, the Aboriginal&#x27;s tried to ambush them, with two of them were killed in the engagements. It was later discovered that the Aboriginal&#x27;s had partly eaten one of the bodies. Another section captured a number of people while another section followed other inhabitants across to the east coast where they escaped into the ocean. In 1856, a Native Police barracks was constructed on the outskirts of the town at Owanyilla. In early 1860, Lieutenant John O&#x27;Connell Bligh and his troopers conducted an early morning raid on a group of Aboriginal people, killing at least two and wounding many others, in the streets of Maryborough. The townspeople gave Bligh a sword thanking him for his actions.

By the late 1860s Aboriginal resistance to colonisation in the Maryborough district had been defeated with the survivors existing in poverty as fringe-dwellers. Many of these people were forcibly transferred to an isolation camp on K&#x27;gari in the 1890s and later shipped to Far North Queensland to the Yarrabah facility.

=== Sugar ===
The early Maryborough economy was centred around livestock farming, logging of the bunya pine forests, and the boiling down of animal carcasses to make tallow. In the late 1850s the soil along the Mary River was deemed ideal for the cultivation of sugarcane and in 1859 Edgar Thomas Aldridge was able to grow and produce a world-class experimental crop. Seeing the profitable potential, many influential local landholders such as Henry Palmer and John Eaton formed the Maryborough Sugar Company in 1865. Farmers switched to growing cane and the first Mary River sugar refinery, known as the Central Mill, was built in 1867 by Robert Greathead and Frederick Gladwell.

At this time, other sugar plantations in Queensland were importing cheap, sometimes blackbirded labour from islands in the South Pacific. The planters along the Mary River also used this type of labour and the first shipment of 84 South Sea Islander workers arrived in Maryborough in November 1867. They came aboard the schooner &quot;Mary Smith&quot;, owned by Robert Greathead, with 22 of the labourers being engaged by the Maryborough Sugar Company. Concerns were raised about whether the Islanders on the &quot;Mary Smith&quot; understood the work contracts and if the pledge to return them would be honoured due to the lack of an interpreter. It was also alleged that the captain sold the Islanders to the colonists for £9 a head, while a missionary noted that the Islanders were unlikely to understand why they were taken.

In 1869, Robert Tooth and Robert Cran bought up a number of plantations in the region and established the Yengarie Sugar Refinery. They became the local dominant sugar manufacturer with the Maryborough Sugar Company becoming insolvent. By the end of the 1870s, Robert Cran and his sons had taken control of operations under the name Cran &amp; Co.

=== Economic and civic expansion ===
An unnamed Catholic School had opened by February 1858. Teaching was undertaken by lay teachers as there were no Catholic religious orders in Maryborough at that time. It closed in 1888.
Maryborough was proclaimed a municipality in 1861, and became a city in 1905. During the second half of the 19th-century, the city was a major port of entry for immigrants arriving in Queensland from all parts of the world.

Maryborough Central State School opened on 1862. Circa 1874/75 it separated into Maryborough Central Boys School and Maryborough Central Girls&#x27; and Infants&#x27; School. In 1878 the Girls&#x27; and Infants&#x27; School separated into Maryborough Central Girls&#x27; School and Maryborough Central Infants&#x27; School. On 29 July 1932, Maryborough Central Boys School and Maryborough Central Girls School were closed and combined to become Maryborough Central State School. Maryborough Central Infants State School closed on 12 December 1986.
On Sunday 18 September 1864, a Wesleyan Methodist Church opened on a site on the eastern corner of Adelaide Street and Alice Street (). It was a timber building in the Gothic style, capable of seating 200 people on open benches. The architect was Reverend Thomas Holme and the builders were Messrs Hart and Marshall. Prior to the opening of the church, Wesleyan services were initially held in a store in Adelaide Street and then in the Maryborough School of Arts. By August 1882, the church building had become too small and started to show signs of decay, so the southern corner of Adelaide and Alice Street (that is, on the same side of Adelaide Street) was purchased to construct the new church (). In February 1883, the site of the 1864 church was offered for sale, as the 1864 church was to be relocated to the rear of the new church to be used as a Sunday school hall. The foundation stone for the new church was laid on Tuesday 27 February 1883, and the British ensign was waved from the finial of the new church&#x27;s spire on Friday 22 June 1883 to signify the completion of the highest point of the building. On Sunday 16 December 1883, the new brick church was officially opened and consecrated, as part of a program of church services, public lectures, tea-meetings, and concerts to celebrate the occasion. The church participated in the 1977 amalgamation that created Uniting Church in Australia. It was demolished some time after 1982.

In July 1870, St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic School was established in Adelaide Street by Mary MacKillop and her Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart. The school was for girls and infants, with boys continuing to attend the Catholic school taught by lay teachers. St Joseph&#x27;s closed in March 1879, as the consequence of a long-running dispute between MacKillop and the Roman Catholic Bishop of Brisbane, James Quinn, over whether the Sisters or the diocese should control the schools. In 1879 Quinn directed MacKillop and her sisters to leave the diocese, despite protests from the laity. In 1880 the Sisters of Mercy arrived in Maryborough and re-opened the school on 1 April 1880 as St Mary&#x27;s School. St Mary&#x27;s School expanded to offer secondary school for girls in 1928. In 1978, a desire for co-education was achieved by amalgamating with Sacred Heart College to create two new schools St Mary&#x27;s Primary School (the primary school for boys and girls) and St Mary&#x27;s College (the secondary school for boys and girls) which commenced operation in 1979.

St Paul&#x27;s Anglican church opened in 1879, replacing an earlier timber church on the same site. The architect was FDG Stanley. A memorial hall was added in 1921; it was designed by POE Hawkes.

Maryborough Boys Grammar opened in 1881 and Maryborough Girls Grammar opened circa 1882. In 1936, the Queensland Department of Education took over both grammar schools and created three schools: Maryborough Boys State Intermediate School, Maryborough Boys State High School, and Maryborough Girls State High and Intermediate School. In 1952 Maryborough Girls State High and Intermediate School were separated into Maryborough Girls State Intermediate School and Maryborough Girls State High School. In 1964 the two boys&#x27; schools amalgamated to become Maryborough Boys State High School and the two girls&#x27; schools amalgamated to form Maryborough Girls State High School. In 1974 the boys&#x27; and girl&#x27;s High Schools were amalgamated to form Maryborough State High School.

The first section of what is now the North Coast Line opened on 6 August 1881, connecting the mining town of Gympie to the river port at Maryborough and followed the Mary River valley. The Queensland Government was under constant pressure to reduce expenditure, and so despite the potential for the line to be part of a future main line, the line was constructed to pioneer standards with minimal earthworks, a sinuous alignment and lightweight rails.

Coal had been discovered at Burrum, north of Maryborough, and a line was constructed to serve the mine, opening in 1883. The line was extended to Bundaberg in 1888 so coal could be shipped there as well. When the Burrum line was built, it junctioned from the Maryborough line at Baddow, from the station, creating a triangular junction, with platforms ultimately being provided on all three sides. Maryborough railway station was situated immediately adjacent to the commercial centre of the city, and converting it into a through station would have been prohibitively expensive.

Albert State School opened on 9 July 1883.

In 1885, a Baptist Church opened in Maryborough.

Newtown Maryborough State School opened on 19 July 1886, but it was renamed Maryborough West State School later that same year.
On Friday 7 October 1887 Archbishop William Webber laid the foundation stone of St Thomas&#x27; Anglican Church and School in Pallas Street and Theresa Street. On Wed 21 December 1887 St Thomas Anglican Church was officially opened at 197 Pallas Street (). The church was erected by Edgar Thomas Aldridge, of Baddow House in memory of his wife Maria who died on 17 March 1886. Its closure on 29 October 2005 was approved by Assistant Bishop Appleby.

On 3 September 1888, the Christian Brothers established Sacred Heart College for older boys, leaving St Mary&#x27;s School to educate all younger children and the older girls (with no further need for the lay Catholic school). Sacred Heart College closed in 1978, due to a move to co-education achieved by amalgamating with St Mary&#x27;s School to create two new schools St Mary&#x27;s Primary School (the primary school for boys and girls) and St Mary&#x27;s College (the secondary school for boys and girls) which commenced operation in 1979.

Sunbury State School opened on 18 January 1891.

When through trains commenced running from Brisbane to Bundaberg and beyond, trains ran into Maryborough, a fresh steam locomotive was attached to the other end of the train, and it then departed. Once diesel locomotives were introduced, there was no need to replace engines, and through trains paused at Baddow on the 3rd leg of the triangular junction before proceeding north. A one carriage connecting service was provided from Maryborough to meet the through train at Baddow, and then return. As trains became longer, the platform on the 3rd leg was not of sufficient length, and the trains would stop on the platform on the line to Maryborough, having to reverse out of, or back into the platform before proceeding further, adding about 15 minutes to the journey. The situation was finally resolved with the opening of the Maryborough West bypass in 1988.

Point Lookout Croquet Club was established in 1898, making it the oldest croquet club in Queensland.
Australia&#x27;s only outbreak of pneumonic plague occurred in Maryborough in 1905. At the time Maryborough was Queensland&#x27;s largest port—a reception centre for wool, meat, timber, sugar and other rural products. A freighter from Hong Kong, where plague was rampant, was in the Port of Maryborough about the time that a wharf worker named Richard O&#x27;Connell took home some sacking from the wharf, for his children to sleep on. Subsequently, five of the seven O&#x27;Connell children, two nurses, and a neighbour died from the disease. There were no more cases but the ensuing fear, panic, and hysteria totally consumed the town, and a huge crowd gathered to witness the family&#x27;s house being burnt to the ground by health officials. A memorial fountain was built in the grounds of the City Hall and dedicated to the nurses, Cecelia Bauer and Rose Wiles.
The foundation stone of Maryborough War Memorial was laid on 22 May 1921 by Lieutenant Colonel James Durrant. It was dedicated on 19 November 1922.

The Andronicus Brothers - Jim and George, formerly from the Greek island of Kythera, established the Café Mimosa in Kent Street, Maryborough in the 1920s. Café Mimosa had a reception lounge above the café large enough to host sporting teams, wedding receptions, musical events and the Philharmonic choir during its practice sessions.

Maryborough Special School opened on 1 January 1969.

Aldridge State High School opened on 30 January 1973. It was named after Edgar Thomas Aldridge, the first resident of Baddow.

The Maryborough Library opened in 1977 and underwent a major refurbishment in 2011. The Maryborough Toy and Special Needs Library opened in 2006.

In 1979, the desire for Catholic co-education resulted in the amalgamation of St Mary&#x27;s School and Sacred Heart College to create St Mary&#x27;s Primary School (the primary school for boys and girls) and St Mary&#x27;s College (the secondary school for boys and girls).

St Aidan&#x27;s Anglican Church at Baddow closed circa 1983.

St Mary&#x27;s College opened on 1983.

In 2008 the Maryborough City Council was amalgamated into the Fraser Coast Regional Council.

==Economy and industry==

Tourism plays a significant part in the economy of the city today. Maryborough is the self-styled &quot;Heritage City of Queensland&quot; and holds heritage markets each Thursday. The city has many preserved 19th and 20th century buildings including the General Post Office and Customs House.

The main industrial company in the city today is Downer Rail, formerly Walkers Limited, a heavy engineering business which has built much of the rolling stock and locomotives for Queensland Rail and in past years was involved in shipbuilding. Downer Rail, together with Bombardier Transportation, built and tested Transperth&#x27;s relatively modern B-Series trains in Maryborough, which were launched in Perth in late 2004. It has built many trains for Queensland Rail. Bombardier Transportation closed its factory in Maryborough in December 2015.

Maryborough Sugar Factory, in Kent Street was established in 1956. There were many smaller sugar mills which were established by sugar cane farmers along the Mary River. Island Plantation had one of the first sugar crushing mill set up along the river. One of the old settlements in Maryborough is at a place called Dundathu. Here the first timber mill was established in the 1800s. The timber was bought down the river and carted to the Timber Mill by horse and cart. The timber mill burnt down in the 1900s.

Maryborough&#x27;s income also comes from numerous farming and station prospects in and around the city and has a healthy fishing industry. The city also has had traditional ties to the timber industry and is home to Hyne &amp; Son one of the largest producers of natural timber products in Australia.

Maryborough was once a prominent centre of railway and tramway operations, including a branch to the wharf on the Mary River.

==Transport==

Maryborough West station is on the North Coast line. It is served by long-distance Traveltrain services: the Spirit of Queensland, Spirit of the Outback and the Bundaberg and Rockhamption Tilt Trains.

This station, on the western outskirts of the city, was built in the late 1980s as part of a seven kilometre new alignment built when the North Coast line was electrified. It replaced Maryborough station in the central business district, although the eight kilometre branch remains in use to service the 66 Rail workshops.

Maryborough is served by Greyhound Australia coach services to Brisbane, Hervey Bay, Agnes Water and Cairns, Premier Motor Services services to Brisbane and Cairns and Tory&#x27;s Tours services to Brisbane and Hervey Bay.

Local bus services are provided by Wide Bay Transit as part of the QConnect network.

<doc id="434303" wikidata="Q4703366" url="?curid=434303" title="Zaidi (surname)">
<text>The surname Al-Zaidi (Az-Zaidi) can denote one or both of the following:

*Sayyid Arab descendants of Zayd ibn Ali that either stayed in Kufa, Iraq or returned to Al-Hijaz.
*The use of the surname Al-Zaidi to designate association may be with the Zaidiyyah &quot;madhhab&quot;, whose adherents are found in Yemen. This is akin to the use of the surnames Al-Hanafi, Al-Maliki, Al-Shafi&#x27;i, etc.
People with the surname Zaidi trace their origins to the Islamic Holy City of Mecca, located in present-day Saudi Arabia. Zaid ibn Ali was the son of Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-&#x27;Abidin who was the great-grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad thus the descendants of Zaid ibn Ali are known as Sayyid- an honorific title bestowed upon to the descendants of Muhammad. In Present times, the Descendants of Zaid ibn Ali can be found in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, India and Pakistan. The ones in India and Pakistan carry the surname Zaidi along with Wasti (denoting Zayd ibn Ali&#x27;s descendants from Wasit) with Sadaat-e-Bara and Sadaat-e-Bilgram as prominent communities, they are followers of Twelver Shi&#x27;ism not Zaydism which is largely restricted to Yemen.

== The Wasitis/Zaidis in South Asia ==
The Zaidis of the Indian subcontinent use the proper noun &quot;Wasiti&quot; as a form of self-identification. Zayd ibn Ali is believed to have succumbed to injuries he sustain during a battle in Kufa, Iraq; many of his descendants either returned to al-Hijaz or remained in Iraq. Some of those who stayed in Iraq settled in Wasit. Some descendants from Wasit then moved to the Indian subcontinent. Most of the Zaidis migrated after the Mongol Siege of Baghdad in 1258. Most of them are settled in Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, India and Pakistan.

The largest group among those identifying themselves as Zaidi is &quot;Saadat-e-Bara&quot;. &quot;Saadat&quot; means descendant of Muhammad and &quot;Bara&quot; means twelve in Urdu. There are many interpretations of word bara and many spellings are current: Bara, Bahera, Barha (as spelled in &quot;Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri&quot;, &quot;Akbarnama&quot; and other Moghul sources) and Bahira meaning &quot;bright&quot; in Arabic language. One explanation of the word is as mentioned above; another is that there are twelve villages in Muzaffarnagar district and their residents were called Sadat Barha.

Aurangzeb wrote about the Syeds of Barha:
&quot;You should be extremely cautious in dealing with the Syeds of Barha...because a strong partner in government would soon seize the kingship for himself.&quot;

The Barha Sayyids in Muzaffarnagar rose as the de facto rulers of the Mughal empire, under their leaders Qutb-ul-Mulk and Ihtimam-ul-Mulk who deposed the Emperors Jahandar Shah, Farrukhsiyar, Rafi ud-Darajat and Shah Jahan II.

These Sayyeds are descendants of Sayyid Abu&#x27;l Farah Al Hussaini Al Wasti who came to India from Wasit (Iraq) in the 11th century along with his four sons who settled in four villages of Punjab, Kundliwaal, Chhatbanur, Tihanpur and Jajner giving names to all four clans of Sadat Barha. Their numbers are highest in Karachi (Pakistan) and Muzaffarnagar (India). The Kundliwal clan mainly live in Mujhera, Galibpur, Hashimpur, and Sikrehra Khola. The Chhatraudi clan mainly live in Sambalhera. Many of them migrated to Pakistan during the partition of India.

<doc id="434308" wikidata="Q936593" url="?curid=434308" title="The Ghan">
<text>The Ghan () is an experiential tourism-oriented passenger train service that operates between the northern and southern coasts of Australia, through the cities of Adelaide, Alice Springs and Darwin on the Adelaide–Darwin rail corridor. 

Operated by Journey Beyond, its scheduled travelling time, including extended stops for passengers
to do off-train tours, is 53 hours 15 minutes to travel the . The Ghan has been described as one of the world&#x27;s greatest passenger trains.

==Etymology==


The service&#x27;s name is an abbreviated version of its previous nickname, &quot;The Afghan Express&quot;. The nickname is reputed to have been bestowed in 1923 by one of its crews. Some suggest the train&#x27;s name honours Afghan camel drivers who arrived in Australia in the late 19th century to help the British colonists find a way to reach the country&#x27;s interior.

A contrary view is that the name was a veiled insult. In 1891, the railway from Quorn reached remote Oodnadatta where an itinerant population of around 150 cameleers were based, generically called &quot;Afghans&quot;. &quot;The Ghan Express&quot; name originated with train crews in the 1890s as a taunt to officialdom because, when an expensive sleeping car was put on from Quorn to Oodnadatta, &quot;on the first return journey the only passenger was an Afghan&quot;, mocking its commercial viability.

By as early as 1924, because of the notorious unreliability of this fortnightly steam train, European pastoralists commonly called it &quot;in ribald fashion The Afghan Express&quot;. By 1951, when steam engines were replaced by diesel-electric locomotives, this disparaging derivation, like the cameleers, had faded away. Modern marketing has completed the name turnabout.

==Operations==
&quot;The Ghan&quot; was privatised in 1997 and has since then been operated by Journey Beyond Rail Expeditions (formerly known as Great Southern Rail), initially as part of the Serco Group. Great Southern Rail was sold to Allegro Funds, a Sydney investment fund, in March 2015.

The train usually runs once weekly. During December 2012 and January 2013, it ran only once every two weeks. Until 2016, a second service operated between June and September, recommencing again in May 2019 due to demand. The train stops at Adelaide, Alice Springs, Katherine and Darwin; the stops at Alice Springs and Katherine allow time for passengers to take optional tours.

Each train has an average of 28 stainless steel carriages, built by Comeng, Granville, in the late 1960s and early 1970s for the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot;, plus a motorail wagon. The average length of the train is . Two Pacific National NR class locomotives haul the train, previously AN class or a DL class locomotives assisted. Locomotive crews are sourced from Pacific National, with the on-train staff employed by Journey Beyond.

==History==
Starting in August 1929, &quot;The Ghan&quot; ran on the Central Australia Railway, originally built as a narrow-gauge railway to Alice Springs under Chief Engineer, Commonwealth Railways, N. G. Bell. In 1957, the standard gauge Stirling North to Marree line opened, and the &quot;Ghan&quot; was curtailed to operate only north of Marree.

In October 1980, the remainder of the line was replaced by a standard-gauge line built to the west of the original line. An extension north from Alice Springs to Darwin opened in January 2004.

===Original Ghan===
Construction of what was then known as the Port Augusta to Government Gums Railway began in 1878 when Premier of South Australia William Jervois broke ground at Port Augusta. The line reached Hawker in June 1880, Beltana in July 1881, Marree in January 1884 and Oodnadatta in January 1891. Work on the extension to Alice Springs began in 1926, and was completed in 1929. Until then, the final leg of the train journey was still made by camel.

Although there were plans from the beginning to extend the line to Darwin, by the time the extension to Alice Springs had been completed, &quot;The Ghan&quot; was losing money and the plans for further extension to Darwin were suspended indefinitely. The original &quot;Ghan&quot; line followed the same track as the overland telegraph, which is believed to be the route taken by John McDouall Stuart during his 1862 crossing of Australia.

&quot;The Ghan&quot; service was notorious for delays caused by washouts of the track. A flatcar immediately behind the locomotive carried spare sleepers and railway tools, so passengers and crew could repair the line. The very uncertain service via this route was tolerated because steam locomotives needed large quantities of water, and Stuart&#x27;s route to Alice Springs was the only one that had sufficient available water.

Initially operated fortnightly, in the 1930s, it was increased to weekly. From 1956 until 1975, it operated twice weekly, before reverting to a weekly service.

During World War II, the service had to be greatly expanded, putting great pressure on the limited water supplies. As a result, de-mineralisation towers, some of which survive to this day, were built along the track so that bore water could be used. When a new line to Alice Springs was built in the 1970s, the use of diesel locomotives meant that there was far less need for water, thus allowing the line to take the much drier route from Tarcoola to Alice Springs.

The last narrow gauge service departed Alice Springs on 26 November 1980.

===New line===
In October 1980, a new standard gauge line from Tarcoola on the Trans-Australian Railway to Alice Springs opened, and the train took the form it has today. The new line is approximately west of the former line in order to avoid floodplains where the original line was often washed away during heavy rain. It was also hoped that the construction of the new line would improve the train&#x27;s timekeeping.

The first &quot;Ghan&quot; on the new line departed Adelaide on 11 December 1980. It initially operated as a broad gauge service to Port Pirie. Following the conversion of the Adelaide to Crystal Brook to standard gauge in 1982, it operated as a standard gauge train throughout. Operating weekly, a second service was operated between May and October.

In November 1998, one service per week was extended from Adelaide to Melbourne while from April 1999, the other was diverted to operate to Sydney via Broken Hill. The extensions were withdrawn in November 2002 and March 2003 respectively.

===Connection to Darwin===
Construction of Alice Springs–Darwin line was believed to be the second-largest civil engineering project in Australia, and the largest since the creation of the Snowy Mountains Scheme.
Line construction began in July 2001, with the first passenger train reaching Darwin on 3 February 2004, after 126 years of planning and waiting and at a cost of $1.3 billion.

&quot;The Ghan&#x27;s&quot; arrival in Darwin signified a new era of tourism in the Northern Territory, making travel to the region easier and more convenient. The rail link will allow for more freight to travel through the region, leading to a hope that Darwin will serve as another trade link with Asia.

In preparation for the connection to Darwin, one of the locomotives was named after wildlife expert Steve Irwin, an international symbol of outback Australia, to promote the new service and tourism to the region.

=== Suspension during pandemic ===
The Ghan was suspended for five months from March to August 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions and border closures – the longest suspension in the train&#x27;s existence. The first post-COVID train departed Adelaide for Darwin on 31 August 2020. The train would later be suspended again on its final run of the 2020 season due to a lockdown in South Australia.

==Media depictions==
The original &quot;Ghan&quot; was featured in an episode of BBC Television&#x27;s series &quot;Great Railway Journeys of the World&quot; in 1980, presented by Michael Frayn.

The modern &quot;Ghan&quot; featured in an episode of Channel 5 series &quot;Chris Tarrant: Extreme Railways&quot;, and the &quot;Mighty Trains&quot; series.

In 2018, it was also the subject of SBS slow television documentary &quot;The Ghan: Australia&#x27;s Greatest Train Journey&quot;. The entire journey from Adelaide to Darwin which was filmed in 2017, was condensed into a three-hour highlights show with no voiceover or narration, much of it featuring footage directly from the front of the locomotive and various helicopter views. An extended 17-hour version of the show aired on SBS&#x27;s secondary channel, SBS Viceland.

In October 2019, the train featured in BBC Two&#x27;s episode one of Michael Portillo&#x27;s &quot;Great Australian Railway Journeys&quot;.

The Ghan is the setting of Benjamin Stevenson&#x27;s 2023 novel, &quot;Everyone on this train is a suspect&quot;, in which a group of crime writers attempt to solve a murder on board the train.

==Noteworthy incidents==
* On 24 October 2002, &quot;The Ghan&quot; collided with a school bus in Salisbury, South Australia. Four people on the bus were killed, but there were no significant injuries to &quot;Ghan&quot; passengers.
*On 12 December 2006, &quot;The Ghan&quot; collided with a truck at a level crossing and derailed south of Adelaide River in the Northern Territory. Seven of the eleven carriages came off the tracks. One woman was critically injured; other passengers received only minor injuries. The truck driver involved was arrested, according to the NT police, charged and found guilty of a number of charges related to the accident.
* On 4 March 2007, rain washed out a portion of the track between Darwin and Adelaide River. During the period of repairs, trains terminated at Katherine.
*On 6 August 2007, &quot;The Ghan&quot; collided with a sewage truck at a level crossing north of Adelaide in South Australia. Three passengers suffered from shock and minor injuries. The truck driver was temporarily trapped in his vehicle.
*On 6 June 2009, a nineteen-year-old American tourist clung to the outside of &quot;The Ghan&quot; for two hours and when he was locked out of the train following a stop in Port Augusta. A technician heard his screams and stopped the train.

<doc id="434311" wikidata="Q5550364" url="?curid=434311" title="Gerb (pyrotechnic)">
<text>A gerb is a type of firework which produces a jet of sparks, usually lasting between 15 and 60 seconds. It is a thick-walled tube filled with pyrotechnic composition and possessing a choke, which is a narrowing in the tube. Gerbs are often referred to as &#x27;fountains&#x27; (spark fountain).

Sometimes a small charge of black powder is added to the bottom of a gerb to make it finish with a bang: this charge is known as the &#x27;bounce&#x27;. These are commonly used at sporting events.

Gerbs intended for use indoors near a proximate audience, such as at a rock concert, typically have shorter durations (from to 30 seconds) and heights (4 to 50 feet).

Gerbs are usually measured in terms of time and height. For example, a 4×4 burns for 4 seconds at a height of 4 feet.

Eric Newby&#x27;s book &quot;The Last Grain Race&quot; (chapter two: &quot;Mountstewart&quot;) contains a 1938 reference to what appears to be the original gerb—in effect a mortar bomb fired from a mortar.</text><links>

<doc id="434314" wikidata="Q124334026" url="?curid=434314" title="Adelaide–Darwin railway line">
<text>The Adelaide–Darwin rail corridor consists of the long standard-gauge main line between the South Australian capital city of Adelaide and the Northern Territory capital of Darwin, and the lines immediately connected to it. Preceded by a number of other shorter railways, a transcontinental line through to Darwin was only fully realised in 2004, when the final link from Alice Springs was opened. The line is used by interstate freight trains operated by Aurizon and by &quot;The Ghan&quot; passenger train operated by Journey Beyond.

==First steps toward a transcontinental railway==


Under the provisions of the &quot;Northern Territory Acceptance Act 1910&quot;, the Commonwealth Railways assumed responsibility for the South Australian Railways&#x27; narrow gauge lines in the far north of South Australia and the Northern Territory. The Act mandated the building of a south–north railway although, crucially, no date was specified. Two routes were considered: a standard gauge line branching off the Trans-Australian Railway at Tarcoola or a cheaper extension, from Oodnadatta, of the narrow gauge Central Australia Railway (CAR) line that had opened in 1891. Eventually the latter was chosen, and the extension to Alice Springs was opened in 1929. Meanwhile, the North Australia Railway (NAR) opened in stages south from Darwin to Birdum, the latter being reached in 1929.

In the late 1940s, the South Australian Government developed the Leigh Creek coalfields, 271 km (168 mi) north of Port Augusta to provide coal for a power station in Adelaide and, later, for a new power station built at the port. The infrastructure of the CAR was inadequate for the increased tonnages to be carried, so the federal government funded a new standard gauge line from Stirling North to the coalfields, and on to Marree to provide cattle transport. The northernmost two-thirds followed an alignment generally within of the narrow-gauge line. The southern third avoided the impediments of the mountainous section near Quorn and Hawker. The new standard-gauge line covered one-third of the distance to Alice Springs, and a Commonwealth Railways booklet mentioned its &quot;special importance to the Northern Territory as it is the first stage in the ultimate conversion of the narrow-gauge railway to Alice Springs to standard 4 ft  in gauge&quot;.

==Tarcoola to Alice Springs==

By 1967, interest in a transcontinental route had revived again. Extension of the route then in existence was one of three options considered, but a route far to the west, largely free of flood events, was chosen. Construction of the current 828 km (515 mi) kilometre line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs began in April 1975, opening in October 1980. The CAR closed shortly after. By then, the NAR had closed, in June 1976, following the closure of the iron ore mine at Frances Creek.

==Alice Springs to Darwin==
In 1983, the federal government announced its intention to extend the standard gauge line from Alice Springs to Darwin to complete the Adelaide–Darwin rail corridor. It was planned to open in 1988, Australia&#x27;s bicentenary year. After a change of federal government in March 1983, the new government cancelled the project, and the project languished for a further 16 years.

In June 1999, the AustralAsia Rail Corporation, a company owned by the Northern Territory and South Australian Governments, was awarded the contract to build and operate a Alice Springs to Darwin line as a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer project to the Asia Pacific Transport Consortium (APTC). The APTC contracted FreightLink to implement the project and to operate the railway. It cost $1.2 billion to build.

The Federal Government contributed $165 million from the Centenary of Federation Fund, the Northern Territory Government contributed $165 million and the South Australian Government contributed $150 million to the AustralAsia Rail Corporation for the construction of assets by the APTC and FreightLink that were later leased for a peppercorn rent to FreightLink. In addition, the three governments contributed about $26 million each, a total of $79 million in further funding to support the APTC directly, by way of mezzanine debt financing (subordinated debt), equity, and contingent equity. Construction began in July 2001. Completion occurred in September 2003. On 17 January 2004 the first freight train reached Darwin. On 4 February 2004 the first passenger train arrived in Darwin from Adelaide, travelling in 47 hours.

==In operation==
FreightLink failed to make a profit in the first four years. In May 2008 the company announced that the board, shareholders and lenders had agreed to sell the company&#x27;s ownership of the Alice Springs to Darwin line, citing its inheritance of a large amount of debt from the construction phase that it was unable to manage. In November 2008, FreightLink went into voluntary administration after failing to reach agreement with creditors on the terms of a sale of the business. Genesee &amp; Wyoming Australia, later acquired by Aurizon, purchased the assets of FreightLink in June 2010 for $334 million, including the 50-year lease on the Tarcoola–Darwin line.

, the line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs is owned by the Australian Rail Track Corporation and leased until 2047 to Aurizon. The line from Alice Springs to Darwin is owned by Aurizon until 2054, when ownership will pass to the Australian Government and the build–own–operate–and–transfer agreement will end. Aurizon undertakes train control on the entire Tarcoola–Darwin line.

==Traffic==
Two experiential tourism trains operate on the line: &quot;The Ghan&quot; service operated by Journey Beyond, which traverses the whole line and through to Adelaide weekly in each direction, with a scheduled duration of 53  hours 15 minutes; and the company&#x27;s &quot;Indian Pacific&quot;, an east–west service that runs on the southernmost before heading west to Perth.

Aurizon is the only freight operator in the Tarcoola–Darwin section. Trains originate or terminate at intermodal terminals at Berrimah (Darwin) and Islington (Adelaide). They stop at intermodal points in Katherine, Tennant Creek and Alice Springs.

The line has facilitated bulk commodity exports from iron ore and copper mines in central Australia, including Oz Minerals&#x27; Prominent Hill copper mine. Following a derailment event in December 2011, Oz Minerals elected to use the line to export to the south via Port Adelaide.

Figures for Darwin&#x27;s dry bulk exports illustrate the fickle nature of mining. In financial year 2010–11, export product delivered to Port Darwin by rail – comprising iron ore, manganese, and copper concentrate – exceeded 3 million tonnes for the first time. After copper traffic ceased, the figure in 2013–14 for iron and manganese was 2.7 million tonnes. After mining of iron ore ceased in 2015–16, only manganese remained. In 2018–19, manganese exports totalled 900,000 tonnes.

Since 2009 the company has hauled iron oxide / copper / gold ore mined at Prominent Hill from a 1.5 km (0.9 mi) siding at Wirrida, 95 km (60 mi) west of the mine and 129 km (80 mi) from Northgate. In 2012 a new iron ore mine was opened at Peculiar Knob, 22 km (14 mi) from Prominent Hill. Until production ceased in 2015, its product was loaded at Wirrida, at a balloon loop immediately north of the Prominent Hill loading site.

During 2019, the Australian Rail Track Corporation started a large-scale track upgrade program between Adelaide and Tarcoola to allow heavier freight trains to operate at higher speeds. Rails were placed during the year and finishing works such as replacing wooden sleepers with concrete ones were scheduled for 2020.

The original CAR and NAR narrow-gauge lines had many small stations, sidings and halts along their routes for pick-up and set-down of wagons and less-than-car loads, and passengers, but freight traffic has been all-through on the post-2004 standard-gauge route. Stations only exist at Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Katherine and Darwin. Additionally there are crossing loops, most of them long: 12 south of Alice Springs and 3 to the north.

<doc id="434320" wikidata="Q309946" url="?curid=434320" title="Sigebert I">
<text>Sigebert I ( 535 – 575) was a Frankish king of Austrasia from the death of his father in 561 to his own death. He was the third surviving son out of four of Clotaire I and Ingund. His reign found him mostly occupied with a successful civil war against his half-brother, Chilperic.

When Clotaire I died in 561, his kingdom was divided, in accordance with Frankish custom, among his four sons: Sigebert became king of the northeastern portion, known as Austrasia, with its capital at Rheims, to which he added further territory on the death of his brother, Charibert I, in 567 or 568; Charibert himself had received the kingdom centred on Paris; Guntram received the Kingdom of Burgundy with its capital at Orléans; and the youngest son, the aforementioned Chilperic, received Soissons, which became Neustria when he received his share of Charibert&#x27;s kingdom. Incursions by the Avars, a fierce nomadic tribe related to the Huns, caused Sigebert to move his capital from Rheims to Metz. He repelled their attacks twice, in 562 and c. 568. He was defeated and captured by Huns(Avars), but at the end he made peace with them. 

About 567, he married Brunhilda, daughter of the Visigothic king Athanagild. According to Gregory of Tours:

: Now when king Sigebert saw that his brothers were taking wives unworthy of them, and to their disgrace were actually marrying slave women, he sent an embassy into Spain and with many gifts asked for Brunhilda, daughter of king Athanagild. She was a maiden beautiful in her person, lovely to look at, virtuous and well-behaved, with good sense and a pleasant address. Her father did not refuse, but sent her to the king I have named with great treasures. And the king collected his chief men, made ready a feast, and took her as his wife amid great joy and mirth. And though she was a follower of the Arian law she was converted by the preaching of the bishops and the admonition of the king himself, and she confessed the blessed Trinity in unity, and believed and was baptized. And she still remains catholic in Christ&#x27;s name.
Upon seeing this, his brother Chilperic sent to Athanagild for his other daughter&#x27;s hand. This daughter, Galswintha, was given him and he abandoned his other wives. However, he soon tired of her and had her murdered in order to marry his mistress Fredegund. Probably spurred by his wife Brunhilda&#x27;s anger at her sister&#x27;s murder, Sigebert sought revenge. The two brothers had already been at war, but their hostility now elevated into a long and bitter war that was continued by the descendants of both.

In 573, Sigebert took possession of Poitiers and Touraine, and conquered most of his kingdom. Chilperic then hid in Tournai. But at Sigebert&#x27;s moment of triumph, when he had just been declared king by Chilperic&#x27;s subjects at Vitry-en-Artois, he was struck down by two assassins working for Fredegund.

He was succeeded by his son Childebert under the regency of Brunhilda. Brunhilda and Childebert quickly put themselves under the protection of Guntram, who eventually adopted Childebert as his own son and heir. With Brunhilda he had two daughters: Ingund and Chlodosind.

<text>Athanagild ( 517 – December 567) was the Visigothic king of Hispania and Septimania. He had rebelled against his predecessor, Agila I, in 551. The armies of Agila and Athanagild met at Seville, where Agila met a second defeat. Following the death of Agila in 554, he was sole ruler for the rest of his reign.

Roger Collins writes that Athanagild&#x27;s reign &quot;is perhaps more significant than our sources may care to let us believe.&quot; Collins argues that the account of Isidore of Seville may be colored by the hostility subsequent Visigothic kings had towards Athanagild and his descendants.

== The Roman invasion ==
During the conflict between the two, a Roman force sent by Justinian seized control of a large portion of Hispania Baetica (Andalusia). The pretext for their arrival is unclear. Peter Heather states that Jordanes implies that Agila had summoned them. Isidore of Seville offers two conflicting stories: in the section on Agila, the Goths surrounding him killed him out of fear &quot;that Roman soldiers might invade Spain on the pretext of giving help&quot;; while in the following section Isidore states Athanagild had asked Justinian for his help, but once they arrived in Spain &quot;he was unable to remove them from the territory of the kingdom despite his efforts.&quot; Collins notes that &quot;in both of the emperor Justinian&#x27;s other western interventions, Africa in 533 and Italy in 535, he came in ostensibly to uphold the rights of legitimate monarchs against usurpers&quot;, thus agreeing with Jordanes&#x27; version of the events.

Although Athanagild recovered a few cities, the Romans held most of their conquest, which was organized as the province of Spania, long after the end of his reign. It is unclear the exact area this province covered. J. B. Bury states that it &quot;comprised districts and towns to the west as well as to the east of the Straits of Gades&quot; and included the cities of New Carthage (Cartagena), Corduba (Córdoba), and Assidonia. Peter Heather, while agreeing it included New Carthage and Assionia, is dubious about Corduba, and is certain Málaga, and Sagontia were included. Collins agrees that Corduba did not come under Roman control, nor did the Guadalquivir valley, stating that their principal strongholds were Medina Sidonia, Málaga and New Carthage.

Athanagild died of natural causes in Toledo, according to Isidore, then, after an interregnum of five months, Liuva I became king.

== Dynastic alliances ==
His queen, Goiswintha, gave him two daughters — Brunhilda and the murdered Galswintha — who were married to two Merovingian brother-kings: Sigebert I of Austrasia and Chilperic, king of the Neustrian Franks. Although Gregory of Tours states the reasons for this were that Sigebert disdained the prevalent practice of &quot;taking wives who were completely unworthy of them&quot;, and sought the beautiful and cultured Brunhilda, while Chilperic married her sister out of sibling rivalry, Ian Wood points out that the circumstances and the scale of the &quot;morgengab&quot; suggest that the situation was more complex. &quot;Athanagild had no sons. By marrying two daughters to Frankish kings, he may have intended to involve the Merovingians in the Visigothic succession. Perhaps he hoped that the marriages would produce grandsons who could succeed him.&quot;

However Athanagild&#x27;s death in 567 altered the situation. Wood speculates that the date of Galswintha&#x27;s murder followed soon after his death. Brunhilda avoided her sister&#x27;s fate, and became a central figure of Frankish history for the remainder of the sixth century. Lastly, Goiswintha survived the upheaval that followed Athangild&#x27;s death, and became the second wife of Liuvigild, the brother of Athangild&#x27;s successor Liuva, and himself a future king of the Visigoths.

<text>Hydrogeology (&quot;hydro-&quot; meaning water, and &quot;-geology&quot; meaning the study of the Earth) is the area of geology that deals with the distribution and movement of groundwater in the soil and rocks of the Earth&#x27;s crust (commonly in aquifers). The terms groundwater hydrology, geohydrology, and hydrogeology are often used interchangeably, though hydrogeology is the most commonly used.

Hydrogeology is the study of the laws governing the movement of subterranean water, the mechanical, chemical, and thermal interaction of this water with the porous solid, and the transport of energy, chemical constituents, and particulate matter by flow (Domenico and Schwartz, 1998).

Groundwater engineering, another name for hydrogeology, is a branch of engineering which is concerned with groundwater movement and design of wells, pumps, and drains. The main concerns in groundwater engineering include groundwater contamination, conservation of supplies, and water quality.

Wells are constructed for use in developing nations, as well as for use in developed nations in places which are not connected to a city water system. Wells are designed and maintained to uphold the integrity of the aquifer, and to prevent contaminants from reaching the groundwater. Controversy arises in the use of groundwater when its usage impacts surface water systems, or when human activity threatens the integrity of the local aquifer system.

== Introduction ==
Hydrogeology is an interdisciplinary subject; it can be difficult to account fully for the chemical, physical, biological, and even legal interactions between soil, water, nature, and society. The study of the interaction between groundwater movement and geology can be quite complex. Groundwater does not always follow the surface topography; groundwater follows pressure gradients (flow from high pressure to low), often through fractures and conduits in circuitous paths. Taking into account the interplay of the different facets of a multi-component system often requires knowledge in several diverse fields at both the experimental and theoretical levels. The following is a more traditional introduction to the methods and nomenclature of saturated subsurface hydrology.

== Hydrogeology in relation to other fields ==

Hydrogeology, as stated above, is a branch of the earth sciences dealing with the flow of water through the subsurface, typically porous or fractured geological material. The very shallow flow of water in the subsurface (the upper 3 m) is pertinent to the fields of soil science, agriculture, and civil engineering, as well as to hydrogeology. The general flow of fluids (water, hydrocarbons, geothermal fluids, etc.) in deeper formations is also a concern of geologists, geophysicists, and petroleum geologists. Groundwater is generally slow-moving; many of the empirically derived laws of groundwater flow can be alternately derived in fluid mechanics from the special case of Stokes flow (viscosity and pressure terms, but no inertial term).

The mathematical relationships used to describe the flow of water through porous media are Darcy&#x27;s law, the diffusion, and Laplace equations, which have applications in many diverse fields. Steady groundwater flow (Laplace equation) has been simulated using electrical, elastic, and heat conduction analogies. Transient groundwater flow is analogous to the diffusion of heat in a solid, therefore some solutions to hydrological problems have been adapted from heat transfer literature.

Traditionally, the movement of groundwater has been studied separately from surface water, climatology, and even the chemical and microbiological aspects of hydrogeology. As the field of hydrogeology has matured, the interactions between groundwater, surface water, water chemistry, soil moisture, and even climate have become clearer.

California and Washington both require special certification of hydrogeologists to offer professional services to the public. Twenty-nine states require professional licensing for geologists to offer their services to the public, which often includes work within the domains of developing, managing, and/or remediating groundwater resources.

For example: aquifer drawdown or overdrafting and the pumping of fossil water may be a contributing factor to sea-level rise.

== Subjects ==

One of the main tasks a hydrogeologist typically performs is the prediction of future behavior of an aquifer system, based on analysis of past and present observations. Some hypothetical, but characteristic questions asked would be:
*Can the aquifer support another subdivision?
*Will the river dry up if the farmer doubles his irrigation?
*Did the chemicals from the dry cleaning facility travel through the aquifer to my well and make me sick?
*Will the plume of effluent leaving my neighbor&#x27;s septic system flow to my drinking water well?

Most of these questions can be addressed through simulation of the hydrologic system (using numerical models or analytic equations). Accurate simulation of the aquifer system requires knowledge of the aquifer properties and boundary conditions. Therefore, a common task of the hydrogeologist is determining aquifer properties using aquifer tests.

In order to further characterize aquifers and aquitards some primary and derived physical properties are introduced below. Aquifers are broadly classified as being either confined or unconfined (water table aquifers); the type of aquifer affects what properties control the flow of water in that medium (e.g., the release of water from storage for confined aquifers is related to the storativity, while it is related to the specific yield for unconfined aquifers).

=== Aquifers ===
An aquifer A water-bearing layer of rock, or of unconsolidated sediments, that will yield water in a usable quantity to a well or spring. Aquifers can be unconfined, where the top of the aquifer is defined by the water table, or confined, where the aquifer exists underneath a confining bed.

There are three aspects that control the nature of aquifers: stratigraphy, lithology, and geological formations and deposits. The stratigraphy relates the age and geometry of the many formations that compose the aquifer. The lithology refers to the physical components of an aquifer, such as the mineral composition and grain size. The structural features are the elements that arise due to deformations after deposition, such as fractures and folds. Understanding these aspects is paramount to understanding of how an aquifer is formed and how professionals can utilize it for groundwater engineering.

=== Hydraulic head ===
Differences in hydraulic head (&quot;h&quot;) cause water to move from one place to another; water flows from locations of high h to locations of low h. Hydraulic head is composed of pressure head (&quot;ψ&quot;) and elevation head (&quot;z&quot;). The head gradient is the change in hydraulic head per length of flowpath, and appears in Darcy&#x27;s law as being proportional to the discharge.

Hydraulic head is a directly measurable property that can take on any value (because of the arbitrary datum involved in the &quot;z&quot; term); &quot;ψ&quot; can be measured with a pressure transducer (this value can be negative, e.g., suction, but is positive in saturated aquifers), and &quot;z&quot; can be measured relative to a surveyed datum (typically the top of the well casing). Commonly, in wells tapping unconfined aquifers the water level in a well is used as a proxy for hydraulic head, assuming there is no vertical gradient of pressure. Often only &quot;changes&quot; in hydraulic head through time are needed, so the constant elevation head term can be left out (&quot;Δh = Δψ&quot;).

A record of hydraulic head through time at a well is a hydrograph or, the changes in hydraulic head recorded during the pumping of a well in a test are called drawdown.

=== Porosity ===

Porosity (&quot;n&quot;) is a directly measurable aquifer property; it is a fraction between 0 and 1 indicating the amount of pore space between unconsolidated soil particles or within a fractured rock. Typically, the majority of groundwater (and anything dissolved in it) moves through the porosity available to flow (sometimes called effective porosity). Permeability is an expression of the connectedness of the pores. For instance, an unfractured rock unit may have a high &quot;porosity&quot; (it has many &quot;holes&quot; between its constituent grains), but a low &quot;permeability&quot; (none of the pores are connected). An example of this phenomenon is pumice, which, when in its unfractured state, can make a poor aquifer.

Porosity does not directly affect the distribution of hydraulic head in an aquifer, but it has a very strong effect on the migration of dissolved contaminants, since it affects groundwater flow velocities through an inversely proportional relationship.

Darcy&#x27;s law is commonly applied to study the movement of water, or other fluids through porous media, and constitutes the basis for many hydrogeological analyses.

=== Water content ===
Water content (&quot;θ&quot;) is also a directly measurable property; it is the fraction of the total rock which is filled with liquid water. This is also a fraction between 0 and 1, but it must also be less than or equal to the total porosity.

The water content is very important in vadose zone hydrology, where the hydraulic conductivity is a strongly nonlinear function of water content; this complicates the solution of the unsaturated groundwater flow equation.

=== Hydraulic conductivity ===
Hydraulic conductivity (&quot;K&quot;) is the ease with which a fluid (usually water) can move through the pore space, or fracture network. Transmissivity is the product of hydraulic conductivity and the aquifer thickness (typically used as an indication of the ability of an aquifer to deliver water to a well).

=== Specific storage and specific yield ===


Specific storage (&quot;Ss&quot;) and its depth-integrated equivalent, storativity (&quot;S=Ssb&quot;), are indirect aquifer properties (they cannot be measured directly); they indicate the amount of groundwater released from storage due to a unit depressurization of a confined aquifer. They are fractions between 0 and 1.

Specific yield (&quot;Sy&quot;) is also a ratio between 0 and 1 (&quot;Sy&quot; ≤ porosity) and indicates the amount of water released due to drainage from lowering the water table in an unconfined aquifer. The value for specific yield is less than the value for porosity because some water will remain in the medium even after drainage due to intermolecular forces. Often the porosity or effective porosity is used as an upper bound to the specific yield. Typically &quot;Sy&quot; is orders of magnitude larger than &quot;Ss&quot;.

=== Fault zone hydrogeology ===

Fault zone hydrogeology is the study of how brittlely deformed rocks alter fluid flows in different lithological settings, such as clastic, igneous and carbonate rocks. Fluid movements, that can be quantified as permeability, can be facilitated or impeded due to the existence of a fault zone. This is because different mechanism and deformed rocks can alter the porosity and hence the permeability within fault zone. Fluids involved generally are groundwater (fresh and marine waters) and hydrocarbons (Oil and Gas). As fault zone is a zone of weakness that helps to increase the weathered zone thickness and hence the help in ground water recharge. Along with faults, fractures and foliations also facilitate the groundwater mainly in hard rock terrains.

=== Contaminant transport properties ===

Often we are interested in how the moving groundwater will transport dissolved contaminants around (the sub-field of contaminant hydrogeology). The contaminants which are man-made (e.g., petroleum products, nitrate, chromium or radionuclides) or naturally occurring (e.g., arsenic, salinity), can be transported through three main mechanisms, advection (transport along the main direction of flow at seepage velocity), diffusion (migration of the contaminant from high to low concentration areas), and hydrodynamic dispersion (due to microscale heterogeneities present in the porous medium and non-uniform velocity distribution relative to seepage velocity). Besides needing to understand where the groundwater is flowing, based on the other hydrologic properties discussed above, there are additional aquifer properties which affect how dissolved contaminants move with groundwater.

==== Hydrodynamic dispersion ====
Hydrodynamic dispersivity (αL, αT) is an empirical factor which quantifies how much contaminants stray away from the path of the groundwater which is carrying it. Some of the contaminants will be &quot;behind&quot; or &quot;ahead&quot; the mean groundwater, giving rise to a longitudinal dispersivity (αL), and some will be &quot;to the sides of&quot; the pure advective groundwater flow, leading to a transverse dispersivity (αT). Dispersion in groundwater arises because each water &quot;particle&quot;, passing beyond a soil particle, must choose where to go, whether left or right or up or down, so that the water &quot;particles&quot; (and their solute) are gradually spread in all directions around the mean path. This is the &quot;microscopic&quot; mechanism, on the scale of soil particles. More important, over long distances, can be the macroscopic inhomogeneities of the aquifer, which can have regions of larger or smaller permeability, so that some water can find a preferential path in one direction, some other in a different direction, so that the contaminant can be spread in a completely irregular way, like in a (three-dimensional) delta of a river.

Dispersivity is actually a factor which represents our &quot;lack of information&quot; about the system we are simulating. There are many small details about the aquifer which are effectively averaged when using a macroscopic approach (e.g., tiny beds of gravel and clay in sand aquifers); these manifest themselves as an &quot;apparent&quot; dispersivity. Because of this, α is often claimed to be dependent on the length scale of the problem — the dispersivity found for transport through 1 m3 of aquifer is different from that for transport through 1 cm3 of the same aquifer material.

==== Molecular diffusion ====

Diffusion is a fundamental physical phenomenon, which Albert Einstein characterized as Brownian motion, that describes the random thermal movement of molecules and small particles in gases and liquids. It is an important phenomenon for small distances (it is essential for the achievement of thermodynamic equilibria), but, as the time necessary to cover a distance by diffusion is proportional to the square of the distance itself, it is less effective for spreading a solute over macroscopic distances on a short time scale. The diffusion coefficient, , is typically quite small, and its effect can often be neglected (unless groundwater flow velocities are extremely low, as they are in clay aquitards).

It is important not to confuse diffusion with dispersion, as the former is a physical phenomenon and the latter is an empirical hydrodynamic factor which is cast into a similar form as diffusion, because its a convenient way to mathematically describe and solve the question.

==== Retardation by adsorption ====
The retardation factor is another very important feature that make the motion of the contaminant to deviate from the average groundwater motion. It is analogous to the retardation factor of chromatography. Unlike diffusion and dispersion, which simply spread the contaminant, the retardation factor changes its &quot;global average velocity&quot;, so that it can be much slower than that of water. This is due to a chemico-physical effect: the adsorption to the soil, which holds the contaminant back and does not allow it to progress until the quantity corresponding to the chemical adsorption equilibrium has been adsorbed. This effect is particularly important for less soluble contaminants, which thus can move even hundreds or thousands times slower than water. The effect of this phenomenon is that only more soluble species can cover long distances. The retardation factor depends on the chemical nature of both the contaminant and the aquifer.

==History and development==
===Henry Darcy: 19th century===
Henry Darcy was a French scientist who made advances in flow of fluids through porous materials. He conducted experiments which studied the movement of fluids through sand columns. These experiments led to the determination of Darcy&#x27;s law, which describes fluid flow through a medium with high levels of porosity. Darcy&#x27;s work is considered to be the beginning of quantitative hydrogeology.

===Oscar Edward Meinzer: 20th century===
Oscar Edward Meinzer was an American scientist who is often called the &quot;father of modern groundwater hydrology&quot;. He standardized key terms in the field as well as determined principles regarding occurrence, movement, and discharge. He proved that the flow of water obeys Darcy&#x27;s law. He also proposed the use of geophysical methods and recorders on wells, as well as suggested pumping tests to gather quantitative information on the properties of aquifers. Meinzer also highlighted the importance of studying the geochemistry of water, as well as the impact of high salinity levels in aquifers.

== Governing equations ==

=== Darcy&#x27;s law ===
Darcy&#x27;s law is a constitutive equation, empirically derived by Henry Darcy in 1856, which states that the amount of groundwater discharging through a given portion of aquifer is proportional to the cross-sectional area of flow, the hydraulic gradient, and the hydraulic conductivity.

=== Groundwater flow equation ===

The groundwater flow equation, in its most general form, describes the movement of groundwater in a porous medium (aquifers and aquitards). It is known in mathematics as the diffusion equation, and has many analogs in other fields. Many solutions for groundwater flow problems were borrowed or adapted from existing heat transfer solutions.

It is often derived from a physical basis using Darcy&#x27;s law and a conservation of mass for a small control volume. The equation is often used to predict flow to wells, which have radial symmetry, so the flow equation is commonly solved in polar or cylindrical coordinates.

The Theis equation is one of the most commonly used and fundamental solutions to the groundwater flow equation; it can be used to predict the transient evolution of head due to the effects of pumping one or a number of pumping wells.

The Thiem equation is a solution to the steady state groundwater flow equation (Laplace&#x27;s Equation) for flow to a well. Unless there are large sources of water nearby (a river or lake), true steady-state is rarely achieved in reality.

Both above equations are used in aquifer tests (pump tests).

The Hooghoudt equation is a groundwater flow equation applied to subsurface drainage by pipes, tile drains or ditches. An alternative subsurface drainage method is drainage by wells for which groundwater flow equations are also available.

== Calculation of groundwater flow ==
To use the groundwater flow equation to estimate the distribution of hydraulic heads,
or the direction and rate of groundwater flow, this partial differential equation (PDE) must be solved. The most common means of analytically solving the diffusion equation in the hydrogeology literature are:

* Laplace, Hankel and Fourier transforms (to reduce the number of dimensions of the PDE),
* similarity transform (also called the Boltzmann transform) is commonly how the Theis solution is derived,
* separation of variables, which is more useful for non-Cartesian coordinates, and
* Green&#x27;s functions, which is another common method for deriving the Theis solution — from the fundamental solution to the diffusion equation in free space.

No matter which method we use to solve the groundwater flow equation, we need both initial conditions
(heads at time (&quot;t&quot;) = 0) and boundary conditions (representing either the physical
boundaries of the domain, or an approximation of the domain beyond that
point). Often the initial conditions are supplied to a transient
simulation, by a corresponding steady-state simulation (where the time
derivative in the groundwater flow equation is set equal to 0).

There are two broad categories of how the (PDE) would be solved; either
analytical methods, numerical methods, or something possibly in between. Typically, analytic methods solve the groundwater flow equation under a simplified set of conditions &quot;exactly&quot;, while numerical methods solve it under more general conditions to an &quot;approximation&quot;.

=== Analytic methods ===
Analytic methods typically use the structure of mathematics to arrive at a simple, elegant solution, but the required derivation for all but the simplest domain geometries can be quite complex (involving non-standard coordinates, conformal mapping, etc.). Analytic solutions typically are also simply an equation that can give a quick answer based on a few basic parameters. The Theis equation is a simple (yet still very useful) analytic solution to groundwater flow and level around pumping or injecting wells, typically used to analyze the results of an aquifer test or slug test.

=== Numerical methods ===
The topic of numerical methods is quite large, obviously being of use to most fields of engineering and science in general. Numerical methods have been around much longer than computers have (In the 1920s Richardson developed some of the finite difference schemes still in use today, but they were calculated by hand, using paper and pencil, by human &quot;calculators&quot;), but they have become very important through the availability of fast and cheap personal computers. A quick survey of the main numerical methods used in hydrogeology, and some of the most basic principles are shown below and further discussed in the Groundwater model article.

There are two broad categories of numerical methods: gridded or discretized methods and non-gridded or mesh-free methods. In the common finite difference method and finite element method (FEM) the domain is completely gridded (&quot;cut&quot; into a grid or mesh of small elements). The analytic element method (AEM) and the boundary integral equation method (BIEM — sometimes also called BEM, or Boundary Element Method) are only discretized at boundaries or along flow elements (line sinks, area sources, etc.), the majority of the domain is mesh-free.

==== General properties of gridded methods ====
Gridded Methods like finite difference and finite element methods solve the groundwater flow equation by breaking the problem area (domain) into many small elements (squares, rectangles, triangles, blocks, tetrahedra, etc.) and solving the flow equation for each element (all material properties are assumed constant or possibly linearly variable within an element), then linking together all the elements using conservation of mass across the boundaries between the elements (similar to the divergence theorem). This results in a system which overall approximates the groundwater flow equation, but exactly matches the boundary conditions (the head or flux is specified in the elements which intersect the boundaries).

Finite differences are a way of representing continuous differential operators using discrete intervals (&quot;Δx&quot; and &quot;Δt&quot;), and the finite difference methods are based on these (they are derived from a Taylor series). For example, the first-order time derivative is often approximated using the following forward finite difference, where the subscripts indicate a discrete time location,

: formula_1

The forward finite difference approximation is unconditionally stable, but leads to an implicit set of equations (that must be solved using matrix methods, e.g. LU or Cholesky decomposition). The similar backwards difference is only conditionally stable, but it is explicit and can be used to &quot;march&quot; forward in the time direction, solving one grid node at a time (or possibly in parallel, since one node depends only on its immediate neighbors). Rather than the finite difference method, sometimes the Galerkin FEM approximation is used in space (this is different from the type of FEM often used in structural engineering) with finite differences still used in time.

==== Application of finite difference models ====
MODFLOW is a well-known example of a general finite difference groundwater flow model. It is developed by the US Geological Survey as a modular and extensible simulation tool for modeling groundwater flow. It is free software developed, documented and distributed by the USGS. Many commercial products have grown up around it, providing graphical user interfaces to its input file based interface, and typically incorporating pre- and post-processing of user data. Many other models have been developed to work with MODFLOW input and output, making linked models which simulate several hydrologic processes possible (flow and transport models, surface water and groundwater models and chemical reaction models), because of the simple, well documented nature of MODFLOW.

==== Application of finite element models ====
Finite Element programs are more flexible in design (triangular elements vs. the block elements most finite difference models use) and there are some programs available (SUTRA, a 2D or 3D density-dependent flow model by the USGS; Hydrus, a commercial unsaturated flow model; FEFLOW, a commercial modelling environment for subsurface flow, solute and heat transport processes; OpenGeoSys, a scientific open-source project for thermo-hydro-mechanical-chemical (THMC) processes in porous and fractured media; COMSOL Multiphysics (a commercial general modelling environment), FEATool Multiphysics an easy to use MATLAB simulation toolbox, and Integrated Water Flow Model (IWFM), but they are still not as popular in with practicing hydrogeologists as MODFLOW is. Finite element models are more popular in university and laboratory environments, where specialized models solve non-standard forms of the flow equation (unsaturated flow, density dependent flow, coupled heat and groundwater flow, etc.).

==== Application of finite volume models ====
The finite volume method is a method for representing and evaluating partial differential equations as algebraic equations. Similar to the finite difference method, values are calculated at discrete places on a meshed geometry. &quot;Finite volume&quot; refers to the small volume surrounding each node point on a mesh. In the finite volume method, volume integrals in a partial differential equation that contain a divergence term are converted to surface integrals, using the divergence theorem. These terms are then evaluated as fluxes at the surfaces of each finite volume. Because the flux entering a given volume is identical to that leaving the adjacent volume, these methods are conservative. Another advantage of the finite volume method is that it is easily formulated to allow for unstructured meshes. The method is used in many computational fluid dynamics packages.

PORFLOW software package is a comprehensive mathematical model for simulation of Ground Water Flow and Nuclear Waste Management developed by Analytic &amp; Computational Research, Inc., ACRi.

The FEHM software package is available free from Los Alamos National Laboratory. This versatile porous flow simulator includes capabilities to model multiphase, thermal, stress, and multicomponent reactive chemistry. Current work using this code includes simulation of methane hydrate formation, CO2 sequestration, oil shale extraction, migration of both nuclear and chemical contaminants, environmental isotope migration in the unsaturated zone, and karst formation.

==== Other methods ====
These include mesh-free methods like the Analytic Element Method (AEM) and the Boundary Element Method (BEM), which are closer to analytic solutions, but they do approximate the groundwater flow equation in some way. The BEM and AEM exactly solve the groundwater flow equation (perfect mass balance), while approximating the boundary conditions. These methods are more exact and can be much more elegant solutions (like analytic methods are), but have not seen as widespread use outside academic and research groups yet.

==Water wells==
A water well is a mechanism for bringing groundwater to the surface by drilling or digging and bringing it up to the surface with a pump or by hand using buckets or similar devices. The first historical instance of water wells was in the 52nd century BC in modern-day Austria. Today, wells are used all over the world, from developing nations to suburbs in the United States.

There are three main types of wells, shallow, deep, and artesian. Shallow wells tap into unconfined aquifers, and are, generally, shallow, less than 15 meters deep. Shallow wells have a small diameter, usually less than 15 centimeters. Deep wells access confined aquifers, and are always drilled by machine. All deep wells bring water to the surface using mechanical pumps. In artesian wells, water flows naturally without the use of a pump or some other mechanical device. This is due to the top of the well being located below the water table.

===Water well design and construction===

One of the most important aspects of groundwater engineering and hydrogeology is water well design and construction. Proper well design and construction are important to maintain the health of the groundwater and the people which will use the well. Factors which must be considered in well design are:
* A reliable aquifer, providing a continuous water supply
* The quality of the accessible groundwater
* How to monitor the well
* Operating costs of the well
* Expected yield of the well
* Any prior drilling into the aquifer

There are five main areas to be considered when planning and constructing a new water well, along with the factors above. They are:
* Aquifer Suitability
* &quot;Well Design Considerations
* Well Drilling Methods
* Well Screen Design and Development
* Well Testing&quot;

Aquifer suitability starts with determining possible locations for the well using &quot;USGS reports, well logs, and cross sections&quot; of the aquifer. This information should be used to determine aquifer properties such as depth, thickness, transmissivity, and well yield. In this stage, the quality of the water in the aquifer should also be determined, and screening should occur to check for contaminants.

After factors such as depth and well yield are determined, the well design and drilling approach must be established. Drilling method is selected based on &quot;soil conditions, well depth, design, and costs.&quot; At this stage, cost estimates are prepared, and plans are adjusted to meet budgetary needs.

Important parts of a well include the well seals, casings or liners, drive shoes, well screen assemblies, and a sand or gravel pack (optional). Each of these components ensures that the well only draws from one aquifer, and no leakage occurs at any stage of the process.

There are several methods of drilling which can be used when constructing a water well. They include: &quot;Cable tool, Air rotary, Mud rotary, and Flooded reverse circulation dual rotary&quot; drilling techniques. Cable tool drilling is inexpensive and can be used for all types of wells, but the alignment must be constantly checked and it has a slow advance rate. It is not an effective drilling technique for consolidated formations, but does provide a small drilling footprint. Air rotary drilling is cost effective and works well for consolidated formations. It has a fast advance rate, but is not adequate for large diameter wells. Mud rotary drilling is especially cost effective for deep wells. It maintains good alignment, but requires a larger footprint. It has a very fast advance rate. Flooded reverse circulation dual rotary drilling is more expensive, but good for large well designs. It is versatile and maintains alignment. It has a fast advance rate.

Well screens ensure that only water makes it to the surface, and sediments remain beneath the Earth&#x27;s surface. Screens are placed along the shaft of the well to filter out sediment as water is pumped towards the surface. Screen design can be impacted by the nature of the soil, and natural pack designs can be used to maximize efficiency.

After construction of the well, testing must be done to assess productivity, efficiency and yield of the well, as well as determine the impacts of the well on the aquifer. Several different tests should be completed on the well in order to test all relevant qualities of the well.

== Issues in groundwater engineering and hydrogeology ==

===Contamination===

Groundwater contamination happens when other fluids seep into the aquifer and mix with existing groundwater. Pesticides, fertilizers, and gasoline are common contaminants of aquifers. Underground storage tanks for chemicals such as gasoline are especially concerning sources of groundwater contamination. As these tanks corrode, they can leak, and their contents can contaminate nearby groundwater. For buildings which are not connected to a wastewater treatment system, septic tanks can be used to dispose of waste at a safe rate. If septic tanks are not built or maintained properly, they can leak bacteria, viruses and other chemicals into the surrounding groundwater. Landfills are another potential source of groundwater contamination. As trash is buried, harmful chemicals can migrate from the garbage and into the surrounding groundwater if the protective base layer is cracked or otherwise damaged. Other chemicals, such as road salts and chemicals used on lawns and farms, can runoff into local reservoirs, and eventually into aquifers. As water goes through the water cycle, contaminants in the atmosphere can contaminate the water. This water can also make its way into groundwater.

=== Controversy ===
====Fracking====
Contamination of groundwater due to fracking has long been debated. Since chemicals commonly used in hydraulic fracturing are not tested by government agencies responsible for determining the effects of fracking on groundwater, laboratories at the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, have a hard time determining if chemicals used in fracking are present in nearby aquifers. In 2016, the EPA released a report which states that drinking water can be contaminated by fracking. This was a reversal of their previous policies after a $29 million study into the effects of fracking on local drinking water.

==== California ====
California sees some of the largest controversies in groundwater usage due to the dry conditions California faces, high population, and intensive agriculture. Conflicts generally occur over pumping groundwater and shipping it out of the area, unfair use of water by a commercial company, and contamination of groundwater by development projects. In Siskiyou County in northern California, the California Superior Court ruled poor groundwater regulations have allowed pumping to diminish the flows in the Scott River and disturbed the natural habitat of salmon. In Owens Valley in central California, groundwater was pumped for use in fish farms, which resulted in the death of local meadows and other ecosystems. This resulted in a lawsuit and settlement against the fish companies. Development in southern California is threatening local aquifers, contaminating groundwater through construction and normal human activity. For example, a solar project in San Bernardino County would allegedly threaten the ecosystem of bird and wildlife species because of its use of up to 1.3 million cubic meters of groundwater, which could impact Harper Lake. In September 2014, California passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act, which requires users to manage groundwater appropriately, as it is connected to surface water systems.

====Colorado====
Due to its arid climate, the state of Colorado gets most of its water from underground. Because of this, there have been issues regarding groundwater engineering practices. As many as 65,000 people were affected when high levels of PFCs were found in the Widefield Aquifer. Groundwater use in Colorado dates back to before the 20th century. Nineteen of Colorado&#x27;s 63 counties depend mostly on groundwater for supplies and domestic uses. The Colorado Geological Survey has three significant reports on groundwater in the Denver Basin. The first report Geology of Upper Cretaceous, Paleocene and Eocene Strata in the Southwestern Denver Basin, The second report Bedrock Geology, Structure, and Isopach Maps of the Upper Cretaceous to Paleogene Strata between Greeley and Colorado Springs, The third publication Cross Sections of the Freshwater Bearing Strata of the Denver Basin between Greeley and Colorado Springs.

==New trends in groundwater engineering/hydrogeology==
Since the first wells were made thousands of years ago, groundwater systems have been changed by human activity. 50 years ago, the sustainability of these systems on a larger scale began to come into consideration, becoming one of the main focuses of groundwater engineering. New ideas and research are advancing groundwater engineering into the 21st century, while still considering groundwater conservation.

===Topographical mapping===
New advancements have arisen in topographical mapping to improve sustainability. Topographic mapping has been updated to include radar, which can penetrate the ground to help pinpoint areas of concern. In addition, large computations can use gathered data from maps to further the knowledge of groundwater aquifers in recent years. This has made highly complex and individualized water cycle models possible, which has helped to make groundwater sustainability more applicable to specific situations.

===The role of technology===
Technological improvements have advanced topographical mapping, and have also improved the quality of lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere simulations. These simulations are useful on their own; however, when used together, they help to give an even more accurate prediction of the future sustainability of an area, and what changes can be made to ensure stability in the area. This would not be possible without the advancement of technology. As technology continues to progress, the simulations will increase in accuracy and allow for more complex studies and projects in groundwater engineering.

===Growing populations===
As populations continue to grow, areas which were using groundwater at a sustainable rate are now beginning to face sustainability issues for the future. Populations of the size currently seen in large cities were not taken into consideration when the long term sustainability of aquifers. These large population sizes are beginning to stress groundwater supply. This has led to the need for new policies in some urban areas. These are known as proactive land-use management, where cities can move proactively to conserve groundwater.

In Brazil, overpopulation caused municipally provided water to run low. Due to the shortage of water, people began to drill wells within the range normally served by the municipal water system. This was a solution for people in high socioeconomic standing, but left much of the underprivileged population without access to water. Because of this, a new municipal policy was created which drilled wells to assist those who could not afford to drill wells of their own. Because the city is in charge of drilling the new wells, they can better plan for the future sustainability of the groundwater in the region, by carefully placing the wells and taking growing populations into consideration.

===Dependency on groundwater in the United States===
In the United States, 51% of the drinking water comes from groundwater supplies. Around 99% of the rural population depends on groundwater. In addition, 64% of the total groundwater of the country is used for irrigation, and some of it is used for industrial processes and recharge for lakes and rivers. In 2010, 22 percent of freshwater used in US came from groundwater and the other 78 percent came from surface water. Groundwater is important for some states that don&#x27;t have access to fresh water. most of the fresh groundwater 65 percent is used for irrigation and the 21 percent is used for public purposes drinking mostly.

<doc id="434330" wikidata="Q348416" url="?curid=434330" title="Peter Forsberg">
<text>Peter Mattias Forsberg (; born 20 July 1973) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey player and former assistant general manager of Modo Hockey. Nicknamed &quot;Peter the Great&quot; and &quot;Foppa&quot;, Forsberg was known for his on-ice vision and physical play, and is considered one of the greatest players of all time. Although his career was shortened by persistent injuries, , he stands eighth all-time in career points-per-game and fifth all-time in career assists-per-game in the NHL, behind only Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Bobby Orr, and Connor McDavid. In 2017 Forsberg was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

His 19-year professional career includes 13 years in the National Hockey League (NHL), where he won two Stanley Cups with the Colorado Avalanche, as well as several individual honors including the Hart Memorial Trophy in 2003. As of the end of the 2017–18 season, he is the seventh-highest all-time Swedish point scorer in the NHL regular season. Before his short-lived comeback season in 2011, Forsberg never had a negative plus-minus rating, giving him an overall career rating of +238.

Representing Sweden in international play, Forsberg competed in four Winter Olympics, two World Cups and five World Championships, as well as one European Junior Championship and two World Junior Championships, where he holds a scoring record of 31 points in seven games that some say may never be broken. He won four gold medals with Sweden in his career, winning titles at the 1992 and 1998 World Championships and the 1994 and 2006 Winter Olympics. Combined with his two Stanley Cup championships in NHL play, he is a member of the Triple Gold Club and the only Swede who has won each of the three competitions twice. In 2013, he was inducted to the IIHF Hall of Fame, and in 2014, he was elected into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Peter Forsberg was born in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden, the son of Kent Forsberg, a former coach of Modo Hockey and the Swedish national team. Forsberg was coached by his father for a significant part of his career: the two teamed up from 1991 to 1994 with Modo and later for the national team in the 1996 World Cup, 1998 Olympics and 1998 World Championship, which Sweden won.

Forsberg played minor hockey alongside childhood friend Markus Näslund, who was also born in Örnsköldsvik. Born ten days apart, the two were well-acquainted while playing on separate youth teams before joining on the regional Ångermanland all-star team for the under-16 TV-pucken national championship in 1988. They went on to compete alongside each other at the junior and men&#x27;s level for both Modo Hockey and the Swedish national team. Forsberg and Näslund also attended high school together and had summer jobs at the age of 18 with the same electrical company that employed both Näslund&#x27;s mother and Forsberg&#x27;s father.

Growing up, Forsberg&#x27;s idol was Elitserien and NHL star Håkan Loob.

==Playing career==

===Modo Hockey (1989–1994)===

Forsberg debuted in 1990 with the junior squad of Modo Hockey, the club in his hometown Örnsköldsvik. During the course of the season, he debuted with the senior team in the Elitserien, the highest-level professional ice hockey league in Sweden, and scored an assist in his only game. In 1990–91, he scored 102 points in 39 games with the junior team and 17 points in 23 games with the senior team.

At the end of the season, Forsberg was drafted sixth overall by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft, the first European player taken that year. The draft pick was surprising because Forsberg was expected to be selected later in the draft. &quot;The Hockey News&quot; had ranked Forsberg as the 25th best draft prospect in its 1991 draft preview, saying he was &quot;a solid second rounder who could move into the first.&quot; The pick was criticized by the Philadelphia media, prompting Flyers&#x27; General Manager Russ Farwell and the team&#x27;s chief European scout Inge Hammarström to reply that time would prove them right.

Eric Lindros was the main attraction of the draft. He was drafted first overall by the Quebec Nordiques but refused to sign a contract and, on advice from his mother, began a holdout that lasted over a year. Forsberg was included in a deal that sent five players, two first-round draft picks, and US$15 million to the Quebec Nordiques in exchange for Lindros. In hindsight, the Lindros trade is seen as one of the most one-sided deals in sports history, and the deal became a major foundation for the Nordiques/Avalanche franchise&#x27;s success over the next decade.

Forsberg remained in Sweden, playing for Modo for the following three years. In 1993, the team was eliminated in the playoffs quarterfinals against Malmö, but Forsberg won the Guldpucken for Player of the Year and the Guldhjälmen for Most Valuable Player of the Elitserien, an award decided by the players. He won both prizes again in 1994 when, after barely making the playoffs, he led his team to their first final since winning the Elitserien playoffs in 1979. In a five-game series, again against Malmö, Forsberg scored in overtime in Game 2 to put his team one win away from the title. However, he suffered from the flu (influenza v) and Modo lost the remaining games of the series and the title. By this point, Forsberg was thought to be the best player in the world outside the NHL. After losing the deciding game 3–1, Forsberg expressed his frustration on the ice, first by breaking his stick and then in an interview where he criticised the game&#x27;s referee, Börje Johansson, for giving Malmö many power plays, resulting in their first two goals, and then increasing the tolerance level. Forsberg&#x27;s words that he wanted to give Börje a hit has become popular in Swedish ice hockey areas. Börje later denied calling the game in favor of Malmö and stated that Forsberg hadn&#x27;t given him a hit.

During the summer of 1994, Forsberg decided to play in the NHL after previously signing a contract with the Quebec Nordiques in October 1993. It was a four-year deal worth $6.5 million, including $4.275 million given as a signing bonus. However, a lockout delayed his NHL debut until 1995, and Forsberg returned to Modo to play 11 more games before going back to North America.

===Quebec Nordiques / Colorado Avalanche (1995–2004)===
After the lockout ended, the 1994–95 NHL season began on January 21, 1995. That day, Forsberg made his NHL debut against the Philadelphia Flyers, the team that drafted him, and recorded his first NHL assist. His first NHL goal came six days later against the Buffalo Sabres. His rookie season in the NHL was impressive—Forsberg was able to combine a good offensive performance with responsibility on defence as well as physical play. He scored 50 points (15 goals and 35 assists) in 47 games, including a 14-game run in which he scored 26 points, and was second in scoring on the Nordiques, behind Joe Sakic. He missed only one game, due to the flu. The Nordiques won the Northeast Division and had the second-best record in the league in the regular season, but lost in the first playoff round against the New York Rangers. At the end of the season, Forsberg won the Calder Memorial Trophy for best rookie in the league and was selected to the NHL All-Rookie Team.

On July 1, 1995, it became official that the Nordiques&#x27; owner Marcel Aubut had sold the team to the COMSAT Entertainment Group, which moved the franchise to Denver, Colorado. The franchise was presented as the Colorado Avalanche on 10 August 1995. It turned out Forsberg had scored the last goal in Nordiques history in Game 6 against the Rangers.

Forsberg was on a team that included center and captain Joe Sakic, defenceman Adam Foote and, in the near future, Vezina and Conn Smythe Trophy winner Patrick Roy. In its first year in Denver, the Avalanche won the Stanley Cup after finishing the regular season with the second-best league record and winning the Pacific Division. Forsberg scored 116 points in the regular season (30 goals, 86 assists) and 21 more in the playoffs (10 goals, 11 assists). Forsberg finished second in points on the team and fifth overall in the league in the regular and post-season. During Game 2 of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Florida Panthers, Forsberg became the sixth player in NHL history to score three goals in one period. Not only was the 1995–96 NHL season Forsberg&#x27;s highest-scoring year, but it would also be the only NHL season in which he played in all his team&#x27;s games.

In the 1996–97 season, Forsberg played in only 65 regular-season games and 14 of Colorado&#x27;s 17 playoff games due to a bruised thigh. But he recorded 86 points (28 goals, 58 assists) as Colorado earned its first Presidents&#x27; Trophy and the third consecutive division title for the franchise. On March 16, 1997, Forsberg participated in the only fight of his NHL career against Detroit Red Wings winger Martin Lapointe. The fight occurred 10 days before the famous Red Wings–Avalanche brawl. In the playoffs, Colorado lost in the Conference Finals against Detroit; Forsberg scored 17 points (five goals, 12 assists).

The same year, Forsberg was chosen to be on the cover of &quot;NHL 98&quot;, a video game made by EA Sports.

In 2001, the Avalanche won their second Stanley Cup. After the Avalanche defeated the Los Angeles Kings in the second round of the playoffs, Forsberg had to have his spleen removed and could not play again in the playoffs. Based on doctors&#x27; advice and his overall deteriorated health, he decided to take the following season off to recuperate. He returned for the playoffs, though, and he again led the playoffs in scoring with 27 points, but his team lost to the Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference finals.

2002–03 was a banner year for Forsberg. He centered the highly productive &quot;AMP line&quot; (i.e. Alex, Milan, Peter) with wingers Alex Tanguay and Milan Hejduk as part of the Colorado Avalanche&#x27;s &quot;one-two punch&quot; offensive plan led by centers Forsberg and Joe Sakic. Much healthier and more rested than he had been in the previous few years, he went on to lead the league with 106 points, for which he was awarded the Art Ross Trophy, as well as the Hart Memorial Trophy for league MVP. The Avalanche lost to the Minnesota Wild in the playoffs.

===Philadelphia Flyers (2005–2007)===
Peter Forsberg returned to Modo Hockey during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. He had signed a one-year contract even before the 2004–05 NHL season was confirmed cancelled. Coached by his father and teammates with NHL players Henrik and Daniel Sedin and Markus Näslund, Forsberg played only 33 of Modo&#x27;s 50 regular season games because of surgery after dislocating his left wrist and breaking a bone in his hand. He scored 39 points (13 goals and 26 assists) and tied for eighth in the league scoring race. Modo finished sixth in the regular season and lost in the first round of the playoffs against Färjestad BK in a six-game series in which Forsberg only played one game.

After the season and with the return of the NHL, Forsberg returned to North America. The implementation of a salary cap was a blow to the Colorado Avalanche, one of the highest spenders in the league, and they were forced to let go of Forsberg and Adam Foote to save room in the cap for Joe Sakic and Rob Blake. He refused a four-year, $13.5 million offer from the Avalanche before signing a two-year, $11.5 million contract with the Philadelphia Flyers, the team that drafted Forsberg 14 years earlier.

Before the season started, he had surgery to remove a bursa sac from his right ankle. He debuted with the Flyers on October 5 against the New York Rangers. He registered two assists in his first game and 12 in his first six. Despite playing only 60 games, mostly because of a groin injury, he scored 75 points (19 goals and 56 assists). The Flyers lost in the first round of the playoffs against the Buffalo Sabres.
After the season, he had surgery on his right ankle and foot to correct deformities because of an abnormal arch that caused him to stretch his ankle tendons. He was expected to have the same surgery done on his left foot and be sidelined until January, but a doctor decided he did not need it and he was ready to play by the start of the 2006–07 NHL season. On 14 September 2006, Forsberg became the 15th captain in Flyers history, replacing Derian Hatcher (the interim captain after Keith Primeau retired). The season was troubled for him: while the Flyers were having their worst season ever, Forsberg had not fully recovered from his right foot problems and had doubts about his future.

===Nashville Predators (2007)===
With his contract over at the end of the season and with no commitment on Forsberg&#x27;s part to signing a new contract or to retire, on February 15, shortly before the trade deadline, the Flyers traded him to the Nashville Predators in exchange for Ryan Parent, Scottie Upshall, and Nashville&#x27;s first- and third-round 2007 picks to boost Nashville&#x27;s playoff run. The Predators&#x27; last regular season game was at Colorado, and Forsberg returned to Denver for the first time since leaving the Avalanche. The Predators won and Colorado missed the playoffs as a result. This was the first time the Avalanche failed to make the playoffs since moving to Colorado. The Predators lost in the first round of the playoffs against the San Jose Sharks, with Forsberg scoring four points in the five-game series. Forsberg had an average of less than one point per game in the regular season for the first time in his career and second time in the playoffs.

===Final years and retirement (2007–2011)===
For most of the 2007–08 season, Forsberg was an unrestricted free agent and said that he would not return to the NHL. He had surgery on his foot and was waiting to see if he was in condition to play. He said that in Europe, he would only play for Modo Hockey, and in the NHL he would probably play for one of his former three clubs. On 25 February 2008, Forsberg signed a contract with the Colorado Avalanche for the rest of the 2007–08 season.

Forsberg&#x27;s first game back with the Avalanche was on 4 March 2008, home at the Pepsi Center against the Vancouver Canucks. However, he was sidelined after just three games due to a groin injury. He was listed by the club as day-to-day. On April 1, against Vancouver, he scored his first goal of the season in Colorado&#x27;s penultimate regular-season game.

After coming back from a 10-month break Forsberg was first among all NHL players in points-per-game (PPG) during the 2007–08 regular season. His average of 1.56 PPG in nine games put him ahead of the league&#x27;s top scorer, Alexander Ovechkin, who posted 1.37 PPG, although Ovechkin played all 82 games.
Forsberg played two seasons with Modo from 2008 to 2010, being joined by countryman Markus Näslund in the second year. On 14 August 2010, Forsberg announced he was not optimistic about returning to hockey, hinting he may retire.

On 21 January 2011, it was announced that Forsberg had begun training with the Colorado Avalanche in an attempt to make a comeback in the NHL.

On 6 February, the Avalanche announced that they had come to terms on a contract with Forsberg worth $1 million for the remainder of the 2010–11 season. Forsberg played his first game back with the Avalanche in Nationwide Arena against the Columbus Blue Jackets on 11 February. He was in the starting lineup at left wing, a departure from his natural center, with 2001 Stanley Cup-winning teammate Milan Hejduk, as well as Matt Duchene. In the two road games he played in, Forsberg was on the ice for 17 minutes and 38 seconds, with zero points and a −4 plus-minus rating. The Avalanche lost both games. After the latter game, Avalanche Head Coach Joe Sacco stated Forsberg was the best player on the ice.

The Avalanche, in the midst of a losing season, heavily advertised tickets for Forsberg&#x27;s first home game back as a member of the team. However, on 14 February 2011, hours before he was scheduled to play in front of the Avalanche&#x27;s home fans at the Pepsi Center, Forsberg announced his retirement from hockey. The Avalanche&#x27;s official website stated that Forsberg would hold a press conference later that day, formally announcing his retirement. In the press conference, Forsberg cited an &quot;inability to defend [himself]&quot; on the ice and foot problems as reasons for his decision.

==After retirement==

On 20 April 2011, nearly two weeks after a dramatic but successful end of the 2011 Kvalserien for Modo Hockey, Forsberg was named an assistant general manager of the Modo organization, working under long-time friend Markus Näslund.

On 8 October 2011, Forsberg had his jersey number retired prior to the Avalanche&#x27;s 2011–12 season opener at the Pepsi Center. On 26 February 2015, Forsberg had his number officially retired prior to a Modo game at the Fjällräven Center in his native Örnsköldsvik.

===Business interests===
Forsberg is involved with many business endeavors. He was an early investor in Crocs, and is a partial owner in the airline Nextjet. Forsberg and his father own a Swedish development company named Forspro Company. The company co-funded the Modo Hockey team&#x27;s new Swedbank Arena in Örnsköldsvik. Independently of his father, Forsberg also owned Pforce AB, a company that imported and marketed Crocs shoes in his native Sweden since 2005. On 14 July 2010, he announced he was closing Pforce after taking heavy losses in the previous two years. Forsberg is also interested in harness racing, and owns or has owned a few racing horses during the years, including &quot;Tsar d&#x27; Inverne&quot; and &quot;Adrian Chip&quot;. He has also invested money in a golf course named Veckefjärdens Golf Club in his native Örnsköldsvik.

==International play==






Forsberg competed with Sweden&#x27;s under-18 team at the 1991 European Junior Championships. He led the tournament in scoring with 17 points over six games as Sweden failed to defend their gold medal from the previous year. Moving on to Sweden&#x27;s national under-20 team, he played in his first of two World Junior Championships in 1992. He scored 11 points in seven games as Sweden won the silver medal. Several months later, Forsberg debuted with the Swedish men&#x27;s team at the 1992 World Championships. He recorded a goal and an assist over eight games, helping Sweden to a gold medal.

The following year, he made his second appearance at the 1993 World Junior Championships. Forsberg set a tournament record 24 assists and 31 points over seven games. He earned nearly a third of his points with a ten-point performance against Japan, which set a single-game tournament record. Due to his record-breaking performances at the World Junior Hockey Championship, Forsberg was deemed the best player in World Junior history by TSN, topping players the likes of Pavel Bure, Viacheslav Fetisov, Wayne Gretzky, and Jordan Eberle, who were among the top five players in the vote. In 1994, he led the Swedes to a gold medal in the Winter Olympics, scoring the winning goal of the penalty shootout that decided the gold medal game. Forsberg&#x27;s &quot;one hand, slide in&quot; goal, a move which he borrowed from retired Swedish ice hockey player Kent Nilsson, has become popular in today&#x27;s NHL. An image of Forsberg scoring this goal was later placed on a Swedish postage stamp, making him the first hockey player to be placed on a Swedish stamp. Forsberg&#x27;s famous move on Canadian goaltender Corey Hirsch (who refused to allow his name to be shown on the stamp) has become so iconic in hockey that efforts to reproduce it inevitably draw references to Forsberg from hockey commentators.

Following his second year in the NHL, Forsberg competed in the 1996 World Cup. The competition marked Forsberg&#x27;s first time in best-on-best international play. With five points in four games, Forsberg helped Sweden to a bronze medal.

In October 1997, it was announced that Forsberg would be playing for the Swedish national team in the Karjala Cup, though he was forced to withdraw from the team after just one practice session after experiencing continued problems with his foot. The following year, he competed in the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in the first Olympic competition including NHL players. Forsberg recorded five points over four games as Sweden finished without a medal at fifth place. Several months later, competing in the 1998 World Championships, Sweden won a gold medal. Forsberg had recorded 11 points over seven games.

In November 1999, Forsberg played for Sweden in the Karjala Cup, a tournament that included his 100th game for the Swedish national team against Russia on 7 November. Nearly five years later, he made his fourth World Championships appearance in 2003. He scored nine points in eight games to help Sweden to a silver medal. The following year, he helped Sweden to another silver medal at the 2004 tournament, recording an assist in two games.
Returning to best-on-best competition at the 2004 World Cup, Forsberg recorded three points in four games. Sweden finished in fifth place. Two years later, he won his second Olympic gold, helping Sweden to a championship at the 2006 Games in Turin, Italy. As part of a subsequent interview about the championship over five years later, Forsberg was interpreted to insinuate that Sweden lost their preliminary round game against Slovakia on purpose, so as to draw Switzerland as their quarterfinal opponent, rather than Canada or Russia. Swedish forward Henrik Sedin, who played alongside Forsberg on the 2006 team denied the notion while adding that Forsberg&#x27;s comments in the interview were misconstrued. Forsberg&#x27;s next appearance in international competition came at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia. He was named Sweden&#x27;s flag bearer for the opening ceremonies. Two years removed from NHL competition (Forsberg had been playing in the Elitserien while attempting an NHL comeback), Forsberg played a lesser role with the Swedish team and recorded an assist over four games. Sweden finished in fifth place, failing to defend their 2006 gold medal.

==Style of play==
Peter Forsberg was a superstar forward, with &quot;outstanding&quot; playmaking skills and &quot;great vision&quot; who &quot;possesses an excellent combination of skill and physical play&quot;. In the prime of his career, he was considered by many as the best two-way player in the world. Capable of combining physical play and hitting with skill, he was also acclaimed for being responsible offensively and defensively. Said to have a &quot;Wayne Gretzky-like&quot; passing touch, he has been complimented by journalists and players for making the players around him better. Because of his physicality on the ice, he has been credited with helping to change the perception that Swedish hockey players were not tough.

===Injury proneness===
Forsberg&#x27;s style of play led him to deal with several severe injuries. It has been said in the press that he was injury-prone because he did not soften his game as he got older. In his 14 seasons as an NHL player, Forsberg missed an entire regular season and played in less than 90% of regular-season games in eight other seasons.

The first season in which he missed a significant part was 1996–97. Due to a bruised thigh, Forsberg was out on 14 regular season games and three playoff games. In the off season before the 1999–2000 season, Forsberg underwent shoulder surgery and missed the first 23 games of the season. He missed an extra 10 games due to shoulder injuries, a concussion and a hip pointer. After missing eight games due to a rib injury in the 2000–01 regular season, Forsberg suffered a severe injury in the playoffs. After the last game of the conference semifinal against the Los Angeles Kings on 9 May 2001, he underwent surgery to remove a ruptured spleen and it was announced that he would not play until the following season. In the beginning of the 2001–02 season, he took a leave of absence to heal his injuries. In January 2002, the Colorado Avalanche held a press conference but instead of announcing the expected return of Forsberg, announced that he had been submitted to reconstructive surgery on the peroneal tendons of his left foot (Forsberg would return for the playoffs that season, but foot problems would plague Forsberg for the rest of his career and eventually end it). In 2003–04 season, he missed 43 games: 19 with a groin and abdominal injury

During the lockout, while playing for Modo Hockey, Forsberg had surgery after dislocating his left wrist and breaking a bone in his hand, and because of a bursa sac removal.

==Personal life==
Philanthropically, Forsberg and childhood friend Markus Näslund founded Icebreakers, an organization that brings together professional ice hockey players for exhibition games to raise money for charities.

In late 2010, Forsberg became engaged to fellow Swede Nicole Nordin in Paris.
In June 2012, the couple had their first child, a son. In September 2014, their second child, a daughter, was born. In May 2016 they had their third child. The family resided in Zug, Switzerland from 2018. On May 1, 2023, the couple announced their separation through a post on Peter&#x27;s Instagram account.

<text>Galswintha (540–568) was a queen consort of Neustria. She was the daughter of Athanagild, Visigothic king of Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula, comprising modern Spain and Portugal), and Goiswintha. Galswintha was the sister of Brunhilda—queen consort of Austrasia—and the wife of Chilperic I, the Merovingian king of Neustria. Galswintha was probably murdered at the urging of Chilperic&#x27;s former concubine Fredegund (and then later wife), instigating a 40-year civil war within the Merovingian kingdom.

==History==
Merovingian king, Chilperic I (561–584), ruled over Neustria, which despite being less extensive in total land than that presided over by his brother King Sigebert, was wealthier since the cities of Paris, Tours, and Rouen all fell under its purview. Chilperic sought Galswintha&#x27;s hand in marriage after his brother, King Sigebert, had married the noblewoman, Brunhilda (Galswintha&#x27;s sister), a union that violated the Merovingian tradition of seeking the hand of a lowborn woman instead. Galswintha—daughter of the Visigothic king, Athanagild—was not initially in favor of being betrothed to a northern Frankish king nor was her father, as the Visigoths considered the Franks barbarians. 

To the dismay of her mother, Galswintha was ultimately forced to part with her family on her father&#x27;s (Athanagild) insistence, who conceded to the marriage; this was likely due to the territorial enticements promised by Chilperic. Once the marriage was agreed, Galswintha was sent away—her escort to Chilperic&#x27;s side consisted of nobles and warriors from among both the Goths and Franks. Crossing the Pyrenees, Galswintha&#x27;s journey took her through Narbonne and Carcassonne then on to Poitiers and Tours before reaching Rouen, the location of the marriage arrangement. Pomp and circumstance awaited her upon arrival since Chilperic pulled out all the stops, including having his army pledge allegiance on bended-knee to her as she exited the ship at Rouen. 

Immediately after their betrothal—sometime between 566 and 567—Chilperic gave Galswintha the cities of Limoges, Bordeaux, Cahors, Bearn, and Bigorre as a gift. Chilperic supposedly loved her &quot;dearly&quot; according to Gregory of Tours, but this was most likely due to her substantial dowry. His former concubine Fredegund continued to visit the king&#x27;s bedchamber, despite Chilperic&#x27;s proclaimed commitment to Galswintha and to her father Athanagild that he (Chilperic) would respect the Visigothic marriage codes—these charters forbade concubines and mistresses. Galswintha complained bitterly about this betrayal. Still in love with Fredegund, Chilperic allowed himself to be manipulated and had his wealthy wife murdered. Galswintha was apparently strangled. Historian Patrick Geary surmises that Galswintha may also have been murdered as a consequence of Chilperic&#x27;s fear that she would leave with her dowry. After Galswintha&#x27;s death, however, the lands—formerly given by Chilperic—ended up being passed on to her sister Brunhilda.

Three days after Galswintha was murdered, Chilperic married Fredegund. Galswintha&#x27;s untimely death aroused the enmity of her sister Brunhilda; it also set Chilperic&#x27;s brother Sigebert (Brunhilda&#x27;s husband) against him and Fredegund, bringing about forty years of conflict between the Frankish kingdoms of Austrasia and Neustria—a veritable Merovingian civil war. When Chilperic was murdered in 584, Brunhilda&#x27;s anger remained unassuaged, and the conflict following Galswintha&#x27;s murder continued until Fredegund&#x27;s death in 597. Beyond this, the result of such antipathy was a three-generation-long feud that essentially &quot;wrecked the Merovingian family&quot; and contributed to the death of ten kings from its line.

Galswintha remains listed in modern genealogical charts demonstrating the links between the Visigothic kingdoms and the Byzantine Empire.

== Commemoration in Verse ==
The Late Latin poet Venantius Fortunatus wrote a long commemorative poem (Carmina VI.5) in honour of Galswintha, constituting a eulogy of sorts that presented her as a saintly figure and the acts of betrayal and murder within Chilperic&#x27;s domain as an offense to God himself.

== In popular culture ==
Symphonic metal band Leaves&#x27; Eyes also wrote a song from their album &quot;Symphonies of the Night&quot; titled &quot;Galswintha&quot;.

<text>A Livability Court is a municipal court (or court of limited jurisdiction) focused on cases involving non-compliance with codes and standards about housing, waste, the environment, noise, animal control, zoning, traffic, and tourism. 

The first Livability Court in the United States was created in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2002. Other cities in South Carolina have since adopted Livability Courts including North Charleston, Lancaster, Greer and Newberry.

<text>The tetranortriterpenoid class of naturally occurring organic compounds, of which the most noted compound is azadirachtin, extracted from the neem tree (&quot;Azadirachta indica&quot;) that displays insecticidal properties. Azadirachtin mimics insect hormones called ecdysones that regulate the pupation of insects; application of azadirachtin interrupts the development and pupation of insects, eventually killing them.

The name indicates that the basic skeleton of such compounds contains 26 carbon atoms (4 fewer than triterpenes).

Azadirachtin is a tetranortriterpenoid and a limonoid.

<doc id="434341" wikidata="Q230898" url="?curid=434341" title="Fredegund">
<text>Fredegund or Fredegunda (Latin: &quot;Fredegundis&quot;; French: &quot;Frédégonde&quot;; died 8 December 597) was the queen consort of Chilperic I, the Merovingian Frankish king of Neustria. Fredegund served as regent during the minority of her son Chlothar II from 584 until 597.

Fredegund has traditionally been given a rather poor reputation, foremost by the accounts of Gregory of Tours, who depicts her as ruthlessly murderous and sadistically cruel, and she is known for the many stories of her cruelty, particularly for her long feud with her sister-in-law queen Brunhilda of Austrasia.

==Queen==
Fredegund was born into a low-ranking family but gained power through her association with King Chilperic. Originally a servant of Chilperic&#x27;s first wife Audovera, Fredegund won Chilperic&#x27;s affection and persuaded him to put Audovera in a convent and divorce her.

Chilperic put Fredegund aside and married Galswintha, the daughter of Visigothic King Athanagild, after his half-brother and rival, King Sigibert I of Austrasia, had married Gailswintha&#x27;s younger sister Brunhilda in 566. Gregory of Tours remarks that the marriage to Galswintha began happily, because she brought with her a handsome dowry. The marriage soon deteriorated, and Galswintha died the same year, probably strangled on the orders of Chilperic or Fredegund(c. 568), who succeeded Galswintha as queen. Galswintha&#x27;s sister, Brunhilda, however, began a feud which lasted more than 40 years.

Gregory of Tours suggests that the Queen had committed adultery. During a dinner with King Guntram, the recently widowed Fredegund rose to leave the table with the excuse that she was pregnant. The announcement surprised the King, as her son Clothar II was born only four months earlier. Gregory of Tours interprets this exchange as a result of Fredegund&#x27;s unfaithfulness to her husband.

In 580 AD, an epidemic of dysentery broke out in Gaul, afflicting Fredegund&#x27;s husband King Chilperic and their two sons, Chlodobert and Dagobert. Believing the plague to be a result of her sins, Fredegund burned a number of tax records she feared were unjust and encouraged Chilperic to do the same. Her sons, however, did not survive the epidemic. Following their funerals, Fredegund made a large donation to churches and the poor to continue to atone for her sins. Another of Fredegund&#x27;s sons, Samson, was stricken with a serious illness while the family was under siege in Tournai. According to Gregory, Fredegund feared that she would catch the disease from Samson and cast him away from her, allowing him to die. The King was offended by her actions as the child had not yet been baptized. When Samson survived longer than expected, Fredegund relented and had him baptized according to the King&#x27;s wishes.

=== Conflict with Rigunth ===

Gregory of Tours records the bad relationship between Fredegund and her daughter Rigunth:
She was jealous of her own daughter, Rigunth, who continually declared that she should be mistress in her place. Fredegund waited her opportunity and under the pretense of magnanimity took her to the treasure-room and showed her the King&#x27;s jewels in a large chest. Feigning fatigue, she exclaimed &quot;I am weary; put thou in thy hand, and take out what thou mayest find.&quot; The mother thereupon forced down the lid on her neck and would have killed her had not the servants finally rushed to her aid.
When Rigunth was sent off to her Visigothic fiancé in Spain Reccared, son of Liuvigild, her entourage was so laden with rich gifts that the Frankish nobles objected that the royal fisc had been depleted. Fredegund asserted that all the gifts had come out of property amassed by her husband&#x27;s generosity. On the long journey, Rigunth&#x27;s retainers repeatedly robbed and abandoned her, and by the time she reached Toulouse there was little left. When Chilperic died in 584 AD, Desiderius of Aquitaine went to Toulouse to secure the remaining treasure.

The Neustrian ex-domesticus Leunardus travelled to the Cathedral of Paris, where the Queen was staying, to relay the news of Rigunth&#x27;s capture. By Gregory&#x27;s account, Fredegund was so enraged at Leunardus&#x27;s message that she ordered his public humiliation in the center of the church. She had him beaten, chained, and jailed along with the cooks and bakers who accompanied him on the journey. She stopped short of killing him, however, due to his political status in the region.

== Regency ==
Upon the death of Chilperic I in 584, Fredegund became regent during the minority of her infant son Chlothar II. She took sanctuary in the cathedral of Paris. After obtaining the protection of King Guntram, she ensured that her son Chlothar&#x27;s claim to the throne of Neustria was recognized by his subjects. She would then reside north of Rouen. During the latter half of her life, the political situation between Neustria and Austrasia and Burgundy broke down into full on conflict. In these wars, she took on the role of commander and led the Neustrian armies to victory on multiple occasions.

=== Religion ===
During Fredegund&#x27;s regency, she maintained the support of the clergy. According to Gregory Halfond, it was found that a core group of a dozen bishoprics in Northern Gaul remained loyal to Fredegund and Chlothar. Halfond also notes that Fredegund was shown to have granted financial patronage to the Bishop of Le Mans, “...In his testament of 616, Bishop Bertram of Le Mans acknowledges that he originally received the villa of Bonnelles in Étampes as a gift from Fredegund and her young son Chlothar II, for whom she served as regent, sometime between 596 and 597.” Fredegund&#x27;s donation to Bishop Bertram was not the only isolated case of generosity as the Neustrian monarchy also maintained friendly relations and patronized St. Radegund’s monastery of the Holy Cross in Poitiers.

=== Major attempts ===
Fredegund is said to have ordered the assassination of Sigebert I of Austrasia in 575 and also to have made attempts on the lives of Sigebert&#x27;s son Childebert II, her brother-in-law Guntram, king of Burgundy, and Brunhild. After the mysterious assassination of Chilperic in 584 AD, Fredegund seized the Kings riches and took refuge in the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral. Both she and her surviving son, Clothar II, were protected by Guntram until he died in 592. Newly widowed, Fredegund attempted to seduce the Neustrian official Eberulf but was ultimately rejected. Gregory of Tours later suspects her of orchestrating Eberulf&#x27;s subsequent assassination. In 593, she led troops to an upset rout of Brunhilda&#x27;s troops at the Battle of Droizy.

=== Persecution of Praetextatus ===

Additionally, Gregory of Tours suggests that the persecution of the Bishop Praetextatus was largely driven by Fredegund. Following Praetextatus&#x27;s return from exile, the Queen met him in church and threatened to have him exiled a second time. However, the Bishop was not concerned because he believed he would receive his reward in heaven, whereas Fredegund would be punished in hell. In 586, Fredegund ordered the assassination of Praetextatus and had one of her agents stab him during Easter Mass. The Queen later visited Praetextatus on his deathbed and offered the assistance of her physicians, which Gregory of Tours interprets as an excuse to witness the bishop&#x27;s death. Praetextatus urged her to repent of her sins before finally succumbing to his wounds. Fredegund later conducted assassination plots against a number of political officials who condemned the assassination, including the Bishop of Bayeux and King Guntram.

== Death ==
Fredegund died of natural causes on 8 December 597 in Paris. The tomb of Frédégonde is a mosaic figure of marble and copper, situated in the Saint Denis Basilica, having come from the abbey church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

Fredegund did not live to see it, but her son&#x27;s execution of Brunhilda bore the mark of her conflict with Fredegund. Clothar II, then the king, ordered that she be tied by the arms and hair to the tail of a young, untamed horse, and dragged through the entire army. As soon as the king gave this order, it was carried out. The first time the man who was on the horse dug his spurs in, the horse kicked up his heels with such force that Brunhilda&#x27;s head flew off. Her body was dragged through the bushes and brambles, over hills and dales, so that it was torn to pieces, limb from limb.

==Issue==
With Chilperic I, she had five sons and one daughter, Rigunth (* around 570; † after 585). The four oldest sons were Chlodobert (* 565, † 580), Samson (* 575, † 577), Dagobert († 580) and Theuderic (* 582, † 584), who all died at a young age.

== Legacy ==
===Reputation===
Fredegund traditionally has had a negative reputation. According to Gregory of Tours, it is understood that as queen, Fredegund involved herself in court intrigue and was responsible for numerous assassination plots on political figures and clergy alike, such as the Bishop of Rouen, Praetextatus, and King Guntram of Burgundy. However, Gregory of Tours&#x27; account must be taken with suspicion as it is heavily biased against Fredegund. Halfond mentions the existence of inconsistencies regarding the relationships within the Neustrian court. For example, Bishop Leudovald whom Fredegund is mentioned to have targeted for assassination after the plot against Praetextatus succeeded for fear that Leudovald would find out and expose her. The plot ultimately failed and supposedly their relationship became racked with tension, however, regardless of fact that an attempt on his life was made he still saw fit to offer Fredegund a favor in 587 which entailed freeing one of her legates who was imprisoned on charges of carrying out an assassination in her name. Furthermore, even during the reign of Fredegund’s son, King Chlothar II, Leudovald continued to receive favor from the Neustrian monarchy and was invited to attend the Council of Paris in 614. Such oddities within Gregory’s accounts may suggest that his account of Fredegund’s villainy is exaggerated and this exaggeration likely has to do with his ties outside of Neustria.

Gregory himself was a Gallo-Roman whose family was a part of the senatorial classes, his position within society allowed him to become Bishop of the diocese of Tours. The connections he also gained from his senatorial heritage also intertwined him with the likes of King Sigebert, his wife Brunhild, and the Austrasian court which served as a rival kingdom to Neustria. In fact, it was King Sigebert I and Brunhilda that were responsible for his appointment to the bishopric of Tours. According to the historian, E.T. Dailey, these various influences likely served as the reason why he juxtaposed Fredegund and Brunhild in the way he did. Familiarity and patronage would result in a close relationship between Gregory and Brunhild, to maintain such a relationship he likely felt he was unable to comment thoroughly on her faults. 
As a result, Gregory of Tours portrays them as political enemies and moral opposites to the point where Brunhild receives almost no criticism within his record while Fredegund is accused of performing witchcraft, sacrilege, and even treason along with her various assassination plots. He likely hoped that having such a stark comparison would serve as an endorsement of Brunhild and justify his political relationship with her. This lack of criticism becomes suspect when we consider later accounts written by other scholars such as Fredegar who wrote differing interpretations on the reputation of Brunhild. After Gregory’s death, Brunhild fell from power and was accused of various regicides which resulted in her being subject to a punitive death. These accusations, whether real or fabricated due to court intrigue, show that Brunhild, a contemporary counterpart to Fredegund and equal status to her in queenship, also had internal enemies to contend with. The only exception is that because of her relationship with Gregory, Brunhild had a patron that could uphold her reputation.

===Music===
French composers of the late Romantic period dramatized her story in music. Ernest Guiraud began composing the opera &quot;Frédégonde&quot; with a libretto by Louis Gallet but did not finish before his death in 1892; it was then completed by Camille Saint-Saëns and Paul Dukas and premiered in 1895.

Max d&#x27;Ollone received the Prix de Rome in 1897 for his cantata &quot;Frédégonde&quot;.

&quot;Fredegundis&quot;, an opera in three acts by Franz Schmidt, text after Felix Dahn by Bruno Hardt-Warden and Ignaz Michael Welleminsky, was composed 1916–21, and premiered in Berlin in 1922.

<text>The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA) is a contemporary art museum with two locations in greater Los Angeles, California. The main branch is located on Grand Avenue in Downtown Los Angeles, near the Walt Disney Concert Hall. MOCA&#x27;s original space, initially intended as a temporary exhibit space while the main facility was built, is now known as the Geffen Contemporary and located in the Little Tokyo district of downtown Los Angeles. Between 2000 and 2019, it operated a satellite facility at the Pacific Design Center facility in West Hollywood.

The museum&#x27;s exhibits consist primarily of American and European contemporary art created after 1940. Since the museum&#x27;s inception, MOCA&#x27;s programming has been defined by its multi-disciplinary approach to contemporary art.

== Founding ==
In a 1979 political fundraising event at the Beverly Hills Hotel, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, Councilman Joel Wachs, and local philanthropist Marcia Simon Weisman happened to be seated at the same table. Throughout the evening, Weisman passionately discussed the city&#x27;s need for a contemporary art museum. Weisman&#x27;s brother, Norton Simon, had stepped in to bail out the financially ailing Pasadena Art Museum in 1975, but was unable to retain its focus on modern art. In the following weeks, the Mayor&#x27;s Museum Advisory Committee was organized. The committee, led by William Albert Norris, set about creating a museum from scratch, including locating funds, trustees, directors, curators, a gallery, and most importantly an art collection. That same year, Weisman and five other key local collectors signed an agreement whereby they would pledge chunks of their private collections, worth up to $6 million, &quot;to create a museum of standing and repute.&quot;

The following year, the fledgling Museum of Contemporary Art was operating out of an office on Boyd Street. The city&#x27;s most prominent philanthropists and collectors had been assembled into a board of trustees in 1980, and set a goal of raising $10 million in their first year; an artists advisory council was involved early on. A working staff was brought together; Richard Koshalek was appointed chief curator; relationships were made with artists and galleries; and negotiations were begun to secure artwork and an exhibition space. Following Weisman&#x27;s initiative, $1-million contributions from Eli Broad, Max Palevsky, and Atlantic Richfield Co. helped securing the construction of the new museum; Broad became MOCA&#x27;s founding chairman; Palevsky chaired the architectural search committee. Many of MOCA&#x27;s initial donors were young and supporting the arts for the first time; a substantial number joined up at the $10,000 &quot;founder&quot; minimum.

== Collection ==
Making up well over 90% of the museum&#x27;s works, gifts from several major private collectors form the cornerstones of MOCA&#x27;s permanent collection of nearly 6,000 works. Much of it has come from board members who donated or bequeathed key works or entire collections, or sold art to the museum at highly favorable terms.

Within months of its fall 1983 opening, MOCA was able to turn itself into an instant player in the international art world by striking a deal with one of its board members, Giuseppe Panza, who agreed to sell a group of works for $11 million and stagger the payments over five years, interest-free. The 1984 purchase of parts of the Panza Collection encompasses 80 seminal works of abstract expressionism and pop art by Jean Fautrier, Franz Kline, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg, Mark Rothko, and Antoni Tàpies. In 1985, the museum accepted Michael Heizer&#x27;s earthwork &quot;Double Negative&quot; in Nevada desert, donated by Virginia Dwan. A 1986 bequest by television executive Barry Lowen included 67 works of minimalist, post-minimalist and neo-expressionist painting, sculpture, photography and drawing by artists such as Dan Flavin, Ellsworth Kelly, Agnes Martin, Elizabeth Murray, Julian Schnabel, Joel Shapiro, Frank Stella, and Cy Twombly. In 1989, pieces by the Rita and Taft Schreiber collection were donated to the museum, encompassing 18 paintings, sculptures, and drawings by Jackson Pollock, Piet Mondrian, and Arshile Gorky, among others. Hollywood agent Phil Gersh and his wife Beatrice, both founding members, gave 13 important pieces from their collection to the museum the same year, including Pollock&#x27;s early drip painting &quot;Number 3, 1948&quot; and David Smith&#x27;s 8-foot-tall stainless steel sculpture &quot;Cubi III&quot; (1961)—as well as works by artists such as Ed Ruscha, Cindy Sherman, and Susan Rothenberg. Finally, the museum&#x27;s co-founder Marcia Simon Weisman bequeathed 83 works on paper from artists including Willem de Kooning, Barnett Newman, Jasper Johns and California-based painters Richard Diebenkorn and Sam Francis. In 1991, Hollywood screenwriter Scott Spiegel donated works by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Mark Innerst, Robert Longo, Susan Rothenberg, David Salle, among others. In 2003, the museum received the promise of a gift of 33 pieces from advertising executive Clifford Einstein, chair of MOCA&#x27;s board of trustees, and his wife, Madeline; the proposed donation included works by Kiki Smith, Nam June Paik, Mark Grotjahn, Sigmar Polke, Mike Kelley, and Lari Pittman. In 2004 the museum received the largest group of artworks donated by a private collector in its 25-year history when E. Blake Byrne, a MOCA trustee and retired television executive, gave 123 paintings, sculptures, drawings, videos and photographs by 78 artists. Over the years, major donations of art collections have come from the Lannan Foundation and through funding from the Ralph M. Parsons Foundation.

In 2000, MOCA received gifts from artists themselves, including major pieces by sculptor and performance artist Paul McCarthy, video artist Doug Aitken and photographer Andreas Gursky. Los Angeles-based artist Ed Moses made a major gift of his work to the museum in 1995, surveying nearly 40 years of his artistic development.

Included within today&#x27;s permanent collection are works by further influential artists such as Greg Colson, Kim Dingle, Sam Durant, David Hockney, Kenneth Price, John McLaughlin, Robert Motherwell, Raymond Pettibon, James Hayward, and George Segal. As the Los Angeles Times declared, &quot;There isn&#x27;t a city in America—not New York, not Chicago, not Houston, not San Francisco—where a more impressive museum collection of contemporary art can be seen.&quot;

== Exhibitions ==
Ever since it opened with an extensive exhibition called &quot;The First Show: Painting and Sculpture From Eight Collections, 1940–80&quot;, MOCA has been known for thematic-survey exhibitions about postwar art such as &quot;A Forest of Signs: Art in the Crisis of Representation&quot; (1989), &quot;A Minimal Future? Art as Object, 1958–1968&quot; (1994), &quot;Reconsidering the Object of Art: 1965–1975&quot; (1995), &quot;Hall of Mirrors: Art and Film since 1945&quot; (1996), &quot;Out of Actions: Between Performance and the Object, 1949–1979&quot; (1998), &quot;WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution&quot; (2007), &quot;Art in the Streets&quot; (2011), &quot;Under the Big Black Sun: California Art 1974–1981&quot; (2011), and &quot;Ends of the Earth: Land Art to 1974&quot; (2012). The museum also organized the first major museum retrospectives of the work of Allen Ruppersberg (1985), John Baldessari (1990), Ad Reinhardt (1991), Jeff Wall (1997), Barbara Kruger (1999), and Takashi Murakami (2007). In addition there were also monographic shows like an ambitious installation by Robert Gober in 1997, or a revelatory survey of Sigmar Polke&#x27;s photographic work in 1995. Since many of those shows traveled to New York and other cities in the U.S., like the show of Robert Rauschenberg combines that opened in Los Angeles in 2006, MOCA became known as &quot;one of the greatest feeder museums in the country&quot;. In 2010, the museum canceled a planned retrospective of influential yet under-recognized artist Jack Goldstein to commission artist and director Julian Schnabel to curate a survey of works by actor, writer and artist Dennis Hopper, and in 2012, actor James Franco curated a tribute exhibition to James Dean, two projects that have been widely criticized for their emphasis on pop and celebrity culture. Of all solo shows on view over the period between January 2008 and December 2012, only about 28% were devoted to female artists.

Besides artists&#x27; retrospectives and art historical investigations, under chief curator Paul Schimmel, MOCA has mounted various multiartist theme shows on provocative or challenging topics. &quot;Helter Skelter: L.A. Art in the 1990s&quot;, a 1992 exhibition focused on the dark side of contemporary life as portrayed by artists like Mike Kelley, Paul McCarthy and Chris Burden, involving themes such as alienation, dispossession, and violence. &quot;Out of Actions: Between Performance and the Object, 1949–1979&quot;, a landmark historical survey presented in 1998, tracked the work of about 150 artists and collectives for whom public performances, in its links to painting, sculpture, dance and theater, and the creative process were far more important than well-crafted objects. &quot;Public Offerings&quot;, in 2001, explored the phenomenon of youthful creative energy in an overheated art world where stars are created before they leave art school. In &quot;ECSTASY: In and About Altered States&quot; (2005), some of the artists&#x27; works represented altered states of mind that they have experienced under the influence of drugs or hypnosis. WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution, held in 2007, was the first major retrospective of art and the feminist revolution. MOCA hosts the LA Freewaves biennial festival, which exhibits a wide range of new media.

== Locations ==

=== MOCA Grand Avenue ===

The MOCA Downtown Los Angeles location is home to almost 5,000 artworks created since 1940, including masterpieces by classic contemporary artists, and inspiring new works by emerging and mid-career artists from Southern California and around the world. The MOCA is the only museum in Los Angeles devoted exclusively to contemporary art.

In 1986, the celebrated Japanese architect Arata Isozaki, who had never worked on a project in the United States before, completed the downtown location&#x27;s sandstone building to international critical and public acclaim, marking a dramatic achievement in the contemporary art world and heralding a new cultural era in Los Angeles. Its chief exhibition spaces are under the courtyard level, lit from above by groups of pyramidal skylights.

The construction and $23 million cost of the MOCA Grand Avenue building was part of a city-brokered deal with the developer of the $1 billion California Plaza redevelopment project on Bunker Hill, Bunker Hill Associates, who received the use of an , publicly owned parcel of land. On the grounds that the law said that 1.5% of the construction costs of new buildings had to be spent on fine-arts embellishments, MOCA&#x27;s board of trustees had struck a deal with the Community Redevelopment Agency to have the project developer build a 100,000-square-foot museum, designed by an architect of the trustees&#x27; choice, at no cost to the museum. In return for the free building, the agency required the trustees to raise $10 million for an operations endowment. Original plans had been for the building to open in time for the 1984 Summer Olympics. However, the project broke ground in 1983 and completed the museum, Omni Hotel and the first of two skyscrapers (One California Plaza) by 1986. The second skyscraper (Two California Plaza) was completed in 1992. Nancy Rubins&#x27; monumental stainless-steel sculpture &quot;Mark Thompson&#x27;s Airplane Parts&quot; (2001), purchased by MOCA in honor of founding member Beatrice Gersh in 2002, was installed at the museum&#x27;s plaza.

The Grand Avenue location is used to display pieces from MOCA&#x27;s substantial permanent collection, especially artists who did much of their work between 1940 and 1980. There is also an extensive set of rooms used to display temporary exhibits, usually a major retrospective of an important artist, or works connected by a theme.

===The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA===
While the Grand Avenue facility was being planned and under construction, MOCA opened an interim exhibition space called the &quot;Temporary Contemporary&quot; in the fall of 1983. The new space was located at the edge of a warehouse district in which many Los Angeles artists worked at the time. On November 17, 1983, the museum inaugurated the building with a Shinto purification ceremony, a ritual often held at groundbreakings in Little Tokyo, as a symbol of mutual recognition between the Japanese community and the museum. The first public program was a commissioned collaboration, &quot;Available Light&quot; by Lucinda Childs, Frank O. Gehry, and John Adams followed in November 1983 by the inaugural exhibition, &quot;The First Show: Painting and Sculpture from 1940–1980&quot; curated by Julia Brown. The building had been originally constructed in the 1940s as a hardware store for local patrons and subsequently used as a city warehouse and police car garage, the &quot;TC&quot;, as it became informally known, is leased from the city for five years for $1 a year.

Southern California architect Frank Gehry led the renovation of the Albert C. Martin, Sr.-designed 1947 Union Hardware buildings. Gehry left the exteriors intact, except for new entrance doors, and built a canopy of chain-link fencing and steel trusses over the closed-off street, to form a partially shaded plaza. There are two large, open gallery spaces, illuminated by industrial wire-glass skylights and a row of clerestory windows along the south wall. The intricate structural network of steel beams and supports has been left exposed, serving as support for the many movable display walls and lending a sculptural effect. A steel crane rail, left over from the building&#x27;s hardware days, remained in place. The loading docks now serve as the lobby.

The Temporary Contemporary immediately captivated critics and museum patrons alike with its accessibility, informality and lack of pretension. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John Russell referred to it as &quot;a prince among spaces&quot;, and William Wilson of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that it &quot;instantly had the hospitable aura of a people&#x27;s museum.&quot; In the view of many, these two appraisals have been borne out in the ensuing years. The &quot;New York Times&quot; later wrote that &quot;[m]ore than any event in recent decades, the Temporary (now known as the Geffen Contemporary) changed the cultural face of Los Angeles&quot;.

Due to the popularity of the Temporary Contemporary and extraordinary suitability of the building for exhibiting contemporary art, the museum&#x27;s board requested that the City of Los Angeles extend MOCA&#x27;s lease on the facility for 50 years, until 2038. That request was granted in early 1986, and in 1996 the city extended the lease even further. Also in 1996, MOCA received a $5-million gift from The David Geffen Foundation in support of the museum&#x27;s endowment drive, and in recognition of this extraordinary gift, the Temporary Contemporary was renamed The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA.

In 2019, MOCA received another $5-million gift from Wonmi and Kihong Kwon to transform the Geffen Contemporary with a cross-disciplinary series that will emphasize varied forms of performance but will also include experiential installations, concerts, screenings, readings, conventions and other events. It also will host artist residencies and rehearsals.

The 55,000-square-foot facility gives enormous latitude to artists and encourages experimentation. It is the largest of the MOCA locations and is ideally suited to large-scale sculptural works and conceptual, multi-media or electronic installations. It is typically used to display more recent works, often by lesser-known artists, and works which require a large amount of space. Some of these works are designed specifically for the Geffen Contemporary&#x27;s space. In 2018, MOCA unveiled a Barbara Kruger mural, &quot;Untitled (Questions)&quot;, on the Geffen exterior facing Temple Street and sponsored by Wonmi and Kihong Kwon.

In 2021, MOCA received one of the inaugural grants from the Frankenthaler Climate Initiative to support its solar energy project at the Geffen Contemporary.

=== MOCA at The Pacific Design Center ===
From 2000 until 2019, MOCA maintained a exhibition space at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood to present new work by emerging and established artists as well as ancillary programs based upon its major exhibitions and renowned permanent collection. A focus was on design and architecture. The museum exhibited work by Takashi Murakami, Sterling Ruby, Catherine Opie and William Kentridge there, as well as by designers Rick Owens and Rodarte. MOCA also utilized the 384-seat PDC auditorium for a range of public programs.

== Programs ==

=== Sunday Studio ===
On the first Sunday of each month from 1pm to 3:30pm, Sunday Studio workshops typically begin with an interactive, discussion-based &quot;spotlight&quot; tour, highlighting selected works from a current exhibition. Next, participants work collaboratively to create art in response to the work they&#x27;ve seen.

Designed and taught by artists, these process-oriented workshops extend the gallery experience and frequently include special activities such as musical performance, movement, and other multidisciplinary approaches to works on view. The program is offered in English and Spanish.

Big Family Day is an annual spring culminating event for all of MOCA&#x27;s school and community partnership programs. Featuring student docents, entertainment, music, artmaking and a student art exhibition, this event usually attracts over 1,000 participants, including MOCA members, their families, and the community at large.

Sunday Studio events are held at Grand Avenue unless otherwise stated in the bimonthly calendar or on the website.

=== Teens of Contemporary Art (TOCA) ===
Teens of Contemporary Art is an open gathering of high school students interested in learning more about contemporary art with their peers. The group meets each month for exhibition explorations, art workshops, discussions about contemporary art, and events planning. An advisory council of teens identifies the topics and issues addressed at the monthly sessions. All TOCA participants get free admission to the museum.

TOCA events are the second Sunday of every month.

=== MOCA Apprenticeship Program (MAP) ===
Each year, the MOCA Apprenticeship Program (MAP) creates a supportive artistic community for a small, diverse group of high school students.

=== Engagement Party ===
Engagement Party (2008–2012) was a free public program that presented new work by emerging Southern California–based artists working collectively and collaboratively. The program offered artist collectives three-month residencies during which they presented public programs at MOCA Grand Avenue and the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA on the first Thursday of each month from 7 to 10pm. Collectives employed many different mediums, disciplines, and strategies during their residency, resulting in programs that included performances, workshops, screenings, lectures, and many other activities emerging from the group&#x27;s particular focus.

Participating Artists: Finishing School, Knifeandfork (Brian House and Sue Huang), OJO, Slanguage, My Barbarian, Lucky Dragons, Ryan Heffington + the East Siders, and The League of Imaginary Scientists, Neighborhood Public Radio, The Los Angeles Urban Rangers, Liz Glynn, and CamLab.

==Awards==
=== Women in the Arts ===
The Women in the Arts event, established in 1994 by the MOCA fundraising arm the MOCA Projects Council, is a benefit for MOCA&#x27;s educational programs and generally draws more than 600 people from the fields of art, fashion, philanthropy, film and other areas of entertainment. The Award to Distinguished Women in the Arts recognizes women providing leadership and innovation in visual arts, dance, music and literature. Artist Jenny Holzer is one of the main females that has shown her work through textile and expressing her believes in the feminist art movement. Holzer art has changed over the years from making street posters, painted signs, paintings, photographs, to creating T-shirts for Willi Smith, and establishing a trend of LED signs. Holzers has been involved in many events and foundations such as, Dia Art Foundation,  Time&#x27;s Up movement, &quot;Social Strategies ,&quot; Institute of Contemporary Arts, and many more. Holzer designed the bronze plaque, which features one
of the artist&#x27;s truisms: “It is in your self-interest to find a way to be very tender.” Past recipients include collector Beatrice Gersh (1994), editor Tina Brown (1997), choreographer Twyla Tharp (1999), actress and director Anjelica Huston (2001), and artists Barbara Kruger (2001), Yoko Ono (2003), Jenny Holzer (2010), Annie Leibovitz (2012) and Marylin Minter (2015).

===Eric and Wendy Schmidt Environment and Art Prize===
First established in 2024, the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Environment and Art Prize – including $100,000 to be given directly to the artists, with materials and other supporting costs paid separately – will be awarded every two years until 2028, resulting in four prizes—the inaugural year having two recipients—with exhibitions into 2030. The recipients of the inaugural award were Julian Charrière and Cecilia Vicuña.

==Management==
===Director===
In November 2021, Johanna Burton joined MOCA as the executive director, with Klaus Biesenbach shifting to the role of artistic director. Burton is formerly the director of the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio. Prior to Johanna&#x27;s arrival, Klaus Bisenbach departed MOCA to serve as director of the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, Germany.

In July 2018, MoMA PS1 curator Klaus Biesenbach, was named as the new director of MOCA, following the abrupt resignation of Philippe Vergne. Vergne, formerly the director of the Dia Art Foundation in New York, began his tenure as MOCA&#x27;s director in January 2014, and ended it amid a series of controversies, including the firing of chief curator Helen Molesworth.

Before Vergne, Maria Seferian served as interim director from September 2013 to March 2014, while the institution underwent the search for its next director. She has been counsel to the museum since 2008. The New York art dealer and curator Jeffrey Deitch served as director of MOCA from June 1, 2010, through September 1, 2013. On July 24, 2013, he told the board of his decision to leave. Deitch experienced a measure of controversy for his clash with Paul Schimmel, the museum&#x27;s then-chief curator. The board&#x27;s firing of Schimmel on June 28, 2012, was met with criticism from the community.

Between 1999 and 2008, Jeremy Strick led the institution. Before that, Richard Koshalek served as director, deputy director and chief curator from 1980 to 1999. Pontus Hultén was founding director between 1980 and 1982.

===Board of trustees===
As of August 2016, MOCA&#x27;s board is headed by Guess jeans co-founder Maurice Marciano and Lilly Tartikoff Karatz. Vice chairs are Eugenio Lopez, Lillian P. Lovelace and Maria Seferian; chair emeriti are Clifford J. Einstein and David G. Johnson; president emeriti are Dallas Price-Van Breda and Jeffrey Soros. Board members are Wallis Annenberg, Gabriel Brener, Steven A. Cohen, Charles L. Conlan II, Kathi B. Cypres, Laurent Degryse, Ariel Emanuel, Susan Gersh, Aileen Getty, Nancy Jane F. Goldston, Laurence Graff, Bruce Karatz, Wonmi Kwon, Daniel S. Loeb, Mary Klaus Martin, Jamie McCourt, Edward J. Minskoff, Steven T. Mnuchin, Peter Morton, Heather Podesta, Carolyn Clark Powers, Steven F. Roth, Carla Sands, Chara Schreyer, Adam Sender, Sutton Stracke, Cathy Vedovi, Christopher Walker, Orna Amir Wolens. Artists sitting on MOCA&#x27;s board include John Baldessari, Barbara Kruger, Catherine Opie, Mark Grotjahn, Mark Bradford and Lari Pittman. Life trustees include MOCA&#x27;s founding chairman Eli Broad as well as Betye Monell Burton, Blake Byrne, Lenore S. Greenberg, Audrey Irmas, Frederick M. Nicholas and Thomas E. Unterman. The current Los Angeles mayor (Eric Garcetti) and LA City Council president (Herb J. Wesson Jr.), chief financial officer (Michael Harrison) and museum director (Philippe Vergne) are &quot;ex-officio&quot; members.

The current mayor and president of the city council have votes; their presence on the board is a condition for MOCA&#x27;s long-term $1 a year lease on the Geffen Contemporary building. In accordance with a policy enacted in 1993, trustees serve three-year, renewable terms and rotate off after six years; they are generally invited to return after one year.

Despite this addition of wealthy art collectors to the board, contributions and grants to the museum have fallen recently, and Broad missed two quarters of payments of the money he promised MOCA. All of the artist members of the board—John Baldessari, Barbara Kruger, Catherine Opie and Ed Ruscha—resigned later that year, in response to developments at the museum under the leadership of Jeffrey Deitch, including the termination of senior curator Paul Schimmel.

In 2014, Baldessari, Kruger and Opie resumed their positions on the MOCA board. Also, fellow artists Mark Grotjahn and Mark Bradford were elected to MOCA&#x27;s board over the course of 2014; Lari Pittman was added in August 2016.

===Funding===
Unlike the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which is partly controlled by the county, MOCA receives minimal government funding and does not have a steady source of funds. Its annual budget has grown to exceed $20 million, but it relies on donors to pay about 80% of its expenses. MOCA&#x27;s budget for the fiscal year 2011 was $14.3 million, the museum&#x27;s lowest spending since the 1990s. In 2011, the museum reported net assets (basically, a total of all the resources it has on its books, except the value of the art) of $38 million.

In December 2008, during the world financial meltdown, newspapers reported that the museum&#x27;s endowment, which partly depended on stock investments, had dropped and that museum had fiscal problems Partly in violation of state law, the museum lost $44 million of their $50 million endowment over nine years, Deficits mounted at the rate of $2.8 million a year on average from mid-2000 to mid-2008. Amid speculation that the museum may close its doors, deaccession artworks, and/or merge with another institution, a grassroots, artist-led organization called MOCA Mobilization petitioned for MOCA to remain independent and keep its collection intact.

The Attorney General&#x27;s office, to whom Eli Broad had been a campaign contributor, investigated MOCA. Ultimately, although the investigation was closed with no disciplinary action (Board members were asked to take a voluntary training in their fiduciary duties), just the report of the investigation in the Los Angeles Times had an enormous impact – donors fled and the trustees, in the maelstrom, accepted Broad&#x27;s terms for control of the institution in exchange for his promise to donate money. Broad, MOCA&#x27;s founding chairman from 1979 to 1984 and life trustee of the museum, offered $30 million in a staggered donation, $15 million as matching donations. An agreement with Broad was tentatively reached on December 18, but another possibility—a merger with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art—had not been ruled out. On December 23, the museum announced that it had accepted Broad&#x27;s offer and would be making a number of significant changes to its leadership. Director Jeremy Strick resigned, and a new position of chief executive officer was created for Charles E. Young, former chancellor of the University of California, Los Angeles. Broad required compliance with strict financial terms, but did not demand Strick&#x27;s resignation or Young&#x27;s appointment as a condition. Hired for a limited term, Young oversaw layoffs and cutbacks in the exhibition schedule that reduced MOCA&#x27;s budget from more than $24 million to less than the $16 million in 2011. In a departure from past practice, when MOCA would schedule shows before funding had been secured, it has adopted a policy of committing to exhibitions only after at least 80% of its projected budget has been lined up.

The departure of respected curator Paul Schimmel on June 28, 2012, led to an exodus of trustees, committee members and a bombardment of criticism in the community. And because Broad himself has defaulted on his promised payments to MOCA that expire in 2013 the viability of the institution has come into question under Broad&#x27;s leadership. As of late 2012, the Museum of Contemporary Art and the private University of Southern California are in talks about a possible partnership.

In a first for MOCA, a two-day Sotheby&#x27;s auction of donated works by artists in May 2015 raised $22.5 million for the museum endowment; the sale included works by Mark Grotjahn, Takashi Murakami and Ed Ruscha.

===Attendance===
MOCA exhibitions draw roughly 60% of their visitors from the L.A. area; their attendance totaled 236,104 in 2010, up by 89,000 over the previous year.

<doc id="434344" wikidata="Q973978" url="?curid=434344" title="Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick">
<text>Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick or Henry de Newburgh (died 20 June 1119) was a Norman nobleman who rose to great prominence in the Kingdom of England.

==Origins==
Henry was a younger son of Roger de Beaumont by Adeline of Meulan, daughter of Waleran III, Count of Meulan, and Oda de Conteville.

==Early career==
Henry was given by his father the modest lordship of Le Neubourg, in central Normandy, to the northeast of his father&#x27;s &quot;caput&quot; of Beaumont-le-Roger on the River Risle. From this lordship he adopted for himself and his descendants the surname Anglicised to &quot;de Newburgh&quot;, frequently Latinised to &quot;de Novo Burgo&quot; (meaning &quot;from the new borough/town&quot;).

Henry was said, by Orderic Vitalis the Norman monk historian, to have been with William the Conqueror on his 1068 campaign in the Midlands when he was supposedly given charge of Warwick Castle, but there is no supporting evidence for this late source. Little is in fact known of his career before 1088. However, he took a leading role in reconciling the Conqueror with his eldest son Robert Curthose in 1081, so he stood high in the Conqueror&#x27;s favour. In 1088 he was a royal agent in the arrest and trial of the traitorous bishop of Durham, William de Saint-Calais.

==Under William II==
Henry acquired a much greater land-holding in England when, in reward for help in suppressing the Rebellion of 1088, King William II made him Earl of Warwick in 1088. The lands of the earldom were put together from several sources. The bulk was provided by the majority of the lands in Warwickshire and elsewhere recorded as those of his elder brother Robert, Count of Meulan in the Domesday Survey of 1086. He also received large royal estates in Rutland and the royal forest of Sutton, which became Sutton Chase. The complicated arrangement to endow his earldom is unprecedented, and must have been the result of a three way arrangement between his father, his brother and the king.

==Under Henry I==
Henry became the companion and friend of King Henry I, William II&#x27;s successor. When a division took place among the barons who had gathered together in the aftermath of the king&#x27;s sudden death in 1100 to choose a successor, it was mainly owing to de Beaumont&#x27;s advice that Henry, the conqueror&#x27;s fourth son, was selected. However, in the following year most of the barons were openly or secretly disloyal and favoured the attempt of Henry&#x27;s elder brother Robert Curthose, now Duke of Normandy, to gain the Crown. Henry de Beaumont and his brother Robert, King Henry&#x27;s foremost advisors, were among the few that remained faithful to the King.

From around this time, Henry became an important figure in the Norman invasion of Wales, gaining the Lordship of Gower from Iestyn ap Gwrgant around 1107. Henry or his barons built or reoccupied a number of castles at Swansea, Penrhys, Llanrhidian, Oystermouth and Loughor.

==Marriage and issue==
Before 1100 Henry married Margaret (died after 1156), daughter of Geoffrey II of Perche and Beatrix of Montdidier, daughter of Hilduin IV, Count of Montdidier. They had two daughters and the following sons:
# Roger, 2nd Earl of Warwick (c. 11021153), who succeeded Henry
# Robert de Neubourg (died 1159), who inherited barony of Annebecq
# Rotrou (died 1183), who was successively Bishop of Évreux and Archbishop of Rouen, Chief Justiciar and Steward of Normandy. In 1167 he led the funeral service of Empress Matilda, daughter of Henry I and mother of Henry II.
# Geoffrey de Neubourg. He moved to England at the end of 1137 and resided thereafter with his eldest brother Earl Roger of Warwick. He made a number of appearances in Earl Roger&#x27;s charters as &quot;Geoffrey the earl&#x27;s brother.&quot; When Roger died in 1153 and was succeeded by his son, Earl William, &quot;Geoffrey the earl&#x27;s uncle&quot; continued to live in the Warwick household. He appears as a ducal justice in Normandy in his later years. See Haskins Society Journal 13 (2004): 50.
# Henry de Neubourg, otherwise known as &quot;Henry of Gower&quot;. He re-conquered the family&#x27;s Welsh estates in around 1136, holding the lordship of Gower throughout the reign of King Stephen.
==Death and legacy==
Henry entered the Abbey of Saint-Pierre de Préaux before his death and died as a monk there on 20 June 1119. An eighteenth-century woodcut of his tomb in the chapter house, with those of his brother and father beside him, survives, though the abbey is long ruined.

<text>Mary Esther Wells (May 13, 1943 – July 26, 1992) was an American singer, who helped to define the emerging sound of Motown in the early 1960s.

Along with the Supremes, the Miracles, the Temptations, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, and the Four Tops, Wells was said to have been part of the charge in black music onto radio stations and record shelves of mainstream America, &quot;bridging the color lines in music at the time&quot;.

With a string of hit singles composed mainly by Smokey Robinson, including &quot;The One Who Really Loves You&quot;, &quot;Two Lovers&quot;, and the Grammy-nominated &quot;You Beat Me to the Punch&quot;, all in 1962, plus her signature hit, &quot;My Guy&quot; (1964), she became recognized as &quot;The Queen of Motown&quot; until her departure from the company in 1964, at the height of her success.

==Life and career==
===Early life and initial recordings (1943–1962)===
Mary Esther Wells was born near Detroit&#x27;s Wayne State University on May 13, 1943, to a mother who worked as a domestic, and an absentee father. One of three children, she contracted spinal meningitis at the age of two and struggled with partial blindness, deafness in one ear and temporary paralysis. At age 10, Wells contracted tuberculosis. During her early years, Wells lived in Black Bottom and struggled with poverty. By age 12, she was helping her mother with house cleaning work.

Wells used singing as her comfort from her pain and by age 10 had graduated from church choirs to performing at local nightclubs in the Detroit area. Wells graduated from Detroit&#x27;s Northwestern High School at the age of 17 and set her sights on becoming a scientist, but after hearing about the success of Detroit musicians such as Jackie Wilson and the Miracles, she decided to try her hand at music as a singer-songwriter.

In 1960, 17-year-old Wells approached Tamla Records founder Berry Gordy at Detroit&#x27;s Twenty Grand club, with a song she had intended for Jackie Wilson to record, since Wells knew of Gordy&#x27;s collaboration with Wilson. However, a tired Gordy insisted Wells sing the song in front of him. Impressed, Gordy had Wells enter Detroit&#x27;s United Sound Systems to record the single, titled &quot;Bye Bye Baby&quot;. After a reported 22 takes, Gordy signed Wells to the Motown subsidiary of his expanding record label and released the song as a single in September 1960; it peaked at number 8 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart in 1961, and later crossed over to the pop singles chart, where it peaked at number 45.

Wells&#x27; early Motown recordings reflected a rougher R&amp;B sound than the smoother style of her biggest hits. Wells became the first Motown female artist to have a Top 40 pop single after the Mickey Stevenson-penned doo-wop song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Take a Chance&quot; hit number 33 in June 1961. In the fall of that year, Motown issued her first album and released a third single, the bluesy ballad &quot;Strange Love&quot;. When that record bombed, Gordy set Wells up with the Miracles&#x27; lead singer Smokey Robinson. Though she was hailed as &quot;the first lady of Motown&quot;, Wells was technically Motown&#x27;s third female signed act: Claudette Rogers, of Motown&#x27;s first star group the Miracles, has been referred to by Berry Gordy as &quot;the first lady of Motown Records&quot; due to her being signed as a member of the group, and in late 1959 Detroit blues-gospel singer Mable John had signed to the then-fledgling label a year prior to Wells&#x27; arrival. Nevertheless, Wells&#x27; early hits as one of the label&#x27;s few female solo acts did make her the label&#x27;s first female star and its first fully successful solo artist.

===Success (1962–1964)===
Wells&#x27;s teaming with Robinson led to a succession of hit singles over the following two years. Their first collaboration, 1962&#x27;s &quot;The One Who Really Loves You&quot;, was Wells&#x27;s first hit, peaking at number 2 on the R&amp;B chart and number 8 on the Hot 100. The song featured a calypso-styled soul production that defined Wells&#x27;s early hits. Motown released the similar-sounding &quot;You Beat Me to the Punch&quot; a few months later. The song became her first R&amp;B number 1 single and peaked at number 9 on the pop chart. The success of &quot;You Beat Me to the Punch&quot; helped to make Wells the first Motown star to be nominated for a Grammy Award when the song was nominated for Best Rock &amp; Roll Recording in 1963.

In late 1962, &quot;Two Lovers&quot; became Wells&#x27;s third consecutive single to hit the Top 10 of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100, peaking at number 7 and becoming her second number 1 hit on the R&amp;B chart. This helped to make Wells the first female solo artist to have three consecutive Top 10 singles on the pop chart. The track sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Wells&#x27;s success at the label was recognized when she became a headliner during the first string of Motortown Revue concerts, starting in the fall of 1962. The singer showcased a rawer stage presence that contrasted with her softer R&amp;B recordings.

Wells&#x27;s success continued in 1963 when she hit the Top 20 with the doo-wop ballad &quot;Laughing Boy&quot; and scored three additional Top 40 singles, &quot;Your Old Standby&quot;, &quot;You Lost the Sweetest Boy&quot;, and its B-side, &quot;What&#x27;s Easy for Two Is So Hard for One&quot;. &quot;You Lost the Sweetest Boy&quot; was one of the first hit singles composed by Holland–Dozier–Holland, the songwriting and producing team, though Robinson remained Wells&#x27;s primary producer.

Also in 1963, Wells recorded a session of successful B-sides that arguably became as well known as her hits, including &quot;Operator&quot;, &quot;What Love Has Joined Together&quot;, &quot;Two Wrongs Don&#x27;t Make a Right&quot; and &quot;Old Love (Let&#x27;s Try It Again)&quot;. Wells and Robinson also recorded a duet titled &quot;I Want You &#x27;Round&quot;, which would be re-recorded by Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston.

In 1964, Wells recorded &quot;My Guy&quot;. The Smokey Robinson song became her trademark single, reaching number 1 on the Cashbox R&amp;B chart for seven weeks and becoming the number 1 R&amp;B single of the year. The song successfully crossed over to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where it eventually replaced Louis Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; at number 1, remaining there for two weeks. The song became Wells&#x27;s second million-selling single.
To build on the song&#x27;s success, Motown released a duet album recorded with fellow Motown singing star Marvin Gaye, &quot;Together&quot;. The album peaked at number 1 on the R&amp;B album chart and number 42 on the pop album chart, and yielded the double-sided hits &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s the Matter With You Baby&quot;.

&quot;My Guy&quot; was one of the first Motown songs to break on the other side of the Atlantic, eventually peaking at number 5 on the UK chart and making Wells an international star. Around this time, the Beatles stated that Wells was their favorite American singer, and soon she was given an invitation to open for the group during their tour of the United Kingdom, thus making her the first Motown star to perform in the UK. Wells was only one of three female singers to open for the Beatles, the others being Brenda Holloway and Jackie DeShannon. Danny Tyrell accompanied her in live shows in Detroit. Wells made friends with all four Beatles and later released a tribute album, &quot;Love Songs to the Beatles&quot;, in mid-decade.

Former Motown sales chief Barney Ales described Wells&#x27;s landmark success in 1964:
===Leaving Motown (1964–1965)===

Ironically during her most successful year, Wells was having problems with Motown over her original recording contract, which she had signed at the age of 17. She was also reportedly angry that the money made from &quot;My Guy&quot; was being used to promote the Supremes, who had found success with &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot;, just as &quot;My Guy&quot; was promoted, using the profits from another, earlier hit Motown song. Though Gordy reportedly attempted to renegotiate with Wells, the singer still asked to be freed from her contract with Motown.

A pending lawsuit kept Wells away from the studio for several months, as she and Gordy brokered the contract details, with Wells fighting to gain a larger share of the royalties she had earned during her tenure with Motown. Finally, Wells invoked a clause that allowed her to leave the label, advising the court that her original contract was invalid, as she had signed while she was still a minor. Wells won her lawsuit and was awarded a settlement, leaving Motown officially in early 1965, whereupon she accepted a lucrative ($200,000) contract with 20th Century Fox Records.

Part of the terms of the agreement of her release was that she could not receive any royalties from her past works with the label, including use of her likeness to promote herself.

===Career struggles (1965–1977)===
Wells worked on material for her new record label while dealing with other issues, including being bedridden for weeks suffering from tuberculosis. Wells&#x27;s eponymous first 20th Century Fox release included the first single &quot;Ain&#x27;t It The Truth&quot;, its B-side &quot;Stop Taking Me for Granted&quot;, the lone top 40 hit, &quot;Use Your Head&quot; and &quot;Never, Never Leave Me&quot;. However, the album flopped, as did the Beatles tribute album she released not too long afterwards. Rumors have hinted Motown may have threatened to sue radio stations for playing Wells&#x27;s post-Motown music during this time. After a stressful period in which Wells and the label battled over multiple issues after her records failed to chart successfully, the singer asked to be let go in 1965 and left with a small settlement.

In 1966, Wells signed with Atlantic Records&#x27;s subsidiary Atco. Working with producer Carl Davis, she scored her final Top 10 R&amp;B hit with &quot;Dear Lover&quot;, which also became a modestly successful pop hit, peaking at number 51. However, much like her tenure with 20th Century Fox, the singer struggled to come up with a follow-up hit, and in 1968, she left the label for Jubilee Records, where she scored her final pop hit, &quot;The Doctor&quot;, a song she co-wrote with then-husband Cecil Womack. Meanwhile, she had attempted to develop a film career, but only managed a guest starring role in 1967&#x27;s &quot;Catalina Caper&quot; (1967). In 1970, Wells left Jubilee for a short-lived deal with Warner Music subsidiary Reprise Records and released two Bobby Womack-produced singles. In 1972, Wells scored a UK hit with a re-issue of &quot;My Guy&quot;, which was released on the Tamla-Motown label and climbed to number 14. Though a re-issue, Wells promoted the single heavily and appeared on the British TV show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; for the first time. Despite this mini-revival, she decided to retire from music in 1974 to raise her family.

===Comeback (1977–1989)===
In 1977, Wells divorced Cecil Womack and returned to performing. She was spotted by CBS Urban president Larkin Arnold in 1978 and offered a contract with the CBS subsidiary Epic Records, which released &quot;In and Out of Love&quot; in October 1981. The album, which had been recorded in 1979, yielded Wells&#x27;s biggest hit in years, the funky disco single, &quot;Gigolo&quot;.

&quot;Gigolo&quot; became a smash at dance clubs across the country. A six-minute mix hit number 13 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Dance/Club Singles chart and number 2 on the Hot Disco Songs chart. A four-minute radio version released to R&amp;B stations in January 1982 achieved a modest showing at number 69. It turned out to be Wells&#x27;s final chart single.

After the parent album failed to chart or produce successful follow-ups, the Motown-styled &quot;These Arms&quot; was released, but it flopped and was quickly withdrawn, and Wells&#x27;s Epic contract fizzled. The album&#x27;s failure may have been due to light promotion. She still had one more album in her CBS contract, and in 1982, released an album of cover songs, &quot;Easy Touch&quot;, which aimed for the adult contemporary radio format.

Leaving CBS in 1983, she continued recording for smaller labels, gaining new success as a touring performer.

On the April 21, 1984 edition of &quot;American Top 40&quot;, Casey Kasem reported that Wells was attempting to establish a hot dog chain.

In 1989, Wells was celebrated with a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation during its inaugural year.

===Final years (1990–1992)===
In 1990, Wells recorded an album for Ian Levine&#x27;s Motorcity Records, but her voice began to fail, causing the singer to visit a local hospital. Doctors diagnosed Wells with laryngeal cancer. Treatments for the disease ravaged her voice, forcing her to quit her music career. Since she had no health insurance, her illness wiped out her finances, forcing her to sell her home. As she struggled to continue treatment, old Motown friends, including Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, members of the Temptations and Martha Reeves, made donations to support her, along with the help of admirers such as Dionne Warwick, Rod Stewart, Bruce Springsteen, Aretha Franklin and Bonnie Raitt. That same year, a benefit concert was held by fellow fan and Detroit R&amp;B singer Anita Baker. Wells was also given a tribute by friends such as Stevie Wonder and Little Richard on &quot;The Joan Rivers Show&quot;.

In 1991, Wells brought a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Motown for royalties she felt she had not received upon leaving Motown Records in 1964 and for loss of royalties for not promoting her songs as the company should have. Motown eventually settled the lawsuit by giving her a six-figure sum. That same year, she testified before the United States Congress to encourage government funding for cancer research:

==Personal life==
Wells married twice: first, in 1960, to Detroit singer Herman Griffin; they divorced in 1963. Despite rumors, she never dated fellow Motown singer Marvin Gaye, who would go on to have successful duet partnerships with Kim Weston, Tammi Terrell and Diana Ross after Wells had left Motown.

In 1966, Wells married singer-songwriter Cecil Womack, formerly of the Valentinos, and the younger brother of musician Bobby Womack. The marriage lasted until 1977 and they produced three children.

Wells had four children from two marriages: Cecil Jr., Harry, Stacy, and Sugar.

==Death==
In the summer of 1992, Wells&#x27; cancer returned and she was rushed to the Kenneth Norris Jr. Cancer Hospital in Los Angeles with pneumonia. With the effects of her unsuccessful treatments and a weakened immune system, Wells died on July 26, 1992, at the age of 49. After her funeral, which included a eulogy given by her old friend and former collaborator, Smokey Robinson, Wells was cremated, and her ashes were laid to rest in Glendale&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in a Womack family crypt. Family friend Sam Cooke is buried in The Garden of Honor, about to the west.

==Accolades==
Though Wells has been eligible for induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, being nominated in 1987, she has yet to achieve it.

Wells earned one Grammy Award nomination during her career. Her song &quot;My Guy&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.

Wells was given one of the first Pioneer Awards by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1989. A year later, the foundation raised more than $50,000 to help with her treatment after her illness had wiped out all of her finances.

Wells was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2006. She was inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in 2017.

<text>David Lee Grayson (June 6, 1939 – July 29, 2017) was an American professional football cornerback and safety who played in the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Texans / Kansas City Chiefs and the Oakland Raiders. He played college football for the Oregon Webfoots.

==Early years==
Grayson attended San Diego High School, playing running back and defensive back. As a sophomore, he helped his team achieve an 11-0-1 record, while outscoring opponents 382-65 and being awarded the mythical National championship by the National Sports News Service. After the season he transferred to Lincoln High School.

After graduating from high school he went on to play at San Diego City College. Besides football, in track he was a part of the 4 × 200 metres relay team that set a national junior college record.

As a junior, he transferred to the University of Oregon, where he played offensive and defensive halfback.

In 1982, he was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame. In 2010, he was inducted into the Breitbard Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
In 1961, he was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys, but because head coach Tom Landry felt he lacked size for the physical play that was needed in NFL at the time, Chief talent scout Gil Brandt called the AFL&#x27;s Dallas Texans head coach Hank Stram and suggested he give Grayson a look.

Grayson made the team and played four years with the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs. In 1961, he set the franchise and AFL record for the longest interception return with a 99-yarder against the New York Titans. In 1961, he also led the league in kickoff returns. In 1962 and 1963, he finished second in the league in kickoff returns. In 1965, he was traded to the Oakland Raiders in exchange for cornerback Fred Williamson.

Grayson held the AFL record for longest interception return for a touchdown, 99 yards, against the New York Titans in 1961. He had an interception off George Blanda in the Texans&#x27; 1962 double-overtime championship game victory over the defending AFL champion Houston Oilers. Grayson was an AFL All-Star six times, with the Texans/Chiefs in 1962, 1963 and 1964, and with the Raiders in 1965, 1966 and 1969.

In 1967, he was moved from right cornerback to safety. He made a 48-yard return with the opening kickoff against the Oilers in the 1967 AFL Championship Game, helping his team win the game and reach Super Bowl II. In 1968, he led the AFL with 10 interceptions. His 29 interceptions rank seventh all-time in Raiders history.

Grayson is the all-time AFL leader in interceptions with 47, for a 20-yard return average and 5 touchdowns, and he averaged 25.4 yards on 110 kickoff returns. He is a member of the AFL All-Time Team.

In 2017, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Grayson to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2017.

==Personal==
After football he opened different businesses, which included one of the biggest nightclubs in Southeast San Diego during the seventies. He also was involved with organizations like the Boys Club, YMCA and the Committee for Community Involvement of Black Athletes.

Grayson died on July 29, 2017. His son, David Lee Grayson Jr. played linebacker in the NFL from 1987 to 1990 with the Cleveland Browns and in 1991 with the San Diego Chargers.

<doc id="434362" wikidata="Q925671" url="?curid=434362" title="Flehmen response">
<text>The flehmen response (; from German &quot;flehmen&quot;, to bare the upper teeth, and Upper Saxon German &quot;flemmen&quot;, to look spiteful), also called the flehmen position, flehmen reaction, flehmen grimace, flehming, or flehmening, is a behavior in which an animal curls back its upper lip exposing its front teeth, inhales with the nostrils usually closed, and then often holds this position for several seconds. It may be performed over a sight or substance of particular interest to the animal, or may be performed with the neck stretched and the head held high in the air.

Flehmen is performed by a wide range of mammals, including ungulates and felids. The behavior facilitates the transfer of pheromones and other scents into the vomeronasal organ (VNO, or Jacobson&#x27;s organ) located above the roof of the mouth via a duct which exits just behind the front teeth of the animal.

==Etymology==
The word originates from the German verb &quot;flehmen&quot;, to bare the upper teeth. It comes from the Upper Saxon German &quot;flemmen&quot;, &quot;to look spiteful&quot;. The word was introduced in 1930 by Karl Max Schneider, director of the Leipzig zoo and an authority on big cats in captivity.

==Discovery==
The flehmen response was first described by Frederik Ruysch and described later by Ludwig Jacobson in 1813.

==Description==
This response is characterized by the animal curling back its top lip exposing the front teeth and gums, then inhaling and holding the posture for several seconds. The behavior may be performed over particular locations, in which case the animal may also lick the site of interest, or may perform the flehmen with the neck stretched and head held high in the air for a more general gustatory or taste-related investigation. The flehmen response often gives the &quot;appearance&quot; that the animal is looking spiteful, grimacing, smirking, disgusted, or laughing.

==Mechanism==
The flehmen response draws air into the vomeronasal organ (VNO), an auxiliary olfactory sense organ that is found in many animals. This organ plays a role in the perception of certain scents and pheromones. The vomeronasal organ is named for its closeness to the vomer and nasal bones, and is particularly well developed in animals such as cats and horses. The VNO is found encompassed inside a bony or cartilaginous capsule which opens into the base of the nasal cavity. Animals that exhibit flehmen have a papilla located behind the incisors and ducts which connect the oral cavity to the VNO, with horses being an exception. Horses exhibit flehmen but do not have an incisive duct communication between the nasal and oral cavity because they do not breathe through their mouths; instead, the VNOs connect to the nasal passages by the nasopalatine duct.

===Chemical cues===
The chemical cue obtained by an animal exhibiting the flehmen response is the presence of a non-volatile organic compound. In contrast to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), non-volatile organic compounds are those carbon compounds that do not participate in atmospheric photochemical reactions or evaporate under normal atmospheric conditions. The VNO detects non-VOCs, which must have direct contact with the odor source. Sources of non-VOCs relevant to the flehmen response include pheromones and hormones excreted from the genital regions or urine of animals.

==Function==
An animal may perform the flehmen response when investigating sites of particular interest, or perhaps (more generally) odors or tastes. In horses, spontaneous flehmen response outside of the normal context can also indicate discomfort.
=== Intra-species communication ===
The primary function of the flehmen response is intra-species communication. By transferring air containing pheromones and other scents to the vomeronasal organ (VNO), an olfactory-chemosensory organ located between the roof of the mouth and the palate, animals can gather chemical &quot;messages&quot;. These scents tell an animal about other members of their species in some of the following ways:
* Identifying reproductive status – male individuals commonly use the flehmen response as an olfactory mechanism for identifying the reproductive state of females of the same species based on pheromones in the female&#x27;s urine or genitals. This is exhibited in the reproductive behavior of sheep. The ram often exhibits flehmen after sniffing the ewes&#x27; external genital region, but this occurs most frequently on the day before estrus when the ewes are sexually receptive.
* Reproductive synchrony – flehmen behavior also plays a role in reproductive synchrony between females. In the sable antelope, the frequency of flehmen changes seasonally, with the highest levels just prior to conception. Female antelopes associate closely with other females in the same reproductive state. Flehmen rates between females anticipated birth synchrony. Additionally, the level of synchrony was predicted by the frequency of female urine sampling during the previous year. Flehmen is a mechanism used by female sable antelopes to manipulate the timing of both conception and birth of offspring. In the American bison, flehmen behavior in females has also been shown to stimulate the onset of estrus and copulation synchronization.
* Post-parturition – in horses, mares commonly show a peak in flehmen response during the first few hours after giving birth. Smelling the newborn foal and the amniotic fluids associated with birth often produces the reaction.
* Immature animals – in young horses, both colts (males) and fillies (females) exhibit flehmen behavior toward other conspecifics with neither sex performing the behavior more than the other. However, it has been reported that young colts flehmen up to five times more frequently than fillies, and fillies flehmen more frequently than mature mares. Young elephants also have a flehmen response to stimulants. The VNO of newborn elephants displays a structural maturity similar to adults, which supports the conclusion that flehmen at only six weeks of age is used to deliver chemical pheromones to a functional VNO.

===Inter-species communication===
The flehmen response is not limited to intra-species communication. Goats have been tested for their flehmen response to urine from 20 different species, including several non-mammalian species. This study suggests there is a common element in the urine of all animals, an interspecific pheromone, which elicits flehmen behavior. Specifically, chemical pheromone levels of a modified form of androgen, a sex hormone, were associated with the response in goats.

==Mammals exhibiting==
A wide range of mammals exhibit flehmen including both predatory and non-predatory species.

The response is perhaps most easily observed in domestic cats and horses; both exhibit a strong flehmen response to odors. Stallions usually smell the urine of mares in estrus whereas the male giraffe&#x27;s flehmen response includes tasting the female&#x27;s urine. Elephants perform a flehmen response but also transfer chemosensory stimuli to the vomeronasal opening in the roof of their mouths using the prehensile structure, sometimes called a &quot;finger&quot;, at the tips of their trunks.

Other animals which exhibit the flehmen response include
sheep, American bison, tigers, tapirs, lions, giraffes, goats, llamas, kobs, hedgehogs, rhinoceros, giant pandas, antelope and hippopotamuses.

<text>Erythrina is a genus of plants in the pea family, Fabaceae. It contains about 130 species, which are distributed in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. They are trees, with the larger species growing up to in height. These species are known for their large flowers with long and bright red or orange petals.

== Taxonomy ==
The generic name is derived from the Greek word , meaning &quot;red&quot;, referring to the flower color of certain species.

=== Common names ===
Particularly in horticulture, the name coral tree is used as a collective term for these plants. Flame tree is another vernacular name, but may refer to a number of unrelated plants as well. Many species of &quot;Erythrina&quot; have bright red flowers, and this may be the origin of the common name. However, the growth of the branches can resemble the shape of sea coral rather than the color of &quot;Corallium rubrum&quot; specifically, and this is an alternative source for the name. Other popular names, usually local and particular to distinct species, liken the flowers&#x27; red hues to those of a male chicken&#x27;s wattles, and/or the flower shape to its leg spurs. Commonly seen Spanish names for any local species are bucaré, frejolillo or porotillo, and in Afrikaans some are called kafferboom (from the species name &quot;Erythrina caffra&quot;). Mullumurikku is a widespread name in Kerala.

== Description ==
A flower of most known &quot;Erythrina&quot; species is made of long top petals that fold into a boat or spade shape and curve backwards from the stem while the bottom petals enclose its stamens; both together make almost a butterfly shape. Not all of them flower in just bright red; the wiliwili (&quot;E. sandwicensis&quot;) has extraordinary variation in its flower colour, with orange, yellow, salmon, green and white all being found within natural populations. This striking color polymorphism is also found in &quot;Erythrina lysistemon&quot; and &quot;Erythrina afra&quot;.

=== Ecology ===
All species except the sterile hybrids &quot;E.&quot; × &quot;sykesii&quot; and &quot;E.&quot; × &quot;bidwillii&quot; have legume-type fruit, sometimes called pods, containing one or more seeds. The resilient buoyant seeds are often carried by the sea for large distances and are commonly called &quot;sea beans&quot;.

&quot;Erythrina&quot; leaves are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the swift moth &quot;Endoclita damor&quot; and the woolly bears &quot;Hypercompe eridanus&quot; and &quot;Hypercompe icasia&quot;. The mite &quot;Tydeus munsteri&quot; is a pest on the coastal coral tree (&quot;E. afra&quot;).

Many birds visit the nectar-rich &quot;Erythrina&quot; flowers. In the Neotropics, these are usually larger hummingbirds, for example the swallow-tailed hummingbird (&quot;Eupetomena macroura&quot;) and the black-throated (&quot;Anthracothorax nigricollis&quot;) and green-breasted mangos (&quot;A. prevostii&quot;) – though they seem not to be especially fond of &quot;E. speciosa&quot; at least, which they visit rather opportunistically. In Southeast Asia, the black drongo (&quot;Dicrurus macrocercus&quot;) which usually does not eat nectar in quantity has been observed feeding on &quot;E. suberosa&quot; flowers, and mynas and of course more specialized nectar feeders also utilize coral tree flowers. Lorikeets such as the collared lory (&quot;Phigys solitarius&quot;) and the possibly extinct New Caledonian lorikeet (&quot;Charmosyna diadema&quot;) are known to consume (or have consumed) large amounts of &quot;Erythrina&quot; nectar.

==Use by humans==
Some coral trees are used widely in the tropics and subtropics as street and park trees, especially in drier areas. In some places, such as Venezuela, &quot;bucaré&quot;s are used as shade trees for coffee or cocoa crops. In the Bengal region, they are used for the same purpose in &quot;Schumannianthus dichotoma&quot; plantations. &quot;E. lanceolata&quot; in particular is considered highly suitable as &quot;frame&quot; tree for vanilla vines to grow up on.

Native Hawaiians made a number of items from &quot;wiliwili&quot; wood because of its low density, such as &quot;mouo&quot; (fishing net floats), &quot;ama&quot; (outrigger canoe floats, and extremely long &quot;papa hee nalu&quot; (surfboards) called &quot;olo&quot;. &quot;Olo&quot;, which averaged , were exclusively ridden by &quot;alii&quot; (royalty). The wood was sometimes used for the &quot;waa&quot; (hull) of outrigger canoes intended to be used near-shore, for recreation, or for training. The shiny orange-red seeds were strung into &quot;lei&quot;.

The conspicuous, even dramatic coral trees are widely used as floral emblems. cockspur coral tree (&quot;E. crista-galli&quot;) is the national flower of Argentina and Uruguay. The coastal coral tree (&quot;E. afra&quot;) is the official city tree of Los Angeles, California, where it is referred to simply as the &quot;coral tree&quot;. The state trees of Mérida and Trujillo in Venezuela are &quot;bucaré ceibo&quot; (&quot;E. poeppigiana&quot;) and purple coral tree (&quot;bucaré anauco, E. fusca&quot;), respectively. Yonabaru, Okinawa as well as the Okinawa Prefecture, Quanzhou, Fujian Province and Pathum Thani Province have the Indian coral tree (&quot;E. variegata&quot;) as floral emblems. Known as &quot;thong lang&quot; in Thailand, the latter species is also one of the &quot;thong&quot; (&quot;trees&quot;) referred to in the name of Amphoe Chom Thong, Chiang Mai Province. In a similar vein, Zumpahuacán in Mexico derives its name from Nahuatl &quot;tzompahuacá&quot;, &quot;place of the &quot;Erythrina americana&quot;&quot;. 

In Hinduism, the &quot;mandāra&quot; tree in Indra&#x27;s garden in Svarga is held to be &quot;E. stricta&quot;. The same motif is found in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, where the mandāravā (Tib. &quot;man dā ra ba&quot;) growing in Sukhāvatī is identified as an Indian coral tree (&quot;E. variegata&quot;). The concept of the Five Trees of Paradise is also found in Christian Gnosticism. Though as none of the trees is identified as an &quot;Erythrina&quot; here, the concept might not be as directly related to the Asian religions as some presume.
The seeds of at least one-third of the species contain potent erythrina alkaloids, and some of these are used for medicinal and other purposes by indigenous peoples. They are all toxic to some degree, however, and the seeds of some can cause fatal poisoning. The chemical compounds found in plants in this genus include alkaloids such as scoulerine, erysodin, erysovin (namely in &quot;E. flabelliformis&quot;), and the putative anxiolytic erythravine (isolated from Mulungu, &quot;E. mulungu&quot;). Erysodienone is a precursor in the biosynthesis of many of these alkaloids.

===As food===
Root tubers of &quot;Erythrina&quot; species have been traditional food for aborigines of the Northern Territory of Australia.

In Vietnam, people use the leaves of &quot;E. variegata&quot; to wrap &quot;nem chua&quot; (a kind of fermented pork wrapped in banana leaves).

<text>Ilia II (; born 4 December 1933), also transcribed as Ilya or Elijah, is the 82nd and current Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia, the spiritual leader of the Georgian Orthodox Church. He is officially styled as &quot;Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia, the Archbishop of Mtskheta-Tbilisi and Metropolitan Bishop of Bichvinta and Tskhum-Abkhazia, His Holiness and Beatitude Ilia II.&quot;

==Biography==
Ilia II was born 4 December 1933 as Irakli Ghudushauri-Shiolashvili () in Ordzhonikidze (modern-day Vladikavkaz), an autonomous city of North Caucasus Krai within the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, USSR. His parents came from the Kazbegi district of Georgia. His father, Giorgi Shiolashvili, was from the village Sno, and his mother, Natalia Kobaidze, from the village Sioni. The Shiolashvili were an influential clan in the highlands of Khevi.

Irakli Ghudushauri graduated from the Moscow Theological Seminary and was ordained, under the name of Ilia, a hierodeacon in 1957 and hieromonk in 1959. He graduated from the Moscow Theological Academy in 1960 and returned to Georgia, where he was assigned to the Batumi Cathedral Church as a priest. In 1961, he was promoted to hegumen and later to archimandrite. On 26 August 1963, he was chosen to be the bishop of Batumi and Shemokmedi and appointed a patriarchal vicar. From 1963 to 1972, he was also the first rector of the Mtskheta Theological Seminary—the only clerical school in Georgia at that time.

In 1967, Ilia was consecrated as the bishop of Tskhumi and Abkhazeti and elevated to the rank of metropolitan in 1969. After the death of the controversial Patriarch David V, he was elected the new Catholicos-Patriarch of Georgia on 25 December 1977.

The new patriarch began a course of reforms, enabling the Georgian Orthodox Church, once suppressed by the Soviet ideology, to largely regain its former influence and prestige by the late 1980s. In 1988, there were 180 priests, 40 monks, and 15 nuns for a congregation variously estimated as being from one to three million. There were 200 churches, one seminary, three convents, and four monasteries. During the last years of the Soviet Union, he was actively involved in Georgia&#x27;s social life.

The patriarch oversaw the publication of a linguistically updated, modern Georgian version of the Bible, which was printed in the Gorbachev era.

The patriarch joined the people demonstrating in Tbilisi against the Soviet rule on 9 April 1989, and fruitlessly urged the protesters to withdraw to the nearby Kashueti Church to avoid the bloodshed. This peaceful demonstration was dispersed by the Soviet troops, leaving behind 22 dead and hundreds injured. During the civil war in Georgia in the 1990s, he called the rival parties to find a peaceful solution to the crisis.

From 1978 to 1983, Ilia II was co-president of the World Council of Churches (WCC), an ecumenical organization the Georgian Orthodox Church had joined with other Soviet churches in 1962. In May 1997, a vocal group of conservative Orthodox clerics accused Ilia II of participating in &quot;ecumenical heresy&quot; and threatened schism. The patriarch hastily convened the Holy Synod and announced withdrawal from the WCC. In 2002, the then-president of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze and Ilia II signed a concordat whereby the Georgian Orthodox Church was granted a number of privileges, and holders of the office of patriarch were given legal immunity.

==Awards and recognition==

As patriarch, he has received the highest Church awards from the Patriarchs of the Orthodox Churches of Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Russia, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania and almost all other Orthodox Churches. As a productive theologian and church historian, he was conferred an Honorary Doctorate of Theology from St. Vladimir&#x27;s Orthodox Theological Seminary in New York (1986), the Academy of Sciences in Crete (1997) and the St. Tikhon&#x27;s Orthodox Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania (1998). Ilia II is an Honorary Academician of the Georgian Academy of Sciences (2003) and Hon. Fellow of the American School of Genealogy, Heraldry and Documentary Sciences. In February 2008, his grace was awarded the David Guramishvili Prize. For its supporting views regarding the monarchical restoration of the House of Bagration in Georgia, Patriarch Ilia II received the Grand Collar of the Order of the Eagle of Georgia from Prince David Bagration of Mukhrani.

==Ilia II and Russia==
During the August 2008 Russo-Georgian War, Ilia II appealed to the Russian political leadership and the church, expressing concerns that &quot;the Orthodox Russians were bombing Orthodox Georgians&quot;. He also made a pastoral visit, bringing food and aid, to the Russian-occupied central Georgian city of Gori and the surrounding villages which were at the verge of humanitarian catastrophe. He also helped retrieve the bodies of deceased Georgian soldiers and civilians. Ilia II also blessed the September 1, 2008 &quot;Stop Russia&quot; demonstrations, in which tens of thousands organized human chains across Georgia.

In December 2008, Ilia II visited Moscow to participate in the funeral service of Russia&#x27;s late Patriarch Alexy II. On 9 December 2008, he met Russia&#x27;s President Dmitry Medvedev, which was the first high-level official contact between the two countries since the August war. Later, Ilia II announced that he had some &quot;positive agreements&quot; with Medvedev which needed &quot;careful and diplomatic&quot; follow-up by the politicians.

In March 2023, Ilia II wrote a letter to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I expressing &quot;great heartache&quot; over the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War and expressing his concern over the non-renewal of the right of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which is subordinate to the Moscow Patriarchate and is not recognized by Bartholomew, to use the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra monastery. Ilia&#x27;s statement prompted criticism in Georgia, where it was interpreted by some as support for the Moscow Patriarchate and Russia.

==Initiative to increase Georgia&#x27;s declining birth rate==
In late 2007, concerned with Georgia&#x27;s declining birth rate, Ilia II offered to personally baptize any child born to a family that already has at least two children, as long as the new child was to be born after his announcement. He conducts mass baptism ceremonies four times a year. The patriarch&#x27;s initiative contributed to a national baby boom, as being baptized by the Patriarch is a considerable honour among adherents of the Georgian Orthodox Church. Ilia II has more than 47,000 godchildren.

==Approval ratings==
Ilia II was called &quot;the most trusted man in Georgia&quot; by CNN in 2010, and had the highest favourability rating among Georgian politicians (94%), according to a November 2013 National Democratic Institute for International Affairs poll.

==Views==

=== Constitutional monarchy ===
Ilia II has a reputation as a proponent of constitutional monarchy as a form of government for Georgia. On 7 October 2007, he publicly called in a sermon for consideration of establishing a constitutional monarchy under the Bagrationi dynasty (which the Russian Empire had dispossessed of the Georgian crown early in the 19th century). The call coincided with rising confrontation between the government of President Mikheil Saakashvili and the opposition, many members of which welcomed the patriarch&#x27;s proposal. Ilia II favored the ancient house of Prince David Bagration of Mukhrani and initiated a marriage between this genealogically senior royal line and the Gruzinsky branch.
He later personally baptized the offspring of this union, Prince Giorgi Bagration Mukhrani, his godson, styling him &quot;Prince of Georgia&quot; in a ceremony including the whole Synod. In June 2018 he gave an official blessing and performed the wedding ceremony for Prince Juan de Bagration-Mukhrani and Kristine Dzidziguri at Svetitskhoveli Cathedral.

In November 2024, the Georgian Orthodox Church released a statement signed by Ilia II congratulating the socially conservative governing party on its victory in a parliamentary election reportedly marred by fraud.

=== Homosexuality ===
In 2013, Ilia II described homosexuality as a &quot;disease&quot; and compared it to drug addiction. He urged the Georgian authorities to stop a gay rights rally planned for Tbilisi on 17 May 2013 to mark International Day Against Homophobia, stating that the rally was a &quot;violation of the majority&#x27;s rights&quot; and &quot;an insult&quot; to Georgian tradition. Following his comments, thousands of Georgians, led by Georgian Orthodox priests, took to the streets of Tbilisi to protest the gay rights rally. Due to escalating violence against the rally&#x27;s participants, the rally had to be abandoned, and the activists were driven in a bus to safety by the police. In his response to the event, Ilia II said he did not endorse violence.

=== Liberalism ===
In his sermons, Ilia II has condemned homosexuality and abortion, demanded television be censored to remove sexual content, denounced school textbooks for &quot;insufficient patriotism,&quot; lectured against what he calls &quot;extreme liberalism,&quot; and warned against &quot;pseudo-culture&quot; from abroad. He has opposed attempts to give other Christian confessions equal status under Georgian law and has condemned international educational exchanges and working abroad as &quot;unpatriotic.&quot;

<doc id="434385" wikidata="Q437526" url="?curid=434385" title="Bobby Jones (golfer)">
<text>Robert Tyre Jones Jr. (March 17, 1902 – December 18, 1971) was an American amateur golfer who was one of the most influential figures in the history of the sport; he was also a lawyer by profession. Jones founded and helped design the Augusta National Golf Club, and co-founded the Masters Tournament. The innovations that he introduced at the Masters have been copied by virtually every professional golf tournament in the world.

Jones was the most successful amateur golfer ever to compete at a national and international level. During his peak from 1923 to 1930, he dominated top-level amateur competition, and competed very successfully against the world&#x27;s best professional golfers. Jones often beat stars such as Walter Hagen and Gene Sarazen, the era&#x27;s top pros. Jones earned his living mainly as a lawyer, and competed in golf only as an amateur, primarily on a part-time basis, and chose to retire from competition at age 28, though he earned significant money from golf after that, as an instructor and equipment designer.

Explaining his decision to retire, Jones said, &quot;It [championship golf] is something like a cage. First you are expected to get into it and then you are expected to stay there. But of course, nobody can stay there.&quot; Jones is most famous for his unique &quot;Grand Slam,&quot; consisting of his victory in all four major golf tournaments of his era (the open and amateur championships in both the U.S. and the U.K.) in a single calendar year (1930). In all Jones played in 31 majors, winning 13 and placing among the top ten finishers 27 times.

After retiring from competitive golf in 1930, Jones founded and helped design the Augusta National Golf Club soon afterwards in 1933. He also co-founded the Masters Tournament, which has been annually staged by the club since 1934 (except for 1943–45, when it was canceled due to World War II). The Masters evolved into one of golf&#x27;s four major championships. Jones came out of retirement in 1934 to play in the Masters on an exhibition basis through 1948. Jones played his last round of golf at East Lake Golf Club, his home course in Atlanta, on August 18, 1948. A picture commemorating the event now sits in the clubhouse at East Lake. Citing health reasons, he quit golf permanently thereafter. Jones suffered from a rare neurological condition called syringomyelia, which eventually robbed him of the ability to walk. He died of cardiovascular disease in 1971.

Bobby Jones was often confused with the prolific golf course designer Robert Trent Jones, with whom he worked from time to time. &quot;People always used to get them confused, so when they met, they decided each be called something different,&quot; Robert Trent Jones Jr. said. To help avoid confusion, the golfer was called &quot;Bobby,&quot; and the golf course designer was called &quot;Trent.&quot;

==Early life==
Jones was born on March 17, 1902, in Atlanta, Georgia. He battled health issues as a young boy, and golf was prescribed to strengthen him. Encouraged by his father, &quot;Colonel&quot; Robert Purmedus Jones, an Atlanta lawyer, Jones loved golf from the start. He developed quickly into a child prodigy who won his first children&#x27;s tournament at the age of six at his home course at East Lake Golf Club. In 1916, Jones won his first major golf event when he claimed the inaugural Georgia Amateur Championship conducted by the Georgia State Golf Association at the Capital City Club, in Brookhaven, at age 14. His victory at this event put him in the national spotlight for the first time. The Georgia Amateur win caught the eye of the United States Golf Association which awarded Jones his first invitation to the U.S. Amateur at Merion near Philadelphia. Jones advanced to the quarterfinals in his first playing in the event.

He was influenced by club professional Stewart Maiden, a native of Carnoustie, Scotland. Maiden was the professional at the Atlanta Athletic Club&#x27;s East Lake Golf Club, who also trained Alexa Stirling, the three-time winner of the U.S. Women&#x27;s Amateur, who was five years older than Jones but also a prodigy at East Lake. Jones also received golf lessons from Willie Ogg when he was in his teenage years. Jones played frequently with his father, a skilled golfer himself. The younger Jones sometimes battled his own temper on the course, but later controlled his emotions as he became more experienced. Jones toured the U.S. during World War I from 1917 to 1918, playing exhibition matches before large crowds, often with Alexa Stirling and Perry Adair, to generate income for war relief. Playing in front of such crowds in these matches helped him, as he moved into national competition a bit later on.

Jones successfully represented the United States for the first time, in two winning international amateur team matches against Canada, in 1919 and 1920, earning three of a possible four points in foursomes and singles play. In 1919 he traveled to Hamilton Golf and Country Club, for his first serious competitive action outside the U.S., while in 1920, Engineers Country Club, in Roslyn, Long Island, hosted the matches. Still a teenager, he was by far the youngest player in the series. Jones also played in the 1919 Canadian Open while in Hamilton, Ontario, performing very well to place tied for second, but 16 shots behind winner J. Douglas Edgar. Edgar had immigrated from England in 1919 to take a club professional&#x27;s job in Atlanta at Druid Hills Golf Club; Edgar mentored and played frequently with Jones from 1919 to 1921. Edgar was credited by Jones with helping develop his game significantly.

Jones qualified for his first U.S. Open at age 18 in 1920, and was paired with the legendary Harry Vardon for the first two rounds. He won the Southern Amateur three times: 1917, 1920, and 1922. Jones earned his B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Tech in 1922 and played for the varsity golf team, lettering all four years. Jones was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and the Georgia Phi chapter house at Georgia Tech is named in his honor. He then earned an A.B. in English Literature from Harvard College in 1924, where he was a member of the Owl Club. In 1926 he entered Emory University School of Law and became a member of Phi Delta Phi. After only three semesters he passed the Georgia bar exam and subsequently joined his father&#x27;s law firm, Jones, Evins, Moore and Howell, (predecessor to Alston &amp; Bird), in Atlanta, Georgia.

===First majors===
As an adult, he hit his stride and won his first U.S. Open in 1923. From that win at New York&#x27;s Inwood Country Club, through his 1930 victory in the U.S. Amateur, he won 13 major championships (as they were counted at the time) in 21 attempts. Jones was the first player to win &quot;The Double&quot;, both the U.S. and British Open Championships in the same year (1926). He was the second (and last) to win the U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur in the same year (1930), first accomplished in 1916 by Chick Evans. Jones also won both the British Amateur and British Open Championships in 1930, and is the second golfer in history after John Ball to win those two tournaments in the same year.

===1930: Grand Slam===
Jones is the only player ever to have won the (pre-Masters) Grand Slam, or all four major championships, in the same calendar year (1930). Jones&#x27;s path to the 1930 Grand Slam title was:

#The Amateur Championship, Old Course at St Andrews, Scotland (May 31, 1930)
#The Open Championship, Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Hoylake, England (June 20, 1930)
#U.S. Open, Interlachen Country Club, Minnesota (July 12, 1930)
#U.S. Amateur, Merion Golf Club, Pennsylvania (September 27, 1930)

Jones made a bet on himself achieving this feat with British bookmakers early in 1930, before the first tournament of the Slam, at odds of 50–1, and collected over $60,000 when he did it.

=== Walker Cup ===
Jones represented the United States in the Walker Cup five times, winning nine of his 10 matches, and the U.S. won the trophy all five times. He served as playing captain of the U.S. team in 1928 and 1930. He also won two other tournaments against professionals: the 1927 Southern Open and the 1930 Southeastern Open. Jones was a lifelong member of the Atlanta Athletic Club (at the club&#x27;s original site, now the East Lake Golf Club), and the Capital City Club in Atlanta.

===Sportsmanship===
In the first round of the 1925 U.S. Open at the Worcester Country Club near Boston, his approach shot to the 11th hole&#x27;s elevated green fell short into the deep rough of the embankment. As he took his stance to pitch onto the green, the head of his club brushed the grass and caused a slight movement of the ball. He took the shot, then informed his playing partner Walter Hagen and the USGA official covering their match that he was calling a penalty on himself. Hagen was unable to talk him out of it, and they continued play. After the round and before he signed his scorecard, officials argued with Jones but he insisted that he had violated Rule 18, moving a ball at rest after address, and took a 77 instead of the 76 he otherwise would have carded. Jones&#x27;s self-imposed one-stroke penalty eventually cost him the win by a stroke in regulation, necessitating a playoff, which he then lost. Although praised by many sports writers for his gesture, Jones was reported to have said, &quot;You might as well praise me for not robbing banks.&quot;

A similar event occurred in the next U.S. Open, played at the Scioto Country Club in Columbus, Ohio. In the second round, after his opening round put him in second place, Jones was putting on the 15th green in the face of a strong wind. After grounding his putter during address to square up the club face, the ball rolled a half turn in the wind when Jones lifted the club head to place it behind the ball. Although no one else observed this movement of the ball either, again Jones called a penalty on himself, but this time Jones went on to win the tournament, the second of his four U.S. Open victories.

===St Andrews, Scotland===
Jones had a unique relationship with the town of St Andrews. On his first appearance on the Old Course in The Open Championship of 1921, he withdrew after 11 holes in the third round, when he failed to complete the hole (in effect disqualifying himself), and tore up his scorecard, although he finished the round and indeed played the fourth round as well. He firmly stated his dislike for The Old Course and the town reciprocated, saying in the press, &quot;Master Bobby is just a boy, and an ordinary boy at that.&quot; Later, he came to love the Old Course and the town like few others. When he won the Open at the Old Course in 1927, he wowed the crowd by asking that the trophy remain with his friends at the Royal and Ancient Golf Club rather than return with him to Atlanta. He won the British Amateur over The Old Course in 1930, and scored a double eagle 2 on the fourth hole (then a par-5, now a par-4), by holing a very long shot from a fairway bunker. In 1958, he was named a Freeman of the City of St Andrews, becoming only the second American to be so honored, the other being Benjamin Franklin in 1759. As Jones departed Younger Hall with his honor, the assembly spontaneously serenaded him off to the traditional tune of Will Ye No Come Back Again? in a famously moving tribute. Today, a scholarship exchange bearing the Jones name exists between the University of St Andrews and Emory University, Queen&#x27;s University, The University of Western Ontario and the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. At Emory, four students are sent to St Andrews for an all-expenses-paid year of study and travel. In return, Emory accepts four students from St Andrews each year. The program, the Robert T. Jones Scholarship, is among the most unusual scholarships offered by any university.

=== Turned professional ===
In September 1930, a month and a half after his final U.S. Amateur victory, Jones turned professional. Though he did not intend to earn money from playing golf in pro tournaments, Jones intended to make money from instructional films and books. According to USGA rules, only professionals were allowed to make money from golf in any form. In addition, Jones worked with J Victor East, an Australian of A.G. Spalding &amp; Co., to develop the first set of matched steel-shafted clubs; the clubs sold very well and into the 1970s were still considered among the best-designed sets ever made.

===Masters Tournament===
Jones played in the first dozen Masters, through 1948, but only in the first as a contender. By then, his health at age 46 had declined to the stage where this was no longer possible. With his health difficulties, being past his prime, and not competing elsewhere to stay in tournament form, he never truly contended at the Masters, although his scores were usually respectable. These were almost all ceremonial performances, since his main duty was as host of the event. His extraordinary popularity, efforts with the course design, and tournament organization boosted the profile of the Masters significantly. The tournament, jointly run by Jones and Clifford Roberts, made many important innovations that became the norm elsewhere, such as gallery ropes to control the flow of the large crowds, many scoreboards around the course, the use of red / green numbers on those scoreboards to denote under / over par scores, an international field of top players, high-caliber television coverage, and week-long admission passes for patrons, which became extremely hard to obtain. The tournament also sought and welcomed feedback from players, fans, and writers, leading to continual improvement over the years. The Masters gradually evolved to being one of the most respected tournaments in the world, one of the four major championships.

== Augusta National Golf Club ==
Following his retirement from competitive golf in 1930, and even in the years leading up to that, Jones had become one of the most famous sports figures in the world and was recognized virtually everywhere he went. While certainly appreciative of the enormous adulation and media coverage, this massive attention caused Jones to lose his privacy in golf circles, and he wished to create a private golf club where he and his friends could play golf in peace and quiet. For several years, he searched for a property near Atlanta where he could develop his own golf club. His friend Clifford Roberts, a New York City investment dealer, knowing of Jones&#x27;s desire, became aware of a promising property for sale in Augusta, Georgia, where Jones&#x27;s mother-in-law had grown up, and informed Jones about it. Jones first visited Fruitlands, an Augusta arboretum and indigo plantation since the Civil War era, in the spring of 1930, and he purchased it for $70,000 in 1931, with the plan to design a golf course on the site.

Alister MacKenzie followed Jones at the 1927 Open Championship and presented him with an inscribed copy of his book &quot;Golf Architecture&quot; after his victory at the Old Course in St. Andrews. Two years later, Jones was in California for the 1929 U.S. Amateur at Pebble Beach, which provided an opportunity to experience two courses designed by MacKenzie. Jones played in an exhibition at Pasatiempo and practice round at Cypress Point Club. It is said that Jones was so impressed by Cypress Point that he asked MacKenzie about his interest in the Augusta project, which was originally envisioned as a &quot;golfing hotel resort&quot; before he won the Grand Slam. Jones co-designed the Augusta National course with MacKenzie. The new club opened in early 1933 with the purpose of hosting golf tournaments. Jones had hoped the U.S Open could be played at Augusta, but the course conditions were not suitable in the summer when the Open was played. Grantland Rice, editor of &quot;American Golfer&quot;, made the suggestion to hold a tournament for sports writers who were returning home after attending spring training in Florida. The tournament was held in March 1934. The new tournament, originally known as the Augusta National Invitational, was an immediate success and attracted most of the world&#x27;s top players right from its start. Jones came out of retirement to play, essentially on an exhibition basis, and his presence guaranteed enormous media attention, boosting the new tournament&#x27;s fame. In 1939, the tournament was renamed The Masters. The Masters, one of the best-known golf tournaments, is part of the modern Grand Slam.

Later, in 1947, he founded Peachtree Golf Club in Atlanta and co-designed the course with Robert Trent Jones.

===Other records===
Jones&#x27;s four titles in the U.S. Open remain tied for the most ever in that championship, along with Willie Anderson, Ben Hogan, and Jack Nicklaus. His four-second-place finishes in the U.S. Open place him second all-time with Sam Snead and Nicklaus. Phil Mickelson holds the record with six (1999, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013) second-place finishes. His five titles in the U.S. Amateur are a record. Jones was ranked as the fourth greatest golfer of all time by &quot;Golf Digest&quot; magazine in 2000. Nicklaus was first, Hogan second, and Snead third. Jones was ranked as the third greatest golfer of all time in a major survey published by &quot;Golf Magazine&quot;, September 2009. Nicklaus was ranked first, with Tiger Woods second, Hogan fourth, and Snead fifth.

==Films==

Jones appeared in a series of short instructional films produced by Warner Brothers in 1931 titled &quot;How I Play Golf, by Bobby Jones&quot; (12 films) and in 1933 titled &quot;How to Break 90&quot; (six films). The shorts were designed to be shown in theaters alongside feature films, whereby &quot;would-be golfers of the country can have the Jones&#x27; instruction for the price of a theater ticket.&quot; Jones indicated at the time of the making of the 1931 series that the films would be &quot;designed as instructive&quot; but not &quot;so complicated that a non-golfer can&#x27;t understand them.&quot;

The films were popular, and Jones gave up his amateur status while earning lucrative contract money for this venture. These films were put into storage and were unavailable for decades, but a surviving print was located sixty years later and put into video format for preservation by Ely Callaway, a distant cousin of Jones&#x27;s. All 18 shorts were subsequently preserved and released in a DVD collection by Warner Archive on November 6, 2012. They also air occasionally on Turner Classic Movies, usually in the space between features.

Actors and actresses, mostly under contract with Warner Brothers, but also from other studios, volunteered to appear in these 18 episodes. Some of the more well-known actors to appear in the instructional plots included James Cagney, Joe E. Brown, Edward G. Robinson, W.C. Fields, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Richard Barthelmess, Richard Arlen, Guy Kibbee, Warner Oland and Loretta Young. Various scenarios involving the actors were used to provide an opportunity for Jones to convey a lesson about a particular part of the game. The shorts were directed by the prolific George Marshall.

Jones was the subject of the quasi-biographical 2004 feature film &quot;Bobby Jones: A Stroke of Genius&quot; in which he was portrayed by Jim Caviezel. The Jones legend was also used to create a supporting character in &quot;The Legend of Bagger Vance&quot; in 2000, portrayed by Joel Gretsch, and the event where he called his own penalty is used for the fictional protagonist, Rannulph Junuh.

==Books==

Jones authored several books on golf including &quot;Down the Fairway&quot; with Oscar Bane &quot;O.B.&quot; Keeler (1927), &quot;The Rights and Wrongs of Golf&quot; (1933), &quot;Golf Is My Game&quot; (1959), &quot;Bobby Jones on Golf&quot; (1966), and &quot;Bobby Jones on the Basic Golf Swing&quot; (1968) with illustrator Anthony Ravielli. The 300-copy limited edition of &quot;Down the Fairway&quot; is considered one of the rarest and most sought-after golf books by collectors. To keep this book readily available to golfers, Herbert Warren Wind included a reproduction of &quot;Down the Fairway&quot; in his Classics of Golf Library.

Jones has been the subject of several books, most notably &quot;The Bobby Jones Story&quot; and &quot;A Boy&#x27;s Life of Bobby Jones&quot;, both by O.B. Keeler. Other notable texts are &quot;The Life and Times of Bobby Jones: Portrait of a Gentleman&quot; by Sidney L. Matthew, &quot;The Greatest Player Who Never Lived&quot; by J. Michael Veron, and &quot;Triumphant Journey: The Saga of Bobby Jones and the Grand Slam of Golf&quot; by Richard Miller. Published in 2006, &quot;The Grand Slam&quot; by Mark Frost has received much note as being evocative of Jones&#x27;s life and times.

In 1934 Agatha Christie wrote the detective novel &quot;Why Didn&#x27;t They Ask Evans?&quot; The novel&#x27;s hero was named Bobby Jones and the book starts with a scene in which he plays golf rather badly.

== Personal ==
Jones married Mary Rice Malone in 1924, whom he met in 1919 while a freshman at Georgia Tech. They had three children: Clara Malone (1925–1994), Robert Tyre III (1926–1973), and Mary Ellen (1931–1977).

When he retired from golf at age 28, he concentrated on his Atlanta law practice.

During World War II, Jones served as an officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps. His superiors wanted him to play exhibition golf in the United States, but Jones was insistent on serving overseas. In 1943 he was promoted to major and trained as an intelligence officer, serving in England with the 84th Fighter Wing, which was part of the Ninth Air Force. While in England, he made the acquaintance of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Landing in Normandy on June 7, 1944, Jones spent two months with a front line division as a prisoner of war interrogator, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. During the war, Jones permitted the U.S. Army to graze cattle on the grounds at Augusta National.

In 1948, Jones was diagnosed with syringomyelia, a fluid-filled cavity in the spinal cord that causes crippling pain, then paralysis; he was eventually restricted to a wheelchair. He died in Atlanta on December 18, 1971, three days after converting to Catholicism. Jones was baptized on his deathbed by Monsignor John D. Stapleton, rector of the Cathedral of Christ the King in Atlanta, and attended by the Jones family was buried in Atlanta&#x27;s historic Oakland Cemetery.

His widow Mary died less than four years later in 1975 at age 72, following the death of their son, Robert T. Jones III, of a heart attack in 1973 at age 47.

Founded in 2013, Jones Global Sports designs, develops, and sells apparel, accessories and golf equipment. The company has an exclusive, worldwide license agreement with the family of Bobby Jones (known as Jonesheirs, Inc.) for the use of the Bobby Jones name.

In 2019 the family of Bobby Jones partnered with the Chiari &amp; Syringomyelia Foundation to form the Bobby Jones Chiari &amp; Syringomyelia Foundation (Bobby Jones CSF), a nonprofit which works to raise awareness of Chiari Malformation and syringomyelia and to search for a cure. The Bobby Jones Classic golf tournament is an annual fundraiser that supports research and education efforts.

<text>James Grubbs Martin (born December 11, 1935) is an American chemist and politician who served as the 70th governor of North Carolina from 1985 to 1993. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served six terms as the U.S. representative for North Carolina&#x27;s 9th congressional district from 1973 to 1985.

Martin was the third Republican elected governor of North Carolina after Reconstruction, the second since the 1900 North Carolina gubernatorial election, and the fifth overall. As of , he was also the only Republican to serve two full terms as governor of the state.

==Early life and education==
James Grubbs Martin was born on December 11, 1935, in Savannah, and subsequently raised in South Carolina. He graduated from Davidson College in 1957 with a Bachelor of Science degree. Shortly after graduation, on June 1, he married Dorothy Ann McAulay of Charlotte, North Carolina. An avid tuba player, he was a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity and Beta Theta Pi Social Fraternity while an undergraduate at Davidson.

==Academic career==
Martin received his PhD in chemistry from Princeton University in 1960, after completing a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;Stereochemistry of the Diels-Alder reaction.&quot; He then served as an associate professor of chemistry at his alma mater Davidson College until 1972. As a professor at Davidson, he advised the school&#x27;s Young Republicans chapter.

==Political career==
Martin registered as a member of the Republican Party in 1961 or 1962. He later explained, &quot;I joined with the minority party because I felt the south needed two-party competition.&quot; In 1966, he was elected to the Mecklenburg County Board of Commissioners. He served for seven years, chairing the body from 1967 to 1968, and briefly in 1971. He was a president of the North Carolina Association of County Commissioners.

===House of Representatives (1973–1985)===
He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1972 representing the Charlotte-based 9th Congressional district. He served there for six terms. He served as a Ways and Means Committee member, and as a House Republican Research Committee chairman. He became the first elected official to receive the Charles Lathrop Parsons Award, given by the American Chemical Society for outstanding public service by an American chemist, in 1983.

In 1984, with incumbent governor Jim Hunt leaving office due to the term limit, Martin ran for the Republican nomination and won. He defeated state attorney general Rufus Edmisten by a nine-point margin. He was helped by the coattails from Ronald Reagan&#x27;s landslide re-election victory. He was also helped when Lieutenant Governor Jimmy Green endorsed him after being defeated by Edmisten in the Democratic primary. Green was from eastern North Carolina, and his endorsement helped Martin win support among conservative Democrats in that part of the state.

===Governor of North Carolina (1985–1993)===

While most political figures running for office were prone to make promises covering a wide range of issues from education to health care, Martin made one promise that garnered a lot of attention; he said he would address all of the priorities in the state, but his only promise was that construction on Interstate 40 from Raleigh to Wilmington, North Carolina would be finished before he left office. The long-neglected and last leg of I-40 from Barstow, California would open up the southeastern coastal area to the rest of the state. He was true to his promise; the last unfinished leg of I-40 was finished before the end of his first term.
Martin was easily reelected in 1988, defeating Lieutenant Governor Bob Jordan by 13 points. In so doing, he became the only member of his party to have been elected to two terms as governor of North Carolina. He was part of a 28-year trend of Governors of North Carolina who were named James, having been preceded and succeeded by Jim Hunt, who in turn was preceded in his first term by James Holshouser.

==Later life==
In 1993, Martin retired from political life and became chairman of the board of the James Cannon Research Center of Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 2012, he was appointed to lead an investigation into academic improprieties at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. For the United States presidential election in 2016, Martin endorsed fellow Republican John Kasich.

==Legacy==
In January 2017, the Pope Center for Higher Education Policy changed its name to the James G. Martin Center for Academic Renewal, named after Governor Martin. Gov. Martin also serves on the board of directors for the Martin Center.

<text>James Eubert Holshouser Jr. (October 8, 1934 – June 17, 2013) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 68th Governor of North Carolina from 1973 to 1977. He was the first Republican candidate to be elected as governor of the state since 1896. Born in Boone, North Carolina, Holshouser initially sought to become a sports journalist before deciding to pursue a law degree. While in law school he developed an interest in politics and in 1962 he was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives where he focused on restructuring government and higher education institutions, and drug abuse legislation. Made chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party in March 1966, he established the organization&#x27;s first permanent staff and gained prominence by opposing a cigarette tax.

Holshouser ran for the office of Governor of North Carolina in 1972, winning the Republican nomination and narrowly defeating his Democratic opponent in the general election. Inaugurated in January 1973, he fired many incumbent state employees to accommodate the awarding of patronage to hundreds of Republicans who had been unable to work in the state administration under Democratic control, appointed the first woman in a cabinet-level position in the state&#x27;s history, and enacted hundreds of cost-cutting measures. Though not empowered with veto power and facing a Democrat-dominated legislature, he cultivated a working relationship with Lieutenant Governor Jim Hunt. Together, they backed the expansion of the state&#x27;s kindergarten program and environmental legislation and unsuccessfully pursued the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. Holshouser governed as a pragmatic centrist, and his control over the state Republican organization was undermined by conservative supporters of U.S. Senator Jesse Helms. Leaving office in January 1977, he practiced law in Southern Pines and served on the UNC Board of Governors before dying in 2013.

== Early life==
James Eubert Holshouser Jr. was born on October 8, 1934, in Boone, North Carolina, United States, to James E. Holshouser and Virginia Dayvault Holshouser. His father was an active member of the Republican Party who attended party meetings and served on the North Carolina State Board of Elections and as a United States Attorney under President Dwight Eisenhower. His mother was a registered member of the Democratic Party, though she eventually left the party before becoming a Republican in 1972. People in Watauga County described the Holshouser family as &quot;good livers&quot;, meaning they lived comfortably and had respectable social standing. James Jr. was a sickly child and suffered from asthma and periodic afflictions of pneumonia, preventing him from pursuing an interest in sports.

Holshouser enrolled at Appalachian High School in 1948. He served as senior class president (he was elected unopposed), editor of the school newspaper, and was a member of the National Honor Society. Graduating in June 1952, he attended Davidson College for undergraduate studies, majoring in history. He edited the school newspaper, wrote for the yearbook, and was a member of a fraternity, a literary society, and the international relations club. He strongly considered becoming a sports writer, and during his senior year he worked on the sports section of &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;. He later figured making a career out of sports would cause him to tire of them, so he decided to do what his father had done and become a lawyer. He graduated from Davidson College in 1956 and enrolled at the University of North Carolina School of Law in September 1957, earning his law degree in 1960. He subsequently joined his father&#x27;s law practice in Boone and married Patricia Hollingsworth on June 17, 1961. They had one daughter, Virginia, born in 1963.

== Early political career ==

Though politics was a &quot;casual part of life&quot; in his household while growing up, Holshouser paid little interest in pursuing a political career for much of his early life. He grew more interested in public affairs while at law school, particularly in court reform. During this time he began attending sessions of the North Carolina General Assembly. In 1962 he was elected chairman of the Watauga County Young Republicans.

Holshouser was elected in November 1962 to the North Carolina House of Representatives representing Watauga County, campaigning on a platform of court reform, low taxes, and creating an automobile inspection law. He was sworn in on February 7, 1963. Throughout his tenure he focused on restructuring government and higher education institutions, and drug abuse legislation. He became the Republican floor leader in the House in 1965, thus becoming the highest-ranking Republican public official in the state. Skipping the 1967 session, he returned to the House in 1969. Made chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party in March 1966, Holshouser directed Republican Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1968 presidential campaign in North Carolina and rose to statewide prominence the following year when he opposed Governor Robert W. Scott&#x27;s plan to tax cigarettes. He also established the party organization&#x27;s first permanent staff. He retired from the party chairmanship in November 1971 to focus on a gubernatorial campaign in 1972. One of his friends, Harry S. Dent Sr., offered to help him get appointed as general counsel for the United States Navy, but he turned the offer down.

== Gubernatorial career ==
=== Election ===
Holshouser declared his candidacy for the office of Governor of North Carolina in the 1972 election on November 15, 1971. Suffering from kidney disease, he ran in spite of his doctor&#x27;s concerns about his health. In the Republican primary he faced Jim Gardner, a conservative U.S. Representative who hailed from eastern North Carolina and had run as the Republican candidate in 1968. Holshouser focused his campaign on the traditionally Republican counties in the mountainous west and the urban Piedmont. Gardner won the first primary by a small margin, 84,906 votes to Holshouser&#x27;s 83,637, while minor candidates took 2,040 votes. Holshouser called for a runoff, and in the second round voter participation dropped, giving Holshouser a victory by 1,782 votes.

Holshouser campaigned on a platform of raising teachers&#x27; salaries, reducing class sizes, expanding the public kindergarten program, building new roads, supporting a war on drugs, and opposing taxes on gasoline and tobacco. Despite the reservations of his wife, he authorized the broadcasting of an ad declaring his opposition to desegregation busing at the encouragement of his media consultant, Roger Ailes. He narrowly defeated Democrat Skipper Bowles in the general election, 767,470 votes to 729,104, likely benefitting from the coattails of Republican Richard Nixon&#x27;s large victory in North Carolina in the presidential election. Holshouser led in the traditionally-Republican mountain and western Piedmont counties, while also gaining a majority in the Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Raleigh, and Wilmington metro areas. He performed well among women and younger voters, while also appealing more to black voters than more conservative Republicans such as Gardner and U.S. Senator Jesse Helms. Bowles had also been harmed by a fractious primary. Both Republicans and Democrats generally considered Holshouser&#x27;s victory a &quot;fluke&quot;. He was inaugurated on January 5, 1973. At age 38, he was the state&#x27;s youngest governor since the 19th century and the first Republican governor since Daniel Lindsay Russell was elected in 1896.

=== Executive actions ===

Holshouser lacked executive experience upon assuming gubernatorial office, and had a tendency to react to others&#x27; proposals rather than create his own. Upon taking office, he fired many incumbent state employees to accommodate the awarding of patronage to hundreds of Republicans who had been unable to work in the state administration under Democratic control; 100 employees in the Department of Transportation were removed. Holshouser&#x27;s first executive order established the Governor&#x27;s Efficiency Study Commission. After months of study the board recommended 700 cost-cutting measures, including five-year license plates, use of compact cars by state agencies, and centralized printing services. Holshouser&#x27;s administration adopted about 600 of the suggestions, and he later estimated that the changes saved the state government $80 million annually. Holshouser also pursued a much more active role in the state budgeting process than his predecessors, regularly attending and presiding over sessions of the Advisory Budget Commission.

Holshouser issued a total of 21 executive orders during his tenure. To mitigate the effects of the 1973 oil crisis, he issued instructions to lower speed limits and reduce heating in government buildings. Citing the governor&#x27;s constitutional prerogative to reorganize departments, he moved the Office of Child Development from the Department of Administration to the Department of Health and Human Services. In 1975 he established an office in Washington, D.C., to coordinate actions between the state and federal governments. During his tenure the Executive Mansion underwent renovations, and for nine months he and his wife lived in a private residence while the work was completed. He also declined to use the governor&#x27;s office in the North Carolina State Capitol aside from ceremonial purposes.

As governor, Holshouser served as a member of the National Governors Association, chairman of the Southern Regional Education Board, co-chairman of the Coastal Plains Regional Commission, and chairman of the Southern Growth Policies Board. Concerned about citizen confusion and disillusionment with the increasing complexity of government, he created the Office of Governor&#x27;s Ombudsman on March 21, 1973, to field questions and complaints from the public about state administration. He appointed Grace Rohrer as Commissioner of the Department of Art, History and Culture, the first woman in a cabinet-level position in the state&#x27;s history, and designated a special assistant for minority affairs. He also appointed a commission to raise money to restore the Old Main building at Pembroke State University following its destruction by fire. Holshouser publicly supported the federally-backed planned community of Soul City to improve economic opportunity for blacks and boost minority electoral support for Republicans. He led a trade delegation to Moscow in September 1973. He appointed Republican James H. Carson Jr. to serve as North Carolina Attorney General in August 1974 following Democratic incumbent Robert Burren Morgan&#x27;s resignation and appointed Republican Thomas Avery Nye Jr. to become North Carolina Commissioner of Labor in September 1975 to fill a vacancy created by the death of the previous Democratic incumbent, William C. Creel. He also filled two vacancies on the North Carolina Court of Appeals and four on the North Carolina Superior Court.

=== Legislative actions ===
With no veto power over the Democratic-dominated General Assembly, Holshouser tried to avoid political conflict with legislators except over explicitly partisan issues. Party association aside, Holshouser maintained a good relationship with the Assembly, as most of its members had known him when he was a state representative, including Senate majority leader Gordon Allen and Speaker of the House James E. Ramsey. He enjoyed a good working relationship with Lieutenant Governor Jim Hunt, who held sway in the legislature, and during their first two years in office they minimized partisanship in dealing with each other. In some instances the legislature attempted to weaken the powers of his office but Allen, Ramsey, and Hunt—all aspiring to be governor one day—stopped these challenges. The legislature rejected his 1973 proposal to authorize governors to run for a consecutive term.

Holshouser came into office when North Carolina had a $265 million budget surplus, which enabled him to fulfill some of his campaign promises. He consulted Hunt on budget proposals and incorporated Hunt&#x27;s plan to expand kindergarten in the state educational system in his January 1973 budget. The plan was passed into law, and was gradually phased in so that by 1977 all children in North Carolina would be enrolled in kindergarten. His budget also expanded funding for state parks and he worked with Hunt to create the Coastal Area Management Act to control development along the Eastern Seaboard. Holshouser supported a similar bill for mountain regions, but failed to secure the support of Republican legislators to pass it. The two encouraged the state legislature to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution, but it failed approval. New legislative proposals from Holshouser decreased after the state&#x27;s budgetary situation tightened in 1975.

=== Political affairs ===

In the mid-20th century the two major political parties in North Carolina had little ideological basis; party identification was generally a matter of generational descent tracing back to loyalties from the American Civil War. By the 1970s the national Democratic Party had drifted leftward on economic and social questions, leading some southern conservative Democrats to join the Republican Party. Since 1964, the Republican Party had nationally diverged into a moderate wing and a conservative wing. Holshouser governed as a pragmatic centrist, and his control over the state party was tenuous. In the 1972 election he had campaigned independently of Helms. The two maintained cordial relations with each other, though the tensions between their respective wings for the party strained communication between them for decades. Whether they were truly of much different ideological persuasions is unknown, though public perception of each man was different. State Senator Phil Kirk opined, &quot;Holsouser is probably as conservative as Helms but not as vociferous.&quot; When asked about his beliefs, Holshouser said, &quot;I find people on the left view me as a conservative and people on the right view me as a moderate or maybe moderate conservative. I have never viewed myself left of center.&quot; A feud began in June 1973 when one of Holshouser&#x27;s close aides, Gene Anderson, fired several conservative Democrats from state office, even though they were ideologically similar to Helms&#x27; supporters. Republican Party chairman Frank Rouse, a conservative who had supported Gardner and Helms, visited Holshouser to ask him to fire Anderson. The governor refused, and successfully backed Tom Bennet to replace Rouse in the autumn of 1973.

In 1974 an electoral backlash against Republicans—in part due to the Watergate scandal—ousted many legislators in North Carolina. Holshouser&#x27;s interim appointee for attorney general, Carson, was also defeated. All of his judicial appointees, save for a single Democrat, lost re-election. The governor continued to maintain good relations with Democratic legislators, but began experiencing more opposition from Helms&#x27; wing of the Republican Party. This was in part due Holshouser&#x27;s backing of William C. Stevens—a relative of Republican Congressman Jim Broyhill—for nomination in the 1974 U.S. Senate race, instead of Helms&#x27; choice, State Senator Hamilton C. Horton. 

Holshouser and party regulars supported Gerald Ford for president in 1976, with the governor serving as Ford&#x27;s southern campaign chairman. Helms supported the more conservative Ronald Reagan, who Holshouser publicly appealed to, to drop out of the race, to preserve party unity. According to legal scholar Thomas Healy, &quot;The Republican primary in North Carolina thus became a referendum on Holshouser.&quot; The National Congressional Club, a political action committee associated with Helms, produced advertisements attacking Holshouser to bolster Reagan&#x27;s position. Reagan won the North Carolina presidential primary, and the Republican state convention—under influence from Helms—refused to appoint Holshouser or Broyhill as a delegate to the 1976 Republican National Convention. Holshouser was booed when he addressed the state Republican convention. He attended the national convention anyway, but did not sit with the North Carolina delegation. Legally restricted to one term, Holshouser was succeeded by Hunt as governor on January 8, 1977.

== Later life ==
After leaving office, Holshouser returned to the practice of law, splitting his time between firms in Boone and Southern Pines. In 1978 he moved to the latter town. He secured a pilot&#x27;s license and flew a Cessna 172 between the two locales. He worked for several years as the official attorney of the Moore County Board of Commissioners. He was elected to the Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina in 1979, and later served as a member emeritus. He also served on the Boards of St. Andrews Presbyterian College in Laurinburg and Davidson College. Continuing to suffer kidney problems that were treated with dialysis, he underwent kidney transplantation in 1986. As a result, he gave his support to organ transplant organizations and served on the board of directors of the United Network for Organ Sharing.

Holshouser joined with Hunt and former governor Terry Sanford in 1977 in supporting the amending of the North Carolina Constitution to allow gubernatorial succession. He decided against pursuing reelection to the governorship, later explaining, &quot;[My wife and I] were very, very tired by the end of 1976. And we were ready for a break from politics, ready to sort of get out of the limelight and back in the private sector because I never really anticipated a political career.&quot; Out of office he served on several steering and advisory committees for Republican gubernatorial and senatorial candidates. In 1984 he campaigned for James G. Martin&#x27;s election as governor and two years later he led a group, Citizens for a Conservative Court, which sought to block James G. Exum&#x27;s election as Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court. He also served as Gardner&#x27;s legislative liaison while the latter was lieutenant governor. In 1997 he and Sanford opened a law firm together. He served on Pat McCrory&#x27;s political transition team after the latter was elected governor.

Holshouser&#x27;s wife died in 2006. He died on the morning of June 17, 2013, at First Health of the Carolinas Medical Center in Pinehurst following a decline in his health. His body was cremated and a funeral was held for him on June 21 at Brownson Memorial Presbyterian Church in Southern Pines.

==Legacy and honors==
A building bearing Holshouser&#x27;s name was erected at the North Carolina State Fairgrounds in 1975 and a stretch of U.S. Route 321 outside of Boone was named for him in 1986. Professorships were endowed in his honor at Appalachian State University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1997 and 2012, respectively. He was accorded the North Carolina Award—the state&#x27;s highest civilian honor—for public service in 2006. His official desk is kept at the governor&#x27;s office in the Department of Administration building. Historian Karl Campbell described his record as falling &quot;well within the parameters of the moderate progressive Democratic governors who preceded him.&quot; Journalist Rob Christensen wrote, &quot;Few people played a greater role in turning North Carolina into a two-party state than Holshouser&quot;. Reflecting on his time in office, Holshouser said in an interview that his service proved that &quot;North Carolina could operate for four years with a Republican governor without the world coming to an end and without causing a major political crisis or anything like that.&quot; Hunt referred to him as one of North Carolina&#x27;s &quot;better angels&quot;.

<text>Henry Edward Ernest Victor Bliss, 4th Baron Bliss, commonly known as Baron Bliss (16 February 1869 – 9 March 1926), was a British-born traveller who willed nearly two million Belize dollars to a trust fund for the benefit of the citizens of what was then the colony of British Honduras, now Belize.

==Biography==
Baron Bliss was born in 1869 and lived in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England as a youth. His father was Henry Aldridge, who inherited the estate of his uncle Edward Bliss of Brandon, Suffolk, a manufacturer of flintlock mechanisms for guns and changed his surname to Bliss under the terms of his uncle&#x27;s will. In 1855, Henry Bliss inherited the estate and title of his cousin the Baron de Alreyo of the Kingdom of Portugal, although he was styled the Baron de Bliss due to the conditions stated in his uncle&#x27;s will. In June 1869, he was granted another bequest from Colonel Carlo Antonio Barreto of the Kingdom of Spain, with the stipulation that he change his name to Barreto, and he did so in spite of the earlier limitation from his uncle.

Henry Edward Ernest Victor de Barreto was an engineer by trade and on the death of his father in 1890, became the 4th Baron de Barreto. However, during the First World War, he reverted to his family name of Bliss, and was known afterwards as Baron Bliss. He was apparently successful in his career, but it is not known how he obtained his fortune, whether due to business acumen, inheritance, or a combination thereof.

Bliss became paralysed from the waist down in 1911 at the age of 42, likely due to polio, and was confined to a wheelchair. Despite this, he remained active. He was apparently an avid sailor, but had his yacht confiscated for war purposes during the First World War. When the war ended, he was wealthy enough to retire to a lifetime of fishing and leisure; to that end, he ordered a new 120 ft twin screw yacht from the famous Scottish yacht designer Alfred Mylne which he christened &quot;Sea King II&quot;. In 1920, he sailed the yacht to the Bahamas, where he stayed for five years. Meanwhile, his wife Baroness Ethel Alice Bliss stayed in England, living off a portion of his fortune. The couple had no children.

Although he had some property there, he eventually grew tired of Bahamanian society and decided to move on. Leaving the Bahamas behind, he sailed to Trinidad and was there for a short while when he came down with a serious bout of food poisoning. Deciding to accept a previous invitation from his friend Willoughby Bullock, who was then Attorney General of British Honduras, he sailed westward, stopping briefly in Jamaica likely for medical attention, and arriving in the Belize City harbour on 1926.

Bliss&#x27;s health appeared to improve over the next few weeks, and he spent much of this time sailing around the area in his launch, exploring the coastline and fishing. However, just days before his 57th birthday, his health took a turn for the worse, and doctors advised him that he was terminally ill. It was at this time that he decided he would leave the bulk of his fortune to the country, and signed a new draft of his will, dated . Several weeks later, he died on his yacht, never having landed on the Belize mainland. He was buried in the former site of a Spanish fortress which was extremely damaged after the Battle of St. George&#x27;s Caye in September 1798 in Belize City, what is now known as Bliss Park. This was a temporary arrangement, and he was later interred in a granite tomb near the sea, with a lighthouse nearby, built with funds from his estate. The burial instructions were explicitly stated in the will.

==The Bliss bequest==
At the time of his death, Bliss&#x27;s fortune was worth nearly (about ). About $480,000 was claimed by the United Kingdom in inheritance taxes. His will gave specific instructions on how the money was to be used to the benefit of the citizens of British Honduras. Aside from small lifetime annuities to his wife and relatives in England and to his personal staff, the remainder of the funds was placed in a trust, executed by the Governor, the Colonial Secretary, and the Attorney General.

The original money was to be invested in British stocks and securities, and only the interest earned could be spent, and even that could not be spent on churches, dance halls or schools, except agricultural and vocational ones. One-hundred pounds sterling was to be set aside annually for a regatta, which has since been held every year on Baron Bliss Day. A peculiar condition attached to the money was that no American may be a trustee or an employee of a trustee. No explanation was given.

Over the years, the trust has provided more than to fund projects, including the Bliss Institute, Bliss School of Nursing, and other capital projects across the country. , the fund was still worth roughly .

==National Heroes and Benefactors Day==
Soon after his death, the government declared to be Baron Bliss Day, a national public holiday. This was later renamed to National Heroes and Benefactors Day, and is now observed the Monday closest to , unless it falls on a Saturday or it has been moved by decree. In 2024 the holiday date was 11 March.

<text>Robert Walter &quot;Bob&quot; Scott (June 13, 1929 – January 23, 2009) was an American politician who served as the 67th Governor of North Carolina from 1969 to 1973. He was born and died in Haw River, North Carolina.

The son of North Carolina Governor W. Kerr Scott and First Lady Mary White Scott, and grandson and nephew of state legislators, Scott was a dairy farmer.

== Early life ==
Scott was born in the rural community of Haw River, Alamance County, NC to W. Kerr Scott and Mary White Scott, and grew up on the family dairy farm. His father Kerr became very prominent in North Carolina politics, serving as the state&#x27;s Agriculture Commissioner, Governor and as a US Senator. After high school, Bob Scott attended Duke University and North Carolina State College (now NC State University) - from which he graduated in 1952. He was married to Jessie Rae Osborne in 1951 and they had five children. Their daughter Meg Scott Phipps, would become an NC Commissioner of Agriculture. From 1953 to 1955 Scott served in the US Army Counter Intelligence Corps. In 1959 Scott and his wife were voted by the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry as one of the five top &quot;Young Grange Couples&quot; in the country.

== Lieutenant governor ==
=== 1964 campaign and election ===
In September 1963, the progressive wing of the North Carolina Democratic Party, led by Governor Terry Sanford and Bert Bennett, decided that they would support L. Richardson Preyer in the next gubernatorial election. The decision upset many Branchhead Boys and surprised Scott, who thought Preyer would be unpopular in eastern North Carolina. The following month Scott resigned from his position as head of the state Grange and began traveling across North Carolina to investigate his chances of winning a gubernatorial race. After deciding that the possibility was slim, he called a press conference in January 1964 to declare he would not seek the office of governor but would not rule out running for another office. In discussions with his advisers, Scott decided that he would not seek to become Commissioner of Agriculture like his father, deeming it to be a post of diminishing importance. He proposed seeking the office of Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina, though one of his advisers dismissed it as a &quot;dead end&quot;. A week later his advisers changed their perception of the position, and several days after that Scott declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination to the office. In his announcement he criticized the controversial Speaker Ban Law, a statute passed by the legislature late in the 1963 session that prevented members of the Communist Party and alleged subversives from delivering speeches at state universities. He called the law &quot;not satisfactory&quot; and said it portrayed university officials in a negative fashion. In the primary Scott faced Speaker of the State House of Representatives Clifton Blue and State Senator John Jordan.

Scott fashioned himself as a progressive, opposing the death penalty and calling for increased expenditure on roads and schools. He and the rest of the candidates maintained neutrality in the Democratic gubernatorial race between liberal L. Richardson Preyer and conservative Dan K. Moore. Scott&#x27;s uncle, state legislator Ralph Scott, was a leading progressive critic of Moore and frequently attacked him in speeches. The criticism was so vigorous that Scott released a statement distancing himself from his uncle&#x27;s politics. In the primary election Scott placed first, earning 306,992 votes (44 percent) to Blue&#x27;s 255,424 votes (36 percent), while Jordan placed third. Scott&#x27;s victory was aided by the support of courthouse machines, including the Ponder machine in Madison County. As Scott had not earned a 50 percent majority to be declared the victor outright, Blue called for a runoff, criticising the role of machines in Scott&#x27;s performance. When Blue attempted to draw attention to voting irregularities in Madison County, Scott retorted that Blue had received aide from courthouse machines in Durham and Buncombe counties. As the two competed in the runoff, Scott secured the support of organized labor and criticized private power companies in an attempt to gain the sympathies of members of rural electric cooperatives.

In the Democratic primary runoff, Scott won 371,605 votes to Blue&#x27;s 356,400 votes, thus securing the Democratic nomination. As in the first primary, he was aided by courthouse machines. Scott subsequently attended the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He expressed reservations about President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s decision to choose Senator Hubert Humphrey as his running mate in the vice-presidential spot on the national Democratic ticket, but in September agreed to chair the Rural Americans for Johnson-Humphrey political action committee. In this capacity Scott frequently criticized Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater&#x27;s policies in favor of reducing price supports for crops and opposing government spending on rural development, saying that his choices would harm the South&#x27;s economy. Though it was uncommon for a presidential candidate to criticize a lieutenant gubernatorial candidate, Goldwater responded by attacking Scott&#x27;s connections with alleged socialists. In the November election Scott defeated the Republican lieutenant gubernatorial candidate, Clifford Bell, earning 61 percent of the votes. Moore was elected Governor of North Carolina, and Johnson was reelected President.

=== Tenure ===
Scott was sworn in as Lieutenant Governor on January 8, 1965. He was the first person to hold the office since the previous incumbent, Harvey Cloyd Philpott, had died on August 19, 1961. The office held legislative powers, as its holder presided over the North Carolina Senate and had the responsibility of appointing legislators to committees and referring bills to them. The Lieutenant Governor was also &quot;ex officio&quot; a member of the State Board of Education. Scott commuted daily from his home in Haw River to Raleigh for work. In lieu of his own firm program, Scott generally supported Moore&#x27;s policies, though the two came from different ideological factions in the Democratic Party and never shared a close personal relationship. Scott backed Moore&#x27;s initiatives for a road construction bond issue and reform of state courts. He also supported Moore&#x27;s quiet attempts to reform the Speaker Ban Law. Ralph Scott accused Moore of not doing enough to repeal the speaker law. Bob Scott, seeking to portray himself as a centrist, publicly distanced himself from his uncle and defended Moore&#x27;s leadership. Scott presided over the Senate when the General Assembly was called to a special session to redraw North Carolina&#x27;s legislative districts, as stipulated by federal court decisions related to the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot; and the doctrine of one man, one vote.

Scott largely used his time as Lieutenant Governor to prepare for a future gubernatorial bid. He delivered 203 speeches in 1965 and 245 the following year. He avoided controversial issues in his orations, and was concerned by the growing white backlash in the South in response to federal support for civil rights. In May 1967 he convened a meeting of advisers who told him that in order to ensure a successful gubernatorial bid in 1968 he would have to shed his reputation as a liberal. Taking their advice, Scott traveled to Dunn in November and gave a speech on law and order, strongly criticising civil rights protest violence, anti-Vietnam War demonstrators, and the black power movement. Jesse Helms praised Scott&#x27;s address, but it was denounced by several state newspapers. In June 1968, a cross was burned on Scott&#x27;s lawn in Haw River.

== Governor ==

Scott was elected governor in 1968, taking office on January 3, 1969. In May 1969, during his term as governor, racial violence at North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State University, a predominantly black campus in Greensboro, resulted in one student death, and the injury of a National Guardsman, five Greensboro police officers and two students.

On June 26, 1972, Scott created the Executive Cabinet, an advisory body consisting of the members of the North Carolina Council of State, the appointed secretaries of the state&#x27;s executive departments, and miscellaneous members appointed by the governor. He was succeeded by James Holshouser on January 5, 1973.

== Later life ==
Constitutionally barred from seeking another term, Scott later served as co-chairman of the Appalachian Regional Commission and as President of the North Carolina Community College System, from 1983 until 1995. He unsuccessfully ran for governor in 1980, losing in the Democratic primary to Jim Hunt.

His daughter, Meg Scott Phipps served as North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture from 2001 to 2003.

Scott was honored in 2008 by the North Carolina Society for preserving state archives and historic artifacts and his efforts to increase awareness of the state&#x27;s history.

Scott died in 2009 at the age of 79 and is buried in Hawfields Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Mebane, North Carolina.

His father&#x27;s farm and birthplace, the Kerr Scott Farm, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

<text>Robert William Henry Scott (6 February 1921 – 16 November 2012) was a New Zealand rugby union player who represented the All Blacks between 1946 and 1954.

==Early years==
Born in Wellington, New Zealand, and one of six children, Scott had a difficult childhood. His father had served with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in Gallipoli during the First World War where he was chronically wounded. Although his father was employed money was scarce and Scott frequently went hungry. His father was employed by the Public Works Department, and the family moved to Kapuni, then Tangarakau and later Ōhura. When Scott was nine in 1930 his parents split up and he moved into a Salvation Army children&#x27;s home, Cecilia Whatman Home in Masterton. Although after two years the parents reconciled, it was short-lived, and they separated permanently within a year. Scott stayed with his father while his five siblings were sent again to a children&#x27;s home. Scott worked part-time and went to school until his father died of cancer in 1934. After his father&#x27;s death he moved back with his mother, who had established a home with his siblings.

==Rugby league career==
Scott started his footballing career playing rugby league for the Ponsonby club in the Auckland Rugby League competition. Scott switched codes during the Second World War.

==Army==
After working in a warehouse from the age of 13 he enlisted in the New Zealand Army when the Second World War started. He was posted to the Motor Transport Pool in Auckland. They had a team which entered Auckland&#x27;s senior rugby union competition, and in 1942 won the Gallaher Shield with a team dominated by rugby league players after the Auckland Rugby League had refused to allow the side to enter the Auckland Rugby League competition due to so many of the players being registered with rugby league clubs already. In 1942 he was posted to Egypt with the Army Service Corps in the New Zealand Division as a truck driver. He served in North Africa and Italy, and described driving trucks of ammunition to the front lines as the most lonely experience of his life.

Company rugby teams within the New Zealand Division competed in a tournament called the Freyberg Cup – named after Lieutenant-General Bernard Freyberg who commanded the division. Scott was in the Ammunition Company team that made the Freyberg Cup final in 1944. Although they lost the final to the 22nd Division, Scott, who played at fullback was selected to trial for the Army&#x27;s &quot;Kiwis&quot; team.

During World War II, he served in Italy and was one of the players in the New Zealand Army rugby team along with Bob Stuart as fullback.

==All Blacks==
As an All Black he made his debut in 1946 against Australia. He toured South Africa in 1949 where he played in all four test matches. He also played against the 1950 British and Irish Lions. He did not play in the 1951 tour of Australia and announced his retirement from first-class rugby that year.

He was bribed to play one game for the Auckland union in 1952. He then played for the Petone club in Wellington during 1954.

In a publication he was described as: &quot;for me (author) there will never be anyone as great as Scott. The man amazed me even in his final moments. His positional play was of course something out of the box. He was a genius and what other fullbacks had to do, Scott didn&#x27;t, because he had the greatest balance, the greatest poise, that I&#x27;ve ever seen in any man.&quot;

In his autobiography, Hennie Muller stated: &quot;Scott always appeared to have plenty of time, even under pressure. He loved coming into the line and his speed and elusiveness were such that he was always a danger. Altogether, the greatest player I&#x27;ve ever played in any position.&quot;

Scott was part of the Petone club committee between 1966 and 1970.

==Later years==
In 1990 Scott was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame, and in the 1995 New Year Honours he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to rugby and the community. Following the death of Fred Allen in April 2012, Scott was the oldest living All Black. He died on 16 November 2012 at his home in Whangamatā, New Zealand, where he lived during his later years.

<text>Battle of the Network Stars is a series of competitions in which television stars from ABC, CBS and NBC would compete in various sporting events. A total of 19 of these competitions were held between 1976 and 1988, all of which were aired by ABC.

In 2003, NBC attempted to revive &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot; with a two-hour special.

In 2005, Bravo premiered a revived version of the show named &quot;Battle of the Network Reality Stars&quot;. Also in 2005, ESPN premiered a sports-themed spinoff version of &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot; as &quot;Battle of the Gridiron Stars&quot; featuring twenty players from the AFC and NFC competing in a variety of tasks that had nothing to do with football.

In 2017, ABC revived the series as a summer series; which ran from June 29 to September 7, 2017.

== Broadcast history ==
The first Battle was broadcast on ABC starting in November 1976. The program proved popular and continued for an additional eight and a half years, with subsequent episodes airing approximately every six months until May 1985. One final competition aired in December 1988. NBC tried to revive the competition in August 2003 with Tony Potts as host, but with an intra-network contest consisting of personalities from the NBC family of networks. Typically, episodes were aired twice per calendar year, once during the spring and once during the fall during Nielsen Ratings sweeps weeks.

Sports broadcaster Howard Cosell hosted or co-hosted all but one of the first nineteen competitions (he did not host the 1985 edition due to a falling-out with ABC, but he returned for the final edition in 1988), and commented on the action with a semi-serious version of the style for which he was famous.

When ABC revived the program as a weekly series in 2017, Mike Greenberg and Joe Tessitore took over the hosting duties. Furthermore, each episode began with a remake of the opening sequence of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;.

== Format ==
=== 1976–1988 ===
All but one of the competitions took place at the sports facilities of Pepperdine University near Malibu, California, the exception being XVIII which was held in Ixtapa, Mexico.

Each network was represented by eight or ten of its stars from various series, and one of those people from each team would be elected to serve as the network&#x27;s team captain.

Some of the events were modeled after those used on &quot;The Superstars&quot;, another Trans World-ABC production that featured athletes from all sports competing against each other for an overall title. Regular events included swimming, kayaking, volleyball, golf, tennis, bowling (on custom-made outdoor lanes), cycling, 3-on-3 football, the baseball dunk, running, and the obstacle course. Also featured as a regular event was a game of &quot;Simon Says&quot;, directed by Catskill hotel Grossinger&#x27;s entertainer Lou Goldstein. Each network received points based on how it performed in the event.

After the regular events were over, the lowest scoring network was eliminated from further competition and the two remaining networks determined the day&#x27;s winner with the final event, the Tug of War.

=== 2017 ===
Two teams of five celebrities compete each week with a professional athlete as their coach (The coaches return throughout the season). The teams are typically assigned based on the genre or role of the celebrities&#x27; notable TV credits. For example, one episode pitted prime-time soap opera stars against actors associated with comedies, while another had had actors who played lawyers vs. those who played White House employees. Teams often include at least one veteran actor or actress who previously competed in the original &quot;Battle of the Network Stars&quot; and archive footage of their previous appearance(s) is shown. The venue remains Pepperdine University, as was the original.

==Episodes==
===Battle of the Network Stars I (Nov. 13, 1976)===
===Battle of the Network Stars II (Feb. 28, 1977)===
This edition aired under the title &quot;Challenge of the Network Stars.&quot;
===Battle of the Network Stars III (Nov. 4, 1977)===
===Battle of the Network Stars IV (May 7, 1978)===
===Battle of the Network Stars V (Nov. 18, 1978)===
===Battle of the Network Stars VI (May 7, 1979)===
===Battle of the Network Stars VII (Nov. 2, 1979)===
===Battle of the Network Stars VIII (May 4, 1980)===
===Battle of the Network Stars IX (Dec. 5, 1980)===
===Battle of the Network Stars X (May 8, 1981)===
===Battle of the Network Stars XI (Nov. 20, 1981)===
===Battle of the Network Stars XII (May 5, 1982)===
===Battle of the Network Stars XIII (Oct. 1, 1982)===
===Battle of the Network Stars XIV (May 4, 1983)===
===Battle of the Network Stars XV (Nov. 3, 1983)===
===Battle of the Network Stars XVI (May 3, 1984)===
===Battle of the Network Stars XVII (Dec. 20, 1984)===
===Battle of the Network Stars XVIII (May 23, 1985)===
===Battle of the Network Stars XIX (Dec. 10, 1988)===
Total overall wins – ABC: 7, CBS: 6, NBC: 6

===Battle of the Network Stars (2017)===
For this edition, rather than the standard network vs. network format, fielding of the teams is based on the TV characters attributed to each celebrity—cops vs. TV sitcoms, White House vs. lawyers, TV moms &amp; dads vs. TV kids, etc.

<text>Daniel Killian Moore (April 2, 1906September 7, 1986) was the 66th Governor of the state of North Carolina from 1965 to 1969.

==Life and career==
Daniel Killian Moore was born in Asheville, North Carolina, on April 2, 1906 to Fred Moore and Lela Enloe. His father was a superior court judge. Upon his death two year&#x27;s after Dan&#x27;s birth, the family moved to Jackson County.

Moore earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in commerce in 1927 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a law degree in 1929 from the University of North Carolina School of Law where he was a member of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and was selected to Phi Beta Kappa. He practiced law in Sylva, North Carolina and served a term in the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1941 before entering the U.S. Army in 1943 during World War II. While in the army, he served in the medical and judge advocate departments, with 13 months of service in Europe. He was discharged in October 1945 as an enlisted soldier. After the war, Moore served as a North Carolina Superior Court judge from 1948 to 1958. Subsequently, Moore served as counsel for the Champion Papers company in Canton, North Carolina, while also serving on the state Board of Water Resources. He left Champion to run for Governor in 1964. He was seen as the moderate in the Democratic primary, between the conservative I. Beverly Lake, Sr. and the more progressive L. Richardson Preyer. Moore won a primary runoff with Preyer. He was sworn in on January 8, 1965.

After serving one term as governor (North Carolina governors were not then eligible to be re-elected), Moore&#x27;s successor, Governor Robert W. Scott, appointed him to the North Carolina Supreme Court, the first governor of North Carolina to be so honored. He served on the Court from November 20, 1969 until December 31, 1978. As a judge and justice, he was noted for the breadth of his legal experience, common sense, and compassion.

At the 1968 Democratic National Convention Moore received 17½ votes for president on the first ballot, finishing fifth behind Vice President Hubert Humphrey (1,760½), Senator Eugene McCarthy (601), Sen. George McGovern (146½), and Rev. Channing E. Phillips (67½). Moore received 12 of North Carolina&#x27;s 59 votes, 3 from Virginia, 2 from Georgia and ½ vote from Alabama.

In May 1986, the last year of his life, Moore had a section of Interstate 40 named after him. (citation in next section)

==Death and memorial==

Moore died Sunday, September 7, 1986 at the age of 80 at Duke Medical Center in Durham (now known as a part of Duke University Hospital) Hospital officials and family members declined to give the cause of death but it is known that he had cancer and had been undergoing chemotherapy at Duke Medical Center prior to his death. Moore was admitted to Duke Medical on August 30 and remained there until his death at 2:10 pm. The Funeral was at Edenton Street United Methodist Church in Raleigh and he was buried in Historic Oakwood Cemetery in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Some statements made by friends and family include one from governor at the time James G. Martin in which he stated &quot;The passing of Dan K. Moore is a sad loss to North Carolina. Mrs. Martin and I have lost a good friend. He and his dear wife, Jeanelle, have been an inspirational example to us in so many ways. His firm and steady leadership and his many years of service as governor and judge have been a blessing to the people of the state. We will miss him&quot;. Former governor Jim Hunt said: &quot;His accomplishments in judicial excellence, economic development and programs for youth are of a poorer state with the passing of this decent and civilized leader.&quot; Susie Sharp, the chief justice when Moore served as a Supreme Court Justice stated &quot;He is one of the finest people I ever knew- Dan was a very steady person. You couldn&#x27;t stampede him. That was even so in law school&quot;. Former governor James Holshouser said: &quot;Not only did he do an able job as governor, but he was an honest, decent human being. I think his service to the state was exemplary.&quot; Holshouser goes on to state that after Governor Sanford, Moore&#x27;s leadership methods were &quot;very welcome at that time&quot;.

The family of Moore requested that in lieu of flowers, memorial contributions be made in his name as a Scholarship to The University of North Carolina School of Law (see Dan K. Moore program in Ethics)

On April 1, 2017, a North Carolina historical marker was dedicated at Mark Watson Park, in Sylva, North Carolina, in recognition of Moore&#x27;s significant impact on the state&#x27;s judicial system. The marker was unveiled by his children, Edith Moore Hamilton and Daniel Killian Moore Jr.

Representative David McKee Hall was a nephew of Governor Moore. Portraits of the two men hang today in the Jackson County Library in Sylva.

<text>The Miracles (known as [[Smokey Robinson]] and the Miracles from 1965 to 1972) were an American vocal group formed in Detroit, Michigan in 1955. They were the first successful recording act for Motown Records and are considered one of the most important and most influential groups in the history of pop, soul, rhythm and blues and rock and roll music. The group&#x27;s international fame in the 1960s, alongside other Motown acts, led to a greater acceptance of R&amp;B and pop music in the U.S., with the group being considered influential and important in the development of modern popular music.

The group was formed as The Five Chimes and changed their name to the Miracles in 1958, by which time their lineup consisted of Smokey Robinson, Claudette Rogers (later Robinson), Bobby Rogers, Warren &quot;Pete&quot; Moore, Marv Tarplin, and Ronnie White. Referred to as Motown&#x27;s &quot;soul supergroup&quot;, the Miracles recorded more than 50 chart hits, including 26 Top 40 pop hits, 16 of which reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Top 20, seven Top 10 singles, and a number-one single (1967&#x27;s &quot;The Tears of a Clown&quot;) while the Robinsons and Tarplin were members. Following the departure of Tarplin and the Robinsons, the rest of the group continued with singer Billy Griffin and manager Martin Pichinson, who helped rebuild the Miracles. They scored two final Top 20 singles, &quot;Do It Baby&quot; (1974) and &quot;Love Machine&quot; (1975), a second No. 1 hit, which topped the charts before the group departed for Columbia Records in 1977. Recording as a quintet at Columbia with Billy&#x27;s brother Donald Griffin replacing Marv Tarplin, after a few releases, they disbanded in 1978. The group have won numerous music industry awards, including four songs inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, several BMI and ASCAP Songwriters&#x27; Awards, and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

On the R&amp;B charts, the Miracles scored 26 Top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B hits, with four R&amp;B No. 1&#x27;s, and 11 U.S. R&amp;B Top 10 Albums, including two No. 1&#x27;s. Bobby Rogers and Ronald White revived the group as a touring ensemble sporadically during the 1980s and again in the 1990s. Following White&#x27;s death in 1995, Rogers continued to tour with different members until he was forced into retirement due to health issues in 2011, dying less than two years later. Smokey Robinson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist in 1987, and much controversy ensued over the Miracles&#x27; omission from the Hall. The Miracles were finally inducted into the Hall of Fame by lead singer Robinson in 2012.

==History==

===Initial career and success===
The group that later became the Miracles was formed in 1955 by five teenage friends from Detroit, Michigan, under the name the Five Chimes. Three of the founding members, Smokey Robinson, Warren &quot;Pete&quot; Moore, and Ronnie White, had been singing together since they each were around the age of eleven. The group, influenced by acts such as Billy Ward and His Dominoes and Nolan Strong &amp; the Diablos, featured Clarence Dawson and James Grice in the original lineup. All of the group&#x27;s original members attended Northern High School in Detroit. After Dawson quit the group and Grice dropped out to get married, they were replaced by Emerson &quot;Sonny&quot; Rogers and his cousin Bobby and changed their name to the Matadors. Coincidentally, both Smokey Robinson and Bobby Rogers were born in the same hospital on the same date (February 19, 1940), despite not actually meeting each other until they were fifteen. In 1957, Sonny Rogers left to join the United States Army and Claudette Rogers, his sister, who had been singing with the sister group the Matadorettes, joined them shortly afterwards, and in 1958, the group became the Miracles. Following two years of courtship, Smokey and Claudette married in November 1959.

The group&#x27;s extensive work with Berry Gordy and Tamla Records gave the parent label Motown Record Corporation its first million-selling hit record with the 1960 &quot;Grammy Hall of Fame&quot; smash, &quot;Shop Around&quot;, and further established themselves as one of Motown&#x27;s top acts with the hit singles &quot;You&#x27;ve Really Got a Hold on Me&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s So Good About Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Way Over There&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Try Something New&quot;, &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Monkey&quot;, &quot;Going to a Go-Go&quot;, &quot;(Come &#x27;Round Here) I&#x27;m the One You Need&quot;, &quot;The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Mirage&quot;, &quot;If You Can Want&quot;, &quot;More Love&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Blame You at All&quot;, &quot;Ooo Baby Baby&quot;, the multi-award-winning &quot;The Tracks of My Tears&quot;, &quot;My Girl Has Gone&quot;, &quot;Special Occasion&quot;, &quot;I Second That Emotion&quot;, &quot;Baby Baby Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;, the number-one Pop smashes &quot;The Tears of a Clown&quot; and &quot;Love Machine&quot;, &quot;Do It Baby&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;s What Love Is Made Of&quot;, among numerous other hits.

The group auditioned for Brunswick Records in front of Alonzo Tucker (an original member of the Midnighters who had since left the group to join Jackie Wilson&#x27;s management team), Nat Tarnopol (Jackie Wilson&#x27;s manager) and one of the label&#x27;s staff songwriters, Berry Gordy, who remained quiet during the audition. Tucker was unimpressed by the audition, stating that because there was the Platters that &quot;there couldn&#x27;t be two groups in America like that with a woman in the group.&quot; After the Tarnopol and Tucker rejection, Gordy followed them and soon agreed to work with the group after discovering Robinson&#x27;s notebook full of songs he had written and having been impressed with Robinson&#x27;s singing voice.

Gordy recorded their first single, &quot;Got a Job&quot;, an answer song to the Silhouettes&#x27; &quot;Get a Job&quot; in January 1958. Gordy shortly thereafter struck a deal with George Goldner&#x27;s End Records to distribute the single. Before the song was released, the group changed their name to the Miracles, taking it from the moniker &quot;Miracletones&quot;, with the &quot;&#x27;Tones&quot; taken out. This first Miracles&#x27; single became a Top 10 National R&amp;B Hit, peaking at #5, although it missed the Pop Hot 100. (see Miracles&#x27; Discography) .After earning only $3.19 for his production success, Gordy was told by Robinson to form his own label, which Gordy did, forming Tamla Records in 1959. One of the Miracles&#x27; first Tamla singles, the ballad &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, became the Miracles&#x27; first song to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Pop chart that October when it was licensed to and issued nationally by Chess Records. The next Miracles song, &quot;It&quot;, was credited to &quot;Ron &amp; Bill&quot;, in a duet between White and Robinson, and was released on Tamla and nationally picked by Chess subsidiary Argo Records. Following a dismal reception at the Apollo Theater in 1959, Robinson recruited guitarist Marv Tarplin to join them on a few touring dates after Tarplin played with the Primettes (later the Supremes), with Tarplin officially joining the Miracles shortly afterwards. The addition of Tarplin was the final element in making the Miracles&#x27; &quot;classic lineup&quot; complete.

In 1960, the Miracles reached the charts with &quot;Way Over There&quot;, their second national hit, which Robinson wrote and based on the Isley Brothers&#x27; &quot;Shout&quot;. Later that year, the Miracles released &quot;Shop Around&quot;, backed with &quot;Who&#x27;s Lovin&#x27; You&quot;, which became the group&#x27;s first smash hit, reaching number one on the R&amp;B charts, number two on the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot;, and number one on the &quot;Cash Box Magazine &quot;Top 100&quot;&quot; Pop Chart, and was the first Motown single to sell a million copies. Both sides of this record became classics, and standards for R&amp;B and rock musicians alike for several decades afterwards.

As a result of this success, the Miracles became the first Motown act to appear on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot; on December 27, 1960. The Miracles had modest success with their next few singles, including &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Baby&quot;, &quot;Mighty Good Lovin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Brokenhearted&quot; and &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Gotta Pay Some Dues&quot;, as 1961 continued. During this early period, the group suffered some problems as Robinson caught Asian Flu and had to be bedded for a month, leaving wife Claudette Robinson to lead the Miracles on tour until he recovered. Claudette herself had her share of problems, having suffered her first miscarriage that occurred after a car accident and Pete Moore was drafted to serve in the United States Army. The group&#x27;s next charted successes included &quot;What&#x27;s So Good About Goodbye&quot;, and the string-laden &quot;I&#x27;ll Try Something New&quot;.

The Miracles have been awarded many top music industry honors over the years. In 1997, the group received the Pioneer Award at the Rhythm and Blues Foundation for their musical achievements. Four years later, in 2001, they were inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. In 2004, they were ranked No. 32 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, retaining that same position seven years later, in 2011. Four of their hit songs were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame (The most of any Motown group). In 2009, the group received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Throughout their careers, the Miracles were also enshrined with honors for their songwriting by both BMI and ASCAP. In 2008, &quot;Billboard&quot; listed them at No. 61 on their 100 most successful Billboard artists ever list.

===&quot;The Showstoppers&quot;===
The group reached the Top 10 again with &quot;You&#x27;ve Really Got a Hold on Me&quot; (another Grammy Hall of Fame-inducted hit) in 1962, featuring lead vocals by Smokey Robinson and Bobby Rogers. (This song actually began life as the &quot;B&quot; side to the group&#x27;s &quot;intended&quot; &quot;A&quot; side, &quot;Happy Landing&quot;, but the nation&#x27;s Dee Jays flipped the song over, because they liked &quot;Hold on Me&quot; better). The Miracles hit the Top 10 still a third time the following year with the exciting Holland-Dozier-Holland-written-and-produced song &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Monkey&quot;. The group&#x27;s exciting live performances were so well received, they were often referred to as &quot;The Showstoppers&quot;. The Miracles&#x27; success paved the way for all future Motown stars, and, as Motown&#x27;s first group, they would serve as the prototype for all other Motown groups to follow. The Miracles had become a national sensation, and their success catapulted them to the position of Motown&#x27;s top-selling act, making them headliners at the nationwide Motortown Revue package touring shows, which showcased Motown artists, and that started around late 1962.

The Miracles were also the first Motown act to receive coaching and instruction from famed choreographer Cholly Atkins, who had previously worked with Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials, the Cadillacs, and future Motown act Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips. (Bobby Rogers, the Miracles&#x27; best dancer, did choreography for the group prior to Atkins&#x27; arrival). Through his association with the Miracles, Atkins came into Motown at their insistence, and soon became the official in-house choreographer for &quot;all&quot; of the company&#x27;s acts, including the Temptations, the Marvelettes, the Four Tops, the Contours, Martha &amp; the Vandellas, and the Supremes.

===Songwriting===

In addition to penning their own material, Miracles Robinson, White, Rogers, Tarplin, and Moore wrote for many of their labelmates as well. Motown hits written, but not recorded, by members of the Miracles include songs for the Temptations (&quot;The Way You Do The Things You Do&quot;, &quot;My Girl&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, &quot;Since I Lost My Baby&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Growing&quot;, &quot;Get Ready&quot;, &quot;My Baby&quot;), Mary Wells (&quot;My Guy&quot;, &quot;The One Who Really Loves You&quot;, &quot;What Love Has Joined Together&quot;, &quot;Two Lovers&quot;), Marvin Gaye (&quot;I&#x27;ll Be Doggone&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Peculiar&quot;, &quot;One More Heartache&quot;), the Marvelettes (&quot;Don&#x27;t Mess With Bill&quot;, &quot;My Baby Must Be a Magician&quot;, &quot;The Hunter Gets Captured by the Game&quot;), The Contours (&quot;First I Look at the Purse&quot;), and Brenda Holloway (&quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot;). Unlike other Motown artists, whose songs were written for them by staff songwriters, the Miracles were one of the few Motown acts that composed their own songs, adding to the group&#x27;s already impressive reputation.

Around 1964, Smokey Robinson became Motown&#x27;s vice president, while the other members of the Miracles also began to work staff jobs with the company. Smokey and Claudette Robinson made plans to begin a family, but the rough life of touring caused Claudette to have several miscarriages. In early 1964, Claudette decided to retire from the road and remain at home in Detroit after another miscarriage, her sixth. From this point on, Claudette did not tour with the Miracles or appear in any official group photographs or on television, although she remained as a non-touring member of the Miracles, and continued to sing backup with the group in the studio until 1972. 

After Claudette Robinson&#x27;s departure, the remaining Miracles appeared on &quot;the T.A.M.I. Show&quot;, a landmark 1964 concert film released by American International Pictures that included performances by numerous popular rock and roll and R&amp;B musicians from the United States and England, filmed and recorded live at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on October 28 and 29, 1964. This film had theatrical release in theatres across the United States, and also included performances by fellow Motown artists the Supremes and Marvin Gaye, along with Chuck Berry, Lesley Gore, the Beach Boys, the Rolling Stones, and James Brown and the Famous Flames. The Miracles&#x27; performance was one of the show&#x27;s highlights, called &quot;athletically electrifying&quot; by critics. Miracles chart hit singles that year included &quot;That&#x27;s What Love Is Made Of&quot; and &quot;I Like It Like That&quot;. In early 1965, the group released Motown Records&#x27; first double album, &quot;The Miracles Greatest Hits from the Beginning&quot;, which was a success on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Pop and R&amp;B Album Charts. Also in 1965, the Miracles released their landmark Top 10 album, &quot;Going to a Go-Go&quot;, under the new group name of &quot;Smokey Robinson and the Miracles&quot;. This album launched four Top 20 singles into the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including the landmark million-selling &quot;Grammy Hall of Fame&quot; single, &quot;The Tracks of My Tears&quot;, &quot;Ooo Baby Baby&quot;, &quot;Going to a Go-Go&quot; and &quot;My Girl Has Gone&quot;, all of which became Top 10 R&amp;B hit singles as well. During this period, their music had also made its way abroad, influencing several British groups along the way. The effects of this influence soon became even more pronounced when the Beatles, the Hollies, the Zombies, the Who, and the Rolling Stones all began recording covers of Miracles hits. Members of the Beatles, in particular, publicly stated that the music of the Miracles had greatly influenced their own.

Around this time, the group had begun performing in nightclubs and other high-profile venues after years on the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit. According to an &quot;Ebony&quot; article on the group, the group began grossing $150,000 a year due to royalties and personal investments. They also were making between $100,000 and $250,000 for nightly shows. In addition, the Miracles appeared on many of the popular variety television programs of the period, including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;Shindig!&quot;, &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Where The Action Is&quot;, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;The Andy Williams Show&quot;,&quot;Teen Town&quot;,&quot;Hollywood A Go-Go&quot;, &quot;Upbeat&quot;, and Britain&#x27;s &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;. The Miracles&#x27; success continued with several hits including &quot;(Come &#x27;Round Here) I&#x27;m the One You Need&quot;, &quot;More Love&quot;, &quot;Special Occasion&quot;, &quot;If You Can Want&quot;, and the Top 10 hit &quot;I Second That Emotion&quot;. Around this time, the group was starting to be billed as &quot;Smokey Robinson and the Miracles&quot; on several of their albums. The name change did not appear on their singles until the release of &quot;The Love I Saw in You Was Just a Mirage&quot;, a Top 20 hit released in 1967. On that song&#x27;s flipside was the tune &quot;Come Spy with Me&quot;. The Miracles sang the original theme to the 1967 20th Century Fox film of the same name.

The year 1968 brought a second &quot;greatest hits&quot; collection, &quot;The Miracles Greatest Hits, Vol. 2&quot;, which was the group&#x27;s second Top 10 album, which featured the most popular singles from their successful &quot;Going to a Go-Go&quot;, &quot;Away We A Go-Go&quot; and &quot;Make It Happen&quot; albums of the 1965–67 period. Also in 1968, the group released their hit album &quot;Special Occasion&quot; which spawned three Top 40 singles, including the smash &quot;If You Can Want&quot;, which the group performed on their first appearance on CBS&#x27; &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, at the time considered television&#x27;s top talent and entertainment showcase.
However, due to constant changes in the music industry and Motown, by 1969, Smokey Robinson sought to leave the Miracles and the stage, to settle for continued work as Motown&#x27;s vice president as well as become more of a family man to his wife Claudette and their children. The year 1969 had brought a second &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; appearance for the group, singing their then-current singles &quot;Doggone Right&quot;, and their hit cover of Dion&#x27;s &quot;Abraham, Martin and John&quot;. Robinson&#x27;s departure plans however, were thwarted after the group&#x27;s 1969 song &quot;Baby Baby Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Top 10, and when the Miracles&#x27; 1967 song, &quot;The Tears of a Clown&quot;,(their &quot;fourth Grammy Hall of Fame-&quot;inducted hit) was released as a single in 1970, it became a number-one hit in the UK. It was subsequently released in the U.S., where it duplicated its U.K. success, reaching number 1 on the &quot;&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Pop Chart&quot; and selling over 3 million copies. As a result, the Miracles became hotter than ever, and Robinson decided to stay with the group for another two years. In 1970, the group were given their own ABC television special, &quot;The Smokey Robinson Show&quot;, which starred the Miracles, with guest stars the Supremes, the Temptations, Stevie Wonder, and Fran Jeffries. In 1971, they scored one more Top 20 hit with 1971&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Blame You at All&quot;. In 1972, Robinson made good on his promise to leave the Miracles, starting a six-month tour which ended in July 1972 at Washington, D.C., later introducing Billy Griffin as his official replacement. This series of final live Miracles concerts with Robinson was released by Motown on the double album &quot;Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles: 1957–1972&quot; (Tamla TS320). About that final tour, Miracle Pete Moore stated: &quot;We had 12 farewell engagements playing to sold-out houses. It was amazing.&quot; Also released that year was the group&#x27;s last studio album with Smokey, &quot;Flying High Together&quot;, with its lead single &quot;We&#x27;ve Come Too Far to End It Now&quot; reaching the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Top 10 (their 23rd visit to the Top 10 of that chart). After Smokey&#x27;s retirement, Billy Griffin was introduced to national television audiences on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;, on an episode guest-starring the Miracles and hosted by Smokey Robinson, broadcast on July 13, 1973. Within a year afterwards, Marv Tarplin also decided to leave the group and continued working with Robinson on his solo material, while Claudette, who had essentially retired from the Miracles&#x27; live performances in 1963, permanently left the Miracles when her husband Smokey did, retiring from recording with them as well.

===Later career===
In 1973, the Miracles, with Griffin, re-emerged with the critically acclaimed album, &quot;Renaissance&quot; – their first without Smokey Robinson on lead vocals, which included the Marvin Gaye composition, &quot;I Love You Secretly&quot;, &quot;What Is a Heart Good For&quot; (the intended first single), and the charting single,&quot;Don&#x27;t Let It End (Til You Let It Begin)&quot;. The following year, in 1974, after releasing the much-covered single &quot;Give Me Just Another Day&quot;, the group had their first Top 20 hit in three years with the million-selling funk song, &quot;Do It Baby&quot;. This was followed by the Top 10 R&amp;B hit, &quot;Don&#x27;t-Cha Love It&quot;. Late that following year, the group recorded the disco smash, &quot;Love Machine&quot;, which came off their self-written-and-produced hit album, &quot;City of Angels&quot;. &quot;Love Machine&quot; reached number-one on the Hot 100 in early 1976, the Miracles&#x27; first since &quot;Tears of a Clown&quot;, and later sold over 4.5 million copies. The Miracles, who had long been written off by the music industry, had proven that they could have big hits &quot;without&quot; Robinson. Despite this success, however, in 1976, the Miracles&#x27; relationship with Motown imploded during contract renewals after their contract with the label had expired. When Motown, then going through a contract issue with Stevie Wonder, advised the group to wait &quot;six months&quot; to discuss a new contract, the group took on an offer to sign with Columbia Records, signing with them in 1977. By this point, Billy Griffin&#x27;s brother Donald, who had begun providing guitar on Miracles studio recordings shortly after Marv Tarplin&#x27;s departure, had officially joined the group on lead guitar. The group immediately had problems after signing with Columbia, starting with the release of their first Columbia single, &quot;Spy For Brotherhood&quot;. Expecting controversy from the single as well as possible threats from the FBI, Columbia pulled the song from the airwaves. The group failed to have a hit during their short Columbia run and in 1978, Pete Moore decided to retire from the road while Billy Griffin wanted to return to his solo career, leading the group to disband.

In 1980, Ronnie White and Bobby Rogers decided to carry on with the Miracles as a touring unit replacing Pete Moore and Billy Griffin with Dave Finley and Carl Cotton, which carried on for three years as &quot;The New Miracles&quot;. This version of the Miracles was short-lived though after White decided to retire from show business following the death of his wife Earlyn, who died from breast cancer in 1983, disbanding the group again. Around this same time, most of the original Miracles including Smokey Robinson and Claudette Robinson as well as Pete Moore, Marv Tarplin, and Bobby Rogers reunited to perform a medley of their songs on the 1983 NBC television special, &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot;. Ron White was attending his wife Earlyn&#x27;s funeral around this time, and did not participate in the reunion. Following his exit from the Miracles, Smokey Robinson enjoyed a successful solo career; in 1979, he and Tarplin co-wrote his signature hit, &quot;Cruisin&#x27;&quot;. Following his reunion with the original Miracles on &quot;Motown 25&quot;, Robinson became dependent on cocaine, which affected his life and career. He broke the addiction in the late 1980s and revived his singing career, with the Grammy-winning Top 10 hit single, &quot;Just to See Her&quot;. In 1986, Smokey&#x27;s marriage with Claudette Robinson ended in divorce while Bobby&#x27;s marriage to Marvelettes member Wanda Young ended in 1975. After the release of a 35th anniversary commemorative compilation album in 1993, Ronnie White and Bobby Rogers decided to regroup the Miracles yet again, with Dave Finley returning to the fold and Sidney Justin, a former NFL player and former member of Shalamar, as lead singer. Rogers replaced Justin with Mark Scott, who toured the world as lead singer of the group. Both Justin and Scott lead separate Miracles groups.

Two years later, Ronnie White died from a longtime bout with leukemia, leaving the remaining Miracles as a trio until Tee Turner joined the group in 2001.

Following White&#x27;s death in 1995, Rogers continued to tour with different members. In 2009, the group received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with Bobby Rogers, Berry Gordy, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, Pete Moore, Claudette Robinson, and Billy Griffin in attendance.
Following another PBS appearance, Rogers was forced into retirement due to health issues, dying less than two years later. Bobby Rogers died in March 2013, two weeks after his 73rd birthday. Pete Moore died on November 19, 2017, his 79th birthday.
Former members Carl Cotton, Marv Tarplin and Donald Griffin are also deceased (in 2003, 2011, and 2015 respectively).

== Accolades, awards and honors ==

During their tenure, the Miracles were awarded several times for their songwriting work from both the BMI and ASCAP songwriting and licensing organizations. In 1997, the Miracles were honored by the Rhythm and Blues Foundation with the Pioneer Award for their contributions to music. In 2001, the group was inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. Three years later, the Miracles were included in &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time at No. 32, still holding to that position in a revised 2011 edition, making the Miracles the &quot;highest-ranking&quot; Motown group on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listing. In both editions, they were immortalized by rock musician Bob Seger, who grew up a Miracles fan. In 2006, Woodbridge Estates, an exclusive residential development in Detroit, named their community park &quot;Miracles Park&quot; and one of its streets &quot;Miracles Boulevard&quot;, in recognition of the legendary Motown group&#x27;s importance to the city, and as a tribute to their many accomplishments in the music industry. In June 2006, the Miracles were voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

In 2009, all the known members of the group (including Billy Griffin) were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, attended by Berry Gordy and Stevie Wonder, who thanked the Miracles (in particular Ronnie White, who had brought the then 11-year-old to Motown&#x27;s studios), for discovering him. Wonder stated: &quot;Were it not for the Miracles, there would not be a Stevie Wonder&quot;. Gordy added that without the Miracles, &quot;Motown would not be the Motown that it is today.&quot; Also in 2009, Motown released a special two-CD compilation: &quot;The Miracles – Depend on Me: The Early Albums&quot;, a collection consisting of the group&#x27;s first five albums. In 2011, the Miracles were inducted to the Doo-Wop Hall of Fame. That same year, &quot;Goldmine&quot; magazine named them as one of the 10 greatest doo-wop groups of all time.

In 2015, the Miracles were inducted into The National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in Detroit, Michigan. On their website, it is stated that the Miracles&#x27; exclusion from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was &quot;outrageous&quot;, pointing out Robinson&#x27;s solo induction went against its own rules. Robinson had only spent 14 years as a solo performer, and his name was not in front of the group&#x27;s until 1967. It further stated the Miracles were &quot;the heartbeat of Motown in the 1960s, one of the best vocal groups ever formed and owners of some of the greatest records Rock has ever produced.&quot; It was also stated that with the Miracles&#x27; induction, the Hall of Fame &quot;remedied its most shameful chapter and the biggest miracle is it took this long to do it.&quot;

In May 2016, The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences paid tribute to the Miracles with a special year-long career retrospective of the group at The Grammy Museum in Los Angeles entitled &quot;Legends of Motown: Celebrating the Miracles&quot;, highlighting their groundbreaking history and accomplishments as Motown&#x27;s first recording artists, with appearances by original Miracles Claudette Rogers-Robinson and Pete Moore. The Miracles are four-time Grammy Hall of Fame inductees. At this special showing, as an expression of her gratitude, Ms Robinson stated:

&quot;It is my honor to be recognized by the GRAMMY Museum&#x27;s Legends of Motown series. I am very grateful that the GRAMMY Museum has provided a platform for fans to experience the history of the Miracles and include items from my private collection to be displayed. The Miracles along with Mr. Berry Gordy and Motown have become a part of musical history that changed the landscape of popular music, soul and R&amp;B to foster positive and progressive race relations in America and around the world. Thank you for the amazing opportunity.&quot;

In a tribute to Motown&#x27;s first group, Martha Reeves of Martha and the Vandellas stated: &quot;In Liverpool they have a statue of the Beatles. Someplace in Detroit there should be a statue of (Smokey Robinson and) the Miracles.&quot;

===The 1987 Rock Hall controversy and 2012 induction===
In 1987, former Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson was inducted to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist, without his fellow Miracles, which Robinson expressed deep regret and disappointment that his group-mates were not inducted with him. This solo induction triggered shockwaves and cries of protest throughout the music industry. In an article in the oldies music magazine &quot;Goldmine&quot;, editor Phil Marder stated: &quot;How did Smokey Robinson get inducted without (the rest of) the Miracles?&quot;

&quot;Robinson certainly deserves solo induction due to his songwriting, producing, solo career and his contributions in many official capacities in Motown’s front office. But if the Supremes got in with Diana Ross and the Vandellas made it in with Martha Reeves and the three other [Four] Tops made it in with Levi Stubbs, how could the Miracles, who were much more important, not get in with Smokey?&quot;

Miracles bass singer Pete Moore told the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot;: &quot;It was a slap in the face, very disappointing. We are the premier group of Motown. We were there before there even &quot;was&quot; a Motown. We set the pace for all the other artists to come after us. We were a little older, and the other artists looked up to us. How could we not be in there?&quot; Moore later stated, &quot;When Terry Stewart [Rock Hall president and CEO] called and told me we were to be inducted, he was apologetic,&quot; Moore said. &quot;He said it should have been done years ago, everybody knew it. He said they received many, many calls over the years from angry (Miracles) fans.&quot;

Robinson had told &quot;Billboard&quot; that he had been lobbying for the Miracles since his own induction, &quot;making calls and signing petitions and everything, because they really deserve it.&quot; Though some felt Robinson should have been included as an inductee with the other Miracles, Robinson said: &quot;I don&#x27;t really even care about that. I&#x27;m already in there. I don&#x27;t understand why it was, like, a task to get the Miracles in there. We were one of the hottest and most prolific groups in the world at that time, so I don&#x27;t understand the hesitancy.&quot; Claudette Robinson stated, &quot;When I spoke to (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame &amp; Museum President and CEO) Terry Stewart, he said he got no less than 900 e-mails per &quot;day&quot; saying the Miracles should be inducted, and why aren&#x27;t they? I was surprised by that. I would think five or 10, but he said that amount, so it&#x27;s a lot of people that were really pulling for us. You have to be thankful and grateful for that.&quot; However, before this decision, Miracle Marv Tarplin died in September 2011 at the age of 70, just months before the induction ceremony.

The Miracles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2012 along with five other groups whose leader had been inducted as a solo artist. Upon their induction, Claudette Robinson told &quot;Billboard&quot;: &quot;I didn&#x27;t think it would happen in my lifetime. For the longest time so many people have put in their comments and tried so hard for us to be inducted, and there was always a reason we weren&#x27;t. So I was a little shocked when they called and said it would happen.&quot; Robinson was selected as the induction speaker for the Miracles and the other five groups. The inducted members were original members Claudette Rogers-Robinson, Pete Moore, Bobby Rogers, Ronnie White (posthumously), and Marv Tarplin (posthumously).

==Legacy==
The Miracles and their music have had worldwide impact, influencing scores of artists of many different musical genres around the globe. The original lineup of the group has consistently been revered by several critics in major rock and music magazines and have received numerous honors and awards for their contributions to the music industry. One of their most honored songs, &quot;The Tracks of My Tears&quot;, was included in the United States Library of Congress&#x27; National Recording Registry because of its &quot;culturally, historically and aesthetically significance&quot; in 2008. It was also chosen as one of the &quot;Top 10 Best Songs of All Time&quot; by a panel of 20 top industry songwriters and producers including Hal David, Paul McCartney, Brian Wilson, Jerry Leiber, and others as reported to Britain&#x27;s &quot;Mojo&quot; music magazine, and was also winner of &quot;The Award of Merit&quot; from The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) for the song&#x27;s writers, Miracles members Pete Moore, Marv Tarplin and Smokey Robinson. In addition, &quot;The Tracks of My Tears&quot; has been ranked by the Recording Industry Association of America and The National Endowment for the Arts at No. 127 in its list of the &quot;Songs of the Century&quot; – the 365 Greatest Songs of the 20th Century. And in 2021,&quot;Rolling Stone Magazine&quot; selected The Miracles&#x27;&quot;The Tracks of My Tears&quot;as &quot;The Greatest Motown Song of All Time.&quot; Their hit-filled 1965 album, &quot;Going to a Go-Go&quot; is listed on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. Four of the group&#x27;s songs were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame including &quot;You Really Got a Hold on Me&quot;, &quot;Tears of a Clown&quot;, &quot;Shop Around&quot; and &quot;Tracks of My Tears&quot;. In addition, &quot;You Really Got a Hold on Me&quot;, &quot;Going to a Go-Go&quot;, &quot;Shop Around&quot; and &quot;Tracks of My Tears&quot; were inducted to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame as part of their list of The 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. In addition, The Miracles hit — “The Tracks of My Tears,” has been selected by the National Recording Preservation Board for the United States Library of Congress’ National Recording Registry, which honors and preserves culturally, historically and aesthetically significant American recordings. The group was also ranked No. 61 on VH-1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Rock Stars of All Time in 1998 while also ranking at No. 71 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s 100 Greatest Artists of All Time in 2008.They have also been inducted into the &quot;Hit Parade Hall of Fame&quot; as of 2014. and the R&amp;B Music Hall of Fame in 2015.

Commenting to &quot;Rolling Stone Magazine&quot;, Bob Seger said: &quot;I used to go to the Motown Revues, and the Miracles &quot;always&quot; closed the show. They were &quot;that&quot; good, and &quot;everybody&quot; knew it.&quot; Producer Quincy Jones called the group the &quot;Beethovens of The 20th Century&quot; due to their songwriting talents. In addition, the Miracles have been regarded as the &quot;most covered act&quot; in Motown&#x27;s roster and have influenced numerous artists worldwide in the last 50 years.

The success of the Miracles actually launched the Motown Records label, and, according to Motown Records founder, Berry Gordy, without the Miracles, the Motown Record Corporation would not have been possible.

<text>USS &quot;Kete&quot; (SS-369), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the kete, the foureye butterflyfish &quot;Chaetodon capistratus&quot;. Her keel was laid down by Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company of Manitowoc, Wisconsin. She was launched on 9 April 1944 sponsored by Mrs. E. S. Hutchinson, and commissioned on 31 July.

Departing Manitowoc 20 August, &quot;Kete&quot; sailed via New Orleans, Louisiana, to Panama. Arriving 5 September, she trained with SubRon 3 until 28 September; then the new submarine sailed to Pearl Harbor, arriving 15 October, and steamed westward on 31 October for her first war patrol.

She topped off her fuel at Midway Island on 4 November and reached her assigned patrol area in the East China Sea on 15 November in company with . Harassed by heavy weather and nonfunctioning bow planes, she sailed 19 November for Saipan, where she arrived 24 November. She departed Saipan with on 24 December and resumed her war patrol north of Okinawa four days later. Despite prolonged periods of heavy 
weather, she made lifeguard patrols off the central Ryukyu Islands from 1 January to 27 January 1945 searching for American fliers downed during air strikes on the Ryukyu Islands. After gathering vital weather data, she sailed to Guam and arrived 30 January for refit.

With Lieutenant Commander Edward Ackerman in command, &quot;Kete&quot; cleared Guam on 1 March for her second war patrol. Assigned to waters surrounding the Nansei Shoto Chain, she resumed lifeguard duty and gathered weather data for the forthcoming invasion of Okinawa. While patrolling west of Tokara Retto on the night of 9 March and 10 March, she surprised an enemy convoy and torpedoed three marus totaling 6881 tons (the Japanese troop transport &quot;Keizan Maru&quot; (2116 GRT) and the Japanese army cargo ships &quot;Sanka Maru&quot; (2495 GRT) and &quot;Dokan Maru&quot; (2270 GRT)). During the night of 14 March, she attacked a cable-laying ship.

With only three torpedoes remaining, she was ordered to depart the area 20 March, refuel at Midway Island, and proceed to Pearl Harbor for refit. &quot;Kete&quot; acknowledged these orders 19 March; and, while steaming eastward the following day, she sent in a weather report from a position south of Colnett Strait. She was neither seen nor heard from again. She was scheduled to arrive Midway by 31 March; when repeated attempts to contact her by radio failed she was reported as presumed lost on 16 April.

Circumstances surrounding her loss remain a mystery. The cause could have been an operational malfunction, a mine explosion, or enemy action.

Some Western sources credit the medium-size Japanese submarine (type Kaichū) with the sinking of &quot;Kete&quot; but the only indisputable fact is that this submarine crossed the same area on the day &quot;Kete&quot; sent a weather report there. &quot;Ro-41&quot; was possibly sunk on 23 March 1945, three days after a supposed kill. It is very unlikely the Japanese captain (Lt Honda) would not report such an attack. It is even emphasized by the last radio contact with &quot;Ro-41&quot;, happening on 22 March 1945 and mentioning just &quot;sighting an enemy destroyer&quot;.

== Possible discovery ==
The actual whereabouts of &quot;Kete&quot; may have been discovered during a deep-sea dive in 1995. The possibility exists that a U.S. submarine lies in about of water off the coast of Iriomote Island, the far southwest island in the Okinawa chain. During operations with an Okinawan company using a U.S. made &quot;SCORPIO&quot; ROV in 1995, a group of divers encountered a sonar contact with what appeared to be a metal structure, about in girth and about in length (exposed) at roughly an angle of 20-30 degrees. The SONAR image of a large unexpected obstruction to the operations prompted the divers to command evasive maneuvers and avoid the area for the safety of the ROV. Note some researchers think the submarine lost off Okinawa was the USS Snook lost in April 1945; however the Snook was apparently lost off the China coast while the USS Kete was stationed off Okinawa. Possibly the cause was that of a minefield laid in February 1945

The divers, thinking they would have another opportunity to work in the area at a later date, left the area and never returned to that site. Their ROV was lost in 1997 off Yonaguni Island, the last island belonging to the Okinawa chain off the east coast of Taiwan. They were fairly certain that the object was a submarine, and quite possibly the &quot;Kete&quot;. No further dives in the area were ever attempted.

&quot;Kete&quot; received one battle star for World War II service.

<text>William Bradley Umstead (May 13, 1895November 7, 1954) was an American politician who served as the 63rd governor of North Carolina from 1953 until his death in 1954. A Southern Democrat, he previously represented North Carolina in the U.S. Senate from 1946 to 1948 and in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1933 to 1939. He was a veteran of World War I.

== Early life and education ==
Umstead was born in the northern Durham County town of Bahama in 1895. In 1916, he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where, like several of North Carolina&#x27;s UNC-alumni Governors before him, he was a member of the Philanthropic Society. Reflecting on his time as a Phi, in 1948 Umstead (then a U.S. Senator) asserted in an article to the Daily Tar Heel &quot;If I had in my hand everything I learned in the halls of [the Philanthropic Society] and in my left hand everything I learned in the University, I wouldn&#x27;t swap my experiences in debating for other things I&#x27;ve learned here in the University.&quot;

== Career ==
Umstead taught high school history for approximately one school year before joining the United States Army after the American entry into World War I in April 1917. He served as an officer and saw combat in France; Umstead was discharged in 1919 as a first lieutenant. He served with the 317th Machine Gun Battalion of the 81st &quot;Wildcat&quot; Division.

He later entered law school at Trinity College (now Duke University). Umstead was a prosecutor for most of his legal career and served as the elected solicitor (today called district attorney) for a five-county district from 1927 to 1933.

He served from 1933 to 1939 in the United States House of Representatives, choosing not to seek re-election in 1938. Umstead was chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party for several years until he was appointed to fill a vacant United States Senate seat in 1946. After President Harry Truman proposed civil rights legislation in 1948, Umstead suggested he not seek reelection and told a state Democrat official that he would not support his candidacy. Defeated for a Senate term of his own in 1948, Umstead ran for governor in 1952 and won.

Umstead spent several weeks preparing his inaugural address. He was inaugurated as Governor of North Carolina on January 8, 1953, at the Memorial Auditorium. He delivered an hour-long speech outlining his extensive legislative program, including a 10 percent salary increase for public school staff retroactive to 1 July 1952, passage of a bill requiring vehicle inspections and establishment of a drivers&#x27; education program in every public high school, bond issues to construct facilities for the treatment and education of the mentally ill and to build schools, and a statewide referendum on the legalization of liquor sales. He also criticized his predecessor&#x27;s road construction program, saying it placed a large financial burden upon the state. Umstead was exhausted by the days&#x27; ceremonies and was feeling ill, but he stood to greet visitors at the Executive Mansion for four hours and attended a ball in the evening.

Umstead spent most of the following day getting his office in order, and on January 10 he went to work in his Durham law firm before retiring to his home near Bahama in the evening. He called a doctor when he could not fall asleep due to a cough, and after midnight he was taken to Watts Hospital in Durham. Once there, his doctor discovered that he had suffered a heart attack and was close to developing pneumonia. His doctor released a statement saying that the governor had suffered &quot;a mild attack of heart trouble&quot; and was quickly improving, hoping to be released in 12 to 15 days. Leaders in the North Carolina General Assembly were unsure if they should proceed with their session while Umstead was hospitalized, but he insisted they begin their work while at the same time giving no instructions to the presiding officer of the Senate, Lieutenant Governor Luther H. Hodges. The two men had tense relations since their campaigns, when Umstead sought to distance himself from Hodges. Umstead also gave Hodges no indications of his legislative agenda, and ignored him throughout his term.

Umstead remained in the hospital for 27 days and returned to the Executive Mansion under the condition that he stay in bed and work limited hours. He had his brother John and former Speaker of the House W. Frank Taylor direct most of his legislative program. Small groups of legislators would visit him in his bedroom to discuss his plans. He never fully recovered from his heart attack and remained unwell. In June 1953 U.S. Senator Willis Smith died. The media immediately began speculating about who Umstead would appoint to serve the remaining 18 months of Smith&#x27;s term. Umstead said little publicly other than that his choice would be of someone with agricultural concerns and respect North Carolina&#x27;s traditional east–west balance in representation in government. North Carolina&#x27;s other senator, Clyde Hoey, hailed from the western portion of the state, so it was assumed that Umstead would nominate an easterner. On July 10 Umstead made the surprise appointment of Alton Lennon to the office, a lawyer from Wilmington who had worked on Umstead&#x27;s Senate and gubernatorial campaigns. Umstead&#x27;s friends suggested that the governor had made the decision simply to get over with it, while observers speculated that Lennon was intended to be a dark horse candidate who could prevail through the next Senate election by being attached to Umstead&#x27;s popularity.

Hoey died on May 12, 1954, thus presenting Umstead with the chance to fill a second U.S. Senate vacancy, an opportunity not afforded to a governor in the United States since 1936. Shortly thereafter the Supreme Court of the United States issued its decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, ruling that the racial segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. Umstead was angered by the decision, feeling the court had overstepped its bounds and undercut state&#x27;s rights to spend their own money, but he believed in the rule of law and felt obligated not to dismiss the ruling out of hand. He also thought a charged public response would be undignified and politically risky. In June 1954, Umstead appointed Sam Ervin to fill Hoey&#x27;s vacancy.

== Death ==
Umstead&#x27;s health declined over the course of his term, worsened by his insistence on his strenuous amount of work. On the afternoon of November 4 Umstead, feeling ill, retired from his office to his bed in the Executive Mansion. His doctor ordered him to be taken to Watts Hospital, while the governor&#x27;s office released a statement saying a severe cold had disturbed Umstead&#x27;s heart. Umstead packed a briefcase full of documents so he could continue to work while hospitalized, but his health did not improve and he did not open the briefcase while at Watts. He died there at 9:10 AM on November 7 with his wife and daughter at his side. A funeral was held two days later and immediately afterwards Hodges was sworn in as Governor of North Carolina. Umstead is buried in the Mount Tabor Church Cemetery in Mangum Township in Rougemont, near Bahama.

The William B. Umstead Bridge in Dare County, North Carolina was named in his honor in 1957. In 1966, the state of North Carolina named the William B. Umstead State Park in Raleigh, North Carolina in his honor, as well.

<text>Luther Hartwell Hodges (March 9, 1898October 6, 1974) was an American businessman and politician. After a career in textile manufacturing, he entered public service, gaining some state appointments. Elected as lieutenant governor of North Carolina in 1952, he succeeded to the Governor&#x27;s office in 1954 after the death of the incumbent. He was elected in 1956 to a full four-year term, serving in total as the 64th governor of the state of North Carolina from 1954 to 1961.

In 1961 he was appointed as United States Secretary of Commerce under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, serving until 1965. He returned to North Carolina and served as chairman of Research Triangle Park, a major facility established during his tenure as governor.

==Biography==
Hodges was born in Cascade, Pittsylvania County, Virginia, on March 9, 1898. At the age of two, he moved with his family to Spray (which later merged with two other towns to become Eden, North Carolina). After growing up there, he lived much of his life in Rockingham County, North Carolina.

Hodges left for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill at age 17, where he was a member of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies, and moved back to Eden after graduation. He went to work at Carolina Cotton and Woolen Mills in Leaksville. On June 24, 1922, he married Marthe Elizabeth Blakeney in Monroe, North Carolina. In 1923, he helped form the Leaksville Rotary Club, which later became known as the Eden Rotary.

Carolina Cotton was later purchased by Marshall Field. Hodges continued to work for the company, working his way up from millworker to executive positions, until he retired to enter politics. In the 1940s, he gained gubernatorial appointments to the state Board of Education and the Highway and Public Works Commission. In 1945, he served as a consultant to the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and to the U.S. Army in occupied Germany. He retired in 1950 and returned to North Carolina.
Hodges ran for office as lieutenant governor in 1952 and was elected. He succeeded to the position of governor in November 1954 upon the death of Governor William B. Umstead in office.

Two years later, Hodges was elected on his own account to a full four-year term as governor. Because North Carolina had a one-term limit for governors at that time, Hodges had the longest continuous tenure in the office until the state constitution was changed and Jim Hunt was elected to a second term in 1980.

During his time in office, Governor Hodges promoted industrialization and education.
He helped gain support for the establishment of Research Triangle Park, intended to attract innovation and industry to the North Carolina Piedmont, and to strengthen connections among the three universities involved. After Hodges completed his tenure in 1965 as Secretary of the Department of Commerce, he returned to Chapel Hill. He was appointed as Chairman of Research Triangle Park. In 1967, he served a one-year term as president of Rotary International.

==Civil rights==
In 1959, Hodges became involved in the Kissing Case, where two young African-American boys (one aged 9, and one aged 7) had been convicted of rape because a white girl (aged 8) had kissed them each on the cheek. They had been sentenced to the state reformatory. A range of activists, civil rights organizations, Eleanor Roosevelt and President Eisenhower, in addition to the international press, pressured Hodges for clemency. After three months Hodges pardoned them, but refused to apologize. Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt &quot;led an international campaign on their behalf.&quot;

==Later years==
He died on October 6, 1974, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and is buried at the Overlook Cemetery in Eden, North Carolina. A monument was erected in his honor near a water fountain in Eden&#x27;s Freedom Park.

==Legacy==
Hodges&#x27;s son, Luther H. Hodges Jr., was a prominent banking executive and United States Deputy Secretary of Commerce.

<doc id="434407" wikidata="Q5391767" url="?curid=434407" title="Spoleto Festival USA">
<text>Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston, South Carolina, is one of America&#x27;s major performing arts festivals. It was founded in 1977 by Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Gian Carlo Menotti, who sought to establish a counterpart to the Festival dei Due Mondi (&quot;The Festival of Two Worlds&quot;) in Spoleto, Italy.

When Italian organizers planned an American festival, they searched for a city that would offer the charm of Spoleto, Italy, and also its wealth of theaters, churches, and other performance spaces. Charleston was selected as an ideal location, with Menotti saying of Charleston: 
:It&#x27;s intimate, so you can walk from one theatre to the next. It has Old World charm in architecture and gardens. Yet it&#x27;s a community big enough to support the large number of visitors to the festival.

The annual 17-day late-spring event showcases both established and emerging artists in more than 150 performances of opera, dance, theater, classical music, and jazz.

==History of the Charleston festival==
===Beginnings===
The festival experienced financial problems from its outset which produced a quick turnover in leadership. On September 27, 1976, Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Stern, the president of the College of Charleston at that time, was named as the new chairman of the Charleston Coordinating Committee after the departure of Hugh Lane. Personality disputes also arose involving Menotti. Menotti, who had served as the artistic director for the festival since its founding, claimed in 1991 that he was not interested in renewing his three-year contract when it ended in 1992 over artistic differences. The board did not officially accept his resignation immediately, but Menotti stood by his intentions, blaming artistic differences with the board and lack of personal control: &quot;I no longer feel it is my festival, and this has been my life for 15 years. I feel a bit lonely among them. I&#x27;m treated like a clerk.&quot;

Most significantly, Menotti had a poor relationship with the festival&#x27;s general manager, Nigel Redden, who challenged programming decisions, expense accounts for Menotti, and administrative decisions by Menotti. Two camps developed on the board, splitting support between those backing Redden and those who supported Menotti (including Charleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr.). Mayor Riley supported Menotti so strongly that he threatened to withdraw city support for the festival if Menotti were pushed out. Eventually, in May 1991, Menotti issued an ultimatum that either Redden and his supporters resign or Menotti would. In August 1991, Redden resigned, as did 19 of the 46 board members the next month.

The tumult affected the scope of the festival the following year; the budget for 1992&#x27;s festival was $4.6 million, down about $1 million from 1991, and covering about 20 percent fewer presentations (103 in 1992 compared with over 120 in 1991). In 1990 and 1991, the festival had raised about 44% of its budget (about $2.4 million) from private donations, but in 1992, the festival raised only $1.2 million from such donations, about 33% of its $3.6 million budget that year.

By 1993, personal conflicts reached a breaking point, with Menotti and the board of the Charleston festival arguing over those in charge of the festival, its artistic direction, and financing. Menotti, who had threatened the end the festival in Charleston left the festival in 1993; the local board, however, owned the rights to the name of the festival and pledged to continue it without Menotti. Milton Rhodes was appointed the general manager in November 1993, and he immediately set about righting the finances, including negotiating the cancellation of about $400,000 in debt and securing a loan from South Carolina to cover another $600,000 of debt. Still, the financial difficulties continued, and the 1995 festival lost an additional $900,000.

In July 1995, Redden was recruited to return to the festival on an interim basis to help it overcome a debt of more than $1,000,000. The 1995 festival went over budget by 20%, and its full-time staff was cut in half. During his first tenure with the festival, Redden had been successful in repairing the festival&#x27;s flagging finances and left the festival having gone from a $500,000 deficit to a surplus of $1.4 million. Upon his return in 1996, Redden was again successful in turning the finances of the festival around, quickly raising $1.6 million and cutting debt in half.

=== New Leadership ===
In September 2020, Nigel Redden announced his retirement from the festival, after 35 years of involvement with Spoleto. In July 2021, the festival announced Mena Mark Hanna as its new General Director. Hanna is the first person of color to lead the festival, and the fourth general director in the festival&#x27;s history. Hanna previously served as the founding dean of the Barenboim-Said Akademie in Berlin.

==The Festival&#x27;s mission and programming philosophy==

The Festival&#x27;s mission is to present programs of the highest artistic caliber while maintaining a dedication to young artists, a commitment to all forms of the performing arts, a passion for contemporary innovation, and an enthusiasm for providing unusual performance opportunities for established artists. One of the Festival&#x27;s tenets is to provide young artists the opportunity to work with veteran directors, designers and performers. Artists who performed at Spoleto Festival USA early in their careers include Renée Fleming, Emanuel Ax, Joshua Bell, Jean-Yves Thibaudet and Yo-Yo Ma.

Each year, the Festival produces its own operas, which are often rarely performed masterpieces by well-known composers or traditional works presented in new ways. It also presents theater, dance and music programs ranging from classical to jazz, bluegrass, soul and blues. Since its inception, the Festival has presented over 200 international and U.S. premieres, notably &quot;Creve Coeur&quot; by Tennessee Williams and &quot;The American Clock&quot; by Arthur Miller. Other premieres have included &quot;Monkey: Journey to the West&quot; by Chen Shi-Zheng, Damon Albarn, and Jamie Hewlett; &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot; by Lee Breuer; &quot;The American Clock&quot; by Arthur Miller; &quot;The Mechanical Organ&quot; by the Nikolais Dance Theatre; &quot;Miracolo d’Amore&quot; by Martha Clarke; &quot;Empty Places&quot; by Laurie Anderson; &quot;Hydrogen Jukebox&quot; by Philip Glass and Allen Ginsberg; &quot;Praise House&quot; by Urban Bush Women; &quot;Three Tales&quot; by Steve Reich and Beryl Korot; and &quot;Tenebrae&quot; by Osvaldo Golijov

===Piccolo Spoleto===
The official companion festival to Spoleto Festival USA, is operated by the City of Charleston Office of Cultural Affairs. After two years of mini-festivals, Piccolo Spoleto was created as an official part of the overall Spoleto program in 1979. Whereas Spoleto Festival USA features artists and performers of national and international renown, Piccolo Spoleto highlights outstanding local and regional artists with several hundred performances throughout the city. Piccolo Spoleto is &quot;the perfect complement to the international scope of its parent festival and its 700 events in 17 days transform Charleston into an exhilarating celebration of performing, literary and visual arts.&quot; Piccolo Spoleto concludes the day before the main festival with a free concert in Hampton Park. Except for 2001 (when they were held on Daniel Island), the closing ceremonies have been held at Hampton Park since 1984 when the event coincided with the reopening of the refurbished park.

==Spoleto Festival USA Orchestra==
Each year members of the Festival Orchestra are selected by nationwide auditions to form the Festival&#x27;s resident ensemble. The orchestra works with the Resident Conductor and Director of Orchestral Activities, John Kennedy, as well as with guest conductors in opera, symphonic, choral, chamber, and contemporary music performances. Over the years, the Festival Orchestra has proved to be an opportunity for young musicians to gain extensive performance experience. Alumni of the Spoleto orchestra can be found in almost every professional orchestra in the United States and many abroad.

<text>William Kerr Scott (April 17, 1896 – April 16, 1958) was an American politician from North Carolina. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the 62nd governor of North Carolina from 1949 until 1953, and a United States Senator from 1954 until 1958.

A native of Alamance County, North Carolina, and a farmer by training, Scott was a lifelong advocate for agricultural issues and became known in his home state as &quot;the Squire of Haw River.&quot; He was elected as the state&#x27;s Commissioner of Agriculture, but resigned that post to run for governor in 1948. His followers, popularly known as &quot;Branchhead Boys,&quot; fervently supported Scott in all his campaigns and remained a force in North Carolina politics for more than a decade following his death.

== Early life ==
Scott was born in 1896, the son of Robert W. Scott and Lizzie Scott. He graduated from Hawfields High School in 1913 and subsequently enrolled in the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (now NC State University), graduating in 1917 with a Bachelor of Science in agriculture. He performed well as a student there, while also running track and volunteering for the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association. After graduating he briefly worked as an emergency food production agent for the United States Department of Agriculture. After the United States entered World War I, he enlisted as a private in the United States Army. For four months he trained with field artillery at Camp Taylor in Kentucky. Shortly before he was due to enroll in officer training school, the war ended and he was discharged from service.

Kerr was the only child in his family who had political ambitions. His father advised him that he should acquire land and develop his agricultural enterprise to ensure that when he sought public office he could campaign without fear of losing his job due to political reprisal. Thus, after he was discharged from the army he borrowed $4,000 from his father and bought 224 acres of land. He cleared it and raised sheep and cattle.

== Career ==

Scott was inaugurated as Governor of North Carolina on January 6, 1949. As governor, Scott created the &quot;Go Forward&quot; program with approval from the state legislature in 1949. He also signed a $200 million rural road building program, leading to nearly 15,000 additional miles of paved road in the state. Immediately following his term as governor, he represented North Carolina in the United States Senate from 1954 to 1958. His son, Bob Scott served as governor from 1969 to 1973, and his granddaughter, Meg Scott Phipps served as North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture from 2001 to 2003.

Relative to other Southern Democrats, Scott was a moderate regarding racial issues during his time as governor. While he supported segregation, he appointed the first black member of the North Carolina Board of Education, Dr. Harold Trigg, and nominated University of North Carolina President Frank Porter Graham to fill a vacant United States Senate seat in 1949. Graham was regarded as one of the most racially and generally progressive figures in the South, and became victimized by pernicious attacks concerning his views on race relations when he campaigned the following year to maintain his senate seat. In an effort to defend Graham, Scott lent the full weight of his political organization to him and assiduously campaigned across North Carolina. Despite intervention from Scott, President Harry Truman, U.S. House Speaker Sam Rayburn, and others, Graham was defeated by conservative lawyer Willis Smith for the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination. The tenor of Willis Smith&#x27;s campaign was considered so offensive that Scott&#x27;s wife, First Lady Mary White Scott, refused to shake the senator-elect&#x27;s hand at an Executive Mansion reception. He was succeeded as governor by William B. Umstead on January 8, 1953.

Four years later, when Scott elected to run for the same U.S. Senate seat which had been contested by Graham, he was queried by a local reporter about how his campaign would respond to the race-baiting strategies that are imputed with the loss of his appointee. To this, he is said to have grinned and replied, &quot;I&#x27;ll handle it, son. I&#x27;m not as good a Christian as Frank Porter Graham.&quot;

Scott attained the Senate seat by approximately 8,000 votes and served until he died of a heart attack in 1958. He was sworn in on November 29, 1954, instead of the following January, as he was filling a vacant seat. In December he voted to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. As senator, Scott moved away from his previously moderate views on race. He was a signatory of the Southern Manifesto, objecting to the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students are unconstitutional. Reacting directly to the &quot;Brown&quot; ruling, Kerr expressed his wish that the Supreme Court &quot;would reaffirm its own historic decisions approving equal, but separate, school facilities.&quot; He added, &quot;I have always...been opposed to Negro and white children going to school together.&quot; Scott also opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and President Eisenhower&#x27;s decision to send troops to escort black students to Little Rock Central High School.

Scott died in Burlington, North Carolina on April 16, 1958, and is buried in Hawfields Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Mebane, North Carolina. His son, Robert Scott, was also elected governor in the 1960s.

The W. Kerr Scott Dam and Reservoir in Wilkes County, North Carolina are named in honor of the governor. While Senator, he greatly assisted in obtaining approval for construction of the dam and reservoir. In addition, a residence hall is named in his memory on the campus of East Carolina University and a technology building on the campus of Appalachian State University is named for him.

His home and farm, the Kerr Scott Farm, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

<text>Robert Gregg Cherry (October 17, 1891June 25, 1957) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 61st governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1945 to 1949.

==Biography==
Born in York County, South Carolina near Rock Hill, Cherry grew up in Gastonia, North Carolina with relatives after the death of his parents. He earned bachelor&#x27;s and law degrees at Trinity College (now Duke University). He organized and led a volunteer artillery company during World War I.

In 1921, he married Lula Mildred Stafford, the daughter of the Mayor of Greensboro Emory Junius Stafford.

Cherry served as mayor of Gastonia from 1919 to 1923, as a member and speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, as chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party (1937–1940), and as a member of the North Carolina Senate. In Gastonia, it was joked that he was the best lawyer in town when sober, and the second-best lawyer in town when drunk.

In 1944, Cherry was elected governor as the last in a series of governors affiliated with the political machine of former governor O. Max Gardner. He was sworn in on January 4, 1945. Cherry inherited an economy facing material and labor shortages as a result of the ongoing Second World War. One of his primary focuses during his term was the improvement of mental health care at state-run facilities. Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro, North Carolina, is named for him.

Unlike most other Southern Democratic governors, Cherry supported Harry S. Truman for re-election in 1948. He was succeeded by W. Kerr Scott on January 6, 1949. He retired from politics and returned to the practice of law.

<doc id="434416" wikidata="Q882553" url="?curid=434416" title="J. Melville Broughton">
<text>Joseph Melville Broughton Jr. (November 17, 1888March 6, 1949) was an American politician who served as the 60th governor of North Carolina from 1941 to 1945. He later briefly served as a United States Senator from January 3, 1949, until his death in office approximately two months later.

==Early life and education==
Broughton was born on November 17, 1888, in Raleigh, North Carolina. He graduated from Wake Forest College, where he also played football, in 1910. Broughton attended Harvard Law School then worked as a school principal and journalist before actively entering the legal profession.

==Political career==
He served in the North Carolina Senate from 1927 to 1929. He later served one term as governor from 1941 to 1945. One of his major legacies was the extension of the public school term from six to nine months.

The North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources describes Broughton as the typical white moderate of the time. Broughton advocated for the improvement of the lives of African Americans, such as equalizing the salaries of black and white teachers and improving their housing. In 1941, Broughton deployed the North Carolina National Guard to protect Cy Winstead, a black man accused of raping a white woman, after Winstead was nearly lynched in Roxboro, North Carolina. Afterwards, Broughton had the police investigate the mobs, expressing interest in punishing the ringleaders. Ten white men was charged with unlawful assembly. To local shock, five of the men were found guilty, receiving prison terms ranging from 12 to 18 months. Winstead himself later pleaded guilty to assault with intent to commit rape and was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.

Nevertheless, Broughton resisted threats to segregation. In 1942, he urged African Americans not to start making demands at home as a result of World War II:

&quot;Negroes are ill-advised if they take the position they are for victory in this war if something is to be done for them. Negroes should put their full energy into the war effort, for failure means slavery of the worst sort for white and Negro alike. The man or woman who uses this emergency as a means of stirring up strife between the races is not a friend to either race and is not a good American.&quot;

In 1943, Broughton wrote, &quot;We believe in a policy of purity and high standard as to both races and we recognize the principle that race distinction does not imply race discrimination.&quot; He spurned criticism from the NAACP and claimed that racism had no impact on North Carolina&#x27;s judicial system.
Broughton was among twelve nominated at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to serve as Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s running mate in the presidential election that year.

==Tenure in Senate==
In 1948, Broughton was elected to the United States Senate, after defeating William B. Umstead, an appointed incumbent, in the Democratic primary. In November, Broughton won both a special election to complete the Senate term and an election for a full term. He took office on December 31, 1948, but his service in the Senate was brief.

Appearing healthy, Broughton suddenly collapsed from a heart attack and died in Washington, D.C., on March 6, 1949. Governor W. Kerr Scott appointed Frank Porter Graham to fill his vacant office until the next election.

==Family==

Joseph Melville Broughton, Jr. was the son of Joseph Melville Broughton and Sallie Harris. He married Alice Willson in 1916, they had four children. He was the nephew of Needham B. Broughton and a first cousin of Carrie Lougee Broughton. He was also a first cousin of medical doctor and Baptist minister Len G. Broughton. Broughton and his wife lived in the Jolly-Broughton House, a Georgian Revival mansion located in Raleigh&#x27;s Hayes Barton Historic District, before and after living in the North Carolina Executive Mansion. He was interred at Montlawn Memorial Park in Raleigh.

==Legacy==
In 1959, the State Hospital at Morganton for psychiatric patients was renamed Broughton Hospital in his memory. In addition, Broughton Hall at North Carolina State University was named in his honor.

He was a member of Civitan International.

<text>Salvia elegans, a species with several varieties including pineapple sage and tangerine sage, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico.

==Description==
&quot;Salvia elegans&quot; Pineapple Sage has tubular red flowers and an attractive scent to the leaves that is similar to pineapple. It produces numerous erect leafy stems up to and flowers in the late autumn. It is a short-day plant. The flowering season in Mexico is August onward; further north it may not flower till later autumn, and if there is no frost, it may flower until spring.

The variety &quot;Honey Melon&quot;, which has the same pineapple fragrance in the leaves, blooms early in the summer, rather than in autumn.

&quot;Salvia elegans&quot; Tangerine Sage grows to about tall, has bronze edged leaves and a citrus scent. It is summer flowering.

=== Phytochemistry ===
The essential oil of &quot;S. elegans&quot; consists primarily of caffeic acid and its derivatives, such as rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid, and flavones.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Native to Mexico, the shrub inhabits Madrean and Mesoamerican pine–oak forests between .

== Ecology ==
The red flowers are attractive to hummingbirds and butterflies. In a highland temperate forest in central Mexico, pineapple sage was found to be one of the three most-visited species by hummingbirds.

== Cultivation ==
Pineapple sage was introduced into horticulture about 1870. In cultivation, it typically reaches a height of , with its roots spreading underground to form a large clump. The pale yellow-green leaves are veined and covered with fine hairs. Six to twelve scarlet flowers grow in whorls, featuring a long inflorescence that blooms gradually and lasts for an extended period. With a hard frost, the plant will die down to the ground and grow back the following spring.

==Uses==
The leaves and flowers are edible. The plant is used in Mexican traditional medicine, especially for anxiety and hypertension.

<text>Richard Caswell (August 3, 1729November 10, 1789) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the first and fifth governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1776 to 1780 and from 1785 to 1787. He also served as a senior officer of militia in the Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War. As a delegate to the First Continental Congress, he was a signatory of the 1774 Continental Association.

== Early life ==
Caswell was born on August 3, 1729, in Harford County (present-day Baltimore), Maryland; one of eleven children born to Richard and Christian () Caswell. The Caswells moved to New Bern, North Carolina, in 1745. He was appointed deputy surveyor for the province in 1750. While a member of the North Carolina House of Burgesses, a position he held for 17 years, Caswell introduced a bill establishing the &quot;Town of Kingston&quot; (which was later changed to Kinston as a result of the American Revolutionary War). He was a prosperous lawyer, farmer, land speculator, tanner, and grand master of North Carolina.

== Military service ==
Caswell fought the Regulators at Alamance (1771) during the Regulator Movement, where it is thought he commanded the right wing of Governor Tryon&#x27;s forces.

=== American Revolutionary War ===
Caswell represented North Carolina in the Continental Congresses of 1774 and 1775. When the militia district of New Bern was formed on May 4, 1776; Caswell was appointed to command that minuteman region. As such, he led the Provincial Congress&#x27; force at the Battle of Moore&#x27;s Creek Bridge (1776). Soon after that, the Provincial Congress disbanded minuteman battalions in favor of militia. In 1780, he was commissioned major general of militia and state troops. At the Battle of Camden Court House in 1780, his troops fled after Virginia militia broke and ran in panic, exposing him to attack without greater defense, leaving the Continentals behind to suffer defeat.

After his defeat at Camden Court House, Caswell returned home with an unnamed illness. In the meantime, the North Carolina General Assembly appointed William Smallwood of Maryland to the command of North Carolina&#x27;s militia without informing Caswell, so he resigned on October 21, 1780. When Smallwood returned to Maryland in January 1781, the General Assembly once again appointed Caswell major general of militia, and he retained the position until the end of the American Revolution.

=== Effective dates of promotion ===
*Colonel of militia (1775)
*Brigadier General of militia (1776)
*Major General of militia (1780)

== Governor (1776–1780) ==
Caswell was president of the North Carolina Provincial Congress that wrote the first Constitution of North Carolina in 1776. As the congress adjourned, it elected him acting governor. He took the oath of office on January 16, 1777. Under the new constitution, the state Legislature (&quot;General Assembly&quot;) re-elected him as the first governor in April 1777. Caswell stepped down in 1780, as the state constitution allowed only three consecutive one-year terms to command the militia.

== Later career ==
Caswell served as the comptroller of North Carolina and as a member of the North Carolina Senate between his two gubernatorial terms. Caswell was also chosen to be one of North Carolina&#x27;s delegates to the United States Constitutional Convention of 1787, but he did not attend. At the time of his death in 1789, he had returned once again to the North Carolina General Assembly, this time serving as Speaker of the Senate.

== Personal life ==

Caswell married Mary Mackilwean, the daughter of James and Elinor Mackilwean. They had three children, including a daughter that died at birth in 1753, William Caswell born in 1754, and another daughter born in 1757, who died as an infant. Mary Caswell died from complications of childbirth. The family lived on a plantation home called Red House, which is the site of the Richard Caswell Memorial Park in Kinston, North Carolina.

After Mary&#x27;s death, Caswell married Sarah Heritage (17401794) on June 20, 1758. Mary was the daughter of William Heritage and Susannah Moore. They had eight children: Richard Caswell, born in 1759; Sarah Caswell, born in 1762; Winston Caswell, born in 1764; Anna Caswell, born in 1766; Dallam Caswell, born in 1769; John Caswell, born in 1772; Susannah Caswell, born in 1775, and Christian Caswell, born in 1779.

Caswell&#x27;s son Richard was colonel of Dobbs Regiment and lieutenant colonel of the 2nd North Carolina Regiment during the American Revolutionary War. He was lost at sea in 1784. William, a son by his first marriage, was also colonel of Dobbs Regiment and brigadier general and in command of New Bern District during the war.

== Death and legacy ==
Caswell died in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on November 10, 1789. According to tradition, his body was returned to Kinston for burial in the Caswell family cemetery, near where a memorial and museum stands today.

Among his many accomplishments was Caswell&#x27;s proposal to use the reimbursement funds for aid rendered to the Crown during the French and Indian War for erecting and establishing a free school in every county. His &quot;Address to the General Assembly&quot; in 1760 on this topic was used for many years by other politicians in favor of public education. He also wrote the proposal into the first North Carolina constitution in 1776. Caswell County, North Carolina, and Fort Caswell were named for him. The Richard Caswell Memorial Museum was established in Kinston, near where he may have been buried.

<doc id="434428" wikidata="Q959606" url="?curid=434428" title="Compound interest">
<text>Compound interest is interest accumulated from a principal sum and previously accumulated interest. It is the result of reinvesting or retaining interest that would otherwise be paid out, or of the accumulation of debts from a borrower. 

Compound interest is contrasted with simple interest, where previously accumulated interest is not added to the principal amount of the current period. Compounded interest depends on the simple interest rate applied and the frequency at which the interest is compounded. 

==Compounding frequency==
The &quot;compounding frequency&quot; is the number of times per given unit of time the accumulated interest is capitalized, on a regular basis. The frequency could be yearly, half-yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, continuously, or not at all until maturity.

For example, monthly capitalization with interest expressed as an annual rate means that the compounding frequency is 12, with time periods measured in months.

==Annual equivalent rate==
To help consumers compare retail financial products more fairly and easily, many countries require financial institutions to disclose the annual compound interest rate on deposits or advances on a comparable basis. The interest rate on an annual equivalent basis may be referred to variously in different markets as effective &quot;annual percentage rate&quot; (EAPR), &quot;annual equivalent rate&quot; (AER), &quot;effective interest rate&quot;, &quot;effective annual rate&quot;, &quot;annual percentage yield&quot; and other terms. The effective annual rate is the total accumulated interest that would be payable up to the end of one year, divided by the principal sum. These rates are usually the annualised compound interest rate alongside charges other than interest, such as taxes and other fees.

==Examples==


* The interest on corporate bonds and government bonds is usually payable twice yearly. The amount of interest paid every six months is the disclosed interest rate divided by two and multiplied by the principal. The yearly compounded rate is higher than the disclosed rate.
* Canadian mortgage loans are generally compounded semi-annually with monthly or more frequent payments.
* U.S. mortgages use an amortizing loan, not compound interest. With these loans, an amortization schedule is used to determine how to apply payments toward principal and interest. Interest generated on these loans is not added to the principal, but rather is paid off monthly as the payments are applied.
* It is sometimes mathematically simpler, for example, in the valuation of derivatives, to use continuous compounding. Continuous compounding in pricing these instruments is a natural consequence of Itô calculus, where financial derivatives are valued at ever-increasing frequency, until the limit is approached and the derivative is valued in continuous time.

==History==
Compound interest when charged by lenders was once regarded as the worst kind of usury and was severely condemned by Roman law and the common laws of many other countries.

The Florentine merchant Francesco Balducci Pegolotti provided a table of compound interest in his book &quot;Pratica della mercatura&quot; of about 1340. It gives the interest on 100 lire, for rates from 1% to 8%, for up to 20 years. The &quot;Summa de arithmetica&quot; of Luca Pacioli (1494) gives the Rule of 72, stating that to find the number of years for an investment at compound interest to double, one should divide the interest rate into 72.

Richard Witt&#x27;s book &quot;Arithmeticall Questions&quot;, published in 1613, was a landmark in the history of compound interest. It was wholly devoted to the subject (previously called ), whereas previous writers had usually treated compound interest briefly in just one chapter in a mathematical textbook. Witt&#x27;s book gave tables based on 10% (the maximum rate of interest allowable on loans) and other rates for different purposes, such as the valuation of property leases. Witt was a London mathematical practitioner and his book is notable for its clarity of expression, depth of insight, and accuracy of calculation, with 124 worked examples.

Jacob Bernoulli discovered the constant formula_1 in 1683 by studying a question about compound interest.

In the 19th century, and possibly earlier, Persian merchants used a slightly modified linear Taylor approximation to the monthly payment formula that could be computed easily in their heads.
In modern times, Albert Einstein&#x27;s supposed quote regarding compound interest rings true. &quot;He who understands it earns it; he who doesn&#x27;t pays it.&quot;

==Calculation==

===Periodic compounding===
The total accumulated value, including the principal sum formula_2 plus compounded interest formula_3, is given by the formula:
formula_4

where:
*&quot;A&quot; is the final amount
*&quot;P&quot; is the original principal sum
*&quot;r&quot; is the nominal annual interest rate
*&quot;n&quot; is the compounding frequency (1: annually, 12: monthly, 52: weekly, 365: daily)
*&quot;t&quot; is the overall length of time the interest is applied (expressed using the same time units as &quot;n&quot;, usually years).

The total compound interest generated is the final amount minus the initial principal, since the final amount is equal to principal plus interest:

formula_5

===Accumulation function===

Since the principal &quot;P&quot; is simply a coefficient, it is often dropped for simplicity, and the resulting accumulation function is used instead. The accumulation function shows what $1 grows to after any length of time. The accumulation function for compound interest is:formula_6

===Continuous compounding===

When the number of compounding periods per year increases without limit, continuous compounding occurs, in which case the effective annual rate approaches an upper limit of . Continuous compounding can be regarded as letting the compounding period become infinitesimally small, achieved by taking the limit as &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity. The amount after &quot;t&quot; periods of continuous compounding can be expressed in terms of the initial amount &quot;P&quot;0 as:

formula_7

===Force of interest===
As the number of compounding periods formula_8 tends to infinity in continuous compounding, the continuous compound interest rate is referred to as the force of interest formula_9. For any continuously differentiable accumulation function a(t), the force of interest, or more generally the logarithmic or continuously compounded return, is a function of time as follows:

formula_10

This is the logarithmic derivative of the accumulation function.

Conversely:
formula_11 (Since formula_12, this can be viewed as a particular case of a product integral.)

When the above formula is written in differential equation format, then the force of interest is simply the coefficient of amount of change:
formula_13

For compound interest with a constant annual interest rate &quot;r&quot;, the force of interest is a constant, and the accumulation function of compounding interest in terms of force of interest is a simple power of &quot;e&quot;:
formula_14 or
formula_15

The force of interest is less than the annual effective interest rate, but more than the annual effective discount rate. It is the reciprocal of the &quot;e&quot;-folding time. 

A way of modeling the force of inflation is with Stoodley&#x27;s formula: formula_16 where &quot;p&quot;, &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&quot; are estimated.

===Compounding basis===
To convert an interest rate from one compounding basis to another compounding basis, so that

formula_17

use

formula_18

where &quot;r&quot;1 is the interest rate with compounding frequency &quot;n&quot;1, and &quot;r&quot;2 is the interest rate with compounding frequency &quot;n&quot;2.

When interest is continuously compounded, use

formula_19

where formula_9 is the interest rate on a continuous compounding basis, and
&quot;r&quot; is the stated interest rate with a compounding frequency &quot;n&quot;.

===Monthly amortized loan or mortgage payments===

The interest on loans and mortgages that are amortized—that is, have a smooth monthly payment until the loan has been paid off—is often compounded monthly. The formula for payments is found from the following argument.

====Exact formula for monthly payment====
An exact formula for the monthly payment (formula_21) is
formula_22
or equivalently
formula_23

where:
* formula_21 = monthly payment
* formula_2 = principal
* formula_26 = monthly interest rate
* formula_8 = number of payment periods

===== Spreadsheet formula =====
In spreadsheets, the PMT() function is used. The syntax is:

 PMT(interest_rate, number_payments, present_value, future_value, [Type])
====Approximate formula for monthly payment====
A formula that is accurate to within a few percent can be found by noting that for typical U.S. note rates (formula_28 and terms formula_29=10–30 years), the monthly note rate is small compared to 1. formula_30 so that the formula_31 which yields the simplification:

formula_32

which suggests defining auxiliary variables

formula_33formula_34

Here formula_35 is the monthly payment required for a zero–interest loan paid off in formula_8 installments. In terms of these variables the approximation can be written formula_37.

Let formula_38.
The expansion formula_39 is valid to better than 1% provided formula_40.

====Example of mortgage payment====
For a $120,000 mortgage with a term of 30 years and a note rate of 4.5%, payable monthly, we find:

formula_41formula_42formula_43

which gives

formula_44

so that

formula_45

The exact payment amount is formula_46 so the approximation is an overestimate of about a sixth of a percent.

===Monthly deposits===
Given a principal deposit and a recurring deposit, the total return of an investment can be calculated via the compound interest gained per unit of time. If required, the interest on additional non-recurring and recurring deposits can also be defined within the same formula (see below).

* formula_2 = principal deposit
* formula_26 = rate of return (monthly)
* formula_49 = monthly deposit, and
* formula_50 = time, in months

The compound interest for each deposit is:
formula_51
Adding all recurring deposits over the total period t, (i starts at 0 if deposits begin with the investment of principal; i starts at 1 if deposits begin the next month):
formula_52
Recognizing the geometric series: formula_53 and applying the closed-form formula (common ratio :formula_54):

formula_55

If two or more types of deposits occur (either recurring or non-recurring), the compound value earned can be represented as

formula_56

where C is each lump sum and k are non-monthly recurring deposits, respectively, and x and y are the differences in time between a new deposit and the total period t is modeling.

A practical estimate for reverse calculation of the rate of return when the exact date and amount of each recurring deposit is not known, a formula that assumes a uniform recurring monthly deposit over the period, is:
formula_57 or formula_58

<text>Abner Nash (August 8, 1740December 2, 1786) was an American politician who served as the second governor of North Carolina from 1780 to 1781 and as a member of the Continental Congress from 1782 until his death.

==Life story==
Nash was born the son of Col. John Nash and Anne Owen at &quot;Templeton Manor&quot; Plantation in Prince Edward County in the Colony of Virginia. He read law and was admitted to the bar in Virginia. He also began his political career there, serving in the House of Burgesses from 1761 to 1765 before moving to New Bern, North Carolina. He married the widow of former colonial governor Arthur Dobbs.

Nash was an active supporter of the revolutionary cause. He represented New Bern in the rebel &quot;provincial congress&quot; assembled from 1774, and in 1776 was a member of the committee that drafted the state&#x27;s new constitution. He became a member of the North Carolina House of Commons in 1777 (serving as the first Speaker of that house) and the North Carolina State Senate in 1779.

He was elected governor by the legislature in 1780. During his brief tenure as governor, North Carolina saw some of its worst conflicts as a battleground in the American Revolutionary War. Unlike his brother Francis, his temper and poor health were poorly suited to the needs of war. This brought him into difficulty with the legislature. The assembly appointed Richard Caswell as commander-in-chief (Major General) of the North Carolina militia and state troops, even though the constitution assigned this responsibility to the governor. Then in December 1780, they named a &quot;Council Extraordinary&quot; that further encroached on his office. Consequently, Nash resigned and went home in the spring of 1781. Thomas Burke was named to replace him.

==Death==
Later in 1782, North Carolina eased political tensions by sending Nash as a delegate to the Continental Congress. He would serve there the rest of his life, as he died at a session in New York City. Abner was initially buried in St. Paul&#x27;s Churchyard in Manhattan, but his body was later returned for burial in a private, family plot in Craven County, North Carolina.

==Family==
His son, Frederick Nash, was also a lawyer and political leader. He would serve as Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court. Another descendant, Frederic, would later become a famous poet by his middle name, Ogden Nash.

<doc id="434444" wikidata="Q783310" url="?curid=434444" title="Orlov revolt">
<text>The Orlov revolt () was a Greek uprising in the Peloponnese and later also in Crete that broke out in February 1770, following the arrival of Russian Admiral Alexey Orlov, commander of the Imperial Russian Navy during the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774), at the Mani Peninsula. The revolt, a major precursor to the Greek War of Independence (which erupted in 1821), was part of Catherine the Great&#x27;s so-called &quot;Greek Plan&quot; and was eventually suppressed by the Ottomans by June 1770, three months after it had begun.

== Background ==
=== Rise of the Russo-Turkish conflict ===
The first attempts of the nascent Russian Empire, under Tsar Peter the Great, to expand south to Ottoman-ruled territories in the Crimea and the Sea of Azov failed, and it was not until the Treaty of Niš in 1739 that their possession of Azov was recognized. Russo-Ottoman antagonism continued to grow over the following decades, as the two powers rivalled over influence in their borderlands in Crimea, Ukraine, Poland, and Moldavia, leading finally to the outbreak of war in 1768.

During the same period, Russian influence began to spread among the Christians living under Ottoman rule. Prophecies of a &#x27;golden nation&#x27; or &#x27;blonde nation&#x27; that would destroy the Ottoman Empire began circulating already in the 1690s, during the height of the Russo-Turkish War of 1686–1700. At the same time, the Franco-Ottoman alliance resulted in advantages for the Catholics in the Ottoman Empire, and particularly the Holy Land. This caused the Greek Orthodox patriarchs of Constantinople and Jerusalem to turn to Russia for support in recovering their privileges. The Austrian advance into the northwestern Balkans during the Great Turkish War also caused concern, with the Serbian patriarch and the ruler of Wallachia, Șerban Cantacuzino, seeking Russian support as early as 1688. The presence of a Russian ambassador at the Ottoman court from 1700 on also allowed direct contacts of Russian officials with the Ottoman Christians, while an increasing number of the latter sought refuge and employment in Russia, where Greek colonies were established.

===Outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774===

The Ottoman Empire had its longest period of peace between 1739 (Treaty of Belgrade) and 1768 - three decades when it did not engage any of its European rivals. Europe was caught up in costly and bloody conflicts while the Ottomans stayed out and tended to economy and politics, and rebuilding social and administrative organization. 

This peaceful period came to an end on 23 October 1768, when the Porte declared war on Russia. Causes included aggressive Russian foreign policy, Russian interference in Crimea (an Ottoman vassal), and the power struggle in Poland-Lithuania. There were insignificant events in 1768–69, as both sides prepared for a long campaign.

Meanwhile, Greek rebels were readied. Wishing to weaken the Ottoman Empire and establish a pro-Russian independent Greek state, Russian emissaries had been sent to Mani in the mid-1760s to make a pact with the strongest local military leaders, and at the same time notable Greeks approached various Russian agents, discussing plans for the liberation of Greece. In preparation for war, Russian agents promoted Greek rebellion to support military actions in the north. Russian artillery captain Grigorios Papadopoulos (or Georgios Papasoglu), a Greek, was dispatched to Mani. Georgios Papazolis, another Greek officer of the Russian army, cooperated with the brothers Grigory and Alexei Orlov in preparations for a Greek insurrection in the Morea during the Russian military operations against the Ottoman Empire in 1769. The organization of the Greek rebellion was put under brothers Orlov, with Alexei as the Russian fleet commander.

Some Greek notables joined the Russian side, and promised them men and supplies, while in return they expected massive Russian aid (10,000 soldiers and military equipment). Russia planned to incite Orthodox Christians to revolt, and sent agents to Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Crete and the Morea. Another Orlov brother, , was sent to coordinate rebels in Morea, deemed the most important strategic area in mainland Greece (due to its ports). Russia assembled a war fleet for deployment in the Mediterranean, described as &quot;one of the most spectacular events of the 18th century&quot;, which caught the Ottomans off-guard. The first fleet contingent (out of two) departed in August 1769 and arrived in the Aegean in December. This expedition of four ships, a few hundred soldiers and inadequate arms supplies greatly disappointed the Greeks. Nevertheless, combined Russian-Greek forces attempted a campaign.

==Progress of the revolt==

===Peloponnese===
The arrival of the Russian fleet in Mani in February 1770 saw the establishment of local armed groups in Mani and Kalamata. However, the small Russian expeditionary force could not convince a part of the local Greeks to take arms. The Russian manpower was much fewer than expected and mutual distrust developed between the Greek and Russian leaders. Among the Greek leaders that were approached were Panagiotis Benakis, a notable from Kalamata, the local metropolitan bishop Anthimos, and Cretan shipping magnate John Vlachos &quot;Daskalogiannis&quot;. Initially an army of 1,400 men was formed, but additional reinforcement of Cretans arrived the following days. The Greek forces were divided into major units (called legions) with the help of a small number of Russian officers and soldiers. The &quot;Eastern Spartan Legion&quot; in Laconia, with 1,200 men, was organized by P. P. Dolgorukov and led by Georgios &quot;Yiorgakis&quot; Mavromichalis, while the &quot;Western Spartan Legion&quot; in Messenia was led by G. M. Barkov and Antonios Psarros.

The Greek rebels were initially successful and managed to defeat Ottoman forces in Laconia and eastern Messenia in southern Morea. The revolt however failed to effectively spread, thus the fortresses of Navarino, Methone and the administrative center of Morea, Tripolitsa (modern Tripoli), remained in Ottoman hands. The rebels did manage to control the fortress of Mystras, where they set up a local government.

The population of Corinth rose in revolt and began to besiege nearby Nafplio. The Ottoman guard of the citadel of Monemvasia was also threatened. A total of 5,000 volunteers from the Ionian islands of Cephalonia and Zakynthos also reinforced the revolutionary forces in Peloponesse. Gastouni was also taken, while Patras was found under siege by the Greek units. Additional uprisings occurred around the towns of Mesolongi and Nafpaktos in central Greece.

In March 12 the western legion and the Russian fleet began to siege the fortress of Koroni. However, after six week the garrison couldn&#x27;t be taken.

===Crete===
Meanwhile, the Greek revolt in Crete was led by Daskalogiannis. Soon after Sfakians refused to pay taxes and revolted in great numbers. However, the support promised by the Russian emissaries never arrived at Crete and Daskalogiannis was left to his own devices. He managed to organize a band of 2,000 well armed men who descended from the mountains onto the plains of western Crete. There with messianic overtones they prepared for a week with feasting and in formations of small bands started to kill local Muslims in an unsuccessful effort to convince other Cretans to join them in their quest to overthrow the Ottomans. The Cretan uprising was soon suppressed by numerically superior Ottoman units. 

===Ottoman response===
In April the revolutionaries managed to capture the fortress of Navarino however the uprising was already doomed and the Russian fleet abandoned the region in following June.

As soon as the first news of the Russian-backed Greek revolt reached the Ottoman capital, the first anti-Greek pogroms broke out in various cities of the Ottoman Empire, including Smyrna.

With the assistance of Greek islanders, the Russian fleet was able to score a major victory against the Ottoman Navy in the Battle of Cesme, but this did not help the Greek army in Morea. As the Russians failed to bring the forces they promised, the revolt was soon crushed. Greek reinforcements from Macedonia and Olympus region faced opposition in their descent to Morea and thus were unable to assist the revolutionaries. Meanwhile, one of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s most competent military commanders and former Grand Vizier, Muhsinzade Mehmed Pasha, took up the command of the garrison at Nafplion and, after calling for militia from some northern provinces, he crushed the Russo-Greek expedition at Tripolitsa.

==Aftermath==

The Muslim Albanian mercenaries hired by the Ottomans remained in the Peloponnese for several years after the suppression of the revolt, periodically launching reprisals against the Greeks, thus taking revenge for the Christian forces that had massacred Muslim civilians and destroyed property during the uprising. Referred to by the local Greek populace as &quot;Turk-Albanians&quot;, those forces had also destroyed many cities and towns in Epirus during 1769–70. In Patras nearly no one was left alive after the Turkish-Albanian invasion. The city of Mystras was left in ruins and the metropolitan bishop Ananias was executed despite having saved the life of several Turks during the uprising. A great number of local Greeks were killed by the Albanian groups, while several children were sold to slavery. In nine years following the revolt c. 20,000-30,000 local Greeks either succumbed or left their homeland.

The Ottoman government was unable to pay the wages the Albanian mercenaries demanded for their service, causing the latter to ravage the region. In 1774 the Russo-Turkish War ended with the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca which granted general amnesty to the population. Nevertheless, attacks by Muslim Albanian mercenaries in the region continued not only against the Greek population but also against Turks. The extensive destruction and lack of control in the Peloponnese forced the central Ottoman government to send a regular Turkish military force to suppress those Albanian troops in 1779, and eventually drive them out from Peloponnese.

From the Russian point of view, Count Orlov&#x27;s mission was mostly a success, damaging the Ottoman fleet, directing Ottoman troops south, and contributing to the victory that led to the signing of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca.

From the Greek point of view, the revolt had significant consequences. On the one hand, it cost a huge number of lives (both in battle, and in the Ottoman reprisals that followed). On the other hand, the Milet-i Rum, of which Greek were a part, did well out of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. Greek ships, for example, gained the right to sail under the Russian flag and had open access to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. Russia gained the right to protect the Orthodox population and its churches and to build an Orthodox cathedral in Istanbul. Russia also obtained the right to appoint Consuls throughout the empire, and most of these were Greeks. The treaty ushered in major changes to the Greek world.

Greek connections to Russia became even stronger because of the influence of prominent Greeks in Russia such as Count Demetrio Mocenigo, Count Ioannis Kapodistrias, Alexandros Ypsilantis, Skarlatos D. Sturdza, Spyridon Destunis, and others who occupied high positions in the Russian imperial administration. In the decades after the revolt, tens of thousands of Greeks emigrated from the Ottoman to the Russian empire, establishing colonies in the Crimea and along the shores of the Sea of Azov. Cities like Mariupol and Taganrog became booming commercial centers dominated by Ottoman Greek immigrants and their Greek-Russian successors. They would play prominent roles in the history of Greece and the Greeks until their destruction in the 1930s.

==In popular culture==
The revolt was a crucial event for the further development of Philhellenism as an important literary movement in the Western world. As such, the protagonist in Friedrich Hölderlin&#x27;s novel &quot;Hyperion&quot; participates in a 1770 revolt inspired by the Orlov Revolt.

<doc id="434445" wikidata="Q5458209" url="?curid=434445" title="Flavored milk">
<text>Flavored milk is a sweetened dairy drink made with milk, sugar, flavorings, and sometimes food colorings. It may be sold as a pasteurized, refrigerated product, or as an ultra-high-temperature (UHT) treated product not requiring refrigeration. It may also be made in restaurants or homes by mixing flavorings into milk.

In New England, milk blended with flavored syrups such as chocolate or strawberry in a milkshake machine, is commonly called a &quot;milkshake&quot;; in other parts of the United States, a milkshake always includes ice cream or thickeners.

==Types==

Common flavourings include chocolate, coffee, malted milk, burberry, strawberry and banana. Commercial brand flavours include Horlicks, Nesquik and Milo. Bottled spiced (masala) milk is a popular beverage in the Indian subcontinent.

==Consumption==

Australia has the highest consumption of flavored milk in the world, drinking more than the per capita figure for any other country in 2003. It is particularly popular in the Australian states of South Australia and Western Australia. A 2013 &quot;Sunday Times&quot; article reported Western Australia was the &quot;flavoured milk capital of Australia,&quot; with a A$220-million industry, average consumption of per person, and more than 40 varieties of iced coffee alone available. Similarly, a 2006 &quot;Adelaide Advertiser&quot; reported South Australia consumed of flavored milk each year, with 82% of market share held by a single brand, Farmers Union. According to Coca-Cola Amatil, one of the largest bottlers in the Asia-Pacific region, South Australia is the only place where sales of flavored milk outstrip those of cola.

==Controversy and criticism==

Jamie Oliver, host of &quot;Jamie Oliver&#x27;s Food Revolution&quot;, brought attention in the United States to public schools that serve flavored milk in the school cafeterias. Flavored milk advocates claim that many children will avoid the nutrition found in milk unless it has been flavored, with the benefits of milk outweighing a few teaspoons of sugar. Opponents say that with rising levels of obesity and heart disease, flavored milk should be removed from schools and children should be taught to drink plain milk.

A 2018 analysis of more than 90 popular chilled flavored dairy milks revealed that a carton of flavored milk can contain as much sugar as a can of soft drink, with many of the bestselling brands containing more than a day&#x27;s worth of added sugar in a single serving.

Recently, there have been limited new regulations introduced to safeguard children&#x27;s meals. The latest policy, known as the fourth state-level Healthy Beverage Default law (HBD), aims to restrict sugary beverage options in children&#x27;s meals. However, it has been found ineffective in reducing children&#x27;s sugar intake. Despite efforts in various U.S. states like Illinois and Delaware to regulate flavored milk and 100% juice, there are still variations in fat content, size restrictions, and calorie limitations for children.

<text>Rodney Begnaud (born October 12, 1970) is an American professional wrestler and mixed martial artist, better known by the ring name Rodney Mack. He is signed to the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), where he performs under the ring name Damage as a member of Blunt Force Trauma, and is a former NWA World Tag Team Champion. He is best known for his time with WWE.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Training and independent circuit (1998–2002)===
After training with the Junkyard Dog, Begnaud made his professional wrestling debut in 1998 as Redd Dogg, and began competing for Southwestern independent promotions.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (2000)===
After working on the independent circuit, Mack signed on with Extreme Championship Wrestling in 2000, making his debut as a member of Da Baldies, a stable of members who all had bald heads.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2004)===
After ECW&#x27;s closure, Begnaud was signed by World Wrestling Entertainment and was assigned to their developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling. While in OVW, Begnaud formed a tag team with Shelton Benjamin called The Dogg Pound. Together, The Dogg Pound won their first and only Southern Tag Team Championship on July 17, 2002. Begnaud, under his Redd Dogg ring name, then made his televised WWE debut on the January 16, 2003 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. He was placed alongside John Cena in an enforcer role, replacing Bull Buchanan, who was betrayed by Cena. After only one appearance on the SmackDown! brand, Begnaud was immediately moved over to the Raw brand and was subsequently renamed Rodney Mack. He made his &quot;Raw&quot; debut by attacking D&#x27;Lo Brown on an episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, with Theodore Long switching his managerial services from Brown to Mack.

Mack restarted Theodore Long&#x27;s Thuggin&#x27; And Buggin&#x27; Enterprises stable, which eventually turned into a group of African Americans who worked a race angle in which they felt they were victims of racism and were being held down by &quot;The Man&quot;. Jazz later joined the group in April. As part of the race angle, Mack often competed in a &quot;White Boy Challenge&quot; on &quot;Raw&quot;, where he would proceed to squash white wrestlers. However, his undefeated streak in the White Boy Challenges was ended on June 23 when he was defeated by Goldberg in under 30 seconds. After the White Boy Challenge was scrapped due to his loss, Mack subsequently formed a tag team with Christopher Nowinski upon Nowinski&#x27;s inclusion within the stable despite him being white, with Nowinski claiming that he was also held down by &quot;The Man&quot; because of his intelligence. Together, Mack and Nowinski found some success as a tag team, their most notable victory being against the Dudley Boyz at Bad Blood on June 15. The team continued until Nowinski suffered an injury and was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome, which subsequently resulted in his retirement soon after.

To replace Nowinski, Theodore Long announced that Mark Henry would become Mack&#x27;s new tag team partner. Despite only being a team for short while, Mack and Henry were fairly successful and scored some upset victories over some prominent tag teams.

In November 2003, Mack suffered a knee injury which prevented him from wrestling. He was supposed to return to action between March and June 2004, but was sent back to OVW and worked &quot;Raw&quot; dark matches throughout June and July 2004. Mack made his return to WWE television on July 26, 2004, where he participated in an over the top rope battle royal for an opportunity to compete for the World Heavyweight Championship.

On November 4, Mack was released from his contract along with a few others, including his wife Jazz.

===Return to the independent circuit (2005–2007)===
After his release, Begnaud began competing on the independent circuit, most prominently for in NWA Cyberspace. In late 2005, Begnaud and Jazz opened Dirtysouth Championship Wrestling, an independent promotion based in Louisiana. However, DCW would be renamed Downsouth Championship Wrestling due to copyright issues in early 2006 before ceasing operations in early 2007.

===Return to WWE (2006–2007)===
On September 15, 2006, it was reported on WWE.com that Begnaud, along with Marty Jannetty and Brad Armstrong, had been hired by WWE. He started wrestling at ECW house shows on September 30, 2006. On January 18, 2007, Mack along with several other superstars (including his wife Jazz) were again released by WWE.

===Second return to the independent circuit (2007–2008, 2011–present)===
After leaving WWE, Begnaud would make sporadic appearances on the independent circuit under his Rodney Mack ring name before winning the All-American Wrestling Tag Team Championship with Heidenreich on May 18, 2008 after defeating Latinos Locos. However, the title was vacated soon after due to interference in the original title match.

After a 3 year hiatus due to the birth of his twins, on June 11, 2011, Begnaud wrestled for the first time in three years and, under his Rodney Mack ring name, he defeated Brad Michaels in a match for NWA Oklahoma. Exactly six months later, Mack defeated Faroh of Phunk to win the NWA Mississippi Heavyweight Championship, his first championship in over nine years. On February 10, 2012, Mack wrestled Scot Summers for the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship, but was unsuccessful in regaining the title. Following this, Mack would go on to lose the NWA Mississippi Heavyweight Title to Cale Conners on March 18.
Mack made an appearance at a Southeast Championship Wrestling charity event in Greenville, Mississippi.

On May 21, 2016, Mack defeated Scott McKenzie to become the AIWF Southwest Champion in Athens, TX. Through 2016 and 2017, Mack mainly competed for the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). In 2018 and in 2019 he has primarily appeared for Anarchy Championship Wrestling.

On August 26, 2023, under a mask with the ring name Damage, Mack won the NWA World Tag Team Championship as one half of Blunt Force Trauma by defeating La Rebelión at night one of the NWA 75th Anniversary Show.

==Mixed martial arts==
Begnaud, under his Rodney Mack ring name, made his mixed martial arts debut on June 7, 2008, knocking out Joe Nameth by ground-and-pound in 21 seconds in the first round. He lost his second match with Andrew Staples via submission by a rear naked choke.

In July 2016, Begnaud was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018.

<doc id="434455" wikidata="Q537252" url="?curid=434455" title="Paul Gleason">
<text>Paul Xavier Gleason (May 4, 1939 – May 27, 2006) was an American film and television actor. He was known for his roles on television series such as &quot;All My Children&quot; and films such as &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, &quot;Trading Places&quot;, and &quot;Die Hard&quot;.

==Early life==
Gleason was born on May 4, 1939, in Jersey City, New Jersey, the son of Eleanor (née Doyle), a registered nurse, and George L. Gleason, a restaurateur, professional boxer, iron worker, and roofing manufacturer. Gleason was raised in Miami Beach, Florida. At age 16, he ran away from home and hitchhiked across the east coast, sleeping on beaches and playing baseball. He attended North Miami High School and Florida State University, where he played football with Burt Reynolds. He signed a professional baseball contract with the Cleveland Indians, but played just briefly in two minor league seasons between 1959 and 1960.

In 1960, a West Coast trip led to an introduction to sitcom icon Ozzie Nelson, which, in turn, led to an appearance on &quot;Ozzie and Harriet&quot; (per Nelson&#x27;s habit of hiring athletes for guest spots on the show). Suddenly, acting was an option, and an increasingly attractive one, given Gleason&#x27;s failing baseball career. He moved to New York City, eventually joining The Actors Studio, where he would study for four years before moving to Los Angeles.

==Career==
Gleason starred in many movies, often as an antagonistic figure, and became well-known initially as Dr. David Thornton on &quot;All My Children&quot;, playing the role from 1976 to 1978. He then portrayed Capt. Ernest &quot;Tex&quot; Lee in the 1979 television miniseries &quot;Ike&quot;. He guest-starred in &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot; and &quot;Fire&quot;, two episodes of &quot;The A-Team&quot;. Additionally, Gleason played the villainous Clarence Beeks, the Duke brothers&#x27; security consultant and fixer, in the 1983 comedy &quot;Trading Places&quot; starring Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy.

Gleason played the disciplinarian Vice Principal Richard Vernon, in the 1985 coming-of-age film &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; opposite many members of the Brat Pack. The film has been noted as one of the most prominent and well-remembered of its genre, and many reviews praised Gleason&#x27;s performance as the vice principal who was frequently at odds with members of the titular group, particularly Judd Nelson&#x27;s John Bender. In an on-set interview, Gleason spoke at length about the skill of the teenage actors he worked with, adding that he believed he &quot;could never have been as good at [their] age.&quot; He also described the finale of the film, during which Vernon reads an essay from the Club dismantling his assertions about them, as a &quot;satori&quot; for the character, stating that Vernon is &quot;supposed to realize something about the fact that he has let these kids down, and that he really hasn&#x27;t understood them.&quot;

He played similar characters in the 1988 film &quot;Johnny Be Good&quot; (as a high school football coach), the 2002 film &quot;Van Wilder&quot; (as an antagonistic professor), and on several episodes of the TV sitcom &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; (as a university dean). He directly parodied his &quot;Breakfast Club&quot; role in the 2000 A-Teens music video for &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; and in the 2001 comedy film &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot;. In 2006, &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot; received a special citation at the MTV Movie Awards, honoring the film&#x27;s continued influence; Gleason and several other members of the cast were present to accept the award. When Gleason passed the same year, his NPR obituary referred to his turn as Vernon, referring to Gleason as &quot;a &#x27;principal&#x27; screen presence.&quot;

Gleason was known to &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans for his role as Jeremitt Towani in the 1985 made-for-TV film &quot;&quot;. In 1988, Gleason played Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson in the Bruce Willis action film, &quot;Die Hard&quot;. In his review of the film, critic Roger Ebert described Gleason&#x27;s character as having &quot;one purpose: to be consistently wrong at every step of the way,&quot; and as a foil for Willis and Reginald VelJohnson.

In 2002, Gleason appeared in episodes of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; as Larry Newman, the sex-and-violence obsessed chief of a B movie studio. He appeared as a nonsensical judge in an episode of &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot;, as well as in an episode of &quot;George Lopez&quot; as the brother of George&#x27;s boss, a crazy old drunk. In 2005, he appeared as the Sheriff in the horror film &quot;Abominable&quot;. Gleason made a guest appearance on &quot;Friends&quot; as Jack, Phoebe&#x27;s boss at an investment company, in the season 6 episode &quot;The One That Could Have Been,&quot; and also appeared in one episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, as the man ultimately responsible for George Costanza (Jason Alexander) being hired by the New York Yankees. His final appearance before his death was in an independent film called &quot;The Book of Caleb&quot;.

==Personal life ==
Gleason, in addition to his acting career, participated in many celebrity charity golf events each year, and was known to mingle with fans and sign autographs during these golf tournaments. Shortly before his death, he also published a book of poetry. During his Minor League Baseball career, he also struck up a friendship with Ted Williams, which he later discussed in the book &quot;Ted Williams: A Tribute&quot;, published in 1997. Actor Jimmy Hawkins, a friend of Gleason&#x27;s stated after his passing that &quot;he always had great stories to tell.&quot;

From 1971 to 1978, he was married to actress Candy Moore; they had one daughter, Shannon. From 1995 until his death, he was married to Susan Kehl; they had one daughter, Kaitlin. At the time of his passing, he also had a granddaughter.

==Death==
Gleason died on May 27, 2006, at a Burbank, California, hospital from pleural mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung connected with asbestos, which he is thought to have contracted from asbestos exposure on building sites while working for his father as a teenager. Gleason was 67 years old. He is buried near the southeast corner of the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, Los Angeles.

<text>Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester, (c. 146015 March 1526) was an English nobleman and politician. He was the bastard son of Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset by his mistress Joan Hill.

==Origins==
Somerset was born in about 1460, an illegitimate son of Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset by his mistress Joan Hill. He was legitimised. 

==Career==
Somerset was invested as a Knight of the Garter in about 1496. On his marriage in 1492 he was styled Baron Herbert in right of his wife, and in 1506 he was created Baron Herbert of Ragland, Chepstow and Gower. 

On 1 February 1514, he was created Earl of Worcester and was at some time appointed Lord Chamberlain of the Household to King Henry VIII. As Lord Chamberlain, Somerset was largely responsible for the preparations for the Field of Cloth of Gold in 1520.

Somerset was both raised to high rank in the Henry VIII&#x27;s reign and was personally connected with leading members of the nobility. For example, he stood in surety for the loan from the King taken by Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury to pay for her husbands burial.

==Marriages and children==
He married three times, although his second marriage is uncertain.

Firstly on 2 June 1492, he married Elizabeth Herbert, 3rd Baroness Herbert (died before March 1513), daughter of William Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, &quot;jure exoris&quot; 2nd Baron Herbert. By Elizabeth Herbert he had the following children:

* Henry Somerset, 2nd Earl of Worcester, only son and heir. He married firstly and by papal dispensation to Lady Margaret Courtenay, daughter of William Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon and Catherine of York. He married secondly to Elizabeth Browne, daughter of Anthony Browne and Lucy Neville, and had issue.

*Elizabeth Somerset, his only daughter, wife successively of Sir John Savage and Sir William Brereton.
Secondly he allegedly married Elizabeth West, daughter of Sir Thomas West, 8th Baron De La Warr. His supposed marriage to Elizabeth West, however, may be an error made by William Dugdale, repeated by later writers. By Elizabeth West he supposedly had the following children:
*Sir Charles Somerset
*Sir George Somerset
*Lady Mary Somerset of Worcester, married firstly to William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton and secondlt to Robert Carre.
Thirdly he married Eleanor Sutton, daughter of Edward Sutton, 2nd Baron Dudley. After Somerset&#x27;s death, she married secondly to Leonard Grey, 1st Viscount Grane.

His descendants include the Marquesses of Worcester, the Dukes of Beaufort and Thomas Savage, 1st Viscount Savage.

==Death and burial==
Somerset died on 15 March 1526 and was buried with his first wife at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle.

<text>The Minims, officially known as the Order of Minims (; abbreviated OM), and known in German-speaking countries as the Paulaner Order (), are a Roman Catholic religious order of friars founded by Francis of Paola in fifteenth-century Italy. The order soon spread to France, Germany and Spain, and continues to exist today.

Like the other mendicant orders, there are three separate components, or orders, of the movement: the friars, contemplative nuns and a Third Order of laypeople who live in the spirit of the order in their daily lives. At present there are only two fraternities of the Minim tertiaries; both are in Italy.

==History==

The founder of the order, Francis of Paola, was born in 1416 and named in honor of Francis of Assisi. The boy became ill when he was only one month old, and his mother prayed to Saint Francis and promised that her son would spend a year in a Franciscan friary if he were healed. Francis recovered, which she believed meant that God had granted her prayer. At 13 years of age Francis fulfilled that votive year. After this year he dedicated himself to a life of solitude and penance as a hermit.

In 1435, two followers joined Francis and began the community, which was first called the &quot;Poor Hermits of St. Francis of Assisi.&quot; Francis and his followers founded hermitages at Paterno in 1444 and Milazzo, Sicily, in 1469. The Archbishop of Cosenza approved the group and established them as a religious order on November 30, 1470, and this approval was confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV in his bull &quot;Sedes Apostolica&quot; of May 17, 1474. At that time, the pope also changed their status from that of hermits to mendicant friars.

The name &quot;Minims&quot; comes from the Italian word &quot;minimo&quot;, meaning the smallest or the least, and their founder would call himself &quot;il minimo dei minimi&quot;. Francis of Paola wanted to distinguish himself as being of even less significance than the Friars Minor founded by his patron saint. Francis composed a rule for the community in 1493, which was approved under the name of &quot;Hermits of the Order of the Minims&quot;. The definitive version of the rule was solemnly approved by Pope Julius II in the Bull &quot;Inter ceteros&quot;, July 28, 1506, who also simplified the name of the community to the Order of Minims ().

In addition to the standard three religious vows of chastity, poverty and obedience, the rule contains the vow of &quot;a Lenten way of life&quot; (), which is considered to be the distinctive feature of the Minims. This vow is for perpetual abstinence from all meat, eggs and dairy products, except in case of grave illness and by order of a physician. The order is also discalced.

The Minim habit consists of a black wool tunic, with broad sleeves, a hood, and a short scapular. It has a thick, black cord (with four knots that signify the four vows) with a tassel to gird the robe.

The Order of the Minims spread throughout Italy in the fifteenth century and was introduced to France in 1482, and later to Spain and to Germany in 1497. The houses in Spain, Germany, and France were suppressed during the period following the French Revolution. By the turn of the 20th century, only 19 friaries remained, all but one of them in Italy. On December 31, 2010, the order had 46 communities with 174 members, 112 of them priests. The majority of these were in Italy, but they are also established in Brazil, Cameroon, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Czech Republic, India, Mexico, Spain, and the United States of America.

==Paulaner brewery==
The Munich friary of the German Minims brewed beer as means of support, but after the friars were expelled, the brewery continued independently. It continues to brew the Paulaner brand of beer, which draws its name from Francis of Paola.

==Notable Minim friars==

* Gaspar de Bono (1530–1604)
*Marin Mersenne (1588–1648)
*Emmanuel Maignan (1601–1676)
*Jean François Niceron (1613–1646)
*Nicholas Barré (1621–1686)
*Charles Plumier (1646–1704)
*Nicholas of Longobardi (1650–1709) canonized in 2014

*Louis Feuillée (1660–1732)

==Notable Minim tertiaries==
*Francis de Sales (1567–1622)
*Vincent de Paul (1581–1660)

==The nuns==
Francis was called to France in 1483 by King Louis XI to serve as his deathbed confessor. While he was there, the Spanish ambassador, Don Pedro de Lucena, who was a very pious man, grew to know and admire him. He sent reports of the holy friar to his family back in Jaén. His daughter, Elena, and her two daughters, Maria and Francisca, felt so inspired by Don Pedro&#x27;s reports, they wanted to dedicate themselves to the way of life Francis had established. Through the ambassador, they communicated their interest to the saint, and asked for a rule of life which they might follow. Francis welcomed their request heartily, and, to this end, he adapted the rule of the friars for them to live as cloistered nuns.

Don Pedro donated a portion of his estate to the young women, and there they formed a small monastic community. They received the Minim religious habit from a Friar Lionet on June 11, 1495, and established the Monastery of Jesus and Mary. This was first and remains the oldest monastery of the Minim nuns. Francisca was elected as the first corrector (religious superior) of the community. She spent many years as the corrector of the monastery, gaining a reputation for holiness, and is today honored as Blessed Francisca. Their proper rule was approved by the Holy See in 1506, at the same time as that of the friars.

The Federation of Minim Nuns of Saint Francis of Paola includes 14 monasteries in Spain, Italy, Mexico, and the Philippines.

===Notable Minim nuns===
A new community was established in Barcelona on Easter 1623. In 1936, the 25 members of the community in Barcelona were arrested by soldiers of the Republic of Spain. Charged with treason, nine choir nuns and an extern Sister were executed on July 23. They were beatified by Pope Francis on October 13, 2013, and are commemorated on July 23.

<doc id="434471" wikidata="Q2996239" url="?curid=434471" title="Annapolis Convention (1774–1776)">
<text>The Annapolis Convention was an Assembly of the Counties of Maryland that functioned as the colony&#x27;s provincial government from 1774 to 1776 during the early days leading up to the American Revolution. After 1775, it was officially named the Assembly of Freemen.

==Background==

In 1774, the committees of correspondence that had sprung up throughout the colonies were being drawn to the support of Boston, as they reacted to the closing of the port and increase of the occupying military force. Massachusetts had asked for a general meeting or Continental Congress to consider joint action. To forestall any such action, the royal governor of Maryland, Robert Eden prorogued the Assembly on April 19, 1774. 
This was the last session of the colonial assembly ever held in Maryland. But, the assembly members agreed to meet in June at Annapolis after they went home to determine the wishes of the citizens in the counties they represented.

Over the next two and a half years, the Convention met nine times and operated as the state or colony level of government for Maryland. Throughout the period, they maintained some standing committees that continued their function between sessions.

==Sessions of the Convention==

===1774 sessions===
The first convention lasted four days, from June 22 to June 25, 1774. All sixteen counties were represented by a total of 92 members. They elected Matthew Tilghman as their chair. Within that short time, they agreed:
*That each county should have one vote.
*Passed resolutions supporting Boston, and ordered supplies sent to them.
*The Convention would continue from time to time as needed.
*A &quot;Committee of Correspondence&quot; would continue between sessions, and members were named.
*They would support non-importation agreements if the Continental Congress called for them.
*Elected delegates to the first Continental Congress.
Other sessions were held on November 21 – November 25, and December 8 – December 12.

===1775 sessions===
July 26 – August 14 and December 7, 1775 – January 28, 1776

==== Declaration of the Association of the Freemen of Maryland ====

=====Note by Maryland Historical Society=====
The original engagement of the Associators, preserved under glass at Annapolis, consists of two pieces, apparently torn apart, and pasted down on card-board. On our p. 67 the order of names and arrangement of columns have been preserved, though not the spacing; and the division of the pieces falls just below the names of Joseph Sim, Thomas Dorsey, and Charles Ridgely.

On comparing these signatures with the Journal, 29 names will be found to be missing, viz: Philip Richard Fendall I (1734–1805) of Charles Co.; Alexander Somerville of Calvert; George Lee and Dr Richard Brooke of Prince George&#x27;s; Thomas Tillard and John Dorsey of Anne Arundel; Walter Tolly, James Gittings, and Charles Ridgely of John, of Baltimore; Charles Beatty, Baker Johnson, Jacob Funk, Samuel Beall, and Wm. Deakins Jr., of Frederick; Samuel Durham, Saml. Ashmead, John Beall Howard, Francis Holland, Benjamin Rumsey, and James McComas, of Harford; Joseph Gilpin and William Rumsey, of Cecil; Richard Lloyd of Kent; John Wallace and John Brown, of Queen Anne&#x27;s; Robert Harrison of Dorchester; Benson Stainton of Caroline; Josiah Polk of Somerset; Peter Chaille of Worcester.

Now when we note that amongst these 29 were some of the most active and assiduous members of the Convention, and that 21 of them had, as the Journal shows, no leave of absence, it is impossible to resist the conclusion that a portion of the document has been lost. It will be observed that the arrangement is generally by counties, and the break in the paper comes between Prince George&#x27;s and Queen Anne&#x27;s, between Ann Arundel and Dorchester, and between Baltimore and Worcester; a fact which confirms the editor&#x27;s belief that a piece has fallen out between the upper and lower portions as now joined.

===1776 sessions===
May 8 – May 25, June 21 – July 6, and August 14 – November 11

The eighth session decided that the continuation of an &quot;ad hoc&quot; government by the convention was not a good mechanism for all the concerns of the province. A more permanent and structured government was needed. So, on July 3, 1776, they resolved that a new convention be elected that would be responsible for drawing up their first state constitution, one that did not refer to parliament or the king, but would be a government &quot;...of the people only.&quot; After they set dates and prepared notices to the counties they adjourned. On August 1 all freemen with property elected delegates for the last convention.

The ninth and last convention was also known as the Constitutional Convention of 1776. They drafted a constitution, and when they adjourned on November 11, they would not meet again. The Conventions were replaced by the new state government.

<text>National Steel is a blues album by Canadian musician Colin James, released in 1997. The album was recorded at Rat&#x27;s Ass Studios and Mushroom Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia, and mastered at MasterDisk in New York City.

James teamed up with his longtime friend Colin Linden to record a predominantly acoustic album running the gamut from delta blues, to jug band and Chicago blues. The album covers songs written by some of the greatest bluesmen including Otis Redding, Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, and Willie Dixon.

The album is titled after the resonator guitar made by the National guitar company, also pictured on the album&#x27;s cover.

&quot;National Steel&quot; earned James the 1998 Juno Award for Best Blues Album.

<text>Robert Nold &quot;Red&quot; Byron (March 12, 1915 – November 11, 1960) was an American stock car racing driver, who was successful in NASCAR competition in the sanctioning body&#x27;s first years. He was NASCAR&#x27;s first Modified champion (and its first champion in any division) in 1948 and its first Strictly Stock (predecessor to NASCAR Cup Series) champion in 1949. Along with Bob Flock, he is considered one of the best drivers of the era. He won the first NASCAR race at Daytona Beach and Road Course and won the inaugural NASCAR Strictly Stock driver&#x27;s championship.

==Background==
Born in Washington County, Virginia, he moved to Colorado at a young age, and then to Anniston, Alabama, which he considered his hometown. Byron began racing in 1932 and was successful in racing at Talladega and Anniston by the start of the 1940s. Byron then made his way to Lakewood Speedway, where he raced any ride he could find. While racing at Lakewood Speedway, he was noticed by Raymond Parks, a former bootlegger and illegal gambling kingpin and current vending machine operator, as well as his mechanic, Red Vogt. Byron would race with Parks at Lakewood Speedway through the spring of 1941.

In the spring of 1941, Byron enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps at an enlistment station in Montgomery, Alabama. Byron was eventually stationed as a flight engineer on B-24 Liberator bombers during World War II, flying in fifty-eight missions while serving engineer duties and tail gunning duties. In 1944, Byron joined his 58th mission after subbing for a fellow serviceman whose wife was going into labor. The mission was targeted for Paramushir, where members of the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy were stationed. The B-24&#x27;s full assortment of bombs were dropped except for the final one, which was hung on the floor of the aircraft. As the engineer, it was Byron&#x27;s job to free the hung bomb from the aircraft. After freeing the bomb, Byron was hit by an explosion while he was still near the open doors of the aircraft. It is speculated that the freed bomb exploded while falling out of the aircraft but Byron strongly believed that he had been hit by anti-aircraft fire. The explosion tore Byron&#x27;s left leg to pieces. A large amount of shrapnel was removed from Byron&#x27;s leg at a makeshift air base hospital, before being sent to Fitzsimons Army Medical Center where he spent 27 months in rehabilitation.

While in rehabilitation, Byron began sketching devices that would help him return to racing despite the limited movement of his left leg. In 1946, while working on ideas with Vogt, Byron fabricated two stirrup pins on his clutch pedal to help support his left leg. When the stirrup pins were combined with his leg brace, he was able to operate the clutch pedal.

==Racing career==
Before World War II, Byron raced in the AAA Indy series, mainly in Sprint Cars and Midgets. He achieved his first Stock Car victory in July 1941, while on two-day liberty from training with the USAAF, and with the war intervening, did not return to racing for five years.

Following a lengthy recovery from a leg injury sustained in war, he returned to racing in 1945 and with the help of race engineer Red Vogt, was still successful.

He won the Hankinson Memorial on February 24, 1946, at Seminole Speedway, beating Roy Hall and Bill France. This was his first win since returning to racing in 1945.

On July 20, 1946, Byron finished 2nd in the inaugural race at Selinsgrove Speedway. The race was part of the AAA Big Car Championship. The race was won by Bill Holland.

NASCAR Modified

1948

In 1948, Byron became a part of the newly-formed NASCAR Modified Series racing with Raymond Parks&#x27; team. He won the Rayson Memorial, the first NASCAR sanctioned race. The race took place at the Daytona Beach Road Course, where Byron beat Marshall Teague and Bob Flock. In the second race of the season at Speedway Park, Byron finished third to Fonty Flock and Bob Flock. In the third race of the season, Byron finished second to Fonty Flock at Lakewood Speedway. In the fourth race of the season at Central City Speedway, Byron finished sixth while his championship rival, Fonty Flock, won the race. The fifth race of the season at Hayloft Speedway saw Byron finish outside of the positions that paid points. On April 18, Byron finished second to Fonty Flock at the Greensboro Fairgrounds.

Following a slight drought in winning, Byron would win on April 25 at North Wilkesboro Speedway, beating Fonty Flock and Tim Flock in the sixty lap feature race. Byron would win the next race he started on May 2 at Lakeview Speedway, beating Fonty Flock and Marshall Teague. Byron would win again on May 9 at the Wadesboro Dirt Track, beating Fonty Flock and Roscoe Thompson. At this point in the season, Byron and Fonty Flock had found themselves into a rivalry over the points lead of the series. On May 16, Byron would win at the Atlantic Rural Exposition Fairgrounds, beating Bill Blair and Fonty Flock. Flock wouldn&#x27;t find himself in a points paying position again until May 30, when he finished second at North Wilkesboro Speedway to Marshall Teague. Byron would pick up the win in the June 5 race at the Greensboro Fairgrounds, passing polesitter Speedy Thompson for first place and beating Tim Flock and Fonty Flock. On July 11, Byron would once again decrease Fonty Flock’s point lead when he won at Charlotte Speedway, passing polesitter Jack Smith for the lead and beating Fonty Flock and Tim Flock. The race, originally scheduled for one hundred laps was shortened to ninety-one laps due to rain.

Byron would race on July 18 at North Wilkesboro Speedway but missed the points due to an issue. Fonty Flock also missed out on points so the race had little impact on the points positions. Curtis Turner would win the race. On July 25, Byron would finish outside of the points yet again at Columbus Speedway after Tragedy had struck. The front-right tire of Byron’s car blew, causing the car to veer off the track and into a group of spectators, injuring sixteen and killing a seven-year-old boy. Shockingly, Byron was not injured in the accident. Later in the race, driver Bill “Slick” Davis was also killed after his car rolled over in a crash.

On August 8, Byron finished third at the Daytona Beach Road Course. Fonty Flock won the race, extending his points lead. On August 15, Byron finished sixth in a two-hundred lap race at Langhorne Speedway. Fonty Flock did not finish in the points which helped Byron shorten his lead in the points championship. On September 5, Byron finished third at Columbus Speedway after the race was halted due to rain. Fonty Flock did not finish ahead of Byron which shortened his points lead even more. On September 12, Byron would finish third twice at Charlotte Speedway during a double header while Fonty Flock and Tim Flock would be involved in a bad four car pile up. Due to the pile up, the second race was shortened from forty laps to twenty-four laps. These results shortened Fonty Flock’s points lead even further. Unfortunately for Byron, Fonty Flock would win three in a row through the month of September between a double header sweep at Occoneechee Speedway and a win at Lakeview Speedway, extending the points lead once again.

On October 3, during a double header at Central City Speedway, Byron would finish third at in race one, ahead of Fonty Flock, shrinking the points deficit. In race two of the double header, Byron fought his way from tenth to first to win the race, giving him the series points lead. On October 10, Byron would finish a close second to Fonty Flock at the Greensboro Fairgrounds. On October 16, Byron would once again finish a close second to Fonty Flock at the Greensboro Fairgrounds. On October 17, a day after finishing second to Flock at Greensboro, Byron would win at North Wilkesboro Speedway in a one hundred lap feature race. On October 24, Byron would win another one hundred lap feature race at Charlotte Speedway, with Fonty Flock coming in second. Fonty Fock would win the next race on October 31 at the Forsyth County Fairgrounds, with Byron coming in second after racing close with Flock for most of the race. The season final was held on November 14 at Columbus Raceway. The race saw Byron win with Fonty Flock coming in second. With the season final finished, Byron was officially crowned the 1948 NASCAR Modified Champion. Byron accumulated 11 wins and 25 top fives during the season.

1949

In 1949, Byron ran a more limited schedule in the NASCAR Modified Division, starting 11 races. The first modified race that Byron participated in during the 1949 season was on January 23, where Byron would bring his car home in fifth place at Broward Speedway. Despite its large schedule, Byron would not start another modified race sanctioned by NASCAR until April 3, where he would take the win over Curtis Turner and Bill Blair at Charlotte Speedway in a forty lap feature race. Following his win at Charlotte, Byron would enter the April 10 race at the Greensboro Fairgrounds. Byron would finish second to Curtis Tuner. The next race that Byron entered was the April 17 race at Lakeview Speedway, where he would finish fourth. Byron&#x27;s next start would come on May 8 at Lakewood Speedway, where he would finish third, behind Olin Allen and Jack Smith. on May 15, Byron would head back to Charlotte Speedway and win his second consecutive modified race at the track. On May 22, Byron would head to North Wilkesboro Speedway, where he would finish second to Tim Flock.

Byron would make his way to Lakeview Speedway on May 29, where he would finish second to Tim Flock again. Flock would then have two third-place results on June 26 during a double header at Harris Speedway, finishing behind Curtis Turner and Jack Smith in race one. In race two, Byron finished behind Tim Flock and Fonty Flock. Byron would move to focusing on the NASCAR Strictly Stock series full time, not making another start in the Modified Division. Byron would finish every race and end the season with eleven starts, two wins, ten top fives, and eleven top tens. He would end the season seventh in points despite starting less than a quarter of the seasons races.

1950

In 1950, Byron started two races in the Modified Division, both coming in March. On March 5, Byron won a one hundred lap race at Charlotte Speedway, beating Al Keller and Tommy Coates. In Byron&#x27;s second and final race of the year on March 19, Byron finished second to Tim Flock in a fifty lap feature at Occoneechee Speedway.

NASCAR Strictly Stock/Grand National

1949

In 1949, Byron began racing in NASCAR&#x27;s newly formed Strictly Stock series, which became the Grand National series, Winston Cup, and the modern-day NASCAR Cup Series. With Parks in tow, Byron was equally successful in the inaugural eight-race season. In race one on June 19 at Charlotte Speedway, Byron would finish 3rd behind Jim Roper and career rival Fonty Flock. In race two at the Daytona Beach Road Course, Byron would win the race after Gober Sosebee, who led thirty-four of the forty scheduled laps, had an issue with seven to go. Byron would lead the final six laps in route to victory. On August 7, during the third race of the season at Occoneechee Speedway, Byron finished twenty-second after being involved in a five-car pileup on the thirty-ninth lap. Byron entered the fourth race of the season on September 11 at Langhorne Speedway, qualifying on the pole for the race. After battling with Curtis Turner and Bob Flock for two hundred laps, Byron finished the race in the third position.

Byron did not compete in the fifth race of the year on September 18 at Hamburg Speedway, as most regulars did not compete due to the event being competed so far north. Byron would compete in the September 25 race at Martinsville Speedway, winning the race and leading an impressive ninety seven laps. The victory at Martinsville all but wrapped up the championship for Byron, leading him to sit out of race seven at Heidelberg Raceway on October 2. The eighth and final race of the season was the Wilkes 200, taking place on October 16. Byron finished sixteenth and was crowned Strictly Stock Champion at the conclusion of the race by a margin of 117.5 points over Lee Petty. Byron finished the season with two wins, four top fives, and four top tens. Byron, as with his previous year in a modified, ended the year as the series&#x27; first champion.

1950

Due to declining health relating to his leg injury, Byron started racing less and less. Byron raced just four of the nineteen races of the 1950 NASCAR Grand National season. On February 5, Byron finished second in the first race of the season at the Daytona Beach Road Course after battling with winner Harold Kite for most of the race. In race two on April 2 at Charlotte Speedway, Byron finished fourth after leading forty two laps. Byron did not return to the series again until race thirteen, where he finished third in the 1950 Southern 500. The last race that Byron ran in the season was the 1950 Wilkes 200, where he would finish nineteenth with a spindle issue. This was the first season that Byron had gone winless in NASCAR sanctioned competition. Byron would finish the season with zero wins, three top fives, and three top tens.

1951

In 1951, Byron ran just five of the forty one races included in the NASCAR Grand National schedule. The first race that Byron ran was the season opener at the Daytona Beach Road Course on February 11. Byron would finish eleventh after not leading any laps. Byron would then go on to race in the tenth race of the season on June 10 at Columbus Speedway where he would finish sixth. Byron would then race the eleventh race on June 16 at Columbia Speedway, where he would finish thirtieth. His thirtieth-place finish was the worst finish of his NASCAR Grand National career. Byron wouldn&#x27;t race again until the twentieth race of the season, The Motor City 250, on August 12 at the Michigan State Fairgrounds. Byron would finish the race in fourth, nine laps down. The last race of the season that Byron entered was the Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway. This start would be the last of his career. Byron would finish the race in the twenty fifth position following in accident. Byron would round out the year with zero wins, one top fives, and two top tens.

Byron raced sparingly after his two championships. He owned a sports car racing team for much of the 1950s.

==Life after driving==
Declining health forced him to hang up his goggles in 1951, but he remained active in racing. He worked with Briggs Cunningham, who was trying to develop an American sports car that could win Grand Prix races, then become manager of a Corvette team with the same goal. Neither project succeeded, but Byron enjoyed sports cars.

On January 19, 2018, Byron was inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame&#x27;s Class of 2018.

==Death==
Byron died of a heart attack in a Chicago hotel room on November 11, 1960, at the age of 45, he was in Chicago to talk with Anheuser-Busch executives about starting a sports car team. At the time of his death, Byron was managing the Scarab SCCA team which was owned by Augi Pabst and Harry Heuer. Byron was set to fly to Daytona Beach the next day to be with the team for the championship race that weekend at Daytona International Speedway. The race was set to be the team&#x27;s last race before disbanding.

<doc id="434485" wikidata="Q212318" url="?curid=434485" title="The City of God">
<text>On the City of God Against the Pagans (), often called The City of God, is a book of Christian philosophy written in Latin by Augustine of Hippo in the early 5th century AD. The book was in response to allegations that Christianity brought about the decline of Rome and is considered one of Augustine&#x27;s most important works, standing alongside &quot;The Confessions&quot;, &quot;The Enchiridion&quot;, &quot;On Christian Doctrine&quot;, and &quot;On the Trinity&quot;. As a work of one of the most influential Church Fathers, &quot;The City of God&quot; is a cornerstone of Western thought, expounding on many questions of theology, such as the suffering of the righteous, the existence of evil, the conflict between free will and divine omniscience, and the doctrine of original sin.

==Background==

The sack of Rome by the Visigoths in 410 left Romans in a deep state of shock, and many Romans saw it as punishment for abandoning traditional Roman religion in favor of Christianity. In response to these accusations, and in order to console Christians, Augustine wrote &quot;The City of God&quot; as an argument for the truth of Christianity over competing religions and philosophies. He argues that Christianity was not responsible for the Sack of Rome but instead responsible for Rome&#x27;s success. Even if the earthly rule of the Empire was imperiled, it was the City of God that would ultimately triumph. Augustine&#x27;s focus was Heaven, a theme of many Christian works of Late Antiquity. Despite Christianity&#x27;s designation as the official religion of the Empire, Augustine declared its message to be spiritual rather than political. Christianity, he argued, should be concerned with the mystical, heavenly city, the New Jerusalem, rather than with earthly politics.

The book presents human history as a conflict between what Augustine calls the Earthly City (often colloquially referred to as the City of Man, and mentioned once on page 644, chapter 1 of book 15) and the City of God, a conflict that is destined to end in victory for the latter. The City of God is marked by people who forgo earthly pleasure to dedicate themselves to the eternal truths of God, now revealed fully in the Christian faith. The Earthly City, on the other hand, consists of people who have immersed themselves in the cares and pleasures of the present, passing world.

Augustine&#x27;s thesis depicts the history of the world as universal warfare between God and the Devil. This metaphysical war is not limited by time but only by geography on Earth. In this war, God moves (by divine intervention, Providence) those governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Catholic Church (the City of God) in order to oppose by all means—including military—those governments, political/ideological movements and military forces aligned (or aligned the most) with the Devil (the City of the World).

This concept of world history guided by Divine Providence in a universal war between God and the Devil is part of the official doctrine of the Catholic Church as most recently stated in the Second Vatican Council&#x27;s document: &quot;The Church ... holds that in her most benign Lord and Master can be found the key, the focal point and the goal of man, as well as of all human history ... all of human life, whether individual or collective, shows itself to be a dramatic struggle between good and evil, between light and darkness ... The Lord is the goal of human history the focal point of the longings of history and of civilization, the center of the human race, the joy of every heart and the answer to all its yearnings.&quot;

==Structure==
* Part I (Books I–X): a polemical critique of Roman religion and philosophy, corresponding to the Earthly City
** Book I–V: A critique of pagan religion
*** Book I: a criticism of the pagans who attribute the sack of Rome to Christianity despite being saved by taking refuge in Christian churches. The book also explains good and bad things happen to righteous and wicked people alike, and it consoles the women violated in the recent calamity.
*** Book II: a proof that because of the worship of the pagan gods, Rome suffered the greatest calamity of all, that is, moral corruption.
*** Book III: a proof that the pagan gods failed to save Rome numerous times in the past from worldly disasters, such as the sack of Rome by the Gauls.
*** Book IV: a proof that the power and long duration of the Roman empire was due not to the pagan gods but to the Christian God.
*** Book V: a refutation of the doctrine of fate and an explanation of the Christian doctrine of free will and its consistency with God&#x27;s omniscience. The book proves that Rome&#x27;s dominion was due to the virtue of the Romans and explains the true happiness of the Christian emperors.
** Book VI–X: A critique of pagan philosophy
*** Book VI: a refutation of the assertion that the pagan gods are to be worshipped for eternal life (rather than temporal benefits). Augustine claimed that even the esteemed pagan theologist Varro held the gods in contempt.
*** Book VII: a demonstration that eternal life is not granted by Janus, Jupiter, Saturn, and other select gods.
*** Book VIII: an argument against the Platonists and their natural theology, which Augustine views as the closest approximation of Christian truth, and a refutation of Apuleius&#x27; insistence of the worship of demons as mediators between God and man. The book also contains a refutation against Hermeticism.
*** Book IX: a proof that all demons are evil and that only Christ can provide man with eternal happiness.
*** Book X: a teaching that the good angels wish that God alone is worshipped and a proof that no sacrifice can lead to purification except that of Christ.
* Part II (Books XI–XXII): discussion on the City of God and its relationship to the Earthly City
** Books XI–XIV: the origins of the two cities
*** Book XI: the origins of the two cities from the separation of the good and bad angels, and a detailed analysis of Genesis 1.
*** Book XII: answers to why some angels are good and others bad, and a close examination of the creation of man.
*** Book XIII: teaching that death originated as a penalty for Adam&#x27;s sin, the fall of man.
*** Book XIV: teachings on the original sin as the cause for future lust and shame as a just punishment for lust.
** Books XV–XVIII: the history or progress of the two cities, including foundational theological principles about Jews.
*** Book XV: an analysis of the events in Genesis between the time of Cain and Abel to the time of the flood.
*** Book XVI: the progress of the two cities from Noah to Abraham, and the progress of the heavenly city from Abraham to the kings of Israel.
*** Book XVII: the history of the city of God from Samuel to David and to Christ, and Christological interpretations of the prophecies in Kings and Psalms.
*** Book XVIII: the parallel history of the earthly and heavenly cities from Abraham to the end. Doctrine of Witness, that Jews received prophecy predicting Jesus, and that Jews are dispersed among the nations to provide independent testimony of the Hebrew Scriptures.
** Books XIX–XXII: the deserved destinies of the two cities.
*** Book XIX: the end of the two cities, and the happiness of the people of Christ.
*** Book XX: the prophecies of the Last Judgment in the Old and New Testaments.
*** Book XXI: the eternal punishment for the city of the devil.
*** Book XXII: the eternal happiness for the saints and explanations of the resurrection of the body.
