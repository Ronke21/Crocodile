<text>In physics, the principle of locality states that an object is influenced directly only by its immediate surroundings. A theory that includes the principle of locality is said to be a &quot;local theory&quot;. This is an alternative to the concept of instantaneous, or &quot;non-local&quot; action at a distance. Locality evolved out of the field theories of classical physics. The idea is that for a cause at one point to have an effect at another point, something in the space between those points must mediate the action. To exert an influence, something, such as a wave or particle, must travel through the space between the two points, carrying the influence.

The special theory of relativity limits the maximum speed at which causal influence can travel to the speed of light, formula_1. Therefore, the principle of locality implies that an event at one point cannot cause a truly simultaneous result at another point. An event at point formula_2 cannot cause a result at point formula_3 in a time less than formula_4, where formula_5 is the distance between the points and formula_1 is the speed of light in vacuum.

The principle of locality plays a critical role in one of the central results of quantum mechanics. In 1935, Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, with their EPR paradox thought experiment, raised the possibility that quantum mechanics might not be a complete theory. They described two systems physically separated after interacting; this pair would be called &quot;entangled&quot; in modern terminology. They reasoned that without additions, now called hidden variables, quantum mechanics would predict illogical relationships between the physically separated measurements.

In 1964, John Stewart Bell formulated Bell&#x27;s theorem, an inequality which, if violated in actual experiments, implies that quantum mechanics violates &quot;local causality&quot; (referred to as local realism in later work), a result now considered equivalent to precluding local hidden variables. Progressive variations on those Bell test experiments have since shown that quantum mechanics broadly violates Bell&#x27;s inequalities. According to some interpretations of quantum mechanics, this result implies that some quantum effects violate the principle of locality.

== Pre-quantum mechanics ==
During the 17th century, Newton&#x27;s principle of universal gravitation was formulated in terms of &quot;action at a distance&quot;, thereby violating the principle of locality. Newton himself considered this violation to be absurd:
Coulomb&#x27;s law of electric forces was initially also formulated as instantaneous action at a distance, but in 1880, James Clerk Maxwell showed that field equations – which obey locality – predict all of the phenomena of electromagnetism. These equations show that electromagnetic forces propagate at the speed of light.

In 1905, Albert Einstein&#x27;s special theory of relativity postulated that no matter or energy can travel faster than the speed of light, and Einstein thereby sought to reformulate physics in a way that obeyed the principle of locality. He later succeeded in producing an alternative theory of gravitation, general relativity, which obeys the principle of locality.

However, a different challenge to the principle of locality developed subsequently from the theory of quantum mechanics, which Einstein himself had helped to create.

== Models for locality ==

Simple spacetime diagrams can help clarify the issues related to locality. A way to describe the issues of locality suitable for discussion of quantum mechanics is illustrated in the diagram. A particle is created in one location, then split and measured in two other, spatially separated, locations. The two measurements are named for Alice and Bob. Alice performs measurements (A) and gets a result formula_7); Bob performs (formula_3) and gets result formula_9. The experiment is repeated many times and the results are compared.

=== Alice and Bob in spacetime ===

A spacetime diagram has a time coordinate going vertical and a space coordinate going horizontal. Alice, in a local region on the left, can affect events only in a cone extending in the future as shown; the finite speed of light prevent her from affecting other areas including Bob&#x27;s location in this case. Similarly we can use the diagram to reason that Bob&#x27;s local circumstances cannot be altered by Alice at the same time: all events that cause an effect on Bob are in the cone below his location on the diagram. Dashed lines around Alice show her valid future locations; dashed lines around Bob show events that could have caused his present circumstance. When Alice measures quantum states in her location she gets the results labeled formula_7; similarly Bob gets formula_9. Models of locality attempt to explain the statistical relationship between these measured values. 

=== Action at a distance ===

The simplest locality model is no locality: instantaneous action at a distance with no limits for relativity. The locality model for action at a distance is called &quot;continuous action&quot;. The gray area (a circle here) is a mathematical concept called a &quot;screen&quot;. Any path from a location through the screen becomes part of the physical model at that location. The gray ring indicates events from all parts of space and time can affect the probability measured by Alice or Bob. So in the case of continuous action, events at all times and places affect Alice&#x27;s and Bob&#x27;s model. This simple model is highly successful for solar planetary dynamics with Newtonian gravity and in electrostatics, cases where relativistic effects are insignificant.

=== No future-input dependence ===

Many locality models explicitly or implicitly ignore the possible effect of future events. The spacetime diagram at the right shows the effect of such a restriction when combined with continuous action. Inputs from the future (above the dashed line) are no longer considered part of Alice&#x27;s or Bob&#x27;s model. Comparing this diagram with the one for continuous action makes it clear that these are not the same locality model. Common sense arguments about the future not affecting the present are reasonable criteria but such assumptions alter the mathematical character of the models.

=== Bell&#x27;s local causality ===

John Stewart Bell when discussing his Bell&#x27;s theorem uses the screening model shown at the right. Events in the common past of Alice and Bob are part of the model used in calculating probabilities for Alice and for Bob as indicated the way the screen absorbs those events. However events at Bob&#x27;s location during Alice measurement and events in the future are excluded. Bell called this assumption local causality, but with the diagram we can reason about the meaning of the assumption without getting tripped up by other meanings of local combined with other meanings of causal. Dash lines show relativistically valid regions in the past of Alice or Bob. The gray arc is the assumed Bell &quot;screen&quot;.

== Quantum mechanics ==
The relative positions of our few, easily distinguishable planets (for example) can be seen directly: understanding and measuring their relative location poses only technical issues. The submicroscopic world on the other hand is known only by measurements that average over many seemingly random (&quot;statistical&quot; or &quot;probabilistic&quot;) events and measurements can show either particle-like or wave-like results depending on their design. This world is governed by quantum mechanics. The concepts of locality are more complex and they are described in the language of probability and correlation.

In the 1935 Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox paper (EPR paper), Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen imagined such an experiment. They observed that quantum mechanics predicts what is now known as quantum entanglement and examined its consequences. In their view, the classical principle of locality implied that &quot;no real change can take place&quot; at Bob&#x27;s site as a result of whatever measurements Alice was doing. Since quantum mechanics does predict a wavefunction collapse that depends on Alice&#x27;s choice of measurement, they concluded that this was a form of action-at-distance and that the wavefunction could not be a complete description of reality. Other physicists did not agree: they accepted the quantum wavefunction as complete and questioned the nature of locality and reality assumed in the EPR paper. 

In 1964 John Stewart Bell investigated whether it might be possible to fulfill Einstein&#x27;s goal—to &quot;complete&quot; quantum theory—with local hidden variables to explain the correlations between spatially separated particles as predicted by quantum theory. Bell established a criterion to distinguish between local hidden-variables theory and quantum theory by measuring specific values of correlations between entangled particles. Subsequent experimental tests have shown that some quantum effects do violate Bell&#x27;s inequalities and cannot be reproduced by a local hidden-variables theory. Bell&#x27;s theorem depends on careful defined models of locality.

===Locality and hidden variables===

Bell described local causality in terms of probability needed for analysis of quantum mechanics. Using the notation that formula_12 for the probability of a result formula_13 with given state formula_14, Bell investigated the probability distribution
formula_15
where formula_16 represents hidden state variables set (locally) when the two particles are initially co-located. If local causality holds, then the probabilities observed by Alice and by Bob should be only coupled by the hidden variables, and we can show that
formula_17 
Bell proved that a consequence of this factorization are limits on the correlations observed by Alice and Bob known as Bell inequalities. Since quantum mechanics predicts correlations stronger than this limit, locally set hidden variables cannot be added to &quot;complete&quot; quantum theory as desired by the EPR paper. 

Numerous experiments specifically designed to probe the issues of locality confirm the predictions of quantum mechanics; these include experiments where the two measurement locations are more than a kilometer apart. 
The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Alain Aspect, John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger, in part &quot;for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities&quot;. The specific aspect of quantum theory that leads to these correlations is termed quantum entanglement, and versions of Bell&#x27;s scenario are now used to verify entanglement experimentally.

==== Terminology ====

Bell&#x27;s mathematical results, when compared to experimental data, eliminate local hidden-variable mathematical quantum theories. But the interpretation of the math with respect to the physical world remains under debate. Bell described the assumptions behind his work as &quot;local causality&quot;, shortened to &quot;locality&quot;; later authors referred to the assumptions as local realism. These different names do not alter the mathematical assumptions. 

A review of papers using this phrase suggests that a common (classical) physics definition of realism is 
This definition includes classical concepts like &quot;well-defined&quot;, which conflicts with quantum superposition, and &quot;prior to ... measurements&quot;, which implies (metaphysical) preexistence of properties. Specifically, the term local realism in the context of Bell&#x27;s theorem cannot be viewed as a kind of &quot;realism&quot; involving locality other than the kind implied by the Bell screening assumption. This conflict between common ideas of realism and quantum mechanics requires careful analysis whenever local realism is discussed.
Adding a &quot;locality&quot; modifier, that the results of two spatially well-separated measurements cannot causally affect each other, does not make the combination relate to Bell&#x27;s proof; the only interpretation that Bell assumed was the one he called local causality. Consequently, Bell&#x27;s theorem does not restrict the possibility of nonlocal variables as well as theories based on retrocausality or superdeterminism.

Because of the probabilistic nature of wave function collapse, this apparent violation of locality in quantum mechanics cannot be used to transmit information faster than light, in accordance to the no communication theorem. Asher Peres distinguishes between &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong nonlocality&quot;, the latter referring to the theories that allow faster-than-light communication. Under these terms, quantum mechanics would allow weakly nonlocal correlations but not strong nonlocality.

== Relativistic quantum mechanics ==
One of the main principles of quantum field theory is the principle of locality. The field operators and the Lagrangian density describing the dynamics of the fields are local, in the sense that interactions are not described by action-at-a-distance. This condition can be achieved by avoiding terms in the Lagrangian that are products of two fields that depend on distant coordinates. Specifically, in relativistic quantum field theory, to enforce the principles of locality and causality the following condition is required: if there are two observables, each localized within two distinct spacetime regions which happen to be at a spacelike separation from each other, the observables must commute. This condition is sometimes imposed as one of the axioms of relativistic quantum field theory.

<text>The Pontiac G6 is a mid-size car that was produced by General Motors under the Pontiac brand. It was introduced in 2004 for the 2005 model year to replace the Grand Am. 

The G6 shared the GM Epsilon platform with the Chevrolet Malibu, Saab 9-3, and other General Motors vehicles. Features included a remote starting system (standard on GT, optional on base model), traction control/ABS, electronic stability control, automatic headlights, as well as a panoramic sunroof option. A retractable hardtop convertible was offered for model years 2006-2009. Production ended in 2010 with the discontinuation of the Pontiac line. The final Pontiac branded vehicle was a white G6.

With the G6, Pontiac introduced a two-digit naming convention, with the Pontiac G8 a class above the G6 and the Pontiac G5 a class below. In the case of the G6, the nameplate designated it as the sixth generation of its predecessor, the Pontiac Grand Am.

==Overview==
The Pontiac G6 was first introduced at the 2003 North American International Auto Show as a concept car. The concept used a supercharged V6 that made 285 horsepower and 272 lb ft of torque mated to a 4T65-E electronically controlled automatic transmission. When the G6 was introduced as a 2005 model year, it had two trim levels, base &quot;V6&quot; and sportier &quot;GT&quot;. Both trims, however, used a pushrod V6 producing and of torque. Matched to a four-speed automatic transmission, the GT featured TAPshift, where the driver could select the gears manually.

Base models were well equipped, featuring power locks, windows and mirrors with keyless entry, six-speaker CD stereo, power driver&#x27;s seat, air conditioning, and split folding rear seat. GTs added an eight-speaker Monsoon stereo, premium cloth seats with six-way adjustment, remote start, ABS, and traction control.

In 2006, the G6 added two new trim levels and two new bodystyles, a coupe, and a retractable hard top convertible. The new trim levels were a new base four-cylinder trim (sometimes referred to as &quot;SE&quot;), and the high performance &quot;GTP&quot;. Coupes and convertibles were available in GT and GTP trims only. The new base model used a 169-horsepower, DOHC inline-4, mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. The V6 was now part of a sport-package on the base/SE, and remained standard on the GT. The new GTP used a version of the GT&#x27;s V6, but also utilizes variable valve timing (VVT), increasing output to 240 horsepower. A four-speed automatic transmission was standard, but for no cost, a six-speed manual transmission was available. The GTP convertible was not available with the manual transmission and reduced its power to , due to a more restrictive exhaust system. The GTP also featured standard electronic stability control.

The 2007 G6 saw more engine changes, and standard side torso and side curtain airbags (actually introduced late in the 2006 model year) were new. The GT now featured VVT on its V6, raising power from to . The V6 became an option on the GT, producing 227 horsepower in automatic transmission form and 240 horsepower in manual transmission form. The GTP was given a new DOHC V6 with 24 valves and VVT, producing 252 horsepower at 6300 RPM. It is mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Midway through the model year, the six-speed manual was dropped with the , along with its 240-horsepower output. The GTP convertible was also discontinued. For 2008, the GTP became the GXP with more dramatic styling cues, and the engine became an exclusive convertible option, with horsepower down to 222. SAE ratings also dropped the horsepower ratings on the and models to and ( on convertibles), respectively.

For 2009, 2.4 L four-cylinder engines were added to the coupe lineup. An all new 6 speed automatic transmission, which debuted on the Chevrolet Malibu, became optional on 4 cylinder models. GM revised the G6 in the middle of 2009, creating a &quot;2009.5&quot; model year. Changes consisted of a revised front and rear fascia as well as a revision of the dashboard, most notably adding an updated radio with Bluetooth capability. Coupes and convertibles ceased production at the end of the 2009 model year, making examples with the 2009.5 changes fairly rare. Subsequent to this model&#x27;s introduction, General Motors entered bankruptcy, and announced that the G6 sedan would be discontinued in 2010. Most other Pontiac models had been discontinued, but the G6 was in high-demand for fleet vehicle orders, facilitating production to continue while the brand was wound down. In 2010, the G6 had white back-lit dashboard lights instead of the traditional red Pontiac color scheme.

GM began marketing the Buick brand in Mexico after the 2009 model year, to replace Pontiac. Accordingly, the Pontiac G6 was effectively replaced by the Buick Regal in Mexico. Ultimately, the G6 (as well as the Saturn Aura) were replaced by GM&#x27;s revived Buick Regal nameplate in the United States and Canada. 

==Convertible==
Introduced in 2006, the G6&#x27;s power-operated hydraulic retractable hardtop was engineered by the Pontiac, Michigan offices of Karmann Technical Development, L.L.C. It was manufactured as a roof module by Karmann and delivered in-sequence to General Motors’ Orion Assembly center. 

Originally, development of the roof system was to be a joint venture with Karmann and ASC Inc., with Karmann later assuming the complete project. Subsequently, during Karmann&#x27;s initial development, prototypes failed durability testing, delaying the convertible&#x27;s launch, and threatening to scuttle the program if GM could not amortize the convertible&#x27;s cost before the G6 was projected for redesign. The top needed to survive 16,000-20,000 cycles, but initially failed after fewer than 10,000. As well, prototypes had poor fit between the deck lid and rear fenders.

In production, the two-piece metal top featured insulation to provide internal sound and interior thermal levels commensurate with its coupe counterpart. Integrated into a structural member wrapping behind the rear seats, the top module was affixed to the car&#x27;s structure with six bolts. The final structure achieved a stiffness measure of 25 hertz, comparable to industry competitors. A four-bar linkage system provided the rigidity and lateral stability necessary to cantilever retractable top components in various parked conditions, i.e., when parked on uneven surfaces. Top operation used seven hydraulic cylinders that activated and latched/unlatched the folding top, powered by one hydraulic pump.

General Motors reported that in production form, each top module successfully tested for 12,000 cycles, about twice the cycles the typical convertible endures in its lifetime. The convertible was tested under a variety of weather conditions, from arid desert to arctic conditions, and was extensively water and environmental tested. In a 2006 road test, Autoweek noted considerable cowl shake, as well as squeak-and-rattle issues.

After the transmission&#x27;s Park function was engaged and the trunk&#x27;s cargo panel deployed, top retraction took 30 seconds, with the two-piece top stacking in the trunk and the trunk lid, doubling as a tonneau cover. Cargo area with the top up was 5.8 cubic feet, and with the top down, 1.8 cubic feet (4.5 cubic feet with spare tire removed). GM said the G6 convertible had 34&quot; of rear-seat legroom.

Ward&#x27;s Automotive reported in 2008, that Karmann provided a revised, more robust retractable top, improving the panel-to-panel latch on the 2-piece clamshell lid, to eliminate squeaks and rattles. With its quality issues, a late launch due to development problems, and slow sales, the G6 convertible was discontinued after model year 2009 and replaced by the Opel Cascada, marketed as a Buick in the U.S. in early 2016.

==Safety==
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Pontiac G6 an overall &quot;Good&quot; score in the frontal offset crash test, but an &quot;Acceptable&quot; score in the side impact crash test even though side airbags were introduced late in the 2006 model year. The lower side impact score was due in part to a marginal rating for the structure/safety cage category.

==2005 GXP concept==
The 2005 GXP concept was built by General Motors Performance Division. It includes a HO VVTI V6 engine rated at , F40 six-speed manual transmission, performance intake, GM Performance cat-back exhaust with bright tips, and 19-inch wheels with Bridgestone Potenza RE040 255 series tires. It was unveiled at the 2004 SEMA Show, and was later sold on the eBay Motors website. The auction ended on May 3, 2009 with winning bid price of .

==Marketing==
Complementing a US$110 million publicity campaign, in a launch publicity stunt, &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; gave 276 G6s to audience members at the fall 2004 season premiere.

On September 12, 2014, &quot;Autoblog&quot; followed up with the G6 winners on the tenth anniversary of the telecast. The winners interviewed learned that although they did &quot;get a car&quot; from Winfrey during the broadcast, in actuality they had to go to the Pontiac dealership in their area to pick up the G6 because the vehicles that were shown in the studio&#x27;s parking lot were used as a promotion. One couple had to sell their G6s because they learned of tax implications that came with owning the car. Another kept hers even though her two friends who came with her to the taping no longer have theirs (one was sold, another was totaled in an accident) and hopes to give the G6 to her daughter in time for college, saying &quot;I&#x27;m hoping to drive it until we can&#x27;t drive it any more.&quot;

==Motorsports==

The G6 was used in the GT class of Rolex Sports Car Series as a replacement for the Pontiac GTO.R after the GTO went out of production. The cars are referred to as &quot;GXP.R&quot;s and built by GM&#x27;s endorsed chassis constructor, Pratt &amp; Miller.

It is powered by the LS2 V8 engine that produces approximately . Weight saving features include carbon fiber body panels and shatter-resistant polycarbonate windows. The custom tube-frame chassis is not related to the road car&#x27;s chassis and the 6-speed gearbox delivers power to the rear wheels. The front and rear fenders flared to cover the wide, 18-inch wheels and class-spec Hoosier racing tires. A rear wing reminiscent of sports option package on the race car is fitted at the back, underneath the proper racing rear wing.

The G6 GXP also raced in the NHRA Powerade Drag Racing Series Pro Stock class for Warren Johnson Racing.

==Yearly United States sales==
==Recalls==

There have been four NHTSA formal recalls for the Pontiac G6.

The first recall (NHTSA Campaign 06V417000) was for Pontiac G6 cars with aftermarket seat upgrades. To expedite sales at some dealerships, GM authorized seats to be replaced with leather seats as a dealer-installed option. This change could cause the passenger air bag sensor to not detect an occupant. GM took the rare step of buying back any cars that had this dealer installed option.

The second recall (NHTSA Campaign 09V036000) affected 8,012 MY 2005-2006 G6 vehicles, and corrected a potential corrosion that affected brake light wiring, and could cause brake lights to not illuminate.

On September 21, 2012, General Motors recalled 473,841 vehicles involving the Chevy Malibu, Pontiac G6, and Saturn Aura from model years 2007 through 2010 equipped with four-speed automatic transmissions. The problem is a condition that could make cars roll when in park. The recall affects 426,240 in the United States, 40,029 in Canada, and 7,572 in other markets.

This recall is an expansion of a much smaller 2011 recall on certain 2009/2009.5 MY vehicles which experienced the same condition. GM expanded the recall in 2012 after finding the problem was not isolated to that model year.

In 2014, GM recalled the vehicle regarding a condition in which the transmission shift cable may fracture. The fracture prevents the driver from selecting gears and may cause the vehicle to move in an unintended direction.

<doc id="427130" wikidata="Q849074" url="?curid=427130" title="Nozomi (spacecraft)">
<text>was a Japanese Mars orbiter that failed to reach Mars due to electrical failure. It was constructed by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, University of Tokyo and launched on July 4, 1998, at 03:12 JST (July 3, 1998, at 18:12 UTC) with an on-orbit dry mass of 258 kg and 282 kg of propellant. The Nozomi mission was terminated on December 31, 2003.

&quot;Nozomi&quot; was designed to study the upper Martian atmosphere and its interaction with the solar wind and to develop technologies for use in future planetary missions. Specifically, instruments on the spacecraft were to measure the structure, composition and dynamics of the ionosphere, aeronomy effects of the solar wind, the escape of atmospheric constituents, the intrinsic magnetic field, the penetration of the solar-wind magnetic field, the structure of the magnetosphere, and dust in the upper atmosphere and in orbit around Mars. The mission would have also returned images of Mars&#x27; surface.

==Mission profile==
===Launch===
After launch on the third M-V launch vehicle, &quot;Nozomi&quot; was put into an elliptical geocentric parking orbit with a perigee of 340 km and an apogee of 400,000 km.

===Lunar swing-bys===
The spacecraft used a lunar swingby on September 24, 1998, and another on December 18, 1998, to increase the apogee of its orbit.

===Earth swing-by===
It flew by Earth on December 20, 1998, at a perigee of about 1000 km. The gravitational assist from the flyby coupled with a 7 minute burn of the bipropellant rocket put &quot;Nozomi&quot; into an escape trajectory towards Mars. It was scheduled to arrive at Mars on October 11, 1999, at 7:45:14 UT, but a malfunctioning valve during the Earth swingby resulted in a loss of fuel and left the spacecraft with insufficient acceleration to reach its planned trajectory. Two course correction burns on December 21 used more propellant than planned, leaving the spacecraft short of fuel.

===New mission plan===
The new plan was for &quot;Nozomi&quot; to remain in heliocentric orbit for an additional four years, including two Earth flybys in December 2002 and June 2003, and encounter Mars at a slower relative velocity in December 2003, or January 1, 2004.

===First Earth flyby===
On April 21, 2002, as &quot;Nozomi&quot; was approaching Earth for the gravity assist maneuver, powerful solar flares damaged the spacecraft&#x27;s onboard communications and power systems. An electrical short occurred in a power cell used to control the attitude control heating system, allowing the hydrazine fuel to freeze. The fuel thawed out as the craft approached Earth and maneuvers to put the craft on the correct trajectory for its Earth flyby were successful.

===Second Earth flyby===
Another Earth flyby within 11,000 km occurred on June 19, 2003. The fuel had completely thawed out for this maneuver because of the spacecraft&#x27;s proximity to the Sun. However, on December 9, 2003, efforts to orient the craft to prepare it for a December 14, 2003, main thruster orbital insertion burn failed, and efforts to save the mission were abandoned. The small thrusters were fired on December 9, moving the closest approach distance to 1,000 km so that the probe would not inadvertently impact on Mars and possibly contaminate the planet with Earth bacteria, since the orbiter had not been intended to land and was therefore not properly sterilized.

===Mars flyby===
The spacecraft flew by Mars on December 14, 2003, and went into a roughly 2-year heliocentric orbit.

===Intended Mars mission===
&quot;Nozomi&quot; was to be inserted into a highly eccentric Mars orbit with a periareion 300 km above the surface, an apoareion of 15 Mars radii, and an inclination of 170 degrees with respect to the ecliptic plane. Shortly after insertion, the mast and antennas were to be deployed. The periareion would have been lowered to 150 km, the orbital period to about 38.5 hours. The spacecraft was to be spin stabilized at 7.5 rpm with its spin axis (and the dish antenna) pointed towards Earth. The periapsis portion of the orbit would have allowed in-situ measurements of the thermosphere and lower exosphere and remote sensing of the lower atmosphere and surface. The more distant parts of the orbit would be for study of the ions and neutral gas escaping from Mars and their interactions with the solar wind. The nominal mission was planned for one Martian year (approximately two Earth years). An extended mission might have allowed operation of the mission for three to five years. The spacecraft was also to point its cameras at the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos.

==Spacecraft and subsystems==
The &quot;Nozomi&quot; orbiter was a 0.58 meter high, 1.6 meter square prism with truncated corners. Extending out from two opposite sides were solar panel wings containing silicon solar cells which provide power to the spacecraft directly or via NiMH (nickel metal hydride) batteries. On the top surface was a dish antenna, and a propulsion unit protrudes from the bottom. A 5 m deployable mast and a 1 m boom extended from the sides, along with two pairs of thin wire antennas which measure 50 m tip to tip. Other instruments were also arranged along the sides of the spacecraft. Spacecraft communications were via X-band at 8410.93 MHz and S-band at 2293.89 MHz. 

The 14 instruments carried on &quot;Nozomi&quot; were an imaging camera, neutral mass spectrometer, dust counter, thermal plasma analyzer, magnetometer, electron and ion spectrum analyzers, ion mass spectrograph, high energy particles experiment, VUV imaging spectrometer, sounder and plasma wave detector, LF wave analyzer, electron temperature probe, and a UV scanner. The total mass budgeted for the science instruments was 33 kg. Radio science experiments were also possible using the existing radio equipment and an ultrastable oscillator. 

The total mass of &quot;Nozomi&quot; at launch, including 282 kg of propellant, was 540 kg.

Canada provided a $5 million thermal plasma analyzer. This was the Canadian Space Agency&#x27;s first participation in an interplanetary mission. (Previously, the National Research Council of Canada provided the High Flux Telescope (HFT) for the &quot;Ulysses&quot; interplanetary mission.)

== Scientific instruments ==
The spacecraft carried 14 scientific instruments to conduct scientific observations of Mars. They were

* Mars Imaging Camera
* Magnetic Field Measurement (MGF)
* Probe for Electron Temperature (PET)
* Electron Spectrum Analyzer (ESA)
* Ion Spectrum Analyzer (ISA)
* Electron and Ion Spectrometer (EIS)
* Extra Ultraviolet Scanner (XUV)

* Plasma Wave and Sounder (PWS)
* Low Frequency Plasma Wave Analyzer (LFA)
* Ion Mass Imager (IMI)
* Mars Dust Counter (MDC)
* Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS)
* Thermal Plasma Analyzer (TPA)
== Scientific results ==
Nozomi transmitted useful data on measurement of Lyman-alpha light during the course of conducting various scientific observations in interplanetary space.

<doc id="427131" wikidata="Q1629256" url="?curid=427131" title="Pistol Opera">
<text>is a 2001 Japanese film directed by Seijun Suzuki and starring Makiko Esumi.

==Storyline==

The film&#x27;s main character, Miyuki Minazuki, ranked number three in The Assassins Guild, is known as the &quot;Stray Cat&quot;. A stoic and deadly woman, she is forced to deal with the crumbling Guild, and crazy state of affairs, seeking out the cause of all this, &quot;Hundred Eyes&quot;. She lives in a Japanese home with her grandmother, and her weapon is a pistol.

Former number one, now crippled and retired to an honorary ranking of number zero &quot;The Champ&quot; Goro Hanada is an acquaintance of Stray Cat&#x27;s, offering news and unsolicited advice. Stray Cat regards The Champ as a pitiful shadow of a man, and teases him about his failures. For the most part the other members of the guild also treat him as such. The Champ himself remains deluded about his usefulness, and ignores others opinions.

Stray Cat receives her assignments from the assassins guild from an enigmatic woman in a white dress named Sayoko Uekyo. As the movie opens they are in the midst of a conversation where Uekyo asks her if she has a man, suggesting some lesbian undertones. The relationship between Stray Cat and Uekyo is open to interpretation, at times the two are friendly, and other times they share mutual disregard.

Uekyo gives Stray Cat the news that the number one ranked killer, the mysterious &quot;Hundred Eyes&quot; is now a target, and Stray Cat is offered the job.

Through the course of film Stray Cat finds herself entangled with many characters, particularly a young girl named Sayoko who wishes to become an assassin herself.

==Rival assassins==
The Teacher - A wheelchair-using, tracksuit-wearing killer who failed at assassinating a well known-target, due to Stray Cat&#x27;s involvement.

Painless Surgeon rank #5 - A bearded possibly middle-aged foreigner with a liking for Japanese women and Japanese theatre, who feels no pain. In the style of a true surgeon, he favors knives and blades over firearms. Painless Surgeon claims to be in league with Hundred Eyes, but that is never cleared up.

Dark Horse - A man in a blond wig and black cloak, who claims to be Hundred Eyes. As an assassin, he favors killing people by shooting them in the back of the medulla oblongata, therefore affecting the dying victim&#x27;s brain nerves, causing them to be dead with the facial expression of a smile. He uses a firearm, with laser scope.

Hundred Eyes rank #1 - A mysterious assassin, no one really knows who he or she is until the climax of the film.

<doc id="427137" wikidata="Q2622787" url="?curid=427137" title="Faerûn">
<text>Faerûn ( ) is a fictional continent and the primary setting of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; world of &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;. It is described in detail in several editions of the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting&quot; (first published in 1987 by TSR, Inc.) with the most recent being the 5th edition from Wizards of the Coast, and various locales and aspects are described in more depth in separate campaign setting books. Around a hundred novels, several computer and video games and a film use Faerûn as the setting.

== Fictional culture and technology ==
Economically and technologically, Faerûn is comparable to Western Europe during the late Middle Ages, giving most new players using this campaign setting an intuitive grasp of the way the society functions. Gunpowder, known here as the magical substance &quot;smoke powder&quot; and different in its composition from historical gunpowder, is starting to make an appearance, but much of the armament is still dominated by pre-gunpowder weaponry such as swords, spears, and bows. Most of the population of Faerûn consists of farmers, who are organized somewhat loosely in a semi-feudal system. There are also several notable cities and trade between nations is common, as in the Renaissance era. Likewise, there are regions where more barbaric tribes and customs persist. Home to many different cultures, &quot;[i]t is an eclectic land, rich in history, that has witnessed the rise and fall of kingdoms, forever bearing the scars of centuries of war.&quot;

A major difference between the setting and Earth is the presence of magic. The system of magic is subdivided into divine and arcane categories, with the former empowered by a Faerûnian deity, and the latter by rituals or innate abilities which manipulate a mystical field called the Weave, the source of magical energies on Toril. Faerûn has a pantheon of deities that are worshipped by the followers of this region. These are comparable to mythological deities of the ancient Greek pantheon and cover a range of ethical beliefs and portfolios of interests.

Faerûn is home to many non-human creatures of varying degrees of civilization or barbarism. Among these are several different races of dwarves, gnomes, halflings and elves, as well as goblins, orcs, lizardmen, ogres, various giants, and even dragons.

There are several organized alliances in Faerûn, with each pursuing their particular agenda. A few are dedicated to decent and honest causes, such as the Harpers, who protect the good-natured races and seek a balance between civilization and nature. The Harpers are opposed by evil organizations, including the Red Wizards of Thay and the nihilistic Cult of the Dragon. In the northern lands, the Zhentarim is an evil network seeking to dominate the region. Their efforts are being resisted by the Lords&#x27; Alliance, a council of knights that pursues the interests of the northern cities. Other organizations of Faerûn include the magical Seven Sisters, a band of assassins called the Fire Knives, a group of ruthless thieves operating out the city of Waterdeep named Xanathar&#x27;s Guild, and the mysterious Shadesthe returning survivors of the long-fallen Netheril empire.

===Religion===
Faerûn is home to a large and diverse pantheon of deities, including:
*Greater deities: Lord Ao, Akadi, Asmodeus, Bane, Chauntea, Grumbar, Istishia, Kelemvor, Kossuth, Lathander, Lolth, Mystra, Oghma, Shar, Silvanus, Sune, Talos, Tempus, Torm, Tyr, Ubtao
*Intermediate deities: Auril, Bahamut, Beshaba, Gond, Helm, Ilmater, Loviatar, Mask, Mielikki, Tiamat, Tymora, Umberlee, Waukeen

*Dead deities: Amaunator, Auppenser, Bhaal, Earthmother, Eshowdow, Ibrandul, Jazirian, Kalzareinad, Karsus, Kiputytto, Kukul, Leira, Moander, Murdane, Myrkul, Mystryl, Othea, Ra

===Organizations===
Numerous organizations of different types operate throughout Faerûn, including the Companions of the Hall, Cowled Wizards, Cult of the Dragon, Drow houses (like Baenre and Do&#x27;Urden), Elk Tribe, Flaming Fist, The Four (Mirt the Moneylender, Durnan, Asper and Randal Morn), Harpers, Iron Throne, The Kraken, Moonstars, Red Wizards of Thay, Seven Sisters, Shadow Thieves, and Zhentarim.

Vartha Do&#x27;Urden was the previous matron mother of House Do&#x27;Urden whose unexpected death allowed her daughter Malice to take control of the house.

==Fictional geography==

The sub-continent of Faerûn is set in the northern hemisphere of the planet Toril, or, more formally, &quot;Abeir-Toril&quot;. The continent has a &quot;landmass of approximately nine and a half million square miles&quot;. Faerûn is the western part of an unnamed supercontinent that is quite similar to real-world Afro-Eurasia. Within the setting, &quot;sub-arctic extremes chill its northern reaches, where ice sheets like the Great Glacier dominate the landscape in blinding white. To the south are the equatorial jungles of Chult and the tropical coasts of Halruaa. It&#x27;s bordered on the west by the Trackless Sea and on the east by the Endless Wastes and the Hordelands that separate it from Kara-Tur&quot;. Kara-Tur, which was the original setting of the D&amp;D Oriental Adventures campaign setting, and Zakhara, home to the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; setting Al-Qadim, are also on this continent. Maztica, home of a tribal, Aztec-like civilization is far to the west, across an Atlantic-like ocean called the Trackless Sea. The subterranean regions underneath Faerûn are called the Underdark.

Faerûn includes terrain that is as varied as that of Europe, western Asia, and much of Africa is on our planet Earth. Role-playing campaigns in Faerûn can be set in a wide variety of locations, each with its own hazards and potential rewards for the participants. Likewise, the region that the players explore can determine what types of monsters they will face, which famous individuals they will encounter, and what types of missions they assume.

Besides the exterior coastline to the west and south, the most dominant feature on the continent is the Sea of Fallen Stars. This is an irregular inland sea that keeps the neighboring lands fertile and serves as a major trade route for the bordering nations. Next in significance is the Shaar, a broad region of grasslands in the south that, together with a large body of water called the Lake of Steam, separates the area around the inland sea from the coastal nations at the southern edge of the continent. To the east, Faerûn is bordered by a vast region of steppe that separates it from Kara-Tur. In the north are massive glaciers, named Pelvuria and Reghed, and a region of tundra. South of the continent, separated by the Great Sea, is a sub-tropical land called Zakhara.

===Northern regions===
To the northwest, Faerûn is a region of wilderness, difficult winter weather, hordes of orcs, and barbarous human tribes. This region is generally referred to as &quot;The North&quot;. It is a mostly-untamed region that lies between the large Anauroch desert in the east and the expansive Sea of Swords to the west with a mountain range at the far north called the Spine of the World. This area contains huge wooded regions such as the High Forest and the Lurkwood, the frozen Icewind Dale to the north, and an untamed region called the Savage Frontier, which includes the Silver Marches (Luruar). The coastal region is called the Sword Coast, &quot;a haven for adventurers&quot;. Here lie the &quot;iconic locastions&quot; of the city-state of Neverwinter and the large port city of Waterdeep. Undermountain is a vast dungeon crawl under the area of Waterdeep, rated among the &quot;deadliest&quot; and most iconic in the game. The Ten Towns are located within Icewind Dale with the Sea of Moving Ice at the northernmost place in known Faerûn. In the module &quot;Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden&quot;, the titular Frostmaiden Auril makes her home on an island in this sea.

Deep inland are the ancient dwarven citadels of Mithral Hall, Citadel Felbarr and the largest of the three, Citadel Adbar, which was featured in the &quot;Legacy of the Drow&quot; series of novels. This area is one of the most popular regions for role-playing campaigns set in Faerûn, and has been the setting for a number of popular role-playing video games. Another city is Mirabar, the mining center for the Sword Coast.

North of the Sea of Fallen Stars is a region that stretches from the wide Anauroch desert in the west to the eastern edge of the inland Moonsea, in the northern region of the continent. It is a region of contrasts, with the forested Dalelands, the desert wastes of Anauroch, the coastline of the Moonsea with the infamous Zhentil Keep, and the bitterly cold steppes of The Ride. Along the east coast of the Dragon Reach (a northern branch of the Sea of Fallen Stars) is a temperate region called The Vast, consisting of farmlands, forests and the Earthsea mountains. This area includes the city of Ravens Bluff, which for many years was home to the RPGA&#x27;s Living City role-playing campaign and the site of the Living City series of game modules. The Dragonspine Mountains, which house the infamous Citadel of the Raven on their western slopes, is a mountain range northwest of the Moonsea.

Northeastern Faerûn is a remote area that begins in the cold, forbidding lands along the great ice sheets and continues south toward the northeastern shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars. It is bordered on the west by the mountain-hemmed land of Vaasa and stretches east to the vast steppes of the Hordelands, with its largest city of Winterkeep. This region also contains the lightly populated kingdom of Damara, the druidic forests of the Great Dale, the coastal kingdom of Impiltur, the fallen and once evil empire of Narfell, and the trading nation of Thesk. Mystical Rashemen is a land ruled from behind the scenes by spiritual witches, and it is the location of the &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask of the Betrayer&quot; computer game. The lands of Damara and Vaasa were described in a 1989 publication, &quot;FR9, The Bloodstone Lands&quot;. This area formed the setting for the &quot;H Series&quot; of modules that used the Battlesystem rules to resolve battles.

Secomber is a small town of nearly 1,500 that acts as a de facto border town between the relatively peaceful Western Heartlands and the more savage North along the Sword Coast. The village of Daggerford lies along the Shining River along the Sword Coast. The sunken city of Northkeep was the first city built around the Moonsea by humans.

Miyeritar and Ilythiir were ancient elven empires.

===Middle lands===
The western part of Faerûn includes the nations south of Waterdeep and north of the &quot;Shining Sea&quot;, that border along the Sea of Swords. The west includes the city of Baldur&#x27;s Gate (named for the great seafaring hero Balduran) the library-fortress of Candlekeep, both considered among &quot;D&amp;D&#x27;s most iconic locations&quot;, the nations of Amn, Tethyr, Calimshan, the region of Western Heartlands and the elven stronghold of Evereska. These regions were the setting for the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; series of computer games. To the west in the vast ocean called the Trackless Sea is a multitude of islands, collectively named the Nelanther Isles. Other island kingdoms include the gnomish realm of Lantan, the country of Nimbral and, further west, the Moonshae Isles.
With the exception of the Shining Plains, the interior lands of Faerûn lie along the irregular coastline of the western Sea of Fallen Stars. In the north the Dragonmere arm of the sea extends far to the west, ending close to the Western Heartlands. To the south, the Vilhon Reach forms a second arm leading to the southwest. The notable areas within this region include Chondath, Cormyr, the Dragon Coast, Hlondeth, the Pirate Isles and Prespur, Sembia (and its largest city of Selgaunt), Sespech, Turmish, and the Shining Plains.

Along the eastern expanses of the Sea of Fallen Stars, the water forms a long arm that travels to the east before turning south to become the Alamber Sea. The northern nations of this mysterious area are termed the &quot;Unapproachable East&quot; and the southern nations the &quot;Old Empires&quot; in campaign setting publications. This region includes the nations of Aglarond, Ashanath, Altumbel, Mulhorand, Murghôm, Thay and Unther. Chondalwood is a long, forested region to the south of Chondath and Chessenta. Thay is a magocracy ruled by the Red Wizards which was described in the 1988 publication &quot;FR6: Dreams of the Red Wizards&quot;. The nation has made multiple attempts to invade neighboring countries and following a civil war, the lich Szass Tam became Thay&#x27;s leader. Shannon Appelcline, author of &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, highlighted that &quot;Thay doesn&#x27;t have an obvious real-world derivation like some of the Realms. The wizards rebelled from the Egyptian-based Mulhorand, while their occupied land is somewhat reminiscent of India. However the best parallel to Thay may actually be Stygia, an evil land from Robert E. Howard&#x27;s Conan stories&quot;.

Tharsult is an island of unscrupulous traders in the Shining Sea.

===Southern nations===
To the southwest lies along the great Chultan peninsula that juts out toward the west. The waters to the north are named the Shining Sea, a body bounded by Calimsham to the north and joined to the Lake of Steam through the Straits of Storm. To the south of the land is the Great Sea. Located in this area are Chult, Lapaliiya, Samarach, Tashalar, and Thindol.

South of the Sea of Fallen Stars is a region somewhat isolated by the Lake of Steam in the west, and the vast length of the Shaar. It is bordered along the south by the Great Sea; to the west by the Chultan peninsula region, and in the east by Luiren. The south includes the Border Kingdoms, Dambrath, the Great Rift, Halruaa, the Lake of Steam, and The Shaar.

South and east of the grassy plains is an area known as the Shaar, along the shores of the Great Sea opposite the land of Zakhara. The region includes the lands of Durpar, Estagund and Var the Golden (collectively called the &quot;Shining Lands&quot;), Luiren, the land of Halflings, Ulgarth, the easternmost extent of Faerûn, and Veldorn, the land of monsters, as well as The Great Rift, a large, powerful nation of dwarves, within a titanic canyon

===Underdark===

The immense complex of caverns and passages that lie beneath many parts of the continent of Faerûn is known as the Underdark. It contains cities of the elf-related drow including the infamous Menzoberranzan and the ruins of Ched Nasad, as well as Maerdrimydra, Llurth Dreir and Sshamath; cities of duergar such as Gracklstugh and Dunnspeirrin; and almost unpronounceable cities of creatures called the kuo-toa, illithids, and beholders.

==Changes in geography==
===Third Edition===
When the third edition of the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting&quot; was released in 2001, the designers took the opportunity to redesign the continent of Faerûn. Its size was reduced slightly to remove &#x27;empty space&#x27; from the map and the Chultan Peninsula was moved several hundred miles north, reducing the size of the empty grassplain known as the Shaar. Additionally, the designers slightly adjusted the projection of the map to better reflect the curvature of the planet. There was no in-universe explanation given for these changes as it was classified as a retcon.

===Fourth Edition===
The fourth edition of the &quot;Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting&quot;, released in 2008, saw major changes to the geography of Faerûn and the world of Abeir-Toril. Due to a magical cataclysm known as the Spellplague, the southern parts of Faerûn were devastated. Chult became an island detached from the mainland, the kingdom of Halruaa was utterly destroyed, and parts of the Sea of Fallen Stars drained into the Underdark. The northern Realms were less affected by the Spellplague, but during the 100-year gap between the third and fourth editions of the setting, it was revealed that the Netherese wizards of the city of Shade had eliminated the desert of Anauroch, returning the land to its pre-Fall state. The borders of some of the kingdoms were changed to reflect this. In addition to these changes, floating islands of earth known as &#x27;earthmotes&#x27; appeared in the skies above Faerûn and the continent of Maztica across the western ocean vanished along with the Faerûnian colonies on its east coast.

==In other media==
* In 2013, a mod for the video game &quot;Civilization V&quot; by Sid Meier was set in Faerûn. Reviewer Christopher Livingston praised the adaptation as &quot;a really neat mod. The modder, framedarchitecture, clearly knows his Forgotten Realms lore and history&quot;. 25 civilizations based on Faerûn&#x27;s creatures and nations, individual characters, locations, and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;&#x27; schools of magic were integrated, providing high recognition value.
* The &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; video game series take place in Faerûn.
* The 2023 film &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves&quot; is set in Faerûn.
* &quot;The Adventure Zone: Balance&quot;, including its graphic novel series, are set in Faerûn.

<text>The mosque swallow (Cecropis senegalensis) is a large species of swallow. It is a resident breeder in much of sub-Saharan Africa, although most common in the west. It does not migrate but follows the rains to some extent.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the mosque swallow in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Senegal. He used the French name &quot;L&#x27;hirondelle du Sénégal&quot; and the Latin &quot;Hirundo Senegalensis&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the mosque swallow. Linnaeus included a brief description and used Brisson&#x27;s Latin name for his binomial name &quot;Hirundo senegalensis&quot;.

Formerly placed in the genus &quot;Hirundo&quot; the mosque swallow and its relatives have been shown by molecular studies to be a separate clade and are now placed in the genus &quot;Cecropis&quot;, which was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826.

There are three recognised subspecies:
* &quot;C.s. senegalensis&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – south Mauritania, Senegal and Gambia east to southwest Sudan 
* &quot;C. s. saturatior&quot; (Bannerman, 1923) – west Africa from south Ghana east to Ethiopia and north Kenya 
* &quot;C. s. monteiri&quot; (Hartlaub, 1862) – Angola and south Democratic Republic of the Congo to south Kenya and south to northeast South Africa

==Description==

The mosque swallow is the largest and heaviest species of African swallow, resembling a big red-rumped swallow &quot;Cecropis daurica&quot;. The crown, upperparts, and tail are glossy dark blue, and the lores and sides of the head are whitish forming a collar. The rump is dark rufous, while the throat and upper breast are pale rufous, shading to dark rufous on the remainder of the underparts. Very pale underwing coverts contrast with the dark flight feathers. Females are similar to males but have shorter tail streamers. Juveniles are browner. Mosque swallows are in length.

==Distribution and habitat==
The mosque swallow is found from southern Mauritania and Senegal east to western South Sudan then south to Namibia, northern Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and north-eastern South Africa.

In southern Africa the mosque swallow is a woodland bird, preferring dense broad-leaved woodland with mopane (&quot;Colosphermum mopane&quot;) but also miombo (&quot;Brachystegia spp&quot;), with scattered baobabs (&quot;Adansonia digitata&quot;) and leadwoods (&quot;Combretum imberbe&quot;). In West Africa it prefers open habitats such as forest clearings and savanna, and also around villages and towns.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The mosque swallow feeds on flying insects such as ants, termite alates and flies, normally foraging above the ground. It is attracted to termite emergence events and bushfires when it can gather in flocks of up to 30 birds, It has a slow rather falcon-like flight with a lot of gliding and often forages high above the woodland canopy in association with other hirundines and swifts.

The mosque swallow nests either solitarily or in small groups. The nest is made of mud pellets and lined with grass and feathers. Its shape is that of a gourd and it has a long entrance tunnel attached to the side. The nest is often situated in a tree cavity, very often in a baobab, but also in or under tree branches, in buildings or road culverts. They breed all year round, with a peak of breeding activity in August–April. The clutch is 2-4 eggs.

<text>Mount Diablo is a mountain of the Diablo Range, in Contra Costa County of the eastern San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California. It is south of Clayton and northeast of Danville. It is an isolated upthrust peak of , visible from most of the San Francisco Bay Area. Mount Diablo appears from many angles to be a double pyramid and has many subsidiary peaks. The largest and closest is North Peak, the other half of the double pyramid, which is nearly as high in elevation at , and is about northeast of the main summit.

The mountain is within the boundaries of Mount Diablo State Park, which is administered by California State Parks.

==Geography==

The summit is accessible by foot, bicycle, or motor vehicle. Road access is via North Gate Road or South Gate Road.

=== Mount Diablo State Park ===

The peak is in Mount Diablo State Park, a state park of about . The state park was the first public open space established on or near the peak. According to the non-profit Save Mount Diablo, there are now varied types of protected lands on and around Mount Diablo that total more than . These include 38 preserves, such as nearby city open spaces, regional parks, and watersheds, which are buffered in some areas with private lands that have been protected by conservation easements.

===Viewshed===

On a clear day, the Sierra Nevada range is plainly visible from the summit. The best views are after a winter storm; a snowy Sierra shows up better, and summer days are likely to be hazy. Lassen Peak, away, is occasionally just visible over the curve of the earth. Sentinel Dome in Yosemite National Park is visible, but Half Dome is hidden by the 8000-foot ridge at 37.755N 119.6657W. Eight bridges are visible, from left to right (southwest to northeast): San Mateo, Bay, Golden Gate, San Rafael, Carquinez, Benicia, Antioch, and Rio Vista.

Countless peaks in the state are taller, but Mount Diablo has a remarkable visual prominence for a mountain of such low elevation. Its looming presence over much of the Bay Area, delta, and Central Valley, and good visibility even from the Mother Lode, all key regions during the gold rush and early statehood, made it an important landmark for mapping and navigation. The summit is used as the reference datum for land surveying in much of northern California and Nevada.

Claims that the mountain&#x27;s viewshed is the largest in the worldor second largest after Mount Kilimanjaroare ill-founded. It does boast one of the largest viewsheds in the Western United States and played a key role in California history.

==Cultural history==

Mount Diablo is sacred to many California Native American peoples. According to Miwok mythology and Ohlone mythology, it was the point of creation. The local peoples of the area traditionally had a variety of creation narratives associated with the mountain. In one surviving narrative fragment, Mount Diablo and Reed&#x27;s Peak (Mount Tamalpais) were surrounded by water; from these two islands the creator Coyote and his assistant Eagle-man made Native American people and the world. In another, Molok the Condor brought forth his grandson Wek-Wek the Falcon Hero, from within the mountain.

===Earliest names===
About 25 independent tribal groups with well-defined territories lived in the East Bay countryside surrounding the mountain at time of European contact. Their members spoke dialects of three distinct languages: Ohlone, Bay Miwok, and Northern Valley Yokuts. The Chochenyo-speaking Ohlone from Mission San Jose and the East Bay area, call the mountain , meaning &quot;at the dawn of time&quot;. Further inland, the Nisenan of the Sacramento Valley call it , &quot;dog mountain&quot;; because, as Nisenan elder Dalbert Castro once explained, it&#x27;s &quot;the place where dogs came from in trade&quot;. A Southern Sierra Miwok name for the mountain is , and a Northern Sierra Miwok name is .

It has also been suggested that another early Native American name for the mountain was or , but there is no evidence to confirm the assertion. According to Indian historian Bev Ortiz and Save Mount Diablo: &quot;The name was made up in 1866 — with no real Native American connection — referred to the California Legislature&#x27;s Committee on Public Morals, and tabled. It resurfaced as a real estate gimmick in 1916 with a supposed new translation, &quot;Laughing Mountain&quot;, attributed without documentation to Diablo area Volvon Indians.

Most of Mount Diablo, including its peak, was within the homeland of the early Volvon (sometimes spelled Wolwon, Bolbon or Bolgon), a Bay Miwok–speaking tribe. As early as 1811, Spanish colonists referred to the mountain as (&quot;High Hill of the Volvon&quot;) or sometimes .

===Current name===

The conventional view is that the peak derives its name from the reaction of Spanish soldiers to the 1805 escape of several Chupcan Native Americans in a willow thicket some 7 miles north of the mountain. One story tells that their nighttime escape through the thicket was aided by mysterious lights. An 1850 report by General Mariano G. Vallejo tells of a strange dancing spirit turning the battle in favor of the Chupcan. Vallejo interpreted the natives&#x27; word for the personage, , to mean &quot;devil&quot; in the Anglo-American language. Vallejo&#x27;s report could be interpreted to align with Edward G. Gudde&#x27;s history of place names. (Kyle, and Ortiz)

By 1824, the region north of the mountain came to be known as &quot;Monte del Diablo&quot; (&quot;devil&#x27;s thicket&quot;; in this case &quot;monte&quot; should be translated as thicket or dense woods). It was shown on maps near present-day Concord (formerly known as Pacheco). Later, U.S. settlers understood &quot;Monte&quot; to refer directly to the mountain, and it was recorded with varying degrees of certainty until &quot;Mount Diablo&quot; became official in 1850.

In May 1862, California Geological Survey field director William H. Brewer named the northeast peak of Mount Diablo &quot;Mount King&quot;, after Rev. Thomas Starr King, a Unitarian clergyman, abolitionist, Republican, Yosemite advocate, cultural Unionist, and California&#x27;s leading intellectual. Today it is known simply as North Peak.

===Mount Diablo ===
In 2005 Arthur Mijares, from the neighboring town of Oakley, petitioned the federal government to change the name of the mountain, claiming it offended his Christian beliefs. Additionally, he claimed that Diablo is a living person, and so is banned under federal law. He suggested renaming the mountain Mount Kawukum, and later, Mount Yahweh. Suggestions by other individuals included Mount Miwok and Mount Ohlone, after local Indian tribes. Finally Mijares proposed Mount Reagan, but the board rejected it on the grounds that a person must be deceased for five years to have a geographic landmark named after them. Eventually, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names rejected the petitions, saying there was no compelling reason to change the name.

In 2009 Mijares again proposed the name Mount Reagan to the United States Board of Geographic Names because the late president was by then eligible. The board gave the Contra Costa County Supervisor&#x27;s Committee until March 31 to file an opinion. Individual members of the committee have responded that although they respect Reagan, Mount Reagan is not an appropriate name for the historic mountain. Later, the board unanimously voted against renaming the mountain, citing its historical significance.

===Early uses===

In 1851 the south peak of the mountain was selected by Colonel Leander Ransom as the initial point—where the Mount Diablo Base and Mount Diablo Meridian lines intersect—for cadastral surveys of a large area. Subsequent surveys in much of California, Nevada and Oregon were located with reference to this point.

Toll roads up the mountain were created in 1874 by Joseph Seavey Hall and William Camron (sometimes &quot;Cameron&quot;); Hall&#x27;s Mount Diablo Summit Road was officially opened on May 2, 1874. Camron&#x27;s &quot;Green Valley&quot; road opened later. Hall also built the 16-room Mountain House Hotel near the junction of the two roads, a mile below the summit (2,500 foot elevation. (It operated through the 1880s, was abandoned in 1895, and burned c. 1901). As far north as Meridian Road, on the outskirts of Chico, California, the summit was used as a reference point. The road is colinear with the summit, and is named for the meridian which intersects it.

An aerial navigation beacon, the Standard Diablo tower, was erected by Standard Oil at the summit in 1928. The 10-million-candlepower beacon became known as the &quot;Eye of Diablo&quot; and was visible for a hundred miles.

===Protection of the area===

After initial legislation in 1921, the state of California acquired enough land in 1931 to create a small state park around the peak. Many improvements were carried out in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps, but park expansion slowed in the 1940s through the 1960s.

Significantly, botanist Mary Leolin Bowerman (1908–2005), founder of the Save Mount Diablo non-profit in 1971, published her Ph.D. dissertation in 1936 at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1944 she published her book, &quot;The Flowering Plants and Ferns of Mount Diablo, California&quot;. Her study boundaries became the basis for the state park&#x27;s first map and for the park&#x27;s eventual expansion. Her work also became the origin of many of the park&#x27;s place names.

Mount Diablo was used for broadcasting purposes in the 1950s by radio station KSBR-FM and television station KOVR (channel 13). The Mount Diablo site gave KOVR, which was based in Stockton, regional coverage that also included San Francisco and Sacramento. However, it also forced the station to pay San Francisco rates for movies and impeded any attempt at obtaining network affiliation. In 1957, the station relocated to Butte Mountain in Jackson in order to become an ABC affiliate and remove its signal from the Bay Area.

This state park has been greatly expanded over the decades. Soon after Earth Day in 1971, the nonprofit organization &quot;Save Mount Diablo&quot; was created by co-founders Mary Bowerman and Art Bonwell, barely ahead of real estate developers. At the time, the state park included just and was the only park in the vicinity of the mountain. In 2007 the state park totaled almost , and with 38 parks and preserves on and around the mountain, Diablo&#x27;s public lands total more than . According to Save Mount Diablo, there are 50 individual preserves on and around Mount Diablo, some of which are conservation easements covering a single parcel, others are expected to eventually be absorbed into larger nearby parks. As of December 2007, the organization recognizes 38 specific Diablo parks and preserves.

The State Park adjoins park lands of the East Bay Regional Park District, including Morgan Territory Regional Preserve, Brushy Peak Regional Preserve, Vasco Caves Regional Preserve, and Round Valley Regional Preserve. It also adjoins protected areas owned or controlled by local cities such as the Borges Ranch Historic Farm, the Concord Naval Weapons Station (now in the process of being converted to non military use), Indian Valley, Shell Ridge Open Space and Lime Ridge Open Spaces near the city of Walnut Creek, and east to the Los Vaqueros Reservoir watershed. The new Marsh Creek State Park and Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve are among the open spaces stretching to the north. In this way the open spaces controlled by cities, the East Bay Regional Park District, Mount Diablo State Park, and various regional preserves now adjoin and protect much of the elevated regions of the mountain. There are unprotected areas in Arroyo del Cerro, Curry Canyon, the Marsh creek region, and on the northern slopes of North Peak, and in a number of inholdings surrounded by preserve land.

Park expansion continues on all sides of the mountain although its western boundaries are largely complete. Extensive development continues in the southwestern foothills and Tassajara region, such as the upscale development of Blackhawk and individual estates overlooking the Livermore Valley on Morgan Territory Road. Other large projects are proposed in the northern Black Diamond Mines and Los Medanos foothills, at the Concord Naval Weapons Station, and near Marsh Creek State Park. Large-scale development of other private parcels is restricted by city and county urban limit lines, by lack of water, excessive slope, and sensitive resources including rare species. Development of smaller ranchette subdivisions continue to fragment and threaten many parcels and large areas of habitat.

In 2007 Save Mount Diablo published &quot;Mount Diablo, Los Vaqueros &amp; Surrounding Parks, Featuring the Diablo Trail&quot;, the most accurate and up-to-date map of Mount Diablo&#x27;s more than of protected lands. It includes 100 access points, of trail, and of private fire roads.

==Natural history==

===Geology===

Mount Diablo is a geologic anomaly about east of San Francisco. The mountain is the result of geologic compression and uplift caused by the movements of the Earth&#x27;s plates. The mountain lies between converging earthquake faults and continues to grow slowly. While the principal faults in the region are of the strike-slip type, a significant thrust fault (with no surface trace) is found on the mountain&#x27;s southwest flank. The uplift and subsequent weathering and erosion have exposed ancient oceanic Jurassic and Cretaceous age rocks that now form the summit. The mountain grows from three to five millimeters each year.

The upper portion of the mountain is made up of volcanic and sedimentary deposits of what once was one or more island arcs of the Farallon Plate dating back to the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, between 90 and 190 million years ago. During this time, the Farallon Plate was subducting beneath the North American continent. These deposits were scraped off the top and accreted onto the North American Plate. This resulted in the highly distorted and fractured basalt and serpentine of the Mount Diablo Ophiolite and metasediments of the Franciscan Complex around the summit. East of the subduction zone, a basin was filling with sediment from the ancestral Sierra further to the east. Up to 60,000 feet (18,000 m) of sandstone, mudstone, and limestone of the Great Valley Sequence were deposited from 66 to 150 million years ago. These deposits are now found faulted against the Ophiolite and Franciscan deposits.

Over the past 20 million years continental deposits have been periodically laid down and subsequently jostled around by the newly formed San Andreas Fault system, forming the Coast Ranges. Within the last four million years, local faulting has resulted in compression, folding, buckling, and erosion, bringing the various formations into their current juxtaposition. This faulting action continues to change the shape of Mount Diablo, along with the rest of the Coast Ranges.

The summit area of Mount Diablo is made up of deposits of gray sandstone, graywacke, chert, oceanic volcanic basalts (greenstone) and a minor amount of shale. The hard red Franciscan chert is sedimentary in origin and rich in microscopic radiolaria fossils. In the western foothills of the mountain there are large deposits of younger sandstone rocks also rich in seashells, severely tilted and in places forming dramatic ridgelines. Mount Diablo forms a double pyramid which gives the appearance of a volcano although in fact it is formed of ancient sea floor rock being uplifted by relatively recent tectonic forces.

Deposits of glassmaking-grade sand and lower-quality coal north of the mountain were mined in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but are now open to visitors as the Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve. Guided tours of the sand mines and coal field are provided.

===Vegetation===
The park&#x27;s vegetation is mixed oak woodland and savannah and open grassland with extensive areas of chaparral and a number of endemic plant species, such as the Mount Diablo manzanita (&quot;Arctostaphylos auriculata&quot;), Mount Diablo fairy-lantern (&quot;Calochortus pulchellus&quot;), chaparral bellflower (&quot;Campanula exigua&quot;), Mount Diablo bird&#x27;s beak (&quot;Cordylanthus nidularius&quot;), Mount Diablo phacelia (&quot;Phacelia phacelioides)&quot; and Mount Diablo sunflower (&quot;Helianthella castanea&quot;). The park includes substantial thickets, isolated examples, and mixed ground cover of western poison oak. (It is best to learn the characteristics of this shrub and its toxin before hiking on narrow trails through brush and to be aware that it can be bare of leaves (but toxic to contact) in the winter.)

At higher altitudes and on north slopes is the widely distributed foothill pine (&quot;Pinus sabiniana&quot;). Knobcone pine (&quot;Pinus attenuata&quot;) may be found along Knobcone Pine Road in the southern part of the park. The park and nearby Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve mark the northern extreme of the range of Coulter pine (&quot;Pinus coulteri&quot;). This species may be seen along the Coulter Pine Trail near the north (Mitchell Canyon) entrance.

In 2005 the endangered species Mount Diablo buckwheat (&quot;Eriogonum truncatum&quot;), thought to be extinct since last seen in 1936, was rediscovered in a remote area of the mountain.
===Wildlife===

All vegetation, minerals and wildlife within the park are protected and it is illegal to remove such items or to harass any wildlife.

Commonly seen animals include coyote, bobcat, black-tailed deer, California ground squirrels, fox squirrels and grey foxes; many other mammals including mountain lions are present. It is a chief remaining refuge for the threatened Alameda whipsnake, California red-legged frog. Less common wildlife species include the reintroduced peregrine falcon, ringtail cats, and to the east American badgers, San Joaquin kit fox, roadrunners, California tiger salamander, and burrowing owls. There are also exotic (non-native) animals such as the red fox and opossum, the latter being North America&#x27;s only marsupial.

In September and October male tarantula spiders can be seen (&quot;Aphonopelma iodius&quot;) as they seek a mate. These spiders are harmless unless severely provoked, and their bite is only as bad as a bee sting. More dangerous are black widow spiders, far less likely to be encountered in the open.

In the wintertime, between November and February, bald eagles and golden eagles are present. These birds are less easily seen than many raptors; golden eagles, particularly, fly at high elevations. Mount Diablo is part of the Altamont Area/Diablo Range, which enjoys the largest concentration of golden eagles anywhere. In recent years there have been credible sightings of California condors, which have been reintroduced at Pinnacles National Park, located to the south in the Gilroy-Hollister area.

Of special note as potential hazards are Northern Pacific rattlesnake. While generally shy and non-threatening, one should be observant and cautious of where one steps to avoid accidentally disturbing one. They are often found warming themselves in the open (as on trails and ledges) on cool, sunny days. Other wildlife to avoid include fleas, ticks and mosquitoes.

There has also been an increase in the mountain lion or puma (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;) population in the larger region and one should know how to respond if these animals are encountered. Please see the &quot;mountain lion safety tips&quot; in the mountain lion article.

Although tule elk, an elk subspecies found only in California, were historically native to the Mount Diablo Region, they were hunted to extinction by 1850. Northwards expansion of Diablo Range elk to Mount Diablo has been blocked by Interstate 580. However, in 2006 a bull elk swam across Suisun Bay from the Grizzly Island herd to Contra Costa County, and historically large herds crossed the Carquinez Strait.

==Facilities==
Entrance stations are located at the end of Northgate Road (in Walnut Creek) and Diablo Road (in Danville). The Danville entrance is also known as Southgate. If the entrance stations are not operating, park fees may be paid at the junction ranger station, where the two roads join.

From here the road reaches the summit of the mountain, where there is a visitors center housing an observation deck and natural history exhibits. From the elevation of the lower lot the Mary Bowerman Trail is a level wheelchair-accessible path and boardwalk with interpretive stations that extends part way around the mountain; a regular single track trail completes the loop. There are of hiking and equestrian trails, some available for mountain biking.

Camping facilities are available within the park. There are numerous picnic sites. Pets are restricted and require proper documentation for rabies (not just a tag). Daytime visitors must exit the park by sunset except for special events. Some picnic spots may be reserved but most are available without reservation.

Alcohol is forbidden in the park. Fires are allowed only during the wet season (generally December through April), and only in sanctioned fire pits. The park may be closed on windy days during the dry season due to extremely hazardous fire conditions.

Two additional entrances with parking for hikers are provided on the northwest side of the park at Mitchell Canyon and Donner Canyon. Mitchell Canyon provides easy access to Black Point and Eagle Peak. Donner Canyon provides hikers access to Eagle Peak, Mount Olympia, North Peak, and the popular Falls Trail, which features several seasonal waterfalls.

==Climate==

The National Weather Service maintains a weather station at Mount Diablo Junction, 2,170 feet (661 m) above sea level. The warmest month at the station is July with an average high of 85.2 °F (29.5 °C) and an average low of 59.6 °F (15.3 °C). The coolest month is January with an average high of 55.6 °F (13.1 °C) and an average low of 39.3° (4.1 °C). The highest temperature recorded there was 111 °F (43.9 °C) on July 15, 1972. The lowest temperature on record was 14 °F (-10 °C) on February 6, 1989, and on December 14, 1990. (The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reported that the temperature dropped to 10 °F (-12.2 °C) at the summit on January 21, 1962.) Temperatures reach 90 °F (32.2 °C) or higher on an average of 36.0 days each year and 100 °F (37.8 °C) or higher on 3.3 days each year. Lows of 32 °F (0 °C) or lower occur on an average of 15.4 days annually.
Annual precipitation averages . The most precipitation recorded in a month was in February 1998. The greatest 24-hour precipitation was on January 21, 1972. The average annual days with measurable precipitation is 65.3 days.

Snowfall at Mount Diablo Junction averages each year. Prior to 2009, the most snowfall observed in a month was in April 1975; that same month saw in one day (April 4, 1975). The greatest snow depth was on January 27, 1972. Measurable snowfall does not occur every year, so the annual average days with measurable snowfall is only .5 days. Snow is more common in the upper reaches of the mountain. On December 7, 2009, Mount Diablo received a rare snowfall of , more in one day than what is normally received in a decade.

===Data-collecting note===

The Mt. Diablo Junction weather station is positioned at only about 55 percent of the mountain&#x27;s height. Temperatures and snow levels are notably different than at the upper reaches of the mountain, where lower temperatures and greater snowfall may have occurred, but simply have not been recorded. Nearby Bay Area mountains, like Mount Hamilton, have their weather stations at or near the summit. This is why recorded snow levels on Mount Hamilton are much higher than the ones recorded at Mount Diablo Junction, even though the difference in height of Mount Hamilton and Mount Diablo is only about .

Three conditions are measured at the actual summit, however: wind speed, wind direction and temperature; and are available by an automatic telephone voice response system. Recorded information concerning gate open times, road and pet restrictions, and events is available at another number. These numbers are posted at the park website.


==Art and literature==

Mount Diablo has inspired many artists and writers. Early work centered on exploration, surveying and was related to the rise and popularization of tourism in the Pacific west. Themes were suggested and heightened by early tourism promoters, the beginnings of the area&#x27;s preservation and the rise of the environmental movement. The focus was accelerated by artists associated with the University of California, Berkeley, the California College of Arts, the actions of the organizations Save Mount Diablo and the Mount Diablo Interpretive Association, and area art centers, galleries, and museums. In modern times Mount Diablo art has been most strongly represented in plein aire painting, especially the group Artists for Action, and photography.

Representative work includes books and articles by classical writers such as William Brewer, Richard Henry Dana Jr., Alexandre Dumas, père, Bret Harte, and the Reverend Thomas Starr King, and modern ones such as Mark Allen Cunningham. Poets whose work features the mountain include Philip Lamantia, Andrew Schelling, and Helen Pinkerton.

Early painters include Thomas Almond Ayres, Eugene Camerer, W. H. Dougal, Eduard Hildebrandt, Charles Hittell, Edward Jump, William Keith, John Ross Key, Charles Koppel, Edward Lehman, Pascal Loomis, Henry Miller, Joseph Warren Revere, through Clarkson Dye and others, to modern painters such as Robert Becker, Frank J. Bette, Ruth Breve, Betty Boggess Lathrap, Paul Carey, Bob Chapla, Mary Lou Correia, Ellen Curtis, Pam Della, Susan Dennis, Warren Dreher, John Finger, Pam Glover, JoAnn Hanna, Peg Humphreys, Don Irwin, Jeanne Kapp, Geri Keary, Chris Kent, Paul Kratter, Eunice Kritscher, Fred Martin, Cathy Moloney, Shirley Nootbaar, Charlotte Panton, Greg Piatt, Kenneth Potter, Robin Purcell, Ocean Quigley, Don Reich, Mary Silverwood, Barbara Stanton, Bruce Stangeland, Marty Stanley, and even the recognized comic book painter Dan Brereton.

Photographers include Ansel Adams, Cleet Carlton, Alfred A. Hart, Scott Hein, Stephen Joseph, Don Paulson, Brad Perks, Robert Picker, Richard Rollins, David Sanger, Michael Sewell and Bob Walker.

The mountain has inspired musical artists ranging from the Kronos Quartet to commissioned works by the California Symphony. Local pop-punk band The Story So Far have a song titled &quot;Mt. Diablo&quot;.

The mountain&#x27;s name is the source for the &quot;Devils&quot; part of the name of the Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps, a 17 time Drum Corps International world champion corps, founded and based in Concord, California since 1957.

David Brevik, head of Blizzard North, got the idea for the name of the Diablo game franchise from Mt. Diablo while living nearby.

In Marvel Comics, the Black Celestial named Tiamut was imprisoned under Mt Diablo for his crimes against the other Celestials. Arishem and the others sealed him away beneath the Diablo Mountain Range in California. See Fantastic Four Vol 1 #339 and #340.

==Events==

Each Fall the male tarantulas of Mt. Diablo emerge from their burrows to seek mates. The Mt. Diablo Interpretive Association offers guided hikes to observe the migration. The &quot;March of the Tarantulas&quot; can begin as early as August and last through October.

Every year since 1964, the Pearl Harbor survivors and their families have memorialized Pearl Harbor Day by relighting the historic Beacon atop Mount Diablo&#x27;s summit. A ceremony memorializing the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, is held at the Cal State East Bay Concord Campus, with some of the few remaining survivors who are present. (In 2020, the ceremony was virtual.) This ceremony is made possible due to the support of Mount Diablo State Park, California State University - East Bay: Concord Campus, Save Mount Diablo, CCTV, Vietnam Helicopters Museum, and the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors.

Under cloudless conditions, more interesting than the sunset itself is the view of the progression of the mountain&#x27;s shadow across the California Central Valley from the south to the distant Sierra Nevada to the north, finally appearing for a few moments above the horizon as a shadow in the post-sunset sky glow.

In April 1946, an Army C-45 transport plane crashed on the north side of the mountain, killing the pilot and co-pilot.

&quot;Save Mount Diablo&quot; sponsors many spring and fall schedules of events on the mountain, Spring on Diablo and Autumn on Diablo, as well as many other special events, including its anniversary event, Moonlight on the Mountain; Four Days Diablo, a trip on the Diablo Trail; the Mount Diablo Challenge, an annual hill climb to the summit with more than 1,100 cyclists each October; and the Mount Diablo Trail Adventure, combined 10k and half-marathon hikes and runs.

The park is popular in winter, when Bay Area residents can enjoy the rare experience of snowfall on the mountain. Snow occurs from the lower reaches of the park all the way to the peak, as was the case in February 2001 and February and March 2006. On Friday, March 10, 2006, an extremely cold storm moved into the region from the Gulf of Alaska, and noticeable amounts of snow fell in all regions of the Bay Area above 500 feet (152 m). The summit of the mountain received around six inches (15 cm) of snow at its peak, and the access roads were closed to automobiles at the 3,000 feet (914 m) mark due to the hazardous icy conditions above.

Occasionally there will be public access to astronomical observations made by a local astronomy club. This club was allocated a small parcel on the mountain and developed a permanent observatory at this location. The observatory has a computer-controlled telescope with a CCD camera.

===Mount Diablo Challenge bicycle race===

The Mount Diablo Challenge is a bicycle race held annually on the first Sunday in October and benefiting non-profit, Save Mount Diablo&#x27;s land preservation programs. The race begins at The Athenian School at the base of the mountain and climbs in . The race typically draws between 800 and 1,100 riders each year who compete in a mass-start format. Bicycle riders of every age and ability are represented in the field, from weekend enthusiasts to top professionals. Prizes are typically awarded to the top overall male and female finishers, along with several age-specific categories. The most coveted prize is the special &quot;One-Hour&quot; T-shirts, awarded to those who finish the climb in less than one hour.

===Course record===

The course record for the Mount Diablo climb currently stands at 43 minutes, 33 seconds, set on October 5, 2008, by Nate English (ZteaM) 4 days after breaking his thumb in a bike accident. He broke the 44 minutes, 58 seconds record, set in 2004 by former professional cyclist Greg Drake (Webcor Cycling Team) of Redwood City, California. The previous course record was set by former professional cyclist Mike Engleman (Coors Light Pro Cycling Team) in 1990 with a time of 45 minutes, 20 seconds.

The fastest woman&#x27;s time recorded at the Mount Diablo climb was set in 2012 by Flavia Oliveira (48 minutes, 13 seconds). In 2016, Flavia competed at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro where she finished in seventh place.

Outside of the actual Mt Diablo Challenge each October, the climb is one of the more popular uploaded to Strava, with over 11000 attempts recorded as of mid 2014. The top 10 times listed there are all from the Tour of California, which has used Mt Diablo as a stage several times. The fastest time (40:49) as of January 2021 is held by professional cyclist Lawson Craddock set in May 2013.

== In popular culture ==
* In &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, a mountain range known as &quot;Mount Chiliad&quot; was based on Mount Diablo. It reappears in &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;.
* The silhouette of the mountain was used for the cover art of the books &quot;PiHKAL&quot; and &quot;TiHKAL&quot; by Alexander Shulgin.
* In the book &quot;The Lost Hero&quot; by &quot;Rick Riordan&quot;, Piper McLean&#x27;s father is captured and help captive on the summit of Mount Diablo by the giant Enceladus.
* The pop-punk band The Story So Far have a song named after the mountain on their debut record.

== Famous residents ==

James &quot;Grizzly&quot; Adams was a frequent visitor and resident on Mount Diablo in the mid-1850s.

Robert Walter &quot;Bob&quot; Jones, the first professional baseball player from Contra Costa County, was born in the &quot;Jones House&quot; in Irish Canyon in 1889, a current acquisition project of Save Mount Diablo.

The Mount Diablo Ranch, or Diablo Ranch, was successively owned by Robert Noble Burgess (b. 1878 - d. 1965), who founded the community of Diablo and built the mountain&#x27;s first auto roads, and millionaire Walter Paul Frick (aka W. P. Frick, b. 1875 - d. 1937), who lived in Diablo and was important in the creation of the State Park in 1931, including sale of six of the first seven parcels for the new park.

Jazz pianist Dave Brubeck grew up on Brubeck Ranch near the park&#x27;s North Gate entrance.

The area for the Blackhawk Farm, including the mountain&#x27;s southern Black Hills, was acquired from Burgess and created by Ansel Mills Easton, the namesake uncle of photographer Ansel Adams. Eventually nearly two-thirds of the farm was added to Mount Diablo State Park. The remainder was developed as the community of Blackhawk by resident developer Ken Behring and his partner Ken Hofmann.

==Legends and folklore==

Mount Diablo has long been the site of numerous reports pertaining to cryptozoology, hauntings, mysterious lights, and various other Fortean phenomena (it is rumored that the name &quot;Mount Diablo&quot; is derived from the propensity for such weird events to be alleged at, or in the immediate vicinity of, the mountain). Phantom black &quot;panthers&quot; are seen with unusual frequency on the slopes of the mountain, as well as at the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Hole&quot; region of the Las Trampas Regional Wilderness. As early as 1806, General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo (July 4, 1807 – January 18, 1890) reported an encounter with a flying, spectral apparition, while engaged in military operations against the &quot;Bolgones&quot; band of the Bay Miwok tribe. In 1873, a live frog was said to be found within a slab of limestone at a mine on Mount Diablo.

<text>The red-breasted swallow (Cecropis semirufa), also known as the rufous-chested swallow, is a member of the family Hirundinidae, found in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is confined to the tropical rainforest during the wet season.

==Description==

The red-breasted swallow is similar to the mosque swallow but is slightly smaller and has longer tail streamers, both species having a blue crown and mantle contrasting with a rufous rump and underparts, In the red-breasted swallow the dark crown extends below the eye and there is no white on the underwing. The juvenile is similar to the red-rumped swallow but has blue on the side of the head rather than dull red.

==Distribution and movements==
The red-breasted swallow is found over most of Africa south of the Sahara from the Eastern Cape north to northern Namibia and southern Angola in the west and Mozambique in the east, with a disjunct range from Senegal south to northern Angola east to Uganda, southwestern Kenya and northwestern Tanzania.

The red-breasted swallow is migratory in most of its range. In southern Africa it is a summer visitor, nesting between July and March with most of the population migrating to equatorial Africa, although a few remain all year. In some parts of its range, e.g. in southeastern Nigeria to Gabon, it appears to be resident, but it is mostly a rainy season breeding visitor across its northern range.

==Habitat==
The red-breasted swallow is a bird of dry open country. In more wooded areas it is replaced by the similar mosque swallow. It builds a closed mud nest with a tubular entrance in a cavity or under bridges and similar structures. It will use deserted buildings, tree holes or caves, and has benefited from the construction of railway bridges and similar structures.

==Biology==
The red-breasted swallow is generally a solitary species and pairs rarely breed in groups. Three eggs are a typical clutch. These birds feed on insects which are almost all caught in the air and the species rarely lands on the ground, rather perching on wires and twigs. The typical flight is slow and buoyant. Like the closely related red-rumped and mosque swallows, the nests of the red-breasted swallow are often usurped by the white-rumped swift.

==Subspecies==
There are two recognised subspecies.

*&quot;Cecropis semirufa gordoni&quot; is a smaller and slightly duller coloured subspecies found in the northern part of the species range.
*&quot;Cecropis semirufa semirufa&quot; is found in southern Africa.

The birds breeding in east Africa are intermediate and have been named as a potential third subspecies &quot;Cecropis semirufa neumanni&quot;.

<doc id="427158" wikidata="Q1305295" url="?curid=427158" title="Pilotwings (video game)">
<text>is a flight simulation video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was originally released in Japan in December 1990, shortly after the launch of the Super Famicom in the country. It was also released as a launch title for the SNES in August 1991 in North America, with a European release following in 1992.

In &quot;Pilotwings&quot;, the player attempts to earn pilot licenses through lessons in light plane flight, hang gliding, skydiving, and the use of a rocket belt. Bonus stages and levels involving an attack helicopter are also available. Each event offers unique controls and gameplay mechanics. To increase the realism of the game&#x27;s flight simulation, the developers extensively utilized the SNES&#x27;s Mode 7 capability, which mimics 3D graphics by rotating and scaling flat objects.

The game was well-received upon its release, largely thanks to its graphical presentation. The game has since been re-released for the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console and Nintendo Switch Online in PAL regions, North America, and Japan, as well as New Nintendo 3DS in North America. A sequel, &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot;, was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996. After many years of announcements and cancellations, Nintendo released a second sequel, &quot;Pilotwings Resort&quot;, in 2011 for the Nintendo 3DS.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Pilotwings&quot; takes place at a flight club which is divided into four distinct training areas. The player&#x27;s objective is to pass each training area and earn licenses based on the difficulty of the courses. Each area features 2—4 events, which may be played in any order. In each event, the player controls one of four aerial vehicles and must complete a task (usually flying through floating markers) then land safely and accurately within a time limit. Upon completing an event, the player earns points and receives comments from the instructors. Points are awarded based on criteria such as the time taken to complete the event, the accuracy of the landing, and the completion of the stated objective. To pass a training area and move to the next one, the combined scores from the events must exceed a specific threshold. Each training area can be replayed if necessary, and passwords allow players to save their progress.

The four events are:
*Light plane: The player pilots a biplane through a course of orbs or rings, then lands and stops it on the runway.
*Skydiving: The player jumps from a helicopter at a high altitude and maneuvers by leaning forward and back, and by rotating on a horizontal axis. The player must fall through rings of orbs in the sky before deploying the parachute, and must then attempt to land in a target area made up of concentric circles.
*Jet pack: The player takes control of a rocket belt, which can be controlled with left and right yaw rotation, leaning forward and back to control speed. High and low levels of thrust allow high speed and finer control, respectively. The player must take off and fly through a series of rings, bars, or other objects before landing in a target area.
*Hang gliding: The player guides the hang glider to a series of thermal currents to reach a specified altitude, and then land as close as possible to the center of a gray square target.

Some events have bonus stages that add to a player&#x27;s score, even if it has already reached the maximum number. In the skydiving, rocket belt, and hang glider modes, landing on moving platforms rewards players with a perfect score, and a bonus stage for extra points may be earned by falling into the water of a target area. These stages include maneuvering a diving penguin into a pool, bouncing a winged man across a series of trampolines, and flying another winged man as far as possible.

After completing the certification courses for all four training zones, the player is informed that an agent has infiltrated an enemy base (&quot;EVIL Syndicate&quot;) on the fictional Izanu Island and has freed the player&#x27;s kidnapped instructors, who are waiting to be rescued. The player must fly an attack helicopter from an offshore aircraft carrier and retrieve the captives by landing on a helipad on the island. As the player flies over the island, they must successfully dodge anti-aircraft fire from ground-based turrets which are able to shoot down the helicopter and end the game with a single hit. The helicopter has forward, backward, left, and right pitch controls, rotor throttle controls for altitude, and left and right missile firing controls. After completing the mission, the player earns the &quot;Pilot&#x27;s Wings&quot; certificate and replay the training areas with inclement weather conditions and higher score requirements, followed by another nighttime helicopter mission. Clearing the second helicopter mission awards the player with the golden &quot;Pilot&#x27;s Wings,&quot; and completion of the game.

==Development==
&quot;Pilotwings&quot; was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development (EAD), a team consisting of members of the company&#x27;s Research &amp; Development divisions, under the leadership of producer Shigeru Miyamoto. Nintendo EAD completed &quot;Pilotwings&quot; and two other games (&quot;Super Mario World&quot; and &quot;F-Zero&quot;) within 15 months of the debut of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. &quot;Pilotwings&quot; was released in Japan on December 21, 1990, one month after the system&#x27;s launch, and was later released in North America in August 1991 as a launch title. The game&#x27;s musical score was composed by Soyo Oka, while her superior Koji Kondo was responsible for the sound programming and the helicopter theme. Six tracks from the game, including a rearranged version of the skydiving theme, appeared on the &quot;Nintendo Super Famicom Game Music&quot; album, released in Japan on March 4, 1992. Six piano-arranged versions of songs from the game were included on the &quot;Nintendo Super Famicom Game Music: Fun Together with Beyer&quot; CD, which was released in Japan on November 30, 1993.

A flight simulator game resembling &quot;Pilotwings&quot; called &quot;Dragonfly&quot; was shown during the official unveiling of the SNES to the Japanese press on November 21, 1988. The game was used to demonstrate the system&#x27;s Mode 7 graphics system, which allows rotation, scaling, and other effects to be used on flat images to create a 3D effect. Because the game does not use the coprocessor chip Super FX, the true Super NES 3D technology, the buildings, runway, trees, and so on are all &quot;painted&quot; flat on the ground plane, and they appear to stick out of the ground when the player&#x27;s viewpoint is far above.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Pilotwings&quot; was positively received during both its initial release and in retrospective reviews. The game drew praise for its presentation, with publications describing the game&#x27;s use of Mode 7 graphics as &quot;stunning&quot; and &quot;jaw-dropping&quot;. &quot;Pilotwings&quot; was generally seen as a showpiece title for the Super NES, demonstrating its Mode 7 features, built-in sprite scaling, and high-end sound chip in a conspicuous manner. Its level of challenge was also positively noted; &quot;Mean Machines&quot; found that practicing the flight tests and reaching the end of the game was very rewarding. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; remarked in 2009, &quot;This early SNES title is still enjoyable enough to be considered a true classic.&quot;

In February 2006, &quot;Pilotwings&quot; was listed as the 153rd best game on a Nintendo console by &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;. They also listed it as the 20th best game on the Super NES. IGN listed it in their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot; at number 74 in 2003, and at number 91 in 2007. They later placed it as the 80th best Super NES game. It was named the 16th best game on the Super NES by GameDaily in 2008, while &quot;Game Informer&quot; listed it at number 131 in its &quot;Top 200 Games of All Time&quot; in 2009. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked the game number 61 on its February 2009 &quot;100 Best Nintendo Games&quot; list. In April 1996, &quot;Super Play&quot; listed it as the tenth greatest game for the Super NES. In 2018, Complex rated the game 77th on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;. In 1995, Total! placed the game 20th on their Top 100 SNES Games. In 1996, GamesMaster listed Pilotwings 30th in its &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time.&quot;

&quot;Pilotwings&quot; sold over two million copies worldwide by 1995. A sequel, &quot;Pilotwings 64&quot;, was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 as a launch title for its respective system. A second sequel for the Nintendo 64, which showed off the console&#x27;s capabilities, was cancelled due to lack of development resources within Nintendo. In 2003, it was announced that Factor 5 was working on a GameCube incarnation of the &quot;Pilotwings&quot; series. Development was moved to Nintendo&#x27;s Wii console shortly thereafter. However, an anonymous blogger claimed in late 2009 that Factor 5 had indeed finished working on it, but that Nintendo was not confident in publishing it. Nintendo finally announced a new title in the series, the Nintendo 3DS title &quot;Pilotwings Resort&quot;, at E3 2010. The new title was released as a launch title for the 3DS in North America on March 27, 2011.

The game has been featured in the Game On historical exhibition organized by the Barbican Centre, including a display at the Science Museum in London in 2007. Nintendo re-released &quot;Pilotwings&quot; on the Wii Virtual Console service in PAL regions and North America in 2009 and in Japan in 2010, and then on the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013. On September 5, 2019, the game became available on the Nintendo Switch Online service for the Nintendo Switch.

In 2023 Roger Waters made reference to the game in a narrative dream sequence involving a battle of good versus evil in On The Run, the 3rd track of The Dark Side of the Moon Redux 

A stage based on &quot;Pilotwings&quot; makes an appearance in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Wii U&quot; and &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. The stage combines elements from the original Super NES game and &quot;Pilotwings Resort&quot;.

<doc id="427160" wikidata="Q2003440" url="?curid=427160" title="Sheldon Souray">
<text>Sheldon Souray (born July 13, 1976) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman who played 14 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the New Jersey Devils, Montreal Canadiens, Edmonton Oilers, Dallas Stars, and Anaheim Ducks. He was best known for his heavy slapshot, once setting a previous unofficial NHL record for the hardest recorded shot at the Oilers&#x27; 2009 Skills Competition.

==Playing career==

===New Jersey Devils (1997–2000)===
Before playing in the NHL, Sheldon was a member of the Fort Saskatchewan Traders in the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL). He was drafted in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft in the third round, 71st overall, by the New Jersey Devils. Souray reported to his second Devils training camp overweight and out-of-shape, prompting general manager Lou Lamoriello called him embarrassing, and that he would never play for the team if it happened again. Souray credits Lamoriello for calling him out, and says it was exactly what he needed to succeed at such a high level. He made his NHL debut in the 1997–98 season. He finished his rookie season with modest scoring totals of three goals and ten points in 60 games, but most importantly established that he was capable of being an NHL regular. He scored his first NHL goal on a powerful slapshot late in a December 16, 1997, game against the rival New York Rangers to break a 3–3 tie late in the third period and send the Devils to a 4–3 win. Souray played in New Jersey from 1997 to midway through the 1999–2000 season, earning a reputation as a big, steady, physical defender with a mean streak and a hard shot. However, with the Devils preparing to make their Stanley Cup run late in the 1999–2000 season and believing they needed more offence from the blue line, Souray was traded to the Montreal Canadiens on March 1, 2000, in exchange for Vladimir Malakhov.

===Montreal Canadiens (2000–2007)===
Souray&#x27;s offence began to improve following his trade to the Canadiens. At the time of his trade from the Devils, he had just eight points, all assists. He finished with three goals in 19 games as a Canadien to tie his career best for goals in a season, and establish a new career best for points (11) in 71 combined games. More importantly, he began using his dangerous shot more often once he arrived in Montreal. In 2000–01, injuries limited him to just 52 games, 19 less than the previous year, but Souray still managed to match his previous season&#x27;s career bests in goals (3), assists (8) and points. He got off to a good start in 2001–02, threatening to surpass his previous offensive highs, as he tallied three goals and five assists in just 34 games while fighting through an injury-plagued campaign. 2001–02 also saw him record his first career power play goal, as the Canadiens began to realize the value of having a player on the point who could consistently shoot the puck as hard as Souray. However, he suffered a wrist injury that plagued him throughout the year, and though he would play through it much of the season, Souray would eventually shut it down at the end of the season.

The severity of the wrist injury kept him out the entire 2002–03 season while he recovered and regained his strength. However, in 2003–04, Souray returned to play for the Canadiens and had a breakout season, amassing a surprising 15 goals and 35 points. He had exceeded expectations with the sudden development of his offensive game, especially given his reputation as a defence-first rearguard throughout his NHL career up to that point. This was of course possible because his powerful slapshot had returned along with his health, he was using his shot more often than ever before, and the Canadiens were giving him plenty of scoring opportunities by using him on the power play and increasing his overall ice time. During this season, he participated in the 2004 All-Star Game for the first time, and shared a win in the Skills Competition&#x27;s hardest shot contest. Both he and Adrian Aucoin recorded blasts of 102.2 mph in the event. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, he played for Färjestad BK of the Swedish Elitserien. While in Sweden, Souray wrote a correspondence in the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; with the assistance of hockey writer Dave Stubbs. The correspondence chronicled Souray&#x27;s experience in a new country, and the different style of play that is popular overseas compared to the North American style of play. He also had the chance to represent his home country internationally by playing for Team Canada in the 2005 IIHF World Championships. Due to the lockout, this tournament featured a much higher percentage than usual of NHL players, of which Souray was one.

Souray returned from the lockout to post a successful 2005–06, with 12 goals and a new career best 39 points. However, in 2006–07, Souray emerged as a top-tier defence man in the NHL with a career-best 26 goals, 38 assists and 64 points, placing second in team-scoring in both goals and points, and third in assists, a remarkable achievement for a defenceman. His slapshot&#x27;s reputation continued to grow throughout the League, to the point it could inspire fear in opposing players. It was so successful that season, Souray even used it in a shootout as a decoy in a December 2, 2006 game. That goal, scored on Toronto Maple Leafs goaltender Andrew Raycroft in the shootout, stood as the eventual winner in a 4–3 Montreal victory. On April 5, 2007, Souray broke the NHL single-season record for most powerplay goals scored by a defenceman with his 19th of the season. The record was previously shared by Denis Potvin of the New York Islanders (1974–75) and Adrian Aucoin of the Vancouver Canucks (1998–99). Souray was named to his second NHL All-Star Game that season, this time as a starter, and posted the second-hardest slapshot at the Skills Competition with a 100.0 mph shot, finishing as runner-up to event winner Zdeno Chára (100.4 mph). It was a banner year for Souray, as he led all NHL defencemen in goals and finished third in points, behind only Scott Niedermayer and Sergei Gonchar. Entering into the 2007 off-season, it was clear that Souray would be one of the top available defencemen as an unrestricted free agent.

===Edmonton Oilers (2007–2011)===
In the off-season, Souray became an unrestricted free agent and, on July 12, 2007, he signed a five-year, $27 million contract with the Edmonton Oilers, his favourite team growing up. However, his debut season with the Oilers was not the dream he imagined, as injuries limited him to only 26 games played. Already recovering from a shoulder injury when he entered training camp, Souray played through it, but reinjured the shoulder just six games into the season in a fight, and missed the next 55 games. 

In 2008–09, he bounced back from the injury-shortened campaign to record 23 goals and 53 points and once again become an NHL All-Star. He finished third in the hardest shot competition that year, clocking in at 102.3 mph, behind Shea Weber (103.4) of the Nashville Predators, and winner Zdeno Chára (105.4) of the Boston Bruins. But during the Oilers&#x27; own 2009 Skills Competition, on January 4, Souray set the then-unofficial NHL record for the hardest shot. Clocked at 106.7 mph, his slapshot beat Chad Kilger&#x27;s old unofficial record of 106.6 mph set at the Toronto Maple Leafs&#x27; 2006 Skills Competition. The record was deemed unofficial, however, as the League does not recognize individual team Skills Competitions and instead goes by the NHL All-Star Game&#x27;s Skills Competition results. Souray&#x27;s unofficial shot was not surpassed until January 28, 2012, by Chára, whose 108.8 mph slapshot in the Skills Competition preceding the 2012 All-Star Game beat Souray&#x27;s blast and set the official record. Souray also earned a humorous nickname during his strong 2008–09 season, when during the third period of a 5–2 victory over the Dallas Stars on December 3, 2008, the Stars&#x27; broadcast team referred to Souray as the &quot;Studly Wonderbomb&quot; as a recognition of his slapshot&#x27;s prowess.

In 2009–10, injuries resurfaced. On October 8, 2009, just three games into the season, Souray suffered a concussion after Calgary Flames captain Jarome Iginla checked him into the boards head-first, causing him to miss the next 16 games. Then, on January 30, 2010, in a rematch against the Flames, Souray fought Iginla, resulting in a Boxer&#x27;s fracture in his right hand, requiring surgery taking him out for the remainder of the season finishing 19th four goals and nine assists for 13 points in 37 contests played. Shortly after getting the surgery, Souray developed a staph infection involving his bones and blood within the injured hand, which potentialy putting him at risk of his hand getting amputated. Luckily, an amputation was never performed but the effects required Souray to spend three days in the ICU and was required to carry an IV bag for the next 12 weeks.

During the 2010 off-season, citing irreconcilable differences with Oiler management due to their handling of his various ailments, Souray requested a trade out of Edmonton. The Oilers responded angrily, and a nasty media exchange followed, with the team ultimately placing Souray on waivers in the hope that he would be claimed by another NHL team so that Edmonton would no longer be on the hook for the remainder of his contract. However, due to his high salary and previous year&#x27;s injuries, few NHL teams were willing to take such a large financial risk on a player who might not be 100% healthy, talented as he may be. Souray cleared waivers without being claimed, and was told by management not to attend the Oilers&#x27; training camp. On October 6, 2010, Souray was assigned to the American Hockey League (AHL), being loaned to the Washington Capitals&#x27; minor league affiliate, the Hershey Bears. Souray accepted his demotion to the minors and posted a solid AHL season, as he battled and slowly recovered from his nagging injuries. Leading up to the NHL trade deadline, the Oilers once again placed Souray on waivers in a second attempt to unload his salary. However, NHL teams still had the same concerns about Souray&#x27;s high salary and injury risk, so he cleared waivers a second time and remained under contract to Edmonton as relations between Souray and the Edmonton camp remained testy at best. Finally, in the summer of 2011, Edmonton bought-out the fifth and final year of Souray&#x27;s contract. This allowed Souray to become a free agent and again pursue playing at the NHL level with another team.

===Dallas Stars (2011–2012)===
After becoming a free agent, Souray was signed by the Dallas Stars on July 1, 2011, to a one-year contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/feature/?id=25880&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Having recovered from his injuries, Souray made a successful comeback with the Stars, taking on more of a defensive role than in the recent past, particularly at even strength. However, he continued to still see plenty of ice time on the power play, where his slapshot could wreak havoc for opposing goaltenders, and was encouraged to use his shot as before. The Stars, meanwhile, while recognizing Souray&#x27;s physical style, also openly declared that in order to preserve his health, they did not want him fighting very often, although they did not go so far as to dictate directly for him to never do so. On November 4, 2011, Souray reached a milestone when he scored the 100th NHL goal of his career in a 7–6 win over the Colorado Avalanche. Fittingly, it was a power play goal scored with a slapshot. Souray earned the respect of fans, teammates and local media in Dallas very quickly for his physical style of play and booming shot, and restored some of the goodwill that had been lost due to his spat with the Oilers. Most importantly, Souray was regularly healthy again. Despite missing a handful of games after sustaining an ankle injury blocking a shot in a December 23, 2011, win over the Nashville Predators, he had returned to the Dallas lineup by early January and was again a contributing member of their blueline corps. He finished the 2011–12 season with six goals, 15 assists and 21 points in 64 games.

===Anaheim Ducks (2012–2013)===
On July 1, 2012, Souray signed a three-year, $11 million contract with the Anaheim Ducks. During the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, he remained healthy and carried his strong defensive play over from Dallas, posting a career-best plus-minus rating of +19. He also continued to use his powerful shot to the tune of seven goals and ten assists in 44 games as the Ducks qualified for the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs. For Souray, this was the first time since 2005–06 that he was part of the Stanley Cup playoffs. His final point of the regular season, an assist in a 3–2 overtime loss to the Columbus Blue Jackets on April 17, 2013, was also a personal milestone for Souray, his 300th career NHL point. By January 2014, Souray was placed on the injured reserve list with a shoulder/wrist injury. He appeared on their roster until he announced his retirement on June 30, 2015 after two years of being an unrestricted free agent.

Souray was born in Elk Point, Alberta, to Richard Souray and Lillian Parenteau. He is of Métis descent and has one sister who is two years older. At a young age, Souray moved with his family from Fishing Lake Métis Settlement to a small community in Alberta in order for his sister to attend school. In another two years, they moved again so that Souray could play organized sports. While still in elementary school, Souray&#x27;s parents divorced; he first lived with his mother before moving in with his father at age nine. Growing up, he attended Archbishop O&#x27;Leary Catholic High School with former fellow Oiler Fernando Pisani. Souray has a tattoo of a Métis Chief in full headdress on his arm. He says the tattoo is meant as a reminder to himself to be a positive role model for Native and Métis children, as he himself is proud of his Métis heritage.

Souray was married to former &quot;Baywatch&quot; actress Angelica Bridges from 2002 to 2007. They have two daughters.

In August 2020, Souray got engaged to Tess Annique. They got married September 12, 2021. They have one son Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho. Annique and Souray currently reside in Las Vegas.

<text>Distance is a 2001 film by Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda, starring Arata, Tadanobu Asano, Yūsuke Iseya, Susumu Terajima, and Yui Natsukawa.

==Plot==
Three years ago, members of a cult sabotaged Tokyo&#x27;s water supply, killing hundreds and poisoning thousands, before committing mass suicide on the outskirts of town and having their ashes supposedly dispersed by a lake. On the anniversary of the attack, four members of the families of the perpetrators make the trek to that lake to remember them. When they arrive, they find that a motorcycle was there parked before them. At the dock, they see a former member of the cult, Sakata, who had trained for the attack but had defected at the last minute. He is distant and doesn&#x27;t interact with them.

At the end of the day, they return to their vehicle only to find it missing. While they are discussing what to do as night approaches, Sakata comes and, finding that his motorcycle is also missing, leads them to the cabin where he and the deceased cult members stayed prior to the attack, and they pass the night reminiscing about people they have known and lost. Flashbacks illuminate the moments when the cult members told their families about leaving the real world to join the cult, Sakata&#x27;s time with the cult and eventual escape, and the ensuing police investigation after the attack.

Sakata and Atsushi talk about Yûko, Atsushi&#x27;s sister, whom Sakata had a very close relationship with and had asked to run away with him the night before the attack. Atsushi, according to Sakata, looks nothing like Yûko.

The next morning, they return by train to the city. On the train ride back, Sakata asks Atsushi who he really is, saying that Yuko told him her brother had killed himself a few years before. Atsushi says she was probably lying, and Sakata replies that she would not have said it that way if she were lying.

When Atsushi goes to see the old man he had been visiting in the hospital, the man has died. The nurse says that she had thought Atsushi was the old man&#x27;s son, as he visited often, until the old man&#x27;s actual son had come to the hospital after his death.

The film ends with Atsushi returning to the lake and dropping two flowers, one for his father, implied to be the cult leader, and one for his sister, while Sataka burns Yûko&#x27;s family photos and memorabilia close by. The fire grows larger, and becomes a large conflagration as Atsushi walks away, leaving his past behind.

==Cast==
*Arata – Mizuhara Atsushi, flower shop worker
*Yūsuke Iseya – Enoki Masaru, former swimming instructor
*Susumu Terajima – Kai Minoru, salaryman
*Yui Natsukawa – Yamamoto Kiyoka, teacher
*Tadanobu Asano – Sakata, surviving member
*Ryo – Yûko

==Production==
Kore-eda was originally interested in the disciples of Aum Shinrikyo, which had committed the Tokyo subway sarin attack. He did not intend for the film to be a direct critique of these type of sects but rather that it would bring attention to everybody&#x27;s civic responsibility to stopping such attacks and &quot;how each individual is directly related to or is responsible for a criminal act&quot;.

There was a lot of improvisation when it came to shooting the film. Each of the main actors had information withheld about the other characters&#x27; backstory and were instead given the scenarios in which the characters would interact. The relationships between the characters were thus loosely built upon the actors&#x27; real world interactions.

Much of the film&#x27;s rural shooting took place around Kiyosato, Yamanashi Prefecture and the forests of neighbouring Nagano Prefecture.

==Reception==
On review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Distance&quot; has a score of , with an average rating of based on reviews.

==Awards==
This film was nominated for the Golden Palm award at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival.

<doc id="427175" wikidata="Q2373919" url="?curid=427175" title="Intentional community">
<text>An intentional community is a voluntary residential community designed to foster a high degree of social cohesion and teamwork. Members typically unite around shared values, beliefs, or a common vision, which may be political, religious, spiritual, or simply focused on the practical benefits of cooperation and mutual support. While some groups emphasise shared ideologies, others are centred on enhancing social connections, sharing resources, and creating meaningful relationships.

Although intentional communities are sometimes described as alternative lifestyles or social experiments, some see them as a natural response to the isolation and fragmentation of modern housing, offering a return to the social bonds and collaborative spirit found in traditional village life.

The multitude of intentional communities includes collective households, cohousing communities, coliving, ecovillages, monasteries, survivalist retreats, kibbutzim, Hutterites, ashrams, and housing cooperatives.

== History ==
Ashrams are likely the earliest intentional communities, founded around 1500 BCE. Buddhist monasteries appeared around 500 BCE. Pythagoras founded an intellectual vegetarian commune in about 525 BCE in southern Italy. Hundreds of modern intentional communities were formed across Europe, North and South America, Australia, and New Zealand out of the intellectual foment of utopianism. Intentional communities exhibit the utopian ambition to create a better, more sustainable world for living. 

== Synonyms and definitions ==
Additional terms referring to an intentional community can be alternative lifestyle, intentional society, cooperative community, withdrawn community, enacted community, socialist colony, communistic society, collective settlement, communal society, commune, mutualistic community, communitarian experiment, experimental community, utopian experiment, practical utopia, and utopian society.

The term utopian community as a synonym for an intentional community might be considered to be of pejorative nature and many intentional communities do not consider themselves to be utopian. Also the alternative term commune is considered to be non-neutral or even linked to leftist politics or hippies.

== Variety ==
The purposes of intentional communities vary and may be political, spiritual, economic, or environmental. In addition to spiritual communities, secular communities also exist. One common practice, particularly in spiritual communities, is communal meals. Egalitarian values can be combined with other values. Benjamin Zablocki categorized communities this way:
* Academic communities (see Living-Learning Communities)
* Alternative-family communities (see Tenacious Unicorn Ranch)
* Coliving communities
* Cooperative communities
* Countercultural communities
* Egalitarian communities
* Experimental communities
* Political communities
* Psychological communities (based on mystical or gestalt principles)
* Rehabilitational communities (see Synanon)
* Religious communities
* Spiritual communities

== Membership ==
Members of Christian intentional communities want to emulate the practices of the earliest believers. Using the biblical book of Acts (and, often, the Sermon on the Mount) as a model, members of these communities strive to demonstrate their faith in a corporate context, and to live out the teachings of the New Testament, practicing compassion and hospitality. Communities such as the Simple Way, the Bruderhof and Rutba House would fall into this category. Despite strict membership criteria, these communities are open to visitors and not reclusive to the extent of some other intentional communities.

A survey in the 1995 edition of the &quot;Communities Directory&quot;, published by the Fellowship for Intentional Community (FIC), reported that 54 percent of the communities choosing to list themselves were rural, 28 percent were urban, 10 percent had both rural and urban sites, and 8 percent did not specify.

== Governance ==
The most common form of governance in intentional communities is democratic (64 percent), with decisions made by some form of consensus decision-making or voting. A hierarchical or authoritarian structure governs 9 percent of communities, 11 percent are a combination of democratic and hierarchical structure, and 16 percent do not specify.

== Communes&#x27; core principles ==
The central characteristics of communes, or core principles that define communes, have been expressed in various forms over the years. The Suffolk-born radical John Goodwyn Barmby (1820-1881), subsequently a Unitarian minister, invented the term &quot;&quot; in 1840.

At the start of the 1970s, &quot;The New Communes&quot; author Ron E. Roberts classified communes as a subclass of a larger category of utopias. He listed three main characteristics:

* First, egalitarianism – communes specifically rejected hierarchy or graduations of social status as being necessary to social order.
* Second, human scale – members of some communes saw the scale of society as it was then organized as being too industrialized (or factory sized) and therefore unsympathetic to human dimensions.
* Third, communes were consciously anti-bureaucratic.

Twenty-five years later, Dr. Bill Metcalf, in his edited book &quot;Shared Visions, Shared Lives&quot;, defined communes as having the following core principles:

* the importance of the group as opposed to the nuclear family unit
* a &quot;common purse&quot;
* a collective household
* group decision-making in general and intimate affairs

Sharing everyday life and facilities, a commune is an idealized form of family, being a new sort of &quot;primary group&quot; (generally with fewer than 20 people, although there are examples of much larger communes). Commune members have emotional bonds to the whole group rather than to any sub-group, and the commune is experienced with emotions that go beyond just social collectivity.

With the simple definition of a commune as an intentional community with 100% income sharing, the online directory of the Fellowship for Intentional Community (FIC) lists 222 communes worldwide (28 January 2019). Some of these are religious institutions such as abbeys and monasteries. Others are based in anthroposophic philosophy, including Camphill villages that provide support for the education, employment, and daily lives of adults and children with developmental disabilities, mental health problems or other special needs.

Many cultures naturally practice communal or tribal living, and would not designate their way of life as a planned &quot;commune&quot; per se, though their living situation may have many characteristics of a commune.

== By region ==
=== Australia ===
In Australia, many intentional communities started with the hippie movement and those searching for social alternatives to the nuclear family. One of the oldest continuously running communities is called &quot;Moora Moora Co-operative Community&quot; with about 47 members (Oct 2021). Located at the top of Mount Toolebewong, 65 km east of Melbourne, Victoria at an altitude of 600–800 m, this community has been entirely off the electricity grid since its inception in 1974. Founding members still resident include Peter and Sandra Cock.

=== Germany ===
The first wave of utopian communities in Germany began during a period of rapid urbanization between 1890 and 1930. About 100 intentional communities were started but data is unreliable. They often pursued nudism, vegetarian and organic agriculture, as well as various religious and political ideologies like anabaptism, theosophy, anarchism, socialism and eugenics. Historically, German emigrants were also influential in the creation of intentional communities in other countries, like the Bruderhof in the United States of America and Kibbutzim in Israel.
In the 1960s, there was a resurgence of communities calling themselves communes, starting with the Kommune 1 in Berlin, without knowledge of or influence by previous movements.
A large number of contemporary intentional communities define themselves as communes, and there is a network of political communes called &quot;Kommuja&quot; with about 40 member groups (May 2023).

In the German commune book, , communes are defined by Elisabeth Voß as communities which:
* Live and work together
* Have a communal economy, i.e., common finances and common property (land, buildings, means of production)
* Have communal decision making – usually consensus decision making
* Try to reduce hierarchy and hierarchical structures
* Have communalization of housework, childcare and other communal tasks
* Have equality between women and men
* Have low ecological footprints through sharing and saving resources

=== Israel ===
Kibbutzim in Israel, (sing., kibbutz) are examples of officially organized communes, the first of which were based on agriculture. Other Israeli communities are Kvutza, Yishuv Kehilati, Moshavim and Kfar No&#x27;ar. Today, there are dozens of urban communes growing in the cities of Israel, often called urban kibbutzim. The urban kibbutzim are smaller and more anarchist. Most of the urban communes in Israel emphasize social change, education, and local involvement in the cities where they live. Some of the urban communes have members who are graduates of zionist-socialist youth movements, like HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed, HaMahanot HaOlim and Hashomer Hatsair.

=== Ireland ===
In 1831 John Vandeleur (a landlord) established a commune on his Ralahine Estate at Newmarket-on-Fergus, County Clare. Vandeleur asked Edward Thomas Craig, an English socialist, to formulate rules and regulations for the commune. It was set up with a population of 22 adult single men, 7 married women and their 7 husbands, 5 single women, 4 orphan boys and 5 children under the age of 9 years. No money was employed, only credit notes which could be used in the commune shop. All occupants were committed to a life with no alcohol, tobacco, snuff or gambling. All were required to work for 12 hours a day during the summer and from dawn to dusk in winter. The social experiment prospered for a time and 29 new members joined. However, in 1833 the experiment collapsed due to the gambling debts of John Vandeleur. The members of the commune met for the last time on 23 November 1833 and placed on record a declaration of &quot;the contentment, peace and happiness they had experienced for two years under the arrangements introduced by Mr. Vandeleur and Mr. Craig and which through no fault of the Association was now at an end&quot;.

=== Russia ===
In imperial Russia, the vast majority of Russian peasants held their land in communal ownership within a &quot;mir&quot; community, which acted as a village government and a cooperative. The very widespread and influential pre-Soviet Russian tradition of monastic communities of both sexes could also be considered a form of communal living. After the end of communism in Russia, monastic communities have again become more common, populous and, to a lesser degree, more influential in Russian society. Various patterns of Russian behavior — (толока), (помочи), (артель) — are also based on communal (&quot;мирские&quot;) traditions.

In the years immediately following the revolutions of 1917 Tolstoyan communities proliferated in Russia, but later they were eventually wiped out or stripped of their independence as collectivisation and ideological purges got under way in the late 1920s. Colonies, such as the Life and Labor Commune, relocated to Siberia to avoid being liquidated. Several Tolstoyan leaders, including Yakov Dragunovsky (1886-1937), were put on trial and then sent to the Gulag prison camps.

=== South Africa ===
In 1991, Afrikaners in South Africa founded the controversial Afrikaner-only town of Orania, with the goal of creating a stronghold for the Afrikaner minority group, the Afrikaans language and the Afrikaner culture. By 2022, the population was 2,500. The town was experiencing rapid growth and the population had climbed by 55% from 2018. They favour a model of strict Afrikaner self-sufficiency and have their own currency, bank, local government and only employ Afrikaners.

=== United Kingdom ===

A 19th century advocate and practitioner of communal living was the utopian socialist John Goodwyn Barmby, who founded a Communist Church before becoming a Unitarian minister.

The Simon Community in London is an example of social cooperation, made to ease homelessness within London. It provides food and religion and is staffed by homeless people and volunteers. Mildly nomadic, they run street &quot;cafés&quot; which distribute food to their known members and to the general public.

The Bruderhof has three locations in the UK. In Glandwr, near Crymych, Pembrokeshire, a co-op called Lammas Ecovillage focuses on planning and sustainable development. Granted planning permission by the Welsh Government in 2009, it has since created 9 holdings and is a central communal hub for its community. In Scotland, the Findhorn Foundation founded by Peter and Eileen Caddy and Dorothy Maclean in 1962 is prominent for its educational centre and experimental architectural community project based at The Park, in Moray, Scotland, near the village of Findhorn.

The Findhorn Ecovillage community at The Park, Findhorn, a village in Moray, Scotland, and at Cluny Hill in Forres, now houses more than 400 people.

Historic agricultural examples include the Diggers settlement on St George&#x27;s Hill, Surrey during the English Civil War and the Clousden Hill Free Communist and Co-operative Colony near Newcastle upon Tyne during the 1890s.

=== United States ===

There is a long history of utopian communities in America that led to the rise in the communes of the hippie movement—the &quot;back-to-the-land&quot; ventures of the 1960s and 1970s. One commune that played a large role in the hippie movement was Kaliflower, a utopian living cooperative that existed in San Francisco between 1967 and 1973 built on values of free love and anti-capitalism.

Andrew Jacobs of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;after decades of contraction, the American commune movement has been expanding since the mid-1990s, spurred by the growth of settlements that seek to marry the utopian-minded commune of the 1960s with the American predilection for privacy and capital appreciation&quot;. The Fellowship for Intentional Community (FIC) is one of the main sources for listings of and more information about communes in the United States.

Although many American communes are short-lived, some have been in operation for over 50 years. The Bruderhof was established in the US in 1954, Twin Oaks in 1967 and Koinonia Farm in 1942. Twin Oaks is a rare example of a non-religious commune surviving for longer than 30 years. A newer intentional community is Synchronicity LA.

<text>In philately, errors, freaks, and oddities (EFO) collectively refer to the wide variety of mistakes that may occur during the production of postage stamps. 

Postal authorities generally take some care to ensure that mistakes do not get out of the printing plant; to be valid, the EFO stamps must have been sold to a customer. Mistakes smuggled out by employees are called printer&#x27;s waste, not recognized as legitimate stamps, and may be confiscated from collectors; the Nixon invert is a well-known recent example of an apparent new error that turned out to be simple theft by insiders. The authorities may attempt to lay hands on legitimately sold errors, as happened with the original Inverted Jenny sheet, but usually, collectors are smart enough to hang onto the windfall.

==Errors==
A postage stamp error is any of several types of failure in the stamp printing process that results in stamps not having the intended appearance. Errors include use of the wrong colors, wrong denominations, missing parts of the design, misplaced or inverted design elements, etc. The term &quot;error&quot; is typically reserved for obvious failures in the production process that (potentially) replicate over many stamps, while unique errors or poor quality are known as &quot;freaks&quot; or &quot;oddities&quot;. Printing plate flaws, such as cracks, wear, or even constant flaws, and plate repairs, such as re-entries, are also not considered errors.

Genuine errors are uncommon or even rare; postal administrations have several layers of quality control and inspection, and most printing problems are addressed before the stamps ever reach the public. A particular error may only exist in a few dozen copies, and some well-known errors, such as the Treskilling Yellow, are considered unique. They are prized by collectors, with some fetching prices thousands of times higher than the normal stamp of their type.

Errors are known at every stage of production, starting from design, to engraving, to replication of the die, to printing itself, and to perforation. In theory, gumming errors are possible, in practice used stamps have no gum, so any error would become undetectable.

The largest run of an error on a postage stamp is the 2011 United States &#x27;Forever Statue of Liberty Stamp&#x27;. The stamp shows the replica of the Statue of Liberty in Las Vegas rather than the original Statue of Liberty in New York. The stamp was released in December 2010 and the error was not noticed until March 2011. The error was identified by Sunipix, a stock photo agency in Texas. Ten and a half billion of the error stamps were produced.

Collectors understand that a minor error in one stamp catalog might not be considered an error at all in another catalog. Additionally, no definitions of the terms freaks and oddities are universally accepted within the EFO community. John Hotchner has authored many respected articles about this subject that provide clarity.

The following is a list of the major types of errors.
* Design error: The picture may be of the wrong subject, maps may show wrong borders, the inscription may be factually wrong, text may be misspelled, etc.
* Value error or &quot;substituted subject&quot;: A die composed of multiple elements has the wrong elements mixed together, as for instance a low-value denomination being used on a design intended only for high values.
* Omission error: Part of the stamp&#x27;s design is missing.
** Missing color: Associated with printing processes which print the stamp in several different colors.
** Missing overprint: A stamp valid for postage only when overprinted but with a missing overprint.
* Double impression: Stamp, or overprint, was printed twice, one impression offset from the other.
* Invert error: Part of the stamp is printed upside-down.
** Inverted overprint: The overprint on the stamp is printed upside-down.
* Color error: Stamp is printed in the wrong color(s).
* Paper error: Stamp is printed on the wrong type of paper which, e.g., may have a different watermark or color than intended.
* Perforation error: Perforations are missing on one or several sides or put in the wrong place (e.g. diagonally). As perforations may be removed by cutting them off, imperforate errors are collected in pairs.

==Freaks==
A &quot;freak&quot; is a one-time mishap in the production process. Freaks include paper folds resulting in half-printed half-blank stamps, &quot;crazy perfs&quot; running diagonally across stamps, and insects embedded in stamps, underneath the ink.

==Oddities==
An &quot;oddity&quot; is something that is within the bounds of usability for the stamp, but still has a distinctive appearance. The usual sort of oddity is misregistration on a multi-colored stamp, which can result in shirts apparently with two sets of buttons, eyes above the top of a person&#x27;s head, and so forth. These can be extremely common. The Canadian Christmas stamp of 1898, depicting a map of the world with British possessions in red, is famous for unusual color oddities that appear to claim all of Europe, or the United States, or central Asia for Britain.

<text>William Millar (4 July 1931 – 2 June 1977), better known by his stage name Stephen Boyd, was an actor from Northern Ireland. He emerged as a leading man during the late 1950s with his role as the villainous Messala in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), a role that earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. He received his second Golden Globe nomination for the musical &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Jumbo&quot; (1962).

Boyd also appeared, sometimes as a hero and sometimes as a malefactor, in the major big-screen productions &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot; (1956), &quot;The Night Heaven Fell&quot; (1958), &quot;The Bravados&quot; (1958), &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (1964), &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; (1965), &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (1966), &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning...&quot; (also 1966) and &quot;Shalako&quot; (1968).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Stephen Boyd was born on 4 July 1931 in Whitehouse, County Antrim. He was the youngest of nine children born to Scots-Irish Canadian parents, James Alexander Millar and his wife Martha Boyd. At a very early age, William, or Billy as he was known, moved with the family to live in Glengormley. Boyd was raised Presbyterian and attended the local primary school and Ballyclare High School.

At the age of 14, Boyd quit school to work and earn money to help support his family. He eventually joined the Ulster Group Theatre, where he learned the behind-the-scenes tasks of the theatre. He became well known in Belfast for his contributions as a gravel-voiced policeman on the Ulster Radio programme &quot;The McCooeys&quot;, the story of a Belfast family written by Joseph Tomelty.

Boyd eventually worked his way up to character parts and then starring roles. By nineteen he had toured Canada with summer stock companies. In 1950, he made a coast-to-coast tour of America with the Clare Tree Major Company, performing &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; in the lead role as Stanley Kowalski. Boyd later recalled this as &quot;the best performance I ever gave in my life&quot;.

By the time he was 20, Boyd had a wide range of theatre experience, but he longed for the big stage. In 1952, he moved to London and worked in a cafeteria and busked outside a cinema in Leicester Square to get money as he was literally close to starvation. Boyd caught his first break as a doorman at the Odeon Theatre.

The Leicester Square Cinema across the street recruited him to usher attendees during the British Academy Awards in the early 1950s. During the awards ceremony, he was noticed by actor Sir Michael Redgrave, who used his connections to introduce Boyd to the director of the Windsor Repertory Group. At this point, Boyd&#x27;s stage career in the U.K. began to flourish with performances in &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; and &quot;Barnett&#x27;s Folly&quot;.

===Early roles===
Boyd&#x27;s first role that brought him acclaim was as a pro-Nazi Irish spy in the movie &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot;, based on the book by Ewen Montagu. The movie was released in April 1956.

Shortly thereafter, he signed a ten-year contract with 20th Century Fox studios, who began prepping him for Hollywood, but it was a while until Boyd actually set foot on a Hollywood back-lot. Boyd&#x27;s next stop was Portugal, where he acted in &quot;A Hill in Korea&quot;, which also featured future stars Michael Caine and Robert Shaw. In June 1956, Boyd was cast in the nautical, ship-wreck adventure &quot;Abandon Ship!&quot; for Columbia Studios starring Tyrone Power. This was filmed in the summer of 1956 in London, where the British Navy built a huge 35,000-gallon water tank for the movie.

In November 1956, for Twentieth Century Fox, Boyd traveled to the British West Indies as part of a large ensemble cast in Darryl Zanuck&#x27;s racially provocative film &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; starring Dorothy Dandridge, based on the Alec Waugh novel. Boyd portrayed a young English aristocrat who becomes the lover of Joan Collins. Boyd was loaned out to the J. Arthur Rank production of &quot;Seven Thunders (Beast of Marseilles)&quot;, a World War II romance set in Nazi-occupied Marseilles. This movie was filmed on location in Marseilles and at Pinewood Studios in London in the spring of 1957 and featured Boyd in his most prominent starring film role yet.

Around the same time, French actress Brigitte Bardot was given the opportunity to cast her own leading man in her next movie after her success in Roger Vadim&#x27;s &quot;And God Created Woman&quot;, and she chose Boyd. From August to October 1957, Bardot, Boyd, and Alida Valli filmed the lusty romance &quot;The Night Heaven Fell&quot;, directed by Roger Vadim in Paris and in the region of Málaga, Spain, specifically the small, white-washed town of Mijas. Being in the Bardot spotlight added much to Boyd&#x27;s film credit, in addition to bringing him notice in Hollywood.

Boyd finally arrived in Hollywood in January 1958 to take on his first true Hollywood role as the leader of a quartet of renegade outlaws in the Twentieth Century Fox western &quot;The Bravados&quot;, which starred Gregory Peck and Joan Collins. Even though this was a Hollywood production, the actual filming took place in Morelia, Mexico.

===&quot;Ben-Hur&quot;===
After the filming of &quot;The Bravados&quot; was complete in late March 1958, Stephen Boyd returned to Hollywood to audition for the coveted role of Messala in MGM&#x27;s upcoming epic &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. Many other actors, including Victor Mature, Kirk Douglas, Leslie Nielsen and Stewart Granger had been considered for the part, but Boyd&#x27;s screen test convinced director William Wyler that he had found the perfect villain for his epic. Wyler had also admired Boyd&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot; the previous year. Boyd was hurried off to join lead actor Charlton Heston in Rome in May 1958 to learn the chariot racing aspect of his role. Heston had already been practicing behind the chariot for weeks, so Boyd needed to learn quickly. Boyd was also required to wear brown contact lenses as Messala, which irritated his eyes and caused vision problems for a few months after the movie was completed. Despite this, Boyd described the filming experience of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (which took place in Cinecittà Studios in Rome), as the most exciting experience of his life.

Years after the movie was released, interim &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; screenwriter and novelist Gore Vidal revealed that Boyd had portrayed his famous character Messala in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; with an underlying homosexual energy, as instructed to by Vidal when he greets Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) in the opening sequence. In Gore Vidal&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Palimpsest: A Memoir&quot; Vidal describes his discussion first with director Wyler, concerning Messala&#x27;s underlying motivation, namely that Messala and Judah Ben-Hur had previously been lovers. This was based on an idea by Vidal to enhance the tension between the two main antagonists. Wyler specifically told Vidal, &quot;You talk to Boyd. But don&#x27;t &quot;you&quot; say a word to Chuck or he&#x27;ll fall apart.&quot; In &quot;Palimpsest&quot;, Vidal said, &quot;Over the next few years, whenever we met (William Wyler), we quarreled amiably over what I had put in the scene and what Steven Boyd is clearly playing.&quot; Vidal later came into conflict with actor Charlton Heston about his version of the Messala/Ben-Hur relationship and the implications surrounding &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;.

After the filming of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; was completed Boyd returned to Hollywood in early 1959 to star with Academy Award winner Susan Hayward in the Canadian-based drama &quot;Woman Obsessed&quot;. Some advertisements for this movie labeled Boyd as &quot;The Young New Clark Gable.&quot; He was then part of another excellent ensemble cast in the adaptation of Rona Jaffe&#x27;s novel &quot;The Best of Everything&quot;, filmed in May and June 1959 at Fox Studios in Hollywood and on location in New York City.

&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; was released in November 1959 and immediately made Boyd an international star. His portrayal of the Roman tribune Messala brought in rave reviews. Press columnist Erskine Johnson wrote, &quot;A brass hat and the armor of a Roman warrior in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; does for Stephen Boyd what a tight dress does for Marilyn Monroe.&quot; Ruth Waterbury, in her Boyd feature in the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, described Boyd&#x27;s character as &quot;the dangerously masculine and quite magnificent Messala.&quot; &quot;Modern Screen&quot; magazine in 1960 stated that Boyd&#x27;s ruthless Messala had &quot;lost the chariot race but captured the sympathy and sex appeal of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;.&quot;

===1960s===
Boyd was featured in the popular TV program &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on 3 February 1960, which featured many of Boyd&#x27;s family members and acquaintances (including Michael Redgrave) telling stories about his early life and film career. This should be some indication of how &quot;Stephen Boyd fever&quot; was catching. Newspaper columnists were getting swarmed with letters from female fans of all ages wanting to know more about Boyd. He was being sent dozens of starring roles, most of which he had to turn down due to other obligations. He opted out of the biblical epic &quot;The Story of Ruth&quot;, which didn&#x27;t please Fox studios, and he was one of the front-runners to star with Marilyn Monroe in her picture &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Love&quot;.

In early 1960, Boyd won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture for his performance in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. In January 1960, Boyd made a guest appearance alongside the silent-era &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; stars Ramon Novarro and Francis X. Bushman on Hedda Hopper&#x27;s special television programme &quot;Hedda Hopper&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;. In February 1960, he starred in the Playhouse 90 television performance called &quot;The Sound of Trumpets&quot; with Dolores Hart, which garnered good reviews. He also appeared as a singing guest on The Dinah Shore Chevy Show on 13 March 1960 where he performed two Irish folk songs with Dinah Shore, &quot;The Leprechaun Song&quot; and &quot;Molly Malone&quot;, and an Irish step dance.

Boyd chose to do roles in which he felt comfortable. His next choice was &quot;The Big Gamble&quot;, which featured Darryl F. Zanuck&#x27;s current paramour and French icon Juliette Gréco. It was filmed on the Ivory Coast of West Africa, Dublin and the southern part of France in the spring and summer of 1961. The adventure of making this film almost outdid the adventure in the film itself - - the crew slept in tents in the jungle that were guarded by natives on parole for cannibalism. Boyd nearly drowned in the Ardèche river during the making of the film. Luckily he was saved by his co-star and excellent swimmer David Wayne. Boyd spoke about this incident during his appearance on the popular TV programme &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; which aired on 11 December 1960.

Boyd was originally chosen to play Mark Antony opposite Elizabeth Taylor in 20th Century Fox&#x27;s epic production of &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963) under the direction of Rouben Mamoulian. He began film work in September 1960 but eventually withdrew from the problem-plagued production after Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s severe illness postponed the film for months. (&quot;Cleopatra&quot; was later directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and the role of Mark Antony went to Richard Burton.) During this period of waiting in April 1961 Stephen Boyd was sent to Cairo, Egypt on a publicity tour by Twentieth Century Fox along with fellow actors Julie Newmar and Barbara Eden to attend the inaugural ceremony of the sound and light show at the pyramids of Giza.

After several months without active work, Boyd was thrilled to finally get his first post-Cleopatra role. The film was &quot;The Inspector&quot;, re-titled &quot;Lisa&quot; for the American release. It was based on the novel by Jan de Hartog and co-starred actress Dolores Hart. The film was made in Amsterdam, London and Wales during the summer of 1961. On 9 January 1962, Boyd was featured in a television film from General Electric Theater called &quot;The Wall Between&quot;, co-starring Ronald Reagan and Gloria Talbott. Next, Boyd was again loaned out to MGM Studios to star with Doris Day in the circus musical &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Jumbo&quot;, filmed during the early part of 1962; the role earned Boyd a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.

Boyd flew to Rome in the summer of 1962 to act with Italian superstar Gina Lollobrigida in her long-time pet project &quot;Imperial Venus&quot;, a romantic epic about the many loves of Pauline Bonaparte, the sister of Napoleon. This film was the first film to be banned by the Motion Picture Association of America for male nudity. Boyd appeared in a humorous bedroom scene, naked with only his lower half covered by a bed-sheet. The suggestion of nudity was too much for the censors and the movie was never released in the United States. Boyd returned to the States briefly after finishing &quot;Imperial Venus&quot;, where he appeared for the second time on The Dinah Shore Chevy Show, which aired on 11 November 1962. For this program Boyd was a last-minute replacement for actor James Garner and joined Shore and entertainer Dean Martin for a few musical numbers.

Boyd arrived in Spain in early 1963 to begin work on Samuel Bronston&#x27;s massive production of &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, directed by Anthony Mann. This was filmed during a severely cold winter in Europe and the production in the Sierra de Guadarrama of Spain encountered several challenges with the snow. Boyd&#x27;s co-star was another Italian legend, Sophia Loren. Boyd also had the opportunity to ride another chariot in this film. Although the movie did well internationally when it was released in April 1964, it was a box office failure in the United States and signaled the end of Roman epics in the 1960s. More appreciated with the passing of time, &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; was also recognized by critics as being a major inspiration for Ridley Scott&#x27;s Academy Award-winning movie &quot;Gladiator.&quot;

Boyd flew back to Hollywood in the summer to star in a &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot; episode with Louis Jourdan called &quot;War of Nerves&quot;, which aired on 3 January 1964. He then returned to Europe to film the suspenseful &quot;The Third Secret&quot; starring Pamela Franklin, Richard Attenborough, Jack Hawkins
and Diane Cilento.

On 23 December 1963, Stephen Boyd became a naturalized U.S. citizen during a ceremony at the Federal Building in Los Angeles, California.

Stephen Boyd was originally cast as the lead in Anthony Mann&#x27;s World War II drama &quot;The Unknown Battle&quot;, which was set to film in early 1964 with co-stars Elke Sommer and Anthony Perkins in Norway. After several weeks of waiting, studio funding for the project fell through. Boyd sued Mann for $500,000 for a breach of contract, missed time and other lost film opportunities. The project was completed by Mann a year later and released as &quot;Heroes of Telemark&quot; with Kirk Douglas replacing Boyd as the lead.

In 1964, Boyd continued to make films in Europe, traveling to Yugoslavia to star as the villain Jamuga in the epic &quot;Genghis Khan&quot;. Boyd was the top billed and therefore the top paid star in the epic, and this apparently caused friction with up-and-coming star Omar Sharif. After completing &quot;Genghis Khan&quot;, Boyd trekked to Cairo, Egypt for a brief appearance as the regal King Nimrod at The Tower of Babel in Dino de Laurentiis&#x27;s production of &quot;The Bible&quot;, directed by John Huston.

After all this globe-trotting, the travel-weary Boyd was very happy to return to the United States to start work on the Twentieth Century Fox science fiction adventure &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;. This was filmed in the early part of 1965. In the summer of 1965, Boyd joined German star Elke Sommer and music legend Tony Bennett to film the Hollywood drama &quot;The Oscar&quot;, based on the eponymous Richard Sale novel. The movie was a popular success, but maligned by film critics. Boyd made a 10-day visit to Iran in December 1965 to film his scenes for the United Nations film project &quot;The Poppy Is Also a Flower&quot;, written by James Bond creator Ian Fleming.

In 1966, the producer of &quot;The Oscar&quot;, Joseph Levine, hired Boyd for his next film project, &quot;The Caper of the Golden Bulls&quot;, based on a William McGivern novel. This movie was partly filmed on location in Spain in the summer of 1966. The actors, including Boyd, took part in the famous Feria del Toro de San Fermin festival in Pamplona (known as the Running of the Bulls).

Also in 1966, Boyd appeared as Nimrod in John Huston&#x27;s biblical epic &quot;The Bible: In the Beginning...&quot; (which became the year&#x27;s second highest-grossing film but lost 20th Century Fox $1.5 million) and also as Charles Grant in the cult classic &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; (which is also notable for launching the career of Raquel Welch).

Next, Boyd starred in a spy thriller &quot;Assignment K&quot; with Swedish model/actress Camilla Sparv, which was filmed in Germany, Austria and London during February and March 1967. Boyd grew a full beard for his next role as the iconic Irish playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw in the Off-Broadway play called &quot;The Bashful Genius&quot; written by Harold Callen. This was Boyd&#x27;s first return to the stage since the mid-1950s, and the experience for Boyd was immensely rewarding on a personal level. He received excellent reviews for his nuanced performance of the multi-faceted Shaw. The play had a very brief run during the summer of 1967 in Denver, Philadelphia and Falmouth, Massachusetts.

In early 1968, Boyd was cast as the villain opposite Sean Connery and Brigitte Bardot in the western adventure &quot;&quot;Shalako&quot;&quot;, based on the Louis L&#x27;Amour novel. &quot;Shalako&quot; was filmed in the early part of 1968 in Almería, Spain. After returning to the United States, Boyd took the role of the cruel slave master Nathan MacKay in the Southern &quot;slavesploitation&quot; drama &quot;Slaves&quot;, also starring Ossie Davis and singer Dionne Warwick. The film was loosely based on the famous Harriet Beecher Stowe novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;. It was filmed during the summer of 1968 at the supposedly haunted Buena Vista plantation near Shreveport, Louisiana. The film was released during the volatile civil rights era and in May 1969 Boyd attended the premiere alongside Dionne Warwick in Baltimore Closely following &quot;Slaves&quot;, Boyd starred in another story about racial tension, this time a World War II made-for-television drama called &quot;Carter&#x27;s Army&quot; (or &quot;Black Brigade&quot;) which aired in August 1970, featuring a young Richard Pryor.

It was around this time that Boyd began his interest in L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s Church of Scientology, which made him one of the first Hollywood stars to be involved in it. Boyd had always expressed an interest in esoteric religions. In an interview in August 1969 with the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, Boyd explained that Scientology had helped him through the filming of &quot;Slaves&quot;, and that to him Scientology was &quot;a process used to make you capable of learning. Scientology is nothing. It means only what you want it to. It is not a church you go to pray, but a church that you go to learn. It is no good unless you apply it. It is the application.&quot; Boyd apparently had been elevated to a Scientology Status of OT 6, a position above that of Clear. Boyd starred in and narrated a Scientology recruiting movie titled &quot;Freedom&quot; in 1970. A copy of this film can be found at the Library of Congress, but it is not available online via any Scientology resource, which may indicate a falling out Boyd had with Scientology using his name for recruiting purposes. There is no documentation of his later involvement with Scientology after the early 1970s.

===1970s===
During the 1970s, the demand for Boyd in Hollywood diminished, so he focused his attention on European films and several television pilots and shows. He made three films in Spain with director José Antonio Nieves Conde, including &quot;Marta&quot; in 1970, &quot;The Great Swindle&quot; in 1971, and &quot;Casa Manchada&quot; in 1975. He worked with cult director Romain Gary in the drug thriller &quot;Kill!&quot; in 1971. He also made several Westerns, including &quot;Hannie Caulder&quot; with Raquel Welch in 1971, &quot;The Man Called Noon&quot; in 1973, &quot;Those Dirty Dogs&quot; in 1973, and &quot;&quot; in 1976. Boyd continued to travel to a wide variety of locations to work, including Australia for &quot;The Hands of Cormac Joyce&quot; in 1972, South Africa for &quot;Control Factor&quot; and &quot;The Manipulator&quot; in 1972–1973, Jamaica for the scuba diving adventure &quot;The Treasure of Jamaica Reef&quot; in 1972, Florida for the television pilot &quot;Key West&quot; in 1973, and Hawaii in his last acting stint as a guest star on the popular television show &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; in 1977. The episode &quot;Up the Rebels&quot; was the premiere episode of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;″s tenth season, and it aired after Boyd&#x27;s death on 15 September 1977. His most critically acclaimed role during the 1970s was as a colourful Irish gangster in the UK crime thriller &quot;The Squeeze&quot; in 1977.

A letter from film producer Euan Lloyd (who produced such films as &quot;Shalako&quot;, &quot;The Man Called Noon&quot; and &quot;The Wild Geese&quot;), states that &quot;Stephen Boyd was one of the nicest, kindest people I have met in my lifetime, rare in this profession.&quot;

Although Boyd spent most of his adult life traveling abroad for film work, he made his permanent home in southern California. At one point in the 1960s, he had three homes there — one above the Sunset Strip, one in Tarzana and another in Palm Springs, where he enjoyed his favorite pastime, golf.

==Personal life==
&quot;Silver Screen&quot; Magazine in 1960 wrote this about Boyd:

Journalist Florabel Muir described Boyd&#x27;s appeal in a feature from 1966. &quot;I would think it has to be his ruggedly masculine good looks. Strong, even craggy features, a wide sympathetic mouth, firm chin, athletic build, wavy dark brown hair, roving 185-lb. frame – all that plus a musical voice and the savoir faire of a much-traveled fellow – his films have taken him to many places in the world, and a rolling stone acquires a high polish.&quot;

Boyd was popular with Hollywood columnists, including his friend Hedda Hopper, as well as fellow actors and other members of the entertainment industry because of his charm and sense of humor. &quot;Boyd is the kind of a man who was born to make friends and he has been doing it most of his life...Boyd is a blue-eyed, curly-haired chunk of masculinity, who makes no attempt to hide the fact that he just plain likes people. On the set of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; he rarely occupied the fancy portable dressing room set aside for his use. Instead, he spent his time between scenes sitting around and chatting with electricians, carpenters and his fellow actors. He will discuss any subject and enjoys a good argument. He can, like most Irishmen, sprinkle his talk with wit as well as sagacity.&quot;

He was first married in 1958 to Italian-born MCA executive Mariella Di Sarzana during the filming of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. They separated after just three weeks. Concerning his short-lived marriage to Sarzana, Boyd explained: &quot;It was my fault. I&#x27;m an Irish so-and-so when I&#x27;m working. I hadn&#x27;t been married a week when we both knew we had made a mistake. She is a nice girl but we were just not meant for each other. I suppose I wasn&#x27;t ready for marriage. Maybe I was still too much of an adolescent.&quot; They officially divorced in early 1959. After his divorce Boyd lived as a bachelor for most of his life, dating several prominent Hollywood starlets throughout the 1960s. His secretary Elizabeth Mills was a permanent resident at his Tarzana home during these years, though the two did not marry until 1974.

He had a deep and lasting friendship with actress and French icon Brigitte Bardot with whom he starred in two movies – &quot;The Night Heaven Fell&quot; (&quot;Les bijoutiers du clair de lun&quot;e) in 1958 and &quot;Shalako&quot; in 1968. During the filming of &quot;Shalako&quot; in Almería, Spain, Bardot and Boyd&#x27;s close relationship and open affection for each other sparked numerous rumors of a possible affair. It even caused Brigitte&#x27;s husband at the time, Gunter Sachs, to ask for a divorce. In Bardot&#x27;s autobiography, she described the events and states that Boyd &quot;was never her lover, but a tender and attentive friend.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Photoplay Film&quot; in 1968, Boyd said, &quot;Bardot is always Bardot. She&#x27;s marvelous. She&#x27;s an enormous star and she&#x27;s a unique, marvelous woman. I adore her.&quot; Even though both actors denied the affair, the press was &quot;convinced there was a romance afoot, that Brigitte and Boyd openly displayed their affection for each other, but that publication of the report on their romance cooled it.&quot;
Boyd also had a close relationship with actress Dolores Hart who describes what was her only romance with a co-star in her autobiography &quot;The Ear of the Heart&quot;. Boyd eventually rejected her advances, but they remained close friends even after she turned to the cloistered life of a nun in 1963. He visited her in 1966 at the Abbey of Regina Laudis in Connecticut and remained in communication with her until the early 1970s.

Stephen Boyd&#x27;s most passionate affair seems to have been with Austrian actress Marisa Mell. They met while filming the movie &quot;Marta&quot; in 1970. Boyd initially dodged Marisa Mell&#x27;s amorous advances, but during the second film they made together, &quot;The Great Swindle&quot;, the two became inseparable lovers. They married in a gypsy camp on the outskirts of Madrid in late 1971. The ceremony included a wrist cutting exchange of blood to seal their bond. The marriage was not considered legal, but Marisa Mell said, &quot;Who cares? In our minds it will be real.&quot; According to Marisa Mell, their affair was so intense that while living in Rome they made a trip to the Italian town of Sarsina for a ritual exorcism at the Cathedral of St. Vicinius. Boyd abruptly broke off the affair after the intensity apparently became too much to bear. In early 1972, after Boyd&#x27;s departure, Mell had this to say about the break-up of their relationship: &quot;We both believe in reincarnation, and we realized we&#x27;ve already been lovers in three different lifetimes, and in each one I made him suffer terribly.&quot; For her part, Mell fondly remembered Boyd many years later in her autobiography &quot;Cover Love&quot; from 1990, dedicating a chapter to their affair.

Boyd&#x27;s last marriage took place in 1974 to Elizabeth Mills, a secretary at the British Arts Council, whom he had known since 1953. Mills followed Boyd to the United States in the late 1950s and was his personal assistant, friend and confidante for many years before marrying him in the mid-1970s.

===Views on Northern Ireland===
In a 1959 interview with gossip columnist Louella Parsons for the &quot;Lincoln Journal Star&quot;, Boyd made the following statement:

Boyd made this comment in the context of discussing his friendship with actress and fellow Belfast native Siobhán McKenna, herself an Irish nationalist. In the interview, &quot;He went on to say that although he is no Catholic, Siobhan [&quot;sic&quot;] is, and, in fact, that 66% of those who live in Belfast are Irish Catholics.&quot;

Boyd&#x27;s comments provoked anger from some Scotch-Irish Americans with British unionist sympathies. In response, Boyd wrote a letter to the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; in which he clarified his remarks:

In a 1969 interview for &quot;The Journal News&quot;, Boyd assessed the then current political tensions in Northern Ireland:

After emigrating to the United States, Boyd made frequent trips back to his native Belfast to visit his family. On one particular visit in 1971, he exclaimed his dismay about what he described as:

Boyd was valued so highly by his native city that during his visits he was always given a military escort from the airport to his home for security reasons during the Troubles.

==Death==
Boyd died of a massive heart attack on 2 June 1977 at the age of 45 while playing golf with his wife, Elizabeth Mills, at the Porter Valley Country Club in Northridge, California. He was in talks to play the role of the Regimental Sergeant Major in Euan Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; before his death.

He was cremated and his ashes were interred in Oakwood Memorial Park Cemetery in Chatsworth, California. His wife Elizabeth Mills Boyd was interred with him at the time of her death in 2007. He is also remembered on his parents&#x27; grave in the Clandeboye Cemetery, Bangor, Northern Ireland.

==Legacy==
On 4 July 2018, the Ulster History Circle, a voluntary organisation which erects plaques across the province of Ulster to celebrate people of achievement, commemorated Stephen Boyd with a blue plaque close to his birthplace at &#x27;Moygara&#x27;, Shore Road, Whitehouse (Newtownabbey, Northern Ireland).

<doc id="427187" wikidata="Q12060804" url="?curid=427187" title="Isle de France (Mauritius)">
<text>Isle de France (, ) was a French colony in the Indian Ocean from 1715 to 1810, comprising the island now known as Mauritius and its dependent territories. It was governed by the French East India Company and formed part of the French colonial empire. Under the French, the island witnessed major changes. The increasing importance of agriculture led to the &quot;import&quot; of slaves and the undertaking of vast infrastructural works that transformed the capital Port Louis into a major port, warehousing, and commercial centre.

During the Napoleonic Wars, Isle de France became a base from which the French navy, including squadrons under Rear Admiral Linois or Commodore Jacques Hamelin, and corsairs such as Robert Surcouf, organised raids on British merchant ships. The raids (see Battle of Pulo Aura and Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811) continued until 1810 when the British sent a strong expedition to capture the island. The first British attempt, in August 1810, to attack Grand Port resulted in a French victory, one celebrated on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. A subsequent and much larger attack launched in December of the same year from Rodrigues, which had been captured a year earlier, was successful. The British landed in large numbers in the north of the island and rapidly overpowered the French, who capitulated (see Invasion of Isle de France). In the Treaty of Paris (1814), the French ceded Isle de France together with its territories including Agaléga, the Cargados Carajos Shoals, the Chagos Archipelago, Rodrigues, Seychelles, and Tromelin Island to the United Kingdom. The island then reverted to its former name, &#x27;Mauritius&#x27;.

== History ==

After the Dutch had abandoned Mauritius, the island became a French colony in September 1715 when Guillaume Dufresne d&#x27;Arsel landed and took possession of it, naming the island &quot;Isle de France&quot;. The French government turned over the administration of Mauritius to the French East India Company, but the island remained free of Europeans until 1721. Furthermore, until 1735, Isle de France was administered from Île Bourbon, now known as Réunion.

By 1726, the company had made land grants to colonists, soldiers and workers. The grants&#x27; covenants specified that recipients of the grants who could not cultivate their land for a period of 3 years would lose them. Each colonist was given 20 slaves and in return had to pay yearly one tenth of their production to the French East India Company. The attempt to develop agriculture resulted in an increasing demand for labour.

According to Lougnon, 156 ships called at Mauritius between 1721 and 1735, prior to the arrival of Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais, most of them being Company ships. Slave traders brought a total of 650 slaves to Mauritius from Madagascar, Mozambique, India and West Africa.

International trade, in particular long-distance trade, grew in the 18th century and by the 1780s, France was the largest trading maritime power in Europe. The total value of French long-distance trade with Africa, Asia, America and re-exports to the rest of Europe was £25 million, whereas Britain&#x27;s trade amounted to only £20 million. This state of affairs explained the growing importance of Port Louis as a centre of entrepôt trade. Among the French colonists, the lure of easy money and the importance of commercial activities contributed to their lack of interest in agriculture. Slave trade, both legal and illegal, was an important aspect of the French international trade in the Indian Ocean. A class of traders and merchants developed and thrived.

Governor Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen, suspicious of the English ship which called in there to effect repairs in 1803, imprisoned its captain Matthew Flinders on the island for several years. Flinders was returning to England from Australia with the logbooks and records of his scientific explorations.

== Population ==
When La Bourdonnais arrived in Isle de France in 1735, there were 638 slaves in a population of 838 inhabitants. Thereafter, some 1,200 to 1,300 slaves arrived annually; within five years the number of slaves had quadrupled to 2,612 and the number of French had doubled. The population started to rise as more slaves were brought and more inhabitants came.

== Legacy ==
Mahé de La Bourdonnais established Port Louis as a naval base and a shipbuilding centre. Under his governorship, numerous buildings were built, a number of which are still standing today, these include part of Government House, the Château de Mon Plaisir at SSR Botanical Garden, and the Line Barracks.

<text>Ballyclare () is a small town in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It had a population of 10,850 according to the 2021 census, and is located within the Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council area. It is part of, and the principal settlement in the Ballyclare District Electoral Area.

It sits on the river Six Mile Water. The town probably owes its origins to its being a crossing point of the river, the strategic importance of which is shown by existence of a small Norman motte on the south side of the river and presently located in the War Memorial Park. The broad main street dates from the 17th century. In the centre of the town is the Market Square with the Town Hall. The town grew in the 19th century with the coming of the railway and it became an important industrial town with a large paper mill in the South West of the town and a large Linen Bleach Green. These factories gave their names to the roads leading to them, the Mill Road and the Green Road, but have been closed for some time. It is now a local service centre with a significant dormitory role in relation to Belfast. It is the main focus within the rural area for shopping, education and recreation. To the north is the remnant of Craig Hill, which once provided a wooded backdrop but is now covered with modern housing. Much of the Craig Hill has been quarried for its basalt.

== History ==
People have lived in Ballyclare for six thousand years. The earliest evidence of people in this area is a hoard of flint arrow heads found when houses were being built north of the river in November 1968. There were a total of thirty-nine flints discovered – some perfectly finished and others are blank indicating an &#x27;industry&#x27; and trading here near the river crossing over four thousand years ago.

When the Normans built the castle at Carrickfergus they placed a line of outposts along the river which was then called the &quot;Ollar&quot; – River of the Rushes. In time the soldiers making the journey from Carrickfergus to Antrim reached the river at this spot when they had travelled six miles so began to call the Ollar the Six Mile Water. One of these mottes is close by the river in the War Memorial Park in Ballyclare. There are two on opposite sides of the river at Doagh and one at Antrim. The village grew after the Plantation of Ulster and was granted permission by King George II in 1756 to hold two fairs each year making it an important market centre.

At the same time as the Pilgrim Fathers landed in what is now the United States, Ballyclare was settled by Scots planters. Jonathan Swift preached in Ballyclare and it was from the town that the families of Mark Twain, Sam Houston and General Alexander Macomb left for America. The people of Ballyclare and the surrounding villages played a part in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and fought in the Battle of Antrim. At the beginning of the 20th century Ballyclare was a growing industrial town with an urban district council and became the largest paper producer in Ireland.

As part of the 1947 Grand Prix season, which constituted the first full season of the FIA&#x27;s Formula One motor racing, the 1947 Ulster Trophy race took place at Ballyclare.

==Climate==
== Demography ==
On Census day (27 March 2011) there were 9,953 people living in Ballyclare (4,039 households), accounting for 0.55% of the NI total, an increase of 13.5% on the Census 2001 population of 8,770.

Of these:
* 21.64% were aged under 16 years and 14.89% were aged 65 and over;
* 52.16% of the usually resident population were female and 47.84% were male;
* 85.72% belong to or were brought up in a &#x27;Protestant and Other Christian (including Christian related)&#x27; religion and 5.36% belong to or were brought up in the Catholic denomination;
* 77.35% indicated that they had a British national identity, 32.53% had a Northern Irish national identity and 4.45% had an Irish national identity (respondents could indicate more than one national identity);
* 37 years was the average (median) age of the population;
* 15.03% had some knowledge of Ulster-Scots and 1.91% had some knowledge of Irish (Gaelic).

The population has grown significantly over the last 40 years from 1,999 in 1971 to 8,654 in 2001 and 9,953 in 2011, an increase of 398%.

==Notable Buildings==
* Ballyclare Town Hall developed out of the old Market House which was a 3–bay, 2–storey building built about 1855. It was later extended and developed with a clock tower being added. The clock has only three faces, with no face on the western side.
* The oldest buildings in the town are the Old Presbyterian Church (established 1642) in the Main Street and its former Manse on the Mill Road ( a private dwelling since 1979), the Old Manse had experienced use as a school during the 1800s as well as having the church lawn tennis court located behind it. The Manse had been remodelled at times in its history retaining some Georgian interior detailing, mainly in the hallway. However renovations in the 1990s revealed that the stone building retains some early worked woodwork including joists dating to possibly the 17th century.
* The current Ballyclare Primary School building was originally built in 1880 and has been vigorously extended ever since. It includes three stages: the 1880 school house, the 1923s extension, the 1950s extension, the 2006 mobile classrooms addition.
There are two large Post Primary Schools, a grammar school on the Rashee Road and called Ballyclare High School, and a state Secondary School with access from the Doagh Road and Avondale Drive.

==Culture==

=== Literature ===
Archibald McIlroy&#x27;s novel &quot;When Lint Was in the Bell&quot; is a light-hearted, lightly fictionalised chronicle of life in 19th-century Ballyclare. A Ballyclare native, born c. 1860, Mr. McIlroy was lost in the sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; in 1915.

=== Music ===
Two musical ensembles have represented the town on the regional, national and international stage: the Ballyclare Male Choir since 1933, and the Ballyclare Victoria Flute Band since 1919. The Major Sinclair Memorial Pipe Band is based in the town and is regular in parades and RSPBA competitions.
The Clare Chorale is a mixed voice community based choir in Ballyclare, formed from Ballyclare High School alumni in 2003, it now boasts over 50 members drawn from a range of professions. It aims to entertain and challenge, providing a broad musical repertoire both spiritual and secular. In 2023 they will celebrate their 20th Anniversary. https://www.theclarechorale.org

===The May Fair===
The Ballyclare May Fair occurs on a Tuesday in May every year, and is part of a week of festivities. The tradition stems from a grant by King George II to hold two yearly fairs, although only the May Fair now survives. The event began as a local horse fair, but representatives of cavalry regiments came from all over Europe to buy there as the reputation of the fair spread. The fair&#x27;s heyday ended with World War I, but it is still a well-loved event in the town.

== Notable people ==
*Andy Cairns, guitarist and vocalist in the band Therapy? is from Ballyclare.
*Gareth Maybin, European Tour golfer, is from the town.
*Willie John McBride, a former Ireland and British &amp; Irish Lions rugby captain, is a resident of the town.
*Paddy McNair, a professional footballer with Middlesbrough FC and the Northern Ireland national football team, was a Ballyclare Secondary School.
*Jonathan Rea, six time world superbike champion, is a native of Ballyclare.
*Tommy Wright, a former Northern Ireland national football team goalkeeper and manager of St Johnstone and of Kilmarnock.

== Transport ==

===Road===
The road network in Ballyclare is centred on Main Street, North End and Market Square in the Town Centre. A number of roads lead into the Town Centre including the Hillhead Road from the south, the Doagh Road from the west and the Rashee, Ballyeaston and Ballycorr Roads from the north and north east. Car parking available in the town centre ranges from surface-level parking to free and paid on-street parking.

===Rail===
Ballyclare had a narrow gauge rail link to Larne and a broad gauge connection to Belfast. Neither of these have been in use since 1950. Ballyclare railway station on the narrow gauge Ballymena and Larne Railway opened on 24 August 1878, closed to passenger traffic on 1 October 1930, goods traffic on 3 June 1940 and finally altogether on 3 July 1950. The station on the broad gauge Northern Counties Committee railway line opened on 3 November 1884, closed for passenger traffic on 1 January 1938, goods traffic on 2 May 1938 and finally altogether on the same date as its narrow gauge counterpart in 1950.
The building was demolished altogether in 2004 and was replaced with a similarly shaped and styled building. The old engine shed, however, remains and is now part of Modern Tyres and is visible from the Hillhead Road.

<text>Vincennes (, ) is a commune in the Val-de-Marne department in the eastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris. Vincennes is famous for its castle: the Château de Vincennes. It is next to but does not include the Bois de Vincennes, from which it took its name, which is attached to the city of Paris.

==History==
The Marquis de Sade was imprisoned in Vincennes fortress in 1777, where he remained until February 1784 although he escaped for a little over a month in 1778. Thereafter Vincennes fortress was closed and de Sade transferred to the Bastille.

In 1821, the noted French poet, Alfred de Vigny, wrote his poem, &quot;La Prison,&quot; which details the last days of the Man in the Iron Mask at Vincennes.

The ministers of Charles X were imprisoned at the fortress of Vincennes after the July Revolution.

A test was conducted in 1849 on Claude-Étienne Minié&#x27;s invention the Minié ball which would prove successful and years later be adopted by the French army.

On the morning of 15 October 1917, famous femme fatale Mata Hari was executed for espionage by a French firing squad at Vincennes castle.

In 1929, the commune of Vincennes lost about half of its territory when the city of Paris annexed the Bois de Vincennes, a large part of which belonged to the commune of Vincennes.


Vincennes was also the site of some famous European colonial expositions in the 20th century in which fairs were held to showcase artifacts from former European colonies.

==Population==
==Sights==
The city is famous for its castle, the Château de Vincennes, and its park, the Bois de Vincennes hosting the only larger zoo in Paris, Paris Zoological Park (though these two are now within the limits of the City of Paris). It also features a large military fort, now housing various army services. This fort and an adjoining plain known as the &quot;Polygon&quot; has historically been an important proving ground for French armaments.

The city is also home to the Service Historique de la Défense (SHD), which holds the archival records of the French Armed Forces.

==Art==
In 1933 Georges Saupique was commissioned to work on one of three &quot;dessus-de-porte&quot; to be placed above the doors of the new Vincennes&#x27; city hall &quot;salle des fêtes&quot;. His composition involved allegorical figures representing commerce and industry supporting the Vincennes&#x27; coat of arms.

==Porcelain==
In the old royal château, a porcelain manufactory was established in 1740, specializing in imitations of Meissen porcelain and naturalistic flowers, which were incorporated into bouquets under the direction of Parisian &quot;marchands-merciers&quot;. The Vincennes porcelain factory continued until 1756, when the production was transferred to new buildings at Sèvres, initiating the career of world-famous Sèvres porcelain.

==Transport==
Vincennes is served by two stations on Paris Métro Line 1: Bérault and Château de Vincennes.

Vincennes is also served by Vincennes station on Paris RER line A.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Vincennes is twinned with:

* Blackrock, Ireland
* Castrop-Rauxel, Germany
* Lambeth, United Kingdom
* Montigny-le-Tilleul, Belgium
* Tomar, Portugal
* Vincennes, United States
==Education==
The commune has eight public preschools, six public elementary schools, and three private schools contracted by the state.
* Public elementary schools: Est-Passeleu, Est-Libération, Roland-Vernaudon, Sud, Ouest, Jean-Monnet
* Private elementary schools: Externat Saint-Joseph, Notre-Dame de la Providence, Ohel-Barouch

There are three public junior high schools, Collège Hector-Berlioz, Collège Saint-Exupéry, and Collège Françoise-Giroud; as well as a contracted private junior high school, Notre-Dame de la Providence.

Public senior high schools/sixth-form colleges:
* Lycée général et technologique Hector-Berlioz
* Lycée professionnel Jean-Moulin

Private senior high schools/sixth-form colleges:
*Notre-Dame de la Providence
*Lycée Grégor-Mendel
*Lycée Claude-Nicolas Ledoux

===Vincennes University===
In 1970 the &quot;University of Paris VIII&quot; was established in Vincennes as France&#x27;s first major experiment in open admissions education, as a result of the academic reforms which followed the student risings of 1968. Intended to lessen the French university system&#x27;s traditional emphasis on formal and elitist schooling, the school (generally known simply as &quot;Vincennes&quot;) admitted students without the usual entrance requirement of the &quot;baccalaureat&quot; degree and introduced courses such as the History of Cinema, Sexology, and Third World Economics. Enrollments peaked at 32,000 with more than 40% of students holding full-time jobs off the campus. However problems associated with political unrest and alleged widespread drug usage among the student body led to the resignation of the Vincennes University President and the relocation of the campus to Saint-Denis by the French Government in 1980.

==Notable people==
*Marcel Deprez (1843–1918), electrical engineer, died in Vincennes
*Alphonse Halimi, boxer
*Nicolas Pousset, ice hockey player
*Lætitia Sadier, musician
*Jules Toutain, archaeologist

<doc id="427201" wikidata="Q2020136" url="?curid=427201" title="Oliver Bulleid">
<text>Oliver Vaughan Snell Bulleid CBE (19 September 1882 – 25 April 1970) was a British railway and mechanical engineer best known as the Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the Southern Railway between 1937 and the 1948 nationalisation, developing many well-known locomotives.

== Early life and Great Northern Railway ==
He was born in Invercargill, New Zealand, to William Bulleid and his wife Marian Pugh, both British immigrants. On the death of his father in 1889, his mother returned to Llanfyllin, Wales, where the family home had been, with Bulleid. In 1901, after a technical education at Accrington Grammar School, he joined the Great Northern Railway (GNR) at Doncaster at the age of 18, as an apprentice under Henry Ivatt, the Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME). After a four-year apprenticeship, he became the assistant to the Locomotive Running Superintendent, and a year later, the Doncaster Works manager. In 1908, he left to work in Paris with the French division of Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a Test Engineer, and was soon promoted to Assistant Works Manager and Chief Draughtsman. Later that year, he married Marjorie Ivatt, Henry Ivatt&#x27;s youngest daughter.

A brief period working for the Board of Trade followed from 1910, arranging exhibitions in Brussels, Paris and Turin. He was able to travel widely in Europe, later including a trip with Nigel Gresley, William Stanier and Frederick Hawksworth, to Belgium, in 1934, to see a metre-gauge bogie locomotive. In December 1912, he rejoined the GNR as Personal Assistant to Nigel Gresley, the new CME. Gresley was only six years Bulleid&#x27;s senior. The First World War intervened; Bulleid joined the British Army and was assigned to the rail transport arm, rising to the rank of Major. After the war, Bulleid returned to the GNR as the Manager of the Wagon and Carriage Works.

== London and North Eastern Railway ==
The Grouping, in 1923, of Britain&#x27;s financially troubled railways, saw the GNR subsumed into the new London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), and Gresley was appointed the CME. He brought Bulleid back to Doncaster to be his assistant. During this period, Gresley produced the majority of his famous locomotives and innovations, and Bulleid had a hand in many of them, including the P1 2-8-2 freight locomotive, the U1 2-8-0+0-8-2 Garratt freight locomotive, the P2 2-8-2 express locomotive and the A4 4-6-2 express locomotive.

== Southern Railway and British Railways ==
In 1937, Bulleid accepted the post of CME of the Southern Railway (SR) at an annual salary of £3,000, after Richard Maunsell retired. His first contribution to the SR was to oversee the construction of three 350 hp six-wheeled diesel-electric shunters ordered by Maunsell in 1936; three were built and proved effective, with an order placed for eight more, though this was cancelled owing to the onset of the Second World War. Between 1949 and 1952, a further 26 of Bulleid&#x27;s amended version of these locomotives were delivered and later became British Rail Class 12.

In 1938, Bulleid gained approval to build the Merchant Navy class of modern 4-6-2 &quot;Pacifics&quot;, undoubtedly inspired by Gresley but also drawing on his experiences from across Europe and with all the most modern equipment: a partially welded boiler and firebox rather than traditional rivetted designs, thermic syphons and a high-pressure boiler. It also included chain-driven valve-gear immersed in an oil bath, a feature that was controversial and later caused problems if not maintained properly, which was difficult, due to conditions, after WW2.

Bulleid, like other engineers, had long felt that it was not ideal to have working parts exposed to the elements, where they were subject to all the dirt thrown up from the track. He also thought that steam engines should get nearer to the internal combustion engine, which enclosed the working parts and used pump lubrication to keep it all running smoothly. Another advantage of enclosing the valve gear would be reduced day-to-day maintenance. Unfortunately, there were design errors in the casing used for the oil bath, which led to leaks.

The first Merchant Navy, 21C1 &quot;Channel Packet&quot;, was built in 1941 and 29 followed, the last being 35030 &quot;Elder Dempster Lines&quot;. The West Country and Battle of Britain slightly smaller light Pacifics followed in 1945. 110 were built, of which 21C101 &quot;Exeter&quot; was the first. His other major steam locomotive design, the Q1 &quot;Austerity&quot; 0-6-0 freight engine, appeared in 1942. All steam locomotives designed by Bulleid for the SR had his BFB disc wheels, which gave more even tyre support. This did not eliminate the need for balance weights, but the set-up of the Bulleid valve gear enabled a locomotive with no hammer blow. When the locomotives were rebuilt with Walschaerts valve gear, balance weights were installed in the wheels to reduce hammer blow.

Bulleid played a major role in the electrification of the SR, including infrastructure, electric multiple units and electric locomotives. He designed the bodies for the two electric locomotives CC1 and CC2 in 1941 and 1945. A third example was built by British Railways in 1948 and numbered 20003. Towards the end of his tenure at the SR, he was responsible for the design and construction of Britain&#x27;s only double-deck passenger trains, the two units of the 4DD class.

His final steam locomotive design for the SR was the unconventional Leader, appearing in 1949, after nationalisation. This had the boiler, coal and water supplies and everything else encased in a smooth double-ended body reminiscent of a diesel locomotive. The drive was through two six-wheel bogies, each with three cylinders. The axles on each bogie were connected by chains. The Leader was innovative but unsuccessful; after Bulleid had left British Railways, the project was cancelled.

Bulleid also had responsibility for coaching stock, an area in which he had an active interest. SR coaches, the newest designed by Richard Maunsell, were solid but old-fashioned. Bulleid designs built on the best of the existing designs, while making improvements, and his coaches were known for their comfort and spaciousness. They were popular with the travelling public, and many of the design features such as the size and layout were used by British Railways for their standard Mark I passenger coaches.

Bulleid was briefly the CME of British Railways Southern Region. During this period, his two prototype diesel electric locomotives appeared.

== Córas Iompair Éireann ==
In February 1950, Bulleid was appointed CME of Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), the nationalised transport authority of the Republic of Ireland, having been a consulting engineer to CIÉ since 1949. He led the first major dieselisation programme, which involved the procurement of diesel multiple units from AEC of Southall (the 2600 class), 94 Crossley-engined diesel locomotives (60 CIE 001 Class and 34 CIE 201 Class) from Metropolitan-Vickers and 12 Sulzer-engined diesel locomotives (CIE 101 Class) from the Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company. This began a transformation of railway traction in Ireland, although the locomotives proved unreliable until most were re-engined.

Bulleid developed two prototype peat-burning steam locomotives, one a converted coal-fired traditional steam locomotive of 2-6-0 wheel arrangement and the other, CC1, new and fully enclosed, along the lines of the Leader design. CIÉ did not adopt peat-fired traction for widespread use.

== Recognition and retirement ==
Bulleid was elected president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers for 1946. He was also president of the Institution of Locomotive Engineers and of the Institute of Welding, and was elected to the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers.

He was appointed CBE in the 1949 New Year Honours.

Bulleid retired in 1958, moving to Belstone in Devon, then Exmouth. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Science by the University of Bath in 1967. Shortly after, he moved to Malta, where he died in 1970 aged 87.

His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; described Bulleid as &quot;the last truly original and progressive mechanical engineer of the steam locomotive era in Britain&quot;.

British Rail Class 73/1 electro-diesel locomotive No. 73128 is called &quot;O. V. S. Bulleid CBE&quot;.

<doc id="427203" wikidata="Q16970712" url="?curid=427203" title="Alternative financial services in the United States">
<text>[[Alternative financial services]] in the United States refers to a particular type of financial service, namely subprime or near-prime lending (that is, lending to people with relatively poor credit) by non-bank financial institutions. This branch of the financial services industry is more extensive in the United States than in some other countries, because the major banks in the U.S. are less willing to lend to people with marginal credit ratings than their counterparts in many other countries. Examples of these companies include Springleaf, Duvera Financial, Inc., Lendmark Financial Services, Inc., HSBC Finance, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Monterey Financial Services, Inc. The more generic name &quot;consumer finance&quot; is also used, although more properly this term applies to financing for any type of consumer.
==History==
The consumer finance industry (meaning branch-based subprime lenders) mainly came to fruition in the middle of the twentieth century. At that time, these companies were all stand-alone companies not owned by banks and an alternative to banks. However, at that time, the companies were not focused on subprime lending. Instead, they attempted to lend to everyone who would accept their high rates of interest. There were many reasons why certain people would:
*Banks made it difficult to obtain personal credit. Banks did not have the wide variety of programs or aggressive marketing that they do today.
*Many people simply didn&#x27;t like to deal with bank employees and branches, preferring the more relaxed environment of a consumer finance company.
*Consumer finance companies focused on lowering the required monthly payment for their customer&#x27;s debts. For example, a customer could refinance $10,000 worth of auto loan debt at 7 percent interest into a home equity loan at 18 percent interest. Because the auto loan would have to be paid off in 5 years while the home equity loan would have a 20-year repayment plan, the required monthly payments for the customer would be lower even though the customer would pay more over the life of the new loan.
Besides charging a higher interest rate to compensate for their risk, consumer finance companies are usually able to operate successfully because their employees are given more flexibility than banks in structuring loans and in collections. Consumer finance companies may also require far less contingent liabilities than banks.

==Consumer demographics==
Americans that use non-traditional lenders to meet short-term financial needs include almost ten million households that are unbanked or underbanked, according to a 2004 study prepared for The Fannie Mae Foundation by the Urban Institute Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center, &quot;Alternative Financial Service Providers.&quot; The study states that a vast majority of borrowers who utilize small-dollar online loans like payday loans tend to use them for regular, recurring expenses as opposed to unexpected financial emergencies. Many borrowers who take advantage of such subprime lending options tend to have low credit scores or limited credit backgrounds, and a vast majority of those who utilize alternative loans online like payday loans tend earn an annual income of $40,000 or less.

==Controversial practices==
The more-dubious consumer finance companies are known to engage in the following practices:

*Failing to tell people who ask for a loan from the lender that they really have good credit and can get a better deal somewhere else (a subprime loan is usually more expensive than a prime loan). This is one of the primary criticisms of the industry and is implied in many other&#x27;s critiques. For example, consumer finance companies have been called racist because of branches they might have opened in primarily African American areas. If their customers all had bad credit they would be working in the same way they would elsewhere, but it is implied that they are preying on the communities&#x27; lack of knowledge of lower priced alternatives.
*Sending live checks through the mail which, when used, become loans. This can trick some people, and the interest rate is usually purposely high (although disclosed).
*Charging very high fees on a mortgage refinance.
*Offering refinance deals that are worse than the previous loan, usually by showing that the new payment will be lower, but not revealing that the new payment does not include taxes and insurance.
*Selling single premium credit insurance, also financing that into the loan
*Understating interest rates by exploiting a loophole in the Truth in Lending Act of 1968 which allows auto makers to classify &quot;Finance Charges,&quot; i.e. interest, as part of the &quot;Amount Financed,&quot; thus reducing or even eliminating finance charges to create &quot;zero percent&quot; loans.

Critics also consider the concept and geographical placement of consumer finance stores as a form of &quot;redlining&quot;. This is because the sub prime lenders in poorer communities will often be the only local store, yet will be higher priced.

<text>The Wabash River () is a river that drains most of the state of Indiana, and a significant part of Illinois, in the United States. It flows from the headwaters in Ohio, near the Indiana border, then southwest across northern Indiana turning south near the Illinois border, where the southern portion forms the Indiana-Illinois border before flowing into the Ohio River.

It is the largest northern tributary of the Ohio River and third largest overall, behind the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers. From the dam near Huntington, Indiana, to its terminus at the Ohio River, the Wabash flows freely for The Tippecanoe River, White River, Embarras River and Little Wabash River are major tributaries. The river&#x27;s name comes from a Miami word meaning &quot;water over white stones&quot;, as its bottom is white limestone, now obscured by mud.

The Wabash is the state river of Indiana, and subject of the state song &quot;On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away&quot; by Paul Dresser. Two counties (in Indiana and Illinois); eight townships in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio; one Illinois precinct, one city, one town, two colleges, one high school, one canal, one former class I railroad, several bridges, and several avenues are named for the river while four US Navy warships are either named for the river or the numerous battles which took place on or near it.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Wabash&quot; is an English transliteration spelling of the French name for the river, . French traders had adopted the Miami–Illinois word for the river, , meaning &#x27;it shines white&#x27;, &#x27;pure white&#x27;, or &#x27;water over white stones&#x27;, and attempted to spell it according to their own phonetic system. The Miami name expressed the clarity of the river in Huntington County, Indiana, where the river bottom is limestone.

==Geology==

As the Laurentide Ice Sheet began to retreat from present-day Northern Indiana and Northwest Ohio between 14,000 and 15,000 years ago, it receded into three distinct lobes. The eastern or Erie Lobe sat atop and behind the Fort Wayne Moraine. Meltwater from the glacier fed into two ice-marginal streams, which became the St. Joseph and St. Marys rivers. Their combined discharge was probably the primary source of water for the proglacial Wabash River system.

As the Erie Lobe of the glacier continued to retreat, its meltwater was temporarily trapped between the ice front to the east and the Fort Wayne Moraine to the west, and formed proglacial Lake Maumee, the ancestor of modern Lake Erie. Around 11,000 years ago the waters of Lake Maumee became deep enough that it breached a &quot;sag&quot; or weak spot in the Fort Wayne Moraine. This caused a catastrophic draining of the lake, which in turn scoured a wide valley known as the Wabash-Erie Channel or &quot;sluiceway&quot;. The Little (Wabash) River flows through this channel. U.S. 24 traverses it between Fort Wayne and Huntington. The valley is the largest topographical feature in Allen County, Indiana.

When the ice melted completely from the region, new outlets for Lake Maumee&#x27;s water opened up at elevations lower than the Wabash-Erie Channel. While the St. Joseph and St. Marys Rivers continued to flow through the channel, Lake Maumee no longer did. Now a low-lying, probably marshy bit of terrain lay in between.

It is not known for certain when, but at some point in the distant past the St. Joseph and St. Marys Rivers jumped their banks and flooded the marshy ground of the Fort Wayne Outlet. The
discharge of this unusual flood was enough to cut across the outlet and come into contact
with the headwaters of the Maumee River. Once this happened, the flood waters rushed to
the east into the Maumee River, and their erosive force was enough that the new channel cut across the Fort Wayne Outlet into the Maumee River since it was at a lower elevation than
that of the sluiceway. This meant that when the flood waters receded, the sluiceway was
permanently abandoned by the two rivers. As a result of capturing them both, the Maumee was converted from a minor creek to a large river. Once again, river
waters flowed through the Fort Wayne Outlet, but now they flowed eastward, toward
Lake Erie, instead of westward. Following this event, the branch of the Wabash River that originates along the Wabash
Moraine near Bluffton became the system&#x27;s main course and source.

For part of its course, the Wabash follows the path of the pre-glacial Teays River. The river has shifted course several times along the Indiana and Illinois border, creating cutoffs where parts of the river are entirely in either Indiana or Illinois. However, both states generally regard the middle of the river as the state border.

==History==

The Wabash was first mapped by French explorers to the Mississippi in the latter half of the 17th century, including the sections now known as the Ohio River. The Wabash is considered a tributary of the Ohio River. Until the mid-18th century, however, the Ohio was considered a tributary of the Wabash. French traders had traveled north and south from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico via the Wabash; it served as a vital trade route for North American-French trade and was the river they knew best.

In the 18th century, the profitable 8-mile portage between the Maumee River and the Wabash was controlled by the Miami people at Kekionga.

The United States has fought five colonial and frontier-era battles on or near the river: the Battle of Vincennes (1779), St. Clair&#x27;s Defeat (1791), the Attack on Fort Recovery (1794), the Battle of Tippecanoe (1811), and the Siege of Fort Harrison (1812). Several different conflicts have been referred to as the &quot;Battle of the Wabash&quot;. A remnant of the old-growth forests that once bordered the Wabash can be found at Beall Woods State Park, near Mount Carmel, Illinois. In the mid-19th century, the Wabash and Erie Canal, one of the longest canals in the world, was built along much of the river. Portions are still accessible in modern times, but most of the abandoned canal no longer exists. Its contribution to transportation was surpassed by construction of competing railroads.

The Wabash River between Terre Haute and the Ohio River was navigable by large ships during much of the 19th century, and was a regular stop for steamships. By the late 19th century, erosion due to farming and runoff made the Wabash impassable to such ships. Dredging could have resolved the problem, but was not undertaken because railroads had become the preferred form of transport. The 200-mile stretch south of Terre Haute includes several inoperable swing bridges.

==Course==
The Wabash River rises 4 miles south of Fort Recovery, Ohio, very near the Darke-Mercer County line about 1.5 miles east of the Indiana-Ohio border. The water source is farmland drainage. A half mile downstream (i.e. east), at a roadside park on Ohio 49 at the Mercer County line, is a historical marker that announces the river&#x27;s start. This land is also the portage for headwaters of the Mississinewa River, Stillwater River and West Fork of the White River, which lie just a few miles away.

Between the start of the river and Fort Recovery, the current is swift and the water remains very shallow and follows a poorly defined channel. The shallow depth and low bridge clearances make the section nearly impassable by boat except in the most ideal conditions. At mile seven and mile nine, two tributaries give the river a significant boost in volume, and at mile eleven the river flows past Fort Recovery. Two more tributaries add to the river&#x27;s volume between Fort Recovery and Macedon at mile eighteen, making the river navigable for the remainder of its course. The river continues to flow northward passing the community of Wabash at mile twenty-three and then cutting sharply west, crossing into Indiana at mile twenty-eight.

Upon entering Indiana, the river has many sharp turns; these regularly lead to log jams that can block the river. Because of the many turns in the river, during the 1830s, the state created several separate canal channels to shorten the journey between the state line and Fort Wayne as part of the Wabash and Erie Canal project. The canals were abandoned after competing railroads took over; this allowed the river to shift courses several times, resulting in the formation of many cut-offs and coves with no outlet. The river has a maze-like quality in the first seventeen-mile (27 km) stretch as it enters Indiana.

At mile forty-five, the river becomes straighter with few sharp bends. An additional seventeen tributaries raise the depth of the river considerably, making it navigable for larger vessels. At mile fifty-nine, the river passes through Ouabache State Park, where it begins to widen and become more shallow. The white limestone river bottom can sometimes be seen in the area, whereas it is not visible due to pollution elsewhere downstream. As the river exits the park and flows toward the city of Bluffton near mile sixty-six, it widens further, becoming more shallow; only a narrow channel is navigable by larger vessels.

The river remains shallow and somewhat rocky with minor rapids until mile seventy-one near the community of Murray. There the river becomes calm and deeper until mile eighty-one, due to the dam and levee at the town of Markle. The lock that was formerly at the site is abandoned and a narrow washout is the only means to bypass the dam. In the rocky washout the river level drops four feet, making it one of the most dangerous points on the river. Boaters are advised to exit the river and reembark on the other side of the dam rather than traverse the washout.

At mile eighty-nine, the large Huntington Dam blocks the river. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers to make a reservoir, the dam creates the J. Edward Roush Lake. The lake is surrounded by park land and recreation areas and is about five miles (8 km) in length and a mile wide at its widest point. The mile-long stretch after the Huntington Dam is rarely navigable. No lock connects the two sections of the river, and the water is often very shallow. A second smaller dam at mile ninety-one presents a dangerous hazard, and the section between it and the Huntington Dam has been closed to boaters.

At mile ninety-three the river is joined by its first major tributary, the Little River. The city of Huntington developed at the confluence of the two rivers. The tributary dramatically increases the volume of water in the Wabash at this point. Because of the dams on the Wabash, the Little River often carries more water than the Wabash. Additional minor tributaries raise the water level between Huntington and the city of Wabash. As the river passes Wabash and moves toward Peru, it splits, creating a series of islands; sandbars are common in the stretch. The river returns to a single channel at Peru, and flows through one of its most gentle stretches until reaching Logansport. Here the river again splits into multiple channels, divided by islands. Some of the channels are narrow and rocky, while the larger channels are navigable.

Between Logansport and Delphi, at mile 176, is one of the few remaining stretches of the Wabash and Erie canal. It can be accessed at Delphi. Just past Delphi, the Wabash&#x27;s second major tributary, the Tippecanoe River, joins the river. The confluence of the two rivers is part of Prophetstown State Park, the site of the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe. The flow of the Tippecanoe into the Wabash raises its level dramatically. At this point, most large power boats can easily navigate the river at cruising speed.

The river passes the city of Lafayette at mile 210 and gradually begins to end its westward flow, beginning a wide turn to the south. At mile 241, at the city of Covington, the river begins flowing due south. The river is deep at this point, but there are several gravel bars between Covington and Terre Haute. Terre Haute, beginning at mile 300, is among the largest cities in Indiana. Although navigable by large ships in the past, the remainder of the river becomes shallow in places due to erosion and silt. The river gradually widens moving south. It borders Illinois beginning at mile 316, and serves as a state boundary line with Indiana for the remainder of its course.

At Darwin, a farmer&#x27;s cooperative operates the Wabash&#x27;s only ferry service. It is used to take heavy farm equipment across the river. South of Darwin, beginning at mile 410 a large bluff gradually rises, eventually towering two-hundred feet over the river. The area is one of the most remote of the river, and it generally gives onto open land. The area becomes more densely populated as it nears the city of Vincennes at mile 441. Founded by the French about 1720, Vincennes is the oldest European settlement in Indiana, and among the oldest in the American Midwest. The city is sited on a strategic bend in the river that allowed it to control river traffic. Four miles west, as the river turns southward, another major tributary, the Embarras River joins.

Past Vincennes, the Wabash is joined by its largest tributary, the White River at Mount Carmel, Illinois, significantly increasing its size, to over 750 feet wide. Roughly a mile downstream, near the Gibson Generating Station, another large tributary, the Patoka River, also joins. During low water, there are rapids at the confluence, caused by an old canal lock that was abandoned after flooding. Further downstream, the river zig-zags, creating the &quot;tail&quot; of Gibson County, a panhandle between the river and Posey County. From the tail southward there are several cut-offs from the river, resulting in several natural exclaves between Indiana and Illinois, the largest of which is at Grayville. A flood caused the river to change course, disconnecting a two-mile (3 km) long stretch of the river and creating a lake entirely on the Illinois side. Between these exclaves is the historic town of New Harmony, a settlement created by Utopians during the 1810s. It is joined by the Black River on the Indiana side.

At mile 460, the river again splits into several channels. The area features sandy beaches and the largest islands in the river, some a mile in length. The Little Wabash River, another major tributary, joins at mile 482 on the Illinois side, near New Haven. At mile 491 the Wabash flows into the Ohio River near Hovey Lake.

==Fauna==

The Wabash River supports an abundant and diverse wildlife population. At least 150 species of birds have been sighted around the river. The waterfowl are most dependent on the river. Black-crowned and Yellow-crowned night heron, and merlin inhabit the area. Several species of shorebirds build nest on or near the banks of the river. The river is home to many species of fish including species of bass, sunfish, crappie, catfish, carp, and others. Aquatic reptiles including snakes and turtles also occur in the river. A number of amphibians occur throughout the river&#x27;s watershed including the American bullfrog and the eastern newt. Crayfish are also common throughout the river.

<text>The Global Ecovillage Network (GEN) is a global association of people and communities (ecovillages) dedicated to living &quot;sustainable plus&quot; lives by restoring the land and adding more to the environment than is taken. Network members share ideas and information, transfer technologies and develop cultural and educational exchanges.

==History==
Hildur and Ross Jackson from Denmark established the Gaia Trust, a charitable foundation, in 1991. Gaia funded a study by Robert Gilman and Diane Gilman of sustainable communities around the world. The report, &quot;Ecovillages and Sustainable Communities&quot;, was released in 1991. The report found that although there were many interesting ecovillage projects, the full-scale ideal ecovillage did not yet exist. Collectively, however, the various projects described a vision of a different culture and lifestyle that could be further developed.

In 1991 the Gaia Trust convened a meeting in Denmark of representatives of eco-communities to discuss strategies for further developing the ecovillage concept. That led to the formation of the Global Ecovillage Network. In 1994 the Ecovillage Information Service was launched. In 1995, the first international conference of ecovillage members, entitled Ecovillages and Sustainable Communities for the 21st Century was held at Findhorn, Scotland. The movement grew rapidly following this conference.

By 2001, GEN had obtained consultative status at the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). In October 2005, at the conference to celebrate the tenth anniversary of GEN, a group of young adults joined to found NextGEN (the Next Generation of the Global Ecovillage Network). GEN does not have a verification procedure to select ecovillages or member subscriptions on its website. A Community Sustainability Assessment Tool has been developed that provides a means to assess how successful a particular ecovillage is at improving its sustainability.

==Members==
The network includes a variety of types of sustainable settlements and ecovillages:
*Eco towns, such as Auroville in South India and the Federation of Damanhur in Italy; 
*rural ecovillages, such as Gaia Asociación in Argentina and Huehuecoyotl, in Mexico; 
*permaculture sites, including Crystal Waters, Queensland, Australia, Cochabamba, Bolivia and Barus, Brazil;
*urban rejuvenation projects, such as Los Angeles EcoVillage and Christiania in Copenhagen, and 
*educational centers, such as Findhorn Foundation in Scotland, the Centre for Alternative Technology in Wales, and the Ecovillage Training Center in Tennessee.

==Aim==
The Global Ecovillage Network&#x27;s aim is &quot;to support and encourage the evolution of sustainable settlements across the world.&quot; The network does this through:
*Internal and external communications services; facilitating the flow and exchange of information about ecovillages and demonstration sites;
*Networking and project coordination in fields related to sustainable settlements, and
*Global cooperation/partnerships (UN Best Practices, EU Phare, EYFA, ECOSOC).

==Regions==
GEN is composed of five global regions: Africa (GEN Africa), Europe (GEN Europe), Latin America (CASA), North America (GENNA) and Oceania &amp; Asia (GENOA).

<doc id="427209" wikidata="Q2473331" url="?curid=427209" title="Pinus sabiniana">
<text>Pinus sabiniana (sometimes spelled P. sabineana) is a pine endemic to California in the United States. Its vernacular names include towani pine, foothill pine, gray pine, ghost pine, and bull pine. The name digger pine was historically used but includes a racial slur.

== Description ==
&quot;Pinus sabiniana&quot; trees typically grow to , but can reach . The pine needles are in fascicles (bundles) of three, distinctively pale gray-green, sparse and drooping, and grow to in length. The seed cones are large and heavy, in length and almost as wide as they are long. When fresh, they weigh from , rarely over . The male cones grow at the base of shoots on the lower branches.
== Taxonomy ==
=== Common name ===
The name digger pine supposedly came from the observation that the Paiute foraged for its seeds by digging around the base of the tree. It is more likely that the term was first applied to the people; &quot;Digger Indians&quot; was in common use in California literature from the 1800s. The historically more common name &quot;digger pine&quot; is still in widespread use. The Jepson Manual advises avoiding this name as the authors believe &quot;digger&quot; is pejorative in origin.

The tree is also sometimes thought of as a pinyon pine, though it does not belong to that group.
=== Botanical name ===

The scientific botanical name with the standard spelling &quot;sabiniana&quot; commemorates Joseph Sabine, secretary of the Horticultural Society of London. Some botanists proposed a new spelling &quot;sabineana&quot;, because they were confused with Latin grammar. The proposal has not been accepted by the relevant authorities (i.e. United States Department of Agriculture, The Jepson Manual or Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN). The GRIN notes that the spelling &quot;sabiniana&quot; agrees with a provision in the Vienna Code of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, the governing body of botanical nomenclature. In that code, recommendation 60.2C states that personal names can be Latinized in species epithets: &#x27;Sabine&#x27; is Latinised to &quot;sabinius&quot;, with the addition of the suffix &quot;-anus&quot; (pertaining to) the word becomes &quot;sabiniana&quot; (In Latin, trees are feminine, irrespective if the word ends with a masculine suffix, i.e. &quot;pinus&quot;). The GRIN database notes that Sabine&#x27;s last name is not correctable and therefore &quot;Pinus sabiniana&quot; is the proper name for the species.

== Distribution and habitat ==


&quot;Pinus sabiniana&quot; grows at elevations between sea level and and is common in the northern and interior portions of the California Floristic Province. It is found throughout the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges foothills that ring the Central, San Joaquin and interior valleys; the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges; and Mojave Desert sky islands. Multiple specimens have also been found in Southern Oregon as well. It is adapted to long, hot, dry summers and is found in areas with an unusually wide range of precipitation: from an average of per year at the edge of the Mojave to in parts of the Sierra Nevada. It prefers rocky, well drained soil, but also grows in serpentine soil and heavy, poorly drained clay soils. It commonly occurs in association with &quot;Quercus douglasii&quot;, and &quot;Oak/Foothill Pine vegetation&quot; (also known as &quot;Oak/Gray Pine vegetation&quot;) is used as a description of a type of habitat characteristic within the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion in California, providing a sparse overstory above a canopy of the oak woodland.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Pinus sabiniana&quot; needles are a food of the caterpillars of the Gelechiid moth &quot;Chionodes sabinianus&quot;. Fossil evidence suggests that it has only recently become adapted to the Mediterranean climate as its closest relatives are part of the Madrean pine-oak woodlands found at higher elevations in the southwest US and Mexico.

Animals help spread the seeds, including birds such as the scrub jay and acorn woodpecker.

== Uses ==
Some Native American groups relied heavily on sweet pine nuts for food and are thought to have contributed to the current distribution pattern, including the large gap in distribution in Tulare County. Native Americans also consumed the roots.

Protein and fat nutritional value of the seed are similar to &quot;Pinus pinea&quot; seeds and figured in the local indigenous diet.

Wood uses historically were determined by its particular characteristics, e.g., 0.43 mean specific gravity nearly equal to Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii); strength properties similar to ponderosa pine; Kraft pulps high in bursting with tensile strength comparable to some northern conifer pulps; and foothill stands loggable in winter, when higher-altitude species were inaccessible. However, the high amounts of resin and compression wood, the often crooked form, heavy weight, and low stand density, made it expensive otherwise to log, transport and process. Commercial value decreased by the 1960s, to limited use for railroad ties, box &quot;shook&quot;, pallet stock, and chips.

It may still offer potential as windbreak shelterbelt plantings.

The main turpentine constituent, heptane, an alkane hydrocarbon, at about 3 percent of needle and twig oil, is unusual in botany; the only other source in nature perhaps being the &quot;Pittosporum resiniferum&quot;, known as &quot;petroleum nut&quot; or kerosene tree.

<text>Giovanni Braschi (27 February 1891 – 4 January 1959) was an Italian politician and lawyer.

==Biography==
He was born into a Catholic family of timber traders, attended secondary schools in Cesena and high school studies in Faenza; in July 1919 he graduated in law at the University of Bologna with a thesis on the concept of &quot;perpetual peace&quot; of Kant and Rousseau.
He volunteered in infantry at the outbreak of World War I, obtained the rank of lieutenant, was taken prisoner in one of the attempts to conquer Sasso Stria in the south-eastern Dolomites and imprisoned first in Austria and then in Hungary.

After the World War I he was provincial secretary of the Forlì branch of the People&#x27;s Party and was among the leaders of the Italian Confederation of Workers.

He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1921 and in 1924. He was declared declined from his office in 1926, with the advent of the fascist regime. He was arrested on 2 December 1943. Once out of prison he moved to the Northern Italy, where he participated in the anti-fascist struggle in the formations of the newly formed Christian Democratic Party.

After the World War II, in 1946, he was elected member of the Constituent Assembly. From 6 February to 31 May 1947 he was Undersecretary for Finance and Treasury with responsibility for war damage in the 3rd De Gasperi Government.

In 1948 he was appointed Senator by right for having taken part in three legislatures and because he was declared declined from the mandate in 1926. He remained a senator until his death.
From 1955 to 1957 he served as Minister of Post and Telecommunications in the First Segni Government.

<text>is a Japanese novelist, short story writer, essayist and filmmaker. His novels explore human nature through themes of disillusion, drug use, surrealism, murder and war, set against the dark backdrop of Japan. His best known novels are &quot;Almost Transparent Blue&quot;, &quot;Audition&quot;, &quot;Coin Locker Babies&quot; and &quot;In the Miso Soup&quot;.

==Biography==
Murakami was born in Sasebo, Nagasaki on 19 February 1952. The name &quot;Ryūnosuke&quot; was taken from the protagonist in &quot;Daibosatsu-tōge&quot;, a work of fiction by .

Murakami attended school in Sasebo. While a student in senior high, he joined in forming a rock band called Coelacanth, as the drummer. In the summer of his third year in senior high, Murakami and his fellow students barricaded the rooftop of his high school and he was placed under house arrest for three months. During this time, he had an encounter with hippie culture, which had a strong influence on him.

After graduating from high school in 1970, Murakami formed another rock band and produced some 8-millimeter indie films. He enrolled in the silkscreen department at Gendaishichosha School of Art in Tokyo, but dropped out in the first year. In October 1972, he moved to Fussa, Tokyo and was accepted for the sculpture program at Musashino Art University. He married his wife, a keyboard player, in the 1970s and their son was born in 1980. In the early 1990s, Murakami devoted himself to disseminating Cuban music in Japan and established a label, &quot;Murakami&#x27;s&quot;, within Sony Music.

Murakami started the e-magazine &quot;JMM&quot; (Japan Mail Media) in 1999 and still serves as its chief editor. Since 2006, he has also hosted a talk show on business and finance called &quot;Kanburia Kyuden&quot;, broadcast on TV Tokyo. The co-host is Eiko Koike. In the same year, he began a video streaming service, RVR (Ryu&#x27;s Video Report). In 2010, he established a company, , to sell and produce eBooks.

==Works==

Murakami&#x27;s first work was the short novel &quot;Almost Transparent Blue&quot;, written while he was still a university student. It deals with promiscuity and drug use among disaffected youth. Critically acclaimed as a new style of literature, it won the Gunzo Prize for New Writers in 1976, despite some objections on the grounds of decadence. Later the same year, his &quot;Blue&quot; won the Akutagawa Prize, going on to become a bestseller.

In 1980, Murakami published a much longer novel, &quot;Coin Locker Babies&quot;, again to critical acclaim, and won the 3rd Noma Liberal Arts New Member Prize. Next came the autobiographical novel &quot;69&quot;, and then &quot;Ai to Gensō no Fascism&quot; (1987), revolving around the struggle to reform Japan&#x27;s survival-of-the-fittest society with a secret &quot;Hunting Society&quot;. His work &quot;Topaz&quot; (1988) concerns a sado-masochistic woman&#x27;s radical expression of her sexuality.

Murakami&#x27;s &quot;The World in Five Minutes From Now&quot; (1994) is written as a point of view in a parallel universe version of Japan, and was nominated for the 30th Tanizaki Prize. In 1996 he continued his autobiography &quot;69&quot;, and released the &quot;Murakami Ryū Movie and Novel Collection&quot;. He also won the Taiko Hirabayashi Prize. The same year, he wrote the novel &quot;Topaz II&quot;, about a female high school student engaged in &quot;compensated dating&quot;, which later was adapted as the live-action film &quot;Love and Pop&quot; by anime director Hideaki Anno. His &quot;Popular Hits of the Showa Era&quot; concerns the escalating firepower in a battle between five teenage male and five middle-aged female social rejects. Literary scholar Barbara Greene suggests that the text reveals how &quot;the invisible violence of post-Bubble Japan’s social order is made explicit through a low-stakes, yet hyperviolent, guerilla war undertaken by a set of ludicrous and narcissistic characters whose increasingly deadly attacks are met with public indifference. Within the consumer-capitalist social order, personal satisfaction is the paramount goal...&quot;

In 1997 came the psychological thriller novel &quot;In the Miso Soup&quot;, set in Tokyo&#x27;s Kabuki-cho red-light district, which won him the Yomiuri Prize for Fiction that year. &quot;Parasites&quot; (&quot;Kyōsei chū&quot;, 2000) is about a young hikikomori fascinated by war. It won him the 36th Tanizaki Prize. The same year &quot;Exodus From Hopeless Japan&quot; (&quot;Kibō no Kuni no Exodus&quot;) told of junior high school students who lose their desire to be involved in normal Japanese society and instead create a new one over the internet.

In 2001, Murakami became involved in his friend Ryuichi Sakamoto&#x27;s group NML &quot;No More Landmines&quot;, which sets out to remove landmines from former battle sites around the world.

In 2004, Murakami announced the publication of &quot;13 Year Old Hello Work&quot;, aimed at increasing interest in young people who are entering the workforce. &quot;Hantō wo Deyo&quot; (2005) is about an invasion of Japan by North Korea. It won him the Noma Liberal Arts Prize and .

The novel &quot;Audition&quot; was made into a feature film by Takashi Miike. Murakami reportedly liked it so much he gave Miike his blessing to adapt &quot;Coin Locker Babies.&quot; The screenplay for the latter was worked on by director Jordan Galland but Miike failed to raise enough funding for it. An adaptation directed by Michele Civetta is currently in production.

In 2011, &quot;Utau Kujira&quot; won the .

<doc id="427216" wikidata="Q7071694" url="?curid=427216" title="O'Cahan">
<text>The O&#x27;Cahan (Irish: Ó Catháin &#x27;descendants of Cahan&#x27;) were a powerful sept of the Northern Uí Néill&#x27;s Cenél nEógain in medieval Ireland. The name is presently anglicized as O&#x27;Kane, Kane and Keane.

The O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s originated in Laggan in the east of present-day County Donegal and from there moved eastwards in the twelfth century, ousting the O&#x27;Connor from Keenaght in present-day County Londonderry. They held the lordship of Keenaght and Coleraine until the seventeenth century, to which it was commonly referred to as &quot;O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s country&quot;. Under the sub-ordination of their kin, the O&#x27;Neills, they held the privilege of inaugurating the chief of the O&#x27;Neill by tossing a shoe over the new chief&#x27;s head in acceptance of his rule.

There is also an unrelated sept of O&#x27;Cahan in the province of Connacht, the O&#x27;Cahan Ui Fiachra (&quot;Ó Catháin Uí Fiachrach&quot;). At first, O&#x27;Cahan held the title chief of Cenel Ianna. After expelling O&#x27;Drennan (&quot;Ó Draighneán&quot;), chief of Cenel Sedna, O&#x27;Cahan was henceforth known as chief of Cenel Sedna. The earliest recorded O&#x27;Cahan was Eoghan O&#x27;Cahan (&quot;Eogháin Ua Catháin&quot;), abbot of Clonfert (&quot;Cluan-fearta-Brennainn&quot;), County Galway, died 980 A.D.

== Naming conventions ==

The surname has been anglicised O&#x27;Cahan, Cahan, O&#x27;Kane, Kane, O&#x27;Keane, Keane, O&#x27;Kean, Kean, and similar variations thereof.
==History==
The O&#x27;Cahan sept of Keenaght Glengiven first appear on record in 1138. A thirteenth-century chief of the family was Cumee na Gall O&#x27;Cahan. A heavily restored effigy at Dungiven Priory is sometimes associated with Cumee, although it appears to date to the last quarter of the fifteenth century, and seems to be that of a later member of the sept. Dunseverick Castle also formed part of the O&#x27;Cahan possessions until it was destroyed by Scottish troops under the command of Robert Monro during the Irish Rebellion of 1641.

The clan suffered a blow during the battle of Drumderg, where fifteen O&#x27;Cahan chieftains were slain in battle against the Normans and their gaelic allies.

Rory Dall O&#x27;Cahan, an Irish harpist of the 17th century most famous as the composer of Give Me Your Hand, may have penned the popular Irish tune the &quot;Londonderry Air&quot;, in order to lament the destruction of O&#x27;Cahan power. Consequently, it may have been originally called &quot;O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s Lament&quot;. The music is best known as the tune of the song &quot;Danny Boy&quot;.By the late 16th-century, &quot;O&#x27;Cahan&#x27;s Country&quot; became the county of Coleraine. The majority of Ó Catháin chiefs fled Ulster in the Flight of the Earls in 1607, and under the terms of Surrender and regrant they forfeited their lands to the English crown. During the subsequent Plantation of Ulster, County Coleraine along with parts of counties Antrim, Donegal, and Tyrone, were merged to form County Londonderry. After the Flight of the Earls in 1607, Donnell Ballagh O&#x27;Cahan, Chief of the Ó Catháin (and at one time knighted by the English Crown), was captured and sent to the Tower of London, where he died in 1626. There has been no Chief since.

<doc id="427217" wikidata="Q1154619" url="?curid=427217" title="Werner syndrome">
<text>Werner syndrome (WS) or Werner&#x27;s syndrome, also known as &quot;adult progeria&quot;, is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder which is characterized by the appearance of premature aging.

Werner syndrome is named after the German scientist Otto Werner. He identified the syndrome in four siblings observed with premature aging, which he explored as the subject of his dissertation of 1904.

It has a global incidence rate of less than 1 in 100,000 live births (although incidence in Japan and Sardinia is higher, affecting 1 in 20,000–40,000 and 1 in 50,000, respectively). 1,300 cases had been reported as of 2006. Affected individuals typically grow and develop normally until puberty; the mean age of diagnosis is twenty-four, often realized when the adolescent growth spurt is not observed. The youngest person diagnosed was six years old. The median and mean ages of death are 47–48 and 54 years, respectively. The main causes of death are cardiovascular disease and cancer.

==Presentation==
Werner syndrome patients exhibit growth retardation, short stature, premature graying of hair, alopecia (hair loss), wrinkling, prematurely aged faces with beaked noses, skin atrophy (wasting away) with scleroderma-like lesions, lipodystrophy (loss of fat tissues), abnormal fat deposition leading to thin legs and arms, and severe ulcerations around the Achilles tendon and malleoli (around ankles). Other symptoms include change in voice (weak, hoarse, high-pitched), atrophy of gonads leading to reduced fertility, bilateral cataracts (clouding of lens), premature arteriosclerosis (thickening and loss of elasticity of arteries), calcinosis (calcium deposits in blood vessels), atherosclerosis (blockage of blood vessels), type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis (loss of bone mass), telangiectasia, and malignancies. The prevalence of rare cancers are increased in individuals with Werner syndrome.

===Gene expression===

Gene transcription changes found in WS cells are strikingly similar to those observed in normal aging. At the level of gene expression, WRN protein deficiency causes changes in the pattern of gene expression that markedly resemble those of normal old age.

===Clinical symptoms===
The mutation in the &quot;WRN&quot; gene that causes Werner syndrome is autosomal and recessive, meaning that affected people must inherit a copy of the gene from each parent. Patients display rapid premature aging beginning in young adulthood, usually in their early twenties. Diagnosis is based on six cardinal symptoms: premature graying of the hair or hair loss, presence of bilateral cataracts, atrophied or tight skin, soft tissue calcification, sharp facial features, and an abnormal, high-pitched voice. Patients are generally short-statured due to absence of the adolescent growth spurt. Patients also display decreased fertility. The most common symptom of the six is premature graying and loss of hair. This is also generally the earliest observed symptom, with hair loss occurring first on the scalp and the eyebrows.

Werner syndrome patients often have skin that appears shiny and tight, and may also be thin or hardened. This is due to atrophy of the subcutaneous tissue and dermal fibrosis. Over time, the characteristic facial features may be more apparent due to these skin conditions. Other associated skin conditions include ulcers, which are very difficult to treat in Werner syndrome patients, and are caused in part by decreased potential of skin cells for replication.

WS cataracts are distinctly different from those of normal aging. They are associated with problems in the lens posterior cortex and subcapsular regions. These cataracts are generally treatable with cataract surgery, which should restore normal vision.

Symptoms become apparent in the late teens and early twenties and continue to progress. Most patients live to about fifty years of age. The most common causes of death for people are associated diseases and complications, especially atherosclerosis and cancer.

===Associated diseases===
Werner syndrome patients are at increased risk for several other diseases, many associated with aging. Atherosclerosis, the thickening of artery walls due to cholesterol buildup, is one common complication. While normal atherosclerosis generally involves the major arteries, smaller arterioles are more likely to be affected. It is possible nervous system disorders are associated. Brain atrophy is present in 40% of patients. Osteoporosis, the loss of bone mineral density common in post-menopausal women, is another common symptom. In contrast with the normal population, the rate of osteoporosis is especially high for male patients. Diabetes mellitus is another common accompaniment. Skin ulcers occur in about 75% of patients – and can be difficult to treat. If skin ulcers become badly infected or develop gangrene, they often require amputation. Unlike most other related diseases and complications, these ulcers are not associated with normal aging.

Patients are also at an increased risk of cancer, especially malignant melanoma. Soft-tissue sarcomas are the most common cancer types. Other types of skin cancer, other epithelial cancers such as thyroid and liver cancers, MDS (myelodysplastic syndrome), and MFH (malignant fibrous histiocytoma) are also prevalent among. Mutations in the &quot;WRN&quot; gene, especially single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are associated with many of the cancers and other associated diseases. &quot;WRN&quot; SNPs correlate with cancers such as sarcomas and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, as well as diabetes and cardiovascular problems including atherosclerosis.

==Causes==
Approximately 90% of individuals presenting Werner syndrome have any of a range of mutations in the gene, &quot;WRN&quot;, the only gene currently attributed to cause Werner syndrome. &quot;WRN&quot;, which lies on chromosome 8 in humans, encodes the WRNp protein, a 1432 amino acid protein with a central domain resembling members of the RecQ helicases. RecQ helicases are a special type of helicase that function at unique times during DNA repair of doubled stranded breaks, which are a form of DNA damage that results in a break of both strands of DNA. Thus, RecQ helicases are important for maintaining DNA stability, and loss of function of these helicases has important implications in the development of Werner syndrome. In addition to the central domain, there are three exonuclease domains at the N-terminus and a Helicase and Ribonuclease D C-terminal (HRDC) domain at the C-terminus.

When functioning normally, the &quot;WRN&quot; gene and its associated protein (WRNp) are important for maintaining genome stability. WRNp is active in unwinding DNA, a step necessary in DNA repair and DNA replication. Specifically, it has an important role in responding to replication malfunctions, particularly double-stranded breaks, and stalled replication machinery. WRNp may reactivate replication by preventing unwanted recombination processes from occurring or by promoting recombination, depending on the type of DNA damage. In addition, WRNp physically interacts with or binds to several other proteins that are involved in processing DNA. For example, when WRNp binds to RPA, its helicase activity is stimulated. WRNp also physically interacts with p53, a tumor suppressor gene that stops the formation of tumors and the progression of cancers, which inhibits the exonuclease activity of the WRNp. Since WRNp&#x27;s function depends on DNA, it is only functional when localized to the nucleus.

===DNA repair processes===
The finding that WRN protein interacts with DNA-PKcs and the Ku protein complex, combined with evidence that WRN deficient cells produce extensive deletions at sites of joining of non-homologous DNA ends, suggests a role for WRN protein in the DNA repair process of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). WRN protein also physically interacts with the major NHEJ factor X4L4 (XRCC4-DNA ligase 4 complex). X4L4 stimulates WRN exonuclease activity that likely facilitates DNA end processing prior to final ligation by X4L4.

WRN protein appears to play a role in resolving recombination intermediate structures during homologous recombinational repair (HRR) of DNA double-strand breaks.

WRN protein participates in a complex with RAD51, RAD54, RAD54B and ATR proteins in carrying out the recombination step during inter-strand DNA cross-link repair.

Evidence was presented that WRN protein plays a direct role in the repair of methylation induced DNA damage. This process likely involves the helicase and exonuclease activities of WRN protein that operate together with DNA polymerase beta in long patch base excision repair.

===Effects on cell structure and function===
Mutations which cause Werner syndrome all occur at the regions of the gene which encode for protein, and not at non-coding regions. There are 35 different known mutations of &quot;WRN&quot;, which correspond to stop codons, insertions, or deletions that result in a frameshift mutation.
These mutations can have a range of effects. They may decrease the stability of the transcribed messenger RNA (mRNA), which increases the rate at which they are degraded. With less mRNA, less is available to be translated into the WRNp protein. Mutations may also lead to the truncation (shortening) of the WRNp protein, leading to the loss of its nuclear localization signal sequence, thus it is no longer transported into the nucleus where it interacts with the DNA. This leads to a reduction in DNA repair. Furthermore, mutated proteins are more likely to be degraded than normal WRNp. Apart from causing defects in DNA repair, its aberrant association with p53 down-regulates the function of p53, leading to a reduction in p53-dependent apoptosis and increasing the survival of these dysfunctional cells. Cells of affected individuals also have reduced lifespan in culture, have more chromosome breaks and translocations and have extensive deletions.

Patients with Werner syndrome lose the RecQ helicase activity in the WRN protein because of the loss of its C-terminus region, but the mechanism by which this happens is unclear. The loss of the helicase activity can have far-reaching consequences in terms of cell stability and mutation. One instance of these consequences involves telomeres. It is thought that the WRN helicase activity is important not only for DNA repair and recombination, but also for maintaining telomere length and stability. Thus, WRN helicase is important for preventing catastrophic telomere loss during DNA replication. In a normal cell, the telomeres (the ends of chromosomes) undergo repeated shortening during the cell cycle, which can prevent the cell from dividing and multiplying. This event can be counteracted by telomerase, an enzyme that extends the ends of the chromosomes by copying the telomeres and synthesizing an identical, but new end that can be added to the existing chromosome. However, patients with Werner syndrome often exhibit accelerated telomere shortening, indicating that there may be a connection between the loss of the WRN helicase activity and telomere and cell instability. While evidence shows that telomere dysfunction is consistent with the premature aging in WS, it has yet to be determined if it is the actual cause of the genomic instability observed in cells and the high rate of cancer in WS patients.

Without the WRN protein, the interwoven pathways of DNA repair and telomere maintenance fail to suppress cancer and the aging symptoms seen in patients with WS. Events such as rapid telomere shortening cause Werner syndrome cells to exhibit low responses to overall cellular stress. In addition to telomere dysfunction, over-expression of oncogenes and oxidation can induce this type of response. High stress causes a synergistic effect, where WS cells become even more sensitive to agents that increase cell stress and agents that damage DNA. As a result, WS cells show a drastic reduction in replicative lifespan and enter into a stage of aging prematurely. The accumulation of these damaged cells due to telomere shortening over many years may be indicative of why Werner syndrome symptoms only appear after an individual is about twenty years old.

===Protection of DNA against oxidative damage===
WRN protein was found to have a specific role in preventing or repairing DNA damages resulting from chronic oxidative stress, particularly in slowly replicating cells. This finding suggested that WRN may be important in dealing with oxidative DNA damage that underlies normal aging (see DNA damage theory of aging).

==Diagnosis==
==Treatment==
A cure for Werner syndrome has not yet been discovered. It is often treated by managing the associated diseases and relieving symptoms to improve quality of life. The skin ulcers that accompany WS can be treated in several ways, depending on the severity. Topical treatments can be used for minor ulcers, but are not effective in preventing new ulcers from occurring. In the most severe cases, surgery may be required to implant a skin graft or amputate a limb if necessary. Diseases commonly associated with Werner syndrome such as diabetes and cancer are treated in generally the same ways as they would be for a non-Werner syndrome individual. A change in diet and exercise can help prevent and control arteriosclerosis, and regular cancer screenings can allow for early detection of cancer.

There is evidence that suggests that the cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drug SB203580 may be a possible therapeutic option for patients with Werner&#x27;s syndrome. This drug targets the p38 signaling pathway, which may become activated as a result of genomic instability and stalled replication forks that are characteristic mutations in WS. This activation of p38 may play a role in the onset of premature cell aging, skin aging, cataracts, and graying of the hair. The p38 pathway has also been implicated in the inflammatory response that causes atherosclerosis, diabetes, and osteoporosis, all of which are associated with Werner&#x27;s syndrome. This drug has shown to revert the aged characteristics of young WS cells to those seen in normal, young cells and improve the lifespan of WS cells &quot;in vitro&quot;. SB203580 is in the clinical trial stages, and the same results have not yet been seen &quot;in vivo&quot;.

In 2010, vitamin C supplementation was found to reverse the premature aging and several tissue dysfunctions in a genetically modified mouse model of the disease. Vitamin C supplementation also appeared to normalize several age-related molecular markers such as the increased levels of the transcription factor NF-κB. In addition, it decreases activity of genes activated in human Werner syndrome and increases gene activity involved in tissue repair. Supplementation of vitamin C is suspected to be beneficial in the treatment of human Werner syndrome, although there was no evidence of anti-aging activity in nonmutant mice. In general, treatments are available for only the symptoms or complications and not for the disease itself.

==History==
Otto Werner was the first to observe Werner syndrome in 1904 as a part of his dissertation research. As a German ophthalmologist, Werner described several progeria-like features and juvenile cataracts in many of his patients. He noticed these symptoms particularly in a family with four sequential children who all showed the characteristics of the syndrome at around the same age. He assumed the cause to be genetic, though most of his evidence was clinical. Between 1934 and 1941, two internists from New York, Oppenheimer and Kugel, coined the term &quot;Werner Syndrome&quot;, igniting a wave of interest and research on the disease.
During that time, Agatson and Gartner suggested a possible link between Werner&#x27;s syndrome and cancer. However, it was not until 1966 that there was a general consensus on the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance for the syndrome. By 1981, geneticists had located the WRN gene on chromosome 8, leading to its cloning in 1996. This cloning of the WRN was significant because it revealed the predicted WRN protein was made from a family of DNA helicases. Prior to 1996, Werner syndrome was thought to be a model for accelerated aging. Since the discovery of the gene, it has become clear that the premature aging displayed in Werner syndrome is not the same, on a cellular level, as normal aging. The role of WRN in DNA repair and its exonuclease and helicase activities have been the subject of many studies in recent years.

Since the initial discovery in 1904, several other cases of Werner syndrome have been recorded. Many of these cases have occurred in Japan, where a founder effect has caused a higher incidence rate than in other populations. The incidence rate of Werner syndrome in Japan is approximately 1 case per 100 thousand people (1:100,000), a large contrast with the rate of incidence for the rest of the world, which is between 1:1,000,000 and 1:10,000,000. A founder effect is also apparent in Sardinia, where there have been 18 recorded cases of Werner syndrome.

==Society and culture==
In the Metal Gear franchise, several characters visually suffer from the effects of Werner Syndrome. The first character is Solid Snake, who suffers from rapidly accelerated aging, despite being a young man. By the time of his early 40s, he appears to be in his early 70s. This is revealed to be the side effect of being a genetically engineered &quot;test-tube baby&quot;, specifically made to be a clone of Big Boss (Metal Gear). Solid Snake&#x27;s genetic code was deliberately modified to make him rapidly age and die prematurely, to ensure he could not turn rogue against a powerful Shadow government (conspiracy theory) named &quot;The Patriots&quot;. Big Boss&#x27; genetic material was also used to create two other clone children, named Liquid Snake, and Solidus Snake. Liquid Snake is the main antagonist of the 1998 entry in the franchise, Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game). While not visually suffering from the effects of Werner&#x27;s Syndrome, he is injected with a nanomachine-borne virus named &quot;FOXDIE&quot; that, over a long enough period of time, will cause rapid aging and premature death in the victim. However, FOXDIE causes Liquid Snake to suffer from a fatal heart attack before he can live long enough to see the apparent effects of Werner&#x27;s Syndrome. Solidus Snake, never having been injected with FOXDIE, but ages naturally, and appears as a middle-aged man in his only appearance in the sequel Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty.

<text>Dunseverick () is a hamlet near the Giant&#x27;s Causeway in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. The name is also the alias for the townland of Feigh. It is most notable for Dunseverick Castle.

One of the five great highways, or &quot;slighe&quot; of ancient Ireland, Slige Midluachra, had its terminal point at Dunseverick, running from here to Emain Macha and further to royal Tara and the fording point on the Liffey at what is now Dublin.

The hamlet of Dunseverick itself lies in the adjacent townland of Currysheskin.

<text>The Sperrins or Sperrin Mountains () are a mountain range in Northern Ireland. The range stretches from Strabane and Mullaghcarn in the west, to Slieve Gallion and the Glenshane Pass in the east, in the counties of Tyrone and Londonderry. The landscape is mostly moorland and blanket bog. The region has a population of some 150,000 and is a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==Features==
It has a distinctive glaciated landscape. The mountains mostly have rounded summits and the landscape is mainly moorland and blanket bog. The Glenshane Pass, part of the A6 Belfast to Derry road, is in the mountains and has notoriously bad weather in winter. Sawel Mountain is the highest peak in the Sperrins, and the seventh highest in Northern Ireland. Its summit rises to . Another of the Sperrins, Carntogher (464 m), towers over the Glenshane Pass.

Geologically, the Sperrins are formed mostly from Precambrian metamorphic rocks, with some younger Ordovician igneous rocks in the southern flank of the range. The Mountains are very sparsely populated and provide habitat for a diverse range of birds and mammals. Red fox, Sika Deer, Pine Marten and Red Squirrels are commonly found there alongside Peregrine Falcons, Buzzards and Sparrowhawks. Visiting Golden Eagles from the neighbouring reintroduced Donegal population have been sighted across the range from Strabane to Draperstown although no breeding population has yet been established. The Mountains also provide one of the last refuges of Red Grouse in Northern Ireland.

<text>The Lebel Model 1886 rifle (French: Fusil Modèle 1886 dit &quot;Fusil Lebel&quot;) also known as the &quot;Fusil Mle 1886 M93&quot;, after a bolt modification was added in 1893, is an 8 mm bolt-action infantry rifle that entered service in the French Army in 1887. It is a repeating rifle that can hold eight rounds in its fore-stock tube magazine, one round in the elevator plus one round in the chamber; equaling a total of ten rounds held. The Lebel rifle has the distinction of being the first military firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition. The new propellant powder, &quot;&quot;Poudre B&quot;,&quot; was nitrocellulose-based and had been invented in 1884 by French chemist Paul Vieille. Lieutenant Colonel Nicolas Lebel contributed a flat nosed 8 mm full metal jacket bullet (&quot;&quot;Balle M&quot;,&quot; or &quot;&quot;Balle Lebel&quot;). Twelve years later, in 1898, a solid brass pointed (spitzer) and boat-tail bullet called &quot;Balle D&quot;&quot; was retained for all 8mm Lebel ammunition. Each case was protected against accidental percussion inside the tube magazine by a primer cover and by a circular groove around the primer cup which caught the tip of the following pointed bullet. Featuring an oversized bolt with front locking lugs and a massive receiver, the Lebel rifle was a durable design capable of long range performance. In spite of early obsolete features, such as its tube magazine and the shape of 8mm Lebel rimmed ammunition, the Lebel rifle remained the basic weapon of French infantry during World War I (1914–1918). Altogether, 3.45 million Lebel rifles were produced by the three French state factories between 1887 and 1916.

==Operation, features, and accessories==
In operation, the bolt is turned up to the vertical position until the two opposed front locking lugs are released from the receiver. At the end of the bolt&#x27;s opening phase, a ramp on the receiver bridge forces the bolt to the rear thus providing leveraged extraction of the fired case. The rifle is fitted with a two-piece wood stock, and features a spring-loaded tubular magazine in the fore-end. Taking aim at intermediate distances is done with a ramp sight graduated between 400 and 800 meters. The ladder rear sight is adjustable from 850 to 2,400 meters. Flipping forward that ladder sight reveals the commonly used fixed combat sight up to 400 meters. The Mle 1886 Lebel rifle has a 10-round capacity: eight in the under-barrel tube magazine, one in the elevator, and one in the chamber (although unsafe to leave a cartridge in the chamber as the rifle does not have a safety). The Lebel rifle features a magazine cutoff on the right side of the receiver. When activated, it prevents feeding cartridges from the magazine.

The Mle 1886 Lebel rifle was issued with a long needle-like quadrangular épée bayonet, the &quot;Épée-Baïonnette Modèle 1886&quot;, with a length of 52 cm. (20 in.). With its X-shaped cross section, the épée bayonet was optimized for thrusting, designed to readily penetrate thick clothing and leather. The bayonet was dubbed &quot;Rosalie&quot; by French soldiers who were issued it during World War I.

==Origins and development==
Historically, the Mle 1886 Lebel rifle was the first military firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition. This new propellant powder, made of stabilized nitrocellulose, was called &quot;Poudre B&quot; (&quot;Powder B&quot;) and had just been invented in 1884 by Paul Vieille (1854-1934). &quot;Poudre B&quot; was three times as powerful as black powder, for the same weight, and left virtually no residues of combustion. For this last reason, the new powder enabled the reduction of the caliber. The increase of the bullet speed in the barrel required a stronger bullet than the older lead bullet. New cartridges were designed where the lead was placed in a full metal jacket (invented in 1882 by Eduard Rubin) from a deformable alloy.

The French military initially planned to adopt a wholly new rifle design and spent the year 1885 on determining an optimal caliber as well as testing Remington-Lee rifles which showed themselves well in the Sino-French War; a Mannlicher rifle was to be tested in 1886 in order to compare it to Lee, and a brand new cartridge was to be designed as well.

However shortly thereafter, in January 1886, a new revanchist French war minister, General Georges Ernest Boulanger, threw these plans into a garbage bin and requested the urgent application of these two technical breakthroughs to the design of a new infantry rifle. He appointed General Tramond in charge of the project which had to be completed within one year.

Firstly the 11mm Gras cartridge case was necked-down into an 8mm case (similarly to how 8×60mmR Guedes was created by Portuguese a few years earlier, except that cartridge used black powder and therefore was longer), a transformation carried out by Gras and Lt. Colonel Desaleux, which necessitated a double taper handicapping French firearms design for decades to come. The repeating mechanism, derived from the French Mle 1884 Gras-Kropatschek repeating rifle, was implemented by Albert Close and Louis Verdin at the Chatellerault arsenal. The bolt&#x27;s two opposed front locking lugs, inspired from the two rear locking lugs on the bolt of the earlier Swiss Vetterli rifle, were designed by Colonel Bonnet. The 8mm flat nosed FMJ &quot;&quot;Balle M&quot; bullet was suggested by Tramond and designed by Lt. Colonel Nicolas Lebel after whom the rifle (and the caliber) are named. However, Lebel did not lead the team responsible for creating the new rifle. He amicably protested during his lifetime that Tramond and Gras were the two superior officers who jointly deserved that credit. Nevertheless, his name, which only designated the &quot;Balle M&quot; bullet as the &quot;Balle Lebel&quot;,&quot; informally stuck to the entire weapon.

The Lebel was designed to be backwards compatible so it could use up existing stores of parts. It used the straight trigger and horizontal bolt action from the army&#x27;s single-shot 11mm Mle 1874 Gras and shared the tubular magazine from the navy&#x27;s Mle 1878 Kropatschek rifle. The Mle 1884 and Mle 1885 Kropatschek rifles, still chambered for the 11mm Gras black-powder cartridge, were later adopted by the army as a transitional repeating firearm. The Mle 1885 had a two-piece stock and a massive steel receiver and closely resembles the Mle 1886 Lebel.

Boulanger ordered to produce a million rifles by May 1, 1887, but his proposal how to achieve that was entirely unrealistic and the overall speed was clearly impossible (he was sacked the same year for provoking a war with Germany). The Lebel rifle was manufactured by three government arsenals: Châtellerault, St-Etienne and Tulle, mostly during late 1880s and early 1890s. It featured a two-piece stock and a massive receiver designed to withstand the higher pressures developed by the new smokeless powder-based cartridges.

In 1893, an improved version of the M1886 Lebel was designated Fusil Mle 1886 M 93. The most useful improvement was a modification of the bolt head so it would divert away from the shooter&#x27;s face any hot gases escaping from a ruptured cartridge case. The firing pin and its rear knob had already been modified in 1887 while the stacking rod remained unchanged. Lastly, the fixation of the rear sight onto the barrel was substantially improved during that 1893 modification.


Between 1937 and 1940, a carbine-length (17.7 inch [45 cm] barrel) version of the Lebel was issued to mounted colonial troops in North Africa. This short carbine version of the Lebel, called the Mle 1886 M93-R35., was assembled in large numbers (about 50,000) at Manufacture d&#x27;Armes de Tulle (MAT), beginning in 1937. It used all of the Lebel&#x27;s parts except for a newly-manufactured shorter barrel of carbine length. It used new sights based on that of the Berthier carbine and had a shortened version of the Lebel bayonet. Since the new carbine&#x27;s tube magazine had to be shortened as well, its magazine capacity was only three rounds.

While being up to its time, the Lebel rifle design was not without any shortcomings and became outdated much faster than any of the magazine rifles of other European militaries that followed French example during late 1880s and 1890s. While ammunition had to be loaded into the design one at a time, other country&#x27;s service rifles were being loaded with stripper clips at a much faster rate. The tube fed magazine also greatly affected the rifle&#x27;s balance when being fired, which could have been another shortcoming.

==Competitors and successors==
Upon its introduction, the Lebel rifle proved to be vastly superior to the Mauser M-71/84, the German Army&#x27;s replacement of the Model 1871 Mauser. France finished its rearmament program with the Lebel in 1889, just 18 months after Germany had completed its rifle replacement program with 780,000 M-71/84s. The new French rifle alarmed Bismarck. Tests at Spandau arsenal in the winter of 1887-1888 found that the Lebel could fire 43 rounds of smokeless powder ammunition per minute compared to just 26 of black-powder ammunition for the M-71/84. The inferiority of the Mauser M71/84 and its 11mm black-powder ammunition was one reason why Bismarck opposed going to war with France that winter, despite being pressed by War Minister Waldersee (another reason was that the new French De Bange field artillery, now equipped with breech loaders after the lessons of the 1870 war, both outnumbered and outperformed the Krupp C64 field guns in their rate of fire).

The Mle 1886 rifle proved to be a sturdy and serviceable weapon, but one which became rapidly outdated by advances in military rifle and ammunition designs. As early as 1888, the German Army&#x27;s Rifle Testing Commission had introduced in response a completely new turnbolt magazine rifle with a spring-loaded box magazine: the Gewehr 88 &quot;commission&quot; rifle. Above all else, it had been designed around the first ever rimless military cartridge using the new smokeless powder ammunition: the &quot;Patrone 88&quot; cartridge. The early Gewehr 88 was followed 10 years later by the successful Gewehr 98 which originally was chambered for the &quot;Patrone 88&quot;. Shortly after the 1903 pattern &quot;S Patrone&quot; cartridge evolved out of and replaced the &quot;Patrone 88&quot;. The adaption of existing &quot;Patrone 88&quot; chambered fire arms to the &quot;S Patrone&quot; was fairly easy and quickly realized.

In response to being left behind by Germany&#x27;s Mauser rifle, the French military decided in 1909 to replace the Lebel and its rimmed cartridge by more advanced designs. Consequently, while the bolt action Berthier rifle was first issued in 1907 as a stop-gap to arm colonial troops, the French defense ministry was planning to leapfrog other military forces with an advanced semi-automatic infantry rifle. This new weapon was the Meunier rifle, also known as the Fusil A6, which chambered a more powerful 7×59mm rimless cartridge. It was adopted in 1912 after an extensive competitive process. However, its manufacture, which was to begin in 1913, was suspended because of the imminent risk of war with Germany. Instead, and during World War I, the French Army chose the easier and less expensive solution of adopting a gas-operated semi-automatic rifle which incorporated some Lebel parts: the Fusil Mle 1917 RSC, once again in 8mm Lebel caliber. It was manufactured in large numbers (85,000) during 1918 and issued to select soldiers in infantry regiments. However, the Mle 1917 RSC was criticized by infantrymen as being too heavy, too long, and too difficult to maintain in the trenches. Furthermore, it also needed a special five-round clip to operate. In the end, the aged M1886 Lebel and variants of the Berthier rifle remained in service until the Armistice of November 11, 1918 and beyond.

==8mm Lebel cartridge==
When it first appeared, the Lebel&#x27;s 8×50R smokeless ammunition allied to its longer range and flatter trajectory brought a revolution in infantry armament. A soldier equipped with a Lebel could outrange troops carrying rifles chambered for black-powder, large-caliber lead-bullet ammunition. Using smokeless powder, he could remain virtually invisible to an enemy at longer ranges, yet locate an enemy at any range by the smoke from their rifles. He could also carry more cartridges for the same overall weight.

A new 197 gr (12.8 g) solid brass (90% copper-10% zinc) pointed (spitzer) and boat-tail bullet (&quot;Balle D&quot;)—historically the very first boat-tailed plus spitzer rifle bullet to be invented and then widely manufactured—was adopted for the Lebel rifle in 1898 and placed in generalized service after 1901. Desaleux&#x27;s own &quot;Balle D&quot; provided a flatter trajectory and increased the range of the Mle 1886 rifle to about 4,000 yards and its maximum effective wounding distance (when fired indirectly at massed area targets) to 1,800 yards. More importantly, due to the bullet&#x27;s flatter trajectory, the realistic effective range of the 8mm Lebel was increased to approximately using open sights. The altered ballistic trajectory of the new cartridge necessitated a replacement of the Lebel&#x27;s rear sights.

Firstly, in order to avoid accidental percussion inside the Lebel tube magazine and in order to receive the pointed bullet tip of the cartridge that followed, all the French-manufactured military &quot;Balle D&quot; and &quot;Balle N&quot; ammunition had a circular groove etched around each primer pocket. Moreover, the Berdan primer on each French-made military &quot;Balle D&quot; round was further protected against accidental percussion by a thick, primer cover which was crimped in after 1915, the &quot;Balle D a.m.&quot;

The last type of Lebel military issue ammunition to be introduced was the Cartouche Mle 1932N, using a cupro-nickel, silver-colored, jacketed spitzer boat-tailed lead-cored bullet which was only suitable for Lebel and Berthier rifles marked &quot;N&quot; on top of the receiver and barrel. This 8mm Lebel heavier Balle &quot;N&quot; ammunition had originally been designed to increase the range of the Hotchkiss machine gun. Its manufacturing ceased in France during the late 1960s.

8mm Lebel ammunition was powerful for its time. It ranked slightly higher in muzzle energy than .303 British and slightly lower than the German 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge. The chief negative characteristic of 8mm Lebel ammunition was the geometry of its rimmed bottlenecked case, due to the will to reuse 11mm Gras case set of tools. This adversely affected the magazine capacity and functioning of firearms, particularly in automatic weapons such as the Chauchat machine rifle. The Lebel cartridge&#x27;s heavily tapered case shape and substantial rim forced weapon designers to resort to magazines with extreme curvatures as for the Chauchat machine rifle. In contrast, rimless straight-wall cartridges such as the .30-06 Springfield and the 8×57mm Mauser could easily be loaded in straight vertical magazines.

==M1886 in service==


Following the adoption of the Lebel rifle by the French Army, most other nations switched to small-bore infantry rifles using smokeless ammunition. Germany and Austria adopted new 8mm infantry rifles in 1888; Italy and Russia in 1891; and the U.S. in 1892 with the Krag rifle. The British upgraded their .303 Lee–Metford with smokeless cartridges in 1895, resulting in the .303 Lee–Enfield.

In the early years of the twentieth century, the Lebel rifle was sold in the French overseas colonies for the protection of civilians or for hunting purposes. Brand new Lebels could be purchased by authorized civilians and were featured in catalogs of the French mail-order firm Manufrance printed until 1939. Those &quot;civilian market&quot; Lebels sold by Manufrance were strictly identical in fit and finish to the military issue Lebels, except for the lack of a bayonet lug and no stacking rod. Furthermore, a large game hunting version of the Lebel called the &quot;Lebel-Africain&quot; was also offered for sale by Manufrance during the pre-World War II years. This particular version featured a shorter barrel, a turned-down bolt handle and a slimmer, better finished stock. However, it had to compete as a hunting weapon against the bolt-action Mauser and Mannlicher–Schönauer hunting rifles that became available on the French marketplace, in the early 1900s.

===World War I===
The Lebel rifle was a hard-hitting and solidly built weapon with a reputation for reliability in adverse environments including those of trench warfare. The Lebel rifle was quite accurate up to 300 yards and still deadly at three times that distance, thanks to the spitzer and boat tail &quot;Balle D&quot; bullet. Nevertheless, the Lebel rifle was not without its flaws:
* The slow-to-reload tube magazine was the Lebel&#x27;s worst handicap when compared to other military rifles of that period.
* The Lebel&#x27;s diminutive sights, while accurate, were low and small thus not easy to align and unprotected against shocks.
* The lack of a wooden handguard on top of the barrel led to burned hands after prolonged firings.

Nevertheless, the Lebel rifle was preferred by French infantrymen over the M1907-15 Berthier rifle with its limited three-round magazine capacity. The difference was the Lebel&#x27;s larger magazine capacity in an emergency (eight rounds plus two extra rounds). In the words of David Fortier (in &quot;Standard Catalog of Military Rifles&quot;, 2003): &quot;The rifle shoulders nicely and is comfortable with a 13.5&quot; length of pull. Align the hard to see sights and squeeze. When the hammer drops the Lebel slaps hard on both ends. The bolt handle is a bit out of reach due to its forward placement, but the action is fairly smooth and easy to run from the shoulder. You just have to give it a bit of a tug at the end to snap the shell carrier up ... With quality ammunition and a good bore these rifles are capable of fine accuracy. ... A rugged and reliable design, the Lebel soldiered on far longer than it should have.&quot;

During World War I (1914–1918), the Lebel remained the standard rifle of French infantry whereas the Berthier rifle—a lengthened version of the Berthier carbine—featuring a Mannlicher-style 3-round magazine was issued to colonial troops, to allied contingents in the French Army, and to the French Foreign Legion. The latter, however, demanded and obtained in 1920 being re-equipped with the Lebel rifle. The Lebel rifle could also be used with a removable VB (Viven-Bessieres) rifle grenade launcher. While the Lebel rifle was quite effective up to 300 meters with the standard &quot;Balle D&quot; boat-tail bullet ammunition, accuracy at longer distances was impaired by the existing open sights. Consequently, the APX Mle 1916 and APX Mle 1917 models of the Lebel rifle with adjustable telescopic sights were issued in numbers during WW-1, beginning in late 1916.

During World War I, Lebels were supplied to various Allied armies, such as Serbia, Russia, Belgium or United States.

The German Empire captured many Lebels, especially after the fall of Lille during the Race to the Sea. The rifles were marked &quot;Deutsches Reich&quot; and issued to rear units.

===Post-World War I use===

Because of negative factors during the late 1920s and 1930s—a depressed economy, reduced war budgets under the Popular Front led by Leon Blum, and neglect at high military levels, the French Army was slow to modernize its infantry weapons. For instance, production of the bolt-action MAS-36 rifle began much too late (in 1937) although its prototype had already been approved in 1929. As a result, MAS-36 rifles to equip French infantry were in short supply when World War II broke out in September 1939. Furthermore, a thoroughly tested French semi-automatic rifle was also ready to be placed into production by 1939. But due to the German occupation of France during the Second World War, five more years had to pass before this gas-operated weapon (the MAS-1939 and MAS-40) could be issued as the MAS-44, MAS-49 and MAS 1949-56 series. Another adverse result of all these delays is that Lebel rifles—many of which had since been shortened into a carbine-length version, the Mle 1886 M93R35—were still in the hands of front-line and reserve troops at the outbreak of the war. More than 3 million were available in French arsenals. There are pictures of Italian Social Republic infantrymen armed with M1886s, perhaps resurrected from a shipment provided by the French in World War I to replace the rifles lost by Italy after the Caporetto defeat, or seized later, during Italian occupation of France. Other were seen in the hands of Soviet partisans. Likewise, in 1944 the German Wehrmacht had issued some captured M1886 Lebel rifles, given the German identification code Gewehr 301(f), to some of their occupation troops in France, but in limited numbers. In 1945, during the final months of the war, many Lebel rifles were issued to Volkssturm conscripts along with any other available weapons. Some years later, during the Indochina and Algerian Wars, Lebel rifles were issued to auxiliaries or second-lines units. Functional Lebel rifles have been found in Iraq during the Iraqi insurgency after 2003.

<text>The rufous-tailed scrub robin (Cercotrichas galactotes) is a medium-sized member of the family Muscicapidae. Other common names include the rufous scrub robin, rufous bush chat, rufous bush robin and the rufous warbler. It breeds around the Mediterranean and east to Pakistan. It also breeds south of the Sahara from the Sahel region east to Somalia; these African birds are sometimes considered to be a separate species, the African scrub robin (&quot;C. minor&quot;). It is partially migratory, wintering in Africa (Kenya, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia) and India. This is a very rare visitor to northern Europe.

The scientific name is from Ancient Greek. &quot;Cercotrichas&quot; is from &quot;kerkos&quot;, &quot;tail&quot; and &quot;trikhas&quot;, &quot;thrush&quot;, and &quot;galactotes&quot; means resembling milk, from &quot;gala&quot;, &quot;milk&quot;.

The rufous-tailed scrub robin is a bird of dry open country with bushes and shrubs. It builds its nest a few feet off the ground; there are three to five eggs in a typical clutch.

The rufous-tailed scrub robin is larger than the European robin. It has brown upper parts, whitish under parts, and a prominent whitish supercilium and a dark eye-stripe. The western race has a paler, warmer brown back than birds in southeastern Europe and Asia. The long rufous tail is frequently fanned, showing the black and white tips of the tail feathers. The adult male and female have similar plumage and the juvenile resembles the adult but is paler. These birds feed on insects mostly caught on the ground. Their clear thrush-like song has a sad tone.

==Description==
Adult male and female rufous-tailed scrub robin look alike and measure about long with relatively long legs and a large rounded tail. The upper parts are a rich brownish chestnut, with the rump and uppertail coverts rather more rufous. There is a distinct curved, creamy-white broad streak from the nostrils to behind the eye and a dark brown line through the eye. The under-eye area is whitish and the ear coverts pale brown. The eye and the beak are both brown but the lower mandible of the beak has a greyish base. The underparts are buffish white, with the chin, central belly and undertail coverts paler than the other parts. The feathers of the wing are dark brown, fringed on the leading edge with buff and on the trailing edge with pale chestnut-brown and with the secondaries tipped with white. The central pair of feathers on the tail are bright rufous-chestnut with narrow black tips and the rest a similar colour with white tips and adjacent broad black bands. The legs and feet are pale brown. Juveniles are similar in appearance but generally a paler sandy-brown colour. The plumage is moulted in the autumn and prior to this, the white tips of the tail feathers may have become reduced in size or worn off.

The song is a somewhat lark-like but often disjointed series of notes, sometimes clear and loud but at other times soft, and is sung from an elevated position near the top of a tree, on a pole or on a wire. It has been described as having a sad tone.

==Distribution and habitat==

The rufous-tailed scrub robin is a partial migrant. Its breeding range extends from Portugal, southern Spain and the Balkan Peninsula, through the Middle East to Iraq, Kazakhstan and Pakistan. In Africa it breeds from Morocco to Egypt and south of the Sahara as far east as Somalia. It is an uncommon vagrant to northern Europe. It winters in North Africa and eastwards to India. Its habitat is dry scrubby open country with patches of dense bushes in lowlands or foothills; where it is numerous, it may also be found in parks, vineyards and large gardens.

The rufous-tailed scrub robin has an extensive range, estimated at , and a large population, including an estimated 96 to 288 thousand individuals in Europe. As the European range is somewhere between a quarter and half of the global range, the global population may range from 196 thousand to 1.15 million individuals. The population size appeared to be stable in 2013 and the bird was not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criteria of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and was then evaluated as being of &quot;Least Concern&quot;.

==Behaviour==

The rufous-tailed scrub robin is found flitting among dense cover but also in more open positions on trees, the tops of bushes and on posts. It is frequently seen on the ground hopping about and flaring and bobbing its tail up and down. When perched it also displays its tail in this way and also sometimes droops its wings before giving them a little flick forward. It feeds mainly on the ground on insects such as beetles, grasshoppers and the larvae of butterflies and moths, and on earthworms, turning over the leaf litter to find its prey.

The male rufous-tailed scrub robin has an unusual display flight involving a downward swoop with uplifted wings and may sing while displaying. The nest is built a few feet off the ground in a bush, a hedge of prickly pear, on a tree stump or other concealed place. It is usually well-hidden and is untidily built of grasses, stems, roots and other fibres. The inside is neatly cup-shaped and is lined with fine roots, hairs and often a piece of snakeskin. A clutch of four to five (occasionally fewer) eggs is laid. The eggs average about and have a pale greenish or greyish-white background colour liberally sprinkled with greyish-brown spots.

==Ecology==
Sometimes the rufous-tailed scrub robin is found in association with a woodchat shrike (&quot;Lanius senator&quot;), perhaps nesting in a neighbouring tree. The woodchat shrike perches near the top of a tree, ever alert to sparrowhawks, buzzards and other aerial predators while the scrub robin perches on a bush or lower branch, scanning the ground for the approach of snakes, cats, weasels, foxes, genets, ocellated lizards and other predators. Both birds are adept at luring away predators by flying towards them to attract their attention and then flitting away from the nest site through the undergrowth. The rufous-tailed scrub robin can recognise the warning cries of other species of bird and take appropriate action.

<doc id="427245" wikidata="Q774637" url="?curid=427245" title="Virgin Media One">
<text>Virgin Media One, also called Virgin One, is an Irish free-to-air television channel owned by Virgin Media Ireland (part of Liberty Global), operated through its subsidiary Virgin Media Television. The channel launched on 20 September 1998, as TV Three, becoming Ireland&#x27;s fourth television channel and the first commercial channel. It was known as TV3 from 2006, and then as Virgin Media One from 30 August 2018. The channel broadcasts a mix of Irish programming and acquired programming from ITV and other networks.

==History==
In October 1988, the Independent Radio and Television Commission (IRTC) was set up to regulate new independent stations. Following this TV3 was intended to be the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s third terrestrial channel. The original broadcasting licence was granted to a consortium &quot;Tullamore Beta Ltd&quot; in 1990 (some of this consortium made up of Windmill Lane Productions and Paul McGuinness). It was originally envisaged that the channel would broadcast solely on cable and analogue MMDS, but it was later (1990) decided that the channel should broadcast on some terrestrial UHF transmitters similar to other Irish channels. Initially their signal coverage was much poorer than that of RTÉ but this has been largely addressed since the switchover to digital television.

TV3&#x27;s broadcast was further delayed when IRTC revoked the broadcasting licence due to delays in broadcasting the channel. After a court battle the licence was eventually restored in 1993. By 1993 an agreement was made to sell 49 per cent of the company to UTV, to raise much-needed cash for investment in facilities. However, UTV pulled out of negotiations in 1995, after TV3 tried to convince existing MMDS and cable television providers to drop UTV and replace it with TV3. Cable operators declined to drop UTV Northern Ireland from its line-up.

In 1997, Canadian communications company Canwest bought a major stake in the new company. In 2001, Granada purchased a 45% share in the company. By 2006 the group was sold to Doughty Hanson &amp; Co. In 2015, Liberty Global confirmed it planned to purchase the TV3 Group, approval to purchase the broadcaster was given on 2 October 2015 by the CCPC.

In June 2018, it was announced that the TV3 Group channels would be rebranded as Virgin Media Television on 30 August 2018, with TV3 renamed Virgin Media One.

==Subsidiary channels==
===Virgin Media One +1===
A timeshift channel TV3 +1 launched on 2 December 2014 on UPC Ireland. The channel was added to Sky Ireland on 8 April 2015.

However, the channel is unavailable to viewers on Saorview, as TV3 were in dispute with its operator 2RN (formerly a subsidiary of RTÉ) over the non-payment of tariffs over several years by TV3. On 30 August 2018, with the rebrand of TV3, TV3 +1 was rebranded as Virgin Media One +1.

===Virgin Media One HD===
TV3 HD is a high definition version of TV3, both domestic and imported programming is available in HD, mainly sporting content. TV3 HD launched on Virgin Media Ireland and Sky Ireland on 11 August 2015. It is anticipated TV3 will utilise its existing Virgin Media TV3 HD Studio in Ballymount where a number of its shows already broadcast from such as Ireland:AM, Xposé, The Tonight Show and 3 News. The service is currently unavailable on Saorview. On 30 August 2018, with the rebrand of TV3, TV3 HD was rebranded as Virgin Media One HD.

==Broadcasting policy==
TV3 broadcasts a wide range of programming which in its early years depended heavily on international acquisitions. In 2008, the TV3 Group produced a three-year strategy to increase the amount of homegrown productions on the channel. Under its contract with the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI), TV3 is required since 2008 to have 30% of its programming coming from Ireland though TV3 now produces 40% Irish produced content (most of this content comes from in studio productions such as &quot;Ireland AM&quot; and &quot;Xposé&quot;). In 2010 TV3 announced a target of 50% Irish programming by 2012. TV3 has also confirmed its plan to build a major new studio in 2011 which will be fully HD capable with audience capacity.

The company has a small staff of 200 employees to run three television channels and one on-demand online service. On average, TV3 spend about €10 million on internal productions which are generally for daytime viewers. It does not have a history of strong prime-time content; generally its home produced programmes consist of at least one independently produced programme, e.g. The Apprentice, a number of internal documentaries such as Ireland Undercover and a number of BCI licence fee-funded independent products such as School Run, Diary of... and Modern Ireland.

As of October 2009, TV3 claims to be the most watched television channel by people aged 15–24 years old. This group was previously captured by RTÉ One. This is an important group to capture as it is often these viewers whom advertisers wish to target. In reaction to this press release from TV3, RTÉ rebutted its claims stating that RTÉ One outdoes TV3 in far more demographic categories and that TV3&#x27;s press release, &quot;In terms of the selective audiences focussed upon by TV3 in their release, it&#x27;s clear this is a recent phenomenon and only pertains to a narrow sub-demographic of young viewers in this country. By contrast, the year-to-date equivalent (1 January – 20 October), all day national share, sees RTÉ One with a 16.2% share of the 15-24s; TV3 with a 13.3% share.&quot;

===Budget===
In 2009 TV3 had revenues of €54,300,000. In the previous year (2008), TV3 received €62 million in advertising revenue. Increases in programme cost during 2008 included new sporting contracts with the GAA and UEFA, the first renewal of its contract with the British broadcaster ITV for shows such as &quot;The X Factor&quot; and &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, a small but significant increase in programmes commissioned from independent producers. It also increased investment in online technology, with its online service earning a profit for the first time.

In 2008, TV3 received €3 million in funding from the licence fee for independent productions on the channel.

In 2009, two rounds of redundancies reduced TV3 staff to 213 people. Staff savings have been augmented by agreed reductions in wages. The 200 staff working in TV3 now provide seven hours of live television five days a week, an increase of two hours and a staff reduction of 50 since 2007.

In February 2012 the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) restructured TV3&#x27;s outstanding loans to the bank. The owners of TV3, Doherty Hanson &amp; Co., have loans of €140million with the bank. €51million continued to be repaid over the next 5 years, while €81.1 was frozen until a &quot;liquidity event&quot;, according to the IBRC this is in the event of a sale of TV3.

In 2014 TV3 saw losses of €7 million, and €17 million in 2015, with operating expenses of €55.6 million.

===Product placement===
Product placement within Irish produced programming had previously been banned by broadcasting authorities in Ireland, though in the past Irish viewers have been used to product placement as seen on US television and film productions. Due to an EU ruling made in 2007, Irish broadcasters can now place products within programming mainly entertainment shows, though excludes programming which is deemed mainly &#x27;news and current affairs&#x27; and programming aimed at children. On 15 August 2011 it was confirmed that TV3 would become the first official broadcaster to implement the new broadcasting terms. Kenco reportedly paid TV3 Group a six-figure sum to place its branding on two key early morning television shows mainly, &quot;The Morning Show&quot; and &quot;Midday&quot; from September 2011. Similar to RTÉ and TG4 broadcasters will have to air the logo &#x27;PP&#x27; at the beginning and end of the show to inform viewers that products will appear on the show. RTÉ Television has previously used product placement on its series &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;.

==Irish-produced programming==
Virgin Media Ireland programming has often been criticised for having no &quot;distinctive, clearly Irish identity&quot;. In spring 2008, a major effort was made by the station to change this situation. In general Virgin Media Ireland spends around €10 million on its Irish productions each year. In 2008 it significantly increased the number of prime time shows produced in Ireland. Under current broadcasting legislation, Virgin Media One is required to use 15% of its total Irish production budget for independent productions. Since 2004 independent productions for the network have been able to avail of the BAI&#x27;s Sound and Vision Fund, a fund provided to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) from the licence fee. In 2008 independent producers received €3million from the Sound and Vision fund for programming that they produced for the network.

===News and current affairs===
Virgin Media News provides national Irish and international news through television, online, on-demand and on mobile. The news service begins at 07:00 with regularly bulletins featured on &quot;Ireland AM&quot; until 10:30. The main news bulletins on Virgin Media One are &quot;Virgin Media News at 12.30&quot;, &quot;Virgin Media News at 5.30&quot;, &quot;Virgin Media News at 8.00&quot;, plus &quot;Virgin Media News on Two&quot; on Virgin Media Two. On Virgin Media Three, &quot;60 Second Update&quot; bulletins are broadcast throughout prime-time.

===Sports programming===

From its infancy, TV3 aired a live sporting programme called &quot;Sports Tonight&quot; (1998–2009) hosted by Trevor Welsh. The show would air weeknights from 23:30, until its cancellation on 23 March 2009.

At its launch, TV3 secured rights to number of Republic of Ireland exhibition matches. It joined forces with Sky to provide deferred coverage of World Cup Qualifying games along with a programme dedicated to League of Ireland games, &quot;The Soccer Show&quot; and live coverage of League of Ireland games. Later those games moved to RTÉ after the government chose to put those games on a live free-to-air footing.

Virgin Media Ireland currently holds the Irish broadcasting rights to 2018 for UEFA Champions League on Tuesday nights, while RTÉ 2 covers Wednesday nights and the final exclusively live. which includes in-vision sporting commentary and analysis by Virgin Media Sport presenters and crew. Coverage is presented by Tommy Martin alongside 2 pundits examples being Graeme Souness, Harry Redknapp, Brian Kerr, Neil Lennon, Martin Keown or Tony Cascarino. Commentary is provided by Dave McIntyre and Kevin Kilbane or Mark Lawrenson with Trevor Welsh also providing highlights commentary. The network previously held exclusive Irish rights from 2001 to 2004. It then lost these to RTÉ but since 2009 have shared rights with RTÉ and will continue to have these rights until 2018. TV3 also held rights to the UEFA Europa League matches on Thursday nights until 2015. In 2015 TV3 began airing the FA Cup Final live and will do so through to 2018. The coverage was presented by Tommy Martin alongside Paul McShane and Brian Kerr with commentary by Dave McIntyre and Kevin Kilbane.

A milestone in TV3 broadcasting history came with coverage of the 2011 UEFA Europa League Final, held at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Forty cameras were used to broadcast to an audience in the tens of millions across the world.

From 2008 to 2013 TV3 secured broadcasting rights for a selection of GAA All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship matches as part of &quot;Championship Live&quot;. In 2008, the station began broadcasting a selection of live matches, as well as a weekly preview show called &quot;Championship Throw In&quot;. TV3 lost these rights in 2014 to Sky Sports.

TV3 first aired Rugby with coverage of the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The channel had coverage of 13 games with all Ireland matches, quarter-finals, semi-finals, the final and the opening match shown live alongside Setanta Ireland who broadcast all matches. TV3 coverage in 2007 was hosted by Matt Cooper with analysis by Paul Wallace, Trevor Brennan, Jim Glennon, Michael Cheika, Jim Williams and Victor Costello. The commentators were Conor McNamara and Phillip Matthews.

Days after the loss of Gaelic games Championship rights in 2014, the station secured live free to air coverage of the 2015 Rugby World Cup. TV3 broadcast all 48 matches in the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Coverage was presented by Matt Cooper or Tommy Martin alongside Keith Wood, Matt Williams, Peter Stringer, Shane Jennings, Neil Back, Murray Kinsella with commentary by 2 commentary teams – the first being Conor McNamara, Stuart Barnes and Liam Toland and the second being Dave McIntyre and Hugo McNeill. Other commentary was provided by the world field such as Andrew Cotter, Joel Stransky, Alan Quinlan, Chris Patterson. The coverage has been met with significant criticism due to the high number of ad breaks and their positioning throughout the coverage. After a successful Rugby World Cup for TV3 they shocked RTÉ Sport in November 2015 by winning the rights to broadcast all matches in the 6 Nations from 2018 to 2021 with RTÉ continuing to cover the tournament in 2016–2017.

===Daytime programming===
Virgin Media One&#x27;s daytime TV takes up the majority of its home produced programming. Virgin Media Ireland has stated that 40% of its total output is of Irish origin 10% more than its requirement under its broadcast licence with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. Together &quot;Ireland AM&quot;, &quot;News at 12.30&quot;, &quot;Xposé&quot; and &quot;News at 5.30&quot; make up 30 hours of television each week.

TV3&#x27;s first daytime produced programme was &quot;Speakeasy&quot; produced by Fastnet for TV3. The series focused on topical issues affecting people in Ireland ranging from divorce, sex, crime, multiculturalism, poverty, sexuality and other topics were discussed amongst the presenter and a panel of guests. The show ran for one year from 1998 to 1999.

The station created a new morning news talk show, &quot;Ireland AM&quot;, launched in September 1999. It became Ireland&#x27;s first televised breakfast show.

===Drama===

In 2004 it co-produced RTÉ Two&#x27;s ill-fated 20 some-things drama &quot;The Big Bow Wow&quot;.

Since 2006, the channel has looked towards home produced drama with the likes of &quot;Laura Windermere&#x27;s Bag&quot; and &quot;Deception&quot;. It also took a look at two other drama serials &quot;The Guards&quot; and a revival of RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;The Clinic&quot;; however, neither came to fruition.

In 2008, further homegrown produced drama series were added, the first being the one-off bilingual drama &quot;School Run&quot;. This was based on a school and was co-financed by TV3 and Broadcasting Authority of Ireland&#x27;s Sound and Vision Fund. It debuted in December 2008. In 2009, TV3 produced &quot;Laura Windermere&#x27;s Bag&quot;, a contemporary adaptation of the Oscar Wilde play &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;, set in the south of Dublin.

====Soap opera====

In late 2009, following the cancellation of RTÉ&#x27;s critically acclaimed medical drama series &quot;The Clinic&quot; TV3 speculated at reviving the show as a soap rather than a serial. TV3 later confirmed it would not seek to revive the show.

TV3 tendered for a production company to produce a new weekly soap for the channel, which would air from 2015.

==On-air presentation==
===September 1998 – July 2000===
The original logo and design for the channel were devised by Dynamo. In the lead-up to the network&#x27;s launch, TV3&#x27;s logo was unveiled during promotion ads on RTÉ and TG4. The logo consisted of a redesigned number 3. The upper half of the 3 was separated from the lower half; the two halves came together to form two swooshing arches that would form the 3. There were a number of different idents from September 1998 to July 2000 including &#x27;Bubbles&#x27;, &#x27;Camera Lenses&#x27;, &#x27;Robot&#x27;, &#x27;Umbrella&#x27;, &#x27;Fan&#x27;, &#x27;Planets&#x27;, &#x27;Children&#x27;s Toy&#x27;, &#x27;Bumper Cars&#x27; and &#x27;Roller-Coaster&#x27;. Each of the idents would end with a girl whispering the word &#x27;three&#x27; a number of times.

===July 2000 – September 2003===
In July 2000, TV3 developed new idents. The new idents removed the words &#x27;TV&#x27; and &#x27;three&#x27; from beneath the stylized 3 logo. The project was directed by Dynamo&#x27;s creative head of broadcast media, Brian Williams. These were TV3&#x27;s first idents to feature live action – actors would be seen in the background of the logo doing various day-to-day activities with the 3 logo spinning around to reveal itself. In 2001, some of these idents would have characters from Granada TV programming appear in the background, such as characters from &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; and &quot;Heartbeat&quot;.

===September 2003 – March 2006===
In September 2003, TV3 again launched a new set of idents. Again, this series of idents consisted of live action scenes. The final scene would see a large &#x27;swoosh&#x27; effect in the center of the screen with the 3 logo appearing in the centre of the screen. These idents consisted of outdoor activities such as a walk at the beach, children playing football, children playing, people walking over the Ha&#x27;penny Bridge etc. The presentation package was produced by Bruce Dunlop Associates.

===March 2006 – January 2009===
In March 2006, TV3 took steps to rebrand, as Channel 6 launched in an attempt to become a competitor in the Irish market. These idents consisted of live action scenes often involving the number 3 such as three drops of water into a river. The 3 logo now moved from just the stylized 3 into three circles with the stylized 3 in the last circle. The presentation package was produced by Cleverality.

===January – August 2009===
In January 2009, TV3 unveiled its new station logo – a simple sans-serif number 3 similar in style to that of TV3&#x27;s logo. This revamp coincided with the launch of 3e. Officially, the TV3 logo is that of a box with a 3 cut out of the right hand side – this design is used on all news programmes. However, the idents consisted of a set of simple graphical 3s in a domino effect with different colours such as grey, purple and blue. The idents were produced by Image Now.

===August 2009 – August 2011===
Between August 2009 and February 2010 TV3 introduced 8 new idents. The first two idents – known as &#x27;Orchard&#x27; and &#x27;Escalator&#x27; – launched TV3&#x27;s live action idents. In September, a third ident entitled &#x27;Wave&#x27; was added, followed in October by a fourth ident known as &#x27;Bridge&#x27;. An edited version of the Bridge ident (to promote the series &quot;V&quot;), a sixth new ident known as &#x27;Dog&#x27; was introduced in November 2009 and in December 2009 the ident &#x27;snowman&#x27; was added and in February 2010 the 8th ident was added, &#x27;bubbles&#x27;. TV3 has been working with Image Now to create these idents.

===August 2011 – January 2015===

On Monday, 22 August 2011, TV3 revealed a new on-air look. While utilising its existing logo, TV3 revealed new idents which are computer-generated and based around specific themes (e.g.: crime, urban, entertainment). The new look idents were designed by Image Now, who have previously worked on the channel&#x27;s branding since 2009.

===January 2015 – December 2016===
On Monday, 5 January 2015, TV3 revealed a new on-air look to coincide with its new programming. Originally the new idents consisted of only two idents. Gradually TV3 added additional idents featuring TV3 presenters. One of the original idents features a neon TV3 logo in a purple room and the second ident features a scene from its new soap &quot;Redrock&quot;. The slogan &#x27;We Entertain&#x27; features heavily on-air and in promos.

===January 2017 – August 2018===
On 6 December 2016, it was announced that TV3, along with 3e and its newly purchased channel UTV Ireland, will receive new logos, idents and new schedules. New Director of Programming Bill Malone announced that TV3 will become a more mature channel. &quot;TV3 will become the premium channel, the grown up channel and 3e will become, well, what TV3 is now&quot;.

On 9 January 2017, TV3 Group revealed a new on-air presentation featuring the number 3 superimposed on various natural and urban landscapes across Ireland. A new logo was also revealed along with new promos and on-screen graphics. Similarly, new identities were introduced to 3e and its new station be3.

===August 2018 – present===

On 28 June 2018, it was announced that TV3 will become Virgin Media One, while its sister channels 3e and be3 will become Virgin Media Two and Three respectively. A fourth pay TV sports channel will also become available on the Virgin Media platform, called Virgin Media Sport.

On 2 September 2024, the channel got a new look following the rebrand of Virgin Media Player as Virgin Media Play, there were only two idents at launch, featuring glass and ribbons forming the logo. A third ident featuring marbles forming the logo was introduced in October 2024.

===Continuity announcers===
TV3&#x27;s continuity is largely pre-recorded unlike its competitor RTÉ One. Taragh Loughrey-Grant began as a continuity presenter on TV3 in 1999 and was the voice of TV3 until 2005, where she later moved onto radio and then onto Channel 6 (prior to TV3 Group purchasing the channel). She then went onto present RTÉ Ten from 2008 onward and regularly contributes to RTÉ Radio and television.

Conor Clear and Andrea Hayes followed as continuity presenters. In 2008, TV3 introduced in-vision continuity links during the &quot;3 Daytime&quot;. Hayes began as a guest on the &quot;Midday&quot; panel in summer 2013. She also works on Dublin&#x27;s Sunshine FM. Conor Clear also acts as a weather presenter. Clare McKenna is a voiceover artist and has been working for TV3 since 2006. In 2013, McKenna begun a career as television presenting on &quot;Ireland AM&quot; whilst covering for Anna Daly when she was on her maternity leave. Upon Daly&#x27;s, return McKenna left &quot;Ireland AM&quot; so she could take up her own maternity leave. McKenna returned to TV3 in late 2014 reprising her role as a voice-over for TV3 promotions.

Daytime in-vision continuity lasted until the end of 2009.

==Controversies==
===Lack of original programming===
In the early years of TV3, many media commentators criticised the lack of original programming on the station. Since 2008, TV3 has increased its production of Irish programming. The view of many commentators such as Stephen Price of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and Tom McGurk of &quot;The Sunday Business Post&quot; is that TV3 needs to differentiate itself in the growing Irish multi-channel market by making more original programming.

===&quot;Play TV&quot; and &quot;Brainbox&quot;===

&quot;Play TV&quot; was an interactive phone-in quiz show on TV3; it ran from May 2009 until March 2010.

On 21 September 2009, callers to the &quot;Liveline&quot; radio show on RTÉ Radio 1 complained about the phone charges and methods surrounding TV3&#x27;s late night quiz show &quot;Play TV&quot;. Host Joe Duffy stated that many of his listeners and callers to the show had not got a satisfactory reply from TV3 in relation to their complaints and hence his reason for this section of his show, and that TV3 was unwilling to be a part of the discussion show having been asked by RTÉ Radio. Some of the contestants had not been paid their prize money. TV3 advised viewers who played the game to go to RegTel with any complaints.

On 25 September 2009, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) met to review 20 complaints made to it by individuals in relation to Play TV; 15 were upheld, one was rejected, one was determined to be invalid and two remained under investigation.

In January 2010, the compliance committee of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland upheld 10 more complaints against TV3. In February, the BAI upheld three more complaints.

On 5 March 2010, TV3 announced that Play TV&#x27;s contract was terminated immediately. In their statement, they put the removal of the &quot;infomercial&quot; down purely to audience figures rather than the complaints received and upheld by the BAI. They did not apologise for their conduct.

At the launch of TV3&#x27;s Autumn (18 August 2010) schedule, David McRedmond (CEO of TV3) was interviewed by &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. He admitted mistakes had been made but and admitted that &quot;Play TV&quot; was axed not just due to falling audience figures but also to the bad press and the regulator&#x27;s constant scrutiny of the show. He still refused to apologise to viewers on behalf of TV3, again stating that &quot;it was an essential part of getting us through the recession&quot;, regardless of what the BAI called a &quot;misleading and unfair&quot; programme.

&quot;Brain Box&quot; is an interactive phone-in quiz show on UTV and STV. As part of the 2010 Autumn schedule, TV3 announced the re-broadcast of UTV&#x27;s &quot;Brainbox&quot; TV show. The show began airing on TV3 on 9 September 2010, just 7 months after the axing of the controversial &quot;Play TV&quot;. It ceased broadcasting less than a week later.

===Health of Brian Lenihan===
On Saturday, 26 December 2009, TV3 News announced that it had been informed that the then Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan was suffering from a serious illness. The announcement was made according to TV3 as it was for the public good, but many people were outraged at the way it was announced on TV3.

Senior government sources spoke of &quot;outrage&quot; across the political spectrum at the insensitive content and tone of a news bulletin broadcast, which the station had earlier flagged as a &quot;news story of national importance&quot;. However, the station&#x27;s decision was defended by &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and the political magazine &quot;The Phoenix&quot;. The BAI ruled in favour of TV3 in relation to this announcement, rejecting all 14 complaints made against TV3 to the regulator.

TV3 at the time also stated that the bulletin was a normal bulletin that would normally run at 5:30. However TV3 are not known to have produced a news bulletin on St. Stephens&#x27; Day (a bank holiday in Ireland) and since 2006 had reduced weekend bulletins to five minutes.

===&quot;Psychic Readings Live&quot;===

&quot;Psychic Readings Live&quot; was a phone-in programme broadcast June–December 2012. It was much criticised for some apparently faked callers and psychics and for playing on the hopes and fears of some viewers. Complaints about it were upheld by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, and it was cancelled in December 2012.

<text>ezboard, Inc., based in San Francisco, California, United States, was a provider of free and paid hosted Internet forums.

==Description==
ezboard was a provider of a free hosted message board for use by webmasters and message board administrators who have little to no experience running a web site. Along with having premade ezboard templates and a color picking tool, the ezboard community also supports volunteers who will help other users customize their ezboards.

ezboard offered free and paid accounts for both boards and users. The free accounts were supported through advertisements, and had fewer features in regards to customization and board management. Paid members were called &quot;ezSupporters&quot;, while paid message boards were referred to as &quot;Gold boards&quot;. Accounts were either local (deprecated) and tied to a specific board, or global, which could be used for posting across the entire ezboard network.

==History==

ezboard is a web application, created in 1996 by Vanchau Nguyen. One of the earliest user-customisable online message board providers, it quickly grew. Around its peak in 2001, it was in the top 50 most popular websites in the world. 

In 2001 ezboard launched their first CSC (Community-Supported Communities) product, i.e. a paid version of ezboard without advertisements. This later split into CSC Blue (officially called CSC Community) and CSC Gold (officially called CSC Gold Community). CSC Blue removed intrusive advertising popups but retained advertising banners for a fixed price, while CSC Gold was 100% ad-free with extra features, but at a variable cost. It was reported that some very large ezboards paid the fixed price for CSC Blue, which ultimately proved to be an unprofitable product. ezboard announced that as of August 31, 2001 they would no longer renew CSC Blue boards.

In 2002 ezboard introduced image hosting, which was provided by a third party and not in-house by ezboard. Announcements followed, which showed the image hosting deal to be an unfortunate disaster. Eventually, the parent company filed for bankruptcy, leaving ezboard to continue operation of the image hosting in-house, while developing a new hosting product in parallel. A later announcement highlighted a miscommunication between ezboard staff and moderators with an admission that the image hosting service had been a bad decision.

On October 22, 2002, ezboard version 7.0 was released. This included a number of changes to free boards, which were met with negative comments from free board administrators. 7.0 also included enhanced user profiles, a redesigned web site and a new-look control center.

On December 10, 2002, ezboard version 7.1 was released, which included the ezPost tool. This provided users with fast access to useful posting features, such as changing font sizes and inserting links. However, some admins were unhappy that users could now post in a variety of fonts and colors, thereby altering the look and feel of their boards. This divided feedback was very common on ezboard due to the large number of users.

On March 11, 2003, ezboard version 7.2 was released. This was the last version of the core ezboard product to contain new features for nearly four years. After 7.2, various patches were applied to other areas of the ezboard service, such as spellcheck, free gold, meetup, and network performance and improvements.

In January 2004, a SQL Based back-end created by Jordan Bortz began to be rolled out to all servers. This upgrade significantly enhanced performance and reliability; issues which had been significantly impacting ezboard previously.

On March 4, 2004, Robert Labatt was appointed as ezboard&#x27;s new CEO. Vanchau Nguyen later chose to leave ezboard but remained on the Board of Directors. Vanchau left in April 2004 according to his linkedin page.

On March 14, 2005, ezboard 7.32 was released. This is the most recent numbered version to be released to all servers, although patches have been released since then.

On May 31, 2005, ezboard claimed they were hacked, causing many boards to lose information, become inaccessible, or be completely wiped. Ezboard indicated that it was &quot;impossible to restore all data to all boards&quot;. Assistance was requested from the FBI and $5,000 was offered for &quot;information that leads to the direct arrest and conviction of the hacker&quot;.

On February 28, 2007, ezboard staff posted about a new version of ezboard 7.33. Although this was primarily to compile the patches made since version 7.32, several small enhancements were also mentioned - the first to the message boards since version 7.2, released on March 11, 2003. Users did not expect this move as moderators had often stated that ezboard would no longer be updated. On May 1, 2007, these changes were officially announced, although there was no mention of 7.33. Therefore, the latest version of ezboard is still 7.32.

==ezboard and Yuku==
Yuku was the successor to ezboard. It has been alpha/beta software since it was first unveiled at DEMOfall 2005. On January 9, 2008, it was confirmed that Yuku was &quot;coming out of beta&quot;, although a date has not been set.

As of January 8, 2008, it has been confirmed that all ezboard communities would be moving to Yuku. However, board owners can ask for a delay in the migration process.

As of January 15, 2008, the ezboard home page redirects to a Yuku Welcome page. A link allows users to log into ezboard.

ezboard switched all its boards to Yuku.

On September 8, 2011, Yuku was acquired by CrowdGather, Inc. The acquisition included all legacy ezboard domains.

==Technology==

ezboard was written in Smalltalk VisualWorks 3.1 by Vanchau Nguyen with Jay O&#x27;Connor. There was no database used on the back-end, but instead a built-in flat-file object-oriented datastore (BOSS) which together with the overall power of the Smalltalk language made the code fast and compact for the time.

ezboard used a flat file system consisting of binary objects. It had no relational database. Attempts were made to migrate the database to a traditional RDBMS but attempts failed because they were too slow. ezboard was an early form of a NoSQL style database as the objects were essentially JSON type data (key-value pairs). The flat files were stored in deep nested directory structures

Ezboard&#x27;s creator, Vanchau Nguyen, said he had &quot;bet his company, and his future, on Cincom Smalltalk&quot;. He also mentions ezboard&#x27;s userbase, listed as having nearly 20 million registered users.

Kep C. Kepler was the 1st CIO and director of technology.

<doc id="427248" wikidata="Q935960" url="?curid=427248" title="TV3 (Catalan TV channel)">
<text>TV3 () is the primary television channel of Catalan public broadcaster Televisió de Catalunya, a subsidiary of the CCMA. TV3 broadcasts programmes only in Catalan and Aranese, with an optional dual track in the original language for some foreign-language series and movies, although Spanish is not dubbed or subtitled. TV3 is also a founding member of FORTA.

It is funded by the regional autonomous government, the Generalitat de Catalunya, through the CCMA.

==History==
TV3 started its trial broadcasts on 10 September 1983 (a day right before the National Day of Catalonia), but its regular broadcasts started a few months later, on 16 January 1984. TV3 was the first television channel to broadcast only in Catalan. In 1985, TV3 expanded its coverage to Andorra, Northern Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and the Valencian Community, also Catalan-speaking territories. Since 1985, Montse Armengou Martín has co-directed award-winning documentary films. One year later, TV3 inaugurated its new headquarters in Sant Joan Despí, near Barcelona.

Since 1987, TV3 has broadcast a second audio channel on almost all foreign-language series and movies with the original program audio, first using the Zweikanalton system and currently using NICAM. Local series and movies are usually broadcast in NICAM stereo, although sometimes an audio narration track for blind and visually impaired viewers is provided instead. On other occasions, an Aranese language track is provided.

In 1988, TV3 started a decentralization process, first broadcasting programs in the Aranese dialect of Occitan for the Aran Valley and, one year later, opening branch offices in Tarragona, Girona and Lleida and creating the &quot;Telenotícies Comarques&quot;, a regional news program broadcast simultaneously in five different editions, one for each of the four Catalan provinces and a fifth one for Aran, the former four being united into one national broadcast in 2017.

In 1995, Televisió de Catalunya launched &quot;TVCi&quot;, a satellite channel that broadcasts a selection of programs from TV3, El 33, 3/24, and Esports 3 through the Astra and Hispasat satellites (renamed to TV3CAT from June 2009). The channel ceased to broadcast via satellite on 1 May 2012. Still, it continues to broadcast on cable TV throughout Spain, especially in the Balearic Islands (via DVB-T) and on the internet.

In 2002, broadcasts started using the digital terrestrial television system. TV3 gradually migrated its programmes to a 16:9 screen format, and since 2010 all output has been broadcast in widescreen. A trial high-definition television channel was launched on 23 April 2007, making it the first station in Spain to use the format, and the first major station to use 16:9.

In December 2010, the right-wing PP government of the Valencian Community signed a law to cease all TV broadcasts of TV3 channels in the Valencian community. Five years later, in 2016, the new Valencian socialist government presided by Ximo Puig signed a reciprocity agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya, according to which TV3 would be broadcast again in the Valencian community while À Punt would be broadcast in Catalonia; however, this was never realised due to the Spanish government&#x27;s refusal to provide the necessary feed.

==Current programming==
TV3&#x27;s current (2017-2018) schedule contains a wide array of programmes:
* Informational programs, both daily (&quot;Telenotícies&quot;), weekly (&quot;30 minuts&quot;, &quot;Sense ficció&quot; and &quot;Preguntes freqüents&quot;) and specialized (like &quot;Valor afegit&quot;, about finance and economy and &quot;Quatre gats&quot;, interviews to international politicians)
* Self-produced series in different genres, such as &quot;Merlí&quot; (teen drama), &quot;Benvinguts a la família&quot; (comedy) or &quot;No pot ser!&quot; (technology).
* Morning and talk-shows (&quot;Els Matins&quot;, &quot;Tot es mou&quot;)
* Humor programs, clip shows (&quot;Polònia&quot;, &quot;Està passant, Alguna Pregunta Més?, Zona Zàping&quot;)
* Travel programs (&quot;Cases d&#x27;algú&quot;, &quot;Catalonia Experience&quot;)
* Culinary programs (&quot;Cuines&quot;)
* Sport programs (&quot;Hat Trick&quot;). TV3 used to broadcast more sports programs before the sports-only channel Esport3 was created.
* Realities (&quot;Joc de cartes,&quot; &quot;Persona Infiltrada or Eufòria&quot;).

TV3 also broadcasts some programming in Aranese, some only for the Aran Valley, and some in all broadcast territories.

===News and current affairs===
Daily news information is served by &quot;Telenotícies&quot;, which usually gets the highest ranking in both timeslots (14:30 and 21:00), and the &quot;Telenotícies comarques&quot; at 14:00 on weekdays. All of them include a very highly regarded weather bulletin, and the nightly edition of &quot;Telenoticies&quot; includes a short economic bulletin. All &quot;Telenoticies&quot; are simulcast by TVC&#x27;s news-only channel, 3/24. The morning news, from 6:00 to 8:00 on weekdays, and from 6:00 to 9:30 or 10:00 on weekends and the summer, are simulcasted from 3/24&#x27;s news bulletins.

&quot;30 minuts&quot; TV3&#x27;s oldest weekly news magazine and has been on the air continuously since 1984. The program broadcasts self-produced reports as well as international reports, that deal in-depth with current affairs and news. &quot;30 minuts&quot; self-produced reports have won several awards, both locally and internationally.

==Criticisms and controversies==
Since the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia reform referendum, including the 2006 Generalitat elections and the June 2007 municipal elections, all the electoral information during a campaign broadcast by TV3 news programmes is unsigned as TV3 (and most Catalan) reporters object to the rules that assign the air time of each political party and the order they air in the order of electoral seats won at the previous election (the more seats, the more airtime and first on air) and not based on objective and professional criteria. On several occasions, journalists&#x27; unions have denounced those known as &quot;electoral blocks&quot; imposed by the Electoral Board. These are propaganda spaces of the political parties and, according to the News Council of public channels such as TV3, TVE, and BTV (Barcelona Televisió), do not comply with the principles of impartiality, pluralism, and neutrality, so in each election campaign, the spectators can see how the journalists have placed a badge on which they put &quot;Fora Blocs&quot; (not to the electoral blocks).

On the other hand, political parties and civil organisations have also criticized that TV3 serves the Catalan nationalist sector as a political tool and does not fairly represent different opinions on the question of national identity in Catalonia. Likewise, some mainstream newspapers have also published several articles criticizing TV3 for favoring the views of the Catalan Government or empathizing with the independentism movement International observers have noticed these same newspapers have enthusiastically supported the constitutionalist (anti-independence) campaign, which lead those newspapers, ideologically related to the Spanish right-wing, to try to raise doubts about the observers&#x27; actions.

However, a study by the Consell de l’Audiovisual de Catalunya (Catalonia&#x27;s Audiovisual Council), an independent regulating institution elected by the Catalan Parliament, concluded that TV3 is the television that gives the most neutral and balanced political coverage, giving voice to both the pro-independence parties and those opposed to it, unlike other channels (like TVE, Telecinco or Antena 3), which only showed a partial constitutionalist view of the issue. As an example, 97.9% of TVE&#x27;s talk-show guests defended the referendum was illegal, while TV3 had guests defending different views of the issue: that of the referendum being legal, illegal but legitimate and illegal. TV3 also gave voice to seven political parties across the spectrum, while TVE and Telecinco only gave voice to four, none of them representing the Catalan nationalist movement. Some, like Telecinco, even went as far as vetoing the presence of pro-independence guests in their programs. TV3&#x27;s plurality has also been confirmed by neutral international observers. CAC once again called TV3 the most plural in November 2018. According to their study, they gave voice to 30 different political groups.

The public budget for TV3 and Catalunya Ràdio in 2013 was 295.9 million euros both surpassing any public media of Spain, and has been criticized on several occasions the high cost of TV3. In 2023 its budget was of 275.5 million euros. In 2024 it was of 341.7 million, and it&#x27;s expected in 2025, 2026 and 2027 will be of a minimum of 330.5 million, 335.5 million and 340.5 million respectively.

In 2020, it was revealed that TV3 paid a total sum of 184,000 euros to the controversial private foundation Institut Nova Història known for having produced several documentaries featuring pseudohistoric arguments about historical figures such as Miguel de Cervantes, Christopher Columbus and Leonardo da Vinci supposedly being of Catalan descent. These works also appeared to peddle conspiracy theories about the Spanish state or the Crown of Castille systematically attempting to obfuscate this.

==Presentation==
TV3 has had three different logos since its inception. The first one was created by the advertising agency Ogilvy and consisted of the name of the station set in a modified version of the font Peignot, with the 3 altered to look like a waving senyera, Catalonia&#x27;s flag.
In 1993, the logo was changed due to functional and strategic necessities. The new logo was designed by Josep M. Trias and introduced the red triangle made of four lines which as well as representing the Catalan flag, resembled a &quot;play&quot; button and the shape of the country. This logo evolved again in 2005 into the current logo dropping the &quot;TV&quot; and strengthening the presence of the 3, from the hand of the advertising agency Gédeón, which won the designing pitch.

In 2003 and 2008, special logos were created to celebrate TV3&#x27;s 20th and 25th anniversaries respectively. The 20th-anniversary logo features the 1993-2005 TV3 logo enclosed in a red background on which is printed the words &quot;Vint Anys&quot; (&quot;Twenty Years&quot; in Catalan), while the 25th-anniversary logo features a modified version of the current TV3 logo in which the &quot;3&quot; is drawn in a rather childish manner and on the right is printed the words &quot;Vint-I-Cinc&quot; (&quot;Twenty-five&quot; in Catalan)

==Audience and ratings==
In the 2000s, TV3 was the most watched TV channel in Catalonia. At the top of the list is TV3&#x27;s daily news program, &quot;Telenotícies&quot;. The daily soap opera &quot;El Cor de la Ciutat&quot; was the most watched fiction program in Catalonia, especially among the female audience, drawing around 28-33% of the audience with as much as 40% on season finales, followed by political satire program &quot;Polònia&quot;, with a share of about 28% Morning talk show &quot;Els Matins&quot; gets around 22% share. In recent years the channel&#x27;s share has started to fall, as many other channels, due to TDT. In May 2013 it had fallen to a 13.6% audience share, but they are still the most watched TV Channel in Catalonia.

According to a (Catalonia&#x27;s Audiovisual Council) report of 2006, Catalans think TV3 is the most politically impartial channel, the one which informs best, and the one with the best family and sports programming. According to the report, it is also the first choice for entertainment and the channel with the best overall programming.

According to &quot;El Pais&quot;, 36% of the Catalan households watch TV3&#x27;s News Program, making it the most popular channel within Catalonia as far as news coverage is concerned. TV3 audiences audience grew by 40% in October 2017.

==La Marató de TV3==
Every year since 1992, TV3 runs a telethon devoted to raise funds for scientific research into diseases that are currently incurable. Each year the &quot;Marató&quot; is devoted to one incurable illness and the benefits of it are given to fund research projects, audited by the Medical Technology and Research Evaluation Agency. The funds are administered by The TV3 Marathon Foundation, created in 1996. &quot;La Marató de TV3&quot; is the highest grossing telethon in Spain. In its 25 years of story, La Marató has grossed €170,325,725.

The annual telethon have covered the following diseases:

<text>SVT1 (SVT Ett; commonly referred to as Ettan) is the primary television station of the Swedish public service broadcaster Sveriges Television in Sweden.

==History==
Television in Sweden officially launched on 4 September 1956 with the launch of &quot;Radiotjänst TV&quot;, renamed &quot;Sveriges Radio TV&quot; a year later. It would take a few years before achieving national coverage. From 1955 to 1958, Danish television carried a program in Swedish (&quot;Sydsvenska journalen&quot;) aiming at viewers in Skåne until the link with Stockholm was finished in 1958.

The arrival of a second television network, TV2, led to the first channel relaunching as &quot;TV1&quot; in 1969, remaining under the Sveriges Radio banner. In connection with the new system, the channel appointed Håkan Unsgaard as its director, and &quot;Aktuellt&quot; was replaced by &quot;TV-nytt&quot;, broadcasting on both channels (Aktuellt returned to TV1 in 1972). The old &quot;TV0&quot; was shut down on November 29, 1969 and the new TV1 started the following day. Among the programs shown on the launch night of the renamed service was a special variety show (Cabaret Canalhumorn) with Povel Ramel and Hans Alfredson. Full-time colour broadcasting started in 1970 before both networks were placed under the management of Sveriges Television (SVT) on 1 July 1979.

To encourage competition between the two channels, &quot;TV1&quot; relaunched as &quot;Kanal 1&quot; on 31 August 1987 with the entirety of its homegrown programming produced in Stockholm, including the national news and current affairs programme &quot;Aktuellt&quot; (&quot;Current&quot;). Organizationally, these changes were launched on July 1, less than two months before the rebrand was made official. The merger of the teams behind the two channels created a larger team for Kanal 1. Such merger allowed rationings that, over time, led to an increase in programming time. Kanal 1 got its drama unit, Kanal 1 Drama, which became the largest drama producer in the Nordic region. Increased competition from commercial channels, including TV4, led to another relaunch as SVT1 in 1996, incorporating programming produced from across the country again.

A major corporate revamp in 2001 saw the channel repositioned as SVT&#x27;s flagship network to make it the most-watched television station in Sweden - a position previously held by SVT2. As part of the revamp, TV2&#x27;s popular news programme &quot;Rapport&quot; (&quot;Report&quot;) moved to the first network while &quot;Aktuellt&quot; moved to the second network.

Alongside &quot;Rapport&quot;, SVT&#x27;s main entertainment shows air on the first channel, including &quot;Melodifestivalen&quot;, &quot;Så ska det låta&quot; and &quot;På spåret&quot; are broadcast on this channel.

In October 2006, some programs on SVT1 began to be broadcast in HDTV format via the channel SVT HD. In June 2008, SVT HD started broadcasting upscaled programs from SVT1 when there were no HD programs available.

On August 25, 2008, a further change was made. The biggest change, which received a lot of criticism, was that &quot;Bolibompa&quot;&#x27;s 6pm broadcast, after more than twenty years on SVT1, as well as more programs from the children&#x27;s range, were moved to Barnkanalen. At the same time, regional news moved to SVT1, which made it possible to move SVT2&#x27;s pre-evening block with news, regional news and Go&#x27;kväll to SVT1.

On September 7, 2009, SVT1 became a 24-hour broadcasting channel when the nightly simulcast with SVT24 was replaced by essentially repeats.

On June 17, 2010, SVT received permission from the government to start broadcasting two HDTV channels in the digital terrestrial network. On September 20, 2010, SVT HD was discontinued and replaced by a full-time simulcast of SVT1 in HDTV format. On November 1, HD broadcasts began in the terrestrial network in several locations.

==Logos and identities==

=== 1956 to 1969 ===
Initially known as &quot;Radiotjänst TV&quot;, the channel was renamed as &quot;Sveriges Radio TV&quot; after its parent company. It was usually referred to as &quot;TV&quot; for short, as it was the only television service available at the time.

During the 1960s, the television service usually used the Sveriges Radio logo as identification. It was designed by Karl-Erik Forsberg and is still in use by Sveriges Radio. At start up and closedown, the service used an ident slide consisting of an art deco version of central Stockholm, with the Stockholm City Hall in the centre.

=== 1969 to 1980 ===
When a second channel launched in December 1969, &#x27;Sveriges Radio TV&#x27; was renamed TV1. As colour television arrived a year later, TV1 started using a blue background behind their logo.

=== 1980 to January 1996 ===
TV1 and TV2 became part of Sveriges Television in 1980. The new company received a new logo a year later, designed by Sid Sutton, with similarly designed logos for both networks.

On screen, the TV1 and TV2 logos were usually seen accompanying picturesque slides of the country and the station clock, although in-vision continuity was generally favoured for most junctions.

The &quot;Kanal 1&quot; revamp in 1987 saw the introduction of a computer-animated ident featuring Stockholm landmarks surrounding the logo. In-vision continuity was abandoned in favour of out-of-vision presentation over captions, although in-vision returned during the Christmas holidays, usually for the annual Christmas Eve continuity shift, handled by veteran broadcaster Arne Weise.

Full-time in-vision continuity returned as part of a further revamp in 1994, two years before both networks launched a new look.

===January to October 1996===

===October 1996 to 2001===

The initial graphics for SVT1 and SVT2 were replaced a year later with a predominantly blue theme.

=== 2001 to 2008 ===
In 2001, a corporate rebranding by Timothy Wilkinson and Darrell Pockett from English &amp; Pockett led to a further revamp, featuring SVT&#x27;s new &quot;starflower&quot; logo. A warmer orange and red theme was adapted for the first network and updated two years later. The SVT logo consisted of an orange square with the numeral &quot;1&quot; in the Myriad font next to the starflower.

All SVT presentation switched to widescreen in 2007.

=== 2008 to 2016 ===
SVT1 underwent another relaunch on 25 August 2008, designed by Stockholm-based &quot;Liberty&quot;. While the new look did not feature the corporate logo, SVT1&#x27;s idents featured a violet rectangle theme centred around a TV screen - the new graphics were designed by Dallas Sthlm.

A review of SVT presentation led to the end of in-vision continuity on the network on Sunday 4 March 2012 - the last announcer to appear on camera was Justine Kirk. SVT1 now utilises out-of-vision announcers.

=== 2016–present ===
==Programming==
On weekdays, a typical broadcast day on SVT1 begins with the breakfast programme &quot;Morgonstudion&quot; (lit., &quot;The Morning Studio&quot;) followed by a mix of repeats of the previous night&#x27;s primetime lineup, films, TV series, magazine shows, and documentaries throughout the day as well as live sport. The main evening schedule usually airs from around 5pm (17:00) until midnight with the main 25-minute edition of &quot;Rapport&quot; at 7:30pm (19:30), alongside shorter bulletins at 6pm (18:00) and later in the evening. Repeat programming airs throughout the night.

SVT1 is usually the channel for annual events of national significance such as the announcement and awarding of the various Nobel Prizes and the Eurovision Song Contest.

===Regional programming===
Since August 2008, SVT1 also broadcast regional news programming, including opt-outs in &quot;Morgonstudion&quot;, a main 15-minute bulletin at 6:30pm (18:30) and a mid-evening update at 7:55pm (19:55). Stories from SVT&#x27;s regional newsrooms also feature in the national programme &quot;Sverige idag&quot; (&quot;Sweden Today&quot;) on weekdays. As of April 2015, there are 21 regional news services, under the &quot;SVT Nyheter&quot; banner, although most are pre-recorded from centralised studios.

<text>SVT2 (SVT Två; commonly referred to as Tvåan), is one of the two main television channels broadcast by Sveriges Television in Sweden.

Launched in 1969 by Sveriges Radio, the channel was until the 1990s the most watched in Sweden but now serves as SVT&#x27;s specialist television network, carrying more highbrow and minority programming compared to the more mainstream SVT1.

==History==

Debate persisted throughout the 1960s over a second Swedish television channel, following the opening of &quot;Radiotjänst TV&quot; (later &quot;Sveriges Radio TV&quot;) in 1956. Some wanted the new channel to be private and funded by advertising, but it was decided that the public service broadcaster, Sveriges Radio, would take responsibility. Sweden was the second Nordic country to launch a second TV channel, after Finland who did it in March 1965.

&quot;TV2&quot; began broadcasting on Friday 5 December 1969 - an occasion known widely as the &quot;channel split&quot; (&quot;kanalklyvningen&quot;). While TV1 was broadcast on VHF frequencies, TV2 used UHF frequencies, which meant that households had to buy a special converter box if they wanted to see TV2.

Although TV2 was part of the same company as TV1, they were both editorially independent and encouraged to compete with each other. Both channels later agreed not to compete directly with similar programmes. For example, the weekend variety shows were aired on TV2 on Friday nights and TV1 on Saturday nights.

Both channels also shared a national news service, &quot;TV-nytt&quot;, which broadcast short bulletins at 7 pm and 9 pm on TV2 (6 pm, 7.30 pm, and 10 pm on TV1) - accompanying this on TV2 was &quot;Rapport&quot;, a 20-minute news magazine emphasising in-depth reports, analysis, and commentary. The initial format gave rise to accusations of left-wing bias with TV2 described by some as &quot;the red channel&quot;. A revamp in 1972 saw &quot;Rapport&quot; move to 7.30 pm and introduce a broader format, eventually establishing the programme as the most-watched Swedish television news.

The use of UHF frequencies also allowed TV2 to broadcast regional programming for the first time. In November 1970, the first regional news bulletin, &quot;Sydnytt&quot; (covering Scania and Blekinge, was launched. In July 1979, both TV1 and TV2 were placed under the management of Sveriges Television (SVT).

Having gradually introduced regional news services across the country, TV2 was relaunched as the &quot;Sweden Channel&quot; (&quot;Sverigekanalen&quot;) on 31 August 1987. As part of a reorganisation, the network&#x27;s homegrown output consisted largely of programming from SVT&#x27;s regional production centres (there were ten of them in total, the biggest of them being Gothenburg and Malmö), although some Stockholm-produced output continued, including &quot;Rapport&quot;.

The revamp helped to establish TV2 as the most-watched television network in Sweden, although by 1994, the channel lost its lead to commercial network TV4. The increasing competition led to a relaunch as SVT2 in 1996, with programming from both Stockholm and the regional centres now shared between both channels. Among the changes, the 6 pm edition of SVT1&#x27;s news service &quot;Aktuellt&quot; moved to the channel, while &quot;Rapport&quot; launched breakfast and lunchtime editions, but also moved some of its shorter bulletins to SVT1.

== Logos and identities ==
=== 2001 to 2008 ===
A major corporate revamp in 2001 saw SVT2 repositioned as a more specialist channel with SVT1 taking a broader, mainstream profile. As part of the revamp, &quot;Rapport&quot; moved to the first network and the less popular &quot;Aktuellt&quot; moved to SVT2, initially airing twice nightly at 6 pm and 9 pm. Regional news bulletins continued on SVT2 as before.

Other popular programming on the network (such as &quot;&quot;) also moved to SVT1, although an effort was made to boost audiences with new programming schedules in 2003. In-vision continuity was abandoned in January 2005 in favour of pre-recorded announcements.

=== 2008 to 2016 ===
A further revamp in August 2008 saw all regional news services moved to SVT1. &quot;Aktuellt&quot; relaunched as an in-depth current affairs programme, until March 2012, when the programme was extended to an hour on Mondays-Thursdays, incorporating extended news coverage, sport and a late regional news bulletin.

=== 2016-present ===
==Programming==
Programming on SVT2 is generally more specialist than on the primary SVT1. The station&#x27;s output includes most of SVT&#x27;s cultural programming, minority output in the Sami and Finnish languages, sign language programming, independent films, current affairs and parliamentary coverage.

<text>The Lys () or Leie () is a river in France and Belgium, and a left-bank tributary of the Scheldt. Its source is in Pas-de-Calais, France, and it flows into the river Scheldt in Ghent, Belgium. Its total length is .

Historically a very polluted river from the high population density and industrialisation in both Northern France and Belgium, it has seen substantial improvements in recent years, partly due to the decline of the principal industry, the spinning and weaving of flax. The region of the Leie (between Deinze and Ghent) was known as a favourite place for numerous painters in the first half of the 20th century.

The source of the Lys is in a village, Lisbourg, east of Fruges, in the Pas-de-Calais department of France. It flows generally northeast through the following departments of France, provinces of Belgium and towns and municipalities:

*Pas-de-Calais (F): Thérouanne, Aire-sur-la-Lys
*Nord (F): Merville, Armentières, Halluin
*Hainaut (B): Comines-Warneton
*West Flanders (B): Menen, Wevelgem, Kortrijk, Waregem, Wervik
*East Flanders (B): Zulte, Deinze, Ghent

The main tributaries of the Leie are, from source to mouth: Laquette, Clarence, Lawe, Deûle, , , and Mandel.

The river was the location of three battles between the Allies and the German Army during the two world wars. During the First World War in 1918 the location was the scene of the First Battle of the Lys, which was part of the German Spring Offensive and later that year of the Second Battle of the Lys, which was part of the Allies&#x27; Hundred Days Offensive. During the Second World War, the Battle of the Lys was part of the 1940 German offensive in Flanders towards the English Channel.

== History ==
The Leie/Lys was a commercial navigation from the Middle Ages, but it was the river&#x27;s devastating floods rather than navigation improvements which justified major works and meander cut-offs started around 1670. The 9 meter difference in elevation between Aire-sur-la-Lys and the border was gradually overcome by six locks and weirs, completed in 1780. The river carried a heavy traffic in grain and linen through to Ghent and Antwerp. The navigation was leased out to a company around 1825, and the locks upgraded to 5.20 m wide, for a draught of 1.60 m. In December 1899, more than 40 schoolchildren skating on the frozen river at Frelinghien fell through the ice and drowned.

The river was given its present depth by the Freycinet programme. The section below Armentières was enlarged to class III from 1930, and the border section was improved to class Va starting from 1960. This section is part of the EU&#x27;s priority project 30 for the Seine-Escaut waterway. The upstream section, by contrast, is used almost exclusively by recreational craft, and is at present heavily silted.

<text>Wuxi (, ) is a city in southern Jiangsu, China. As of the 2024 census, it had a population of 7,495,000. The city lies in the southern Yangtze delta and borders Lake Tai. Notable landmarks include Lihu Park, the Mt. Lingshan Grand Buddha Scenic Area and its -tall Grand Buddha at Ling Shan statue, Xihui Park, Wuxi Zoo, and the Wuxi Museum. Transportation options include Wuxi Shuofang Airport, Wuxi Metro, Shanghai–Nanjing intercity high-speed railway, and Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway. Wuxi is home to Jiangnan University.

==Etymology==
Despite varied origin stories based on the second Chinese character 锡 of the city&#x27;s name meaning &quot;tin&quot;, many modern Chinese scholars favor the view that the word is derived from the &quot;old Yue language&quot; or, supposedly, the old Kra–Dai languages, rather than reflecting the presence of tin in the area.

==History==
Clues are to be found at the Meili Museum and the Helv Relics Museum, Wuxi is the ancient capital of Wu State during the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BCE). Taibo and Zhongyong traveled southeast and settled in Wuxi Meili. There, Taibo and his followers set up the State of Wu, and made Wuxi as its founding capital which lasted for 600 years. The history of Wuxi can be traced back to Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BC).
The tin industry thrived in the area in ancient times but it was eventually depleted, so that when Wuxi was established in 202 BCE during the Han dynasty, it was named &quot;Wuxi&quot; (the capital of Wu commandery). Administratively, Wuxi became a district of Biling (later Changzhou) and only during the Yuan dynasty (1206–1368) did it become an independent prefecture. Wuxi and Changzhou are considered to be the birthplaces of modern industrialization in China.

Agriculture and the silk industry flourished in Wuxi and the town became a transportation hub under the early Tang Dynasty after the opening of the Grand Canal in 609. It became known as one of the biggest markets for rice in China.

The Donglin Academy, originally founded during the Song dynasty (960–1279) was restored in Wuxi in 1604. Not a school, it served as a public forum, advocating a Confucian orthodoxy and ethics. Many of its academicians were retired court officials or officials deposed in the 1590s due to factionalism.

As a populous county, its eastern part was separated and made into Jinkui County in 1724. Both Wuxi and Jinkui were utterly devastated by the Taiping Rebellion, which resulted in nearly 2/3 of their population being killed. The number of &quot;able-bodied males&quot; (&quot;ding&quot;, ) were only 72,053 and 138,008 individuals in 1865, versus 339,549 and 258,934 in 1830.

During the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), cotton and silk production flourished in Wuxi. Trade increased with the opening of ports to Shanghai in 1842, and Zhenjiang and Nanjing in 1858. Wuxi became a center of the textile industry in China. Textile mills were built in 1894 and silk reeling establishments known as &quot;filatures&quot; were built in 1904. Wuxi has remained the regional center for the waterborne transport of grain. The opening of the railways to Shanghai and to the cities of Zhenjiang and Nanjing to the northwest in 1908 further increased the exports of rice from the area. Jinkui County merged into Wuxi County with the onset of the Republic in 1912.
Many agricultural laborers and merchants moved to Shanghai in the late 19th century and early 20th century; some prospered in the new factories.
After World War II, Wuxi&#x27;s importance as an economic center diminished, but it remains a regional manufacturing hub. Tourism has increasingly become important. On April 23, 1949, Wuxi was divided into Wuxi City and Wuxi County, and it became a provincial city in 1953 when Jiangsu Province was founded. In March 1995, several administrative changes were made within Wuxi City and Wuxi County to accommodate for Wuxi New District, with the creation of 19 administrative villages such as Shuofang, Fangqian, Xin&#x27;an and Meicun. Jiangnan University was originally founded in 1902, before merging with two other colleges in 2001 to form the modern university.

== Administrative divisions ==
The prefecture-level city of Wuxi administers seven county-level divisions, including 5 districts and 2 county-level cities. The information here presented uses the metric system and data from the 2020 Census.

These districts are sub-divided into 73 township-level divisions, including 59 towns and 24 subdistricts.
==Economy==

Wuxi has a relatively developed economy since ancient times. In 1895, Yang Zonglian and Yang Zonghan founded the first national capital enterprise, Yeqin Cotton Mill, outside the south gate of Wuxi. Subsequently, many enterprises with textile, silk and grain processing industries as the main body were born and developed rapidly. Wuxi became One of the birthplaces of national industry and commerce. During this process, many &quot;firsts&quot; and &quot;most&quot; in the history of Wuxi&#x27;s modern industrial development were born; batches of industrial and commercial giants including the Rong family and the Tang family were born, and it also demonstrated the entrepreneurship of Wuxi&#x27;s national industrial and commercial entrepreneurs. After the reform and opening up, private enterprises in Wuxi developed vigorously on the basis of the southern Jiangsu model represented by township industries. Well-known 
companies such as &quot;Technology&quot; all transformed during this period. And since July 1993, Taiji Industry was the first private enterprise listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange as a listed company in Jiangsu Province.

== Business ==
As an important commercial center in East China, it has always been famous for its unique geographical location and historical background. Wuxi&#x27;s commercial development has a long and prosperous history, and it has played a vital role in the local economic and social development.

The earliest commercial development in Wuxi can be traced back to the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, when commercial activities were already carried out here. With the evolution of history, Wuxi has gradually become a transportation hub and commercial center in the Jiangnan area. Wuxi is located on the shore of Taihu Lake and has convenient transportation. It has been a distribution center for silk, tea, rice and other commodities since ancient times. Today, Wuxi Commerce has developed into a diversified economic system dominated by service industries and high-tech industries.

<text>The White River is an American two-forked river that flows through central and southern Indiana and is the main tributary to the Wabash River. Via the west fork, considered to be the main stem of the river by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, the White River is long. Indiana&#x27;s capital, Indianapolis, is located along the river. The two forks meet just north of Petersburg and empty into the Wabash River at Mount Carmel, Illinois.

==West Fork==

The West Fork, long, is the main fork of the river. Federal maps refer to it simply as the White River, per a 1950 Board on Geographic Names decision. It starts south of Winchester in Randolph County at 40° 04&#x27; 46&quot; N, 84° 55&#x27; 58&quot; W in Washington Township. The river winds through Muncie, Anderson, Noblesville, and Indianapolis before being joined by the east fork in the triad of Daviess, Knox, and Pike counties. Along the way it passes by three Indiana state parks: Mounds State Park, near Anderson; White River State Park, in downtown Indianapolis; and McCormick&#x27;s Creek State Park, near Spencer. In Indianapolis the Wapahani Trail follows the eastern bank; the Miami tribe had called the river Wapahani, meaning “white sands” or waapikamiiki.

==East Fork==

The East Fork or Aankwaahsakwa Siipiiwi in the native Miami-Illinois language starts in Columbus at the confluence of the Driftwood and Flatrock rivers. The headwaters of the main stem (&quot;West Fork&quot;) of the White River are in fact farther east than those of the East Fork. The East Fork flows a total of generally southwest, passing the city of Seymour, then flowing through rugged terrain before reaching the West Fork.

The East Fork White River has an approximate discharge of per second below the mouth of Lick Creek.

Eventually, the East Fork continues eastward to its source under different names: the &quot;Flatrock River&quot;, the &quot;Driftwood River&quot;, and the &quot;Big Blue River&quot;.

==Lower river==
Below the junction of the East Fork, the White River flows another between Gibson, Knox, and Pike counties before draining into the Wabash River at the Indiana–Illinois border next to Mount Carmel, Illinois, in the vicinity of where the Grand Rapids Dam and Grand Rapids Hotel used to exist. The total White River basin watershed exceeds .

==Recreation==
While river quality is threatened by pollution, including overflow sewage from Indianapolis and other cities, many recreational activities take place on the White River, including fishing, kayaking, and canoeing. The White River Yacht Club is a boating club that utilizes pontoon boats, and a section of the river in northern Indianapolis has both riverside cottages and pontoon boats. The river is not deep enough in many stretches to support conventionally-keeled sailing or power boats.

==Pollution==
In 1997, the White River was listed as one of the United States’ most threatened rivers.

Pesticides (herbicides and insecticides) are used extensively in the White River basin. Application of herbicides to corn and soybeans accounts for most of the use. The pesticides most frequently detected near the mouth of the White River during 1991–1995 were the herbicides alachlor, atrazine, cyanazine, and metolachlor.

The highest concentrations of herbicides in the river were typically found during late spring runoff following application. Generally, concentrations of alachlor have been decreasing while concentrations of acetochlor have been increasing in response to changes in the use of these herbicides in the basin.

The total amount of the commonly used herbicides transported by the river is about 1% or less of the amount applied to cropland. Insecticides commonly used in urban and agricultural areas also were found but in much lower concentrations than commonly used herbicides.

In 1999, the West Fork experienced a massive fish kill that spread for with an estimated loss of 4.6 million fish (187 tons). The kill was traced back to Guide Corp, an automotive parts maker in Anderson, which had discharged of the chemical HMP 2000 into the river. Guide Corp eventually reached a settlement whereby the company would pay a total of $14.2 million in fines, penalties, legal expenses, and river restoration. Many animals that had burrowed into the mud were protected from the chemical, and by March 2000, some fish were naturally returning to the affected area. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources conducted a restocking program in October. The city of Anderson announced in 2002 that it would invest millions of dollars for improvements to its sewage treatment system. Ten years after the fish kill, officials with the DNR stated that the White River was in better condition than before the environmental disaster. Stones along the bank of the river are still bleached, and are a reminder of the chemical spill.

<doc id="427274" wikidata="Q4176314" url="?curid=427274" title="ZTV (Swedish TV channel)">
<text>ZTV was a Swedish television channel owned by Viasat. Launched in February 1991, as a daily afternoon show on TV3 and TV4, it became a channel of its own on Swedish cable networks in May 1992. The intention was to create a Swedish version of MTV and thus the focus was primarily on music, but also had their own comedy-oriented shows, skate and prank related shows and aired various tv shows and movies. Since May 2006, most of its programming composed of music videos. ZTV&#x27;s last day was August 1, 2010 for all customers except for Boxer and Com Hem, who continued to distribute the channel indefinitely in a limited version. MTG&#x27;s new sports channel TV10 took over the transmissions of other operators.

==History==
ZTV was initially also a combined radio station called Z-Radio. The sound from the television programme went out also in radio through a number of community radio frequencies around the country. ZTV began broadcasting on their own channel position in 1992 and was owned by MTG, who also owned TV3 (Sweden) and TV6 (Sweden). Aside from music videos the channel featured many shows produced in Sweden. Although they were low budget they also featured new ideas and many of them received cult status. Most of the presenters went on to become stars on the major networks with ZTV being viewed as a breeding ground for new talent.

For a few years, there was a Danish ZTV, but it eventually merged with Danish TV6 to form TV3+ and was closed down in 1996. There were also plans to merge the Swedish ZTV with the Swedish TV6, but this never materialised.

As the years went on, ZTV moved from Stockholm to London and started broadcasting US imports such as &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. ZTV started broadcasting 24 hours a day in 2000. In 2002, a Norwegian version of ZTV launched, ZTV Norway.

September 2004 marked a significant change in style for the channel. Instead of being a youth channel, ZTV would now target men. As a result, most of the in-house ZTV shows were cancelled and replaced by Champions League football and wrestling.

In May 2006, MTG started a new channel called TV6. This channel took over most of the programming from ZTV, as well as its frequencies in the cable networks and its subscribers. This meant that ZTV lost all of its distribution.

In late 2006, MTG started a new online venture to allow ZTV to become a youth channel again. ZTV was converted into a multimedia platform (online TV, mobile and broadcasting) with a focus on online TV. A new short TV format (short video clips) introduced to be broadcast on ztv.se including live broadcasting of E-sports (electronic sports) with the possibility of betting on e-sports matches such as Counter Strike. 

In late 2007, ZTV started to broadcast various anime series such as &quot;Berserk&quot;, &quot;Black Lagoon&quot;, &quot;Ergo Proxy&quot;, &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;, &quot;Gungrave&quot;, &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;, &quot;Paranoia Agent&quot;, and &quot;Samurai Champloo&quot;.

There was also a Z magazine available for some time.

<doc id="427277" wikidata="Q1410998" url="?curid=427277" title="Parallel key">
<text>In music theory, a major scale and a minor scale that have the same starting note (tonic) are called parallel keys and are said to be in a parallel relationship. For example, G major and G minor have the same tonic (G) but have different modes, so G minor is the parallel minor of G major. This relationship is different from that of relative keys, a pair of major and minor scales that share the same notes but start on different tonics (e.g., G major and E minor).

A major scale can be transformed to its parallel minor by lowering the third, sixth, and seventh scale degrees, and a minor scale can be transformed to its parallel major by raising those same scale degrees.

In the early nineteenth century, composers began to experiment with freely borrowing chords from the parallel key.

In rock and popular music, examples of songs that emphasize parallel keys include Grass Roots&#x27; &quot;Temptation Eyes&quot;, The Police&#x27;s &quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic&quot;, Lipps Inc&#x27;s &quot;Funkytown&quot;, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Norwegian Wood,&quot; and Dusty Springfield&#x27;s &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have To Say You Love Me&quot;.

<doc id="427280" wikidata="Q6735422" url="?curid=427280" title="Maiden speech">
<text>A maiden speech is the first speech given by a newly elected or appointed member of a legislature or parliament.

Traditions surrounding maiden speeches vary from country to country. In many Westminster system governments, there is a convention that maiden speeches should be relatively uncontroversial, often consisting of a general statement of the politician&#x27;s beliefs and background rather than a partisan comment on a current topic.

This convention is not always followed, however. For example, the maiden speeches of Pauline Hanson in the Australian House of Representatives in 1996, Fraser Anning in the Australian Senate in 2018 and Richard Nixon in the United States House of Representatives in 1947, broke the tradition. Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s maiden speech in the House of Commons in 1959 included the successful introduction of the bill which became the Public Bodies (Admission to Meetings) Act 1960.

There is also a strong convention in some countries, such as in the Netherlands, that maiden speeches should not be subjected to interruption or interjection, and should not be attacked or dismissed by subsequent speakers. Another convention in the British House of Commons is that a Member of Parliament will include tribute in a maiden speech to previous incumbents of their seat.

Some countries, notably Australia, no longer formally describe a politician&#x27;s first speech as a &quot;maiden&quot; speech, referring only to it as a &quot;first&quot; speech. The Australian Parliament website and Hansard records no longer use &#x27;maiden&#x27; as a term, but the word remains common in discourse and colloquial use.

<doc id="427282" wikidata="Q252973" url="?curid=427282" title="Mutual information">
<text>In probability theory and information theory, the mutual information (MI) of two random variables is a measure of the mutual dependence between the two variables. More specifically, it quantifies the &quot;amount of information&quot; (in units such as shannons (bits), nats or hartleys) obtained about one random variable by observing the other random variable. The concept of mutual information is intimately linked to that of entropy of a random variable, a fundamental notion in information theory that quantifies the expected &quot;amount of information&quot; held in a random variable.

Not limited to real-valued random variables and linear dependence like the correlation coefficient, MI is more general and determines how different the joint distribution of the pair formula_1 is from the product of the marginal distributions of formula_2 and formula_3. MI is the expected value of the pointwise mutual information (PMI).

The quantity was defined and analyzed by Claude Shannon in his landmark paper &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;, although he did not call it &quot;mutual information&quot;. This term was coined later by Robert Fano. Mutual Information is also known as information gain.

== Definition ==
Let formula_1 be a pair of random variables with values over the space formula_5. 
The mutual information formula_6 between formula_2 and formula_3 can be defined as 

where formula_9 denotes entropy and formula_10 denotes conditional entropy. By the chain rule, we also have formula_11formula_12formula_13formula_14.

If the joint distribution of formula_2 and formula_3 is formula_17 and the marginal distributions are formula_18 and formula_19, the mutual information also equals

( P_{(X,Y)} \| P_{X} \otimes P_{Y} )&lt;/math&gt;
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
where formula_20 is the Kullback–Leibler divergence, and formula_21 is the outer product distribution which assigns probability formula_22 to each formula_23.

Notice, as per property of the Kullback–Leibler divergence, that formula_6 is equal to zero precisely when the joint distribution coincides with the product of the marginals, i.e. when formula_2 and formula_3 are independent (and hence observing formula_3 tells you nothing about formula_2). formula_6 is non-negative, it is a measure of the price for encoding formula_1 as a pair of independent random variables when in reality they are not.

If the natural logarithm is used, the unit of mutual information is the nat. If the log base 2 is used, the unit of mutual information is the shannon, also known as the bit. If the log base 10 is used, the unit of mutual information is the hartley, also known as the ban or the dit.

=== In terms of PMFs for discrete distributions ===
The mutual information of two jointly discrete random variables formula_2 and formula_3 is calculated as a double sum:

where formula_17 is the joint probability &quot;mass&quot; function of formula_2 and formula_3, and formula_18 and formula_19 are the marginal probability mass functions of formula_2 and formula_3 respectively.

=== In terms of PDFs for continuous distributions ===
In the case of jointly continuous random variables, the double sum is replaced by a double integral:

where formula_17 is now the joint probability &quot;density&quot; function of formula_2 and formula_3, and formula_18 and formula_19 are the marginal probability density functions of formula_2 and formula_3 respectively.

== Motivation ==
Intuitively, mutual information measures the information that formula_2 and formula_3 share: It measures how much knowing one of these variables reduces uncertainty about the other. For example, if formula_2 and formula_3 are independent, then knowing formula_2 does not give any information about formula_3 and vice versa, so their mutual information is zero. At the other extreme, if formula_2 is a deterministic function of formula_3 and formula_3 is a deterministic function of formula_2 then all information conveyed by formula_2 is shared with formula_3: knowing formula_2 determines the value of formula_3 and vice versa. As a result, the mutual information is the same as the uncertainty contained in formula_3 (or formula_2) alone, namely the entropy of formula_3 (or formula_2). A very special case of this is when formula_2 and formula_3 are the same random variable.

Mutual information is a measure of the inherent dependence expressed in the joint distribution of formula_2 and formula_3 relative to the marginal distribution of formula_2 and formula_3 under the assumption of independence. Mutual information therefore measures dependence in the following sense: formula_71 if and only if formula_2 and formula_3 are independent random variables. This is easy to see in one direction: if formula_2 and formula_3 are independent, then formula_76, and therefore:

:formula_77

Moreover, mutual information is nonnegative (i.e. formula_78 see below) and symmetric (i.e. formula_79 see below).

== Properties ==
=== Nonnegativity ===
Using Jensen&#x27;s inequality on the definition of mutual information we can show that formula_80 is non-negative, i.e.
:formula_78

=== Symmetry===
:formula_79
The proof is given considering the relationship with entropy, as shown below.

=== Supermodularity under independence===
If formula_83 is independent of formula_84, then
:formula_85.

=== Relation to conditional and joint entropy ===
Mutual information can be equivalently expressed as:

:formula_86

where formula_87 and formula_88 are the marginal entropies, formula_89 and formula_90 are the conditional entropies, and formula_91 is the joint entropy of formula_2 and formula_3.

Notice the analogy to the union, difference, and intersection of two sets: in this respect, all the formulas given above are apparent from the Venn diagram reported at the beginning of the article.

In terms of a communication channel in which the output formula_3 is a noisy version of the input formula_2, these relations are summarised in the figure:

Because formula_80 is non-negative, consequently, formula_97. Here we give the detailed deduction of formula_98 for the case of jointly discrete random variables:

:formula_99

The proofs of the other identities above are similar. The proof of the general case (not just discrete) is similar, with integrals replacing sums.

Intuitively, if entropy formula_88 is regarded as a measure of uncertainty about a random variable, then formula_90 is a measure of what formula_2 does &quot;not&quot; say about formula_3. This is &quot;the amount of uncertainty remaining about formula_3 after formula_2 is known&quot;, and thus the right side of the second of these equalities can be read as &quot;the amount of uncertainty in formula_3, minus the amount of uncertainty in formula_3 which remains after formula_2 is known&quot;, which is equivalent to &quot;the amount of uncertainty in formula_3 which is removed by knowing formula_2&quot;. This corroborates the intuitive meaning of mutual information as the amount of information (that is, reduction in uncertainty) that knowing either variable provides about the other.

Note that in the discrete case formula_111 and therefore formula_112. Thus formula_113, and one can formulate the basic principle that a variable contains at least as much information about itself as any other variable can provide.

=== Relation to Kullback–Leibler divergence ===
For jointly discrete or jointly continuous pairs formula_1, mutual information is the Kullback–Leibler divergence from the product of the marginal distributions, formula_115, of the joint distribution formula_116, that is,

Furthermore, let formula_117 be the conditional mass or density function. Then, we have the identity

The proof for jointly discrete random variables is as follows:
:formula_118
Similarly this identity can be established for jointly continuous random variables.

Note that here the Kullback–Leibler divergence involves integration over the values of the random variable formula_2 only, and the expression formula_120 still denotes a random variable because formula_3 is random. Thus mutual information can also be understood as the expectation of the Kullback–Leibler divergence of the univariate distribution formula_122 of formula_2 from the conditional distribution formula_124 of formula_2 given formula_3: the more different the distributions formula_124 and formula_122 are on average, the greater the information gain.

=== Bayesian estimation of mutual information ===

If samples from a joint distribution are available, a Bayesian approach can be used to estimate the mutual information of that distribution. The first work to do this, which also showed how to do Bayesian estimation of many other information-theoretic properties besides mutual information, was. Subsequent researchers have rederived and extended 
this analysis. See for a recent paper based on a prior specifically tailored to estimation of mutual
information per se. Besides, recently an estimation method accounting for continuous and multivariate outputs, formula_3, was proposed in 

=== Independence assumptions ===
The Kullback-Leibler divergence formulation of the mutual information is predicated on that one is interested in comparing formula_130 to the fully factorized outer product formula_131. In many problems, such as non-negative matrix factorization, one is interested in less extreme factorizations; specifically, one wishes to compare formula_130 to a low-rank matrix approximation in some unknown variable formula_133; that is, to what degree one might have
: formula_134

Alternately, one might be interested in knowing how much more information formula_130 carries over its factorization. In such a case, the excess information that the full distribution formula_130 carries over the matrix factorization is given by the Kullback-Leibler divergence
:formula_137

The conventional definition of the mutual information is recovered in the extreme case that the process formula_138 has only one value for formula_133.

== Variations ==
Several variations on mutual information have been proposed to suit various needs. Among these are normalized variants and generalizations to more than two variables.

=== Metric ===
Many applications require a metric, that is, a distance measure between pairs of points. The quantity

:formula_140

satisfies the properties of a metric (triangle inequality, non-negativity, indiscernability and symmetry), where equality formula_141 is understood to mean that formula_2 can be completely determined from formula_3.

This distance metric is also known as the variation of information.

If formula_144 are discrete random variables then all the entropy terms are non-negative, so formula_145 and one can define a normalized distance

:formula_146

Plugging in the definitions shows that

:formula_147

This is known as the Rajski Distance. In a set-theoretic interpretation of information (see the figure for Conditional entropy), this is effectively the Jaccard distance between formula_2 and formula_3.

Finally,

:formula_150

is also a metric.

=== Conditional mutual information ===

Sometimes it is useful to express the mutual information of two random variables conditioned on a third.

( P_{(X,Y)|Z} \| P_{X|Z} \otimes P_{Y|Z} )]&lt;/math&gt;
|border
|border colour = #0073CF

For jointly discrete random variables this takes the form
:formula_151

which can be simplified as
:formula_152

For jointly continuous random variables this takes the form
:formula_153

which can be simplified as
:formula_154

Conditioning on a third random variable may either increase or decrease the mutual information, but it is always true that
:formula_155

for discrete, jointly distributed random variables formula_156. This result has been used as a basic building block for proving other inequalities in information theory.

=== Interaction information ===

Several generalizations of mutual information to more than two random variables have been proposed, such as total correlation (or multi-information) and dual total correlation. The expression and study of multivariate higher-degree mutual information was achieved in two seemingly independent works: McGill (1954) who called these functions &quot;interaction information&quot;, and Hu Kuo Ting (1962). Interaction information is defined for one variable as follows:
:formula_157

and for formula_158
:formula_159

Some authors reverse the order of the terms on the right-hand side of the preceding equation, which changes the sign when the number of random variables is odd. (And in this case, the single-variable expression becomes the negative of the entropy.) Note that
:formula_160

====Multivariate statistical independence ====
The multivariate mutual information functions generalize the pairwise independence case that states that formula_161 if and only if formula_162, to arbitrary numerous variable. n variables are mutually independent if and only if the formula_163 mutual information functions vanish formula_164 with formula_165 (theorem 2). In this sense, the formula_164 can be used as a refined statistical independence criterion.

==== Applications ====
For 3 variables, Brenner et al. applied multivariate mutual information to neural coding and called its negativity &quot;synergy&quot; and Watkinson et al. applied it to genetic expression. For arbitrary k variables, Tapia et al. applied multivariate mutual information to gene expression. It can be zero, positive, or negative. The positivity corresponds to relations generalizing the pairwise correlations, nullity corresponds to a refined notion of independence, and negativity detects high dimensional &quot;emergent&quot; relations and clusterized datapoints ).

One high-dimensional generalization scheme which maximizes the mutual information between the joint distribution and other target variables is found to be useful in feature selection.

Mutual information is also used in the area of signal processing as a measure of similarity between two signals. For example, FMI metric is an image fusion performance measure that makes use of mutual information in order to measure the amount of information that the fused image contains about the source images. The Matlab code for this metric can be found at. A python package for computing all multivariate mutual informations, conditional mutual information, joint entropies, total correlations, information distance in a dataset of n variables is available.

=== Directed information ===
Directed information, formula_167, measures the amount of information that flows from the process formula_168 to formula_169, where formula_168 denotes the vector formula_171 and formula_169 denotes formula_173. The term &quot;directed information&quot; was coined by James Massey and is defined as
:formula_174.

Note that if formula_175, the directed information becomes the mutual information. Directed information has many applications in problems where causality plays an important role, such as capacity of channel with feedback.

=== Normalized variants ===
Normalized variants of the mutual information are provided by the &quot;coefficients of constraint&quot;, uncertainty coefficient or proficiency:
:formula_176

The two coefficients have a value ranging in [0, 1], but are not necessarily equal. This measure is not symmetric. If one desires a symmetric measure they can consider the following &quot;redundancy&quot; measure:
:formula_177

which attains a minimum of zero when the variables are independent and a maximum value of
:formula_178

when one variable becomes completely redundant with the knowledge of the other. See also &quot;Redundancy (information theory)&quot;.

Another symmetrical measure is the &quot;symmetric uncertainty&quot; , given by
:formula_179

which represents the harmonic mean of the two uncertainty coefficients formula_180.

If we consider mutual information as a special case of the total correlation or dual total correlation, the normalized version are respectively,
:formula_181 and formula_182

This normalized version also known as Information Quality Ratio (IQR) which quantifies the amount of information of a variable based on another variable against total uncertainty:
:formula_183

There&#x27;s a normalization which derives from first thinking of mutual information as an analogue to covariance (thus Shannon entropy is analogous to variance). Then the normalized mutual information is calculated akin to the Pearson correlation coefficient,

:formula_184

=== Weighted variants ===
In the traditional formulation of the mutual information,

:formula_185

each &quot;event&quot; or &quot;object&quot; specified by formula_186 is weighted by the corresponding probability formula_187. This assumes that all objects or events are equivalent &quot;apart from&quot; their probability of occurrence. However, in some applications it may be the case that certain objects or events are more &quot;significant&quot; than others, or that certain patterns of association are more semantically important than others.

For example, the deterministic mapping formula_188 may be viewed as stronger than the deterministic mapping formula_189, although these relationships would yield the same mutual information. This is because the mutual information is not sensitive at all to any inherent ordering in the variable values (, , ), and is therefore not sensitive at all to the form of the relational mapping between the associated variables. If it is desired that the former relation—showing agreement on all variable values—be judged stronger than the later relation, then it is possible to use the following &quot;weighted mutual information&quot; .
:formula_190

which places a weight formula_191 on the probability of each variable value co-occurrence, formula_130. This allows that certain probabilities may carry more or less significance than others, thereby allowing the quantification of relevant &quot;holistic&quot; or &quot;Prägnanz&quot; factors. In the above example, using larger relative weights for formula_193, formula_194, and formula_195 would have the effect of assessing greater &quot;informativeness&quot; for the relation formula_188 than for the relation formula_189, which may be desirable in some cases of pattern recognition, and the like. This weighted mutual information is a form of weighted KL-Divergence, which is known to take negative values for some inputs, and there are examples where the weighted mutual information also takes negative values.

=== Adjusted mutual information ===
A probability distribution can be viewed as a partition of a set. One may then ask: if a set were partitioned randomly, what would the distribution of probabilities be? What would the expectation value of the mutual information be? The adjusted mutual information or AMI subtracts the expectation value of the MI, so that the AMI is zero when two different distributions are random, and one when two distributions are identical. The AMI is defined in analogy to the adjusted Rand index of two different partitions of a set.

=== Absolute mutual information ===
Using the ideas of Kolmogorov complexity, one can consider the mutual information of two sequences independent of any probability distribution:

:formula_198

To establish that this quantity is symmetric up to a logarithmic factor (formula_199) one requires the chain rule for Kolmogorov complexity . Approximations of this quantity via compression can be used to define a distance measure to perform a hierarchical clustering of sequences without having any domain knowledge of the sequences .

=== Linear correlation ===
Unlike correlation coefficients, such as the product moment correlation coefficient, mutual information contains information about all dependence—linear and nonlinear—and not just linear dependence as the correlation coefficient measures. However, in the narrow case that the joint distribution for formula_2 and formula_3 is a bivariate normal distribution (implying in particular that both marginal distributions are normally distributed), there is an exact relationship between formula_202 and the correlation coefficient formula_203 .
:formula_204

The equation above can be derived as follows for a bivariate Gaussian:
:formula_205

Therefore, 
:formula_206

=== For discrete data ===
When formula_2 and formula_3 are limited to be in a discrete number of states, observation data is summarized in a contingency table, with row variable formula_2 (or formula_210) and column variable formula_3 (or formula_212). Mutual information is one of the measures of association or correlation between the row and column variables.

Other measures of association include Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test statistics, G-test statistics, etc. In fact, with the same log base, mutual information will be equal to the G-test log-likelihood statistic divided by formula_213, where formula_214 is the sample size.

== Applications ==
In many applications, one wants to maximize mutual information (thus increasing dependencies), which is often equivalent to minimizing conditional entropy. Examples include:
* In search engine technology, mutual information between phrases and contexts is used as a feature for k-means clustering to discover semantic clusters (concepts). For example, the mutual information of a bigram might be calculated as:
{B}}{\frac{f_X}{U} \frac{f_Y}{U}} 
&lt;/math&gt;
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
: where formula_215 is the number of times the bigram xy appears in the corpus, formula_216 is the number of times the unigram x appears in the corpus, B is the total number of bigrams, and U is the total number of unigrams.
* In telecommunications, the channel capacity is equal to the mutual information, maximized over all input distributions.
* Discriminative training procedures for hidden Markov models have been proposed based on the maximum mutual information (MMI) criterion.
* RNA secondary structure prediction from a multiple sequence alignment.
* Phylogenetic profiling prediction from pairwise present and disappearance of functionally link genes.
* Mutual information has been used as a criterion for feature selection and feature transformations in machine learning. It can be used to characterize both the relevance and redundancy of variables, such as the minimum redundancy feature selection.
* Mutual information is used in determining the similarity of two different clusterings of a dataset. As such, it provides some advantages over the traditional Rand index.
* Mutual information of words is often used as a significance function for the computation of collocations in corpus linguistics. This has the added complexity that no word-instance is an instance to two different words; rather, one counts instances where 2 words occur adjacent or in close proximity; this slightly complicates the calculation, since the expected probability of one word occurring within formula_214 words of another, goes up with formula_214
* Mutual information is used in medical imaging for image registration. Given a reference image (for example, a brain scan), and a second image which needs to be put into the same coordinate system as the reference image, this image is deformed until the mutual information between it and the reference image is maximized.
* Detection of phase synchronization in time series analysis.
* In the infomax method for neural-net and other machine learning, including the infomax-based Independent component analysis algorithm
* Average mutual information in delay embedding theorem is used for determining the &quot;embedding delay&quot; parameter.
* Mutual information between genes in expression microarray data is used by the ARACNE algorithm for reconstruction of gene networks.
* In statistical mechanics, Loschmidt&#x27;s paradox may be expressed in terms of mutual information. Loschmidt noted that it must be impossible to determine a physical law which lacks time reversal symmetry (e.g. the second law of thermodynamics) only from physical laws which have this symmetry. He pointed out that the H-theorem of Boltzmann made the assumption that the velocities of particles in a gas were permanently uncorrelated, which removed the time symmetry inherent in the H-theorem. It can be shown that if a system is described by a probability density in phase space, then Liouville&#x27;s theorem implies that the joint information (negative of the joint entropy) of the distribution remains constant in time. The joint information is equal to the mutual information plus the sum of all the marginal information (negative of the marginal entropies) for each particle coordinate. Boltzmann&#x27;s assumption amounts to ignoring the mutual information in the calculation of entropy, which yields the thermodynamic entropy (divided by the Boltzmann constant).
* In stochastic processes coupled to changing environments, mutual information can be used to disentangle internal and effective environmental dependencies. This is particularly useful when a physical system undergoes changes in the parameters describing its dynamics, e.g., changes in temperature.
* The mutual information is used to learn the structure of Bayesian networks/dynamic Bayesian networks, which is thought to explain the causal relationship between random variables, as exemplified by the GlobalMIT toolkit: learning the globally optimal dynamic Bayesian network with the Mutual Information Test criterion.
* The mutual information is used to quantify information transmitted during the updating procedure in the Gibbs sampling algorithm.
* Popular cost function in decision tree learning.
* The mutual information is used in cosmology to test the influence of large-scale environments on galaxy properties in the Galaxy Zoo.
* The mutual information was used in Solar Physics to derive the solar differential rotation profile, a travel-time deviation map for sunspots, and a time–distance diagram from quiet-Sun measurements
* Used in Invariant Information Clustering to automatically train neural network classifiers and image segmenters given no labelled data.
* In stochastic dynamical systems with multiple timescales, mutual information has been shown to capture the functional couplings between different temporal scales. Importantly, it was shown that physical interactions may or may not give rise to mutual information, depending on the typical timescale of their dynamics.

<doc id="427283" wikidata="Q3209149" url="?curid=427283" title="Fortress Besieged">
<text>Fortress Besieged () is a Chinese satirical novel written by Qian Zhongshu (Ch&#x27;ien Chung-shu), first published in 1947, and widely considered one of the masterpieces of twentieth century Chinese literature. The novel is a humorous tale about middle-class Chinese society in the late 1930s. It gained worldwide popularity after it was reprinted in the 1980s and made into a television series in 1990.

==Origin and History==
Qian Zhongshu started writing the novel in 1944 and completed it in 1946. He began writing the book while he and his wife, Yang Jiang, were living in Shanghai during the Japanese occupation. According to Yang Jiang, the successful production of several of her plays inspired Qian to write a full-length novel.

Qian&#x27;s personal experiences abroad and in China inspired the characters and plot of the novel. For example, both Qian and the protagonist, Fang Hongjian, studied abroad in the mid-1930s. Furthermore, Qian&#x27;s journey through rural China during the war to teach at Lantian Normal College in Hunan in 1939 influenced Fang&#x27;s journey to San Lü University.

The title is based on a purportedly French proverb:

:Marriage is like a fortress besieged: those who are outside want to get in, and those who are inside want to get out. (&quot;Le mariage est une forteresse assiégée, ceux qui sont dehors veulent y entrer, ceux qui sont dedans veulent en sortir&quot;.)

The novel is known for its acerbic asides, such as describing one young lady in the following way:

:Others called her &quot;Truth,&quot; since it is said that &quot;the truth is naked.&quot; But Miss Pao wasn&#x27;t exactly without a stitch on, so they revised her name to &quot;Partial Truth.&quot;

Qian never completed another novel after the 1940s, shifting to writing research publications on classical Chinese literature. He began work on a second novel entitled &quot;Bai He Xin&quot; (), but the manuscript was lost when he and his family moved to Beijing in 1949.

==Publishing history==
The literary work was published in its original version in Shanghai during the year of 1947. The second edition was published in 1948. The third edition in 1949. After the Communist Revolution, the book was not reprinted in mainland China again until 1980. In the meantime, it was also banned in Taiwan because of its scathing satire of the Nationalist government.

Although the domestic distribution faced decades of restrictions under political sensitivity, the novel was translated and published and internationally distributed starting from the 1960s. Currently the novel is translated into languages such as English, French, German, Russian and Japanese.

==Plot summary==
Set in the 1930s, the novel follows the misadventures of Fang Hongjian. The book begins with Fang returning home to China after running out of money while studying abroad. It is revealed that his studies were financed by a family friend, but Fang Hongjian wasted his time aimlessly bouncing between European schools. Fang bought a fake degree to have something to show for his studies.

On board the &quot;Vicomte de Bragelonne&quot;, Fang meets Su Wenwan (), a young woman in her late 20s. She is quite pretty, if thin and pallid, but her pickiness means she is unmarried. He also meets the tanned and voluptuous Miss Pao (), whom Fang pursues with some success during the voyage. When the boat reaches Hong Kong Miss Pao disembarks into the embrace of her fiancé, a middle-aged balding doctor, and Fang realizes he has been used.

Fang returns to Shanghai and joins his family who are fleeing Japanese occupation. He encounters Su Wenwan, her cousin Tang Xiaofu (), and Su Wenwan&#x27;s suitor Zhao Xinmei (). Fang Hongjian wants to pursue Tang Xiaofu, but Su Wenwan expects him to propose to her instead. Zhao Xinmei also misinterprets Fang Hongjian&#x27;s intentions and sees him as a romantic rival. Their romantic ambitions are all foiled: Tang Xiaofu moves away and Su Wenwan marries another man. Eventually Fang Hongjian and Zhao Xinmei both receive job offers to teach at San Lü University in the countryside. Zhao Xinmei gathers other teachers hired by San Lü in order to make the journey from Shanghai as a group. The story the follows the group&#x27;s journey through the Chinese countryside to reach their new employer.

At the university Fang Hongjian develops a friendship with Zhao Xinmei and falls in love with assistant professor Sun Roujia (). All three characters become involved in the workplace politics of the faculty members. Eventually both Fang Hongjian and Zhao Xinmei are forced out of the university. Zhao Xinmei goes to Chengdu to work in the government. Fang Hongjian and Sun Roujia decide to return to Shanghai together and they marry each other en route.

The final part of the book centers around Fang Hongjian and Sun Roujia&#x27;s disastrous marriage. Extended family members frequently interfere in their lives and both of them are slighted by their respective in-laws. The two of them go through multiple rounds of arguing and reconciliation. After a particularly intense argument Sun Roujia leaves to stay with her aunt. The novel ends with Fang Hongjian listening to the chiming of a clock in the empty house.

==Influence==

The novel have been described by Jonathan Spence as &quot;a classic of world literature, a masterpiece of parodic fiction&quot; and the &quot;greatest Chinese novel of the twentieth century&quot;, while the literary critic C.T. Hsia has called &quot;Fortress Besieged&quot;, &quot;the most delightful and carefully wrought novel in modern Chinese literature&quot; and &quot;perhaps ... the greatest&quot;. The satiric and metaphorical novel echoed the multilayers of phenomenons faced by China. Aspects of the novel have entered the Chinese idiomatic lexicon. For example, the fictional &quot;Carleton University&quot; (), where the novel&#x27;s character obtained his bogus degree, is used as an idiom to signify an illegitimate foreign degree qualification or academic institution. Likewise, the novel&#x27;s title, deriving from the French proverb, has given rise to a similar saying in Chinese.

The novel also shed light on perspectives in topics such as identity, women, marriage, education and middle-class snobbery during the Chinese Republic period. Qian reflected on  &quot;harmony without uniformity&quot; in Sino-Western intercultural dialogue through incorporating cultural relativism and the principle of &quot;diversity&quot; in Fortress Besieged. The cross cultural references create literary and theoretical links between the West and the East in 20th century Chinese academic history. With the translated versions in majority speaking languages, the novel connects foreign and domestic readers to interpret the social complexities in China through relatable cultural references.

==Translation==
The novel has been translated into many languages. The translation was translated into English version by Nathan K. Mao () and Jeanne Kelly in 1979, a Russian version in 1979, a German version in 1982, a French version in 1987, and a Japanese version in 1988. In April 1980, the Indiana University Press published it. It was updated in 2004 by New Directions Publishing with an additional foreword by the historian Jonathan Spence.

<text>Christopher Bryan Moneymaker (born November 21, 1975) is an American poker player who won the Main Event at the 2003 World Series of Poker (WSOP). His 2003 win is said to have revolutionized poker because he was the first person to become a world champion after qualifying at an online poker site. This has been referred to in the press as the &quot;Moneymaker effect&quot;.

==Early life==
Moneymaker was born in Atlanta, Georgia. He attended Farragut High School in Knoxville, Tennessee, and later earned a master&#x27;s degree in accounting from the University of Tennessee. After receiving his master&#x27;s degree, Moneymaker worked as a comptroller. He was also a part-time employee at a local restaurant, in Spring Hill, Tennessee.

Moneymaker said that his ancestors made silver and gold coins and chose the name &quot;Moneymaker&quot; as a modification of their German last name, &quot;Nurmacher&quot;.

==Poker career==
===World Series of Poker===
Moneymaker was working as an accountant when he won a seat in the Main Event of the 2003 World Series of Poker through an $86 satellite tournament at the PokerStars online poker card room. Although largely unknown prior to the tournament, on day one of the tournament his skills caught the attention of professional sports handicapper Lou Diamond, who called Moneymaker his &quot;dark horse to win the whole tournament.&quot; Moneymaker went on to win the first prize of $2.5 million, instantly garnering poker superstar status. The 2003 WSOP Main Event was his first live poker tournament. One of Moneymaker&#x27;s most memorable hands was heads-up against Sam Farha, when on the river he bluffed &quot;all in&quot; with King high. Farha folded a pair of nines, quickly changing the momentum of the match. Moneymaker eventually won the tournament when his beat Farha&#x27;s on a board of , giving Moneymaker a full house () to Farha&#x27;s two pairs (). After winning the Main Event, he quit his job to serve as a celebrity spokesman for Series owner Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment as well as PokerStars. He also started his own company, Moneymaker Gaming, and began traveling to play in more numerous and larger buy-in tournaments.

His autobiography, &quot;Moneymaker: How an Amateur Poker Player Turned $40 into $2.5 Million at the World Series of Poker&quot; was published in March 2005. Eric Raskin, editor of &quot;All In Magazine&quot;, compiled an oral history of the 2003 WSOP Main Event, which included input from three dozen top poker personalities who were involved, also titled The &quot;Moneymaker Effect.&quot; As part of Moneymaker&#x27;s success, it appears that Moneymaker misremembered the buy-in to the satellite that he won on PokerStars, leading to the error in the title of his autobiography, which refers to winning a $40 satellite, rather than the correct figure of $86.

===Other poker tournaments===
On the World Poker Tour, Moneymaker finished second at the 2004 Shooting Stars event and won $200,000.

During Event 5 of the 2008 World Championship of Online Poker, which was a $10,300 buy-in of No Limit Hold&#x27;em, Moneymaker finished in sixth place, taking home over $139,000. He also did well in Event 16, the $215 Pot Limit Omaha with Rebuys, where he finished fifth, earning over $28,000.

Moneymaker won the Deep Stack Pot Limit Omaha event of the World Poker Open tournament in July 2009 and won $15,889.

Moneymaker placed 11th in the 2011 PokerStars Caribbean Adventure Main Event, earning $130,000.

In 2011 Moneymaker placed second at the National Heads-Up Poker Championship against Erik Seidel, earning $300,000.

As of 2022, his total live tournament winnings exceed $3,950,000, over $2,550,000 of which has come from the World Series of Poker.

In 2019, Moneymaker was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Moneymaker has been married twice. He and his first wife divorced in 2004; in an interview for a 10-year retrospective on the 2003 WSOP Main Event, he said &quot;The main reason was me wanting to be a traveling poker pro. She didn&#x27;t sign up for that life. She was married to a stay-at-home accountant who was not traveling the world, gone all the time, and gambling a lot of money. And it was a choice I had to make. I tried to be good, stay at my job, and be that accountant, but in all honesty I didn&#x27;t want to.&quot; With his first wife, Moneymaker has a daughter. He married again in 2005. , they live just outside of Memphis, Tennessee.

<text>The Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party (, PDCS) is a Christian-democratic political party in San Marino.

The PDCS is an observer member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), having joined the EPP in 1993. Its Italian counterpart was the now-dissolved Christian Democracy. Its internal left-wing faction left in 2006 to form the Centre Democrats and was joined by the social democrats of Arengo and Freedom. It is led by Giovanni Lonfernini, a former Captain-Regent.

In the 2006 general election PDCS won 32.9% of the vote and 21 out of 60 seats in the Grand and General Council. The party stood in opposition to the 2006-2008 governing political coalition of Party of Socialists and Democrats, Popular Alliance and United Left.

For the 2008 general election the party was part of the Pact for San Marino coalition and gave hospitality in its list to some candidates of the Euro-Populars for San Marino and Arengo and Freedom. The electoral coalition won 35 seats out of 60 in the Grand and General Council in the Sammarinese parliamentary election, 2008 gaining 54.22% of the national vote and a governmental majority of 5, becoming the new government of San Marino. The Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party which itself gained 22 seats (a few of which went to Euro-Populars for San Marino and Arengo and Freedom) out of the 35 coalition and gained 31.90% of the national vote. Ernesto Benedettini became one of the two Joint Captains Regent of San Marino.

A political crisis in 2011 dissolved the old majority, and the PDCS formed a government of national unity with the Party of Socialists and Democrats, whose predecessors worked with the PDCS for decades, so restoring a political formula which led San Marino, and Italy, during the second half of the 20th century. The new alliance, San Marino Common Good, won the Sammarinese election of 2012, PDCS obtaining 21 seats together with their electoral running-mates, We Sammarinese.

<text>A shark attack is an attack on a human by a shark. Every year, around 80 unprovoked attacks are reported worldwide. Despite their rarity, many people fear shark attacks after occasional serial attacks, such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916, and horror fiction and films such as the &quot;Jaws&quot; series. Out of more than 500 shark species, only three are responsible for a double-digit number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, tiger, and bull. The oceanic whitetip has probably killed many more shipwreck and plane crash survivors, but these are not recorded in the statistics. Humans are not part of a shark&#x27;s normal diet. Sharks usually feed on small fish and invertebrates, seals, sea lions, and other marine mammals. A shark attack will usually occur if the shark feels curious or confused.

== Terminology ==
While the term &quot;shark attack&quot; is in common use for instances of humans being wounded by sharks, it has been suggested that this is based largely on the assumption that large predatory sharks (such as great white, bull, and tiger sharks) seek humans as prey. A 2013 review recommends that only in instances where a shark clearly predates on a human should the bite incident be termed an &quot;attack,&quot; implying predation. Otherwise, it is more accurate to class bite incidents as &quot;fatal bite incidents&quot;. Sightings do include physical interaction, encounters including physical interaction with harm, shark bites include major shark bite incidents, including those that require medical attention, and fatal shark bite incidents that result in death. The study suggests that only where an expert validates the predatory intent of a shark would it be appropriate to term a bite incident an attack.

== Types of attacks ==
Shark attack indices use different criteria to determine if an attack was &quot;provoked&quot; or &quot;unprovoked.&quot; When considered from the shark&#x27;s point of view, attacks on humans who are perceived as a threat to the shark or a competitor to its food source are all &quot;provoked&quot; attacks. Neither the International Shark Attack File (ISAF) nor the Global Shark Attack File (GSAF) accord casualties of air/sea disasters &quot;provoked&quot; or &quot;unprovoked&quot; status. Rather, these incidents are considered a separate category. Postmortem scavenging of human remains (typically drowning victims) are also not accorded &quot;provoked&quot; or &quot;unprovoked&quot; status. The GSAF categorizes scavenging bites on humans as &quot;questionable incidents.&quot; The most common criteria for determining &quot;provoked&quot; and &quot;unprovoked&quot; attacks are discussed below:

=== Provoked attack ===
Provoked attacks occur when a human touches, hooks, nets, or otherwise aggravates the animal. Incidents that occur outside of a shark&#x27;s natural habitat, such as aquariums and research holding-pens, are considered provoked, as are all incidents involving captured sharks. Sometimes humans inadvertently provoke an attack, such as when a surfer accidentally hits a shark with a surf board.

=== Unprovoked attack ===
Unprovoked attacks are initiated by the shark—they occur in a shark&#x27;s natural habitat on a live human and without human provocation. There are three subcategories of unprovoked attack:
* Hit-and-run attack – usually non-fatal, the shark bites and then leaves; most victims do not see the shark. This is the most common type of attack and typically occurs in the surf zone or in murky water. Most hit-and-run attacks are believed to be the result of mistaken identity.
* Sneak attack – the victim will not usually see the shark, and may sustain multiple deep bites. This kind of attack is predatory in nature and is often carried out with the intention of consuming the victim. It is extraordinarily rare for this to occur.
* Bump-and-bite attack – the shark circles and bumps the victim before biting. Great whites are known to do this on occasion, referred to as a &quot;test bite&quot;, in which the great white is trying to identify what is being bitten. Repeated bites, depending on the reaction of the victim (thrashing or panicking may lead the shark to believe the victim is prey), are not uncommon and can be severe or fatal. Bump-and-bite attacks are not believed to be the result of mistaken identity.

An incident occurred in 2011 when a 3-meter long (~500 kg) great white shark jumped onto a 7-person research vessel off Seal Island, South Africa. The crew were undertaking a population study using sardines as bait and initially retreated to safety in the bow of the ship while the shark thrashed about, damaging equipment and fuel lines. To keep the shark alive while a rescue ship towed the research vessel to shore, the crew poured water over its gills and eventually used a pump for mechanical ventilation. The shark was ultimately lifted back into the water by crane and, after becoming disoriented and beaching itself in the harbor, was successfully towed out to sea. The incident was judged an accident.

== Reasons for attacks ==
Large shark species are apex predators in their environment, and thus have little fear of any creature (other than orcas) with which they cross paths. Like most sophisticated hunters, they are curious when they encounter something unusual in their territories. Lacking any limbs with sensitive digits such as hands or feet, the only way they can explore an object or organism is to bite it. These bites are known as test bites. Generally, shark bites are exploratory, and the animal will swim away after one bite. For example, exploratory bites on surfers are thought to be caused by the shark mistaking the surfer and surfboard for the shape of prey. Nonetheless, a single bite can grievously injure a human if the animal involved is a powerful predator such as a great white or tiger shark.

A shark will normally make one swift attack and then retreat to wait for the victim to die or weaken from shock and blood loss, before returning to feed. This protects the shark from injury from a wounded and aggressive target; it also allows humans time to get out of the water and survive. Shark attacks may also occur due to territorial reasons or as dominance over another shark species.

Sharks are equipped with sensory organs called the Ampullae of Lorenzini that detect the electricity generated by muscle movement. The shark&#x27;s electrical receptors, which pick up movement, detect signals like those emitted from wounded fish. For example, someone who is spearfishing, leading the shark to attack the person by mistake. According to George H. Burgess, director of the International Shark Attack File, &quot;Attacks are basically an odds game based on how many hours you are in the water&quot;.

== Statistics ==
According to the International Shark Attack File (ISAF), between 1958 and 2016 there were 2,785 confirmed unprovoked shark attacks around the world, of which 439 were fatal. Between 2001 and 2010, an average of 4.3 people per year died from shark attacks.

In 2000, there were 79 shark attacks reported worldwide, 11 of them fatal. In 2005 and 2006, this number decreased to 61 and 62 respectively, while the number of fatalities dropped to only four per year. The 2016 yearly total of 81 shark attacks worldwide was on par with the most recent five-year (2011–2015) average of 82 incidents annually. By contrast, the 98 shark attacks in 2015 was the highest yearly total on record. There were four fatalities worldwide in 2016, which is lower than the average of eight fatalities per year worldwide in the 2011–2015 period and six deaths per annum over the past decade. In 2016, 58% of attacks were on surfers.

Despite these reports, however, the actual number of fatal shark attacks worldwide remains uncertain. In most Third World coastal nations, no method of reporting suspected shark attacks exists. Therefore, losses and fatalities near-shore or at sea often remain unsolved or unpublicized.

Of these attacks, most occurred in the United States (53 in 2000, 40 in 2005, and 39 in 2006). &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in July 2008 that there had been only one fatal attack in the previous year. On average, there are 16 shark attacks per year in the United States, with one fatality every two years. According to the ISAF, the US states in which the most attacks have occurred are Florida, Hawaii, California, Texas and the Carolinas, though attacks have occurred in almost every coastal state.

Australia has the highest number of fatal shark attacks in the world, with Western Australia recently becoming the deadliest place in the world for shark attacks with total and fatal shark bites growing exponentially over the last 40 years. Since 2000, there have been 17 fatal shark attacks along the West Australian coast, with divers now facing odds of one in 16,000 for a fatal shark bite.

Other shark attack hotspots include Réunion Island, Boa Viagem in Brazil, Makena Beach in Maui, Hawaii, and Second Beach, Port St. Johns, South Africa. South Africa has a high number of shark attacks along with a high fatality rate of 27 percent.

As of 28 June 1992, Recife in Brazil began officially registering shark attacks on its beaches (mainly on the beach of Boa Viagem). Over more than two decades, 64 victims were attacked, of whom 26 died. The last deadly attack occurred on 10 July 2021. The attacks were caused by the bull shark and tiger shark species.
The shark attacks in Recife have an unusually high fatality rate of about 37%. This is much higher than the worldwide shark attack fatality rate, which is currently about 16%, according to Florida State Museum of Natural History. Several factors have contributed to the unusually high attack and fatality rates, including pollution from sewage runoff and a (now closed) local slaughterhouse.

The place with the most recorded shark attacks is New Smyrna Beach, Florida. Developed nations such as the United States, Australia and, to some extent, South Africa, facilitate more thorough documentation of shark attacks on humans than developing coastal nations. The increased use of technology has enabled Australia and the United States to record more data than other nations, which could somewhat bias the results. In addition, individuals and institutions in South Africa, the United States, and Australia keep a file which is regularly updated by an entire research team, the International Shark Attack File, and the Australian Shark Attack File.

The Florida Museum of Natural History compares these statistics with the much higher rate of deaths from other causes. For example, an average of more than 38 people die annually from lightning strikes in coastal states, while less than 1 person per year is killed by a shark in Florida. In the United States, the likelihood that a person who goes to beaches will be attacked by a shark is 1 in 11.5 million, and a person&#x27;s chance of getting killed by a shark is less than 1 in 264.1 million.

However, in certain situations the risk of a shark attack is higher. For example, in the southwest of Western Australia the chances of a surfer being fatally bitten by a shark in winter or spring are 1 in 40,000 and for divers it is 1 in 16,000. In comparison to the risk of a serious or fatal cycling accident, this represents three times the risk for a surfer and seven times the risk for a diver.

In comparison to previous years, ISAF reported a total of 57 unprovoked shark bites worldwide in 2022, which is lower than the past five-year average of 70 incidents annually. There were also 32 provoked bites, 4 boat bites, and a few other incidents classified differently, totaling 108 cases investigated by ISAF in 2022. This reflects a decrease in both fatal and non-fatal shark bites.

== Species involved in incidents ==

Only a few shark species are dangerous to humans. Out of more than 480 shark species, only three are responsible for two-digit numbers of fatal unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, tiger and bull. However, the oceanic whitetip has probably killed many more ship wreck and plane crash survivors, who have not been included in the statistics. These sharks, being large and powerful predators, may sometimes attack and kill people, even though all have been filmed in open water by unprotected divers. The 2010 French film &quot;Oceans&quot; shows footage of humans swimming next to sharks in the ocean. It is possible that the sharks can sense the presence of unnatural elements on or about the divers, such as polyurethane diving suits and air tanks, which may lead them to accept the divers as more of a curiosity than prey. Uncostumed humans, however, such as those surfboarding, light snorkeling or swimming, present a much greater area of exposed skin surface to sharks. In addition, the presence of even small traces of blood, recent minor abrasions, cuts, scrapes, or bruises, may lead sharks to attack a human in their environment. Sharks seek out prey through electroreception, sensing the electric fields that are generated by all animals due to the activity of their nerves and muscles.

Most of the oceanic whitetip shark&#x27;s attacks have not been recorded, unlike the other three species mentioned above. Famed oceanographic researcher Jacques Cousteau described the oceanic whitetip as &quot;the most dangerous of all sharks&quot;. 
Modern-day statistics show the oceanic whitetip shark as seldom being involved in unprovoked attacks. However, there have been a number of attacks involving this species, particularly during World War I and World War II. The oceanic whitetip lives in the open sea and rarely shows up near coasts, where most recorded incidents occur. During the world wars, many ship and aircraft disasters happened in the open ocean, and because of its former abundance, the oceanic whitetip was often the first species on site when such a disaster happened.

Infamous examples of oceanic whitetip attacks include the sinking of the &quot;Nova Scotia&quot;, a British steamship carrying 1,000 people that was torpedoed by a German submarine on 18 November 1942, near South Africa. Only 192 people survived, with many deaths attributed to the oceanic whitetip shark. The same species is believed to have been responsible for many of the 600–800 or more casualties following the torpedoing of the USS &quot;Indianapolis&quot; on 30 July 1945.

Black December refers to at least nine shark attacks on humans, causing six deaths, that occurred along the coast of KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, from 18 December 1957 to 5 April 1958.

In addition to the four species responsible for a significant number of fatal attacks on humans, a number of other species have attacked humans without being provoked, and have on extremely rare occasions been responsible for a human death. This group includes the shortfin mako, hammerhead, Galapagos, grey reef, blacktip, lemon, silky shark, and blue sharks. These sharks are also large, powerful predators which can be provoked simply by being in the water at the wrong time and place, but they are normally considered less dangerous to humans than the previous group.

On the evening of 16 March 2009, a new addition was made to the list of sharks known to have attacked human beings. In a painful but not directly life-threatening incident, a long-distance swimmer crossing the Alenuihaha Channel between the islands of Hawai&#x27;i and Maui was attacked by a cookiecutter shark. The two bites were delivered about 15 seconds apart.

== Prevention ==
=== Reducing the risks ===
General advice to reduce risks of being bitten by a shark include:

* Staying in groups, as solitary individuals are more at risk of being bitten
* Only going in the water during the day
* Avoiding areas with a lot of fish or fishers
* Not wearing jewelry, which can create reflections like fish scale
* Avoiding splashes at the surface, because it makes sound which attracts sharks

=== Shark barrier ===

A shark barrier (otherwise known as a &quot;shark-proof enclosure&quot; or &quot;beach enclosure&quot;) is a seabed-to-surface protective barrier that is placed around a beach to separate people from sharks. Shark barriers form a fully enclosed swimming area that prevents sharks from entering. Shark barrier design has evolved from rudimentary fencing materials to netted structures held in place with buoys and anchors. Recent designs have used plastics to increase strength and versatility.

When deployed in sheltered areas, shark barriers offer complete protection and are seen as a more environmentally friendly option as they largely avoid bycatch. However, barriers are not effective on surf beaches because they usually disintegrate in the swell. Thus, barriers are normally constructed only around sheltered areas such as harbour beaches.

=== Shark nets ===

In Australia and South Africa, shark nets are used to reduce the risk of shark attack. Since 1936, shark nets have been used off Sydney beaches. Shark nets are currently installed at beaches in New South Wales and Queensland; 83 beaches are meshed in Queensland compared with 51 in New South Wales. Since 1952, nets have been installed at numerous beaches in South Africa by the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board.

Shark nets do not offer complete protection but work on the principle of &quot;fewer sharks, fewer attacks&quot;. They reduce occurrence via shark mortality. Reducing the local shark populations is believed to reduce the chance of an attack. Historical shark attack figures suggest that shark nets and drumlines markedly reduce the incidence of shark attack when regularly and consistently implemented.

The downside of shark nets is that they result in bycatch, including threatened and endangered species. Between September 2017 and April 2018, 403 animals were killed in the nets in New South Wales, including 10 critically endangered grey nurse sharks, 7 dolphins, 7 green sea turtles, and 14 great white sharks. Between 1950 and 2008, 352 tiger sharks and 577 great white sharks were killed in the nets in New South Wales. Also during this period, 15,135 marine animals were killed in the nets, including whales, turtles, rays, dolphins, and dugongs. KwaZulu-Natal&#x27;s net program, operated by the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board, has killed more than 33,000 sharks in a 30-year period. During the same 30-year period, 2,211 turtles, 8,448 rays, and 2,310 dolphins were killed in KwaZulu-Natal.

Shark nets have been criticized by environmentalists, scientists, and conservationists, who assert that shark nets harm the marine ecosystem. In particular, the current net program in New South Wales has been described as being &quot;extremely destructive&quot; to marine life. Sharks are important to the ecosystem and killing them harms the ecosystem.

=== Drum lines ===
A drum line is an unmanned aquatic trap used to lure and capture large sharks using baited hooks. They are typically deployed near popular swimming beaches with the intention of reducing the number of sharks in the vicinity and therefore the probability of shark attack. Drum lines were first deployed to protect users of the marine environment from sharks in Queensland, Australia in 1962. During this time, they were just as successful in reducing the frequency of shark attacks as were shark nets. More recently, drumlines have also been used with great success in Recife, Brazil where the number of attacks has dropped by 97% when the drumlines are deployed. While shark nets and drum lines share the same purpose, drum lines are more effective at targeting the three sharks that are considered most dangerous to swimmers: the bull shark, tiger shark and great white shark. SMART drumlines can also be used to move sharks, which greatly reduces mortality of sharks and bycatch to less than 2%.

Drum lines result in bycatch. For example, in 2015 the non-profit organization Action for Dolphins said about Queensland&#x27;s shark control program (which uses drum lines):

Drum lines have been criticized by environmentalists, conservationists and animal welfare activists, who have asserted that drum lines are unethical, non-scientific, and environmentally destructive. They also claim drum lines harm the marine ecosystem.

=== Other protection methods ===

Beach patrols and spotter aircraft are commonly used to protect popular swimming beaches. However aerial patrols have limited effectiveness in reducing shark attacks. Other methods include shark tagging efforts and associated tracking and notification systems, capture and translocation of sharks to offshore waters, research into shark feeding and foraging behaviour, public shark threat education programs and encouraging higher risk user groups, such as surfers, spear-fishers, and divers, to use personal shark protection technology.

== Media impact ==
The Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916 killed four people in the first two weeks of July 1916 along the New Jersey shore and Matawan Creek in New Jersey. They are generally credited as the beginning of media attention on shark attacks in the United States of America.

In 2010 nine Australian survivors of shark attacks banded together to promote a more positive view of sharks. The survivors made particular note of the role of the media in distorting the fear of sharks. Films such as &quot;Jaws&quot; were the cause of large-scale hunting and killing of thousands of sharks. &quot;Jaws&quot; had a significant impact on people and gave them an unrealistic view of sharks, causing them to fear them more than they probably should. The media has continued to exploit this fear by sensationalizing attacks and portraying sharks as vicious man-eaters. There are some television shows, such as the famous &quot;Shark Week&quot;, that are dedicated to the preservation of these animals. They demonstrate, through scientific studies, that sharks are not interested in attacking humans and generally mistake humans as prey.

<text>The Sammarinese Socialist Party (, PSS) was a socialist and, later, social-democratic political party in San Marino. Its Italian counterpart was the Italian Socialist Party and its international affiliation was with the Socialist International.

There was a previous party of the same name existing from 1892 until 1926 when it was banned during Fascist rule. In the 1940s and 1950s the party was closely linked to the Sammarinese Communist Party (PCS) and this led the moderates of the party to split and form the Sammarinese Independent Democratic Socialist Party (PSDIS) in 1957. Later the PSS distanced itself from the PCS and entered in coalition with the Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party (PDCS) and PSDIS, which was re-united with the PSS in the early 1990s.

In the 2001 general election the PSS won 24.2% and 15 seats of 60 in the Grand and General Council and governed as the junior partner in a coalition with the PDCS until 2005, when it merged with the post-communist Party of Democrats to form a united social-democratic party, the Party of Socialists and Democrats (PSD). This led to the split of the centrist wing of the party which formed the New Socialist Party (NPS).

<text>The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is one of the two major contemporary political parties in Nigeria, along with its main rival, the All Progressives Congress (APC).

Its policies generally lie towards the center-right of the political spectrum. It won every presidential election between 1999 and 2011. Until the 2015 elections, it was the governing party in the Fourth Republic, although sometimes amid a few controversial electoral circumstances.

==History==

In 1998, the PDP in its first presidential primary election held in Jos, Plateau State, North Central Nigeria nominated former military leader Olusegun Obasanjo who had just been released from detention as political prisoner as the presidential candidate in the elections of February 1999, with Atiku Abubakar (Governor-Elect of Adamawa State and a former leading member of the Social Democratic Party) as his running mate. They won the presidential election and were inaugurated on 29 May 1999.

In the legislative election held on 12 April 2003, the party won 54.5% of the popular vote and 223 out of 360 seats in the House of Representatives, and 76 out of 109 seats in the Senate. Its candidate in the presidential election of 19 April 2003, Olusegun Obasanjo, was re-elected with 61.9% of the vote. In December 2006, Umaru Yar&#x27;Adua (formerly of the Peoples Redemption Party and the Social Democratic Party) was chosen as the presidential candidate of the ruling PDP for the April 2007 general election, receiving 3,024 votes from party delegates; his closest rival, Rochas Okorocha, received only 372 votes. Yar&#x27;Adua was eventually declared the winner of the 2007 general elections, held on April 21, and was sworn in on May 29, 2007, amid widespread allegations of electoral fraud. In the Nigerian National Assembly election, the party won 260 out of 360 seats in the House of Representatives and 85 out of 109 seats in the Senate. At the PDP&#x27;s 2008 National Convention, it chose Prince Vincent Ogbulafor as its National Chairman on March 8, 2008. Ogbulafor, who was the PDP&#x27;s National Secretary from 2001 to 2005, was the party&#x27;s consensus choice for the position of National Chairman, selected as an alternative to the rival leading candidates Sam Egwu (who was backed by Obasanjo) and Anyim Pius Anyim. All 26 other candidates, including Egwu and Anyim, withdrew in favor of Ogbulafor. Meanwhile, Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Baraje was elected as National Secretary.

In 2011, after the Peoples Democratic Party saw members defect for the Action Congress of Nigeria, some political commentators suspected that the PDP would lose the Presidency. Following PDP candidate Goodluck Jonathan&#x27;s victory in the 2011 election, it was reported that there were violent protests from northern youth.

==Slogans==
The longtime slogan of the PDP is &quot;Power to the people&quot;. During the party&#x27;s National Convention in Port Harcourt, Rivers State on 21 May 2016, David Mark, a former President of the Senate of Nigeria, introduced &quot;Change the change&quot; as the party&#x27;s campaign slogan for the 2019 general elections. However, in 2018, the chairman of the party&#x27;s board of trustees stated that neither the slogan nor the party&#x27;s umbrella symbol would be changed.

==Political ideology==
The party has a neoliberal stance in its economic policies and maintains a conservative stance on certain social issues, such as same-sex relations.

===Economic issues===
The PDP favors free-market policies which support economic liberalism, and limited government regulation. In 2003, President Olusegun Obasanjo and Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala embarked on an economic reform program, which reduced government spending through conservative fiscal policies and saw the deregulation and privatization of numerous industries in Nigerian services sector — notably the Nigerian Telecommunications (NITEL) industry. On the other hand, the PDP adopts a more leftist stance towards poverty and welfare. In 2005, President Obasanjo launched Nigeria&#x27;s first National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) to ensure that every Nigerian has access to basic health care services.

The PDP strives to maintain the status quo on oil revenue distribution. Though the PDP government set up the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) to address the needs of the oil-producing Niger Delta states, it has rebuffed repeated efforts to revert to the 50% to 50% federal-to-state government revenue allocation agreement established in 1966 during the First Republic.

===Social issues===
The PDP is against same-sex relations, and favors social conservatism on moral and religious grounds. In 2007, the PDP-dominated National Assembly sponsored a bill to outlaw homosexual relations, making it punishable by law for up to 14 years in prison .

The party is a moderate advocate of state-autonomy and religious freedom for the Nigerian states. In the year 2000 the introduction of ⁣⁣Islamic law in some states in Northern Nigeria triggered⁣⁣ sectarian violence in Kaduna and Abia states. The PDP-led federal government refused to bow to pressure from the southern, predominantly Christian states to repeal the law and instead opted for a compromise where Islamic law would only apply to Muslims.

Tunde Ayeni, chairman of the PDP fundraising event in December 2014 who donated N2 billion ,was involved in the mismanagement of bank&#x27;s funds.

==2015 elections==
In the 2015 elections, the incumbent president and PDP presidential nominee, Goodluck Jonathan, was defeated by General Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress by 55% to 45%, losing by 2.6 million votes out of approximately 28.6 million valid votes cast. Out of Nigeria&#x27;s 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, General Muhammadu Buhari won 21 states, while President Goodluck Jonathan won 15 states and the Federal Capital Territory.

==2019 elections==
In the 2019 elections, former vice president Atiku Abubakar and PDP presidential candidate together with his party rejected the outcome of the elections as INEC was yet to conclude the process and make an official pronouncement. On the 25th of February, PDP National Party Chair, Prince Uche Secondus alleged that the result as announced by INEC were incorrect.
==2020 elections==
Godwin Obaseki won re-election as the Governor of Edo State on 20 September 2020 PDP with 307,955 votes, defeating sixteen opponents. Security was tight and voters took health precautions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic that had infected 57,000 and killed 1,100.

<text>In the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE), user equipment (UE) is any device used directly by an end-user to communicate. It can be a hand-held telephone, a laptop computer equipped with a mobile broadband adapter, or any other device. It connects to the base station Node B/eNodeB as specified in the ETSI 125/136-series and 3GPP 25/36-series of specifications. It roughly corresponds to the mobile station (MS) in GSM systems.

The radio interface between the UE and the Node B is called &quot;Uu&quot;. In the context of UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), Uu stands for the interface between UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network) and the UE (User Equipment).

== Functionality ==
UE handles the following tasks towards the core network:
* Mobility management
* Call control
* Session management
* Identity management

The corresponding protocols are transmitted transparently via a Node B, that is, Node B does not change, use or understand the information. These protocols are also referred to as &quot;Non Access Stratum&quot; protocols.

The UE is a device which initiates all the calls and it is the terminal device in a network.

<text>The Party of Democrats (, PD) was a social-democratic and democratic socialist political party in San Marino. Its counterpart in Italy was the Democrats of the Left.

The PD had its origins in Sammarinese Communist Party (PCS), which had changed its name to the Sammarinese Democratic Progressive Party (PPDS) in 1990. On 25 March 2001 the PPDS merged with Ideas in Motion and the Socialists for Reform to form the PD. In 2005 the party finally merged with the Sammarinese Socialist Party (PSS) to form the Party of Socialists and Democrats (PSD). This led to the split of the left-wing faction, which formed the Left Party (PdS).

<text>The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a portal fantasy novel written by British author C. S. Lewis, published by Geoffrey Bles in 1952. It was the third published of seven novels in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; (1950–1956). Macmillan US published an American edition within the calendar year, with substantial revisions which were retained in the United States until 1994. It is volume five in recent editions, which are sequenced according to the novels&#x27; internal chronology. Like the other &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; was illustrated by Pauline Baynes, and her work has been retained in many later editions.

In the novel, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie (along with their cousin Eustace Scrubb) are taken out of this world into the enchanted land of Narnia. They are reunited with the Pevensies&#x27; friend, King Caspian X of Narnia, aboard Caspian&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Dawn Treader&quot;. Caspian has vowed to sail east across the Great Eastern Ocean for a year and a day to find the seven lost Lords of Narnia.
Lewis dedicated the book to Geoffrey Corbett, who later changed his name to Jeffrey Barfield and is the adopted son of Owen Barfield, a friend of Lewis&#x27;s.

&quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; has been adapted and recorded as four episodes of a BBC television series in 1989 and as a feature film in 2010.

==Plot summary==
The two youngest Pevensie children, Lucy and Edmund, are staying with their odious cousin Eustace Scrubb while their older brother, Peter, is studying for an exam with Professor Kirke, and their older sister, Susan, is travelling through America with their parents. Edmund, Lucy, and Eustace are drawn into the Narnian world through a picture of a ship at sea. (The painting, hanging neglected in the guest bedroom in which Lucy was staying, had been an unwanted present to Eustace&#x27;s parents.) The three children land in the ocean near the pictured vessel, the titular &quot;Dawn Treader&quot;, and are taken aboard.

The &quot;Dawn Treader&quot; is the ship of Caspian X, King of Narnia, whom Edmund and Lucy (along with Peter and Susan) helped to regain the throne of Narnia in &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;. Also present on board are the Lord Drinian (the captain of the &quot;Dawn Treader&quot;) and first mate Rhince.

Peace has been established in the three years since then, and Caspian has undertaken a quest in fulfilment of his coronation oath to sail east for a year and a day to find the seven lost Lords of Narnia: Argoz, Bern, Mavramorn, Octesian, Restimar, Revilian, and Rhoop. He mentions that Trumpkin the dwarf has been left in charge of Narnia as Lord Regent in his absence. Lucy and Edmund are delighted to be back in the Narnian world, but Eustace is less enthusiastic, as he has never been there before and had taunted his cousins with his belief that this alternate universe had never existed. The Talking Mouse Reepicheep is also on board, as he hopes to find Aslan&#x27;s Country beyond the seas of the &quot;utter East&quot;. When Eustace teases Reepicheep, much is revealed about the mouse&#x27;s pugnacious character.

They first make landfall in the Lone Islands, nominally Narnian territory but fallen away from Narnian ways: in particular the slave trade flourishes here, despite Narnian law stating that it is forbidden. Caspian, Lucy, Edmund, Eustace, and Reepicheep are captured as merchandise by a slave trader, and a man &quot;buys&quot; Caspian before they even reach the slave market. He turns out to be the first lost lord, Bern, who had moved to the islands and married a woman there after being banished from Narnia by Miraz. When Caspian reveals his identity, Lord Bern acknowledges him as King. Caspian reclaims the islands for Narnia and replaces Gumpas, the greedy governor, with Lord Bern, whom he names Duke of the Lone Islands. Caspian also declares that slavery is forbidden in all his dominions and that all slaves are free.

At the second island they visit, Eustace leaves the group to avoid participating in the work needed to render the ship seaworthy after a storm has damaged it and hides in a dead dragon&#x27;s cave to escape a sudden downpour. The dragon&#x27;s treasure arouses his greed: he fills his pockets with gold and jewels and puts on a large golden bracelet; but as he sleeps, he is transformed into a dragon. In his new guise, he becomes aware of how bad his previous behaviour was; he attempts to shed his dragon skin without success. It is only with the help of Aslan that he is able to become human again, though the process is very painful. Caspian recognises the bracelet: it belonged to Lord Octesian, another of the lost lords. They speculate that the dragon killed Octesian — or even that the dragon &quot;was&quot; Octesian. Aslan turns Eustace back into a boy, and as a result of his experiences, he is now a much nicer person.

The crew narrowly escape being sunk by a sea-serpent and stop at Deathwater Island, so named for a pool of water which turns everything immersed in it into gold, including one of the missing lords who turns out to have been Lord Restimar. Then they land on the Duffers&#x27; Island, where Lucy removes an invisibility spell from the Duffers (later Dufflepuds) at their request and befriends the Magician who cast it. Next they reach the &quot;Island Where Dreams Come True&quot;, called the Dark Island since it is permanently hidden in darkness. It turns out that the &quot;dreams&quot; that come true there are not necessarily &quot;nice&quot; dreams and Lord Rhoop, whom they rescue there, has been tormented for years by his nightmares. Eventually they reach the Island of the Star, where they find the three remaining lost lords in enchanted sleep. Ramandu, the fallen star who lives on the island with his daughter, tells them that the only way to awaken them is to sail to the edge of the world and to leave one member of the crew behind there. Lord Rhoop wishes to &quot;sleep without dreams&quot; beside his friends until they wake and everyone agrees before they set out again.

The &quot;Dawn Treader&quot; continues sailing into an area where merpeople dwell and the water turns sweet rather than salty, as Reepicheep discovers when he belligerently jumps in to fight a mer-man whom he thinks challenged him. At last the water becomes so shallow that the ship can go no farther. Caspian orders a boat lowered and announces that he will go to the world&#x27;s end with Reepicheep. The crew object, saying that as King of Narnia he has no right to abandon them. Caspian goes to his cabin in a temper, but returns to say that Aslan appeared in his cabin and told him that only Lucy, Edmund, Eustace, and Reepicheep will go on.

These four venture in a small boat through a sea of lilies until they reach a wall of water that extends into the sky. Fulfilling Ramandu&#x27;s condition, Reepicheep paddles his coracle up the waterfall and is never again seen in Narnia. Edmund, Eustace, and Lucy find a Lamb, who transforms into Aslan and tells them that Edmund and Lucy will not return to Narnia. When Lucy becomes sorrowful and despondent about the prospect of not seeing Aslan again, Aslan tells the children that he exists in their world, too. Aslan adds, &quot;There I have another name. You must learn to know me by that name. This was the very reason why you were brought to Narnia, that by knowing me here for a little, you may know me better there&quot;. Aslan then sends the three children home.

Back in the real world, everyone remarks about how much Eustace has changed.

==Main characters==

* Lucy Pevensie – the youngest of the four Pevensie children.
* Edmund Pevensie – the next youngest.
* Eustace Scrubb – a cousin of the four Pevensie siblings; Edmund and Lucy are staying with him at the house that Eustace shares with his parents.
* Caspian X – the King of Narnia.
* Reepicheep – a valiant talking mouse who is a main ally to King Caspian.
* Lord Drinian – The captain of the &quot;Dawn Treader&quot;.
* Seven Great Lords of Narnia – characters whom Caspian is seeking. Of the seven, two prove to be dead and three in an enchanted sleep; only the Lords Bern and Rhoop have any part in the story.
* Ramandu – a &quot;star at rest&quot; who regains youth through fire-berries. 
* Ramandu&#x27;s daughter – the daughter of Ramandu and the future Queen of Narnia, wife of Caspian, and mother of Rilian. 
* Pug – slaver and pirate of the Lone Islands, who takes the protagonists prisoner. 
* Gumpas – governor of the Lone Islands, enabler of slavery, whom Caspian deposes.
* Coriakin – the Magician (and star) who rules the Dufflepuds (monopods) as penance for unspecified misdeeds.

==Differences between British and American editions==

Several weeks or months after reading the proofs for the British edition of &quot;The Chronicles&quot;, Lewis read through the proofs for the American edition. While doing so, he made several changes to the text. HarperCollins took over publication of the series in 1994 and made the unusual decision to ignore the changes that Lewis had made and use the earlier text as the standard for their editions.

In &quot;Dawn Treader&quot;, Lewis made two changes, one minor and one more substantial. The minor change appears in the first chapter where Lewis changes the description of Eustace from &quot;far too stupid to make anything up himself&quot; to &quot;quite incapable of making anything up himself&quot;. Paul Ford, author of &quot;Companion to Narnia&quot;, suggests that Lewis might have felt the need to soften the passage for his American readers or perhaps he was starting to like Eustace better. Peter Schakel, author of &quot;Imagination and the arts in C.S. Lewis&quot;, opines that the passage should have been changed in both cases as &quot;calling a character &#x27;stupid&#x27; in a children&#x27;s book is insensitive and unwise&quot;. Both Schakel and Ford agree that it is not an accurate depiction of Eustace as Lewis describes him, and this too may be the reason for the change.

The more substantive change appears in Chapter 12, &quot;The Dark Island&quot;, where Lewis rewrote the ending in a way that, Schakel maintains, improves the imaginative experience considerably.
A side by side comparison of the ending of chapter 12 follows:

==Reception==
Boucher and McComas found &quot;Voyage&quot; &quot;not quite up to the high level set by previous Narnian adventures&quot;. They singled out Reepicheep for praise as &quot;one of Lewis&#x27;s finest imaginings.&quot;

Researcher Sue Baines wrote: &quot;In contrast to other Narnia books, &quot;Dawn Treader&quot; has virtually no overt villains, other than the slavers in the very beginning who are quickly overcome and disposed of. Rather, the plot confronts the protagonists again and again with the flaws of their own character. Eustace&#x27;s greediness and general bad behavior cause him to turn into a dragon, and he must work hard to show himself worthy of becoming human again; Caspian is tempted to seize the magic pool which turns everything to gold – which would have turned Caspian himself into a greedy tyrant ready to kill in order to preserve his power and wealth; later, Caspian faces the nobler but still wrong-headed temptation to go off to Aslan&#x27;s Country and abandon his responsibilities as a King; Lucy is tempted to make herself magically beautiful, which would have led to her becoming the focus of terrible wars devastating Narnia and all its neighbors; and having resisted this temptation, she succumbs to a lesser temptation to magically spy on her schoolmates – and is punished by hearing malicious things and destroying what could have developed into an enduring nice friendship. ... Edmund, who had undergone a very severe test of his character on his first arrival in Narnia, is spared such an experience in the present book, and acts as the most mature and grown-up member of the group.&quot;

==Influences==

Arguably, &quot;Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; is the novel which shows the most influence of Lewis&#x27; Irish background. It is reminiscent of the &quot;Immram&quot; genre of Irish literature. Lewis draws inspiration from the Medieval text &quot;The Voyage of Saint Brendan&quot;, a clear example of the Immram. Lewis&#x27; characters follow the plot of St. Brendan&#x27;s voyage almost exactly, showing the influence of the classic Celtic fable. However, unlike such voyages, &quot;Dawn Treader&quot; travels East rather than West, maybe because Lewis wanted to signify new beginnings and rebirth, as opposed to the traditional connotation of death and closure associated with heading west.

The novel also underscores the idea of Aslan representing Jesus Christ. In the end of the novel Aslan appears as a lamb which has been used as a symbol for him, in a scene evoking the Gospel of John 21:9.

Eustace&#x27;s transformation into a dragon in the presence of gold recalls the fate of Fáfnir in Norse myth. Had Eustace been educated to know about myths and fairytales, he would have known that dragons&#x27; gold is cursed.

In chapter 13, Ulysses in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; (Canto 26 v.112-119) is closely paraphrased by one of the three lords when they reach Ramandu&#x27;s island.

Mary Coombe noted that &quot;The Fifth book of Rabelais&#x27; &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; depicts a King with his loyal followers sailing in a ship, stopping at various islands and having strange adventures. To be sure, in Lewis&#x27; handling of the same theme, the details of the King, his retinue and the islands they visit are all very different from those of Rabelais.(...) Lewis considered Rabelais to be mainly &#x27;a teller of coarse jokes&#x27;. It might have appealed to Lewis to take up a theme from Rabelais and treat it in a less coarse way. In particular, the quest undertaken by Pantagruel and his companions is entirely and manifestly farcical, while that of Caspian is conducted very earnestly indeed.&quot;

== Adaptations ==

===Film===
&quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; is the third installment in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; film series from Walden Media. Unlike the earlier two films, which were distributed by Disney, it was distributed by 20th Century Fox. However, Disney now owns the rights following the acquisition of 20th Century Fox in 2019. Michael Apted took over as director from Andrew Adamson, who opted to produce with Mark Johnson, Perry Moore and Douglas Gresham. Will Poulter joined the cast as Eustace Scrubb, while Georgie Henley, Skandar Keynes, Ben Barnes, Liam Neeson, and Tilda Swinton all returned.

The film had a wide theatrical release in traditional 2D, and a limited theatrical release in RealD 3D and Digital 3D in the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom on 10 December 2010.

===Television===
* The BBC produced a TV miniseries of &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; (1989); it was combined with the previous book and released as &quot;Prince Caspian and the Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;.

== Legacy ==

&quot;The Dawntreader&quot; is a song about the sea by Joni Mitchell, one track on her debut album &quot;Song to a Seagull&quot; (1968).

&quot;Dawn Treader&quot; is a song by Charlotte Hatherley on her 2007 album &quot;The Deep Blue&quot;.

The spaceship &quot;Dawn Treader&quot; in Greg Bear&#x27;s novel &quot;Anvil of Stars&quot; is presumably also named for the ship in this book.

==Notes==
{{notelist |notes=
{{efn |name=italics |1=
Note that the name of the ship &quot;Dawn Treader&quot; is italicised in the title on the first edition dust jacket. By English typographical conventions, both book titles and ship names are usually italicised when they are written. Where &quot;Dawn Treader&quot; appears as part of the full title, it might be distinguished by another typographic convention but in this article, the entire title is simply italicised. &quot;Dawn Treader&quot; alone always refers to the featured ship.}}

<doc id="427317" wikidata="Q331669" url="?curid=427317" title="The Silver Chair">
<text>The Silver Chair is a portal fantasy novel written by British author C. S. Lewis and published by Geoffrey Bles in 1953. It was the fourth of seven novels published in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; (1950–1956), but became volume six in recent editions sequenced in chronological order to Narnian history. 
Macmillan US published a revised American edition within the calendar year. Like the others, it was illustrated by Pauline Baynes and her work has been retained in many later editions.

The novel is set primarily in the world of Narnia, decades after &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; there but less than a year later in England. King Caspian X is now an old man, but his son and only heir, Prince Rilian, is missing. Aslan the lion sends two children from England to Narnia on a mission to resolve the mystery: Eustace Scrubb, from &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, and his classmate, Jill Pole. In England, Eustace and Jill are students at a horrible boarding school, Experiment House.

&quot;The Silver Chair&quot; is dedicated to Nicholas Hardie, the son of Colin Hardie, a member of the Inklings with Lewis, and was adapted and filmed as a BBC television series of six episodes in 1990.

==Plot summary==

Eustace Scrubb, now a reformed character following the events of &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, encounters his classmate and new friend Jill Pole at their school, Experiment House, where they are miserable. Jill has been tormented by bullies and is hiding from them. Eustace tells Jill about his Narnian adventures, and how his experiences there led to the changes in his behaviour – which Jill warns is likely to see him targeted by the bullies as well. Eustace suggests asking for Aslan&#x27;s help, and as the bullies converge on them, the two blunder through a gate that leads them to Aslan&#x27;s Country.

They encounter a cliff, where Jill shows off by approaching the edge, and Eustace, trying to pull her back, falls over the edge. Aslan appears and saves Eustace by blowing him on a magical wind stream to Narnia. He charges Jill with helping Eustace find King Caspian X&#x27;s son, Prince Rilian of Narnia, who disappeared some years earlier. He gives Jill four Signs to guide them on their quest and then blows Jill into Narnia, where Eustace is already waiting by a great castle. They watch as an elderly and frail man takes ship and sails from the harbour. To Eustace&#x27;s dismay, they then learn that the elderly man is actually King Caspian; by failing to greet him they have missed the first Sign. 50 years have passed since Eustace was last in Narnia, even though less than a year has passed in his world. They also learn that Caspian has sailed off to visit again the lands they had sailed to when he and Eustace were young, although many Narnians believe that he has set off to seek Aslan in order to ask who can be the next King of Narnia when he dies. Caspian is obviously deteriorating with old age, and his people fear that he will not live for much longer.

Caspian&#x27;s Lord Regent Trumpkin the dwarf, now very elderly and deaf, provides Jill and Eustace with rooms in Cair Paravel, but on the advice of Glimfeather the Owl, they make no mention of their quest. Glimfeather summons them to a Parliament of his fellow talking owls, who explain that Prince Rilian disappeared a decade earlier while searching for a large green serpent that had killed his mother.

Jill and Eustace are flown to the marshes on the northern edge of Narnia where they meet their guide, Puddleglum, a gloomy but stalwart Marsh-wiggle. They journey toward the giant-lands north of Narnia. Hungry and suffering from exposure, they meet the Lady of the Green Kirtle accompanied by a silent knight in black armour. She encourages them to proceed northward to Harfang, the castle of the &quot;Gentle Giants&quot;, who she says would be glad to have them at their Autumn Feast. Jill and Eustace, overcome at the thought of comfort and warmth, are eager to go; only Puddleglum argues against the journey to Harfang. After a long journey in harsh weather, and braving a mysterious chasm in a driving snowstorm, they are welcomed at Harfang.

From the castle the three see that in the snowstorm they had blundered through the ruins of a giant city in the valley below, thereby missing Aslan&#x27;s second Sign. They also see the words &quot;Under Me&quot; engraved on the road, which is the third Sign. Discovering from a cookbook in the kitchen that &quot;they&quot; are the main course for the Autumn Feast, they make a narrow escape from Harfang. Following the Sign, they take shelter in a cave under the ruined city, where they fall down a long dark slope into Underland.

They are found by an army of underground-dwelling earthmen, who take them aboard a boat across the subterranean Sunless Sea to the city ruled by the Lady of the Green Kirtle. She herself is away, but her protégé, a young man, greets the travellers pleasantly. He explains that he suffers from nightly psychotic episodes, and during these episodes he must, by the Lady&#x27;s orders, be bound to a silver chair; for if he is released, he will turn into a deadly green serpent and kill everyone in sight. The three travellers determine to witness the youth in his torment, as they sense it could be the key to their quest.

When the young man is tied to his chair, his &quot;ravings&quot; seem instead to indicate desperation to escape an enchanted captivity. After several threats, the youth finally begs the three to release him in the name of Aslan. Recognizing this as the fourth Sign, they hesitantly do so, believing that he could indeed be Prince Rilian. The young man immediately destroys the silver chair. Free from enchantment, he thanks them and declares that he is indeed the vanished Prince Rilian, kept underground by the Lady of the Green Kirtle as part of her plot to conquer Narnia.

The Green Lady returns and tries to bewitch them all into forgetting who they are, but the barefoot Puddleglum stamps out the enchantress&#x27;s magical fire and breaks her spell. The enraged Lady transforms herself into a green serpent, and Rilian kills her with the help of Eustace and Puddleglum, realizing that the Green Lady was herself the serpent who killed his mother. Rilian leads the travellers to escape from Underland. The gnomes, who had also been magically enslaved by the Lady, are now freed by her death and joyfully return to their home even deeper in the earth: a land called Bism. One of them shows Rilian&#x27;s party a route to the surface, and Rilian returns to Cair Paravel as King Caspian is returning home. Caspian is reunited with his long-lost son but dies just afterwards. Rilian is then declared King of Narnia amid the weeping crowd.

Aslan appears and congratulates Eustace and Jill on achieving their goal, then returns them to the stream in his country where Jill first met him. The body of King Caspian appears in the stream, and Aslan instructs Eustace to drive a thorn into the lion&#x27;s paw. Eustace obeys, and Aslan&#x27;s blood flows over the dead King, who is revived and returned to youth. Aslan promises Eustace and Jill that, while they have to return to their own world for a while, they will one day return to Aslan&#x27;s Country to stay. He then allows Caspian to accompany Eustace and Jill back to their own world for a brief time, where they drive off the bullies before Caspian returns to Aslan&#x27;s Country. Experiment House becomes a well-managed school, and Eustace and Jill remain good friends.

Back in Narnia, Rilian buries his father and mourns him. The kingdom goes on to have many happy years, but Puddleglum &quot;often pointed out that bright mornings brought on wet afternoons and that you couldn&#x27;t expect good times to last.&quot;

==Main characters==

* Jill Pole – A pupil at Experiment House who is found by Eustace Scrubb, crying, after she is bullied by a gang of children.
* Eustace Scrubb – Appeared in &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; and is a cousin of the four Pevensie siblings from the earlier stories. Became a much nicer person after his brief time as an enchanted dragon in the previous story.
* Puddleglum – A pessimistic Marsh-wiggle who helps Jill and Eustace on their quest. He guides them and keeps them on track. He represents common sense and the voice of reason.
* The Lady of the Green Kirtle – The ruler of Underland, who plans to conquer Narnia with its rightful heir under her spell at her side.
* Prince Rilian – Heir to the Narnian throne, who was captured by the Lady of the Green Kirtle and enslaved in her Underworld.
* Aslan – The Lion who created Narnia; the only character to appear in every book.
* King Caspian – Elderly King of Narnia who appeared in &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; as a boy and &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; as a young man; in &quot;The Silver Chair&quot; he is sad because his only son was taken from him 10 years earlier just after the death of his wife from a serpent attack.
* Glimfeather – a large talking Owl who spots Eustace and Jill during their arrival from Aslan&#x27;s eastern country; he helps them by bringing them to a Parliament of Owls, where the history of Rilian is explained, and then by helping to carry them to meet Puddleglum. His speech often rhymes with the onomatopoeic call of owls, &quot;to-whoo!&quot; (&quot;There&#x27;s something magic about you two. I saw you arrive: you &quot;flew&quot;.&quot;).

==Film, television, or theatrical adaptations==

The BBC produced a TV series, which aired in late 1990. It was the fourth and last of the Narnia books that the BBC adapted for television.

On 1 October 2013, The C.S. Lewis Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with The Mark Gordon Company to jointly develop and produce &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Silver Chair&quot;, following the film series&#x27; mirroring of the novel&#x27;s publication order (in contrast to Walden Media&#x27;s initial pushing for &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot; during planning for a fourth film). Mark Gordon and Douglas Gresham along with Vincent Sieber, the Los Angeles–based director of The C.S. Lewis Company, will serve as producers and work with The Mark Gordon Company on developing the script. On 5 December 2013, it was announced that David Magee would write the screenplay. In January 2016, Gordon said the film will serve as a &#x27;reboot&#x27; of the film franchise. It was announced that Sony Pictures and Entertainment One will finance the fourth film with both Mark Gordon Company and C.S. Lewis Company. In April 2017, it was announced that Joe Johnston would be directing the fourth film.

<doc id="427319" wikidata="Q886792" url="?curid=427319" title="Sir John Wentworth, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir John Wentworth, 1st Baronet (9 August 1737 – 8 April 1820) was the British colonial governor of New Hampshire at the time of the American Revolution. He was later also Lieutenant-Governor of Nova Scotia. He is buried in the crypt of St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Halifax.

==Early years==

Wentworth was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 9 August 1737. His ancestry went back to some of the earliest settlers of the Province of New Hampshire, and he was a grandson of John Wentworth, who served as the province&#x27;s lieutenant governor in the 1720s, a nephew to Governor Benning Wentworth, and a descendant of &quot;Elder&quot; William Wentworth. His father Mark was a major landowner and merchant in the province, and his mother, Elizabeth Rindge Wentworth, was also from the upper echelons of New Hampshire society. In 1751, he enrolled in Harvard College, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1755 and a master&#x27;s degree in 1758. During his time at Harvard, he was a classmate and became a close friend of future Founding Father and President of the United States John Adams.

In 1759, the young Wentworth made his first significant investment, joining a partnership in the purchase and development of land in the Lake Winnipesaukee area. Wentworth sat on a committee of partners that oversaw the settlement of the community, which the investors named Wolfeboro. In 1763, his father sent him to London to act on behalf of his merchant interests. Based on his father&#x27;s introductions, he was soon mingling with the upper levels of British society. Among the connections he made was one with the Marquess of Rockingham, a distant relative (although neither was apparently aware of this) and a leading Whig politician. In 1765, Wentworth, still in London, was appointed by the province as one of its agents. That same year Rockingham became Prime Minister and led the repeal of the hated Stamp Act. Whether Wentworth influenced Rockingham&#x27;s decision is uncertain, but New Hampshire&#x27;s other agent, Barlow Trecothick, drafted with Rockingham a position paper on the matter, and Wentworth was clearly sympathetic to colonial opposition to the Stamp Act.

Wentworth&#x27;s uncle Benning had spent many years of his governorship lining his pockets by selling land grants to the west of the Connecticut River, territory to which the province held dubious claim. In 1764, the Lords of Trade ruled that New Hampshire&#x27;s western border was at the Connecticut River, decisively awarding the territory (the future state of Vermont) to the Province of New York. The governor, however, refused to resign, leading the Lords of Trade to consider his recall. Wentworth interceded, and convinced them to allow his uncle the dignity of resigning in his nephew&#x27;s favor.

In August 1766, he was commissioned as Governor and vice admiral of New Hampshire, and Surveyor General of the King&#x27;s Woods in North America. Before he returned to North America he was awarded a Doctorate of Common Law by Oxford University. After a difficult crossing he arrived at Charleston, South Carolina in March 1767, where he proceeded to make the first major survey of the forests of Georgia and the Carolinas on behalf of the crown. He then made his way north overland, and was received in Portsmouth with pomp and ceremony on 13 June 1767.

==Governor of New Hampshire==
Under Wentworth&#x27;s administration the growing province was divided into five counties to distribute administration and judicial functions to communities remote from Portsmouth. Wentworth was responsible for naming them, choosing names of current British leaders (including Rockingham), but also named Strafford County after one of his distant relatives, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford.
He also began the process of developing roads between the major population centers of the province, which had grown around the coast and the Merrimack and Connecticut Rivers. Although the provincial assembly was reluctant to fund new roads, Wentworth used quitrents collected on recently issued land grants to pay for the work. In 1771, he reported having constructed more than of roads at a cost of £500. The same year he convinced the assembly to appropriate £100 for surveyor Samuel Holland to produce the first detailed high quality map of the province.

Wentworth was ironically responsible for significant improvements to the provincial militia organization. When he arrived, the militia consisted of about 10,000 men, who were by his report &quot;badly accoutred and scarcely at all disciplined&quot;. He expanded the militia, adding 1,600 men and three regiments to the force, and regularly attended regimental reviews.

Although Wentworth was successful in keeping New Hampshire from implementing harsh boycotts in response to the Townshend Acts, he was clearly troubled by both colonial resistance to Parliamentary acts and by the introduction of troops into Boston in 1768. He wrote to Rockingham that the troop movement was likely to be problematic, and that government and other reforms were more likely to succeed. New Hampshire businessmen were eventually pressured into adopting a boycott of British goods when Massachusetts businessmen threatened to suspend trade with them.

After the Boston Tea Party in late 1773 further inflamed tensions in New England, Wentworth successfully defused the threat of similar action in Portsmouth. After issuing careful instructions to the master of a ship arriving with a consignment of tea, Wentworth departed Portsmouth for Dover. During his absence the tea was landed and stored in the Portsmouth customs house. This removed the possibility of the tea being dumped as it had been in Boston, but the townspeople were still opposed to its presence. A committee of Portsmouth merchants negotiated its safe passage to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the tea was safely transported through the town and reembarked on a ship.

Wentworth&#x27;s popularity in the province began to fall as tensions continued to rise in neighboring Massachusetts. When the Boston port was closed as punishment for the Tea Party, Massachusetts Governor Thomas Gage found it increasingly difficult to find workers willing to support the military (despite rampant unemployment caused by the port closure). He therefore asked Wentworth to assist in the procurement of carpenters in New Hampshire to build barracks for the troops. When his secretive methods to do so were exposed and publicized, local revolutionary committees denounced him as an &quot;enemy to the community&quot;. Although he intuited that the arrival of Paul Revere on 13 December 1774, was likely to cause trouble, he was unable to prevent the local militia, now effectively under control of the revolutionary committees, from marching on Fort William and Mary the next day and seizing the provincial armaments and gunpowder. Wentworth had warned the garrison before the event, and called for naval support afterward, but it arrived too late to be of use.

He eventually asked for further reinforcements but received none, and realized that any attempt to arrest the ringleaders of the rebellion would likely result in an uprising. He organized a small force of trusted men to act as guards of his person and property, and during early 1775 pressure on the province&#x27;s Loyalists was prompting some of them to flee to the safety of the British Army presence in Boston. Despite the opening of hostilities with the Battles of Lexington and Concord on 19 April (after which numerous New Hampshire militia went south to join the Siege of Boston), Wentworth convened the provincial assembly in late May. Composed primarily of rebel sympathizers, it refused to consider the Conciliatory Resolution proposed by Prime Minister Lord North to defuse the crisis. Wentworth therefore prorogued the assembly, hoping that a delay would favorably change the atmosphere. It did not; on 30 May, rebel militia began occupying and fortifying Portsmouth. Captain Andrew Barclay of &quot;HMS Scarborough&quot; further exacerbated tensions by impressing local fishermen and seizing supplies for use by the troops in Boston. Wentworth managed to defuse the situation by convincing Barclay to release the fishermen.

On 13 June 1775, after his house was surrounded by a mob of armed men seeking to arrest a Loyalist militia officer, Wentworth and his family fled to Fort William and Mary, which was under the guns of the &quot;Scarborough&quot;. Conditions continued to deteriorate, and Wentworth boarded the &quot;Scarborough&quot; and sailed for Boston on 23 August. After sending his family to England, he remained in the city until it was evacuated to Halifax in March 1776. He remained with the fleet until New York City was captured in September 1776, and finally sailed to England in early 1778. The New Hampshire government established after his departure seized most of his property, but specially reserved to the family portraits and furniture from the Portsmouth mansion.

==Surveyor General of the King&#x27;s Woods==
Wentworth had hopes of being appointed Governor of Nova Scotia, replacing Francis Legge. In March 1782, Lord North&#x27;s ministry fell and the King called on Rockingham and the Earl of Shelburne to form a new government and negotiate peace with the US Congress. Rockingham had in fact promised him the position and presented him to the King, who thanked Wentworth for his efforts to preserve royal government in New Hampshire. However, three months later Rockingham died, and Shelburne was free to appoint his own supporters, so the governorship went to John Parr. Worse yet, Wentworth&#x27;s office of Surveyor General of the King&#x27;s Woods was eliminated as an economy measure. This was the low point of Wentworth&#x27;s fortunes. All he could look forward to, like most Loyalists, was compensation for his losses in the former colonies and a small pension. However, Shelburne&#x27;s ministry fell in April 1783, and the Duke of Portland, one of Rockingham&#x27;s former supporters, became the new minister of the treasury. Wentworth lobbied successfully to have his surveyor-generalship restored, and he returned to Halifax in the summer of that year. His wife, Frances, followed him in 1784.

The office of Surveyor General of the King&#x27;s Woods had been regarded as a sinecure by most of its previous holders, but Wentworth took the job very seriously. The government had seen the forests of North America as an inexhaustible resource of timber for the construction of ships, buildings, wharves, and other purposes. But Wentworth was far-sighted enough to see that the pressure of human settlement was literally chipping away at the old-growth forests. In particular he was aware of the enormous demand by the Royal Navy for mast timber, the tall, straight pines that were suitable for masts, booms, and other rigging on sailing ships. And given that Britain had just lost about half of its forest lands in North America, he was determined that, for the defense of the realm, the remainder of the choice trees would be protected.

Upon his return from his travels to Halifax in Dec. 1786, he received a letter from James Monk assuring him that he would soon be appointed lieutenant-governor of either Nova Scotia or New Brunswick. In the end, after a complicated series of appointments and reassignments, Wentworth was left the odd man out.

==Frances Wentworth and Prince William==

Frances Wentworth had been unhappy since her arrival in Nova Scotia. As ambitious as her husband, she took his and her misfortunes very hard. She also missed the sophisticated lifestyle she had enjoyed in England, missed her son who was being schooled in England, and was distressed by John&#x27;s long absences.

Prince William Henry, the third son of King George III, made his first visit to Halifax in late 1786, while John Wentworth was away in Cape Breton. The Prince, later known as the &quot;Sailor King&quot;, was at that time in command of HMS &quot;Pegasus&quot;, and was already known as a hard drinker and womanizer, much to the distress of his royal father. Frances arranged to be introduced to Prince William. At the age of forty-one (the Prince was twenty-one), she was widely considered to be still quite beautiful, dressed at the height of fashion, and retained the sophistication she had gained in England. It is widely believed that shortly after this she became Prince William&#x27;s mistress. The affair was renewed when the Prince made a second visit to Halifax in the following year.

John learned of the affair, but did not raise any public scandal; Frances described him in a letter as the &quot;most diffident of men.&quot; A scandal would not have furthered the interests of either of them. Nevertheless, he made his displeasure known to the King, most likely via the Prince&#x27;s superior officer, Admiral Herbert Sawyer. Prince William soon departed for Québec.

==Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia==
The Wentworths sailed to England in the early summer of 1791, to try to sort out their deepening financial disorders. While there, news came that Lt. Gov. Parr had died. The couple immediately began lobbying for John to get the vacated post, and while his position appeared weak, Henry Dundas decided in his favor based on his experience. Wentworth became the first civilian governor of Nova Scotia.

During the previous decade hostility between the Planters and the newly arrived Loyalists nearly crippled the government. As well, the cost of settling the Loyalists had plunged the colony into debt. As a Loyalist himself, Wentworth favored them for higher offices, while being more even-handed with the distribution of lower offices. This began a Loyalist ascendancy that continued well into the 19th century. He stabilized the colony&#x27;s finances by introducing an excise duty on all imports; by the end of 1793 even some of the principal of the debt had been paid off.

In April 1793, news arrived that war had broken out between Britain and revolutionary France. All but 200 men of the colony&#x27;s garrison were sent to the West Indies, and Wentworth was instructed to call out the militia and to begin recruiting a provincial regiment of 600 men (later 800) for home defence, of which he was to be colonel. He set about the task with vigour, in spite of having no military experience. Despite difficulties, the Royal Nova Scotia Regiment was brought up to a useful strength within a year and served until disbanded with the coming of peace in 1802.

In May 1794, another royal prince arrived at Halifax, the fourth son of the King, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, along with his mistress, Julie, Madame de Saint-Laurent. Edward had been appointed C-in-C of the King&#x27;s forces in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Wentworth was pleased by this, as he had quarreled with the previous commander, Maj. Gen. Ogilvie. The Wentworths were also pleased to welcome Julie, which gratified the Prince, as she had been shunned by society in Québec, where he had been previously posted. The two couples formed a lasting friendship, which led to Wentworth offering the Prince the use of his small estate outside of town, which is today known as Princes Lodge. On a more practical level, Prince Edward&#x27;s influence brought funding for the fortifications of Halifax and much of the rest of the colony. He also gifted Halifax with its Town Clock, which he helped to design. The influx of government funding for the war effort led to prosperity throughout Nova Scotia. Simeon Perkins of Liverpool outfitted a privateer ship named after Wentworth&#x27;s son, the &quot;Charles Mary Wentworth&quot;, which netted 19,000 pounds sterling on her second cruise.

The Wentworths had been displeased with the state of their residence since John had come to the office. The building (on the site now occupied by Province House) was a wood-frame construction built in 1758. Nearly 40 years later it was generally run-down and not large enough for major occasions. Beginning in 1796, Wentworth obtained funding from the Legislature for an entirely new building, built of stone, which would be both a residence and a public space, a few blocks to the southwest. Government House, as it became known, eventually went three times over its initial budget, and the Wentworths did not finally move in until 1805, when the interior was still not finished. This residence still serves as home to Nova Scotia&#x27;s Lieutenant Governors today.

Wentworth also improved and expanded roads, increased support to Nova Scotia&#x27;s poverty stricken Mi&#x27;kmaq people and set up the first rescue station on Sable Island. A less successful and costly initiative was a settlement of Maroons from Jamaica who were instead resettled in Sierra Leone. Wentworth initially enjoyed good relations with the legislature but in later years fell into an escalating confrontation with the informal leader of the country party, William Cottnam Tonge. The conflict, largely over which branch of government should allocate funds for road-building, grew into a constitutional struggle between the governor-in-council and the House of Assembly, controlled by Tonge. Wentworth assisted and drew support from powerful Halifax merchants but lost support elsewhere. With the war with France renewed in 1803 and conflict with the United States intensifying, London abruptly replaced Wentworth in 1808 with a military governor, General George Prevost.

Wentworth was knighted and awarded a baronetcy in 1795, and granted a coat of arms by the College of Arms, London, England, 16 May 1795. He also served as Grand Master of the Free Masons. He retired as governor of Nova Scotia in 1808 on a pension of 6500 dollars.

==Family and legacy==

John Wentworth and Frances Deering Wentworth were cousins. Frances had first married Theodore Atkinson, Junior, Secretary of the Colony of New Hampshire, who died at Portsmouth, 28 October 1769. John and Frances married two weeks later. Her name is preserved in the towns of Francestown, Deering and Wentworth. John&#x27;s name is preserved in the community of Wentworth and the surrounding area. The couple had one son, Charles Mary Wentworth, who succeeded to the baronetcy. The son, who served as a member of the Legislative Council in Nova Scotia, died without issue in 1844, extinguishing the baronetcy.

Frances died at Sunninghill, Berkshire, England, 14 February 1813, aged 68 and buried at St. James Churchyard in Piccadilly, Westminster, Greater London, England. John died at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on 8 April 1820, aged 84. He was buried in St. Paul&#x27;s Church, where a tablet exists to his memory.

Government House remains the official residence of Nova Scotia&#x27;s Lieutenant-Governors.

&quot;The Governor&#x27;s Lady&quot;, by Thomas H. Raddall, is a novel based on the lives of John and Frances Wentworth.

Lieutenant Governor Wentworth employed a number of Maroons on his farm and in his household, as well as a few at Government House. Wentworth kept a Maroon mistress. They had at least one child, George Wentworth Colley (1804–1893). Wentworth&#x27;s farm was located near the foot of Long Lake.

<text>Aslan Abashidze (; born 20 July 1938) is the former leader of the Ajarian Autonomous Republic in western Georgia. He served in this capacity from 18 August 1991 to 5 May 2004. He resigned under the pressure of the central Georgian government and mass opposition rallies during the 2004 Adjara crisis, and has since lived in Moscow, Russia. On 22 January 2007, the Batumi city court found him guilty of misuse of office and embezzlement of GEL 98.2 million in state funds, and sentenced him to 15 years&#x27; imprisonment &quot;in absentia&quot;. He also faces a charge of murder of his former deputy, Nodar Imnadze, in 1991.

== Early life and career ==

Abashidze was born into a renowned Muslim Ajarian family, a branch of the Abashidze princely house. His grandfather Memed Abashidze was a famous writer and member of the Parliament of the Democratic Republic of Georgia between 1918 and 1921, but was shot on Joseph Stalin&#x27;s orders in 1937. His father was sent to the Gulag for ten years but survived. Despite a difficult childhood, during the 1950s Abashidze was able to obtain degrees in history and philosophy at Batumi University and in economics at Tbilisi State University. He worked as a teacher and economist for a period before joining Georgia&#x27;s regional public service. He was the director of several technical service institutes before being named a regional minister in Batumi, the capital of Ajaria, where he served as Minister of Community Service. He was later appointed the national First Deputy Minister of Community Service and moved to Tbilisi. This was, however, a relatively minor government post.

In spite of his descent from a renowned Muslim family that played a pivotal role in strengthening Georgian and Islamic identities among the Muslims of Ajaria, Aslan Abashidze converted to Christianity.

Abashidze is close to , the owner of the Vienna, Austria based Nordex.

== Abashidze and independent Georgia ==
When Georgia regained its independence on 9 April 1991, Abashidze secured his appointment as Chairman of the Supreme Council of the Autonomous Republic of Ajaria. He was also appointed Deputy Chairman of the Parliament of Georgia, a post that he retained in 1990–1992 and 1992–1995. He built an independent power base in Ajaria by steering a course between the Tbilisi government and the opposition. He established his own army as a counterweight to the armed factions that supported and opposed President Zviad Gamsakhurdia. 
When civil war broke out between pro- and anti-Gamsakhurdia forces in the winter of 1991–92 and again in the autumn of 1993, he kept both sides out of Ajaria, ensuring that the fighting did not spread to the republic.

However, unlike the rulers of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, he did not attempt to seek independence for Ajaria and pursued what can best be described as a policy of &quot;armed autonomy&quot; after the fall of Gamsakhurdia. He effectively turned Ajaria into a &quot;free economic zone&quot; with few restrictions on trade but with the customs duties and revenues going to his government rather than to Tbilisi.

Abashidze attracted some criticism for his heavy-handed rule, which was often described as feudal. He established his own political party in 1992, known variously as the Union of Democratic Revival or the Union for Georgia&#x27;s Rebirth. In 1998, he was elected President of Ajaria with 93% of the vote in what Russian observers regarded as a generally free and fair election.

He preferred to exercise influence from a distance, rather than attempting to bid for national power, and consistently adopted a policy of backing whoever seemed to offer the best deal for maintaining his rule over Ajaria. He reached an accommodation with President Eduard Shevardnadze, who appeared to have preferred to live with a semi-independent Ajaria rather than risk another civil war. His relations with Shevardnadze grew frosty at the end of the 1990s, as he and the government traded accusations of corruption and treason.

== Abashidze and the &quot;Rose Revolution&quot; ==
The forced resignation of Shevardnadze in November 2003 – widely dubbed the &quot;Rose Revolution&quot; – created a political crisis between Abashidze and the new government in Tbilisi. The Georgian opposition had strongly criticised Shevardnadze for failing to resolve the problem of separatism in the country, including what they saw as the lack of control which Tbilisi had over Ajaria. Not surprisingly, Abashidze saw this as a threat to his position and the continued semi-independence of Ajaria, and denounced the downfall of Shevardnadze as a &quot;coup&quot;. He declared a state of emergency in Ajaria and sought Russian support in the event of an open conflict. However, he failed to attract much support from Russia and came under intense pressure from the United States to compromise. On 25 January 2004, Abashidze met the newly elected President Mikhail Saakashvili in Batumi and declared his intention to work with Saakashvili.

This relationship soon foundered after Saakashvili vowed to restore central authority over Georgia&#x27;s separatist regions. In mid-March 2004, a motorcade carrying Saakashvili to planned political events in Ajaria ahead of the 28 March Georgian legislative elections was turned back by Ajarian border guards. Abashidze accused Saakashvili of leading a military convoy into the republic with the aim of overthrowing him, and declared a state of emergency in Ajaria and a mobilization of armed formations. In response, Saakashvili issued a one-day ultimatum to Abashidze to accept central authority and disband the Ajarian paramilitary forces. The government also closed transit routes into and out of Ajaria.

Amid high tension and widespread public demonstrations, foreign governments and international organisations appealed to both sides to exercise restraint and resolve their differences peacefully. Abashidze resigned as leader of Ajaria on 5 May 2004, when Special Forces entered the region and Adjarian paramilitary forces began to swap sides and disarm. The next day, after being granted assurances that he would not be extradited, Abashidze left for Moscow, without a shot being fired in the region.

Abashidze&#x27;s property in Georgia, as well as that of his close relatives, was frozen by the Georgian courts and eventually transferred to the state&#x27;s ownership. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as of December 2012, Abashidze was living in Barvikha village in Odintsovsky District of Moscow Oblast.

In August 2016, the Batumi City Court sentenced Abashidze to a 15-year imprisonment in absentia for multiple charges, including misuse of office, embezzlement, organization of terrorist attacks in 2004 and the murder of his former deputy, Nodar Imnadze, on 30 April 1991.
