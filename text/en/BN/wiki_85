<text>The music of Guatemala is diverse. Music is played all over the country. Towns also have wind and percussion bands that play during the lent and Easter-week processions as well as on other occasions. The marimba is an important instrument in Guatemalan traditional songs. The oldest documented use of marimba in the Americas dates to 1680 during celebrations at Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala.

Guatemala also has an almost five-century-old tradition of art music, spanning from the first liturgical chant and polyphony introduced in 1524 to contemporary art music. Much of the music composed in Guatemala from the 16th century to the 19th century has only recently been unearthed by scholars and is being revived by performers.

== Mayan music ==
Much of what is known about how the ancient Mayans created and played music comes from the iconography that is preserved in the ceremonial pieces of mural art, or codices. One example is found in the ancient Maya archaeological site of Bonampak, Mexico, where there are walls showing artwork of a group of Mayan warriors playing long trumpets, as portrayed in the Mayan theatrical play Rabinal Achí.

Many kinds of instruments were used, but they essentially broke down into two categories, being wind instruments (aerophones) and percussion instruments (idiophones). The wind instrument family consisted of cane and bone flutes, different types of whistles, ocarinas of various designs, and other sibilant vessels. For percussion instruments, the Mayans crafted wooden drums with membranes made from the hides of deer or jaguar. They also made rattles, güiros, and other idiophones using the shells of snails and tortoises. One of these percussion instruments called the “tunkul” (or sometimes just “tun”) is still seen in Guatemala today. It is made from a hollow tree trunk with an H-shaped incision whose resulting tongues are hit with rudimentary drumsticks.

The music the Mayans played was performed and danced to during festivities and rituals, usually in celebration of (or to communicate with) the gods that they worshiped. It appears that each god had their date or holiday, with its accompanying ceremonies and special music. 

==Folk music==
==Marimba==
The marimba&#x27;s first documentary evidence of existence comes from an account in front of the cathedral of Santiago de Guatemala, present-day Antigua Guatemala, in 1680. Later, historian Juan Domingo Juarros mentioned and described it in his &quot;Compendium of the History of Guatemala&quot;. The instrument may be probably much older, as an attempt at recreating an older West African instrument, and could have been introduced by Afro-Caribbean slaves as early as 1550.

By the early 20th century, wooden box resonators had replaced the gourd resonators. Modern marimba bands include a smaller marimba for three players, a larger marimba for four players, plus a drum kit or other percussion and a string bass. Some bands have occasionally employed one or two saxophones, as well as one or two trumpets and a trombone.

Much of the older repertoire of salon music was learned and adopted by the marimba bands, while a sizable amount of new dance pieces was newly composed for the marimba by such composers and marimba players as Domingo Bethancourt (1906–82), the Ovalle brothers, the Hurtado brothers, as well as the famous Mariano Valverde (1884–1956), Wotzbelí Aguilar (1897–1940) and Belarmino Molina (1879–1950), to name but a few. Singer Paco Pérez (1917–1951) was catapulted to fame with his waltz &quot;Luna de Xelajú&quot;, one of the best-known marimba pieces which is regarded by many Guatemalans as a sort of unofficial national anthem.

===Types of marimbas===

Marimba de Tecomates

This musical instrument is from Chichicastenango and it is made of palo de hormigo, a type of wood used for marimba manufacture, and pumpkins (tecomates). This type of marimba is played by a single person who is requested to liven up concerts of the brotherhood from Chichicastenango. Marimbas have many sizes and shapes and that is what makes this instrument so unique.

Marimba Simple

The soundboards of the marimba simple are made of wood such as cedar or cypress. It is tuned according to the key, and with a membrane glued with wax at the lower end, which allows the “charlco” (marimba stick) to facilitate the prolongation of the sound. 
The construction of the first marimba was diatonic, related to a key, and because it is easy to play it was called Marimba Simple. Sometimes the performers want a different sound so to get a “flattened” sound, the performers would stick a small ball of wax at one end of the keyboard, which flattens the sound down by a half tone. To marimba players this technique is called “transport”, and it is very common to see this technique applied to the marimba simple.

Arch or Ring Marimba

The arch marimba was probably the first, followed by a simple instrument with a diatonic row of wood bars played with mallets, with gourd resonators, placed on a wooden a stand. In 1894 came a major breakthrough when Julián Paniagua Martínez and Sebastián Hurtado developed the chromatic marimba by adding to the diatonic row of sound bars, comparable to the white keys of the piano, a second row equivalent to the black keys.

Marimba concert

The marimba concert is played by several musicians at a time. It was created when the Directorate General of Culture and Fine Arts belonged to the Ministry of Education. Master Lester Godinez was its first music director and Professor Ruben Alfonso Ramirez served as Director General of the administrative unit authorized for operation as of May 1, 1979. Its co-founders were Otoniel Godinez (assistant director), Alfonso Bautista Vasquez, Roberto Garcia, Gérman Amilcar Corzo, Manuel Toribio, Fidel Funes, Mario Bautista Vásquez and Erick Godoy Cámbara.

Chromatic Marimba

Chromatic Marimba is the standard marimba known worldwide. Developed in the southeast of Mexico and Guatemala inspired by the science of the marimba simple. It has the same functionality as the marimba simple but the difference is the chromaticism that this instrument has. This marimba is chromatic because you can have all 12 notes of the scale.

Marimba Cuache or Marimba Doble

This marimba was built with a double keyboard, one larger than the other representing the basic idea of the piano keys. It is very versatile to play and 3 or 4 performers can play it at the same time. This gives the performance more color and the whole spectrum of the high, mid and low register is used throughout the performance.

Lord Sebastian Hurtado, a native of Quetzaltenango, was the first person to build a marimba with a double keyboard, capable of producing chromatic scales around the beginning of the 20th century. Its construction was a suggestion of the musician Julian Paniagua Martinez. The first concert featuring a marimba doble in the City of Guatemala was in the year 1899, on the birthday of President Manuel Estrada Cabrera, where the Hurtado brothers gave a show for the president and all were very pleased with the result and versatility of the performance.

Marimba grande

The marimba grande is the larger of the two keyboards that make up the double marimba (marimba doble). It reflects the representative style in the construction of instruments from Guatemala. It is fully hand-made and the variety of wood they use gives this marimba a warm sound. Although over time, builders have added some metal support reinforcements to the structure of the marimba to make it more durable and stable. This instrument has a range of six octaves, from F-sharp to B-natural. The bars range in size from 5 inches x 3 / 4 to 15 x 3 inches. The instrument is 8.3 feet long and 9 inches wide at the lower end.

==Garifuna music==
Garifuna originated from escaped Island Caribs who were deported from St. Vincent to Central America (especially Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and also in Nicaragua in 1802) by the British when they conquered St. Vincent. The Garifunas kept themselves apart from the social system then dominant, leading to a distinctive culture that include chumba and hunguhungu, a circular dance in a three beat rhythm, which is often combined with punta, their national genre.

There are other songs typical to each gender, women&#x27;s eremwu eu and abaimajani, rhythmic a cappella songs, and laremuna wadauman, men&#x27;s work songs. Other forms of dance music include matamuerte, gunchei, charikawi and sambai.

==Music following European classical music tradition==
The field of music, otherwise known as &quot;classical music&quot;, includes various musical styles such as Renaissance, baroque, classical, romantic, 20th-century music, and post-modern music. Guatemala was one of the first regions of the New World to be exposed to European music. The Spanish missionaries and clergy introduced Flemish and Spanish liturgical music during the early 16th century as part of the Roman Catholic rite.

The first cathedral (1534) at the newly founded city of Santiago de Guatemala was endowed with a choir in charge of plainchant and Latin polyphony. Later in the century three chapel masters from the Iberian peninsula enriched the cathedral&#x27;s repertoire with their compositions: Hernando Franco (1532–85), Pedro Bermúdez (1558–1605), and Gaspar Fernández (1566–1629). Scholars have shown that musical activity in the missions of Huehuetenango, in the northwestern mountains of present-day Guatemala, was significant. Native musicians learned the art of polyphonic composition from the missionaries and also contributed a number of villancicos in Spanish and local Mayan languages to the repertory of matins and vespers music at their parish churches.

The main composers during the late baroque and pre-classical period were Guatemalan-born chapel masters of the cathedral, Manuel José de Quirós (d. 1765) and Rafael Antonio Castellanos (d. 1791). The latter successfully introduced Guatemalan folk-music elements in his vocal works, especially his villancicos for Christmas, which often show traits of Afro-Caribbean and Mayan rhythms, melodies, and accompaniment styles. His 176 extant works reflect Castellanos&#x27; mastery of the style of his time, as well as an unusual originality based on plainchant models, baroque part-writing, and the frequent inclusion folk-music idioms.

Several of Castellanos&#x27; disciples attained mastery of the villancico and the cantata, as is reflected by extant works by Pedro Antonio Rojas, Manuel Silvestre Pellegeros, Francisco Aragón, and Pedro Nolasco Estrada Aristondo. The successor of the latter as chapel master of the cathedral was Vicente Sáenz, who served in that capacity from 1804 to his death in 1841. The organist during his tenure was his son Benedicto Sáenz the elder, who prematurely died in 1831.

Among the composers of classical style the most important Guatemalan composer is José Eulalio Samayoa (1781-ca. 1866), the first musician in the New World to write symphonies besides a sizable amount of church music. His Seventh Symphony, dedicated to the victory of the Federal Army at Xiquilisco in present-day El Salvador, is a model of classical balance. His later &quot;Sinfonía Cívica&quot; and &quot;Sinfonía Histórica&quot; are kept in an early romantic idiom, with frequent programmatic episodes. José Escolástico Andrino, who worked in Guatemala City, Havana, and El Salvador during the first half of the 19th century, also composed several symphonies.

The brilliant young musician Benedicto Sáenz, the younger (d. 1857) on the other hand wrote much church music, such as his &quot;Messa Solenne&quot; published in Paris by advice of the Italian composer, Saverio Mercadante . At the same time, Sáenz and his brother Anselmo were the first to introduce Italian opera to Guatemala from 1843 on, an enterprise that after initial failures would turn into a huge success, leading to the construction of the magnificent National Theatre, later called Teatro Colón. An Italian opera company arrived in 1871 bringing Pietro Visoni as orchestra conductor and his wife Luisa Riva de Visoni as prima donna. Visoni was the former organist of the Duomo (cathedral) of Milan. After successful performances in the Teatro Colón and arriving at the time of a liberal revolution, maestro Visoni was asked by President Miguel Garcia Granados to take charge of the bands of the 1st and 2nd battalions of the Guatemalan army. Visoni merged the two bands and officially established the Martial Symphony Band (still in existence). Since there were not enough trained musicians in the country, Visoni created Guatemala&#x27;s first music conservatory, the School of Substitutes (known today as Military School of Music Maestro Rafael Alvarez Ovalle). The School of Substitutes became the breeding ground for some of Guatemala&#x27;s greatest composers, including Rafael Alvarez Ovalle, composer of the national anthem. In the 1940s members of the band were among the founding members of the National Symphony Orchestra.

The late 19th century is represented in Guatemala by several trends: the aforementioned introduction of opera, the training abroad of several highly talented pianist-composers, the influence of military band music, and the invention and development of the chromatic marimba.

Piano music was enormously furthered by scholarships for study in Italy and France awarded to several young talents. Thus, Luis Felipe Arias (1876–1908), Herculano Alvarado (1879–1921), Julián González, and Miguel Espinosa could present piano music by Ludwig van Beethoven, Frédéric Chopin, and Franz Liszt never heard before in Guatemala. They had also considerable influence on younger composers such as Rafael Vásquez, Alfredo Wyld and Rafael A. Castillo, all of whom flourished during the first decades of the twentieth century.

A group of composers furthered and instructed by the Prussian conductor and bandmaster, Emil Dressner, came from the realm of military bands and salon music. Germán Alcántara (1856–1911), Rafael Álvarez Ovalle (1855–1946), Manuel Moraga (1833–96), Julián Paniagua Martínez (1856–1946) and Fabián Rodríguez (1862–1929) contributed a number of salon pieces, opera fantasies, and dances to the repertoire of bands and pianists.

Another important achievement was the invention and development of the chromatic marimba in the highland town of Quetzaltenango in 1894, by Julián Paniagua Martínez and the marimba builder, Sebastián Hurtado. This new development made it possible to play the fashionable dance and salon music on the marimbas, which previously had been restricted to the diatonic scale. As a result, Guatemalan light music achieved an enormous dissemination at home and abroad by countless marimba bands that were formed from the beginning of the twentieth century. Much of the music of that time is still alive in the memorized repertoire of present-day marimba groups.

By the end of the nineteenth and in the first part of the 20th century, several composers developed a keen interest in Mayan mythology and folk music, on which they based their scenic and concert compositions. Jesús Castillo (1877–1946) was the first musician to collect a sizable amount of folk tunes, which he later used in works such as his opera &quot;Quiché Vinak&quot;, as well as ouvertures and symphonic poems. His half brother Ricardo Castillo (1891–1966) studied in Paris, where he acquired impressionistic and neo-classical techniques. His piano music, as well as his orchestral output, reflects the fusion of his contemporary art with Mayan mythology such as legends and myths from the &quot;Popol Vuh.&quot; José Castañeda (1898–1983) also took keen interest in the Mayan past in his stage works such as the ballet &quot;La serpiente emplumada&quot; (The Feathered Snake), premiered in 1958, while his two symphonies his string quartets are much more experimental.

Composers from the next generation, some of them Ricardo Castillo&#x27;s and José Castañeda&#x27;s students who could also profit from the teachings of the Austrian composer, Franz Ippisch, continued to focus on the autochthonous Guatemalan cultures. In their stage, vocal, and instrumental works, they have shown an interest in Mayan and Garifuna cultural elements, which they have stylized in different ways. Among these, Joaquín Orellana (b. 1930) has developed idiophones and aerophones derived from the marimba and other folk instruments, which he uses in some of his aleatory compositions that deal with the social strife of present-day ethnic groups.

Among his former students, the Gandarias brothers have focused on electronic process of folk-music and bird calls recorded on site, producing several discs. At the beginning of the new millennium, two multimedia works by contemporary composer Dieter Lehnhoff, &quot;Memorias de un día remoto&quot; (Memories of a Distant Day) and &quot;Rituales nocturnos&quot; (Night Rituals) have evoked the Mayan past in a more contemporary style, being conceived as the soundtrack to an imaginary film. The sojourn of the Garifuna to Central American shores on the other hand is the subject of &quot;Satuyé&quot;, his opera in progress. Among the younger composers, several have written works in a variety of post-modern styles, often returning to traditional or free tonality in their vocal and instrumental compositions.

In 1930 comes to air radio TGW, the Voice Guatemala, first station of long wave. Later, in 1946, begins the time of the national broadcasting. In that period, the transmitters produced dramatized pieces, arose programs from quality that could compete with the foreigners; the broadcasting reached their maximum development. The station has had an entertainment focus, featuring artist such as: Paco Pérez, Gustavo Adolfo Palma, Juan de Dios Quezada, Manolo Rosales, Jorge Mario Paredes and Ernesto Rosales.

===Music life===

Present-day Guatemala boasts a number of performing organizations, such as orchestras, choirs, chamber ensembles, opera troupes, soloists and dozens of rock bands.

The &quot;Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional&quot; was founded in after the 1944 Revolution, transforming from an earlier government orchestra called &quot;Orquesta Progresista&quot;. For several years it was directed by the notable violinist, Andrés Archila. In 1964 a permanent conductor was appointed Ricardo del Carmen, who was joined in the early 1970s by Jorge Sarmientos, another music director. In 1991, after both conductors retired, the orchestra decided to dispense with a permanent music director, working only with guest artists. As a result, many of the orchestra&#x27;s concerts are conducted by some of its members, who are not necessarily trained in orchestral conducting. This orchestra is endowed with subsidy from the government to cover salaries and expenses. It has yearly seasons, one of which includes international guests; the other seasons are popular and didactic in nature.

The &quot;Orquesta Sinfónica Juvenil&quot; was founded in 1970 by Manuel Alvarado Coronado. It was a youth orchestra, and its members were students at different schools in Guatemala City. Without financial support, it was forced to develop its activities with the aid of parents.

The &quot;Orquesta Millennium&quot; is an independent organization founded in 1993 by Dieter Lehnhoff and Cristina Altamira. Initially called &quot;Nueva Orquesta Filarmónica&quot;, it played its first concert seasons in the Auditorium of the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, as well as other locations. It made its first CD &quot;La Sociedad Filarmónica&quot; in 1993, with premiere recordings of works by Guatemalan classical composers José Eulalio Samayoa, José Escolástico Andrino, and Benedicto Sáenz, the younger. In 1998 it was appointed official orchestra of the City of Guatemala, under the protection of the Mayor and City Council, with the name of &quot;Orquesta Metropolitana&quot;. In 2004 it separated from the City government, became independent again, and changed its name to &quot;Millennium Orchestra&quot;. The Orchestra has recorded the highly successful CDs &quot;Valses inolvidables de Guatemala&quot; and &quot;Melodías inolvidables de Guatemala&quot;, both of them with music by Guatemalan composers.

The &quot;Orquesta Clásica&quot; was founded in the early 1990s. It is a private orchestra, which plays at the Universidad Francisco Marroquín for their classical season. Since the death of its original leader in 2003, it has been conducted by guests. In September 2007 the university cancelled all of the remaining season concerts and withdrew its support.

The &quot;Orquesta Sinfónica Jesús Castillo&quot;, a youth orchestra, was established in 1997, after a series of workshops conducted by a group of Venezuelan instrumental teachers. Its members are students of the National Conservatory and other privates academies. Its first musical director was Igor Sarmientos 1997–2007. This orchestra had the partial support of the government to cover their expenses until 2007.

Among the choirs active in Guatemala, the oldest organization is the &quot;Coro Nacional&quot;, founded after the 1944 Revolution as &quot;Coro Guatemala&quot;. Over the decades, it has introduced many works by European composers, as well as numerous Guatemalan songs and choral compositions. It is the only choral group with government support, and offers several yearly concert sessions.

The university choirs are also very important, and gather in yearly traditional choral festivals. There are also independent, and amateur choral organizations. At the beginning of the new millennium, several choirs of children and young have sprouted, not only in Guatemala City, but also in towns and rural areas.

There are several chamber ensembles such as wind quintets, string quartets, brass choirs, and groups specializing in baroque performance practices. Among these, the &quot;Millennium Ensemble&quot; has raised much attention by their first performances of Renaissance, baroque, and classical works from colonial Guatemala, which they have presented at festivals and concerts in Europe, North- and South America. Since their first CD, released in 1992, up to their twelfth CD &quot;Joyas del Barroco in Guatemala&quot; (2006), they have revived numerous works of 18th-century composers as Manuel José de Quirós, Rafael Antonio Castellanos, and Pedro Nolasco Estrada Aristondo, with mezzo-soprano Cristina Altamira performing villancicos and cantatas for different occasions of the Catholic liturgical year.

Opera has also regained favour, with yearly performances at local festivals in Guatemala City and Antigua Guatemala. Guatemalan Baritone Luis Girón May (b. 1953, d. August 2013) has been influential in obtaining significant sponsorships for the staging of several operas by Verdi and Puccini. Foreign opera companies also visit the country on occasion, performing in the magnificent National Theatre in Guatemala City or on historical locations in Antigua Guatemala.

There are also well known film scoring composers from Guatemala such as Pieter Schlosser and Mauricio Trabanino.

==Modern popular music==

In recent decades, Guatemala has produced a variety of popular performers, such as pop vocalists, Guatemalan rock bands, bachata, salsa and merengue bands, hip hop and reggaeton, disk-jockeys, trios, and mariachi bands. The best known popsinger/songwriter from Guatemala is Ricardo Arjona.

One of the better-known pop-rock bands during the 1980s and 90s was the group Alux Nahual. While this group has been separated since 1998, their recordings are still favoured by a certain age group of Guatemalan city-dwellers. In the teen pop genre, artists like Vanessa Spatz were exported internationally, with the support of Siempre En Domingo and toured broadly around Latin America. Her music being distributed worldwide by PolyGram. She retired as a performer in 1991 and continued her career as a producer and songwriter, co-producing the song &quot;Email Me&quot; for Jose Jose with Luny Tunes for the record label Bertelsmann Music Group known as BMG.
Notable vocalists from the 20th century include Luis Galich, Roberto Rey, Herman May, Tania Zea, Karim May, and Elizabeth.

==Alternative music==
Bands such as Bohemia Suburbana, Viernes verde, La Tona and E.x.t.i.n.c.i.o.n. were the cornerstone for the alternative rock movement of the 90s, during the time of the post-war in Guatemala. These bands still enjoy a level of success, mostly because during that time FM Radio (stations such as Doble S then renamed Atmosfera, FM Fenix, Metroestereo, La Marca) represented a huge push for rock bands.

There were also underground movements during the 90s that went the opposite direction; with bands such as Pusher (metal), Fuerza X (hardcore), Domestic Fool (punk) among others setting new styles outside the mainstream movements.
Recently there has been a documentary called &quot;Alternativa&quot; which documents the alternative and Garra Chapina movement from the 90s to this day.

Today, the musical scene in Guatemala is populated by diverse bands and vocalists. Online radio El Circo del Rock promotes the diverse talent nationally and abroad, but it is still directed to a 90s audience.

==Underground music==

During the year 2006, the last Rock station on FM disappeared from the airwaves and there was no longer support from the media. As a result, several hundreds of musicians started developing musical styles on underground movements and selfproducing, and also because of the lack of support from the media, the bands started promoting on the internet on sites such as Myspace.com and Rockrepublik.net and targeted on smaller audiences in more specific music genres, this also had as a consequence an overpopulation of musical projects which are still (nowadays) looking for a way to bring a new face to music in Guatemala.

In 2010 there are several projects which have been transcending among the overpopulated underground movement:
Dubvolution in reggae dub.
Evilminded in electronic Music.
Treateth, Virus Belico, Metal Requiem and Zarkasmo in Metal.
Los Mojarras and Xb&#x27;alanke in instrumental music.
and several other artists such as None at Last, Assabeth, Silent Poetry, Trinky, Madam Funtoo and pop sensation Woodser.

Perhaps the best known bands are Bohemia Suburbana, La Tona, Viernes Verde, Viento en Contra, Malacates Trebol Shop and El Tambor de la Tribu, although there are many others. Notable popular singers include a new generation of pop stars such as Tuco Cardenas (whose music genre is actually folk), Magda Angélica, Shery, Carlos Catania, Tavo Barcenas, Giovanni Passarelli, Raul Aguirre and Carlos Peña, just to name a few.

In Metal music there are bands like Treateth, Virus Belico, Celula, Zarcasmo, Metal Requiem, E.X.T.I.N.C.I.O.N., TOBA, Astaroth, A Walking Legend and to many others.

Guatemala also has a growing rap scene with artists like Última Dosis, Kontra, Rebeca Lane, N.D.R., Expresión Illegal, Ikari, Bacteria Sound System Crew, Aliotos Lokos, among others.

<text>Emperor Shenzong of Song (25 May 1048 – 1 April 1085), personal name Zhao Xu, was the sixth emperor of the Song dynasty of China. His original personal name was Zhao Zhongzhen but he changed it to &quot;Zhao Xu&quot; after he acceded to the throne. He reigned from 1067 until his death in 1085 and is best known for supporting Wang Anshi&#x27;s New Policies. He was a particularly active monarch concerned with solving the fiscal, bureaucratic, and military problems of the Song dynasty, but his reign remains controversial. 

==Reign==

===Personality===
Emperor Shenzong disagreed with the passive stance of his predecessors and wanted to improve the Song Dynasty&#x27;s prestige via conquest. This irridentist attitude also contributed towards his desire to centralize fiscal matters: he told his war minister Wen Yanbo that &quot;if we are to raise troops for our frontier campaigns, then our treasuries must be full.&quot; Furthermore, Shenzong was dissatisfied with the growing powers of ministers such as chief councilor Han Chi. Shenzong&#x27;s goals were opposed by the conservatives, particularly Fu Bi and Sima Guang, who were concerned with his expansion of monarchical power and who wanted to maintain the peaceful equilibrium with the Western Xia and the Liao Dynasty. Shenzong respected the conservative faction: he kept Fu Bi in the capital until 1072 and had close relations with Sima Guang, whom he admired for his morality and intelligence.

===Muslim mercenaries===
Emperor Shenzong hired Muslim warriors from Bukhara to fight against the Khitan Liao dynasty. 5,300 Muslim men from Bukhara were encouraged and invited to move to China in 1070 by Shenzong to help battle the Liao empire in the northeast and repopulate areas ravaged by fighting. The emperor hired these men as mercenaries in his campaign against the Liao dynasty. Later on, these men were settled between the Song capital of Bianliang (today Kaifeng) and Yenching (modern Beijing). The circuits (道) of the north and northeast were settled in 1080 when 10,000 more Muslims were invited into China.

===Economy during the Xining-Yuanfeng period===
The minting of copper coins was the main form of money since the early Song dynasty. It peaked during Emperor Shenzong&#x27;s reign, with 5.06 million guan minted in 1080, over six times more than 800,000 guan at the Northern Song&#x27;s start. From 1074 to 1085, an average of 4.5 million guan were minted annually, dropping to 3 million under Emperor Huizong.

Agricultural tax collected in autumn and summer made up about a third of the state’s tax revenue over the ten year-Xining period. Most taxes, including a third of the agricultural tax, were paid in cash, showing a highly monetized financial structure. Industrial and commercial taxes contributed two thirds of the tax revenue.

====Wang Anshi&#x27;s New Policies====
During his reign in 1068, Emperor Shenzong became interested in Wang Anshi&#x27;s policies and appointed Wang as the Chancellor. Wang implemented his famous New Policies aimed at improving the situation for the peasantry and unemployed. These acts became the hallmark reform of Emperor Shenzong&#x27;s reign.

Before Shenzong took the throne in 1067, there was pressure on the Song dynasty to make economic reforms. The Song dynasty&#x27;s rigorous civil service examinations rejuvenated humanist-oriented Confucian elite culture; in particular, the literati wanted to improve the material conditions of the people. Additionally, the humiliating loss against the Western Xia in the 1040s (as well as the unfavorable terms of the Treaty of Chanyuan) created, according to Sogabe Shizuo, a &quot;perpetual wartime fiscal regime&quot;. Shenzong was particularly driven by his irridentist determination to recover the Sixteen Prefectures. 

Immediately after taking the throne in 1067, Emperor Shenzong established the Office of Expenditure Reduction with Sima Guang at its head to improve Song finances. Sima refused and instead issued a scathing report discussing the immensity of the dynasty&#x27;s financial problems. Indeed, defense consumed 83% of the dynasty&#x27;s cash income, while the expanding and already-large bureaucracy was very costly to maintain. In 1069, after failing again to gain support for reform from the official Fu Bi, Shenzong made Wang Anshi the head of government and supported his consolidation of power and his New Policies.

The Seedling Law, Law on the Exemption from Military Service, Market Exchange Law, and the rise of monopolies on salt, tea, and &quot;jiu&quot; helped centralize and fully monetize the Song fiscal policy. The monetary policy of the Xining-Yuanfeng period (1068-1085) strongly supported the new laws.

====Personal involvement in the New Policies====
Shenzong largely delegated authority to Wang until his retirement in 1076. An exception was when Shenzong advised Wang Anshi and Chen Shengzhi in early winter 1069 to abandon the Finance Planning Commission (which Wang had set up earlier that year) and instead rely on their power as Secretariats to manage the economy. Wang refused, reasoning that the Commission was needed to coordinate fiscal matters between the Secretariat and the Military Affairs Commission. He rejected Shenzong&#x27;s proposal to have Wang head the Commission himself on the same grounds. In another instance, Shenzong proposed the restoration of the equal-field system (a system of land redistribution instated by the Northern Wei and used through the Tang dynasty), but Wang Anshi dismissed the idea as impractical. Shenzong&#x27;s fascination with the revenue-generating potential of interest prompted him to invest heavily in a new price control policy, despite complaints from merchants and consumers about governmental harassment.

Shenzong and Wang Anshi also pursued direct military reforms. In theory, each commandery was 500 troops strong, but in actuality, the number was much lower and contained many old or weak soldiers due to corruption. Shenzong cut down the number of excess troops so that the entire army was less than 900,000 strong and established the Area Generalship System to improve communications, discipline, and troop levy efficiency. Meanwhile, the Baojia system was introduced as a village defense system intended to bolster domestic security and provide further support to the regular army.

Though the New Policies gave Shenzong a large budget surplus, they failed to achieve their goal of improving the Song dynasty&#x27;s military. The Western Xia continued to inflict defeats on the Song and an attack on the Liao dynasty remained unthinkable. This was caused by continually low army quality, poor logistics, and overall poor leadership. The Baojia system, for example, did not produce troops capable enough to replace the imperial army. The military failures of the Reforms, to which Shenzong had devoted immense amounts of energy, contributed to his eventual illness and death. The New Policies&#x27; circumvention of checks on central power was controversial from the onset; both Fu Bi and Sima Guang wrote memorials to Shenzong advising him to balance governmental function, respect the bureaucratic process, and not to support Wang Anshi.

====Yuanfeng Reforms====
In 1074, a severe drought afflicted Northern China. Many officials such as Han Wei thought that this was heaven’s punishment for instating the New Policies. This, along with the general controversy surrounding the New Polices and Wang’s own misbehavior regarding court factions prompted Shenzong to remove him from his post as chief minister in 1074. Shenzong nonetheless remained on the side of the reformers and retained Wang as a mentor. Lü Huiqing, a reformer, gained Shenzong’s favor and harshly opposed Wang while building up his own power base. His own misbehavior broke up the reformist coalition and Wang was recalled to the capital to replace Lü. Wang did not stay for long and an astronomical omen (along with further misbehavior such as pretending to be sick and overworking his son to death) prompted the distraught man’s permanent retirement in 1076.

Following Wang Anshi&#x27;s permanent retirement in 1076, Shenzong took personal control of the reform agenda and launched the Yuanfeng Reforms. He first significantly expanded his personal power and used the domineering official Cai Jue to keep the conservatives, many of whom had been invited back to court, in line with the emperor. In 1082, Shenzong restructured the bureaucracy and restored the Tang model of a central government organized around the Six Ministries by creating the Secretariat, Chancellery, and Department of State Affairs to balance the departments against each other. However, due to design flaws, the Secretariat quickly came to dominate the other two departments. Moreover, the strict division of the bureaucracy, in which every policy initiative had to take a complicated route to be approved, was inefficient. With Shenzong himself as the most active policy maker, this inefficiency was largely unproblematic, but the reigns of the child-emperor Zhezong and the incompetent emperor Huizong exposed the redundancy of such a system. 

The Finance Commission and Exchequer of Imperial Lands (institutions that predated the New Policies) were dissolved and replaced by the Ministry of Revenue. Shenzong made the Yuanfeng Treasury to raise funds for a renewed offensive against the Western Xia; although the offensive was defeated, the Treasury remained as a depository for revenues from both the New Policies and state-run monopolies. Both the Ministry of Revenue and the Yuanfeng Treasury exercised substantial control over Song fiscal resources. The Yuanfeng Reforms were likely inspired by institutional reform proposals made during the reign of Emperor Renzong of Song and a concern towards the growing power of the Chief counsilorship, but the reforms&#x27; rigidity likely contributed to the autocratic nature of the later dynasty. Unlike the New Policies, the Yuanfeng Reforms likely escaped the conservative anti-reform movement headed by Sima Guang and Grand Dowager Empress Xuanren due to their Tang inspiration and Shenzong&#x27;s hand in heading them.

===Campaign against Vietnam===
Emperor Shenzong sent campaigns against the Vietnamese ruler Lý Nhân Tông of the Lý dynasty in 1076.

===Embassy from the Byzantine Empire===
Aside from the ancient Roman embassies to Han and Three-Kingdoms era China, contact with Europe remained sparse if not nonexistent before the 13th century. However, from Chinese records it is known that Michael VII Doukas (Mie li yi ling kai sa 滅力伊靈改撒) of Fo lin (i.e. the Byzantine Empire) dispatched a diplomatic mission to China&#x27;s Song dynasty that arrived in 1081, during the reign of Emperor Shenzong.

===Campaign against the Western Xia dynasty===

Emperor Shenzong&#x27;s other notable act as emperor was his attempt to weaken the Tangut-led Western Xia state by invading and expelling the Western Xia forces from Qing prefecture (庆州, today Qingyang, Gansu Province). The Song army was initially quite successful in these campaigns, but during the battle for the city of Yongle (永乐城), in 1082, Song forces were defeated. As a result, Western Xia grew more powerful and subsequently continued to be a thorn in the side of the Song Empire over the ensuing decades.

===Zizhi Tongjian and other literary works===
Sima Guang, a minister interested in the history of the previous 1000 years, published the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot; or &quot;A Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government&quot; in 1084. This book records historical events from the Zhou dynasty to the Song dynasty. Another notable literary achievement that occurred during his reign was the compilation of the Seven Military Classics, including the alleged forgery of the &quot;Questions and Replies between Tang Taizong and Li Weigong.&quot;
== Death and legacy ==
The disastrous defeat at the battle of Yongle City in 1082 during the Song invasion of Western Xia completely broke Shenzong’s spirit. In tears, he berated his councilors and said “Not a single one of you said that the [Yongle City] campaign was wrong.” He was crushed by the realization that his reforms, into which he had poured immense amounts of time and energy, had failed. Accordingly, his reformist zeal slowed down and he increasingly favored the conservatives, particularly Sima Guang. In Autumn 1084, Shenzong sensed he was dying and entrusted the heir to Sima Guang and Lü Gongzhu. 

Emperor Shenzong died in early 1085 at the age of 36 from an unspecified illness and was succeeded by his son, Zhao Xu who took the throne as Emperor Zhezong. Emperor Zhezong was underage and so Shenzong’s mother Empress Gao ruled as regent until her death. A political struggled ensued following Shenzong’s death. The Emperss Dowager’s conservative faction (which included Sima Guang, Lü Gongzhu, the famous poet Su Shi, and the co-founder of Neo-confucianism, Cheng Hao) defeated Cai Jue’s faction. The conservatives went on to repeal the New Polices and purge the court of remaining reformers.

<text>Bořivoj I (, , 852 – 889) was the first historically documented Duke of Bohemia and progenitor of the Přemyslid dynasty. His reign over the Duchy of Bohemia is believed to have started about the year 870, but in this era Bohemia was subordinated to Great Moravia. One of the most important clues to the approximate time of his accession is the contemporary Frankish chronicle &quot;Annales Fuldenses,&quot; which mentions several West Slavic princes in the year 872, among them one &quot;Goriwei,&quot; who may be identical with Bořivoj.

==Life==
According to the early 12th-century &quot;Chronica Boëmorum&quot;, Bořivoj was a son of the legendary Bohemian prince Hostivít, thus a descendant of Queen Libuše and her husband Přemysl the Ploughman. His ancestry has not been conclusively established by historians, however. In view of his dependence on Great Moravia, he might have been related by blood to the Mojmir dynasty. DNA testing on the remains of his son, Spytihněv, suggests the family&#x27;s Y-haplogroup was R1b, common to Western Europe and Czech Republic.

Bořivoj initially resided at Levý Hradec, a gord situated northwest of present-day Prague. As the head of the Přemyslids who dominated the Central Bohemian environs, Bořivoj declared himself &quot;kníže&quot; (&quot;prince&quot;)—in Latin &quot;dux&quot;, which means a sovereign prince—around the year 867 AD. His title was later translated by German scholars as &quot;duke&quot; (&quot;Herzog&quot;) of the Bohemian (Czechs). Although the rulers of the German stem duchies emerging in the late 9th century held the same title, the meaning of his title was in fact completely different. In contrast to the German dukes who acted as the representatives of higher rulers (kings or emperors), the Czech &quot;dux&quot; denoted a sovereign ruler. Bořivoj was recognised as such around 872 by his overlord King Svatopluk I of Moravia, who dispatched Bishop Methodius of Thessalonica to begin the Christianization of Bohemia. 

In 872, Bořivoj supported Svatopluk militarily in his dispute with the East Frankish king Louis the German, and in south Bohemia, they defeated the Frankish troops. About 874, Bořivoj married Ludmila (later canonized as St. Ludmila of Bohemia). The couple had two known sons, Spytihněv and Vratislaus, both of whom succeeded him as dukes. Ludmila and Bořivoj were baptised by Methodius (probably in 883), and the latter became an enthusiastic evangelist, although the religion failed to take root among Bořivoj&#x27;s subjects. 

In the years 883/884, Bořivoj was deposed by a revolt in support of his Přemyslid kinsman Strojmír. He was restored in 885 only with the support of his Svatopluk of Moravia. The duke or (more probably) his son Spytihněv moved his residence to the Hradčany mountain and laid the foundations for Prague Castle. When Bořivoj died about 889, his sons still minors, King Svatopluk concluded an agreement with the East Frankish ruler Arnulf of Carinthia and took over the rule of the Bohemian duchy himself. 

As with most of the early Bohemian rulers, Bořivoj is a shadowy figure; exact dates for his reign and vital statistics cannot be established. Nonetheless, several major fortifications and religious foundations are said to have dated from this time.

<text>Spytihněv I ( 875 – 915), a member of the Přemyslid dynasty, was Duke of Bohemia from 889 (under regency until 894 or 895) until his death in 915.

==Life==
He was the eldest son of Duke Bořivoj I, the first historically documented Bohemian ruler, and his wife Ludmila. Because Spytihněv and his younger brother Vratislaus were still minors at the time of their father&#x27;s death about 889, the Bohemian lands were placed under the regency of their suzerain, the Great Moravian ruler Svatopluk I.

After Svatopluk died in 894, an inheritance conflict arose between his sons Mojmír II and Svatopluk II. Spytihněv took advantage of the situation to free himself from Moravian vassalage. According to the Frankish chronicle &quot;Annales Fuldenses&quot;, he appeared with another Bohemian duke Witizla at the Imperial Diet (&quot;Reichstag&quot;) in Regensburg in 895 and paid homage to the East Frankish King Arnulf of Carinthia. This was an important first step in detaching Bohemia from Moravian rule. He reinforced Přemyslid rule in Central Bohemia around present-day Prague, having several castles erected along the borders of his realm at Mělník, Libušín, Tetín, Lštění, and Boleslav. He also continued the extension of Prague Castle as the administrative centre of the rising Přemyslid duchy as a replacement for the early medieval gord of Levý Hradec.

Spytihněv further strengthened ties with East Francia by forming an alliance with Margrave Luitpold of Bavaria, who in 898 fought against Mojmír II with the result that Bohemia finally separated from the Greater Moravian realm. Designed to protect Bohemia against the ravages of Hungarian invasions, the alliance with East Francia also opened Bohemia to Carolingian culture and paved the way for the eventual triumph of Roman Catholicism in Czech spiritual affairs.

He was confirmed to buried in the Church of the Virgin Mary in Prague Castle, as were many members of the royal Přemyslid dynasty during this period.

== DNA ==
DNA testing on his remains suggests the Přemysl family&#x27;s Y-haplogroup was R1b, common to Western Europe and Czech Republic.

<text>Major Brabazon-Plank (possibly later Major Plank) is a fictional character created by British comic writer P. G. Wodehouse, being a famed explorer who led an expedition up the Amazon but is afraid of babies.

Major Brabazon-Plank (who appears in the Uncle Fred novel &quot;Uncle Dynamite&quot;) and Major Plank (who appears in the Jeeves novels &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot; and &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot;) have been interpreted by some Wodehouse scholars as being the same character, while others have described them as being two similar but separate characters.

==Overview==
In &quot;Uncle Dynamite&quot;, Major Brabazon-Plank (also called Major Plank) is a famed explorer who led at least one expedition up the Amazon River in Brazil. He is a fat, pear-shaped man and a perpetual eater. He was educated at Eton, where he was called &quot;Bimbo&quot;, and is a former Governor of a Crown colony. While in Peru, Major Plank judged a bonny baby competition, where the mother of one of the honourable mentions was unhappy with the results and stabbed him in the leg. (He will show the scar when asked.) This experience has instilled in him a lifelong phobia of babies and marriage (&#x27;as marriages lead to bonny babies, and bonny babies lead to bonny baby competitions&#x27;).

He has recently come back from leading an expedition up the Amazon with Bill Oakshott. Visiting Ashenden Manor, he finds Uncle Fred, whom he knew at Eton, usurping his identity.

In &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot; and &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot;, Major Plank is a retired explorer. An elderly, tanned, square-faced man, he was an explorer in Brazil and now lives in a house that he inherited from his godfather in Hockley-cum-Meston. He is devoted to rugby football and was educated at Haileybury, where he had the nickname &quot;Barmy&quot;. He breeds cocker spaniels and eats nonfattening protein bread. He was once scarred in the leg by the mother of an Honourable Mention in a Bonny Babies contest he judged in Peru, and is now strongly averse to marriage and babies. In South Africa, he hitched-hiked from Johannesburg to Cape Town to avoid being married.

In the first Jeeves novel in which he appears, he sells a black amber statuette he obtained in the Congo to Sir Watkyn Bassett, and wants to call the police on Bertie Wooster trying to sell it back to him. Jeeves (as Inspector Witherspoon) diverts the call to the police by naming Bertie as Alpine Joe and takes Bertie away. Major Plank also seeks a prop forward for the local rugby team. He finds this in Bertie&#x27;s old friend, the Reverend Harold &#x27;Stinker&#x27; Pinker, to whom he gives a vicarage. In the latter novel, he is a visitor haunting Bertie Wooster, the Major trying to remember where they had met before. He suffers from a poor memory as an after-effect of having contracted malaria during his time in Brazil.

==Quotes==
All Marriages are disastrous... They lead to bonny babies, and bonny babies lead to bonny baby competitions.

If she&#x27;d [Madeline Bassett] have seen as many native chiefs&#x27; wives as I have, she wouldn&#x27;t want to make such an ass of herself. Dickens of a life they lead, those women. Nothing to do but grind maize meal and have bonny babies.

I&#x27;m strongly opposed to anyone marrying anybody, but if you are going to marry someone, you unquestionably save something from the wreck by marrying a woman who knows what to do with a joint of beef.

==Stories==
Major Brabazon-Plank (or Major Plank) is featured in:
* &quot;Uncle Dynamite&quot; (1948) - an Uncle Fred novel (as Major Brabazon-Plank)
* &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot; (1963) - a Jeeves novel (as Major Plank)
* &quot;Aunts Aren&#x27;t Gentlemen&quot; (1974, U.S. title: &quot;The Cat-nappers&quot;) - a Jeeves novel (as Major Plank)

==Adaptations==
Donald Hewlett voiced Major Brabazon-Plank in the 1994 BBC radio adaptation of &quot;Uncle Dynamite&quot;.

Major Plank was portrayed by Norman Rodway in the &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; episode &quot;Trouble at Totleigh Towers&quot;. Ronald Fraser portrayed Major Plank in the 1980–1981 radio dramatisation of &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;, part of the BBC radio series &quot;What Ho! Jeeves&quot;.

<text>A barracuda is a large, predatory, ray-finned, saltwater fish of the genus Sphyraena, the only genus in the family Sphyraenidae, which was named by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. It is found in tropical and subtropical oceans worldwide ranging from the eastern border of the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea, on its western border the Caribbean Sea, and in tropical areas of the Pacific Ocean. Barracudas reside near the top of the water and near coral reefs and sea grasses. Barracudas are often targeted by sport-fishing enthusiasts.

== Etymology ==
The common name &quot;barracuda&quot; is derived from Spanish, with the original word being of possibly Cariban origin.

== Description ==
Barracuda are snake-like in appearance, with prominent, sharp-edged, fang-like teeth, much like piranha, all of different sizes, set in sockets of their large jaws. They have large, pointed heads with an underbite in many species. Their gill covers have no spines and are covered with small scales. Their two dorsal fins are widely separated, with the anterior fin having five spines, and the posterior fin having one spine and nine soft rays. The posterior dorsal fin is similar in size to the anal fin and is situated above it. The lateral line is prominent and extends straight from head to tail. The spinous dorsal fin is placed above the pelvic fins and is normally retracted in a groove. The caudal fin is moderately forked with its posterior edge double-curved and is set at the end of a stout peduncle. The pectoral fins are placed low on the sides. The swim bladder is large, allowing for minimal energy expenditure while cruising or remaining idle.

In most cases, barracuda are dark gray, dark green, white, or blue on the upper body, with silvery sides and a chalky-white belly. Coloration varies somewhat between species. For some species, irregular black spots or a row of darker cross-bars occur on each side. Their fins may be yellowish or dusky. Barracudas live primarily in oceans, but certain species, such as the great barracuda, live in brackish water. Due to similarities, sometimes Barracuda is compared with freshwater pike, though the major difference between the two is that Barracuda has two separate dorsal fins with a forked tail, unlike the freshwater pike.

Some species grow quite large (up to 65 inches or 165 cm in length), such as &quot;Sphyraena sphyraena&quot;, found in the Mediterranean Sea and eastern Atlantic; &quot;Sphyraena picudilla&quot;, ranging on the Atlantic coast of tropical America from North Carolina to Brazil and reaching Bermuda. Other barracuda species are found around the world. Examples are &quot;Sphyraena argentea&quot;, found from Puget Sound southwards to Cabo San Lucas, &quot;Sphyraena jello&quot;, from the seas of India and the Malay Peninsula and Archipelago.

==Behaviour and diet==

Barracudas are ferocious, opportunistic predators, relying on surprise and short bursts of speed, up to , to overtake their prey.

Adults of most species are more or less solitary, while young and half-grown fish frequently congregate. 

Barracudas prey primarily on fish (which may include some as large as themselves). Common prey fish include jacks, grunts, groupers, snappers, small tunas, mullets, killifishes, herrings, and anchovies; often by simply biting them in half. They kill and consume larger prey by tearing chunks out of their prey. They also seem to consume smaller species of sustenance that are in front of them. Barracuda species are often seen competing against mackerel, needle fish and sometimes even dolphins for prey.

Barracudas are usually found swimming in saltwater searching for schools of plankton-feeding fish. Their silver and elongated bodies make them difficult for prey to detect, especially when viewed head-on. Barracudas depend heavily on their eyesight when they are out hunting. When hunting, they tend to notice everything that has an unusual color, reflection, or movement. Once a barracuda targets an intended prey item, its long tail and matching anal and dorsal fins enable it to move with swift bursts of speed to attack its prey before it can escape. Barracudas generally attack schools of fish, speeding at them head first and biting at them with their jaws. When barracudas age, they tend to swim alone. However, there are times when they tend to stay with the pack. Barracudas will sometimes swim in groups. In this case, they can relocate schools of fish into compact areas or lead them into shallow water to more easily feed on them.

=== Interactions with humans ===
Some species of barracuda are reputed to be dangerous to swimmers. Barracudas are scavengers, and may mistake snorkelers for large predators, following them hoping to eat the remains of their prey. Swimmers have reported being bitten by barracudas, but such incidents are rare and possibly caused by poor visibility. Large barracudas can be encountered in muddy shallows on rare occasion. Barracudas may mistake things that glint and shine, like jewelry, for prey. One incident reported a barracuda jumping out of water and injuring a kayaker, but Jason Schratwieser, conservation director of the International Game Fish Association, said that the wound could have been caused by a houndfish.
Fatalities are nevertheless rare. Deaths have been reported in 1947 in Florida, 1957 in North Carolina and 1960 in Florida, again.

== As food ==

Barracudas are popular both as food and game fish. They are most often eaten as fillets or steaks. Larger species, such as the great barracuda, have been implicated in cases of ciguatera food poisoning. Those who have been diagnosed with this type of food poisoning display symptoms of gastrointestinal discomfort, limb weakness, and an inability to differentiate hot from cold effectively.

West Africans smoke them for use in soups and sauces. Smoking protects the soft flesh from disintegrating in the broth and gives it a smoky flavour.

<doc id="442892" wikidata="Q6942071" url="?curid=442892" title="Music of El Salvador">
<text>The music of [[El Salvador]] refers to the Music of the Republic of El Salvador and is encompassed in the wider Latin American musical traditions.

During the colonial period, El Salvador&#x27;s music began to be influenced by various ethnic groups involved in the colonization process.

*Music instruments that are present in El Salvador are Native American Pan-Indianism instruments such as Native American flute and drums. El Salvador has an American indigenous population which includes the Lenca, Pipil and Mayan people.

*European colonizers brought instruments, like the guitar, pedal steel guitar, fanfare trumpet and piano. 

*When African slaves were brought to El Salvador, they introduced instruments like the xylophone, güira and mbira.

*A sizeable Arab migration that arrived into El Salvador in late 19th and early 20th century, from mainly Lebanese people and Palestinian Salvadorans brought Arab instruments like oud, ney, goblet drum and qanun (instrument). 

*Roman Catholic religious contemporary Catholic liturgical music instrument such as tubular bells, pipe organ, and glass harmonica are also present.
Modern Salvadoran indigenous music is inspired by ambient music, soundscape, ambient synthesizer, and space music, while Salvadoran Roman Catholic music is influenced by monastery chorus Latin choir Gregorian chant music. This music includes religious songs (mostly Roman Catholic) used to celebrate Christmas and other holidays, especially feast days of the saints with tubular bell chimes. Satirical and rural lyrical themes are common and played with xylophone.
Popular styles in modern El Salvador include Salvadoran cumbia, rock and native Mesoamerican Indigenous music which historically have had a long and large significance and impact to modern El Salvador music styles.

==Folk music==

Musical repertoire consists of xuc, danza, pasillo, marcha and canciones. The Xylophone is a representative folk music instrument. Some of the most well known songs are &quot;El Carbonero&quot; and &quot;El Torito Pinto&quot;.

Marimba is one of the traditional folk music styles performed in El Salvador and was first introduced by African slaves. Two versions, of the percussion instrument that has intonations like a piano, the &quot;marimba de arco&quot;, which was played with a bow, and the &quot;marimba criolla&quot; were introduced. A coup d’état in 1932 resulted in the massacre of around 30,000 people and destruction of both the indigenous population and the original &quot;marimba de arco&quot;. The modern version of the instrument is a three octave &quot;marimba de arco&quot; and the music is always instrumental. The heyday of marimba in El Salvador was from the 1920s to 1930s when musicians played internationally, but because the instrument could be adapted to other styles, it remained popular until rock came on the scene in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 1990, a revival of the indigenous music began.
&quot;Marimba Centroamericana&quot; was one of the marimba bands popular in El Salvador and abroad. The first radio station in El Salvador, which was government-owned, played waltz, foxtrot, rancheras, sones, and songos, along with tangos. El Salvadoran musicians created their own versions of these styles. Another early marimba band was &quot;Marimba Atlacatl&quot;, founded by Francisco Antonio Beltran in 1917. He toured the world in the 1930s, and in 1935, won an award, presented by the Prince of Wales and his fiancée Wallis Simpson, at the Palm Beach Casino on the Azul Coast of France.

==Music of Northern El Salvador==
Northern El Salvador is composed of the departments of Chalatenango, Cabañas, Morazán and the northern parts of Santa Ana (e.g., Metapán), San Miguel (e.g., Cd. Barrios) and La Unión (e.g., Nueva Esparta) as well as the town of Suchitoto in the department of Cuscatlán. Northern El Salvador or la Franja Norte is characterized by its mountainous and cool terrain as well as being an area of heavy European settlement and as a result a large majority of the people who inhabit the Northern Region (especially Chalatenango, Metapán, and Morazán) are light-skinned people with colored eyes. The impact they have had on the local culture has been great and the music of Northern El Salvador clearly reflects the European influence in the area.

Chanchona Music

Music from the northern department of Morazán is lively and upbeat with simple lyrics that describe country life, love, and working in the fields. It usually consists of a double bass (&quot;chanchona&quot; in Salvadoran Spanish, a local word for a female hog, due to its sow-like appearance), two guitars, and two violins. Nowadays, congas and cowbells are added to the mix to produce sounds similar to cumbias. Chanchona music is popular in Eastern El Salvador and it is present there in most of their civic parades and religious holidays. Popular chanchona acts include: la Chanchona de Tito Mira, la Chanchona de Arcadio, Rayos de Oriente, Sonora Santa Marta, and Los Torogoces de Morazán.

Zafacaite

In the northern department of Chalatenango a popular form of music and fandango-type-of-dance was called &quot;zafacaite&quot;. The term is a compound word composed of the word &quot;zafa&quot;, from &quot;zafar&quot;(to loosen) and &quot;caite&quot;— a Salvadoran term for shoes. It was called so because of the fast and intricate foot stepping down when dancing the music that tended to make ones shoes fly off. The music consisted of a duo or trio playing a guitar, accordion, and violin or sometimes just an accordion and violin but always to a fast-paced rhythm. Popular songs and dances included &quot;La Raspa&quot; (&quot;The Scrape&quot;) and &quot;El Levanta Polvo&quot; (&quot;The Dust Lifter&quot;).

==Native American indigenous music==
Inspired by Ambient music, Indigenous music is influenced by the Native American indigenous Lenca, Cacaopera, and Pipil of El Salvador, and especially the Mayan people of the Mesoamerican region in Central America, are a staple in Salvadoran music. Many indigenous music groups such as (Talticpac), have risen in El Salvador, especially after the civil war. Many groups get inspiration from native indigenous music or themes from South and North American.

==Salvadoran marching bands==

School and military marching bands are a staple in El Salvador and it is a vital and crucial part of Salvadoran youth culture, whether in town or cities. Salvadoran marching bands are present in any kind of Salvadoran events, celebrations, and even in small activities, they become present along with their (cachiporristas) cheerleaders. Marching bands are a representative of Salvadoran culture and tradition, music tunes will include anything from national anthem, folkloric music to dance music like cumbia.

Marching bands in El Salvador were once called &quot;war bands&quot;. After the peace accords that ended the civil war were signed, the named was changed to &quot;peace bands&quot;. The Salvadoran marching bands have even made international appearances in events such as the Rose Parade in the U.S city of Pasadena in New Years, the first time in 2008 and the most recent in 2013, where the Salvadoran marching bands of boys and girls have been able to embrace their talents to the world.

== Salvadoran Civil War songs ==
Salvadoran Civil War songs located in the nueva cancion movement and genre, have been very popular since the 1970- to present day. They were broadcast through Radio Venceremos station and appealed to the majority of the peasant Salvadoran population. One of the most well known songs is &quot;El Salvador ta venciendo&quot; by Yolocamba Ita, as well as American songs like &quot;U.S get out of El Salvador&quot; dedicated to the U.S. involvement.

== Salvadoran cumbia ==
Salvadoran cumbia is a staple in Salvadoran music. Groups such as Orquesta San Vicente who sing (Soy Salvadoreño), the Bravo group who sing (Sabrosa Cumbia) and the Hermanos Flores group who sing (Mi Pais) are three well known cumbia music groups in El Salvador.

== Salvadoran rock and hip hop/rap ==
Rock and hip hop are very well established music genres in Salvadoran culture. Salvadoran rock has a longer history dating back before the civil war while Salvadoran hip hop arrived after the civil war and it is seen as a legacy of the Salvadoran exodus, diaspora, immigration and deportation from the United States, especially from cities such as Los Angeles and Washington D.C. Joaquin Santos, Crooked Stilo and Code Blue are just some of the most well known Salvadoran hip hop groups.

Foreign rock bands from the U.S and other parts of the world are also very welcomed and listened in El Salvador. Many foreign rock groups dedicated songs to El Salvador and the Salvadoran people during the civil war, songs such as &quot;Bullet the Blue Sky&quot; by U2, &quot;El Salvador&quot; by White Lion, and &quot;Weapons for El Salvador&quot; by The Ex were all inspired by the U.S. involvement in the El Salvador War.

==Popular music and instruments==
Popular music in El Salvador uses xylophones, tubular bells, fanfare trumpets, guitars, double bass, harmonica, glass harmonica, pianos, flutes, drums, scrapers, gourds, and theremin. Indigenous instruments such as drum and flutes are a standard in all Salvadoran music used as a solidarity with El Salvador indigenous ancestry. &quot;El Sombrero Azul,&quot; for example, is a cumbia song by Salsa Clave which starts with an indigenous tune. Tubular bells are a cue for El Salvador&#x27;s Christianity and majestic fanfare trumpets for El Salvador&#x27;s national pride, the national anthem itself start off with majestic fanfare trumpets.

Music from Colombia mainly and other Caribbean, South American and Central American music has infiltrated the country, especially salsa and cumbia. For example, the famous La Sonora Dinamita is a Colombian cumbia group with one Salvadoran vocalist (Susana Velasques). As one of the first Cumbia groups to reach international success, it is credited with helping to popularize the genre throughout Latin America, and the world.

Political chaos tore the country apart in the early 20th century, and music was often suppressed, especially those with strong native influences. In the 1940s, for example, it was decreed that a dance called &quot;Xuc&quot; was to be the &quot;national dance&quot; which was created and led by Paquito Palaviccini&#x27;s and his &quot;Orquesta Internacional Polio.&quot; That was one of the many orchestras he led during and in the mid-1940s, his other hit was known throughout the country. &quot;Carnaval En San Miguel&quot; was commonly known to the whole country as the first Salvadoran band that went on to receive numerous awards in the years to come. Paquito Palaviccini, being known throughout Central and South America, made tours to Cuba, Buenos Aires, where Paquito Studied, and other Latin American countries.

The inspiration came to Paquito to develop the &quot;Xuc&quot; and &quot;El Baile del Torito&quot; in a tour they had in Cuba. The 1960s saw an influx of American and British pop and rock, inspiring like-minded Salvadoran bands, while the following two decades were dominated by a wave of popular genres from across Latin America, mostly folk-based singer-songwriter genres like Chile and Nueva Canción. This new type of Salvadoran rock music was called &quot;Guanarock&quot; (portmanteau of Guanaco, a nickname demonym slang Salvadorans use to refer to themselves which comes from the word Guanacasco which means &quot;gathering brotherhood&quot; in Poton Lenca Mesoamerican language, and rock), which inspired bands such as Ayutush.

Dominican merengue and bachata also became very popular. In the last ten years, hip hop and reggaeton has influenced the majority of the Salvadoran youth, which has formed groups like Pescozada and Mecate. Also former Reggaeton producers like Wilfredo Rivas (Dj Emsy) and Jose Castaneda (Mambo King) who had worked with vary of famous Reggaeton and Hip hop artists such as: Dj Flex, Cheka, The Black Eyed Peas, Nicky Jam, El Torito and many others.

Salvadoran cumbia is related to but very distinct from Colombian cumbia, which is better known outside of El Salvador. Chanchona ensembles, led by a pair or a single violin, are popular, especially among the immigrant community in the Washington D.C. area.

===Alternative music===

El Salvador has prominent heavy metal, reggae, ska, dubstep, punk and electronic dance scenes due to its prolific local bands and venues; and the recent increase in local concerts by international bands that include San Salvador as a frequent destination in their international tours. Anastasio y los del Monte was widely lauded for bringing reggae to El Salvador.

==Art music==
The main composer of the 19th century was José Escolástico Andrino (born in Guatemala). Wenceslao García was the first native composer. Important military bands composers and arrangers include Jesús Alas, Alejandro Muñoz and Domingo Santos. María de Baratta was an important ethnomusicologist and composer in the 20th century.

<text>The Padma Shri (IAST: &quot;padma śrī&quot;), also spelled Padma Shree, is the fourth-highest civilian award of the Republic of India, after the Bharat Ratna, the Padma Vibhushan and the Padma Bhushan. Instituted on 2 January 1954, the award is conferred in recognition of &quot;distinguished contribution in various spheres of activity including the arts, education, industry, literature, science, acting, medicine, social service and public affairs&quot;. It is awarded by the Government of India every year on India&#x27;s Republic Day. 

==History==

Padma Awards were instituted in 1954 to be awarded to citizens of India in recognition of their distinguished contribution in various spheres of activity including the arts, education, industry, literature, science, acting, medicine, social service and public affairs. It has also been awarded to some distinguished individuals who were not citizens of India but did contribute in various ways to India.

The selection criteria have been criticised in some quarters with the claim that many highly deserving artists have been left out in order to favour certain individuals. India has now created an online nomination platform for the common citizens to recommend the nomination for the annually given civilian &quot;Padma&quot; awards.

On its obverse, the words &quot;Padma&quot;, meaning lotus in Sanskrit, and &quot;Shri&quot;, a Sanskrit-derived honorific equivalent to &#x27;Mr.&#x27; or &#x27;Ms.&#x27; (i.e., &quot;Noble One in Blossom&quot;), appear in Devanagari above and below a lotus flower. The geometrical pattern on either side is in burnished bronze. All embossing is in white gold.

, 3448 people have received the award. In 2025, 113 people received the Padma Shri.

==Refusals==
Several intended recipients, including musician Hemanta Kumar Mukherjee, sitar player Vilayat Khan, academic and author Mamoni Raisom Goswami, journalist Kanak Sen Deka and noted Bollywood screenwriter Salim Khan, have declined the Padma Shri for various reasons. Some intended recipients, such as environmental activist Sunderlal Bahuguna and English billiards champion Michael Ferreira, have refused the honour but have subsequently accepted a more prestigious one such as the Padma Bhushan or Padma Vibhushan. Other individuals, such as film-maker Aribam Syam Sharma, author Phanishwar Nath &#x27;Renu&#x27;, Punjabi author Dalip Kaur Tiwana and noted poet Jayanta Mahapatra, have returned the honour after initially accepting it.

In 2022, Bengali singer &quot;Gitashri&quot; Sandhya Mukhopadhyay, aged 90, turned down her offer for the Padma Shri award on the eve of the 73rd Republic Day of India. As per media reports, the veteran singer turned down the offer since she believes that her career spanning eight decades deserved a higher award than the Padma Shri. &quot;Padma Shri is more deserving for a junior artiste&quot;, her daughter said. Based on her refusal, her name was not included in the Padma awardees list for 2022.

<text>David Gouverneur Burnet (April 14, 1788 – December 5, 1870) was an early politician within the Republic of Texas, serving as the interim president of Texas in 1836, the second vice president of the Republic of Texas (1839–1841), and the secretary of state (1846) for the new state of Texas after it was annexed to the United States.

Burnet was born in Newark, New Jersey, and attended law school in Cincinnati, Ohio. As a young man, he lived with a Comanche tribe for a year before he returned to Ohio. In 1806, Burnet volunteered to serve the unsuccessful filibustering expeditions led by General Francisco de Miranda for the independence of Venezuela from Spain. He fought in Chile in 1807 and in Venezuela in 1808. After Miranda broke with Simon Bolivar, Burnet returned to the United States in 1812.

In 1826, he moved to Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s colony in Mexican Texas. He received a land grant as an empresario but was forced to sell the land after he had failed to attract enough settlers to his colony, and he later lost his right to operate a sawmill after he refused to convert to Roman Catholicism.

On hearing of William B. Travis&#x27;s plea for help at the Alamo, Burnet traveled to Washington-on-the-Brazos to recruit help from the Convention of 1836. He remained at the convention and was elected interim president on March 17, 1836. On his orders, the government fled Washington-on-the-Brazos for Harrisburg, thus inspiring the Runaway Scrape. Burnet narrowly avoided capture by Mexican troops the following month.

After Sam Houston&#x27;s victory at the Battle of San Jacinto, Burnet took custody of Mexican General Antonio López de Santa Anna and negotiated the Treaties of Velasco. Many Texans were infuriated that the treaty allowed Santa Anna to escape execution, and some called for Burnet&#x27;s arrest for treason. Burnet declined to run for president and resigned as interim president on October 22, 1836.

He served as vice president under Mirabeau B. Lamar and participated in the Battle of Neches. He was defeated by Houston in the next presidential election. Burnet served as the state&#x27;s first Secretary of State when the United States annexed Texas.

The first Reconstruction state legislature appointed him to the United States Senate. Still, he could not take his seat because of the Ironclad oath.

==Early life and career==

Burnet was born to Dr. William Burnet and his second wife, Gertrude Gouverneur Rutgers, widow of Anthony Rutgers (a brother of Henry Rutgers who founded Rutgers University). His father had served in the Continental Congress. David Burnet was orphaned as a child.

In 1805, Burnet became a clerk for a New York counting house, Robinson and Hartshorne. When the firm suffered financial difficulty, Burnet gave his entire personal inheritance, $1,300 (), to try to save the company. The firm went bankrupt, and Burnet lost all of the money.

In 1806, Burnet volunteered to serve the unsuccessful filibustering expeditions led by general Francisco de Miranda for the independence of Venezuela from Spain rule. He fought in Chile in 1807 and in Venezuela in 1808. After Miranda broke with Simon Bolivar, Burnet returned to the United States in 1812. 

Upon his return Burnet moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, to study law. He lived with his two older brothers, Jacob, who later became a US Senator, and Isaac, who later served as mayor of Cincinnati.

==Early Texas years==
In 1817, Burnet moved to Natchitoches, Louisiana and set up a mercantile business. After several months, he developed a bloody cough. A doctor diagnosed him with tuberculosis and suggested he move to Texas, then a part of Mexico to recuperate in the dry air. Later that year, Burnet traveled alone into Texas. A Comanche tribe came to his aid when he fell off of his horse by the Colorado River, and he lived with them for two years until he made a full recovery. Near the end of the year, he met Ben Milam, who had come to the village to trade with the tribe.

His cough improved, and Burnet returned to Cincinnati. He asked that the Mexican prisoners be released with him and allowed to return home. The Comanches agreed to this proposal, and the Mexican families were surprised that there was no ransom or other agreement to the release of these prisoners.

In Cincinnati, Burnet wrote a series of articles for the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; detailing his time with the Native Americans. He practiced law for several years but returned to Texas after hearing of Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s thriving colony for Anglos. Burnet settled in San Felipe, the headquarters of Austin&#x27;s colony, in 1826. For the next 18 months, he provided law advice to the 200 settlers in the town and organized the first Presbyterian Sunday School in Texas. A profoundly religious man, Burnet neither drank nor swore and always carried a Bible in his pocket.

==Texas empresario==
After a failed venture with Milam, the Western Colonization and Mining Company, in 1827, Burnet traveled with Lorenzo de Zavala and Joseph Vehlein to the Coahuila y Tejas state capitol, Saltillo. The men applied for grants as empresarios under the General Colonization Law of 1824. Burnet received authorization to settle 300 families in East Texas, northwest of Nacogdoches, an area that had already been settled by the Cherokee. Under the terms of his grant, a married settler could purchase a league of land ) for $200.

Burnet returned to Ohio to recruit settlers but could not entice the required number of families. In 1828, he sold his land grant to the Galveston Bay and Texas Land Company for $12,000. Burnet remained in the United States for several years, and on December 8, 1830, married Hannah Estey of Morristown, New Jersey. At their wedding, he was 43, and she was 30 years old.

Eager to return to Texas, Burnet and his new wife chartered the ship &quot;Call&quot; and brought a steam engine to operate a sawmill. A storm grounded the ship along Bolivar Point, and, to lighten the load, they were forced to discard all of Hannah&#x27;s furniture and her hope chest. The steam engine was the only piece of cargo that could be saved.

Burnet established his sawmill on of land along the San Jacinto River, in an area that came to be known as Burnet&#x27;s Bay. Under Mexican law, Burnet was entitled to an extra land grant because his sawmill provided a needed public service. However, the law required settlers to convert to Roman Catholicism to receive the extra land grant. The devout Burnet refused, angering the Mexican authorities to the point that they canceled his grant for operating the sawmill. The mill was finally sold to Dr. Branch T. Archer at a large loss.

==Early public service==
Burnet was a delegate to the Convention of 1833, where he was elected the chair of a committee that created a petition arguing that the Mexican Congress approve separate statehood for Texas. Stephen F. Austin carried the petition to Mexico City and was promptly jailed.

Shortly after the Convention of 1833 disbanded, Antonio López de Santa Anna became Mexico&#x27;s new president. Over the next two years, Santa Anna began consolidating his political control over the country by dissolving the Mexican Congress and disbanding state legislatures. In October 1835, Santa Anna declared himself military dictator and marched north to &quot;reassert control over Texas&quot;.

During this time, Burnet had been appointed the first judge of the Austin district and organized a court at San Felipe. From then on, he was known as Judge Burnet. He and other Texians determined that Texas should be an independent state within Mexico. In November 1835, the Consultation of 1835 was held at San Felipe. At the consultation, Burnet formed a provisional state government based on the 1824 Constitution of Mexico, which Santa Anna had already repudiated.

==Republic of Texas==
===Birth===
On March 1, 1836, a constitutional convention, the Convention of 1836, was held at Washington-on-the-Brazos. Burnet was not chosen as a delegate to the convention. On hearing of William B. Travis&#x27;s plea for help at the Alamo, Burnet immediately set out to offer his assistance. He stopped at the convention to try to recruit others to join the fight but soon became so &quot;inspired by their deliberations&quot; that he remained as a visitor. Speaking privately with many of the delegates, Burnet professed that he would be willing to serve as president of a new republic, even if that made him a target of Santa Anna.

After hearing of the fall of the Alamo, the chairman of the convention, Richard Ellis, wanted to adjourn the convention and begin again in Nacogdoches. Burnet leaped onto a bench and made a speech asking the delegates to stay and finish their business. They did so, and the new constitution was adopted that evening. The frontrunners for the presidency of the new country, Austin, Sam Houston, and William H. Wharton, were absent from the convention. So the nominees became Burnet and Samuel Price Carson. Burnet won, on a vote of 29–23, in the early hours of March 17, becoming the interim president of the new Republic of Texas. De Zavala was elected vice president.

===Interim presidency===
====Wartime====
One of Burnet&#x27;s first acts as president was to transfer the capital of the new state from Washington-on-the-Brazos to Harrisburg, which was located nearer to the small Texas Navy at Galveston Island. Harrisburg was also closer to the US border and would allow easier communication with US officials. The move became urgent when the convention received word that Santa Anna was within of Washington-on-the-Brazos. Burnet quickly adjourned the proceedings, and the government fled, inspiring a massive fight known as the Runaway Scrape. Burnet personally carried the Texas Declaration of Independence in his saddlebags.

Sam Houston, leading the Texan Army, also decided to strategically retreat from Gonzales after learning of the defeat at the Alamo. On hearing of the government&#x27;s flight, &quot;Houston was pained and annoyed&quot; and maintained it was a cowardly action that had caused a great deal of unnecessary panic. Burnet was infuriated by Houston&#x27;s criticism and accused Houston of staging a retreat because he was afraid to fight. Within several days, Burnet had stationed a spy, Major James H. Perry, on Houston&#x27;s staff. To discredit Houston, Perry initiated a groundless rumor that Houston had begun taking opium.

On March 25, Burnet declared martial law and divided Texas into three military districts. All able-bodied men between 18 and 55 were ordered to report for military duty. Four days later, Burnet issued a proclamation declaring that a man would lose his Texas citizenship and any future claim to land if he left Texas, refused to fight, or helped the Mexican Army.

In the hopes of gaining assistance from the US, Burnet sent Carson, now his secretary of state, to Louisiana to approach General Edmund P. Gaines, who had been given orders by US President Andrew Jackson not to cross the Sabine River into Texas. A small amount of relief came on April 9; however, with the arrival of the &quot;Twin Sisters,&quot; two 6 lb. cannons that had been sent as a gift from the people of Cincinnati to show their respect for the Burnet family since Burnet&#x27;s brother Isaac was the mayor of Cincinnati. Burnet immediately sent the guns to Houston.

Out of safety concerns, the government was moved again on April 13 to Galveston. Santa Anna&#x27;s army reached Harrisburg two days later to find a deserted town. On April 17, Burnet received word that the Mexican Army was headed for his location. He and his family crowded into a rowboat immediately, leaving their personal effects behind. When they reached offshore, Colonel Juan Almonte and a troop of Mexican cavalry rode into view. Burnet stood up in the rowboat so the army would focus on him instead of his family. Almonte ordered the troops not to fire, as he had seen Hannah Burnet in the boat and did not want to put her in danger.

====Peacetime====
Burnet did not hear of Houston&#x27;s victory at San Jacinto and subsequent capture of Santa Anna until several days after. He hurried to the battlefield, where he often complained about Houston&#x27;s use of profanity. Houston&#x27;s staff &quot;complained that the president grumbled ungraciously, was hard to please, and spent all of his time giving orders and collecting souvenirs.&quot; The two men also argued over the distribution of $18,000 in specie that had been found in Santa Anna&#x27;s treasure chest. Burnet insisted that the money should go to the Texas treasury, but Houston had already given $3,000 to the Texas Navy and distributed the rest among his men.

In his distrust of civil government, Santa Anna requested that he be allowed to negotiate a treaty with Houston. His request was rejected, and Burnet took him into custody, first to Galveston Island and then to Velasco. On May 14, 1836, both men signed the Treaties of Velasco. In a public treaty, Santa Anna agreed to immediately cease all hostilities and withdraw his troops south of the Rio Grande. Burnet pledged that Santa Anna would have safe passage home. Secretly, the men agreed that Santa Anna would &quot;use his influence with the Mexican government to secure the recognition of Texas Independence with its southern boundary as the Rio Grande.&quot; Mexico later repudiated the treaty.

The people of Texas were incensed at the terms of the treaty. The public, the Secretary of War, and the Secretary of the Navy wanted to see Santa Anna executed for his actions. Despite the criticism, Burnet arranged for Santa Anna to travel by boat to Mexico. His ship was delayed for several days by wind, and while it was docked, 250 volunteers, commanded by Thomas Green, arrived. Green demanded that Burnet resign immediately. The ship&#x27;s captain, afraid for his safety, refused to set sail unless Green approved. With few other options, Burnet ordered Santa Anna brought ashore and imprisoned at Quintana. Many of the Texas army officers threatened to execute Santa Anna and to try Burnet for treason.

Most of Burnet&#x27;s time was spent writing proclamations, orders, and letters appealing for funds and volunteers. The Texas treasury was empty as a taxation system had yet to be implemented. There was no money to pay Burnet a salary, and his family soon had trouble paying for their expenses. To make ends meet, they sold a Negro woman and boy. Filling the treasury would take more effort, and Burnet proposed to sell land scrip in New York State. The bids dropped as low as 1¢ per acre, so the plan was shelved.

With no money and little respect for Burnet, it was unsurprising that &quot;no one followed orders, and the government struggled to direct the state effectively.&quot; Burnet wished to replace Thomas Jefferson Rusk as commander of the army and sent Secretary of War Mirabeau B. Lamar to take Rusk&#x27;s place. Instead, Rusk proposed that General Felix Huston be named his replacement. Lamar called a vote of the men in the army, who overwhelmingly voted for Huston, essentially a vote of no confidence in Burnet&#x27;s decisions.

====Resignation====
The first Texas presidential election was held on September 5, 1836. Burnet declined to run, and Houston was elected to become the first president. Houston was expected to take office in December. On October 3, Burnet called the first session of the Texas Congress to order in Columbia. Houston arrived at the session on October 9, and the Congress quickly began lobbying Burnet to resign so that Houston could begin his duties. Burnet finally agreed to resign on October 22, the day after de Zavala resigned as vice president.

During the transition of power, Burnet&#x27;s son Jacob died at Velasco. The Burnets returned to their home, which had been looted, which left them with no furniture or other household articles. To support his family, Burnet practiced law and farmed.

===Vice president===

Houston&#x27;s term as president expired in 1838. Burnet declined offers to run as his replacement but agreed to run as the vice president for his friend, Mirabeau B. Lamar. Once the election returns were in, Burnet and Houston engaged in a shouting match, with Burnet calling Houston a &quot;half-Indian&quot; and Houston calling Burnet a &quot;hog thief.&quot; Burnet challenged Houston to a duel, but Houston refused: &quot;The people are equally disgusted with both of us.&quot; Lamar and Burnet were inaugurated on December 10, 1838.

Burnet was an active vice president. In 1839, he briefly served as acting Secretary of State after Barnard Bee had been sent to Mexico. Burnet was part of a five-person commission to negotiate with Chief Bowl for the &quot;peaceful&quot; expulsion of the Cherokee tribe from their territory northwest of Nacogdoches. After a week of negotiations, the group did not agree.

On July 15, three regiments of Texas troops attacked the Cherokee at the Battle of Neches. Chief Bowl and a hundred other Indians were killed; the survivors retreated into Arkansas Territory. Burnet fought in the battle as a volunteer and suffered minor wounds.

In December 1840, Burnet became acting president when Lamar took a leave of absence to seek medical treatment in New Orleans for an intestinal disorder. His first official act, on December 16, was to deliver an address to Congress alleging that Mexican armies were preparing to invade Texas. Burnet wanted Congress to declare war on Mexico and to attempt to push the Texas southern boundary to the Sierra Madres. His proposal was defeated by supporters of Houston, who was then serving in the legislature.

===Presidential candidate===
Burnet dismissed several of Lamar&#x27;s appointees during his time as acting president, angering the president. After Lamar&#x27;s term, Burnet agreed to run for president. Lamar and his cronies only reluctantly supported Burnet after they could not entice Rusk to run. Burnet&#x27;s primary competition was Houston, and insults and name-calling dominated the campaign. Houston questioned Burnet&#x27;s honesty by accusing him of taking a $250,000 bribe from Santa Anna and calling him a &quot;political brawler&quot; and a &quot;canting hypocrite.&quot; Houston also accused Burnet of being a drunk. Burnet again challenged Houston to a duel, but again, Houston refused. Houston won the election with 7,915 votes to Burnet&#x27;s 3,619.

==Later life==
After losing the presidential election, Burnet returned to his farm. When Texas was annexed into the United States, Burnet served as the state&#x27;s first Secretary of State under Governor James Pinckney Henderson. His feud with Houston continued, and in 1852, Burnet wrote the pamphlet &quot;Review of the Life of General Sam Houston,&quot; which recounted many rumors and allegations of Houston&#x27;s improper behavior. Houston retaliated in February 1859 by giving a speech on the floor of the US Senate that disparaged Burnet.

Burnet&#x27;s health deteriorated, and he needed help with his farm work. He and his wife purchased an enslaved Black man and his wife for $1400. The man escaped, robbing the Burnets in the process. Unable to make ends meet on their own, Burnet and his wife rented their to another family in 1857 while they continued to live in their house.

Hannah Burnet died on October 30, 1858. Their only surviving child, William Estey Burnet, took a leave of absence from his military service and helped Burnet move to Galveston, where he lived with an old friend, Sidney Sherman. Burnet opposed secession and was saddened when his son joined the Confederate Army but later supported his son&#x27;s efforts. Colonel William Burnet was killed on March 31, 1865, at Spanish Fort, Alabama, leaving Burnet as the only surviving member of his family.

In 1865, Sherman&#x27;s wife died, and Burnet left Sherman&#x27;s home to live with Preston Perry. The following year, the first Reconstruction state legislature appointed Burnet and Oran Roberts to be US senators from Texas. Neither man could take the Ironclad oath, so they were not permitted to take their Senate seats.

Burnet&#x27;s last public service came in 1868 when he was appointed as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention, which nominated Horatio Seymour for president. In his later years, Burnet experienced senility. Before his death, he had carried a trunk of his private papers into an empty lot and burned them all.

He died on December 5, 1870, aged 82, in Galveston. He was first buried in Magnolia Cemetery, but in 1894, his remains were moved to Galveston&#x27;s Lakeview Cemetery, where he was buried next to Sidney Sherman&#x27;s grave.

Burnet County was named in his honor when it was formed in 1852, as was its county seat. In 1936, the state erected a statue of Burnet in Clarksville. David G. Burnet Elementary School in Dallas and David G. Burnet Elementary School in Odessa are named in his honor.

<text>Frederick Altamont Cornwallis Twistleton, 5th Earl of Ickenham, commonly known as Uncle Fred, is a fictional character who appears in comedic short stories and novels written by P. G. Wodehouse between 1935 and 1961. An energetic and mischievous old chap, his talent for trouble is the bane of his nephew Pongo Twistleton&#x27;s life.

== Appearances ==
The Uncle Fred stories comprise the following (one short story followed by four novels, two of which are set at Blandings Castle):
* &quot;Uncle Fred Flits By&quot; (1935) – included in the collection &quot;Young Men in Spats&quot;, (1936)
* &quot;Uncle Fred in the Springtime&quot; (1939) – a Blandings story
* &quot;Uncle Dynamite&quot; (1948)
* &quot;Cocktail Time&quot; (1958)
* &quot;Service with a Smile&quot; (1961) – a Blandings story

== Background and character ==
Uncle Fred is a tall, slim, distinguished-looking man, with a jaunty moustache, and an &quot;alert and enterprising eye&quot;. As a child he gambolled at Mitching Hill, his Uncle Willoughby&#x27;s estate just outside London, which later became the suburb of Valley Fields; it was there that he shot the gardener in the trousers seat with his bow and arrow, and threw up after his first cigar. He was a younger son, and therefore not expected to inherit his present title; he spent much time in America, working variously as a cowboy, a soda jerk, a newspaper reporter and a prospector in the Mojave Desert, before a number of deaths in the family left him heir to the Earldom. While in America, he was friends with James Schoonmaker, and his daughter Myra.

In later youth, he became a member of the riotous Pelican Club, and a good friend of Galahad Threepwood, in whose stead he is occasionally called to Blandings, to help Gally&#x27;s brother Lord Emsworth out of a jam. He was also close to Claude &quot;Mustard&quot; Pott, the prominent bookie, and was favourite uncle to Pott&#x27;s daughter Polly, who sported on the lawns of Ickenham Hall as a child.

His home is in Hampshire, where he lives quietly with his sponge Joyeuse and his American wife Jane, who at first permits him the occasional day or two in town, but later takes control of the family finances, leaving him only enough for &quot;golf balls, self-respect and tobacco&quot;, and insists he stay in the country. This injunction comes as a relief to his nephew Pongo, who considers him a troublemaker and dreads his trips to London.

== Adventures ==
In an oft-referenced but never detailed anecdote, Uncle Fred once dragged his nephew Pongo to the Dog Races and was arrested within ten minutes of arriving (&quot;I still say a wiser Magistrate would have been content with a mere caution.&quot;)

In &quot;Uncle Fred Flits By&quot;, he involves Pongo in a complex situation involving someone else&#x27;s house and a parrot.

His main talent is impersonation: by the end of this first outing, we hear of his having impersonated George Robinson, of 14 Nasturtium Road, East Dulwich (on the occasion of the trip to the Dog Races); a veterinarian come to clip the claws of a parrot at The Cedars, Mafeking Road, Mitching Hill; Mr Roddis, the resident of the same address; and Mr. J. B. Bulstrode, a neighbour of the same. He claims that, if given time, he would have impersonated the parrot as well, on broad impressionistic terms.

In &quot;Uncle Fred in the Springtime&quot;, when we next meet him, he cons slow-minded Lord Bosham out of his wallet just for the sake of it, and heads merrily down to Blandings Castle in the guise of Sir Roderick Glossop, with Pongo taking the role of his nephew and secretary, Basil. While there, he wraps up the affairs of Polly and her man, and Pongo&#x27;s money worries, with a panache only Gally himself could rival; he even avoids his wife&#x27;s finding out he has left home while she was away (tending her sick mother in the South of France), despite the wrath of his niece Valerie.

He has also masqueraded as Major Brabazon-Plank in &quot;Uncle Dynamite&quot;, the famed explorer, and as his older brother, a mining engineer. (In the argot of the English public school, the miner is Brabazon-Plank Major and the major is Brabazon-Plank Minor.)

His other exploits include shooting an old classmate&#x27;s hat off with a Brazil nut with the precision of an Amazonian hunter (in &quot;Cocktail Time&quot;), and happily breaking up an engagement between his nephew Pongo and the quite unsuitable Hermione Bostock (in &quot;Uncle Dynamite&quot;). All of them have rendered said nephew in constant fear of his uncle, and permanently convinced him of his elder&#x27;s lunacy.

In his last outing (&quot;Service with a Smile&quot;) Fred visits Blandings to help Lord Emsworth with his woes: his bossy sister Lady Constance Keeble, his scary secretary Lavender Briggs, his obnoxious houseguest the Duke of Dunstable, and a group of Church Lads permitted to camp on the property. But Fred has his own motivation: Pongo&#x27;s friend, a curate, is in love with Connie&#x27;s wealthy charge, Myra Schoonmaker. Without meeting him, Connie decided a poor curate was not an acceptable suitor and brought Myra away to Blandings to break up the romance. Fred employs his favorite strategy, bringing the curate along under an assumed name, and manages to unite the young lovers. Through various maneuvers he eventually alleviates Lord Emsworth&#x27;s burdens.

<text>Music of Honduras is very varied. Punta is the main &quot;ritmo&quot; of Honduras with other music such as Paranda, Bachata, Caribbean salsa, cumbia, reggae, merengue, soca, calypso, dancehall, Reggaeton and most recently Afrobeats widely heard especially in the North the Department of Atlántida, to Mexican rancheras heard in the interior rural part of the country.

==Overview==
Honduras&#x27; capital Tegucigalpa is an important center for modern Honduran music, and is home to the College for Fine Arts.

Folk music is played with guitar, marimba and other instruments. Punta is popular in Honduras. Popular folk songs include &quot;La ceiba&quot; and &quot;Candú&quot;.

There is an Orquesta Sinfónica Nacional de Honduras (a national orchestra) in Comayagua.

== Punta ==
Punta is the main genre heard around Honduras. Punta originated through the Garifuna tribe. The Garifuna peoples origins trace back to the enslaved West Africans blending with the Indigenous populations of the Caribbeans. This blend of cultures can be demonstrated through their music. Punta is not only a genre of music but also a lively form of dance as well. Like many Latin genres, Punta form through slave trades and this tribe creating this music as a way to dance and celebrate. Today Punta has evolved into various different styles with the most popular being Punta Rock which came in around the late 1980s-1990&#x27;s.

Early Punta started as a ritual or used in celebrations and moved towards folk and poetic music to the Garifuna tribes. Garifuna tribes began to immigrate to Latin American countries around the late 1700s landing in Honduras by the end of the 18th century. Punta was often performed by females which equates to the movement of the dance. Punta dance is described as a sensual dance, moving the hips and shaking their bottoms. This dance moves the lower half while keeping their upper half almost stagnant. Though men can also dance Punta, oftentimes it is women who are dancing together in a circle while the men watch. This dance is also competitive and it may be seen that the dancers will try to outdo each other.

Punta is typically done in a 2/4 time signature, starting with two eighth-note and the following beat being a quarter note. This beat is kept by the drums and allows for different variations of beats in order to change the pace of dancing. When it comes to dancing, it is fast pace movements with every eighth-note being a step in the beat, in order to take a break or rest during dancing they will transition to having every beat being a step. Since this is a fast pace movement this allows dancers to take a break without stopping the rhythm of the music.

Punta has been seen in various different types of context. Punta can be danced at festivals, celebrations and even funerals. Punta uses traditional musical instruments deriving from the roots of Garifuna tribes. The drums are one of the most prevalent instruments that can be heard in any Punta song followed by strings and wind instruments. As time moves on more modern instruments have been added to add more depth to the music and fit modern taste however the standard instruments have stayed through all the musical trends.

Punta and has developed different subcategories of Punta. These subcategories include: Punta rock, Traditional Punta, Folkloric Punta, and Urban Punta. Punta rock added a modern twist becoming popular in 1990&#x27;s with one of the most known artist being Andy Palacios. Traditional Punta emphasizes the drums and its call and response element to lyrics used. Folkloric Punta focuses more on the tradition instruments used by the Garifuna people and has a story-telling element to its lyrics and dance. Lastly Urban Punta mixes hip-hop elements and digital elements while maintaining traditional beats to modernize the style.

<doc id="442907" wikidata="Q168254" url="?curid=442907" title="Rudolf I of Bohemia">
<text>Rudolf I ( – 3/4 July 1307), also known as Rudolf of Habsburg, was a member of the House of Habsburg, the King of Bohemia and titular King of Poland from 1306 until his death. He was also Duke of Austria (as Rudolf III) and Styria from 1298.

== Early life ==
Rudolf was the eldest son of Duke Albert I of Austria and his wife Elizabeth of Gorizia-Tyrol, thereby the grandson of King Rudolf I of Germany. After lengthy struggles with Adolf of Nassau, his father was elected King of Germany in 1298 and vested sixteen-year-old Rudolf as a co-ruler with the Austrian hereditary lands of the Habsburg dynasty. According to the Treaty of Rheinfelden, Rudolf acted as regent on behalf of his younger brothers Frederick the Fair and Leopold I.

On 25 May 1300 King Albert I arranged his marriage with Blanche, a daughter of King Philip III of France. The intended union failed as the couple&#x27;s son and daughter died young and Blanche herself died, probably after a miscarriage, in 1305. Rudolf accompanied his father on his 1304 expedition against King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, who had placed his son Wenceslaus III on the Hungarian throne after the Árpád dynasty died out in 1301 with the death of King Andrew III.

==King of Bohemia==

Another opportunity for a Habsburg gain in power opened when in 1306 King Wenceslaus III, the last Bohemian ruler of the Přemyslid dynasty, was killed and Albert I was able to seize his kingdom as an escheated fief. Rudolph was then vested with the Bohemian throne. This was contested by his maternal uncle Duke Henry of Carinthia, husband of Wenceslaus&#x27; sister Anne. When several Bohemian nobles elected Henry King of Bohemia, Albert I placed his brother-in-law under the Imperial ban and marched against Prague. Henry fled, first to Bavaria, then back to his Carinthian homelands. To further legitimate the Habsburg claims to the Bohemian and the Polish throne, Albert had Rudolph married to Elizabeth Richeza of Poland, widow of King Wenceslaus II.

Mocked as &quot;král kaše&quot; (&quot;king porridge&quot;) for his thriftiness rather than stomach problems, Rudolf was rejected by several Bohemian nobles, who continued to hold out for Henry. His aims to take hold of the silver deposits at Kutná Hora (&quot;Kuttenberg&quot;) sparked a rebellion led by the noble House of Strakonice. The king besieged the rebel fortress of Horažďovice, but died at the campsite in the night of 3 to 4 July 1307, probably of gastrointestinal perforation.

As Rudolf left no children, the first grab of the Habsburgs for the Crown of Saint Wenceslas failed when the Bohemian nobles restored Henry as king in return for a charter of privileges, who in turn had to renounce the throne in favour of Count John of Luxembourg three years later. Instead Rudolph&#x27;s enfeoffment intensified the inner Habsburg inheritance conflict, culminating in the assassination of King Albert I by his nephew John Parricida in 1308. Rudolph is buried at the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague.

<doc id="442912" wikidata="Q17080863" url="?curid=442912" title="Music of Costa Rica">
<text>The country of Costa Rica has many kinds of music.

Though its music has achieved little international credit, Costa Rican popular music genres include an indigenous calypso scene, which is distinct from the more widely known Trinidadian calypso sound, as well as a thriving disco audience that supports nightclubs in cities such as San José. American and British rock and roll and pop are very popular and common among the youth (especially urban youth), while dance-oriented genres including soca, salsa, merengue, cumbia and Tex-Mex have an appeal among a somewhat older audience.

Mexican music is very popular among older people and some people in the countryside. During the middle years of the 20th century, Costa Rica was exposed to much Mexican cultural influence.

Another new genre explored in Costa Rica is Celtic with the group Peregrino Gris.

==Folk Music==

The Caribbean coast shows a strong African influence in the complex percussion rhythms such as sinkit. Like its northerly neighbors in Central America, the marimba is a very popular instrument, and Costa Rican marimba music is very popular. In modern times, groups such as Cantares have helped to popularize Costa Rican folk music, and were a leading part of the New Costa Rican Song movement .

Costa Rica&#x27;s pre-Columbian population has contributed a large part of the country&#x27;s folk heritage, include rare musical scales, certain ceremonial songs and ocarinas. The Guanacaste region, in the Nicoya Peninsula, is home to the best-known folk traditions. Along the Atlantic coast, the African musical heritage is more pronounced, and Afro-Caribbean music including rumba, calypso and reggae are popular.

In most of Costa Rica, ancient instruments such as ocarinas are being replaced by international instruments such as accordions and guitars. There are still folk styles, even outside of Guanacaste, such as the Talamanca (canton)&#x27;s Danza de los Huelos and the Boruca people&#x27;s Danza de los Diablitos.

Guanacaste is the major center for Costa Rican folk music, especially pre-Columbian styles such as the Danza del Sol and Danza de la Luna of the Chorotega, who also popularized the ancient quijongo (a single-string bow and gourd resonator) and native oboe, the chirimia .

Costa Rica&#x27;s population never developed a major rhythm or style that became a major part of popular music, but there have been exceptions, such as the Costa Rican landscape school of painting in the 1920s. The Andean peña tradition (an international gathering of like-minded persons) is strong in Costa Rica as well, introduced by immigrants from Chile and Argentina.

In the late 1980s some local artists and bands became famous for having their own style and original material, such as José Capmany, Distorsión, Café con Leche, Modelo Para Armar and Inconsciente Colectivo; some of them had fans from outside of Costa Rica, such as Editus, a Grammy winning contemporary jazz ensemble. At around that time a popular Latin genre developed, chiqui-chiqui (a mixture of merengue, cumbia and other Latin rhythms along with afro-pop influences) as it was known, led by bands such as Los Hicsos,Jaque Mate, La Pandylla, Manantial and La Banda with well-known classic hits such as La Avispa, El cangrejo, Julieta, El criticon, El hula hula etc.

After losing popularity around the 1990s, chiqui chiqui has resurfaced and established itself as one of the most popular and recognizable music among Costa Ricans, thanks in part to the release of CD re-editions of many classic hits.
Some examples of Costa Rican hits with Chiqui chiqui are:

From the late 1990s to the present time, there has emerged a newer local rock style led by bands such as Gandhi, Evolución, Tango India, Suite Doble, Alma Bohemia, and Kadeho, all of which have been accepted positively by Costa Rican youths. There are Metal bands, including Grecco, Advent of Bedlam, Corpse Garden, Catarsis Incarne, Heresy, to name but a few.

The rock bands begins a new standard to CR&#x27;s music with bands such as Time&#x27;s Forgotten, Pneuma and Sight of Emptiness making really high albums and concerts. The international community starts to take a look at Costa Rica where bands such as Time&#x27;s Forgotten plays in BajaProg (Rock Festival) and have several reviews in the best progressive magazines, sites, and radios. For example, Dividing Line put the album &quot;Dandelion&quot; between the best 15 album in the 2009.

Costa Rica has become a centerfold for international Rock and Metal concerts. Bands such as: Deep Purple, Aerosmith, Anthrax, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, Cannibal Corpse, Apocalyptica, Arch Enemy, Green Day, Helloween, Rhapsody Of Fire, Epica, Nightwish, had come to play in the country, as well as international singers and musicians like Paul McCartney and Carlos Santana.

It became better with the coming of Iron Maiden back in 2008 for the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour, according to sponsors and the Flight 666 documentary, the concert held in Costa Rica was the largest in Central America, with over 27,000 attendants. With that concert, Costa Rica is now becoming an important stop for Metal bands. Examples of this are Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath and Opeth.

Also bands venturing into Reggae and Ska are popular, one example is Mekatelyu and Michael Livingston.

Malpaís, a band emerging from the Guanacaste-area, is one of the central bands of the Costa Rican rock and music scene of today, mixing traditional Costa Rican folk and Latin music with jazz and rock and has met great success in Costa Rica and surrounding countries. Cantoamerica is a band led by Manuel Monestel that for many years has developed research and promotion of the music of the Costa Rican Caribbean coast. Calypso music and other caribbean sounds are included in the band´s repertoire. Cantoamerica has traveled all over the world as ambassador of Afro Costa Rican music.

For all the fanfare of rock, electronic or world music, Latin music is somehow the most common music genre in some specific sectors, and visitors will find that most Costa Ricans of certain generations favor Latin music (Cuban, Mexican and Colombian).

Costa Rica&#x27;s music also includes hip hop,Reggae and electronic. Such artist as Sirius the Dogg Starr, Tiko305, Crypy 626, Huba, Toledo, Gtermis (Ragga by Roots), Charli VL, AXB, Bega, Tapon, shel, gonin, banton y ghetto, kike, Tinez, Original Warrior Street Reggae Artist, 
Poeta, Mr Pray, Jahricio, Rude Boy, Talawa Reggae Army. Hip hop, Reggae, electronic producers such as DJ P, Zion, Killa, aRNine, Chino Artavia, Rooper Francheschi, Kastro, Del Bloke, DJ Arturo morales, DJ Cole, DJ accion, DJ juan, DJ gerarld, DJ action, Marfil (group), moonlight dub (group) have a huge Hip Hop, Reggae, electronic influence in their music. Many of these artists have recorded and produced for local artists and international artists. Starting in the Mids 90s Costa Rican Hip Hop and Reggae culture has grown. Artist Tapon and group Ragga by Roots were the most famous artists in the late 90s with Hits such as &quot;Creada a mi manera&quot; by Tapon and &quot;Sentimientos&quot; by Ragga by Roots. DJ P working mainly on his mixtape and Toledo&#x27;s CDs. Tiko has released 2 successful mixtapes, Tiko&#x27;s Blood Vol. 1 and Tiko&#x27;s Blood vol. 2.

==Classical music==
Costa Rica also has a youth symphony orchestra, founded by ex-President José Figueres Ferrer in the 1970. &quot;Concertina Ana Gabriela Castro-Rosabal&quot; was the first 4-year-old girl/ child/Costa Rican to direct the Youth Symphony Orchestra into tuning in its 1970 Debut, and first 4-year-old violin soloist to play Mozart under the direction of director Gerald Brown. Violinist Ana Gabriela Castro-Rosabal, master in violin performance was the key performer for the youth symphony orchestra Debut in 1970. &quot;La niña violinista del Taburete&quot; was how newspapers used to refer to 4-year-old violin &quot;Concertina Ana Gabriela Castro-Rosabal&quot;. This affectionate title, was given due to the fact, that she was so small, that she used a wooden box, made by her father Enrique, to rest her feet. The wooden box, became the &quot;symbol&quot; of how young this talented girl was.

==Music institutions==

Classical music performing organizations include the Costa Rican National Symphony Orchestra (formed in 1970), which has been conducted by Americans Gerald Brown and Irwin Hoffman, followed by the Japanese Chosei Komatsu. In 2014, Carl. St. Clair assumed the position as music director . The country is also home to an opera company, one of the first professional choirs in Central America, and a state-subsidized youth orchestra, which belongs to the National Symphony Orchestra. The Universidad de Costa Rica has a concert band and an orchestra, besides an early-music group and several chamber music groups.

The National University, Universidad Nacional, has a resident string quartet and a Symphony Orchestra, which had its very successful premiere at the National Theatre in San José on May 10, 2007, conducted by Dieter Lehnhoff. It has also a highly successful piano school led by the Russian virtuoso, Alexandr Sklioutovsky. Other well-known groups are the El Café Chorale and the Sura Chamber Choir and also the pianist Ismael Pacheco, who was the first Costa Rican pianist to have been performed at the prestigious Carnegie Hall in 2001 and also at the Musikverein in 2007 .

Both the Universidad de Costa Rica (UCR), in San José, and the Universidad Nacional (UNA), in Heredia, have well-structured programmes in Music, where students can pursue bachelor&#x27;s degrees in instrumental and vocal performing, composition, and conducting. The latter also has a doctoral degree in Central American Arts and Letters, with an emphasis in Music.

Contemporary composers include Mario Alfagüell, Marvin Camacho, Alejandro Cardona, Bernal Flores, Benjamín Gutiérrez, Luis Diego Herra, and Eddie Mora, to name but a few.

Costa Rican folk institutions include the &quot;Fantasía Folklorica&quot;. Every August, Costa Rica is home to an International Festival of Music.

In recent years the government, led by the Ministerio de Cultura, has aimed to revitalize traditional Costa Rican music.

<doc id="442916" wikidata="Q43987" url="?curid=442916" title="Avian influenza">
<text>Avian influenza, also known as avian flu or bird flu, is a disease caused by the influenza A virus, which primarily affects birds but can sometimes affect mammals including humans. Wild aquatic birds are the primary host of the influenza A virus, which is enzootic (continually present) in many bird populations.

Symptoms of avian influenza vary according to both the strain of virus underlying the infection, and on the species of bird or mammal affected. Classification of a virus strain as either low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) or high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is based on the severity of symptoms in domestic chickens and does not predict severity of symptoms in other species. Chickens infected with LPAI display mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, whereas HPAI causes serious breathing difficulties, significant drop in egg production, and sudden death. Domestic poultry may potentially be protected from specific strains of the virus by vaccination.

Humans and other mammals can only become infected with avian influenza after prolonged close contact with infected birds. In mammals including humans, infection with avian influenza (whether LPAI or HPAI) is rare. Symptoms of infection vary from mild to severe, including fever, diarrhea, and cough.

Influenza A virus is shed in the saliva, mucus, and feces of infected birds; other infected animals may shed bird flu viruses in respiratory secretions and other body fluids (e.g., cow milk). The virus can spread rapidly through poultry flocks and among wild birds. A particularly virulent strain, influenza A virus subtype H5N1 (A/H5N1) has the potential to decimate domesticated poultry stocks and an estimated half a billion farmed birds have been slaughtered in efforts to contain the virus.

== Highly pathogenic avian influenza ==
Because of the impact of avian influenza on economically important chicken farms, a classification system was devised in 1981 which divided avian virus strains as either highly pathogenic (and therefore potentially requiring vigorous control measures) or low pathogenic. The test for this is based solely on the effect on chickens – a virus strain is highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) if 75% or more of chickens die after being deliberately infected with it. The alternative classification is low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI). This classification system has since been modified to take into account the structure of the virus&#x27; haemagglutinin protein. Other species of birds, especially water birds, can become infected with HPAI virus without experiencing severe symptoms and can spread the infection over large distances; the exact symptoms depend on the species of bird and the strain of virus. Classification of an avian virus strain as HPAI or LPAI does not predict how serious the disease might be if it infects humans or other mammals.

Since 2006, the World Organization for Animal Health requires all LPAI H5 and H7 detections to be reported because of their potential to mutate into highly pathogenic strains.

== Virology ==
Avian influenza is caused by the &quot;influenza A virus&quot; which principally affects birds but can also infect humans and other mammals. Influenza A is an RNA virus with a genome comprising a negative-sense, RNA segmented genome that encodes for 11 viral genes. The virus particle (also called the virion) is 80–120 nanometers in diameter and elliptical or filamentous in shape. There is evidence that the virus can survive for long periods in freshwater after being excreted in feces by its avian host, and can withstand prolonged freezing.

There are two proteins on the surface of the viral envelope; hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. These are the major antigens of the virus against which neutralizing antibodies are produced. Influenza virus epidemics and epizootics are associated with changes in their antigenic structure.

Hemagglutinin (H) is an antigenic glycoprotein which allows the virus to bind to and enter the host cell. Neuraminidase (N) is an antigenic glycosylated enzyme which facilitates the release of progeny viruses from infected cells. There are 18 known types of hemagglutinin, of which H1 thru H16 have been found in birds, and 11 types of neuraminidase.

=== Subtypes ===
Subtypes of influenza A are defined by the combination of H and N proteins in the viral envelope; for example, &quot;H5N1&quot; designates an influenza A subtype that has a type-5 hemagglutinin (H) protein and a type-1 neuraminidase (N) protein. The subtyping scheme only takes into account the two envelope proteins, not the other proteins coded by the virus&#x27; RNA. Almost all possible combinations of H (1 thru 16) and N (1 thru 11) have been isolated from wild birds. Further variations exist within the subtypes and can lead to very significant differences in the virus&#x27;s ability to infect and cause disease.

=== Influenza virus nomenclature ===

To unambiguously describe a specific isolate of virus, researchers use the internationally accepted &quot;Influenza virus nomenclature,&quot; which describes, among other things, the species of animal from which the virus was isolated, and the place and year of collection. As an example, A/chicken/Nakorn-Patom/Thailand/CU-K2/04(H5N1):

* A stands for the genus of influenza (A, B or C)
* chicken is the animal species the isolate was found in (note: human isolates lack this component term and are thus identified as human isolates by default)
* Nakorn-Patom/Thailand is the place this specific virus was isolated
* CU-K2 is the laboratory reference number that identifies it from other influenza viruses isolated at the same place and year
* 04 represents the year of isolation 2004
* H5 stands for the fifth of several known types of the protein hemagglutinin
* N1 stands for the first of several known types of the protein neuraminidase.

Other examples include: A/duck/Hong Kong/308/78(H5N3), A/avian/NY/01(H5N2), A/chicken/Mexico/31381-3/94(H5N2), and A/shoveler/Egypt/03(H5N2).

=== Genetic characterization ===
Analysis of the virus&#x27; genome enables researchers to determine the order of its nucleotides. Comparison of the genome of a virus with that of a different virus can reveal differences between the two viruses. Genetic variations are important because they can change amino acids that make up the influenza virus’ proteins, resulting in structural changes to the proteins, and thereby altering properties of the virus. Some of these properties include the ability to evade immunity and the ability to cause severe disease.

Genetic sequencing enables influenza strains to be further characterised by their clade or subclade, revealing links between different samples of virus and tracing the evolution of the virus over time.

=== Species barrier ===
Humans can become infected by the avian flu if they are in close contact with infected birds. Symptoms vary from mild to severe (including death), but as of December 2024 there have been no observed instances of sustained human-human transmission.

There are a number of factors that generally prevent avian influenza viruses from causing epidemics in humans or other mammals.

* The viral HA protein of avian influenza binds to alpha-2,3 sialic acid receptors, which are present in the respiratory tract and intestines of avian species, while human influenza HA binds to alpha-2,6 sialic acid receptors, which are present in the human upper respiratory tract.
* The myxovirus resistance protein (Mx1) is an important antiviral restriction factor that inhibits the replication of avian influenza viruses in particular. Human-adapted strains of IAV display reduced sensitivity to human Mx1 compared with avian strains.
* Other factors include the ability to replicate the viral RNA genome within the host cell nucleus, and to transmit between individuals.

Influenza viruses are constantly changing as small genetic mutations accumulate, a process known as antigenic drift. Over time, mutation may lead to a change in antigenic properties such that host antibodies (acquired through vaccination or prior infection) do not provide effective protection, causing a fresh outbreak of disease.

The segmented genome of influenza viruses facilitates genetic reassortment. This can occur if a host is infected simultaneously with two different strains of influenza virus; then it is possible for the viruses to interchange genetic material as they reproduce in the host cells. Thus, an avian influenza virus can acquire characteristics, such as the ability to infect humans, from a different virus strain. The presence of both alpha 2,3 and alpha 2,6 sialic acid receptors in pig tissues allows for co-infection by avian influenza and human influenza viruses. This susceptibility makes pigs a potential &quot;melting pot&quot; for the reassortment of influenza A viruses.

Avian influenza (historically known as fowl plague) is caused by bird-adapted strains of the influenza type A virus. The disease was first identified by Edoardo Perroncito in 1878 when it was differentiated from other diseases that caused high mortality rates in birds; in 1955 it was established that the fowl plague virus was closely related to human influenza. In 1972, it became evident that many subtypes of avian flu were endemic in wild bird populations.

Between 1959 and 1995, there were 15 recorded outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry, with losses varying from a few birds on a single farm to many millions. Between 1996 and 2008, HPAI outbreaks in poultry have been recorded at least 11 times and 4 of these outbreaks have resulted in the death or culling of millions of birds. Since then, several virus strains (both LPAI and HPAI) have become endemic among wild birds with increasingly frequent outbreaks among domestic poultry, especially of the H5 and H7 subtypes.

=== Transmission and prevention ===
Birds – Influenza A viruses of various subtypes have a large reservoir in wild waterbirds of the orders Anseriformes (for example, ducks, geese, and swans) and Charadriiformes (for example, gulls, terns, and waders) which can infect the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract without affecting the health of the host. They can then be carried by the bird over large distances, especially during annual migration. Infected birds can shed avian influenza A viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions, and feces; susceptible birds become infected when they have contact with the virus as it is shed by infected birds. The virus can survive for long periods in water and at low temperatures, and can be spread from one farm to another on farm equipment. Domesticated birds (chickens, turkeys, ducks, etc.) may become infected with avian influenza A viruses through direct contact with infected waterfowl or other infected poultry, or through contact with contaminated feces or surfaces.

Avian influenza outbreaks in domesticated birds are of concern for several reasons. There is potential for low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAI) to evolve into strains which are high pathogenic to poultry (HPAI), and subsequent potential for significant illness and death among poultry during outbreaks. Because of this, international regulations state that any detection of H5 or H7 subtypes (regardless of their pathogenicity) must be notified to the appropriate authority. It is also possible that avian influenza viruses could be transmitted to humans and other animals which have been exposed to infected birds, causing infection with unpredictable but sometimes fatal consequences.

When an HPAI infection is detected in poultry, it is normal to cull infected animals and those nearby in an effort to rapidly contain, control and eradicate the disease. This is done together with movement restrictions, improved hygiene and biosecurity, and enhanced surveillance. 

Humans – Avian flu viruses, both HPAI and LPAI, can infect humans who are in close, unprotected contact with infected poultry. Incidents of cross-species transmission are rare, with symptoms ranging in severity from no symptoms or mild illness, to severe disease that resulted in death. As of February, 2024 there have been very few instances of human-to-human transmission, and each outbreak has been limited to a few people. All subtypes of avian Influenza A have potential to cross the species barrier, with H5N1 and H7N9 considered the biggest threats.

In order to avoid infection, the general public are advised to avoid contact with sick birds or potentially contaminated material such as carcasses or feces. People working with birds, such as conservationists or poultry workers, are advised to wear appropriate personal protection equipment.

Other animals – a wide range of other animals have been affected by avian flu, generally due to eating birds which had been infected. There have been instances where transmission of the disease between mammals, including seals and cows, may have occurred.

=== Pandemic potential ===
Influenza viruses have a relatively high mutation rate that is characteristic of RNA viruses. The segmentation of the influenza A virus genome facilitates genetic recombination by segment reassortment in hosts who become infected with two different strains of influenza viruses at the same time. With reassortment between strains, an avian strain which does not affect humans may acquire characteristics from a different strain which enable it to infect and pass between humans – a zoonotic event. It is thought that all influenza A viruses causing outbreaks or pandemics among humans since the 1900s originated from strains circulating in wild aquatic birds through reassortment with other influenza strains. It is possible (though not certain) that pigs may act as an intermediate host for reassortment.

As of June 2024, there is concern about two subtypes of avian influenza which are circulating in wild bird populations worldwide, H5N1 and H7N9. Both of these have potential to devastate poultry stocks, and both have jumped to humans with relatively high case fatality rates.

=== Surveillance ===
The Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) is a global network of laboratories that monitor the spread of influenza with the aim to provide the World Health Organization with influenza control information and to inform vaccine development. Several millions of specimens are tested by the GISRS network annually through a network of laboratories in 127 countries. As well as human viruses, GISRS monitors avian, swine, and other potentially zoonotic influenza viruses.

=== Vaccine ===
Poultry – it is possible to vaccinate poultry against specific strains of HPAI influenza. Vaccination should be combined with other control measures such as infection monitoring, early detection and biosecurity.

Humans – Several &quot;candidate vaccines&quot; are available in case an avian virus acquires the ability to infect and transmit among humans. There are strategic stockpiles of vaccines against the H5N1 subtype, which is considered the biggest risk. A vaccine against the H7N9 subtype, which has also infected humans, has undergone a limited amount of testing. In the event of an outbreak, the &quot;candidate&quot; vaccine would be rapidly tested for safety as well as efficacy against the zoonotic strain, and then authorised and distributed to vaccine manufacturers.

Zoonotic influenza vaccine Seqirus is authorized for use in the European Union. It is an H5N8 vaccine that is intended to provide acquired immunity against H5 subtype influenza A viruses.

=== Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 ===
The highly pathogenic influenza A virus subtype H5N1 is an emerging avian influenza virus that is causing global concern as a potential pandemic threat. It is often referred to simply as &quot;bird flu&quot; or &quot;avian influenza&quot;, even though it is only one of many subtypes.

A/H5N1 has killed millions of poultry in a growing number of countries throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa. Health experts are concerned that the coexistence of human flu viruses and avian flu viruses (especially H5N1) will provide an opportunity for genetic material to be exchanged between species-specific viruses, possibly creating a new virulent influenza strain that is easily transmissible and lethal to humans.

Influenza A/H5N1 was first recorded in a small outbreak among poultry in Scotland in 1959, with numerous outbreaks subsequently in every continent. The first known transmission of A/H5N1 to a human occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, when there was an outbreak of 18 human cases resulting in 6 deaths. It was determined that all the infected people had been exposed to infected birds in poultry markets. As the disease continued to spread among poultry flocks in the territory, the decision was made to cull all 1.6 million poultry in the area and to impose strict controls on the movement and handling of poultry. This terminated the outbreak. 

There is weak evidence to support limited human-to-human transmission of A/H5N1 in 139 outbreaks between 2005 and 2009 in Sumatra. The reproduction number was well below the threshold for sustained transmission.

=== Influenza A virus subtype H7N9 ===
A significant outbreak of influenza A virus subtype H7N9 (A/H7N9) started in March 2013 when severe influenza affected 18 humans in China; six subsequently died. It was discovered that a low pathogenic strain of A/H7N9 was circulating among chickens, and that all the affected people had been exposed in poultry markets. Further cases among humans and poultry in mainland China continued to be identified sporadically throughout the year, followed by a peak around the festival season of Chinese New Year (January and February) in early 2014 which was attributed to the seasonal surge in poultry production. Up to December 2013, there had been 139 cases with 47 deaths.

Infections among humans and poultry continued during the next few years, again with peaks around the new year. In 2016 a virus strain emerged which was highly pathogenic to chickens. In order to contain the HPAI outbreak, the Chinese authorities in 2017 initiated a large scale vaccination campaign against avian influenza in poultry. Since then, the number of outbreaks in poultry, as well as the number of human cases, dropped significantly. In humans, symptoms and mortality for both LPAI and HPAI strains have been similar. Although no human H7N9 infections have been reported since February 2019, the virus is still circulating in poultry, particularly in laying hens. It has demonstrated antigenic drift to evade vaccines, and remains a potential threat to the poultry industry and public health.

Genetic and evolutionary analyses have shown that the A(H7) viruses in the Chinese outbreak probably transferred from domestic duck to chicken populations in China and then reassorted with poultry influenza A(H9N2) to generate the influenza A(H7N9) strain that affected humans. The genetic characteristics of A(H7N9) virus are of concern because of their pandemic potential, e.g. their potential to recognise human and avian influenza virus receptors which affects the ability to cause sustained human-to-human transmission, or the ability to replicate in the human host.

Between February 2013 and February 2019, there were 1,568 confirmed human cases and 616 deaths associated with the outbreak in China. The majority of human cases have reported contact with poultry in markets or farms. Transmission between humans remains limited with some evidence of small family clusters. However, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of A/H7N9 influenza.

During early 2017, outbreaks of avian influenza A(H7N9) occurred in poultry in the USA. The strain in these outbreaks was of North American origin and is unrelated to the Asian lineage H7N9 which is associated with human infections in China.

==Domestic animals==
Several domestic species have been infected with and shown symptoms of H5N1 viral infection, including cats, dogs, ferrets, pigs, and birds.

===Poultry===
Attempts are made in the United States to minimize the presence of HPAI in poultry through routine surveillance of poultry flocks in commercial poultry operations. Detection of a HPAI virus may result in immediate culling of the flock. Less pathogenic viruses are controlled by vaccination.

===Dairy cows===
During April 2024, avian influenza was first detected in dairy cows in several US states and subsequently spread more widely through the year. Influenza A(H5N1) was found to be present at high levels in the mammary glands and in the milk of affected cows. It was shown that the virus can persist on milking equipment, which provides a probable transmission route for cow-to-cow and cow-to-human spread. A number of humans who had been in contact with cows tested positive for the virus, with mild symptoms. According to CDC, 7% of 115 dairy workers had evidence of recent infection in a study from Michigan and Colorado from June to August 2024 – half of them asymptomatic. This is higher than estimates from prior transmission studies in poultry. All dairy workers had worked in cleaning the milk parlor and none had used personal protective equipment.

In February 2025, a second type of avian flu, named D1.1, was confirmed in cattle in Nevada, besides the B3.13 circulating in cattle since late 2023, which has infected more than 950 herds in 16 states. This new strain had been present in poultry and &quot;more than a dozen people exposed to poultry&quot; causing mild symptoms but was also found in a dairy worker in Churchill County, Nevada.

== Global aspects ==
===Global measures===
In 2005, the formation of the International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza was announced in order to elevate the importance of avian flu, coordinate efforts, and improve disease reporting and surveillance in order to better respond to future pandemics. New networks of laboratories have emerged to detect and respond to avian flu, such as the Crisis Management Center for Animal Health, the Global Avian Influenza Network for Surveillance, OFFLU, and the Global Early Warning System for major animal diseases. After the 2003 outbreak, WHO member states have also recognized the need for more transparent and equitable sharing of vaccines and other benefits from these networks. Cooperative measures created in response to HPAI have served as a basis for programs related to other emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases.

===Impact on national policies===
HPAI control has also been used for political ends. In Indonesia, negotiations with global response networks were used to recentralize power and funding to the Ministry of Health. In Vietnam, policymakers, with the support of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), used HPAI control to accelerate the industrialization of livestock production for export by proposing to increase the portion of large-scale commercial farms and reducing the number of poultry keepers from 8 to 2 million by 2010.

===Traditional Asian practices===
Backyard poultry production was viewed as &quot;traditional Asian&quot; agricultural practices that contrasted with modern commercial poultry production and seen as a threat to biosecurity. Backyard production appeared to hold greater risk than commercial production due to lack of biosecurity and close contact with humans, though HPAI spread in intensively raised flocks was greater due to high density rearing and genetic homogeneity. Asian culture itself was blamed as the reason why certain interventions, such as those that only looked at place-based interventions, would fail without looking for multifaceted solutions.

===Economic impact===
Approximately 20% of the protein consumed in developing countries come from poultry. A report by FAO totalled economic losses caused by avian influenza in South East Asia up to 2005 around US$10 billion. This had the greatest impact on small scale commercial and backyard producers.

As poultry serves as a source of food security and liquid assets, the most vulnerable populations were poor, small scale farmers. The loss of birds due to HPAI and culling in Vietnam led to an average loss of 2.3 months of production and US$69–108 for households where many have an income of $2 a day or less. The loss of food security for vulnerable households can be seen in the stunting of children under five in Egypt. Women are another population at risk as in most regions of the world, small flocks are tended to by women. Widespread culling also resulted in the decreased enrollment of girls in school in Turkey.

<text>Garifuna music is an ethnic music and dance with African, Arawak, and Kalinago elements, originating with the Afro-Indigenous Garifuna people from Central America and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. In 2001, Garifuna music, dance, and language were collectively proclaimed as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.

==Nonsecular music==

===Genres===
Nonsecular musical genres within the Garifuna culture stem from a fusion of West African ancestral worship and Amerindian shamanism. Examples of Garifuna music rituals include &quot;Adügürühani&quot; (also known as &quot;dügü&quot;), a healing ceremony; &quot;Arairaguni&quot;, an invocation to determine illness; &quot;Amuyadahani&quot;, a ritual in which family members make offerings to their ancestors; and &quot;Achuguhani&quot; (Chugú), &quot;feeding the dead&quot;.

===&quot;Dügü&quot; (Feeding the Dead)===
The Garifuna tradition of &quot;Adügürühani&quot; is a ritual that takes place when a Garifuna individual becomes ill and must consult a shaman in the hopes of restoring their health. The shaman will consult with the ancestral spirits (&quot;gubida&quot;) that have inflicted the illness upon the individual. Drums are played during the &quot;dügü&quot;, which is thought to have a calming effect on the individual who is possessed by the &quot;gubida&quot;. The drumming is performed in triple meter and is accompanied by song and dance. Often there are two to three drums, and the ensemble of drummers is called &quot;dangbu&quot;. The drums are constructed using mahogany or mayflower wood and animal skins (usually deer, goat, or peccary). During construction, the drums are rubbed with a cassava wine and then subsequently blessed with the smoke of buwe—a sacred herb. These techniques suggest the presence of both African and Amerindian influences in drum construction, indicative of a fusion of African and Amerindian culture in Garifuna sacred music.

The gender roles documented in the musical performances of &quot;dügü&quot; suggest that traditional Garifuna society emphasizes matrilineality and matrifocality. &quot;The texts of most &quot;dügü&quot; songs refer to ancestors as female (grandmother or great-grandmother, even if the &quot;dügü&quot; is being given in honor of a man)… It may also be a reflection of gender-based empowerment, because older women predominate as organizers, ritual participants, and composers of ritual songs.&quot; Gender roles are often portrayed in music. &quot;Music performance can and often does play an important role in inter-gender relations, for the inequalities or asymmetries perceived in such relations may be protested, mediated, reversed, and transformed, or confined through various social/musical strategies.&quot; The matrilineatlity demonstrated in the Garifuna &quot;dügü&quot; ritual demonstrates an authentic (non-westernized) aspect of West African and/or Amerindian culture, which remained unaffected by Spanish (and subsequently, British) colonization.

==Secular music==
===Genres===
Garifuna genres include punta, paranda, and punta rock.

There are different types of songs, some of which are associated with work, some with play, some with dance, and some that are reserved for prayer or ritual use.

===Instruments===
The main traditional instruments are drums and maracas.

Drums play an important role in Garifuna music. The main drum is the Segunda (bass drum). The drums are normally made by hollowing out logs and stretching antelope skin over them.

<doc id="442922" wikidata="Q72127" url="?curid=442922" title="Ernst Boepple">
<text>&quot;SS-Oberführer&quot; Ernst Boepple (30 November 1887 – 15 December 1950) was a Nazi official and SS officer, serving as deputy to Josef Bühler in occupied Poland during World War II and the Holocaust, who was executed for war crimes.

==Life==
Boepple earned his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1905 at the Gymnasium in Reutlingen. Then he studied languages and history at several universities: University of Tübingen, University of Paris, University of Oxford, and the 
University of London and earned his PhD in 1915.—with the doctoral thesis: &quot;Frederick the Great&#x27;s Relation to Württemberg&quot;. He fought in the First World War in the infantry and left the German Army with the rank of first lieutenant (&quot;Oberleutnant&quot;) in 1919.

===Director of Nazi publishing enterprise===
Boepple became a co-worker of the publisher Julius Friedrich Lehmann and was one of the founders of the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP). In 1919 he took over the &quot;Deutsche Volksverlag&quot; publishing house, which had been established by Lehmann. There he published Anton Drexler&#x27;s &quot;My Political Awakening&quot;. The &quot;Deutsche Volksverlag&quot; published a large section of the early formative Nazi literature including:
* Wilhelm Meister (i.e. Dr. Paul Bang): &quot;Jewry&#x27;s debt-book - a German accounting&quot;, 1919 (Judas Schuldbuch - eine deutsche Abrechnung)
* Minister Karl Gerecke: &quot;Biblical anti-Semitism: Jewry&#x27;s character in world history, guilt and the end in prophet Jona&#x27;s reflection&quot;, 1920 (Biblischer Antisemitismus. Der Juden weltgeschichtlicher Charakter, Schuld und Ende in des Propheten Jona Judenspiegel)
* Maria Groener: &quot;Schopenhauer and the Jews&quot;, 1920 (Schopenhauer und die Juden)
* Dr. Hans Grunsky: &quot;Richard Wagner and the Jews&quot;, 1920 (Richard Wagner und die Juden)

* Alfred Rosenberg: &quot;Bolshevism, hunger, death&quot;, 1922 (Bolschewismus, Hunger, Tod)

In November 1923 Ernst Boepple took part in the Beer Hall Putsch.

===World War II===
When Hans Schemm died after an aircraft crash, Boepple became the Bavarian Minister for Culture until the invasion of Poland in 1939. In 1940 he again served in the military. On 1 September 1941 he was appointed the State Secretary of the General Government in occupied Poland, serving as deputy to Deputy Governor Josef Bühler. Boepple was deeply implicated in the Final Solution as the deputy to Bühler and also held rank in the SS, being an &quot;SS-Oberführer&quot; (senior colonel).

Several months after Germany&#x27;s surrender, Boepple was arrested by U.S. soldiers in Bavaria. He was extradited to Poland in 1947, where he was sentenced to death by a Polish court on 14 December 1949. Boepple was hanged on 15 December 1950.

<text>The basset clarinet is member of the clarinet family similar to the usual soprano clarinet but longer and with additional keys to enable playing several additional lower notes. Typically a basset clarinet has keywork going to a low (written) C or B, as opposed to the standard clarinet&#x27;s E or E. The basset clarinet is most commonly a transposing instrument in A, although basset clarinets in C and B and very seldom in G also exist. The similarly named basset horn is also a clarinet with extended lower range, but is in a lower pitch (typically F); the basset horn predates, and undoubtedly inspired, the basset clarinet.

== History ==

The earliest surviving instruments in Paris and London museums date from 1770. The basset clarinet was most notably associated with the clarinet virtuoso Anton Stadler (1753–1812), a contemporary and good friend of Mozart. The instrument used by Stadler was invented and built by the Vienna K.K. court instrument maker Theodor Lotz around 1788. It has long been unclear how this instrument might have looked. In a library in Riga in 1992 programmes were found of concerts which Anton Stadler played there in 1794. Two of those programmes show an engraving of Stadler&#x27;s instrument (see picture on the right). The term &quot;basset clarinet&quot; was in use by 1796, though it may originally have referred to the basset horn.

Mozart wrote his Clarinet Quintet in A major, K.581 and Clarinet Concerto in A Major, K.622 for this instrument; the concerto is partly based on an earlier fragment of a Concerto for Basset Horn in G, K.584b. In his last opera &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;, Mozart assigned a basset clarinet in B in the aria &quot;Parto parto, ma tu ben mio, meco ritorna in pace&quot; by Sesto (mezzo-soprano) an outstanding solo role in an approximately 8-minute dialogue with the singer, the musical climax of this act, if not the whole opera.

Because Mozart&#x27;s clarinet concerto is so important, the basset clarinet is quite an interesting instrument in spite of its small applicability. For the concerto the extension must be chromatic and the shape of the Viennese basset horn is not suitable for this. On period instruments following the Riga design a low B may be obtained by closing a keyless hole on the &quot;L&quot; joint with the knee or thigh. Editions demonstrating and advocating the use of this note in the Clarinet Concerto KV 622 and Quintet KV 581 have been published by Craig Hill.

Despite Stadler&#x27;s advocacy the instrument did not become a regular member of the orchestra. During the 19th and early 20th centuries only a few basset clarinets were produced, for performances of Mozart pieces, and no further music was written for the instrument (see under External links: Mozarts&#x27;s lost clarinet). However, beginning in the mid 20th century, interest in performing on original instruments prompted the basset clarinet&#x27;s revival. A few modern composers, among them Thomas Adès, Bill Sweeney, Harrison Birtwistle, Alan Hacker, Hannes Pohlit and Franklin Stover, have written works featuring basset clarinet; Joan Tower&#x27;s 1988 Clarinet Concerto is written to be played on either basset or standard clarinet.

== Construction ==

The construction of a modern basset clarinet can be rectilinear, like a normal clarinet (see the two photos below right). However, the clarinet can have a bell, which is slightly upwards and forwards aligned via an angled intermediate piece (see photo above in the infobox). Charles Neidich has had a basset clarinet with modern mechanics built by Schwenk &amp; Seggelke, which, like the Stadler clarinet, has an angled barrel and as a bell has a &quot;&quot;, which he turns backwards, although one can turn it forward. The different types and directions of the bell have an influence on the sound.

== Fingering of the basset notes ==

A basset clarinet is most commonly an A-clarinet with an extension of a major third or perfect fourth down. In the case of historical instruments as well as those of the German system, the additional deep tones C, C sharp, D and E flat are fingered with the right thumb, likewise in the case of instruments of the French system made by German manufacturers (e.g. Herbert Wurlitzer and Leitner &amp; Kraus). On the other hand, the basset clarinets of the French system of other manufacturers are equipped with two additional pushers for the small right finger for the notes D and E flat as well as two thumb pushers for the notes C and C sharp (standard). The German manufacturer Schwenk &amp; Seggelke offers a choice of both tuners for the French system and, as additional to the standard a pusher for the small left finger for the note D, which can then be fingered twice, see the photos below. On instruments by the Canadian manufacturer Stephen Fox, D is also pressed with the small left finger and, if available, the low B (big octave) with the small right finger, while the three other basset notes are pressed with the right thumb, see description and illustration. In 2021 the German manufacturer F. Arthur Uebel, together with the American clarinettist Ricardo Morales, developed a new Boehm basset clarinet in which the two additional pushers for the little finger on the right are not, as usual, for D and E flat, but for C sharp and e flat. For the D there is an additional pusher for the little finger on the left (as with Seggelke) and for the C a thumb key (the only one).

Particularly innovative in the German system are the four thumb pushers of the basset keys made by the Austrian manufacturer Gerold-Klarinetten, supplemented by a fifth pusher for improving the intonation of low F and E.

== Compositions ==

From Mozart to the present there are hardly more than 60 compositions for this instrument. The most significant are the compositions already mentioned:
* W. A. Mozart: Quintet for basset clarinet, 2 violins, viola and cello in A major, K 581
* W. A. Mozart: Concerto for basset clarinet and orchestra in A major, K 622
* W. A. Mozart: Opera La Clemenza di Tito, No. 9, aria from Sesto “Parto, parto, ma tu ben mio”, for mezzo-soprano, basset clarinet in B obbligato and orchestra.

Most of the other compositions were created after 1950. It refers to
* Concerts with solo basset clarinet: amongst others by Joan Tower (born 1938 US), Manfred Trojahn (born 1949 Germany), (born 1955 Germany),
* Pieces for basset clarinet solo: amongst others by Michiko Kawagoe (Japan), Aribert Reimann (born 1936 Germany), Ondreij Sarek (Czech Republic), Christopher M. Wicks (born 1975, US),
* Duos with basset clarinet: amongst others by Harrison Birtwistle (born 1934 England), Istvan Bozicevik (Croatia), Erika Fox (born 1936 Austria / GB), Patrick Nunn (born 1969 GB), (born 1935, Germany), William Sweeney (born 1950 GB) and Gary Carpenter (born 1951 GB)
* Trios with basset clarinet: amongst others by François Devienne (1759–1803 France), (born 1955 Germany),
* Quintets with basset clarinet: amongst others by Harrison Birtwistle (born 1934 GB), Antonín Dvořák (1841–1904 Austria / Hungary)
* Larger chamber music ensembles with basset clarinet: amongst others by Klaus Huber (1924–2017 Swiss)
* Orchestral music and operas with basset clarinet: amongst others by Thomas Adés (born 1971 GB), W. A. Mozart (1756–1791), opera &quot;Cosi fan tutte&quot; aria by Ferrando (No. 24) &quot;Ah! Io veggio&quot; and Ferdinando Paer (1771–1839 Italy), opera &quot;Sargino&quot; (1803), aria &quot;Una voca al cor mi parla&quot;.

== Makers ==

Some clarinet makers now produce basset clarinets, or extended lower joints which will convert a standard clarinet to a basset clarinet. Among makers of basset clarinets using the French (Boehm) system are Buffet Crampon, Stephen Fox, Backun Musical Services, and Selmer.

Some makers of both French and German (Oehler) systems: Herbert Wurlitzer, Schwenk &amp; Seggelke and Leitner &amp; Kraus. A maker of the German system only: Hüyng. Makers of basset lower joints include Fox.

== Performers ==

Classical clarinetists who have recorded albums using basset clarinet include Colin Lawson, David Shifrin, Antony Pay, Sabine Meyer, Richard Haynes and Kari Kriikku. Also Martin Fröst, Sharon Kam, Shirley Brill, Annelien Van Wauwe and Sebastian Manz play the Mozart-concerto on a basset clarinet. The German clarinetist Theo Jörgensmann plays free jazz on a basset clarinet as does Los Angeles based performer Vinny Golia (who also uses the basset horn in his music). The British clarinetist Thea King recorded Mozart&#x27;s Quintet and Concerto, both on the basset clarinet, for Hyperion Records, coupled together on one CD. Michael Collins, who studied with Thea King, has recorded the Mozart Concerto playing a basset clarinet (Deutsche Grammophon, along with a transcription for clarinet of Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Concerto). With the North Carolina Symphony on April 10, 2008, Collins premiered Elena Kats-Chernin&#x27;s &quot;Ornamental Air&quot;, which takes the form of a concerto for basset clarinet. Another British player, Joy Farrall, has also recorded Mozart&#x27;s Concerto and Quintet (BMG and Meridian) using a basset clarinet, alongside the &quot;Kegelstatt Trio&quot; for clarinet, viola and piano. On period instruments, Jane Booth has recorded the Mozart Quintet with the Eybler Quartet (Analekta, 2010). Working in both practice and theory, Colin Lawson&#x27;s celebrated recording of Mozart&#x27;s Clarinet Concerto K. 622 with the Hanover Band for Nimbus, released in 1990, complements his Cambridge &quot;Handbook to Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto&quot; published in 1996.

The American clarinetist Charles Neidich, the Italian Luca Lucchetta, the Belgian Vlad Weverbergh and the Swedish Stefan Harg, all committed to historical performance practice, play Mozart on replicas of Stadler&#x27;s basset clarinet. Also in performances of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;, Sesto&#x27;s aria &quot;Parto, ma tu ben mio&quot; increasingly uses the prescribed prominent basset clarinet in B instead of a normal clarinet, as well as in concert performances of this aria at the performances of the 2017 Opera in Salzburg and 2018 in Amsterdam with the German clarinetist Florian Schuele. Australian clarinetist Richard Haynes performs on a basset clarinet d&#x27;amore (see clarinet d&#x27;amore) in G and commissions new solo and chamber works for this instrument.

<text>Fritz Thiedemann (; 3 March 1918 – 8 January 2000) was a German equestrian, considered to be one of the greatest show jumpers of his time.

==Biography==
Thiedemann was born as the son of a farmer. His riding talents became clear at a young age, but he could not display them internationally until after World War II. During the war, Theidemann commanded a cavalry unit and was captured and interned at a Russian prison camp by war&#x27;s end.

At the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Thiedemann won medals in two equestrian disciplines, a feat since unequalled. He placed third in the dressage team event, and won another bronze medal in the individual jumping contest with his favourite horse &quot;Meteor&quot;, with which he would win all major prizes in his career.

The following year, Thiedemann won a jumping silver at the World Championships in Paris. Winning another medal (bronze) in that event in 1956 in Aachen. That same year, he won a gold medal with the United Team of Germany in the 1956 Olympics in Stockholm, while just missing out on an individual medal with a fourth position.

At the 1958 European Championships in Aachen, he took the title. Thiedemann was the flag-bearer of the United Team of Germany (composed of both East and West German athletes) at the 1960 Olympics in Rome. The United Team of Germany successfully defended their jumping title, Thiedemann winning his fourth Olympic medal. In addition, he placed 6th in the individual jumping competition.

Thiedemann died in his birthplace Heide aged 81. The Thiedemann rein is named after him.

<text>The onager (, ; ) was a Roman torsion-powered siege engine. It is commonly depicted as a catapult with a bowl, bucket, or sling at the end of its throwing arm. The onager was first mentioned in 353 AD by Ammianus Marcellinus, who described onagers as the same as a scorpion. The onager is often confused with the later mangonel, a &quot;traction trebuchet&quot; that replaced torsion powered siege engines in the 6th century AD.

According to two authors of the later Roman Empire who wrote on military affairs, the onager&#x27;s name, meaning wild ass, derived from the kicking action of the machine that threw stones into the air. This action resembled the kicking action of the hooves of the wild ass, the Syrian wild ass, a subspecies of onager, which was native to the eastern part of the empire. In Latin this species was known as &quot;onagrum&quot;.

== Design ==
The onager consisted of a large frame placed horizontally on the ground with a vertical frame of solid timber rigidly fixed to its front end. A vertical spoke that passed through a rope bundle fastened to the frame had a cup, bucket, or sling attached which contained a projectile. To fire it, the spoke or arm was forced down, against the tension of twisted ropes or other springs, by a windlass, and then suddenly released. As the sling swung outwards, one end would release, as with a staff-sling, and the projectile would be hurled forward. The arm would then be caught by a padded beam or bed when it could be winched back again. It weighed around two to six tons. Flavius Josephus described an instance where an onager shot a rock over a distance. According to Ammianus Marcellinus, a single-armed onager required eight men to wind down the arm. When it fired, the recoil was so great that it made the onager impossible to place on stone walls because the stones would be dislodged. This was confirmed by a reconstructed onager, considerably smaller than the ones described in the sources, that still caused substantial recoil. Its shot weighed .

According to the historian Peter Purton:

== History ==
The onager was used from the 4th century until the 6th century. It may have originated in the third century BC. It was initially developed for the purpose of disrupting enemy lines and destroying walls. The late-fourth century author Ammianus Marcellinus describes &#x27;onager&#x27; as a neologism for scorpions and relates various incidents in which the engines fire both rocks and arrow-shaped missiles. According to Ammianus, the onager was a single-armed torsion engine unlike the twin-armed ballista before it. It needed eight men just to wind down the arm and could not be placed on fortifications because of its great recoil. It had very low mobility and was difficult to aim. Originally it used a bucket or cup to hold the projectile but at some point it was replaced with a sling, which elongated the throwing arm without burdening it and allowed for a greater range of shot.

In 378, the onager was used against the Goths at Adrianople and although it did not cause any casualties, its large stone projectile was incredibly frightening to the Goths. The late-fourth or early-fifth century military writer Vegetius stipulates that a legion ought to field ten onagers, one for each cohort. These he says should be transported fully assembled on ox carts to ensure readiness in case of sudden attack, in which case the onagers could be used for defense immediately. For Vegetius, the onagers were stone throwing machines.

In the late 6th century the Pannonian Avars brought the Chinese traction trebuchet, otherwise known as the mangonel, to the Mediterranean, where it soon replaced the slower and more complex torsion powered engines. The onager may have continued to be used by the Byzantines and Arabs during the Middle Ages. In modern history, the mangonel is often misrepresented as an onager although there is no evidence of its usage beyond the 6th century AD.

The first attempts to reconstruct the onager were made by Chevalier de Folard and Robert Melvill in the 18th century. Swiss general Guillaume Henri Dufour made another attempt to reconstruct the onager based on the work of de Folard in 1840. Napoleon III had his general Verchère de Reffye create a reconstruction of the onager. By the end of the nineteenth century Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey made another attempt at reconstructing the onager. Later, the German major-general Erwin Schramm and the British scholar Eric Marsden made a reconstruction of the onager which became the basis of the modern understanding of the weapon.

== Effectiveness ==
The onager was considered to be less accurate and cruder than the ballista. One reason the onager may have become the Roman military&#x27;s primary type of torsion catapult was because it was easier to produce and required less technical knowledge to operate. The onager was used to destroy walls and create confusion amongst the enemy lines. Ammianus Marcellinus described an instance during an Alemanni incursion in Gaul where although the onager fired a rock that did not kill anyone, it created mass confusion amongst the enemy and routed them.

<text>A calendar era is the period of time elapsed since one &quot;epoch&quot; of a calendar and, if it exists, before the next one. For example, the current year is numbered 2025 in the Gregorian calendar, which numbers its years in the Western Christian era (the Coptic Orthodox and Ethiopian Orthodox churches have their own Christian eras).

In antiquity, regnal years were counted from the accession of a monarch. This makes the chronology of the ancient Near East very difficult to reconstruct, based on disparate and scattered king lists, such as the Sumerian King List and the Babylonian Canon of Kings. In East Asia, reckoning by era names chosen by ruling monarchs ceased in the 20th century except for Japan, where they are still used.

==Ancient dating systems==

===Assyrian eponyms===
For over a thousand years, ancient Assyria used a system of eponyms to identify each year. Each year at the Akitu festival (celebrating the Mesopotamian new year), one of a small group of high officials (including the king in later periods) would be chosen by lot to serve as the &quot;limmu&quot; for the year, which meant that he would preside over the Akitu festival and the year would bear his name. The earliest attested &quot;limmu&quot; eponyms are from the Assyrian trading colony at Karum Kanesh in Anatolia, dating to the very beginning of the 2nd millennium BC, and they continued in use until the end of the Neo-Assyrian Period, .

Assyrian scribes compiled &quot;limmu&quot; lists, including an unbroken sequence of almost 250 eponyms from the early 1st millennium BC. This is an invaluable chronological aid, because a solar eclipse was recorded as having taken place in the &quot;limmu&quot; of Bur-Sagale, governor of Guzana. Astronomers have identified this eclipse as one that took place on 15 June 763 BC, which has allowed absolute dates of 892 to 648 BC to be assigned to that sequence of eponyms. This list of absolute dates has allowed many of the events of the Neo-Assyrian Period to be dated to a specific year, avoiding the chronological debates that characterize earlier periods of Mesopotamian history.

===Olympiad dating===
Among the ancient Greek historians and scholars, a common method of indicating the passage of years was based on the Olympic Games, first held in 776 BC. The Olympic Games provided the various independent city-states with a mutually recognizable system of dates. Olympiad dating was not used in everyday life. This system was in use from the 3rd century BC. The modern Olympic Games (or Summer Olympic Games beginning 1896) do not continue the four year periods from ancient Greece: the 669th Olympiad would have begun in the summer of 1897, but the modern Olympics were first held in 1896.

===Indiction cycles===
The indiction cycle was an agricultural tax cycle implemented in Roman Egypt. 15 indictions made up the cycle, an indiction being a year in duration. Documents and events began to be dated by the year of the cycle (e.g., &quot;fifth indiction&quot;, &quot;tenth indiction&quot;) in the 4th century, and this system was used long after the tax ceased to be collected. It was used in Gaul, in Egypt until the Islamic conquest, and in the Eastern Roman Empire until its conquest in 1453.

A useful chart providing all the equivalents can be found in Chaîne&#x27;s book on chronology, and can easily be consulted online at the Internet Archive, from to . 

A rule for computing the indiction from an AD year number was stated by Dionysius Exiguus: add 3 and divide by 15; the remainder is the indiction, with 0 understood to be the fifteenth indiction. Thus the indiction of 2001 was 9. The beginning of the year for the indiction varied.

===Seleucid era===
The Seleucid era was used in much of the Middle East from the 4th century BC to the 6th century AD, and continued until the 10th century AD among Oriental Christians. The era is computed from the epoch 312 BC: in August of that year Seleucus I Nicator captured Babylon and began his reign over the Asian portions of Alexander the Great&#x27;s empire. Thus depending on whether the calendar year is taken as starting on 1 Tishri or on 1 Nisan (respectively the start of the Jewish civil and ecclesiastical years) the Seleucid era begins either in 311 BC (the Jewish reckoning) or in 312 BC (the Greek reckoning: October–September).

===Ancient Rome===

====Consular dating====
An early and common practice was Roman &#x27;consular&#x27; dating. This involved naming both &quot;consules ordinarii&quot; who had taken up this office on 1 January (since 153 BC) of the relevant civil year. Sometimes one or both consuls might not be appointed until November or December of the previous year, and news of the appointment may not have reached parts of the Roman empire for several months into the current year; thus we find the occasional inscription where the year is defined as &quot;after the consulate&quot; of a pair of consuls.

The use of consular dating ended in AD 541 when the emperor Justinian I discontinued appointing consuls. The last consul nominated was Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius. Soon afterwards, imperial regnal dating was adopted in its place.

====Dating from the founding of Rome====
Another method of dating was &quot;ab urbe condita&quot; (Latin for &quot;from the founding of the city&quot; of Rome) or (Latin for &quot;in the year of the founding of the city&quot;), both abbreviated AUC.

Several epochs for this date were in use by Roman historians, all based on the incomplete surviving list of Roman consuls and the myths of the city&#x27;s founding by Romulus and Remus. The chronology established by Marcus Terentius Varro in the 1st century BC intercalated several years of dictatorships, a period of anarchy, and a standardized length of reign for all of Rome&#x27;s former kings to arrive at a year running from 754753BC, taken as equivalent to the 3rd year of the 6th Olympiad. Because the Parilia had become associated with the founding of the city by his time, he took the specific date to have been 21 April 753BC. This became the official chronology of the empire by at least the time of Claudius, who held Secular Games in AD 47 to celebrate the city&#x27;s 800th anniversary. The 900th and 1000th anniversaries were then celebrated in 148 under Antoninus Pius and in 248 under Philip I.

The AUC era was seldom used in the traditional Roman or early Julian calendars. Naming each year by its two consuls or by the emperor&#x27;s regnal years predominated, with Hadrian&#x27;s aurei and sestertii marking the Romaea in AUC 874 () a notable exception. AUC dating became more common in late antiquity, appearing in Censorinus, Orosius, and others. During the early Middle Ages, some church officials like Boniface IV employed AUC and AD dating together.

Historical Roman dating employed several different dates for the beginning of the year. Modern application of the AUC era generally ignores this, the known mistakes in Varro&#x27;s own calculations, and the 752BC epoch used by the Fasti and later Secular Games, such that AD 2025 is generally considered equivalent to AUC 2778 (2025 + 753).

====Regnal years of Roman emperors====
Another system that is less commonly found than might be thought was the use of the regnal year of the Roman emperor. At first, Augustus indicated the year of his reign by counting how many times he had held the office of consul, and how many times the Roman Senate had granted him the power of a tribune (, abbr. TRP), carefully observing the fiction that his powers came from these offices granted to him, rather than from his own person or the many legions under his control. His successors followed his practice until the memory of the Roman Republic faded (about AD 200), when they began to use their regnal year openly.

====Dating from the Roman conquest====
Some regions of the Roman Empire dated their calendars from the date of Roman conquest, or the establishment of Roman rule.

The Spanish era, or the Era of Caesar, counted the years from 38 BC and, although the exact reasons for this are unknown, it is usually attributed to either the levy of a general tax from the known world by Octavian or the end of the roman conquest of the peninsula during the civil war of the Second Triumvirate. Either way the date traditionally marks the establishment of Roman rule in Spain and was used in official documents by the Suebian and Visigothic kingdoms and later in Portugal, Aragon, Valencia, Castile, and southern France. This system of calibrating years fell to disuse in the Early Modern Age and was replaced by today&#x27;s &quot;Anno Domini&quot;. The months and years are the same as the Julian Calendar.

Throughout the Roman and Byzantine periods, the Decapolis and other Hellenized cities of Syria and Palestine used the Pompeian era, counting dates from the Roman general Pompey&#x27;s conquest of the region in 63 BC.

===Maya===
A different form of calendar was used to track longer periods of time, and for the inscription of calendar dates (i.e., identifying when one event occurred in relation to others). This form, known as the Long Count, is based upon the number of elapsed days since a mythological starting-point. According to the calibration between the Long Count and Western calendars accepted by the great majority of Maya researchers (known as the GMT correlation), this starting-point is equivalent to 11 August, 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or 6 September in the Julian calendar (−3113 astronomical).

===Other dating systems===
A great many local systems or eras were also important, for example the year from the foundation of one particular city, the regnal year of the neighboring Persian emperor, and eventually even the year of the reigning Caliph.

==Late Antiquity and Middle Ages==
Most of the traditional calendar eras in use today were introduced at the time of transition from Late Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages, roughly between the 6th and 10th centuries.

===Christian era===
*The &quot;Etos Kosmou&quot; of the Byzantine Calendar commences with the creation of the world portrayed in Genesis, the date of which- arrived at by the monk Giorgios- being 1 September, 5509 BC. Its first known use occurred in the 7th century AD, although its precursors were developed about AD 400.
*The Era of Martyrs or Era of Diocletian is reckoned from the beginning of the reign of Roman Emperor Diocletian; the first year of this era was 284/5. It was not the custom to use regnal years in Rome, but it was the custom in Roman Egypt, which the emperor ruled through a prefect (the king of Egypt). The year number changed on the first day of the Egyptian month Thoth (29 August three years out of four, 30 August the year before a Roman leap year.) Diocletian abolished the special status of Egypt, which thereafter followed the normal Roman calendar: consular years beginning on 1 January. This era was used in the Easter tables prepared in Alexandria long after the abdication of Diocletian, even though Diocletian was a notorious persecutor of Christians. The Era of Diocletian was retained by the Coptic Church and used for general purposes, but by 643 the name had been changed to Era of the Martyrs.
*The Incarnation Era is used by Ethiopia. Its epoch is 29 August, AD 8 in the Julian calendar.
*The Armenian calendar has its era fixed at AD 552.

====Dionysian &quot;Common Era&quot;====
The era based on the Incarnation of Christ was introduced by Dionysius Exiguus in 525 and is in continued use with various reforms and derivations. The distinction between the Incarnation occurring with the conception or the Nativity of Jesus was not drawn until the late ninth century. The first day of the numbered year varied from place to place and depended on the calendar in use: when, in 1600, Scotland adopted 1 January as the first day of the year, this was already the case in much of continental Europe. England adopted this practice in 1752.

* A.D. (or AD) – for the Latin &quot;Anno Domini&quot;, meaning &quot;in the year of (our) Lord&quot;. This is the dominant or Western Christian Era; AD is used in the Gregorian calendar. &quot;Anno Salutis&quot;, meaning &quot;in the year of salvation&quot; is identical. Originally intended to number years from the Incarnation of Jesus, according to modern thinking the calculation was a few years off. Years preceding AD 1 are numbered using the BC era, avoiding zero or negative numbers. AD was also used in the Christianized Julian calendar, but the first day of the year was either 1 March, Easter, 25 March (Feast of the Annunciation), 1 September, or 25 December (Feast of the Nativity), not 1 January. To distinguish between the Julian and Gregorian calendars, &quot;O.S.&quot; and &quot;N.S.&quot; were often added to the date, especially during the 17th and 18th centuries, when both calendars were in common use. Old Style (O.S.) was used for the Julian calendar and for years not beginning on 1 January. New Style (N.S.) was used for the Gregorian calendar and for Julian calendar years beginning on 1 January. Many countries switched to using 1 January as the start of the numbered year at the same time as they switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, but others switched earlier or later.
* B.C. (or BC) – meaning &quot;Before Christ&quot;. Used for years before AD 1, counting backwards so the year &quot;n&quot; BC is &quot;n&quot; years before AD 1. Thus there is no year 0.
* C.E. (or CE) and B.C.E. (or BCE) – meaning &quot;Common Era&quot; and &quot;Before the Common Era&quot;, numerically equivalent to AD and BC, respectively (in writing, &quot;AD&quot; &quot;precedes&quot; the year number, but &quot;CE&quot; &quot;follows&quot; the year: AD 1 = 1 CE.) The Latin equivalent &quot;vulgaris aera&quot; was used as early as 1615 by Johannes Kepler. The English abbreviations C.E. and B.C.E. were introduced in the 19th century by Jewish intellectuals, wishing to avoid the abbreviation for &quot;dominus&quot; &quot;lord&quot; in implicit reference to Christ. By the later 20th century, the abbreviations had come into wider usage by authors who wished to emphasize secularism.

=====Dionysian-derived=====
* Astronomical year numbering situates its year 0 with 1 BC, and counts negative years from 2 BC backward (−1 backward), so 100 BC is −99.
* The human era, also named Holocene era, proposed by Cesare Emiliani adds 10,000 to AD years, so that AD 1 would be the year 10,001.
* &quot;Anno Lucis&quot; of Freemasonry adds 4000 years to the AD year.

===Islamic===
*A.H. (or AH) for the Latinized &quot;Anno Hegirae&quot;, meaning &quot;in the year of the Hijra&quot;, Muhammad&#x27;s emigration from Mecca to Medina in September 622, which occurred in its first year, is used in the Islamic calendar. Since the Islamic calendar is a purely lunar calendar of about 354 or 355 days, its year count increases faster than that of solar and lunisolar calendars.
*S.H. (or SH) is used by the Iranian calendar to denote the number of &quot;solar&quot; years since the Hijra. The year beginning at the vernal equinox equals the number of the Gregorian year beginning at the preceding 1 January minus 621.

===Hindu===
*Hindu calendar, counting from the start of the Kali Yuga, with its epoch on 18 February, 3102 BC Julian (23 January, 3102 BC Gregorian), based on Aryabhata (6th century).
*Vikrama Samvat, 56-57 BC, introduced about the 12th century.
*S.E. or (SE) – for the Saka Era, used in some Hindu calendars and in the Indian national calendar, with an epoch near the vernal equinox of year 78 (its year 0); its usage spread to Southeast Asia before year 1000. This era is also used (together with the Gregorian calendar) in the Indian national calendar, the official civil calendar used in communiques issued by the Government of India.
*Lakshmana Era, established by the Bengali ruler Lakshmana Sena with an epoch of 1118–1119. It was used for at least 400 years in Bihar and Bengal.

===Southeast Asia===
The Hindu Saka Era influences the calendars of southeast Asian indianized kingdoms.
*B.E. – for the Buddhist Era, introduced by Vajiravudh in 1912, which has an epoch (origin) of 544 BC. This year is called year 1 in Sri Lanka and Burma, but year 0 in Thailand, Laos and Cambodia. Thus the year 2500 B.E. occurred in 1956 in the former countries, but in 1957 in the latter. In Thailand in 1888 King Chulalongkorn decreed a National Thai Era, dating from the founding of Bangkok on 6 April 1782. In 1912 New Year&#x27;s Day was shifted to 1 April. In 1941 Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram decided to count the years since 543 BC. This is the Thai solar calendar using the Thai Buddhist Era aligned to the western solar calendar.
*BE for Burmese Era – from Burmese calendar originally with an epochal year 0 date of 22 March 638; from which derived CS for Chula Sakarat era; variously known as LE Lesser Era; ME Minor Era – the Major or Great Era being the Saka Era of the Indian national calendar
:B.E. of the Bahá&#x27;í calendar is below.

===Bahá&#x27;í===
*B.E. – The Bahá&#x27;í calendar dates from the year of the declaration of the Báb. Years are counted in the Bahá&#x27;í Era (BE), which starts its year 1 from 21 March 1844.

===Jewish===
*A.M. (or AM) – for the Latin &quot;Anno Mundi&quot;, meaning &quot;in the year of the world&quot;, has its epoch in the year 3761 BC. This was first used to number the years of the modern Hebrew calendar in 1178 by Maimonides. Precursors with epochs one or two years later were used since the 3rd century, all based on the Seder Olam Rabba of the 2nd century. The year beginning in the northern autumn of 2000 was 5761 AM.

===Zoroastrian===
*The Zoroastrian calendar used regnal years since the reform by Ardeshir I, but after the fall of the Sassanid Empire, the ascension of the last Sassanid ruler, Yazdegerd III of Persia, crowned 16 June 632, continued to be used as the reference year, abbreviated Y.Z. or &quot;Yazdegerd era&quot;.

==Modern==
===Political===
*The Republican Era of the French Republican Calendar was dated from 22 September 1792, the day of the proclamation of the French First Republic. It was used in Revolutionary France from 24 October 1793 (on the Gregorian calendar) to 31 December 1805.
*The Positivist calendar of 1844 takes 1789 as its epoch.
*The Republican era is used by the Republic of China (now usually known as &quot;Taiwan&quot;) since 1912, which is the first year of the republic. Coincidentally, this is the same as the Juche era used in North Korea, the year of the birth of its founder Kim Il-Sung.
* The Era Fascista &#x27;Fascist Era&#x27; was instituted by the Italian Fascists and used Roman numerals to denote the number of years since the March on Rome in 1922. Therefore, 1934, for example, was XII E.F. (&quot;era fascista&quot;). This era was abolished with the fall of fascism in Italy on 25 July 1943, but restored in the northern part of the country during the Italian Social Republic. The Gregorian calendar remained in simultaneous use and a double numbering was adopted: the year of the Common era was presented in Arabic numerals and the year of the fascist era in Roman numerals. The year of the Fascist calendar began on 29 October, so, for example, 27 October 1933 was XI E.F. but 30 October 1933 was XII E.F.
*China traditionally reckoned by the regnal year of its emperors, see Chinese era name. Most Chinese do not assign numbers to the years of the Chinese calendar, but the few who do, like expatriate Chinese, use a continuous count of years from the reign of the legendary Yellow Emperor, using 2698 BC as year 1. Western writers begin this count at either 2637 BC or 2697 BC (see Chinese calendar). Thus, the Chinese years 4637, 4697, or 4698 began in early 2000.
*In Korea, from 1952 until 1961 years were numbered via &quot;Dangi&quot; years, where 2333 BC was regarded as the first such year.
*The Assyrian calendar, introduced in the 1950s, has its era fixed at 4750 BC.
*The Japanese calendar dates from the accession of the current Emperor of Japan. The current emperor took the throne in May 2019, which became Reiwa 1, and which was until then Heisei 31.
*The United States government sometimes uses a calendar of the era of its Independence, fixed on 4 July 1776, together with the &quot;Anno Domini&quot; civil calendar. For instance, its Constitution is dated &quot;the Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth.&quot; Presidential proclamations are also dated in this way.

===Religious===
* – &quot;After Dianetics&quot;. In Scientology, years are numbered relative to the first publication of the book &quot;&quot; (1950).
*Y.O.L.D. – In the Discordian calendar, the standard designation for the year number is YOLD (Year of Our Lady of Discord). The calendar begins counting from 1 January 1166 BC in the Discordian year 0, ostensibly the date of origin of the Curse of Greyface. An alternate designation, A.D.D. has been occasionally seen (Anno Domina Discordia, a Latin translation of YOLD, but presumably also a play on attention deficit disorder).
*e.v. – &quot;Era vulgaris&quot;. (From Latin, meaning &quot;common era&quot;, usually stylized in lowercase.) Used by some followers of Aleister Crowley to designate the era from the Thelemic calendar which is used by some Thelemites to designate a number of years since Crowley&#x27;s inauguration of the so-called Aeon of Horus, which occurred on 20 March 1904, and coincides with both the Thelemic new year and a holiday known as the Equinox of the Gods. The abbreviation &quot;A.N.&quot;, for &quot;Aerae Novae&quot; (&quot;New Era&quot; in Latin), is also used for dates in the Thelemic calendar.

===Practical===
*B.P. – for Before Present, specifically, the number of radiocarbon years before 1950.
*Julian day number – for counting days, not years, its era fixed at noon 1 January, 4713 BC in the proleptic Julian calendar. This equals 24 November, 4714 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. From noon of this day to noon of the next day was day 0. Multiples of 7 are Mondays. Negative values can also be used. Apart from the choice of the zero point and name, this Julian day and Julian date are not related to the Julian calendar. It does not count years, so, strictly speaking, it has no era, but it does have an epoch. Today (noon-to-noon UTC) the value is .
* Unix time – for counting elapsed seconds since the Unix epoch set at 00:00:00 or midnight UTC of 1 January 1970, though there are problems with Unix implementation of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
* Holocene calendar

A year later, he resigned as the chairman of the FTII, citing his work commitments for the American TV show &quot;New Amsterdam&quot;.

==Early life and background==
Anupam Kher was born on 7 March 1955 in Simla, in the Patiala and East Punjab States Union of India (now in Himachal Pradesh) into a Kashmiri Pandit family. His father, Pushkar Nath Kher was a clerk in the forest department of Himachal Pradesh and his mother, Dulari Kher was a housewife. He was educated at D. A. V. School in Shimla. He studied economics at Government College, Sanjauli at the Himachal Pradesh University in Shimla, but dropped out to study Indian theatre at Panjab University, Chandigarh.

In 1978, Kher graduated from the National School of Drama (NSD) in New Delhi. Some of his early roles were in plays performed at the Himachal Pradesh University. He taught drama in Raj Bisaria&#x27;s Bharatendu Natya Akademi in Lucknow for a small part in his directorial debut movie &quot;Sheeshay ka Ghar&quot;. In his struggling days as an actor in Bombay (present-day Mumbai), he slept on a railway platform for a month.

==Acting career==
===Debut and early career (1984–1988)===

Anupam Kher made his acting debut in 1984 with Mahesh Bhatt&#x27;s drama film &quot;Saaransh&quot;. It didn&#x27;t performed well commercially, but was a huge critical success and was chosen as India&#x27;s official entry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Kher received widespread acclaim for his portraying a 60-year-old man trying to come to terms with the loss of his only son and won his first and only Filmfare Award for Best Actor. The following year, however, none of his films performed well critically or commercially with Rahul Rawail&#x27;s action drama &quot;Arjun&quot; co-starring Sunny Deol and Dimple Kapadia being the exception. This changed in 1986 when he co-starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan in K. Bhagyaraj&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Aakhree Raasta&quot; and played the ruthless villain &quot;Dr. Michael Dang&quot; in Subhash Ghai&#x27;s ensemble actioner &quot;Karma&quot;, which had Dilip Kumar, Jackie Shroff, Anil Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah and Sridevi in the lead. While the former was a hit, &quot;Karma&quot; went on to become a blockbuster and Kher got noticed by the audience. The same year, he played supporting role in another major commercial success, which was - &quot;Insaaf Ki Awaaz&quot;.

In 1987, he appeared alongside Rekha and Raj Babbar in T. Rama Rao&#x27;s family drama &quot;Sansar&quot;, which was a commercially successful venture. In 1988, he played negative roles in films, such as &quot;Hatya&quot;, &quot;Zakhmi Aurat&quot; and &quot;Tezaab&quot;. Out of these releases, &quot;Hatya&quot; and &quot;Zakhmi Aurat&quot; were semi-hits, while the lattermost went many steps ahead and emerged a blockbuster as well as the highest earning film of that year. Kher&#x27;s other notable release of 1988, &quot;Vijay&quot; failed at the box office, but won him his first and only Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor.

===Breakthrough, public recognition and awards success (1989–2001)===

After many years of lukewarm critical and commercial success, Kher became a household name in 1989 when he starred in Subhash Ghai&#x27;s masala film &quot;Ram Lakhan&quot;, Rajiv Rai&#x27;s action drama &quot;Tridev&quot;, Yash Chopra&#x27;s romantic musical &quot;Chandni&quot;, Vidhu Vinod Chopra&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Parinda&quot; and Pankaj Parashar&#x27;s comedy drama &quot;ChaalBaaz&quot;. All the films proved to be critically and commercially successful, especially &quot;Ram Lakhan&quot;, &quot;Tridev&quot; and &quot;Chandni&quot;, all three of which backed up with chartbuster music, emerged blockbusters at the box office and were among the top five highest-grossing films of the year. Apart from commercial projects, Kher also collaborated with Mahesh Bhatt for the art-house television film &quot;Daddy&quot;, which like their previous collaboration &quot;Saaransh&quot; met with immense acclaim and won Kher his first National Film Award – Special Jury Award as well as Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Critics). The following year, he starred in Indra Kumar&#x27;s blockbuster romantic comedy &quot;Dil&quot;, which had Aamir Khan and Madhuri Dixit in the lead roles. For his performance of a greedy father in &quot;Dil&quot;, Kher received his third nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor category. In 1991, he appeared in highly successful films, including &quot;Saudagar&quot;, &quot;Saathi&quot;, &quot;Hum&quot; and &quot;Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin&quot;. He also collaborated with Yash Chopra for the romantic drama &quot;Lamhe&quot;, which was a commercial failure, but received positive reception from critics and is now considered a cult classic. Kher&#x27;s performances in &quot;Saudagar&quot; and &quot;Lamhe&quot; earned him nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor category.

His other box office hits of this period, include &quot;Beta&quot; (1992), &quot;Shola Aur Shabnam&quot; (1992), &quot;Lootere&quot; (1993), &quot;Waqt Hamara Hai&quot; (1993), &quot;Khalnayak&quot; (1993), &quot;Hum Hain Kamaal Ke&quot; (1993), &quot;Gumrah&quot; (1993) and &quot;Darr&quot; (1993). He then appeared in Sooraj Barjatya&#x27;s &quot;Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!&quot; (1994) and Aditya Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; (1995). Both the films did extremely well at the box office and emerged &quot;All Time Blockbusters&quot; as well as the 1st and 2nd highest-grossing film of all time, respectively. For his performance in the former, Kher received another nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor category. In the late-1990s, he continued to play supporting roles in critically and commercially successful ventures, such as &quot;Judwaa&quot; (1997), &quot;Ziddi&quot; (1997), &quot;Deewana Mastana&quot; (1997), &quot;Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai&quot; (1998), &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; (1998), &quot;Bade Miyan Chote Miyan&quot; (1998), &quot;China Gate&quot; (1998), &quot;Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain&quot; (1999) and &quot;Haseena Maan Jaayegi&quot; (1999).

Kher began the new decade playing antagonist in Rakesh Roshan&#x27;s romantic blockbuster &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot; which made Hrithik Roshan a star. He followed it with four more major successes the same year with &quot;Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge&quot;, &quot;Kya Kehna&quot;, &quot;Hamara Dil Aapke Paas Hai&quot; and &quot;Mohabbatein&quot;. In 2001, he had another hit in &quot;Jodi No.1&quot; and received praise for his performance in &quot;Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein&quot;, which didn&#x27;t do well commercially, but went on to attain cult status in later years.

===Expansion to Hollywood, further acclaim and work in regional industries (2002–present)===

In 2002, Kher starred in his first Hollywood project which was Gurinder Chadha&#x27;s sports comedy drama &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot;. The film proved to be a critical and commercial success grossing around $76.6 million worldwide.
After gap of an year, he again reunited with Chadha for &quot;Bride and Prejudice&quot;, which too was a successful venture. His final collaboration with Chadha took place in 2005 with &quot;The Mistress of Spices&quot;, which like their previous ventures was panned by critics and didn&#x27;t do well at the box office.

During this period, Kher continued to star in highly successful Hindi films, such as &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; (2004), &quot;Kyaa Kool Hain Hum&quot; (2005) and received immense acclaim and his second National Film Award – Special Jury Award for the 2005 film &quot;Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara&quot; (which he also produced).

==Other works==
Kher ventured into directing with &quot;Om Jai Jagadish&quot; (2002) and has been a producer. He produced and starred in the film &quot;Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara&quot; (2005). From October 2003 to October 2004, he served as chairman of the Indian Film Censor Board.

In 2011 Kher released his first book &quot;The Best Thing About You is You!&quot;, which was a best-seller. His biography &quot;Lessons Life Taught Me Unknowingly&quot; was published on 5 August 2019 by Penguin Random House. In 2020, he wrote &quot;Your Best Day Is Today!&quot;, based on his experiences of the COVID-19 crisis. Remembering his father on his 9th death anniversary, he presented a poem written by Lucknow-based Poet Pankaj Prasun and posted it on social media.

Kher hosted TV shows such as &quot;Say Na Something To Anupam Uncle&quot;, &quot;Sawaal Dus Crore Ka&quot; and &quot;Lead India&quot;. In 2014, Kher has written and starred in a play about his own life called &quot;Kucch Bhi Ho Sakta Hai&quot;, which was directed by Feroz Abbas Khan. In 2016, Anupam Kher was a narrator in the ABP News documentary TV series &quot;Bharatvarsh&quot;, which showcased the journey from ancient India to the 19th century. In late 2016, Anupam Kher produced &quot;Khwaabon Ki Zamin Par&quot;, a TV drama airing on Zindagi.

Starting in fall of 2018, Anupam Kher starred in NBC medical drama TV series &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; as Dr. Vijay Kapoor (a neurologist). He also appeared as Shahbaz Karim in the BBC1 drama &quot;Mrs Wilson&quot;. Kher is the founder of Actor Prepares, an acting institute based in Mumbai.

==Personal life==
Kher married actress Madhumati Kapoor in 1979, but divorced after a few years. In 1985, he married actress Kirron Kher who is a Member of Parliament from Chandigarh, belonging to the BJP. Her son, his stepson, is actor Sikandar Kher. In 2010, he was appointed as the goodwill ambassador of the Pratham Education Foundation, which strives to improve children&#x27;s education in India. Kher is an ardent supporter of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi.

On 20 September 2021, Kher was awarded an honorary doctorate degree in Philosophy of Hindu Studies by the Hindu University of America.

<text>Kashubia or Cassubia ( or ; ; or ) is an ethnocultural region in the historic Eastern Pomerania (Pomerelia) region of northern Poland.

The unofficial self-description of &quot;capital city of Kashubia&quot; has long been contested by Kartuzy and Kościerzyna.

==Location and geography==

Located west of Gdańsk (inclusive of all but the easternmost district) and the mouth of the Vistula river, it is inhabited by members of the Kashubian ethnic group. The region is home to the Kashubian Lake District. According to the 1999 basic study &quot;Geografia współczesnych Kaszub&quot; (Geography of present-day Kashubia) by the Gdańsk scholar Jan Mordawski 43 municipalities (&quot;gminas&quot;) of the Pomeranian Voivodeship have a Kashubian share of at least one third of the total population:

* Puck County (&quot;Pùcczi kréz&quot;): Town of Puck (&quot;Pùck&quot;) with Gmina Puck, towns of Hel (&quot;Hél&quot;), Jastarnia (&quot;Jastarniô&quot;) and Władysławowo (&quot;Wiôlgô Wies&quot;), Gmina Kosakowo (&quot;Kòsôkòwò&quot;), Gmina Krokowa (&quot;Krokòwa&quot;)
* Wejherowo County (&quot;Wejrowsczi kréz&quot;): Town of Wejherowo (&quot;Wejrowò&quot;) and Gmina Wejherowo, towns of Reda (&quot;Réda&quot;) and Rumia (&quot;Rëmiô&quot;), Gmina Choczewo (&quot;Chòczewò&quot;), Gmina Gniewino (&quot;Gniewino&quot;), Gmina Linia (&quot;Lëniô&quot;), Gmina Luzino (&quot;Lëzëno&quot;), Gmina Łęczyce (&quot;Łãczëce&quot;), Gmina Szemud (&quot;Szëmôłd&quot;)

== Culture ==
=== Kashubian emblem and flag ===
Although there are no legal regulations regarding the use of Kashubian symbols, the griffin, i.e. a mythical animal, derived from antiquity, is considered the emblem and symbol of the Kashubians. The Kashubian griffin is in black on a yellow background (optionally golden). The colors of the Kashubian flag are taken from the emblem - the upper color is black, and the lower one is yellow (golden). A Kashubian flag with a griffin in the center is also used. If there is an emblem on the flag, then the background is yellow.

=== Embroidery ===
Embroidery is an important part of Kashubian culture which uses seven colours; three shades of blue representing the sky, the lakes and Baltic Sea, green representing the meadows and forests, yellow representing the sun, red representing the peoples&#x27; love for the region, and the black representing the hard work of the Kashubians. Its origins date back to the early 13th century.

=== Cuisine ===
Kashubian cuisine is mostly based on fish and meat. Grain is also widely used within Kashubian dishes. Herring are the most widely used fish due to their high numbers in the region. Mushrooms are also a part of Kashubia&#x27;s wide variety of dishes.

=== Music ===
Kashubia has a wide variety of music; Zemia Rodnô is widely considered to be the anthem of Kashubia. The most recognised Kashubian song is &quot;Kaszëbsczé nótë&quot;, a traditional song that is the most recognisable part of Kashubian folklore. Dances are also a noticeable part of Kashubian culture, which are moderately energetic, except for a few. The most famous dance is the &quot;Kòséder&quot;.

=== Language ===

The Kashubian language is a West Slavic language belonging to the Lechitic subgroup. It was historically considered a dialect of Polish, but is now officially recognized as a regional language and enjoys legal protection as such. In a 2011 census, over 108,000 people in Poland declared that they mainly use Kashubian at home.

=== Religion ===

The population of the region, like the majority of Poland, is predominantly Catholic. Important regional Catholic sites include the Wejherowo Calvary in Wejherowo, and the Church of the Assumption within the former Carthusian monastery in Kartuzy.

=== Sports ===
The ethnolinguistic identity of Kashubia is often reflected in the names of the region&#x27;s sports associations such as Cassubian Bolszewo, Kaszubia Kościerzyna, Kaszuby Połchowo, Kaszubia Starzyno, Kaszubia Studzienice, and the football team Nörda Karwia which incorporates the Kashubian language into its club name.

Supporters of the football club Arka Gdynia regularly express their Kashubian identity with the chant &quot;Arka Gdynia Kaszëbë!&quot; In 2010, during the Tricity Derby at the MOSiR stadium, ultras of Arka Gdynia unveiled a new banner displaying the moniker &quot;Kaszëbë&quot;, which was to become one of the fans most recognisable banners. The club has since capitalised on the Kashubian identity of its fanbase. On the occasion of Kashubian Unity Day in 2023 the team played in the colours of the Kashubian flag with a kit incorporating the Kashubian language and patterns inspired by traditional Kashubian embroidery.

<text>The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) is the IETF&#x27;s standard for cryptographically protected messages. It can be used by cryptographic schemes and protocols to digitally sign, digest, authenticate or encrypt any form of digital data.

CMS is based on the syntax of PKCS #7, which in turn is based on the Privacy-Enhanced Mail standard. The newest version of CMS () is specified in (but also see for updated ASN.1 modules conforming to ASN.1 2002 and and for updates to the standard).

The architecture of CMS is built around certificate-based key management, such as the profile defined by the PKIX working group. CMS is used as the key cryptographic component of many other cryptographic standards, such as S/MIME, PKCS #12 and the digital timestamping protocol.

OpenSSL is open source software that can encrypt, decrypt, sign and verify, compress and uncompress CMS documents, using the codice_1 command.

<doc id="442964" wikidata="Q123206" url="?curid=442964" title="Bruno Ganz">
<text>Bruno Ganz (; 22 March 1941 – 16 February 2019) was a Swiss actor whose career in German stage, television and film productions spanned nearly 60 years. He was known for his collaborations with the directors Werner Herzog, Éric Rohmer, Francis Ford Coppola, Theo Angelopoulos and Wim Wenders, earning widespread recognition with his roles as Jonathan Zimmerman in &quot;The American Friend&quot; (1977), Jonathan Harker in &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot; (1979) and Damiel the Angel in &quot;Wings of Desire&quot; (1987).

Ganz received renewed international acclaim for his portrayal of Adolf Hitler in the Oscar-nominated film &quot;Downfall&quot; (2004). He also had roles in several English-language films, including &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; (1978), &quot;Strapless&quot; (1989), &quot;The Last Days of Chez Nous&quot; (1992), &quot;Luther&quot; (2003), &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (2004), &quot;The Reader&quot; (2008), &quot;Unknown&quot; (2011), &quot;The Counselor&quot; (2013) and &quot;Remember&quot; (2015). On stage, Ganz portrayed Dr. Heinrich Faust in Peter Stein&#x27;s staging of &quot;Faust, Part One&quot; and &quot;Faust, Part Two&quot; in 2000.

==Early life==
Ganz was born on 22 March 1941 in Zürich to a Swiss-German factory worker father and a northern Italian mother. He had decided to pursue an acting career by the time he entered university. He was equally drawn to stage and screen but initially enjoyed greater success on the stage.

==Career==
===Stage career===
Ganz made his theatrical debut in 1961 and devoted himself mainly to the stage for almost the next two decades. In 1970, he helped found the &quot;Berliner Schaubühne&quot; ensemble and two years later performed in the Salzburg Festival premiere of Thomas Bernhard&#x27;s &quot;Der Ignorant und der Wahnsinnige&quot;, under the direction of .
The German magazine &quot;Theater heute&quot; solidified Ganz&#x27;s reputation as a stage actor by pronouncing him &quot;Schauspieler des Jahres&quot; (Actor of the Year) in 1973. One of Ganz&#x27;s most physically demanding stage portrayals was the title character in Peter Stein&#x27;s 2000 production of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; (Parts I and II); he suffered injuries during rehearsals which delayed his starting in the role. He also served as a speaker in classical music works, including a 1993 recording of Luigi Nono&#x27;s &quot;Il canto sospeso&quot; with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.

===Film career===
In 1960 Ganz landed his first film role, in &quot;Der Herr mit der schwarzen Melone&quot; (&quot;The Man in the Black Derby&quot;). Despite the support of lead actor Gustav Knuth, Ganz&#x27;s cinematic debut was not particularly successful and it was only many years later that his career in film got off the ground.

Ganz made his film breakthrough in a major part in the 1976 film &quot;&quot;, launching a widely recognized film career in Europe and the United States. He worked with several directors of the New German Cinema such as Werner Herzog and Wim Wenders, and also with international directors like Éric Rohmer and Francis Ford Coppola, among others. In 1977, he co-starred with Dennis Hopper in Wenders&#x27; &quot;American Friend&quot;, an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s novel &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Game&quot;, playing a terminally ill father who gets hired as a professional killer. In 1979, he starred opposite Klaus Kinski in Herzog&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (&quot;Nosferatu: Phantom of the Night&quot;). Ganz played a professor opposite Sir Laurence Olivier in the thriller &quot;The Boys from Brazil&quot; (1978), about Nazi fugitives.

In 1987 Ganz first played the role of the angel Damiel in Wim Wenders&#x27;s &quot;Wings of Desire&quot;. He reprised the role in &quot;Faraway, So Close!&quot; in 1993. Ganz appeared in &quot;The Reader&quot; as a Holocaust survivor and as police officer Horst Herold in &quot;The Baader Meinhof Complex&quot;, which were both nominated for the 81st Academy Awards (Best Picture and Best Foreign Language Film respectively). In 2003, he portrayed Johann von Staupitz in &quot;Luther&quot;. In 2011, he appeared as a former Stasi operator opposite Liam Neeson in &quot;Unknown&quot;. Among Ganz&#x27;s later roles were the grandfather in the literary adaptation &quot;Heidi&quot; (2015), a pseudo-scientific healer in Sally Potter&#x27;s &quot;The Party&quot; (2017) and ancient Roman poet Virgil in Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;The House that Jack Built&quot; (2018).
Ganz portrayed Adolf Hitler in &quot;Der Untergang&quot; (&quot;Downfall&quot;) (2004) after four months of researching the role. His performance was widely acclaimed by critics; &quot;The Guardian&quot; critic Rob Mackie described Ganz as &quot;the most convincing screen Hitler yet: an old, bent, sick dictator with the shaking hands of someone with Parkinson&#x27;s, alternating between rage and despair in his last days in the bunker&quot;. His performance has inspired many parodies on YouTube, using video and audio from the film with humorous subtitles.

==Personal life and death==
Ganz was married to Sabine from 1965 until his death, although they were separated for a long time; their son, Daniel, was born in 1972.

In February 2018, doctors in Salzburg found that Ganz was suffering from intestinal cancer, and he immediately began chemotherapy.

Ganz died on 16 February 2019 at his home in the village of Au, in Wädenswil, Switzerland, at the age of 77, a month shy of his 78th birthday. He was attended by his partner, the theatrical photographer , and his son Daniel.

From 1996 until his death in 2019, Ganz held the 200 year old Iffland-Ring, which passes from actor to actor—each bequeathing the ring to the next holder, judging that actor to be the &quot;most significant and most worthy actor of the German-speaking theatre&quot;. Ganz was also honored with the Order of Merit of Germany and was made a knight of the French &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;.

<text>Peljidiin Genden (; 1892 or 1895 – November 26, 1937) was a Mongolian politician and statesman who served as the first president of Mongolia from 1924 to 1927, and the ninth prime minister of the country from 1932 to 1936. 

As one of three MPRP secretaries, Genden was responsible for the swift compulsory implementation of socialist economic policies in the early 1930s. In 1932, he was granted Joseph Stalin&#x27;s support to become prime minister, but then increasingly resisted pressure from Moscow to liquidate institutional Buddhism and permit increased Soviet influence in Mongolia. His independent temperament, outspokenness (he became famous for fearlessly confronting Stalin during their public meetings in Moscow and was one of the few to stand up to Stalin&#x27;s strong personality), and growing nationalist sentiments ultimately led to his Soviet-orchestrated purge in March 1936. Accused of conspiring against the revolution and spying for the Japanese, he was executed in Moscow on November 26, 1937.

==Early life and career==

Peljidiin Genden was born in present-day Khujirt district of Övörkhangai Province in either 1892 or 1895 (sources differ). In 1922, he joined the Mongolian Revolutionary Youth League (MRYL), and a year later he was appointed acting head of his local cell. He attended the first session of the Mongolian Great Khural in Ulaanbaatar in November 1924 as a delegate from Övörkhangai. There, Prime Minister Balingiin Tserendorj took notice of his outspokenness and based on his recommendation Genden was elected chairman of the Presidium of the State Small Khural or &quot;Baga Khural&quot;, the small assembly that controlled day-to-day matters of state. This made him the effective head of state of Mongolia, a position he would hold from November 29, 1924, to November 15, 1927, and served concurrently as the chairman of the Central Bureau of Mongolia&#x27;s Trade Unions.

===Leftist Deviation===

Genden served as one of three secretaries of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party&#x27;s Central Committee from December 11, 1928, to June 30, 1932. Together with fellow secretaries Ölziin Badrakh and Bat-Ochiryn Eldev-Ochir (and later Zolbingiin Shijee), Genden urged for swift compulsory implementation of socialist economic policies such as forced collectivization, bans on private enterprise, the closure of monasteries and the forfeiture of their property. The policy proved disastrous as traditional herders were forced off the steppe and into badly managed collective farms, destroying one third of Mongolian livestock. Over 800 properties belonging to Mongolian nobles and Buddhist monasteries were confiscated and the heads of over 700 noble households were executed. As a result, open revolt broke out in several provinces between 1930 and 1932. In response, Moscow ordered the suspension of what it termed the &quot;Leftist Deviation&quot; policies of the Mongolian government and in May 1932 several party leaders (including Badrah, Shijee, and Prime Minister Tsengeltiin Jigjidjav) were purged for trying to implement socialist measures &quot;prematurely&quot;.

==Prime minister==

Genden deftly survived the purge by meeting with Joseph Stalin in 1932 and winning over the Soviet leader. Through Moscow&#x27;s support, Genden was named Chairman of the Assembly of People&#x27;s Commissaries on July 2, 1932, replacing the purged Jigjidjav. Genden was placed in charge of the implementation of Mongolia&#x27;s &quot;New Turn&quot; or &quot;New Reform&quot; economic plan. The nation&#x27;s new economic model was considered an easing of more strict communist economic principles. The plan was closely modeled on Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s 1921 Soviet New Economic Policy. This new policy in Mongolia included a reduction in taxes as well as lessened restrictions on private businesses and religious institutions. Genden&#x27;s popularity increased as Mongolia&#x27;s economy was strengthening and shortages were being reduced. For the first time since the revolution the government was in a more dominant position vis-à-vis the MPRP.

===The Lkhümbe Affair===

In 1933, a personal feud between two party functionaries led to trumped up accusations of widespread conspiring within the party with Japanese spies, especially among Buryats. Several of those arrested and interrogated by Soviet agents in Ulaanbaatar fingered Jambyn Lkhümbe, then secretary of the MPRP Central Committee, as their leader. Genden, party leader Eldev-Ochir, and Security Directorate Chief D. Namsrai backed the subsequent investigation that saw several hundred innocent persons, including Lkhümbe, arrested. 56 were eventually executed (including pregnant women), 260 were jailed for three to ten years and 126 were sent to the USSR. The vast majority of those persecuted were Buryats. Public opinion at the time held that Genden and D. Namsrai, head of the Internal Affairs Committee, had initiated the affair to purge political enemies, but there is evidence that the affair was driven in large part by Soviet agents looking to weaken the Buryat population in Mongolia.

===Resisting Stalin===

Ties between Stalin and Genden began to fray as early as 1934 when, at a meeting with Genden in Moscow, Stalin urged him to destroy Mongolia&#x27;s Buddhist clergies. He told the Mongolian leader to exterminate more than 100,000 of his nation&#x27;s lamas, whom Stalin called &quot;the enemies within&quot;. Genden, a staunch Buddhist, was once quoted as saying &quot;On earth there are two great geniuses – Buddha and Lenin.&quot; In 1933, Genden stated his intention to &quot;not to fight against religion&quot; and allowed Mongolian lamas to practice their religion in public, directly challenging Stalin&#x27;s orders.

Suspicious of growing Soviet domination in Mongolia, Genden actively postponed both a 1934 bilateral gentlemen&#x27;s agreement, in which the USSR promised to protect Mongolia from potential invasion, as well as the 1936 &quot;Mutual Assistance Pact&quot; that allowed for the stationing of Soviet troops in Mongolia. Genden hoped to stave off Soviet domination by exploiting the diplomatic strain between the USSR and Japan to Mongolia&#x27;s benefit, but the policy would later prove to be his undoing as accusations surfaced in 1936 that he was working on the side of the Japanese. Genden likewise hesitated on Stalin&#x27;s recommendations that he elevate Mongolia&#x27;s internal affairs committee to a fully independent ministry and that he increase the size of Mongolia&#x27;s military.

In December 1935, Genden traveled again to Moscow, where Stalin dismissed his requests for economic assistance, and again rebuked him for not following instructions. Genden became argumentative after this meeting, and later started a fight with Stalin while heavily intoxicated during a reception at the Mongolian Embassy. Stalin allegedly said &quot;Genden, apparently you want to become Mongolia&#x27;s king, don&#x27;t you?&quot; and Genden responded &quot;You bloody Georgian, you have become a virtual Russian Czar&quot;. Genden then slapped Stalin and broke his pipe according to some witnesses. Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav, Genden&#x27;s political opponent, alleged that Genden &quot;broke tables and chairs&quot; and &quot;even suggested that an alliance with Japan was possible&quot;. Genden later attempted to defend himself over the incident in his final public statement: &quot;Stalin is a powerful man. I also possess power to represent Mongolia. This is why I am entitled to say what I think... I am being criticized for having gotten drunk and having had a squabble with Stalin. This has nothing to do [with] the Mongolian-Soviet relations. When people get drunk, anything can happen; they become unreasonable. You say that I am uneducated. It is true, I am uneducated. A person like that does not know what he is doing.&quot;

===Purged===

Upon Genden&#x27;s return to Mongolia, Khorloogiin Choibalsan, acting under orders from Stalin, organized the second plenary meeting of Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolutionary Party in March 1936 in Ulaanbaatar to permanently remove Genden from office. Party members led by Luvsansharav reprimanded Genden for his actions in Moscow and accused him of sabotaging relations with the Soviet Union. He was subsequently removed from his offices of both the prime minister and the foreign minister and then placed under strict house arrest. Anandyn Amar was appointed as the prime minister for the second time in Genden&#x27;s place. With the purge of Genden, Choibalsan became Stalin&#x27;s favored official in Ulaanbaatar and was named head of the new Internal Affairs Ministry, effectively making him the most powerful person in Mongolia.

==Death==

Genden was &quot;invited&quot; to the USSR, ostensibly for medical care, in April 1936. He then spent one year at the resort town of Foros on the Black Sea. In summer 1937, he was arrested during Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge and under interrogation admitted to plotting with &quot;lamaist reactionaries&quot; and &quot;Japanese spies.&quot; By order from the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR, Genden was executed in Moscow on November 26, 1937, for &quot;his attempt to undertake a political coup and being a spy of Japan.&quot;

==Rehabilitation==

Genden was declared a nonperson in Mongolia; however, he would be rehabilitated in 1956 by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, nearly two decades after his death. Genden&#x27;s actions and history remained obscured in Mongolia until the country&#x27;s democratic revolution in 1990.

His daughter Tserendulam opened the Memorial Museum for Victims of Political Repression in his former residence in 1996. It offered information on the victims of the political prosecutions, which according to some estimates affected up to 14% of the population. The structure was demolished in 2019.

<text>The fundamental theorems of asset pricing (also: of arbitrage, of finance), in both financial economics and mathematical finance, provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a market to be arbitrage-free, and for a market to be complete. An arbitrage opportunity is a way of making money with no initial investment without any possibility of loss. Though arbitrage opportunities do exist briefly in real life, it has been said that any sensible market model must avoid this type of profit. The first theorem is important in that it ensures a fundamental property of market models. Completeness is a common property of market models (for instance the Black–Scholes model). A complete market is one in which every contingent claim can be replicated. Though this property is common in models, it is not always considered desirable or realistic.

==Discrete markets==
In a discrete (i.e. finite state) market, the following hold:
#The First Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing: A discrete market on a discrete probability space formula_1 is arbitrage-free if, and only if, there exists at least one risk neutral probability measure that is equivalent to the original probability measure, &quot;P&quot;.
#The Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing: An arbitrage-free market (S,B) consisting of a collection of stocks &quot;S&quot; and a risk-free bond &quot;B&quot; is complete if and only if there exists a unique risk-neutral measure that is equivalent to &quot;P&quot; and has numeraire &quot;B&quot;.

==In more general markets==

When stock price returns follow a single Brownian motion, there is a unique risk neutral measure. When the stock price process is assumed to follow a more general sigma-martingale or semimartingale, then the concept of arbitrage is too narrow, and a stronger concept such as no free lunch with vanishing risk (NFLVR) must be used to describe these opportunities in an infinite dimensional setting.

In continuous time, a version of the fundamental theorems of asset pricing reads:

Let formula_2 be a d-dimensional semimartingale market (a collection of stocks), formula_3 the risk-free bond and formula_1 the underlying probability space. Furthermore, we call a measure formula_5 an equivalent local martingale measure if formula_6 and if the processes formula_7 are local martingales under the measure formula_5.

# The First Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing: Assume formula_9 is locally bounded. Then the market formula_9 satisfies NFLVR if and only if there exists an equivalent local martingale measure.
# The Second Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing: Assume that there exists an equivalent local martingale measure formula_5. Then formula_9 is a complete market if and only if formula_5 is the unique local martingale measure.

<text>The Iguazu River ( , ), also called Rio Iguassu, (from the Guaraní &quot;í Guazú&quot;, literally &quot;Big Water&quot;) is a river in Brazil and Argentina. It is an important tributary of the Paraná River. The Iguazu River is long, with a drainage basin of .

==Course==

The Iguazu originates in the Serra do Mar coastal mountains of the Brazilian state of Paraná and close to Curitiba.
For , to its confluence with the San Antonio River, the Iguazu flows west through Paraná State, Brazil. Downriver from the confluence, the Iguazu River forms the boundary between Brazil and Argentina&#x27;s Misiones Province. Continuing west, the river drops off a plateau, forming Iguazu Falls, which are accessible via the Rainforest Ecological Train. The falls are within national parks in both Brazil, Iguaçu National Park, and Argentina, Iguazú National Park. It empties into the Paraná River at the point where the borders of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay join, an area known as the Triple Frontier.

==Ecology==
Unlike tropical South American rivers, where the annual variations in temperature are relatively limited, the water in the subtropical Iguazu River varies significantly depending on season. At two sites, one located just above and another just below the falls, the water at both varied from about , and average was just below . The pH is typically near-neutral, ranging from 5.9 to 8.7.

About 100 fish species are native to the Iguazu River, and several undescribed species are known. Most fish species in the river are catfish, characiforms and cichlids. About 70% are endemic, which to a large extent is linked to the falls, serving both as a home for rheophilic species and isolating species above and below. This also means that, except for the threatened &quot;Steindachneridion melanodermatum&quot; in the lower part, large migratory fish known from much of the Paraná River Basin are naturally absent from Iguazu. Almost 30 introduced species are found in the river where about one-third originate from other continents (such as carp, largemouth bass, tilapia and African sharptooth catfish) and the remaining from elsewhere in South America (such as dorado, &quot;Cichla kelberi&quot;, pacu, &quot;Brycon hilarii&quot;, &quot;Prochilodus lineatus&quot; and &quot;Odontesthes bonariensis&quot;).

The unusual &quot;Aegla&quot; crustacean are locally common in the Iguazu River Basin.

==Environmental issues==
In July 2000 more than of crude oil spilled into the river from a state-run oil refinery in the municipality of Araucária near Curitiba.

<doc id="442991" wikidata="Q2603401" url="?curid=442991" title="The Painted Bird">
<text>The Painted Bird is a 1965 novel by Jerzy Kosiński that describes World War II as seen by a boy, considered a &quot;Gypsy or Jewish stray,&quot; wandering about small villages scattered around an unspecified country in Central or Eastern Europe (usually assumed to be Poland).

The story was originally described by Kosiński as autobiographical, but upon its publication by Houghton Mifflin he announced that it was a purely fictional account, although it was generally assumed that it was based on the author&#x27;s experiences during World War II. The depicted events are now widely known to be fictional, having been the subject of a 1993 journalistic exposé (&quot;The Ugly Black Bird&quot;). The book was for many years regarded as an essential part of the literary Holocaust canon; since proven to be a work of fiction, it has lost much of its popularity.

The book describes the wandering boy&#x27;s encounters with peasants engaged in all forms of sexual and social deviance such as incest, bestiality, and rape, and in other forms of extreme violence and lust. The book&#x27;s title was drawn from an incident in the story. The boy, while in the company of a professional bird catcher, observes how the man took one of his captured birds and painted it several colors. Then he released the bird to fly in search of a flock of its kin, but when the painted bird came upon the flock, they saw it as an intruder and viciously attacked the bird until it fell from the sky.

==Plot summary==

In 1939, at the beginning of World War II, a six-year-old boy living in the largest city of an Eastern European country invaded by Nazi Germany is sent by his parents to hide in the countryside because of their past anti-Nazi activities. However, they lose contact with him because of the chaos of the war and he is left stranded. As a result of his black hair and olive skin he is constantly accused of being either a Jew or a Gypsy, although Kosiński&#x27;s narrator denies this. He also has trouble understanding the local languages and dialects of the peasants he encounters. His first caretaker is a superstitious and unhygienic old woman named Marta, who refuses to allow him to look into her eyes because she is worried his &quot;Gypsy eye&quot; will curse her. Marta eventually becomes ill and dies, and the boy accidentally burns down her hut after spilling kerosene on it. Left to fend for himself, he wanders alone from village to village seeking shelter and food from adults in exchange for work. The boy endures various kinds of violence and cruelty, sometimes hounded and tortured, only rarely sheltered and cared for. 

He is saved from an angry mob of villagers by Olga, an elderly folk healer, who takes him under her wing. Although she openly distrusts the boy because of his appearance, she gains his admiration for her cures. After he becomes infected with a local epidemic, she buries him up to his head in dirt and he is attacked by birds but recovers. However, he is caught by the villagers again and thrown onto a large catfish&#x27;s air bladder, which floats him down the river away from the village. 

He is then taken in by a miller and his wife, who frequently exposes herself to a young plowboy. After the miller beats his wife for her alleged infidelity one night, he invites the plowboy over for dinner and gouges out his eyes. The boy runs away again and seeks shelter with Lekh, a professional bird catcher in love with Stupid Ludmila, a promiscuous and scantily-clad woman who lives in the woods alone with a large dog after suffering a mental breakdown from a gang rape. After Stupid Ludmila does not return to Lekh for several days, he becomes enraged and starts killing random birds by painting them different colors and setting them loose to be killed by their own flocks. After Lekh leaves to search for her, Stupid Ludmila returns and attempts to molest the boy. They are found by the villagers and she is raped by all of the local men and beaten to death by their jealous wives. The boy leaves as Lekh inconsolably cradles her body.

From here, he journeys to another village where a local carpenter takes care of him, but during a storm he becomes worried that the boy&#x27;s black hair will attract lightning and chains him to a cart in the field. The boy escapes and flees into a forest by stowing away on a train, finding an abandoned pillbox infested with rabid rats. However, the boy accidentally returns to the old village and the carpenter, blaming him after his barn was hit by lightning and burnt down, captures him and prepares to drown him before the boy pleads to spare his life in exchange for showing him the pillbox, which he lies is filled with military supplies. When they reach the pillbox, the boy accidentally pushes the carpenter into the pillbox and he is eaten alive by the rats.

The boy next stays with a kindly and well-respected blacksmith in a village with constant skirmishes and reprisals by rival bands of partisans and the Wehrmacht. The smith and his family are beaten and killed by nationalist partisans, who decide to turn him over to a German outpost as a goodwill gesture. He is taken to the woods by an old German soldier, who sets him free and pretends to execute him.

He escapes and travels to another village next to a German military railway, where the villagers discover Jews and Gypsies being deported to a nearby concentration camp. The villagers approve of this turn of events, seeing it as retribution for the crucifixion of Jesus. One day, a young widower named Rainbow captures an injured Jewish girl who managed to escape from the train. The villagers resolve to hand her over to the Germans the next day. As the boy watches through a knothole that night, Rainbow rapes the girl and they become stuck together, with a local healer killing the girl. 

After German patrols intensify, the boy is forced to leave the village to avoid giving away the location of a Jew in hiding. He is captured by German soldiers and taken to a larger town where he is harassed by a mob before an SS officer hands him over to a Catholic parish priest. The priest treats the boy kindly, but the farmer Garbos and his dog Judas constantly beat and abuse him. After hearing the priest explain prayer and indulgences, the boy asks him to teach him how to pray so that he can accrue enough indulgences to save himself. After the priest dies, Garbos starts torturing the boy by hanging him from the ceiling above Judas, and the boy begins praying more. On the Feast of Corpus Christi, the priest makes him an altar boy, but he nervously botches the Mass and knocks over a missal. The angered congregation accuses him of being a vampire and attempt to drown him in a cesspit. Although he survives, he becomes mute. 

In the forest he is caught by the local boys and given to the farmer Makar, whose family was ostracized by the village. Makar&#x27;s 19-year-old daughter Ewka begins furtively having sex with the boy, which he enjoys. After the boy is unable to kill a rabbit, Makar beats and temporarily paralyzes him. A few weeks later, the boy finds Makar, Ewka, and her older brother Anton having sex with each other and a goat in the field. Deciding that both they and the Germans became invincible by allying with demons, the boy flees into the forest again. While skating on a marsh, the boy is accosted by several young villagers who try to drown him after he accidentally wounds several of them with his skates. He is rescued by a woman named Labina, who later dies of a heart attack. 

In 1944, the tide of the war turns as the Wehrmacht begins losing ground to the Red Army, and the locals begin arguing over the merits of the impending Soviet occupation. The boy wonders why God would allow the Soviets to win the war if they intended to abolish religion and private property. After the Germans withdraw from a village, Kalmyk deserters in their service conduct a brutal raid before the arriving Soviets capture and execute them. The boy is treated in a field hospital and allowed to stay with the soldiers, where he is taught to read and indoctrinated into Stalinism and atheism by the political commissar Gavrila. The boy begins to hope to join the Communist Party and becomes preoccupied with others&#x27; opinion of him. After several soldiers are killed by local peasants with axes, the boy accompanies the respected crack sniper Mitka the Cuckoo as he takes revenge by shooting several of the peasants. 

Afterwards the boy is taken to an orphanage in his old home city, where he denounces the principal and two nurses to the Soviets after they punish him for refusing to remove his military uniform. When the school officials refuse to discipline him further, he begins refusing to learn his own native language and getting in fights with the other children. He befriends another mute named the Silent One, and they begin sneaking out into the city and getting into mischief. After the boys discover how to operate a railway switch and later get beaten by a dairy vendor, the Silent One uses the switch to derail a train in an unsuccessful murder attempt against the vendor. Eventually, at age 12, the boy is finally reunited with his parents after they identify him via a birthmark. However, the boy frequently misbehaves, breaking the arm of his four-year-old brother. After the war ends, he begins sneaking out at night to hang out with criminals and political dissidents before he is caught by the Militia. When the boy grows sickly, the family moves westward into the mountains on a doctor&#x27;s advice and the boy is sent to live with a ski instructor. After injuring himself skiing in a blizzard, the boy receives a telephone call to his hospital room and upon hearing the caller suddenly is able to speak again for the first time in years.

==Literary significance and criticism==

=== Early reception ===
The initial reception of the book was generally positive. In his 1965 editorial review Elie Wiesel wrote that the book was &quot;one of the best... Written with deep sincerity and sensitivity,&quot; a review written in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; and quoted by the book&#x27;s publisher. Richard Kluger, reviewing it for &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, wrote: &quot;Extraordinary... literally staggering... one of the most powerful books I have ever read.&quot; And Jonathan Yardley, reviewing it for &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, wrote: &quot;Of all the remarkable fiction that emerged from World War II, nothing stands higher than Jerzy Kosiński&#x27;s &quot;The Painted Bird&quot;. A magnificent work of art, and a celebration of the individual will. No one who reads it will forget it; no one who reads it will be unmoved by it. &quot;The Painted Bird&quot; enriches our literature and our lives&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the novel in its &quot;Time 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005&quot;, accentuating the atrocities witnessed by the protagonist.

In 2011, American critic Ruth Franklin observed that the book, previously a prominent fixture in Holocaust studies, particularly in the context of literature studies, has seen a significant decline within curricula of American high school and colleges, which she attributed to concerns surrounding the work&#x27;s authenticity.

=== Anti-Polish sentiment and reception in Poland ===
The book&#x27;s reception in Poland was far from uniform. Initially it was subject to much criticism from both the communist and émigré press due to its perceived anti-Polish sentiment, although there have been dissenting views. Since then the views about the book in Poland remain divided and the book is most often described as controversial. In the opinion of some critics, the book is a masterpiece and a parable of human fate, while in the opinion of others, it is an anti-Polish hoax.

The book has been particularly poorly received by people whom Kosinski knew in his childhood and whom he wrote into the novel. As noted by Kosiński&#x27;s American biographer James Sloan, one of the villagers who helped Kosiński&#x27;s family during the war, whom he interviewed, &quot;wept and said, “We saved their lives, and he turned us into monsters.”&quot; He also recounted another incident, when Kosinski visited Poland: “The people who had saved his life came to his Polish book signing. He couldn’t acknowledge them. He had to protect his myth.”

Polish author and critic Stanisław Lem wrote a review of &quot;The Painted Bird&quot;, which he titled &quot;The Career of a Counterfeit&quot;. He stated that &quot;Sexual parasitism on the era of genocide is one of the greatest abominations imaginable.&quot; Lem further adds about Kosiński: &quot;Since the realism of German genocidal practices does not suit the sexual sadist very well, as it is a kind of industrialized slaughterhouse, and not an orgiastic panopticum, there comes to the rescue of authenticity the pseudologia pornographica&quot;. He also wrote that &quot;This book, as a bestseller, received positive opinions from famous critics; what was abominable in it was interpreted as &quot;delirium&quot; and &quot;phantasmagoria&quot; of its child protagonist; the copulatory marathon of Polish peasants was seen as a dark reveal of the primitive wild &quot;Balkan&quot; community; even some of our compatriots who realized that it was a lampoon [...] were ready to see a certain greatness in &quot;The Painted Bird&quot;, due to its boundless boldness and violence.&quot;

A number of non-Polish scholars and critics also commented on the anti-Polish sentiment present in he book. In 1996 D. G. Myers wrote that in the book, which he considers &quot;an indispensable document of the Holocaust...although it may not be based on Kosinski’s own experiences&quot;, &quot;Kosinski aims to exhibit the cruelty and backwardness of the Polish peasants&quot;. Writing in 1997 in &quot;The Polish Review&quot; Thomas S. Gladsky described the book as an &quot;attack on Poles&quot;. Finkelstein wrote in &quot;The Holocaust Industry&quot; (2003) that Kosiński&#x27;s book &quot;depicts the Polish peasants he lived with as virulently anti-Semitic&quot; even though they were fully aware of his Jewishness and &quot;the dire consequences they themselves faced if caught.&quot; Kevin Hannan criticized the book in 2005, concluding that &quot;The Painted Bird suggests a deceptive distortion of Polish history in the twentieth century, and the book demeans those Poles who risked their lives to save and shelter Jews such as Jerzy Kosinski&quot;. In 2022 the Polish critic and University of Rzeszów professor in her chapter on controversies about Kosiński&#x27;s book noted that &quot;the novel was read as strongly anti-Polish&quot;. 

In 2003 Polish literary critic and University of Warsaw professor Paweł Dudziak expressed a different view. Noting that &quot;The Painted Bird&quot; is a &quot;great, if controversial&quot; piece, he stressed that since the book is surreal – a fictional tale – and does not present, or claim to present – real world events, accusations of anti-Polish sentiment are nothing but a misunderstanding of the book by those who take it too literally.

===Authorship controversy===
According to Eliot Weinberger, contemporary American writer, essayist, editor, and translator, Kosiński was not the author of the book. Weinberger alleged in his 2000 collection &quot;Karmic Traces&quot; that Kosiński had very little fluent knowledge of English at the time of its writing.

M. A. Orthofer commented on Weinberger&#x27;s assertion by stating:
===Accusation of plagiarism===
In June 1982, a &quot;Village Voice&quot; article claimed that Kosiński&#x27;s books had actually been largely ghost-written by assistants, pointing to striking stylistic differences among Kosiński&#x27;s novels. The New York poet, publisher and translator George Reavey claimed to have written &quot;The Painted Bird.&quot; However, in the opinion of Sloan, Reavey was simply embittered by his own lack of literary success.

The journalist John Corry, also a controversial author, wrote a 6,000-word feature article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; defending Kosiński, which appeared on the front page of the &quot;Arts and Leisure&quot; section in November 1982. Among other things, Corry alleged that &quot;reports claiming that Kosiński was a plagiarist in the pay of the C.I.A. were the product of a Polish Communist disinformation campaign.&quot;

In 2012 Polish literary historian Monika Adamczyk-Garbowska from Lublin University wrote that &quot;The Painted Bird&quot; includes long excerpts lifted verbatim from a book published in the Second Polish Republic by the Polish-Jewish ethnographer Henryk Biegeleisen.

===Controversy over supposed autobiographical elements===
&quot;The Painted Bird&quot; was published and marketed as a fictional work although it was generally assumed that it was based on the author&#x27;s experiences during World War II. Only later did it become clear to most reviewers that Kosiński was neither the boy in the story nor did he share any of the boy&#x27;s experiences, as revealed in a series of articles in newspapers and books.(2) The depicted events are now widely known to be fictional.

D. G. Myers, Associate Professor of English at Texas A&amp;M University, reviewing a biography of Kosiński noted that initially, the author had passed off &quot;The Painted Bird&quot; as the true story of his own life during the Holocaust: &quot;Long before writing it he regaled friends and dinner parties with macabre tales of a childhood spent in hiding among the Polish peasantry.&quot;

Among those who were fascinated was Dorothy deSantillana, a senior editor at Houghton Mifflin, to whom Kosiński confided that he had a manuscript based on his experiences.&quot; According to James Park Sloan, by the time the book was going into publication, Kosiński refrained from making further claims of the book being autobiographical – in a letter to de Santillana and in a subsequent author&#x27;s note to the book itself. Kosiński nonetheless continued to assert that characterizing the novel as autobiographical &quot;may be convenient for classification but is not easily justified&quot; (the same language he used in his author&#x27;s note and his pre-publication correspondence with deSantillana) in later interviews during his life.

The &quot;Village Voice&quot; article presented a different picture of Kosiński&#x27;s life during the Holocaust – a view which was later supported by Joanna Siedlecka, a Polish biographer, in her 1993 exposé &quot;The Ugly Black Bird&quot; and Sloan. They revealed that &quot;The Painted Bird&quot;, assumed by many reviewers to be semi-autobiographical, was a work of fiction. Rather than wandering the Polish countryside, Kosiński and his parents had spent the war years in hiding with a Polish Catholic family who sheltered them from the Germans and that he had never been mistreated in any way.

Reviewing James Park Sloan&#x27;s biography of Kosiński for &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;, Louis Begley wrote: &quot;Perhaps the most surprising element of this aspect of Kosiński&#x27;s mystifications is that he obtained from his mother, who was still alive in Poland – the father had died by the time &quot;The Painted Bird&quot; was published – a letter corroborating the claim that he had been separated from his family during the war.&quot;

Terence Blacker, an English publisher of Kosiński&#x27;s books and an author of children&#x27;s books and mysteries for adults, wrote in response to the article&#x27;s accusations in 2002:
The significant point about Jerzy Kosinski was that... his books... had a vision and a voice consistent with one another and with the man himself. The problem was perhaps that he was a successful, worldly author who played polo, moved in fashionable circles and even appeared as an actor in Warren Beatty&#x27;s &quot;Reds&quot;. He seemed to have had an adventurous and rather kinky sexuality which, to many, made him all the more suspect.

D.G. Myers responded to Blacker&#x27;s assertions that much of Kosinski&#x27;s behaviour was the result of &quot;compensating for &#x27;the hollowness at the core of his being&#x27;&quot; in his review of &quot;Jerzy Kosiński: A Biography&quot; by James Park Sloan:
This theory explains much: the reckless driving, the abuse of small dogs, the thirst for fame, the fabrication of personal experience, the secretiveness about how he wrote, the denial of his Jewish identity. &quot;There was a hollow space at the center of Kosiński that had resulted from denying his past,&quot; Sloan writes, &quot;and his whole life had become a race to fill in that hollow space before it caused him to implode, collapsing inward upon himself like a burnt-out star.&quot; On this theory, Kosiński emerges as a classic borderline personality, frantically defending himself against... all-out psychosis.Finkelstein wrote: &quot;Long after Kosiński was exposed as a consummate literary hoaxer, Wiesel continued to heap encomiums on his &#x27;remarkable body of work.&#x27;&quot; 

Discussing Kosiński&#x27;s false claims, Lawrence L. Langer noted that during an interview for a television documentary in 1968, Kosiński claimed that &quot;what happened to him was &quot;worse&quot; than what happened to the boy in the novel&quot;.

Other fictitious Holocaust memoirs with which the book has since been compared include Binjamin Wilkomirski&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, Misha Defonseca&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Herman Rosenblat&#x27;s &quot;Angel at the Fence&quot;.

==Film adaptation==
The novel was adapted into a feature-length film in 2019, directed and produced by Václav Marhoul.

==Music inspiration==
The novel inspired the band Siouxsie and the Banshees who wrote a song called &quot;Painted Bird&quot; in 1982, on their album &quot;A Kiss in the Dreamhouse&quot;. The novel also inspired an album of the same name by avant-garde composer John Zorn. It has also inspired the name of musician Daniel Kahn&#x27;s band Daniel Kahn &amp; the Painted Bird.

<doc id="442996" wikidata="Q336439" url="?curid=442996" title="Ćuk converter">
<text>The Ćuk converter (, ) is a type of buck-boost converter with low ripple current. A Ćuk converter can be seen as a combination of boost converter and buck converter, having one switching device and a mutual capacitor, to couple the energy.

Similar to the buck-boost converter with inverting topology, the output voltage of non-isolated Ćuk converter is typically inverted, with lower or higher values with respect to the input voltage. While DC-to-DC converters usually use the inductor as a main energy-storage component, the Ćuk converter instead uses the capacitor as the main energy-storage component. It is named after Slobodan Ćuk of the California Institute of Technology, who first presented the design.

==Non-isolated Ćuk converter==
There are variations on the basic Ćuk converter. For example, the coils may share a single magnetic core, which drops the output ripple, and adds efficiency. Because the power transfer flows continuously via the capacitor, this type of switcher has minimized EMI radiation. The Ćuk converter allows energy to flow bidirectionally by using a diode and a switch.

===Operating principle===
A non-isolated Ćuk converter comprises two inductors, two capacitors, a switch (usually a transistor), and a diode. Its schematic can be seen in figure 1. It is an inverting converter, so the output voltage is negative with respect to the input voltage.

The main advantage of this converter is the continuous currents at the input and output of the converter.  The main disadvantage is the high current stress on the switch.

The capacitor C1 is used to transfer energy. It is connected alternately to the input and to the output of the converter &quot;via&quot; the commutation of the transistor and the diode (see figures 2 and 3).

The two inductors L1 and L2 are used to convert respectively the input voltage source (&quot;Vs&quot;) and the output voltage (&quot;Vo&quot;) into current sources. At a short time scale, an inductor can be considered as a current source as it maintains a constant current. This conversion is necessary because if the capacitor were connected directly to the voltage source, the current would be limited only by the parasitic resistance, resulting in high energy loss. Charging a capacitor with a current source (the inductor) prevents resistive current limiting and its associated energy loss.

As with other converters (buck converter, boost converter, buck–boost converter) the Ćuk converter can operate in either continuous or discontinuous current mode. However, unlike these converters, it can also operate in &quot;discontinuous voltage mode&quot; (the voltage across the capacitor drops to zero during the commutation cycle).

=== Continuous mode ===

In steady state, the energy stored in each inductor has to remain the same at the beginning and at the end of a commutation cycle. The energy in an inductor is given by:

formula_1

This implies that the current through each inductor has to be the same at the beginning and the end of the commutation cycle. As the evolution of the current through an inductor is related to the voltage across it:

formula_2

it can be seen that the average value of each inductor&#x27;s voltage over a commutation period has to be zero to satisfy the steady-state requirements. (Another way to see this is to recognize that the average voltage across any inductor must be zero lest its current rise without limit.)

If we consider that the capacitors &quot;C1&quot; and &quot;C2&quot; are large enough for the voltage ripple across them to be negligible, the inductor voltages become:

* in the off-state, inductor &quot;L1&quot; is connected in series with &quot;Vs&quot; and &quot;C1&quot; (see figure 2). Therefore formula_3. As the diode &quot;D&quot; is forward biased (we consider zero voltage drop), &quot;L2&quot; is directly connected to the output capacitor. Therefore formula_4
* in the on-state, inductor &quot;L1&quot; is directly connected to the input source. Therefore formula_5. Inductor &quot;L2&quot; is connected in series with &quot;C&quot; and the output capacitor, so formula_6
The converter operates in &quot;on state&quot; from formula_7 to formula_8 (&quot;D&quot; is the duty cycle), and in &quot;off state&quot; from &quot;D·T&quot; to &quot;T&quot; (that is, during a period equal to formula_9). The average values of &quot;VL1&quot; and &quot;VL2&quot; are therefore:

formula_10

formula_11

As both average voltage have to be zero to satisfy the steady-state conditions, using the last equation we can write:

formula_12

So the average voltage across L1 becomes:

formula_13

Which can be written as:

formula_14

It can be seen that this relation is the same as that obtained for the buck–boost converter.

=== Discontinuous mode ===
Like all DC/DC converters, Ćuk converters rely on the ability of the inductors in the circuit to provide continuous current, in much the same way a capacitor in a rectifier filter provides continuous voltage. If this inductor is too small or below the &quot;critical inductance&quot;, then the inductor current slope will be discontinuous where the current goes to zero. This state of operation is usually not studied in much depth as it is generally not used beyond a demonstrating of why the minimum inductance is crucial, although it may occur when maintaining a standby voltage at a much lower current than the converter was designed for.

The minimum inductance is given by:

formula_15

Where formula_16 is the switching frequency.

==Isolated Ćuk converter==

For isolated version of Ćuk converter, an AC transformer and an additional capacitor must be added. Because the isolated Ćuk converter is isolated, the output-voltage polarity can be chosen freely.

As the non-isolated Ćuk converter, the isolated Ćuk converter can have an output voltage magnitude that is either greater than or less than the input voltage magnitude, even with a 1:1 AC transformer. However, the turns ratio can be controlled to reduce device stress on the input side. Additionally, the parasitic elements of the transformer, namely leakage inductance and magnetizing inductance can be used to modify the circuit into a resonant converter circuit which has much improved efficiency.

==Related structures==

===Inductor coupling===
Instead of using two discrete inductor components, many designers implement a &quot;coupled inductor Ćuk converter&quot;, using a single magnetic component that includes both inductors on the same core. The transformer action between the inductors inside that component gives a &quot;coupled inductor Ćuk converter&quot; with lower output ripple than a Ćuk converter using two independent discrete inductor components.

===Zeta converter===
A zeta converter is a non-isolated, non-inverting, buck-boost power supply topology.

===Single-ended primary-inductor converter (SEPIC)===

A SEPIC converter is able to step-up or step-down the voltage.

<doc id="443004" wikidata="Q1245166" url="?curid=443004" title="Gaelscoil">
<text>A Gaelscoil (; plural: &quot;Gaelscoileanna&quot;) is an Irish language-medium school in Ireland: the term refers especially to Irish-medium schools outside the Irish-speaking regions or Gaeltacht. Over 50,000 students attend Gaelscoileanna at primary and second levels on the island of Ireland. Additionally, more than 13,000 students are receiving their primary and second level education through Irish in the Gaeltacht. Gaelscoileanna and Irish-medium schools in the Gaeltacht are supported and represented by Gaeloideachas and An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta &amp; Gaelscolaíochta or COGG in the Republic of Ireland and by Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta in Northern Ireland. The largest patron body of Gaelscoileanna in the Republic of Ireland is An Foras Pátrúnachta, although the vast majority of schools under their patronage are at primary level.

Students in the Gaelscoileanna acquire the Irish language through language immersion, and study the standard curriculum through it. Gaelscoileanna, unlike English-medium schools, have the reputation of producing competent Irish speakers. English-medium schools, in contrast, produce relatively few fluent Irish speakers, despite the Irish language being an obligatory subject in the Republic of Ireland in both primary and secondary school. This has been attributed in part to the lack of Irish-language immersion programs.
Gaelscoileanna have undergone a striking expansion over the last few decades, although there are now concerns that rules limiting the founding of new schools are affecting the establishment of new Irish-medium education in areas where there is competition amongst educational patrons. Their success is due to effective (though limited) community support and an efficient administrative infrastructure. They are distinguished by being the product, not of state policy, but of a genuine community movement.

In 1972 there were only 11 such schools at primary level and five at secondary level in the Republic of Ireland. As of September 2023 there were 188 gaelscoileanna at primary level, attended by over 40,000 students, and 31 gaelcholáistí and 17 aonaid Ghaeilge (Irish language units) at secondary level, attended by over 12,000 students in non-Gaeltacht areas across Ireland. 35 of these primary schools, two of the postprimary schools and four of the postprimary units operated are in Northern Ireland. Additionally, some 4,000 children attend Irish-medium preschools or Naíonraí outside the Gaeltacht with around 1,000 children attending &quot;Naíonraí&quot; within the Gaeltacht. There is now at least one gaelscoil in every county in Ireland with over 50 in County Dublin; 30 in County Cork and 13 in County Antrim included.

==Social status and function==
Gaelscoileanna have acquired a reputation for providing excellent academic results at a moderate cost. They have been described as a system of &quot;positive social selection&quot; giving better than average access to tertiary education and the social and employment opportunities which follow. An analysis of &quot;feeder&quot; schools which send students on to tertiary level institutions shows that 22% of Irish-medium schools send all their students on to tertiary level, compared to 7% of English-medium schools.

Supporters argue that the bilingualism resulting from early acquisition of another language is of general intellectual benefit and helps children to learn still other languages. Irish-language advocates of the immersion approach sometimes refer to studies showing that bilingual children have advantages over monoglot children in other subjects.

==Statistics==

===By province (primary level)===

* Leinster – 19,331 primary students attend 71 gaelscoileanna.
* Ulster – 6,801 primary students attend 45 gaelscoileanna.
* Munster – 11,332 primary students attend 44 gaelscoileanna.
* Connacht – 3,509 primary students attend 18 gaelscoileanna.

==Post-primary education through Irish==

A secondary-level Gaelscoil located in a non-Gaeltacht area is commonly known as a Gaelcholáiste. There are 31 Gaelcholáistí and 17 second-level Irish language units (&quot;aonaid Ghaeilge&quot;) on the island of Ireland, attended by over 12,000 students. Close to 4,000 further students receive their second-level education through Irish in the Gaeltacht.

Two new second-level gaelscoileanna opened in Ireland in 2014: Coláiste Ghlór na Mara in Balbriggan and Gaelcholáiste an Phiarsaigh in Rathfarnham (both in County Dublin). Gaelcholáiste Charraig Uí Leighin opened in Carrigaline and Northern Ireland&#x27;s second gaelcholáiste Gaelcholáiste Dhoire opened in Dungiven Castle in 2015. Gaelcholáiste Mhic Shuibhne opened in Knocknaheeney in 2019. Gaelcholáiste Mhaigh Nuad opened in Maynooth in September 2020.

Gaelcholáistí are supported and represented on a practical day-to-day basis by Gaeloideachas (who also support Irish-medium schools in the Gaeltacht) and An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta &amp; Gaelscolaíochta (whose name translates into English as &quot;The Council for Gaeltacht and Gaelscoileanna Education&quot;) or COGG in the Republic of Ireland and by Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta in Northern Ireland.

In 2023 An Foras Pátrúnacha revealed that there is a demand for 7 new Gaelcholáistí in the Republic of Ireland and in 2021 Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta revealed that there is a demand for 3 new Gaelcholáistí in Northern Ireland.

===List of Gaelcholáistí===


== Strategy proposals ==
The function and future of Gaelscoileanna in the Republic of Ireland falls within the scope of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030, published by the then-Irish government in December 2010. This report emphasises the importance of offering all children in primary schools in Ireland the opportunity to experience partial immersion in the formative years of primary education. It calls for primary teachers to have additional immersion classes to improve their competence in the language. This would involve teaching some subjects such as Mathematics and Science in Irish.

<text>Methuen Publishing Ltd (; also known as Methuen Books) is an English publishing house. 

It was founded in 1889 by Sir Algernon Methuen (1856–1924) and began publishing in London in 1892. Initially, Methuen mainly published non-fiction academic works, eventually diversifying to encourage female authors and later translated works. E. V. Lucas headed the firm from 1924 to 1938.

==Establishment==
In June 1889, as a sideline to teaching, Algernon Methuen began to publish and market his own textbooks under the label Methuen &amp; Co. The company&#x27;s first success came in 1892 with the publication of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Barrack-Room Ballads&quot;. Rapid growth came with works by Marie Corelli, Hilaire Belloc, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Oscar Wilde (&quot;De Profundis&quot;, 1905) as well as Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot;.

In 1910, the business was converted into a limited liability company with E. V. Lucas and G.E. Webster joining the founder on the board of directors. The company published the 1920 English translation of Albert Einstein&#x27;s &quot;Relativity, the Special and the General Theory: A Popular Exposition&quot;.

With knowledge he had gained of children&#x27;s literature at the publisher Grant Richards, E. V. Lucas built on the company&#x27;s early success. Methuen published The Blue Bird. &quot;A Fairy Play in Six Acts&quot; by Maurice Maeterlinck (Nobel Prize in Literature 1911) in an English translation by Alexander Teixeira de Mattos. Among the authors Lucas signed to the company were A. A. Milne, Kenneth Grahame, while he also supported illustrators W. Heath Robinson, H. M. Bateman and E. H. Shepard. By the 1920s, it had also a literary list that included Anthony Hope, G. K. Chesterton, Henry James, D. H. Lawrence, T. S. Eliot, Ruth Manning-Sanders and The Arden Shakespeare series.

==&quot;The Rainbow&quot;==
Following the publication of Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;The Rainbow&quot; (1915), Methuen was prosecuted for obscenity. The firm offered no defence and agreed to destroy the remaining stock of 1,011 copies. It is thought that one reason for the firm&#x27;s failure to support Lawrence was that he had at the time written an unkind portrait of the chief editor&#x27;s brother, who had recently been killed in France.

==Edward Verrall Lucas==
In 1924, E. V. Lucas succeeded Algernon Methuen as chairman and led the company until his death in 1938. Besides his executive role, he also received a separate salary as the chief reader of the company. His commercial judgment added authors Enid Blyton, P. G. Wodehouse, Pearl S. Buck and Maurice Maeterlinck to the company&#x27;s list. In 1935, they published Daniele Varè&#x27;s novel &quot;The Maker of Heavenly Trousers&quot;.

In 1930, the company published the popular humorous book &quot;1066 and All That&quot;.

==Tintin==
Methuen was the English publisher of the book editions of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, a series of classic Belgian comic-strip books, written and illustrated by Hergé. Methuen altered their editions of Tintin by insisting that books featuring British characters undergo major changes. &quot;The Black Island&quot;, first published in French in 1937, was set in Great Britain, but, prior to publishing it themselves in 1966, Methuen decided that it did not reflect the U.K. accurately enough and sent a list of 131 &quot;errors&quot; to be corrected. It was thus redrawn and reset in the 1960s. Critics have attacked Methuen over the changes, claiming that &quot;The Black Island&quot; lost a lot of its charm as a result. &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot; had had a troubled publishing history, but the completed adventure eventually appeared in 1948–1950. It was set in the British Mandate of Palestine and featured the conflict between Jews, Arabs and British troops. When Methuen was translating the &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot; into English, Israel had long since been in existence, and Methuen asked for it to be edited. Hergé took the opportunity to redraw the few problematic pages, as well as the pages before that: the freighter that appeared before that was based on Hergé&#x27;s imagination, due to lack of resources at the time. The earlier version, published in 1950, was reprinted by Casterman as a facsimile edition, but internationally was completely replaced by the newer version.

==Children&#x27;s imprint==
Methuen Children&#x27;s Books, under the leadership of Olive Jones, Charles Shirley and Marilyn Malin, has been described as &quot;an outward-looking company whose sense of identity was enhanced by bright design, a keen marketing drive, and a strong European flavour&quot;.

==Recent history==
In 1958, Methuen was part of the conglomerate Associated Book Publishers (ABP), and for much of the 1970s was known as Eyre Methuen following its absorption of the Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode firm. When ABP was acquired by the Thomson Organization in 1987, it sold off the trade publishing units, including Methuen, to Reed International&#x27;s Octopus. Reed sold off its trade publishing to Random House in February 1997. Methuen Drama bought itself out in 1998 while retaining the distribution and warehousing services with Random House. That same year, Reed sold Methuen&#x27;s children&#x27;s catalogue to the Egmont Group. Egmont Group sold its UK book division to HarperCollins in 2020.

In 2003, Methuen Drama purchased the company Politico&#x27;s Publishing from its owner Iain Dale. In 2006, Methuen sold its notable drama lists to A &amp; C Black for £2.35 million.

Penguin Random House now owns the rights to many books that used to be published under the Methuen name through Random House and the Adrian Mole franchise through Penguin Books, the company also distributed the titles of now-independent Methuen Books. Many of the publisher&#x27;s academic titles are now published by Routledge.

Methuen Books continues to publish new works of fiction and non-fiction, as well as reprinting older, classic works. Contemporary Methuen authors include Mark Dunn, Robert McKee, Michael Palin, 1986 Nobel Prize Winner Wole Soyinka, and 2012 Nobel Prize Winner Mo Yan. Classic Methuen authors include the American novelist Walker Percy, the American academic and commentator Neil Postman, and the British cartoonist Norman Thelwell.

<doc id="443012" wikidata="Q1282486" url="?curid=443012" title="Ed Schrock">
<text>Edward Lee Schrock (born April 6, 1941) is a retired naval officer (1964–1988) and American Republican politician who served as a member of the Senate of Virginia from 1996 to 2001. He also served in the U.S. House of Representatives from January 2001 to January 2005, representing the Second Congressional District of Virginia.

==Early life and career==
Born in Middletown, Ohio, Schrock earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Alderson-Broaddus College in 1964 and a master&#x27;s degree in Public Relations from American University in 1975. His 24-year career as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy (1964 to 1988) included two tours of duty in Vietnam. After retiring from active military service, Schrock worked as an investment broker and then served in the Virginia State Senate, from 1996 to 2001.

==Tenure in Congress==
In 2000, he was elected to the U.S. House seat for Virginia&#x27;s 2nd District, defeating the Democratic Party nominee, Jody Wagner, a Norfolk attorney who later became state treasurer.

In his first term, Schrock was elected president of the Republican freshman class. During his four years in Congress, Schrock served on the Armed Services Committee, Budget Committee, Small Business Committee and Government Reform Committee.

In 2002 in his second term, Schrock defeated Green Party candidate D.C. Amarasinghe, winning 83.15% of the vote.

=== Controversy ===
In 2004, Michael Rogers&#x27; blogACTIVE.com had said that Schrock is gay — or at least bisexual — despite having aggressively opposed various gay-rights issues in Congress, such as same-sex marriage and gays serving in the military. Schrock, who is married, announced on August 30, 2004, that he would resign and not seek a third term in Congress.

On November 2, in the general election, fellow Republican Thelma Drake was elected to replace Schrock. Drake took office in January 2005.

==After Congress==
In December 2004, Representative Tom Davis, another Virginia Republican, hired Schrock to serve as the top staff person for one of the subcommittees of the Government Reform Committee which Davis chaired and on which Schrock had served.

Schrock was briefly covered in the 2009 documentary &quot;Outrage&quot;, which profiles allegedly closeted gay public officials who have endorsed anti-gay legislation.

<doc id="443015" wikidata="Q1046562" url="?curid=443015" title="Hardware abstraction">
<text>Hardware abstractions are sets of routines in software that provide programs with access to hardware resources through programming interfaces. The programming interface allows all devices in a particular class &quot;C&quot; of hardware devices to be accessed through identical interfaces even though &quot;C&quot; may contain different subclasses of devices that each provide a different hardware interface.

Hardware abstractions often allow programmers to write device-independent, high performance applications by providing standard operating system (OS) calls to hardware. The process of abstracting pieces of hardware is often done from the perspective of a CPU. Each type of CPU has a specific instruction set architecture or ISA. The ISA represents the primitive operations of the machine that are available for use by assembly programmers and compiler writers. One of the main functions of a compiler is to allow a programmer to write an algorithm in a high-level language without having to care about CPU-specific instructions. Then it is the job of the compiler to generate a CPU-specific executable. The same type of abstraction is made in operating systems, but OS APIs now represent the primitive operations of the machine, rather than an ISA. This allows a programmer to use OS-level operations (e.g. task creation/deletion) in their programs while retaining portability over a variety of different platforms.

==Overview==
Many early computer systems did not have any form of hardware abstraction. This meant that anyone writing a program for such a system would have to know how each hardware device communicated with the rest of the system. This was a significant challenge to software developers since they then had to know how every hardware device in a system worked to ensure the software&#x27;s compatibility. With hardware abstraction, rather than the program communicating directly with the hardware device, it communicates to the operating system what the device should do, which then generates a hardware-dependent instruction to the device. This meant programmers didn&#x27;t need to know how specific devices worked, making their programs compatible with any device.

An example of this might be a &quot;joystick&quot; abstraction. The joystick device, of which there are many physical implementations, is readable/writable through an API which many joystick-like devices might share. Most joystick-devices might report movement directions. Many joystick-devices might have sensitivity-settings that can be configured by an outside application. A Joystick abstraction hides details (e.g., register format, I2C address) of the hardware so that a programmer using the abstracted API, does not need to understand the details of the device&#x27;s physical interface. This also allows code reuse since the same code can process standardized messages from any kind of implementation which supplies the &quot;joystick&quot; abstraction. A &quot;nudge forward&quot; can be from a potentiometer or from a capacitive touch sensor that recognises &quot;swipe&quot; gestures, as long as they both provide a signal related to &quot;movement&quot;.

As physical limitations (e.g. resolution of sensor, temporal update frequency) may vary with hardware, an API can do little to hide that, other than by assuming a &quot;least common denominator&quot; model. Thus, certain deep architectural decisions from the implementation may become relevant to users of a particular instantiation of an abstraction.

A good metaphor is the abstraction of transportation. Both bicycling and driving a car are transportation. They both have commonalities (e.g., you must steer) and physical differences (e.g., use of feet). One can always specify the abstraction &quot;drive to&quot; and let the implementor decide whether bicycling or driving a car is best. The &quot;wheeled terrestrial transport&quot; function is abstracted and the details of &quot;how to drive&quot; are encapsulated.

Examples of &quot;abstractions&quot; on a PC include video input, printers, audio input and output, block devices (e.g. hard disk drives or USB flash drive), etc.

In certain computer science domains, such as operating systems or embedded systems, the abstractions have slightly different appearances (for instance, operating systems tend to have more standardized interfaces), but the concept of abstraction and encapsulation of complexity are common, and deep.

The hardware abstraction layer resides below the application programming interface (API) in a software stack, whereas the application layer (often written in a high level language) resides above the API and communicates with the hardware by calling functions in the API.

==In operating systems==
A hardware abstraction layer (HAL) is an abstraction layer, implemented in software, between the physical hardware of a computer and the software that runs on that computer. Its function is to hide differences in hardware from most of the operating system kernel, so that most of the kernel-mode code does not need to be changed to run on systems with different hardware. On Microsoft Windows, HAL can basically be considered to be the driver for the motherboard and allows instructions from higher level computer languages to communicate with lower level components, but prevents direct access to the hardware.

CP/M (CP/M BIOS), DOS (DOS BIOS), Solaris, Linux, BSD, macOS, and some other portable operating systems also have a HAL, even if it is not explicitly designated as such. Some operating systems, such as Linux, have the ability to insert one while running, like Adeos. The NetBSD operating system is widely known as having a clean hardware abstraction layer which allows it to be highly portable. As part of this system are /, , and other subsystems. Popular buses which are used on more than one architecture are also abstracted, such as ISA, EISA, PCI, PCIe, etc., allowing drivers to also be highly portable with a minimum of code modification.

Operating systems having a defined HAL are more easily portable across different hardware. This is especially important for embedded systems that run on dozens of different platforms.

===Microsoft Windows===

The Windows NT kernel has a HAL in the kernel space between hardware and the executive services that are contained in the file NTOSKRNL.EXE under &quot;%WINDOWS%\system32\hal.dll&quot;. This allows portability of the Windows NT kernel-mode code to a variety of processors, with different memory management unit architectures, and a variety of systems with different I/O bus architectures; most of that code runs without change on those systems, when compiled for the instruction set applicable to those systems. For example, the SGI Intel x86-based workstations were not IBM PC compatible workstations, but due to the HAL, Windows 2000 was able to run on them.

Since Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the HAL used is automatically determined during startup.

===AS/400===
An &quot;extreme&quot; example of a HAL can be found in the System/38 and AS/400 architectures, currently implemented in the IBM i operating system. Most compilers for those systems generate an abstract machine code; the Licensed Internal Code, or LIC, translates this virtual machine code into native code for the processor on which it is running and executes the resulting native code. (The exceptions are compilers that generate the LIC itself; those compilers are not available outside IBM.) This was so successful that application software and operating system software above the LIC layer that were compiled on the original S/38 run without modification and without recompilation on the latest AS/400 systems, despite the fact that the underlying hardware has been changed dramatically; at least three different types of processors have been in use.

=== Android ===
Android introduced a HAL known as the &quot;vendor interface&quot; (codenamed &quot;Project Treble&quot;) on version 8.0 &quot;Oreo&quot;. It abstracts low-level code from the Android OS framework, and they must be made forward compatible to support future versions of Android to ease the development of firmware updates. Before Project Treble Android relied on various non-standardized legacy HALs.

Halium is an Android-based HAL used by several mobile operating systems such as Ubuntu Touch and LuneOS to run on smartphones with Android pre-installed.

<text>The pine warbler (Setophaga pinus) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family.

== Description ==
These birds have white bellies, two white wing bars, dark legs and thin, relatively long pointed bills; they have yellowish &#x27;spectacles&#x27; around their eyes. Adult males have olive upperparts and bright yellow throats and breasts; females and immatures display upperparts which are olive-brown. Their throats and breasts are paler. The adult male pine warbler looks somewhat similar to the yellow-throated vireo which may cause some identification problems.

The song of this bird is a musical trill. Their calls are slurred &quot;chip&quot;s.

== Distribution and habitat ==

Their breeding habitats are open pine woods in eastern North America. These birds are permanent residents in southern Florida. Some of them, however, migrate to northeastern Mexico and islands in Bermuda and the Caribbean. The first record for South America was a vagrant wintering female seen at Vista Nieve, Colombia, on 20 November 2002; this bird was foraging as part of a mixed-species feeding flock that also included wintering Blackburnian and Tennessee warblers.

== Behavior ==
They forage slowly on tree trunks and branches by poking their bill into pine cones. These birds also find food by searching for it on the ground. These birds mainly eat insects, seeds and berries.

Their nests are deep, open cups, which are placed near the end of a tree branch. Pine warblers prefer to nest in pine trees, hence their names. Three to five blotched white eggs are laid.

<doc id="443026" wikidata="Q347356" url="?curid=443026" title="Asa Gray">
<text>Asa Gray (November 18, 1810 – January 30, 1888) is considered the most important American botanist of the 19th century. His &quot;Darwiniana&quot; (1876) was considered an important explanation of how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive. Gray was adamant that a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species. He was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation in the sense of its not allowing for evolution. He was a strong supporter of Darwin, although Gray&#x27;s theistic evolution was guided by a Creator.

As a professor of botany at Harvard University for several decades, Gray regularly visited, and corresponded with, many of the leading natural scientists of the era, including Charles Darwin, who held great regard for him. Gray made several trips to Europe to collaborate with leading European scientists of the era, as well as trips to the southern and western United States. He also built an extensive network of specimen collectors.

A prolific writer, he was instrumental in unifying the taxonomic knowledge of the plants of North America. Of Gray&#x27;s many works on botany, the most popular was his &quot;Manual of the Botany of the Northern United States, from New England to Wisconsin and South to Ohio and Pennsylvania Inclusive&quot;, known today simply as &quot;Gray&#x27;s Manual&quot;. Gray was the sole author of the first five editions of the book and co-author of the sixth, with botanical illustrations by Isaac Sprague. Further editions have been published, and it remains a standard in the field. Gray also worked extensively on a phenomenon that is now called the &quot;Asa Gray disjunction&quot;, namely, the surprising morphological similarities between many eastern Asian and eastern North American plants. Several structures, geographic features, and plants have been named after Gray.

In 1848, Gray was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

==Early life and education==
Gray was born in Sauquoit, New York, on November 18, 1810, to Moses Gray (b.February 26, 1786), then a tanner, and Roxanna Howard Gray (b. March 15, 1789). Born in the back of his father&#x27;s tannery, Gray was the eldest of their eight children. Gray&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather had arrived in Boston from Northern Ireland in 1718; Gray&#x27;s Scotch-Irish Presbyterian ancestors had moved to New York from Massachusetts and Vermont after Shays&#x27; Rebellion. His parents married on July 30, 1809. Tanneries needed a lot of wood to burn, and the lumber supply in the area had been shrinking, so Gray&#x27;s father used his profits to buy farms in the area, and in about 1823 sold the tannery and became a farmer.

Gray was an avid reader even in his youth. He completed Clinton Grammar School from about 1823 to 1825, in those years reading many books from the nearby library at Hamilton College. In 1825 he enrolled at Fairfield Academy, switching to its Fairfield Medical College, also known as the Medical College of the Western District of Fairfield, in autumn 1826. It was during this time that Gray began to mount botanical specimens. On a trip to New York City, he attempted to meet with John Torrey to get assistance in identifying specimens, but Torrey was not home, so Gray left the specimens at Torrey&#x27;s house. Torrey was so impressed with Gray&#x27;s specimens that he began a correspondence with him. Gray graduated and became an M.D. in February 1831, even though he was not yet 21 years of age, which was a requirement at the time. Although Gray did open a medical office in Bridgewater, New York, where he had served an apprenticeship with Doctor John Foote Trowbridge while he was in medical school, he never truly practiced medicine, as he enjoyed botany more. It was around this time that he began making explorations in New York and New Jersey. By autumn 1831 he had all but given up his medical practice to devote more time to botany.

In 1832 he was hired to teach chemistry, mineralogy, and botany at Bartlett&#x27;s High School in Utica, New York, and at Fairfield Medical School, replacing instructors who had died in mid-term. Agreeing to teach for one year, with a break from August to December 1832, Gray had to cancel his plans for an expedition to Mexico, which at the time included what is now the southwestern United States. Gray first met Torrey in person in September 1832, and they went on an expedition to New Jersey. After completing his teaching assignment in Utica on August 1, 1833, Gray became an assistant to Torrey at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. By this time, Gray was corresponding and trading specimens with botanists not just in America, but also in Asia, Europe, and the Pacific Islands. Gray held a temporary teaching position in 1834 at Hamilton College. Due to funding shortages, in 1835 Gray was obliged to leave his job as Torrey&#x27;s assistant, and in February or March 1836 became curator and librarian at the Lyceum of Natural History in New York, now called the New York Academy of Sciences. He had an apartment in their new building in Manhattan. Torrey&#x27;s attempt to get Gray a job at Princeton University was unsuccessful, as were other attempts to find him a position in science. Despite Gray no longer being his assistant, Torrey and Gray became lifelong friends and colleagues. Torrey&#x27;s wife, Eliza Torrey, had a profound impact upon Gray in his manners, tastes, habits, and religious life.

==Career==
In October 1836 Gray was selected to be one of the botanists on the United States Exploring Expedition (1838–1842), also known as the &quot;Wilkes Expedition&quot;, which was supposed to last three years. Gray began getting paid well for his work preparing and planning for this expedition, even to the point of loading supplies onto a ship in New York harbor. However, the expedition was fraught with politics, bickering, turmoil, inefficiency, and delays. Referring to the Secretary of the Navy, Mahlon Dickerson, Gray wrote of &quot;abominable management &amp; stupidity&quot;. Despite this, Gray resigned from the Lyceum in April 1837 to devote his time to the preparations. By 1838 the expedition was in utter turmoil. The new state of Michigan was starting its university, and Gray applied for a professorship in early 1838. He resigned from the Wilkes Expedition on July 10, 1838. In 1848 Gray was hired to work on the botanical specimens, and published the first volume of the report on botany in 1854, but Wilkes was unable to secure the funding for the second volume.

On July 17, 1838, Gray became the very first permanent paid professor at the newly founded University of Michigan, although in the event he never taught classes. His position was also the first one devoted solely to botany at any educational institution in America. Appointed Professor of Botany and Zoology, Gray was dispatched to Europe by the regents of the university for the purpose of purchasing a suitable array of books to form the university&#x27;s library, and equipment such as microscopes to aid research. Botanist Charles F. Jenkins states that the main purpose of this trip was to examine American flora in Europe&#x27;s herbariums. Gray departed on the packet ship &quot;Philadelphia&quot; on November 9, 1838, sailing through The Narrows out of New York Harbor nine days before his 28th birthday. Gray and the regents were both involved in stocking the university library. In 1839 the regents purchased a complete copy of Audubon&#x27;s &quot;The Birds of America&quot; for the then-extraordinary sum of $970. Gray&#x27;s first stop was in Glasgow, visiting William Hooker, who aided and financially supported many botanists, including Gray. On January 16, 1839, he arrived in London and stayed until March 14. He then spent time in Paris, where he collaborated with Joseph Decaisne at the Jardin des Plantes. In mid-April 1839 he left Paris for Italy by way of southern France, then visiting Genoa, Rome, Florence, Venice, Bologna, Padua, and Trieste. After Italy, Gray went to Vienna, Austria. While in Vienna, he spent twelve days studying specimen collections and gardens with Stephan Endlicher, who also introduced him to other local botanists. In 1840 Endlicher became director of the Botanical Garden of the University of Vienna. Departing Austria, Gray went to Munich, Zürich, and Geneva, where he met the prominent botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, who died in 1841. Gray continued extensive collaboration with deCandolle&#x27;s son Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle. Gray returned to Germany, going to Freiburg, Tübingen, Dresden, Halle, and then Berlin, where he stayed for a month. While in Berlin, he spent most of his time in Schöneberg, where the region&#x27;s Botanical Gardens were then located. Gray then returned to London by way of Hamburg. Gray admitted he just managed some of the book purchasing and that he delegated the actual buying of books to George Palmer Putnam, who was then living in London. Gray spent a year in Europe, leaving for America from Portsmouth, England, aboard the sailing ship &quot;Toronto&quot; on October 1, 1839, and arriving back in New York on November 4. Gray, together with his agents, eventually purchased about 3,700 books for the University of Michigan library. The regents at the University of Michigan were so impressed by Gray&#x27;s work in Europe, including his spending about $1,500 of his own money on specimen collections, that they granted him another year&#x27;s salary that covered him until the summer of 1841. However, finances at the university were so bad that they asked him to resign in April 1840.

While he was in Paris at the Jardin des Plantes, Gray saw an unnamed dried specimen, collected by André Michaux, and named it &quot;Shortia galacifolia&quot;. He spent considerable time and effort over the next 38 years looking for a specimen in the wild. The first such expedition was in late June to late July 1841 to an area near Jefferson, Ashe County, North Carolina. His further expeditions searching for this species were also unsuccessful, including one in 1876. In May 1877 a North Carolina herb collector found a specimen but did not know what it was. Eighteen months later the collector sent it to Joseph Whipple Congdon, who contacted Gray, telling Gray that he felt he had found &quot;Shortia&quot;. Gray was ecstatic to confirm this when he saw the specimen in October 1878. In spring 1879 Gray led an expedition, in which the collector helped, to the spot where &quot;S.galacifolia&quot; had been found. Gray never saw the species in the wild in bloom, but made a final trip to this region in 1884.

===Harvard professor===
Both Gray and Torrey were elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in December 1841. Gray never returned to teach a course at Michigan. In 1833 Dr.Joshua Fisher, a resident of Beverly, Massachusetts, and a Harvard University alumnus, bequeathed $20,000 to Harvard to endow a chair in natural history. The university allowed the proceeds to accumulate until it could fund a full year&#x27;s salary for a professor. Because of this and a few problems in finding a suitable professor, this chair was not filled until it was formally offered to Gray on March 26, 1842. The offer was $1,000/year salary, teaching duties limited to only botany, and being superintendent of Harvard&#x27;s botanic garden. While the salary was low, the teaching limitation, rare for the time, allowed him plenty of time to do research and work in the botanic garden. After an exchange of letters, Gray accepted this appointment as Fisher Professor of Natural History at Harvard. The formal appointment was made April 30, 1842. Gray arrived at Harvard on July 22, 1842, and began his duties in September. He did not have to teach in the fall of 1842, but began in spring 1843, the first classes he had taught in nine years. Early in his years at Harvard, Gray had to borrow money from his father. Soon he was able to repay his father and help his family by supplementing his income giving lectures outside of Harvard, including at the Lowell Institute. Gray was considered a weak lecturer, but because of his expert knowledge, he was highly regarded by his peers. His skills were better suited to teaching advanced rather than introductory classes. He also gained renown for his textbooks and high quality illustrations. Gray moved into what became known as the Asa Gray House in the Botanic Garden in the summer of 1844. It had been built in 1810 for William Dandridge Peck and later occupied by Thomas Nuttall. As the demands of teaching, collecting, selling specimens, taking care of the herbarium, and writing books increased and he himself was not a good illustrator, Gray found it necessary to hire a botanical illustratorIsaac Sprague, who illustrated much of Gray&#x27;s works for decades to come.

By June 1848 many of the specimens from the Wilkes Expedition had been damaged or lost. Many were still not classified or published, as the mismanagement and bungling that had plagued the expedition before it ever departed continued. While on a trip to Washington, D.C., that month with his new bride, Gray was hired to study the botanical specimens for five years. This included a year in Europe, with his wife, using the facilities at the herbariums in Europe. Mr.and Mrs.Gray departed for England on June 11, 1850. They spent the summer traveling to Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands. Gray then set down to work on the expedition&#x27;s plant sheets at the estate of botanist George Bentham, whom he had met eleven years earlier, and then with William Henry Harvey in Ireland. Gray returned to England and settled into a routine at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The couple was back in America on September 4, 1851. In the meantime, a dispute had arisen between Wilkes and the team of Torrey and Gray about the format of the books resulting from the expedition. Gray almost hired his father-in-law to break the contract. This dispute largely centered on the use of Latin and English. Wilkes wanted a literal Latin to English translation while Torrey and Gray wanted a looser one because they felt that technical English terms were equally incomprehensible to the public. Much of the work was stymied or burned in fires.

In 1855, Torrey and Gray contributed a &quot;Report on the Botany of the Expedition&quot; to Volume II of the &quot;Reports of Explorations and Surveys to ascertain the most practicable and economical route for a railroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean&quot; (known as the Pacific Railroad Surveys). The Report included a catalogue of plants collected along with 10 black and white plates for illustration.

During the late summer of 1855, Gray made his third trip to Europe. This was an emergency trip to bring his ill brother-in-law home from Paris. Gray spent only three weeks in London and Paris, and on the way back he read the newly published &quot;Géographie botanique raisonnée&quot; by Alphonse deCandolle. This was a ground-breaking book that for the first time brought together the large mass of data being collected by the expeditions of the time. The natural sciences had become highly specialized, yet this book synthesized them to explain living organisms within their environment and why plants were distributed the way they were, all upon a geologic scale. Gray instantly saw that this brought taxonomic botany into focus.

Despite Gray constantly seeking collectors and people to help him with the Harvard herbarium, in the first fifteen years he was at Harvard, no graduate entered botany as a career. This changed in 1858 with the arrival of Daniel Cady Eaton, who had graduated from Yale University in 1857 and came to Harvard to study with Gray. Eaton later returned to Yale to be a botany professor and oversee its herbarium, just as Gray did at Harvard. Daniel Eaton was the grandson of Amos Eaton, whose textbooks Gray had studied during his college days. Eaton influenced the teaching style of Gray, and both required practical work of their students. Gray retained the Fisher post until 1873 while living in the Asa Gray House.

In 1859 Gray was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The National Academy of Sciences was created by Congress on March 3, 1863, and he was one of the original 50 members. In 1864 Gray donated 200,000 plant specimens and 2,200 books to Harvard with the condition that the herbarium and garden be built. This effectively created the botany department at Harvard, and the Gray Herbarium was named after him. He was president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1872 and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 1863–1873. Gray was also a regent at the Smithsonian Institution in 1874–1888 and a foreign member of the Royal Society of London in 1873.

The &quot;Elements of Botany&quot; (1836), an introductory textbook, was the first of Gray&#x27;s many works. In this book Gray espoused the idea that botany was useful not only to medicine, but also to farmers. Gray and Torrey published the &quot;Flora of North America&quot; together in 1838. By the mid-1850s the demands of teaching, research, gardening, collecting, and corresponding had become so great, and he had become so influential, that Gray wrote two high school-level texts in the late 1850s: &quot;First Lessons in Botany and Vegetable Physiology&quot; (1857) and &quot;How Plants Grow: A Simple Introduction to Structural Botany&quot; (1858). The publishers pressured Gray to make these two books non-technical enough so that high school students and non-scientists could understand them. As with most scientists in American academic institutions, Gray found it difficult to concentrate purely on research.

Gray met physician and botanist George Engelmann in the early 1840s, and they remained friends and colleagues until Engelmann died in 1884. Torrey was an early American supporter of the &quot;natural system of classification&quot;, which relies upon geography and a plant&#x27;s entire structure, and as his assistant, Gray was a proponent of this system, too. This contrasts with Linnaeus&#x27; artificial classification, which was designed for ease of use and focused on readily observed aspects of a plant, particularly the differences in the flowers. Amos Eaton was also a proponent of the artificial system. Gray was so impressed with Wilhelm Nikolaus Suksdorf, a largely self-taught immigrant from Germany who specialized in the flora of the Pacific Northwest, that he had Suksdorf come to Harvard to be his assistant and named the genus &quot;Suksdorfia&quot; after him.

Gray was a leading opponent of the Scientific Lazzaroni, a group of mostly physical scientists who wanted American academia to mimic the autocratic academic structures of European universities. A large percentage of the original 50 members of the National Academy of Sciences were Lazzaroni members. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences was opposed to the National Academy and collectively elected Gray and his friend, colleague, and fellow Charles Darwin supporter William Barton Rogers to the National Academy. Rogers founded the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is one of the areas where Gray and his friend and colleague, Louis Agassiz, were in disagreement; Agassiz was a member of the Lazzaroni group. Agassiz had come to lecture at the Lowell Institute in 1846 and got hired by Harvard in 1847. Gray befriended him the way he had been befriended during his trip to Europe.

Gray abhorred slavery. In his view, science proved the unity of all man because all human races can interbreed and produce fertile offspring, i.e., all members of a species are connected genetically. He also felt Christianity taught the unity of man. He was not an abolitionist, feeling it was more important to preserve the Union, yet he also felt if the South persevered in the conflict, every slave should be set free, by use of more force if necessary. However, he was not sure what should be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.

During the American Civil War, Gray was a steadfast supporter of the North and the Republican Party. About February 1861two months before the war startedGray lost part of his left thumb, just above the base of the nail, in an accident in the garden. Despite now being 50 years old, he regretted that this accident ended his &quot;fighting days&quot;. After hostilities began, he joined a company that guarded the Massachusetts State Arsenal in Cambridge. He also bought war bonds, was surprised more people did not do likewise, and supported a 5%tax to support the war. Gray regretted not having children because he had &quot;no son to send to the war&quot;. Gray considered Abraham Lincoln as a second George Washington because of the way he managed to preserve the Union during the war. He also predicted that the fate of slavery depended upon the length and bitterness of the war, and the longer it lasted the more disastrous it would be for the South. As a corollary, he felt that if the South had given up early in the war, they would have had a chance of preserving slavery longer. Regarding his botanical endeavors, the war sundered his supply of information and specimens from the South. Even the Southern botanists who supported the North, such as Alvan Wentworth Chapman and Thomas Minott Peters, were soon forced to cease communications with Gray. It was during the war that Gray first began to think of retiring from his professorial duties so he could concentrate on completing &quot;Flora of North America&quot;.

Harvard was able to secure substantial new funding for its botanical programs in the years after the war, but Gray encountered significant trouble finding a suitable replacement for his professorial duties. The American university system had failed to train replacements for its professors. Only Harvard and Yale had botany programs, and in the war and pre-war years there had been few botany students. However, after the war there was an upswing in the numbers of botany students. Gray was grooming Horace Mann Jr. as his replacement, but he died of tuberculosis at the age of 24 in November 1868.

Growing weary of his workload, Gray and his wife departed on a trip to Britain, Egypt (for three months), and Switzerland in September 1868. It was during the winter spent in Egypt that Gray first grew his white beard. They returned in autumn 1869. In early 1872 Gray tried to resign his professorship and garden duties still with no replacement for himself. He proposed only looking after the herbarium and writing books in exchange for the rent of the house in which he and his wife lived on the university grounds. Due to the way the finances of the funding sources were handled and the lack of a replacement, Gray was unable to resign at that time.

In late 1872 Charles Sprague Sargent was appointed director of the Botanic Garden, the newly constructed Arnold Arboretum, and new botany-related buildings. This freed up much of Gray&#x27;s time. Also, late in 1872, Ignatius Sargent, Charles&#x27; father, and Horatio Hollis Hunnewell both agreed to donate $500 yearly each to support Gray so that he could devote &quot;undivided attention&quot; to completing &quot;Flora of North America&quot;. This is what finally allowed Gray to resign his professorship and devote all his time to research and writing.

Harvard had so much trouble finding a replacement for Gray that they considered hiring a European, but they found an American and hired George Lincoln Goodale in late 1872. Goodale had a medical degree from Harvard and a solid knowledge of botany. By late June 1873 Goodale had enough experience that Gray was excited to pronounce he had taught his last class. William Gilson Farlow also had a medical degree from Harvard and had studied botany. He became Gray&#x27;s assistant in 1870 after obtaining his medical degree and then studied in Europe for a few years. He returned to Harvard in 1874 and became a botany professor. Sereno Watson began helping Gray with taxonomy in 1872 and became the herbarium curator. The reorganization of botany at Harvard in the early 1870s was a major accomplishment of Gray&#x27;s.

===&quot;Asa Gray disjunction&quot;===
Gray worked extensively on a phenomenon that is now called the &quot;Asa Gray disjunction&quot;, namely, the surprising morphological similarities between many eastern Asian and eastern North American plants. In fact, Gray felt the flora of eastern North America is more similar to the flora of Japan than it is to the flora of western North America, but more recent studies have shown this is not so. While Gray was not the first botanist to notice this (it was first noticed in the early 18thcentury), beginning in the early 1840s he brought scientific focus to the issue. He was the first scientist in the world to possess the requisite knowledge set to do so as he had intimate knowledge of the northeast and southeast United States as well as eastern Asiadue to several contacts he had there. The phenomenon involves about 65genera and is not limited to plants, but also includes fungi, arachnids, millipedes, insects, and freshwater fishes. It was believed that each pair of species might be international sister species, but it is now known that this is not generally the case; the species involved are less closely related to one another. Today, botanists suggest three possible causes for the observed morphological similarity, which probably developed at different times and via different pathways; the species pairs are: (1)the products of similar environmental conditions in separate locations, (2)relics of species that were formerly widely distributed but diversified later, (3)not as morphologically similar as was previously believed. Gray&#x27;s work in this area gave significant support to Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution and is one of the hallmarks of Gray&#x27;s career. In 1880 David P. Penhallow was accepted by Gray as a research assistant. Penhallow aided in Gray&#x27;s work regarding the distribution of northern hemisphere plants, and in 1882 Gray recommended Penhallow as a lecturer to Sir John Dawson of McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

===Later career===
Despite no longer having the burden of his professorial and garden duties, by the late 1870s the burden of maintaining himself as the pillar of American botany prevented Gray from the progress he desired on &quot;Synoptical Flora of North America&quot;, the follow-on to &quot;Flora of North America&quot;. This burden consisted of the fact that other scientists often only accepted Gray&#x27;s word on a botanical matter, and the number of incoming specimens to identify was increasing vastly: numbers had to be assigned to them, collectors needed to be corresponded with, and preliminary papers had to be published. By the early 1880s, Gray&#x27;s home was the center of everything to do with botany in America. Every aspiring botanist came to see him, even if just to look at him through his window.

After turning over his non-research duties to Sargent, Goodale, Farlow, and Watson, Gray concentrated more on research and writing, especially on plant taxonomy, as well as lecturing around the country, largely promoting Darwinian ideas. Many of his lectures during this time were given at the Yale Divinity School. Liberty Hyde Bailey worked as Gray&#x27;s herbarium assistant for two years during 1883–1884.

In spring 1887 Gray and his wife made their last trip to Europe, this one for six months from April–October, primarily to see Hooker.

Gray received the following advanced degrees: honorary degree of Master of Arts (1844) and Doctor of Laws (1875) from Harvard, and Doctor of Laws from Hamilton College (New York) (1860), McGill University (1884), and the University of Michigan (1887).

==Research regarding the American West==
Prior to 1840, besides what he had discovered during his trip to Europe, Gray&#x27;s knowledge of the flora of the American West was limited to what he could learn from Edwin James, who had been on the expedition to the West of Major Stephen Harriman Long, and from Thomas Nuttall, who had been on an expedition to the Pacific coast with Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth. In the latter half of 1840, Gray met the German-American botanist and physician George Engelmann in New York City. Engelmann took frequent trips to explore the American West and northern Mexico. The two remained close friends and botanical collaborators. Engelmann would send specimens to Gray, who would classify them and act as a sales agent. Their collaborations greatly enhanced botanical knowledge of those areas. Another German-American botanist, Ferdinand Lindheimer, collaborated with both Engelmann and Gray, focusing on collecting plants in Texas, hoping to find specimens with &quot;no Latin names&quot;. This cooperation resulted in issuing the exsiccata-like series &quot;Lindheimer Flora Texana exsiccata&quot;. Another long-term and productive collaboration was with Charles Wright, who collected in Texas and New Mexico on two separate expeditions in 1849 and 1851–1852. These trips resulted in publication of the two-volume &quot;Plantae Wrightianae&quot; in 1852–1853.

Gray traveled to the American West on two separate occasions, the first in 1872 by train, and then again with Joseph Dalton Hooker, son of William Hooker, in 1877. His wife accompanied him on both trips. Both times his goal was botanical research, and he avidly collected plant specimens to bring back with him to Harvard. On his second trip through the American West, he and Hooker reportedly collected over 1,000 specimens. Gray&#x27;s and Hooker&#x27;s research was reported in their joint 1880 publication, &quot;The Vegetation of the Rocky Mountain Region and a Comparison with that of Other Parts of the World,&quot; which appeared in volume six of Hayden&#x27;s &quot;Bulletin of the United States Geological and Geophysical Survey of the Territories&quot;.

On both trips he climbed Grays Peak, one of Colorado&#x27;s many fourteeners. His wife climbed Grays Peak with him in 1872. This mountain was named after Gray by the botanist and explorer of the Rocky Mountains Charles Christopher Parry.

Prior to the 1870s, collecting in the western part of the country required slow horses, wagons, and often military escorts. But by this time, permanent settlements and railroads resulted in so many specimens coming in that Gray alone could not keep up with them. One of the post-war collectors who worked extensively with Gray was John Gill Lemmon, husband of fellow botanist Sara Plummer Lemmon. Gray named a new genus &quot;Plummera&quot;, now called &quot;Hymenoxys&quot;, in Sara&#x27;s honor. 

==Relationship with Darwin==
Gray and Joseph Dalton Hooker went to visit Richard Owen at London&#x27;s Hunterian Museum in January 1839. Gray met Charles Darwin during lunch that day at Kew Gardens, apparently introduced by Hooker. Darwin found a kindred spirit in Gray, as they both had an empirical approach to science, and first wrote to him in April 1855. During 1855–1881 they exchanged about 300 letters. Darwin then wrote to Gray requesting information about the distribution of various species of American flowers, which Gray provided, and which was helpful for the development of Darwin&#x27;s theory. This was the beginning of an extensive lifelong correspondence.

Gray, Darwin, and Hooker became lifelong friends and colleagues, and Gray and Hooker conducted research on Darwin&#x27;s behalf in 1877 on their Rocky Mountain expedition. After Hooker returned to England and reported to Darwin on their adventure, Darwin wrote back to Gray: &quot;I have just ... heard prodigies of your strength &amp; activity. That you run up a mountain like a cat!&quot;

Before 1846, Gray had been firmly opposed to the idea of transmutation of species, in which simpler forms naturally become more complex over time, including via hybridization. By the early 1850s, Gray had clearly defined his concept that the species is the basic unit of taxonomy. This was partly the result of the 1831–1836 voyage during which Darwin discovered the differentiation of species among the various Galápagos Islands. Local geography could produce variances, like in the Galápagos and Hawaii, which Gray did not get to study in depth as he had wanted. Gray was insistent that a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species, that like begat like. This concept was critical to Darwin&#x27;s theories. Gray was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation in the sense of its not allowing for evolution.

When Darwin received Alfred Russel Wallace&#x27;s paper that described natural selection, Hooker and Charles Lyell arranged for a joint reading of papers by Darwin and Wallace to the Linnean Society on July 1, 1858. Since Darwin had nothing prepared, the reading included excerpts from his 1844 &quot;Essay&quot; and from a letter he had sent to Asa Gray in July 1857 outlining his theory on the origin of species. By that time, Darwin had begun writing his book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;. The correspondence with Gray was thus a key piece of evidence in establishing Darwin&#x27;s intellectual priority with respect to the theory of evolution by natural selection. Neither Darwin nor Wallace attended the meeting. The papers were published by the society as &quot;On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection&quot;. By summer 1859 it was obvious to Gray and others working with Darwin that &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; would be a ground-breaking book.

Darwin published &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; on November 24, 1859. The first printing was 1,250 copies, with some having been sent to America via ship, one of which was for Gray. Gray&#x27;s copy arrived just before Christmas, and he read it between Christmas and New Year. Since there was no international copyright law at the time, Gray worked to protect the book from publishing piracy. According to American law at the time, a copyright could only be secured by an American edition being published by an American citizen, and royalties were not required to be paid to the author. Gray arranged the first American edition of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; and was able to negotiate royalties on Darwin&#x27;s behalf. Gray took a 5%royalty from the publisher, and Darwin was so grateful for Gray&#x27;s efforts that he offered Gray some of his royalties. Darwin held Gray in high esteem: he dedicated his book &quot;Forms of Flowers&quot; (1877) to Gray, and he wrote in 1881, &quot;there is hardly any one in the world whose approbation I value more highly than I do yours.&quot; Seeing the &quot;unity we perceive in nature&quot; and law in the universe, regarding all species he felt &quot;that they not only &quot;had&quot; a Creator but &quot;have&quot; a Governor.&quot; Gray and Agassiz strongly disagreed; Agassiz was adamantly opposed to the idea of evolution, whereas Gray was a staunch supporter, believing in theistic evolution. As the debate raged over Darwin&#x27;s theories, the rift between Gray and Agassiz grew deeper, and they were estranged by December 1863, when Gray was elected president of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, which also marked Agassiz&#x27; increasing isolation within the scientific community. Gray showed little interest in scientific politics and resigned from the National Academy of Sciences in 1867. In late 1866 Agassiz apologized to Gray and the two were at least civil to one another again.

Gray, considered by Darwin to be his friend and &quot;best advocate&quot;, also attempted to convince Darwin in his letters that design was inherent in all forms of life, and to return to his faith. Gray saw nature as filled with &quot;unmistakable and irresistible indications of design&quot; and argued that &quot;God himself is the very last, irreducible causal factor and, hence, the source of all evolutionary change.&quot; Darwin agreed that his theories were &quot;not at all necessarily atheistical&quot; but was unable to share Gray&#x27;s belief. &quot;I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton,&quot; he wrote. Gray was a Christian, but he was a staunch supporter of Darwin in America. He collected together a number of his own writings to produce an influential book, &quot;Darwiniana&quot; (1876); these essays argued for a conciliation between Darwinian evolution and the tenets of theism, at a time when many on both sides perceived the two as mutually exclusive. Gray denied that investigation of physical causes stood opposed to the theological view and the study of the harmonies between mind and Nature, and thought it &quot;most presumable that an intellectual conception realized in Nature would be realized through natural agencies&quot;. The result of all this is that Gray distanced himself from Social Darwinism. Gray is a critical link in the history of American intellectualism, and his writings that explain how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive have been considered his supreme accomplishment; thereby providing a way for believers in Creationism to consider Darwin&#x27;s ideas.

In 1868, Gray had a year&#x27;s leave of absence and visited Darwin in England, the first time they had met since they started their correspondence. Darwin had Gray in mind when he wrote, &quot;It seems to me absurd to doubt that a man may be an ardent theist &amp; an evolutionist.&quot; Darwin dedicated his 1877 book, &quot;The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species&quot;, to Gray, &quot;as a small tribute of respect and affection&quot;. One area where Darwin and Gray disagreed was Darwin&#x27;s theory of pangenesis. The Grays embarked on a study visit to Europe during 1880 and 1881, including a final visit to Darwin at his Down House home. Darwin died in 1882.

==Personal life==
Gray became engaged to Jane Lathrop Loring of Boston in May 1847. Two of Gray&#x27;s younger brothers, George and Joseph, were students at Harvard in the late 1840s and lived with Gray. During his junior year, George caught typhoid fever in late 1847 and died on January 9, 1848, in the Loring house in Boston. This is part of the reason Gray&#x27;s marriage was delayed from fall 1847 to spring 1848. Gray and Jane Loring married on May 4, 1848. Her parents were Charles Greely Loring (1794–1867), a member of the Harvard Corporation and a lawyer, and Anna Pierce (Brace) Loring. Her family was Unitarian, like most faculty and staff of Harvard at the time. Both of them kept to their separate religious denominations yet seem to have had no difficulties over it. They had no children. Jane Gray accompanied her husband on most of his expeditions. Gray was a devout Presbyterian and was a member of First Church in Cambridge, a Congregational church, where he served as a deacon. He was also an ardent empiricist in the tradition of John Locke and John Stuart Mill. When the congregation moved into its present building in 1872, at 11Garden Street, Gray planted two Kentucky yellowwood trees, &quot;Cladrastis kentukea&quot;, in front of the church. They stood until October 2014.

==Death==
On Monday, November 28, 1887, Gray&#x27;s hand and arm became paralyzed while he was coming down the stairs for breakfast. Even though the paralysis worsened, he was able to address two letters. On Thursday he lost the ability to speak in a steady rhythm. He lay speechless and quiet for two months, and died on January 30, 1888. He was buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery. He wanted a simple gravestone, so his wife had it engraved with a cross and &quot;Asa Gray 1810–1888&quot;. The cemetery&#x27;s Asa Gray Garden, with a central fountain and numerous unusual tree varieties, is named in his honor.

==Legacy==
===Life work===
In addition to the &quot;Asa Gray disjunction&quot;, one of Gray&#x27;s greatest achievements was the vast network of scientists he built who all communicated with one another and exchanged ideas. He is considered the preeminent American botanist of the 19thcentury.

On Gray&#x27;s 75th birthday, botanists led by editors of the &quot;Botanical Gazette&quot; presented Gray with a silver vase with the inscription &quot;1810, November eighteenth, 1885. Asa Gray, in token of the universal esteem of American Botanists.&quot; An accompanying silver salver had the inscription &quot;Bearing the greetings of one hundred and eighty botanists of North America to Asa Gray on his 75th birthday, Nov.18, 1885.&quot;

Also received on his 75th birthday was a poem by James Russell Lowell:
&lt;poem&gt;
:Just fate, prolong his life, well spent,
:Whose indefatigable hours
:Have been as gayly innocent,
:And fragrant as his flowers.
&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="443029" wikidata="Q1141798" url="?curid=443029" title="Yōko Nagayama">
<text>is a Japanese &quot;enka&quot; singer, former J-pop singer, and actress.

== Early life ==
Nagayama was born in Tokyo. At the age of four, she began attending min&#x27;yo group singing lessons with her father. Although she originally went because she enjoyed the attention from her father&#x27;s classmates, she soon began studying and performing min&#x27;yo together with her father. When she was ten, she started playing shamisen. Her father gave her a shamisen that she still uses today.

She is married to American entrepreneur Mark Smith, president of IT staffing firm Skillhouse Staffing Solutions.

== J-pop era ==
Nagayama continued singing and performing through her junior high school years. Her plan was to become a professional enka singer after finishing junior high school. However, when she was sixteen, her handlers told her and her parents that she was too young to sing enka. Despite her father&#x27;s wishes, she then decided to become a J-pop idol singer.

Her debut song was &quot;Haru wa SA-RA SA-RA&quot; (春はSA-RA SA-RA), released in 1984. It was not well received, nor were her releases over the next two years. However, in 1986, Nagayama had her first big hit with a cover version of British girl group Bananarama&#x27;s dance-pop take on Shocking Blue&#x27;s &quot;Venus&quot;. Her next song, &quot;You&#x27;re My Love,&quot; a cover of the Eurodisco hit, was also popular. Five of her songs (&quot;Venus&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re My Love&quot;, &quot;Kanashiki Koibitotachi&quot;, &quot;Heart ni Hi o Tsukete&quot;, and &quot;Hangyaku no Hero&quot;) were all Oricon top 10 hits.

During this time, Nagayama also performed in various dramas, such as the &quot;jidaigeki&quot; &quot;Sanbiki ga Kiru!&quot;, &quot;Minipato yori Ai o Komete&quot;, and &quot;Yūwaku&quot;.

== Enka era ==
In 1993, she started a second career as an enka singer. She received three prizes for her first &quot;enka&quot; song &quot;Higurashi&quot; (蜩). &quot;Suterarete&quot; (捨てられて) also became famous.

Nagayama continues to play the shamisen in many of her songs. Notable songs with shamisen parts are &quot;Jonkara Onnabushi&quot; (じょんから女節) and &quot;Usoda to Itte&quot; (噓だといって), the latter having been posted on YouTube under the title &quot;DEATH BY SHAMISEN&quot;.

She regularly presents enka programmes on Japanese TV. Nagayama has had at least one song appear on the NHK program &quot;Minna no Uta&quot;. In 1993, she made her first appearance on the NHK New Year&#x27;s Eve spectacular Kōhaku Uta Gassen. Since 1995, she has performed at &quot;Kōhaku&quot; for 13 consecutive years, making a total of 14 appearances to date.

On April 6, 2009 she announced on her blog that she has married American entrepreneur Mark Smith. They have one daughter, born in 2010.

<text>Onizuka Air Force Station or Onizuka AFS was a U.S. Air Force installation in Sunnyvale, California, at the intersection of State Route 237 and North Mathilda Avenue. It operated from 1960 to 2010.

One of its distinguishing feature was Building 1003, known locally as the Blue Cube and the &quot;Cube&quot; given its shape, color, and lack of windows. The station&#x27;s other distinguishing features were its three primary parabolic dish antennas, used for communication with remote tracking stations used to control military satellites; these antennas were named Sun East, Sun West, and Sun 3.

==History==
In the United States space program&#x27;s formative stages, Air Force Systems Command (AFSC) contracted with the Philco Ford division of Ford Motor Company to provide interim operational facilities at its Palo Alto, California, location. Operation began in the late 1950s. By 1958, the US Air Force sought a permanent home, with larger facilities. Ultimately, the Air Force purchased from Lockheed Corporation about of land, which included Lockheed Building 100 and was named Sunnyvale Air Force Station. Construction of the station&#x27;s original facilities was completed in 1960. More structures were built as operations expanded.

The station was home to the AFSC operational unit known as the Air Force Satellite Test Center (STC, colloquially called the &quot;stick&quot;), and other non-AFSC operational organizations. By 1979, the Air Force Satellite Test Center was renamed the Air Force Satellite Control Facility.

In 1986 the base was renamed in honor of Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Ellison S. Onizuka, an astronaut who died in the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster on January 28, 1986.

Onizuka AFS and the Air Force Satellite Control Facility were transferred from Air Force Systems Command to Air Force Space Command and operated by the 21st Space Operations Squadron, a geographically separated unit (GSU) of the 50th Space Wing. The non-AFSC operational organizations remained under their respective commands.

==Closure==
When the station was opened in 1960, the Sunnyvale area was rural and the station was predominantly surrounded by orchards. By the late 1970s, the region had become Silicon Valley and the station&#x27;s physical security vulnerabilities became apparent. AFSC therefore planned the Consolidated Space Operations Center (CSOC), which would lie several miles east of Colorado Springs, Colorado, at the to-be-built Falcon Air Force Station (later renamed Schriever Air Force Base). Spacecraft operations would be split between the two locations and each location would serve as a backup to the other. To maintain this redundancy, when Onizuka AFS was selected for closure by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, the Air Force determined to move Onizuka&#x27;s remaining operational units to the new Ellison Onizuka Satellite Operations Facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base. 

Realignment of Onizuka Air Force Station was recommended and accepted as part of the 1995 round of the Base Realignment and Closure Program. The 750th Space Group was to be inactivated and its functions moved to Falcon AFS. Detachment 2 of the Space and Missile Systems Center would move to Falcon AFB and Kirtland AFB, New Mexico; some other, undisclosed tenants would stay in the existing facilities for some time. On May 13, 2005, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld recommended closing the Onizuka Air Force Station in Sunnyvale as part of a fifth round of military base closures and re-sizing. The date by which the realignment and closure must be completed was September 15, 2011.

In April 2007, the mission of the National Reconnaissance Office at Onizuka AFS ended after 46 years.

Upon completion of this transition, Onizuka AFS was ceremonially closed on July 28, 2010, and officially closed on September 30, 2010.

=== Demolition ===
In April 2014, demolition of the site began. of the land was earmarked for conversion to educational space operated by the Foothill–De Anza Community College District. of the land was to be used by the Department of Veterans Affairs. was added to Sunnyvale&#x27;s existing Fire Station 5 and was subject to a land swap with a developer to relocate Fire Station 5, upgrade it to full service capabilities, and support a shooting range for public safety personnel training. The remaining parcel is now owned by the City of Sunnyvale for an unspecified future use.

<text>The prairie warbler (Setophaga discolor) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family.

==Description==
These birds have yellow underparts with dark streaks on the flanks, and olive overparts with rusty streaks on the back; they have a yellow line above the eye, a dark line through it, and a yellow spot below it. These birds have black legs, long tails, two pale wing bars, and thin pointed bills. Coloring is duller in female and immatures.

===Measurements===
===Vocalizations===
Prairie warblers have two categories of songs, referred to as Type A and Type B. Type A songs are typically a series of ascending buzzy notes. The B songs are an ascending series of whistled notes that often contain some buzzy notes. Compared to A songs, the B songs are lower in pitch, have fewer, longer notes. The total song length is longer as well in Type B songs. The use of these two song categories is associated with certain contexts. A songs are sung throughout the day when males first arrive on their breeding grounds. Once males are paired they begin to sing B songs during the dawn chorus and then will intersperse A songs in their singing during the rest of the day. During this later period of singing A songs are typically used near females, near the nest, and in the center of their territories. In contrast B songs are used when interacting or fighting with other males and near the borders of their territories.

Part of their call note repertoire is a &quot;tsip&quot; call. During dawn, chorus B songs are interspersed with rapid loud &quot;check&quot; calls.

==Distribution and habitat==
These birds are permanent residents in the southern parts of their range. Other birds migrate to north-eastern Mexico and islands in the Caribbean.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
Their breeding habitats are brushy areas and forest edges in eastern North America. The prairie warbler&#x27;s nests are open cups, which are usually placed in a low area of a tree or shrub. Incubation period is 12 to 13 days.

===Feeding===
Prairie warblers forage actively on tree branches, and sometimes fly around with the purpose of catching insects, which are the main food source of these birds.

===Behaviour===
These birds wag their tails frequently.

==Status==
The numbers of these birds are declining due to habitat loss; this species also suffers from nest parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird.

<text>The Cévennes ( , ; ) is a cultural region and range of mountains in south-central France, on the south-east edge of the Massif Central. It covers parts of the &quot;départements&quot; of Ardèche, Gard, Hérault and Lozère. Rich in geographical, natural, and cultural significance, portions of the region are protected within the Cévennes National Park, the Cévennes Biosphere Reserve (UNESCO), as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site: Causses and the Cévennes, Mediterranean agro-pastoral Cultural Landscape. The area has been inhabited since 400,000 BCE and has numerous megaliths which were erected beginning around 2500 BCE. As an agriculturally-rich area, but not a suitable location for cities, the Cévennes developed a wide diversity of pastoral systems, including transhumance. The irrigation and road networks put in place in the early Middle Ages for these pastoral systems are still in use today.

The name &quot;Cévennes&quot; comes from the Gaulish &quot;Cebenna&quot;. As of 1999, there were 165,707 inhabitants in the region, with 20,847 living inside the UNESCO protected zone. Inhabitants of the region are known as Cévenols, from the adjective Cévenol (fem. Cévenole).

The mountain range also gives its name to a meteorological effect when cold air from the Atlantic coast meets warm air of southern winds from the Mediterranean and causes heavy autumnal downpours, often leading to floods. These are called &quot;épisodes cévenols&quot;.

==Defining the Cévennes==
===Etymology===
The origin of the name &quot;Cévennes&quot; is Celtic, coming from the Gaulish &quot;Cebenna&quot;, which was Latinized by Julius Caesar as &quot;Cevenna&quot;. The Cévennes are named Cemmenon (&quot;Κέμμενων&quot;) in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot;.
The word in Gaulish probably meant &quot;ridgeline&quot; and is related to the Breton word &#x27; meaning back. The &quot;-&quot; part of the name is likely related to the Gaelic word &#x27; meaning mountain or hill.

There are several popular false etymologies, one of which is that the name is derived for the words &quot;seven veins&quot; (&quot;sept veines&quot; in French) which is supposed to be a reference to the seven rivers (veins) flowing through the region. Historical references to the name that predate the French Language itself, preclude this possibility. Another false etymology suggests that the name comes from the Occitan word &#x27; (also written &#x27;) which means &quot;onion&quot;, which is supposed to reference the layered structure of slate which makes up the mountains. But this is not possible as the Occitan &#x27; derives from Latin &#x27; which does not phonetically fit the references to the region in Latin and Greek Literature. Additionally, the suffix &quot;-enna&quot;, originally Celtic, was brought over into Latin, and was never used for words of Latin origin.

==Geography==
===Extent===
In the larger sense, the Cévennes include nine départements: le Tarn, l&#x27;Aude, l&#x27;Hérault, l&#x27;Aveyron, le Gard, la Lozère, l&#x27;Ardèche, le Rhône and la Loire. More strictly the Cévennes encompasses the Lozère and the Gard. The Parc national des Cévennes is almost entirely within Lozère.

The principal towns and villages of the Cévennes are Alès, Le Vigan, Sumène, Valleraugue, Ganges, Hérault, Saint-Hippolyte-du-Fort, Sauve, Lasalle, Saint-André-de-Valborgne, Saint-Jean-du-Gard, Anduze, Florac, Saint-Germain-de-Calberte, le Pont-de-Montvert, Villefort, Génolhac, Bessèges, Saint-Ambroix, Gagnières, Les Vans, Mende.

===Description===

The Cévennes mountains run from southwest (Grandes causses (Causses de Blandas and Larzac) to northeast (Monts du Vivarais), with the highest point being the Mont Lozère (1699m). The Mont Aigoual (1567m) is on the border of two departments. The Loire and Allier flowing towards the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Ardèche and tributary Chassezac, Cèze, the different rivers Gardons to the Rhône, Vidourle, Hérault and Dourbie that flow to the Mediterranean Sea, have their headwaters in the Cévennes. Cévennes National Park was created in the region in 1970 and the Parc Naturel Régional des Monts d&#x27;Ardèche also preserves some of the natural areas. Two canyons are near the region: the Gorges de la Jonte (the Jonte gorge) and the Gorges du Tarn (the Tarn gorge). This is a socio-economic marginal region, while bio-geographically, there is altitudinal stratification and a gradient between the mountainous centre and the mediterranean littoral ecologies.

===Geology===

The Cévennes form the south eastern fragment of the Massif Central, separated from the related Montagne Noire by the limestone Causses. The basement rocks of granites and schists were uplifted by the Variscan orogeny forming a discontinuity, with the subsequent erosion infilling the lower voids for much of Permian and Triassic period (280–195 Ma), while changing sea levels added a thick limestone covering, with only the tops of the Cévennes protruding as islands in the Jurassic sea. This in turn was eroded, The Cévennes forms the watershed between the Atlantic and Mediterranean. In late Cretaceous and early Tertiary times further mountain building occurred. The Alpine orogeny lifted and deformed the Alps and the Pyrenees though the Massif Central acted as a rigid block, and the cover rocks remained mostly horizontal. Some have been folded through later faulting at the time of the opening of the western Mediterranean in Tertiary times. The principal rivers of the region have cut deeply into the limestone forming deep gorges: Gorges du Tarn, Gorges de la Jonte, Lot, Gorges de l&#x27;Ardèche, Cèze etc.

==Population and history==
===Prehistory===

Transhumance is most likely the beginning of human activity in the Cévennes but little trace has been found of humans from the Paleolithic era except in the southern portion around Ganges and Saint-Hippolyte-du-Fort which contains a large quantity of caves rich with archeological evidence such as &quot;La Roque Aynier&quot; (Ganges), and &quot;Baume Dolente&quot; (Vebron) which suggest the presence of Magdalenian peoples (17,000–12,000 BCE).

By the Neolithic epoch, which lasted from about 12,000 BCE to around 2,300 BCE in France (), transhumance and hunting were prevalent throughout the entire Cévennes with developments such as pottery moving from south to north in the region. Sheep were common in Mediterranean France before 7000 BCE and numerous prehistoric pots and tools have been recovered dating from as early as 4000 BCE. Around this time many Megalithic constructions such as stone circles, dolmen, and menhirs appeared in the area, with the second largest megalithic site in Europe, the stone rows of , being created around 3,000–2,500 BCE, and important sites such as the stone circles around Blandas in the south appearing between 3,500–2,500 BCE.

===Ancient===
The Celts arrived in the area sometime in the Iron Age between 800–400 BCE, and most of what is known about their presence in the area is from Latin historians. In the 3rd century BCE, the Arverne Confederation was formed of several tribes who used the Cévennes as a defensive feature to prevent the Romans from taking their territories. By the time the Romans successfully conquered the area in 121 BC, several tribes of celtic Gauls were living around the Cévennes: the Ruteni in the west, the Gabali in the north, the Volcae Arecomici in the south, the Helvii in the southeast and the Vellavi in the northeast. The Volcae Arecomici voluntarily surrendered their territory to the Romans, and the Arverni gave up much territory in a treaty that nevertheless preserved their independence.

Under Roman control, Le Vigan was part of the Roman &quot;Provincia,&quot; (hence Provence) called Gallia Narbonensis. Julius Caesar crossed the Cévennes mountains in the winter of 52 BCE, having his soldiers clear paths in up to six feet of snow, to attack the Averne Confederation.

The Visigoths took control of the western half of Gallia Narbonensis in 462 CE, a part known as Septimania which included Le Vigan, and they retained control despite attempts in 586 and 589 CE when the Frankish, Merovingian King Guntram attempted to conquer the area from the north.

===Middle Ages===
In 587 the region came under Catholic rule with the conversion of the Visigoth king Reccared I. In 719, the Moor Al-Samh conquered Septimania as part of the Umayyad invasion of Gaul and the Franks struggled to take it back over the next several decades, but the southern slopes of the Cévennes were permanently reconquered by 752. King Pepin the Short reconquered the whole of Septimania in 759.

In the High Middle Ages, the region saw the flourishing of Romanesque architecture and monastic implantation, like Mazan Abbey. It was during this time that large-scale clearings took place under the lead of abbots and monks, allowing more space to be cultivated by the local people.

The northern part of the region suffered greatly from the Hundred Years War. The English and their mercenaries occupied the Gevaudan and raided the Velay. In 1380 Bertrand Duguesclin died of illness while besieging Chateauneuf-de-Randon, a fortified city then under English occupation.

=== The &quot;Desert&quot; period and the Camisards War===
French Protestants, also called the Huguenots, were established in the Cévennes by the beginning of the 16th century. They were often persecuted and lacked the freedom to worship openly, so they kept away from cities. They worshiped in deserted wilderness areas: forests, caves, and gullies. The Edict of Nantes in 1598 gave some relief and freedom of worship to Protestants but also concentrated the power of the Catholic Church in France.

The Edict of Fontainebleau, on October 1685, revoked the Edict of Nantes, and forbade Protestant worship services. It called for the destruction of temples, exiling pastors, and forced Catholic instruction on the children. The borders were closed in response to the exodus of Huguenots from the area and the resulting economic losses. The Huguenots who stayed resisted and, known as Camisards in the Cévennes, they took up arms to fight for their religious freedom. As many as 3,000 Protestants fought against 30,000 royal troops from 1702 till 1704. Sporadic fighting continued until 1715. The Edict of Versailles in 1787, and the French Revolution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in 1789, finally brought a political solution to the struggles and gave non-Catholics the right to practice their religion openly.

===Modern===
In the 21st century, the region still has a large community of French Protestants. They identify as Huguenots, descendants of peoples who have inhabited the mountains since before the 16th century. During the reign of Louis XIV, much of the Huguenot population fled France, particularly following the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. The Protestant community in the Cévennes largely remained in place, protected from attack by the hilly terrain. This area became a refuge from persecution for other Huguenots during the time.

In 1702, this Huguenot population, dubbed the Camisards, rose up against the monarchy to protect their religious freedom. The two sides agreed to peace in 1715, which enabled the local Protestant Huguenot population to continue living in the Cévennes. Their descendants have continued to live there to the present day.

During World War II, a network of families in the Cévennes sheltered a number of Jews from capture by the Nazis. These efforts, organized by local Protestant pastors, ultimately protected hundreds from capture and likely death.

<text>Franz Antel (28 June 1913 – 11 August 2007) was a veteran Austrian filmmaker.

Born in Vienna, Antel worked mainly as a film producer in the interwar years. After World War II, he began writing and directing films on a large scale. In the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s these were mainly comedies (romantic, slapstick, and/or musical) and &quot;K.u.k. films&quot; all of which, for Austrian and German TV stations alike, have been a staple of weekend afternoon programming ever since. In between there is quite a sober film about the Oberst (Colonel) Redl affair that shook the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy on the eve of World War I. Antel himself later commented on this period, &quot;I always wanted to provide good entertainment for the people at the cinema. After the screening, people should say: Well now, I am in a good mood, I will go out and have a glass of wine.&quot; (German original: &quot;Ich wollte die Leute im Kino immer gut unterhalten. Die Besucher sollten nach der Filmvorführung sagen: So, jetzt bin ich gut aufgelegt, jetzt geh ich auf ein Viertel Wein.&quot;)

From the late 1960s, encouraged by the new opportunities in the film industry brought about by the sexual revolution, Antel gradually switched his main interest to soft porn and ribaldry. It was in particular his series of &quot;Frau Wirtin&quot; (&quot;hostess&quot;) films, directed under the pseudonym François Legrand, with which he tried to win international recognition. Titles included &quot;The Sweet Sins of Sexy Susan&quot; (1967), &quot;Sexy Susan Sins Again&quot; (1968), &quot;&quot; (1969) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Daddy&quot; (aka &quot;Naughty Nymphs&quot; in the U.S.A.) (1972).

Antel would recount an anecdote about himself describing how, in order to live up to his reputation as a womanizer, he used to carry a pair of high heels in his luggage which he then would occasionally place in the corridor in front of his hotel room – especially when he was travelling alone.

Among the best known actors Antel had worked with from the 1940s to the 1970s were Hans Moser, Paul Hörbiger, Oskar Werner, Curd Jürgens, Tony Curtis, Herbert Fux, Heinrich Schweiger, Arthur Kennedy, Carroll Baker, Edwige Fenech, George Hilton, Marisa Berenson, Britt Ekland, Andréa Ferréol.

1981 was a turning point in Antel&#x27;s career when he adapted for the big screen a stage play by Ulrich Becher and Peter Preses. Set from the days of the Anschluss of 1938 until after the end of the war, &quot;Der Bockerer&quot; is about a Viennese butcher named Karl Bockerer (Karl Merkatz) whose common sense rather than intellect tells him to oppose the Nazis and who dares to show resistance just because he is never fully aware of the possible fateful consequences of his actions. While Bockerer and his wife survive the war unscathed, their son joins the SA but, after some internal intrigue, is sent to the front and killed. The film was entered into the 12th Moscow International Film Festival.

The film&#x27;s strong anti-fascist message, the moving dialogue, and performances by the &quot;crème de la crème&quot; of Austrian actors and actresses (Ida Krottendorf, Alfred Böhm, Heinz Marecek, Hans Holt, Dolores Schmidinger and many more) made &quot;Der Bockerer&quot; an unusually successful film and gave new impetus to Antel&#x27;s career. He made three sequels, which follow the lives of the Bockerers well into the 1960s, each depicting a crucial historical event in Austria or one of its neighbouring countries:

*&quot;Der Bockerer II&quot; (1996) is about the ten-year occupation (1945-1955) of Austria by the allied powers;
*&quot;Der Bockerer III — Die Brücke von Andau&quot; (2000) is set at the time of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution; and, finally,
*&quot;Der Bockerer IV — Der Prager Frühling&quot; (2003) deals with the historical event of Alexander Dubček&#x27;s Prague Spring in 1968.

<doc id="443056" wikidata="Q1050059" url="?curid=443056" title="Skimboarding">
<text>Skimboarding or skimming is a boardsport in which a skimboard (much like a surfboard but smaller and without fins) is used to glide across the water&#x27;s surface to meet an incoming breaking wave, and ride it back to shore. There are currently 3 U.S. based competitive organizations including Premier Skim, Skim USA, and the United Skim Tour. Wave-riding skimboarders perform a variety of surface and air maneuvers, at various stages of their ride, out to, and back with, the wave. Some of these are known as &quot;wraps&quot;, &quot;big spins&quot;, &quot;360 shove-its&quot; and &quot;180s&quot;. Unlike surfing, skimboarding begins on the beach by dropping the board onto the thin wash of previous waves. Skimboarders use their momentum to skim out to breaking waves, which they then catch back into shore in a manner similar to surfing. Covered by a award winning documentary on the history of the sport, &quot;Shorebreak The Evolution of Skimboarding&quot;. 

Another aspect of skimboarding is &quot;flatland,&quot; which involves performing tricks derived from skateboarding such as ollies and shove-its on the wash of waves without catching shore breaks. Skimboarding originated in Southern California when Laguna Beach lifeguards wanted to surf the local shore breaks that were too fast and shallow for surfboards. Skimboarding has developed since then to ride waves much like surfing, performing aerial maneuvers and pulling into the barrel of the wave. Professionals have even started getting towed by waverunners into much larger waves.

Recently a new type of skimboarding has appeared. Thanks to 4 times European champion, Adrien Raza, urban skimboarding is born. This way of skimboarding uses the city instead of the beach, which was the traditional way of skimming. According to Adrien Raza, he created this way of skimming due to a lack of good beaches near him. The main spots for urban skimboarding are fountains, canals, water mirrors, anywhere where there is a shallow body of water in the city.

==Skimboard characteristics==
Riders typically favor a board length which reaches about their mid-chest height when stood on end. Thickness of the board depends somewhat on the materials used in construction, but typically ranges from . The most common thicknesses are . A few high-flotation foam core boards and &quot;soft&quot; boards have been built with thicknesses in excess of . A board is capable of sharper turns while sacrificing a little speed. A board will be able to glide out farther, but turns slightly slower.

Most skimboards will have some nose lift, or rocker. There are three types of rockers generally used for skimboards. There is a constant rocker, which means that the board has a constant curve from nose to tail. Constant rockers are known for better control on bigger waves and steeper slopes. Another type of rocker and the most commonly used is a hybrid rocker. This means that the board has a curve on the bottom through about three quarters of the board&#x27;s length, the rest (meaning the flat part) is usually the tail. This type of rocker is good for both speed and control on decent size waves; also the best type of board for flatland tricks. Last of all, a traditional rocker means that the board is almost completely flat except for the nose. A traditional rocker is typically used for east coast conditions where the waves are far out.
== Dangers ==
There are many types of dangers that skimboarders can face on a daily basis. It is not uncommon to see fractures or dislocations of the lower limbs, some requiring serious medical attention. Lacerations, twisted ankles and bruises are also common, due to impacts with the board itself (especially with a hard skimboard instead of a soft skimboard), or rocks, logs and other obstacles present on beaches. Hamstring injury is also common due to the fast and extreme movement of a skimboarder&#x27;s legs when they run toward the water and jump on the board.

Drowning, as well as shark attacks, amongst skimboarders are not as likely as amongst surfers due to the shallow water in which skimboarding is usually practiced. Even though there are things that might cause these injuries it mostly relies on the conditions of the waters. Places with calm waters and small waves have little to no injury cases. On the other hand like in California, where the most skim-boarders are located, there are rough waters and large rushing waves at their beaches and also many rock structures in the waters. 85% of skimboard injuries have been traced to California beaches. Injury risk can be minimized through the choices riders make on where and when to skimboard.

==Locations==

Many consider the center of skimboarding to be located in Laguna Beach, California where skimboarding became popular in the late 1920s when lifeguards would skim across sand on pieces of wood. Every summer, Victoria Skimboards sponsors a contest called the VIC, which is held at Aliso Beach in Laguna; it is one of the biggest skimboarding competitions in the world. Other Laguna hot spots consist of Tenth Street, West Street, Treasure Island, Thalia Street, and Crescent Bay. In Dewey Beach, Delaware, every year the World Amateur Championships of Skimboarding are held on New Orleans Street. The Florida Pro/Am is held every year in August, on Vilano Beach and Vero Beach, known as the best East Coast skimboarding locations. Also the beaches on Florida&#x27;s west coast can also provide some quality locations, like Sarasota, Clearwater, Anna Maria Island. Big skimboarding waves are also found in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, people skim in many other locations throughout North America, Europe (the main locations being Portugal, France, Spain, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands), Australia, Asia, Middle East and South America. Some people skim inland because of difficulty with shore access. Flatland skimboarding can be done nearly anywhere: lakes, rivers, creeks, ponds, golf courses, puddles, or even wet grass. In the United States, flatland skim scenes have developed primarily in states not bordering the ocean. Flatland has also developed in British Columbia, Ontario, and along the Great Lakes.

Australia (Melbourne and Parramatta), and Wellington, New Zealand also have dedicated flatland communities and riders. In Europe, the Flatland skim scene is growing fast, with the biggest group of skimboarders situated in Poland. Skimboarding is popular on many beaches where it is impossible to surf, for example, on Boa Viagem, Recife, Brazil, where surfing is banned due to the threat of shark attacks. Beaches that have streams or rivers flowing into the ocean can also make ideal downhill skimming areas.

Israel is one of the few Middle Eastern countries where skimboarding is possible due to steep slopes along its coast and heavy beach break at selected beaches.

== Types of skimboards ==
=== Wave Riding Skimboards ===

Wave riding is the style most popular and best recognized in the sport of skimboarding. There are more athletes and competitions in wave riding than any other division of skimboarding. It is also the hardest and most technical. Today&#x27;s wave riding boards are a product of years of trials and errors. There isn&#x27;t much variation in shape because of this. There is a wide variety of beginner to very advanced, high performance boards in this category and it is important to choose the right one for your size, ability and style.
Wave riding skimboarders refer to their board as a &quot;skimboard.&quot; However to inland skimborders it is referred to as a &quot;foamie.&quot;

Wave riding skimboards can also perform more advance tricks, for they have the ability to reach deeper water. The waves can act as a ramp in some instances, causing the board and its rider to fly in the air when hit. During a jump or a wave ride, different maneuvers can be made with the board to perform a visually appealing trick. While tricks can be done with all boards, these boards have a different variety of tricks due to its flotation.

The majority of wave riding skimboard manufacturers use a closed cell foam, which is a high density foam material that resists water absorption and dings. A Fiber-reinforced polymer is commonly used to cover the foam forming a strong outer shell.

Fiberglass boards are great, compared to the wooden board. They are faster, lighter, and they have more control on the water. The fiberglass behaves across the sand and water better, which is important for doing tricks and moves with the skimboard when it hit the wave. Its outer shell is strong, but easy to dent with rocks, shells, like any other composite skimboard.

Carbon fiber boards are lighter, stronger, and stiffer than the fiberglass skimboards and faster on the water and on the wet sand but they are one of the most expensive boards. These boards are more commonly used by professional riders that ride big waves.

There are four essential characteristics specific for riding a variety of waves. The board must be light enough to practically float (skim) on the water, but heavy enough that it will not fly away in the wind. It must be fast, as skimboarders need speed to get to the desired wave and not miss it completely. It must have adequate and appropriate rocker for your desired skimboarding location. It must be flexible according to personal preference based on riding style and ability.

=== Flatland or Inland Skimboards ===

Inland boards are generally made of wood and are easy to find at a local surf or skate shop, depending on your location. Inland boards tend to be made of wood and have a hpl bottom and, therefore, are called &quot;woodies&quot; by wave-riding skimboarders. Wood core boards are quite rugged, and are meant for grinding rails and doing tricks. They stand up well against rocks, shells, obstacles, and general wear, and are great for beginners because they are simple to make and low-price. They are also used by a lot of professional skim boarders.

There are two basic sides of the spectrum for board types. The “Trick board,” a board where both sides are symmetrical and the shape is even throughout. This makes it ideal for spinning the board and completing tricks due to its symmetry. The “Cruiser board,” a board where the shape follows the same curves as a surfboard and is either slightly pointed or rounded at the top or tip and the back is slightly rounder. The backside of the board can also have a tail. These boards are typically called pintails.

These types of boards are usually used in flatland or urban skimming, due to the wood being resistant, therefore adapting to all surfaces, as well as the fact that with these boards the skimmer can perform tricks in an easier way. The wood also makes it complicated to catche waves, skimmers then decided to stick with these boards for flatland and urban skimboard, and use wave riding skimboards to catch waves.

==Industry==

The increasing international interest in skim boarding has resulted in the development of a competitive industry, catering for the ever-increasing demand for both quality and cheap skimboards. Companies sponsor riders from around the world. Professional skim boarders represent their sponsor and promote their boards. Companies usually have both amateur and professional teams which are supplied with boards at little cost to no cost. However, companies usually pay for all traveling expenses for their professional riders on competitive tours.

==Contests==

Skimboarding contests are held to establish ranking amongst skimboarders and provide a way for companies to market products. In North America there are two centralized organizations that hold events: United Skim Tour and Skim USA. There are also a lot of minor competitions such as the Virgin River Classic held in St. George Utah. In recent years the United Skim Tour (UST) has focused solely on professional competition while Skim USA has gravitated towards amateur competition. Some events are both Skim USA and UST events, and all Skim USA competitions have a professional division.

In Europe, the European Skimboard League was created in 2009 to promote skimboarding across the world. Its creation has been seen as one of the finest moments in European skimboarding to date. The 2009 League was won by Emanuel (Mega) Embaixador and in 2010 Hugo Santos. The league consists of 4 stages mostly held in the summer months, although UK &amp; Spanish events tend to happen just outside the holiday season. The stages are held in Portugal, France, The UK &amp; Spain, each hosted at one of the best skimboarding locations found anywhere in the world. The UK event is held at Tolcarne Beach in Newquay, Cornwall. Newquay is a location famous for its surfing scene and Tolcarne Beach is known as the UK Wedge to many surfers, bodyboarders &amp; skimboarders.

The DB Dash point Open is a flatland contest that takes place in Federal Way Washington, U.S.A at Dash Point State Park once a year https://dbskimboards.com/articles/2016-db-pro-skimboard-contest. The Dash Point Pro/Am contest has been running for thirteen years https://dbskimboards.com/articles/10th-annual-dash-point-proam. The first contest happened in 2003 and the latest in 2016 where Cody Maurer of Utah won first place in the Pro division https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F8HcymKw3I. Maurer landed a flawless backside 270 big-spin to front board on a launch ramp to double flat bar set-up. This banger helped him win first place.

In the past The Victoria World Championships determined the World Champion of Professional Skimboarding. The United Skim Tour moved professional skimboarding to a points system in 2012. Most events consist of a set time and date, but, there has been a small movement to start holding waiting period competitions like the Florida Pro/Am held in Vilano Beach, Florida each year, also the DB Pro-AM at Dash Point State Park. The pros all look forward to the first official contest of the year, which until 2013 was held in Cabo San Lucas every spring, but is now held in Brazil. In 2013, Cabo San Lucas was moved to the second contest of the year. The Florida Pro/Am is a skimboarding tournament held each August, on Vilano Beach, Florida. It typically lasts three days, and is the final leg of The Florida Cross Over Tour which includes surfing, skateboarding and skimboarding. The Florida Pro/Am and The Florida Cross-Over Tour are both considered premier skimboarding events. Some well-known skimboarders are Austin Keen, who is the current 2013 UST World Champion, Bill Bryan, Brad Domke, Adrien Raza, Morgan Just, Grady Archbold, James Lovett, Sam Stinnett, Paulo Prietto, Brandon Sears, Brandon Rothe, Jackson Tenney, Jaiden Fabrizio, and Colton Wallace.

Three leading companies are Exile Skimboards, Victoria Skimboards and Zap Skimboards. There are two types of contests; flatland and wave riding contests.

<text>Chiltern District was a local government district of Buckinghamshire in south-central England from 1974 to 2020. It was named after the Chiltern Hills on which the region sits.

The two towns in the district were Amersham, where the council was based, and Chesham. The district also included the villages of Chalfont St Peter, Chalfont St Giles, Little Chalfont, Great Missenden and Prestwood.

==History==

The district was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of Chesham Urban District and surrounding Amersham Rural District, under the Local Government Act 1972. In 1988 it was the first Council to take up stock transfer. 4,650 homes were transferred.

The district was abolished on 31 March 2020 and its area is now part of the unitary Buckinghamshire Council.

==Parishes==
The parishes that made up Chiltern District were:

* Amersham
* Ashley Green
* Chalfont St Giles
* Chalfont St Peter
* Chartridge
* Chenies
* Chesham
* Chesham Bois
* Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards
* Coleshill
* Great Missenden
* Latimer
* Little Chalfont
* Little Missenden
* Penn
* Seer Green
* The Lee

==Premises==
Chiltern District Council was initially based at the former Amersham Rural District Council offices at Elmodesham House, 42 High Street, Amersham, with the former Chesham Urban District Council&#x27;s offices at 8082 The Broadway, High Street, Chesham serving as additional office space. In 1986 the council consolidated its offices into a purpose-built headquarters on King George V Road in Amersham, remaining there until its abolition in 2020.

== Transport ==
There were no motorways in Chiltern District, except for a very short section of the M25 in the south-eastern corner near Chalfont St Peter. The major roads through the district were the A413, running north-west towards Aylesbury, and the A404, running west towards High Wycombe; both roads meet in Amersham.

Railway services were provided by Chiltern Railways and London Underground&#x27;s Metropolitan line. The Great Central Main Line carried traffic between London and Manchester until 1966; the section to Aylesbury is all that remains, and is now part of the London to Aylesbury Line. The railway stations in the district were Great Missenden, Amersham, Chalfont and Latimer and Chesham, the furthest tube station from London.

==Law and order==
Chiltern District fell within the Thames Valley Police area, with police stations in Amersham and Chesham.

Neighbourhood policing priorities were set on a quarterly cycle, at a public meeting. This was done in conjunction with Chiltern District Council&#x27;s Community Safety Team and Chiltern Community Forum, and in line with the obligation to consult laid down by the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011. In advance of the meeting, residents were invited to make their views and priorities known through a very short survey. Results from the survey were aggregated and presented at the meeting, and votes taken on the coming quarter&#x27;s priorities.

The Magistrates&#x27; Court in Amersham was closed with its jurisdiction reassigned but reopened as a Crown Court dealing with either-way and more serious alleged offences.

==Home ownership and quality of rural life==
The district had the highest proportion of home ownership of the 18 local authorities in Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire: combining the social (housing association and local authority provided) and private rented sectors, Stevenage&#x27;s returns recorded in 2011 that its rented sector comprised 33.2% of its housing, whereas 10.0% of Chiltern&#x27;s residents rented their homes.

In May 2008, the district was assessed by Halifax as having the best rural quality of life anywhere in Britain.

==Energy consumption==
In May 2006, a report commissioned by British Gas showed that housing in Chiltern produced the 4th highest average carbon emissions in the country at 7,421 kg of carbon dioxide per dwelling.

<doc id="443060" wikidata="Q1496379" url="?curid=443060" title="South Bucks">
<text>South Bucks was one of four local government districts in the non-metropolitan county of Buckinghamshire, in South East England.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, by the amalgamation of the area of Beaconsfield Urban District with part of Eton Rural District. The district was originally named Beaconsfield; it was renamed to South Bucks on 1 April 1980, following the passing of a resolution by the district council. The name was formally &#x27;South Bucks&#x27; rather than &#x27;South Buckinghamshire&#x27;. The district was abolished on 31 March 2020 and its area is now administered by the unitary Buckinghamshire Council.

:&quot;See List of civil parishes in South Bucks.&quot;

==Transport==
A large part of the district was sandwiched between the M40 and M4 motorways, both of which had junctions within the district. The major M40/M25 interchange is located near Gerrards Cross and is the M25&#x27;s only junction in the district. South Bucks contained the greatest length of motorway in any Buckinghamshire district.
Railway lines follow the motorways: they were the Great Western Main Line and the Chiltern Main Line, with important stations in Beaconsfield and Gerrards Cross. Denham Aerodrome in the southeast of the district had a small number of chartered flights running out of it.

==Premises==
From its creation in 1974 until 2004 the council was based at the former Eton Rural District Council&#x27;s offices on Windsor Road in Slough, outside the district&#x27;s administrative area. In 2004 the council moved to a modern office building at Capswood, Oxford Road, Denham, within its administrative area. Since the local government reorganisation in 2020, the building at Capswood serves as one of the area offices of Buckinghamshire Council.

==Education==

The Japanese international boarding school Teikyo School United Kingdom is located in Wexham, South Bucks.

The former district was also home to comprehensive Beaconsfield School as well as the grammar schools, Beaconsfield High School and Burnham Grammar School.

<doc id="443061" wikidata="Q1648135" url="?curid=443061" title="Mung (computer term)">
<text>Mung or munge is computer jargon for a series of potentially destructive or irrevocable changes to a piece of data or a file. It is sometimes used for vague data transformation steps that are not yet clear to the speaker. Common munging operations include removing punctuation or HTML tags, data parsing, filtering, and transformation.

The term was coined in 1958 in the Tech Model Railroad Club at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1960 the backronym &quot;Mash Until No Good&quot; was created to describe Mung, and by 1976 it was revised to &quot;Mung Until No Good&quot;, making it one of the first recursive acronyms. It lived on as a recursive command in the editing language TECO.

Munging may also describe the constructive operation of tying together systems and interfaces that were not specifically designed to interoperate (also called &#x27;duct-taping&#x27;). Munging can also describe the processing or filtering of raw data into another form.

As the &quot;no good&quot; part of the acronym implies, munging often involves irrevocable destruction of data.

<doc id="443062" wikidata="Q1368807" url="?curid=443062" title="Cévennes National Park">
<text>Cévennes National Park () is a French national park located in Southern France, in the mountainous area of Cévennes.

Created in 1970, the park has its administrative seat in Florac at Florac Castle. It is located mainly in the departments of Lozère and Gard; it also covers some parts of Ardèche and Aveyron, therefore stretching across a record number of departments for a national park. The Aven Armand cave is located in the park. In 2011, the Park was made a part of The Causses and the Cévennes, Mediterranean agro-pastoral Cultural Landscape UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== Geography ==
The park includes several mountains and plateaus, including: Mont Lozère, Mont Aigoual, Causse Méjean, France. Mont Lozère is the highest peak in the area, reaching 1,699 metres.

== History ==
The Cévennes country is rich in history, with a strong cultural identity, being at the heart of Camisard revolt, which followed the revocation of the Edict of Nantes (the Edict of Fontainebleau), after which Protestants were actively persecuted. Numerous testimonies of Camisard war in the Cévennes abund in towns and villages of the Cévennes National Park. A permanent exhibition devoted to the memory of Camisards has been elaborated at the old temple of Le Rouve (commune of Saint-André-de-Lancize).

<doc id="443066" wikidata="Q27075928" url="?curid=443066" title="Palm warbler">
<text>The palm warbler (Setophaga palmarum) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family.

== Description ==
Measurements:

* Length: 
* Weight: 
* Wingspan: 

== Taxonomy ==

The species comprises two distinct subspecies that may merit specific status.

&quot;Yellow palm warbler&quot; or &quot;eastern palm warbler&quot; (&quot;S. p. hypochrysea&quot;) of the eastern third of the breeding range has brownish-olive upper parts and thoroughly yellow underparts with bold rufous breast and flank streaking. It migrates later in the fall than its western counterpart.

&quot;Brown palm warbler&quot; or &quot;western palm warbler&quot; (&quot;S. p. palmarum&quot;) inhabits the remaining western two-thirds of the breeding range. It has much less yellow below, with less colorful streaking, and cold grayish-brown upper parts.

==Distribution==
Palm warblers breed in open coniferous bogs and edge east of the Continental Divide, across Canada and the northeastern United States.

These birds migrate to the southeastern United States, the Yucatán Peninsula, islands of the Caribbean, and eastern Nicaragua south to Panama to winter. They are one of the earlier migrants to return to their breeding grounds in the spring, often completing their migration almost two months before most other warblers. Unlike most &quot;Setophaga&quot; species, the palm warbler&#x27;s winter range includes much of the Atlantic coast of North America, extending as far north as southern Nova Scotia. Every year since 1900 the palm warbler has been observed during Christmas Bird Count activities in Massachusetts, and consistently since 1958 in Nova Scotia. For the interval 1966–2015 the palm warbler population increased throughout much of its northernmost breeding range.

The palm warbler has been recorded as a vagrant to Iceland.

== Behavior ==
Palm warbler nests take the form of an open cup, usually situated on or near the ground in an open area.

Palm warblers forage on the ground much more than other warblers, sometimes flying to catch insects. These birds mainly eat insects and berries. Their constant tail bobbing is an identifying characteristic. Kirtland&#x27;s, prairie, and palm warblers are the only Setophaga species that incessantly bob their tails.

The song of this bird is a monotonous buzzy trill. The call is a sharp &quot;chek&quot;.

<text>Severn Trent plc is a water company based in Coventry, England. It supplies 4.6 million households and business across the Midlands and Wales.

It is traded on the London Stock Exchange and a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. Severn Trent, the trading name owned by the company, applies to a group of companies operating across the United Kingdom, United States and mainland Europe, with some involvement in the Middle East. It took its name from the two predecessor River Authorities, which managed the catchment of the Severn and the Trent.

==History==
The Severn Trent Water Authority was established in 1974. In July 1989, the Severn Trent Water Authority was partially privatised under the Water Act 1989, together with the rest of the water supply and sewage disposal industry in England and Wales, to form Severn Trent Water, with a responsibility to supply freshwater and treat sewage for around 8 million people living in the Midlands of England and also a small area of Wales.

In May 1991, it went on to acquire Biffa, a waste management business. In October 2006, Biffa was demerged from the group Severn Trent, and was subsequently listed separately on the London Stock Exchange. In January 2007, the American side of Severn Trent Laboratories was sold to HIG Capital.

In 1993 the company acquired East Worcester Water plc, a former statutory water company whose area was surrounded by Severn Trent&#x27;s existing water supply area, and the operations were merged.

In September 2007, the company announced they would be closing its headquarters in Birmingham and relocating to a custom built office complex in the centre of Coventry in the autumn of 2010.

In June 2016, Severn Trent Water and United Utilities formed Water Plus in preparation for the water market deregulation, to provide the retail services for their non household customers, after being granted approval by the Competition &amp; Markets Authority.

In 2017 Severn Trent plc acquired Dee Valley Water, a water-only company with an area adjoining Severn Trent Water&#x27;s own. In 2018 the areas of the two operating companies were adjusted so that Hafren Dyfrdwy (the new name for the Dee Valley company) took on all Severn Trent Water&#x27;s water supply and wastewater operations in Wales, and the small area of the former Dee Valley operation within England (an exclave at Chester) became part of Severn Trent Water.

==Operations==
The main companies in the group are Severn Trent Water, Hafren Dyfrdwy and Severn Trent Services. Severn Trent Laboratories was rebranded as part of Severn Trent Services in 2010, to streamline the company and give it a single worldwide image, rather than a series of separate organisations with different identities. As with all water companies in the United Kingdom, Severn Trent is regulated under the Water Industry Act 1991.

, the company supplies about 4.6 million households and businesses in its area, rising from 3.7 million in 2008. Severn Trent Water has a call centre in Coventry, dealing with operational emergencies and billing enquiries, and two other call centres in Derby and Shrewsbury, which deal solely with billing enquiries. Its head office is the new custom built Severn Trent Centre in Coventry.

==Regulation and criticism==
In July 2007, the Mythe Water Treatment Works near Tewkesbury became inundated with water from the River Severn during the Summer 2007 United Kingdom floods. The water coming into the plant was contaminated, and this led to the loss of all running water for approximately 150,000 people in Cheltenham, Gloucester and Tewkesbury.

In July 2008, OFWAT confirmed that it had fined Severn Trent Water £35.8 million for deliberately providing false information to Ofwat and for delivering poor service to its customers. In July 2008, the company was fined £2m (reduced from a previous judgement of £4m) for poor information reporting and covering up misleading leakage data.

Despite improvements, according to Ofwat, the percentage of leakages from 2010 to 2011 was the highest in England and Wales, at 27%, representing 0.5 billion litres (500,000 tonnes) per day.
On 11 March 2016, Severn Trent customers in Derbyshire were issued a &quot;do not use&quot; notice due to high levels of chlorine detected in the water supply, leaving thousands of households without a clean, reliable water supply.

On 20 February 2024, Severn Trent Water was fined over £2 million for discharging more than 260 million litres of raw sewage into the River Trent from its Strongford Treatment Works, an incident that occurred between November 2019 and February 2020 but avoided catastrophic pollution due to high river flows from storms.

In December 2024, Severn Trent Water was accused by the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; of an accounting trick artificially inflating its balance sheet by more than a billion pounds. An investment (&#x27;Severn Trent Trimpley&#x27;) that the company claims is worth £1.68bn in its accounts, was said to have no value to the overall business in reality, but made the company appear more financially robust, supporting payments to shareholders. Severn Trent denied the accusation, saying &quot;Panorama&quot;&#x27;s allegations were &quot;completely inaccurate&quot;.

==Reservoirs==

The company operates a number of reservoirs, many of which are accessible for recreational use. These include:
*Carsington Reservoir – River Derwent compensation flow pumped storage facility
*Upper Derwent Valley (Derwent, Howden and Ladybower Reservoirs) – Built by the Derwent Valley Water Board to supply the cities of Sheffield, Derby, Nottingham and Leicester
*Draycote Water
*Foremark Reservoir
*Shustoke Reservoir
*Tittesworth reservoir
*Ogston Reservoir
*Linacre Reservoirs (non operational since 1995) 
* Barby Storage Reservoir
*Severn Trent Water also runs the filtration works at the Elan Valley Reservoirs

<text>A netlabel (also online label, web label, digi label, MP3 label or download label) is a record label that distributes its music through digital audio formats (such as MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, or WAV) over the Internet. While similar to traditional record labels in many respects, netlabels typically emphasize free distribution online, often under licenses that encourage works to be shared (e.g., Creative Commons licenses), and artists often retain copyright.

Netlabels may have a considerably lower staff count than traditional record labels, in some instances being only a single individual in control of their music, maintaining sole ownership. Physical LPs, for example, are rarely produced by a netlabel, relying entirely on digital distribution and means of the Internet to provide the product. Having no physical product makes the running costs of a netlabel considerably less than a traditional record label and some netlabels have abandoned any financial model altogether and instead, running the netlabel as a hobby. Some employ guerrilla marketing to promote their work.

==History==
Online music groups date back almost as far as the history of personal computers, and share close ties with video games and the demoscene. Early music groups released music in MOD formats, typically as part of a music disk, which often included a MOD player, visual effects, and textual information.

Netlabels began to branch out from the tracker scene when the lossy MP3 file format became popular in the late 1990s. Some are still dedicated to electronic music and related genres, though this is rapidly changing and the quality of downloads are getting higher with the use of FLAC downloads offering CD quality music. 

Most of the original netlabels have now ceased operations. Only a few of the originators of the movements are still currently active, and releasing in the same format, like Eerik Inpuj Sound, Upitup Records, 50/50innertainment Records, Kahvi Collective, Bedroom Research, Acroplane and Phonocake.

<doc id="443083" wikidata="Q1665869" url="?curid=443083" title="Interaction (statistics)">
<text>In statistics, an interaction may arise when considering the relationship among three or more variables, and describes a situation in which the effect of one causal variable on an outcome depends on the state of a second causal variable (that is, when effects of the two causes are not additive). Although commonly thought of in terms of causal relationships, the concept of an interaction can also describe non-causal associations (then also called &quot;moderation&quot; or &quot;effect modification&quot;). Interactions are often considered in the context of regression analyses or factorial experiments.

The presence of interactions can have important implications for the interpretation of statistical models. If two variables of interest interact, the relationship between each of the interacting variables and a third &quot;dependent variable&quot; depends on the value of the other interacting variable. In practice, this makes it more difficult to predict the consequences of changing the value of a variable, particularly if the variables it interacts with are hard to measure or difficult to control.

The notion of &quot;interaction&quot; is closely related to that of moderation that is common in social and health science research: the interaction between an explanatory variable and an environmental variable suggests that the effect of the explanatory variable has been moderated or modified by the environmental variable.

==Introduction==
An interaction variable or interaction feature is a variable constructed from an original set of variables to try to represent either all of the interaction present or some part of it. In exploratory statistical analyses it is common to use products of original variables as the basis of testing whether interaction is present with the possibility of substituting other more realistic interaction variables at a later stage. When there are more than two explanatory variables, several interaction variables are constructed, with pairwise-products representing pairwise-interactions and higher order products representing higher order interactions.

Thus, for a response &quot;Y&quot; and two variables &quot;x&quot;1 and &quot;x&quot;2 an &quot;additive&quot; model would be:

:formula_1

In contrast to this,

:formula_2

is an example of a model with an &quot;interaction&quot; between variables &quot;x&quot;1 and &quot;x&quot;2 (&quot;error&quot; refers to the random variable whose value is that by which &quot;Y&quot; differs from the expected value of &quot;Y&quot;; see errors and residuals in statistics). Often, models are presented without the interaction term formula_3, but this confounds the main effect and interaction effect (i.e., without specifying the interaction term, it is possible that any main effect found is actually due to an interaction). 

Moreover, the hierarchical principle rules that if a model includes interaction between variables, it is also necessary to include the main effects, regardless of their own statistical significance.

==In modeling==
===In ANOVA===
A simple setting in which interactions can arise is a two-factor experiment analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Suppose we have two binary factors &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. For example, these factors might indicate whether either of two treatments were administered to a patient, with the treatments applied either singly, or in combination. We can then consider the average treatment response (e.g. the symptom levels following treatment) for each patient, as a function of the treatment combination that was administered. The following table shows one possible situation:

In this example, there is no interaction between the two treatments — their effects are additive. The reason for this is that the difference in mean response between those subjects receiving treatment &quot;A&quot; and those not receiving treatment &quot;A&quot; is −2 regardless of whether treatment &quot;B&quot; is administered (−2 = 4 − 6) or not (−2 = 5 − 7). Note that it automatically follows that the difference in mean response between those subjects receiving treatment &quot;B&quot; and those not receiving treatment &quot;B&quot; is the same regardless of whether treatment &quot;A&quot; is administered (7 − 6 = 5 − 4).

In contrast, if the following average responses are observed

then there is an interaction between the treatments — their effects are not additive. Supposing that greater numbers correspond to a better response, in this situation treatment &quot;B&quot; is helpful on average if the subject is not also receiving treatment &quot;A&quot;, but is detrimental on average if given in combination with treatment &quot;A&quot;. Treatment &quot;A&quot; is helpful on average regardless of whether treatment &quot;B&quot; is also administered, but it is more helpful in both absolute and relative terms if given alone, rather than in combination with treatment &quot;B&quot;. Similar observations are made for this particular example in the next section.

===Qualitative and quantitative interactions===
In many applications it is useful to distinguish between qualitative and quantitative interactions. A quantitative interaction between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; is a situation where the magnitude of the effect of &quot;B&quot; depends on the value of &quot;A&quot;, but the direction of the effect of &quot;B&quot; is constant for all &quot;A&quot;. A qualitative interaction between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; refers to a situation where both the magnitude and direction of each variable&#x27;s effect can depend on the value of the other variable.

The table of means on the left, below, shows a quantitative interaction — treatment &quot;A&quot; is beneficial both when &quot;B&quot; is given, and when &quot;B&quot; is not given, but the benefit is greater when &quot;B&quot; is not given (i.e. when &quot;A&quot; is given alone). The table of means on the right shows a qualitative interaction. &quot;A&quot; is harmful when &quot;B&quot; is given, but it is beneficial when &quot;B&quot; is not given. Note that the same interpretation would hold if we consider the benefit of &quot;B&quot; based on whether &quot;A&quot; is given.

The distinction between qualitative and quantitative interactions depends on the order in which the variables are considered (in contrast, the property of additivity is invariant to the order of the variables). In the following table, if we focus on the effect of treatment &quot;A&quot;, there is a quantitative interaction — giving treatment &quot;A&quot; will improve the outcome on average regardless of whether treatment &quot;B&quot; is or is not already being given (although the benefit is greater if treatment &quot;A&quot; is given alone). However, if we focus on the effect of treatment &quot;B&quot;, there is a qualitative interaction — giving treatment &quot;B&quot; to a subject who is already receiving treatment &quot;A&quot; will (on average) make things worse, whereas giving treatment &quot;B&quot; to a subject who is not receiving treatment &quot;A&quot; will improve the outcome on average.

===Unit treatment additivity===
In its simplest form, the assumption of treatment unit additivity states that the observed response &quot;y&quot;&quot;ij&quot; from experimental unit &quot;i&quot; when receiving treatment &quot;j&quot; can be written as the sum &quot;y&quot;&quot;ij&quot; = &quot;y&quot;&quot;i&quot; + &quot;t&quot;&quot;j&quot;. The assumption of unit treatment additivity implies that every treatment has exactly the same additive effect on each experimental unit. Since any given experimental unit can only undergo one of the treatments, the assumption of unit treatment additivity is a hypothesis that is not directly falsifiable, according to Cox and Kempthorne.

However, many consequences of treatment-unit additivity can be falsified. For a randomized experiment, the assumption of treatment additivity implies that the variance is constant for all treatments. Therefore, by contraposition, a necessary condition for unit treatment additivity is that the variance is constant.

The property of unit treatment additivity is not invariant under a change of scale, so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit treatment additivity. If the response variable is expected to follow a parametric family of probability distributions, then the statistician may specify (in the protocol for the experiment or observational study) that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variance. In many cases, a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses, which are believed to follow a multiplicative model.

The assumption of unit treatment additivity was enunciated in experimental design by Kempthorne and Cox. Kempthorne&#x27;s use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design-based analysis of finite population survey sampling.

In recent years, it has become common to use the terminology of Donald Rubin, which uses counterfactuals. Suppose we are comparing two groups of people with respect to some attribute &quot;y&quot;. For example, the first group might consist of people who are given a standard treatment for a medical condition, with the second group consisting of people who receive a new treatment with unknown effect. Taking a &quot;counterfactual&quot; perspective, we can consider an individual whose attribute has value &quot;y&quot; if that individual belongs to the first group, and whose attribute has value &quot;τ&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) if the individual belongs to the second group. The assumption of &quot;unit treatment additivity&quot; is that &quot;τ&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;τ&quot;, that is, the &quot;treatment effect&quot; does not depend on &quot;y&quot;. Since we cannot observe both &quot;y&quot; and τ(&quot;y&quot;) for a given individual, this is not testable at the individual level. However, unit treatment additivity implies that the cumulative distribution functions &quot;F&quot;1 and &quot;F&quot;2 for the two groups satisfy 
&quot;F&quot;2(&quot;y&quot;)  = &quot;F&quot;1(&quot;y − τ&quot;), as long as the assignment of individuals to groups 1 and 2 is independent of all other factors influencing &quot;y&quot; (i.e. there are no confounders). Lack of unit treatment additivity can be viewed as a form of interaction between the treatment assignment (e.g. to groups 1 or 2), and the baseline, or untreated value of &quot;y&quot;.

===Categorical variables===
Sometimes the interacting variables are categorical variables rather than real numbers and the study might then be dealt with as an analysis of variance problem. For example, members of a population may be classified by religion and by occupation. If one wishes to predict a person&#x27;s height based only on the person&#x27;s religion and occupation, a simple &quot;additive&quot; model, i.e., a model without interaction, would add to an overall average height an adjustment for a particular religion and another for a particular occupation. A model with interaction, unlike an additive model, could add a further adjustment for the &quot;interaction&quot; between that religion and that occupation. This example may cause one to suspect that the word &quot;interaction&quot; is something of a misnomer.

Statistically, the presence of an interaction between categorical variables is generally tested using a form of analysis of variance (ANOVA). If one or more of the variables is continuous in nature, however, it would typically be tested using moderated multiple regression. This is so-called because a moderator is a variable that affects the strength of a relationship between two other variables.

===Designed experiments===
Genichi Taguchi contended that interactions could be eliminated from a system by appropriate choice of response variable and transformation. However George Box and others have argued that this is not the case in general.

===Model size===
Given &quot;n&quot; predictors, the number of terms in a linear model that includes a constant, every predictor, and every possible interaction is formula_4. Since this quantity grows exponentially, it readily becomes impractically large. One method to limit the size of the model is to limit the order of interactions. For example, if only two-way interactions are allowed, the number of terms becomes formula_5. The below table shows the number of terms for each number of predictors and maximum order of interaction.

===In regression===

The most general approach to modeling interaction effects involves regression, starting from the elementary version given above:

:formula_2

where the interaction term formula_7 could be formed explicitly by multiplying two (or more) variables, or implicitly using factorial notation in modern statistical packages such as Stata. The components &quot;x&quot;1 and &quot;x&quot;2 might be measurements or {0,1} dummy variables in any combination. Interactions involving a dummy variable multiplied by a measurement variable are termed &quot;slope dummy variables&quot;, because they estimate and test the difference in slopes between groups 0 and 1.

When measurement variables are employed in interactions, it is often desirable to work with centered versions, where the variable&#x27;s mean (or some other reasonably central value) is set as zero. Centering can make the main effects in interaction models more interpretable, as it reduces the multicollinearity between the interaction term and the main effects. The coefficient &quot;a&quot; in the equation above, for example, represents the effect of &quot;x&quot;1 when &quot;x&quot;2 equals zero.

Regression approaches to interaction modeling are very general because they can accommodate additional predictors, and many alternative specifications or estimation strategies beyond ordinary least squares. Robust, quantile, and mixed-effects (multilevel) models are among the possibilities, as is generalized linear modeling encompassing a wide range of categorical, ordered, counted or otherwise limited dependent variables. The graph depicts an education*politics interaction, from a probability-weighted logit regression analysis of survey data.

==Interaction plots==

Interaction plots, also called simple-slope plots, show possible interactions among variables.

===Example: Interaction of species and air temperature and their effect on body temperature===

Consider a study of the body temperature of different species at different air temperatures, in degrees Fahrenheit. The data are shown in the table below.

The interaction plot may use either the air temperature or the species as the x axis. The second factor is represented by lines on the interaction plot.

There is an interaction between the two factors (air temperature and species) in their effect on the response (body temperature), because the effect of the air temperature depends on the species. The interaction is indicated on the plot because the lines are not parallel.

=== Example: effect of stroke severity and treatment on recovery===

As a second example, consider a clinical trial on the interaction between stroke severity and the efficacy of a drug on patient survival. The data are shown in the table below.

In the interaction plot, the lines for the mild and moderate stroke groups are parallel, indicating that the drug has the same effect in both groups, so there is no interaction. The line for the severe stroke group is not parallel to the other lines, indicating that there is an interaction between stroke severity and drug effect on survival. The line for the severe stroke group is flat, indicating that, among these patients, there is no difference in survival between the drug and placebo treatments. In contrast, the lines for the mild and moderate stroke groups slope down to the right, indicating that, among these patients, the placebo group has lower survival than drug-treated group.

==Hypothesis tests for interactions==

Analysis of variance and regression analysis are used to test for significant interactions.

===Example: Interaction of temperature and time in cookie baking===

Is the yield of good cookies affected by the baking temperature and time in the oven? The table shows data for 8 batches of cookies.

The data show that the yield of good cookies is best when either (i) temperature is high and time in the oven is short, or (ii) temperature is low and time in the oven is long. If the cookies are left in the oven for a long time at a high temperature, there are burnt cookies and the yield is low.

From the graph and the data, it is clear that the lines are not parallel, indicating that there is an interaction. This can be tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The first ANOVA model will not include the interaction term. That is, the first ANOVA model ignores possible interaction. The second ANOVA model will include the interaction term. That is, the second ANOVA model explicitly performs a hypothesis test for interaction.

====ANOVA model 1: no interaction term; yield ~ temperature + time====

In the ANOVA model that ignores interaction, neither temperature nor time has a significant effect on yield (p=0.91), which is clearly the incorrect conclusion. The more appropriate ANOVA model should test for possible interaction.

====ANOVA model 2: include interaction term; yield ~ temperature * time====

The temperature:time interaction term is significant (p=0.000180). Based on the interaction test and the interaction plot, it appears that the effect of time on yield depends on temperature and vice versa.

==Examples==
Real-world examples of interaction include:
*&quot;Interaction&quot; between adding sugar to coffee and stirring the coffee. Neither of the two individual variables has much effect on sweetness but a combination of the two does.
*&quot;Interaction&quot; between adding carbon to steel and quenching. Neither of the two individually has much effect on strength but a combination of the two has a dramatic effect.
*&quot;Interaction&quot; between smoking and inhaling asbestos fibres: Both raise lung carcinoma risk, but exposure to asbestos &quot;multiplies&quot; the cancer risk in smokers and non-smokers. Here, the &quot;joint effect&quot; of inhaling asbestos and smoking is higher than the sum of both effects.
*&quot;Interaction&quot; between genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes and diet (specifically, a &quot;western&quot; dietary pattern). The western dietary pattern was shown to increase diabetes risk for subjects with a high &quot;genetic risk score&quot;, but not for other subjects.
*&quot;Interaction&quot; between education and political orientation, affecting general-public perceptions about climate change. For example, US surveys often find that acceptance of the reality of anthropogenic climate change rises with education among moderate or liberal survey respondents, but declines with education among the most conservative. Similar interactions have been observed to affect some non-climate science or environmental perceptions, and to operate with science literacy or other knowledge indicators in place of education.

<text>Praxis is an experimental rock project, led by producer/bassist Bill Laswell and featuring guitarist Buckethead and drummer Brain in nearly every incarnation of the band.

The group worked with many other artists such as Serj Tankian from System of a Down, Iggy Pop, DXT and DJ Disk.

==Biography==
===Early days===
Bill Laswell initially used the name Praxis for an experimental solo EP recorded for Celluloid Records in 1984, simply named &quot;1984&quot;.

===1992–1996===
The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Transmutation (Mutatis Mutandis),&quot; released in 1992, was well received by critics. Praxis was composed of guitarist Buckethead, keyboardist Bernie Worrell, drummer Brain, bassist Bootsy Collins and Afrika Baby Bam as &quot;AF Next Man Flip&quot; on turntables. Bill Laswell masterminded the project and served as producer and co-writer of much of the album&#x27;s material. Praxis combined elements of different musical genres such as funk, jazz, hip-hop and heavy metal into highly improvised music. The P-Funk-inspired track &quot;Animal Behavior,&quot; with a lead vocal from Collins, was released as a single. A video was also shot for the track.

Their next studio album, &quot;Sacrifist,&quot; was released two years later on the new Laswell-led label Subharmonic and featured a rotating roster of guests including sax player John Zorn, drummer Mick Harris from Painkiller, and members of the band Blind Idiot God. The death metal-influenced album was not as acclaimed as their debut.

The same year saw the album Metatron, with a trio of Buckethead, Laswell and Brain, which included the song &quot;Wake the Dead.&quot;

In 1996 the band toured Europe and recorded two live albums called &quot;Live in Poland&quot; and &quot;Transmutation Live&quot; containing material from shows in Zürich and Warsaw. Both albums featured members of the Invisibl Skratch Piklz. After the shows, the project broke up.

===1997–2004===
In 1997, Bill Laswell re-released his Material EP &quot;1984&quot; under the Praxis name. This was followed by the album &quot;Mold&quot; with Pat Thrall, Peter Wetherbee and Alex Haas instead of Buckethead, Brain and Bernie Worrell respectively. The album was essentially somewhat of a remix album with Wetherbee and crew taking elements from 1984 and crafting a full-length release. Laswell&#x27;s involvement with this album was minimal. In 1998, Laswell contributed &quot;Dreadnot&quot; to the compilation &quot;Abstract Depressionism&quot;. Though labeled a Praxis track, this was essentially a solo Laswell creation.

In the same year a first compilation album also containing two songs from the Death Cube K album &quot;Dreamatorium&quot; (Death Cube K is an anagram of Buckethead) was made available.
In 1999, a re-worked version of &quot;Live in Poland&quot; was released as &quot;Warszawa&quot;. Little was heard of the band for the next years, while Brain and Buckethead played for Guns N&#x27; Roses and Laswell concentrated more on his dub releases.

===2004–2010===
Most original members reunited for a small tour in 2004 culminating in their appearance as part of a Bill Laswell themed episode of the PBS series Soundstage. Laswell also began working on their next studio album &quot;Profanation (Preparation for a Coming Darkness)&quot;, but due to the label (Sanctuary) going broke the project was put on hold for about three years.

In 2005 &quot;Transmutation Live&quot; was re-worked and re-released as &quot;Zurich&quot;. Another live album called &quot;Tennessee 2004&quot; was released in 2007 which was a truncated version of a longer show performed at the Bonnarroo festival.

On 5 April 2005, Laswell performed a 2-hour concert at WTTW Stusios, Chicago with three incarnations of his groups: Tabla Beat Science (with Zakir Hussein, Ustad Sultan Khan, DJ Disk, Karsh Kale, Selim Merchant and Nils Petter Molvaer), Material (with Pharoah Sanders, Foday Musa Suso, Hamid Drake, Aïyb Dieng and Abegasu Shiota) and Praxis (with Buckethead, Brain and Toshinori Kondo), with Bootsy Collins performing MC duties at its climax. An hour long edit was broadcast on the Soundstage series on 13 July 2006.

On January 1, 2008 the studio album &quot;Profanation (Preparation for a Coming Darkness)&quot; was released in Japan with guest contributions by Serj Tankian, Mike Patton and Iggy Pop as well as Buckethead&#x27;s old friend Maximum Bob and many more.

===2011–present: Hiatus and Sound Virus===
In early 2011, &quot;Profanation&quot; was re-released on Bill Laswell&#x27;s new M.O.D. Technologies label with two additional live tracks. Later that month Bill Laswell stated in an interview that there was likely no more future for the band:

M.O.D. Technologies also has a vinyl version of &quot;Profanation&quot; scheduled for an April 2013 release.

In 2015, the band released a new album entitled &quot;Sound Virus&quot;.

In 2022, Bill Laswell, Buckethead and Brain returned to the stage as Praxis to play two shows in New York.

== Notable guests ==
The following musicians have contributed to the various Praxis experiments (though arguably, those appearing on &quot;Mold&quot; are not proper collaborators as this album is only tenuously part of the Praxis canon):

*Afrika Baby Bam as AF Next Man Flip on turntables
*Cindy Blackman on drums
*Bootsy Collins on bass and vocals
*DJ Disk on turntables
*DXT on turntables
*Yamatsuka Eye on vocals
*Mick Harris on drums
*Lili Haydn on violin
*Invisibl Skratch Piklz on turntables
*Toshinori Kondo on trumpet
*Maximum Bob on vocals
*Mike Patton on vocals
*Iggy Pop on vocals
*Serj Tankian on vocals
*Pat Thrall on guitars
*John Zorn on saxophone
== Musical styles ==
Between the influence of Laswell and Buckethead, Praxis&#x27; musical experimentation in both studio, street and live settings have combined elements of mid-1970s Funkadelic &amp; Miles Davis, hip-hop&#x27;s more avant-garde leanings, and Last Exit&#x27;s ferocious yet organic jazz/metal aesthetic. Many of these experiments defined diverse, eclectic, and freeform genres including avant-garde, heavy metal, funk and jazz-fusion.

<text>Maurice Druon (; 23 April 1918 – 14 April 2009) was a French novelist and a member of the Académie Française, of which he served as &quot;Perpetual Secretary&quot; (chairman) between 1985 and 1999.

==Life and career==

Born in Paris, France, Druon was the son of Russian-Jewish immigrant Lazare Kessel (1899–1920) and was brought up at La Croix-Saint-Leufroy in Normandy and educated at the lycée Michelet de Vanves. His father committed suicide in 1920 and his mother remarried in 1926; Maurice subsequently took the name of his adoptive father, the lawyer René Druon (1874–1961).

He was the nephew of the writer Joseph Kessel, with whom he translated the &quot;Chant des Partisans&quot;, a French Resistance anthem of World War II, with music and words (in Russian) originally by Anna Marly. Druon was a member of the Resistance and came to London in 1943 to participate in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Honneur et Patrie&quot; programme.

Druon began writing for literary journals at the age of 18. In September 1939, having been called up for military service, he wrote an article for &quot;Paris-Soir&quot; entitled &quot;J&#x27;ai vingt ans et je pars (I am twenty years old and I am leaving)&quot;. Following the fall of France in 1940, he was demobilized and remained in the unoccupied zone of France, and his first play, &quot;Mégarée&quot;, was produced in Monte Carlo in February 1942. He left the same year to join the forces of Charles de Gaulle. Druon became aide de camp to General François d&#x27;Astier de La Vigerie.

In 1948 Druon received the Prix Goncourt for his novel &quot;&quot;, and later published two sequels.

Druon was elected to the 30th seat of the Académie française on 8 December 1966, succeeding Georges Duhamel. He was elected as &quot;Perpetual Secretary&quot; in 1985, but chose to resign the office in late 1999 due to old age; he successfully pushed for Hélène Carrère d&#x27;Encausse to succeed him, the first woman to hold the post, and was styled Honorary Perpetual Secretary after 2000. On the death of Henri Troyat on 2 March 2007, he became the Dean of the &quot;Académie&quot;, its longest-serving member.

While his scholarly writing earned him a seat at the Académie, Druon is best known for a series of seven historical novels published in the 1950s under the title &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; (&quot;The Accursed Kings&quot;). The novels were adapted for French television in 1972, gaining a wider audience through overseas sales, and again in 2005, starring Jeanne Moreau. Fantasy writer George R. R. Martin stated that the novels had been an inspiration for his fantasy series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot;, and called Druon &quot;France&#x27;s best historical novelist since Alexandre Dumas, &quot;père&quot;&quot;.

Druon&#x27;s only work for children – &quot;Tistou les pouces verts&quot; – was published in 1957 and translated into English in 1958 (as &quot;Tistou of the Green Thumbs&quot;) and 2012 (as &quot;Tistou: The Boy With Green Thumbs&quot;).

Druon was Minister of Cultural Affairs (1973–1974) in Pierre Messmer&#x27;s cabinet, and a deputy of Paris (1978–1981). He was survived by his second wife, Madeleine Marignac, whom he married in 1968. Madeleine Druon died in 2016 aged 91.
Druon was a descendant of Brazilian author .

<doc id="443090" wikidata="Q1277229" url="?curid=443090" title="Earl of Buchan">
<text>The Mormaer () or Earl of Buchan () was originally the provincial ruler of the medieval province of Buchan. Buchan was the first Mormaerdom in the High Medieval Kingdom of the Scots to pass into the hands of a non-Scottish family in the male line. The earldom had three lines in its history, not counting passings from female heirs to sons. Today, it is held by the Erskine family as a peerage. The current holder is Harry Erskine, 18th Earl of Buchan (b. 1960). Subsidiary titles are Lord Cardross and Lord Auchterhouse and Baron Erskine.

==Mormaerdom of Buchan==
The first recorded person who definitely held the position of mormaer was Gartnait, whose patronage is noted in the Gaelic Notes on the &quot;Book of Deer&quot;. The latter is the only significant source for the mormaerdom, and its existence makes Buchan one of Scotland&#x27;s best documented provinces for native cultural institutions. After the death of Fergus, before 1214, Buchan became the first native mormaerdom to pass into the hands of a foreign family, the Comyns, though only through marriage. Alexander Comyn, Earl of Buchan inherited and continued his mother&#x27;s title and line until it was conquered and forfeited during the Wars of Scottish Independence.
==1374 creation==
The title remained in crown hands until, later in the century, the title went to Alexander Stewart, the &quot;Wolf of Badenoch&quot;. By this point, however, Buchan was drastically truncated and no longer a provincial lordship.

==1469 creation==
In 1469 the earldom was conferred on James Stewart. He was made Lord Auchterhouse at the same time, also in the Peerage of Scotland. Stewart was the second son of Sir James Stewart, the Black Knight of Lorn, and the younger brother of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Atholl (see Earl of Atholl, 1457 creation). The title descended in the direct male line until the death of his grandson, John, the third Earl, in 1551. John&#x27;s only son by his first marriage, John Stewart, Master of Buchan, had been killed at the Battle of Pinkie in 1547. Buchan was therefore succeeded by his granddaughter, Christina, &quot;suo jure&quot; Countess of Buchan, the daughter of the Master of Buchan. She married Robert Douglas, son of Sir Robert Douglas of Lochleven and brother of William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton. Robert assumed the title of Earl of Buchan in right of his wife. He was succeeded by his daughter, Mary, &quot;suo jure&quot; Countess of Buchan. She married James Erskine, younger son of John Erskine, Earl of Mar. James assumed the earldom in right of his wife. In 1617 they were created by Royal charter Earl and Countess of Buchan, with remainder to the heirs male of the marriage, whom failing, to the legitimate and nearest heirs-male and assignees of the Earl. In 1633 the precedence of the earldom was established by Act of Parliament as 1469. This line of the family failed on the death of their grandson, the eighth Earl, who died unmarried in 1695. The title passed by the terms of the 1617 charter to the heirs male of the 6th Earl i.e. to the heirs male of his younger brother Henry Erskine (see below). Since 1695, the earls of Buchan are not heirs of line of the 1st Earl of Buchan.

The late Earl was succeeded by his kinsman David Erskine, 4th Lord Cardross, who became the ninth Earl. He was the great-grandson of Henry Erskine, younger brother of James Erskine, Earl of Buchan (of the 1617 creation; see Lord Cardross for earlier history of this branch of the Erskine family). His right to the earldom was acknowledged by the Scottish Parliament in 1698 and he later sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, the tenth Earl. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society. His eldest surviving son, David, the eleventh Earl, was the founder of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland but is best remembered as an eccentric. The latter was succeeded by his nephew, Henry, the twelfth Earl, the son of Henry Erskine, Lord Advocate, third son of the tenth Earl. In 1850 Caroline, the wife of the 12th Earl, and David the 13th Earl, both converted to Roman Catholicism.

The line of the twelfth Earl failed on the death of his great-grandson, the fifteenth Earl, who died unmarried in 1960. The fifteenth Earl was succeeded by his kinsman, Donald Erskine, 7th Baron Erskine, who became the sixteenth Earl. He was a descendant of Lord Chancellor Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine, fourth son of the tenth Earl (see Baron Erskine for earlier history of this branch of the family). , the titles are held by the sixteenth Earl&#x27;s grandson, the eighteenth Earl, who succeeded his father in that year.

The family seat is Newnham House, near Newnham, Hampshire.

<text>Claude Perrault (; 25 September 1613 – 9 October 1688) was a French physician and amateur architect, best known for his participation in the design of the east façade of the Louvre in Paris. He also designed the Paris Observatory and was an anatomist and author who wrote treatises on architecture, physics, and natural history.

His brother, Charles Perrault, is remembered as the classic reteller of the old story of Cinderella among other fables.

==Biography==
Perrault was born and died in Paris. 

As physician and natural philosopher, who received a medical degree from the University of Paris in 1642, Perrault became one of the first members of the French Academy of Sciences when it was founded in 1666.

A committee commissioned by Louis XIV, the Petit Conseil, comprising Louis Le Vau, Charles Le Brun, and Perrault, designed the east façade of the Louvre. It was begun in 1667 and was essentially complete in 1674. By 1680, Louis XIV had abandoned the Louvre and focused his attention on the Palace of Versailles. The wing behind the east façade was not finished until the 19th century with the advent of Napoleon. The definitive design of the east façade is attributed to Perrault, who made the final alterations needed to accommodate a decision to double the width of the south wing. He also created projects for the joining of the Louvre with the Tuileries Palace and may have devised the use of iron tie rods behind the entablature of the east façade in order to solve engineering problems arising from forces causing stress in the masonry.

Perrault designed the Paris Observatory (1667–1669), a research institute of the Académie des Sciences. His design for a triumphal arch on Rue St-Antoine was preferred over the competing designs of Le Brun and Le Vau, but was only partly executed in stone. When the arch was taken down in the 19th century, it was found that he had devised a means of interlocking the stones, without mortar, so that it had become an inseparable mass. He also created a design (unexecuted) which used free-standing columns for the reconstruction of the church of Sainte-Geneviève in Paris.

Aside from his participation in the design of the Louvre, he became well known for his translation into French of the ten books of Vitruvius, the only surviving Roman work on architecture. Begun at the instigation of Colbert, it was published, with Perrault&#x27;s annotations, in 1673. His treatise on the five classical orders of architecture followed in 1683.

In addition, he made a valuable contribution in acoustics. His treatise on sound was a part of the book &quot;Oeuvres diverses de Physique et de Mecanique&quot;. In his later book, he treats such subjects as sound media, sources of sound and sound receivers. In musical acoustics, he noted the importance of vibration on consonance and dissonance. His study &quot;De la Musique des Anciens&quot; in the &quot;Oeuvres diverses&quot; discussed how combinations of notes yields harmony. It also contains critical examinations of old manuscripts on European music.

<text>MS/8 or The RL Monitor System is a discontinued computer operating system developed for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-8 in 1966 by Richard F. Lary. 

==History==
RL Monitor System, as it was initially called, was developed on a 4K (12-bit) PDP-8 with &quot;a Teletype that had a paper tape reader and punch and .. a single DECtape.&quot; It was a disk oriented system, faster than its predecessor, the PDP-8 4K Disk Monitor System, with tricks to make it run quickly on DECtape based systems. 

Still named RL, it was submitted to DECUS in 1970. 

MS/8 was replaced by P?S/8 and COS-310.

<doc id="443101" wikidata="Q117785" url="?curid=443101" title="Finite impulse response">
<text>In signal processing, a finite impulse response (FIR) filter is a filter whose impulse response (or response to any finite length input) is of &quot;finite&quot; duration, because it settles to zero in finite time. This is in contrast to infinite impulse response (IIR) filters, which may have internal feedback and may continue to respond indefinitely (usually decaying).

The impulse response (that is, the output in response to a Kronecker delta input) of an Nth-order discrete-time FIR filter lasts exactly formula_1 samples (from first nonzero element through last nonzero element) before it then settles to zero.

FIR filters can be discrete-time or continuous-time, and digital or analog.

==Definition==

For a causal discrete-time FIR filter of order &quot;N&quot;, each value of the output sequence is a weighted sum of the most recent input values:

:formula_2

where:
*formula_3 is the input signal,
*formula_4 is the output signal,
*formula_5 is the filter order; an formula_5th-order filter has formula_7 terms on the right-hand side
*formula_8 is the value of the impulse response at the &quot;i&quot;&#x27;th instant for formula_9 of an formula_10-order FIR filter. If the filter is a direct form FIR filter then formula_8 is also a coefficient of the filter.

This computation is also known as discrete convolution.

The formula_12 in these terms are commonly referred to as &quot;s&quot;, based on the structure of a tapped delay line that in many implementations or block diagrams provides the delayed inputs to the multiplication operations. One may speak of a &quot;5th order/6-tap filter&quot;, for instance.

The impulse response of the filter as defined is nonzero over a finite duration. Including zeros, the impulse response is the infinite sequence:
:formula_13

If an FIR filter is non-causal, the range of nonzero values in its impulse response can start before formula_14, with the defining formula appropriately generalized.

==Properties==

An FIR filter has a number of useful properties which sometimes make it preferable to an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter. FIR filters:
*Require no feedback. This means that any rounding errors are not compounded by summed iterations. The same relative error occurs in each calculation. This also makes implementation simpler.
*Are inherently stable, since the output is a sum of a finite number of finite multiples of the input values, so can be no greater than formula_15 times the largest value appearing in the input.
*Can easily be designed to be linear phase by making the coefficient sequence symmetric. This property is sometimes desired for phase-sensitive applications, for example data communications, seismology, crossover filters, and mastering.

The main disadvantage of FIR filters is that considerably more computation power in a general purpose processor is required compared to an IIR filter with similar sharpness or selectivity, especially when low frequency (relative to the sample rate) cutoffs are needed. However, many digital signal processors provide specialized hardware features to make FIR filters approximately as efficient as IIR for many applications.

==Frequency response==

The filter&#x27;s effect on the sequence formula_16 is described in the frequency domain by the convolution theorem:

:formula_17     and     formula_18

where operators formula_19 and formula_20 respectively denote the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) and its inverse. Therefore, the complex-valued, multiplicative function formula_21 is the filter&#x27;s frequency response. It is defined by a Fourier series:

:formula_22

where the added subscript denotes formula_23-periodicity. Here formula_24 represents frequency in normalized units (&quot;radians per sample&quot;). The function formula_25 has a periodicity of formula_26 with formula_27 in units of &quot;cycles per sample&quot;, which is favored by many filter design applications.  The value formula_28, called Nyquist frequency, corresponds to formula_29  When the sequence formula_16 has a known sampling-rate formula_31 (in &quot;samples per second&quot;), ordinary frequency is related to normalized frequency by formula_32 &quot;cycles per second&quot; (Hz). Conversely, if one wants to design a filter for ordinary frequencies formula_33 formula_34 etc., using an application that expects &quot;cycles per sample&quot;, one would enter formula_35  formula_36  etc.

formula_37 can also be expressed in terms of the Z-transform of the filter impulse response:

:formula_38

:formula_39

==Filter design==

FIR filters are designed by finding the coefficients and filter order that meet certain specifications, which can be in the time domain (e.g. a matched filter) or the frequency domain (most common). Matched filters perform a cross-correlation between the input signal and a known pulse shape. The FIR convolution is a cross-correlation between the input signal and a time-reversed copy of the impulse response. Therefore, the matched filter&#x27;s impulse response is &quot;designed&quot; by sampling the known pulse-shape and using those samples in reverse order as the coefficients of the filter.

When a particular frequency response is desired, several different design methods are common:
# Window design method
# Frequency sampling method
# Least MSE (mean square error) method
# Parks–McClellan method (also known as the equiripple, optimal, or minimax method). The Remez exchange algorithm is commonly used to find an optimal equiripple set of coefficients. Here the user specifies a desired frequency response, a weighting function for errors from this response, and a filter order &quot;N&quot;. The algorithm then finds the set of formula_40 coefficients that minimize the maximum deviation from the ideal. Intuitively, this finds the filter that is as close as possible to the desired response given that only formula_40 coefficients can be used. This method is particularly easy in practice since at least one text includes a program that takes the desired filter and &quot;N&quot;, and returns the optimum coefficients.
# Equiripple FIR filters can be designed using the DFT algorithms as well. The algorithm is iterative in nature. The DFT of an initial filter design is computed using the FFT algorithm (if an initial estimate is not available, h[n]=delta[n] can be used). In the Fourier domain, or DFT domain, the frequency response is corrected according to the desired specs, and the inverse DFT is then computed. In the time-domain, only the first N coefficients are kept (the other coefficients are set to zero). The process is then repeated iteratively: the DFT is computed once again, correction applied in the frequency domain and so on.

Software packages such as MATLAB, GNU Octave, Scilab, and SciPy provide convenient ways to apply these different methods.

=== Window design method ===

In the window design method, one first designs an ideal IIR filter and then truncates the infinite impulse response by multiplying it with a finite length window function. The result is a finite impulse response filter whose frequency response is modified from that of the IIR filter. Multiplying the infinite impulse by the window function in the time domain results in the frequency response of the IIR being convolved with the Fourier transform (or DTFT) of the window function. If the window&#x27;s main lobe is narrow, the composite frequency response remains close to that of the ideal IIR filter.

The ideal response is often rectangular, and the corresponding IIR is a sinc function. The result of the frequency domain convolution is that the edges of the rectangle are tapered, and ripples appear in the passband and stopband. Working backward, one can specify the slope (or width) of the tapered region (&quot;transition band&quot;) and the height of the ripples, and thereby derive the frequency-domain parameters of an appropriate window function. Continuing backward to an impulse response can be done by iterating a filter design program to find the minimum filter order. Another method is to restrict the solution set to the parametric family of Kaiser windows, which provides closed form relationships between the time-domain and frequency domain parameters. In general, that method will not achieve the minimum possible filter order, but it is particularly convenient for automated applications that require dynamic, on-the-fly, filter design.

The window design method is also advantageous for creating efficient half-band filters, because the corresponding sinc function is zero at every other sample point (except the center one). The product with the window function does not alter the zeros, so almost half of the coefficients of the final impulse response are zero. An appropriate implementation of the FIR calculations can exploit that property to double the filter&#x27;s efficiency.

=== Least mean square error (MSE) method ===
Goal:
:To design FIR filter in the MSE sense, we minimize the mean square error between the filter we obtained and the desired filter.
::formula_42 , where formula_43 is sampling frequency, formula_44 is the spectrum of the filter we obtained, and formula_45 is the spectrum of the desired filter.

Method:
:Given an &quot;N&quot;-point FIR filter formula_46, and formula_47.
:Step 1: Suppose formula_46even symmetric. Then, the discrete time Fourier transform of formula_49 is defined as 
::formula_50 
:Step 2: Calculate mean square error.
::formula_51
::Therefore,
::formula_52 
:Step 3: Minimize the mean square error by doing partial derivative of MSE with respect to formula_53
::formula_54
::After organization, we have
::formula_55
::formula_56 
:Step 4: Change formula_57 back to the presentation of formula_46
::formula_59 and formula_60

In addition, we can treat the importance of passband and stopband differently according to our needs by adding a weighted function, formula_61
Then, the MSE error becomes
:formula_62

==Moving average example==
A moving average filter is a very simple FIR filter. It is sometimes called a boxcar filter, especially when followed by decimation, or a sinc-in-frequency. The filter coefficients, formula_63, are found via the following equation:
:formula_64

To provide a more specific example, we select the filter order: 
:formula_65

The impulse response of the resulting filter is:
:formula_66

The block diagram on the right shows the second-order moving-average filter discussed below. The transfer function is:

:formula_67

The next figure shows the corresponding pole–zero diagram. Zero frequency (DC) corresponds to (1, 0), positive frequencies advancing counterclockwise around the circle to the Nyquist frequency at (−1, 0). Two poles are located at the origin, and two zeros are located at formula_68, formula_69.

The frequency response, in terms of normalized frequency &quot;ω&quot;, is:
:formula_70

The magnitude and phase components of formula_71 are plotted in the figure. But plots like these can also be generated by doing a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the impulse response. 
And because of symmetry, filter design or viewing software often displays only the [0, π] region. The magnitude plot indicates that the moving-average filter passes low frequencies with a gain near 1 and attenuates high frequencies, and is thus a crude low-pass filter. The phase plot is linear except for discontinuities at the two frequencies where the magnitude goes to zero. The size of the discontinuities is π, representing a sign reversal. They do not affect the property of linear phase, as illustrated in the final figure.

<doc id="443110" wikidata="Q161319" url="?curid=443110" title="Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg">
<text>Prince Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg (&quot;Guillaume Jean Joseph Marie&quot;; born 11 November 1981), is the heir apparent to the Luxembourg throne since October 2000 and regent of the country since October 2024, as the son of Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa. He is set to become Grand Duke on 3 October 2025 upon the abdication of his father.

==Early life and education==
Prince Guillaume was born on 11 November 1981 at the Grand Duchess Charlotte Maternity Hospital in Luxembourg City and is the eldest child of Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg and his wife, Cuban-born Grand Duchess Maria Teresa. His godparents are Princess Marie Astrid of Luxembourg and Prince Guillaume of Luxembourg. Guillaume has four younger siblings: Prince Félix, Prince Louis, Princess Alexandra and Prince Sébastien.

Guillaume&#x27;s education includes Lycée Robert-Schumann in Luxembourg; Swiss boarding schools the Institut Le Rosey and the Collège Alpin International Beau Soleil where he finished the French baccalaureate in 2001; and Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Camberley, England. He began his higher education studies in the United Kingdom where he studied at University College, Durham and Brunel University, both in England. In 2006 he entered Institut Philanthropos in Fribourg, Switzerland, where he spent a year studying philosophy and anthropology. He later studied letters and political science at the Institut Albert-le-Grand in Angers, receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree with honors in 2009. His degree was issued by Université d&#x27;Angers, as a result of a partnership agreement between the two schools. From 2018 until 2019, Prince Guillaume attended a postgraduate training at the Royal College of Defence Studies (RCDS) in London.

The Hereditary Grand Duke completed internships at the Belgian Chemical Union in 2003, at the Deutsche Bank in London in 2004, and at the Spanish branch of ArcelorMittal in 2005. Sworn in December 2002 as an officer in the Luxembourg Army, Prince Guillaume holds the rank of colonel.

== Hereditary Grand Duke ==
Guillaume has been heir apparent to the crown of Luxembourg since his father&#x27;s accession in 2000. On his future succession to the grand ducal throne, he will reign as Guillaume V (English: William V).

Guillaume became the honorary chairman of the Board of Economic Development of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, an agency for economic promotion and development, in March 2001. He has also been a member of the Council of State since 24 June 2005. He attended the Millennium Conference at the United Nations headquarters in New York City in 2005. Prince Guillaume also worked at the European Commission and the Permanent Representation of Luxembourg to the European Union in Brussels in 2012.

The Hereditary Grand Duke is patron of the Luxembourg Cycling Sport Federation, Youth Hostels Central, National Association of Road Victims, Chamber Orchestra of Luxembourg, Youth Harmony Orchestra of the European Union, as well as to Young Entrepreneurs Luxembourg and Special Olympics Luxembourg Associations.

During the summer of 1997, Guillaume participated as a member of Luxembourg Scout Movement in a humanitarian camp in Nepal. He was involved in a reforestation project and other actions for the benefit of less fortunate communities. In 2017, the Hereditary Grand Duke joined the board of directors of the World Scout Foundation to support the development of scouting around the world.

In 1999, he participated in a charitable mission in Aguascalientes to provide the educational and social assistance to young people in one of the most deprived areas in Mexico. After having chaired the Kräizbierg Foundation, which works for people with disabilities, for more than 10 years (2000–2011), the Hereditary Grand Duke accepted the title of honorary president in March 2011.

On 8 October 2024, as had been announced by Grand Duke Henri on his Official Birthday that year, Prince Guillaume was appointed as lieutenant representative (regent). Under this capacity, he assumed a number of his father&#x27;s constitutional powers, such as the swearing in of ambassadors and the signing of Grand Ducal Decrees. This is traditionally the first step in the abdication process in Luxembourg. On 24 December 2024, during his Christmas message, Henri announced that the abdication would take place on 3 October 2025.

==Marriage and fatherhood==
On interviews for his 30th birthday, he stated that he was in a relationship with a &quot;dear miss&quot; that had been going strong for more than a year but needed more time to evaluate their possible future. On 26 April 2012, the court announced the engagement of the Hereditary Grand Duke to the Belgian Countess Stéphanie de Lannoy. The civil wedding took place on Friday, 19 October 2012; the religious wedding took place on Saturday, 20 October 2012, at the Notre-Dame Cathedral.

Guillaume and Stéphanie have two sons, named Charles (born 10 May 2020) and François Henri Louis Marie Guillaume (born 27 March 2023), who are second and third in the line of succession to the throne of Luxembourg, respectively.

==Interests==
Guillaume is interested in music and sports; he plays the piano and enjoys football, swimming and volleyball. He speaks Luxembourgish, French, German, Spanish and English. He regularly represents his parents in many foreign activities.

<doc id="443111" wikidata="Q4881486" url="?curid=443111" title="Beith Juniors F.C.">
<text>Beith Juniors Football Club are a Scottish football club from the town of Beith, North Ayrshire. Members of the Scottish Junior Football Association, they compete in the West of Scotland Football League. Beith play at Bellsdale Park. Their main rival is Kilbirnie Ladeside.

==History==
Formed in 1938, they play in black and white strips (uniforms) and their nicknames are &quot;the Cabes&quot; or &quot;the Mighty&quot;. They were formed as a junior football successor to the disbanded senior side Beith, who had previously competed in the Scottish Football League.

In the club&#x27;s first season in 1939–40 they reached the District Cup Final and finished as runners up and then the second world war stopped football. In the 1940s the club were mostly a mid table club and reached the Ayrshire Cup final in 1948–49 but again finished as runners up. It wasn&#x27;t until 1954–55 that the club enjoyed cup success with the Ayrshire Cup and finished as league runners up the same season. There were 3 more finals in the decade, losing the District Cup in 1955–56 and the West of Scotland Cup in 1957–58 but won the West League Cup in 1956–57.

The 1960s started with the club winning the District Cup and then North Ayrshire league success in 1962–63, 1963–64, 1964–65, 1966–67, 1968–69 with the Ayrshire League being won in 1964–65 and 1968–69 as playoffs with the South Ayrshire champions. The club won two West of Scotland Cups in 1965–66 and 1966–67 after being runners up in 1964–65. The club embarked on an unbeaten 3 match tour of the Netherlands.

A relatively barren spell in the 1970s followed with an Ayrshire Cup win in 1977–78 and with runner up finishes in the Ayrshire League in 1978–79, North Ayrshire League in 1969–70, 1974–75 and 1975–76 and in District Cup in 1971–72, Supplementary Cup in 1974–75 and the League Cup in 1979–80.

The club won the League Cup in 1981–82, followed by relegation to the Ayrshire Second Division at the end of the 1982–83 season and won promotion back to the First Division as Second Division Champions in 1986–87 with the club ending as runners up in the Ayrshire Cup, Cunninghame Cup and League Cup in 1987–88 becoming the nearly men.

1990 seen the club appoint Dennis Gray as manager and seven trophy wins were earned during this tenure, back to back Ayrshire Cup wins in 1990–91 and 1991–92. District Cup wins in 1990–91 and 1994–95 alongside League Cup wins in 1991–92 and 1993–94 and the Cunninghame Cup in 1992–93. During this time Dennis Gray was appointed as Scotland Juniors manager and the club also came close to the title finishing runners up in 1994–95. Dennis Gray then left the club to become manager of Auchinleck Talbot where he was the club&#x27;s record scorer during a highly successful playing career. Dick Brock a former Scotland Juniors manager took over but unfortunately success didn&#x27;t follow and Frank Lynch was appointed manager for the 1996–97 season. Frank&#x27;s teams were known for long Scottish Junior Cup runs with the furthest being a Quarter Final replay loss in extra time to eventual winners Arthurlie in 1997–98. The closest to trophy success in this period was a League Cup final loss to Auchinleck Talbot in 1997–98.

The club then appointed former player Neil Muggins as manager and after an unsuccessful season he left and was replaced by Sandy McLean. There was league reconstruction at the end of 2000–01 season in preparation for the merger of the Ayrshire and Central Leagues and Division 1 was reduced to the top 7 teams and unfortunately Beith didn&#x27;t finish in the required place and started 2001–02 in the Second Division and had to finish in the top 4 to make the playoffs to qualify for the West of Scotland League second tier - the first division below the Premier. Brian Stevenson came in as manager and steered the club to a 3rd-place finish and Beith qualified for the West of Scotland Super League 1st division after beating Dalry Thistle in a two legged play off with the season ending with a North Ayrshire Cup Final loss to Kilbirnie at Largs.

The manager then resigned and Dennis Gray returned to the club as manager with former player Hugh Findlay as his assistant. This second tenure brought another 4 trophies to the club with another back to back success in the Ayrshire Cup in 2002–03 and 2003–04, North Ayrshire Cup in 2003–04 and the League Cup in 2004–05 finishing runners up in North Ayrshire Cup and Evening Times Cup in 2004–05. There were two Scottish Cup quarter finals in this period, losing both times to the eventual runners up in Linlithgow Rose in 2002–03 and Bathgate in 2005–06. Following Dennis retiring/resigning near the end of 2005–06 season, Frank Lynch was then appointed manager with John Millar as his assistant.

In his first season, Frank Lynch got the club promoted to the Premier Division finishing as runners up in the First Division in 2006–07. In March 2008 the following season Frank Lynch resigned as manager and John Millar stepped up to become Manager.

In 2008–09, the club won the West of Scotland Cup, beating Auchinleck Talbot 2–1 in the final at Pollok and after leading the league for a long period fell away and finished 3rd. In 2009–10 the following season they won the West Premier title by a then record number of points only losing one game, meaning they qualified for the senior Scottish Cup.

During the 2010–11 season, Beith entered the Scottish Cup at the first round stage after qualifying as champions of the West of Scotland Super League Premier Division. In the first round they defeated Linlithgow Rose 2–0 and Glasgow University 8–1 in the second round. In the third round they faced Second Division Airdrie United and led 2–0 with ten minutes remaining of the tie at the Excelsior Stadium, before full-back Marc McShane was red carded. Paul Lovering scored from the resulting cross and Jamie Bain equalised in injury time. Beith were then defeated 4–3 in the replay at Bellsdale Park.

The end of the 2010–11 saw numerous key players leave the club through captain Brian McKeown emigrating to Australia, and other players in Martin McGarvey, Martin Stewart and Craig Brittain retiring along with John Millar resigning as manager for personal reasons. Stevie Easton was then appointed as Manager with Harry Erwin assisting. The club finished 5th in season 2011–12 and following a poor start to the 2012–13 saw Stevie Easton being relieved of his duties in November 2012 with Frank Lynch returning to the club to steady the ship but ultimately unable to change the club&#x27;s fortunes left the club to see if someone else could come in to boost the club and avoid relegation. John Millar then came back re-invigorated and got some good results but unfortunately with suspensions and injuries taking their toll lost the last game away to Shotts to be relegated.

The club led the West of Scotland Super League first division for most of the 2013–14 season but were over-taken by a strong Troon team but still finished the season promoted as runners up with a record total for being runners up in that division. That season also seen a penalty shoot out loss in the League Cup final at Troon v Cumnock.

Season 2014–15 saw the club back in the Premier League and consolidated their place in the league with a 6th-place finish and the end of that season seen a turnover of 10 players leaving and 10 players coming in to make a strong push.

Following an inconsistent start to the season no doubt due to the large turnover in the playing staff and then the club won the Scottish Junior Cup for the first time in 2015–16, defeating Pollok on penalties after a 1–1 draw.

During the 2016–17 season the club entered the Scottish Cup, progressing through two preliminary rounds to the 3rd round where they were defeated by Greenock Morton, 6–0 at Bellsdale Park.

During the 2017–18 season, the club won the West Region Premiership title, pipping Auchinleck Talbot by one point on the final day of the league season. The club then won the Evening Times Champions Cup on the final night of the season, a Friday at Benburb beating Petershill in the final.

During the 2018–19, Beith Juniors progressed through two preliminary rounds and the 1st and 2nd round proper to play against Championship leaders at the time, Ayr United making this the first all Ayrshire Junior and Senior Scottish Cup tie, Beith holding the Honest Men for 62 minutes before conceding then losing two goals in the last five minutes after trying to chase a result to lose 3–0. The club won the West of Scotland Cup in the final game of the season, beating Kirkintilloch Rob Roy in the final at Meadow Park.

Under the management of Chris Strain, Beith won back–to–back league titles in the 2022–23 and 2023–24 seasons, but on both occasions were ineligible to participate in the Lowland Football League promotion play-offs as the club did not hold the required SFA Licence.

<text>Bellshill Athletic Football Club is a Scottish football club based in the town of Bellshill, North Lanarkshire. It plays in the .

==History==
The history of the club can be traced back as far as 1897 when Bellshill Athletic were founded as a Juvenile club who played at Hawthorn Park. After two successful years as a Juvenile club, Athletic transferred to Junior level. The area had three other clubs at this time - Bellshill Thistle, Mossend Celtic and Mossend Brigade. On 6 August 1902 Bellshill merged with another local club, Clydesdale Wanderers, to form Bellshill &amp; Clydesdale United. This new club only lasted for two seasons before folding, meanwhile a new Bellshill Athletic had been set-up in 1903 and this is the club that still exists today. In 1973, a Mossend pub named The Derby Inn became sponsors, after which the club became the first in Britain to have a sponsor displayed on their shirt.

The club&#x27;s early years had it based at many homes. These included Orbiston Park, Douglas Park and Brigade park. The club&#x27;s previous ground, Brandon Park, was officially opened in 1903 in a friendly against Blantyre Victoria in the month of August that year. On the club&#x27;s centenary year, they were then based at a new location, New Brandon Park, in the Hattonrigg area of the town. However, due to legal matters with the owner, the club were forced to abandon the ground and, after a brief stint in Blantyre, were permitted to move temporarily to the local Sir Matt Busby Sports Complex. After this agreement expired, the club entered a groundsharing arrangement with Vale of Clyde at their Fullarton Park ground in Tollcross, Glasgow for the 2011–12 season. In 2015, the club moved back to Bellshill at Rockburn Park, while planning to move to a new community facility at Bellshill Academy.

The largest crowd seen in the club&#x27;s history was around about 10,000 people who witnessed a Scottish cup sixth round tie against St Roch&#x27;s. The game ended in a victory for St Roch&#x27;s.

Professional footballer Billy Moffatt started his playing career at Belshill Athletic.

Professional footballer Hughie Gallacher also started his playing career at Bellshill Athletic, before becoming the last person to captain Newcastle United to a top division title. 

Bellshill have played at Junior level since 1899, with an exception of a short spell (1927–1931) during which they played in the Intermediate League. As Juniors they have played in four different leagues: The Lanarkshire League, The Scottish League, Central League and the present West Region. The club were to suffer relegation from the Stagecoach Super League Premier Division in season 2009–10.
