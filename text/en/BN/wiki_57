<text>The CFM International CFM56 (U.S. military designation F108) series is a Franco-American family of high-bypass turbofan aircraft engines made by CFM International (CFMI), with a thrust range of . CFMI is a 50–50 joint-owned company of Safran Aircraft Engines (formerly known as Snecma) of France, and GE Aerospace (GE) of the United States. GE produces the high-pressure compressor, combustor, and high-pressure turbine, Safran manufactures the fan, gearbox, exhaust and the low-pressure turbine, and some components are made by Avio of Italy and Honeywell from the US. Both companies have their own final assembly line, GE in Evendale, Ohio, and Safran in Villaroche, France. The engine initially had extremely slow sales but has gone on to become the most used turbofan aircraft engine in the world.

The CFM56 first ran in 1974. By April 1979, the joint venture had not received a single order in five years and was two weeks away from being dissolved. The program was saved when Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Flying Tigers chose the CFM56 to re-engine their Douglas DC-8 aircraft as part of the Super 70 program. The first engines entered service in 1982. The CFM56 was later selected to re-engine the Boeing 737. Boeing initially expected this re-engine program (later named the Boeing 737 Classic) to sell only modestly, but in fact the CFM56&#x27;s lower noise and lower fuel consumption (compared to older engines for the 737) led to strong sales.

In 1987, the IAE V2500 engine for the A320, which had beaten the CFM56 in early sales of the A320, ran into technical trouble, leading many customers to switch to the CFM56. However, the CFM56 was not without its own issues; several fan blade failure incidents were experienced during early service, including one failure that was a cause of the Kegworth air disaster, and some CFM56 variants experienced problems when flying through rain or hail. Both of these issues were resolved with engine modifications.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Research into the next generation of commercial jet engines, high-bypass ratio turbofans in the &quot;10-ton&quot; (20,000 lbf; 89 kN) thrust class, began in the late 1960s. Snecma (now Safran), who had mostly built military engines previously, was the first company to seek entrance into the market by searching for a partner with commercial experience to design and build an engine in this class. They considered Pratt &amp; Whitney, Rolls-Royce, and GE Aviation as potential partners, and after two company executives, Gerhard Neumann from GE and René Ravaud from Snecma, introduced themselves at the 1971 Paris Air Show a decision was made. The two companies saw mutual benefit in the collaboration and met several more times, fleshing out the basics of the joint project.

At the time, Pratt &amp; Whitney dominated the commercial market. GE needed an engine in this market class, and Snecma had previous experience of working with them, collaborating on the production of the CF6-50 turbofan for the Airbus A300. Pratt &amp; Whitney was considering upgrading their JT8D to compete in the same class as the CFM56 as a sole venture, while Rolls-Royce dealt with financial issues that precluded them from starting new projects; this situation caused GE to gain the title of best partner for the program.

A major reason for GE&#x27;s interest in the collaboration, rather than building a 10-ton engine on their own, was that the Snecma project was the only source of development funds for an engine in this class at this particular time. GE was initially considering only contributing technology from its CF6 engine rather than its much more advanced F101 engine, developed for the B-1 Lancer supersonic bomber. The company was faced with a dilemma when the United States Air Force (USAF) announced its Advanced Medium STOL Transport (AMST) project in 1972 which included funding for the development of a 10-ton engine – either to build a &quot;limited&quot; technology 10-ton engine with Snecma, or a similar engine with &quot;advanced&quot; technology on their own. Concerned that the company would be left with only the &quot;limited&quot; engine in its portfolio if it did not win the Air Force contract (for which it was competing with Pratt &amp; Whitney and a General Motors division with its &quot;advanced&quot; engine), GE decided to apply for an export license for the F101 core technology.

=== Export issues ===
GE applied for the export license in 1972 as their primary contribution to the 10-ton engine project. The United States Department of State&#x27;s Office of Munitions Control recommended the rejection of the application on national security grounds; specifically because the core technology was an aspect of a strategic national defense system (B-1 bomber), it was built with Department of Defense funding, and that exporting the technology to France would limit the number of American workers on the project. The official decision was made in a National Security Decision Memorandum signed by the National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger on 19 September 1972.

While national security concerns were cited as the grounds for rejection, politics played an important role as well. The project, and the export issue associated with it, was considered so important that French President Georges Pompidou appealed directly to U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1971 to approve the deal, and Henry Kissinger brought the issue up with President Pompidou in a 1972 meeting. GE reportedly argued at the highest levels that having half of the market was better than having none of it, which they believed would happen if Snecma pursued the engine on their own without GE&#x27;s contribution. Nixon administration officials feared that this project could be the beginning of the end of American aerospace leadership.

There was also speculation that the rejection may have been, in part, retaliation for French involvement in convincing the Swiss not to purchase American-made LTV A-7 Corsair II aircraft that had been competing against a French design, the Dassault Milan. In the end, the Swiss did not purchase either aircraft, opting for the Northrop F-5E Tiger II instead.

==== 1973 Nixon–Pompidou meeting ====
Despite the export license being rejected, both the French and GE continued to push the Nixon Administration for permission to export the F101 technology. Efforts continued throughout the months following the rejection, culminating in the engine becoming an agenda topic during the 1973 meeting of Presidents Nixon and Pompidou in Reykjavík. Discussions at this meeting resulted in an agreement that allowed the development of the CFM56 to proceed. Contemporary reports state that the agreement was based on assurances that the core of the engine, the part that GE was developing from the military F101, would be built in the U.S. and then transported to France in order to protect the sensitive technologies. The joint venture also agreed to pay the U.S. an $80 million royalty fee (calculated at $20,000 per engine predicted to be built) as repayment for the development money provided by the government for the F101 engine core. Documents declassified in 2007 revealed that a key aspect of the CFM56 export agreement was that the French government agreed not to seek tariffs against American aircraft being imported into Europe.

=== CFM International ===
With the export issue settled, GE and Snecma finalized the agreement that formed CFM International (CFMI), a 50–50 joint company that would be responsible for producing and marketing the 10-ton engine, the CFM56. The venture was officially founded in 1974. The &quot;CF&quot; in the engine name stands for GE&#x27;s designation for commercial turbofan engines, while the &quot;M56&quot; is the name of Snecma&#x27;s original engine proposal. The two primary roles for CFMI were to manage the program between GE and Snecma, and to market, sell and service the engine at a single point of contact for the customer. CFMI was made responsible for the day-to-day decision making for the project, while major decisions (developing a new variant, for example) required the go-ahead from GE and Snecma management.

The CFMI board of directors is currently split evenly between Snecma and GE (five members each). There are two vice presidents, one from each company, who support the President of CFMI. The president tends to be drawn from Snecma and sits at CFMI&#x27;s headquarters near GE in Cincinnati, Ohio.

The work split between the two companies gave GE responsibility for the high-pressure compressor (HPC), the combustor, and the high-pressure turbine (HPT); Snecma was responsible for the fan, the low-pressure compressor (LPC), and the low-pressure turbine (LPT). Snecma was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving the nacelle design, and was initially responsible for the gearbox, but shifted that work to GE when it became apparent that it would be more efficient for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.

== Development ==

=== Overview ===
Development work on the CFM56 began before CFMI was formally created. While work proceeded smoothly, the international arrangement led to unique working conditions. For example, both companies had assembly lines, some engines were assembled and tested in the U.S. and others in France. Engines assembled in France were subject to the initially strict export agreement, which meant that GE&#x27;s core was built in the U.S., then shipped to the Snecma plant in France where it was placed in a locked room into which even the President of Snecma was not allowed. The Snecma components (the fore and aft sections of the engine) were brought into the room, GE employees mounted them to the core, and then the assembled engine was taken out to be finished.

The first completed CFM56 engine first ran at GE plant in Evendale on 20 June 1974 with the second running in October 1974. The second engine was then shipped to France and first ran there on 13 December 1974. These first engines were considered &quot;production hardware&quot; as opposed to test examples and were designated as the CFM56-2, the first variant of the CFM56.

The engine flew for the first time in February 1977 when it replaced one of the four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D engines on the McDonnell Douglas YC-15, an entrant in the Air Force&#x27;s Advanced Medium STOL Transport (AMST) competition. Soon after, the second CFM56 was mounted on a Sud Aviation Caravelle at the Snecma flight test center in France. This engine had a slightly different configuration with a long bypass duct and mixed exhaust flow, rather than a short bypass duct with unmixed exhaust flow. It was the first to include a &quot;Thrust Management System&quot;.

=== First customers ===
After testing the engine for several years, both in the air and on the ground, CFMI searched for customers outside of a possible AMST contract. The main targets were re-engine contracts for the Douglas DC-8 and the Boeing 707 airliners, including the related military tanker, the KC-135 Stratotanker. There was little initial interest in the engine, but Boeing realized that the CFM56 might be a solution to upcoming noise regulations. After announcing that a 707 would be configured with the CFM56 engine for flight tests in 1977, Boeing officially offered the 707-320 with the CFM56 engine as an option in 1978. The new variant was listed as the 707-700. Due to limited interest from the airlines in a re-engined 707, Boeing ended the 707-700 program in 1980 without selling any aircraft. Despite the lack of sales, having the commercial 707 available with the CFM56 helped the engine&#x27;s competitiveness for the KC-135 re-engine contract.

==== KC-135R ====
Winning the contract to re-engine the KC-135 tanker fleet for the USAF would be a huge boon to the CFM56 project (with more than 600 aircraft available to re-engine), and CFMI aggressively pursued that goal as soon as the Request For Proposals (RFP) was announced in 1977. Like other aspects of the program, international politics played their part in this contract. In efforts to boost the CFM56&#x27;s chances versus its competitors, the Pratt &amp; Whitney TF33 and an updated Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D, the French government announced in 1978 that they would upgrade their 11 KC-135s with the CFM56, providing one of the first orders for the engine.

The USAF announced the CFM56 as the winner of the re-engine contract in January 1980. Officials indicated that they were excited at the prospect of replacing the Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 engines currently flying on the KC-135A aircraft, calling them &quot;...the noisiest, dirtiest, [and] most fuel inefficient powerplant still flying&quot; at the time. The re-engined aircraft was designated the KC-135R. The CFM56 brought many benefits to the KC-135, decreasing takeoff distance by as much as 3,500 ft (1,100 m), decreasing overall fuel usage by 25%, greatly reducing noise (24 dB lower) and lowering total life cycle cost. With those benefits in mind, the United States Navy selected the CFM56-2 to power their variant of the Boeing 707, the E-6 Mercury, in 1982. In 1984 the Royal Saudi Air Force selected the CFM56-2 to power their E-3 Sentry aircraft (also related to the 707 airframe). The CFM56-2-powered E-3 also became the standard configuration for aircraft purchased by the British and French.

==== DC-8 ====

By the end of the 1970s, airlines were considering upgrading their aging Douglas DC-8 aircraft as an alternative to buying new quieter and more efficient aircraft. Following the French KC-135 order in 1978, the April 1979 decision by United Airlines to upgrade 30 of their DC-8-61 aircraft with the CFM56-2 was important for securing the development of the CFM56; GE and Snecma were two weeks away from freezing development had that order not materialized. This decision marked the first commercial purchase (rather than government/military) of the engine, and Delta Air Lines and Flying Tiger Line soon followed suit, giving the CFM56 a firm footing in both the military and commercial market.

==== Boeing 737 ====
In the early 1980s Boeing selected the CFM56-3 to exclusively power the Boeing 737-300 variant. The 737 wings were closer to the ground than previous applications for the CFM56, necessitating several modifications to the engine. The fan diameter was reduced, which reduced the bypass ratio, and the engine accessory gearbox was moved from the bottom of the engine (the 6 o&#x27;clock position) to the 9 o&#x27;clock position, giving the engine nacelle its distinctive flat-bottomed shape. The overall thrust was also reduced, from , mostly due to the reduction in bypass ratio.

Since the small initial launch order for twenty 737-300s split between two airlines, over 5,000 Boeing 737 aircraft had been delivered with CFM56 turbofans by April 2010.

=== Continued development ===
==== Tech56 and Tech Insertion ====
In 1998, CFMI launched the &quot;Tech56&quot; development and demonstration program to create an engine for the new single-aisle aircraft that were expected to be built by Airbus and Boeing. The program focused on developing a large number of new technologies for the theoretical future engine, not necessarily creating an all-new design. When it became clear that Boeing and Airbus were not going to build all-new aircraft to replace the 737 and A320, CFMI decided to apply some of those Tech56 technologies to the CFM56 in the form of the &quot;Tech Insertion&quot; program which focused on three areas: fuel efficiency, maintenance costs and emissions. Launched in 2004, the package included redesigned high-pressure compressor blades, an improved combustor, and improved high- and low-pressure turbine components which resulted in better fuel efficiency and lower nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. The new components also reduced engine wear, lowering maintenance costs by about 5%. The engines entered service in 2007, and all new CFM56-5B and CFM56-7B engines are being built with the Tech Insertion components. CFMI also offers the components as an upgrade kit for existing engines.

==== CFM56-7B &quot;Evolution&quot; ====
In 2009, CFMI announced the latest upgrade to the CFM56 engine, the &quot;CFM56-7B Evolution&quot; or CFM56-7BE. This upgrade, announced with improvements to Boeing&#x27;s 737 Next Generation, further enhances the high- and low-pressure turbines with better aerodynamics, as well as improving engine cooling, and aims to reduce overall part count. CFMI expected the changes to result in a 4% reduction in maintenance costs and a 1% improvement in fuel consumption (2% improvement including the airframe changes for the new 737); flight and ground tests completed in May 2010 revealed that the fuel burn improvement was better than expected at 1.6%. Following 450 hours of testing, the CFM56-7BE engine was certified by FAA and EASA on 30 July 2010 and delivered from mid-2011.

The CFM56-5B/3 PIP (Performance Improvement Package) engine includes these new technologies and hardware changes to lower fuel burn and lower maintenance cost. Airbus A320s were to use this engine version starting in late 2011.

==== LEAP ====

The LEAP is a new engine design based on and designed to replace the CFM56 series, with 16% efficiency savings by using more composite materials and achieving higher bypass ratios of over 10:1. LEAP entered service in 2016.

== Operational history ==
As of June 2016, the CFM56 is the most-used high-bypass turbofan. It has achieved more than 800 million engine flight hours, and at a rate of one million flight hours every eight days it is expected to have achieved one billion flight hours by 2020. It has more than 550 operators and more than 2,400 CFM56-powered jet aircraft are in the air at any given moment. It is known for its dependability: its average time on wing is 30,000 hours before a first shop visit, with the current fleet record at 50,000 hours.

As of July 2016, 30,000 engines have been built: 9,860 CFM56-5 engines for the Airbus A320ceo and A340-200/300 and more than 17,300 CFM56-3/-7B engines for the Boeing 737 Classic and 737NG. In July 2016, CFM had 3,000 engines in backlog. Lufthansa, launch customer for the CFM56-5C-powered A340, have an engine with more than 100,000 flight hours, having entered commercial service on 16 November 1993, overhauled four times since. In 2016 CFM delivered 1,665 CFM56 and booked 876 orders, it plans to produce CFM56 spare parts until 2045.

By October 2017, CFM had delivered more than 31,000 engines and 24,000 were in service with 560 operators, it attained 500 million flight cycles and 900 million flight hours, including over 170 million cycles and 300 million hours since 1998 for the B737NG&#x27;s -7B and over 100 million cycles and 180 million hours for the A320ceo&#x27;s -5B since 1996. By June 2018, 32,645 were delivered. Strong demand will extend production to 2020, up from 2019.

Exhaust gas temperature margin erodes with usage. One or two performance restoration shop visits, costing $0.3-$0.6m for a -5 series, can be performed before taking the engine off wing, which can restore 60% to 80% of the original margin. Once restored, the life limited parts must be replaced after: 20,000 cycles for the hot section ($0.5m), 25,000 for the axial compressor, and 30,000 for the fan and booster ($0.5m-$0.7m) for a recent CFM56. The whole engine parts cost more than $3m, $3.5 to $4m with the shop work-hours, around $150 per cycle.

By June 2019, the CFM56 fleet had surpassed one billion engine flight hours (nearly 115,000 years), having carried more than 35 billion people, over eight million times around the world.

The CFM56 production will wind down as the final 737NG engine was delivered in 2019 and the last A320ceo engine will be delivered in May 2020. Production will continue at low levels for military 737s and spare engines and will conclude around 2024.

Unit cost: US$10.0 million (list price)

== Design ==

=== Summary ===
The CFM56 is a high-bypass turbofan engine (most of the air accelerated by the fan bypasses the core of the engine and is exhausted out of the fan case) with several variants having bypass ratios ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000 lbf (80 kN to 150 kN) of thrust. The variants share a common design, and differ only in details. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning that there are two rotating shafts, one high-pressure and one low-pressure. Each is powered by its own turbine section (the high-pressure and low-pressure turbines, respectively). The fan and the booster (low-pressure compressor) evolved over the different iterations of the engine, as did the compressor, combustor and turbine sections.

=== Combustor ===
Most variants of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is injected into the airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. This contrasts with a can combustor, where each combustion chamber is separate, and a cannular combustor which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a hydromechanical unit (HMU) built by Honeywell. It regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine by means of an electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).

In 1989, CFMI began work on a new, double-annular combustor. Instead of having just one combustion zone, the double-annular combustor has a second combustion zone that is used at high thrust levels. This design lowers the emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NO&quot;x&quot;) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The first CFM56 engine with the double-annular combustor entered service in 1995, and the combustor is used on CFM56-5B and CFM56-7B variants with the suffix &quot;/2&quot; on their nameplates.

GE started developing and testing a new type of combustor called the Twin Annular Premixing Swirler combustor, or &quot;TAPS&quot;, during the Tech 56 program. This design is similar to the double-annular combustor in that it has two combustion zones; this combustor &quot;swirls&quot; the flow, creating an ideal fuel–air mixture. This difference allows the combustor to generate much less NO&quot;x&quot; than other combustors. Tests on a CFM56-7B engine demonstrated an improvement of 46% over single-annular combustors and 22% over double-annular combustors. The analytical tools developed for TAPS have also been used to improve other combustors, notably the single-annular combustors in some CFM56-5B and -7B engines.

=== Compressor ===
The high-pressure compressor (HPC), that was at the center of the original export controversy, features nine stages in all variants of the CFM56. The compressor stages have been developed from GE&#x27;s &quot;GE1/9 core&quot; (namely a single-turbine, nine-compressor stage design) which was designed in a compact core rotor. The small span of the compressor radius meant that the entire engine could be lighter and smaller, as the accessory units in the system (bearings, oiling systems) could be merged to the main fueling system running on aviation fuel. As design evolved &quot;HPC&quot; design improved through better airfoil design. As part of the Tech-56 improvement program CFMI has tested the new CFM-56 model with six-stage high-pressure compressor stages (discs that make up the compressor system) that was designed to deliver same pressure ratios (pressure gain 30) similar to the old nine-stages compressor design. The new one was not fully replacing the old one, but it offered an upgrade in HPC, thanks to improved blade dynamics, as a part of their &quot;Tech Insertion&quot; management plan from 2007.

=== Exhaust ===
CFMI tested both a mixed and unmixed exhaust design at the beginning of development; most variants of the engine have an unmixed exhaust nozzle. Only the high-power CFM56-5C, designed for the Airbus A340, has a mixed-flow exhaust nozzle.

GE and Snecma also tested the effectiveness of chevrons on reducing jet noise. After examining configurations in the wind tunnel, CFMI chose to flight-test chevrons built into the core exhaust nozzle. The chevrons reduced jet noise by 1.3 perceived loudness decibels during takeoff conditions, and are now offered as an option with the CFM56 for the Airbus A321.

=== Fan and booster ===
The CFM56 features a single-stage fan, and most variants have a three-stage booster on the low-pressure shaft, with four stages in the -5B and -5C variants. The booster is also commonly called the &quot;low-pressure compressor&quot; (LPC) as it is part of the low-pressure spool and continues the air compression done by the inner part of the fan before it reaches the high-pressure compressor. The original CFM56-2 variant featured 44 tip-shrouded fan blades, although the number of fan blades was reduced in later variants as wide-chord blade technology developed, down to 22 blades in the CFM56-7 variant.

The CFM56 fan features dovetailed fan blades which allows them to be replaced without removing the entire engine, and GE/Snecma claim that the CFM56 was the first engine to have that capability. This attachment method is useful for circumstances where only a few fan blades need to be repaired or replaced, such as following bird strikes.

The fan diameter varies with the different models of the CFM56, and that change has a direct impact on the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).

=== Thrust reverser ===
The CFM56 is designed to support several thrust reverser systems which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the Boeing 737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of thrust reverser. This type of thrust reverse consists of sleeves that slide back to expose mesh-like cascades and blocker doors that block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing the thrust of the engine and slowing the aircraft down.

The CFM56 also supports pivoting-door type thrust reversers. This type is used on the CFM56-5 engines that power many Airbus aircraft such as the Airbus A320. They work by actuating a door that pivots down into the bypass duct, both blocking the bypass air and deflecting the flow outward, creating the reverse thrust.

=== Turbine ===
All variants of the CFM56 feature a single-stage high-pressure turbine (HPT). In some variants, the HPT blades are &quot;grown&quot; from a single crystal superalloy, giving them high strength and creep resistance. The low-pressure turbine (LPT) features four stages in most variants of the engine, but the CFM56-5C has a five-stage LPT. This change was implemented to drive the larger fan on this variant. Improvements to the turbine section were examined during the Tech56 program, and one development was an aerodynamically optimized low-pressure turbine blade design, which would have used 20% fewer blades for the whole low-pressure turbine, saving weight. Some of those Tech56 improvements made their way into the Tech Insertion package, where the turbine section was updated. The turbine section was updated again in the &quot;Evolution&quot; upgrade.

The high-pressure turbine stages in the CFM56 are internally cooled by air from the high-pressure compressor. The air passes through internal channels in each blade and ejects at the leading and trailing edges.

== Variants ==

=== CFM56-2 series ===
The CFM56-2 series is the original variant of the CFM56. It is most widely used in military applications where it is known as the F108; specifically in the KC-135, the E-6 Mercury and some E-3 Sentry aircraft. The CFM56-2 comprises a single-stage fan with 44 blades, with a three-stage LP compressor driven by a four-stage LP turbine, and a nine-stage HP compressor driven by a single-stage HP turbine. The combustor is annular.

=== CFM56-3 series ===
The first derivative of the CFM56 series, the CFM56-3 was designed for Boeing 737 Classic series (737-300/-400/-500), with static thrust ratings from . A &quot;cropped fan&quot; derivative of the -2, the -3 engine has a smaller fan diameter at 60 in (1.5 m) but retains the original basic engine layout. The new fan was primarily derived from GE&#x27;s CF6-80 turbofan rather than the CFM56-2, and the booster was redesigned to match the new fan.

A significant challenge for this series was achieving ground clearance for the wing-mounted engine. This was overcome by reducing the intake fan diameter and relocating the gearbox and other accessories from beneath the engine to the sides. The resulting flattened nacelle bottom and intake lip yielded the distinctive appearance of the Boeing 737 with CFM56 engines.

=== CFM56-4 series ===
The CFM56-4 series was a proposed improved version of the CFM56-2 designed for the Airbus A320 family of aircraft. Competing with the RJ500 engine being developed by Rolls-Royce, the -4 series was designed to produce 25,000 lbf (110 kN) and was to feature a new 68 in (1.73 m) fan, a new low-pressure compressor and a full authority digital engine controller (FADEC). Soon after the upgrade project was launched in 1984, International Aero Engines offered their new V2500 engine for the A320. CFMI realized that the CFM56-4 did not compare favorably with the new engine and scrapped the project to begin working on the CFM56-5 series.

=== CFM56-5 series ===

The CFM56-5 series is designed for the Airbus aircraft and has a very wide thrust rating of between . It has three distinct sub-variants; the CFM56-5A, CFM56-5B and CFM56-5C, and differs from its Boeing 737 Classic-fitted cousins by featuring a FADEC and incorporating further aerodynamic design improvements.

==== CFM56-5A series ====
The CFM56-5A series is the initial CFM56-5 series, designed to power the short-to-medium range Airbus A320 family. Derived from the CFM56-2 and CFM56-3 families, the -5A series produces thrusts between 22,000 and 26,500 lbf (98 kN and 118 kN). Aerodynamic improvements such as an updated fan, low-pressure compressor, high-pressure compressor and combustor make this variant 10–11% more fuel efficient than its predecessors.

==== CFM56-5B series ====

An improvement of the CFM56-5A series, it was originally designed to power the A321. With a thrust range between 22,000 and 33,000 lbf (98 kN and 147 kN) it can power every model in the A320 family (A318/A319/A320/A321) and has superseded the CFM56-5A series. Among the changes from the CFM56-5A is the option of a double-annular combustor that reduces emissions (particularly NO&quot;x&quot;), a new fan in a longer fan case, and a new low-pressure compressor with a fourth stage (up from three in earlier variants). It is the most numerous engine supplied to Airbus.

==== CFM56-5C series ====
With a thrust rating of between 31,200 and 34,000 lbf (139 kN and 151 kN), the CFM56-5C series is the most powerful of the CFM56 family. It powers Airbus&#x27; long-range A340-200 and -300 airliners, and entered service in 1993. The major changes are a larger fan, a fifth low-pressure turbine stage, and the same four-stage low-pressure compressor found in the -5B variant.

Unlike every other variant of the CFM56, the -5C features a mixed-exhaust nozzle, which offers slightly higher efficiency.

=== CFM56-7 series ===
The CFM56-7 first ran on 21 April 1995. Rated with a takeoff thrust range of , it powers the -600/-700/-800/-900 Boeing 737 Next Generation; compared to the CFM56-3, it has greater durability, 8% fuel burn improvement and a 15% reduction in maintenance costs.

Improvements are due to its 61-inch titanium wide chord fan, 3D aerodynamics designed new core and low-pressure turbine with single crystal high-pressure turbine and Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). Fan blades are reduced from 36 (CFM56-5) to 24 and it incorporates features from the CFM56-5B such as a double-annular combustor as an option.

Less than two years after entry into service, the Next-Generation 737 received 180 minutes Extended range twin engine Operations (ETOPS) certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). It also powers the Boeing 737 military versions : Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control, C-40 Clipper transport and P-8 Poseidon Maritime Aircraft.

After the Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 accident, the FAA required Boeing to redesign the nacelle and inlet of the 7B variant in compliance with applicable Part 25 regulations. The proposed rule is to receive comments until January 26, 2024. The rule will require airlines to make the relevant modifications by July 31, 2028.

== Reliability ==
The CFM56 has an in-flight shutdown rate of 1 incident per 333,333 hours. Record time on wing before the first shop visit was 30,000 hours in 1996, to 40,729 hours in 2003 and 50,000 hours in 2016.

There have been several engine failures in the early service of the CFM56 family which were serious enough to either ground the fleet or require aspects of the engine to be redesigned. The engines have also suffered, periodically, from thrust instability events tentatively traced to Honeywell&#x27;s hydromechanical unit.

=== Rain and hail ingestion ===
There are several recorded incidents of CFM56 engines flaming out in heavy rain and/or hail conditions, beginning early in the CFM56&#x27;s career. In 1987, a double flameout occurred in hail conditions (the pilots managed to relight the engines), followed by the TACA Flight 110 incident in 1988. Both CFM56 engines on the TACA 737 flamed out while passing through hail and heavy rain, and the crew was forced to land without engines on a grassy levee near New Orleans, Louisiana. CFMI modified the engines by adding a sensor to force the combustor to continuously ignite under these conditions.

In 2002, Garuda Indonesia Flight 421 had to ditch in a river because of hail-induced engine flameouts, killing a flight attendant and injuring dozens of passengers. Prior to this accident, there were several other incidents of single or dual flameouts due to these weather conditions. After three incidents through 1998, CFMI made modifications to the engine to improve the way in which the engine handled hail ingestion. The major changes included a modification to the fan/booster splitter (making it more difficult for hail to be ingested by the core of the engine) and the use of an elliptical, rather than conical, spinner at the intake. These changes did not prevent the 2002 accident, and the investigation board found that the pilots did not follow the proper procedures for attempting to restart the engine, which contributed to the final result. Recommendations were made to better educate pilots on how to handle these conditions, as well as to revisit FAA rain and hail testing procedures. No further engine modifications were recommended.

=== Fan blade failure ===
One issue that led to accidents with the CFM56-3C engine was the failure of fan blades. This mode of failure led to the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the fan blade failed, the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when powered up for the final approach. Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered fan blade failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.

At the time it was not mandatory to flight test new variants of existing engines, and certification testing failed to reveal vibration modes that the fan experienced during the regularly performed power climbs at high altitude. Analysis revealed that the fan was being subjected to high-cycle fatigue stresses worse than expected and also more severe than tested for certification; these higher stresses caused the blade to fracture. Less than a month after grounding, the fleet was allowed to resume operations once the fan blades and fan disc were replaced and the electronic engine controls were modified to reduce maximum engine thrust to 22,000 lbf (98 kN) from 23,500 lbf (105 kN). The redesigned fan blades were installed on all CFM56-3C1 and CFM56-3B2 engines, including over 1,800 engines that had already been delivered to customers.

In August 2016 Southwest Airlines Flight 3472 suffered a fan blade failure, but landed later without further incident. While the aircraft sustained substantial damage, there were no injuries.

On 17 April 2018, Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 suffered from what appears to be a fan blade failure, debris from which punctured a window. The Boeing 737-700 landed safely, but one passenger was killed and several were injured.

=== Fuel flow problems ===
Airlines have reported 32 events involving sudden instability of thrust, at various points during flight, including high thrust settings during climb to altitude. The problem has been long-standing. In 1998, two 737 pilots reported that their engine throttles suddenly increased to full thrust during flight. A very recent investigation has led to the tentative conclusion that the problem originates in the Hydromechanical unit, and may involve an unacceptable level of fuel contamination (with water, or particulate matter, including biodegradable material that create solids in the fuel), or overuse of biocides to reduce bacterial growth. Boeing told &quot;Aviation Week and Space Technology&quot; that CFM International had revised its FADEC software. The new software &quot;...&#x27;reduces the duration and degree of thrust-instability events&#x27; by cycling the fuel monitoring valve (FMV) and the EHSV (electrohydraulic servo valve) to clean the EHSV spool.&quot; This software fix is not intended to be a definitive solution to the problem; CFM claimed that no further reports have reached it after this change was made.

=== Parts of unknown origin ===
In 2023, Bloomberg reported that European aviation regulators had determined that London-based AOG Technics, majority owned by Jose Zamora Yrala, whose nationality is listed as British on some forms and Venezuelan on others, supplied parts of unknown origin and false documents for repairs on some CFM56s.

<doc id="437329" wikidata="Q431216" url="?curid=437329" title="Bruce Arena">
<text>Bruce Arena (born September 21, 1951) is an American soccer coach who currently serves as the head coach and sporting director of the San Jose Earthquakes.

He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame and the NJCAA Lacrosse Hall of Fame. Arena has had a long and distinguished coaching career and is considered to be one of the most successful coaches in North American soccer history, having won five College Cup titles and five MLS Cup titles. He was the United States national team head coach at the 1996 Summer Olympics, the 2002 FIFA World Cup and the 2006 FIFA World Cup, head coach of the New York Red Bulls, D.C. United, LA Galaxy, and the New England Revolution in Major League Soccer, and coached Virginia Cavaliers men&#x27;s soccer to several college soccer championships. He is the U.S. soccer team&#x27;s longest-serving head coach with the highest number of wins, and the only coach to lead the team to two World Cups.

Before beginning his coaching career, Arena was a goalkeeper for Cornell University, and earned one cap with the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team.

==Playing career==

===High school and college===
Arena was born in Brooklyn, New York to Vincent and Adeline Arena, Italian immigrants (from Alicudi, Sicily). He grew up in the Long Island town of Franklin Square, New York, where he attended Carey High School. His father was a butcher while his mother was a school bus driver. Adeline was diagnosed with breast cancer when Bruce Arena was a child and had to undergo a mastectomy.

While he excelled at several sports, he was too small for American football, so he joined his high school&#x27;s soccer team as a defender. He moved into the goal when the starting goalkeeper was suspended after hitting another school&#x27;s player during a game. While in high school, he also played a single season with local club Hota S.C. of New York City&#x27;s Cosmopolitan Soccer League.

After graduation, he began his collegiate athletic career playing both lacrosse and soccer at Nassau Community College, a two-year college near his home. Arena was a 1970 and 1971 Honorable Mention All-American lacrosse player and an All-American soccer player. He was inducted into the National Junior College Hall of Fame in 2008. While at Nassau, he played soccer for head coach Bill Stevenson and goalkeeper coach Shep Messing, a future New York Cosmos goalkeeper. At the end of his two years with Nassau, Arena transferred to Cornell University in upstate New York where he was a 1972 Honorable Mention All American and a 1973 Second Team All American in lacrosse. He did not originally intend to play soccer, but injuries to the school&#x27;s first and second string goalkeepers led the men&#x27;s soccer coach, Dan Wood, to recruit Arena into the team as its goalkeeper. Arena backstopped the Cornell Big Red soccer team to the 1972 NCAA Soccer Championship Final Four and earned Most Valuable Defensive Player honors for the tournament.

===Professional===
After Arena&#x27;s graduation from Cornell, New York Cosmos drafted him in the fifth round of the North American Soccer League college draft. The Cosmos released him before the season. Arena then signed to play professional lacrosse for the Montreal Quebecois, spending a single season with the team in 1975. The National Lacrosse League folded at the end of the 1975 season, leaving Arena unemployed. At the same time, Dan Wood, who had recruited Arena to play for the Cornell soccer team, had been named the new head coach of the expansion Tacoma Tides which played in the American Soccer League. Wood contacted Arena and convinced him to move to the Pacific Northwest in 1976 to play for him. While Arena was the second string goalkeeper behind starter Jamil Canal, the move to Tacoma was significant in that it introduced Arena to coaching. That year, in addition to playing for the Tides, Arena coached the men&#x27;s soccer team at the University of Puget Sound, where he compiled a 5–7 record.

===International===
In 1973, he earned his only national team cap as a second-half substitute for Bob Rigby in a 2–0 loss to Israel. National team coach, Gordon Bradley, had called Arena into the national team for an earlier game against Haiti, but Arena could not get time off from his job teaching at a local junior high school. In addition to his single cap with the U.S. soccer team, Arena also played for the national lacrosse team which won the 1974 World Lacrosse Championship and finished runner up in 1978.

==Coaching career==

===College===
In 1977, Arena moved back to teach at Cornell and act as the school&#x27;s assistant lacrosse coach. While he was there, the University of Virginia (UVA) advertised for two open coaching positions – head soccer coach and assistant lacrosse coach beginning the 1978 season. Arena took that opportunity and went on to coach both the UVA lacrosse and soccer teams for seven years, before becoming the school&#x27;s dedicated soccer coach in 1985. Arena was the head coach of the Virginia program for eighteen years, during which he won five national championships (including 4 straight from 1991 to 1994) and amassed a 295–58–32 record, for a career NCAA mark of 300–65–32. Additionally, he coached and developed many players at Virginia who would go on to play significant roles in the United States national team, including Claudio Reyna, Jeff Agoos, Ben Olsen, John Harkes and Tony Meola. Arena also coached Richie Williams who later became his assistant coach with the US national team and the New England Revolution. In addition to coaching, Arena served as the ACC soccer coaches chairman as well as two three-year terms on the NCAA Division I soccer committee from 1989 to 1995.

===D.C. United===
On January 3, 1996, Arena left UVA to become the coach of D.C. United of Major League Soccer. The 1996 season would be both the team&#x27;s and the league&#x27;s inaugural season, so Arena needed to build a team from scratch just like the other 9 MLS club managers. To make his position even more difficult, he had agreed to coach the U.S. U-23 national team at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, where it went a disappointing 1–1–1. Despite the underperformance at the Olympics, Arena managed to form his team and lead United to an improbable comeback victory in the first MLS Cup at Foxboro Stadium. In addition to the MLS title, Arena also took United to the 1996 U.S. Open Cup championship. Arena and United continued to experience success in 1997. The heavily favored team won its second MLS Cup at RFK Stadium defeating the surprise Western Conference champion Colorado Rapids 2–1. Arena&#x27;s success led to his selection as the 1997 MLS Coach of the Year. This year, Arena took United to the semi-finals of the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup. In 1998, Arena took United to its third consecutive MLS Cup only to see his team fall to the expansion Chicago Fire led by his protégé Bob Bradley. However, while Arena failed to add another MLS championship to his resume, he guided United to the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup title with a 1–0 victory over Toluca on August 16, 1998. He followed that with a defeat of Brazilian club Vasco da Gama to take the Interamerican Cup title. Arena was also the 1997 and 1998 MLS All-Star head coach.

===National team===
Arena was hired by the U.S. national team to replace Steve Sampson as head coach in October 1998 following the team&#x27;s disastrous showing in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. His first game in charge was a friendly against Australia in San Jose, California, on November 6, 1998. He then forged the team into a successful international side, and is the most successful coach in United States history: most international wins; longest home shut-out; best World Cup showing since 1930, reaching the quarterfinals at the 2002 World Cup, before a defeat against Germany; and all-time best international FIFA Ranking (4th place, April 2006). Arena also won two Gold Cup championships in 2002 and 2005, with a third-place finish in 2003.

The 2002 World Cup was the high point of Arena&#x27;s career as the U.S. coach. Heavy underdogs coming into the tournament, they stunned the world by beating a respected Portuguese team 3–2 in their opening game. Arena was lauded afterward for instilling in his players the confidence to play aggressively against an international powerhouse. A hard-fought tie against host nation South Korea was enough to qualify for the second round, despite a poor loss against Poland in the final group game. Arena and the U.S. met old nemesis Mexico in the Round of 16, and Arena adapted his tactics to secure a 2–0 victory and a quarterfinal berth. The U.S. switched from their usual 4–4–2 to a 3–5–2, and it paid dividends almost immediately when Josh Wolff, who Arena had brought in to fill out the formation, set up Brian McBride for the winning goal early in the first half. Arena switched the team back to a 4–4–2 for their quarterfinal against Germany, and the team continued to surprise many by dominating stretches of the game. However, they lost 1–0 on a Michael Ballack header, and there was a controversy with a penalty not awarded to the U.S. for a handball in the German penalty box.

The U.S. national squad fell short of expectations at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, finishing last in Group E with losses to the Czech Republic and Ghana. The United States scored only twice in its three games, a tie against eventual champion Italy on an own goal by Italian Cristian Zaccardo and a goal from Clint Dempsey against Ghana. Some, including former team member and ESPN analyst Eric Wynalda, have blamed the poor performance on questionable coaching decisions by Arena, including not playing Clint Dempsey and putting DaMarcus Beasley on the right wing instead of his favored left against the Czechs, and using a defensive 4–5–1 in the must-win match vs. Ghana which the U.S. eventually lost. Another questionable decision was made when Claudio Reyna became injured after the first goal when Arena subbed in defensive midfielder Ben Olsen to replace Reyna.

During his time as national team head coach, the United States rose in the FIFA world rankings from nineteenth to fourth, to the surprise, even, of U.S. players. Arena&#x27;s 75 wins from 1998 to 2006 are by far the most in U.S. history. Nevertheless, three weeks after the Americans&#x27; disappointing first-round exit from the World Cup in Germany, the U.S. Soccer Federation announced that Arena&#x27;s contract would not be renewed when it expired at the end of 2006. U.S. Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati explained Arena&#x27;s dismissal, stating that the U.S. was seeking a &quot;fresh approach.&quot;

Arena was eventually replaced as national team coach by his close friend and former assistant at Virginia and D.C. United, Bob Bradley. During his time coaching the national team, Arena had 81 wins, the highest number of any coach in the team&#x27;s history.

===New York Red Bulls===
After the US. national team, Arena pursued other coaching opportunities. That led to his being hired by Major League Soccer team New York Red Bulls. Arena&#x27;s first match with the club came on August 12, 2006, in a friendly against FC Barcelona. On November 5, 2007, Red Bulls and Arena decided mutually to part company. During his year-and-a-half with the club, he went 16–16–10. He had two years remaining on his contract with the club.

===Los Angeles Galaxy===
On August 18, 2008, Los Angeles Galaxy hired Arena to replace Ruud Gullit as head coach and Alexi Lalas as general manager. He inherited a team that had failed to make the playoffs since 2005 and would finish the 2008 season at 8–13–9, finishing next-to-last in the league and letting in a league-high 62 goals. During the offseason, Arena reshaped the defense, drafting Omar Gonzalez and A. J. DeLaGarza who became fixtures on the backline and bringing in Donovan Ricketts as the goalkeeper. Although the team scored only 36 goals in 2009, they also let in only 31. This led to a 12–6–12 record and second-place finish in the league standings. The Galaxy went to the playoffs and Arena was selected as the MLS Coach of the Year Award.

The 2011 Major League Soccer season went extremely well for Bruce&#x27;s Galaxy. His club won the Supporters&#x27; Shield for the second straight season, became only the third team in league history to reach the 60-point plateau, and won the 2011 MLS Cup in a 1–0 victory over the Houston Dynamo. Los Angeles also advanced to the elimination round of the CONCACAF Champions League. The Galaxy was, however, eliminated from the U.S. Open Cup in the quarterfinal stage. The club was undefeated in competitive matches at the Home Depot Center in 2011.

The 2012 Galaxy repeated winning the championship, again over Houston, despite a slow start to the year. He won a third championship with the Galaxy in 2014 over the New England Revolution.

===Return to the national team===
On November 22, 2016, Arena was appointed as coach of the United States national team for the second time, replacing Jürgen Klinsmann after two disastrous losses in the first two matches of Hex qualifying round for the 2018 World Cup. On March 25, 2017, Arena led the USMNT to a trouncing 6–0 win over Honduras, followed by a 1–1 draw with Panama. On June 9, Arena led the USMNT to an important 2–0 win in a qualifying match against Trinidad and Tobago, followed by the USMNT&#x27;s 3rd ever WCQ draw at Estadio Azteca against Mexico. The team had a 14-match unbeaten streak leading up to the Gold Cup, the best streak in the team&#x27;s history. During a pause in World Cup Qualification, Arena&#x27;s squad won the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup with a 2–1 win over Jamaica in the Finals. Arena&#x27;s team returned to World Cup Qualification and lost 2–0 to Costa Rica on September 1. The US team bounced back with an impressive 4–0 rout of Panama on October 6 to get back into the qualifying third-place spot during the fifth round.

On October 10, the final day of qualification, the USMNT needed a draw against Trinidad and Tobago to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. The U.S. were heavy favorites coming in as Trinidad and Tobago had lost six straight games, but the team fell into a 0–2 hole with an Omar Gonzalez own-goal and an Alvin Jones goal. While Christian Pulisic pulled one back, the U.S. could not score again and lost to Trinidad and Tobago 1–2. With this loss, along with both Panama and Honduras beating their opponents, the U.S. fell to fifth place in the CONCACAF region&#x27;s final qualifying round and failed to qualify for the FIFA World Cup for the first time since 1986. Three days after the team&#x27;s failure to qualify, Arena resigned from his position as men&#x27;s national team head coach. He said, &quot;We have no excuses, we failed today. We should have walked off this field with at least a point.&quot;

===New England Revolution===

Following his resignation from the national team, Arena was floated as a potential candidate for several coaching and managing positions, including for the Columbus Crew and the Scotland national team.

He was named the head coach and sporting director of the New England Revolution on May 14, 2019, replacing Brad Friedel. His first game in charge came on June 2, in a 2–1 win over his former team, LA Galaxy.

Under Arena, the Revolution, who were at that point in last place in the Eastern Conference, went eleven games undefeated until losing 2–0 to Los Angeles FC on August 3, 2019. Following that defeat, the Revolution closed out the season only losing two more matches on a 2-2-6 run, and qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 2015. The Revolution were eliminated in the first round of the 2019 MLS Cup Playoffs by defending 2018 MLS Cup champion Atlanta United 1-0.

The following season, Arena&#x27;s Revolution advanced to the Eastern Conference Final of the 2020 MLS Cup Playoffs. It was the first time the Revolution had made it to the Eastern Conference Final since 2014. They would ultimately lose the game to the eventual MLS Cup 2020 champion Columbus Crew 1-0.

In the 2021 season, Arena led the Revolution to their first-ever Supporters&#x27; Shield by having the best regular season record in the league. Additionally that season, the team set a record for most points in a regular season, with 73. Arena was named MLS Coach of the Year for a league-record fourth time at the end of the season. Despite the strong regular season, the Revolution were eliminated in penalties in the 2021 MLS Cup Playoffs Conference semifinals by eventual champion New York City FC.

After a transfer and injury-hampered 2022 campaign, Arena&#x27;s Revolution returned to form in 2023, compiling a record of 12 wins, 7 draws, and 4 losses, sitting in second place in the Eastern Conference, when regular season play paused for the 2023 Leagues Cup.

On August 1, 2023, Arena was placed on administrative leave by the Revolution amid allegations of &quot;insensitive and inappropriate remarks.&quot;

On September 9, 2023, Arena resigned as head coach and sporting director of the Revolution.

===San Jose Earthquakes===

On November 7, 2024, Arena was announced as the new head coach and sporting director of the San Jose Earthquakes. Arena&#x27;s first win as Earthquakes manager came in the club&#x27;s 2025 season opener on February 22, a 4-0 result over Real Salt Lake.

==Personal life==
Arena has resided in the Los Angeles area with his wife Phyllis since taking over as LA Galaxy head coach, having previously been based out of Charlottesville, Virginia, during most of his coaching career.

He has a brother, Michael, and a son, Kenny Arena, who played with the U.S. youth national team and in Major League Soccer before becoming a coach. He is a grandparent through Kenny Arena.

==Coaching record==

*1.Record includes league, cup, playoffs and CONCACAF competitions. During his tenure as D.C. United head coach, all shootout wins were put into their own separate column and all shootout losses were put under the loss column. During his tenure as United States head coach, matches that end in a shootout are considered ties.

<text>Trailer Park Boys is a Canadian mockumentary television sitcom created by Mike Clattenburg that began airing in 2001 as a continuation of his 1999 film bearing the same name. The show follows the misadventures of a group of trailer park residents, including two lead characters in and out of prison, living in the fictional &quot;Sunnyvale Trailer Park&quot; in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. The series premiered on Showcase on April 20, 2001, and originally ran for seven seasons before concluding with a one-hour special on December 7, 2008. The series spawned four films: &quot;The Movie&quot;, released on October 6, 2006; &quot;Countdown to Liquor Day&quot;, released on September 25, 2009; &quot;Don&#x27;t Legalize It&quot;, released on April 18, 2014; and &quot;Standing on the Shoulders of Kitties: The Bubbles and the Shitrockers Story&quot; was released in December 2024.

In 2013, Robb Wells, John Paul Tremblay, and Mike Smith, the actors who respectively portrayed Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles, purchased the rights to the show from the original producers and created their own internet streaming network, SwearNet. Starting in March 2014, SwearNet co-produced new episodes of the show with the American streaming service Netflix, and the eighth season premiered on September 5, 2014. Several specials and mini-series were made in the years that followed. An animated spinoff series premiered on March 31, 2019. In October 2019, filming began on a spinoff series, &quot;Trailer Park Boys: Jail&quot;, which premiered on SwearNet on January 1, 2021. 

A thirteenth season is currently in development, with filming scheduled to begin in 2025.

==History==
In 1998, director Mike Clattenburg wrote and directed a short film titled &quot;One Last Shot,&quot; which was shot in black-and-white. The film followed the exploits of two friends, Rob (Robb Wells) and Gary William or GW (John Paul Tremblay), although it is not based in the same setting as &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;. It was the first time Robb, John Paul and John Dunsworth worked together. In the 1999 feature film &quot;Trailer Park Boys,&quot; the character Julian states to the camera that he wanted his life to be documented after receiving a telephone psychic&#x27;s prediction that he would die soon. He hoped that the film would deter others from the life of crime he had chosen.

The feature film was shown at the Atlantic Film Festival in 1999, and it caught the attention of producer Barrie Dunn, who saw the potential for a television series. Clattenburg and Dunn, along with Wells and Tremblay, worked on a proposal for a 13-episode season of the show and traveled to Toronto to pitch the show to The Comedy Network. After being turned down, they suddenly decided to pitch the show to Showcase before returning home to Nova Scotia.

They found that the network was receptive and sent them back with a commitment to a first season, with the provision that a second experienced producer (which ended up being Michael Volpe) be brought on board to assist the team. The first six 30-minute episodes were then written and filmed. Some modifications were made to the characters and storyline for the series, and more humor was added to the series in comparison to the film. The show debuted on Showcase on April 22, 2001, airing at 9:30pm. For season 2, the show began airing at 9:00pm.

The biggest change from film to series was the addition of Mike Smith&#x27;s &quot;Bubbles&quot; character, who was originally developed for the earlier short film &quot;The Cart Boy&quot;, a film that Smith, Wells, Tremblay, and Clattenburg worked on together in 1995. Smith&#x27;s character soon grew from a recurring character to one of the show&#x27;s primary protagonists (although in the earlier film, &quot;Bubbles&quot; was the name of Smith&#x27;s character&#x27;s cat). &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; resided with Showcase for its first seven seasons. Beginning with the eighth season, the series was released through Netflix.

Early seasons were shot in various trailer parks in Nova Scotia, but the crew was not welcome to film again due to complaints from residents. These included Woodbine Home Park, an unnamed collection of trailers in central Dartmouth next to the Tufts Cove Generating Station, Timberlea Mini Home Park and Greenridge Mobile Home Park. Seasons 5 to 7 were filmed at a custom built set near Bissett Lake in Cole Harbour. For this location, trailers were placed around an existing 2 floor building which also served as the set of the jail. When the series returned from hiatus beginning with Season 8, it was shot at Bible Hill Estates Trailer Park in Truro, Nova Scotia, with every subsequent episode being filmed at that location. After the 12th season, they ceased filming at the location and removed all sets and props from Bible Hill Estates, which still exists as an operating land lease community.

On September 1, 2014, Netflix announced that season 8 of &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; would be available on September 5. Season 9 of &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; was made available on March 27, 2015. On June 1, 2015, SwearNet officially announced that the production of Season 10 was underway. On March 28, 2016, Netflix released season 10 of the &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;. It consists of 10 episodes and includes appearances from several well-known stars such as Snoop Dogg, Jimmy Kimmel, Doug Benson and Tom Arnold. Two episodes were directed by Bobby Farrelly. On April 2, 2016, and on April 20, 2016, Lucy DeCoutere and Jonathan Torrens announced they were leaving the show. On May 30, 2016, filming and production began for Season 11 of &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;. On July 5, 2016, filming for Season 11 was completed and editing began. On February 22, it was announced that Season 11 would air March 31, 2017. On March 31, 2017, Season 11 aired. On June 19, 2017, it was announced that filming of the twelfth season was officially underway. On October 16, 2017, John Dunsworth died at the age of 71, with Season 12 marking his final appearance on the show. Season 12, the final season produced as part of the Netflix deal was made available on March 30, 2018.

On March 31, 2019, &quot;Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series&quot; premiered on Netflix. Smith later revealed in October that filming for another season titled &quot;Trailer Park Boys: Jail&quot; had begun. A second Christmas special, featuring never-before-seen footage of John Dunsworth prior to his death, premiered on Christmas Day, 2020. On January 1, 2021, &quot;Trailer Park Boys: Jail&quot; premiered on SwearNet.

In January 2025, Smith confirmed in character during a live stream on TikTok that Season 13 is confirmed, with filming slated to begin later in the year.

==Premise==
===Setting and characters===

Episodes revolve around Sunnyvale Trailer Park residents, Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles trying to make money through petty crimes while avoiding the police. Their schemes are complicated by the interference of the park&#x27;s vindictive alcoholic supervisor Jim Lahey and his assistant and romantic partner, Randy. Ricky, Bubbles, and Julian&#x27;s ineptitude is rivaled by Lahey&#x27;s drunken incompetence. Throughout the series, Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles end up in and out of jail, with most of their schemes collapsing into failure. Later seasons adopted a cyclical formula: each season finale featured the boys&#x27; schemes succeeding, and their future looking optimistic, while the next season&#x27;s premiere would show them explaining how everything had gone wrong in the interim. Fans learned to expect that seasons would somehow end with some or all of the main characters going to jail.

Each character has his or her own trademark mannerism or trait. Julian often takes a leadership role and devises schemes, all while holding a Cuba Libre on the rocks in his hand. Ricky believes himself to be dumb, and his speech is often laced with malapropisms that fans call &quot;Rickyisms&quot;; he lives in a dilapidated 1975 Chrysler New Yorker (nicknamed &quot;the Shitmobile&quot;), and grows cannabis. Bubbles wears spectacles that magnify his eyes to a hyperbolic extent, drives a go-kart, and lives in a shed with many cats; he is the least willing to face any repercussions for the trio&#x27;s illegal activities. Alcoholic trailer park supervisor and disgraced ex-cop Jim Lahey usually attempts to derail the Boys&#x27; schemes, and nearly always shoehorns the word &quot;shit&quot; into his cautionary metaphors that fans call &quot;Shitisms&quot;. Randy is Lahey&#x27;s assistant and lover; he never wears a shirt unless he absolutely has to and is often taunted for his large gut and addiction to cheeseburgers.

There are also a number of minor characters. Ricky&#x27;s legal, but not biological father Ray, who uses a wheelchair, is a former trucker and self-declared Calvinist who is secretly committing disability fraud, in addition to being an alcoholic and gambling addict. Barbara is the trailer park owner and Lahey&#x27;s ex-wife. Cory and Trevor are hapless best friends who assist and idolize Ricky and Julian, often unaware that they will serve as scapegoats when Ricky and Julian&#x27;s plans inevitably go awry; Jacob later replaces Trevor after his disappearance from Sunnyvale. Lucy is the mother of Ricky&#x27;s daughter Trinity, while Sarah, a friend, moved in with Lucy after Ricky&#x27;s first imprisonment. J-Roc (real name Jamie) is a white aspiring rapper who is rarely seen without his friend, Tyrone, and antagonizes Randy whenever he shows up.

==Production==
===Format===
The series is shot in a mockumentary style (including the use of long takes), featuring handheld camera work. Characters often speak directly to crew members, who occasionally become involved in the plot. In one episode, a crewman is shot; in another, one is tased by Jim Lahey. The show is loosely scripted, with much of the dialogue ad-libbed from basic plot points. These aspects are intended to evoke a sense of actualism war/realism, found footage, screenlife and very fast/shaky camera. The trio have stated that many of the show&#x27;s most popular moments were not in the script. To support the &quot;lore&quot; that the show is nonfiction and real viral cinematic, many of the actors often make public appearances in character.

===&quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;===
The initial &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; movie was shown in 1999. It was directed, produced, and written by Mike Clattenburg. The film was shot in black-and-white, and it followed the criminal exploits of Robb Wells as Ricky LaFleur and John Paul Tremblay as Julian.

A few other cast members who later appeared in the TV show also portrayed different characters in the film, such as Patrick Roach as the alcoholic dog owner Patrick (instead of the TV show&#x27;s character Randy) and Mike Smith as the location sound recordist (instead of the TV show&#x27;s character Bubbles).

Entertainment One announced that the third and final film, titled &quot;Trailer Park Boys 3: Don&#x27;t Legalize It&quot;, would be released in Canada on April 18, 2014.

The live show contains an introduction and epilogue shot in the format of a &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; episode, with the premise that the boys are arrested in Dublin and forced to serve community service by staging a puppet show discouraging drug and alcohol use. Some elements from the television series return in &quot;Live in Fuckin&#x27; Dublin&quot;, such as Alex Lifeson&#x27;s (from the band Rush) feud with Ricky, Ricky&#x27;s inadvertently gluing objects to his nose, and Conky&#x27;s many resurrections. The film was released on June 1, 2014. The season 8 episode &quot;Community Service and a Boner Made with Love&quot; contains a similar premise.

<doc id="437338" wikidata="Q284003" url="?curid=437338" title="Al-Walid I">
<text>Al-Walid ibn Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (; – 23 February 715), commonly known as al-Walid I (), was the sixth Umayyad caliph, ruling from October 705 until his death in 715. He was the eldest son of his predecessor, Caliph Abd al-Malik (). As a prince, he led annual raids against the Byzantines from 695 to 698 and built or restored fortifications along the Syrian Desert route to Mecca. He became heir apparent in , after the death of the designated successor, Abd al-Malik&#x27;s brother Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan.

Under al-Walid, his father&#x27;s efforts to centralize government, impose a more Arabic and Islamic character on the state, and expand its borders were continued. He heavily depended on al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, his father&#x27;s powerful viceroy over the eastern half of the caliphate. During his reign, armies commissioned by al-Hajjaj conquered Sind and Transoxiana in the east, while the troops of Musa ibn Nusayr, the governor of Ifriqiya, conquered the Maghreb and Hispania in the west, bringing the caliphate to its largest territorial extent. War spoils from the conquests enabled al-Walid to finance impressive public works, including his greatest architectural achievement, the Great Mosque of Damascus, as well as the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque in Medina. He was the first caliph to institute programs for social welfare, aiding the poor and handicapped among the Muslim Arabs of Syria, who held him in high esteem.

His reign was marked by domestic peace and prosperity and likely represented the peak of Umayyad power, though it is difficult to ascertain his direct role in its affairs. The balance al-Walid maintained among the elites, including the Qays and Yaman army factions, may have been his key personal achievement. On the other hand, the massive military expenditures of his rule, as well as his extravagant grants to the Umayyad princes, became a financial burden on his successors.

==Early life==
Al-Walid was born in Medina in , during the rule of Mu&#x27;awiya I (), the founder and first caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate. His father, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, was a member of the Umayyad dynasty. While Mu&#x27;awiya belonged to the Umayyads&#x27; Sufyanid branch, resident in Syria, al-Walid&#x27;s family was part of the larger Abu al-As line in the Hejaz (western Arabia, where Mecca and Medina are located). His mother, Wallada bint al-Abbas ibn al-Jaz, was a descendant of Zuhayr ibn Jadhima, a famous 6th-century chief of the Banu Abs tribe. In 684, after Umayyad rule collapsed amid the Second Muslim Civil War, the Umayyads of the Hejaz were expelled by a rival claimant to the caliphate, Ibn al-Zubayr, and relocated to Syria. There al-Walid&#x27;s grandfather, the elder statesman Marwan I (), was recognized as caliph by pro-Umayyad Arab tribes. With the tribes&#x27; support, he restored the dynasty&#x27;s rule in Syria and Egypt by the end of his reign. Abd al-Malik succeeded Marwan and conquered the rest of the caliphate, namely Iraq, Iran, and Arabia. With the key assistance of his viceroy of Iraq, al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, Abd al-Malik instituted several centralization measures, which consolidated Umayyad territorial gains.

The war with the Byzantine Empire, which dated to the Muslim conquest of Syria in the 630s, resumed in 692 after the collapse of the truce that had been reached three years earlier. Annual campaigns were thereafter launched by the Umayyads in the Arab–Byzantine frontier zone and beyond. During his father&#x27;s caliphate, al-Walid led the campaigns in 696, 697, 698 and 699. In his summer 696 campaign, he raided the area between Malatya (Melitene) and al-Massisa (Mopsuestia), while in the following year, he targeted a place known in Arabic sources as &#x27;Atmar&#x27;, located at some point north of Malatya. He also led the annual Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca in 698.

In 700 or 701, al-Walid patronized the construction or expansion of Qasr Burqu&#x27;, a fortified Syrian Desert outpost on the route connecting Palmyra in the north with the Azraq oasis and Wadi Sirhan basin in the south, ultimately leading to Mecca and Medina. His patronage is attested by an inscription naming him as &quot;the emir al-Walid, son of the commander of the faithful&quot;. According to the historian Jere L. Bacharach, al-Walid built the nearby site of Jabal Says, likely as a Bedouin summer encampment between his base of operations in al-Qaryatayn and Qasr Burqu&#x27;. Bacharach speculates that al-Walid used the sites, located in the territory of Arab tribes, to reaffirm their loyalty, which had been critical to the Umayyads during the civil war.

==Caliphate==
Toward the end of his reign, Abd al-Malik, supported by al-Hajjaj, attempted to nominate al-Walid as his successor, abrogating the arrangement set by Marwan whereby Abd al-Malik&#x27;s brother, the governor of Egypt, Abd al-Aziz, was slated to succeed. Though the latter refused to step down from the line of succession, he died in 704 or early 705, removing the principal obstacle to al-Walid&#x27;s nomination. After the death of Abd al-Malik on 9 October 705, al-Walid acceded. Al-Walid was physically described by the 9th-century historian al-Ya&#x27;qubi as &quot;tall and swarthy ... snub-nosed ... with a touch of gray &quot;[sic]&quot; at the tip of his beard&quot;. He noted that al-Walid &quot;spoke ungrammatically&quot;. To his father&#x27;s chagrin, al-Walid abandoned speaking the classical Arabic in which the Qur&#x27;an was written but insisted that everyone in his company have knowledge of the Qur&#x27;an.

Al-Walid essentially continued his father&#x27;s policies of centralization and expansion. Unlike Abd al-Malik, al-Walid heavily depended on al-Hajjaj and allowed him free rein over the eastern half of the caliphate. Moreover, al-Hajjaj strongly influenced al-Walid&#x27;s internal decision-making, with officials often being installed and dismissed upon the viceroy&#x27;s recommendation.

===Territorial expansion===
The renewal of the Muslim conquests on the eastern and western frontiers had begun under Abd al-Malik, after he neutralized the Umayyads&#x27; domestic opponents. Under al-Walid, the armies of the caliphate &quot;received a fresh impulse&quot; and a &quot;period of great conquests&quot; began, in the words of the historian Julius Wellhausen. During the second half of al-Walid&#x27;s reign, the Umayyads reached their furthest territorial extent.

====Eastern frontiers====
Expansion from the eastern frontiers was overseen by al-Hajjaj from Iraq. His lieutenant governor of Khurasan, Qutayba ibn Muslim, launched several campaigns in Transoxiana (Central Asia), which had been a largely impenetrable region for earlier Muslim armies, between 705 and 715. Qutayba gained the surrender of Bukhara in 706–709, Khwarazm and Samarkand in 711–712, and Farghana in 713. He mainly secured Umayyad suzerainty through tributary alliances with local rulers, whose power remained intact. With Qutayba&#x27;s death in 716, his army disbanded and the weak Arab position in Transoxiana allowed for the local princes and the Turgesh nomads to roll back most of Qutayba&#x27;s gains by the early 720s. From 708 or 709, al-Hajjaj&#x27;s nephew, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim, conquered Sind, the northwestern part of South Asia.

====Western frontiers====
In the west, al-Walid&#x27;s governor in Ifriqiya (central North Africa), Musa ibn Nusayr, another holdover from Abd al-Malik&#x27;s reign, subjugated the Berbers of the Hawwara, Zenata and Kutama confederations and advanced on the Maghreb (western North Africa). In 708 or 709, he conquered Tangier and Sus, in the far north and south of modern-day Morocco. Musa&#x27;s Berber (freedman or client; pl. ), Tariq ibn Ziyad, invaded the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula) in 711, and was reinforced by Musa in the following year. By 716, a year after al-Walid&#x27;s death, Hispania had been largely conquered. The massive war spoils netted by the conquests of Transoxiana, Sind and Hispania were comparable to the amounts accrued in the Muslim conquests during the reign of Caliph Umar ().

====Byzantine front====
Al-Walid appointed his half-brother Maslama as governor of the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) and charged him with leading the war effort against Byzantium. Although Maslama established a strong power base in the frontier zone, the Umayyads made few territorial gains during al-Walid&#x27;s reign. After a lengthy siege, the Byzantine fortress of Tyana was captured and sacked in . Al-Walid did not lead any of the annual or bi-annual campaigns, but his eldest son al-Abbas fought reputably alongside Maslama. His other sons Abd al-Aziz, Umar, Bishr and Marwan also led raids.

By 712, the Arabs solidified their control of Cilicia and the areas east of the Euphrates River and launched raids deep into Anatolia. After one such raid against Ancyra in 714, the Byzantine emperor Anastasios II () sent a delegation to negotiate a truce with al-Walid or decipher his intentions. The delegates reported back that al-Walid was planning a land and naval assault to conquer the Byzantine capital Constantinople. Al-Walid died in 715 and the siege was carried out under his successors, ending in 718 as a disaster for the Arabs.

Al-Walid entrusted most of Syria&#x27;s military districts to his sons; al-Abbas was assigned to Homs, Abd al-Aziz to Damascus, and Umar to Jordan. In Palestine, al-Walid&#x27;s brother Sulayman had been appointed by their father as governor and remained in office under al-Walid. Sulayman sheltered the deposed governor of Khurasan, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, a fugitive from al-Hajjaj&#x27;s prison, in 708. Despite his initial disapproval, al-Walid pardoned Yazid as a result of Sulayman&#x27;s lobbying and payment of the heavy fine that al-Hajjaj had imposed on Yazid.

====Egypt====
Between 693 and 700, Abd al-Malik and al-Hajjaj initiated the dual processes of establishing a single Islamic currency in place of the previously used Byzantine and Sasanian coinage and replacing Greek and Persian with Arabic as the language of the bureaucracy in Syria and Iraq, respectively. These administrative reforms continued under al-Walid, during whose reign, in 705 or 706, Arabic replaced Greek and Coptic in the (government departments) of Egypt. The change was implemented by al-Walid&#x27;s half-brother, Abd Allah, the governor of Egypt and appointee of Abd al-Malik. These policies effected the gradual transition of Arabic as the sole official language of the state, unified the varied tax systems of the caliphate&#x27;s provinces and contributed to the establishment of a more ideologically Islamic government. In 709, al-Walid replaced Abd Allah with his (scribe), Qurra ibn Sharik al-Absi, who belonged to the same tribe as the caliph&#x27;s mother. This was prompted either because of mounting complaints against Abd Allah&#x27;s corruption, which was blamed for Egypt&#x27;s first recorded famine under Islamic rule, or a desire to install a loyalist as governor. Qurra ibn Sharik served until his death in 715 and established a more efficient means of tax collection, reorganized Egypt&#x27;s army and, on al-Walid&#x27;s orders, restored the mosque of Fustat.

====Hejaz====
Al-Walid initially kept Abd al-Malik&#x27;s appointee, Hisham ibn Isma&#x27;il al-Makhzumi, as governor of the Hejaz and leader of the Hajj pilgrimage. Both offices were of great prestige owing to the central religious importance of Mecca and Medina, the two holiest cities of Islam. Al-Walid dismissed him in 706 as punishment for flogging and humiliating the prominent Medinan scholar Sa&#x27;id ibn al-Musayyib for refusing to give the oath of allegiance to al-Walid as heir apparent during Abd al-Malik&#x27;s reign. Although Hisham&#x27;s act was in support of al-Walid, he considered it an abusive excess. According to the historian M. E. McMillan, other than al-Walid&#x27;s &quot;sense of righteous indignation&quot;, dynastic politics motivated his dismissal order. Hisham was the maternal grandfather of al-Walid&#x27;s half-brother Hisham, who was a contender for the caliphal succession, which al-Walid coveted for his son Abd al-Aziz. Rather than leaving such a close relative of his brother Hisham at the helm of the Islamic holy cities, al-Walid installed his cousin Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, who was the husband of al-Walid&#x27;s sister Fatima and brother to al-Walid&#x27;s wife Umm al-Banin, the mother of Abd al-Aziz. On al-Walid&#x27;s orders, Umar had Hisham publicly humiliated, an unprecedented motion against a sacked governor of Medina, which set &quot;a dangerous precedent&quot;, according to McMillan.

Umar maintained friendly ties to the holy cities&#x27; religious circles. He led the Hajj for at least four of the six years he was in office, with al-Walid&#x27;s son Umar leading it in 707 and al-Walid leading it in 710, the only time he left Syria during his caliphate. Umar provided safe haven to Iraqis evading the persecution of al-Hajjaj. Umar informed al-Walid of al-Hajjaj&#x27;s abuses, while al-Hajjaj advised the caliph to dismiss Umar for hosting Iraqi rebels. Al-Walid, wary of the Hejaz once again developing into a center of anti-Umayyad activity as it had during the Second Muslim Civil War, dismissed Umar in 712. He split the governorship of the Hejaz, appointing al-Hajjaj&#x27;s nominees Khalid ibn Abdallah al-Qasri to Mecca and Uthman ibn Hayyan al-Murri to Medina. Neither was ever appointed to lead the Hajj, al-Walid reserving that office for Maslama and his own sons.

===Balancing of tribal factions===
As a result of the Battle of Marj Rahit, which inaugurated Marwan&#x27;s reign in 684, a sharp division developed among the Syrian Arab tribes, who formed the core of the Umayyad army. The loyalist tribes that supported Marwan formed the Yaman confederation, alluding to ancestral roots in Yemen (South Arabia), while the Qays, or northern Arab tribes, largely supported Ibn al-Zubayr. Abd al-Malik reconciled with the Qays in 691, but competition for influence between the two factions intensified as the Syrian army was increasingly empowered and deployed to the provinces, where they replaced or supplemented Iraqi and other garrisons.

Al-Walid maintained his father&#x27;s policy of balancing the power of the two factions in the military and administration. According to the historian Hugh N. Kennedy, it is &quot;possible that the caliph kept it [the rivalry] on the boil so that one faction [would] not acquire a monopoly of power&quot;. Al-Walid&#x27;s mother genealogically belonged to the Qays and he accorded Qaysi officials certain advantages. However, Wellhausen doubts that al-Walid preferred one faction over the other, &quot;for he had no need to do so, and it is not reported&quot; by the medieval historians. The Qays–Yaman division intensified under al-Walid&#x27;s successors, who did not maintain his balancing act. The feud was a major contributor to the Umayyad regime&#x27;s demise in 750.

===Public works and social welfare===
From the beginning of his rule, al-Walid inaugurated public works and social welfare programs on a scale unprecedented in the caliphate&#x27;s history. The efforts were financed by treasure accrued from the conquests and tax revenue. He and his brothers and sons built way-stations and dug wells along the roads in Syria and installed street lighting in the cities. They invested in land reclamation projects, entailing irrigation networks and canals, which boosted agricultural production. Al-Hajjaj also carried out irrigation and canal projects in Iraq during this period, in a bid to restore its agricultural infrastructure, damaged by years of warfare, and to find employment for its demobilized inhabitants.

Al-Walid or his son al-Abbas founded the city of Anjar, between Damascus and Beirut, in 714. It included a mosque, palace, and residential, commercial, and administrative structures. According to the art historian Robert Hillenbrand, Anjar &quot;has the best claim of any Islamic foundation datable before 750 ... to be a city&quot;, though it was probably abandoned within forty years of its construction. In the Hejaz, al-Walid attempted to redress the hardships of pilgrims making the trek to Mecca by having water wells dug throughout the province, improving access through the mountain passes, and building a drinking fountain in Mecca. The historian M. A. Shaban theorizes that while al-Walid&#x27;s projects in the cities of Syria and the Hejaz had a &quot;utilitarian purpose&quot;, they were mainly intended to provide employment, in the form of cheap labor, for the growing non-Arab populations in the cities.

Welfare programs included financial relief for the poor and servants to assist the handicapped, though this initiative was limited to Syria, and only to the Arab Muslims there. As such, Shaban considered it &quot;a special state subsidy to the ruling class&quot;.

====Patronage of great mosques====
Al-Walid turned the example of his father&#x27;s construction of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem into a wide-scale building program. His patronage of great mosques in Damascus, Jerusalem and Medina underlined his political legitimacy and religious credentials. The mosque he founded in Damascus, later known as the Umayyad Mosque, was the greatest architectural achievement of his rule. Under his predecessors, Muslim residents had worshipped in a small (prayer room) attached to the 4th-century Christian cathedral of John the Baptist. By al-Walid&#x27;s reign, the could not cope with the fast-growing Muslim community and no sufficient free spaces were available in Damascus for a large congregational mosque. In 705, al-Walid had the cathedral converted into a mosque, compensating local Christians with other properties in the city.

Most of the structure was demolished. Al-Walid&#x27;s architects replaced the demolished space with a large prayer hall and a courtyard bordered on all sides by a closed portico with double arcades. The mosque was completed in 711. The army of Damascus, numbering some 45,000 soldiers, were taxed a quarter of their salaries for nine years to pay for its construction. The scale and grandeur of the great mosque made it a &quot;symbol of the political supremacy and moral prestige of Islam&quot;, according to the historian Nikita Elisséeff. Noting al-Walid&#x27;s awareness of architecture&#x27;s propaganda value, Hillenbrand calls the mosque a &quot;victory monument&quot; intended as a &quot;visible statement of Muslim supremacy and permanence&quot;. The mosque has maintained its original form until the present day.

In Jerusalem, al-Walid continued his father&#x27;s works on the Temple Mount. There is disagreement as to whether the al-Aqsa Mosque, which was built on the same axis of the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount, was originally built by Abd al-Malik or al-Walid. Several architectural historians hold that Abd al-Malik commissioned the project and that al-Walid finished or expanded it. The earliest source indicating al-Walid&#x27;s work on the mosque is the Aphrodito Papyri, which contain letters from December 708 – June 711 between his governor of Egypt, Qurra ibn Sharik, and an official in Upper Egypt discussing the dispatch of Egyptian laborers and craftsmen to help build the &quot;Mosque of Jerusalem&quot;. It is likely that the unfinished administrative and residential structures that were built opposite the southern and eastern walls of the Temple Mount, next to the mosque, date to the era of al-Walid, who died before they could be completed.

In 706 or 707, al-Walid instructed Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz to significantly enlarge the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque in Medina. Its redevelopment entailed the demolition of the living quarters of Muhammad&#x27;s wives and the incorporation of the graves of Muhammad and the first two caliphs, Abu Bakr () and Umar. The vocal opposition to the demolition of Muhammad&#x27;s home from local religious circles was dismissed by al-Walid. He lavished large sums for the reconstruction and supplied mosaics and Greek and Coptic craftsmen. According to Hillenbrand, the building of a large-scale mosque in Medina, the original center of the caliphate, was an &quot;acknowledgement&quot; by al-Walid of &quot;his own roots and those of Islam itself&quot; and possibly an attempt to appease Medinan resentment at the loss of the city&#x27;s political importance to Syria under the Umayyads. In the words of McMillan, the mosque and the works benefitting the pilgrims to the holy cities &quot;were a form of reconciliation ... a constructive counterweight to the political damage&quot; caused by the Umayyad sieges of Mecca in 683 and 692 and assault on Medina during the civil war. Other mosques that al-Walid is credited for expanding in the Hejaz include the Sanctuary Mosque around the Kaaba in Mecca and the mosque of Ta&#x27;if.

==Death and succession==
Al-Walid died of an illness in Dayr Murran, an Umayyad winter estate on the outskirts of Damascus, on 23 February 715, about one year after al-Hajjaj&#x27;s death. He was buried in Damascus at the cemetery of Bab al-Saghir or Bab al-Faradis and Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz led the funeral prayers.

Al-Walid unsuccessfully attempted to nominate his son Abd al-Aziz as his successor and void the arrangements set by his father, in which Sulayman was to succeed al-Walid. Relations between the two brothers had become strained. Sulayman acceded and dismissed nearly all of al-Walid&#x27;s governors. Although he maintained the militarist policies of al-Walid and Abd al-Malik, expansion of the caliphate largely ground to a halt under Sulayman ().

==Assessment and legacy==
According to the historian Giorgio Levi Della Vida, &quot;The caliphate of al-Walīd saw the harvest of the seed planted by the long work of ʿAbd al-Malik&quot;. In the assessment of Shaban: 

The historian Gerald Hawting comments that the combined reigns of al-Walid and Abd al-Malik, tied together by al-Hajjaj, represented in &quot;some ways the high point of Umayyad power, witnessing significant territorial advances both in the east and the west and the emergence of a more marked Arabic and Islamic character in the state&#x27;s public face&quot;. Domestically, it was generally a period of peace and prosperity. Kennedy asserts that al-Walid&#x27;s reign was &quot;remarkably successful and represents, perhaps, the zenith of Umayyad power&quot;, though his direct role in these successes is unclear and his primary accomplishment may have been maintaining the equilibrium between the rival factions of the Umayyad family and military.

By virtue of the conquests of Hispania, Sind and Transoxiana during his reign, his patronage of the great mosques of Damascus and Medina, and his charitable works, al-Walid&#x27;s Syrian contemporaries viewed him as &quot;the worthiest of their caliphs&quot;, according to the 9th-century historian Umar ibn Shabba. Several panegyrics were dedicated to al-Walid and his sons by al-Farazdaq, his official court poet. The latter&#x27;s contemporary, Jarir, lamented the caliph&#x27;s death in verse: &quot;O eye, weep copious tears aroused by remembrance; after today there is no point in your tears being stored.&quot; The Christian poet al-Akhtal considered al-Walid to be &quot;the caliph of God through whose rain is sought&quot;.

Al-Walid embraced the formal trappings of monarchy in a manner unprecedented among earlier caliphs. He resided at several palaces, including in Khunasira in northern Syria and Dayr Murran. The considerable wealth in his treasury allowed him to spend extravagantly on his relatives. Expectations of such grants among the growing number of Umayyad princes continued under his successors. Their generous stipends and costly private constructions were resented by &quot;nearly everyone else&quot; in the caliphate and were &quot;a drain on the treasury&quot;, according to the historian Khalid Yahya Blankinship. More significant were the costs to equip and pay the armies driving the conquests. The substantial expenditures under both Abd al-Malik and al-Walid became a financial burden on their successors, under whom the flow of war spoils, on which the caliphal economy depended, began to diminish. Blankinship notes that the enormous losses incurred during the 717–718 siege of Constantinople alone &quot;practically wiped out the gains made under al-Walid&quot;.

==Family==
Compared to his brothers, al-Walid had an &quot;exceptional number of marriages&quot;, at least nine, which &quot;reflect both his seniority in age ... and his prestige as a likely successor&quot; to Abd al-Malik, according to the historian Andrew Marsham. The marriages were intended to forge political alliances, including with potential rival families like those of the descendants of the fourth caliph, Ali (), and the prominent Umayyad statesman, Sa&#x27;id ibn al-As. Al-Walid married two of Ali&#x27;s great-granddaughters, Nafisa bint Zayd ibn al-Hasan and Zaynab bint al-Hasan ibn al-Hasan. He married Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s daughter, Amina, whose brother al-Ashdaq had been removed from the line of succession by Marwan and was killed in an attempt to topple Abd al-Malik. One of his wives was a daughter of a Qurayshite leader, Abd Allah ibn Muti, who was a key official under Ibn al-Zubayr. Among his other wives was a woman of the Qaysi Banu Fazara tribe, with whom he had his son Abu Ubayda.

Marsham notes al-Walid&#x27;s marriage to his first cousin, Umm al-Banin, &quot;tied the fortunes&quot; of Abd al-Malik and her father, Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan. From her al-Walid had his sons Abd al-Aziz, Muhammad, Marwan, and Anbasa, and a daughter, A&#x27;isha. From another Umayyad wife, Umm Abd Allah bint Abd Allah ibn Amr, a great-granddaughter of Caliph Uthman (), al-Walid had his son Abd al-Rahman. He also married Umm Abd Allah&#x27;s niece, Izza bint Abd al-Aziz, whom he divorced.

Out of his twenty-two children, fifteen were born to slave concubines, including al-Abbas, whose mother was Greek. According to al-Tabari, the mother of al-Walid&#x27;s son Yazid III () was Shah-i-Afrid (also called Shahfarand), the daughter of the Sasanian prince Peroz III and granddaughter of the last Sasanian king, Yazdegerd III (). She had been taken captive in the conquest of Transoxiana and was gifted to al-Walid by al-Hajjaj. The mother of his son Ibrahim () was a concubine named Su&#x27;ar or Budayra. His other sons by concubines were Umar, Bishr, Masrur, Mansur, Rawh, Khalid, Jaz, Maslama, Tammam, Mubashshir, Yahya, and Sadaqa.

In 744, around a dozen of al-Walid&#x27;s sons, probably resentful at being sidelined from the caliphal succession, conspired with other Umayyad princes and elites under Yazid III to topple their cousin Caliph al-Walid II (). His assassination in April 744 sparked the Third Muslim Civil War (744–750). Yazid III acceded but died six months later, after which he was succeeded by his half-brother Ibrahim. The latter did not attain wide recognition and was overthrown in December 744 by a distant Umayyad kinsman, Marwan II (). Several descendants of al-Walid, progeny of his son Rawh, were executed during the Abbasid Revolution which toppled Umayyad rule in 750. Others from the lines of his sons al-Abbas and Umar survived, including the Habibi family, which attained prominence in the Umayyad emirate of al-Andalus after its establishment in 756.

<text>Tsuga (, from Japanese (), the name of &quot;Tsuga sieboldii&quot;) is a genus of conifers in the subfamily Abietoideae of Pinaceae, the pine family. The English-language common name &quot;hemlock&quot; arose from a perceived similarity in the smell of its crushed foliage to that of the unrelated plant hemlock. Unlike the latter, &quot;Tsuga&quot; species are not poisonous.

The genus comprises eight to ten species (depending on the authority), with four species occurring in North America and four to six in eastern Asia.

==Description==
They are medium-sized to large evergreen trees, ranging from tall, with a conical to irregular crown, the latter occurring especially in some of the Asian species. The leading shoots generally droop. The bark is scaly and commonly deeply furrowed, with the colour ranging from grey to brown. The branches stem horizontally from the trunk and are usually arranged in flattened sprays that bend downward towards their tips. Short spur shoots, which are present in many gymnosperms, are weakly to moderately developed. The young twigs, as well as the distal portions of stem, are flexible and often pendent. The stems are rough with pulvini that persist after the leaves fall. The winter buds are ovoid or globose, usually rounded at the apex and not resinous.

The leaves are flattened to slightly angular and range from long and broad. They are borne singly and are arranged spirally on the stem; the leaf bases are twisted so the leaves lie flat either side of the stem or more rarely radially. Towards the base, the leaves narrow abruptly to a petiole set on a forward-angled pulvinus. The petiole is twisted at the base so it is almost parallel with the stem. The leaf apex is either notched, rounded, or acute. The undersides have two white stomatal bands (which are inconspicuous on &quot;T. mertensiana&quot;) separated by an elevated midvein. The upper surface of the leaves lack stomata, except those of &quot;T. mertensiana&quot;. They have one resin canal that is present beneath the single vascular bundle.

The pollen cones grow solitary from lateral buds. They are usually up to in length, ovoid, globose, or ellipsoid, and yellowish-white to pale purple, and borne on a short peduncle. The pollen itself has a saccate, ring-like structure at its distal pole, and rarely this structure can be more or less doubly saccate. The seed cones are borne on year-old twigs and are small ovoid-globose or oblong-cylindric, ranging from long, except in &quot;T. mertensiana&quot;, where they are cylindrical and longer, in length; they are solitary, terminal or rarely lateral, pendulous, and are sessile or on a short peduncle up to long. Maturation occurs in 5–8 months, and the seeds are shed shortly thereafter; the cones are shed soon after seed release or up to a year or two later. The seed scales are thin, leathery, and persistent. They vary in shape and lack an apophysis and an umbo. The bracts are included and small. The seeds are small, from long, and winged, with the wing being in length. They also contain small adaxial resin vesicles. Seed germination is epigeal; the seedlings have 4–6 cotyledons.

==Taxonomy==
Mountain hemlock (&quot;T. mertensiana&quot;) is unusual in the genus in several respects. The leaves are less flattened and arranged all round the shoot, and have stomata above as well as below, giving the foliage a glaucous colour; and the cones are the longest in the genus, long and cylindrical rather than ovoid. Some botanists treat it in a distinct genus as &quot;Hesperopeuce mertensiana&quot; (Bong.) Rydb., though it is more generally only considered distinct at the rank of subgenus.

The oldest fossils attributed to the genus are twigs, known from the Early Cretaceous of Inner Mongolia, China, though their relationship to modern &quot;Tsuga&quot; is not unambiguous. The earliest pollen attributed to the genus is known from the Upper Cretaceous of Poland, dating to around 90 million years ago. Abundant remains are only known from Eocene onwards, when the modern &quot;Tsuga&quot; crown group is thought to have begun to diversify. While formerly present in the region &quot;Tsuga&quot; became extinct in Europe during the Middle Pleistocene epoch around 780-440,000 years ago, due to unfavourable climate change caused by the ongoing Quaternary glaciation.

Another species, bristlecone hemlock, first described as &quot;T. longibracteata&quot;, is now treated in a distinct genus &quot;Nothotsuga&quot;; it differs from &quot;Tsuga&quot; in the erect (not pendulous) cones with exserted bracts, and male cones clustered in umbels, in these features more closely allied to the genus &quot;Keteleeria&quot;.

===Phylogeny===

The above phylogeny is in marked conflict with earlier studies, which found &quot;T. mertensiana&quot; as basal to the rest of the genus.

=== Species ===
; Accepted living species
* &quot;Tsuga canadensis&quot; – eastern hemlock – Eastern Canada, Eastern United States
* &quot;Tsuga caroliniana&quot; – Carolina hemlock – Southern Appalachians
* &quot;Tsuga chinensis&quot; – Taiwan hemlock – Taiwan, Tibet, much of China
* &quot;Tsuga diversifolia&quot; – northern Japanese hemlock – Honshu, Kyushu
* &quot;Tsuga dumosa&quot; – Himalayan hemlock – Himalayas, Tibet, Yunnan, Sichuan
* &quot;Tsuga forrestii&quot; – Forrest&#x27;s hemlock – Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou
* &quot;Tsuga heterophylla&quot; – western hemlock – Western Canada, Northwestern United States
* &quot;Tsuga × jeffreyi&quot; – British Columbia, Washington (doubtful; often treated as a variety of &quot;T. mertensiana&quot;, with no verified evidence of hybrid origin)
* &quot;Tsuga mertensiana&quot; – mountain hemlock – Alaska, British Columbia, Western United States
* &quot;Tsuga sieboldii&quot; – southern Japanese hemlock – Japan
* &quot;Tsuga ulleungensis&quot; – Ulleungdo hemlock – Ulleung Island, Korea

;Accepted paleospecies
* †&quot;Tsuga aburaensis&quot; - Abura, Hokkaido (Miocene)
* †&quot;Tsuga asiatica&quot; - Lawula Formation, Tibet (Priabonian)
* †&quot;Tsuga europaea&quot; - Maria Mine, Alsdorf, North Rhine-Westphalia (Miocene)
* †&quot;Tsuga nanfengensis&quot; - Yunnan (Late Miocene)
* †&quot;Tsuga swedaea&quot; - Buchanan Lake Formation, Axel Heiberg Island (Lutetian)
* †&quot;Tsuga taxoides&quot; - Inner Mongolia (Early Cretaceous)
* †&quot;Tsuga xianfengensis&quot; - Yunnan (Late Miocene)

==Ecology==
The species are all adapted to (and are confined to) relatively moist, cool temperate areas with high rainfall, cool summers, and little or no water stress; they are also adapted to cope with heavy to very heavy winter snowfall and tolerate ice storms better than most other trees. Hemlock trees are more tolerant of heavy shade than other conifers; they are, however, more susceptible to drought.

=== Threats ===
The two eastern North American species, &quot;T. canadensis&quot; and &quot;T. caroliniana&quot;, are under serious threat by the sap-sucking insect &quot;Adelges tsugae&quot; (hemlock woolly adelgid). This adelgid, related to the aphids, was introduced accidentally from eastern Asia, where it is only a minor pest. Extensive mortality has occurred, particularly east of the Appalachian Mountains. The Asian species are resistant to this pest, and the two western American hemlocks are moderately resistant. In North America, hemlocks are also attacked by hemlock looper. Larger infected hemlocks have large, relatively high root systems that can bring other trees down if one falls. The foliage of young trees is often browsed by deer, and the seeds are eaten by finches and small rodents.

Old trees are commonly attacked by various fungal disease and decay species, notably &quot;Heterobasidion annosum&quot; and &quot;Armillaria&quot; species, which rot the heartwood and eventually leave the tree liable to windthrow, and &quot;Rhizina undulata&quot;, which may kill groups of trees following minor grass fires that activate growth of the &quot;Rhizina&quot; spores.

==Uses==
The wood obtained from hemlocks is important in the timber industry, especially for use as wood pulp. Many species are used in horticulture, and numerous cultivars have been selected for use in gardens. The bark is also used in tanning leather. The needles are sometimes used to make a tea and perfume.

<doc id="437349" wikidata="Q366520" url="?curid=437349" title="Marquess of Exeter">
<text>Marquess of Exeter is a title that has been created twice, once in the peerage of England and once in the peerage of the United Kingdom. The first creation came in the peerage of England in 1525 for Henry Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon. For more information on this creation, which was forfeited in 1538, see Earl of Devon.

==History==
The title is chiefly associated with the Cecil family, descended from the courtier Sir Richard Cecil of the parish of Stamford Baron St Martin in Northamptonshire. His only son, Sir William Cecil, was a prominent statesman and served as Secretary of State, Lord High Treasurer and Lord Privy Seal. In 1571 he was created Baron Burghley, in the County of Northampton, in the Peerage of England. His son from his second marriage to Mildred Cooke, Sir Robert Cecil, was created Earl of Salisbury in 1605 and is the ancestor of the Marquesses of Salisbury. Lord Burghley was succeeded by his son from his first marriage to Mary Cheke, Thomas, the second Baron. He represented Stamford, Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire in the House of Commons, served as Lord Lieutenant of Yorkshire and as President of the Council of the North and was also a distinguished soldier. In 1605 Thomas Cecil was created Earl of Exeter in the Peerage of England (on the same day his half-brother was created Earl of Salisbury).

Thomas was succeeded by his eldest son William Cecil, the second Earl. He served as Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire. Lord Exeter married as his first wife Elizabeth, 16th Baroness de Ros. Their son William succeeded his mother in the barony at the age of one. However, he died childless during his father&#x27;s lifetime (when the barony was inherited by his cousin Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland). Lord Exeter had no other sons and was succeeded by his nephew, the third Earl. He was the son of Sir Richard Cecil, second son of the first Earl. He represented Peterborough in the Short Parliament. His son, the fourth Earl, was Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Earl. He sat as member of parliament for Northamptonshire.

His son, the sixth Earl, represented Rutland in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Rutland. His second son, the eighth Earl (who succeeded his elder brother), briefly represented Stamford in the House of Commons. His eldest son, the ninth Earl, was member of parliament for Rutland and also Lord Lieutenant of that county. He was childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the tenth Earl. He was the son of Thomas Chambers Cecil, second son of the eighth Earl.

=== Creation as Marquess ===
Lord Exeter represented Stamford in Parliament for sixteen years. In 1801 he was created Marquess of Exeter in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

His son, the second Marquess, was a Tory politician and notably served as Lord Chamberlain of the Household and Lord Steward of the Household. He was succeeded by his son, the third Marquess. He was a Conservative politician and held office as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household and Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms. His eldest son, the fourth Marquess, represented Northamptonshire North in the House of Commons and served briefly as Vice-Chamberlain of the Household under his kinsman Lord Salisbury. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Marquess. He was a Colonel in the Royal Field Artillery and served as Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire.
His eldest son, the sixth Marquess, was a Conservative politician and prominent athlete and sports official. He won the 400-metre hurdles at the 1928 Summer Olympics and was later President of the International Amateur Athletic Federation and vice-president of the International Olympic Committee. Lord Exeter also represented Peterborough in the House of Commons and served as Governor of Bermuda. He died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his younger brother, the seventh Marquess. He was proprietor of a cattle ranch at 100 Mile House, British Columbia, in Canada. In 1954 he became head of the Emissaries of Divine Light, an obscure religious group. the titles are held by his only son, the eighth Marquess, who succeeded in 1988. He operates the ranch; from 1988 to 1996 he also headed the Emissaries of Divine Light.

Another member of the Cecil family was the naval commander Edward Cecil, 1st Viscount Wimbledon (a title which became extinct on his death in 1638). He was the third son of the first Earl of Exeter. Also, Lord William Cecil, third son of the third Marquess, married Mary, 2nd Baroness Amherst of Hackney. Their grandson William succeeded in the barony in 1919. Another member of this branch of the family is Vice-Admiral Sir Nigel Cecil. The champion racehorse trainer Sir Henry Cecil was the son of Henry Cecil, a younger brother of the third Baron. Lord John Joicey-Cecil, fourth son of the third Marquess, was Conservative Member of Parliament for Stamford.

The marquessate of Exeter is the senior marquessate in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The Marquesses also hold the title of hereditary Grand Almoner and Lord Paramount of Peterborough.

The ancestral home of the Marquesses of Exeter is Burghley House, near Stamford, Lincolnshire; it is now run by a trust founded by the family. Former properties include Cecil House in London and Exeter House, Derby. The traditional burial place of the Cecils of Burghley House and the Marquesses of Exeter is the Burghley Chapel in St Martin&#x27;s Church, Stamford.

<doc id="437350" wikidata="Q284233" url="?curid=437350" title="Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik">
<text>Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (, 24 September 717) was the seventh Umayyad caliph, ruling from 715 until his death. He was the son of Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (r. 685–705) and Wallada bint al-Abbas. He began his career as governor of Palestine, while his father Abd al-Malik () and brother al-Walid I () reigned as caliphs. There, the theologian Raja ibn Haywa al-Kindi mentored him, and he forged close ties with Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, a major opponent of al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, al-Walid&#x27;s powerful viceroy of Iraq and the eastern Caliphate. Sulayman resented al-Hajjaj&#x27;s influence over his brother. As governor, Sulayman founded the city of Ramla and built the White Mosque in it. The new city superseded Lydda as the district capital of Palestine. Lydda was at least partly destroyed and its inhabitants may have been forcibly relocated to Ramla, which developed into an economic hub, became home to many Muslim scholars, and remained the commercial and administrative center of Palestine until the 11th century.

After acceding as caliph, Sulayman dismissed his predecessor&#x27;s governors and generals. Many had been handpicked by al-Hajjaj and had led the war efforts which brought the Caliphate to its greatest territorial extent. Among them were the conqueror of Transoxiana (Central Asia), Qutayba ibn Muslim, who was killed by his own troops in an abortive revolt in anticipation of his dismissal, and the conqueror of Sind (the western Indian subcontinent), Muhammad ibn al-Qasim, who was executed. In the west, Sulayman deposed Musa ibn Nusayr, the conqueror of the Iberian Peninsula (al-Andalus) and governor of Ifriqiya (central North Africa), and had his son Abd al-Aziz, governor of al-Andalus, assassinated. Although he continued his predecessors&#x27; militarist policies, expansion largely stopped under Sulayman, partly due to effective resistance along the Central Asian frontiers and the collapse of Arab military leadership and organization there after Qutayba&#x27;s death. Sulayman&#x27;s appointee over the eastern Caliphate, his confidant Yazid, invaded the southern Caspian coast in 716, but withdrew and settled for a tributary arrangement after being defeated by the local Iranian rulers. Sulayman intensified the war with the Byzantine Empire, the primary focus of his war efforts, culminating in the 717–718 siege of Constantinople, which ended in a disastrous Arab defeat.

Sulayman died in Dabiq during the siege. His eldest son and chosen successor, Ayyub, had predeceased him. Sulayman made the unconventional choice of nominating his cousin, Umar, as caliph, rather than a son or a brother. The siege of Constantinople and the coinciding of his reign with the approaching centennial of the Hijra (start of the Islamic calendar), led contemporary Arab poets to view Sulayman in messianic terms.

==Early life==
The details about Sulayman&#x27;s first thirty years of life in the medieval sources are scant. He was likely born in Medina around 675. His father, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, belonged to the Umayyad clan of the Quraysh tribe, while his mother, Wallada bint al-Abbas ibn al-Jaz, was a great-granddaughter of Zuhayr ibn Jadhima, a prominent 6th-century chieftain of the Arab tribe of Banu Abs. Sulayman was partly raised in the desert by his Banu Abs kinsmen.
At the time of his birth, the Caliphate was ruled by Sulayman&#x27;s distant cousin, Mu&#x27;awiya I, who had founded the ruling Umayyad dynasty in 661. Following the deaths of Mu&#x27;awiya I&#x27;s successors, Yazid I and Mu&#x27;awiya II, in 683 and 684, Umayyad authority collapsed across the Caliphate and most provinces recognized the non-Umayyad, Mecca-based, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, as caliph. The Umayyads of Medina, including Sulayman, were therefore expelled from the city and became refugees in Syria, where they were supported by loyalist Arab tribes. These tribes elected Sulayman&#x27;s grandfather, Marwan I, as caliph and formed the Yaman confederation in opposition to the Qaysi tribes, who dominated northern Syria and the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) and supported Ibn al-Zubayr. By 685, Marwan had reestablished Umayyad control over Syria and Egypt. Abd al-Malik, who succeeded him, had by 692 reconquered the rest of the Caliphate.

==Governorship of Palestine==
At an unknown date, Abd al-Malik appointed Sulayman governor of Jund Filastin (the military district of Palestine), a post Abd al-Malik formerly held under Marwan. Sulayman&#x27;s appointment followed stints by the Caliph&#x27;s uncle, Yahya ibn al-Hakam, and half-brother, Aban ibn Marwan. In 701, Sulayman led the Hajj rituals in Mecca. Before Abd al-Malik died in 705, he nominated his eldest son, al-Walid I, as his successor, to be followed by Sulayman. Sulayman remained governor of Palestine throughout al-Walid&#x27;s reign, which lasted until 715. His governorship likely brought him in close contact with the Yamani chieftains who dominated the district. He established a strong relationship with Raja ibn Haywa al-Kindi, a local, Yamani-affiliated religious scholar who had previously supervised the construction of Abd al-Malik&#x27;s Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. Raja became Sulayman&#x27;s tutor and senior aide.

Sulayman resented the influence of al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, the viceroy of Iraq and the eastern parts of the Caliphate, over al-Walid, and cultivated ties with his opponents. In 708 or 709, he gave refuge to the fugitive and former governor of Khurasan, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, and his family, the Muhallabids. Al-Hajjaj had dismissed and imprisoned Yazid but he had escaped to Palestine. There, Yazid used his tribal connections with the district&#x27;s large Yamani Azdi population to gain Sulayman&#x27;s protection. Al-Walid was angered with Yazid&#x27;s defiance of al-Hajjaj, so Sulayman offered to pay the fine al-Hajjaj had imposed on Yazid. He also sent the latter and his own son, Ayyub, in shackles to the Caliph, with a letter pleading for the Muhallabids&#x27; pardon, which the Caliph granted. Yazid became a close confidant of Sulayman, who held him in &quot;the highest regard&quot;, according to a report by the historian Hisham ibn al-Kalbi (737–819). Hisham further noted &quot;Yazid ... stayed with him [Sulayman], teaching him how to dress well, making delicious dishes for him, and giving him large presents&quot;. Yazid remained with Sulayman for nine months, or until al-Hajjaj died in 714, and highly influenced and prejudiced him against al-Hajjaj.

===Foundation of Ramla===
As governor, Sulayman founded the city of Ramla as the seat of his administration, replacing Lydda, the Muslims&#x27; original provincial capital and Sulayman&#x27;s first residence in Palestine. Ramla remained the capital of Palestine through the Fatimid period (10th–11th centuries). His motives for founding Ramla were personal ambition and practical considerations. The location of Lydda, a long-established and prosperous city, was logistically and economically advantageous. Sulayman established his capital outside of the city proper. According to the historian Nimrod Luz, this was likely due to a lack of available space for wide-scale development and agreements dating to the Muslim conquest in the 630s that, at least formally, precluded him from confiscating desirable property within the city. In a tradition recorded by the historian Ibn Fadlallah al-Umari (d. 1347), a determined local Christian cleric refused Sulayman&#x27;s requests for plots in the middle of Lydda. Infuriated, he attempted to have the cleric executed, but Raja dissuaded him and instead proposed building a new city at a superior, adjacent site. The historian Moshe Sharon holds that Lydda was &quot;too Christian in ethos for the taste of the Umayyad rulers&quot;, particularly following the Arabization and Islamization reforms instituted by Abd al-Malik. According to al-Jahshiyari (d. 942), Sulayman sought a lasting reputation as a great builder following the example of his father and al-Walid, the respective founders of the Dome of the Rock and Great Mosque of Damascus. The construction of Ramla was his &quot;way to immortality&quot; and &quot;his personal stamp on the landscape of Palestine&quot;, according to Luz. In choosing the site, Sulayman utilized the strategic advantages of Lydda&#x27;s vicinity while avoiding the physical constraints of an already-established urban center.

The first structure Sulayman erected in Ramla was his palatial residence, which dually served as the seat of Palestine&#x27;s administration (). At the center of the new city was a congregational mosque, later known as the White Mosque. It was not completed until the reign of Caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (). From early on, Ramla developed economically as a market town for the surrounding area&#x27;s agricultural products, and as a center for dyeing, weaving and pottery. It was also home to many Muslim religious scholars. Sulayman built an aqueduct in the city called al-Barada, which transported water to Ramla from Tel Gezer, about to the southeast. Ramla superseded Lydda as the commercial center of Palestine. Many of Lydda&#x27;s Christian, Samaritan and Jewish inhabitants were moved to the new city. Although the traditional accounts are in agreement that Lydda almost immediately fell into obscurity following the founding of Ramla, narratives vary about the extent of Sulayman&#x27;s efforts to transfer Lydda&#x27;s inhabitants to Ramla, some holding that he only demolished a church in Lydda and others that he demolished the city altogether. Al-Ya&#x27;qubi (d. 839) noted Sulayman razed the houses of Lydda&#x27;s inhabitants to force their relocation to Ramla and punished those who resisted. In the words of al-Jahshiyari, Sulayman &quot;founded the town of al-Ramla and its mosque and thus caused the ruin of Lod [Lydda]&quot;.

Jerusalem, located southeast of Ramla, remained the region&#x27;s religious focal point. According to an 8th-century Arabic source, Sulayman ordered the construction of several public buildings there, including a bathhouse, at the same time that al-Walid was developing the Temple Mount (Haram al-Sharif). The bathhouse was used for ablution by Muslims worshipping at the Dome of the Rock. Sulayman is further credited by an anonymous 13th-century Syriac chronicler for building arches, mills and gardens in Jericho, but these were later destroyed by floods. He also maintained an agricultural tract near Qutayfa, in the environs of Damascus, that was called &quot;al-Sulaymaniyya&quot; after him.

==Caliphate==
===Accession===
In 714, al-Walid, encouraged or supported by al-Hajjaj, attempted to install his son Abd al-Aziz as his successor, voiding the arrangements set by Abd al-Malik, which made Sulayman heir apparent. According to the historian Umar ibn Shabba (d. 878), al-Walid offered Sulayman generous financial incentives to agree to the change, but he refused. Al-Walid, nonetheless, issued requests to his provincial governors to recognize Abd al-Aziz, but only received favorable responses from al-Hajjaj and Qutayba ibn Muslim, the governor of Khurasan and conqueror of Transoxiana. An adviser of al-Walid, Abbad ibn Ziyad, counseled the Caliph to pressure Sulayman by summoning him to the Caliph&#x27;s court in Damascus, and then, after Sulayman stalled in his response, to mobilize his (select troops) and move against Sulayman in Ramla. Al-Walid died shortly after, on 24 February 715. Sulayman received the news at his estate in al-Sab&#x27; (Bayt Jibrin), and acceded to the caliphate unopposed.

Sulayman obtained oaths of allegiance in Ramla, and in Damascus during his only recorded visit to that city. He continued to govern from Palestine, where he &quot;was much beloved&quot;, in the words of the historian Julius Wellhausen, instead of Damascus, the Umayyads&#x27; traditional administrative capital. The historian Reinhard Eisener asserted that the medieval &quot;Syrian sources prove he obviously chose Jerusalem as his principal seat of government&quot;, while Wellhausen and the historian Hugh N. Kennedy held that he remained in Ramla.

===Provincial politics===
In his first year in office, Sulayman replaced most of al-Walid&#x27;s and al-Hajjaj&#x27;s provincial appointees with governors loyal to him. It is unclear whether these changes were the result of resentment and suspicion toward previous opponents of his accession, a means to ensure control over the provinces by appointing loyal officials, or a policy to end the rule of strong, old-established governors. While Eisener argued Sulayman&#x27;s &quot;choice of governors does not give the impression of bias&quot; toward the Yaman faction, Kennedy asserted that the Caliph&#x27;s reign marked the political comeback of the Yaman and &quot;reflected his Yamani leanings&quot;. One of his immediate decisions was to install his confidant, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, as governor of Iraq. According to the historian Muhammad Abdulhayy Shaban, Sulayman considered Yazid to be his &quot;own al-Hajjaj&quot;. Yazid acted with a staunch preference for the Yaman, but according to Wellhausen, there is no indication that Sulayman favored one faction over the other. Wellhausen held that Sulayman, from the time he was governor of Palestine, &quot;may have been persuaded&quot; that the rule of al-Hajjaj engendered hatred among the Iraqis toward the Umayyads rather than fostering their loyalty. Sulayman thus opposed him and his influence and deposed his appointees and allies, not because of their Qaysi affiliation, but because of their personal connection with al-Hajjaj. Sulayman kept close ties with the Qaysi troops of the Jazira.

A protege of al-Hajjaj, Qutayba ibn Muslim, whose relations with Sulayman had been antagonistic, was confirmed in his post by the Caliph, but remained wary that his dismissal was pending. At the time of Sulayman&#x27;s accession, he had been leading his troops on an expedition toward the Jaxartes valley in Transoxiana. While stopping in Ferghana, he declared a rebellion against Sulayman, but most of his troops, exhausted by the constant campaigns into distant lands, turned against him. Qutayba was killed by an army faction led by Waki ibn Abi Sud al-Tamimi in August 715. Waki declared himself governor of Khurasan, and was confirmed by Sulayman, but the latter restricted his authority to military affairs. Sulayman was concerned that Waki&#x27;s nomination by the tribal factions of the Khurasani army (rather than by his own initiative) would lead to instability in the province. Meanwhile, al-Hajjaj&#x27;s kinsman and leader of the conquest of Sind, Muhammad ibn al-Qasim, did not revolt against Sulayman, but was nonetheless dismissed, summoned to Wasit, and tortured to death.

Waki&#x27;s provisional governorship lasted nine months, ending in mid-716. Yazid had persuaded Sulayman that Waki was a troublesome Bedouin (Arab nomad) lacking administrative qualities. Khurasan, along with the other eastern parts of the Caliphate, were attached to Yazid&#x27;s Iraqi governorship. The Caliph directed Yazid to relocate to Khurasan and leave lieutenant governors in the Iraqi garrison towns of Kufa, Basra and Wasit, while entrusting Iraq&#x27;s fiscal affairs to his own appointee, a (pl. ; non-Arab freedman or client) with lengthy experience in the province, Salih ibn Abd al-Rahman.

Between 715 and 716, Sulayman dismissed Khalid ibn Abdallah al-Qasri and Uthman ibn Hayyan al-Murri, the respective governors of Mecca and Medina, both of whom owed their appointments to al-Hajjaj. Khalid, later considered a champion of the Yaman, was replaced by an Umayyad family member, Sulayman&#x27;s brother-in-law Abd al-Aziz ibn Abdallah ibn Khalid ibn Asid.

In the west, Sulayman dismissed Musa ibn Nusayr, the Yamani-affiliated governor of Ifriqiya and conqueror of Hispania (al-Andalus), and his son Abd al-Aziz, the governor of al-Andalus. Musa was imprisoned by Sulayman upon his accession and Abd al-Aziz was assassinated on Sulayman&#x27;s orders in March 716. The assassination order was carried out by some of the leading Arab commanders in al-Andalus, including Abd al-Aziz&#x27;s top lieutenant Habib ibn Abi Ubayd al-Fihri. Al-Tabari held that Habib delivered Abd al-Aziz&#x27;s head to the Caliph. Sulayman installed a of the Quraysh in place of Musa, and under his order, the new governor confiscated the wealth of Musa&#x27;s family in Ifriqiya and had them tortured and killed. Musa had a history of embezzling funds during his career and Sulayman extorted considerable sums from him during his imprisonment.

===War efforts===

Although he largely replaced their governors, Sulayman maintained his predecessors&#x27; militarist policies. Nonetheless, during his relatively short reign, the territorial expansion of the Caliphate that occurred under al-Walid virtually came to a halt.

====Transoxiana====
On the eastern front, in Transoxiana, further conquests were not achieved for a quarter century after Qutayba&#x27;s death, during which time the Arabs began to lose territory in the region. Sulayman ordered the withdrawal of the Khurasani army from Ferghana to Merv, and its subsequent disbandment. No military activity was carried out under Waki. Under Yazid&#x27;s deputy in Transoxiana, his son Mukhallad, expeditions were limited to summertime raids against Sogdian villages. The historian H. A. R. Gibb attributed the Arab military regression in Transoxiana to the void in leadership and organization left by Qutayba&#x27;s death. Eisener partly attributed it to more effective resistance along the frontiers. The halt in the conquests was not an indication that &quot;the impulse of expansion and conquest slackened&quot; under Sulayman, according to Eisener.

====Jurjan and Tabaristan====
In 716, Yazid attempted to conquer the principalities of Jurjan and Tabaristan, located along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. Ruled by local Iranian dynasties and shielded by the Alborz Mountains, these regions had remained largely independent of Muslim rule, despite repeated attempts to subdue them. The campaign lasted for four months and involved a 100,000-strong army derived from the garrisons of Kufa, Basra, Rayy, Merv and Syria. It marked the first deployment of Syrian troops, the elite military faction of the Caliphate, to Khurasan. Yazid defeated the Chöl Turks north of the river Atrek, and secured control of Jurjan by founding a city there (modern Gonbad-e Kavus). In a letter, Yazid congratulated Sulayman on the conquests of the two territories, which had eluded previous caliphs until &quot;God made this conquest on behalf&quot; of Sulayman. Yazid&#x27;s initial success was reversed by Tabaristan&#x27;s ruler, Farrukhan the Great, and his coalition from neighboring Daylam, Gilan, and Jurjan in later confrontations that year. Afterward, Yazid withdrew Muslim troops from the region in return for a tributary arrangement with Farrukhan. Tabaristan remained independent of Arab rule until 760, when it was conquered by the Abbasids, the successors of the Umayyads, but remained a restive province dominated by local dynasts.

====Siege of Constantinople====

The Caliph&#x27;s principal military focus was the perennial war with Byzantium, which was not only the largest, richest, and strongest of the Caliphate&#x27;s enemies, but also directly adjacent to Syria, the center of Umayyad power. The Umayyads&#x27; first attack on the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, under Mu&#x27;awiya I had failed. Nevertheless, from 692 onwards, the Umayyads had been on the offensive, secured control of Armenia and the Caucasian principalities, and gradually encroached upon the borderlands of the empire. Umayyad generals, often members of the ruling family, raided Byzantine territory every year, capturing towns and fortresses. Aided by a prolonged period of instability in Byzantium, by 712, the Byzantine defensive system began to show signs of collapse, as Arab raids penetrated ever deeper into Asia Minor.
Following the death of al-Walid I, Sulayman took up the project to capture Constantinople with increased vigor. In late 716, upon returning from the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Sulayman encamped and mobilized his army in Dabiq in northern Syria. From there, he oversaw the massive war effort against the Byzantines. Being too ill to lead the campaign in person, he dispatched his half-brother Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik to besiege the Byzantine capital from the land, with orders to remain until the city was conquered or he was recalled by the Caliph. Already from early 716, the Arab commander Umar ibn Hubayra al-Fazari had launched a parallel naval campaign against Constantinople. While many troops were dispatched toward the Byzantine capital, Sulayman appointed his son Dawud to lead a summer campaign against the Byzantine frontier in 717, during which he captured Hisn al-Mar&#x27;a (&quot;the Woman&#x27;s Fortress&quot;) near Malatya.

Sulayman&#x27;s efforts ultimately failed. The Byzantines repulsed the Umayyad fleet from Constantinople in the summer of 717, while Maslama&#x27;s army maintained its siege of the city. Umayyad fleets sent in the summer of 718 to aid the besiegers were destroyed by the Byzantines, while an Umayyad relief army was routed and repulsed in Anatolia. Having failed in the siege, Maslama&#x27;s army withdrew from Constantinople in August 718. The massive losses incurred during the campaign led to a partial retrenchment of the Umayyad forces from the captured Byzantine frontier districts, but already in 720, Umayyad raids against Byzantium recommenced. Nevertheless, the goal of conquering Constantinople was effectively abandoned, and the frontier between the two empires stabilized along the line of the Taurus and Anti-Taurus Mountains, over which both sides continued to launch regular raids and counter-raids during the next centuries.

==Death and succession==
Sulayman died in Dabiq in September 717, and was buried there. The 11th-century Nestorian Christian chronicler Elias of Nisibis dated his death to 20 September or 21 September, while the 8th-century Muslim historian Abu Mikhnaf placed it on 23 September or 24 September. He fell ill after returning from the Friday prayers and died a few days later.

Sulayman designated his eldest son Ayyub as his successor in 715 or 716, after the death of his brother and potential successor, Marwan al-Akbar. The order is partly corroborated by an ode from the contemporary poet Jarir: The Imam, whose gifts will be hoped for, after the Imam [Sulayman], is the chosen successor, Ayyub ... You [Ayyub] are the successor to the merciful one [Sulayman], the one whom the people who recite the Psalms recognize, the one whose name is inscribed in the Torah. 

But Ayyub died in early 717, succumbing to the so-called (&quot;plague of the Notables&quot;), that afflicted Syria and Iraq. The same plague may have caused Sulayman&#x27;s death. On his deathbed, Sulayman considered nominating his other son Dawud, but Raja advised against it, arguing that Dawud was away fighting in Constantinople and that it was unclear if he was still alive. Raja counseled Sulayman to choose his paternal cousin and adviser, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, describing him as a &quot;worthy, excellent man and a sincere Muslim&quot;. To avoid potential intra-dynastic strife between Umar and Sulayman&#x27;s brothers, Yazid ibn Abd al-Malik was appointed Umar&#x27;s successor. Sulayman&#x27;s nomination of Umar over his own brothers defied the general assumptions among the Umayyad family that the office of the caliph would be restricted to the household of Abd al-Malik. Raja was chosen to execute Sulayman&#x27;s will and secured allegiance to Umar from the Caliph&#x27;s brothers by threatening them with the use of force, following their protestations at being bypassed. According to Eisener, Raja&#x27;s personal connections to the traditional Muslim reports about Sulayman&#x27;s nomination of Umar render Raja&#x27;s role in the succession arrangements as &quot;likely ... exaggerated&quot;. According to Shaban, Sulayman nominated Umar because he was the contender &quot;most sympathetic to his policies&quot;.

==Assessment and legacy==
According to Eisener, it is challenging &quot;to form an appropriate picture of Sulayman&#x27;s reign&quot;, due to its short duration. Shaban held that Sulayman&#x27;s short rule would &quot;permit more than one interpretation&quot;, which is the reason &quot;he is such an ambiguous figure for the historian.&quot; Shaban has noted that the &quot;importance of Sulayman&#x27;s reign does not seem to have been realized&quot; due to the medieval sources&#x27; &quot;overwhelming emphasis&quot; on the reign of his successor, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz. While Shaban and Kennedy have emphasized Sulayman&#x27;s championing of the Yaman faction and opposition to the Qays, Eisener has viewed his provincial and military appointments as motivated by a desire to consolidate his control over the Caliphate by installing loyalists in positions of power, factional affiliations notwithstanding. Eisener and Shaban have noted that Sulayman generally maintained the expansionist policies of al-Walid and Abd al-Malik.

While Shaban has highlighted Sulayman&#x27;s attempts to further integrate the into the military hierarchy, the historian Patricia Crone has rejected that Sulayman oversaw any policy change regarding their integration. Several Islamic traditional sources credited Sulayman for reversing al-Hajjaj&#x27;s measures against non-Arab, Muslim converts by allowing the return to Basra of either the urban who had supported the anti-Umayyad revolt of Ibn al-Ash&#x27;ath in 700–701, or the Iraqi peasants who converted to Islam and moved to Basra to avoid the (poll tax designated for non-Muslims). Crone has viewed the traditional accounts of Sulayman&#x27;s policies regarding the runaway peasant converts as &quot;badly attested&quot;.

In the panegyrics of Sulayman&#x27;s contemporary poets, al-Farazdaq and Jarir, Sulayman is viewed in messianic terms as the Mahdi (&quot;rightly guided one&quot;) sent to restore justice after a period of oppression. Al-Farazdaq praised Sulayman for addressing all grievances and heralded him as the one &quot;predicted by priests and rabbis&quot;. The messianic views of Sulayman may have been connected to the approaching centennial of the Hijrah and the associated Muslim hopes for the conquest of Constantinople during his reign. Several hadiths (sayings or traditions attributed to Muhammad) associated the conquest of the city with the Mahdi and Sulayman entered the role in his attempt to conquer it. &quot;Sensibly&quot;, according to Crone, Sulayman did not publicly reference the widespread belief among Muslims that their community or the world would be destroyed on the centennial.

Sulayman was known to lead a licentious life and the traditional sources hold that he was gluttonous and promiscuous. Al-Ya&#x27;qubi described him as &quot;a voracious eater ... attractive and eloquent ... a tall man, white, and with a body that could not bear hunger&quot;. He was highly skilled in Arabic oratory. Despite his lifestyle, his political sympathies laid with the pious, chiefly evidenced by his deference to Raja&#x27;s counsel. He also cultivated ties to the religious opponents of al-Hajjaj in Iraq. He was financially generous toward the Alids (the closest surviving kinsmen of the Islamic prophet Muhammad). He installed as governor of Medina Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad al-Ansari, a member of the city&#x27;s pious circles, despite his family&#x27;s role in the fatal rebellion against the early clansman and patron of the Umayyads, Caliph Uthman (), revenge for whom had served as an ideological rallying point and foundational event for the Umayyad dynasty. In contrast to contemporary poetry, the Islamic tradition considers Sulayman to have been cruel and unjust, his overtures to the pious stemming from the guilt of his immoral conduct.

==Family==
Sulayman had four wives from different branches of the Umayyad family. Among them was Ayyub&#x27;s mother, Umm Aban bint Aban, a granddaughter of al-Hakam ibn Abi al-As, the father of Marwan I. Another of his Umayyad wives was Umm Yazid bint Abd Allah, a granddaughter of Caliph Yazid I and sister of the future pretender to the caliphate, Abu Muhammad al-Sufyani. She was the mother of Sulayman&#x27;s sons Yazid, al-Qasim, and Sa&#x27;id. Sulayman&#x27;s wife A&#x27;isha bint Abd Allah ibn Amr was a great-granddaughter of Caliph Uthman () and mother to Sulayman&#x27;s sons Yahya and Abd Allah. He was also married to Umm Amr, a daughter of Abd Allah ibn Khalid ibn Asid, from whom he had his sons Abd al-Wahid, the future governor of Medina and Mecca under Caliph Marwan II (), and Abd al-Aziz.

Among his other wives were Su&#x27;da bint Yahya, a granddaughter of Talha ibn Ubayd Allah, who was a senior companion of Muhammad and an early Muslim leader, and A&#x27;isha bint Asma bint Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith, a member of the prominent Qurayshite clan of Banu Makhzum, who bore him two sons. From his slave concubines, Sulayman had his sons Dawud, Muhammad, al-Harith, Umar, and Abd al-Rahman, the last of whom died a child. In all, Sulayman had fourteen sons. Muhammad, who was twelve years old at the time of his father&#x27;s death, was the eldest to have survived him and lived to the reign of Caliph al-Walid II ().

Sulayman&#x27;s sons remained in Palestine and maintained strong ties with the district&#x27;s Yamani tribal nobility. The Arab tribes which formed Palestine&#x27;s garrison were committed to the family. In 744, they unsuccessfully attempted to install its head, Sulayman&#x27;s son Yazid, as caliph. Sulayman&#x27;s property in Palestine remained in his family&#x27;s possession until the Abbasid Revolution toppled the Umayyad dynasty in 750, after which they were confiscated by the Abbasid family. Some of his descendants, from the lines of Dawud and Abd al-Wahid, were recorded by the sources living in the Umayyad emirate (756–929) and caliphate (929–1031) of al-Andalus.

<doc id="437351" wikidata="Q1623060" url="?curid=437351" title="Marquess of Northampton">
<text>Marquess of Northampton is a title that has been created twice, firstly in the Peerage of England (1547), then secondly in the Peerage of the United Kingdom (1812). The current holder of this title is Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton.

==First creation==
The title of Marquess of Northampton was created for the first time in the Peerage of England in 1547 in favour of William Parr, brother of Catherine Parr, the sixth and last wife of King Henry VIII. The title was forfeited in 1554 after the accession of Queen Mary but restored in 1559 by Queen Elizabeth I. On Parr&#x27;s death in 1571, the title became extinct.

==Second creation==
However, the title is chiefly associated with the Compton family. This family descends from Sir Henry Compton, who in 1572 was summoned to the House of Lords as Baron Compton, of Compton in the County of Warwick. This title was in the Peerage of England. Lord Compton was later one of the peers at the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron, the later first Earl. He served as Lord President of the Marches and of the Dominion of Wales and was also Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire. In 1618 he was created Earl of Northampton in the Peerage of England.

His son, the second Earl, was a supporter of King James I and served as Master of the Robes to Charles, Prince of Wales (later King Charles I). He fought in the Civil War and was killed at the Battle of Hopton Heath in 1643. He was succeeded by his son, the third Earl. He also fought as a Royalist in the Civil War and notably commanded the cavalry at the First Battle of Newbury in 1643. Lord Northampton was also Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire and Constable of the Tower of London. His eldest son, the fourth Earl, also served as Constable of the Tower of London and as Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire.

His eldest son, the fifth Earl, briefly represented Warwick in the House of Commons but in 1711 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Compton. He married Elizabeth, 15th Baroness Ferrers of Chartley. They had no sons and Lord Northampton was succeeded in the barony of Compton, which could be passed on through female lines, by his daughter Lady Charlotte. The earldom passed to his younger brother, the sixth Earl. He had earlier represented Tamworth and Northampton in Parliament.

He was childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the seventh Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Charles Compton, third son of the fourth Earl. Lord Northampton died childless at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. He briefly represented Northampton in the House of Commons before he inherited the earldom and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire. His son, the ninth Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Northampton and served as Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire. In 1812 he was created Baron Wilmington, of Wilmington in the County of Sussex, Earl Compton, of Compton in the County of Warwick, and Marquess of Northampton. These titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

On his death, the titles passed to his son, the second Marquess. He represented Northampton in Parliament but is best remembered as a patron of science and the arts. Between 1838 and 1848 he served as president of the Royal Society. He was also instrumental in helping the new College of Preceptors (College of Teachers) of London receive its Royal Charter. Lord Northampton married Margaret Douglas-Maclean-Clephane, daughter of Major-General Douglas Maclean Clephane. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Marquess. In 1831 he assumed by Royal licence the additional and principal surname of Douglas. When he died the titles were inherited by his younger brother, the fourth Marquess. He was an admiral in the Royal Navy. Lord Northampton assumed in 1851 by Royal licence the additional surname of Maclean and in 1878 upon succeeding to the titles that of Douglas.

He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the fifth Marquess. He represented Stratford-on-Avon and Barnsley in Parliament as a Liberal and served as Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire. , the titles are held by his grandson, the seventh Marquess, who succeeded his father in 1978.

Northampton Institute, founded in 1894, was named after William Compton, 4th Marquess of Northampton and now it is City, University of London (formerly The City University).

===Other notable members of the Compton family===
Several other members of the Compton family have gained distinction. Henry Compton, sixth son of the second Earl of Northampton, was Bishop of London. Spencer Compton, 1st Earl of Wilmington, Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1742 to 1743, was the third son of the third Earl. Catherine Compton, daughter of the Hon. Charles Compton, third son of the fourth Earl, was created Baroness Arden in 1770. She was the wife of John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont, and the mother of another Prime Minister, Spencer Perceval. Lord Alwyne Compton, fourth son of the second Marquess, was Bishop of Ely. Lord Alwyne Compton, third son of the fourth Marquess, was a Unionist politician. He was the father of Captain Edward Robert Francis Compton. The latter married as his first wife Sylvia, daughter of Alexander Haldane Farquharson. Their son Alwyne Arthur Compton was officially recognised by warrant of the Lord Lyon in the surname of Farquharson of Invercauld and as Chief of Clan Farquharson in 1949.

===Estates===

The Compton family are major land owners. Their two major estates are Castle Ashby House in Northamptonshire and Compton Wynyates in Warwickshire. The family also owns land and property, including the 16th-century Canonbury Tower in Islington, north London, where many streets are named after names associated with the family. These include: Alwyne Road/Place/Villas/Square; Bingham Street; Compton Road/Terrace; Douglas Road; Northampton Road/Street/Square; Spencer Street; Percival (formerly Perceval) Street; and Wilmington Square.

<text>Marquess Camden is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1812 for the politician John Pratt, 2nd Earl Camden. The Pratt family descends from Sir John Pratt, Lord Chief Justice from 1718 to 1725. His third son from his second marriage, Sir Charles Pratt, was also a prominent lawyer and politician and served as Lord Chancellor between 1766 and 1770. In 1765 he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Camden, of Camden Place in the County of Kent, and in 1786 he was further honoured when he was created Viscount Bayham, of Bayham Abbey in the County of Kent, and Earl Camden. These titles are also in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Camden was married to Elizabeth, daughter of Nicholas Jeffreys, of The Priory, Brecknockshire, in Wales.

Their son, the second Earl, was a politician and notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and as Lord President of the Council. In 1812 he was created Earl of the County of Brecknock (usually shortened to Earl of Brecknock) and Marquess Camden. His son, the second Marquess, represented Ludgershall, Bath and Dunwich in the House of Commons and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Brecknockshire. In 1835 Lord Camden was called to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Camden. His son, the third Marquess, briefly sat as a Member of Parliament for Brecon in 1866, before he succeeded his father and took his seat in the House of Lords. On his early death, the titles passed to his three-month-old son, the fourth Marquess. He was notably Lord Lieutenant of Kent from 1905 to 1943. the peerages are held by his grandson, the sixth Marquess, who succeeded his father in 1983.

Lord Michael Pratt was a younger son of the fifth Marquess.

Camden Town in London is named after Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden, and the elephant from the arms of Marquess Camden is therefore present in the crest in the coat of arms of the London Borough of Camden.

The family seat is Wherwell House, near Andover, Hampshire. Until the early 1980s, the family also owned the Bayham Abbey Estate, near Lamberhurst, Kent.

<doc id="437357" wikidata="Q702049" url="?curid=437357" title="Husky Energy">
<text>Husky Energy Inc. was a Canadian company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration, headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It operated in Western and Atlantic Canada, the United States and the Asia Pacific region, with upstream and downstream business segments. In the 2020 Forbes Global 2000, Husky Energy was ranked as the 1443rd-largest public company in the world.

In January 2021, Husky was acquired by Cenovus Energy. Its retail operations were sold to Federated Co-operatives and Parkland Corporation later that year.

==History==

Husky Energy was founded in 1938 in Cody, Wyoming as the Husky Refining Company, with the acquisition by Glenn Nielsen of assets of the 4-year-old Park Refining Company from founder Valentine Monroe Kirk. The first refinery was in Cody, with a second constructed later in Riverton, Wyoming.

In 1946, the Company relocated to Canada, with the Riverton refinery moved to Lloydminster, Alberta to take advantage of the expanding asphalt and heavy oil opportunities in the area. A wholly-owned subsidiary, Husky Oil and Refining Ltd., was created and headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The Cody refinery continued operations well into the 1970s, producing primarily asphalt. The refinery was razed in the late 1990s.

In 1978–1979, amid a bidding war between Petro-Canada and Occidental Petroleum, controlling ownership of Husky was acquired by Alberta Gas Trunk Lines (which in 1980 became NOVA Corporation).

In 1986, Hong Kong-based Li Ka-shing acquired 43% of Husky, and in 1991 he purchased NOVA&#x27;s remaining interests, expanding his stake to 95%.

In 1998, Husky purchased Mohawk Oil, the largest independent chain of consumer filling stations in Western Canada.

In 2000, the company acquired Renaissance Energy, controlled by Li Ka-shing.

In 2003, it acquired the Canadian unit of the American-based Marathon Oil Corporation.

In November 2017, Husky acquired the a refinery in Superior, Wisconsin from Calumet Specialty Products Partners LP for $492 million.

In 2019, the company dropped a bid to acquire MEG Energy after failing to get shareholder support.

In 2020, Cenovus Energy offered to acquire Husky for $3.8 billion; Li would own 27.2% of the merged company. The acquisition was completed in January 2021.

===Incidents===
On April 26, 2018, Husky&#x27;s Superior, Wisconsin refinery experienced a series of explosions and fires, resulting in 11 injuries, one of which was critical. A mandatory evacuation was issued by the Mayor of Superior, Jim Paine, after the fire spread and caused multiple additional explosions, with Douglas County (of which Superior is the county seat) declaring a state of emergency. The black smoke resulting from the explosions and fire traveled as far south as Solon Springs, 22 miles south of the refinery.

==Operations==

Its offshore business includes the Asia Pacific and Atlantic regions. In Asia Pacific, Husky&#x27;s Liwan Gas Project in the South China Sea achieved first production in 2014. The liquids-rich BD field offshore of Indonesia came online in 2017, and the company is advancing additional shallow water fields.

Husky also has a portfolio of oil sands leases, encompassing some 2,500 square kilometres in the Fort McMurray region of northern Alberta. Its Sunrise Energy Project achieved first production in early 2015.

In the Atlantic region, off Canada&#x27;s East Coast, the company holds interests in 20 exploration licenses and producing properties at Terra Nova and White Rose. In the United States, the company owns a refinery in Lima, Ohio, a refinery in Superior, Wisconsin and holds a 50% ownership interest with BP in the BP-Husky Toledo Refinery in Oregon, Ohio.

===Assets and holdings===

At 2015 year-end, Husky Energy had total proved reserves before royalties of 1.3 billion boe and probable reserves of 1.6 billion boe. In 2015 its reserves replacement ratio was 166% (136% including economic factors), reflecting new additions from heavy oil thermal projects, the Sunrise Energy Project, the Liwan Gas Project and the company&#x27;s natural gas fields offshore Indonesia. It owns approximately 490 retail stations in Canada.

Husky is the operator of the White Rose field and a partner in the Terra Nova project in the Jeanne d&#x27;Arc Basin offshore Newfoundland. The White Rose field (located offshore Newfoundland in the Jeanne d&#x27;Arc Basin) includes two production wells at South White Rose that came online in 2015. Exploration work is underway at the Bay du Nord discovery area in the Flemish Pass, with partner Statoil.

Husky also owns a 40% interest in the Wenchang project offshore China, located near the mouth of the Pearl River. The remaining 60% of the project is owned by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). Husky is advancing the liquids-rich BD field offshore Indonesia, along with three additional shallow water fields.

Husky owns and operates the Lloydminster Heavy Oil Upgrader in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, the Asphalt Refinery in Lloydminster, Alberta, and the Superior Refinery in Superior, Wisconsin. Husky also operates the Husky Lloydminster Ethanol Plant and the Minnedosa Ethanol Plant.

Husky Energy&#x27;s operations are divided into two business segments: Upstream and Downstream.

The Upstream division focuses on oil and gas exploration and extraction. In addition to its existing producing assets and opportunities in Heavy Oil and Western Canada, the company has identified three pillars for growth: the Asia Pacific Region, the Oil Sands and the Atlantic Region.

Its Heavy Oil business include seven thermal developments in Saskatchewan.

The company&#x27;s Western Canada portfolio includes a focus on resource plays.

In the Asia Pacific Region, Husky&#x27;s Liwan Gas Project in the South China Sea began production in 2014. Husky is advancing the liquids-rich BD field offshore Indonesia, along with three additional shallow water fields.

Husky has a portfolio of oil sands leases, encompassing 2,500 square kilometres in the Fort McMurray region of northern Alberta. Its Sunrise Energy Project achieved first production in early 2015 and supports online applicants.

Husky is using steam-assisted gravity drainage technology at Sunrise, where bitumen is heated with steam to reduce its viscosity. When the liquid becomes more fluid, it is pumped to the surface and back to the central facility.

Husky has managed the terminal operations for Western Canada Select (WCS)—one of North America&#x27;s largest heavy crude oil streams— since it came on stream in 2004.

===Downstream===
The Lloydminster Upgrader, in Lloydminster, Alberta, converts heavy oil to a high-quality, low sulphur synthetic oil.

Husky&#x27;s asphalt refinery, in Lloydminster, Alberta, produces more than 30 different types and grades of road asphalt.

Husky&#x27;s Ethanol Plant in Minnedosa, Manitoba has been producing ethanol to be blended into gasoline since 1981. In 2007 it was expanded and produces about 130 million litres of ethanol per year.

The Husky Lloydminster Ethanol Plant came online in 2006 and produces 130 million litres of ethanol per year. In Canada ethanol is blended into gasoline. Feedstock for the plant is mainly non-food feed-grade wheat purchased locally. The plant can also produce Corn ethanol.

Like other Midwest refiners, Husky was revamping its Lima, Ohio refinery to process Western Canadian Select, (WCS) a heavier but less expensive crude oil. Since 2012 &quot;Lima has run over 60,000 bpd of Canadian crude, but only about 3,000 bpd of that would be particularly heavy with an API gravity below 30.&quot; In early January 2015, an explosion damaged the refinery&#x27;s 26,000-bpd isocracker unit. Later that year Husky announced that, given the low price of oil, it would postpone its US$300 million crude oil flexibility project. The project will process up to 40,000 bpd of WCS.

Husky and BP arranged a joint venture in 2008 in order to develop and process Alberta bitumen through which Husky acquired a 50% share in the 155,000-bpd BP-Husky Toledo Refinery in Oregon, Ohio and BP acquired a 50% share of the Husky-operated Sunrise field in Alberta. This refinery has been upgraded with a coker and is processing bitumen from Sunrise.

===Retail operations===
In December 2009, Husky acquired 98 Sunoco and Petro-Canada stations in Ontario as part of Suncor Energy&#x27;s acquisition of Petro-Canada.

In October 2015, Husky announced an agreement with Imperial Oil to combine its commercial cardlock network with Esso&#x27;s network. As part of the agreement, all Husky cardlock locations were rebranded as Esso cardlocks in 2017, and selected retail locations—including Husky&#x27;s travel centres—were converted to the Esso brand.

In January 2019, Husky stated that it was exploring the sale of its retail network and Prince George refinery. 

In December 2021, Cenovus announced its intent to sell 337 gas stations to Parkland Fuel and Federated Co-operatives, retaining the travel centres and commercial fuels business that operate under the Esso brand. Federated Co-operatives will transfer its locations to local members under the Co-op brand, or independent owners under the Tempo brand.

<doc id="437361" wikidata="Q3097335" url="?curid=437361" title="Marquess of Anglesey">
<text>Marquess of Anglesey is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1815 for Henry Paget, 2nd Earl of Uxbridge, a hero of the Battle of Waterloo, second in command to the Duke of Wellington. The Marquess holds the subsidiary titles of Earl of Uxbridge, in the County of Middlesex, in the Peerage of Great Britain (1784), Baron Paget, de Beaudesert, in the Peerage of England (1553). He is also an Irish Baronet, of Plas Newydd in the County of Anglesey and of Mount Bagenall in the County of Louth.

The 8th Marquess carried the standard of Wales at the 2023 Coronation.

The family seat now is Plas Newydd, at Llanddaniel Fab, Anglesey. Most recent marquesses are buried at St Edwen&#x27;s Church, Llanedwen, built and maintained by the Marquess. The former family seat was Beaudesert, near Cannock Chase, Staffordshire.

==Family history 1553–1815==

The Paget family descends from Sir William Paget, a close adviser to Henry VIII, who in 1553 was summoned to Parliament as Lord Paget de Beaudesert. His younger son, the third Baron, was a Catholic opponent of Elizabeth I. In 1589, he was attainted and his title forfeited. However, his son, the fourth Baron, was restored to the title in 1604. In contrast to his father, he was a prominent Protestant. He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Baron. He was Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire for the parliamentarians between 1641 and 1642, when he joined the Royalists and was dismissed. His son, the sixth Baron, was Ambassador to both Austria and the Ottoman Empire. On his death, the title passed to his son, the seventh Baron. He had already been created Baron Burton, of Burton-on-Trent in the County of Stafford, in 1711, prior to succeeding to the barony of Paget in 1713. In 1714 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Uxbridge, in the County of Middlesex. However, the earldom and barony of Burton became extinct on the death of his grandson, the second Earl (son of Thomas Catesby Paget, Lord Paget), in 1769.

The barony of Paget, which could be passed on through the female line, devolved on his cousin Henry Bayly, who became the ninth Baron. He was the son of Sir Nicholas Bayly, 2nd Baronet, of Plas Newydd, and Caroline, Lady Bayly (d. 1766), daughter of Thomas Paget and granddaughter of the Hon. Henry Paget, second son of William Paget, 5th Baron Paget. In 1770 Henry Bayly assumed the surname and arms of Paget only. Twelve years later, in 1782, he succeeded his father in the baronetcy, and in 1784 the earldom of Uxbridge was revived for him, when he was made Earl of Uxbridge, in the County of Middlesex. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was a prominent military commander who gained fame at the Battle of Waterloo, where he lost his leg. A few weeks after the battle he was made Marquess of Anglesey.

==Family history, 1815–present==

Lord Anglesey later held political office as Master-General of the Ordnance and Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. He was succeeded by his eldest son from his first marriage, the second Marquess. He served as Lord Chamberlain of the Household under Lord Melbourne between 1839 and 1841. His only son from his first marriage, the third Marquess, represented Staffordshire South in Parliament. He was childless and was succeeded by his half-brother, the fourth Marquess. He held the honorary post of vice-admiral of North Wales and West Carmarthen. His son, the fifth Marquess, became known for squandering his inheritance on a lavish social life and accumulating massive debts. In 1904 he was declared bankrupt. He died the following year aged only 29 and was succeeded by his cousin, the sixth Marquess. He was the son of Lord Alexander Paget, third son of the second Marquess. He was a soldier and courtier. He was succeeded by his only son, the seventh Marquess, who succeeded in 1947 and who was an author and historian. The seventh Marquess died in 2013 and was succeeded by his son Charles Alexander Vaughan Paget, 8th Marquess of Anglesey (born 13 November 1950). He was educated at Eton and Exeter College, Oxford (graduating M.A.), and at the University of Sussex (D.Phil.) His mother is the writer Shirley Paget, Marchioness of Anglesey, née Morgan. In 1986 he married Georgeanne Elizabeth Elliott Downes; they were divorced in 2011. They have a son, Benedict Dashiell Thomas Paget, Earl of Uxbridge, born 1986, the heir apparent, and a daughter, Clara Paget, born 1988, who is a model and actress. On 13 June 2015, the 8th Marquess married secondly in Mayfair Susan Blanche Louise de Paolis (née Sigmund), formerly wife of Pietro de Paolis.

==Bayly, later Paget Baronetcy==

The Bayly, later Paget Baronetcy, of Plas Newydd in the County of Anglesey and of Mount Bagenall in the County of Louth, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland in 1730 for Edward Bayly, who had previously represented Newry in the Irish House of Commons. In 1712 he inherited substantial estates on Anglesey, including Plas Newydd, still the family&#x27;s main residence, from a cousin, Nicholas Bagenall. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet. He represented Anglesey in the British House of Commons. His son was the aforementioned third Baronet, who had already succeeded as ninth Baron Paget and was created Earl of Uxbridge in 1784.

Note: The Baronetcy has remained unclaimed since the death, in 2013, of the 7th Marquess (16th Baronet).

==Other family members==

Numerous other members of the Bayly and Paget families have gained distinction. Charles Paget, youngest son of the first Baron, was a Roman Catholic conspirator.

The first earl of the 1784 creation was especially prolific in notable offspring. His second son, William Paget, was a captain in the Royal Navy and a Member of Parliament. His third son, Sir Arthur Paget, was a diplomat and politician. (His son Sir Augustus Berkeley Paget was a diplomat. His second son Sir Ralph Paget was also a diplomat. Arthur Paget (1839–1924), son of Stewart Paget, eldest son of Sir Arthur Paget, was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy.)

The first earl&#x27;s fourth son, Sir Edward Paget, was a general in the Army. His fifth son, Sir Charles Paget, was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy. His sixth son, Berkeley Paget, sat as a Member of Parliament for Anglesey and Milborne Port. (He was the father of 1) Frederick Paget, Member of Parliament for Beaumaris, and 2) Leopold Paget, a colonel in the Royal Artillery, whose son Wellesley Paget became a major-general in the Royal Artillery.)

The first marquess also had several notable descendants. His second son, Lord William Paget, was a naval commander and politician. His fourth son, Lord Clarence Paget, was a naval commander, politician and sculptor. His fifth son, Lord Alfred Paget, was a soldier, politician and courtier. (He was the father of (1) Sir Arthur Paget, a general in the Army; (2) Sydney Paget, a racehorse owner; and (3) Almeric Paget, a politician who was created Baron Queenborough in 1918 and who was the father of Dorothy Paget, a racehorse owner, and Olive Paget, a landowner and hostess.) His sixth son, Lord George Paget, was a general in the Army. Lord Alfred Paget is a descendant, and he was a prominent courtier and politician during the reign of Queen Victoria.

Lady Adelaide Paget (1820–1890), daughter of the first marquess, as Lady Adelaide Cadogan, was a prodigious author, most noted for her seminal work on plays and card games.

Lady Caroline Paget (1913–1973), daughter of the sixth marquess, was a socialite and actress. Her sister Lady Rose Paget was also a socialite.

Lady Clara Paget (born 1988), daughter of the eighth marquess, is an actress and model well known for her role in the TV series &quot;Black Sails&quot;.

Lewis Bayly (died 1631), grandfather of the first baronet, was Bishop of Bangor. His son Nicholas Bayly, father of the first baronet, was a member of the Irish House of Commons for Newry. The Very Reverend Edward Bayly, younger son of the first baronet, was Archdeacon of Dublin. Lambert Bayly, younger son of the first baronet, was the father of the Very Reverend John Bayly, Dean of Killaloe, who was the grandfather of (1) Paget Bayly, a major-general in the Army, and (2) John Bayly, a general in the Army. Charles Bayly, younger son of the first baronet, was a captain in the Royal Navy. Paget Bayly, younger son of the second baronet, was also a captain in the Royal Navy. Nicholas Bayly, younger son of the second baronet, was Member of Parliament for Anglesey.

In 1727, the town of Uxbridge, in the Massachusetts Colony, was named after the Earl of Uxbridge.

<text>Petro-Canada (colloquially known as Petro-Can) is a retail and wholesale marketing brand subsidiary of Suncor Energy. Until 1991, it was a federal Crown corporation (a state-owned enterprise). In August 2009, Petro-Canada merged with Suncor Energy, with Suncor shareholders receiving approximately 60 percent ownership of the combined company and Petro-Canada shareholders receiving approximately 40 percent. The company retained the Suncor Energy name for the merged corporation and its upstream operations. It continues to use the Petro-Canada name nationwide.

==History==
===Founding===
In 1973, world oil prices quadrupled due to the Arab oil embargo following the Yom Kippur War. The province of Alberta had substantial oil reserves, whose extraction had long been controlled by American corporations. The government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the opposition New Democratic Party felt that these corporations geared most of their production to the American market, and as a result little of the benefit of rising oil prices went to Canadians. During debates in the Canadian House of Commons, for example, Tommy Douglas supported the new Crown Corporation by saying: &quot;It should be remembered that the people of Canada have paid billions of dollars to enlarge and enrich foreign oil companies, and only now, belatedly, are we setting up an economic vehicle to develop our petroleum resources for the benefit of Canadians.&quot;

Trudeau&#x27;s Liberals were then in a minority government and dependent upon the support of the NDP to stay in power. The idea also fit with the growing movement toward economic nationalism within the Liberals. The Liberals and NDP passed the bill over the opposition of the Progressive Conservative Party led by Robert Stanfield.

===Crown Corporation (1975–1991)===
Petro-Canada was founded as a Crown Corporation in 1975 by an act of Parliament. It started its operations on 1 January 1976. The company was given C$1.5 billion in start-up money and easy access to new sources of capital. It was set up in Calgary, despite the hostility of existing oil firms. Its first president was Maurice Strong. The Progressive Conservatives (PCs), then led by Albertan Joe Clark, were opponents of the company, and advocated breaking it up and selling it. However, they were unable to proceed with these plans during their brief time in power in 1979–80.

With the establishment of Petro-Canada, the federal government transferred its 45% stake in Panarctic Oils Ltd. and its 12% stake in Syncrude to the newly established company. In 1976, Petro-Canada purchased Atlantic Richfield Canada, in 1978 Pacific Petroleums, and in 1981 the Canadian operations of Petrofina. Most of the original Petro-Canada refineries and service stations were acquired from BP Canada in 1983.

The company became popular outside of Alberta as a symbol of Canadian nationalism. It quickly grew to become one of the largest players in the traditional oil fields of the west as well as in the oil sands and the East coast offshore oil fields.

When the Liberals returned to power in 1980, energy policy was an important focus, and the sweeping National Energy Program was created. This expanded Petro-Canada, but was seen as detrimental to Alberta&#x27;s economy. The PC government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney (1984–1993) stopped using Petro-Canada as a policy tool (also abandoning the National Energy Program with it), and it began to compete fully and successfully with the private sector companies while abandoning its founding principles of economic nationalism.

===Private, Independent Company (1991–2009)===
In 1990, the Mulroney government announced its intention to privatize Petro-Canada, and the first shares were sold on the open market in July 1991 at $13 each. The government began to slowly sell its majority control, but kept a 19% stake in the company. No other shareholder was allowed to own more than 10%, however. Also, foreigners could not control more than 25% of the company.

During the first year, the value of the shares gradually dropped to $8 as Petro-Canada suffered a loss of $603 million, primarily because of the devaluation of some assets. The newly private company significantly reduced the number of properties in which it had a direct interest. It reduced its annual operating costs by $300 million and it went from a staff of close to 11,000 to only about 5,000 employees. Many of these laid-off employees went on to work and start up other oil companies in Alberta, creating a new group of Canadian producers. But many did not work in other oil companies and some left Alberta to find work elsewhere.

In his 2004 federal budget, Finance Minister Ralph Goodale pledged to sell the government&#x27;s remaining stake in the company; by the end of the year it had sold its 19% stake, 49 million shares in all, for net proceeds of $3.2 billion. As of June 2007, the company&#x27;s largest shareholders were Capital Research and Management Company (a Capital Group company), with 7.3%, and Barclays, with 4%.

===Subsidiary of Suncor (2009–present)===

On March 23, 2009, Suncor Energy announced its intent to acquire Petro-Canada, which would form a company with a combined market capitalization of C$43.3 billion. Suncor planned to rebrand its existing Sunoco-branded retail operations in Ontario under the Petro-Canada name following the completion of the acquisition.

The sale was approved by shareholders in June 2009, and completed on August 1, 2009. As a condition of the purchase, Suncor was required to divest some of its retail outlets. In December 2009, 98 Suncor-owned gas stations in Ontario (68 Sunoco and 30 Petro-Canada) were sold to Husky Energy.

==Operations==

As of 2008, Petro-Canada was Canada&#x27;s 11th largest company and the second-largest downstream company, with important interests in such projects as Hibernia, Terra Nova, and White Rose; its gas stations remained a presence in most Canadian cities. It owned refineries in Edmonton, Alberta (135,000 bpd) and Montreal, Quebec (160,000 bpd), accounting for 16% of the Canadian industry&#x27;s total refining capacity. All these facilities are currently run by Suncor.

Petro-Canada had a lubricants plant in Mississauga, Ontario, but Suncor sold the unit to HollyFrontier in late 2016.

At one time, the company had international operations in Algeria, the Netherlands, Tunisia, the United Kingdom, Syria, Italy, Libya, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela, Morocco and Norway. These sites outside of North America were run by the International and Offshore Business Unit of Petro-Canada with its headquarters in London. This was the largest business unit, and much of its assets were part of the former Veba Oel company based in Essen, Germany.

In January 2019, Petro-Canada installed electric vehicle charging stations at one of their gas stations in Milton, Ontario, making it the company&#x27;s first EV chargers. The following month, Suncor announced that it would develop a national network of charging stations serving the Trans-Canada Highway.

As early as the mid-1990s in some Alberta locations, Petro-Canada started opening a new fast-food deli-oriented branded convenience store called Neighbours. Most of these stores are in the GTA. The kitchen provided freshly made sandwiches as well as breakfast and burgers heated from frozen, and in most cases was open from early morning till 9 or 10 in the evening. As of 2013, many of these Neighbours stores have had their kitchens&#x27; afternoon and dinner hours drastically slashed and some have been permanently closed and are being rebranded to A&amp;W.

In 2006, Petro-Canada launched a pre-paid wireless carrier known as Petro-Canada Mobility. It is a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) on the Rogers Wireless network.

&quot;Petro Points&quot; is the chain&#x27;s loyalty program. Petro-Canada previously offered a co-branded Petro Points MasterCard in partnership with Citibank Canada. In June 2010, CIBC announced its intent to acquire Citibank&#x27;s Canadian MasterCard portfolio, including the co-branded Petro-Canada cards. Petro Points currently offers bonuses for RBC clients.

Around 220 Petro-Canada outlets include a &quot;SuperWash&quot; car wash; the majority of these operations use soft touch systems, but some (particularly those that were formerly Sunoco stations) feature touchless equipment instead. Some newer locations feature a &quot;Glide Auto Wash&quot;—a soft touch tunnel that utilizes a flat conveyor belt rather than the roller-based systems traditionally used.

In May 2023, Suncor announced an agreement with Canadian Tire Corporation to convert its over 200 Canadian Tire Gas+ locations to Petro-Canada. This will include integration of Petro Points with Canadian Tire&#x27;s Triangle Rewards program.

<doc id="437373" wikidata="Q298403" url="?curid=437373" title="Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz">
<text>Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan (; February 720) was the eighth Umayyad caliph, ruling from 717 until his death in 720. He is credited to have instituted significant reforms to the Umayyad central government, by making it much more efficient and egalitarian. His rulership is marked by the first official collection of hadiths and the mandated universal education to the populace.

He dispatched emissaries to China and Tibet, inviting their rulers to accept Islam. It was during his three-year reign that Islam was accepted by huge segments of the populations of Persia and Egypt. He also ordered the withdrawal of the Muslim forces in various fronts such as in Constantinople, Central Asia and Septimania. However despite this, his reign witnessed the Umayyads gaining many new territories in the Iberian Peninsula.

Umar was considered by many to be the first &quot;mujaddid&quot; and the fifth righteous caliph of Islam after Ali and Hasan ibn Ali&#x27;s caliphate is considered with the caliphate of his father Ali because of a Hadith according to some Sunni scholars. He was honorifically called (Umar II) after his maternal great-grandfather, Caliph Umar ().

==Early life==
Umar was likely born in Medina around 680. His father, Abd al-Aziz ibn Marwan, belonged to the wealthy Umayyad clan resident in the city, while his mother, Layla bint Asim, was a granddaughter of the second Rashidun caliph Umar (). His lineage from the much-respected Caliph Umar would later be much emphasized by historians to differentiate him from the other Umayyad rulers.

At the time of his birth, another branch of the Umayyads, the Sufyanids, ruled from their capital Damascus. When the reigning Caliph Yazid I () and his son and successor, Mu&#x27;awiya II (), died in quick succession in 683 and 684, respectively, Umayyad authority collapsed across the Caliphate and the Umayyads of the Hejaz, including Medina, were expelled by supporters of the rival caliph, the Mecca-based Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr (). The Umayyad exiles took refuge in Syria, where loyalist Arab tribes supported the dynasty. Umar&#x27;s grandfather, Marwan I (), was ultimately recognized by these tribes as caliph and, with their support, reasserted Umayyad rule in Syria.

In 685, Marwan ousted Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s governor from Egypt and appointed Umar&#x27;s father to the province. Umar spent part of his childhood in Egypt, particularly in Hulwan, which had become the seat of his father&#x27;s governorship between 686 and his death in 705. He received his education in Medina, however, which was retaken by the Umayyads under Umar&#x27;s paternal uncle, Caliph Abd al-Malik (), in 692. Having spent much of his youth in Medina, Umar developed ties with the city&#x27;s pious men and transmitters of hadiths. Following the death of Umar&#x27;s father, Abd al-Malik recalled Umar to Damascus, where he arranged Umar&#x27;s marriage to his daughter, Fatima. Umar had two other wives: his maternal cousin Umm Shu&#x27;ayb or Umm Uthman, the daughter of Shu&#x27;ayb or Sa&#x27;id ibn Zabban of the Banu Kalb tribe, and Lamis bint Ali of the Balharith. From his wives he had seven known children, as well as seven other children from concubines.

==Governor of Medina==
Shortly after his accession, Abd al-Malik&#x27;s son and successor, al-Walid I (), appointed Umar governor of Medina. According to Julius Wellhausen, al-Walid&#x27;s intention was to use Umar to reconcile the townspeople of Medina to Umayyad rule and &quot; the evil memory&quot; of the preceding Umayyad governors, namely Hisham ibn Isma&#x27;il al-Makhzumi, whose rule over Medina had been harsh for its inhabitants. Umar took up the post in February/March 706 and his jurisdiction later extended to Mecca and Ta&#x27;if.

Information about his governorship is scant, but most traditional accounts note that he was a &quot;just governor&quot;, according to historian Paul Cobb. He often led the annual Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca and showed favor toward the Islamic legal scholars of Medina, notably Sa&#x27;id ibn al-Musayyab. Umar tolerated many of these scholars&#x27; open criticism of the Umayyad government&#x27;s conduct. However, other accounts hold that he showed himself to be materialistic during his early career. On al-Walid&#x27;s orders, Umar undertook the reconstruction and expansion of the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque in Medina beginning in 707. Under Umar&#x27;s generally lenient rule, the Hejaz became a refuge for Iraqi political and religious exiles fleeing the persecutions of al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, al-Walid&#x27;s powerful viceroy over the eastern half of the Caliphate. According to Cobb, this served as Umar&#x27;s &quot;undoing&quot; as al-Hajjaj pressured the caliph to dismiss Umar in May/June 712.

==Courtier of al-Walid and Sulayman==
Despite his dismissal, Umar remained in al-Walid&#x27;s favor, being the brother of the caliph&#x27;s first wife, Umm al-Banin bint Abd al-Aziz. He remained in al-Walid&#x27;s court in Damascus until the caliph&#x27;s death in 715, and according to the 9th-century historian al-Ya&#x27;qubi, he performed the funeral prayers for al-Walid. The latter&#x27;s brother and successor, Sulayman (), held Umar in high regard. Alongside Raja ibn Haywa, an influential religious figure in the Umayyads&#x27; court, Umar served as a principal adviser of Sulayman. He accompanied the latter when he led the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 716 and on his return to Jerusalem. Likewise, he was at the caliph&#x27;s side at the Muslims&#x27; marshaling camp at Dabiq in northern Syria, where Sulayman directed the massive war effort to conquer the Byzantine capital of Constantinople in 717.

==Caliphate==
===Accession===
According to the traditional Muslim sources, when Sulayman was on his deathbed in Dabiq, he was persuaded by Raja to designate Umar as his successor. Sulayman&#x27;s son Ayyub had been his initial nominee, but predeceased him, while his other sons were either too young or away fighting on the Byzantine front. The nomination of Umar voided the wishes of Abd al-Malik, who sought to restrict the office to his direct descendants. The elevation of Umar, a member of a cadet branch of the dynasty, in preference to the numerous descendants of Abd al-Malik surprised these princes. According to Wellhausen, &quot;nobody dreamed of this, himself [Umar] least of all&quot;. Raja managed the affair, calling the Umayyad princes into Dabiq&#x27;s mosque and demanding that they recognize Sulayman&#x27;s will, which Raja had kept secret. Only after the Umayyads accepted did Raja reveal that Umar was the caliph&#x27;s nominee. Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik voiced his opposition, but relented after being threatened with violence. A potential intra-dynastic conflict was averted with the designation of a son of Abd al-Malik, Yazid II, as Umar&#x27;s successor.

According to the historian Reinhard Eisener, Raja&#x27;s role in the affair was likely &quot;exaggerated&quot;; &quot;more reasonable&quot; was that Umar&#x27;s succession was the result of &quot;traditional patterns, like seniority and well-founded claims&quot; stemming from Caliph Marwan I&#x27;s original designation of Umar&#x27;s father, Abd al-Aziz, as Abd al-Malik&#x27;s successor, which had not materialized due to Abd al-Aziz predeceasing Abd al-Malik. Umar acceded without significant opposition on 22 September 717.

===Reforms===
The most significant reform of Umar was effecting the equality of Arabs and &quot;mawali&quot; (non-Arab Muslims). This was mainly relevant to the non-Arab troops in the Muslim army, who had not been entitled to the same shares in spoils, lands and salaries given to Arab soldiers. The policy also applied to Muslim society at large. Under previous Umayyad rulers, Arab Muslims had certain financial privileges over non-Arab Muslims. Non-Arab converts to Islam were still expected to pay the jizya (poll tax) that they paid before becoming Muslims. Umar put into practice a new system that exempted all Muslims, regardless of their heritage, from the jizya tax. He also added some safeguards to the system to make sure that mass conversion to Islam would not cause the collapse of the finances of the Umayyad government. Under the new tax policy, converted &quot;mawali&quot; would not pay the jizya (or any other &quot;dhimmi&quot; tax), but upon conversion, their land would become the property of their villages and would thus remain liable to the full rate of the &quot;kharaj&quot; (land tax). This compensated for the loss of income due to the diminished jizya tax base.
He issued an edict on taxation stating: 
Whosoever accepts Islam, whether Christian, Jew or Zoroastrian, of those now subject to taxes and who joins himself to the body of the Muslims in their abode, forsaking the abode in which he was before, he shall have the same rights and duties as they have, and they are obliged to associate with him and to treat him as one of themselves.

Possibly to stave off potential blowback from opponents of the equalization measures, Umar expanded the Islamization drive that had been steadily strengthening under his Marwanid predecessors. The drive included measures to distinguish Muslims from non-Muslims and the inauguration of an Islamic iconoclasm. According to Khalid Yahya Blankinship, he put a stop to the ritual cursing of Caliph Ali (), the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, in Friday prayer sermons.

Umar is credited with having ordered the first official collection of hadith (sayings and actions attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad), fearing that some of it might be lost.

===Provincial administrations===
Shortly after his accession, Umar overhauled the administrations of the provinces. He appointed competent men that he could control, indicating his intention &quot;to keep a close eye on provincial administration&quot;. Wellhausen noted that the caliph did not leave the governors to their own devices in return for their forwarding of the provincial revenues; rather, he actively oversaw his governors&#x27; administrations and his main interest was &quot;not so much the increase of power as the establishment of right&quot;.

He subdivided the vast governorship established over Iraq and the eastern Caliphate under Abd al-Malik&#x27;s viceroy al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf. Sulayman&#x27;s appointee to this super-province, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, was dismissed and imprisoned by Umar for failing to forward the spoils from his earlier conquest of Tabaristan along the southern Caspian coast to the caliphal treasury. In place of Ibn al-Muhallab, he appointed Abd al-Hamid ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn al-Khattab, a member of Caliph Umar I&#x27;s family, to Kufa, Adi ibn Artah al-Fazari to Basra, al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami to Khurasan and Amr ibn Muslim al-Bahili, a brother of the conqueror Qutayba ibn Muslim, to Sind. He appointed Umar ibn Hubayra al-Fazari to the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia). Although many of these appointees were pupils of al-Hajjaj or affiliated with the Qays faction, Umar chose them based on their reliability and integrity, rather than opposition to Sulayman&#x27;s government.

Umar appointed al-Samh ibn Malik al-Khawlani to al-Andalus (Iberian Peninsula) and Isma&#x27;il ibn Abd Allah to Ifriqiya. He chose these governors because of their perceived neutrality in the tribal factionalism between the Qays and Yaman and justice toward the oppressed.

===Military policy===
After his accession in late 717, Umar ordered the withdrawal of the Muslim army led by his cousin Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik from their abortive siege against Constantinople to the regions of Antioch and Malatya, closer to the Syrian frontier. He commissioned an expedition in the summer of 718 to facilitate their withdrawal. Umar kept up the annual summer raids against the Byzantine frontier, out of the obligation to jihad. He remained in northern Syria, often residing at his estate in Khunasira, where he built a fortified headquarters.

At some point in 717, he dispatched a force under Ibn Hatim ibn al-Nu&#x27;man al-Bahili to Adharbayjan to disperse a group of Turks who had launched damaging raids against the province. In 718, he successively deployed Iraqi and Syrian troops to suppress the Kharijite rebellion of Shawdhab al-Yashkuri in Iraq, though some sources say the revolt was settled diplomatically.

Umar is often deemed a pacifist by the sources and Cobb attributes the caliph&#x27;s war-weariness to concerns over the diminishing funds of the caliphal treasury. Wellhausen asserts that Umar was &quot;disinclined to wars of conquest, well-knowing that they were waged, not for God, but for the sake of spoil&quot;. Blankinship considers this reasoning to be &quot;insufficient&quot;. He proposed it was the massive losses faced by the Arabs in their abortive siege against Constantinople, including the destruction of their navy, that caused Umar to view his positions in al-Andalus, separated by the rest of the Caliphate by sea, and Cilicia as acutely vulnerable to Byzantine attack. Thus he favored withdrawing Muslim forces from these two regions. This same calculus led to him to consider withdrawing Muslim forces from Transoxiana so as to shore up the defenses of Syria. Shaban views Umar&#x27;s efforts to curb offensives as linked to the resentment of the Yamani elements of the army, who Shaban views to have been politically dominant under Umar, at excessive deployments in the field.
Although he halted further eastward expansion, the establishment of Islam in a number of cities in Transoxiana precluded Umar&#x27;s withdrawal of Arab troops from there. During his reign, the Muslim forces in al-Andalus conquered and fortified the Mediterranean coastal city of Narbonne in modern-day France.

==Death==
On his way back from Damascus to Aleppo or possibly to his Khunasira estate, Umar fell ill. He died between 5 February and 10 February 720, at the age of 39, in the village of Dayr Sim&#x27;an (also called Dayr al-Naqira) near Ma&#x27;arrat Nu&#x27;man. Umar had purchased a plot there with his own funds and was buried in the village, where the ruins of his tomb, built at an unknown date, are still visible. Umar was succeeded by Yazid II.

==Assessment and legacy==
The unanimous view in the Muslim traditional sources is that Umar was pious and ruled like a true Muslim in singular opposition to the other Umayyad caliphs, who were generally considered &quot;godless usurpers, tyrants and playboys&quot;. The tradition recognized Umar as an authentic caliph, while the other Umayyads were viewed as kings. In the view of Gerald Hawting, this is partly based on the historical facts and Umar&#x27;s character and actions. He holds that Umar &quot;truly as all evidence indicates was a man of honour, dignity and a ruler worthy of every respect&quot;. As a result of this and his short term in office, it is difficult to assess the achievements of his caliphate and his motives. Indeed, Kennedy calls Umar &quot;the most puzzling character among the Marwanid rulers&quot;. As Kennedy states &quot;He was a pious individual who attempted to solve the problems of his day in a way which would reconcile the needs of his dynasty and state with the demands of Islam&quot;. In the assessment of H. A. R. Gibb, Umar acted to prevent the collapse of the caliphate by &quot;maintaining the unity of the Arabs; removing the grievances of the &quot;mawālī&quot;; and reconciling political life with the claims of religion.&quot;

<text>Marquess of Cholmondeley ( ) is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1815 for George Cholmondeley, 4th Earl of Cholmondeley.

== History ==
The Cholmondeley family descends from William le Belward (or de Belward), the feudal lord of the barony of Malpas in Cheshire who acquired the lordship of &quot;Calmundelai&quot; (as it was spelt in the Domesday Book) through his wife Beatrix, daughter of Hugh de Kevelioc, 5th Earl of Chester. Their eldest son David le Belward inherited the feudal barony of Malpas and was the ancestor of the Egerton family. The second son, Robert le Belward, became feudal lord of the barony of Cholmondeley, which he passed to his son Sir Hugh de Cholmondeley (or &quot;Chelmundeleih&quot;), who adopted the new surname.

His lineal descendant was Sir Hugh Cholmondeley (1513–1596), knighted by King Henry VIII. His eldest son was Robert Cholmondeley, 1st Earl of Leinster, while his youngest son Thomas was the ancestor of the Barons Delamere. Another son, his namesake Hugh, was the father of Robert Cholmondeley. He succeeded to the estates of his uncle Lord Leinster and was created Viscount Cholmondeley, of Kells in the County of Meath, in the Peerage of Ireland in 1661. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Viscount. He was a supporter of King William III and Queen Mary II and also served as Comptroller of the Household and as Treasurer of the Household. In 1689 he was created Baron Cholmondeley, of Nantwich in the County of Chester, in the Peerage of England, with remainder to his younger brother George Cholmondeley. In 1706 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Malpas, in the County of Chester, and Earl of Cholmondeley, in the County of Chester, also in the Peerage of England and with the same special remainders.

Lord Cholmondeley never married and was succeeded according to the special remainders (and according to the normal descent in the viscountcy of Cholmondeley) by his younger brother George, the second Earl. He was a prominent military commander and commanded the Horse Guards at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. In 1715, ten years before he succeeded his elder brother, he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland in his own right as Baron Newborough, of Newborough in the County of Wexford, and in 1716 he was made Baron Newburgh, in the Isle of Anglesey, in the Peerage of Great Britain. On his death the titles passed to his son, the third Earl. He was a politician and held office as Lord Privy Seal and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

He was succeeded by his grandson, the fourth Earl. He was the son of George Cholmondeley, Viscount Malpas. Lord Cholmondeley was also a prominent politician and served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard and as Lord Steward of the Household. In 1815 he was created Earl of Rocksavage, in the County of Chester, and Marquess of Cholmondeley, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Marquess. He represented Castle Rising in the House of Commons but in 1821 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Newburgh. Lord Cholmondeley was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Marquess. He sat as Member of Parliament for Castle Rising and South Hampshire. As he outlived most of his children, including the elder son, the third Marquess was succeeded in his titles by his grandson. , the titles are held by his great-great-great-grandson, the seventh Marquess, who succeeded his father in 1990.

The courtesy title of the Marquess&#x27;s heir is &quot;Earl of Rocksavage&quot;, while Lord Rocksavage&#x27;s eldest son is known as &quot;Viscount Malpas&quot;. 

The family seats are Houghton Hall, Norfolk, and Cholmondeley Castle, which is surrounded by a estate near Malpas, Cheshire.

==Lord Great Chamberlain==
A part of the office of Lord Great Chamberlain came into the Cholmondeley family through the marriage of the first Marquess of Cholmondeley to Lady Georgiana Charlotte Bertie, daughter of Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. The second, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh holders of the marquessate have all held this office. As Lord Great Chamberlain, the present Marquess was, during the reign of Elizabeth II, along with the Duke of Norfolk (the Earl Marshal), one of only two hereditary peers to retain automatic seats in the House of Lords after the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999. 
==Cholmondeley Room==
Peers in the House of Lords can hold their 70th birthday parties in the Cholmondeley Room at the Palace of Westminster. Among other uses, Baroness Elliot of Harwood organised a dinner in 1984 for all female Conservative members of Parliament and peers, and this event was held in this venue. The Cholmondeley Room and Terrace and the Attlee Room are available for private functions, sponsored by Members for personal use or for external organisations.

<text>The Rashidun () are the first four caliphs () who led the Muslim community following the death of Muhammad: Abu Bakr (), Umar (), Uthman (), and Ali ().

The reign of these caliphs, called the Rashidun Caliphate (632–661), is considered in Sunni Islam to have been &#x27;rightly guided&#x27; (Arabic: ), meaning that it constitutes a model () to be followed and emulated from a religious point of view.

==History==
The first four caliphs who succeeded Muhammad are known as the Rashidun (rightly-guided) Caliphs. 
# Abu Bakr (; ) 
# Umar ibn al-Khattab (; ) – often known simply as Umar or Omar
# Uthman ibn Affan (; ) – often known simply as Uthman, Othman, or Osman
# Ali ibn Abi Talib (; ) – often known simply as Ali
The succession to Muhammad is the central issue that divides the Muslim community. Sunni Islam, according to the author Carl Ernst, accepts the political status quo of their succession, regardless of its justice, whereas Shia Muslims largely reject the legitimacy of the first three caliphs, and maintain that Muhammad had appointed Ali as his successor.

===Abu Bakr===

Abu Bakr, (), c. 573 CE unknown exact date 634/13 AH) was a senior companion of Muhammad (&quot;sahabah&quot;) and his father-in-law. He ruled over the Rashidun Caliphate from 632 to 634 CE when he became the first Muslim Caliph following Muhammad&#x27;s death. As caliph, Abu Bakr continued the political and administrative functions previously exercised by Muhammad. Abu Bakr was called &quot;As-Siddiq&quot; (, &quot;The Truthful&quot;), and was known by that title among later generations of Sunni Muslims. He prevented the recently converted Muslims from dispersing, kept the community united, and consolidated Islamic grip on the region by containing the Ridda, while extending the Dar Al Islam all the way to the Red Sea.

===Umar===
Umar ibn al-Khattab (, c. 586–590 – 644) c. 2 November (Dhu al-Hijjah 26, 23 Hijri) was a leading companion and adviser to Muhammad. His daughter Hafsa bint Umar was married to Muhammad; thus he became Muhammad&#x27;s father-in-law. He became the second Muslim caliph after Muhammad&#x27;s death and ruled for 10 years. He succeeded Abu Bakr on 23 August 634 as the second caliph, and played a significant role in Islam. Under Umar the Islamic empire expanded at an unprecedented rate, ruling the whole Sassanid Persian Empire and more than two thirds of the Eastern Roman Empire. His legislative abilities, firm political and administrative control over a rapidly expanding empire, and brilliantly coordinated multi-prong attacks against the Sassanid Persian Empire resulted in the conquest of the Persian empire in less than two years. This marked his reputation as a great political and military leader. Among his conquests are Jerusalem, Damascus, and Egypt. He was killed in 644 by a Persian captive named Abu Lu&#x27;lu&#x27;a Firuz.

===Uthman===
Uthman ibn Affan () (c. 579 – 17 June 656) was one of the early companions and son in law of Muhammad. Two of Muhammad and Khadija daughters Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthum were married to him one after another. Uthman was born into the Umayyad clan of Mecca, a powerful family of the Quraysh tribe. He became caliph at the age of 70. Under his leadership, the empire expanded into Fars (present-day Iran) in 650 and some areas of Khorasan (present-day Afghanistan) in 651, and the conquest of Armenia was begun in the 640s. His rule ended when he was assassinated.

Uthman is perhaps best known for forming the committee which was tasked with producing copies of the Quran based on text that had been gathered separately on parchment, bones and rocks during the lifetime of Muhammad and also on a copy of the Quran that had been collated by Abu Bakr and left with Muhammad&#x27;s widow after Abu Bakr&#x27;s death. The committee members were also reciters of the Quran and had memorised the entire text during the lifetime of Muhammad. This work was undertaken due to the vast expansion of Islam under Uthman&#x27;s rule, which encountered many different dialects and languages. This had led to variant readings of the Quran for those converts who were not familiar with the language. After clarifying any possible errors in pronunciation or dialects, Uthman sent copies of the sacred text to each of the Muslim cities and garrison towns, and destroyed variant texts.

===Ali===
Ali ibn Abi Talib () was Muhammad&#x27;s cousin and son-in-law. In Mecca, a young Ali was the first male to embrace Islam and the person who offered his support when Muhammad first presented Islam to his relatives. Later, he facilitated Muhammad&#x27;s safe escape to Medina by risking his life as the decoy. In Medina, Ali swore a pact of brotherhood with Muhammad and later took the hand of Muhammad&#x27;s daughter, Fatimah, in marriage. Ali commonly acted as Muhammad&#x27;s secretary in Medina, and served as his deputy during the expedition of Tabuk. Ali is often considered the most able warrior in Muhammad&#x27;s army and the two were the only Muslim men who represented Islam against a Christian delegation from Najran. Ali&#x27;s role in the collection of the Quran, the central text of Islam, is deemed as one of his key contributions. In Shia Islam, Ali is considered the rightful successor of Muhammad whose appointment was announced at the event of Ghadir Khumm and earlier in his prophetic mission.

Shortly after Uthman&#x27;s assassination in Medina, the crowds turned to Ali for leadership and were turned down initially. The explanation of Will Durant for Ali&#x27;s initial reluctance is that, &quot;Genial and charitable, meditative and reserved; he [Ali] shrank from drama in which religion had been displaced by politics, and devotion by intrigue.&quot; In the absence of any serious opposition and urged particularly by the Ansar and the Iraqi delegations, Ali eventually took up the mantle on 25th of Dhu al-Hijjah, 656 CE, and Muslims filled the Prophet&#x27;s Mosque and its courtyard to pledge their allegiance to him.

It has been suggested that Ali inherited the grave internal problems of Uthman&#x27;s reign. After his appointment as the caliph, Ali transferred his capital from Medina to Kufa, the Muslim garrison city in the present-day Iraq. Ali also dismissed most of Uthman&#x27;s governors whom he considered corrupt, including Muawiya, Uthman&#x27;s cousin. Under a lenient Uthman, Muawiya had built a parallel power structure in Damascus that, according to Madelung, mirrored the despotism of the Roman Byzantine empire. Muawiya defied Ali&#x27;s orders and, once the negotiations failed, the two sides engaged in a bloody and lengthy civil war, which is known as the First Fitnah.

After Ali&#x27;s assassination in 661 CE at the mosque of Kufa, his son, Hasan, was elected caliph and adopted a similar approach towards Muawiya. However, as Muawiya began to buy the loyalties of military commanders and tribal chiefs, Hasan&#x27;s military campaign suffered defections in large numbers. After a failed assassination attempt on his life, a wounded Hasan ceded the caliphate to Muawiya.

==Military expansion==
The Rashidun Caliphate greatly expanded Islam beyond Arabia, conquering all of Persia, Syria (637), Armenia (639), Egypt (639) and Cyprus (654).

==Social policies==
During his reign, Abu Bakr established the &quot;Bayt al-Mal&quot; (state treasury). Umar expanded the treasury and established a government building to administer the state finances.

Upon conquest, in almost all cases, the caliphs were burdened with the maintenance and construction of roads and bridges in return for the conquered nation&#x27;s political loyalty.

===Civil activities===
Civil welfare in Islam started in the form of the construction and purchase of wells. During the caliphate, the Muslims repaired many of the aging wells in the lands they conquered. 

In addition to wells, the Muslims built many tanks and canals. Many canals were purchased, and new ones constructed. While some canals were excluded for the use of monks (such as a spring purchased by Talhah), and the needy, most canals were open to general public use. Some canals were constructed between settlements, such as the Saad canal that provided water to Anbar, and the Abi Musa Canal to provide water to Basra. 

During a famine, Umar ibn al-Khattab ordered the construction of a canal in Egypt connecting the Nile with the sea. The purpose of the canal was to facilitate the transport of grain to Arabia through a sea-route, hitherto transported only by land. The canal was constructed within a year by &#x27;Amr ibn al-&#x27;As, and Abdus Salam Nadiv writes that &quot;Arabia was rid of famine for all the times to come.&quot; 

After four floods hit Mecca after Muhammad&#x27;s death, Umar ordered the construction of two dams to protect the Kaaba. He also constructed a dam near Medina to protect its fountains from flooding. 

===Settlements===

The area of Basra was very sparsely populated when it was conquered by the Muslims. During the reign of Umar, the Muslim army found it a suitable place to construct a base. Later the area was settled and a mosque was erected.

Upon the conquest of Madyan, it was settled by Muslims. However, soon the environment was considered harsh, and Umar ordered the resettlement of the 40,000 settlers to Kufa. The new buildings were constructed from mud bricks instead of reeds, a material that was popular in the region, but caught fire easily.

During the conquest of Egypt the area of Fustat was used by the Muslim army as a base. Upon the conquest of Alexandria, the Muslims returned and settled in the same area. Initially the land was primarily used for pasture, but later buildings were constructed.

Other already populated areas were greatly expanded. At Mosul, Arfaja al-Bariqi, at the command of Umar, constructed a fort, a few churches, a mosque and a locality for the Jewish population.

==Religious significance ==

The first four caliphs are particularly significant to modern intra-Islamic debates: for Sunni Muslims, they are models of righteous rule; for Shia Muslims, the first three of the four were usurpers. Accepted traditions of both Sunni and Shia Muslims detail disagreements and tensions between the four rightly guided caliphs. The Nizari Ismailis on the other hand, have come to accept the caliphates of Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman in the modern times under the leadership and teachings of the Aga Khans, even though polemics against those early caliphs were prevalent during the Fatimid period. For instance, the Fatimid Ismaili Imam-Caliph Al-Hakim bi Amr Allah ordered the public cursing of the first three caliphs in the year 1005 in Cairo.

=== Sunni view ===
In Sunni Islam, the application of the label &#x27;rightly-guided&#x27; to the first caliphs signifies their status as models whose actions and opinions (Arabic: ) should be followed and emulated from a religious point of view. In this sense, they are both &#x27;rightly-guided&#x27; and &#x27;rightly-guiding&#x27;: the religious narratives about their lives serve as a guide to right belief.

They were all close companions of Muhammad, and his relatives: the daughters of Abu Bakr and Umar, Aisha and Hafsa respectively, were married to Muhammad, and two of Muhammad&#x27;s daughters Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum were married to Uthman and another daughter Fatimah to Ali. Likewise, their succession was not hereditary, something that would become the custom after them, beginning with the subsequent Umayyad Caliphate. Council decision or caliph&#x27;s choice determined the successor originally.

The Sunni have long viewed the period of the Rashidun as an exemplary system of governance—based upon Islamic righteousness and merit—which they seek to emulate. The Sunni also equate this system with the worldly success that was promised by Allah, in the Quran and hadith, to those Muslims who pursued His pleasure; this spectacular success has further added to the emulatory appeal of the Rashidun era.

At the same time, it has been noted that the domination of Arabs over non-Arabs on an ethnic basis during Umar&#x27;s reign and the widespread nepotism of Uthman&#x27;s caliphate are in essential conflict with the call of Islam.

===Shia view===
The (Twelver) Shia view is that, similar to the past prophets in the Quran, the succession to Muhammad was settled by divine appointment, rather than by consensus. In the Shia view, as with the past prophets in the Quran, God chose Muhammad&#x27;s successor from his family. In particular, Muhammad announced his cousin and son-in-law, Ali, as his rightful successor shortly before his death at the event of Ghadir Khumm and on other occasions, e.g., at the event of Dhul Asheera. Of course, as with the faith itself, the faithful were endowed with the free will not to follow Ali, to their own disadvantage. In the Shia view, while direct revelation ended with Muhammad&#x27;s death, Ali remained the righteous guide or Imam towards God, similar to the successors of the past prophets in the Quran. After Muhammad&#x27;s death, Ali inherited Muhammad&#x27;s divine knowledge and his authority to correctly interpret the Quran, especially its allegorical and metaphorical verses (&quot;mutashabihat&quot;).

In the Shia view, since the time of the first prophet, Adam, the earth has never remained without an Imam, in the form of prophets and their divinely-appointed successors. Likewise, Imamate was passed on from Ali to the next Imam, Hasan, by divinely-inspired designation (&quot;nass&quot;). After Hasan&#x27;s death, Husayn and nine of his descendants are the Shia Imams, the last of whom, Mahdi, went into occultation in 260 AH, due to the hostility of Mahdi&#x27;s enemies and the danger to his life. His advent is awaited by the Shia and Sunni alike, although the Sunni hold different views about Mahdi. In his absence, the vacuum in the Shia leadership is partly filled by &quot;marjaiyya&quot; and, more recently, by &quot;wilayat al-faqqih&quot;, i.e., guardianship of the Islamic jurist.

While the Ismaili Shi&#x27;ites accept a closely-related understanding of Imamate as the Twelver Shia, the Ismailis under the leadership of the Aga Khans do recognize the caliphates of the first three caliphs before Ali ibn Abi Talib while distinguishing Imamate as a separate office apart from the Caliphate:

<text>Yazid ibn Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (; — 26 January 724), commonly known as Yazid II, was the ninth Umayyad caliph, ruling from 720 until his death in 724. Although he lacked administrative or military experience, he derived prestige from his lineage, being a descendant of both ruling branches of the Umayyad dynasty, the Sufyanids who founded the Umayyad Caliphate in 661 and the Marwanids who succeeded them in 684. He was designated by his half-brother, Caliph Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik (), as second-in-line to the succession after their cousin Umar (), as a compromise with the sons of Abd al-Malik (). 

He reversed the reformist policies of Umar, mainly by reimposing the jizya (poll tax) on the (non-Arab Muslim converts) and resuming the war efforts on the frontiers of the Caliphate, especially against the Khazars in the Caucasus and the Byzantines in Anatolia. Yazid&#x27;s moves were in line with the desires of the Arab militarist camp and the Umayyad dynasty but did not solve the fiscal crisis of the Caliphate as war booty had become insufficient and the reimposition of the jizya met strong resistance from the converted populations in the large provinces of Khurasan and Ifriqiya. He issued an iconoclastic edict whereby Christian icons were destroyed in churches across the caliphate, influencing the Byzantine emperor Leo III () to institute a similar edict in his domains.

Yazid reintroduced Syrian troops to enforce Umayyad rule in Iraq, where their domination was long resented. One of the first events of his reign was the wide-scale rebellion of the Iraqis under Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, whose suppression marked the end to the serious anti-Umayyad revolts in the restive province. Ibn al-Muhallab was a champion of the Yamanis and Yazid&#x27;s appointment of Qaysi partisans to rule Iraq escalated the factional tensions there, though elsewhere Yazid balanced the interests of the two rival factions. The deadly suppression of the Muhallabids became a rallying cry for revenge during the Abbasid Revolution, which toppled the Umayyads in 750.

==Early life==
Yazid was born in Damascus, the capital of the Umayyad Caliphate, . He was the son of Caliph Abd al-Malik () and his influential wife Atika, the daughter of Yazid II&#x27;s namesake, Caliph Yazid I (). Sources occasionally refer to him as &#x27;Ibn Atika&#x27;. His (patronymic) was Abu Khalid and he was nicknamed (). Yazid II&#x27;s pedigree united his father&#x27;s Marwanid branch of the Umayyad dynasty, in power since 684, and the Sufyanid branch of Yazid I and the latter&#x27;s father Mu&#x27;awiya I (), founder of the Umayyad Caliphate. 

Yazid did not possess military or administrative experience before his reign. He rarely left Syria except for a number of visits to the Hejaz (western Arabia, home of the Islamic holy cities Mecca and Medina), including once for the annual Hajj pilgrimage sometime between 715 and 717. 

He was possibly granted control of the region around Amman by Abd al-Malik. He built the desert palaces of al-Qastal and al-Muwaqqar, both in the general vicinity of Amman. The palaces are conventionally dated to his caliphate, though a number of archaeologists suggest Yazid began their construction before 720.

==Family==
Yazid established marital ties to the family of al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf (d. 714), the powerful viceroy of Iraq for his father, Caliph Abd al-Malik, and brother, al-Walid I (). He married al-Hajjaj&#x27;s niece, Umm al-Hajjaj, the daughter of Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi. During her uncle&#x27;s lifetime, she gave birth to Yazid&#x27;s sons: al-Hajjaj, who died young, and al-Walid II, who became caliph in 743. Yazid was also married to Su&#x27;da bint Abd Allah ibn Amr, a great-granddaughter of Caliph Uthman (), who mothered Yazid&#x27;s son and daughter Abd Allah and A&#x27;isha. Su&#x27;da&#x27;s cousin, Sa&#x27;id ibn Khalid ibn Amr ibn Uthman, is held by the 9th-century historian al-Ya&#x27;qubi to have &quot;exercised the most influence upon Yazīd&quot;. Yazid had also taken two singers Sallama al-Qass and Habbaba as concubines. Overall, Yazid had six children from his two wives and eight by slave concubines. His other sons were al-Nu&#x27;man, Yahya, Muhammad, al-Ghamr, Sulayman, Abd al-Jabbar, Dawud, Abu Sulayman, al-Awwam and Hashim.

==Caliphate==
===Accession===
By dint of his descent, Yazid was a natural candidate for the succession to the caliphate. A noble Arab maternal lineage held political weight during this period in the Caliphate&#x27;s history, and Yazid took pride in his maternal Sufyanid descent, viewing himself superior to his paternal half-brothers. He was chosen by his half-brother Caliph Sulayman () as the second-in-line in the caliphal succession after their first cousin, Umar, who ruled from 717 to 720. Yazid acceded at the age of 29 after the death of Umar on 9 February 720. For most of his reign, he resided in Damascus or his estates in Jund al-Urdunn (the military district of Jordan), which was centered in Tiberias and roughly corresponded with the Byzantine province of Palaestina Secunda.

===Suppression of the Muhallabids===

Shortly before or immediately after Yazid&#x27;s accession, the veteran commander and disgraced governor of Iraq and the vast eastern province of Khurasan, Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, escaped from the fortress of Aleppo where Umar had him imprisoned. During Sulayman&#x27;s reign, Ibn al-Muhallab, an enemy of al-Hajjaj, had been responsible for the torture and deaths of members of al-Hajjaj&#x27;s family, Yazid&#x27;s in-laws, and feared retaliatory maltreatment when Yazid&#x27;s accession became apparent. Yazid had long-held suspicions, nurtured by al-Hajjaj, of Ibn al-Muhallab&#x27;s and the Muhallabid family&#x27;s influence and ambitions in Iraq and the eastern Caliphate. 

Evading the pursuit of Umar&#x27;s or Yazid&#x27;s commanders, Ibn al-Muhallab made his way to Basra, one of the main garrison towns of Iraq and the center of his family and the Azd Uman tribe. On Yazid&#x27;s orders, Basra&#x27;s governor Adi ibn Artat al-Fazari arrested many of Ibn al-Muhallab&#x27;s brothers and cousins before his arrival to the city. Ibn Artat was unable to stop Ibn al-Muhallab&#x27;s entry and the latter, with support from his Yamani tribal allies in the Basra garrison, besieged Ibn Artat in the city&#x27;s citadel. The Qays–Mudar factions of the garrison, though traditional rivals of the Yaman and unsympathetic to Ibn al-Muhallab, did not actively or effectively oppose him. Ibn al-Muhallab seized the citadel, captured the governor and established control over Basra. Yazid pardoned him, but Ibn al-Muhallab continued his opposition, declaring jihad (holy war) against the caliph and the Syrian troops who enforced Umayyad authority in Iraq. Umar had likely withdrawn most of the Syrians from Wasit, their main garrison in Iraq, and Ibn al-Muhallab captured the city with ease. Most of the (pious Qur&#x27;an readers) and the (non-Arab Muslim converts) of Basra supported Ibn al-Muhallab&#x27;s cause, except the prominent theologian al-Hasan al-Basri. The Iranian dependencies of Basra, namely Ahwaz, Fars and Kerman, joined the revolt, though not Khurasan, where Qays–Mudar troops counterbalanced the pro-Muhallabid Yamani faction in the province&#x27;s garrisons. 

Ibn al-Muhallab advanced toward Kufa, the other main garrison center of Iraq, where he attracted support across the tribal spectrum and among many of its noble Arab households. In the meantime, Yazid dispatched his kinsmen, the veteran commanders Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik and al-Abbas ibn al-Walid, to suppress the revolt. They killed Ibn al-Muhallab and routed his army near Kufa on 24 August 720. Yazid ordered the executions of the roughly two hundred prisoners-of-war captured from Ibn al-Muhallab&#x27;s camp, while Ibn al-Muhallab&#x27;s son Mu&#x27;awiya ordered the execution of Ibn Artat and his thirty supporters incarcerated in Wasit. Afterward, the Umayyad authorities pursued and killed many of the Muhallabids, including nine to fourteen boys who were sent to Yazid and executed by his order. The Muhallabid revolt&#x27;s suppression marked the last of the great anti-Umayyad uprisings in Iraq.

====Escalation of Qays–Yaman factionalism====
The defeat of the Yamani Muhallabids and Yazid&#x27;s successive appointments to Iraq of the pro-Qaysi Maslama—who was shortly dismissed for not forwarding the provincial tax surplus to the caliph&#x27;s treasury—and Maslama&#x27;s Qaysi lieutenant, Umar ibn Hubayra al-Fazari, signaled a triumph for the Qays–Mudar faction in the province and its eastern dependencies. According to the historian Julius Wellhausen, &quot;the proscription of the whole of the prominent and powerful [Muhallabid] family, a measure hitherto unheard of in the history of the Umaiyids [sic], came like a declaration of war against the Yemen [faction] in general, and the corollary was that the government was degenerating into a Qaisite party-rule&quot;. Wellhausen blamed the caliph for the escalation of factionalism and attributed the appointment of Ibn Hubayra to his own desire for revenge against the Muhallabids&#x27; Yamani backers. The Yamani-affiliated tribes of Khurasan viewed the events as a humiliation, and during the Abbasid Revolution which toppled the Umayyads in 750, they adopted as one of their slogans &quot;revenge for the Banu Muhallab [Muhallabids]&quot;. 

Orientalist Henri Lammens considers Yazid&#x27;s portrayal as &quot;a pro-Mudar and anti-Yaman extremist&quot; as &quot;unfair, as he actually tried to balance the conflicting groups, just as other Umayyad rulers did.&quot; Yazid did not champion the Qays over the Quda&#x27;a, the major component of the Yaman in Syria. Indeed, members of the Quda&#x27;a&#x27;s principal tribe, the Banu Kalb, had formed the core of the caliph&#x27;s army during the suppression, pursuit and elimination of the Muhallabids. He appointed Yamani governors to the large provinces of Ifriqiya (central North Africa) and the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) and its dependent districts of Adharbayjan and Armenia.

===Fiscal and military policies===
The expenses of enforcing Umayyad rule in Iraq and the expansionist war efforts along multiple fronts, including the enormous cost of the failed sieges of Constantinople in 717–718, had erased much of the monetary gains from the conquests of Transoxiana, Sind and the Iberian Peninsula under al-Walid I, causing a financial crisis in the Caliphate. Among the solutions of Yazid&#x27;s predecessor to the fiscal burden were the withdrawal of the Syrians from Iraq, a halt on conquests, and near elimination of grants to Umayyad princes, as well as an unrealized goal to withdraw Arab troops altogether from Transoxiana, the Iberian Peninsula and Cilicia. The most significant reforms of Umar granted equality to the in Khurasan, Sind, Ifriqiya and the Iberian Peninsula by abolishing the jizya, the poll tax traditionally exacted on non-Muslim subjects but in practice extended to non-Arab Muslim converts, and instituting equal pay for in the ranks of the Caliphate&#x27;s Arab-dominated armies. According to Blankinship, the reforms favoring the may have been guided by Umar&#x27;s piety but also a fiscal consideration: if equal treatment with the Arabs made the government popular with the it could translate into delegating an increased security role for the in their native provinces and their enthusiastic defense of the Caliphate&#x27;s frontiers, thereby reducing the expense of deploying and garrisoning Arab troops.

Yazid attempted to reverse, with limited success, the reforms of Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, which were opposed by the Arab militarist camp in the Caliphate and the Umayyad ruling family. During Umar&#x27;s rule, the militarist camp led by Maslama may have accepted a temporary pause in activity to recover from the Constantinople debacle. Under Yazid, Maslama and his proteges, including Ibn Hubayra, were restored or appointed to senior commands, Syrian garrisons were reintroduced to Iraq, the traditional annual raids against the Byzantines and the war with the Khazars were restarted, and the grants of estates or generous sums to Umayyad princes resumed. Although Yazid&#x27;s policies were presumably meant to gain the backing of the ruling elite and restore the flow of war spoils, they proved insufficient to finance the Caliphate&#x27;s troops, particularly as booty had become increasingly difficult to obtain by the Arab expeditionary forces.

To fill the depleted coffers of the caliphal treasury, Yazid turned to the fifth of provincial tax revenues officially owed to the caliph. Historically, the provinces neglected to forward the revenues if political conditions allowed, and governors often pilfered such funds. To ensure revenues flow to the treasury, Yazid appointed governors based on the example set by al-Hajjaj—i.e., upright, meticulously loyal, and ruthless in collecting taxes. Unlike the era of al-Hajjaj, however, Yazid applied this principle for the first time to Ifriqiya, Khurasan, Sind and the Iberian Peninsula. A significant aspect of his policy was the reinstatement of the &quot;jizya&quot; on the , which alienated the in the provinces mentioned above. 

In Ifriqiya, the caliph&#x27;s governor Yazid ibn Abi Muslim, himself a from Iraq and a protégé of al-Hajjaj, was assassinated by his Berber guard in 720, shortly after his appointment, for attempting to reinstate the jizya. Many, if not most, Berbers had embraced Islam and commanded a strong position in the army, unlike in other parts of the Caliphate. The Berbers reinstalled Ibn Abi Muslim&#x27;s predecessor Ismail ibn Abd Allah ibn Abi al-Muhajir and notified Yazid, who approved the change. The incident in Ifriqiya was a blow to the Caliphate&#x27;s prestige in North Africa and served as a harbinger for the Berber Revolt in 740–743. The reinstatement of the jizya in Khurasan in 721/22 by Ibn Hubayra&#x27;s deputy Sa&#x27;id ibn Amr al-Harashi led to revolts and wars in the province that continued for twenty years and partly contributed to the Abbasid Revolution. In Egypt, pay increases to the indigenous sailors of the Muslim fleet were reversed.

===War against the Khazars===
In March 722, the Syrian army of Yazid&#x27;s governor in Armenia and Adharbayjan, Mi&#x27;laq ibn Saffar al-Bahrani, was routed by the Khazars in Armenia, south of the Caucasus. The defeat marked the culmination of the Caliphate&#x27;s winter campaign against the Khazars and resulted in considerable Syrian losses. To avenge this defeat, Yazid II sent al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah at the head of a 25,000-strong army of Syrians, who pushed into the Caucasus homeland of the Khazars and took their capital of Balanjar on 22 August. The main body of the highly mobile Khazars avoided the Muslims&#x27; pursuit, and their presence compelled al-Jarrah to withdraw to Warthan south of the Caucasus and request reinforcements from Yazid. In 723, he led another raid north of Balanjar but made no substantive gains.

===Iconoclastic edict===
According to Greek sources, including Patriarch John V of Jerusalem (d. 735), Theophanes the Confessor (d. 818), and Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople (d. 828), Yazid issued an edict ordering the destruction of all icons in Christian churches across the Caliphate after conferring with a Tiberian magician of reportedly Jewish descent named Beser of Tessarakontapechys, who had promised Yazid a long life of fortune in return. Syriac sources further note that Yazid entrusted Maslama to execute the order and that the mandate influenced the Byzantine emperor Leo III () to enact his own iconoclastic policy for the Byzantine Empire. The Egypt-based Arab historians al-Kindi (d. 961), Bishop Severus ibn al-Muqaffa (d. 987), and al-Maqrizi (d. 1442) also make a note of the edict and describe its execution in Egypt. Medieval historians cite different years for Yazid&#x27;s edict, but modern historian Alexander Vasiliev holds that July 721, the date cited by Patriarch John V, is the most reliable. The order was reversed by Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik ().

==Death==
Yazid died of consumption in Irbid, a town in the Balqa subdistrict of Jund Dimashq (the military division of Damascus corresponding to Transjordan) on 24 Sha&#x27;ban 105 AH (26 January 724). His son al-Walid or half-brother Hisham led his funeral prayers. Yazid had intended to appoint al-Walid as his immediate successor but was persuaded by Maslama to appoint Hisham instead, followed by al-Walid.

==Portrayal in sources==
In traditional Islamic sources, Yazid and his son al-Walid have &quot;a reputation for unabashed extravagance and hedonism&quot;, contrasting with Umar&#x27;s piety and Hisham&#x27;s austerity. According to historian Khalid Yahya Blankinship, despite the &quot;momentous events of his reign&quot;, both the traditional and modern sources frequently depict Yazid as &quot;a frivolous slave to passion&quot;, especially to his singing slave girls Hababa and Sallama, whom he acquired after his accession. Hababa&#x27;s talents, beauty and charm supposedly captivated the caliph, causing him to neglect his duties, to the chagrin of his inner circle, especially Maslama. According to this narrative, Yazid had secluded himself with Hababa at his estate in the wine country of Beit Ras (Capitolias), near Irbid. There, Hababa died when she choked on a grape or pomegranate seed Yazid had playfully tossed into her mouth. Grief-stricken, he died a few days later. Blankinship considers the portrayal of Yazid as being heavily influenced by Hababa to be &quot;much exaggerated&quot;, though he likely patronized poets and had a &quot;refined artistic taste&quot;.

<doc id="437385" wikidata="Q129585" url="?curid=437385" title="Fourth generation of video game consoles">
<text>In the history of video games, the fourth generation of video game consoles, more commonly referred to as the 16-bit era, began on October 30, 1987, with the Japanese release of NEC Home Electronics&#x27; PC Engine (known as the TurboGrafx-16 in North America). Though NEC released the first console of this era, sales were mostly dominated by the rivalry between Sega and Nintendo across most markets: the Sega Mega Drive (known as the Sega Genesis in North America) and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (known as the &quot;Super Famicom&quot; in Japan). Cartridge-based handheld game consoles became prominent during this time, such as the Nintendo Game Boy, Atari Lynx, Sega Game Gear and TurboExpress.

Nintendo was able to capitalize on its success in the third generation, and managed to win the largest worldwide market share in the fourth generation as well. However, particularly in the lucrative North American market, there was a fierce console war that raged through the early &#x27;90s, which eventually saw Sega taking a market share lead over Nintendo in North America by 1993. Sega&#x27;s success in this era stemmed largely from its launch of its popular Sonic the Hedgehog franchise to compete with Nintendo&#x27;s Super Mario series, as well as a very stylized marketing campaign aimed at American teenagers. Several other companies released consoles in this generation, but none of them were widely successful. Nevertheless, there were other companies that started to take notice of the maturing video game industry and begin making plans to release consoles of their own in the future. As with prior generations, game media still continued to be distributed primarily on ROM cartridges, though the first optical disc systems, such as the Philips CD-i, were released to limited success. There was additionally competition with home computer games on the Amiga and on DOS-based IBM clones, especially in markets like Europe. As games became more complex, concerns over video game violence, namely in titles such as &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and &quot;Night Trap&quot;, led to the eventual creation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board.

The emergence of fifth generation video game consoles, beginning around 1994, did not significantly diminish the popularity of fourth generation consoles for a few years. In 1996, however, there was a major drop in sales of hardware from this generation and a dwindling number of software publishers supporting fourth generation systems, which together led to a drop in software sales in subsequent years.

==Differences from third generation consoles==

Features that distinguish some fourth generation consoles from third generation consoles include:

* 16-bit microprocessors
* Multi-button game controllers with many buttons (3 to 8)
* Parallax scrolling of multi-layer tilemap backgrounds
* Large sprites (up to 64×64 or 16×512 pixels), 80–380 sprites on screen, 16–96 sprites per scan line
* Elaborate color, 64 to 4096 colors on screen, from palettes of 512 (9-bit) to 65,536 (16-bit) colors
* Stereo audio, with multiple channels and digital audio playback (PCM, ADPCM)
* Advanced music synthesis (FM, wavetable and/or sample-based synthesis)

Additionally, in specific cases, fourth generation hardware featured:

* Backgrounds with pseudo-3D scaling and rotation
* Sprites that can &quot;individually&quot; be scaled and rotated
* Flat-shaded 3D polygon graphics
*Surround sound support
* CD-ROM support via add-ons, allowing larger storage space, full motion video playback, and streaming CD-DA audio playback

==Home systems==

===TurboGrafx-16===
The PC Engine was the result of a collaboration between Hudson Soft and NEC and launched in Japan on October 30, 1987. It launched under the name TurboGrafx-16 in North America on August 29, 1989.

Initially, the PC Engine was quite successful in Japan, partly due to titles available on the then-new CD-ROM format. NEC released a CD add-on in 1990 and by 1992 had released a combination TurboGrafx and CD-ROM system known as the TurboDuo.

In the United States, NEC used Bonk, a head-banging caveman, as their mascot and featured him in most of the TurboGrafx advertising from 1990 to 1994. The platform was well received initially, especially in larger markets, but failed to make inroads into the smaller metropolitan areas where NEC did not have as many store representatives or as focused in-store promotion.

The TurboGrafx-16 failed to maintain its sales momentum or to make a strong impact in North America. The TurboGrafx-16 and its CD combination system, the Turbo Duo, ceased manufacturing in North America by 1994, though a small amount of software continued to trickle out for the platform.

===Mega Drive/Genesis===
The Mega Drive was released in Japan on October 29, 1988. The console was released in New York City and Los Angeles on August 14, 1989, under the name Sega Genesis, and in the rest of North America later that year. It was launched in Europe and Australia on November 30, 1990, under its original name.

Sega built their marketing campaign around their new mascot Sonic the Hedgehog, pushing the Genesis as the &quot;cooler&quot; alternative to Nintendo&#x27;s console and inventing the term &quot;Blast Processing&quot; to suggest that the Genesis was capable of handling games with faster motion than the SNES. Their advertising was often directly adversarial, leading to commercials such as &quot;Genesis does what Nintendon&#x27;t&quot; and no scream at all.

When the arcade game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; was ported for home release on the Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo decided to censor the game&#x27;s gore, but Sega kept the content in the game, via a code entered at the start screen. Sega&#x27;s version of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; received generally more favorable reviews in the gaming press and outsold the SNES version three to one. This also led to Congressional hearings to investigate the marketing of violent video games to children, and to the creation of the Interactive Digital Software Association and the Entertainment Software Rating Board. Sega concluded that the superior sales of their version of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; were outweighed by the resulting loss in consumer trust, and cancelled the game&#x27;s release in Spain to avoid further controversy. With the new ESRB rating system in place, Nintendo reconsidered its position for the release of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, and this time became the preferred version among reviewers. The Toy Retail Sales Tracking Service reported that during the key shopping month of November 1994, 63% of all 16-bit video game consoles sold were Sega systems.

The console was never popular in Japan (being regularly outsold by the PC Engine), but still managed to sell 40 million units worldwide. By late 1995, Sega was supporting five different consoles and two add-ons, and Sega Enterprises chose to discontinue the Mega Drive in Japan to concentrate on the new Sega Saturn. While this made perfect sense for the Japanese market, it was disastrous in North America: the market for Genesis games was much larger than for the Saturn, but Sega was left without the inventory or software to meet demand.

===Super NES===
Nintendo&#x27;s fourth-generation console, the Super Famicom, was released in Japan on November 21, 1990; Nintendo&#x27;s initial shipment of 300,000 units sold out within hours. The machine reached North America as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on August 23, 1991, and Europe and Australia in April 1992.

Despite stiff competition from the Mega Drive/Genesis console, the Super NES eventually took the top selling position, selling 49.10 million units worldwide, and would remain popular well into the fifth generation of consoles. Nintendo&#x27;s market position was defined by their machine&#x27;s increased video and sound capabilities, including exclusive first-party franchise titles such as &quot;F-Zero&quot;, &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, &quot;Star Fox&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;, &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot; and &quot;Super Metroid&quot;.

===Compact Disc Interactive (CD-i)===
The CD-i format was announced in the late 1980s, with the first machines compatible with the format being released in 1991. The Philips CD-i&#x27;s main selling point was that it was more than a game machine and could be used for multimedia needs. Due to an agreement between Nintendo and Philips about an abortive CD add-on for the SNES (which eventually evolved into Sony&#x27;s PlayStation), Philips also had rights to use some of Nintendo&#x27;s franchises. The CD-i was a commercial failure and was discontinued in 1998, selling only 1 million units worldwide despite several partnerships and multiple versions of the device, some made by other manufacturers.

===Neo Geo===
Released by SNK in 1990, the Neo Geo was a home console version of the major arcade platform. Compared to its console competition, the Neo Geo had much better graphics and sound, however, the prohibitively expensive launch price of $649.99 and games often retailing at over $250 made the console only accessible to a niche market. A less expensive version, retailing for $399.99, did not include a memory card, pack-in game or extra joystick.

===Add-ons===
Nintendo, NEC and Sega also competed with hardware peripherals for their consoles in this generation. NEC was the first with the release of the TurboGrafx CD system in 1990. Retailing for $399.99 at release, the CD add-on was not a popular purchase, but was largely responsible for the platform&#x27;s success in Japan. The Sega CD was released with an unusually high price tag ($300 at its release) and a limited library of games. A unique add-on for the Sega console was Sega Channel, a subscription-based service (a form of online gaming delivery) hosted by local television providers. It required hardware that plugged into a cable line and the Genesis.

Nintendo also made two attempts with the Satellaview and the Super Game Boy. The Satellaview was a satellite service released only in Japan and the Super Game Boy was an adapter for the SNES that allowed Game Boy games to be displayed on a TV in color. Nintendo, working along with Sony, also had plans to create a CD-ROM drive for the SNES (plans that resulted in a prototype version of the Sony PlayStation), but eventually decided not to go through with that project, opting to team up with Philips in the development of the add-on instead (contrary to popular belief, the CD-i was largely unrelated to the project).

===European importing===

The fourth generation was also the era when the act of buying imported US games became more established in Europe, and regular stores began to carry them. The PAL region has a refresh rate of 50 Hz (compared with 60 Hz for NTSC) and a vertical resolution of 625 interlaced lines (576 effective), compared with 525/480 for NTSC. Because the simulation speed of contemporary game systems was directly linked to the output frame rate, which was in turn synchronized with the TV&#x27;s refresh rate, this meant that the game would run more slowly on a PAL television. The smaller number of vertical lines in the NTSC signal would also lead to black bars appearing on the top and bottom of a PAL television. Developers often had a hard time converting games designed for the American and Japanese NTSC standard to the European and Australian PAL standard. Companies such as Konami, with large budgets and a healthy following in Europe and Australia, readily optimized several games (such as the &quot;International Superstar Soccer&quot; series) for this audience, while most smaller developers did not.

Also, few RPGs were released in Europe because the market for the genre was not as large as in Japan or North America, and the increasing amount of time and money required for translation as RPGs became more text-heavy, in addition to the usual need to convert the games to the PAL standard, often made localizing the games to Europe a high-cost venture with little potential payoff. As a result, RPG releases in Europe were largely limited to games which had previously been localized for North America, thus reducing the amount of translation required.

Popular US games imported at this time included &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; (known in the US as &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot;), &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; (known in the US as &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot;), &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, and &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;. &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; would eventually receive official release in Europe, whilst &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; would be released in Europe years later on other consoles or formats outside of this generation.

==Handheld systems==
The first handheld game console released in the fourth generation was the Game Boy, on April 21, 1989. It went on to dominate handheld sales by an extremely large margin, despite featuring an 8-bit microprocessor and a low-contrast, unlit monochrome screen while all three of its leading competitors had color. Three major franchises made their debut on the Game Boy: &quot;Tetris&quot;, the Game Boy&#x27;s killer application; Pokémon; and Kirby. With some design (Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Light) and hardware (Game Boy Color) changes, it continued in production in some form until 2008, enjoying a better than 18-year run.

The Atari Lynx included hardware-accelerated color graphics, a backlight, and the ability to link up to sixteen units together in an early example of network play when its competitors could only link 2 or 4 consoles (or none at all), but its comparatively short battery life (approximately 4.5 hours on a set of alkaline cells, versus 35 hours for the Game Boy), high price, and weak games library made it one of the worst-selling handheld game systems of all time, with less than 500,000 units sold.

The third major handheld of the fourth generation was the Game Gear. It featured graphics capabilities roughly comparable to the Master System (better colours, but lower resolution), a ready made games library by using the &quot;Master-Gear&quot; adaptor to play cartridges from the older console, and the opportunity to be converted into a portable TV using a cheap tuner adaptor, but it also suffered some of the same shortcomings as the Lynx. While it sold more than twenty times as many units as the Lynx, its bulky design – slightly larger than even the original Game Boy; relatively poor battery life – only a little better than the Lynx; and later arrival in the marketplace – competing for sales amongst the remaining buyers who did not already have a Game Boy – hampered its overall popularity despite being more closely competitive to the Nintendo in terms of price and breadth of software library. Sega eventually retired the Game Gear in 1997, a year before Nintendo released the first examples of the Game Boy Color, to focus on the Nomad and non-portable console products.

Other handheld consoles released during the fourth generation included the TurboExpress, a handheld version of the TurboGrafx-16 released by NEC in 1990, and the Game Boy Pocket, an improved model of the Game Boy released about two years before the debut of the Game Boy Color. While the TurboExpress was another early pioneer of color handheld gaming technology and had the added benefit of using the same game cartridges or &#x27;HuCards&#x27; as the TurboGrafx16, it had even worse battery life than the Lynx and Game Gear – about three hours on six contemporary AA batteries – selling only 1.5 million units.

* &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (Arcade, Genesis, SNES) by Midway Games garnered heated controversy over its violent themes, with the uncensored Genesis version outselling the SNES version by nearly three-to-one, ultimately leading to a U.S. Congressional hearing and the creation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board.
* &quot;NHLPA Hockey &#x27;93&quot; (Genesis, SNES) by Park Place Productions and EA Sports is considered one of the most outstanding sports games ever made.
* &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; (Genesis) by Sega Consumer Development Division 2 and Sega has been cited as one of the best and most influential console RPGs.
* &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (Genesis) by Sonic Team and Sega was Sega&#x27;s bid to compete head-to head with Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario&quot; franchise, played a critical role in the success of the Genesis, and received widespread critical acclaim as one of the greatest games ever made, kickstarting a successful franchise.
* &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; (Arcade, Genesis, SNES, TurboGrafx) by Capcom was the second game in the series to produce a lasting fanbase and set many of the trends seen in fighting games today, most notably its colorful selection of playable fighters from different countries across the globe.

<text>Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (; 6 February 743) was the tenth Umayyad caliph, ruling from 724 until his death in 743.

==Early life==
Hisham was born in Damascus, the administrative capital of the Umayyad Caliphate, in AH 72 (691–692 CE). His father was the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (). His mother, A&#x27;isha, was a daughter of Hisham ibn Isma&#x27;il of the Banu Makhzum, a prominent family of the Quraysh, and Abd al-Malik&#x27;s longtime governor of the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. According to the history of al-Tabari (d. 923), Hisham was given the &quot;kunya&quot; (patronymic) of Abu al-Walid.

There is little information about Hisham&#x27;s early life. He was too young to play any political or military role during his father&#x27;s reign. He supposedly led the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca once during his brother al-Walid I&#x27;s reign () and while there, met a respected descendant of Caliph Ali (), Zayn al-Abidin. Hisham is credited by al-Tabari for leading an expedition against the Byzantines across the Caliphate&#x27;s frontier in 706 and capturing a number of their fortified positions.

Hisham began to demonstrate aspirations for the caliphate at the death of his brother, Caliph Sulayman () in 717. On his deathbed, Sulayman had nominated as his successor their paternal first cousin, Umar II, but kept the order secret, entrusting the revelation to his chief adviser Raja ibn Haywa. When Raja informed the Umayyad family of the decision, Hisham protested that the caliphal office was the preserve of Abd al-Malik&#x27;s direct descendants and only relented from his opposition when threatened by force. He played no political or military role under Umar () but is mentioned in a 10th-century biography of Umar as having issued a letter to the caliph complaining of his and his brothers&#x27; treatment under the caliph&#x27;s rule. Hisham also held no posts under his brother, Caliph Yazid II ().

==Caliphate==
===Accession===
Upon the counsel of their brother, the prominent general Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, Yazid nominated Hisham as his successor over his own son al-Walid II, whom he had originally intended to designate as first-in-line. Hisham acceded after Yazid died in January 724. He received the news while at his Syrian desert estate, al-Zaytuna, which is identified as Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi, near Hisham&#x27;s favored residence, al-Rusafa, which is identified as Qasr al-Hayr al-Sharqi. He was given the caliphal ring and staff by a postal messenger, after which he rode to Damascus, where he was publicly acclaimed as caliph.

===Overview===
Hisham inherited an empire with many different problems. He would, however, be effective in attending to these problems, and in allowing the Umayyad empire to continue as an entity. His long rule was an effective one, and it saw a rebirth of reforms that were originated by Umar bin Abd al-Aziz.

Like a-Walid I, Hisham was a great patron of the arts, and he again encouraged arts in the empire. He also encouraged the growth of education by building more schools, and perhaps most importantly, by overseeing the translation of numerous literary and scientific masterpieces into Arabic. He returned to a stricter interpretation of the Sharia as Umar had, and enforced it, even upon his own family. His ability to stand up to the Umayyad clan may have been an important factor in his success, and may point to why his brother Yazid was ineffective.

According to tradition, Hisham ordered the hadith scholar Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri (d.742) to commit the hadith he had memorized to writing.

===Military activities===

On the military front his empire suffered a series of setbacks, especially in the Caucasus against the Khazars (the Battle of Marj Ardabil) and in Transoxiana against the Turgesh (the &quot;Day of Thirst&quot; and the Battle of the Pass). Hisham sent armies to end the Hindu rebellion in Sind, and was successful when the Hindu ruler Jai Singh was killed. This allowed the Umayyads to reassert their rule over some portions of their provinces in India. Some invasions of Indian kingdoms were led by the Arab governors of Sind but they were unsuccessful.

Under Hisham&#x27;s rule, regular raids against the Byzantine Empire continued. One regular commander of Arab forces was the redoubtable Maslama, Hisham&#x27;s half-brother. He fought the Byzantines in 725–726 CE (A.H. 107) and the next year captured Caesarea Mazaca. He also fought the Khazars in the Caucasus. In 728, he fought for a month against the Khaqan there and defeated him. Hisham&#x27;s son Mu&#x27;awiya was another Arab commander in the almost-annual raids against the Byzantine Empire. In 728, he took the fort of Samalu in Cilicia. The next year Mu&#x27;awiya thrust left and Sa&#x27;id ibn Hisham right, in addition to a sea raid. In 731, Mu&#x27;awiya captured Kharsianon in Cappadocia.

Mu&#x27;awiya raided the Byzantine Empire in 731–732 (A.H. 113). The next year he captured Aqrun (Akroinos), while Abdallah al-Battal took a Byzantine commander prisoner. Mu&#x27;awiya raided Byzantium from 734–737. In 737, al Walid ibn al Qa&#x27;qa al-Absi led the raid against the Byzantines. The next year Sulayman ibn Hisham captured Sindira (Sideroun). In 738–739, Maslama captured some of Cappadocia and also raided the Avars. Theophanes the Confessor (p. 103) states that while some Arabs raided successfully in 739 and returned home safely, others were soundly defeated at the Battle of Akroinon. He records that internal Byzantine strife (the struggle between Constantine V and the usurper Artabasdos) facilitated Arab raids by Sulayman ibn Hisham in 741–742 (p. 106) that made many Byzantines Arab captives. Al-Tabari refers to the same raid.

In North Africa, Kharijite teachings combined with natural local restlessness to produce a significant Berber revolt. In 740, a large Berber force surrounded a loyal army at Wadi Sherif, where the loyalists fought to the death. Hisham dispatched a force of 27,000 Syrians, which was destroyed in 741. In 742 Handhala ibn Safwan began successfully, but soon was besieged in Qairawan. He led a desperate sortie from the city that scattered the Berbers, killing thousands and re-establishing Umayyad rule.

Hisham also faced a revolt by the armies of Zayd ibn Ali, grandson of Husayn bin Ali, which was put down because of the betrayal of the Kufans. The Kufans encouraged Zayd to revolt. Zayd was ordered to leave Kufa and though he appeared to set out for Mecca, he returned and dwelt secretly in Kufa moving from house to house and receiving the allegiance of many people. Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi, Iraq&#x27;s governor, learned of the plot, commanded the people to gather at the great mosque, locked them inside and began a search for Zayd. Zayd with some troops fought his way to the mosque and called on people to come out. He then pushed back Yusuf&#x27;s troops, but was felled by an arrow. Although his body was initially buried, the spot was pointed out and it was extracted, beheaded and the head sent to Hisham and later to Medina.

In Spain, the internal conflicts of the years past were ended, and Hisham&#x27;s governor, Abd al-Rahman ibn Abdallah, assembled a large army that went into France. He besieged Bordeaux and pushed to the Loire. This marked the limit of Arabic conquest in Western Europe. The wave was halted at the Battle of Tours by Charles Martel who ruled the kingdom of the Franks, with exception of the Fraxinetum enclave which lasted until the 10th century.

===Death and succession===
Hisham died on 6 February 743 (6 Rabiʽ al-Thani 125 AH). His son, Maslama, led the funeral prayers. Hisham had attempted to secure Maslama as his successor in place of Yazid II&#x27;s son, al-Walid II. Hisham&#x27;s initial attempts, after the Hajj of 735, to persuade al-Walid II to step down in favor of Maslama or, alternatively, to make Maslama al-Walid II&#x27;s successor were rejected. Afterward, Hisham undermine al-Walid II by secretly gathering support for Maslama. The latter&#x27;s nomination was supported by Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik and Hisham&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Hisham ibn Isma&#x27;il, the latter&#x27;s sons Ibrahim and Muhammad, as well as the sons of the tribal chief al-Qa&#x27;qa&#x27; ibn Khulayd, who were an influential family in northern Syria. Maslama&#x27;s mother, Umm Hakim, also lobbied for him. Opposed to Maslama&#x27;s proposed succession was Khalid al-Qasri, the governor of Iraq, to which Maslama responded by insulting him and his dead brother Asad. Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik&#x27;s death in the late 730s was a major setback to Hisham&#x27;s succession plans, as it represented the loss of the plan&#x27;s key supporter in the Umayyad dynasty.

Al-Walid II acceded and immediately ordered his cousin, the veteran commander al-Abbas ibn al-Walid, to arrest Hisham&#x27;s sons at Rusafa, near Palmyra, but expressly forbade that Maslama or his household be disturbed in deference to their old companionship and Maslama&#x27;s defense of al-Walid II from Hisham.

==Assessment==
In general, Hisham is viewed by modern historians and the early Islamic tradition to have overseen a successful reign, on par with the similarly long reigns of the Umayyad Caliphate&#x27;s founder Mu&#x27;awiya I () and Abd al-Malik. In the summation of the historian Francesco Gabrieli, Hisham&#x27;s rule &quot;on the whole was glorious for the Arabs and fruitful in the development of Islamic faith and culture&quot; and &quot;marks the final period of prosperity and splendour of the Umayyad caliphate&quot;. By dint of his sobriety, austerity and work ethic, Hisham is held by most modern historians to have kept the Caliphate in good-standing. They largely assign blame to his successor al-Walid II and longer-standing internal factors, which Hisham could not resolve, for the Umayyad dynasty&#x27;s unraveling in the few years after Hisham&#x27;s death. Similarly, the Islamic tradition portrays Hisham as &quot;a conscientious and efficient, if severe and tightfisted, administrator&quot;, according to Blankinship. In the view of the historian Hugh N. Kennedy, the Umayyad state &quot;had never been as strong as it had been under Hisham only a decade before the final collapse&quot; in 750.

Blankinship, on the other hand, concludes that the military disasters of Hisham&#x27;s reign brought about the Umayyad dynasty&#x27;s demise. According to him, the state struggled to absorb the significant losses incurred by these defeats. Its treasury was dependent on war booty and it lacked efficient means to collect tax revenue from its subjects. An unprecedented economic crisis ensued, precipitating stringent taxation efforts and a substantial reduction in spending. This caused widespread discontent throughout the Caliphate, while also failing to remedy state finances. Meanwhile, the harshness and diminishing material returns from campaigning along the frontiers sapped the enthusiasm of the provincial garrisons and further increased Hisham&#x27;s dependence on the Syrian army, the bedrock of the dynasty, to the chagrin of the locally-established troops. As Syrian troops were dispatched both to fight on the frontiers and quell major rebellions throughout the Caliphate they suffered the brunt of these wars. The Syrians were mostly Yamani and their dispersal and heavy losses disrupted the factional balance upon which the Umayyad state depended in favor of the Qays/Mudar of the Jazira. The Qays/Mudar became the main component of the army under Marwan II () and their rout by the Khurasani troops of the Abbasids marked the end of the Umayyad dynasty.

==Family==
Hisham&#x27;s favored wife was Umm Hakim, the daughter of Yahya ibn al-Hakam, brother of Hisham&#x27;s grandfather caliph Marwan I (). Her mother was Zaynab bint Abd al-Rahman, the granddaughter of the Syrian conquest commander al-Harith ibn Hisham of the Banu Makhzum. Umm Hakim, like her mother, was well-known for her beauty and love for wine. She gave Hisham five sons, including Sulayman, Maslama, Yazid al-Afqam, and Mu&#x27;awiya. 

Hisham was also married to Umm Uthman, a daughter of Sa&#x27;id ibn Khalid. The latter was a grandson of the third caliph Uthman () and one of the wealthiest people of his day, who used to divide his time between Syria and Medina. Umm Uthman gave birth to Hisham&#x27;s son Sa&#x27;id. His other sons were Muhammad, Abd Allah, Marwan, Abd al-Rahman and Quraysh. He had a daughter, A&#x27;isha, to whom he granted an estate at Ras Kayfa.

<text>Al-Walid ibn Yazid ibn Abd al-Malik (; 70917 April 744), commonly known as al-Walid II, was the eleventh Umayyad caliph, ruling from 743 until his assassination in 744. He succeeded his uncle, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik.

== Birth and background ==
Al-Walid was the son of Umayyad caliph Yazid II and his wife Umm al-Hajjaj bint Muhammad al-Thaqafi in 709. His mother was the daughter of Umayyad official Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Thaqafi.

His father, Yazid II ruled the Caliphate from 720 to January 724. Yazid II died in Irbid in the Balqa (i.e. Transjordan) subdistrict of Jund Dimashq (military district of Damascus) on 26 Sha&#x27;ban 105 AH (28 January 724 CE). His son al-Walid or half-brother Hisham led his funeral prayers. Yazid had intended to appoint al-Walid as his immediate successor, but was persuaded by Maslama to appoint Hisham instead, followed by al-Walid.

== Early life ==
As al-Walid grew older, Hisham became increasingly displeased with his nephew&#x27;s behaviour (including an excessive love for poetry and sex) and considered passing the succession to Hisham&#x27;s son instead. He spoke to al-Walid about his drinking of alcohol and commanded al-Walid to send away his best drinking companion. He also cut off funds to his heir and strongly encouraged him to be more respectful in religious matters.

Following Hisham&#x27;s accession, He attempted to secure Maslama ibn Hisham as his successor in place of the appointed successor, his predecessor&#x27;s son al-Walid II. Hisham&#x27;s initial attempts following the Hajj of 735 to persuade al-Walid to step down in favor of Maslama or give Maslama the oath of allegiance as al-Walid&#x27;s successor were rejected by al-Walid. Afterward, Hisham sought to undermine al-Walid and secretly gathered support for Maslama. The latter&#x27;s nomination was supported by his paternal uncle, the famous general Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik, Hisham&#x27;s maternal grandfather, the former governor of Medina Hisham ibn Isma&#x27;il al-Makhzumi, and his sons Ibrahim and Muhammad, and the sons of the influential Banu Abs chief of northern Syria, al-Qa&#x27;qa&#x27; ibn Khulayd. Maslama&#x27;s mother Umm Hakim also lobbied for her son&#x27;s succession. Opposed to Maslama&#x27;s proposed succession was Khalid al-Qasri, the governor of Iraq, to which Maslama responded by insulting him and his dead brother Asad. Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik&#x27;s death in the late 730s was a major setback to Hisham&#x27;s succession plans as it represented the loss of the plan&#x27;s key supporter in the Umayyad dynasty.
After Hisham&#x27;s death he was succeeded by Al-Walid II in February 743.

== Accession ==

Hisham died in February 743 and his son Maslama led the funeral prayers. Al-Walid II acceded to the caliphate and immediately ordered that Hisham&#x27;s sons at Rusafa, near Palmyra, be arrested by their cousin al-Abbas ibn al-Walid, but expressly forbade that Maslama or his household be disturbed in deference to their old companionship and Maslama&#x27;s defense of al-Walid from Caliph Hisham.

== Caliphate ==
Al-Walid succeeded to the throne on the death of Hisham on 6 February 743. As heir, al-Walid was known for his open-handedness. As caliph, he took special care of the crippled and blind, increasing their stipend. He named his two sons, al-Hakam and Uthman, to succeed him in that order as documented by a letter dated 21 May 743 in al-Tabari. Tabari also quotes a number of al-Walid&#x27;s poems.

Al-Walid at first confirmed Nasr ibn Sayyar as governor of Khurasan. However, bribed by Yusuf ibn Umar, the caliph dismissed him. Al-Walid appointed his uncle Yusuf ibn Muhammad governor of Medina. At the same time, Yahya ibn Zayd, the son of Zayd ibn Ali, was found in Khurasan. Nasr urged him to present himself to the caliph, to maintain Islamic unity. However, Yahya chose another path and after initial victory was slain.

Al-Walid put Sulayman ibn Hisham in prison. Such a deed, as well as his reputed drinking, singing and immorality aroused opposition. Al-Walid was fond of versifying and he arranged horse races. The upright Yazid ibn al-Walid spoke against the new ruler&#x27;s moral laxity. A group began plotting his assassination. When approached, Khalid ibn Abdallah al-Qasri declined to join in and even cautioned al-Walid. However, his vague warning aroused al-Walid&#x27;s ire. He imprisoned Khalid and then gave him to Yusuf ibn Umar for fifty million dirhams. Yusuf tortured and killed Khalid. This intensely angered many of al-Walid&#x27;s own relatives.

During the reign of al-Walid II, Yazid ibn al-Walid spoke out against Walid&#x27;s &quot;immorality&quot; which included discrimination on behalf of the Banu Qays Arabs against Yemenis and non-Arab Muslims, and Yazid received further support from the Qadariya and Murji&#x27;iya.

Hearing of the plot, Marwan ibn Muhammad wrote from Armenia urging a more prudent course of action, one more promising for the stability of the state and the preservation of the Umayyad house. This was disregarded and many armed men moved into Damascus.

== Death ==
Yazid slipped into Damascus and deposed al-Walid in a coup, following this up with a disbursement of funds from the treasury. The caliph was besieged in a castle outside the city. He fought well, but on April 16, 744, at Al-Aghdaf, in modern Jordan, he was defeated and killed by the forces of Sulayman ibn Hisham. He was succeeded by his cousin Yazid III.

According to Yazid&#x27;s own account, Yazid sent Abd al-Aziz ibn al-Hajjaj to meet Walid at al-Bakhra. &#x27;Abd al-Aziz offered to set up a tribal assembly (&quot;shura&quot;) to decide the future of the realm. Walid rejected this offer and attacked, by which action he lost his life.
== Family ==
One of Uthman ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Sufyan&#x27;s, daughter, Atika bint Uthman ibn Muhammad, was wed to the Umayyad caliph al-Walid II. Al-Walid had also taken two singers Shuhda and Al-Nawar as concubines.

Al-Walid II had two sons, al-Hakam and Uthman. He nominated them as his successors. After the victory and accession of Yazid III, the latter had Uthman and Hakam imprisoned.

<text>Yazid ibn al-Walid ibn Abd al-Malik (; 701 – 3/4 October 744), commonly known as Yazid III, was the twelfth Umayyad caliph, ruling from 744 until his death months later.

== Birth and background ==
Yazid was the member of the influential Umayyad dynasty.
His father, al-Walid was survived by several sons: al-Ya&#x27;qubi names sixteen, while historian al-Tabari (d. 923) names nineteen. Yazid III was the grandson of great Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik and his grand mother was Wallada bint al-Abbas ibn al-Jaz al-Absiyya.

Yazid was the son of a Persian princess who had been given as a concubine to Caliph al-Walid I. His mother was Shah-i Afrid, a daughter of Peroz. Al-Tabari quotes a couplet of Yazid&#x27;s on his own ancestry:
:I am the son of Chosroes, my ancestor was Marwan,
:Caesar was my grandsire and my grandsire was Khagan.
Tabari further records descriptions of Yazid as being tall and handsome.

== Downfall of Al-Walid ==
During the reign of his cousin al-Walid II, Yazid spoke out against Walid&#x27;s &quot;immorality&quot; which included discrimination on behalf of the Banu Qays Arabs against Yemenis and non-Arab Muslims, and Yazid received further support from the Qadariya and Murji&#x27;iya (believers in human free will). Yazid slipped into Damascus and deposed Walid in a coup, following this up with a disbursement of funds from the treasury.

According to Yazid&#x27;s own account, Yazid sent Abd al-Aziz ibn al-Hajjaj ibn Abd al-Malik to meet Walid at al-Bakhra&#x27;. &#x27;Abd al-Aziz offered to set up a tribal assembly (&quot;shura&quot;) to decide the future of the realm. Walid rejected this offer and attacked, by which action he lost his life. Yazid had Walid&#x27;s head hoisted &quot;on a lance and paraded around Damascus&quot;; Yazid then imprisoned Walid&#x27;s sons &#x27;Uthman and Hakam, whom Walid had designated as his heirs.

== Accession ==
On accession, Yazid explained that he had rebelled on behalf of the Book of Allah and the Sunna of His Prophet, and that this entailed ensuring that the strong not prey upon the weak. He promised &quot;to engage in no building works, squander no money on wives or children, transfer no money from one province to another&quot; without reason, &quot;keep no troops on the field too long&quot;, and not to overtax the &quot;ahl al-dhimma&quot;; instead, he would eschew discrimination and would make his payments on time. He promised abdication if he failed to meet these goals, and held in principle to &quot;al-amr shura&quot; – to an elected caliphate.

Tabari records Yazid&#x27;s nickname &quot;the Diminisher&quot; (&quot;Naqis&quot;), given because he reduced military annuities by 10%, whereas his predecessor had promised a raise. According to Islamic popular tradition, recorded in an apocalyptic style, Yazid would go himself into the marketplace.

The city of Homs refused allegiance to Yazid, and there were several other dissident movements against him. Another cousin, Marwan ibn Muhammad ibn Marwan, governor of Armenia, had initially supported Walid and on Walid&#x27;s death entered Iraq to avenge him. Marwan eventually rallied around Yazid.

== Reign ==
Yazid appointed Mansur ibn Jumhur to replace Yusuf ibn &#x27;Umar as governor of Iraq. On May 15, Yazid wrote a letter, preserved from oral sources in al-Mada&#x27;ini (reproduced in Tabari) and in al-Baladhuri. It supports the Umayyad dynasty up to but not including &quot;the enemy of Allah&quot; al-Walid II, at which point it lays out Yazid&#x27;s version of the event at al-Bakhra&#x27;. At the end, Tabari&#x27;s rendition has Yazid exhorting the Iraqis to follow Mansur ibn Jumhur.

Yusuf ibn &#x27;Umar was subsequently imprisoned and later killed by the son of Khalid ibn &#x27;Abdallah al-Qasri. Mansur attempted to dismiss the Khurasani governor Nasr ibn Sayyar, but Nasr refused to accept this. Facing opposition from Juday al-Kirmani, Nasr invited al-Harith ibn Surayj to return from his thirteen-year stay in Turgesh territory. Al-Harith arrived wearing a fine suit of armour the Khaqan had given him and gained the support of many people in Khurasan.

== Death ==
Yazid ruled the Umayyad Caliphate from April 744 to 4 October 744. Yazid named his brother Ibrahim as his successor. Yazid fell ill of a brain tumour and died on October 3 or 4, 744. Ibrahim duly succeeded him.

<text>Center on Halsted is a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBTQ) community center in Chicago, Illinois.

The center is located in the Lakeview neighborhood on the corner of Halsted Street and Waveland, attached to Whole Foods Market. It is open every day from 8 am to 9 pm. Patrons participate in the diverse public programs and social services offered at Center on Halsted — ranging from volleyball and cooking classes to rapid HIV testing and group therapy.

==History==

In 1973, Gay Horizons was established by a group of volunteers. Over time, the organization evolved and changed its name to Horizons Community Services, becoming a comprehensive LGBT social services agency. In 2003, Horizons Community Services was renamed Center on Halsted. The core programming of Horizons Community Services remained while new services were envisioned and realized.

After a $20-million capital campaign involving 2,000 donors, Center on Halsted opened its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design-certified building in 2007 with Whole Foods as an anchor tenant and two levels of underground parking. A major contributor was Miriam Hoover (of The Hoover Company) who donated $1 million.

Major funding for the center came through private/corporate donations, with additional funding and support from the City of Chicago. The support of Chicago&#x27;s then-mayor was recognized by the construction of the Richard M. Daley Rooftop Garden.

In 2019, after protests about the previous security firm employed by the Center on Halsted, the organization changed security vendors.

==Programs and services==
Center on Halsted develops and hosts an array of public programs open to the public that provide fun, educational and enlightening opportunities for members of the LGBT community and allies. These include:
* Athletic programs: A full gymnasium used by more than 300 community members/week including five recreational leagues and activities including basketball, volleyball, hockey and yoga.

Center on Halsted works with city and state governments and an array of local providers to provide comprehensive social services to LGBT and ally community members in need including:

* Support Groups: Group meetings offering support for community members on a variety of topics including coming out, grief and loss, living with HIV and 12-step recovery.

<text>Ibrahim ibn al-Walid ibn Abd al-Malik (; died 25 January 750) was an Umayyad caliph, and a son of Caliph al-Walid I (r. 743–744). He ruled from 4 October 744 to 4 December 744. He was the penultimate Caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate.

== Background == 
Ibrahim was a son of the Umayyad caliph al-Walid I (). His mother was a slave concubine named Su&#x27;ar or Budayra.

== Reign ==
Yazid III named his brother Ibrahim as his successor. Yazid fell ill of a brain tumour and died on October 3 or 4, 744. Ibrahim duly succeeded him.
Ibrahim ruled for two months in 744 before he abdicated, and went into hiding out of fear of his political opponents. The shortness of this time and his incomplete acceptance led Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari to state that he did not succeed in becoming caliph (v. 26, p. 247). However, al-Tabari (p. 13) does record that Ibrahim as caliph did confirm the appointment of Abdallah ibn Umar as governor of Iraq (v. 27, p. 13).

== Abdication ==
Ibrahim was named heir apparent by his brother Yazid III. Marwan II decided to oppose Yazid III, and even though he later gave allegiance to Yazid, on the early death of that caliph, Marwan continued his own ambitions. Ibrahim requested and was granted Marwan&#x27;s assurance of personal safety. He travelled with Marwan to former Caliph Hisham&#x27;s residence at Rusafah in Syria. Like most members of the Umayyad family, Ibrahim was executed by the Abbasids in 750.

<text>Frederic Pujulà i Vallès () (12 November 1877 – 14 February 1962) was a Spanish journalist, dramatist, and an Esperantist and contributor to the field of Esperanto literature. Born in Palamós, Girona, he travelled through Europe and stayed for a long time in Paris. He was involved in &quot;Joventut&quot; (1900–1906), the best &quot;modernisme&quot; review of Catalonia. During World War I, he fought with the French army.

Pujulà wrote &quot;Homes Artificials&quot; (&quot;Artificial Men&quot;) which is the first short science fiction novel in the canon of Catalan literature. It was originally published in 1912, by Biblioteca Joventut in Barcelona. In this novel, the protagonist Doctor Pericart wants to obtain a new society, unsocialized and perfect. Transformed into a demigod, he creates a group of individualized androids, which will be the seeds of the new society.

In 1914, he was in Paris with his first wife, where he was organizing en International Convention of Esperanto. When that very year the 1914-1918 war broke out, he enlisted as an infantry soldier and took part at the first battles against the German army.
Later on, as he could read and write the Morse alphabet, he was transferred to Communications between detachments of the French Army. It was during this period that, as a war correspondent of the daily paper &quot;El Diluvio&quot; he wrote a series of articles in Spanish about how life was in the trenches.
When he returned to Barcelona, he was appointed Staff editor of that newspaper, which was favourable to a federal system for Spain.
When in 1941 the fascist armies entered into Barcelona, they closed &quot;El Diluvio&quot;, because Franco considered Federalism to be an offense. Consequently, Frederic Pujulà Vallès was sent to prison, together with the owner of the paper and the owner&#x27;s two sons.
Frederic Pujulà received the death penalty, which was two weeks later commuted to twenty years and one day.
At the end, he was set free two years and two months after he was imprisoned.

Pujulà died in Bargemon, France, in 1962.

<text>Pontiac&#x27;s War (also known as Pontiac&#x27;s Conspiracy or Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion) was launched in 1763 by a confederation of Native Americans who were dissatisfied with British rule in the Great Lakes region following the French and Indian War (1754–1763). Warriors from numerous nations joined in an effort to drive British soldiers and settlers out of the region. The war is named after Odawa leader Pontiac, the most prominent of many Indigenous leaders in the conflict.

The war began in May 1763 when Native Americans, alarmed by policies imposed by British General Jeffrey Amherst, attacked a number of British forts and settlements. Nine forts were destroyed, and hundreds of colonists were killed or captured, with many more fleeing the region. Hostilities came to an end after successful British Army expeditions in 1764 led to peace negotiations over the next two years. The Natives were unable to drive away the British, but the uprising prompted the British government to modify the policies that had provoked the conflict.

Warfare on the North American frontier was brutal; the killing of prisoners, the targeting of civilians, and other atrocities were widespread. In an incident that became well-known and frequently debated, British officers at Fort Pitt attempted to infect besieging Indians with blankets that had been exposed to smallpox. The ruthlessness of the conflict was a reflection of a growing racial divide between indigenous peoples and British colonists. The British government sought to prevent further racial violence by issuing the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which created a boundary between colonists and Natives.

==Naming the war==
The conflict is named after its most well-known participant, the Ottawa leader Pontiac. An early name for the war was the &quot;Giyasuta and Pontiac War,&quot; &quot;Giyasuta&quot; being an alternate spelling for Guyasuta, an influential Seneca/Mingo leader. The war became widely known as &quot;Pontiac&#x27;s Conspiracy&quot; after the 1851 publication of Francis Parkman&#x27;s &quot;The Conspiracy of Pontiac&quot;. Parkman&#x27;s book was the definitive account of the war for nearly a century and is still in print.

In the 20th century, some historians argued that Parkman exaggerated the extent of Pontiac&#x27;s influence in the conflict, so it was misleading to name the war after him. Francis Jennings (1988) wrote that &quot;Pontiac was only a local Ottawa war chief in a &#x27;resistance&#x27; involving many tribes.&quot; Alternate titles for the war have been proposed, such as &quot;Pontiac&#x27;s War for Indian Independence,&quot; the &quot;Western Indians&#x27; Defensive War&quot; and &quot;The Amerindian War of 1763.&quot; Historians generally continue to use &quot;Pontiac&#x27;s War&quot; or &quot;Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion,&quot; with some 21st-century scholars arguing that Pontiac&#x27;s importance was underestimated by 20th-century historians.
==Origins==

In the decades before Pontiac&#x27;s War, France and Great Britain participated in a series of wars in Europe that involved the French and Indian Wars in North America. The largest of these wars was the worldwide Seven Years&#x27; War, in which France lost New France in North America to Great Britain. Most fighting in the North American theater of the war, generally called the French and Indian War in the United States, or the War of Conquest (French: Guerre de la Conquête) in French Canada, came to an end after British General Jeffrey Amherst captured French Montréal in 1760.

British troops occupied forts in the Ohio Country and Great Lakes region previously garrisoned by the French. Even before the war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris (1763), the British Crown began to implement policy changes to administer its vastly expanded American territory. The French had long cultivated alliances amongst Indigenous polities, but the British post-war approach essentially treated the indigenous nations as conquered peoples. Before long, Native Americans found themselves dissatisfied with the British occupation.

===Tribes involved===

Indigenous people involved in Pontiac&#x27;s War lived in a vaguely defined region of New France known as the &quot;pays d&#x27;en haut&quot; (&quot;the upper country&quot;), which was claimed by France until the Paris peace treaty of 1763. Natives of the &quot;pays d&#x27;en haut&quot; were from many different tribal nations. These tribes were linguistic or ethnic groupings of anarchic communities rather than centralized political powers; no individual chief spoke for an entire tribe, and no nations acted in unison. For example, Ottawas did not go to war as a tribe: Some Ottawa leaders chose to do so, while other Ottawa leaders denounced the war and stayed clear of the conflict.

The tribes of the &quot;pays d&#x27;en haut&quot; consisted of three basic groups. The first group was composed of tribes of the Great Lakes region: Ottawas, Ojibwes, and Potawatomis, who spoke Algonquian languages, and Hurons, who spoke an Iroquoian language. They had long been allied with French &quot;habitants&quot; with whom they lived, traded, and intermarried. Great Lakes Indians were alarmed to learn they were under British sovereignty after the French loss of North America. When a British garrison took possession of Fort Detroit from the French in 1760, local Indians cautioned them that &quot;this country was given by God to the Indians.&quot; When the first Englishman reached Fort Michilimackinac, the Ojibwe chief Minavavana reportedly told him: &quot;Englishman, although you have conquered the French, you have not yet conquered us!&quot;

The second group was made up of tribes from eastern Illinois Country, which included Miamis, Weas, Kickapoos, Mascoutens, and Piankashaws. Like the Great Lakes tribes, these people had a long history of close relations with the French. Throughout the war, the British were unable to project military power into the Illinois Country, which was on the remote western edge of the conflict. Thus, the Illinois tribes were the last to come to terms with the British.

The third group consisted of tribes of the Ohio Country: Delawares (Lenape), Shawnees, Wyandots, and Mingos. These people had migrated to the Ohio valley earlier in the century to escape British, French, and Iroquois domination. Unlike the Great Lakes and Illinois Country tribes, Ohio tribes had no great attachment to the French regime, though they had fought as French allies in the previous war in an effort to drive away the British. They made a separate peace with the British with the understanding that the British Army would withdraw. But after the departure of the French, the British strengthened their forts rather than abandoning them, and so the Ohioans broke the peace in response.

Outside the &quot;pays d&#x27;en haut&quot;, the influential Iroquois did not, as a group, participate in Pontiac&#x27;s War because of their alliance with the British, known as the Covenant Chain. However, the westernmost Iroquois nation, the Senaca, were disillusioned with the Covenant. As early as 1761, Senecas began to send out war messages to the Great Lakes and Ohio Country tribes, urging them to unite militarily and rise against the British occupiers.

===Amherst&#x27;s policies===
General Jeffrey Amherst, the British commander-in-chief in North America, was in charge of administering policy towards American Indians, which involved military matters and regulation of the fur trade. Amherst believed that, with France out of the picture, the Indians would have to accept British rule. He also believed the Indians were incapable of offering any serious resistance to the British Army. Therefore, of the 8,000 troops under his command in North America, only about 500 were stationed in the region where the war erupted. Amherst and officers such as Major Henry Gladwin, commander at Fort Detroit, made little effort to conceal their contempt for Indians; those involved in the uprising frequently complained that the British treated them no better than slaves or dogs.

Additional Indian resentment came from Amherst&#x27;s decision in February 1761 to cut back on gifts given to the Indians. Gift giving had been an integral part of the relationship between the French and the tribes of the &quot;pays d&#x27;en haut&quot;. Following an Indian custom that carried important symbolic meaning, the French gave presents (such as guns, knives, tobacco, and clothing) to village chiefs, who distributed them to their people; this raised the chiefs&#x27; stature and so they had an incentive to maintain good relations with the Europeans. The Indians regarded material gifts as &quot;a necessary part of diplomacy which involved accepting gifts in return for others sharing their lands.&quot; Amherst, however, considered this to be little more than bribery, especially as he was under pressure to cut expenses after the war. Many Indians regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication the British looked upon them as conquered people rather than as allies.

New regulations were also issued to restrict the amount of ammunition and gunpowder that traders could sell to Indians. Unlike the French, Amherst did not trust the Indians, particularly after the &quot;Cherokee Rebellion&quot; of 1761, in which Cherokee warriors took up arms against their former British allies. The Cherokee war effort had failed due to a shortage of gunpowder; Amherst hoped future uprisings could be prevented by limiting its distribution. This created resentment and hardship because gunpowder and ammunition helped Indians provide food for their families and skins for the fur trade. Many Indians also believed the British meant to disarm them as a prelude to further conquest. Sir William Johnson, the Superintendent of the Indian Department, warned Amherst of the danger of cutting back on presents and gunpowder, to no avail.

===Land and religion===
Land was also an issue in the coming of Pontiac&#x27;s War. While the French colonists had always been relatively few, there seemed to be no end of settlers in the British colonies. Shawnees and Delawares in the Ohio Country had been displaced by British colonists in the east, and this motivated their involvement in the war. Indians in the Great Lakes region and the Illinois Country had not been greatly affected by white settlement, although they were aware of the experiences of tribes in the east. Dowd (2002) argues that most Indians involved in Pontiac&#x27;s War were not immediately threatened with displacement by white settlers, and that historians have overemphasized British colonial expansion as a cause of the war. Dowd believes that the presence, attitude, and policies of the British Army, which the Indians found threatening and insulting, were more important factors.

Also contributing to the outbreak of war was a religious awakening which swept through Indian settlements in the early 1760s. The movement was fed by discontent with the British as well as food shortages and epidemic disease. The most influential individual in this phenomenon was Neolin, known as the &quot;Delaware Prophet,&quot; who called upon Indians to shun the trade goods, alcohol, and weapons of the colonists. Melding Christian doctrines with traditional Indian beliefs, Neolin said the Master of Life was displeased with Indians for taking up the bad habits of white men, and that the British posed a threat to their very existence. &quot;If you suffer the English among you,&quot; said Neolin, &quot;you are dead men. Sickness, smallpox, and their poison [alcohol] will destroy you entirely.&quot; It was a powerful message for a people whose world was being changed by forces that seemed beyond their control.

==Outbreak of war, 1763==

===Planning the war===

Although fighting in Pontiac&#x27;s War began in 1763, rumors reached British officials as early as 1761 that discontented American Indians were planning an attack. Senecas of the Ohio Country (Mingos) circulated messages (&quot;war belts&quot; made of wampum) calling for the tribes to form a confederacy and drive away the British. The Mingos, led by Guyasuta and Tahaiadoris, were concerned about being surrounded by British forts. Similar war belts originated from Detroit and the Illinois Country. The Indians were not unified, and in June 1761, natives at Detroit informed the British commander of the Seneca plot. William Johnson held a large council with the tribes at Detroit in September 1761, which provided a tenuous peace, but war belts continued to circulate. Violence finally erupted after the Indians learned in early 1763 of the imminent French cession of the &quot;pays d&#x27;en haut&quot; to the British.

The war began at Fort Detroit under the leadership of Pontiac and quickly spread throughout the region. Eight British forts were taken; others, including Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt, were unsuccessfully besieged. Francis Parkman&#x27;s &quot;The Conspiracy of Pontiac&quot; portrayed these attacks as a coordinated operation planned by Pontiac. Parkman&#x27;s interpretation remains well known, but later historians argued there is no clear evidence the attacks were part of a master plan or overall &quot;conspiracy.&quot; Rather than being planned in advance, modern scholars believe the uprising spread as word of Pontiac&#x27;s actions at Detroit traveled throughout the &quot;pays d&#x27;en haut&quot;, inspiring discontented Indians to join the revolt. The attacks on British forts were not simultaneous: most Ohio Indians did not enter the war until nearly a month after Pontiac began the siege at Detroit.

Early historians believed French colonists had secretly instigated the war by stirring up the Indians to make trouble for the British. This belief was held by British officials at the time, but subsequent historians found no evidence of official French involvement in the uprising. According to Dowd (2002), &quot;Indians sought French intervention and not the other way around.&quot; Indian leaders frequently spoke of the imminent return of French power and the revival of the Franco-Indian alliance; Pontiac even flew a French flag in his village. Indian leaders apparently hoped to inspire the French to rejoin the struggle against the British. Although some French colonists and traders supported the uprising, the war was launched by American Indians for their own objectives.

Middleton (2007) argues that Pontiac&#x27;s vision, courage, persistence, and organizational abilities allowed him to activate an unprecedented coalition of Indian nations prepared to fight against the British. Tahaiadoris and Guyasuta originated the idea to gain independence for all Indians west of the Allegheny Mountains, although Pontiac appeared to embrace the idea by February 1763. At an emergency council meeting, he clarified his military support of the broad Seneca plan and worked to galvanize other tribes into the military operation he helped to lead, in direct contradiction to traditional Indian leadership and tribal structure. He achieved this coordination through the distribution of war belts, first to the northern Ojibwa and Ottawa near Michilimackinac, and then to the Mingo (Seneca) on the upper Allegheny River, the Ohio Delaware near Fort Pitt, and the more westerly Miami, Kickapoo, Piankashaw, and Wea peoples.

===Siege of Fort Detroit===

Pontiac spoke at a council on the banks of the Ecorse River on April 27, 1763, about 10 miles (15 km) southwest of Detroit. Using the teachings of Neolin to inspire his listeners, Pontiac convinced a number of Ottawas, Ojibwas, Potawatomis, and Hurons to join him in an attempt to seize Fort Detroit. On May 1, he visited the fort with 50 Ottawas to assess the strength of the garrison. According to a French chronicler, in a second council Pontiac proclaimed:

It is important for us, my brothers, that we exterminate from our lands this nation which seeks only to destroy us. You see as well as I that we can no longer supply our needs, as we have done from our brothers, the French... Therefore, my brothers, we must all swear their destruction and wait no longer. Nothing prevents us; they are few in numbers, and we can accomplish it.
On May 6, a small survey party under Captain CHarles Robertson was ambushed and killed on Lake St Clair by Indians; Robertson and three others (including Sir Robert Davers, 5th Baronet were killed); Davers indian slave and three others were captured On May 7, Pontiac entered Fort Detroit with about 300 men carrying concealed weapons, hoping to take the stronghold by surprise. The British had learned of his plan, however, and were armed and ready. His strategy foiled, Pontiac withdrew after a brief council and, two days later, laid siege to the fort. He and his allies killed British soldiers and settlers they found outside of the fort, including women and children. They ritually cannibalized one of the soldiers, as was the custom in some Great Lakes Indian cultures. They directed their violence at the British and generally left French colonists alone. Eventually more than 900 warriors from a half-dozen tribes joined the siege.

After receiving reinforcements, the British attempted to make a surprise attack on Pontiac&#x27;s encampment. Pontiac was ready and defeated them at the Battle of Bloody Run on July 31, 1763. The situation remained a stalemate at Fort Detroit, and Pontiac&#x27;s influence among his followers began to wane. Groups of Indians began to abandon the siege, some of them making peace with the British before departing. Pontiac lifted the siege on October 31, 1763, convinced that the French would not come to his aid at Detroit, and removed to the Maumee River where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British.

===Small forts taken===
In 1763, before other British outposts had learned of Pontiac&#x27;s siege at Detroit, Indians captured five small forts in attacks between May 16 and June 2. Additional attacks occurred up until June 19.

===Siege of Fort Pitt===
Colonists in western Pennsylvania fled to the safety of Fort Pitt after the outbreak of the war. Nearly 550 people crowded inside, including more than 200 women and children. Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss-born British officer in command, wrote that &quot;We are so crowded in the fort that I fear disease... the smallpox is among us.&quot; Delawares and others attacked the fort on June 22, 1763, and kept it under siege throughout July. Meanwhile, Delaware and Shawnee war parties raided into Pennsylvania, taking captives and killing unknown numbers of settlers. Indians sporadically fired on Fort Bedford and Fort Ligonier, smaller strongholds linking Fort Pitt to the east, but they never took them.

Before the war, Amherst had dismissed the possibility that Indians would offer any effective resistance to British rule, but that summer he found the military situation becoming increasingly grim. He wrote the commander at Fort Detroit that captured enemy Indians should &quot;immediately be put to death, their extirpation being the only security for our future safety.&quot; To Colonel Henry Bouquet, who was preparing to lead an expedition to relieve Fort Pitt, Amherst wrote on about June 29, 1763: &quot;Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among the disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them.&quot; Bouquet responded that he would try to spread smallpox to the Indians by giving them blankets that had been exposed to the disease. Amherst replied to Bouquet on July 16, endorsing the plan.

As it turned out, officers at Fort Pitt had already attempted what Amherst and Bouquet were discussing, apparently without having been ordered by Amherst or Bouquet. During a parley at Fort Pitt on June 24, Captain Ecuyer gave representatives of the besieging Delawares two blankets and a handkerchief that had been exposed to smallpox, hoping to spread the disease to the Indians and end the siege. William Trent, the fort&#x27;s militia commander, wrote in his journal that &quot;we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital. I hope it will have the desired effect.&quot; Trent submitted an invoice to the British Army, writing that the items had been &quot;taken from people in the Hospital to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians.&quot; The expense was approved by Ecuyer, and ultimately by General Thomas Gage, Amherst&#x27;s successor.

Historian and folklorist Adrienne Mayor (1995) wrote that the smallpox blanket incident &quot;has taken on legendary overtones as believers and nonbelievers continue to argue over the facts and their interpretation.&quot; Peckham (1947), Jennings (1988), and Nester (2000) concluded the attempt to deliberately infect Indians with smallpox was successful, resulting in numerous deaths that hampered the Indian war effort. Fenn (2000) argued that &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot; suggests the attempt was successful.

Other scholars have expressed doubts about whether the attempt was effective. McConnell (1992) argued the smallpox outbreak among the Indians preceded the blanket incident, with limited effect, since Indians were familiar with the disease and adept at isolating the infected. Ranlet (2000) wrote that previous historians had overlooked that the Delaware chiefs who handled the blankets were in good health a month later; he believed the attempt to infect the Indians had been a &quot;total failure.&quot; Dixon (2005) argued that if the scheme had been successful, the Indians would have broken off the siege of Fort Pitt, but they kept it up for weeks after receiving the blankets. Medical writers have expressed reservations about the efficacy of spreading smallpox through blankets and the difficulty of determining if the outbreak was intentional or naturally occurring.

===Bushy Run and Devil&#x27;s Hole===
On August 1, 1763, most of the Indians broke off the siege at Fort Pitt to intercept 500 British troops marching to the fort under Colonel Bouquet. On August 5, these two forces met at the Battle of Bushy Run. Although his force suffered heavy casualties, Bouquet fought off the attack and relieved Fort Pitt on August 20, bringing the siege to an end. His victory at Bushy Run was celebrated by the British; church bells rang through the night in Philadelphia, and King George praised him.

This victory was followed by a costly defeat. Fort Niagara, one of the most important western forts, was not assaulted, but on September 14, 1763, at least 300 Senecas, Ottawas, and Ojibwas attacked a supply train along the Niagara Falls portage. Two companies sent from Fort Niagara to rescue the supply train were also defeated. More than 70 soldiers and teamsters were killed in these actions, which colonists dubbed the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Hole Massacre,&quot; the deadliest engagement for British soldiers during the war.

==Paxton Boys==

The violence and terror of Pontiac&#x27;s War convinced many Pennsylvanians that their government was not doing enough to protect them. This discontentment was manifested most seriously in an uprising led by a vigilante group known as the Paxton Boys, so-called because they were primarily from the area around the Pennsylvania village of Paxton (or Paxtang). The Paxton Boys turned their anger towards the Susquehannock and the Moravian Lenape and Mohican who lived peacefully in small enclaves near white Pennsylvanian settlements. Prompted by rumors that a raiding party had been seen at the Susquehannock village of Conestoga Town, a group of 50 or more Paxton Boys rode there on December 14, 1763 and murdered the six individuals they found there. Pennsylvania officials placed the remaining 14 Susquehannock in protective custody in Lancaster, but the Paxton Boys broke into the workhouse on December 27 and killed them. Governor John Penn issued bounties for the ringleaders, but none of the Paxton Boys were arrested.

The Paxton Boys then set their sights on the Moravian Lenape and Mohican, who had been brought to Philadelphia for protection. Several hundred Paxton Boys and their followers marched on Philadelphia in February 1764, but the presence of British troops and Philadelphia associators dissuaded them from committing more violence. Benjamin Franklin, who had helped organize the defense, negotiated with the Paxton leaders and brought an end to the crisis. Afterwards, Franklin published a scathing indictment of the Paxton Boys. &quot;If an &quot;Indian&quot; injures me,&quot; he asked, &quot;does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all &quot;Indians&quot;?&quot;

==British response, 1764–1766==
Indian raids on frontier settlements escalated in the spring and summer of 1764. The hardest hit colony was Virginia, where more than 100 settlers were killed. On May 26 in Maryland, 15 colonists working in a field near Fort Cumberland were killed. On June 14, about 13 settlers near Fort Loudoun in Pennsylvania were killed and their homes burned. The most notorious raid occurred on July 26, when four Delaware warriors killed and scalped a school teacher and ten children in what is now Franklin County, Pennsylvania. Incidents such as these prompted the Pennsylvania Assembly, with the approval of Governor Penn, to reintroduce the scalp bounties offered during the French and Indian War, which paid money for every enemy Indian killed above the age of ten, including women.

General Amherst, held responsible for the uprising by the Board of Trade, was recalled to London in August 1763 and replaced by Major General Thomas Gage. In 1764, Gage sent two expeditions into the west to crush the rebellion, rescue British prisoners, and arrest the Indians responsible for the war. According to historian Fred Anderson, Gage&#x27;s campaign, which had been designed by Amherst, prolonged the war for more than a year because it focused on punishing the Indians rather than ending the war. Gage&#x27;s one significant departure from Amherst&#x27;s plan was to allow William Johnson to conduct a peace treaty at Niagara, giving Indians an opportunity to &quot;bury the hatchet.&quot;

===Fort Niagara treaty===
From July to August 1764, Johnson conducted a treaty at Fort Niagara with about 2,000 Indians in attendance, primarily Iroquois. Although most Iroquois had stayed out of the war, Senecas from the Genesee River valley had taken up arms against the British, and Johnson worked to bring them back into the Covenant Chain alliance. As restitution for the Devil&#x27;s Hole ambush, the Senecas were compelled to cede the strategically important Niagara portage to the British. Johnson even convinced the Iroquois to send a war party against the Ohio Indians. This Iroquois expedition captured a number of Delawares and destroyed abandoned Delaware and Shawnee towns in the Susquehanna Valley, but otherwise the Iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as Johnson had desired.

===Two expeditions===
Having secured the area around Fort Niagara, the British launched two military expeditions into the west. The first expedition, led by Colonel John Bradstreet, was to travel by boat across Lake Erie and reinforce Detroit. Bradstreet was to subdue the Indians around Detroit before marching south into the Ohio Country. The second expedition, commanded by Colonel Bouquet, was to march west from Fort Pitt and form a second front in the Ohio Country.

Bradstreet left Fort Schlosser in early August 1764 with about 1,200 soldiers and a large contingent of Indian allies enlisted by Sir William Johnson. Bradstreet felt that he did not have enough troops to subdue enemy Indians by force, and so when strong winds on Lake Erie forced him to stop at Fort Presque Isle on August 12, he decided to negotiate a treaty with a delegation of Ohio Indians led by Guyasuta. Bradstreet exceeded his authority by conducting a peace treaty rather than a simple truce, and by agreeing to halt Bouquet&#x27;s expedition, which had not yet left Fort Pitt. Gage, Johnson, and Bouquet were outraged when they learned what Bradstreet had done. Gage rejected the treaty, believing that Bradstreet had been duped into abandoning his offensive in the Ohio Country. Gage may have been correct: the Ohio Indians did not return prisoners as promised in a second meeting with Bradstreet in September, and some Shawnees were trying to enlist French aid in order to continue the war.

Bradstreet continued westward, unaware his unauthorized diplomacy was angering his superiors. He reached Fort Detroit on August 26, where he negotiated another treaty. In an attempt to discredit Pontiac, who was not present, Bradstreet chopped up a peace belt Pontiac had sent to the meeting. According to historian Richard White, &quot;such an act, roughly equivalent to a European ambassador&#x27;s urinating on a proposed treaty, had shocked and offended the gathered Indians.&quot; Bradstreet also claimed the Indians had accepted British sovereignty as a result of his negotiations, but Johnson believed this had not been fully explained to the Indians and that further councils would be needed. Bradstreet had successfully reinforced and reoccupied British forts in the region, but his diplomacy proved to be controversial and inconclusive.

Colonel Bouquet, delayed in Pennsylvania while mustering the militia, finally set out from Fort Pitt on October 3, 1764, with 1,150 men. He marched to the Muskingum River in the Ohio Country, within striking distance of a number of Indian villages. Treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, so the Ohio Indians were isolated and, with some exceptions, ready to make peace. In a council which began on October 17, Bouquet demanded that the Ohio Indians return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into Indian families. Not all of the captives were present, so the Indians were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned. The Ohio Indians agreed to attend a more formal peace conference with William Johnson, which was finalized in July 1765.

===Treaty with Pontiac===
Although the military conflict essentially ended with the 1764 expeditions, Indians still called for resistance in the Illinois Country, where British troops had yet to take possession of Fort de Chartres from the French. A Shawnee war chief named Charlot Kaské emerged as the most strident anti-British leader in the region, temporarily surpassing Pontiac in influence. Kaské traveled as far south as New Orleans in an effort to enlist French aid against the British.

In 1765, the British decided that the occupation of the Illinois Country could only be accomplished by diplomatic means. As Gage commented to one of his officers, he was determined to have &quot;none our enemy&quot; among the Indian peoples, and that included Pontiac, to whom he now sent a wampum belt suggesting peace talks. Pontiac had become less militant after hearing of Bouquet&#x27;s truce with the Ohio country Indians. Johnson&#x27;s deputy, George Croghan, accordingly traveled to the Illinois country in the summer of 1765, and although he was injured along the way in an attack by Kickapoos and Mascoutens, he managed to meet and negotiate with Pontiac. While Charlot Kaské wanted to burn Croghan at the stake, Pontiac urged moderation and agreed to travel to New York, where he made a formal treaty with William Johnson at Fort Ontario on July 25, 1766. It was hardly a surrender: no lands were ceded, no prisoners returned, and no hostages were taken. Rather than accept British sovereignty, Kaské left British territory by crossing the Mississippi River with other French and Native refugees.

==Aftermath==
The total loss of life resulting from Pontiac&#x27;s War is unknown. About 400 British soldiers were killed in action and perhaps 50 were captured and tortured to death. George Croghan estimated that 2,000 settlers had been killed or captured, a figure sometimes repeated as 2,000 settlers &quot;killed&quot;. The violence compelled approximately 4,000 settlers from Pennsylvania and Virginia to flee. American Indian losses went mostly unrecorded, but it has been estimated at least 200 warriors were killed in battle, with additional deaths if germ warfare initiated at Fort Pitt was successful.

Pontiac&#x27;s War has traditionally been portrayed as a defeat for the Indians, but scholars now usually view it as a military stalemate: while the Indians had failed to drive away the British, the British were unable to conquer the Indians. Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought an end to the war. The Indians had won a victory of sorts by compelling the British government to abandon Amherst&#x27;s policies and create a relationship with the Indians modeled on the Franco-Indian alliance.

Relations between British colonists and American Indians, which had been severely strained during the French and Indian War, reached a new low during Pontiac&#x27;s War. According to Dixon (2005), &quot;Pontiac&#x27;s War was unprecedented for its awful violence, as both sides seemed intoxicated with genocidal fanaticism.&quot; Richter (2001) characterizes the Indian attempt to drive out the British, and the effort of the Paxton Boys to eliminate Indians from their midst, as parallel examples of ethnic cleansing. People on both sides of the conflict had come to the conclusion that colonists and natives were inherently different and could not live with each other. According to Richter, the war saw the emergence of &quot;the novel idea that all Native people were &#x27;Indians,&#x27; that all Euro-Americans were &#x27;Whites,&#x27; and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other.&quot;

The British government also came to the conclusion that colonists and Indians must be kept apart. On October 7, 1763, the Crown issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, an effort to reorganize British North America after the Treaty of Paris. The Proclamation, already in the works when Pontiac&#x27;s War erupted, was hurriedly issued after news of the uprising reached London. Officials drew a boundary line between the British colonies and American Indian lands west of the Appalachian Mountains, creating a vast &quot;Indian Reserve&quot; that stretched from the Appalachians to the Mississippi River and from Florida to Quebec. By forbidding colonists from trespassing on Indian lands, the British government hoped to avoid more conflicts like Pontiac&#x27;s War. &quot;The Royal Proclamation,&quot; writes Calloway (2006), &quot;reflected the notion that segregation not interaction should characterize Indian-white relations.&quot;

The effects of Pontiac&#x27;s War were long-lasting. Because the Proclamation officially recognized that indigenous people had certain rights to the lands they occupied, it has been called a Native American &quot;Bill of Rights,&quot; and still informs the relationship between the Canadian government and First Nations. For British colonists and land speculators, however, the Proclamation seemed to deny them the fruits of victory—western lands—that had been won in the war with France. This created resentment, undermining colonial attachment to the Empire and contributing to the coming of the American Revolution. According to Calloway, &quot;Pontiac&#x27;s Revolt was not the last American war for independence—American colonists launched a rather more successful effort a dozen years later, prompted in part by the measures the British government took to try to prevent another war like Pontiac&#x27;s.&quot;

For American Indians, Pontiac&#x27;s War demonstrated the possibilities of pan-tribal cooperation in resisting Anglo-American colonial expansion. Although the conflict divided tribes and villages, the war also saw the first extensive multi-tribal resistance to European colonization in North America, and the first war between Europeans and American Indians that did not end in complete defeat for the Indians. The Proclamation of 1763 ultimately did not prevent British colonists and land speculators from expanding westward, and so Indians found it necessary to form new resistance movements. Beginning with conferences hosted by Shawnees in 1767, in the following decades leaders such as Joseph Brant, Alexander McGillivray, Blue Jacket, and Tecumseh would attempt to forge confederacies that would revive the resistance efforts of Pontiac&#x27;s War.

<text>Marwan ibn Muhammad ibn Marwan (; – 6 August 750), commonly known as Marwan II, was the fourteenth and last caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate, ruling from 744 until his death. His reign was dominated by a civil war, and he was the last Umayyad ruler to rule the united Caliphate before the Abbasid Revolution toppled the Umayyad dynasty.

==Birth and background==
Marwan ibn Muhammad was a member of the Marwanid household of the Umayyad Caliphate. His grandmother was named Zaynab. Marwan&#x27;s father was Muhammad ibn Marwan, who was the son of the fourth Umayyad Caliph Marwan I (), and hence half-brother to fifth Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan ().

His mother was a woman who&#x27;s mostly unnamed, however sometimes is called Rayya or Tarubah, and is likely of non-Arab origin (a Kurd according to most accounts). Some have referenced that his mother was already pregnant with Marwan before his legal father, Muhammad, bed her, thus making the child not his. A couple sources report that Muhammad had taken her captive during the suppression of Ibn al-Zubayr&#x27;s revolt, prior to her capture she was either the slave of Ibn al-Zubayr or of his cook, Zumri. These two men were believed to be Marwan&#x27;s real biological father by Umayyad contenders. There is much doubt and dispute on his mother&#x27;s name but she was most commonly known as Umm Marwan (meaning &quot;Mother of Marwan&quot;).

==Early life==
In 732–733, Caliph Hisham appointed Marwan governor of Armenia. In 735–736, Marwan invaded Georgia, devastated it and then took three fortresses of the Alans and made peace with Tumanshah. In 739–740, he launched further raids and obtained tribute.

In 744–745, on hearing news of the plot to overthrow al-Walid II, Marwan wrote to his relatives from Armenia strongly discouraging this. He urged them to harmoniously preserve the stability and well-being of the Umayyad house, however, this was disregarded and many armed men moved into Damascus. Yazid slipped into Damascus and deposed al-Walid in a coup, following this up with a disbursement of funds from the treasury.

Reportedly, Marwan II, who for several years had supervised the campaigns against the Byzantines and the Khazars on the Caliphate&#x27;s northwestern frontiers, had considered claiming the caliphate at the death of al-Walid II, but a Kalbi rebellion had forced him to wait. Instead, Yazid III appointed him governor to Upper Mesopotamia and he took up residence in the Qays-dominated city of Harran. Throughout Yazid III&#x27;s Caliphate Marwan remained a governor and he didn&#x27;t claim the throne for himself.

==Reign==
When Yazid III persisted in overthrowing al-Walid II, Marwan at first opposed him, then rendered allegiance to him. On Yazid&#x27;s early death (Yazid named his brother Ibrahim ibn al-Walid as his successor. Yazid fell ill of a brain tumour), Marwan renewed his ambitions, ignored Yazid&#x27;s named successor Ibrahim, and became caliph. Ibrahim initially hid, then requested Marwan give him assurances of personal safety. This Marwan granted and Ibrahim even accompanied the new caliph to Hisham&#x27;s residence of Rusafah.

Marwan named his two sons Ubaydallah and Abdullah heirs. He appointed governors and proceeded to assert his authority by force. However, the anti-Umayyad feeling was very prevalent, especially in Iran and Iraq. The Abbasids had gained much support. As such, Marwan&#x27;s reign as caliph was almost entirely devoted to trying to keep the Umayyad empire together.

Marwan took Emesa (Homs) after a bitter ten-month siege. Al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Shaybani led a Kharijite rebellion. He defeated the Syrian forces and took Kufa. Sulayman ibn Hisham turned against Marwan, but suffered a severe defeat. The Kharijites advanced on Mosul and were defeated. Sulayman joined them. Al-Dahhak&#x27;s successor al-Khaybari was initially successful in pushing back Marwan&#x27;s center and even took the caliph&#x27;s camp and sat on his carpet. However, he and those with him fell into fighting in the camp. Shayban succeeded him. Marwan pursued him and Sulayman to Mosul and besieged them there for six months. Then, reinforced, the caliph drove them out. Shayban fled to Bahrayn where he was killed; Sulayman sailed to India.

In Khurasan there was internal discord, with the Umayyad governor Nasr ibn Sayyar facing opposition from al-Harith and al-Kirmani. They also fought each other. In addition, Abbasid envoys arrived. There had long been religious fervor and a kind of messianic expectation of Abbasid ascendency. During Ramadan of 747 (16 May – 14 June), the Abbasids unfurled the standards of their revolt. Nasr sent his retainer Yazid against them. Yazid, however, was bested, taken, and held captive. He was impressed by the Abbasids and when released told Nasr he wanted to join them, but his obligations to Nasr brought him back.

Fighting continued throughout Khurasan with the Abbasids gaining increasing ascendency. Finally, Nasr fell sick and died at Rayy on 9 November 748 at the age of eighty-five.

Marwan campaigned in Egypt in 749 to quell the Bashmuric Revolt and secure his rear, but his campaign was a failure. The Abbasids, meanwhile, achieved success in the Hijaz. Marwan suffered a decisive defeat by Abu al-Abbas al-Saffah on the banks of the Great Zab, called Battle of the Zab. At this battle alone, over 300 members of the Umayyad family died. Marwan fled, leaving Damascus, Jordan and Palestine and reaching Egypt, where he was caught and killed on 6 August 750. His heirs Ubaydallah and Abdallah escaped to modern Eritrea. Abdallah died in fighting there.

Marwan&#x27;s death signaled the end of Umayyad fortunes in the East and was followed by the mass killing of Umayyads by the Abbasids. Almost the entire Umayyad dynasty was killed, except for the prince Abd ar-Rahman who escaped to Spain and founded an Umayyad dynasty there. In Egypt, Marwan&#x27;s tongue was fed to a cat.

==Physical description==
Marwan was known to be of a fair complexion, with blue eyes, a big beard, big headed and of medium height. He did not dye his beard with Henna and left it white.

<text>Catalan literature (or Valencian literature) is the name conventionally used to refer to literature written in the Catalan language. The focus of this article is not just the literature of Catalonia, but literature written in Catalan from anywhere, so that it includes writers from Andorra, the Valencian Community, Balearic Islands and other territories where any Catalan variant is spoken.

The Catalan literary tradition is extensive, starting in the early Middle Ages. A Romantic revivalist movement of the 19th century, Renaixença, classified Catalan literature in periods. The centuries long chapter known as &quot;Decadència&quot; that followed the golden age of Valencian literature, was perceived as extremely poor and lacking literary works of quality. Further attempts to explain why this happened (see History of Catalonia) have motivated new critical studies of the period, and nowadays a revalorisation of this early modern age is taking place. Catalan literature reemerged in the 19th and early 20th centuries, to experience troubled times from the start of the Spanish Civil War on. Many intellectuals were forced into exile and Catalan culture was repressed. However, this repression began to temper after the end of World War II. Catalan was repressed until Francisco Franco&#x27;s death and the end of his dictatorship in 1975. Then, a development towards officiality and presence in schools and media started to this day.

==Middle Ages==

===Origins===
Catalan, a Romance language, evolved from Vulgar Latin in the Middle Ages, when it became a separate language from Latin. Literary use of the Catalan language is generally said to have started with the religious text known as Homilies d&#x27;Organyà, written either in late 11th or early 12th century, though the earlier &quot;Cançó de Santa Fe&quot;, from 1054–76, may be Catalan or Occitan. Another early Catalan poem is the mid-13th century &quot;Augats, seyós qui credets Déu lo Payre&quot;, a &quot;planctus Mariae&quot; (lament of Mary).

Ramon Llull (13th century), one of the major medieval Majorcan writers in the Catalan language is not only saluted for starting a Catalan literary tradition clearly separated from the Occitan-speaking world of the time, but also credited with enriching the language with his coining of a large number of words, and his philosophy. See (including the famed ) and Blanquerna (including Llibre d&#x27;Amic e Amat) for more details on his works.

===&quot;Les quatre grans cròniques&quot;===
These four major literary works are chronicles written between the 13th and 14th centuries narrating the deeds of the monarchs and leading figures of the Crown of Aragon. They are the following:
*Crònica de Jaume I, also known as &quot;The book of deeds&quot; (see External links)
*Crònica de Bernat Desclot, also known as &quot;Book of the king, Peter of Aragon&quot;.
*Crònica de Ramon Muntaner
*Crònica de Pere el Cerimoniós

===Lyric poetry===
The first widespread vernacular writing in any Romance language was the lyric poetry of the troubadours, who composed in Occitan. Since Occitan and Catalan are often indistinguishable before the 14th century, it is not surprising that many Catalans composed in the Occitan poetic koiné. The first Catalan troubadour (&quot;trobadors&quot;) may be Berenguier de Palazol, active around 1150, who wrote only &quot;cançons&quot; (love songs in the courtly tradition). Guerau III de Cabrera and Guillem de Berguedà, active in the generation after, were noted exponents of the &quot;ensenhamen&quot; and &quot;sirventes&quot; genres respectively. During this early period Occitan literature was patronised by the rulers of Catalonia—not surprisingly considering their wide involvement in Occitanian politics and as Counts of Provence. Alfonso II patronised many composers, not just from Catalonia, and even wrote Occitan poetry himself. The tradition of royal troubadours continued with his descendants Peter III James II of Aragon, the anonymous known only as &quot;Lo bord del rei d&#x27;Arago&quot;, and Frederick II of Sicily. The most prolific Catalan troubadour during the ascendancy of Occitan as language of literature, was Cerverí de Girona, who left behind more than one hundred works. He was the most prolific troubadour of any nationality.

In the early 13th century, Raimon Vidal, from Besalú, composed his poetic grammar, the &quot;Razos de trobar&quot; (&quot;Purposes of Composition&quot;). This was the earliest and perhaps most influential Occitan lyric treatise. The troubadour lyric followed the Catalans to Sicily later in the century, where Jaufre de Foixa composed a &quot;Regles de trobar&quot; (&quot;Rules for Composing&quot;) modelled on Vidal&#x27;s earlier work. A third Catalan treatise on the language of the troubadours and composing lyric poetry, the &quot;Mirall de trobar&quot; (&quot;Mirror of Composition&quot;), was written by a Majorcan, Berenguer d&#x27;Anoia.

The first golden age of this language was developed in the Kingdom of Valencia around the 15th century under the variant of &quot;Valenciano&quot; . The Catalan language consolidated and clearly differentiated, even in lyrical poetry, from Occitan language. The prose is widely cultivated, with influences from Italian humanism. Authors as the humanist Bernat Metge the preacher Vincent Ferrer, Francesc Eiximenis or Anselm Turmeda write works now considered as classical models of Catalan prose. The narrative and the fiction are shown in novels as &#x27;, &#x27; or the chivalric roman &quot;Curial i Güelfa&quot;. In the 15th century the main centre of literary production is Valencia: the lyric poetry has outstanding Petrarchian poets: Jordi de Sant Jordi or Ausiàs Marc, or the elaborate poetry and prose of Joan Roís de Corella. In fiction could be outlined Jaume Roig&#x27;s &quot;Espill&quot; or &quot;Tirant lo Blanc&quot;.

===Tirant lo Blanc===

Written by the Valencian writer Joanot Martorell, this epic romance was among its time&#x27;s most influential novels, and possibly the last major book in Catalan literature until the 19th century.

==Modern era==

===La Decadència===

The early modern period (late 15th-18th centuries), while extremely productive for Castilian writers of the Spanish Golden Age, was termed &quot;La Decadència&quot; by 19th century Catalan scholars and writers. This &quot;decadent&quot; period in Catalan literature came about because of a general decline in the use of the vernacular language and a lack of patronage among the nobility as Aragonese institutions declined. The Catalan-language decadence accompanied the rise of Catalan commercial influence in the Spanish Empire in which the use of Spanish language was essential after the dynastic union that resulted from the marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in 1474. Today, this is seen as a romantic view made popular by writers and thinkers of the 19th century national awakening movement known as Renaixença. The presumed period of decadence is being contested with the appearance of recent cultural and literary studies showing that there were indeed literary works of note in the period, from authors such as , , Francesc Vicenç Garcia, Francesc Fontanella and Joan Ramis, among others.

===Renaixença===

The first Romantics in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands chose Spanish as their language, and did not resort to using the Catalan language until a national awakening movement, kickstarted by Romantic nationalism, appeared. The foundation of the basis of the movement is most often credited to Bonaventura Carles Aribau with his &quot;Oda a la Pàtria&quot;. &quot;Renaixença&quot; or &quot;rebirth&quot;. Literary Renaixença shares with European Romanticism most of its traits, but created a style of its own through its admiration of the Middle Ages and its will to embellish the language and the need to create a new common standard. Realism and naturalism deeply influenced later authors. Their most important adherents were indeed Jacint Verdaguer, who penned Catalonia&#x27;s national epic, and Àngel Guimerà, whose plays were translated and performed around Europe.

===Modernisme===

Literary Catalan modernisme was the natural follow-up of Renaixença, still showing Romantic traits and influences while focusing on dark themes, such as violence or the dark side of life and nature. As for poetry, it closely followed the style of Parnassians and Symbolists. The movement was subdivided into authors in whose work prevailed darker decadentism themes, classed under the name &quot;Bohèmia Negra&quot;, and those whose career embraced Aestheticism, known as participants of &quot;Bohèmia Daurada&quot; or &quot;Bohèmia Rosa&quot;. Santiago Rusiñol, Joan Maragall and Joan Puig i Ferreter were some of its most influential adherents. Furthermore, it is necessary to allude to the seminal work of Miquel Costa i Llobera and Joan Alcover, Balearic poets who developed their work parallel to the heyday of Art Nouveau, whilst raising a conception of literature certainly antagonistic relative to them, and more comparable to classical poetry.

===Noucentisme===

The cultural and political movement known as Noucentisme appeared in the early 20th century, a time of great economic growth in Catalonia, as a mostly conservative reaction against Modernisme and the Avantgarde, both in art and thought. Its Classicism was framed as a &quot;return to beauty.&quot; The love of elaborated form, along with its much sought perfection of language, was accused by &quot;modernistes&quot; of being excessively affected and artificial. Poetry was its preferred genre, as evidenced by Josep Carner or Carles Riba&#x27;s masterpieces.

===Francoist Spain, exile and political transition===
After what seemed to be a period of hope and rapid growth, the Spanish Civil War and the establishment of Francoist Spain (starting in 1939) forced many Catalan leftist intellectuals into exile, as many of them faced political persecution.

During the initial years of Francoist Spain the use of Catalan in the media became frowned upon. Publishing in Catalan never ceased completely, though, even though only a few notable authors like Salvador Espriu did publish in this language in the first years of Francoist Spain.
Those initial political restrictions on publishing in Catalan relaxed over time. By the 1950s publishing in Catalan was no longer extraordinary; by the 1960s it had become possible without restrictions other than the ideological ones which applied to all of Spain.

Some literary awards in Catalan had been established as early as 1947 (&quot;Premi Joanot Martorell&quot;). Also by the end of the 1940s well known authors such as Josep Maria de Sagarra were publishing again in Catalan (among others, &quot;El prestigi dels morts&quot;, 1946, &quot;L&#x27;Hereu i la forastera&quot;, 1949). Many other literary awards followed, like the &quot;Premi Carles de la Riba&quot; (1950), the &quot;Victor Català&quot; (1953) or the &quot;Lletra d&#x27;Or&quot; (1956). Since 1951, the most remarkable literary contest in Catalonia at the time (the &quot;Premio Ciudad de Barcelona&quot;) accepted originals in Catalan.

In 1962, Mercè Rodoreda published &quot;The Time of the Doves&quot;, possibly the book which paved the way of modern Catalan literature, since it could enjoy wider recognition due to the new media and the spreading of literacy in this language. In 1963, Spain won an international song contest with a piece sung in Catalan.

Later on that decade Josep Pla published what has been considered the masterpiece of the contemporary literature in Catalan, the seminal &quot;El Quadern Gris&quot; (1966). The Catalan cultural association Òmnium Cultural, which had been established in 1961, could begin its work in favour of Catalan literature by 1967 onwards. Salvador Espriu, who had published most of his works in Catalan, was a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1971.

After the transition to democracy (1975–1978) and the restoration of the Catalan regional government &quot;Generalitat&quot; (1980), literary life and the editorial market have returned to normality and literary production in Catalan is being bolstered with a number of language policies intended to protect Catalan culture. Besides the aforementioned authors, other relevant 20th-century writers of the Francoist and democracy periods include Joan Brossa, Agustí Bartra, Manuel de Pedrolo, Pere Calders or Quim Monzó, Jesús Moncada or, in 21st century, Jaume Cabré or Albert Sánchez Piñol. The number of twenty-first century women writers increases like Dolors Miquel, Núria Perpinyà or Irene Solà.

<doc id="437441" wikidata="Q7515000" url="?curid=437441" title="Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council">
<text>Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council (#055) is a Boy Scouts of America council headquartered in San Jose, California. It was the result of a council merger between the Santa Clara County Council and the Monterey Bay Area Council. In 2004, the previous two councils served over 11,000 youth in over 400 Boy Scout troops, Cub Scout packs, Venturing crews, and Explorer posts. In 2012, the Monterey Bay Area Council announced that after 89 years as a separate council, it had agreed to merge back into the Santa Clara County Council. , the council served 13,000 youth in four different counties.

==Organization==
The council is divided into districts:
* Coyote Creek - Serves the City of Milpitas South into East San Jose in the communities of Alum Rock, Berryessa, Evergreen, Silver Creek, West to Monterey Highway including a good portion of downtown San Jose, including the neighborhoods of Naglee Park and Japan Town.
* Quicksilver - Serves the area of Gilroy, Morgan Hill, San Martin, Willow Glen, Blossom Valley, Almaden Valley, East and South San Jose.
* Pioneer - serves the communities of North San Jose, Santa Clara, Western San Jose, Campbell, Los Gatos, Monte Sereno and Redwood Estates.
* Polaris - serves the communities of Sunnyvale, Cupertino, and Saratoga.
* Loma Prieta - Santa Cruz County, plus Royal Oaks and Aromas
* San Benito - San Benito County, except Aromas
* Santa Lucia - Monterey County, except Royal Oaks

==History==
The San Jose Council of the Boy Scouts of America was founded on August 20, 1920 by John Crummey (president of Bean Spray and Pump Company, later known as Food Machinery Corporation), Robert Bentley, Jr. (president of Muirson Label Company) and Archer Bowden (San Jose attorney). Bentley served as the first council president, Julius Rainwater was the first scout executive, and Edmund Richmond was the first council commissioner.

In 1922, the council changed its name to Santa Clara County Council, and took over administration for all of Santa Clara County. The council was incorporated in 1923, and oversight of San Benito County was added the same year. Monterey and Santa Cruz counties were added in 1927.

In 1933 San Benito, Santa Cruz and Monterey counties were split off to form the Monterey Bay Area Council. In 1939 the area around Palo Alto split off to form its own council, the now-defunct Stanford Area Council. That council, which had been one of the smaller BSA councils in the nation by area, merged with San Mateo County Council in the 1990s to form Pacific Skyline Council.

===Monterey Bay Area Council===
The Monterey Bay Area Council was formed in 1933, when San Benito, Santa Cruz and Monterey counties were split off from the Santa Clara County Council. The council grew and was given the land for Camp Pico Blanco in 1948 by William Randolph Hearst. After the separation, they shared borders on two sides.

====Council merger====

The Santa Clara Council had successfully balanced its budget from 2002 to 2012 and had attracted new membership every month for nearly four years. It was recognized by the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America as a Centennial Quality Council every year from 2006 and 2010 and was a Gold level Journey to Excellence Council in 2011.

The Monterey Bay Area Council was on “conditional charters” during 2010 and 2011 and was given specific goals to balance its budget and increase its membership. The Council failed to reach those goals and in 2012 the national BSA gave the Monterey Bay Area Council a “transitional charter” and instructed it to seek a merger. In July 2012, the Monterey Bay Area Council announced it would be merging with the Santa Clara County Council. The announcement attributed the merger in large part to more than a million dollars in debt accumulated by the Monterey Bay Area Council. Expenses included the construction of a fish ladder and a new dining lodge at Camp Pico Blanco. The Monterey Bay Area Council had also experienced continuous declining enrollment. In early 2012, the existing council board asked the Santa Clara County Council to operate the council while the merger was underway.

The Santa Clara Council formed a committee to complete the merger and study which of the three camps it will continue to own—Camp Pico Blanco, Camp Hi-Sierra, and Chesebrough Scout Reservation. In September 2012, the combined councils announced that over 75 names had been suggested by volunteers for the new council, and that from among these names they had chosen Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council as the combined council&#x27;s name. The merger was finalized in December 2012.

==Council camps==
The new council currently operates three camps and has operated several others in the past. As a result of the merger with the Monterey Bay Area Council, the Santa Clara Council studied which of the three camps it would continue to operate. , it is operating Camp Hi-Sierra and Chesebrough Scout Reservation. Camp Pico Blanco was in operation until a road failure in 2017 forced the camp to close. The council put the camp on the market in April 2022.

===Camp Hi-Sierra===
Camp Hi-Sierra is located in the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range, minutes from the small town of Long Barn, California. This camp is at notably high altitude, with the majority of its buildings standing at approximately and the highest point of the mountain standing over a mile high at . The camp is used year-round with six weeks of Scouting camp during the summer. In the past it has played host to International Rendezvous, and is hosting one in the summer of 2025. During the &#x27;off season&#x27; Camp Hi-Sierra is used for training sessions as well as council activities.

====History====
Camp Hi-Sierra was created in 1949 with land that the Santa Clara County Council bought within the Stanislaus National Forest. Before the camp was a Scout Reservation though it was inhabited by the Miwok Indians. When logging scions discovered the forest, they decided to start logging in the spot where the camp is now located. To this day, as one walks through camp, they can still see remnants of the logging industry such as parts of the old mill. Small-scale logging continues along the main camp road.

The Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council maintains the camp as well and a full-time ranger lives in the camp throughout the year. He is the caretaker for all of Camp Hi-Sierra. 

====Location====
This camp is located within the Stanislaus National Forest. Its official postal address is in nearby Long Barn, California, although it is about one mile southeast of Cold Springs, California. The turn-off is about 30 miles East of Sonora and nearly one mile West of Cold Springs Market on State Route 108. The tourist town of Pinecrest, California and its popular Pinecrest Lake are approximately five miles further East on Hwy 108.

====Facilities====
Buildings at Camp Hi-Sierra include a staff bunkhouse, dining hall, office, and other structures. The camp is bisected by the North Fork of the Tuolumne River. On the western side is Staff Hill, home to the camp staff during the summertime. Also, this side contains the camp office, health lodge, dining hall, flag meadow, and the ranger&#x27;s home. On the southernmost end of the camp property is a small seasonal man-made lake.

On the eastern side of camp is the Blackfoot Meadow, home to the baseball diamond. Directly across from Blackfoot Meadow is the archery range. Also near the meadow is the frisbee disc golf course. Further south is the high adventure area; this includes the bike barn and rock climbing tower. Across from the climbing wall (built in 2016) is the trading post, which was built in 2005. Next to the high adventure area is the Trail to Eagle area (also called Treagle) and beyond that the Scoutcraft area. Opposite from Scoutcraft is the &quot;livery&quot;, home of the craft shop. Behind this is the Nature area, formerly the High-Adventure Base. The log cabin has now been converted into the nature cabin, with space on the second floor for storage and a workspace, formerly a sleeping area.

Across the path from the Nature area is Foxfire. On this fenced-in property, there is a tipi for Indian lore classes and a blacksmith shop with a coal forge and three anvils. This is home of the Mountain Man program, where scouts can learn blacksmithing, woodcarving, and tomahawk throwing.

The eastern side of the river contains all of the scout camps, where 250-350 scouts can be housed in tents. High on the hill are the shooting ranges and chapel.

===Chesebrough Scout Reservation===
Chesebrough Scout Reservation, also called Camp Chesebrough is a Boy Scouts of America camp in the Santa Cruz Mountains of Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties, California. The camp is owned by the Memorial Foundation of the Santa Clara County Council, and is used year-round for troop campouts, Order of the Arrow events and Wood Badge trainings; and as a Cub Scouting day camp and a junior leadership resident camp during the summer.

====History====
The original of Chesebrough Scout Reservation in Santa Cruz County were donated to the original Santa Clara County Council by Paul and Nessie Chesebrough in 1977. Paul had inherited the camp and much of the surrounding area from his aunt Edith Van Antwerp in 1949. The Chesebroughs felt that the land should remain open and available for use by the people of California, so they donated much of it to the Mid-Peninsula Regional Open Space District, the Sempervirens Fund, and of course, the Boy Scouts. The Chesebroughs donated another adjoining the property in San Mateo County in 1983.

The council wanted to use Chesebrough as an undeveloped wilderness camp, but the closing of Camp Stuart in Saratoga in 1990 forced the council to move many of the activities from that camp to Chesebrough, including the Cub Scout day camp, which required the construction of additional facilities.

====Location====
Chesebrough Scout Reservation straddles the Santa Cruz-San Mateo county border, and is located south of Saratoga on California State Route 9, and south of that road&#x27;s intersection with California State Route 35, or Skyline Boulevard at Saratoga Gap. The Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail passes through the camp about from its Skyline terminus, in Castle Rock State Park.

The camp is bordered by Saratoga Gap Open Space Preserve and Long Ridge Open Space Preserves of the Mid-Peninsula Regional Open Space District, and Castle Rock and Portola State Parks.

====Facilities====
Chesebrough Scout Reservation has about 8 campsites, each capable of holding at least 30 campers. In addition, the camp has a large modern kitchen, a 300-seat campfire amphitheater, BB gun and archery ranges, and of hiking trails. The trails connect to the Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail, giving access to Castle Rock State Park, Big Basin Redwoods State Park, and Cutter Scout Reservation.

===Camp Pico Blanco===
Camp Pico Blanco is an inactive camp of (originally ) in the interior region of Big Sur in Central California. The camp is surrounded by the Los Padres National Forest, the Ventana Wilderness, undeveloped private land owned by Graniterock, and is located near the Little Sur River.

===Former camps===
* Alum Rock Park (1921 – unknown). The council was given exclusive access to in the park.
* Camp Swanton (1924 – 1930)
* Camp Arroyo Sequoia (1931 – 1944, 1948)
* Camp Bonnie Brier (early 1940s), now known as Boulder Creek Scout Reservation and operated by Pacific Skyline Council
* San Lorenzo Scout Ranch (1941 – 1948)
* Camp Totocano, near Swanton, California (1927 – 1934)
* Camp Wing, at Big Sur State Park (1937)
* Camp Esselen, at Big Sur State Park (1938 – 1953)
* Fort Ord Scout Camp

====Camp Stuart====
Camp Stuart (formally, the Stuart Scout Training Reservation), founded in 1944, is a defunct camp in Saratoga, California. It was donated by Mr. and Mrs. R. R. Stuart, and named in memory of their son, Reginald Ross Stuart. The camp contains , and is located near Sanborn-Skyline County Park.

The camp had a pool, dining room, multipurpose building, flush toilets, shower building, meeting lodge and many campsites. Bohlman Road, which was paved in the 1950s, divides the camp in two. One side served as a Cub Scout day camp, one of the largest in the United States, serving nearly 3000 Scouts each year.

Camp Stuart&#x27;s last summer of operation was in 1988. The Santa Clara County Council already owned two other camps, and decided to sell Camp Stuart to take advantage of rising land values. The camp was sold in 1989, shortly before several buildings were damaged in the Loma Prieta earthquake. The county has not demolished or developed the camp, and has no funds or apparent plans for the area.

==Order of the Arrow==
As a result of the merger, the two former council&#x27;s OA chapters have merged from the former Santa Clara County Council&#x27;s Miwok Lodge and the Monterey Bay Area Council&#x27;s Esselen Lodge into the new Saklan Lodge.

<text>The Stono Rebellion (also known as Cato&#x27;s Conspiracy or Cato&#x27;s Rebellion) was a slave revolt that began on 9 September 1739, in the colony of South Carolina. It was the largest slave rebellion in the Southern Colonial era, with 25 colonists and 35 to 50 African slaves killed. The uprising&#x27;s leaders were likely from the Central African Kingdom of Kongo, as they were Catholic and some spoke Portuguese.

The leader of the rebellion, Jemmy, was a literate enslaved man. In some reports, however, he is referred to as &quot;Cato&quot;, and likely was held by the Cato (or Cater) family, who lived near the Ashley River and north of the Stono River. He led 20 other enslaved Kongolese, who may have been former soldiers, in an armed march south from the Stono River. They were bound for Spanish Florida, where successive proclamations had promised freedom for fugitive slaves from British North America.

Jemmy and his group recruited nearly 60 other slaves and killed more than 20 whites before being intercepted and defeated by the South Carolina militia near the Edisto River. Survivors traveled another before the militia finally defeated them a week later. Most of the captured slaves were executed; the surviving few were sold to markets in the West Indies. In response to the rebellion, the General Assembly passed the Negro Act of 1740, which restricted slaves&#x27; freedoms and placed a moratorium on importing new slaves.

==Causes==

===Local factors===
Since 1708, the majority of the population of the South Carolina colony were enslaved Africans, as importation of slaves from Africa had increased in recent decades with labor demand for the expansion of cotton and rice cultivation as commodity export crops. Historian Ira Berlin has called this the Plantation Generation, noting that South Carolina had become a &quot;slave society&quot;, with slavery central to its economy. Planters bought slaves taken from Africa to satisfy the increased demand for labor. Most slaves were Black Africans. Many in South Carolina were from the Kingdom of Kongo, which had converted to Catholicism in the 15th century. Numerous slaves had first been sold into slavery in the West Indies (in particular, Barbados) before being sold to South Carolina.

With the increase in slaves, colonists tried to regulate their relations, but there was always negotiation in this process. Slaves resisted by running away or initiating work slowdowns and revolts. At the time, Georgia was still an all-white colony, without slavery. South Carolina worked with Georgia to strengthen patrols on land and in coastal areas to prevent fugitives from reaching Spanish Florida. In the Stono case, the slaves may have been inspired by several factors to mount their rebellion. Spanish Florida offered freedom to fugitive slaves from the Southern Colonies; successive governors in the colony had issued proclamations offering freedom for fugitive slaves in Florida in exchange for converting to Catholicism and serving for a period in the colonial militia. As a line of defense for Spanish Florida&#x27;s largest settlement of St. Augustine, the settlement of Fort Mose was established by the colonial government to house fugitive slaves who had reached the colony. Stono was from the Florida line.

A malaria epidemic had recently killed many whites in Charleston, weakening the power of slaveholders. Lastly, historians have suggested the slaves organized their revolt to take place on Sunday, when planters would be occupied in church and might be unarmed. The Security Act of 1739 (which required all white males to carry arms even to church on Sundays) had been passed in August of that year in response to earlier runaways and minor rebellions, but it had not fully taken effect. Local officials were authorized to mount penalties against white men who did not carry arms after 29 September.

===African background===
Jemmy, the leader of the revolt, was a literate slave described in an eyewitness account as &quot;Angolan&quot;. Historian John K. Thornton has noted that he was more likely from the Kingdom of Kongo, as were the cohort of 20 slaves that joined him. The slaves were Catholic and some spoke Portuguese, both of which point to Kongo. A lengthy trade relationship with the Portuguese had led to the adoption of Catholicism and learning of the Portuguese language in the kingdom. The leaders of the Kingdom of Kongo had voluntarily converted in 1491, followed by their people; by the 18th century, the religion was a fundamental part of its citizens&#x27; identity. The nation had independent relations with Rome. Slavery was present in the region and it was regulated by Kongo.

Portuguese was the language of trade as well as one of the languages of educated people in Kongo. The Portuguese-speaking slaves in South Carolina were more likely to have learned about offers of freedom by Spanish agents. They would also have been attracted to the Catholicism of Spanish Florida. In the early 18th century, Kongo had been undergoing civil wars, leading to more people being captured and sold into slavery, including trained soldiers. It is likely that Jemmy and his rebel cohort were such military men, as they fought hard against the militia when they were caught, and were able to kill 20 men.

==Events of the revolt==

On Sunday, 9 September 1739, Jemmy gathered 22 enslaved Africans near the Stono River, southwest of Charleston. Mark M. Smith argues that taking action on the day after the Feast of the Nativity of Mary connected their Catholic past with present purpose, as did the religious symbols they used. The Africans marched down the roadway with a banner that read &quot;Liberty!&quot;, and chanted the same word in unison. They attacked Hutchinson&#x27;s store at the Stono River Bridge, killing two storekeepers and seizing weapons and ammunition.

Raising a flag, the slaves proceeded south toward Spanish Florida, a well-known refuge for escapees. On the way, they gathered more recruits, sometimes reluctant ones, for a total of 81. They burned six plantations and killed 23 to 28 whites along the way. While on horseback, South Carolina&#x27;s Lieutenant Governor William Bull and five of his friends came across the group; they quickly went off to warn other slaveholders. Rallying a militia of planters and minor slaveholders, the colonists traveled to confront Jemmy and his followers.

The next day, the well-armed and mounted militia, numbering 19–99 men, caught up with the group of 76 slaves at the Edisto River. In the ensuing confrontation, 23 whites and 47 slaves were killed. While the slaves lost, they killed proportionately more whites than was the case in later rebellions. The colonists mounted the severed heads of the rebels on stakes along major roadways to serve as warning for other slaves who might consider revolt. The lieutenant governor hired Chickasaw and Catawba Indians and other slaves to track down and capture the Africans who had escaped from the battle. A group of the slaves who escaped fought a pitched battle with a militia a week later approximately from the site of the first conflict. The colonists executed most of the rebels; they sold others to the markets of the West Indies.
This excerpt is from George Cato who said this was passed down in his family. 

==Aftermath==
Over the next two years, slave uprisings occurred independently in Georgia and South Carolina. Colonial officials believed these were inspired by the Stono Rebellion, but historians think the increasingly harsh conditions of slavery since the beginning of the 18th century under the rice and cotton cultures were sufficient cause.

Planters decided to develop a slave population who were native-born, believing the workers were more content if they grew up enslaved. Attributing the rebellion to the recently imported Africans, planters decided to cut off the supply. They enacted a 10-year moratorium on slave importation through Charleston. When, a decade later, they opened the port to the international slave trade again, planters imported slaves from areas other than the Congo-Angolan region.

In addition, the legislature passed the Negro Act of 1740 to tighten controls: it required a ratio of one white to ten blacks on any plantation. It prohibited slaves from growing their own food, assembling in groups, earning money, or learning to read. In the uncertain world of the colony, several of the law&#x27;s provisions were based on the assumption that whites could effectively judge black character; for instance, whites were empowered to examine blacks who were traveling outside a plantation without passes, and to take action.

The legislature also worked to improve conditions in slavery in order to avoid problems; it established penalties for masters who demanded excessive work or who brutally punished slaves. These provisions were difficult to enforce, as the law did not allow slave testimony against whites. They also started a school to teach slaves Christian doctrine. At the same time, the legislature tried to prevent slaves from being manumitted, as the representatives thought that the presence of free blacks in the colony made slaves restless. It required slaveholders to apply to the legislature for permission for each case of manumission; formerly, manumissions could be arranged privately. South Carolina kept these restrictions against manumission until slavery was abolished after the American Civil War.

==Legacy==

The Hutchinson&#x27;s warehouse site, where the revolt began, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974. A South Carolina Historical Marker has also been erected at the site.

The text of the marker reads:
The Stono Rebellion, the largest slave insurrection in British North America, began nearby on September 9, 1739. About 20 Africans raided a store near Wallace Creek, a branch of the Stono River. Taking guns and other weapons, they killed two shopkeepers. The rebels marched south toward promised freedom in Spanish Florida, waving flags, beating drums, and shouting &quot;Liberty!&quot;
The rebels were joined by 40 to 60 more during their 15-mile march. They killed at least 20 whites, but spared others. The rebellion ended late that afternoon when the militia caught the rebels, killing at least 54 of them. Most who escaped were captured and executed; any forced to join the rebels were released. The S.C. assembly [sic] soon enacted a harsh slave code, in force until 1865.

<text>Applause (Latin &quot;,&quot; to strike upon, clap) is primarily a form of ovation or praise expressed by the act of clapping, or striking the palms of the hands together, in order to create noise of excellent peformance. Audiences usually applaud after a performance, such as a musical concert, speech, or play, as a sign of enjoyment and approval.

==History==

The age of the custom of applauding is uncertain, but it is widespread among human cultures. Varieties of applause typically serve as the means to show appreciation as an audience participant and fulfills the need to be included. The variety of its forms is limited only by the capacity for devising means of making a noise (e.g., stomping of feet or rapping of fists or hands on a table). Within each culture, however, it is usually subject to conventions. 

The ancient Romans had set rituals at public performances to express degrees of approval: snapping the finger and thumb, clapping with the flat or hollow palm, and waving the flap of the toga. Upper-class spectators expressed approval by waving their togas, while lower-class spectators, who were not allowed to wear togas, just waved a piece of cloth, which may have been a precursor to the handkerchief. Emperor Aurelian substituted the waving of napkins (&quot;) that he had distributed to the Roman people for the toga flapping. In Roman theatre, at the close of the play, the chief actor called out &quot; (farewell and applaud), and the audience, guided by an unofficial choregos, chanted their approval antiphonally. This was often organized and paid for.

Similarly, a claque (IPA: /klak/) (French for &quot;slapping&quot;) was an organized body of professional applauders in French theatres and opera houses who were paid by the performer(s) to create the illusion of an increased level of approval by the audience. Alternatively, if they were not paid they may boo and perhaps throw things at the stage. By the 1830s, this had become commonplace. Heads of theaters and opera houses could get many professional clappers whenever they needed a boost. The leader of the claque would decide when and where to begin the cheering. The claque consisted of people participating in a variety of roles: some would memorize the show to emphasize key scenes or moments, so-called &quot;laughers&quot; may feign laughter so as to incite the audience to laugh along, &quot;criers&quot; would fake tears, The emergence of claques made composers like Mahler, Schumann, and Mendelssohn begin to request in their scores that their works be performed with no break between movements as to avoid applause, becoming a catalyst to the well-known applause etiquette upheld in many classical performance settings.

In Christianity, customs of the theatre were adopted by the churches. Eusebius says that Paul of Samosata encouraged the congregation to indicate approval of his preaching by waving linen cloths (), and in the 4th and 5th centuries applause of the rhetoric of popular preachers had become an established custom. Applause in church eventually fell out of fashion, however. Partly due to the influence of the quasi-religious atmosphere of the performances of Richard Wagner&#x27;s operas at the , the reverential spirit that inspired this soon extended back to the theatre and the concert hall.

==Protocol and variations==

=== Protocol ===
Well-recognized politicians, actors, and musicians often receive applause as soon as they first appear on stage, even before any performance activity has transpired. This accolade is given to indicate admiration for their past achievements, and is not a response to the performance the audience is attending.

On some occasions, applause occurs in the middle of an event. The President of the United States, in the State of the Union Address, is often interrupted by applause; tracking the number and duration of such interruptions has become a trend on various television news channels. It is often customary for jazz performers to receive applause in the middle of a tune, after completing an improvisational solo. It is also typical to applaud at the end of a musical number in a musical theatre piece.

In most performances, if spectators really enjoy a performance, mainly in classical performances, they may also accompany by throwing flowers onstage. The volume of applause after a performance has also been shown to change the evaluation of the performance by the audience.

Extended applause at the conclusion of an event, usually but not always resulting in a standing ovation, implies approval above and beyond ordinary measure, and compels the performer to return in acknowledgement and at times proceed to an encore.

=== In classical music ===
During classical music performances, it is customary to applaud at the end of each piece and at the beginning of the show. Usually the conductor will face the audience when it is an appropriate time to applaud. Standing ovations and encores are the norm at classical concerts, but not guaranteed.

Indiscriminate applause is widely considered a violation of classical music concert etiquette: Applause is discouraged between movements, reserved instead for the end of the entire work. Yelling, jumping, and other disruptive actions are discouraged as well, although cheering can be appropriate during a standing ovation.

There have been a number of attempts to further restrict applause in various circumstances. For example, court theaters in Berlin prohibit applause during the performance and before the curtain call (although elsewhere in Germany, this is felt to be beyond public tastes).

By contrast, opera performances have traditionally been interrupted by applause at the end of an aria or certain other set pieces, and many opera scores reflect a break in the music at places where applause would typically occur. Regarding this practice as a distraction, Wagner headed it off by eliminating breaks in the score within each act; the arias in his operas do not end in a &quot;full stop&quot; but flow into the next section of the music, until the end of the act is reached. Even then, in light of the quasi-religious atmosphere of the first act of &quot;Parsifal&quot;, it is traditional for the audience not to applaud at all at the end of that act, but file out of their seats in silence.

=== In church ===
Applause during church services is traditionally regarded as taboo, in light of the sanctity of the proceedings; focus is on the aspect of worship rather than the personality of the individual preaching or singing during the service. This rule may be relaxed to permit applause in honor of the newly married couple when they may turn to be greeted by the congregation following the exchange of vows. Applause may also be permitted at certain services in honor of a specific individual, such as a baptism or the ordination of a new priest or minister. In less traditional congregations, particularly in contemporary, evangelical megachurches, a more casual atmosphere exists and applause may be encountered as frequently as at any secular performance.

===In legislative bodies===
In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, clapping is generally prohibited. Instead, members of parliament and lords generally will shout &quot;hear, hear!&quot;. In the House of Commons of Canada, by contrast, clapping is customary and frequent.

===In air travel===
In various countries, airplane passengers often tend to applaud the landing upon completion of a flight and when they have felt the plane&#x27;s wheels touch down and have run a short but satisfactory course down the runway. The purpose of this custom is unclear.

=== Variations ===
A golf clap is a form of quiet clapping, so-named because it is the preferred form of applause for golfers; louder forms of applause are discouraged at golf tournaments so as not to disturb other golfers, who may be in the process of attempting a shot. Golf claps are sometimes used at other events to heckle or to show sarcasm. Similarly, in the game of snooker, a good cue shot, a difficult pot, a &#x27;snooker&#x27; which is difficult from which to escape, will be rewarded by the opponent tapping their cue several times on the table edge.

Likewise, string musicians of an orchestra use bobbing their bows in the air or gently tapping them on their instruments&#x27; strings as a substitute for applause. Wind section members will generally lightly stamp their feet or pat one hand on their leg to show approval to a conductor or soloist, while percussionists often rap drumsticks together. An even more subtle form of approval may be exhibited by a member of an orchestra during a formal rehearsal or performance when a colleague performs particularly well, usually a slight shuffle of the foot on the floor or hand on the knee. These subtle forms of applause may not be recognized as such by the audience. Outright applause by performers for other performers, although increasingly common, is traditionally regarded as , self-congratulatory, and usurping of the audience&#x27;s prerogative (and sole task in this respect) to provide accolades when they feel that the performance merits it.

In skateboarding culture, when a fellow skater performs and lands a maneuver exceptionally well the observers will bang their own boards against the ground to express approval or encouragement.

In Deaf culture, Deaf audiences will use a more visually expressive variant of clapping. Instead of clapping their palms together, they raise their hands straight up with outstretched fingers and twist their wrists. However, in a situation more specific to hearing culture, the traditional clap is used.

In poetry performances, applause often takes the form of finger snapping in order to express approval to the performer without being loud and disruptive.

In some countries, applause may be used to indicate respect for a recently deceased person in some instances, such as at a funeral procession. A recent phenomenon in Britain and Israel, is the use of a minute&#x27;s applause, which has come to replace the traditional minute&#x27;s silence. In the United Kingdom, it is especially at football matches, and in Israel also at basketball matches and other sports. However, in most countries, applause for a deceased person is still widely frowned upon and not recommended because it may be misinterpreted as rudeness or joy.

In German-speaking countries, it is customary for university students to rap their knuckles on the desks after each lecture. The same technique is used in German-speaking countries to express approval at meetings.

In Jamaica people may bang lids and pot covers together during celebratory events such as a victory at the Olympic Games or the Miss World competitions.

==Slow handclaps in film==

Another type of &quot;slow handclap&quot; is used as a dramatic device, often forming the conclusion of dramatic turning points in films. After some dramatic speech, one audience member claps slowly, then another, and then a few more, until the trickle of clapping gives way to roaring applause, often ending in a standing ovation. This is also referred to as a &quot;crescendo applause&quot;, named for the increasing level of volume it produces.

<doc id="437456" wikidata="Q1241943" url="?curid=437456" title="Narragansett Bay">
<text>Narragansett Bay is a bay and estuary on the north side of Rhode Island Sound covering , of which is in Rhode Island. The bay forms New England&#x27;s largest estuary, which functions as an expansive natural harbor and includes a small archipelago. Small parts of the bay extend into Massachusetts.

There are more than 30 islands in the bay; the three largest ones are Aquidneck Island, Conanicut Island, and Prudence Island. Bodies of water that are part of Narragansett Bay include the Sakonnet River, Mount Hope Bay, and the southern, tidal part of the Taunton River. The bay opens on Rhode Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean; Block Island lies less than southwest of its opening.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Narragansett&quot; is derived from the southern New England Algonquian word meaning &quot;(people) of the small point of land&quot;.

==Geography==

The watershed of Narragansett Bay has seven river sub-drainage basins, including the Taunton, Pawtuxet, and Blackstone Rivers, and they provide freshwater input at approximately per day. River water inflow has a seasonal variability, with the highest flow in the spring and the minimum flow in early fall.

The bay is a ria estuary (a drowned river valley) which is composed of the Sakonnet River valley, the East Passage river valley, and the West Passage river valley. The bathymetry varies greatly among the three passages, with the average depths of the East, West, and Sakonnet River passages being , , and respectively. Narragansett Bay is a ria that consists of a series of flooded river valleys formed of dropped crustal blocks in a horst and graben system that is slowly subsiding between a shifting fault system.

Providence is Rhode Island&#x27;s capital and largest city and sits at the northernmost arm of the bay. Many of Providence&#x27;s suburbs are also on the bay, including East Providence, Warwick and Cranston. Newport is located at the south end of Aquidneck Island on the ocean, and is the home of the United States Naval War College, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, and a major United States Navy training center. The city of Fall River, Massachusetts is located at the confluence of the Taunton River and Mount Hope Bay, which form the northeasternmost part of Narragansett Bay. The southwest side of the bay includes the seaside tourist towns of Narragansett and Wickford. Quonset Point, south of Warwick, gives its name to the Quonset hut.

==Oceanography==

===Tidal patterns===
Tides in the watershed are measured at Providence, Fall River, Quonset Point, Conimicut Light, Prudence Island, and Newport. In shallow water, sound waves are used to measure water height by precisely measuring their travel time. In deeper water, tides are measured with pressure-sensing tide gauges that are placed on the ocean floor to measure water height. 
The bay&#x27;s tides are semi-diurnal, meaning that the region experiences two high and low tides daily. The tides range in height from at the bay&#x27;s mouth and at its head. Water depth varies about between high and low tide. The lunar, semi-diurnal M2 tide occurs at a period of 12.42 hours, with two tides occurring in the watershed every 24 hours and 50 minutes. The watershed&#x27;s neap and spring tides occur every 14.8 days. In Narragansett bay, the tides show a distinct double-peak flood during high tide and single peak ebb during low tide.

===Water circulation patterns===

The movement of water within a system is its circulation. Estuaries are given a classification depending on the pattern of their circulations. The circulation classification can be well-mixed, partially mixed, salt wedge, or Fjord-type. For Narragansett, the circulation is mostly well-mixed; however, the Providence River does show some vertical stratification.

Narragansett Bay circulation is made up of forces provided by the winds, tides, and changes in water density within the watershed. Its circulation is the result of the flow of fresh water at the head interacting with salt water at the point where the bay meets the open ocean. Residence time of water due to the circulation of Narragansett Bay is 10–40 days, with an average of 26 days. Tidal mixing is the dominant driver of circulation patterns in the bay, where currents can reach up to 2.5 feet per second. Non-tidal currents such as the flow of low salinity water at the surface out of the bay and high salinity deep water into the bay contribute to a current of about 0.33 feet per second.

Winds also drive circulation patterns in the bay. In the winter, winds come from the northwest, helping move water towards the bay&#x27;s mouth; in the summer, they are out of the southwest and move water towards the head of the bay. Wind-driven waves of over also help mix surface waters.

Density-driven forces are the third factor affecting circulation. Fresh water inflow comes from natural sources such as atmospheric precipitation and inflow from the many rivers that feed into the watershed, and human-made sources such as water treatment plants. Fresh and saltwater mixing results in a salinity range in the bay of 24 parts per thousand (ppt) in the upper Providence River area to 32 ppt at the mouth of the bay.

The bay&#x27;s currents and circulation patterns greatly influence the sediment deposits within the region. The majority of the sediments within the bay are fine-grained material such as detritus, clay-silt, and sand-silt-clay. Scientists have been able to identify 11 types of sediment that range from coarse gravels to fine silts. the bay&#x27;s currents deposit fine materials through the harbors of the lower and middle sections of the bay, and the coarse, heavy materials are deposited in the lower areas of the bay where the water velocities are higher.

==Early history==
The first visit by Europeans to the bay was probably in the early 16th century. At the time, the area surrounding the bay was inhabited by two different Indian tribes: the Narragansetts occupied the west side of the bay, and the Wampanoags lived on the east side, occupying the land east to Cape Cod.

It is accepted by most historians that first contact by Europeans was made by Giovanni da Verrazzano, an Italian explorer who entered the bay in his ship &quot;La Dauphine&quot; in 1524 after visiting New York Bay. Verrazzano called the bay &quot;Refugio&quot;, the &quot;Refuge&quot;. It has several entrances, however, and historians can only speculate as to the exact route of his voyage and the location where he laid anchor, along with a corresponding uncertainty over which tribe made contact with him. Verrazzano reported that he found clearings and open forests suitable for travel &quot;even by a large army&quot;. Dutch navigator Adriaen Block explored and mapped the bay in 1614, and nearby Block Island is named in his honor.

The first permanent Colonial settlement was established in 1636 by Roger Williams, a former member of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He was friends with Narragansett &quot;sachem&quot; Canonicus, who provided him with land on which to build Providence Plantations. Around the same time, the Dutch established a trading post approximately 12 miles (20 km) to the southwest which was under the authority of New Amsterdam in New York Bay. In 1643, Williams traveled to England and was granted a charter for the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.

The Gaspee Affair was an important naval event which moved the Thirteen Colonies toward the American Revolution. It occurred in Narragansett Bay in 1772 and involved the capture and burning of the British customs schooner &quot;Gaspee&quot;. The American victory contributed to the eventual start of the war at the Battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts three years later. The event is celebrated in Pawtuxet Village as the Gaspee Days Celebration in June which includes burning the ship in effigy.

Roger Williams and other early colonists named the islands Prudence, Patience, Hope, Despair, and Hog. To remember the names, colonial school children often recited the poem: &quot;Patience, Prudence, Hope, and Despair. And the little Hog over there.&quot;

==Water properties and phytoplankton distribution==
Narragansett Bay is divided by Conanicut Island into east and west passages. Its depth averages approximately 9.0 meters throughout the bay, but it is shallower in the west passage and deeper in the east. Narragansett Bay receives freshwater input from several sources, including rivers (approximately 80%), direct precipitation (13%), wastewater treatment facilities (9%), and unknown amounts from ground-water and combined sewer overflows (CSOs). The freshwater input varies greatly from season to season as it is highest in winter and lowest in summer, while CSOs increase dramatically following heavy rain. Water from these freshwater inputs mixes with sea water to form a salinity gradient ranging from 24 ppt at the mouth of the Providence River to 32 ppt at the mouth of the bay. Water temperatures range between -0.5 °C and 24 °C over the year. Salinity and temperature patterns measured throughout the bay indicate a range of mixed to stratified conditions and the amount of time it takes for the total volume of fresh water in the bay to be equaled by the fresh water input (flushing time) varies from 40 days to 10 days, depending on freshwater input.

Dissolved oxygen levels in Narragansett Bay are seasonal with lower levels in the summer and higher levels in the winter. This is due to warmer temperatures and higher biological demand for oxygen in the summer and the opposite in the winter. Narragansett Bay is also subject to periodic summer hypoxic events in the Northern half of the bay, nearing anoxic conditions in some parts.

Phytoplankton forms the base of the food chain for many of the bay&#x27;s marine animals. General trends in phytoplankton biomass across the bay are characterized by highest levels in the Providence River and lowest levels in Rhode Island Sound, correlating with the North to South nutrient concentration gradient in the bay (24). Near the Providence River, biomass levels are highest in the summer and lowest in the winter. In the east and west passages there are peaks in the spring and fall.

Annual blooms have shrunk over the last decade (2006 onward) as the amount of nitrogen (an important nutrient) supply to the bay has decreased by more than 50% due to wastewater treatment facilities switching to a new treatment that involves removal of nitrogen 

Narragansett Bay is the site of one of the world&#x27;s longest-running plankton surveys, extending from 1957 through the present. Researchers at the University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Oceanography collect samples weekly and the dataset contains 246 different species.

<doc id="437457" wikidata="Q3354638" url="?curid=437457" title="Operation Athena">
<text>Operation Athena was the Canadian Forces&#x27; contribution to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. The operation was divided in two phases: the first one took place from July 2003 to July 2005 in the Kabul region and the second one from August 2005 to December 2011 in the Kandahar area. The operation&#x27;s main objective was to improve Afghanistan&#x27;s security and governance. Operation Athena in Kandahar constituted the longest combat mission in the history of Canadian Forces. With over 40,000 Canadian military members that, at some point, entered the country—often several times—this operation constitutes the largest military deployment of the Canadian Forces since World War II.

== Context ==
Following the terrorist attacks on 9/11 in New York City, the United States started a military campaign against the Taliban regime and Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Canada officially joined this campaign on October 9, 2001.

Operation Athena followed Operation Apollo, codename for the initial deployment of Canadian Force troops in Afghanistan from October 2001 to October 2003. Operation Athena was an integral part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan created by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1386 on December 13, 2001. Thereafter, other United Nations Security Council Resolutions have extended the ISAF&#x27;s mandate.

The military operation in Afghanistan was part of a government-wide effort; indeed, Canada is one of the main international donors in Afghanistan and several other ministries were involved along with the Canadian Department of National Defence.

== Purpose ==
Operation Athena&#x27;s objective was to assist the Afghan government in order to help it govern better in a more stable environment.
Its purpose was to deploy 5300 Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan, within a coalition of about forty countries.
In this context, the ISAF was in charge of fighting the insurgents, and on a wider scale, was also responsible of the development and maintenance of security; Canada was, in terms of number of troops provided to the ISAF, the fifth country after the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany.

The Kandahar Province provincial reconstruction team (PRT) aims to help the Afghan government to rebuild the country with the help of developmental projects, but also to extend its authority and to provide services to the citizens. The PRT – one of the 27 in Afghanistan – was under Canadian responsibility during Phase Two of Operation Athena. The Kandahar PRT was composed of diplomats, engineers, policemen, correctional officials and soldiers. It represented the Afghan government before the Province&#x27;s local authorities.

== Phases of the Operation ==

=== Phase One ===
Operation Athena began on 17 July 2003 with the installation of Brigadier-General Peter Devlin as commander of the ISAF&#x27;s Kabul Multi-National Brigade. Two days later, 3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment began deploying as the first rotation of Task Force Kabul. The operation evolved into a 1,900 personnel task force which provided assistance to civilian infrastructure such as well-digging and repair of local buildings.
ISAF&#x27;s primary objective in 2004 was ensuring the safe conduct of Afghanistan&#x27;s first democratic election, which was held on 9 October 2004. Hamid Karzai was declared the winner, and on 9 December 2004 he was inaugurated President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Phase one of Operation Athena ended in July 2005.

=== Phase Two ===
In 2005, ISAF began to extend its operations beyond Kabul to support the development and growth of Afghanistan&#x27;s governmental institutions, especially its national security forces. In August 2005, the second phase of Operation Athena began with the Canadian Forces assuming command of Kandahar Province from a United States Army task force deployed under Operation Enduring Freedom.

== History ==
Operation Athena started on July 17, 2003, in the Kabul region when Brigadier General Peter Devlin was assigned to command the multinational ISAF brigade, the troops&#x27; deployment was scheduled to effectively start on July 19, with a battlegroup built around the 3rd Battalion Royal Canadian Regiment. The ISAF became a coalition directed by the NATO on August 11.
The very same day, Major General Andrew Leslie was appointed second in command of the ISAF. The Canadian embassy in Kabul opened in August.

The ISAF&#x27;s main role in 2003 was to establish and to maintain security in Kabul when the new constitution was being written by the Loya Jirga, symbolizing the end of the Taliban regime. On February 9, 2004, Lieutenant-General Rick Hillier was appointed Commander of the ISAF. At this time, the Canadian military represented 40% of the ISAF. The year 2004 held the first Afghan presidential election on October 9, and it was of ISAF&#x27;s responsibility to ensure that they were properly conducted.

In 2005, the ISAF&#x27;s efforts started to extend outside of Kabul. The second phase of Operation Athena started with the deployment of a battlegroup built around the 2nd Battalion Royal Canadian Regiment in Kandahar in August 2005. This battlegroup constituted the Kandahar Task Force, taking over the American task force deployed in this region during Operation Enduring Freedom. Thus, the Canadian Forces played an important role in one of Afghanistan&#x27;s most dangerous regions. This second phase constituted the Canadian Forces&#x27; first participation to an oversea operation as an actor of a government-wide deployment.

== Rotations ==

The battle groups were composed of a battalion of regular force of infantry which would normally remain in Afghanistan for about six months.

<doc id="437461" wikidata="Q733150" url="?curid=437461" title="Megalania">
<text>Megalania (Varanus priscus) is an extinct species of giant monitor lizard, part of the megafaunal assemblage that inhabited Australia during the Pleistocene. It is the largest terrestrial lizard known to have existed, but the fragmentary nature of known remains make estimates highly uncertain. Recent studies suggest that most known specimens would have reached around in body length excluding the tail, while some individuals would have been significantly larger, reaching sizes around in length.

Megalania is thought to have had a similar ecology to the living Komodo dragon (&quot;Varanus komodoensis&quot;) which may be its closest living relative. The youngest fossil remains of giant monitor lizards in Australia date to around 50,000 years ago. The first indigenous settlers of Australia might have encountered megalania, and been a factor in megalania&#x27;s extinction. While originally megalania was considered to be the only member of the titular genus &quot;&quot;Megalania&quot;, today it is considered a member of the genus &quot;Varanus&quot;, being closely related to other Australian monitor lizards.

==Taxonomy==
Sir Richard Owen described the first known remains of megalania in 1859, from three vertebrae amongst a collection of primarily marsupial bones purchased by the British Museum, collected from the bed of a tributary of the Condamine River, west of Moreton Bay in eastern Australia. The name &quot;Megalania prisca&quot;&quot; was coined in the paper by Owen to mean &quot;ancient great roamer&quot;; the name was chosen &quot;in reference to the terrestrial nature of the great Saurian&quot;. Owen used a modification of the Greek word ἠλαίνω &quot;ēlainō&quot; (&quot;I roam&quot;). The close similarity to the Latin word: &quot;lania&quot; (feminine form of &quot;butcher&quot;) has resulted in numerous taxonomic and popular descriptions of &quot;Megalania&quot; mistranslating the name as &quot;ancient giant butcher.&quot; &quot;Megalania&quot; is no longer considered a valid genus, with many authors preferring to consider it a junior synonym of &quot;Varanus&quot;, which encompasses all living monitor lizards. The genera &quot;Megalania&quot; and &quot;Varanus&quot; are respectively feminine and masculine in grammatical gender and their specific names need to match them: &quot;prisca&quot; (feminine) and &quot;priscus&quot; (masculine).

Megalania is included within &quot;Varanus&quot; because its morphology suggests that it is more closely related to some species of &quot;Varanus&quot; than others, so excluding &quot;V. priscus&quot; from &quot;Varanus&quot; renders the latter genus an unnatural grouping. Ralph Molnar noted in 2004 that, even if every species of the genus &quot;Varanus&quot; were divided into groups currently designated as subgenera, &quot;V. priscus&quot; would still be classified in the genus &quot;Varanus&quot;, because this is the current subgenus name, as well as genus name, for all Australian monitors. Unless other Australian monitor species were each also classified their own exclusive genera, &quot;Megalania&quot; would not be a valid genus name. However, Molnar noted that &quot;megalania&quot; is suitable for use as a vernacular, rather than scientific name, for the species &quot;Varanus priscus&quot;.

===Phylogeny===

Several studies have attempted to establish the phylogenetic position of megalania within the Varanidae. An affinity with the perentie (&quot;Varanus giganteus&quot;), Australia&#x27;s largest living lizard, has been suggested based on skull-roof morphology. The most recent comprehensive study proposes a sister-taxon relationship with the large Komodo dragon (&quot;Varanus komodoensis&quot;) based on neurocranial similarities, with the lace monitor (&quot;Varanus varius&quot;) as the closest living Australian relative. Conversely, the perentie is considered more closely related to Gould&#x27;s monitor and the Argus monitor.

==Size==

The lack of complete or nearly complete fossil skeletons has made it difficult to determine the exact dimensions of megalania. Early estimates placed the length of the largest individuals at , with a maximum weight of approximately . In 2002, Stephen Wroe considerably downsized megalania, suggesting a maximum total length of and a weight of with average total lengths of and , decrying the earlier maximum length estimate of as exaggerations based on flawed methods. In 2009, however, Wroe joined other researchers in raising the estimate to at least and .

In 2003, Erickson and colleagues suggested that a large specimen with an estimated longevity of 16 years, QM F4452/3, would have belonged to an individual up to in snout-vent length based on femoral length. In a book published in 2004, Ralph Molnar determined a range of potential sizes for megalania, made by scaling up from dorsal vertebrae, after he determined a relationship between dorsal vertebrae width and snout-vent length. The average snout-vent length of known specimens were around , and such individuals would have weighed up to . The largest vertebra (QM 2942) would have belonged to an individual with a snout-vent length of and weighed up to .

In 2012, Conrad and colleagues estimated the size of megalania based on comparing two known specimens with all known species of &quot;Varanus&quot;. The authors of the study suggested that the braincase (BMNH 39965) likely belonged to an individual around in precaudal length, while the largest specimen available to them (AMNH FR 6304) suggested that this individual would have reached up to in precaudal length. They also noted that it is possible for megalania to reach over in precaudal length, given that the largest specimens of modern varanid species are larger than average individuals by 151 to 225 percent.

==Palaeobiology==

Megalania is the largest terrestrial lizard known to have existed. Judging from its size, it would have fed mostly upon medium- to large-sized animals, including any of the giant marsupials such as &quot;Diprotodon&quot;, along with other reptiles and small mammals, as well as birds and their eggs and chicks. It had heavily built limbs and body, a large skull complete with a small crest between the eyes, and a jaw full of serrated, blade-like teeth.

Some scientists regard with skepticism the contention that megalania was the only, or even principal, predator of the Australian Pleistocene megafauna. They note that the marsupial lion (&quot;Thylacoleo carnifex&quot;) has been implicated with the butchery of very large Pleistocene mammals, while megalania has not. In addition, they note that megalania fossils are extremely uncommon, in contrast to &quot;T. carnifex&#x27;s&quot; wide distribution across Australian Pleistocene deposits. &quot;Quinkana&quot;, a genus of terrestrial crocodiles that grew up to 6 m and was present until around 40,000 years ago, has also been marked as another apex predator of Australian megafauna.

Komodo dragons, megalania&#x27;s closest relative, are known to have evolved in Australia before spreading to their current range in Indonesia, as fossil evidence from Queensland has implied. If one were to reconstruct the ecosystems that existed before the arrival of the humans on Australia, reintroducing Komodo dragons as an ecological proxy of megalania to the continent has been suggested.

A study published in 2009 using Wroe&#x27;s earlier size estimates and an analysis of 18 closely related lizard species estimated a sprinting speed of . This speed is comparable to that of the extant freshwater crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus johnstoni&quot;).

The scales of megalania would possibly be similar to those of their extant relatives, possessing a honeycomb microstructure and both durable and resilient to water evaporation.

===Venom===
Along with other varanid lizards, such as the Komodo dragon and the Nile monitor, megalania belongs to the proposed clade Toxicofera, which contains all known reptile clades possessing toxin-secreting oral glands, as well as their close venomous and nonvenomous relatives, including Iguania, Anguimorpha, and snakes. Closely related varanids use a potent venom found in glands inside the jaw. The venom in these lizards have been shown to be a haemotoxin. The venom would act as an anticoagulant and would greatly increase the bleeding the prey received from its wounds. This would rapidly decrease the prey&#x27;s blood pressure and lead to systemic shock. Being a member of Anguimorpha, megalania may have been venomous and if so, would be the largest venomous vertebrate known.

=== Extinction ===
The youngest remains of the species date to the Late Pleistocene, with the youngest remains possibly referrable to the species being a large osteoderm dating to approximately 50,000 years ago from the Mount Etna Caves National Park in central-eastern Queensland. A study examined the morphology of nine closely related extant varanid lizards and then allometrically scaled and compared them to &quot;V. priscus&quot;, found that the musculature of the limbs, posture, muscular mass, and possible muscular composition of the animal would most likely have been inefficient when attempting to outrun the early human settlers who colonised Australia during that time. Considering many other species of Australian megafauna went extinct around the same time, either due to human predation or being outcompeted by them, the same can be assumed for megalania.

Confrontations between megalania and early Aboriginal Australians may have inspired tales of fearsome creatures such as the whowie.

<text>Rhode Island Sound is a marine sound off the coast of the U.S. state of Rhode Island at the mouth of Narragansett Bay. It forms the eastern extension of Block Island Sound and opens out the Atlantic Ocean between Block Island and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard.

==Geography==
Geographically, Rhode Island Sound is the eastward extension of Block Island Sound. Northeast of Rhode Island Sound is Buzzards Bay. The Rhode Island Sound is approximately and has a maximum depth of . Average wave heights range from . Circulation and current strength are mostly impacted by the surrounding geology and not by wind strength. This causes the sea floor habitats in the Rhode Island Sound to be constantly changing.

===Sedimentary processes===
Studies conducted in 2006 by the Coastal Marine and Geology Program and the Long Island Sound Resource Center used digital terrain models to make topographical depictions of unknown glacial features and bedforms. Newfound glacial features include an ice-sculptured bedrock surface, residual stagnant-ice-contact deposits, a recessional moraine, and exposed glaciolacustrine sediments. Modern bedforms consist of fields of transverse sand waves, barchanoid waves, giant scour depressions, and pockmarks). Bedform asymmetry from multibeam bathymetric data indicate that net sediment transport is westward across the northern part of the study area near Fishers Island, and eastward across the southern part near Great Gull Island. Compared to the Block Island Sound, the Rhode Island Sound is more prone to stratification since water currents are less dynamic in this area.

==Flora and fauna==

===Algal and kelp growth===
Kelp population density is higher in the Rhode Island Sound compared to other temperate locations, particularly locations north of Rhode Island. However, even though annual kelp production is higher, the productivity of individual plants is lower due to lower biomass accumulation of fucoid algae. Studies conducted by Pilson, Asare, and Harlin between 1983 and 1985 illustrated that algal species such as &quot;Laminaria saccharina&quot; living in Rhode Island Sound waters have maximum nitrogen accumulation in their tissues, which directly correlates with maximum ambient inorganic nitrogen levels in tissues of other algal species as well. The cause of this is majorly impacted by large temporal fluctuations in the Rhode Island waters.

===Invasive species===
In 2008, research conducted by the University of Rhode Island, Graduate School of Oceanography, shows that there is an increase in the abundance of a tunicate species, &quot;Didemnum&quot;. The species has been spotted in the Rhode Island Sound area since 2000, but has been rapidly increasing in numbers ever since. Two certain species of jellyfish are currently having a population explosion within these waters. &quot;Mnemiopsis leidyi&quot;, commonly known as sea walnut comb jellies, and the Lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish (&quot;Cyanea capillata&quot;), are disrupting habitats with their invasive behavior in the Rhode Island Sound waters.

<doc id="437464" wikidata="Q3296425" url="?curid=437464" title="María Antonieta de las Nieves">
<text>María Antonieta Gómez Rodríguez (born 4 December 1949), more commonly known by her stage name María Antonieta de las Nieves, is a Mexican actress, comedian, singer, and author. Her best remembered role is that of La Chilindrina, one of the main characters of the Televisa sitcom &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot;.

==Early life==
De las Nieves was born in Mexico City, daughter of parents who had emigrated to the city from Santiago Ixcuintla, Nayarit. She is the youngest of the seven children of Estanislao Gómez Ocampo and Delfilia Rodríguez Ocampo, who owned a women&#x27;s clothing store. 

De las Nieves lost one of her brothers, José Luis, in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, when his house collapsed. His wife and daughter survived.

==Career==
She made her film debut in the fantasy film &quot;Pulgarcito&quot; (1957), starring María Elena Marqués, José Elías Moreno, and Cesáreo Quezadas in the title role. At age 10, she became a voice actress; she provided the Spanish voices for characters such as Wednesday Addams from &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, Eddie Munster from &quot;The Munsters&quot;, Batgirl from &quot;Batman&quot;, and Invisible Woman from &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;. Her first telenovela was &quot;Estafa de amor&quot; (1961), starring Carmen Montejo and Amparo Rivelles.

De las Nieves became famous as La Chilindrina in the Televisa sitcom &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot;. She was also the lead actress in &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; until 1973, when she left and Florinda Meza replaced her. She was a voice actress at Televisa, when Chespirito heard her talk. Thinking her voice was perfect for the Chilindrina character, he offered her a job at his new television program, and she accepted. Both &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot; and &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; became hits across Latin America, in New Zealand and the United States, as well as various other countries where the program was translated into local languages. The casts of &quot;Chavo&quot; and &quot;Chapulín&quot; toured extensively whilst the series was on; after cancellation of the series&#x27; filming in Mexico, its actors continued travelling, and the series continued to be featured in many Latin American countries (as of 2024, it is still shown in the United States).

In 1994, she was cast as the lead in &quot;Aquí está la Chilindrina&quot;, in which she lives in a convent with various nuns and orphan girls. Despite only lasting a short run, it had big success. She played Dulce Amado, an elderly aunt, in the Telemundo telenovela &quot;Dame Chocolate&quot; (2007). In 2012, de las Nieves participated as a contestant in Univision&#x27;s third season of &quot;Mira Quién Baila&quot;. She has voiced Vanellope von Schweetz in the Spanish dub of &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; (2012).

==Lawsuit==

María Antonieta de las Nieves was able to win a legal battle over Chespirito in 2003, one that gives her permission to act as &quot;La Chilindrina&quot; in public whenever she wants to, and grants her rights over the character she played. Chespirito owns the rights to most of the other characters of the shows he created, which led some of the actors like Rubén Aguirre () and Carlos Villagrán (Quico) to move to Argentina at separate points of their careers to revive the characters. In addition, because of the lawsuit, La Chilindrina is the only major character in the series that doesn&#x27;t appear in the animated series &quot;El Chavo Animado&quot; and in its spin-off video game, &quot;El Chavo Kart&quot;.

==Personal life==
In November 2021, it was announced that de las Nieves and her character of &quot;La Chilindrina&quot; would be included in the Guinness World Records for being the actress &quot;portraying the same role for the longest time (1971–2020).&quot;

On 29 December 2021, de las Nieves tested positive for COVID-19. She announced it on social media, adding that she was experiencing mild symptoms.

<text>Block Island is an island of the Outer Lands coastal archipelago in New England, located approximately south of mainland Rhode Island and east of Long Island&#x27;s Montauk Point. The island is coterminous with the town of New Shoreham, Rhode Island and is part of Washington County. The island is named after Dutch explorer Adriaen Block, and the town was named for Shoreham, Kent, in England.

Block Island is a popular summer tourist destination known for its bicycling, hiking, sailing, fishing, and beaches. It is home to the historic lighthouses Block Island North Light, on the northern tip of the island, and Block Island Southeast Light, on the southeastern coast. About 40 percent of the island is set aside for conservation, and much of the northwestern tip of the island is an undeveloped natural area and resting stop for birds along the Atlantic flyway. The Nature Conservancy includes Block Island on its list of &quot;The Last Great Places&quot;, which consists of 12 sites in the Western Hemisphere.

Popular events include the annual Fourth of July Parade, celebration, and fireworks. The island&#x27;s population can triple over the normal summer vacation crowd. As of the 2020 Census, the island&#x27;s population is 1,410 living on a land area of .

==History==
===Before 1637===

Block Island was formed by the same receding glaciers that formed the Outer Lands of Cape Cod, the Hamptons, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, and Nantucket during the end of the last ice age thousands of years ago.
The Niantic people called the island &quot;Manisses&quot; (meaning &quot;Manitou&#x27;s Little Island&quot;), or just &quot;Little Island&quot;. Archaeological sites indicate that these people lived largely by hunting deer, catching fish and shellfish, and growing corn, beans, and squash, presumably with the Three Sisters technique. They migrated from forest to coastal areas to take advantage of seasonal resources. One modern researcher has theorized that indigenous groups may have established a settlement as early as 500 BC, although there is no consensus on that idea.

Giovanni da Verrazzano sighted the island in 1524 and named it &quot;Claudia&quot; in honor of Claude, Duchess of Brittany, queen consort of France and the wife of Francis I. However, several contemporaneous maps identified the same island as &quot;Luisa&quot;, after Louise of Savoy, the Queen Mother of France and the mother of Francis I. Verrazano&#x27;s ship log stated that the island was &quot;full of hilles, covered with trees, well-peopled for we saw fires all along the coaste.&quot; Almost 100 years later, Dutch explorer Adriaen Block charted the island in 1614; he simply named it for himself, and this was the name that stuck.

===Pequot War===
The growing tensions among the tribes of the region in this time caused the Niantics to split into two divisions: the Western Niantics, who allied with the Pequots and Mohegans, and the Eastern Niantics, who allied with the Narragansetts.

In 1632, indigenous people (likely Western Niantics associated with the Pequots) killed colonial traders John Stone and Walter Norton, and the Pequots of eastern Connecticut were blamed. A Pequot delegation presented magistrates in Boston with two bushels of wampum and a bundle of sticks representing the number of beavers and otters with which they would compensate the colonists for the deaths. They sought peace with the colonies and also requested help establishing concord with the Narragansetts, who bordered them to the east. The colonial authorities, in turn, demanded the people responsible for killing Stone and Norton, a promise not to interfere with colonial settlement in Connecticut, and 400 fathoms of wampum and the pelts of 40 beavers and 30 otters.

In 1636, John Gallup came across the boat of trader John Oldham, a noted troublemaker. Oldham had flirted with impropriety since the day that he landed on American soil. Not long after arriving in Plymouth in 1623, he &quot;grew very perverse and showed a spirit of great malignancy,&quot; according to Plymouth Colony Governor William Bradford. He was later accused of religious subversion and responded with impertinence, hurling invective at his accusers and even drawing a knife on Captain Myles Standish. He was banished from Plymouth and fled to Massachusetts Bay, settling first in Nantasket, then Cape Ann, and finally Watertown, where he continued to indulge his penchant for mayhem. Despite his unsavory reputation, Massachusetts Bay sought his extensive knowledge of the New England coast when they asked him to retrieve a hefty ransom on the colony&#x27;s behalf. It was on this mission that Oldham was murdered and dismembered.

In August, the Massachusetts authorities dispatched a punitive expedition of ninety men to Block Island under the command of John Endicott to avenge Oldham&#x27;s murder. The expedition was ordered by governor of Massachusetts Sir Henry Vane to &quot;massacre all of the Native men on the island&quot; and capture the women and children, who would then be sold into slavery. Upon arriving on Block Island, the expedition burned sixty Niantic wigwams and all the cornfields on the island. The expedition also shot every dog they could find, though the Niantic fled into the woods and the colonists killed fourteen people. Deciding that this murder spree and razing was insufficient, Endicott and his men sailed over to Fort Saybrook before going after the Pequot village at the mouth of the Thames River to demand one thousand fathoms of wampum to pay for the murder. They took some Pequot children as hostages to ensure payment, with these incidents being seen as the initial events that led to the Pequot War.

===Settlement===
Massachusetts Bay Colony claimed the island by conquest. In 1658, the colony sold the island to a group of men headed up by Endicott. In 1661, the Endicott group sold the island to a party of twelve settlers that later grew to sixteen (of whom only seven actually settled there) led by John Alcock, who are today memorialized at Settler&#x27;s Rock, near Cow&#x27;s Cove. In 1663, island settler Thomas Terry gave six acres of land at the island&#x27;s largest fresh pond and its surrounding area to four &quot;chief sachems&quot;. Their names were recorded as Ninnecunshus, Jaguante, Tunkawatten, and Senatick, but they were known by the colonists as Mr. Willeam, Repleave (Reprive), and Soconosh. This land was given to &quot;them being the Cheife Sachems upon the Island there Heires &amp; Assignes Forever to plant and Improve&quot;. This land was then known as the Indian Lands. The Sachems called the Fresh Pond Tonnotounknug. In 1664, Indians on the island numbered somewhere from 1,200 to 1,500. By 1774, that number had been reduced to fifty-one. A Dutch map of 1685 clearly shows Block Island, indicated as &quot;Adriaen Blocks Eylant&quot; (&quot;Adrian Block&#x27;s Island&quot;).

In the late seventeenth century, an Englishwoman called named Sarah Sands &quot;née&quot; Walker lived on Block Island. Sands is known for being New England&#x27;s first woman doctor and she has also been suggested to be an early abolitionist. She married sea captain James Sands (one of the original sixteen settlers, as recorded by Settler&#x27;s Rock) in 1645 and had possibly six children, including a daughter named Mercy, born 1663. In 1699, Scottish sailor William Kidd visited Block Island shortly before he was hanged for piracy. At Block Island, he was supplied by Mercy Sands (then Mrs. Raymond). The story has it that, for her hospitality, Kidd bade Mrs. Raymond to hold out her apron, into which he threw gold and jewels until it was full. After her husband Joshua Raymond died, Mercy moved with her family to what would become the Raymond-Bradford Homestead in northern New London, Connecticut (later Montville) where she bought much land. The Raymond family was thus said to have been &quot;enriched by the apron&quot;.

Block Island was incorporated by the Rhode Island general assembly in 1672, and the island government adopted the name &quot;New Shoreham&quot;.

===Post-Colonial Period===
During the War of 1812, Block Island was briefly occupied by a Royal Navy squadron under the command of Sir Thomas Hardy, which included the ships &quot;Dispatch&quot;, &quot;Terror&quot;, &quot;Nimrod&quot;, &quot;Pactolus&quot;, and &quot;Ramillies&quot;. Hardy had taken his squadron to Block Island in search of food and to establish a strategic position at the mouth of the Long Island Sound, but discovered that nearly all of the island&#x27;s livestock and food stores had already been transferred to Stonington, Connecticut. On August 9, 1814, Hardy&#x27;s squadron departed Block Island for Stonington in part to capture the transferred food stores and livestock. Hardy&#x27;s pre-dawn raid on the town a day later was repulsed in a battle that has since become known as the Battle of Stonington.

The original North Lighthouse was built in 1829, but it was replaced in 1837 after the original was washed out to sea. The ocean claimed the replacement lighthouse also, and the lighthouse that can be seen today was constructed in 1867. Construction began on Block Island&#x27;s Southeast Lighthouse a few years later in 1873.

Block Island has no natural harbors; breakwaters were constructed in 1870 to form Old Harbor. 
New Harbor was created in 1895 when a channel was dug to connect the Great Salt Pond to the ocean through the northwestern side of the island.

The Island Free Library was established in 1875 and is Block Island&#x27;s only public library.

Isaac Church was the Island&#x27;s last recorded full-blooded Manisses Indian; he died in 1886 at age 100. He was survived by one son and one daughter whose descendants still reside in Rhode Island today. The landmark Isaac&#x27;s Corner is named in honor of him, located at the intersection of Center Road, Lakeside Drive, and Cooneymus Road. Isaac is buried to the east of the four corners in the Historical Indian Burial Ground. In 2011, the Block Island Historical Society dedicated the Block Island Manissean Ancestral Stone. In attendance at the unveiling ceremony were descendants of the Manisses Indians, with Tiondra White Rapids Martinez, a direct descendant of Isaac Church, opening the ceremony in their native tongue.

During World War II, several artillery spotters were located on the island to direct fire from the heavy gun batteries at Fort Greene in Point Judith which protected the entrance to Narragansett Bay. Lookout positions for the spotters were built to look like houses. The US government offered to evacuate the island, as it could not be effectively defended from enemy invasion, but the islanders chose to stay. Days before the war ended against Germany, the Battle of Point Judith took place seven miles to the northeast of the island.

The island&#x27;s airport (KBID) was opened in 1950 and remains open today as a general aviation airport.
 In 1972, the Block Island Conservancy was founded. The Conservancy and other environmental organizations are responsible for protecting over 40% of the island from development. In 1974, Old Harbor Historic District was declared a National Register historic district. More information can be found in the following books concerning Block Island&#x27;s old buildings, islanders, history, and ongoing efforts to conserve the land, together with a collection of 800 period photographs of the island spanning the 1870s to the 1980s and all by historian Robert M. Downie:

*&quot;The Block Island History of Photography&quot;, 2 volumes
The students of New Shoreham in grades kindergarten through 12th grade attend Block Island School. Harbor Church was founded on October 23, 1765 and is located at 21 Water Street.

==Climate==
Block Island&#x27;s weather is greatly influenced by the surrounding ocean. The climate is oceanic (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;), bordering a humid continental (&quot;Dfa/Dfb&quot;) and humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;). The ocean stays cool during the winter and spring months, but remains warm enough that average temperatures are several degrees warmer than inland areas of Rhode Island. In summer, while the ocean warms to near 70 F, it still keeps Block Island cooler than locations inland. As such, Block Island has a frost free season longer than locations inland. Block Island averages 2300 hrs of sunshine annually (higher than the USA average).

Block Island&#x27;s record high temperature is on August 26 and 27, 1948 and the record low is on January 16, 1994. The lowest high temperature on record was on December 31, 1962, and January 8, 1968, and the highest low temperature on record was on August 2, 1979. The hardiness zone is now 7b. 

== Demographics ==
The population of New Shoreham was 1,410 at the 2020 census, making it the least-populous municipality in the state. The population density was . There were 1,818 housing units in the town. The racial makeup of the town was 90.43% White, 1.21% African American, 0.50% Native American, 0.35% Asian, 0.00% Pacific Islander, 3.90% from other races, and 3.62% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.68% of the population.

===Annual events===
One of the most popular celebrations on the island is the Fourth of July Parade. Anybody can enter a float into the parade, as long as it coordinates with the theme of that respective year. For example, the theme in 2016 was sports and recreation. In addition to the parade, there is a fireworks display on the beach on the night of July 3. The parade is on the fourth and is judged by officials who award prizes in three categories: family floats, company floats, and overall floats. They also give out one extra prize for the overall category which is the grand prize, consisting of $500.

Every summer, the island hosts Block Island Race Week, a competitive, week-long sailboat race. In odd years, the event is held by the Storm Trysail Club, and on even years by the Block Island Race Week. Yachts compete in various classes, sailing courses in Block Island Sound and circumnavigating the island.

Every year, the island also hosts the Block Island Film Festival, an international film festival established in 2018 by journalist and filmmaker Cassius Shuman. The festival aims to promote independent works from local and international filmmakers, showcasing motion pictures, documentaries, short films and student short films.

Block Island Pride is a pride celebration held every summer, that commemorates and supports the LGBTQ+ community. The event features a variety of activities, including parades, live performances, and educational workshops, promoting inclusivity and diversity on the island.

===Tourist attractions===
Southeast Lighthouse is located at the southeast corner of the island on the Mohegan Trail. The lighthouse was constructed in 1875 and remains to this day an active US Coast Guard navigational aid. The lighthouse was moved in 1993, in danger of falling off the bluffs due to erosion. In addition to offering tours of the tower, the lighthouse has a museum that is open during the summer season.

The Mohegan Bluffs are located a short distance to the west of Southeast Lighthouse. The bluffs are the site of a pre-colonial battle between the invading Mohegan and the native Niantic, in which the Mohegan were driven off the edge of the tall cliffs to their deaths on the beach below. A staircase of 141 steps leads to the bottom of these clay cliffs and looks out over the Atlantic. On clear days, Montauk, New York, can be seen in the distance from the southern and western sides of the island.
Rodman&#x27;s Hollow is a glacial outwash basin, near the southern shore of the island. The hollow has several walking trails.

North Lighthouse is located at Sandy Point on the northern tip of Block Island. The North Lighthouse warns boaters of a sandbar extending from this end of the island. The surrounding dunes are part of the Block Island National Wildlife Refuge, home to many species, including the piping plover and American burying beetle. A short walk away from the North Lighthouse lies the tip of the island, with ocean on both sides of a thin strip of land.

The Block Island Historical Society Museum is located near the downtown area and contains a broad array of Block Island artifacts.

 is a U-boat wreck east of the island, lying in of water. Recreational divers frequently visit the wreck, though at least three have died there.

The Block Island Wind Farm, the first offshore wind farm built in the United States, is located from south-east of the island. The five turbines, each high, commenced commercial operation in December 2016.

The island has at least 40 restaurants, but most are closed outside of tourist season; mainland restaurants use New England Airlines to deliver food to the island.

==Parks and recreation==

There are 17 miles of beach on Block Island. Crescent Beach can be viewed from the Pt. Judith Ferry and the New London Express Ferry on the way to the island. It contains five smaller beaches: Fred Benson Town Beach (popularly known as State Beach), Surf Beach, Scotch Beach, Rouse&#x27;s Beach, and Mansion Beach, all of which are located on Corn Neck Road. North of Mansion Beach are Clayhead and Pots &amp; Kettles. Clayhead is a set of cliffs which can be seen from the ferry in from Point Judith or New London. This area is rocky and contains iron-rich clay deposits, and is a popular area for shell and rock hunting.

Cow Cove, Settler&#x27;s Rock, and Sandy Point make up the northernmost point of Block Island where the North Lighthouse is located. Settler&#x27;s Rock is located at Cow Cove, where the settlers landed and swam to shore bringing with them the island&#x27;s first cows, which they pushed off the boats and forced ashore. Attached to the rock is a plaque naming the original settlers of Block Island. Coastguard Beach (or &quot;the channel&quot;) is situated between the Great Salt Pond and the ocean on the north west side of the island. Ballard&#x27;s Beach is on the south side of the Block Island Ferry Dock and jetty. Bluffs Beach (or Vail) is set at the bottom of Mohegan Bluffs.

Block Island also hosts an office of The Nature Conservancy. The Conservancy named Block Island as one of its top 12 sites in the Western Hemisphere, and a large portion of the island is legally protected and set aside for conservation.

==Industry==
The island is known for participating in the commercial aquaculture and kelp farming sectors.

==Transportation==

The island is connected year-round by a ferry to Point Judith, and in summer to New London, Connecticut; Orient and Montauk, New York; and Newport, Rhode Island. The traditional ferry takes about an hour to reach the island from Point Judith and is the only way to bring a car to the island as it is able to carry them. A high-speed ferry on the same route takes 35 minutes but cannot take cars, and another high-speed ferry from New London takes just over an hour.

Bikes are a popular form of transportation on the island, as cars are generally discouraged. Additionally, mopeds are quite popular, especially with tourists, since they are easy to rent and drive. This popularity has led to over six moped rental shops on the island, but the same popularity and ease of use has led to many incidents over 40 years with reckless or bad drivers, meaning that moped accidents are a common problem on the island.

New England Airlines offers regularly scheduled 12-minute flights to Block Island State Airport from Westerly, Rhode Island. The island airport is officially called Block Island State (code: BID) and the terminal is about one mile from the town center.

==Incidents==
===Air crashes===
On August 26, 1995, a Cessna 185 seaplane carrying four people crashed while attempting to land in the waters off Old Harbor Beach, an area not normally used for seaplane landings. The plane cleared a dune but hit a power line, causing it to crash into a restaurant and hit a car at the island&#x27;s only gas station. All four people on the plane perished, as well as a woman who was sitting in her car as it was being fueled. The restaurant was destroyed by the impact of the plane and resulting fire.

On July 5, 2006, a plane carrying three people crashed west of the airport during bad weather. The aircraft had just taken off and was on its way to White Plains, New York.

===Shipwrecks===
The area around Block Island has been the site of numerous shipwrecks, including the Steamer &quot;Larchmont&quot; in 1907. The 1738 wreck of the &quot;Princess Augusta&quot; (also known as the Palatine ship) was later immortalized by John Greenleaf Whittier in his 1867 poem &quot;The Wreck of the Palatine&quot;. In 1877, the freighter &quot;Achilles&quot; struck a submerged rock off the island and ran aground. In 1992, the Cunard liner &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; struck a submerged rock.

Two submarines also sank off Block Island: in 1925, and in 1945.

<text>The International Nuclear Information System (INIS) hosts one of the world&#x27;s largest collections of published information on the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology.

==History==
One of the founding purposes of the International Atomic Energy Agency is &quot;to foster the exchange of scientific and technical information on the peaceful uses of atomic energy.&quot; Concurrently, the publication Nuclear Science Abstracts was produced by the United States Atomic Energy Commission at Oak Ridge, Tennessee beginning in 1948. Nuclear Science Abstracts sought to fully cover the world&#x27;s nuclear science literature. By 1968, it had partnerships with 316 institutions in 44 countries The director of NSA, Edward J. Brunenkant, realized that the further development and expansion of NSA would not be possible without the backing of an international organization. At the third U.N. Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1964, Bunenkant proposed that the effort be undertaken by the IAEA. In 1966, consultants from the Soviet Union and United States (Lev. L. Issaev, and Raymond K. Wakerling, respectively) met in Vienna to explore the possibilities, and to develop parameters of the programme that would be acceptable to both countries. The consultants produced a set of recommendations, and in December of that year, the IAEA convened a working group of 16 countries and 3 international organization to agree on the final parameters of the programme.

==System configuration==
The system receives bibliographic references and full-text reports from member states and organizations represented by INIS Liaison Officers in each of those entities. The IAEA supplements these contributions by acquiring bibliographic references from publishers and repositories in its scope. In its first year of operation, some 3,944 bibliographic references were provided, 644 also containing a full-text non-conventional literature, also called grey literature. By the end of 2022, the system had grown to 4,654,908 bibliographic references, with 431,670 of those full-text.

In the first years of publication, INIS was provided in book form and microfiche. Now all records are available on the website INIS Repository Search.

INIS is based in Vienna, Austria and has been operating since 1970. INIS is operated by the International Atomic Energy Agency in collaboration with 132 Member States and 17 co-operating international organizations. All the content it holds is currently available free to &quot;all Internet users around the world&quot;.

<text>The Territory of Michigan was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from June 30, 1805, until January 26, 1837, when the final extent of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Michigan. Detroit was the territorial capital.

==History and government==
The earliest European explorers of Michigan saw it mostly as a place to control the fur trade. Small military forces, Jesuit missions to Native American tribes, and isolated settlements of trappers and traders accounted for most of the non-native inhabitants of what would become Michigan.

===Early government in Michigan===
After the arrival of Europeans, the area that became the Michigan Territory was first under French and then British control. The first Jesuit mission, in 1668 at Sault Saint Marie, led to the establishment of further outposts at St. Ignace (where a mission began work in 1671) and Detroit, first occupied in 1701 by the garrison of the former Fort de Buade under the leadership of Antoine de La Mothe Cadillac. Soon after their arrival, his troops erected Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit and a church dedicated to Saint Anne, the mother of the Virgin Mary. As part of New France, the upper Great Lakes had first been governed from Michilimackinac, then Detroit; this was essentially a military regime that reported to the governor-general at Quebec. Its role was to supply the needs of the fur traders and discourage any settlements not directly supportive of that effort. After the surrender of Montreal in 1760, British troops under Robert Rogers occupied Detroit and its dependent posts. In 1763, Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion saw the fall of Fort Michilimackinac to the northern tribes, and a lengthy siege of Fort Detroit. The siege was lifted in 1764, and rule under a British lieutenant-governor at Detroit followed soon thereafter.

Due to the Quebec Act of 1774, Michigan was governed during the Revolution as part of the Province of Quebec. Although the 1783 Treaty of Paris gave the fledgling United States a claim to what is now Michigan, British policy was to hold on to Detroit and its dependencies at all costs. In 1784, Baron von Steuben would be sent to Canada by the Congress of the Confederation in a diplomatic capacity to address the question of Detroit and the Great Lakes, but Frederick Haldimand, the Governor of Quebec, refused to provide a passport, and negotiations collapsed before they had begun. Starting in 1784, the British administered their Michigan holdings as part of the District of Hesse along with what is now Western Ontario; in 1791 the Province of Quebec was split into Lower Canada (today&#x27;s Province of Quebec) and Upper Canada (Ontario), and the districts of Upper Canada were renamed the next year, with the Hesse District designated as the Western District.

In addition to the British remaining in the region, several states also held competing claims on the future state of Michigan. In 1779, Virginia established Illinois County with boundaries that encompassed all of the land east of the Mississippi River, north of the Ohio River and west of the Appalachian Mountains. For all practical purposes, however, the county government never exercised actual control beyond an area limited to a few old French settlements along the major rivers. The overwhelming majority of the northwestern lands were controlled by the native tribes. New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts also claimed portions of what was to become Michigan, but were even less able to enforce their pretensions, given Britain&#x27;s control of the Great Lakes and the hostility of the tribes.

Virginia surrendered its claim to lands north and west of the Ohio River effective March 1, 1784. Coincidentally (or not), this was the same day that the findings of a Congressional committee on the western lands, chaired by Thomas Jefferson since the previous October, were reported. Jefferson&#x27;s recommendations became the basis for the Land Ordinance of 1784, which established that new states equal in all respects to the founding thirteen would be erected in the territory, that they would forever be a part of the United States, and that their governments would be republican in form. The Land Ordinance of 1785 would go further by establishing a procedure for land sales in the new territory. However, the Ohio River remained an effective boundary between the United States and the Northwest tribes for a few more years.

The other states with claims in the Northwest eventually followed Virginia&#x27;s example, and in 1787, the Congress of the Confederation enacted the Northwest Ordinance, which created the Northwest Territory. The first settlement under the Northwest Ordinance was at Marietta (Ohio) in 1788.

The region that became Michigan was initially unorganized territory and essentially remained under British control; that did not stop Arthur St. Clair, the first Governor of the Northwest Territory, from establishing a structure of government for the area, if only on paper. Knox County was established on June 20, 1790 with boundaries that included the western half of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and roughly the middle third of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. In 1792, the boundaries of Hamilton County were expanded to include the eastern portions of Michigan not included in Knox County.

American claims to Michigan were frustrated by Britain&#x27;s refusal to evacuate the forts at Detroit, Mackinac and elsewhere. Britain&#x27;s tacit support for the Northwest tribes during the Northwest Indian War was dependent on Detroit remaining out of American hands. But the position of the British and their allies in the Northwest deteriorated after the signing of Jay&#x27;s Treaty and the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, and after negotiations, the British evacuated Detroit on July 11, 1796. The United States had finally established a presence in Michigan. Fort Mackinac was turned over soon after but Drummond Island remained as part of Canada until 1828.

===Beginnings of American rule===
By proclamation of acting governor and territorial secretary Winthrop Sargent, the &quot;first&quot; Wayne County was established from Knox and Hamilton counties on August 15, 1796, and included most of the area that later became the Michigan Territory, as well as portions of what are now Ohio and Indiana.

In 1800, the western half of the Lower Peninsula and most of the Upper Peninsula were attached to the Indiana Territory when it was established as a separate government from the Northwest Territory. Wayne County was thereby reduced to the remainder of the two peninsulas, and continued under the government of the Northwest Territory. St. Clair County, another Indiana Territory county, was also expanded at this time to include the western portion of the Upper Peninsula and a small sliver of the Lower Peninsula along the shore of Lake Michigan.

When Ohio was admitted as a state in early 1803, the eastern half of Michigan was incorporated into the Indiana Territory. One of the first acts taken that year by the Indiana government under William Henry Harrison was to reorganize Wayne County under Indiana law, adding territory from Knox and St. Clair counties. Michigan&#x27;s first county now encompassed all of the Lower Peninsula, much of the Upper Peninsula, and those portions of today&#x27;s Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin that drained into Lake Michigan. In many respects, the change from the government of the Northwest Territory to that of the Indiana Territory had little effect on Wayne County&#x27;s limited operations. By Governor Harrison&#x27;s proclamation of January 11, 1803, the courts of Wayne County—common pleas, orphans, and quarter sessions—kept their organization under the new territorial government, with almost identical composition.

But the logistics of government went from difficult to almost impossible, with the mail between Detroit and the capital at Vincennes being routed at one point through Warren in northeastern Ohio. The deciding factor may have come when an election was called by Governor Harrison for September 11, 1804, to decide whether Indiana Territory (which by this time was responsible for not only the settlements in Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois, but the newly acquired District of Louisiana as well) should progress to the second stage of territorial government. But word failed to reach Detroit until after the date had passed, and the settlers of Michigan petitioned Congress in December 1804, asking that Wayne County be set off as an independent territory.

===Organization===
Michigan Territory was established by an act of the United States Congress on January 11, 1805, effective June 30 of that year. The act defined the territory as &quot;all that part of the Indiana Territory, which lies North of a line drawn east from the southerly bend or extreme of lake Michigan, until it shall intersect lake Erie, and East of a line drawn from the said southerly bend through the middle of said lake to its northern extremity, and thence due north to the northern boundary of the United States.&quot; A historical marker at a roadside park, approximately three miles east of Naubinway at , commemorates the northernmost point of Lake Michigan, which is located approximately one mile west of the park.

The first territorial governor, William Hull, abolished Wayne County and established new districts of his own making, which proved to be short-lived. Lewis Cass became governor in 1813 and promptly undid Hull&#x27;s work and re-established a third incarnation of Wayne County that included all lands within Michigan Territory that had been ceded by Indians through the 1807 Treaty of Detroit.

During the War of 1812, following General Isaac Brock&#x27;s capture of Detroit on August 16, 1812, the Michigan Territory was at least nominally a part of the Province of Upper Canada. On August 24, Colonel Henry Proctor proclaimed the continuation of civil government under existing laws with Proctor acting as Governor and Chief Justice Augustus B. Woodward acting as Secretary. On February 4, 1813, Proctor suspended civil government and imposed martial law.

When Indiana (1816) and Illinois (1818) joined the Union, remnants of their territories were joined to Michigan Territory. An area equal to 30 townships was also transferred from Michigan Territory to Indiana to allow that state access to Lake Michigan. Soon afterward, the federal government rapidly began signing treaties with local Native American tribes and acquiring their lands.

In 1818, a general assembly referendum was held to determine whether a majority of the territory&#x27;s freeholders favored the creation of a general legislative assembly to replace the system of governors and judges in effect at the time, as provided for by the Northwest Ordinance. The election was called by Territorial Governor Lewis Cass, and results showed a majority opposed changing the system of government.

In 1824, the Michigan Territory graduated to the second grade of territorial status, and the government&#x27;s power was transferred from the Governor and a handful of judges to the people. The people elected 18 to the Legislative Council, of which nine were approved by the President, and it first sat in council on June 7, 1824. This council was expanded from nine members to 13 in 1825, with the 13 being chosen by the President from a field of 26.

The Erie Canal opened in 1825, allowing settlers from New England and New York to reach Michigan by water through Albany and Buffalo.

In 1834, all of the lands acquired in the Louisiana Purchase that were as yet unallocated and lay east of the Missouri River (generally, the Dakotas, Iowa and the western half of Minnesota) were attached to the Michigan Territory, an area that was officially characterized as &quot;north of Missouri and east of the Missouri and White Earth Rivers.&quot; At this point, Michigan Territory included what is now the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota and a large portion of the Dakotas.


Meanwhile, in 1835, the Toledo War was fought with Ohio because Michigan Territory wanted to retain the disputed &quot;Toledo Strip.&quot; The Toledo area of Ohio was finally surrendered in exchange for the western section of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.

Slavery was forbidden in the territory under the Northwest Ordinance, but British and French residents in Michigan were permitted to retain possession of slaves already owned at the time the territory became organized. Census records show that the slave population in the territory numbered 24 in 1810 and 32 in 1830. It is believed that those counted as slaves were, in many cases, Indians rather than blacks.

On July 3, 1836, in preparation for Michigan statehood, the Wisconsin Territory was organized from Michigan Territory, consisting of the present states of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and the eastern portion of the Dakotas. Michigan became a state on January 26, 1837, and included the Upper Peninsula as part of the resolution to the conflict over the Toledo Strip, which had blocked Michigan statehood for several years. The western border of the Upper Peninsula was marked at the Montreal River on the Lake Superior shoreline and the Menominee River on the coast of Lake Michigan. Detroit remained the capital until March 17, 1847 when Lansing was chosen as a replacement. The population of Michigan at the time of statehood is estimated to have been about 200,000, which was well above the Northwest Ordinance&#x27;s minimum requirement of 60,000.

==Territorial acquisition==
The area that became Michigan had been British territory, and was ceded to the United States in 1783, although the native peoples of the area had not ceded control to either the British or Americans for most of the territory by 1783. The majority of it was gained by cession, coerced or otherwise. The people who resided in Michigan before American settlement were the Ottawa, the Potawatomi, Ojibwa and the Wyandot. Treaties ceding the land were signed between 1795 (the Treaty of Greenville) and 1842 (the Treaty of La Pointe). Other notable treaties were Governor Hull&#x27;s treaty of 1808, the Treaty of Saginaw in 1819, the two Treaties of Chicago (1821 and 1833), the Carey Mission in 1828 and the Treaty of Washington in 1836 and a later treaty of January 14, 1837.

==Territorial subdivisions==

Wayne County, Michigan, originally part of the vast Northwest Territory, was eventually whittled down into its current size by the separation of several tracts: Monroe in 1817, Michilimackinac County (later called Mackinac) and Macomb counties in 1818, St. Clair and St. Joseph counties in 1820 and Washtenaw County in 1822. The first township organization was Detroit, in Wayne County, in 1802.

Also organized in 1818 were two counties that survive in present-day Wisconsin. Crawford was set up to govern the settlements on the upper Mississippi River from its seat at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, while Brown performed a similar function for the settlements around Green Bay. These would become part of the Wisconsin Territory in 1836.

Oakland County, Michigan was created in 1819, and over time was subdivided into all or parts of Genesee, Lapeer, Sanilac, Shiawassee and Saginaw counties. Saginaw County would be split further into eight separate counties, three of which (Isabella, Arenac and Midland) were established during the territorial period.

Lenawee County was created in 1822 from what had been Native American lands, and Hillsdale County was separated from it in 1829. Other parts of Lenawee were turned into Cass and Berrien. Branch also sprung fully formed from Michigan Territory in 1829.

Chippewa County was created from Michilimackinac County in 1826.

Kalamazoo County, established 1829 from St. Joseph County, was the dominant tract in Western Michigan and was divided and subdivided into many other counties: Allegan, Barry, Calhoun, Eaton, Ionia, Montcalm, Kent, Ottawa and Clinton (some created during the territorial period, others split off later).

Jackson and Ingham were created in 1829 from Washtenaw; Isabella was created from parts of Saginaw and Midland counties in 1831. Gratiot County was also established in 1831, with land from Saginaw and Clinton counties.

Seven of the 12 counties created in 1829 were named for members of President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s Cabinet, and one was named for Jackson himself.

Iowa County, with its seat at Mineral Point, was established in 1829 and transferred to the Wisconsin Territory in 1836.

Michigan Territory briefly governed lands west of the Mississippi, after the statehood of Missouri left the area north of the new state as unorganized territory; this comprised what is now Iowa and that part of Minnesota west of the river. Such was the case until 1834, when that area was placed under the government of Michigan Territory. Dubuque and Des Moines counties were created in 1834, and transferred to the Wisconsin Territory in 1836 upon its organization.

Milwaukee County was established in 1834 and was also transferred to Wisconsin Territory two years later.

==Territorial population==
These census numbers do not include most Native Americans, defined in the U.S. Constitution as &quot;Indians not taxed&quot; (Article I, Sec. 2). Under the Northwest Ordinance, a territory could apply for statehood once it had surpassed 60,000 inhabitants.

The 1830 United States census reported the following population counts for 13 counties in present-day Michigan and 3 in Wisconsin. The boundaries of counties at that time differed significantly from present-day boundaries. The 1810 United States census was reported in terms of four Civil Districts of a single Wayne County: Michilimackinac, Detroit, Erie, and Huron. The 1810 population shown in the table for Mackinac County is that reported for Michilimackinac Civil District, for Macomb County that reported for Huron Civil District. for Monroe County that reported for Erie Civil District, and for Wayne County that reported for Detroit Civil District.
==Territorial officers==

===Governors===
===Secretaries===
===Supreme Court===
From 1805 through 1823, Territorial Supreme Court Justices were appointed by the U.S. president, with consent of the U.S. Senate. Their terms had no fixed limits. In 1823, the U.S. Congress passed an act reorganizing territorial government and setting a four-year term of office for justices.

==Congressional delegates==

In 1819, Michigan Territory was given the authority to elect a Congressional delegate.

<text>Point Judith is a village and a small cape, on the coast of Narragansett, Rhode Island, United States, on the western side of Narragansett Bay where it opens out onto Rhode Island Sound.
It is the location for the year-round ferry service that connects Block Island to the mainland and contains the fishing hamlet of Galilee.

==History==
Point Judith was either named for Judith Thatcher or Judith Hull. Judith Thatcher was a passenger on a small vessel with her father when it ran aground on the point and was almost wrecked. Judith is said to have rendered great service and as a result the vessel was saved. In remembrance of this the crew called the point after her name. According to Edmund Quincy&#x27;s 1874 biography of his father Josiah Quincy, Point Judith was named after Judith Hull by her husband John Hull.

In the mid-17th Century Point Judith was mined by Hull in the search for &quot;black lead&quot;, hoping to find silver. Hull was the treasurer and minted coinage for the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Unsuccessful with this endeavor, Hull established a business to raise coach horses for sale within New England but also for plantations in Virginia and Barbados.

During the American Revolution, the British controlled Narragansett Bay and raided and burned the farms on Point Judith and the surrounding areas in the late 1770s under Captain Wallace.

During World War II, Fort Greene was built with 16-inch guns and others to control the approaches to Narragansett Bay.

Point Judith is the site of the last sinking of an Allied ship in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II. On May 5, 1945, at 05:40, the torpedoed the collier, , en route to Boston, She was within sight of the United States Coast Guard lighthouse station at Point Judith. The lookout at the lighthouse was just preparing to enter the sighting in his logbook when he heard the sound of the torpedo exploding as it hit the ship. &quot;Black Point&quot; sank within twenty-five minutes. Twelve lives were lost among her crew, while thirty-four survivors were rescued. The resulting United States Navy and Coast Guard hunt for the U-853 is now often referred to as the Battle of Point Judith. A United States Navy frigate, destroyers, destroyer escorts, and Coast Guard cutters converged on the waters off Point Judith. Attacks with depth charges and hedgehogs continued until the U-853&#x27;s destruction was confirmed the next morning by two blimps which dropped a few bombs on the Germans. U-853 may have been the last U-boat to sink a ship during World War II, but she also became the second to last one to be sunk. Her wreck lies in 135 feet of water and is a popular, but dangerous destination for sport divers; at least three divers have been killed there. &quot;U-853&quot; is recognized as a war grave with most of the 55 crew bodies remaining inside.

<doc id="437490" wikidata="Q1780007" url="?curid=437490" title="Aquidneck Island">
<text>Aquidneck Island ( ), officially known as Rhode Island, is an island in Narragansett Bay in the state of Rhode Island. The total land area is , which makes it the largest island in the bay. The 2020 United States Census reported its population as 60,109. The state of Rhode Island is named after the island; the United States Board on Geographic Names recognizes Rhode Island as the name for the island, although it is widely referred to as Aquidneck Island in the state and by the island&#x27;s residents.

Aquidneck Island is home to three towns: from north to south, Portsmouth, Middletown, and Newport.

==Etymology==
&quot;Aquidneck&quot; is derived from the Narragansett name for the island &quot;aquidnet&quot;. Roger Williams was an authority on the Narragansett language, but he stated that he never learned the word&#x27;s meaning.

==Island names over time ==
It is unclear how Aquidneck came to be known as Rhode Island, but the earliest known use of the name was in 1637 by Roger Williams, and it was officially applied to the island in 1644: &quot;Aquethneck shall be henceforth called the Ile of Rods or Rhod-Island.&quot; The name &quot;Isle of Rodes&quot; is used in a legal document as late as 1646.

One theory states that Adriaen Block passed by Aquidneck Island during his 1614 expedition, describing it in a 1625 account of his travels as &quot;an island of reddish appearance&quot; (in 17th century Dutch &quot;een rodlich Eylande&quot;). Dutch maps from as early as 1659 call it &quot;Roode Eylant&quot; or Red Island. Historians have theorized that it was named by the Dutch (possibly by Adriaen Block himself) for either the red autumn foliage or red clay on portions of the shore.

In 1644, the settlements on Rhode Island (Portsmouth and Newport) united with Providence Plantations and Warwick to form the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations and, eventually, the State of Rhode Island (formerly State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations). The entire state is now commonly referred to as Rhode Island, and the official name of Aquidneck Island is still &quot;Rhode Island&quot;. The United States Board on Geographic Names addressed the issue in 1930 by using both names of the island on its maps. By 1964, the board decided that having two names was confusing, and &quot;Rhode Island&quot; was used exclusively as the official name. Attempts have been made, as recently as 2004, to change the official name to &quot;Aquidneck Island&quot;, but all of these have failed. The name Aquidneck Island is widely used in Rhode Island to refer to the island, including by publications such as &quot;The Newport Daily News&quot;.

==History==
Colonists settled on Aquidneck Island in 1638 in the region that the Narragansetts called &quot;Pocasset&quot; (meaning &quot;where the stream widens&quot;), the northern part of Portsmouth. They engaged Roger Williams to negotiate the terms of their settlement of the island from the Narragansett sachems Canonicus and Miantonomi. These settlers included William Coddington, Anne and William Hutchinson, Philip Sherman, William Dyer, John Coggeshall, Nicholas Easton, William Brenton, John Clarke, and Richard Maxson (Maggsen). As a thank you for being allowed to settle Aquidneck Island, the settlers gave the Narragansetts 40 fathoms of white wampum, 20 hoes, 10 coats, and 5 more fathoms of wampum for the sachems. Canonicus and his nephew Miantonomi signed a deed for it. However, as Roger Williams made clear in a June 1638 letter to Puritan lawyer John Winthrop, one of the leading figures in founding the Massachusetts Bay Colony: &quot;Sir, concerning the islands Prudence and...Aquedenick ...neither of them were sold properly, for a thousand fathom would not have bought either, by strangers. The truth is, not a penny was demanded for either, and what was paid was only gratuity, though I chose, for better assurance and form, to call it sale.&quot; These first settlers founded Pocasset, but William Coddington chose Newport for a settlement the following spring (1639) because of its excellent harbor, and some of the settlers followed him there.

The British army occupied Aquidneck Island during the American Revolution from 1776 to 1779. The Continental Army under command of Major General John Sullivan attempted to drive them out in the Battle of Rhode Island on August 29, 1778, but without success.

==Schools==
The island is home to Salve Regina University, the Newport campus of the Community College of Rhode Island, and International Yacht Restoration School. Naval Station Newport is located on Aquidneck Island and the adjacent Coasters Harbor Island.

It is also home to two well known private boarding schools: St. George&#x27;s School in Middletown and Portsmouth Abbey School in Portsmouth. The island also contains numerous public and private primary and secondary schools as a part of the school systems of Newport, Middletown and Portsmouth.

==Bridges==
Aquidneck Island is served by three bridges: The Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge (1969) connects it to Jamestown on nearby Conanicut Island in Narragansett Bay, and subsequently to the mainland on the western side of the bay. The Mount Hope Bridge (1929) is adjacent to Bristol Ferry and Common Fence Point and connects the northern side of Aquidneck Island in Portsmouth to the mainland at Bristol. The Sakonnet River Bridge (2012) in Portsmouth connects the northeastern side of the island to the mainland at Tiverton over the Sakonnet River, a narrow saltwater strait. It is a replacement for a bridge of the same name built in 1956.

==Environmental contamination==
The west coast of Aquidneck Island is part of Naval Station Newport, a superfund site since 1989. Almost the entire area from its fuel tank farms drains into ditches and into Narragansett Bay. The Navy has been rehabilitating the property following contamination from petroleum, heavy metals, including lead and arsenic, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) where there were electrical transformers. In addition there is PFAS contamination of groundwater and in surface runoff water. The groundwater is used for irrigation on crops and lawn sprinkler systems.

==Medicine==
* António Egas Moniz develops cerebral angiography.

==Microbiology==

* Ronald Canti&#x27;s ground-breaking stop-motion cinematic technique vividly illustrates the microscopic behaviour of normal and neoplastic cells: irradiation is shown to cause immobilisation and mitotic arrest in suspensions of cells.

==Physics==
* February 23 – German theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg writes a letter to fellow physicist Wolfgang Pauli in which he describes his uncertainty principle for the first time.
* April – Abbé Georges Lemaître publishes in the &quot;Annales de la Société Scientifique de Bruxelles&quot; &quot;Un Univers homogène de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des nébuleuses extra-galactiques&quot; proposing the theory of the expansion of the Universe, deriving what will become known as Hubble&#x27;s law, making the first estimation of what will become called the Hubble constant, and proposing what becomes known as the Big Bang theory of the origin of the Universe, which he calls his &#x27;hypothesis of the primeval atom&#x27;.
* October – The fifth Solvay Conference meets in Brussels to discuss the newly formulated quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein attacks the theories of Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg.

==Technology==
* August 2 – American electrical engineer Harold Stephen Black invents the negative-feedback amplifier.
* September 7 – Philo Farnsworth&#x27;s electronic image dissector television camera tube transmits its first image at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco.
* November 5 – Completion of a bridge by Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing in Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania, the world&#x27;s first railroad bridge of wholly welded construction.
* Date unknown
** Emil Lerp invents the transportable gasoline chainsaw.
** Vibraphone developed in its modern form by Henry Schluter of J.C. Deagan, Inc. in the United States.

==Chemistry==
* Dirk Coster and George de Hevesy publish their discovery of the transition metal element hafnium (72Hf) in zirconium ore, working in Copenhagen (Latin: &quot;Hafnia&quot;).
* Niels Bohr and Dirk Coster, working in Copenhagen, produce a paper on X-ray spectroscopy and the periodic system of the elements.
* Gilbert N. Lewis and Merle Randall&#x27;s textbook &quot;Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Reactions&quot; is influential in the replacement of the concept of &quot;chemical affinity&quot; by &quot;free energy&quot;.

==Cryptography==
* Enigma machine first produced commercially.

==Electronics==
* Otto Julius Zobel of Bell Labs describes the type of signal processing filter sections based on the image impedance design principle which will become known as Zobel networks.

<text>Conanicut Island ( ) is an island in Narragansett Bay in the American state of Rhode Island. The second-largest in the Bay, it is connected on the east to Newport on Aquidneck Island by the Claiborne Pell Bridge, commonly known as the Newport Bridge, and on the west to North Kingstown on the mainland via the Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge. The town of Jamestown comprises the entire island. The U.S. Census Bureau reported a land area of and a population of 5,622 in 2000. A tombolo connects the southern part of Conanicut to an extension of the island to the southwest.

==History==
Conanicut Island was a seasonal home to the Narragansett tribe of American Indians. The largest Indian cemetery in New England is located on the island, and artifacts have been recovered from a site near the elementary school. The island is named for Chief Canonicus of the Narragansetts, who maintained his royal residence on the island.

In 1636 or 1637, Dutch fur traders paid to use the island of Quentenis (today’s Dutch Island, located just west of Conanicut) as a base for their activities. In 1638, the English colonists made arrangements to use Conanicut Island for grazing sheep, and Canonicus was one of the Narragansett sachems who gave consent. They referred to the island in his honor, and the Jamestown seal today includes the figure of a sheep. Conanicut Island was a part of the island territory included in a commission which the Council of State of England granted to William Coddington in 1651 separating them from the mainland and making him indefinite governor of the islands (later revoked).

In 1657, a consortium of about 100 buyers purchased Conanicut, Dutch, and Gould Islands. They divided Conanicut into roughly a dozen large plots and reserved Dutch Island and parts of Conanicut for common use. Benedict Arnold (great-grandfather of the Revolutionary War traitor, who became governor of the Colony of Rhode Island the same year) and William Case were among the purchasers.

The Indians and colonists lived side-by-side in relative peace for almost four decades. Conflicts eventually occurred in a number of places in southern New England, leading to what is known as King Philip&#x27;s War. Life in the region was dominated by the colonists after 1676, although Conanicut Island remained a haven for many Indians.

In 1725, a ferry was established between the island and Newport. Another ferry was established to South Kingstown in 1748.

<doc id="437502" wikidata="Q1444919" url="?curid=437502" title="Prudence Island">
<text>Prudence Island is the third-largest island in Narragansett Bay in the state of Rhode Island and part of the town of Portsmouth, Rhode Island, United States. It is located near the geographic center of the bay. It is defined by the United States Census Bureau as Block Group 3, Census Tract 401.03 of Newport County, Rhode Island. As of the 2010 census, the population was 278 people living on a land area of .

==History==
The Narragansett name for the island was &quot;Chibachuweset&quot; (or &quot;Chibachuwese&quot;), and the Narragansetts originally offered to gift it to John Oldham if he would settle there and set up a trading post. Oldham failed to meet the condition, so they gave the island to Roger Williams and John Winthrop in 1637, with each man retaining a one-half interest. Williams took the northern side of the island, and Winthrop took the southern side.

Williams and Winthrop hoped to farm pigs on the island. Williams named it &quot;Prudence&quot; and shortly afterwards purchased and named nearby Patience Island and Hope Island. He sold his half interest in Prudence Island while in England on behalf of the colony, and Winthrop willed his land to his son Stephen.

In colonial times, the island was used mainly for farming. During the American Revolution, the British forces under Captain James Wallace raided Prudence Island for livestock and engaged in a skirmish with American forces, losing approximately a dozen soldiers. In the 20th century, farming began to decline and the island began to attract summer residents. In World War II, the Navy established an ammunition depot on the southernmost of the island. In 1972, the Navy turned the base over to the State of Rhode Island, leaving bunkers, roads, and a large deep-water pier.

Several buildings and businesses that once stood on the island were destroyed by the 1938 New England hurricane and Hurricane Carol. As of 2018, the only business in operation on the island is a general store that doubles as the post office. The former naval base is now home to the Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, while Farnham Farm is a national historic site. The island is served by ferry service to Bristol, Rhode Island. Parts of the 2012 film &quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot; were filmed on the island and nearby Jamestown.

Prudence Island is the location of Rhode Island&#x27;s last one-room schoolhouse. It is operated by the Prudence Island School Foundation in cooperation with the Portsmouth school district and educates island children from kindergarten through fourth grade. The school has served the community on the island since 1896, with a six-year hiatus from 1982 to 1989. In 2019, three students were enrolled.

== Summer colonies on Prudence Island ==
There are several different summer colonies on the island. These are in order from the south:

* Prudence Park: on the west side of the island at the western end of Broadway. Development began in 1872 with the building of the Stone Wharf on the west side of the island which became a stop on the Fall River Line steamers running from Providence and Fall River to New York City. Most of the summer homes in this area of the island are fine examples of Victorian and Beaux-Arts architecture, in a similar style to those at Oak Bluffs on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. The Stone Wharf was severely damaged and many houses were lost in the hurricane of 1938.
* Bristol Colony: on the east side of the island at the eastern end of Broadway.
* Sandy Point: on the eastern side of the island, along Narragansett Avenue. Site of Prudence Island Light and the Town Dock, and a former landing point for the ferry.
* Homestead: plat of summer homes along the east coast of the island, north of Pier Road, to the north of the former Homestead Casino, which was lost in the hurricane of 1938, now the site of the island&#x27;s post office, general store, and ferry landing.
* Warnerville: directly north of the Homestead Plat, on Warner Avenue off Narragansett Avenue.
* Boystown Fly-in-Ranch: a small private airport on the northern part of the island.

== In popular culture ==
The &quot;Snow Island&quot; Trilogy tells the story of a fictionalized version of Prudence Island across two generations. The 2012 film Moonrise Kingdom was filmed in part on Prudence.

<text>Rużar Briffa (1906–1963) was a Maltese poet and dermatologist, and a major figure in Maltese literature.

&quot;I never thought of publishing these poems in a book. Some were written in hard times, others in moments of joy. And I wrote them for myself.&quot; These were the poet&#x27;s words as they appeared in his first collection of poetry, &quot;Poeżiji&quot;, published in 1971 thanks to his second wife Louisette and his friend P. Valentin Barbara&#x27;s constant encouragement.

==Life==

He was known as the poet &quot;of smallness and simplicity - the best&quot;. Rużar Briffa studied at the Saint Elmo elementary state school and at the Valletta Lyceum. Having obtained his matriculation certificate, in 1923 he started teaching at elementary schools. In 1924, he began his studies in medicine at the University of Malta and completed them in London in venereology and dermatology. In 1932 he became a specialist in skin diseases. He was known for his humility and his greatheartedness in dealing with his patients, especially those suffering from leprosy.

According to his wife Louisette, he dreamed of beautifying disfigured and suffering patients through his medical work. This aesthetic concern emerges frequently in his literary work, so much so that he was known as the &quot;Poet of Beauty&quot; amongst his contemporaries.

In 1931, together with his friend Ġużè Bonnici, he founded the Għaqda tal-Malti Università, which is active to date, and started issuing the magazine &quot;Leħen il-Malti&quot; (&quot;Voice of the Maltese&quot;).

Rużar Briffa died on 22 February 1963. His full biography was released in 1984 by Professor Oliver Friggieri.

The Maltese town of Mosta contains a road named in his honour, Triq Rużar Briffa.

==Poetry==

Many of his poems were written on bits of papers cut from notebooks or on the inner part of a used packet of cigarettes. Others were written on papers intended for medical prescriptions, on paper-bags; in short, he would use anything that was at hand to capture his poem on paper.

Although Briffa wrote very little, he was greatly appreciated by literary critics. These are some comments Briffa passed on poetry, as an individual interpretation and universal expression:

<text>Adolphustown is a geographic area located in Greater Napanee, Ontario, Canada, on the Adolphus Reach of the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario. Adolphustown is now part of the town of Greater Napanee. The rural character of the Adolphustown region remains largely undisturbed today and the area, with its picturesque lakefront location, remains popular for the cultivation of apples and strawberries.

==History==
Adolphustown was founded in 1784 by United Empire Loyalists. The original Loyalist Landing site is now the U.E.L. Heritage Centre &amp; Park, a museum, public park, and family campground.

The settlement was named for Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, seventh son of King George III. A number of Quakers settled in this area in 1784 and held their first Monthly Meetings in Canada here.

The Old Hay Bay Church, built by United Empire Loyalist settlers in 1792 and the oldest Methodist building in Canada, was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. It is open during the summer.

The settlement serves as the eastern terminus of the ferry crossing to Glenora, Ontario. The ferry is free for vehicles and pedestrians and links the western and eastern halves of one of the oldest colonial roads in the province, the Loyalist Parkway (Ontario Highway 33), at the point where the parkway is interrupted by the Bay of Quinte. This crossing appears to have been in use at least as early as 1802, when an extension of Asa Danforth Jr.&#x27;s pioneering road, from eastern Toronto through what is now Trenton, first reached the Bay of Quinte at Stone Mills (Glenora).

By 1869, Adolphustown was a station on the Grand Trunk Railway with a population of 100 in the Township of Adolphustown, County of Lennox and shore of Bay of Quinte. The principal trade was in grain stock and cordwood. Land averaged from $30 to $40 per acre.

Other development—such as the 1817 York Road, the 1856 Grand Trunk Railway, and 1964 segment of Highway 401—took a more northern route through Napanee-Belleville.

<text>A narrows or narrow (used interchangeably but usually in the plural form), is a restricted land or water passage. Most commonly a narrows is a strait, though it can also be a water gap.

A narrows may form where a stream passes through a tilted bed of hard rock lying between two softer beds: &quot;[i]f the hard beds are vertical, so that their outcrop does not shift as erosion proceeds, a narrows is developed&quot;. Like a dam, this &quot;raises the water level for a short distance upriver&quot;. A narrows is also typically a good location for trapping migrating fish. Furthermore, a narrows is &quot;an important topographical feature for wind mixing&quot;, an effect where a wind chill may form ice while the surrounding temperature remains above freezing.
