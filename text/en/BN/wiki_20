<text>Allo &#x27;Allo! is a British sitcom television series, created by David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd, starring Gorden Kaye, Carmen Silvera, Guy Siner and Richard Gibson. Originally broadcast on BBC1, the series focuses on the life of a French café owner in the town of Nouvion, during the German occupation of France in World War II, in which he deals with problems from a dishonest German officer, local French Resistance, the handling of a stolen painting and a pair of trapped British airmen, all while concealing from his wife the affairs he is having with his waitresses.

Croft and Lloyd devised the concept as a parody of BBC wartime drama &quot;Secret Army&quot; and initially launched the programme with a pilot on 30 December 1982. The sitcom was eventually commissioned following the success of the pilot and ran for nine series between 7 September 1984 until its conclusion on 14 December 1992. Both Lloyd and Croft wrote the scripts for the first six series, while the remainder were handled by Lloyd and Paul Adam. Much like previous sitcoms created by Croft and Lloyd, the programme employed notable elements such as memorable catchphrases and ending credits, cultural clichés, physical humour and visual gags. However, &quot;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; differed from these other sitcoms by featuring overarching plot lines rather than simple stand-alone stories, as well as the device of having actors speaking English but with theatrical foreign accents to distinguish each character&#x27;s nationality.

The sitcom gained strong ratings during its run, with its success leading to it receiving stage show reproductions. A special entitled &quot;The Return of &#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;, aired on 22 March 2007, featured cast members returning to reprise their original roles to perform in a special story after the conclusion of the programme. It was accompanied by a documentary about the sitcom, including a highlight reel of episodes and interviews with the cast, production team and fans.

==Premise==
&quot;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; is set during World War II, between the occupation of France by German Axis powers in 1940 and its eventual liberation by Allied forces in September 1944. The story of the sitcom focuses on René Artois, a café owner in Nouvion and a reluctant member of the town&#x27;s local French Resistance cell who operates under the codename of &quot;Nighthawk&quot;. Because of the occupation of the town by German forces, led by the dictatorial Major-General Erich von Klinkerhoffen, René finds himself caught up between dealing with four problems – the scheme and plots of the town&#x27;s corrupt commandant, Colonel Kurt von Strohm; the sabotage plans of the Resistance&#x27;s leader Michelle Dubois; the efforts by Gestapo agent Herr Otto Flick to find a stolen painting and unmask Resistance members; and the love affairs with his waitresses, particularly Yvette Carte-Blanche, each of which he must conceal from both his wife Edith Artois and each of the other waitresses.

Throughout the programme&#x27;s broadcast, the sitcom features a number of overarching storylines, with two of these being the most conspicuous. The first, and most prominent, concerns the theft of a valuable painting from the town&#x27;s chateau – &quot;The Fallen Madonna&quot; by fictional artist van Klomp (it is usually referred to as &quot;The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies&quot;) – stolen by von Strohm, and the subsequent efforts by him to conceal the theft from his superiors and Herr Flick. René is notably forced into handling the stolen painting under threat of execution, but also due to being indebted to von Strohm for allowing him to fake his death when he is sentenced to execution for unjustified accusations of aiding the Resistance in an act of sabotage. The painting itself is at one point lost during its concealment, and when found it is found a copy is forged. It is also sought not only by von Strohm but also Herr Flick who, rather than return it to Berlin, intends to keep it for himself.

The second storyline concerns the involvement of two stranded British airmen, shot down while over Nouvion. Because of their predicament, several plots in a number of episodes focus on the efforts of Michelle to devise plans that can help to send them back to England, with René not only forced to help hide them within his café or keep them under disguise, but also to help in her schemes, sometimes devised by London who relay these plans via a radio installed within the bedroom of Edith&#x27;s mother. The schemes devised are so bizarre and complicated that they backfire, and usually collide with other schemes concocted by both von Strohm and the Gestapo, invariably leaving all three groups worse off than before. Other storylines include the efforts to remove von Klinkerhoffen&#x27;s replacement from power, sabotaging the Germans&#x27; plan to invade England, and the subsequent build-up of German concern about an Allied invasion of France following the defeat of Italy.

===Lloyd and Croft sitcom elements===
As with previous sitcoms created before &quot;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;, such as Lloyd and Croft&#x27;s earlier collaboration &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, much of the humour is derived from classic elements of comedy including classic farce set-ups, physical comedy and visual gags, alongside a large amount of sexual innuendo, and a fast-paced running string of broad cultural clichés. Like most characters devised for previous sitcoms, the cast for the programme were designed with notable elements to distinguish them throughout the series, be it a catchphrase, gimmick, or saying.

Like previous sitcoms devised by the creators, &quot;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; ends each episode with the caption &quot;You have been watching (in order of appearance)&quot;, followed by a short vignette shot of actors who performed in the episode — whether as a main or supporting character — identified by their name in caption within each sequence. Although the shots appear like a clip from the episode, the production team conduct a separate filming session aimed as a reenactment of a scene the actor was involved in, mostly pertaining to a specific camera angle or action conducted by their character, with the vignette sequence often done in order of their first spoken line; because of Rene&#x27;s introductory monologues, actor Gorden Kaye is always first in the sequence, except for one episode of series 1 when Edith&#x27;s background singing caused Carmen Silvera to be credited first.

===&quot;René Recaps&quot; device===
As each episode builds on previous ones, viewers are often required to have followed the series to the episode they have reached in order to understand the plot. As &quot;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; revolved around individual story arcs spread across several episodes, the creators opted for using a comical version of the &quot;As you remember ...&quot; device, commonly used in serials, to act as a recap of events in the current story for the beginning of a new episode. This device within the sitcom was always conducted by René, who would open an episode by breaking the fourth wall (which Michael Bates did in &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;) to interact with the audience and provide a brief summary of events that had occurred previously, including notable events that had taken place, and also intermittently during episodes to make comic comments. This plot device was rare for comedy (including comedy animation), where plots are prominently gag-driven and self-contained, but its use in &quot;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; had a major impact on audiences connecting with the characters. It also had considerable benefits for re-runs, as it allowed local TV stations who had reshuffled episodes for their schedule to ensure that their audiences could be aware of the plot events surrounding the story of the episode being broadcast.

===&quot;Foreign&quot; languages===
The main characters of the series were of four nationalities — French, German, English and Italian. Lloyd and Croft portrayed this by having non-English characters speak English with the accent of the foreign language, while the English characters spoke in upper-class English accents. French, German and Italian characters could understand each other when speaking, but the English characters could not understand the others without someone &quot;translating&quot; for them and vice versa.

The police officer Crabtree was introduced in the second series. Because the character was an undercover Englishman with a poor grasp of French, the actor, Arthur Bostrom, spoke perfectly when the character spoke in English, but extensively deployed malapropisms to represent when the character was speaking in French. Bostrom altered certain words in his sentences, substituting different vowels or consonants, changing them into different or nonsensical words, usually laden with innuendo. An example is the line &quot;I was passing by the door, and I thought I would drop in,&quot; which Bostrom pronounced &quot;I was pissing by the door, and I thought I would drip in.&quot; Another example is Crabtree&#x27;s greeting of &quot;good morning,&quot; pronounced &quot;good moaning.&quot;

=== &quot;The Fallen Madonna&quot; ===
&quot;The Fallen Madonna&quot;, usually referred to as &quot;The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies&quot;, by the fictional painter van Klomp is a portrait of a bare-breasted woman, which provided a running gag in the show. The first episode of the first series of &quot;″Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; (1984), following the pilot, was titled &quot;The Fallen Madonna&quot;. In an earlier pilot, the painting was referred to as &quot;The Reclining Madonna&quot;.

There were sustained attempts by the occupiers to appropriate the &quot;Fallen Madonna&quot;, a local treasure, to provide a after the war. The painting was seen and hidden in various guises; it was often secreted, with suggestive possibilities, in a long &quot;knackwurst&quot; sausage. An incredible number of forgeries of the &quot;Fallen Madonna&quot; were made, mostly by Lieutenant Gruber and Monsieur Leclerc, which were hidden in &quot;knackwurst&quot; sausages in René&#x27;s kitchen. The forgeries were subsequently destroyed in various ways (burned, blown up, minced, eaten by a dog, etc.). In the end of the &quot;″Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; series the Fallen Madonna is found long after the war by an elderly René; he and his mistress Yvette quickly elope to Spain with the painting to live happily ever after.

Having previously sold for £4,000 in 2007, the original prop portrait from the series (&quot;The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies)&quot; sold for £15,000 at East Bristol Auctions in December 2018. The picture was purchased by a buyer in Nouvion. The BBC presented the 6th Marquess of Bath with a specially commissioned copy of the prop that was hung alongside Old Masters in Lord Bath&#x27;s ancestral home, Longleat.

=== Characters ===
==Episodes==


After the pilot aired in December 1982, a full-length first series of seven episodes was commissioned and aired from September 1984 onwards. Series two, three and four followed annually, with six episodes each.

Series five was commissioned with a view to syndicating the show in America. As a result, it aired as a single long series of twenty-six episodes between September 1988 and February 1989, with each episode running only twenty-five minutes to allow for commercials. The attempts to air the show in America failed (although screening rights to the series were later sold to PBS), and so series six had only eight episodes commissioned, which aired from September 1989 onwards.

On 25 January 1990, Gorden Kaye suffered serious head injuries in a car crash brought on by gale-force winds. This delayed the start of the seventh series, which consisted of ten episodes airing from January 1991 onwards. Series 8 (7 episodes) followed in January 1992, and the ninth and final series of six episodes aired later that year from November onwards.

Two Christmas specials were also made. The first was a 45-minute episode, which followed Series 2 in 1985, and the second was also a 45-minute episode, screened at Christmas 1991, preceding Series 8.

In 1994, two years after the series ended, the BBC broadcast &quot;The Best of &#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;, a compilation of clips from the series, linked by new scenes featuring Gorden Kaye and Carmen Silvera, in which René and Edith reminisce about the events of the war.

On 22 March 2007, a one-off special episode entitled &quot;The Return of &#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; was filmed in Manchester, and was broadcast on 28 April 2007 at 9 pm on BBC 2. The storyline involves René writing his memoirs after the war, and the events from the final episode in 1992 have been overlooked. The new scenes were interspersed with clips from the original series and new interviews. The actors who reprised their roles were: Gorden Kaye, Vicki Michelle, Sue Hodge, Kirsten Cooke, Arthur Bostrom, Guy Siner, Robin Parkinson, John D. Collins and Nicholas Frankau. In addition, Richard Gibson and Sam Kelly are interviewed, although they are not reprising their respective roles. The only main characters who did not appear in the reunion at all (barring those cases where the actor or actress had died) were Private Helga Geerhart (played by Kim Hartman) and Herr Engelbert von Smallhausen (played by John Louis Mansi). Jeremy Lloyd wrote the new material.

===&quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo! Forty Years of Laughter&quot;===
In 2022, Channel 5 aired a 67-minute special retrospective for their &quot;Comedy Classics&quot; series. Cast, crew and celebrities discuss and pay tribute to the show. The documentary features interviews with Guy Siner, Vicki Michelle and Kim Hartman, as well as a previously unseen archive interview with Gorden Kaye. The show is narrated by Stephen Mangan.

==German version==
On March 10, 2008, ProSieben Sat.1 Media bought the rights to broadcast the series for the first time in Germany, which the channel Sat.1 Comedy began on February 15, 2010. In the meantime, the series was also broadcast on German free TV on Comedy Central Germany .

== Cultural references ==

The show&#x27;s premise was not to make fun of the war but to spoof war-based film and TV dramas, and in particular the BBC1 drama &quot;Secret Army&quot;, which ran from 1977 to 1979 and dealt with the activities of a Belgian &quot;escape line&quot; that returned Allied pilots to Britain, working from a Brussels café and later restaurant. Many of the elements and characters are directly taken from &quot;Secret Army&quot;, such as the café owner having an affair in the restaurant under the nose of his wife, a bed-ridden woman in a room above who knocks on the floor for attention, a pianist who is also the forger, and the enmity between the Gestapo and the German military. Many storylines for &quot;″Allo &#x27;Allo&quot; also derive directly from episodes of &quot;Secret Army&quot;, such as the valuable paintings and the accompanying forgeries, which both the Germans and the Resistance are seeking to obtain in the &quot;Secret Army&quot; second series episode &quot;Weekend&quot;. Some actors from &quot;Secret Army&quot; also appear in &quot;″&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;: Richard Marner, Guy Siner, John D. Collins, Hilary Minster, David Beckett and Louis Sheldon. Inspiration was also drawn from patriotic black-and-white British melodramas of the 1940s.

The French village setting is reminiscent of 1972&#x27;s &quot;Clochemerle&quot;, whilst René&#x27;s intermediary role between the Germans and the Resistance reflects a comic version of Rick from &quot;Casablanca&quot; (as well as directly matching the proprietor of the café in &quot;Secret Army&quot;).

== Music ==
Having a café-cabaret in the plot, music was often performed on the show. This usually took place with Madame Edith singing, and either Lt. Gruber or Leclerc at the piano, played (out of vision) by Roy Moore. Occasionally, characters could also be seen whistling or humming tunes at certain points.

=== Theme tune ===
David Croft and Roy Moore composed the theme tune performed at the start and end of each episode. It features a French-style melody performed on an accordion, accompanied by a string quartet and other instruments, in the (waltz) time signature. The title is Allo &#x27;Allo&quot;, and the first lyrics are:

Carmen Silvera sang the full song and it was released on LP in the 1980s.

=== Other music ===
The café cabaret music usually took the form of 1930s film and show tunes – reminiscent of the way period songs were also used in &quot;Secret Army&quot;.

Most popular was &quot;Louise&quot; from the film &quot;Innocents of Paris&quot; (1929), which featured a number of times and was even sung in the &quot;broken-French&quot; language of Crabtree, who pronounced the title &quot;Loo-woes&quot;. Gruber sang a number such as &quot;Can&#x27;t Help Lovin&#x27; Dat Man&quot; from &quot;Show Boat&quot; or &quot;(I Got a Woman Crazy for Me) She&#x27;s Funny That Way&quot; by Neil Monet and Richard A. Whiting. He gazed at René in a slightly lustful manner, replacing lyrics such as &quot;woman&quot; and &quot;she&quot; with &quot;boy&quot; and &quot;he&quot;. He caused a particular sensation with his straight version of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Mad About the Boy&quot;.

Naturally the &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and the German national anthem &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot; featured from time to time, for example where several French peasants sang La Marsellaise to celebrate the expected bombing of the Germans, but the singers flawlessly and without hesitation switch to Das Lied der Deutschen when the Germans come past. Helga also sometimes stripped to a rather raunchy version (arranged by Roy Moore) of the latter tune.

Captain Bertorelli could be seen singing &quot;&#x27;O Sole Mio (It&#x27;s Now or Never)&quot;; and the British airmen in a prisoner of war camp could be seen singing &quot;Hitler Has Only Got One Ball&quot;.

In 1986, Gorden Kaye and Vicki Michelle released a version of the hit song &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non plus&quot;. The characters of Yvette and René could be heard talking and in a comic manner whilst the familiar musical &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... melody played in the background. The song got to number fifty-seven in the UK Singles Chart.

In 1985, Gorden Kaye and Carmen Silvera appeared in the Royal Variety Performance in character as René and Edith, and sang &quot;I Remember It Well&quot; from &quot;Gigi&quot;.

== Stage show ==
The show gave rise to a successful touring stage-show featuring most of the TV cast. This ran from 1986 to 1992, and included three London stage runs as well as international tours.

In January 1990, Gorden Kaye suffered serious head injuries in a car accident. As a result, his understudy, John Larson, played the part in a London Palladium production. Kaye had a dent in his forehead for the rest of his life from a piece of wood that smashed through the car window. He wanted to end the television show after his accident, but was persuaded by Jeremy Lloyd to continue. In Australia Gorden Kaye&#x27;s part was played by Australian comedian/impressionist Max Gillies (later, Gorden Kaye repaid the favour when he took over Max Gillies&#x27; role in another play in Australia, when Max Gillies was unable to take part).

The show was last performed for a summer season at Bournemouth&#x27;s Pier Theatre in 1996.

In 2007 Gorden Kaye, Sue Hodge and Guy Siner reprised their roles in a production of the stage show in Brisbane, Australia. They were joined by Steven Tandy as Colonel von Strohm and Jason Gann as Herr Flick.

A new touring show, based on the 1992 tour written by David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd, opened at the Gordon Craig Theatre in Stevenage, Hertfordshire on 29 August 2008 before going on a national tour the following year. Vicki Michelle reprised her role as Yvette Carte-Blanche. The cast also included Jeffrey Holland playing Rene Artois and his wife Judy Buxton playing Michelle Dubois. Other cast members included Robin Sebastian as Gruber, James Rossman as Herr Flick, Nell Jerram as Private Helga Geerhart and Claire Andreadis as Mimi Labonq.

The theatrical version is also frequently performed by amateur theatre companies in the UK and elsewhere.

A sequel stage show, &#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo 2 – The Camembert Caper, written by David Lovesy, David Pibworth and Steve Clark, adapted from the TV series and approved by the Croft and Lloyd estates was published by Concord Theatricals in September 2023. This is also available for theatre groups to perform worldwide.

== Locations ==

Exterior shooting took place in Norfolk, much of it at Lynford Hall.

Between 1982 and 1987, and from 1989 to 1992, all interior scenes were filmed in front of a studio audience at the BBC Television Centre studios in London. For the fifth series, recorded from December 1987 to August 1988, production moved to BBC Elstree Centre in Studio D. With hopes for a US syndication deal, the BBC planned to make 26 new episodes of the sitcom; hence, a bigger space was needed for the production. Even though the US syndication deal did not go ahead as planned, production remained at BBC Elstree Centre for the remainder of the fifth series. With more space available, the outside set of Café Rene became a semi-permanent structure in the former ATV Garage building.

==Home media==
=== Australian and New Zealand DVD releases ===
In Australia, Roadshow Entertainment, under licence from the BBC began releasing the series on DVD in 2006, on a semi-annual basis. To date, all series have been released on DVD; only &quot;The Return of &#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; TV special remains to be released.
=== UK DVD releases ===
Universal Playback, under licence from the BBC, began releasing the series on DVD in 2002. In the UK six boxed sets with series 1–9 have been released, as well as a complete boxed set.

The original UK releases have episode titles superimposed over the openings of the episodes (series 1–4). The 2013 re-release of the complete series boxed set omits the majority, but not all of these superimposed titles. The American releases have no on-screen episode titles, reflecting the way that the shows were originally transmitted.

=== North American DVD releases ===
In January 2004, BBC Worldwide began releasing the show itself on DVD in North America, distributed by Warner Bros., beginning with Series 1. The releases continued on a somewhat irregular basis (approximately twice-yearly).

* Note: &quot;The Best of &#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; is included as an extra on the series nine DVDs.

===Video game===
A video game adaptation named &quot;″Allo ″Allo! Cartoon Fun&quot; was released for the Amiga in 1993 by Alternative Software. It is a platform game where players control René.

<doc id="430172" wikidata="Q25105" url="?curid=430172" title="Ali al-Rida">
<text>Ali ibn Musa al-Rida (, 1 January 766 – 6 June 818), also known as Abū al-Ḥasan al-Thānī, was a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and the eighth imam in Twelver Shia Islam, succeeding his father, Musa al-Kazim. He is also part of the chain of mystical authority in Sunni Sufi orders. He was known for his piety and learning, and a number of works are attributed to him, including &quot;Al-Risala al-Dhahabia&quot;, &quot;Sahifa al-Rida&quot;, and &quot;Fiqh al-Rida&quot;. &quot;Uyun al-Akhbar al-Rida&quot; by Ibn Babawayh is a comprehensive collection that includes his religious debates and sayings, biographical details, and even the miracles which have occurred at his tomb. He is buried in Mashad, Iran, site of a large shrine.

Al-Rida was contemporary with the Abbasid caliphs Harun al-Rashid () and his sons, al-Amin () and al-Ma&#x27;mun (). In a sudden departure from the established anti-Shia policy of the Abbasids, possibly to mitigate the frequent Shia revolts, al-Mamun invited al-Rida to Marv in Khorasan, his de facto capital, and designated him as heir apparent, despite the reluctance of the al-Rida who accepted the offer on the condition that he would not interfere in governmental affairs. The appointment of the Ali al-Rida by the Abbasid al-Mamun immediately invoked strong opposition, particularly among the Abbasids, who revolted and installed Ibrahim al-Mubarak, a half-brother of Harun al-Rashid, as the anti-caliph in Baghdad. Realizing the severity of the Iraqi opposition, al-Mamun and his entourage left Khorasan for Baghdad, accompanied by al-Rida. The Imam, however, died mysteriously when the party reached Tus in September 818. His death followed shortly after the assassination of al-Fadl ibn Sahl, the Persian of al-Mamun, who was publicly seen as responsible for his pro-Shia policies. The caliph is often seen as responsible for both deaths, as he made concessions to the Arab party to smooth his return to Baghdad. Tus was later replaced with a new city, called Mashhad, which developed around the grave of al-Rida as the holiest site in Iran, to which millions of Shia Muslims flock annually for pilgrimage.
==Life==
===Birth and early life===

Ali was born in Medina in 765 (148 AH), 768 (151 AH), or 770 (153 AH). The first date is said to be based on a prediction ascribed to his grandfather, al-Sadiq, who died in that year, that the successor to his son al-Kazim would be born soon. There are some indications that Ali might have been born as late 159 AH. In any case, the date often given by Shia authorities is 11 Du al-Qa&#x27;da 148 AH. His father was al-Kazim, the seventh Twelver Shia Imam, who was a descendant of Ali and Fatima, cousin and daughter of the Islamic prophet, respectively. His mother was a freed slave, probably of Berber origin, whose name is recorded differently in various sources, perhaps Najma or Tuktam. It was reputedly Hamida Khatun, mother of al-Kazim, who chose Najma for him. Momen writes that Ali was thirty-five years old when his father died, whereas Donaldson holds that he was twenty or twenty-five at the time.

=== During Harun&#x27;s rule ===
Al-Rida lived with his father Musa al-Kazim in Medina until 179 AH. When Harun arrested Musa and transferred him to Iraq, he took care of Musa&#x27;s property and the affairs of the Shias as the attorney of his father. 
With the death of Musa al-Kazim in Baghdad prison in Rajab 183 AH., his son Ali al-Rida became his heir and successor, according to his father&#x27;s will.
According to Madelung, al-Kazim had appointed al-Rida as his executor and al-Rida also inherited his father&#x27;s property near Medina, excluding his brothers. According to Musa al-Kazim will, the custody of his children, wives and property was also entrusted to Ali al-Rida.
Ali spent the next ten years of his life - from 183 to 193 AH - in the reign of Harun.

=== Civil war (811–813) and unrest ===
The Abbasid caliph Harun died during the imamate of al-Rida and the empire was split between his two sons: the reigning caliph, al-Amin, who was born to an Arab mother, and al-Mamun, who was born of a Persian mother and was designated as the successor and the governor of the province of Khorasan in present-day Iran. In effect, according to Momen, al-Amin controlled Iraq and the west with his Arab , al-Fadl ibn Rabi, while al-Mamun controlled Iran and the east with his Persian , al-Fadl ibn Sahl. Al-Amin reportedly violated these arrangements by appointing his son as successor in place of Mamun, and soon a civil war ensued in which al-Amin was killed and Baghdad was occupied by al-Mamun&#x27;s general, who nevertheless remained in Marv in Kuharasan, apparently determined to make there his new capital. 
Al-Rida, who, according to a tradition narrated by Ibn Babawayh and al-Tabarsi, had informed one of his companions that Ma&#x27;mun would kill Amin, kept himself away from the conflicts between the two. The period of Amin&#x27;s caliphate is said to be the time of peace for al-Rida, during which he found the opportunity to fulfill his mission of spreading the Islamic teachings.

Al-Mamun claimed for himself the title of Imam al-Huda (), possibly to imply that he was best qualified for the caliphate. Notably, he faced costly revolts in Kufa and Arabia by Alids and Zaydis, who intensified their campaign against the Abbasids around 815, seizing the cities of Mecca, Medina, Wasit, and Basra. In particular, the Shia revolt by Abu&#x27;l-Saraya in 815 was difficult to suppress in Iraq, and compelled al-Hasan ibn Sahl, al-Mamun&#x27;s governor of Iraq, to deploy the troops of the Khorasani general Harthama.
Throughout the years, several of al-Rida&#x27;s brothers and his uncle Moḥammad ibn Ja&#x27;far participated in the Alid revolts in Iraq and Arabia, but al-Rida refused any involvement. In this period, al-Rida&#x27;s only involvement in politics might have been to mediate between the Abbasid government and his uncle Muḥammad ibn Ja&#x27;far, who had revolted in Mecca.

=== Appointment as heir apparent (817 CE) ===

Departing from the established anti-Shia policies of his predecessors, al-Mamun invited al-Rida to Khorasan in 816, and designated him as successor in 817. According to Madelung, al-Mamun wrote to al-Rida in 200 AH (815-816), invited him to come to Marv, and also sent Raja ibn Abi&#x27;l Zahhak, cousin of his , and a eunuch to accompany al-Rida on this trip. In the same year, al-Rida might have also made the pilgrimage to Mecca with his five-year-old son Moḥammad al-Jawad. After some initial resistance, al-Rida set out for Marv in 816. According to a narration that some ancient sources have confirmed, Ma&#x27;mun had ordered that the Imam not be taken via Kufa and Qum, as he was worried that the feelings of the Shias of these cities in their friendship with the Imam would create problems for him (Ma&#x27;mun).
Though he did not pass through Qum on his way to Marv, he stayed for some time in Nishapur, where prominent Sunni traditionists visited him, including Ibn Rahuya, Yahya ibn Yahya, Moḥammad ibn Rafe&#x27;, and Ahmad ibn Ḥarb. Al-Rida continued on to Marv after receiving a new summons from al-Mamun.
A number of Sunni hadith scholars also asked al-Rida to narrate a hadith for them that has become known as the Hadith of Golden Chain.

In Marv, al-Mamun first offered al-Rida the caliphate, though this was turned down by the latter. According to Madelung, al-Rida resisted al-Mamun&#x27;s proposals for about two months until he reluctantly consented to an appointment as heir to the caliphate. The sources seem to agree that al-Rida was reluctant to accept this nomination, ceding only to the insistence of the caliph, with the condition that he would not interfere in governmental affairs or the appointment or dismissal of government agents. On 2 Ramadan 201 (23 March 817) by one account, the dignitaries and army leaders in Marv pledged their allegiance to the new heir apparent, who was dressed in green. An official announcement was made in the mosques throughout the empire, coins were minted to commemorate the occasion, and al-Mamun also changed the color of uniforms, official dress, and flags from black, the official Abbasid color, to green. This move possibly signified the reconciliation between the Abbasids and the Alids. To strengthen their relations, al-Mamun also married his daughter to al-Rida and promised another daughter to al-Rida&#x27;s son in Medina, a minor at the time.

==== Motives ====
The motivations of al-Mamun for this appointment are not fully understood. At the time, he justified his decision by maintaining that al-Rida was the most suitable person for the caliphate. The reluctance of al-Rida in accepting this designation, however, might reflect his suspicion that al-Mamun had ulterior motives. With an age gap of more than twenty years, it also seems unlikely that al-Rida would ever have succeeded the much younger al-Mamun. With this appointment, some have suggested that al-Mamun hoped for the support of the Shia and respite from their numerous revolts. Others have suggested that al-Mamun was influenced by his powerful Persian , af-Fadl ibn Sahl, who had Shia tendencies. Madelung, however, finds it more likely that the initiative to appoint al-Rida belonged to al-Mamun and not his . Some authors have not found the appointment surprising, noting the strained or severed relations of the caliph with his Abbasid relatives. Yet others have written that al-Mamun wanted a merit-based caliphate, though he made no mention of rules governing the succession to al-Rida during the ceremony. It has been suggested that al-Mamun might have wanted to heal the Sunni-Shia division, while Lapidus and others hold that al-Mamun wanted to expand his authority by adopting the Shia views about the divine authority of religious leaders, alongside his later religious inquisition (). Bayhom-Daou considers it likely that al-Mamun saw this appointment as a means of discrediting the Shia doctrine of Imamate, and Tabatabai writes that al-Mamun might have also hoped to undermine the position of al-Rida as a Shia religious leader by engaging him in politics.

Al-Rida&#x27;s rejection of al-Mamun&#x27;s initial offer for replacing him as the caliph has been used to argue that al-Rida&#x27;s ultimate aim was not temporal and political power. Rather, Mavani suggests that such power was merely a means for the Imam to reach the ultimate goal of guiding the community to salvation. When al-Rida was asked why he accepted the successorship, he is reported to have emphasized his unwillingness, responding, &quot;The same thing which forced my grandfather the Commander of the Faithful [Ali ibn Abi Talib] to join the arbitration council [i.e., coercion].&quot; To show his dissatisfaction with the trip to Khorasan, as reported by Ibn Babuyyah, al-Rida not only refused to take his family with him, but also asked them to cry loudly for him, saying that he would never return to his family&#x27;s embrace.
It also appears that this appointment did not alienate any of the followers of al-Rida which, according to Bayhom-Daou, might imply that they were convinced that he was a reluctant player who had no choice but to accept his designation as the heir apparent.

==== Reactions ====
Perhaps incorrectly, the appointment of al-Rida was at the time largely attributed to the influence of al-Mamun&#x27;s Persian , al-Fadl ibn Sahl. Nevertheless, various Abbasid governors, with the exception of Ismail ibn Jafar in Basra, loyally carried out their orders and exacted the oath of allegiance to the new heir. The appointment of the Alid al-Rida by the Abbasid al-Mamun apparently brought him the support of several notable Alids and nearly all the Zaydite partisans. It also immediately invoked strong opposition, particularly among the Abbasids and Arab Sunni nationalists. Al-Mamun&#x27;s decision did not carry the public opinion of the Iraqis, who declared him deposed and installed Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi, another Abbasid, as caliph in 817, while the popular militia roamed through Baghdad, demanding a return to the Quran and the Sunna. Ibrahim, a half-brother of al-Mamun&#x27;s father, is said to have been a weak statesman and a mere figurehead, whose rule was largely confined to Baghdad. There were also military engagements in Baghdad, Kufa, and Wasit between al-Mamun&#x27;s forces and the supporters of Ibrahim who were themselves much harassed by financial and logistical difficulties.

=== Tenure as heir apparent (817-818 CE) ===
Al-Rida was given a high status at the court of al-Mamun. While the caliph evidently desired that al-Rida should immediately engage in all official ceremonies, the latter is reported to have refrained, stipulating that he would not participate in government affairs. Al-Rida was given his own police force and guard, as well as a chamberlain and a secretary. The caliph is said to have relied on the judgment of al-Rida in religious questions and arranged for debates between him and scholars of Islam and other faiths. According to Rizvi, however, these religious disputations seem to have been designed as set pieces to embarrass al-Rida. Their accounts were later recorded by Ibn Babuwayh in his &quot;Uyun akhbar al-Rida.&quot;

=== Return to Baghdad (818 CE) ===
The seriousness of the civil unrest in Iraq was apparently kept hidden from al-Mamun by his until 818, and it was al-Rida who urged the caliph to return to Baghdad and restore peace. Al-Rida&#x27;s assessment was supported by several army chiefs and al-Mamun thus left Khorasan in 818. Before their return, his offered his resignation, pointing out the hatred of the Abbasids in Baghdad for him personally, and requested the caliph to leave him as governor in Khorasan. Al-Mamun instead assured the of his unrestricted support and published a letter to this effect throughout the empire. However, six months later in Sha&#x27;ban 202 (February 818), the was assassinated in Sarakhs by several army officers as he accompanied al-Mamun back to Baghdad. Those responsible were soon executed, but not before declaring that they had been acting on the orders of the caliph. Henceforth, al-Mamun governed with the help of counsellors on whom he did not confer the title of .

== Death and burial ==

Al-Rida died in Tus (present-day Mashhad) on the last day of Safar 203 (September 818), probably poisoned. Other given dates range from Safar 202 (September 817) to Dhu al-Qa&#x27;da 203 (May 819). The sources seem to agree that al-Rida died after a short illness as he accompanied al-Mamun and his entourage back to Baghdad. His death followed shortly after the assassination of al-Fadl ibn Sahl, the Persian of al-Mamun, who had become a divisive figure. Both deaths are attributed in Shia sources to al-Mamun as he made concessions to the Arab party to smooth his return to Iraq. Madelung writes that the sudden deaths of the and the heir apparent, whose presence would have made any reconciliation with the powerful Abbasid opposition in Baghdad virtually impossible, strongly suggest that al-Mamun was responsible for them. This opinion is echoed by Kennedy and Bobrick, and Bayhom-Daou considers this the prevalent view among Western historians. Similarly, Rizvi writes that the sudden reversal of al-Mamun&#x27;s pro-Shia policies and his attempt to eradicate the memory of al-Rida might support the accusations against the caliph. In contrast, the Sunni historians al-Tabari and al-Masudi, who both lived under the Abbasids, do not consider the possibility of murder. In particular, al-Masudi writes that al-Rida died as a result of consuming too many grapes. Alternatively, the Shia scholar Muhammad Husayn Tabataba&#x27;i believed that al-Mamun poisoned al-Rida given the growing popularity of the latter and the immediate proliferation of the Shia teachings. Some Sunni authors seem to have also adopted the Shia practice of referring to al-Rida&#x27;s death as martyrdom.

The caliph then asked a group of Alids to examine the body of al-Rida and testify that he had died of natural causes. At the funeral, al-Mamun recited the last prayers himself. The reports note his display of grief during the funeral. Madelung does not view these emotions as necessarily insincere, noting that on other occasions in the reign of al-Mamun, cold political calculation appears to have outweighed the personal sentiments and ideals. A year later, in Safar 204 (August 819), the caliph entered Baghdad without a fight. The anti-caliph, Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi, had already fled from the city several weeks earlier. The return to Baghdad marked the end of the pro-Shia policies of al-Mamun, and was followed by the return to the traditional black color of the Abbasids.

=== Shrine ===

Al-Mamun buried al-Rida in Tus next to his father, Harun al-Rashid. Tus was later replaced with a new city, called Mashhad (), developed around the grave of al-Rida as the holiest site in Iran for the Shia. The present shrine dates to the fourteenth century, when the Il-khan Öljaitü converted to Twelver Shi&#x27;ism. Most of the elaborate decorative work in the present imposing complex dates from Safavid and Qajar periods. Adjacent to the shrine is the Goharshad Mosque, one of the finest in Iran, named after the wife of the Timurid emperor Shah Rukh and completed in 1394 CE. Several theological colleges have been built around the shrine, the most famous of which is that of Mirza Ja&#x27;far Khan.

=== Rituals ===
The traditional ritual of Khutbeh Khani () is held annually on the night of al-Rida&#x27;s death. The ritual, dating back to governor Ali Shah of Khorasan in 1160 AH, involves the servants of the holy site walking from the nearest street to Inqilab yard with candles in their hands. There, they stand around the yard and the crowd recites religious sermons and praise God. This ritual is also repeated on the night of Ashura.

==Imamate==
The imamate of al-Rida overlapped with the reigns of the Abbasid Harun al-Rashid and his sons, al-Amin and al-Mamun. He initially adopted a quiescent attitude and kept aloof from politics, similar to his predecessors, namely, the fourth through seventh Shia Imams; 
and he refused to officially approve and accompany the uprisings of the Alids. Therefore, the Zaydis, who followed the method of armed struggle, were against him. According to al-Rida, armed conflict is not the best way to fight when there are rulers who do not tolerate any kind of Enjoining good and forbidding wrong. Based on this, al-Rida did not accept Muhammad bin Suleiman request to unite and accompany him. Also, it has been said that in a meeting with his uncle, Muhammad ibn Ja&#x27;far, the Imam warned him against opposing the way of his father and brother (Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq and Musa al-Kazim) and warned him that his rebellion would be unsuccessful. The Imam even quarreled with his brother, Zayd ibn Musa al-Kazim, and left him. Nevertheless, al-Rida called the current situation in his time as the rule of a false government and the system of oppressors. By explaining the concept of &quot;Ulu&#x27;l-amr&quot; and the necessity of obeying them, he emphasized on following the Ahl al-Bayt and he considered the leadership of oppressors and obeying them to be invalid and wrong. Among the companions of al-Rida, there were those who, while appearing to accompany the government, had relations with the Imam and protected and supported the Shias from harm and oppression.

Al-Rida, known for his piety and learning, issued s (legal rulings) at The Prophet&#x27;s Mosque in Medina when he was still in his twenties and narrated hadith from his forefathers. 
===Designation===
Al-Kazim designated his son, Ali al-Rida, as his successor before his death in Harun al-Rashid&#x27;s prison in 799 (183 AH), following some years of imprisonment. Madelung adds that al-Kazim had made al-Rida his legatee, and that al-Rida also inherited his father&#x27;s estate near Medina to the exclusion of his brothers. After al-Kazim, al-Rida was thus acknowledged as the next Imam by a significant group of al-Kazim&#x27;s followers, who formed the main line of Shia and went on to become the Twelvers. The brothers of al-Rida did not claim the imamate but a number of them revolted against the Abbasids. Some of the followers of al-Kazim, however, claimed that he had not died and would return as Mahdi, the promised savior in Islam. These became known as the Waqifiyya () though it appears that they later returned to the mainstream Shia, declaring al-Rida and his successors as the lieutenants of al-Kazim. These also included the Bushariyya, named after Muhammad ibn Bashir, the gnostic from Kufa, who claimed to be the interim imam in the absence of al-Kazim. 

During his Imamate, al-Rida fought fiercely against the leaders of the Waqifiyya, calling them enemies of the truth, wanderers, heretics, infidels, and polytheists. In one case, he compared the Waqifiyya with the Jews and stated that verse 64 of Surah Al-Ma&#x27;idah was revealed about the Waqifiyya because they, like the Jews, doubted the continuity of the Imamate because no child had yet been born to the Imam and attributed impotence to God. The term Waqifiyya is applied generally to any group who denies or hesitates over the death of a particular Shia Imam and refuses to recognize his successors.
According to Kohlberg, the creation of Waqifiyya might have had a financial reason. Some of the representatives of al-Kazim evidently refused to hand over to al-Rida the monies entrusted to them, arguing that al-Kazim was the last Imam. These included Mansur ibn Yunus Buzurg and Ali ibn Abi Ḥamza al-Bataini, Ziyad ibn Marwan al-Kandi, Uthman ibn Isa al-Amiri al-Ruasi (Ruwasi). Some reports indicate that al-Ruasi repented.

=== Succession ===
Muhammad, the only child of al-Rida, was seven years old when his father died. The succession of the young Muhammad, who later became known as al-Jawad (), became controversial among the followers of his father. A group of them instead accepted the imamate of al-Rida&#x27;s brother, Ahmad ibn Musa. Another group joined the Waqifiyya, who considered al-Kazim to be the last Imam and expected his return as Mahdi. Some had opportunistically backed the imamate of al-Rida after his appointment as successor to the caliphate and now returned to their Sunni or Zaydi communities. Tabatabai, however, regards the divisions in Shia after al-Rida as insignificant and often temporary. Twelver scholars have noted that Jesus received his prophetic mission in the Quran when he was still a child, and some hold that al-Jawad had received the requisite perfect knowledge of all religious matters through divine inspiration from the time of his succession, irrespective of his age.
Often viewed as evidence of his divine favor, various nonprophetic miracles (, ) have been attributed to al-Rida. During his stay in Nishapur, it is said that the Imam planted an almond in the house where he stayed, which grew into a tree and bore fruit the next year. Also, in the Imam&#x27;s residence, there was a ruined bathhouse and a barren qanat, but when the Imam arrived, the water in that qanat flowed again, and the people rebuilt that bathhouse, and it was named after the Imam, and people sought blessings from that tree and this bathhouse.
After leaving Nishapur, Reza reached a village named Sanabad and went to the palace of Humayd ibn Qahtaba and entered the courtyard where Harun al-Rashid&#x27;s grave was located. According to Ibn Babawayh, al-Rida drew a line next to that grave and said, &quot;This will be my tomb.&quot;
As related by Ibn Babuwayh, at the beginning of al-Rida&#x27;s presence in Khorasan, it did not rain much. Al-Mamun asked al-Rida to pray for rain. He accepted and appointed Monday for this work. In the morning al-Rida went to the desert with the people and went to the pulpit and asked God for rain. After that, clouds appeared in the sky and when people returned to their homes, it started raining heavily. A large crowd gathered around al-Rida and people congratulated him on this honor.
Donaldson includes the account of Reyyan ibn Salt who, when bidding farewell to his Imam, was so overcome with grief that he forgot to ask al-Rida for one of his shirts, to use as a shroud, and some coins, to make rings for his daughters. As Reyyan was leaving, however, al-Rida called to him, &quot;Do you not want one of my shirts to keep as your shroud? And would you not like some pieces of money for rings for your daughters?&quot; Reyyan left after al-Rida fulfilled his wishes.

Ibn Hibban a hadith scholar, writes in his work, Al-Thiqat, that he would frequently visit Imam Reza shrine and by praying over the grave of the Imam, the problems or difficulties he was facing would be resolved, and he had experienced this many times. Al-Hakim al-Nishapuri quoted Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Sahl, a jurist known as Masarjisi (d. 384), as saying that no problem in religious or worldly matters arose for me unless I sought out the grave of Ali ibn Musa and prayed there, and that problem and need were resolved.

== Titles and family ==
The title al-Rida () was reputedly bestowed upon him by the caliph, in a reference to a descendant of Muhammad upon whom Muslims would agree for the caliphate (), a rallying cry of the Shia and, earlier, of Abbasids against the Umayyads.
Muhammad al-Jawad, according to Ibn Babawiyah, stated that God called him Rida because his enemies and his friends were pleased with him, while this did not happen to any of his fathers. Al-Rida is also known as Abu al-Hasan al-Thani () to distinguish him from his father, Musa al-Kazim, who is also known as Abu al-Hasan al-Awwal ().
In a move to strengthen their ties, al-Mamun had married his daughter, Umm Habib, to al-Rida, though no children resulted from that marriage. Muhammad, who later became known as al-Jawad, was the child of al-Rida, born to Sabika (or Khayzuran), a freed slave () from Nubia, who was said to have descended from the family of Maria al-Qibtiyya, a freed slave of the prophet and mother of his son Ebrahim, who died in childhood. There is a disagreement as to the number of children Ali al-Rida had. Some have reported them as five sons and one daughter with the names of Muhammad, Hasan, Ja&#x27;far, Ibrahim, Husayn and A&#x27;isha. According to Ibn Hazm al-Rida had three sons named Ali, Muhammad, and Hussein, whose lineage continued through Muhammad. While others mentioned the existence of a daughter of Ali al-Rida called Fatima.
Hadiths of al-Rida and Muhammad al-Jawad indicate that al-Rida had only one son namely Muhammad al-Jawad and the al-Rida&#x27;s lineage continued through him.
== Views ==
In addition to Shia authorities, Sunni biographical sources also list al-Rida as one of the narrators of prophetic hadiths, and al-Waqidi considers him a reliable transmitter. As a Shia Imam who rejected the authority of Muhammad&#x27;s companions as hadith transmitters, initially only the Shia transmitted hadith on the authority of al-Rida. In his later years, however, notable Sunni traditionists were said to have visited him, including Ibn Rahwayh and Yahya ibn Yahya. In particular, his appointment as the heir apparent seemed to have added to the credibility to al-Rida in Sunni circles, who at the time apparently came to regard him as a distinguished transmitter by virtue of his learning and descent from the prophet. In view of his continued veneration as a Shia Imam, later Sunni authors were divided about the authority of al-Rida, some saying that he was not always a reliable transmitter and others instead questioning the authority of those who transmitted from al-Rida. They all seem to refer to him as a man of piety and learning.

It has been commonly held that Ma&#x27;ruf al-Karkhi, who converted to Islam at the hands of al-Rida, is a prominent figure in the golden chain of most Sufi orders. He is said to have been a devoted student of al-Rida, though Bayhom-Daou regards the accounts of their encounters as apocryphal. In Sufi tradition, al-Rida is regarded as a model of asceticism, and the chains of authority in Shia Sufi orders progress through al-Rida, followed by al-Karkhi. One such instance is the Ni&#x27;mat Allahi order.

Among the poets who wrote poems in praise of al-Rida were Abu Nuwas and Di&#x27;bil ibn &#x27;Ali al-Khuza&#x27;i, both Shia poets.Two famous Persian poets Sanai and Khaqani have also written poems about the desire to visit the al-Rida&#x27;s shrine. Sanai expressed his deep feelings and belief in al-Rida in a famous and long poem, in which he compared the al-Rida&#x27;s shrine to the Kaaba in terms of crowding. For Khaqani Khorasan was the Qibla of religion and spirituality.

==Works==
&quot;Al-Risala al-Dhahabia&quot; () is a treatise on medical cures and the maintenance of good health which was reputedly commissioned by al-Mamun, who requested it in gold ink, hence the name. The studies by Speziale (2004) and Speziale - Giurini (2009) have critically analysed the issue of the authorship of the text. The book was text edited in Bombay and included by Majlesi in his &quot;Bihar al-Anwar&quot;. A number of commentaries have been written to it and it has been translated into Persian and Urdu. Despite questions concerning its authenticity, the book remains popular among the Twelver Shia.

&quot;Sahifa al-Rida&quot; is a collection of 240 hadiths, mentioned in some early Twelver sources and ascribed to al-Rida. &quot;Fiqh al-Rida,&quot; also called &quot;al-Fiqh al-Radawi&quot;, is a treatise on jurisprudence () attributed to al-Rida. It was not known till the tenth century (sixteenth CE century) when it was judged to be authentic by Majlesi but later Twelver scholars have doubted its authenticity, including S.H. Sadr. Other works attributed to al-Rida are listed in &quot;A&#x27;yan al-Shia&quot;. Additionally, Shia sources contain detailed descriptions of his religious debates, sayings, and poetry. &quot;Uyun al-Akhbar al-Rida&quot; by Ibn Babawayh is a comprehensive collection that includes the religious debates, sayings, biographical details, and even the miracles which have occurred at his tomb.

== Debates ==
Al-Mamun showed interest in theological questions and organized debates between the scholars of different sects and religions in which al-Rida participated. One of these debates was about Divine Unity, led by Sulaiman al-Mervi, a scholar from Khorasan. Another discussion with Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Jahm was devoted to the infallibility of the prophets, which led to another session on the same subject when al-Mamun took part in the debate himself. Many of these debates are recorded in the collections of Shia hadiths, such as &quot;Uyun Akhbar al-Rida&quot;.&quot;&quot; The following is an excerpt from a debate between al-Rida and an unbeliever ().

* Al-Rida said to a , &quot;Dost thou see that if the correct view is your view then are we not equal? All that we have prayed, fasted, given the alms and declared our convictions will not harm us. If the correct view is our view then have not you perished and we gained salvation?&quot;
* The man said, &quot;Then let me know, how is He and where is He?&quot; Al-Rida answered, &quot;Surely the opinion thou hast adopted is mistaken. He determined the &#x27;where&#x27;, and He was, when there was no &#x27;where&#x27;; and He fashioned the &#x27;how&#x27;, and He was, when there was no &#x27;how&#x27;. So He is not known through &#x27;howness&#x27; or &#x27;whereness.&#x27;&quot;
* The man said, &quot;So then surely He is nothing if He cannot be perceived by any of the senses.&quot; Al-Rida responded, &quot;When our senses fail to perceive Him, we know for certain that He is our Lord and that He is something different from other things ().&quot;
* The man said, &quot;Then tell me, when was He?&quot; Al-Rida said, &quot;Tell when He was not, and then I will tell you when He was.&quot; 
* The man said, &quot;Then what is the proof of Him?&quot; Al-Rida responded, &quot;Surely when I contemplate my body and it is impossible for me to increase or decrease its breadth and height, or to keep unpleasant things away from it or draw benefits to it, then I know that this structure has a maker and I acknowledge Him-even though that which I had seen of the rotation of the celestial sphere through His power; the producing of clouds; the turning about of the winds; the procession of the sun, the moon and the stars; and others of His wondrous and perfectly created signs (), had (already) made me know that (all) this has a Determiner () and Producer ().&quot;
* The man said, &quot;Then why has He veiled Himself (from men)?&quot; Al-Rida replied, &quot;Surely the veil is upon creatures because of the abundance of their sins. As for Him, no secret is hidden from Him during the day or the night.&quot; The debate continued and this episode ended with the professing Islam.

== Character ==
Al-Rida is represented in historical sources as a thoughtful and likable man.
He was of medium height, according to Ibn Sabbagh, and his skin color was dark or wheatish. He ate slowly and little and used to wear cheap and rough clothes, but when he met people, he wore luxurious clothes.
When he laughed, he did not giggle and smiled. He used to sit and eat with his slaves. He did not make his guests to work for him and tried to respect them in the best possible way. Byzanti relates that when he visited al-Rida for a few hours, al-Rida invited him to stay for the night and spread his own bed for Byzanti. Muhammad ibn Ghaffar narrates that when he visited al-Rida to ask for financial help, al-Rida fulfilled his wish before he mentioned his need and then invited Muhammad to stay overnight as his guest.
When he was in Khorasan, he distributed all his wealth among the people on the Day of Arafat.

== Selected quotes ==

* &quot;The sincere friend of every man is his intelligence, while his enemy is his ignorance.&quot;
* &quot;Worship is not abundant prayer and fasting; rather it is abundant reflecting on the affair of Allah, the Great and Almighty.&quot;
* &quot;Man is not worshipful unless he is clement.&quot;
* &quot;Faith is a degree above Islam; fear of Allah is a degree above faith; and nothing less than fear of Allah has been divided among men.&quot;
* &quot;Faith is four pillars: trust in Allah, satisfaction with Allah&#x27;s decree, submission to Allah&#x27;s command, and entrusting (affairs) to Allah.&quot;
* &quot;If one lacks five attributes, do not expect to gain anything good out of him for your life in this world or your life to come: if his lineage is known to be untrustworthy, if his nature lacks generosity, if his temper lacks balance, if he lacks a noble conduct, and if he lacks fear of his Lord.&quot;
* &quot;If only three years of a person&#x27;s span of life has remained and he tightens the bond of kin, Allah will make them thirty years, and Allah does whatever He wills.&quot;
* &quot;Adhere to the weapon of the prophets!&quot; They asked, &quot;What is the weapon of prophets?&quot; He replied, &quot;Supplication.&quot;
* &quot;A believer&#x27;s secret supplication is equal to seventy open supplications.&quot;
* &quot;Imamate is compulsory for religion and it is a system for Muslims. It is cause of benefit in this world and dignity for Believers.&quot;

<doc id="430176" wikidata="Q862831" url="?curid=430176" title="Passer rating">
<text>Passer rating (also known as passing efficiency in college football) is a measure of the performance of passers, primarily quarterbacks, in gridiron football. There are two formulas currently in use: one used by both the National Football League (NFL) and Canadian Football League (CFL), and the other used in NCAA football. Passer rating is calculated using a player&#x27;s passing attempts, completions, yards, touchdowns, and interceptions. Passer rating in the NFL is on a scale from 0 to 158.3. Passing efficiency in college football is on a scale from −731.6 to 1261.6.

Since 1973, passer rating has been the official formula used by the NFL to determine its passing leader.

Passer rating is sometimes colloquially referred to as &quot;quarterback rating&quot; or &quot;QB rating&quot;; however, the statistic applies only to passing (not to other contributions by a quarterback) and applies to any player at any position who throws a forward pass, not just to quarterbacks. Other measurements, such as ESPN&#x27;s total quarterback rating and Pro Football Focus grades have been produced to take account for non-passing contributions or mistakes made by passers.

==History==

Before the development of the passer rating, the NFL struggled with how to crown a passing leader.

From 1932 to 1937, it was the quarterback with the most passing yardage, and from 1938 to 1940, it was the quarterback with the highest completion percentage. In 1941, a system was created that ranked the league&#x27;s quarterbacks relative to their peers&#x27; performance. Over the next thirty years, the criteria used to crown a passing leader changed several times, however, the ranking system made it impossible to determine a quarterback&#x27;s rank until all quarterbacks had completed their games that week, or to compare quarterback performances across multiple seasons.

With this in mind, in 1971, NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle asked the league&#x27;s statistical committee to develop a better system: this committee was headed by Don Smith of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Seymour Siwoff of the Elias Sports Bureau, and NFL executive Don Weiss. Smith and Siwoff established passing performance standards based on data from all qualified pro football passers between 1960 and 1970, and used those data to create the passer rating, with the formula being adopted by the NFL in 1973.

==NFL and CFL formula==

The NFL passer rating formula includes five variables: pass attempts, completions, passing yards, touchdown passes, and interceptions. Each of those variables is scaled to a value between 0 and 2.375, with 1.0 being statistically average (based on league data between 1960 and 1970). When the formula was first created, a 66.7 rating indicated an average performance, and a 100+ rating indicated an excellent performance. However, passing performance has improved steadily since then and in 2017 the league average rating was 88.6, and by 2020 it was 93.6.

The four separate calculations can be expressed in the following equations:

formula_1

formula_2

formula_3

formula_4

where
: ATT = Number of passing attempts
: CMP = Number of completions
: YDS = Passing yards
: TD = Touchdown passes
: INT = Interceptions

If the result of any calculation is greater than 2.375, it is set to 2.375. If the result is a negative number, it is set to zero.

Then, the above calculations are used to complete the passer rating:

formula_5

==NCAA formula==
The NCAA passing efficiency formula is similar to that of the NFL passer rating, but does not impose limits on the four components. The formula is based on college football data between 1965 and 1978, and when the formula was first created, a 100 passer efficiency indicated an average performance.

The passing efficiency formula is:

formula_6

where
: ATT = Number of passing attempts
: CMP = Number of completions
: YDS = Passing yards
: TDP = Touchdown passes
: INT = Interceptions

The NCAA passer efficiency has an upper limit of 1,261.6 (every attempt is a 99-yard completion for a touchdown), and a lower limit of −731.6 (every attempt is completed, but results in a 99-yard loss). A passer who throws only interceptions will have a −200 efficiency, as would a passer who only throws completed passes losing an average of 35.714 yards.

==Advantages==

In 2011, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; published an article by Kerry Byrne of &quot;Cold Hard Football Facts&quot; highlighting the importance of passer rating in determining a team&#x27;s success. &quot;Put most simply,&quot; the article states, &quot;you cannot be a smart football analyst and dismiss passer rating. In fact, it&#x27;s impossible to look at the incredible correlation of victory to passer rating and then dismiss it. You might as well dismiss the score of a game when determining a winner. [...] Few, if any, are more indicative of wins and losses than passer rating. Teams that posted a higher passer rating went 203–53 (.793) in 2010 and an incredible 151–29 (.839) after Week 5.&quot; Byrne made an expanded defense of the passer rating and its importance for the Pro Football Researchers Association in 2012. The study showed that all of the eight teams since 1940 that led the league in both offensive passer rating and defensive passer rating won championships.

== Flaws ==
The passer rating equation does not take into account sacks, fumbles, or a quarterback&#x27;s rushing production, although by definition it only measures passing statistics. 

Due to rule changes and improvement in quarterback play, the league-wide passer rating has increased by an average of 0.63 points per season since its introduction in 1973, from 61.7 that year to 93.6 in 2020, which makes passer rating a poor statistic for comparing quarterbacks from different seasons or eras.

== Other measurements ==

=== Total quarterback rating ===

ESPN&#x27;s total quarterback rating is a proprietary statistic that was introduced in 2011 and is designed to measure the total effectiveness and performance of a quarterback. The metric takes into account all of a quarterback&#x27;s contribution to a game, including passing, rushing, sacks, penalties, touchdowns, and turnovers. Moreover, each play is weighted based on its &quot;difficulty&quot;, the context of the game, and the strength of the opposing defense. This means that statistics in garbage time of a blowout game hold less merit than statistics in a close game. Also, a quarterback who throws for four touchdowns and 300 yards against a strong defense will have a higher QBR than a quarterback who has the same stat line against the worst defense in the NFL.

QBR functions on a 0–100 scale, where an average NFL quarterback typically has around a 50 QBR, while a Pro Bowl caliber quarterback will have approximately a 75. This scale also represents a percentile of overall quarterback performances since 2006. This means that if a quarterback has a QBR of 90 their performance in that game is, on average, better than 90% of other quarterback performances.

It is also very common for there to be significant differences between QBR and passer rating leaders due to the additional variables and situational play context that contribute to the calculation of QBR. For example, in 2019, Lamar Jackson had a league leading QBR of 83.0 and earned MVP honors. However, in terms of passer rating, Jackson (113.3) finished behind Ryan Tannehill (117.5) and Drew Brees (116.3), who finished ninth and third in QBR, respectively.

=== PFF Player Grades ===
Pro Football Focus (PFF) is a football website that conducts in-depth analysis on NFL and NCAA games and players. Part of this analysis involves assigning each player in the NFL, as well as the Power Four at the collegiate level, a grade that indicates their performance.

According to PFF, the group&#x27;s algorithm analyzes every play for each individual player and measures the impact that said player has while on the field. A player&#x27;s impact is then given a grade between −2 and +2 in 0.5 increments. Each position has a scale with a unique algorithm and rules. The scale also takes into account game context, so a strong play in the fourth quarter of a close matchup will be graded higher than one in the 2nd quarter of a blowout game.

A 0 player grade on any given play represents any position player performing at an expected level and in a manner that neither positively nor negatively impacts their team. An example of this is a running back taking a carry through the correct hole and picking up three to four yards in a 1st and ten situation. Meanwhile, a +2 represents an incredible performance on a play that shifts the dynamic of a game in favor of the player&#x27;s team. Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham&#x27;s strip sack on Tom Brady in Super Bowl LII would have easily been a +2 rating. On the other hand, a −2 is a play that catastrophically hinders a team&#x27;s chance of winning, such as a quarterback throwing a pick-six in the fourth quarter of a close game. Ambiguous plays where the outcome is unclear on how a player impacted their team are typically given a 0.

The sum of these plus-minuses are then converted on a 0–100 scale and produce a grade for a single game. However, a player&#x27;s season grade is not the average of the 17 grades a player receives each game. Instead, PFF credits a player&#x27;s entire body of work and longevity throughout the season. It is, therefore, possible for a player to have a higher season grade than any individual grade that a player received in any game he played in.

<text>Muhammad ibn Ali al-Jawad (, – 29 November 835) was a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the ninth of the Twelve Imams, succeeding his father, Ali al-Rida (). He is known by the epithets al-Jawād () and al-Taqī (). Like most of his predecessors, Muhammad kept aloof from politics and engaged in religious teaching, while organizing the affairs of the Imamite Shia community through a network of representatives (). The extensive correspondence of al-Jawad with his followers on questions of Islamic law has been preserved in Shia sources and numerous pithy religio-ethical sayings are also attributed to him.

Born in Medina in 810–811, Muhammad al-Jawad was the son of Ali al-Rida, the eighth of the Twelve Imams. In 817, the Abbasid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun () summoned al-Rida to Khorasan and designated him as the heir apparent, possibly to mitigate the frequent Shia revolts. This appointment provoked strong opposition in Iraq, which forced al-Ma&#x27;mun to return to the capital Baghdad in 818 and abandon his pro-Shia policies. On the way back to Baghdad, al-Rida suddenly fell ill and died in Tus, likely poisoned by order of al-Ma&#x27;mun as he made concessions to the opposition. Upon the death of al-Rida in 818, the succession of his only son Muhammad to the imamate at the age of about seven became controversial. Most Imamite Shias accepted the imamate of al-Jawad because the Imam, in their view, received his perfect religious knowledge through divine inspiration, irrespective of his age. At the time, some instead turned for leadership to al-Jawad&#x27;s uncle, Ahmad ibn Musa al-Kazim, and some others joined the Waqifites, but the succession of al-Jawad evidently did not create any permanent divisions in the Shia community. Twelver sources often justify the imamate of the young al-Jawad by drawing parallels with Jesus and John the Baptist, both of whom in the Quran received their prophetic missions in childhood.

In 830, al-Jawad was summoned to Baghdad by al-Ma&#x27;mun, who married his daughter Umm Fadhl to the former. This marriage, however, was to be without issue and might have been infelicitous. His successor, Ali al-Hadi, was already born in 828 to Samana, a freed slave (). In 833, al-Ma&#x27;mun died and was succeeded by his brother, al-Mu&#x27;tasim (), who summoned al-Jawad to Baghdad in 835 and hosted him and his wife, possibly to investigate any links between al-Jawad and new Shia revolts. There al-Jawad died in the same year at the age of about twenty-five. All major Sunni sources are silent about the manner of his death, while Shia authorities are nearly unanimous that he was poisoned by his disaffected wife, Umm al-Fadl, at the instigation of her uncle, al-Mu&#x27;tasim. Muhammad al-Jawad was buried next to his grandfather, Musa al-Kazim, the seventh of the Twelve Imams, in the cemetery of the Quraysh, where the Kazimayn shrine was later erected. Kazimayn has since become an important center for pilgrimage.

== Titles ==
Muhammad ibn Ali, the ninth of the Twelve Imams, is occasionally known in Shia sources as al-Taqi (), but more commonly as al-Jawad () for his munificence. The Imam is cited in the Shia hadith literature as Abu Ja&#x27;far al-Thani (), with the title Abu Ja&#x27;far reserved for his predecessor, Muhammad al-Baqir (), the fifth of the Twelve Imams. His is Abu Ali (), though he was also known by his contemporaries as Ibn al-Rida () because he was the only child of Ali al-Rida.

==Life==

=== Birth () ===
Muhammad al-Jawad was born in Medina, or in a village near Medina founded by his grandfather, Musa al-Kazim (). Sources seem to agree that he was born 195 AH (810-811 CE) but the exact date is disputed. Most Twelver sources record mid-Ramadan 195 AH (mid-June 811 CE) as the birthday of Muhammad but Ibn Ayyas () favors 10 Rajab 195 AH (8 April 811 CE). This latter date agrees with , a supplication attributed to Muhammad al-Mahdi, the last of the Twelve Imams. It is this date that the Shia celebrate annually. His father Ali al-Rida, the eighth of the Twelve Imams, was a descendant of Ali ibn Abi Talib () and Fatima (), who were the cousin and the daughter of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, respectively. Most records agree that the mother of Muhammad al-Jawad was a freed slave () from Nubia, though her name is given differently in sources as Sabika or Durra (sometimes Khayzuran). She might have belonged to the family of Maria al-Qibtiyya, a freed slave of the prophet and the mother of his son Ibrahim, who died in childhood.

=== Reign of al-Ma&#x27;mun () ===

==== Marriage () ====
Muhammad stayed behind in Medina when his father al-Rida traveled to Merv in Khorasan at the request of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun (). The caliph designated al-Rida as the heir apparent in 202 AH (817 CE), and also changed the official Abbasid color of black to green, possibly to signify this reconciliation between the Abbasids and the Alids. To form a political alliance, the caliph also married one of his daughters, named Umm Habib, to al-Rida in 202 AH (817 CE) and promised another daughter, named Umm al-Fadl, to Muhammad, who was still a minor at the time, aged about seven. Among Sunni historians, al-Tabari (), Ibn Abi Tahir Tayfur (), and Ibn al-Athir al-Jazari () agree on this report. It is likely that Muhammad was absent from the ceremony, even though Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Bayhaqi () relates that he visited his father in Merv in 202 AH (817 CE). In contrast, the Sunni historian al-Khatib al-Baghdadi () and the Shia-leaning historians al-Mas&#x27;udi () and al-Ya&#x27;qubi () place the betrothal of Muhammad after the death of al-Rida in 204 AH (819 CE), following the return of al-Ma&#x27;mun to his capital Baghdad. In particular, al-Mas&#x27;udi in his &quot;Ithbat al-wassiya&quot; writes that al-Ma&#x27;mun summoned Muhammad to Baghdad, settled him near his palace, and later decided to marry him to his daughter, Umm Fadl, whose given name was Zaynab. According to al-Baghdadi, Muhammad was about nine years old at the time of this betrothal.

==== Death of his father () ====
Ali al-Rida was a prominent Alid, a descendant of Ali ibn Abi Talib, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad. The Alids were viewed as rivals for the caliphate by the Abbasids, who were the descendants of Abbas, a paternal uncle of Muhammad. The appointment of the Alid al-Rida by the Abbasid caliph thus invoked strong opposition, particularly among the members of the Abbasid dynasty and the Iraqi supporters of Abbasid legitimism. These revolted and installed al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s uncle, Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi, as an anti-caliph in Baghdad. The caliph and his entourage thus left Khorasan for Baghdad in 203 AH (818 CE), accompanied by al-Rida. The latter died shortly in Tus after a brief illness, possibly after being poisoned. The death of al-Rida followed the assassination of al-Fadl ibn Sahl (), the Persian vizier of al-Ma&#x27;mun, who had become a divisive figure. Both deaths are linked in Shia sources to al-Ma&#x27;mun and viewed as concessions to the Arab party to smooth his return to Iraq. Modern scholars similarly tend to suspect the caliph in the death of al-Rida. After returning to Baghdad in 204 AH (819 CE), al-Ma&#x27;mun reversed his pro-Shia policies, and restored the traditional black color of the Abbasids. Muhammad was about seven years old when his father died. There are multiple Shia reports that he told others about the death of his father before the news arrived in Medina, and some traditions indicate that he was miraculously present in the burial of al-Rida in Khurasan and prayed over his body.

==== Summoned to Baghdad () ====
Soon after arriving in Baghdad in 204 AH (819 CE), al-Ma&#x27;mun summoned the young Muhammad who then stayed at the court of the caliph. The betrothal of Muhammad and Umm Fadl or its proposal was apparently opposed by some of the Abbasids, reportedly because of the dark complexion of Muhammad. An account of their protests appears in the biographical &quot;Kitab al-Irshad&quot; by the Twelver theologian al-Shaykh al-Mufid (), though the Islamicist Shona F. Wardrop suspects that it may actually refer to the designation of al-Rida as the heir apparent. In any case, al-Mufid suggests that the opposition actually feared the political rise of Muhammad similar to his father al-Rida, and the view of the Islamicist Wilferd Madelung is similar. Those opposed to the marriage arranged for a public debate where the chief judge Yahya ibn Aktam interrogated the young Muhammad with difficult theological questions to which he answered correctly. An account of this is given by al-Mas&#x27;udi, but the seventeenth-century hadith collection &quot;Bihar al-anwar&quot; adds that Yahya also presented Muhammad with provocative questions about the status of the early caliphs Abu Bakr () and Umar (), including an alleged prophetic tradition that compares the two caliphs with the archangels Gabriel and Michael. These claims al-Jawad refuted in mild language. The attribution of this latter exchange to Muhammad al-Jawad is, however, uncertain since a similar exchange between al-Ma&#x27;mun and some Sunni scholars is described by the tenth-century hadith collection &quot;Uyun al-akhbar al-Rida&quot;. At any rate, it is at the end of this assembly that al-Ma&#x27;mun formally married his daughter to Muhammad, according to al-Mas&#x27;udi and al-Mufid. This episode is thus viewed by the Twelvers as evidence of the exceptional knowledge of Muhammad al-Jawad.

&quot;Kitab al-Irshad&quot; implies that Muhammad returned to Medina after this episode in Baghdad. By some accounts, however, he stayed in Baghdad for about eight years, primarily engaged in teaching, before returning to Medina with his family after the death of al-Ma&#x27;mun in 218 AH (833 CE). This is viewed as house arrest by the historian Jassim M. Hussain, citing a report by al-Mas&#x27;udi. There is not much known about this period of his life.

==== Summoned to Baghdad (830) ====
The marriage of al-Jawad to the daughter of the caliph was consummated in 215 AH (830 CE), when al-Ma&#x27;mun invited the former to Baghdad from Medina. The couple stayed there until the Hajj season (January 831) when they returned to Medina after completing the Hajj ritual. Possibly hoping to blunt the Shia opposition through al-Jawad, the caliph is said to have displayed much affection towards the young man. By marrying his daughter to al-Jawad, the Twelver scholar Muhammad H. Tabatabai () suggests that al-Ma&#x27;mun might have wanted to keep a close watch on him from both outside and within his household. Hussain similarly suggests that al-Ma&#x27;mun intended to monitor al-Jawad and divide the Shia opposition, hoping thus to mitigate their revolts, including some fresh uprisings in Qom. This view is rejected by the historian Moojan Momen, who says that al-Ma&#x27;mun might have had little to fear from the revolts in Qom. Medoff believes that al-Ma&#x27;mun pursued a policy of simultaneously appeasing and containing pro-Alid groups, while Wardrop writes that the marriage was intended to discourage the Shia from revolution. Hussain and Esmail Baghestani say that the marriage did not win the Shia support for al-Ma&#x27;mun, nor did it stop the Shia revolts.

=== Reign of al-Mu&#x27;tasim () ===
Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun died in 218 AH (833 CE) and was succeeded by his brother, al-Mu&#x27;tasim, who continued the policy of his predecessor in simultaneously appeasing and containing pro-Alid groups, according to Medoff. It was perhaps to further this policy that al-Mu&#x27;tasim summoned al-Jawad to Baghdad in 220 AH (835 CE) and hosted him and his wife. The departure of al-Jawad was apparently facilitated by Abd al-Malik al-Zayyat at the behest of the caliph. An exception here is the account of al-Mas&#x27;udi which does not explicitly state that al-Jawad was summoned by al-Mu&#x27;tasim. At any rate, al-Jawad died there in the same year, some ten months after his arrival, at the age of about twenty-five. During this short window, Shia sources accuse al-Mu&#x27;tasim of multiple attempts to discredit al-Jawad and finally murdering him. This alleged hostility of al-Mu&#x27;tasim may have been compounded by a recent wave of Shia revolts in Qom and in Taliqan, even though there is no evidence that al-Jawad was involved in them. One such attempt against al-Jawad was prevented by one of his supporters, Ahmad ibn Hammad al-Marwazi, who was nevertheless an advisor to Ibn Abi Dawud, the influential . The caliph apparently abandoned his plan to dishonor al-Jawad by parading him while intoxicated after Ahmad convinced the about the futility of this plan, saying that the ire of the caliph would only strengthen the loyalty of Imamites for al-Jawad. The passed on the advice to the caliph. A different account by Ibn Awrama, quoted in and , describes how al-Jawad unmasked false witnesses who had accused him of plotting against the caliph, though the miraculous ending of this account weakens its historical weight. Another account is narrated by Zurqan, a of the Ibn Abi Dawud: The caliph is said to have solicited and preferred the judicial ruling of al-Jawad about amputating the hand of a thief in the presence of other scholars. This infuriated the , who later visited the caliph and warned him about inadvertently bolstering the public support for al-Jawad as an alternative to al-Mu&#x27;tasim. This then set in motion the plot to poison al-Jawad.

=== Personal life ===
Similar to his predecessors, al-Jawad lived modestly and gave to the poor generously, according to Dwight M. Donaldson (). Baghestani adds that al-Jawad gave charity at the beginning of every month and interceded with the officials on behalf of the people. His arranged marriage in 215 AH (830 CE) to Umm al-Fadl did not result in any children. There are other indications that this marriage was not particularly felicitous, including reports that she complained to al-Ma&#x27;mun about her marriage, specifically about her husband taking a concubine, but the caliph rejected her complaint. Umm al-Fadl is also commonly held responsible in Shia sources for the death of al-Jawad in 220 AH (835 CE) by poisoning. Ali al-Hadi, the successor of al-Jawad, was born to Samana, a freed slave () of Moroccan origin, circa 212 AH (828 CE). Other children of al-Jawad were Musa al-Mubarraqa and two or four daughters. In some genealogical books, other sons have been named but there is no mention of them in the earliest sources. The daughters of al-Jawad are named differently in the sources. Here, al-Mufid gives the names Fatima and Amama, while the biographical source &quot;Dala&#x27;il al-imama&quot; lists Khadija, Hakima, and Umm Kulthum. The Sunni theologian Fakhr Razi () adds Behjat and Barihe to these names, saying that none of them left any descendants. The children of al-Jawad were all born to Samana.

== Death ==

Muhammad al-Jawad died on 6 Dhu al-Hijjah 220 AH (30 November 835 CE) in Baghdad, after arriving there in Muharram 220 (January 835) at the request of al-Mu&#x27;tasim, who hosted him and his wife during the visit. He died at the age of about twenty-five, the youngest among the Twelve Imams. All major Sunni sources are silent about the cause of his death, including those by al-Tabari, al-Baghdadi, and Ibn al-Athir. Among medieval Sunni authors, an exception is Ibn al-Sabbagh, who accepts the possibility of murder. In contrast, Shia sources hold the Abbasids responsible in the deaths of multiple Shia Imams, including al-Jawad. In his case, Shia sources are nearly unanimous that he was murdered at the instigation of al-Mu&#x27;tasim. The silence of Sunni sources here is attributed by the Shia to the atmosphere of fear and intimidation under the Abbasids. In particular, Ibn Shahrashub said that he wrote his &quot;Manaqib ale Abi Talib&quot; &quot;to bring forth what they [the Sunnis] have suppressed.&quot; An exception here is al-Mufid who does not find the evidence for murder credible. Among other sources, &quot;Ithbat al-wassiya&quot; attributes a hadith to al-Rida, childless at the time, in which he apparently predicts the birth of his son al-Jawad and his murder.

While the manner of his death is given differently by Shia authors, most say that al-Jawad was poisoned by his disaffected wife Umm al-Fadl, at the instigation of her uncle al-Mu&#x27;tasim. These include the Shia-leaning historian al-Mas&#x27;udi, and Twelver scholars Ibn Jarir al-Tabari al-Saghir, Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi (), Abbas Qomi (), and Tabatabai. The Twelver scholar Shaykh Tabarsi () does not have a verdict but mentions the prevalent Shia view that al-Jawad was poisoned. Sunni sources typically say that Umm al-Fadl was present in Baghdad when her husband died. Citing the Sunni historian al-Baghdadi and some others, Baghestani writes that she joined the harem of al-Mu&#x27;tasim after the death of al-Jawad. He was buried next to his grandfather, Musa al-Kazim, the seventh of the Twelve Imams, in the cemetery of the Quraysh on the west bank of Tigris, where the Kazimayn shrine was later erected. Kazimayn has become an important center for pilgrimage.

==Imamate==
=== Designation as the Imam ===
Muhammad al-Jawad was about seven years old when his father al-Rida died in 203 AH (818 CE). Even as the only child of al-Rida, the succession of the young Muhammad to the imamate became controversial, but did not result in permanent divisions of the Shia community. At the time, al-Mas&#x27;udi notes the confusion () among the Imamite Shias about the qualifications of the young al-Jawad for the imamate. As related by al-Mas&#x27;udi and Majlesi, several supporters of al-Rida thus gathered in Baghdad at the house of Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Hajjaj, a distinguished companion of the three previous Imams, namely, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq (), al-Kazim, and al-Rida. Of those present, Yunus ibn Abd al-Rahman reportedly suggested they choose a temporary leader until al-Jawad reached adulthood. But the view that prevailed was that adulthood is not a prerequisite for wisdom. There is also the account in &quot;Ithbat al-wasiyya&quot; and elsewhere, saying that the prominent Shias from across the empire tested the young al-Jawad during the Hajj season and their doubts about him were dispelled. There are also reports about the direct or indirect designation () of al-Jawad as the next imam by his predecessor. These are often narrated by the inner circle of al-Rida, thus signifying their visible role in consolidating the imamate of the young al-Jawad. An example of indirect designation is the statement referring to the young al-Jawad as &quot;the greatest blessing for the Shia,&quot; ascribed to al-Rida in the canonical &quot;Kitab al-Irshad&quot; and other sources. Elsewhere, when al-Husayn ibn al-Qiayama questioned the imamate of al-Rida for his lack of an heir at the time, he responded that he would have a son to succeed him.

According to Wardrop, as the only son of al-Rida, recognition of al-Jawad as the heir to the imamate was to be expected, adding that there is considerable evidence in the hadith literature against the horizontal transference of the imamate between brothers after Hasan ibn Ali () and Husayn ibn Ali (), the second and third of the Twelve Imams. Wardrop points out that there were very few qualified alternatives to al-Jawad anyway, naming his uncles, Ahmad ibn Musa and Abdallah ibn Musa, and also a different Hasanid with the latter name. That there was no clear alternative to al-Jawad is also the view of the Muslim jurist Hossein Modarressi. The attention al-Jawad received from al-Ma&#x27;mun, who married him to his daughter, may have also strengthened the case for al-Jawad. Wardrop thus concludes that the main challenge to the imamate of al-Jawad was his young age, given that the imamate was viewed by the Shia as the ultimate source of knowledge () and guidance. A group of followers of al-Rida thus accepted the imamate of his brother, Ahmad ibn Musa, who had earlier rivaled al-Rida. Another group joined the Waqifites, who considered al-Kazim to be the last Imam and expected his return as Mahdi, the promised savior in Islam. Some of these apparently argued that their imam could not be a child. According to Madelung, some others, who had opportunistically backed the imamate of al-Rida after his appointment as the heir apparent, had now returned to their Sunni or Zaydi communities.

==== Precedents ====
As for precedents, there were no child imams before al-Jawad, even though Ali ibn Abi Talib professed Islam at the age of about ten, and Hasan and Husayn formally pledged their allegiance to the prophet when they were about six. Imamite authors have noted that Jesus received his prophetic mission in the Quran when he was still a child, suggesting that al-Jawad also received the requisite perfect knowledge of all religious matters through divine inspiration from the time of his succession, irrespective of his age. Similar statements are also attributed to al-Rida, &quot;This [his age] does not harm him [al-Jawad], Isa [Jesus] became God&#x27;s () when he was three years old.&quot; The related Quranic verse 19:12 includes, &quot;We gave him John the Baptist] () as a child.&quot; Even so, some among the Shia still debated as to whether the young Imam was equal to an adult Imam in every aspect, as evidenced by some reports in heresiographies and in &quot;al-Maqalat&quot; by al-Mufid. The latter reports that some proposed that the &quot;pious men with religious and legal knowledge&quot; should lead until al-Jawad matured. However, the prevailing answer was that both adult and minor Imams are equal since both receive their knowledge from supernatural sources. Indeed, there already were traditions attributed to earlier Imams asserting that each Imam would inherit the full knowledge of his predecessor upon his death.

===Network of representatives===
To organize the affairs of a growing Shia population, which had expanded far to the east of Iraq and Arabia, the young al-Jawad relied heavily on his representatives or agents (, ) throughout the empire. This underground network of agents across the Abbasid empire was founded by his grandfather al-Kazim () and maintained by his son al-Rida. There is even some evidence that an early network existed under al-Sadiq (). This network guided the financial and religious affairs of the Imamite Shias. After the death of al-Rida, it took possibly up to four years for the imamate of al-Jawad to consolidate. In this period of uncertainty, the network of likely continued to function, but did so more independently than ever before. Wardrop suggests that this level of autonomy continued throughout the childhood of al-Jawad. After al-Rida, some agents remained loyal to his successor, possibly after testing him during the Hajj season. These included Abd al-Aziz ibn al-Muhtadi, Ayyub ibn Nuh, and Yahya ibn Abi Imran. Some others did not, including perhaps Safwan ibn Yahya, Muhammad ibn Sinan, Zakariyya ibn Adam, and S&#x27;ad ibn S&#x27;ad. There are conflicting reports about these four and whether they withheld their collected alms from al-Jawad, but some of them are said to have later returned to the Imam. Because of the relative isolation of al-Jawad by the Abbasids, the Imamite Shias normally communicated with their Imam through his agents, except during Hajj when they met directly with him.

During al-Jawad&#x27;s imamate, Shia activists were dispatched to Egypt and elsewhere, as reported by the Twelver traditionist al-Najashi (). They were apparently successful and an account by the Twelver traditionist al-Kulayni () describes how Ali ibn Asbat visited al-Jawad on behalf of the Egyptian Imamites. Among the agents of al-Jawad were Ali ibn Mahziar in Ahvaz, Ibrahim ibn Muhammad Hamdani in Hamedan, Yahya ibn Abi Imran in Rayy, Yunus ibn Abdulrahman and Abu Amr al-Hadhdha&#x27; in Basra, Ali ibn Hasan W&#x27;aseti in Baghdad, Ali ibn Asbat in Egypt, Safwan ibn Yahya in Kufa, Saleh Ibn Muhammad Ibn Sahl and Zakaria ibn Adam in Qom. In addition to these agents, al-Jawad sometimes sent special representatives to cities to collect religious taxes, including Khums. Some followers of al-Jawad received permission to work within the Abbasid government for the benefit of the Shia community. These included Muhammad ibn Isma&#x27;il ibn Baz&#x27;i and Ahmad ibn al-Hamza al-Qomi in the vizierate, Husayn ibn Abd-Allah al-Neishaburi, the ruler of Bost and Sistan, Hakam ibn Alia&#x27; al-Asadi, the ruler of Bahrain, and Nuh ibn Darraj, the of Baghdad and then Kufa. Some of these figures are now known to have secretly paid their Khums to al-Jawad. Towards the end of al-Jawad&#x27;s life, the organization and activities of his agents further expanded. Some of his followers became integrated within the Abbasid army, while he announced his successor, Ali al-Hadi, through his main agent, Muhammad ibn al-Faraj, or through another companion, Abu al-Khayrani.

==== Role in Shia revolts ====
Muhammad al-Jawad adopted a quiescent attitude and kept aloof from politics, similar to many of his predecessors. Nevertheless, Hussain links the 210 AH (825 CE) uprising in Qom to the political activities of al-Jawad&#x27;s agents, even though the Imamite sources are silent about any military involvement of his underground organization. Prior to this revolt, residents of Qom, a rising Shia center, had called on al-Ma&#x27;mun to lower their taxes as he had done for the city of Rayy. The caliph rejected their appeal, then suppressed their subsequent revolt, and substantially raised their taxes. This is detailed by the Twelver traditionist Ibn Shahrashub (), who writes that the Abbasid army demolished the wall surrounding the city, killed many, and nearly quadrupled the taxes. Among those killed was a prominent participant in the uprising, named Yahya ibn Imran, who might have been a representative () of Muhammad al-Jawad. The attitude of al-Jawad towards this uprising, however, remains unclear, as the Imamite sources are silent about this uprising and its connection to al-Jawad or lack thereof. Probably connecting al-Jawad to Shia rebellions, al-Ma&#x27;mun summoned the former from Medina to Baghdad in 215 AH (830 CE) and married his daughter Umm Fazl to him. This marriage, however, did not win al-Ma&#x27;mun the Shia support, nor did it stop the uprisings in Qom. Indeed, some reports by al-Tabari and Ibn al-Athir add that among the rebel leaders who had been exiled to Egypt, Ja&#x27;far ibn Dawud al-Qomi later escaped and rose again in Qom, defeating the Abbasid army in 216 AH. The Shia uprisings continued even after his execution in 217 AH by the Abbasids. After succeeding al-Ma&#x27;mun, al-Mu&#x27;tasim summoned al-Jawad to Baghdad in 220 AH (835 CE) and held him under close surveillance, probably to ascertain his role in the Shia uprisings.

===Companions and narrators of hadith===
Shaykh Tusi () has listed one hundred and sixteen narrators of hadith from al-Jawad, though only a few of them were his trusted companions, including Ali ibn Mahziar Ahvazi, Abu Hashim Dawud ibn al-Qasim al-Ja&#x27;fari, Abd al-Azim al-Hasani, Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Bazanti, Ali ibn Asbat Kufi, Uthman ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Asadi, and Amro ibn Firat. In particular, Ibn Mahziar was the agent of al-Jawad in Ahvaz and wrote two books, namely, &quot;Kitab al-Malahim&quot; and &quot;Kitab al-Qa&#x27;im&quot;, about occultation, which is the eschatological belief that Mahdi, a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, has already been born and subsequently concealed from the public. The two sons of Ibn Mahziar, named Ibrahim and Muhammad, later served as the representatives of the twelfth Imam in Ahvaz. The Imam distanced himself from the Ghulat () who believed in the divinity of Imams. Among them were Abu l-Khattab, Abu al-Samhari, and Ibn Abi Zarqa, who are said to have defamed Shia by forging traditions and attributing them to the Imams and introducing themselves as their representatives.

In Shia sources, al-Jawad is credited with some ( ), that is, supernatural acts or miracles sometimes attributed to saints in Islam. These include speaking at the time of his birth, (teleportation in Islamic mysticism) from Medina to Khorasan for the burial of his father al-Rida, miraculously healing the sick, fulfillment of his prayers for friends and against his enemies, informing about the inner secrets of people, predicting future events, and particularly his death. These are often cited by the Shia as proof of his imamate. A subtle story of this kind in &quot;Bihar al-Anwar&quot; and &quot;Kitab al-Kafi&quot; is told on the authority of Abd-Allah ibn Razin. When visiting the Imam, he decided to gather some of the earth upon which al-Jawad had set foot, a desire that he later deemed sinful. However, his attempts to tactfully do so were all thwarted by al-Jawad, who subtly changed his daily routines. This continued to the point that it surprised the attendant of Imam and let Abd-Allah realize that al-Jawad was aware of his sinful determination. It was only after Abd-Allah resolved to give up that al-Jawad returned to his usual routine.

=== Successor ===
After the death of al-Jawad in 220 AH (835 CE), the majority of his followers acknowledged the imamate of his son Ali, later to be known by the epithets al-Hadi () and al-Naqi (). Similar to his father, Ali was also a minor when he succeeded him in 220 AH (835 CE) at the age of about seven. The will attributed to al-Jawad in &quot;Kitab al-Kafi&quot; stipulates that Ali would inherit from him and be responsible for his younger brother, Musa, and his sisters. Muhammad al-Jawad is also said to have announced the succession of Ali through his main agent, Muhammad ibn al-Faraj, or through Abu al-Khayrani. This messenger relayed the designation to the assembly of companions after the death of al-Jawad and the majority there is reported to have agreed on the imamate of Ali al-Hadi.

== Legacy ==
Muhammad al-Jawad was engaged in teaching during his eight years in Baghdad, and he was renowned for his public defense of Islamic tradition, according to Edward D.A. Hulmes. His extensive correspondence with his followers on questions of Islamic law () about marriage, divorce, and inheritance has been preserved in Shia sources. Ali al-Rida is even said to have praised his son for writing &quot;extremely elegant&quot; letters while still a young boy. According to Hamid Mavani, most Shia hadiths about Khums (Islamic alms, ) are attributed to al-Jawad and his successor, al-Hadi. Mavani regards Khums as an example of the Imams&#x27; discretionary authority as Shia leaders, which in this case countered the redirection of Zakat (another Islamic alms) to sustain oppressive regimes and support the affluent lifestyle of caliphs. Among the Shia, the titles al-Qa&#x27;im () and less frequently al-Mahdi refer to the messianic figure in Islam. This apparently created confusion and al-Jawad is reported to have identified the two, saying that al-Qa&#x27;im is the last Imam and that he would be al-Mahdi. Verses 81:15-16, &quot;O, but I call to witness the planets, the stars which rise and set,&quot; were also interpreted by al-Jawad and his predecessor al-Baqir as referring to the reappearance of al-Mahdi, thus likening him to a shooting star in the dark night. &quot;Musnad al-imam al-Jawad&quot; lists the collections of hadith that contain the sermons and sayings attributed to al-Jawad, including &quot;al-Tazkirat al-Hamdouniya&quot; by the Sunni scholar Ibn Hamdan (). Among many pithy religio-ethical sayings attributed to al-Jawad, Donaldson quotes a few:
* Muhammad al-Jawad related from Ali ibn Abi Talib that, once when the prophet sent him to Yemen, he said to him, &quot;O Ali, he is never disappointed who asks for good (from God), and He never has a motive for repenting who asks (His) advice.&quot;
* Muhammad al-Jawad reported that the prophet had said to Ali, &quot;Rise betimes in the name of God, for God hath bestowed a blessing on my people in their early rising.&quot;
* &quot;Whosoever gaineth for himself a brother in God, hath gained for himself a mansion in Paradise.&quot;
* Muhammad al-Jawad related from the prophet, &quot;Make it a point to travel by night, for more ground can be got over by night than by day.&quot;

<doc id="430195" wikidata="Q6731025" url="?curid=430195" title="Magical girlfriend">
<text>A magical girlfriend, exotic girlfriend, monster girlfriend, nonhuman woman, or supernatural lover, is a female stock character often associated with romantic comedy anime and manga series, and is sometimes considered a genre of its own, or as the leading lady of the &quot;fantastic romance&quot; genre, which combines the fantasy and romance genres.

As Thomas Lamarre states, &quot;Anime fans become familiar with a whole range of female 
figures that are either not really human (robots, aliens, deities, animals), or that possess extra-human powers of some kind or another (from cyborg enhancements to magical or psychic abilities), which take them beyond the merely human woman.&quot;

Magical girlfriends can be one or many in a single series (always attached to the male lead). Because of the tendency for rivals to appear even when there is one female lead and because of the unnatural gender balance among the cast, magical girlfriend comedies are often conflated with harem comedies. A good example of this conflation is &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; which is &quot;one of the prototypical &#x27;harem&#x27; titles&quot; despite the short-lived nature of most of the romantic rivalries.

==History==
Magical girlfriends initially derived from the US television series &quot;Bewitched&quot; and I Dream of Jeannie, which was dubbed for the Japanese market. &quot;Sally the Witch&quot; was the first anime series inspired by &quot;Bewitched&quot;, leading to the popularity of magical girls in Japanese anime.

==Genre characteristics==
Often series in the genre start with the male lead encountering the female lead either by pure chance or by an unusual event, after which the female lead somehow becomes bound or otherwise dependent upon him, often forcing a situation of cohabitation. In many cases, this situation is repeated with other characters (&quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot;), overlapping with the harem genre. However, the male lead is often inexperienced with women despite typically being a &quot;nice guy&quot;. This situation often prevents the relationship from advancing beyond a platonic level throughout most of the series, as an ideal girlfriend doesn&#x27;t come on strong herself and is generally passive in the relationship.

In parodies, the character may be &quot;too young&quot; (i.e. Nakahito Kagura in &quot;Steel Angel Kurumi&quot;; Negi Springfield in &quot;Negima! Magister Negi Magi&quot;) or otherwise have a more rational, ambivalent attitude towards women. A famous early reversal of the cliche occurs with the overtly lecherous Ataru Moroboshi of &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;, who is simply uninterested in &quot;monogamous&quot; relationships despite the fact few women besides his romantically aggressive alien girlfriend find him attractive.

Another feature is that soon after the male and female leads begin to live together, other (usually female) characters from the female (or male) lead&#x27;s origin appear (friends, siblings, relatives, rivals or even enemies), either becoming frequent visitors, cohabitors, or generally causing a disruption, or even moving in with the lead couple. Sometimes a character from the male lead&#x27;s origin will appear. Examples include Ai Yori Aoshi, where Kaoru&#x27;s half-brother tries to take Aoi for himself, and Omamori Himari, where demonslayer Kuesu Jinguuji appears in volume 3 to claim Yuuto Amakawa as her betrothed.

Even when there is one female lead, various rivals always threaten the relationship between the lead characters, often creating complicated &quot;love polygons&quot;. These can vary from being from mundane characters such as men who fight for the affection of the female (and rarely male) lead, or rivals from the female lead&#x27;s origins.

The romantic relationship(s) in magical girlfriend comedies tend to remain static and platonic throughout the series. Commonly episodes involve some sort of superficial threat to the static nature of the relationship (which could be, and often is, the male lead or the girlfriend&#x27;s desire to get closer), which is almost always resolved in some way that doesn&#x27;t fundamentally alter that relationship. Action plotlines are often introduced through some sort of threat from the magical girlfriend&#x27;s origins or through other means. If the romantic relationship(s) do move, it is very slow.

As stated by Annalee Newitz in 1995, &quot;Video Girl Ai&quot;, &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;, &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot;, and &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot;, magical girlfriends are akin to American television shows such as &quot;Bewitched&quot; and &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot; as they portray women who are exceptionally powerful as well as traditionally feminine. Newitz again proposes that magical girl romantic comedies are the culmination between worlds of fantasy and reality. For example, in &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; Belldandy is a goddess who is accidentally summoned by college student Keiichi. Similarly, Newitz alleges that the idea that women “should conceal their power” is a common trope. This is because magical girls in the aforementioned shows almost exclusively use their powers in the home or in their private relationship, but not for power at work or influence outside the domestic realm.

==The &quot;ideal woman&quot; personality, or &quot;yamato nadeshiko&quot;==
Many magical girlfriends are considered by both fans and critics of the genre to be idealizations of woman-kind. This model of the ideal Japanese woman, the &quot;yamato nadeshiko&quot;, is similar to that found in &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. Ideal girlfriends are not necessarily magical in nature. Some &quot;ideal&quot; magical girlfriends may seem weak and emotionally needy, while others may possess a godly power stemming from their feminine traits.

Ideal women have absolute dedication to whatever work they do and for whomever they have great affection, although depending on the character&#x27;s actual talents this can make for anything from &#x27;quite capable&#x27; to &#x27;well-meaning klutz&#x27;. They usually have calm, gentle and demure personalities. They generally suppress selfish desires in favor of desiring good for others.

Ideal women are always naive or innocent, sometimes explained by the girlfriend&#x27;s origins which do not allow for many experiences with mainstream life. Paradoxically, other characters of the girlfriend&#x27;s origin tend not to be as naive (e.g. Belldandy of &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot; is more naive than even her kid sister). Ideal women are emotionally insightful, seeing the good in others when most wouldn&#x27;t and forgiving their shortcomings.

Ideal women are examples of &quot;moe&quot; girls in manga and anime. As such, ideal girlfriends are not overly independent. They are proper Japanese women who typically will not initiate romantic action themselves, except in a delicate or indirect manner. However, numerous characters are so innocent as to not understand the nature of their actions. Independence and aggression (especially in sexual matters) is a trait of parodies of the ideal girlfriend such as Lum in &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot;, Kurumi in &quot;Steel Angel Kurumi&quot; or Hazuki in &quot;Tsukuyomi -Moon Phase-&quot;.

Parodies of the ideal woman are often selfish and become involved with the male lead because of their own selfish desires which are not (initially) shared by their mate. While the male lead usually has some sort of hold over his girlfriend (as &quot;husband,&quot; &quot;fiancé,&quot; provider, contract holder, client, creator, master, or even owner) the parody of the ideal girlfriend either succeeds in inverting the power balance of relationship or simply reverses roles.

Shōjo artists have written another sort of parody of magical girlfriends. Shōjo writers put more emphasis on the girl. Examples include &quot;Absolute Boyfriend&quot;, in which an ordinary girl gets a magical boyfriend, and &quot;Ultra Maniac&quot;, in which a Middle School girl meets and becomes best friends with a magical girlfriend; followed by their misadventures at finding boyfriends.

Susan J. Napier has described the popularity of the ideal magical girlfriend, for example, Belldandy and Ai to be a backlash against the &quot;yellow cab&quot; social phenomenon, where some Japanese women were seeking out sexual relationships with non-Japanese men.

==Examples of &quot;magical girlfriend&quot; characters==
* Belldandy of &quot;Oh My Goddess!&quot;
* Lum of &quot;Urusei Yatsura&quot; (a parody of the ideal girlfriend)
* Lala Satalin Deviluke of &quot;To Love Ru&quot;
* Chi of &quot;Chobits&quot;
* Saati Namba of &quot;A.I. Love You&quot;
* Haruko of &quot;FLCL&quot;
* Shaorin of &quot;Mamotte Shugogetten&quot;
* Night of &quot;Absolute Boyfriend&quot; (male equivalent of magical girlfriend)
* Sun Seto of &quot;My Bride Is a Mermaid&quot;
* Valkyrie of &quot;UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie&quot;
* Phryne of &quot;Fractale&quot;

==In Western media==

Tiffany White of Pop Matters, in her review of the &quot;Mannequin&quot; movies, classifies magical girlfriend movies with this template:
* Main protagonist is a loser who has no luck with girls or has a real girlfriend who doesn&#x27;t understand him.
* Main guy finds a magical girlfriend (usually an angel, mermaid, or science experiment) and they fall in love.
* An antagonist lurks about, and its sole purpose is exposing the magical girlfriend.
* In the end, the protagonist and the magical girlfriend escape persecution, gain public acceptance, and spend the rest of their lives happy ever after.

A.E. Sparrow of IGN, in reviewing &quot;Mamotte Shugogetten&quot;, also relates magical girlfriends shows to their western counterparts:
&quot;She&#x27;s completely devoted to protecting her new &quot;master&quot; from any misfortune, utterly oblivious to the ways of the modern world, and (in cute girl manga terms) a total knockout. If you&#x27;re not completely immersed in the world of manga yet, think &quot;I Dream of Jeannie&quot;. If you are, then think &quot;Oh! My Goddess!&quot;. Either one works if you&#x27;re looking for a comparison.&quot;

Examples of magical girlfriend in Western media include: Lisa from &quot;Weird Science&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot; in &quot;Date with an Angel&quot;, and Madison from &quot;Splash&quot;. For science fiction, girlfriends can also be labelled as &quot;algorithm-defined fantasy girl&quot; and range from robots such as Ava in &quot;Ex Machina&quot; to artificial intelligence systems such as Samantha in &quot;Her&quot; and Joi in &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot;.

<text>Pacific Palisades is a neighborhood in the Westside region of the city of Los Angeles, California, situated about west of downtown Los Angeles. Throughout January 2025, the majority of Pacific Palisades was severely affected and destroyed by the Palisades Fire, a part of the wider series of the Southern California wildfires. 

Pacific Palisades was founded in 1921 by a Methodist organization. The Palisades would later be sought after by celebrities and other high-profile individuals seeking privacy. It is known for its seclusion, being a close-knit community with a small-town feel, Mediterranean climate, hilly topography, natural environment, abundance of parkland and hiking trails, a strip of coastline, and for being home to several architecturally significant homes. In 2022, the community&#x27;s population was 23,121.

Pacific Palisades is a largely residential community and did not attract many tourists other than day visitors to Gladstones Malibu, the local beaches, the Getty Villa or the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine.

Nicknamed the Palisades and Pali by surfers and locals, the Palisades coast spans from after Sorrento Beach in Santa Monica to the south, and ends at Sunset Point Beach and Malibu to the north. Beaches along the Pacific Palisades coast include: Will Rogers State Beach, Sunset Point Beach, and Ginger Rogers Beach. The many parks within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area lie along the ridges above the community, along with local parks that include Will Rogers State Historic Park.

The Palisades is bounded by Brentwood to the east, the unincorporated community of Topanga to the west, Santa Monica to the southeast, the Santa Monica Bay to the southwest, and the Santa Monica Mountains to the north.

==History==
===Native American period===
Archeological evidence shows Native American Indians living in the Santa Monica Mountains and the surrounding area including Pacific Palisades for over 10,000 years. Prior to European contact, the western sections of the Santa Monica mountains were inhabited by the Tongva people. The closest Tongva settlement to Pacific Palisades with a written record is the village of Topa&#x27;nga. The village of Topa&#x27;nga sits on the western-most edge of Tongva territory, neighboring the territory of the Chumash people to the north. Due to this close proximity to the Chumash, the culture in western Tongva territory contained elements of Chumash influence.

===Mexican period===

During the period of Mexican rule of California, the land that became Pacific Palisades belonged to Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, granted by the governor of California to Francisco Marquez and Ysidro Reyes in 1839. The Ysidro Reyes Adobe was the first adobe home ever built in Santa Monica Canyon, erected in the year 1838 on land now known as Pampas Ricas Blvd in Pacific Palisades. Sketches of adobe dwelling exist in the collection of the UCLA Library. A memorial plaque sits in a boulder on Pampas Ricas Blvd commemorating the adobe house, dedicated in the 1950s. Ysidro Reyes died in 1863. Reyes left his portion of Rancho Boca de Santa Monica to his widow, Maria Antonia Villa, who sold it to developer and railroad magnate Robert Symington Baker in 1875.

===1911–1922: Inceville and Hartville===
In 1911, film director Thomas Ince constructed his historic film studio Inceville on a tract of land he leased called &quot;Bison Ranch&quot; at Sunset Blvd. and Pacific Coast Highway in the Santa Monica Mountains. Today this is where the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine is located, a Pacific Palisades landmark. By the following year, Ince had earned enough money to purchase the ranch and was able to lease an additional lot in what is now in the Palisades Highlands neighborhood, stretching up Santa Ynez Canyon. This was the first major development built in the Palisades since the Mexican rancho era.
This was the first studio in the area which featured silent stages, production offices, printing labs, a commissary large enough to serve lunch to hundreds of workers, dressing rooms, props houses, elaborate sets, all in one central location.

When Inceville was completed, the streets were lined with many types of structures, from humble cottages to mansions, mimicking the style and architecture of different countries. Extensive outdoor western sets were built and used on the site for several years. According to Katherine La Hue in her book, &quot;Pacific Palisades: Where the Mountains Meet the Sea&quot;:

Ince invested $35,000 in building, stages and sets ... a bit of Switzerland, a Puritan settlement, a Japanese village ... beyond the breakers, an ancient brigantine weighed anchor, cutlassed men swarming over the sides of the ship, while on the shore performing cowboys galloped about, twirling their lassos in pursuit of errant cattle ... The main herds were kept in the hills, where Ince also raised feed and garden produce. Supplies of every sort were needed to house and feed a veritable army of actors, directors and subordinates.

While the cowboys, Native Americans and assorted workers lived at Inceville, the main actors came from Los Angeles and other communities as needed, often taking the red trolley cars to the Long Wharf in what is now the Temescal Canyon neighborhood, where buckboards conveyed them to the set.

Ince lived in a house overlooking the vast studio in what is now the Marquez Knolls neighborhood. Indeed, &quot;Inceville&quot; became a prototype for Hollywood film studios of the future, with a studio head (Ince), producers, directors, production managers, production staff, and writers all working together under one organization and under the supervision of a General Manager, Fred J. Balshofer. 

On January 16, 1916, a fire broke out at Inceville, the first of many that eventually destroyed all of the buildings. Ince later gave up on the studio and sold it to William S. Hart, who renamed it Hartville. Three years later, Hart sold the lot to Robertson-Cole Pictures Corporation, which continued filming there until 1922. La Hue writes that the place was virtually a ghost town when the last remnants of Inceville were burned on July 4, 1922, leaving only a &quot;weatherworn old church, which stood sentinel over the charred ruins.&quot;

===1921–1931: Methodist Episcopal Church===

A decade later, the Rev. Charles H. Scott and the Southern California Methodist Episcopal Church bought the land; in 1922, Scott founded Pacific Palisades, envisioning an elaborate religious-intellectual commune. Believers snapped up choice lots and lived in tents during construction. By 1925, the Palisades had 100 homes. In one subdivision, streets were named in alphabetical order for Methodist missionaries (the &quot;Alphabet Streets&quot;). The tents eventually were replaced by cabins, then by bungalows, and ultimately by multimillion-dollar homes. The climate of the area was a big selling point. Temperatures are much cooler than inland Los Angeles during summer, but usually sunnier and less foggy than areas south along the coast (e.g. Santa Monica).

The name &quot;Pacific Palisades&quot; comes from the term for a tall wooden fence or defensive wall, by analogy with the cliff-like bluffs situated on the western side of the neighborhood bordered by the Pacific Ocean. These bluffs were said to resemble those in the Palisades section of New Jersey, on the western side of the lower Hudson River.

Pacific Palisades enjoyed steady growth throughout the Roaring 20s. The paving of Sunset Boulevard in 1925 brought an increased flow of traffic through the community and offered more convenient access to nearby Westwood and Beverly Hills.

In 1928, the Los Angeles Police Department began renting temporary office space in the now-historic Business Block building for the price of $10 a month. The following year, a motorcycle officer was assigned to make nightly patrols in the area. The Palisades finally acquired its own fire station in 1929, located on Sunset, adjacent to where the local Chase Bank branch now stands in the Village neighborhood.

By 1929 the town consisted of about 365 homes with about 1,000 residents, who mostly resided in the &quot;Alphabet Streets&quot; neighborhood, although residential construction was now expanding into what would later become the Castellammare, Huntington and Paseo Miramar neighborhoods. On August 18 of that year, the cornerstone was laid for the foundation of the Methodist Episcopal Church on Via de la Paz, which at that time was the community&#x27;s only church. Directly across the street, planning was underway for the town&#x27;s first permanent school building which would later become known as &quot;Palisades Elementary&quot;, which was dedicated on June 12, 1931.

By the end of the decade, nearly all remaining open areas of Pacific Palisades were being developed, reflecting the period’s booming growth and the Palisades&#x27; coastal allure. Golfers were already enjoying the Riviera Country Club, opened in 1927, and the Bel-Air Bay Club opened in March 1930.

===1930–present===
During the 1930s and 40s, the Palisades attracted German, German-Jewish and Austrian-Jewish intellectuals and artists fleeing from Hitler’s Holocaust, including associated with the Exilliteratur literary movement, such as Thomas Mann, Lion Feuchtwanger, Theodor W. Adorno, Vicki Baum, Herbert Zipper, and Emil Ludwig. Some of these exiles had previously sought refuge in the south of France, but fled to the United States after the fall of France. They were surprised by the similarities with the Mediterranean climate and topography. Villa Aurora on Paseo Miramar, the Spanish colonial home of Feuchtwanger and his wife, Marta, became the focal point of the expatriate community, which was nicknamed &quot;Weimar by the Sea&quot;. Some non-Jewish exiles who were married to people with Jewish ancestry chose to settle in the Palisades as well, such as Thomas Mann and his wife Katia Mann who resided at 1550 San Remo Drive in the Riviera neighborhood.

For many decades there was a virtual ban on the sale of alcoholic beverages in the district, and a Chinese restaurant, House of Lee, held the only liquor license. The Methodist Church created a Chautauqua Conference Grounds in Temescal Canyon. The Presbyterian Synod purchased the property in 1943 and used it as a private retreat center until the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy purchased the property in 1994 to become Temescal Gateway Park.

Though the Palisades had a notable Jewish population since at least the 1930s, it was still largely Methodist until the 1970s. This is when the Palisades began to see an increase in affluent Jewish migration. Mort&#x27;s Deli, , opened in 1972; it closed in 2007.

In 2021, a wildfire destroyed about in Pacific Palisades and an arson suspect was detained.

On January 7, 2025, the Palisades Fire began north of Bienveneda Ave. The fire was propelled at a rapid rate of spread due to extremely high Santa Ana Winds and critically dry brush. The fire quickly spread through the Palisades and neighboring communities before being fully contained on January 31. The fire destroyed 6,831 structures, damaged 973 structures, injured 3 civilians, 1 firefighter, and killed 12 civilians. It is the tenth-deadliest and third-most destructive California wildfire on record and the most destructive to occur in the history of the city of Los Angeles.

In winter, they average around giving it a tropical feel although it is a few degrees too cool to be a true tropical climate on average due to cool night temperatures. Pacific Palisades has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.

Pacific Palisades, like much of the rest of the southern California coast, is subject to a late spring/early summer weather phenomenon called &quot;June Gloom&quot;. This involves overcast or foggy skies in the morning that yield to sun by early afternoon.

Pacific Palisades averages of precipitation annually, mainly occurring between November and March, generally in the form of moderate rain showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall during winter storms. Rainfall is usually higher in the neighborhoods located in the hills and coastal slopes of the Santa Monica Mountains, such as the Highlands and Castellammare; due to orographic uplift. Summer days are typically rainless. Rarely, an incursion of moist air from the south or east can bring brief thunderstorms in late summer, especially to the mountains. The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the inland and mountain areas get considerably more. Years of average rainfall are rare. The usual pattern is year to year variability, with a short string of dry years of rainfall, followed by one or two wet years with more than . Wet years are usually associated with warm water El Niño conditions in the Pacific, dry years with cooler water La Niña episodes. A series of rainy days can bring floods to the lowlands and mudslides to the hills, especially after wildfires have denuded the slopes.

Both freezing temperatures and snowfall are extremely rare in the hills and canyon ridges and along the coast, with the last occurrence of a reading being on. While the most recent snowfall occurred in January 2021, it has also occurred several other times in recorded history, the second-most recent being in February 2019, with snow falling in some areas of the Palisades as recently as January 2021. At the official downtown station, the highest recorded temperature is on September 27, 2010, while the lowest is , on January 4, 1949. During autumn and winter, Santa Ana winds sometimes bring much warmer and drier conditions to Pacific Palisades, and raise wildfire risk.

==Landmarks==

===Burns House===

It occupies a narrow ledge on a steep slope of the Santa Monica canyon. The house is composed of an interlocking set of shed roofs and tower, its forms reminiscent of The Sea Ranch Condominium, but adapted for a sense of the Mediterranean climate and Hollywood allusions. An interior staircase climbs up through a vertical cleft in the narrow house, and then at the very top of the third story, the stair descends outside, back down into a swimming pool court. Designer Tina Beebe developed with Moore the color scheme, whereby exterior planes were painted in a range of ochres, pinks, roses, and golds, so as the light and shade shifts during the day, the house itself seems to change like a chameleon.

Pacific Palisades is home to a variety of species of wildlife, both native to the area and introduced from elsewhere.

===Wild parrots===
Pacific Palisades has been noted for its large population of California wild parrots, and is one of the main areas in Southern California where wild parrots can be found. Parrots mainly live in the sycamore-lined canyons of the Palisades. Wild parrots have lived in the Palisades since the 1960s, and are said to descend from pet parrots that were released by their owners in the area in the wake of the 1961 Bel Air fire, and the closing of Busch Gardens in Van Nuys.

Pacific Palisades is home to numerous species of parrots, and the most commonly-sighted species is the Nanday parakeet. Other species of parrots found in the Palisades include the mitred parakeet, yellow-chevroned parakeet, white-winged parakeet, rose-ringed parakeet, red-masked parakeet, blue-crowned parakeet, red-crowned parrot, lilac-crowned parrot, white-fronted parrot, blue-fronted parrot, yellow-headed parrot, and the red-lored parrot.

<doc id="430209" wikidata="Q315377" url="?curid=430209" title="Ali al-Hadi">
<text>ʿAlī ibn Muḥammad al-Hādī (; 828 – 868 CE) was a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the tenth Imam in Twelver Shia, succeeding his father, Muhammad al-Jawad (). Born in Medina in 828, Ali is known with the titles al-Hādī () and al-Naqī (). After the death of his father in 835, most followers of al-Jawad readily accepted the imamate of Ali, who was still a child at the time. Drawing parallels with the story of young Jesus in the Quran, Twelver sources attribute an exceptional innate knowledge to Ali which qualified him for the imamate despite his young age.

As with most of his predecessors, Ali al-Hadi kept aloof from politics until he was summoned around 848 from Medina to the capital Samarra by the Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil (), known for his hostility towards Shias. There al-Hadi was held under close surveillance until his death in 868 during the caliphate of the Abbasid al-Mu&#x27;tazz (). Still, he managed to communicate with an underground network of representatives who organized the financial and religious affairs of the Shia community on his behalf. Most Shia sources hold the Abbasids responsible for his death at the age of about forty through poison, with the notable exception of al-Mufid (). His image in Twelver sources is that of a pacifist, persecuted Imam who endured numerous attempts by members of the Abbasid court to humiliate and dishonor him. These sources also allege more serious incidents of house search, temporary imprisonment, and even murder plots against al-Hadi.

The restricted life of al-Hadi in Samarra marks the end of the direct leadership of the Shia community by the Imams. A theological treatise on free will and some other short texts are ascribed to al-Hadi. Some miracles are also attributed to al-Hadi in Twelver sources, which often emphasize his precognition about various incidents. After his death, the majority of his followers accepted the imamate of his son Hasan al-Askari, who was also detained in Samarra until his unexplained death a few years later. Some instead followed Ja&#x27;far, another son of al-Hadi, who became known as Ja&#x27;far al-Kadhab () in the Twelver sources. After the death of Ja&#x27;far, however, this branch was eventually absorbed within the mainstream Twelver Shia. The tombs of al-Hadi and his successor al-Askari are located in the al-Askari shrine in Samarra, modern-day Iraq. A sacred site for Shia pilgrims, the shrine has been targeted by ISIS (Daesh) extremist militants as recently as 2007.

== Titles ==
Ali ibn Muhammad, the tenth Imam in Twelve Imams, was known by the titles al-Hadi () and al-Naqi (). He was also known as al-Mutawakkil (), but this title was perhaps rarely used to avoid confusion with the Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil (). In view of their restricted life in the garrison town of Samarra under Abbasid surveillance, Ali and his son Hasan share the title al-Askari (). Ali al-Hadi is also cited in the Shia hadith literature as Abu al-Hasan al-Thalith (), so as to distinguish him from his predecessors, namely, Musa al-Kazim () and Ali al-Rida (), the seventh and the eighth of the Twelve Imams, respectively.

==Life==
===Birth ()===
Ali al-Hadi was born on 16 Dhu al-Hijja 212 AH (7 March 828 CE) in Sorayya, a village near Medina founded by his great-grandfather, Musa al-Kazim. There are also other given dates in the window of Dhu al-Hijja 212 AH (March 828) to Dhu al-Hijja 214 AH (February 830), though these alternatives might be less reliable. It is also 15 Dhu al-Hijja that is annually celebrated by Shias for this occasion. Ali al-Hadi was the son of Muhammad al-Jawad (), the ninth of the Twelve Imams, and his mother was Samana (or Susan), a freed slave () of Maghrebi origin. The historian Teresa Bernheimer considers it possible that Ali was instead born to Umm al-Fadl, a daughter of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun (), though this marriage is often considered without an issue. As for his birthplace, the Shia-leaning historian al-Mas&#x27;udi () differs from the prevalent view. , a collective biography of the Shia Imams attributed to him, reports that Ali was first taken to Medina sometime after 830, when al-Jawad and his family left Iraq to perform Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.

=== Reign of al-Mu&#x27;tasim ()===

Ali al-Hadi lived in Medina in this period. Probably summoned by al-Mu&#x27;tasim (), his father al-Jawad and his wife Umm al-Fadl traveled to the Abbasid capital Baghdad in 835, leaving Ali behind in Medina. Muhammad al-Jawad died in Baghdad in the same year, at the age of about twenty-five. During this short window, Shia sources accuse al-Mu&#x27;tasim of multiple attempts to discredit al-Jawad and finally murdering him by poison, while Sunni sources are silent about the cause of his death. Ali al-Hadi was about seven years old when his father died. Among others, multiple Shia accounts in and show Ali supernaturally alert the very moment his father died. is another early collective biography of Shia Imams, often attributed to the Twelver author Ibn Jarir ibn Rustam al-Tabari.

After the death of his father, the young Ali was likely placed by the Abbasids under hostile care. In these years, even Muhammad ibn Faraj, a trusted associate of the previous Shia Imams, was probably unable to directly contact Ali, as implied by a report in , a seventeenth-century collection of Shia hadiths by the prominent Twelver scholar Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi (). reports that Umar ibn al-Faraj al-Rukhaji, an Abbasid official known for his hostility to Shias, visited Medina soon after the death of al-Jawad and placed Ali under the care of a non-Shia tutor, named Abu Abd-Allah al-Junaydi. This was intended to isolate Ali from Shias, to the point that reports that he was kept under house arrest. The account in also describes how al-Junaydi was so impressed with the knowledge of the child that he eventually became a Shia. This exceptional innate knowledge of the young Ali is also claimed by the prominent Twelver theologian al-Mufid () in his biographical , which is considered reliable and unexaggerated by most Shias. In connection to these reports, the Islamicist Matthew Pierce draws parallels with the Hebrew Psalms, Christian gospels, and the Quran, particularly the Quranic verse 3:46 about Jesus, &quot;He will speak to people in the cradle.&quot;

=== Reign of al-Wathiq () ===
Ali al-Hadi emerged from isolation with the accession of the less hostile caliph al-Wathiq in 842, who had earlier led the funeral prayer for al-Jawad. The Shia community was relatively free in this period, and the early historian Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani () reports that stipends were given to the Alids, that is, the descendants of Ali ibn Abi Talib (), the first Shia Imam. An Alid himself, Ali al-Hadi was also less restricted in this period. He engaged in teaching in Medina after reaching adulthood, possibly attracting a large number of students from Iraq, Persia, and Egypt, where the House of Muhammad traditionally found the most support. An account by Ibrahim ibn Mahziyar al-Ahwazi describes a visit to Ali al-Hadi in 228 AH (842-3) to deliver some goods, accompanied by his brother Ali. The two brothers were both trusted associates of al-Jawad. According to the Islamicist Shona F. Wardrop, this may be an indication of the young Ali beginning to renew links with the loyal followers of his father, al-Jawad. In the next five years, Ali al-Hadi successfully established contact with representatives from several regions. An account in from this period might show the political awareness of the young Ali, even though it has been given a miraculous aspect in some other sources. This account is dated 232 AH (846-7) and narrated by a servant in the court of al-Wathiq, named Khayran al-Khadim, whom Ali al-Hadi inquires about the caliph&#x27;s health. Khayran tells him that al-Wathiq is dying, adding that the general view is that he would be succeeded by his son. Ali, however, correctly predicts the accession of the caliph&#x27;s brother Ja&#x27;far al-Mutawakkil ().

=== Reign of al-Mutawakkil () ===
Partly due to renewed Zaydite Shia opposition, al-Mutawakkil persecuted Mu&#x27;tazilites and Shias, to the point that even Sunni sources have noted his hostility towards Shias. The caliph may have imposed the penalty of death by flagellation on anyone who defamed the companions or the wives of the prophet, some of whom are viewed negatively in Shia. He also openly cursed Ali ibn Abi Talib and ordered a clown to ridicule Ali in his banquets, writes the Twelver scholar Muhammad H. Tabatabai (). By his orders, the shrine of Ali&#x27;s son, Husayn (), was demolished in Karbala, water was turned upon the tomb, and the ground was plowed and cultivated to remove any trace of the tomb, so as to stop Shia pilgrimages to the site, which he also outlawed.

The campaign of arrests and torture by al-Mutawakkil in 846 led to the deaths of some associates of Ali al-Hadi in Baghdad, al-Mada&#x27;in, Kufa, and the Sawad. These were replaced by new representatives, including Hasan ibn Rashid and Ayyub ibn Nuh. The policies of al-Mutawakkil also pushed many Alids in the Hejaz and Egypt into destitution. The caliph is said to have punished those who traded with the Alids, thus isolating them financially. The village of Fadak, which had previously been returned to the Alids by al-Ma&#x27;mun, was now confiscated by al-Mutawakkil and awarded to a descendant of the early caliph Umar (), named as Abd Allah ibn Umar al-Bazyar. The caliph also dismissed officials suspected of Shia sympathies, including the governor of Saymara and Sirawan in the province of Jibal. As the governor of the holy cities in the Hejaz, al-Mutawakkil appointed Umar ibn Faraj, who prevented Alids from answering religious inquiries or accepting gifts, thus pushing them into poverty. The caliph also created a new army, known as Shakiriyya, which recruited from anti-Alid areas, such as Syria, al-Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia), the Jibal, the Hejaz, and from the Abna, a pro-Abbasid ethnic group. He implemented these policies with the help of his officials, particularly Ahmad ibn al-Khasib al-Jarjara&#x27;i () and al-Fath ibn Khaqan ().

==== Summoned to Samarra () ====
It was during the caliphate of al-Mutawakkil that the governor of Medina, Abd Allah ibn Muhammad, wrote to the caliph and warned him about the subversive activities of al-Hadi, claiming that he had concealed arms and books for his followers. Alternatively, attributes the affair to Burahya al-Abbasi, the leader of prayers in Medina, who may have advised the caliph to remove al-Hadi from the city because he was allegedly agitating against the caliph. When al-Hadi learned about the allegations, he too wrote to al-Mutawakkil and defended himself. The caliph responded respectfully but also requested that he with his family relocate to the new Abbasid capital of Samarra, a garrison town where the Turkish guards were stationed, north of Baghdad. This letter also announced the dismissal of Abd Allah from his post in Medina, and is recorded in and , a comprehensive collection of Shia hadiths by the prominent Twelver scholar al-Kulayni (). The Islamicist Wilferd Madelung suggests that the letter is authentic, while Wardrop views the reverential and conciliatory tone of the letter as an indication that the caliph was cautious not to provoke an Alid rebellion in Medina, even though there is no evidence that al-Hadi actually intended to revolt. The Muslim academic Jassim M. Hussain suggests that al-Hadi was summoned to Samarra and held there because the investigations of caliph&#x27;s officials, including Abd Allah, had linked the Shia Imam to the underground activities of the Imamites in Baghdad, al-Mada&#x27;in, and Kufa. The caliph thus decided to follow the policy of his predecessor, al-Ma&#x27;mun, who had attached the imams al-Rida and al-Jawad to his court in order to monitor and restrict them.

The caliph&#x27;s letter was probably dated Jumada al-Thani 233 AH (January 848), but transmitted incorrectly as Jumada al-Thani 243 AH (October 857) by al-Mofid, the author of . Both Wardrop and Madelung consider the latter date unlikely, while the first date is also corroborated by , which states that al-Hadi spent twenty years of his life in Samarra. The escort who accompanied al-Hadi to Samarra is named variously in different sources as Yahya ibn Harthama, Yahya ibn Hubayra, or Attab ibn Abi Attab. The account of al-Mas&#x27;udi adds that this escort searched the residence of al-Hadi in Medina, without finding any evidence of subversion. He also calmed the public disorder by ensuring the locals that al-Hadi would not be harmed. A similar report is given by the Sunni historian Ibn Khallikan ().

==== Life in the Abbasid court ====
When al-Hadi approached Baghdad, people gathered to see him and he was received warmly by the governor, Ishaq ibn Ibrahim al-Tahiri, who welcomed him outside of the city. Later, when al-Hadi arrived in Samarra on 23 Ramadan 233 AH (1 May 848), the caliph did not immediately receive him but assigned a house for him, located in the al-Askar () quarter of the city, which was mostly occupied by the army. More specifically, his residence was in the center of the city on the Abi Ahmad street. Having escorted al-Hadi to Samarra, Yahya conveyed to the caliph the recommendations of al-Tahiri and the Turkish commander Wasif, which apparently convinced the caliph to treat al-Hadi honorably. Still, there is a report that al-Hadi was temporarily placed under house arrest after his arrival in Samarra.

Ali al-Hadi lived in Samarra under constant surveillance until his death, some twenty years later. Among modern authors, Edward D. A. Hulmes, Moojan Momen, Hamid Mavani, and Reza Aslan liken al-Hadi to a prisoner in this period. In particular, he could rarely meet with ordinary Shias, as suggested by the scarcity of such reports in the early sources. For instance, describes a group of eager visitors for al-Hadi, who nevertheless had no idea what their imam looked like. The reports about this period depict a persecuted al-Hadi, who suffered frequent attempts by al-Mutawakkil and others at the court to belittle and dishonor him. More seriously, there is some evidence that al-Mutawakkil at least once attempted to kill al-Hadi during this period. Tabatabai and the Muslim academic Abdulaziz Sachedina go further, writing that the caliph on multiple occasions was intent on killing al-Hadi and had his house searched. Sachedina believes that fear of public unrest prevented al-Mutawakkil from killing al-Hadi, who was recognized by this time as a pious and learned figure.
In contrast, Madelung quotes al-Hadi as saying that he had not come to Samarra voluntarily but would never leave the city, as he liked its good water and air. His view is that al-Hadi was allowed to move freely within the city, and continued to send (written) instructions for his representatives across the Abbasid empire and receive through them the donations of Shias. Sachedina views this freedom of movement as an indication that al-Hadi did not pose a serious threat, while Wardrop suggests that the passive spiritual excellence of the Shia Imams was probably considered a more serious threat than an armed rebellion which could be easily crushed.

That al-Hadi remained in contact with his followers is also the opinion of the Islamicists Farhad Daftary, Sachedina, and Hussain, but the last author believes that al-Hadi sent and received his messages with secrecy, under the watchful eyes of the caliph. For Wardrop, a certain cycle of honor and suspicion was probably inevitable at the court of al-Mutawakkil. Still, in the case of al-Hadi as a Shia Imam with an active following, the image offered by Twelver sources is heavily tilted towards suspicion and persecution. Wardrop also notes that most reports about al-Hadi are attributed to this period, perhaps because al-Hadi was more &#x27;newsworthy&#x27; in Samarra, being close both to the center of power and to the large Shia population of Iraq. In her view, many of these reports might be exaggerated but they are likely based on truth and thus unwise to ignore.

==== Sample reports from the period ====
Wardrop also studies a few representative accounts about al-Hadi from this period: reports that al-Mutawakkil ordered to search the residence of al-Hadi at night on a tip by al-Batha&#x27;i, an Alid supporter of the caliph. The search did not turn any evidence of subversive activities and the money seized was later returned to al-Hadi. After the search, a relieved al-Mutawakkil invited al-Hadi to drink wine with him late at night. The latter refused and instead recited some poetry, the moral theme of which moved the caliph to tears. Accounts of futile searches appear also in by al-Mas&#x27;udi and in by Ibn Khallikan. Shortly before the overthrow of al-Mutawakkil in 861, a temporary imprisonment of al-Hadi is reported in by the Twelver historian al-Tabarsi () and in , under the custody of one Ali ibn Karkar. The caliph may have ordered his close advisor Ibn Khaqan to poison the imprisoned al-Hadi. Also dated 861, the biographical by the Twelver scholar Qutb al-Din al-Rawandi () similarly reports a house arrest of al-Hadi under Sa&#x27;id al-Hajib, who was allegedly ordered to kill the Imam. In his report, a visitor finds al-Hadi seated next to an open grave in his house but is reassured by him that he would not be harmed because al-Mutawakkil would die shortly. reports that the prayer of al-Hadi in the palace was once interrupted by a member of the court who accused him of hypocrisy. In an official banquet to which he was invited, al-Hadi silenced a man who continued to loudly interrupt him by predicting his imminent death, reports . A report on the authority of Zurara, a member of the court, states that the caliph offered a reward to anyone who would embarrass al-Hadi. The offer was taken up by an Indian knowledgeable of various sleights of hand, the report continues, who arranged for the loaves of bread to move away when al-Hadi reached for them, bringing the crowd to laughter. reports that al-Mutawakkil temporarily forbade his staff from serving al-Hadi, advised by a relative nicknamed Harisa, who warned the caliph that this was boosting the political image of al-Hadi among people. This Twelver report has a miraculous ending with the caliph abandoning his policy after an unexpected breeze blew the curtains open for al-Hadi instead of the guards.

=== Later years (861–868) ===
Ali al-Hadi continued to live in Samarra after the assassination of al-Mutawakkil in 861, through the short reign of al-Muntasir (), followed by four years of al-Musta&#x27;in (), and until his death in 868 during the caliphate of al-Mu&#x27;tazz (). In particular, al-Muntasir and al-Musta&#x27;in somewhat relaxed the anti-Alid policies of al-Mutawakkil, and al-Hadi thus lived more freely in those years. For instance, al-Muntasir apparently returned Fadak to the Alids and allowed them to visit the tomb of Husayn. Still, under al-Musta&#x27;in, his governor of Egypt arrested the Alid leader Ibn Abi Hudra, and deported him and his supporters to Iraq in 862, according to the Sunni historian Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Kindi (). Also in Egypt, a follower of al-Hadi by the name of Muhammad ibn Hajar was killed and the estate of another follower, Saif ibn al-Layth, was confiscated by the ruler, according to al-Kulayni. Elsewhere, some supporters of al-Hadi were arrested in Samarra, while his main agent in Kufa, Ayyub ibn Nuh, was prosecuted by the local judge ().

On the other hand, Hussain writes that Alid revolts broke out in 864–5 in Kufa, Tabaristan, Rayy, Qazvin, Egypt, and the Hejaz. He adds that the rebel leader in Mecca was an Imamite named Muhammad ibn Ma&#x27;ruf al-Hilali (), while the Kufan rebel leader Yahya ibn Umar () was praised by Abu Hashim al-Ja&#x27;fari, an agent of al-Hadi. Later under al-Mu&#x27;tazz, the Abbasids discovered connections between some rebels in Tabaristan and Rayy and certain Imamite figures close to al-Hadi, who were thus arrested in Baghdad and deported to Samarra. These included Muhammad ibn Ali al-Attar, Abu Hashim al-Ja&#x27;fari, and apparently the two sons of al-Hadi, namely, Hasan and Ja&#x27;far. More such links to al-Hadi are listed by the Sunni historian al-Tabari (). Hussain suggests that all this paved the way for the murder of al-Hadi by the Abbasids during the caliphate of al-Mu&#x27;tazz. It is also the view of Sachedina that the restrictions on al-Hadi were renewed under al-Mu&#x27;tazz, who is accused by Shia sources of murdering al-Hadi.

== Death (868) ==

According to both al-Tabari and al-Kulayni, al-Hadi died on 26 Jumada al-Thani 254 AH (21 June 868) at the age of about forty and during the caliphate of al-Mu&#x27;tazz. Other reported dates fall in Jumada al-Thani and Rajab 254 AH (June–July 868). In particular, 3 Rajab is annually commemorated by Shias for this occasion. Most Shia authors record that he was poisoned by the Abbasids. The exceptions are al-Mufid, who is silent about the cause of death of al-Hadi, the Shia-leaning historian al-Ya&#x27;qubi (), who writes that he died mysteriously, and al-Isfahani, who does not list al-Hadi among the Alid martyrs in his biographical . Among modern authors, Tabatabai holds that al-Hadi was poisoned at the instigation of al-Mu&#x27;tazz, while Hussain links the murder of al-Hadi to the Abbasids discovering his connections to the ongoing Shia revolts. In contrast, Momen says that the &quot;real power&quot; was in the hands of the Turkish generals by the time al-Hadi died and that the murder of al-Hadi would have had no political benefit for the caliph. The manner of his death is also given differently by the sources.

In addition to al-Hadi, Shia sources hold the Abbasids responsible for the deaths of multiple Shia Imams. The silence of Sunni sources here is attributed by Shia authors to the atmosphere of fear and intimidation under the Abbasids. In particular, the Twelver traditionist Ibn Shahrashub () said that he wrote his &quot;Manaqib ale Abi Talib&quot; &quot;to bring forth what they [the Sunnis] have suppressed.&quot; There is also a tradition attributed to Muhammad al-Baqir (), the fifth of the Twelve Imams, to the effect that none of them would escape an unjust death after attaining fame, except their last, whose birth would be concealed from the public. A similar tradition is ascribed to al-Rida, the eighth of the Twelve Imams, this time in response to a follower who had expressed his hope to see the Imam in power because &quot;people have paid allegiance to&quot; al-Rida and &quot;coins have been struck&quot; in his name.

The funeral prayer is said to have been led by al-Muwaffaq (), a brother of the caliph. A large number of mourners, however, forced the family to bring the body of al-Hadi back to the house, where he was then buried. The house was later expanded to a major shrine by various Shia and Sunni patrons. More recently, the complex was rebuilt in 1868–9 at the request of Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (), ruler of Persia and a Twelver, and the golden dome was added in 1905. In addition to al-Hadi, the shrine also houses the tombs of his son, Hasan al-Askari, and his sister, Hakima Khatun. As an important destination for Shia pilgrimage, the shrine was bombed in February 2006 and badly damaged. Another attack on 13 June 2007 destroyed the two minarets of the shrine. Iraqi authorities hold the Sunni extremist group al-Qaeda responsible for both attacks.
==Personal traits==
After accounting for the bias of his Twelver sources, the historian Dwight M. Donaldson () writes that al-Hadi comes across to him as a &quot;good-tempered, quiet man,&quot; who endured for years the &quot;hatred&quot; of al-Mutawakkil with dignity and patience. For Wardrop, the image of al-Hadi in Shia sources is that of a &quot;pacifist, persecuted Imam,&quot; who always remains unmoved by his enemies&#x27; attempts to &quot;humiliate and attack him.&quot; In these reports, she adds, al-Hadi maintains a detached and dignified pose in threatening situations, thus impressing upon others the certitude of his belief in the protection of God. In such situations, the response of al-Hadi in Shia sources is often to invoke the intervention of God through prayer, for he viewed the &quot;invocation of oppressed against the oppressor&quot; more powerful than &quot;cavalry, weapons, or spirits,&quot; in a tradition attributed to him in . To showcase what she describes as the detachment of al-Hadi from &quot;the trivial anxieties of [the material world],&quot; Wardrop mentions the account of an occasion when his house was searched at night for money and weapons, as given by the Twelver sources , , and . By this account, the soldiers who broke into his house found him praying and he then helped them in their search. After this futile search and similar episodes, al-Hadi again invokes the power of God in Shia sources rather than indulging in &quot;verbal attack or enraged silence.&quot;

==Imamate==

=== Designation ===
After the death of al-Jawad in 835, most of his followers acknowledged his son Ali as the next Imam. As with his father, Ali al-Hadi was still a minor when he succeeded to the imamate at the age of about seven. Thanks to the precedent of al-Jawad, however, the imamate of Ali was widely accepted without much demur, even though in both cases the inner circle of their predecessors must have played a visible role in consolidating their imamate. The only account about the succession of Ali al-Hadi is given by multiple sources, including , , and . By this account, the designation () was orally delivered to one Abu al-Khayrani by al-Jawad, who thus appointed his son Ali as his successor. Wardrop identifies this person as Ahmad ibn Hammad al-Marwazi, who was close to al-Jawad, while elsewhere he is named as Khayran al-Khadim, a servant of al-Jawad. At any rate, Abu al-Khayrani then wrote to a few notable Imamite figures with the news of this designation, with instructions to open the letters if he died. The oral designation was also overheard by Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Isa, a reputable Imamite from Qom, who happened to be there to inquire about the health of al-Jawad.

When al-Jawad died, Ahmad met with Muhammad ibn al-Faraj al-Rukhaji and ten other unnamed Imamite figures and listened to Abu al-Khayrani. Of these, Muhammad was a representative of al-Jawad, who came to the forefront after his death. Indeed, the meeting took place at Muhammad&#x27;s house and it was him who invited Abu al-Khayrani to join them. At the meeting, the claim of Abu al-Khayrani was reluctantly corroborated by Ahmad, who said he preferred the honor to have gone to an Arab rather than a non-Arab (). After some contemplation, the group accepted the imamate of Ali, the report concludes. More evidence is found in the will attributed to al-Jawad in &quot;Kitab al-Kafi&quot;, which stipulates that his son Ali would inherit from him and be responsible for his younger brother, Musa, and his sisters. For the Muslim jurist and academic Hossein Modarressi, the account of his succession suggests that the seniority of Ali over his brother was not sufficient and the Shia community had to be convinced that Ali was directly appointed by his father. A small group initially followed Musa as their imam but soon returned to Ali al-Hadi after Musa dissociated himself from them.

===Representatives===
Bernheimer considers the imamate of al-Hadi as a turning point for Shia: the direct leadership of the Shia community by the Imams effectively ended by al-Hadi&#x27;s summons to Samarra, where he was held under constant surveillance by the Abbasid caliphs until his death. Still, similar to his predecessors, al-Hadi secretly communicated with an underground network of representatives (, ), who were responsible for the financial and religious affairs of the Imamite Shias, and particularly for the collection of religious dues, such as Khums (). These agents gradually took over the function of guiding and organizing the Shia community, following the same principle of political quietism to which the Shia Imams adhered. Their efforts seem to have been divided into four geographic areas; the first one included Baghdad, Mada&#x27;in, the Sawad, and Kufa, the second area included Basra and Ahwaz, the third included Qom and Hamadan, and the fourth included the Hejaz, Yemen, and Egypt. Each of these four areas was entrusted to an agent, who was also responsible for appointing local agents within his area.

Imamite sources also describe some failed attempts by the Abbasids to intercept the agents, including feigned sympathy by Ibn Khaqan to infiltrate the network or last-minute aborted missions of the agents. Nevertheless, there were waves of crackdowns by al-Mutawakkil in 850 and by al-Mustai&#x27;n in 862. Some of the arrested agents died under torture while others were imprisoned. Among the trusted agents of al-Hadi were Ali ibn Mahziar Ahwazi, Uthman ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Asadi, Ahmad ibn Ishaq al-Ash&#x27;ari, Ali ibn Bil&#x27;al, Ibrahim ibn Muhammad al-Hamadani, Ali ibn Ja&#x27;far, Ayyub ibn Nuh, Hasan ibn Rashid, and Muhammad ibn al-Faraj al-Rukhaji. Because of the underground nature of this network, there were also probably some who falsely claimed to represent al-Hadi. In particular, Faris ibn Hatim ibn Mahawayh al-Qazvini was initially a representative of al-Hadi and his intermediary with the Imamites living in the Jibal, which encompassed the central and western parts of modern-day Iran. Faris was involved in a dispute with Ali ibn Ja&#x27;far around 862 and was consequently banned by al-Hadi from receiving alms on his behalf. He continued to do so, however, without forwarding them to al-Hadi, who excommunicated Faris in 864 for embezzling religious dues. As Faris continued to openly incite against al-Hadi, the latter called for his death, and he was indeed assassinated during the imamate of Hasan al-Askari.

=== Miracles ===
In Twelver Shia, al-Hadi is considered knowledgeable in the languages of the Persians, Slavs, Indians, and Nabataeans. Similarly, al-Tabarsi writes that al-Hadi was articulate in seventy-three languages, probably in reference to the hadith, attributed to Muhammad, that his community would be split to seventy-three groups. This was not unique to al-Hadi, however, and miracles of speech are attributed to all Shia Imams. One of the many such accounts about al-Hadi is narrated by Ibrahim ibn Mahziyar, who describes a meeting with a young al-Hadi in 228 AH (842-3) in the company of his brother Ali and their servant Masrur, whom the following day al-Hadi sent for and spoke to in his native language of Persian.

Ali al-Hadi is also credited in Twelver sources with predicting the death of al-Mutawakkil, who had either imprisoned or humiliated al-Hadi. The variations of this account appear in the Twelver sources , , , and . His precognition is also highlighted in another account, appearing in for instance, according to which al-Hadi already knew the religious question of his visitors. Narrated by Ishaq ibn Abd-Allah al-Alawi, a distant relative of al-Hadi, the question was about the significance of fasting on the birthdate of the Islamic prophet, the day he received his divine message, the day on which the earth was flattened, and the day of the Ghadir Khumm. In this vein, Ali al-Hadi showed a companion a vision of heaven, according to . On one occasion, describes that the soldiers tasked with killing al-Hadi did not dare to harm him because of &quot;his awe-inspiring presence,&quot; seeing around him a hundred raised swords. In the presence of al-Mutawakkil, al-Hadi debunked the claim of a woman who pretended to be Zaynab, daughter of Ali ibn Abi Talib. He reputedly did so by descending into the caliph&#x27;s den of lions to prove that they do not harm true descendants of Ali ibn Abi Talib. This the woman refused to imitate. It is also said that al-Hadi brought to life a picture of a lion on a carpet, which then ate a juggler who had attempted to humiliate the Imam with his tricks by order of al-Mutawakkil. Another tradition states that he turned a handful of sand into gold for the poor. When he set out for Samarra, despite clear skies, al-Hadi prepared for heavy rain which indeed materialized within a few hours to the amazement of his escort. When asked about it, however, al-Hadi rejected any miraculous interpretation of the incident, saying that he had simply recognized the signs of a brewing storm as a native, as reported in by al-Mas&#x27;udi.

===Succession===
Ali al-Hadi was survived by two sons, namely, Ja&#x27;far and his older brother Hasan. The latter was born in Medina to an , whose name is variously given in different sources as Hudayth, Susan, or Salil. After al-Hadi, the majority of his followers acknowledged as their next imam his adult son Hasan, who is commonly known by the title al-Askari () on account of his almost life-long detention in the garrison town of Samarra, after moving there with his father as a child. Imamite sources report that al-Hadi designated Hasan as his successor a month before his death in 868. This appointment came after the death of his eldest son Muhammad, whom some expected to be the next Imam.

After the death of al-Hadi, his other son Ja&#x27;far unsuccessfully claimed the imamate for himself, and he is thus referred to as Ja&#x27;far al-Kadhab () in the Imamite sources. Some apparently considered Ja&#x27;far particularly unfit for the position because of his poor reputation. The death of Muhammad and the poor reputation of Ja&#x27;far thus facilitated the accession of Hasan. He was, however, unknown to many Imamites, as suggested by , and the representatives of al-Hadi must have played an important role in consolidating the imamate of Hasan. Still, some considered al-Hadi to be the last Imam and Hasan is said to have written to Imamite figures across the Abbasid empire to dispel their doubts about his imamate.

When Hasan al-Askari died without an obvious heir in 874, some of his followers rejected his imamate, because the Imam could not be childless, as they argued. Among them, the now-extinct Muhammadites contended that Muhammad ibn Ali al-Hadi must have been the rightful eleventh Imam, even though he had predeceased his father. For them, Muhammad was the Mahdi, the messianic figure in Islam to (re)appear at the end of times to eradicate injustice and evil. Probably related to this group was Ibn Nusayr, who considered Ali al-Hadi to be divine and claimed to be his prophet. He is considered the founder of the Nusayris, a now-extinct Ghali sect of Shia. The Ghulat () believed in the divinity of the Shia Imams.

==== Ja&#x27;farites ====
Those who accepted the imamate of Ja&#x27;far, the youngest son of al-Hadi, are known as Ja&#x27;farites. Its members arrived at this claim in different ways. One faction turned to Ja&#x27;far after the death of his brother Hasan al-Askari in 874, who did not leave an obvious heir. Another subgroup of Ja&#x27;farites believed that al-Askari himself had designated Ja&#x27;far as his successor. Notable among them was the Kufan theologian Ali ibn Tahi (or Talhi) al-Khazzaz. This Ali ranked among the Fathites, many of whom thus joined the Ja&#x27;farites. Yet another subgroup held that Ja&#x27;far was directly designated by his father al-Hadi as his successor. A different subgroup was the Nafisites, who believed that al-Hadi was to be succeeded by his eldest son Muhammad. Before his death in the lifetime of al-Hadi, they say, Muhammad designated his youngest brother Ja&#x27;far as his successor, skipping the older Hasan. More specifically, they believed that Muhammad entrusted his testament to his servant Nafis, who passed it on to Ja&#x27;far. The latter thus claimed he was the successor to Muhammad. Nafis himself was killed.

Similarly, some followers of Faris ibn Hatim claimed that he was succeeded by his son Muhammad, who appointed his brother Ja&#x27;far as the next Imam before his death during the lifetime of al-Hadi. They accordingly accepted the imamate of Ja&#x27;far instead of al-Askari. This was apparently an act of defiance to Hasan al-Askari, who had sided with his father al-Hadi when he excommunicated Faris for embezzling religious funds and openly inciting against him. In any case, Ja&#x27;far soon died and some then turned to his descendants for leadership. The Ja&#x27;farites were nevertheless extinct by 373 AH (983-4), as some converted to the mainstream Twelver Shia and some emigrated to Egypt or elsewhere and joined Sufi orders.

==Works==
A theological treatise on free will and various short texts are attributed to al-Hadi and quoted in &quot;Tuhaf al-uqul,&quot; a Twelver collection of hadiths. According to Mavani, most Shia hadiths about Khums are also attributed to al-Hadi and his predecessor, al-Jawad. Some regard Khums as an example of the Imams&#x27; discretionary authority as religious and temporal Shia leaders, which in this case countered the redirection of Zakat (another Islamic alms) &quot;to sustain the oppressors [the caliphs] and to secure their affluent lifestyle,&quot; according to the Shia jurist Hussein-Ali Montazeri (). One example is the response of al-Hadi to a letter from his new agent Hasan ibn Rashid, in which the former describes Khums as a levy on possessions and produce, and on traders and craftsmen, after they had provided for themselves. This last part is clarified in a letter from al-Hadi to another agent, named Ibrahim ibn Muhammad al-Hamadani, which explains that Khums is levied after providing for the land and for dependents, and after the (land tax) for the ruler.

Donaldson quotes one of the prophetic traditions related on the authority of al-Hadi, through Ali ibn Abi Talib, which defines faith () as contained in the hearts of men, confirmed by their deeds (), whereas surrender () is what the tongue expresses which only validates the union. A hadith attributed to al-Hadi in predicts the occultation of his grandson, the twelfth Imam, and refers to him as () from the House of Muhammad. Mavani quotes another hadith, ascribed to al-Hadi and transmitted by al-Tabarsi, as follows.

<text>The secretaire en portefeuille is an antique desk form which is usually mounted on rollers at the end of four jutting legs. The legs in turn support what looks like an oversize vertically mounted wooden pizza box. This is a cabinet a few inches thick, with barely enough space in it for the raised desktop surface and a few pens and sheets of paper disposed vertically. It is also called a &quot;Billet doux&quot;.

The secretaire en portefeuille is much like a fall front desk which has been reduced in depth to a bare minimum. Like the fall front desk and the secretary desk the secretaire en portefeuille&#x27;s desktop lifts up to cover internal areas and must thus be cleared of all work before closing up. By its mobile nature and its relatively light weight it was sometimes used as a fire screen desk. It was also sometimes known by that name.

Its name comes from the French word for wallet: &quot;portefeuille&quot;. This is probably because it has the same proportions as many kinds of wallets and it opens up a bit like some of them.

Modern day cabinet makers and furniture designers have sometimes created contemporary versions of the secretaire en portefeuille, eschewing the florid designs of the antique ones.

<text>Cain and Abel are a pair of characters from DC Comics based on the biblical Cain and Abel. They are key figures in DC&#x27;s &quot;Mystery&quot; line of the late 1960s and 1970s, which became the mature-readers imprint Vertigo in 1993.

Cain and Abel are based on the biblical Cain and Abel, but are altogether different characters from their Biblical counterparts. Cain and Abel are one of many key figures in DC&#x27;s &quot;Mystery&quot; line-up referred to as horror hosts of the late 1960s and 1970s, which later became a part of the mature-readers imprint Vertigo. They were depicted as brothers and they are also sons of DC Comics&#x27; [[Eve (DC Comics)|Eve]] (another DC horror host based on the Biblical figure Eve). In 1993, host characters like Cain, Abel, Eve and Lucien were retconned as a part of the Dreaming in the critically acclaimed Sandman comic books. The character Cain is also commonly associated with his pet gargoyle [[#Gregory|Gregory]].

==Publication history==
===Cain===

In 1968, Cain was created to &quot;host&quot; the EC-style horror comic anthologies &quot;The House of Mystery&quot; (which had begun publishing in 1950). Cain, &quot;the Able Care-Taker&quot;, created by Bob Haney, Jack Sparling and Joe Orlando, first appeared in &quot;The House of Mystery&quot; #175 (July–August 1968), modeled on writer Len Wein, who was new to the field. (A photograph of Wein as Cain can be found in &quot;Elvira&#x27;s House of Mystery&quot; #4 (June 1986).)

&quot;The House of Mystery&quot; was cancelled in 1983. The final issue showed Cain in front of the House for sale, with his bags packed, and Gregory, his pet gargoyle, behind him. In the mid-1980s, Cain became a supporting character in &quot;Blue Devil&quot; (as caretaker of the &quot;House of Weirdness&quot;), with Abel and Gregory making occasional appearances as well.

===Abel===
In 1969, Abel was created to &quot;host&quot; the companion EC-style horror anthology &quot;The House of Secrets&quot; (which in its Silver Age run, was published from 1956 to 1966). In 1969, DC editor Joe Orlando created the design for Abel, based on his assistant, Mark Hanerfeld:

Abel&#x27;s first comics appearance was in &quot;DC Special&quot; #4 (July–September 1969), ironically written by Hanerfeld and illustrated by Bill Draut. &quot;The House of Secrets&quot; was revived with #81 (August–September 1969) and Abel began hosting immediately.

In 1978, &quot;The House of Secrets&quot; (along with another horror title, &quot;The Witching Hour&quot;) was merged into &quot;The Unexpected&quot; (which itself was canceled in 1982).

===Together===
During the 1970s, Cain and Abel (along with Eve) also co-hosted the horror/humor anthology &quot;Plop!&quot; Both comics had been running &quot;Dial H for Hero&quot; and &quot;Eclipso&quot;, respectively, before the introduction of the new host characters.

The cover of Vertigo&#x27;s mostly-reprint &quot;Welcome Back to the House of Mystery&quot; (July 1998) showed Cain returning to the House with Abel and Gregory. Both of the anthologies that Cain and Abel debuted in are cited as one of the comic books that Neil Gaiman grew up with which helped pave the way for Cain and Abel revival within &quot;The Sandman&quot; comic books.

On the letters page of &quot;Weird Mystery Tales&quot; #3 (November 1972), Destiny stated that Cain, along with Abel and Eve, were &quot;not&quot; the same characters as their Biblical counterparts, whom Destiny said he found much more pleasant. Cain, Eve and, to a lesser extent, Abel, subsequently taunt Destiny for being dull. &quot;The Dreaming&quot; early issues (#1–4, #8) established that Cain and Abel are their biblical counterparts. It was annotated that they did not know whether they were or if they had false memories but found evidence tying them to their biblical counterparts during the story. In the 8th issue, their wives, Jumella (Abel&#x27;s twin and Cain&#x27;s wife) and Aclima (Cain&#x27;s twin and Abel&#x27;s wife), who are also their twin sisters, and Seth were introduced to the DC Universe.

==Fictional character biography==
===&quot;House of Mystery/Secrets&quot;===

Cain told tales about people who boarded the House of Mystery. Abel stammeringly took abuse from Cain and the House of Secrets, and had an &quot;imaginary&quot; (always in quotes) girlfriend named Goldie who berated him too. Goldie was the imaginary friend of Dick Giordano&#x27;s son. Abel told the stories directly to Goldie in the early issues, although he always appeared to be alone. He said that she was a ghost.

Cain is a thin, long-limbed man with an angular, drawn face, glasses, a tufty beard, and hair drawn into two points above his ears. He is often cruel to Abel, but he is jovial and a friendly storyteller to children and does everything he can to help Superman; he has no qualms about trapping innocent people inside his television set, however, and he was employed by a vicious mink furrier. Abel is a nervous, stammering, kind-hearted man, also with a tufty beard and black hair that comes to points above his ears. He is shorter and fatter than Cain, with a more open face. The only time Abel does not stutter is when he is telling a story (&quot;The Sandman&quot; vol. 2 #40). Cain owns a large, green gargoyle named Gregory, who first appears (as a baby) in &quot;The House of Mystery&quot; #175apparently the offspring of enchanted sculptures who come to the house for a French sculptor who murdered the artist who designed them. Gregory grew to maturity during the series, and continued to appear in &quot;Sandman&quot; stories. He ate the Earth-1 counterparts of writer Paul Kupperberg and editor Jack C. Harris. Cain had a black cat named Oskar, who did not get along with Gregory.

Abel moves in with Cain in the House of Mystery shortly before &quot;DC Special&quot; #4. Cain calls it a temporary situation until the House of Secrets is transported, which occurred in &quot;House of Secrets&quot; #81 one month later. Their ages are vague, but Abel tells a story he claims to have heard from Cain (who frightened him with it as a child in 1957); the story originally appeared in &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; #17 (September 1957).

In the final issue of &quot;The House of Mystery&quot;, Karen Berger (whom Cain met in issue #292, the first issue she edited for DC) is an unexpected guest at Cain&#x27;s birthday party, takes him through a secret door that leads to the DC offices, and tells him that his series has been canceled and he is too old-fashioned. The house is torn down, and Cain metafictionally analyzes his own existence as a character in a comic book.

The characters were revived in 1985 by Alan Moore, who introduced them into his &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; series in issue #33 by retelling the Swamp Thing&#x27;s origin story as depicted in a 1971 issue of &quot;House of Secrets&quot;. Cain kills Abel for revealing a secret and tells Abby Holland, &quot;I invented murder!&quot; In &quot;Blue Devil&quot; #20 (January 1986), Cain is the caretaker of the House of Weirdness until Blue Devil moves in and discovers that Abel is there too. He says that the California mansion is owned by &quot;a publishing company back east&quot;.

During the &quot;Crisis&quot; (not mentioned in that series), Elvira stumbles onto the House of Mystery. The house charges her with finding Cain, who had disappeared. Metropolis is seen through a window in the garage of the House of Weirdness. Cain and Blue Devil are seen peering at Elvira in &quot;Elvira&#x27;s House of Mystery&quot;. Cain and Abel reappear in &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; #49–50, where they are observers and commentators on a fierce battle in hell.

They are depicted together in Abel&#x27;s first appearance and they go to their respective houses at the end of the story (the House of Secrets having been recently moved), with Cain promising that things would not go the way they did before. Although Cain abuses Abel, he does not kill him until &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; vol. 2 #33. They usually do not appear together; Cain directs more of his taunts at the reader, and Abel tries to reassure Goldie or the reader. In &quot;The House of Mystery&quot; #257 (April 1978), asylum escapee &quot;Killer&quot; Cowan kills six people on Christmas Eve. Cowan storms into the House of Mystery in a Santa Claus suit and orders Cain to keep him occupied with stories; Cain says that he does not want to entertain someone who ruins all that the holiday stands for. Abel is said to be a voyeur in &quot;Secrets of Sinister House&quot; #14, and shown to be one in &quot;The Sandman&quot; vol. 2 #60.

===&quot;The Sandman&quot; and &quot;The Dreaming&quot; ===
The second volume of &quot;The Sandman&quot;, written by Neil Gaiman, reintroduced the characters. It is implied by the dialogue between Lucifer and Cain (who had been sent by Dream as a messenger due to his invulnerability) that the biblical Cain and Abel came to live in the Dreaming at Dream&#x27;s invitation. To support this, Lucifer quotes the verse in the Bible which says that Cain was sent to live in the Land of Nod. This could be a post-&quot;Crisis retcon&quot;, however, as Destiny claimed in &quot;Weird Mystery Tales&quot; #3 that they were not the same as the Biblical Cain and Abel. The nature of reality in the Dreaming is often multiple and when Cain, Abel, and Eve are telling young Daniel Hall three stories, Cain objects to Abel&#x27;s &quot;Lil&#x27; Endless&quot; style retelling of their origin claiming that &quot;they [the Endless] didn&#x27;t even look remotely human, none of us did!&quot; Abel later responds to Matthew the Raven&#x27;s query about whether they are their biblical namesakes or not by stating: &quot;...oh, none of this happened on Earth...&quot; before being interrupted by Cain. Eve also states that she is not Cain&#x27;s mother, to which Cain replies, &quot;You&#x27;re everyone&#x27;s mother&quot;. This sequence of events would seem to indicate that rather than being the actual literal beings Cain, Abel, and Eve the Dreaming&#x27;s incarnation of them are closer to their archetypal roles of first murderer, first victim, and first mother. This is supported by several incidents when Cain or Abel have identified themselves as such and claimed that their cycle of murder and resurrection is punishment for their role in the first murder. This would also allow Joe Kubert&#x27;s DC Comics adaptation of the Cain and Abel story from the Bible, in which he ignored their &quot;Mystery&quot; likenesses, to fit neatly into the canon.

Cain frequently kills Abel in a kind of macabre form of obsessive-compulsive disorder, re-enacting the first murder. In the Dreaming, Abel&#x27;s death is impermanent, and he seems to recover after a few hours. Cain seems unable to control his frequent murders of Abel, and occasionally expresses remorse over them; there is a genuine bond between the two, beneath the surface contempt. Abel remains dedicated to Cain, and frequently dreams of a more harmonious relationship between the two.

In turn, in the graphic novel &quot;The Sandman: The Wake&quot;, Cain is so distraught when Abel is murdered permanently by the Kindly Ones, he sinks into a rambling mess when asking the new Dream to restore him. In preparation for the funeral services for the deceased Dream, Cain&#x27;s anger boils over yet again when Abel reveals a secret, but he is calmed by a reprimand and restrained from murdering Abel. He displays a contract, renewed in 1989 (the year &quot;The Sandman&quot; began) that states that only he is allowed to kill Abel, because Abel can resurrect only when Cain kills him.

In the first appearance of the characters in &quot;The Sandman&quot; vol. 2 #2, Cain gives Abel an egg that soon hatches into another gargoyle, a small golden one. Abel is delighted and names the gargoyle &quot;Irving&quot;, but Cain forcefully insists that the names of gargoyles must always begin with a &quot;G&quot;. When Abel resists, Cain murders him, and after Abel revives he renames the gargoyle &quot;Goldie&quot;, after a friend of his who &quot;went away&quot;.

The main function of Cain and Abel throughout &quot;The Sandman&quot; is comic relief. However, the two play significant (though not key) roles at several points in the series; it is they who take Morpheus in until his strength is restored following his 72-year-long imprisonment. In the fourth story arc, &quot;Season of Mists&quot;, Cain is sent to Hell to give a message to Lucifer because the Mark of Cain protects him. Those who would harm Cain would have the full wrath of God visited upon them. Lucifer merely finds this funny, since he is already in Hell.

Cain and Abel also aid The Corinthian with the child Daniel during &quot;The Kindly Ones&quot;, the penultimate story arc of the series. They also appear with Morpheus in &quot;The Books of Magic&quot; #3.

===Recent history===
Recently, both Cain and Abel have appeared in the new &quot;House of Mystery&quot; title. Abel appeared in the missing House of Mystery with Goldie, claiming to be on a secret mission to retrieve the various nightmares that were still in the house when it vanished. Meanwhile, Cain, under the guise of a mysterious coachman, plotted with various groups to retake the House of Mystery, which he saw as his rightful property. Eventually, Cain was able to broker a deal to become the co-manager of the House of Mystery&#x27;s current incarnation as a bar, and both he and Abel have become regular members of the series&#x27; cast.

==Other characters ==
===Gregory===
Gregory is a green gargoyle and the pet of Cain. He communicates in &quot;grunts&quot;, which the inhabitants of the Dreaming appear to understand. He helps Goldie re-assemble Abel when Cain kills him. He first appeared as the child of two stone gargoyles in &quot;The House of Mystery&quot; #175, wherein his parents perched on the House of Mystery until they were able to kill their sculptor, a boarder in the house who had murdered their designer, and left without their egg. He later appears in &quot;Blackest Night&quot; defending Scandal Savage, the new owner of the House of Mystery, from the Suicide Squad.

===Eve===

Eve, a minor fixture of the DC Comics universe, is based on the Biblical Eve, the mother of humanity and the wife of Adam within the Bible narrative in the Book of Genesis, while being an altogether new and different character. She was depicted as an original horror host for the publication company. She is depicted as the mother of both Cain and Abel (though she often denied it) and &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the DC Universe&quot; stated that they were cousins. She would be revived by Vertigo Comics with her character being retconned as part of the Dreaming. She is one of four recurring hosts of horror / suspense anthologies that were revived in &quot;The Sandman&quot; that are part of the Dreaming, with the other three being Cain, Abel and Lucien.

Eve originally appeared in &quot;Secrets of Sinister House&quot; #6 (August–September 1972); she was the series&#x27; principal host, often in stock images, usually with her raven. After issue #15, in which Eve reveals in the letter column that her raven, Edgar Allen , is an enchanted deceased human, editor Joe Orlando departed from the series and so did she, the series focusing on &quot;sinister houses&quot;. That month (December 1973), she started hosting one story per month in &quot;Weird Mystery Tales&quot;.

She became the principal host of &quot;Weird Mystery Tales&quot; with issue #15, replacing Destiny, who had moved to &quot;Secrets of Haunted House&quot; as its principal host. In &quot;Plop!&quot;, Eve, Cain, and Abel each tell one story per issue. She also made a few appearances in &quot;The House of Mystery&quot; and &quot;The House of Secrets&quot;.

In &quot;Weird Mystery Tales&quot; #3 (November – December 1972), Destiny insisted that Eve, Cain, and Abel are not their Biblical eponyms. When she is shown in &quot;The Sandman&quot; vol. 2 #2, Lucien&#x27;s comment about her addresses her unfriendly nature prior to Dream&#x27;s return, stating that she confines herself to nightmares.

In her early appearances, she appears only as a crone, is often identified as a witch, and has a tendency to sharp her speech. In her first appearance, she scares Cain and Abel and shouts at them, &quot;Get out of the kitchen when it gets too hot, you cowardly mortals! Old Eve doesn&#x27;t care...&quot; Her letter column, which was answered in character, was called &quot;Witch&#x27;s Tales&quot;. She appeared as a principal character in stories in &quot;Secrets of Sinister House&quot; #9 and 11 and &quot;Weird Mystery Tales&quot; #18. In issue #9, she stays in an apartment building under an assumed name (she denies it is her in the letters column of issue #13), where the smell of her cooking causes her neighbor to report her to the superintendent, so she curses the neighbor to repeat a day – which begins wonderfully and ends in two deaths – over and over again.

Eve lives in a cave in the Dreaming and is often accompanied by Dream&#x27;s raven. The first raven, Lucien, taught her how to bury Abel after Cain murdered him and she has been accompanied by a raven ever since. She is kind and has a maternal nature, though she retains her sharp language. Most of the time she appears as a black-haired woman of indeterminate age, but sometimes appears as a young, attractive maiden, a middle-aged mother, or an elderly crone. When she is first seen in &quot;The Sandman&quot; #2, she looks a little different from her original appearances. Next, in issue #24, she has put on much weight, has a friendlier face and shows her ability to de-age as she embraces Matthew. Her largest appearance is in issue #40, wherein she appears young and beautiful for the first time.

An incarnation of Eve appears as a major character in &quot;Lucifer&quot; portrayed by Inbar Lavi, depicted as an antagonist and one of the love interests of the titular character. The original release described her as &quot;the original sinner herself&quot; and &quot;the first love&quot; of Lucifer. Lavi talked about her role as the character: &quot;I think personally the most interesting thing about Eve was the concept of sin and how she&#x27;s considered to be the original sinner. But I don&#x27;t really see it that way. Eve is brave enough to go after her curiosity and her passion and to me, that&#x27;s very courageous. I wasn&#x27;t playing her as someone who made a mistake. I was playing her as someone who is very curious and excited to learn&quot;.

==Reception and analysis==

Both Cain and Abel were listed by &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; as among the top 10 characters from the &quot;Sandman&quot; comics that were hoped to be seen in Netflix&#x27;s adaptation. Bibek Bhattacharya of &quot;Mint&quot; felt that the backstories of DC&#x27;s major Biblically adapted characters (Cain, Abel and Eve) from &quot;The Sandman&quot; were well-told, and opined that they were even more interesting than the original Biblical tales told in the Book of Genesis itself.

Within the comics, Abel is depicted as a more meek man who is commonly a victim of Cain’s murders in various gruesome ways, much like a recurring dark comedy trope. The theme was adapted from the original tale in Genesis 4. Abel is slain by Cain within the narrative by jealousy of the Hebrew God where he accepted Abel&#x27;s offering, but not Cain&#x27;s. In the Biblical narrative, Cain was the first murderer and Abel was the first murder victim, so it is the same within DC Comics stories. 

The relationship between Hilda Spellman and Zelda Spellman within &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot; has been compared to the dynamic of Gaiman&#x27;s portrayal of both Cain and Abel by writers such as Christian Holub of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and David Opie of &quot;Digital Spy&quot;.

<doc id="430216" wikidata="Q466204" url="?curid=430216" title="Faces of Death">
<text>Faces of Death (later re-released as The Original Faces of Death) is a 1978 American mondo horror film written and directed by John Alan Schwartz, credited under the pseudonyms &quot;Conan Le Cilaire&quot; and &quot;Alan Black&quot; respectively.

The film, presented as if it were an actual documentary, centers on pathologist Francis B. Gröss, played by actor Michael Carr, who presents the viewer with footage showing different gruesome ways of dying from a variety of sources. Many scenes were faked for the film, but most portions include pre-existing video footage of real deaths and its aftermath.

&quot;Faces of Death&quot; received generally negative reviews, but it was a huge success at the box office, reportedly grossing over $35 million worldwide. It gained a cult following and spawned several sequels, the first of which, &quot;Faces of Death II&quot;, was released in 1981.

==Plot==
After performing an open heart surgery, pathologist Francis B. Gröss tells the viewer that he is interested in the transitional periods of life and death thanks to a recurring dream. At the same time, his experience as a surgeon has desensitized him to grotesque deaths. He has compiled footage to understand the many &quot;faces of death.&quot;

Footage is played of various animal deaths, including a man killed by an alligator, which Gröss calls a &quot;violent retaliation from a creature who has suffered continued abuse from mankind&quot;. Gröss next narrates over recordings of assassinations, stating that humans are the only species to kill for greed. Assassin François Jordan is interviewed, admitting that he kills solely for payment, not political or social value. If there were a case on which he had thoughts, he would immediately but respectfully decline the missions. Gröss introduces another type of killer, &quot;the one who kills for no apparent reason.&quot; A gunfight ensues between a SWAT team and an armed murderer. During the gunfight, the SWAT team throws tear gas into the house of the murderer, who is later shot, after which the team enters the killer&#x27;s house to find his family stabbed to death; Gröss questions whether the man&#x27;s actions were caused by society. As criminal Larry DeSilva is executed by electric chair, Gröss questions &quot;if two wrongs make a right.&quot;

Gröss visits the Los Angeles County coroner&#x27;s office, where Dr. Thomas Noguchi is embalming multiple corpses after their autopsies. One cadaver is a horrifically bloated drowned woman; the other is a decapitated man whose skin is peeled off his skull for examination. Gröss asks Noguchi for his thoughts on his own embalming process after he dies, to which he replies: &quot;life is purely a transitory state&quot;.

One man, Samuel Berkowitz has his body subjected to cryopreservation after death; his bodily fluids are replaced with a liquid with a low freezing point, then he is stored in a freezer to preserve his body for future science to revive him. The &quot;theater of preservation&quot; transitions to a brief discussion on suicide with footage of a woman jumping from a building; Gröss admits this was &quot;a face of death he wishes never to face again.&quot;

The next segment displays war and atrocities in history, including the Holocaust. Footage of German forces slaughtering enemy forces is shown, as they were becoming more desperate in the latter years of the war. The segment ends with footage of Nazis being obliterated in battle and symbols of Nazism destroyed, with Gröss saying that Hitler &quot;lost control not only of his army but of his mind.&quot; 

Footage of animals dying due to litter and pollution is shown, followed by sick children in impoverished villages. Nature is examined with footage of a search party finding a body in caves, a drowned man recovered at a beach, and footage of a bear mauling irresponsible campers. More of the &quot;horrific nature of man&quot; is examined with footage of a venomous snake cult in Louisville, Kentucky, killing a handler and a cannibalistic cult eating a cadaver stolen from a morgue before partaking in an orgy.

Footage of several more tragic accidents is shown, culminating in a scene of a person attempting a parachute jump but dying after the parachute fails to open correctly. Gröss disputes the notion that this death was quick and painless, as he would have been conscious and aware of the entire fall to the ground. The segment ends with a section on PSA Flight 182 and its grisly aftermath, featuring photographs of the accident, excerpts of audio from air traffic control, and footage of scattered body parts and destroyed houses at the crash site. Gröss states that the neighborhood smells like &quot;rotting bodies and jet fuel&quot; and that a mutilated body with only its torso and right hand &quot;is the worst face of death.&quot;

Gröss introduces his next topic, the role of supernatural forces in death. He meets with architect Joseph Binder, whose wife and son both died under tragic circumstances. Binder confides to the viewer that he believes his family remains as ghosts in his house that attempt to communicate with him. To verify this, Gröss enlists the services of parapsychologists. The team takes photographs of footprints and two apparitions. Binder communicates with his family&#x27;s spirits through a medium, seemingly confirming the existence of life after death.

After studying Binder&#x27;s case, Gröss concludes that &quot;when we die, it isn&#x27;t the end&quot; as &quot;the soul in each of us remains a traveller forever.&quot; Gröss questions whether death is &quot;the end of the beginning or the beginning of the end&quot; and leaves the footage he has shown to the viewer&#x27;s interpretation. The film ends with peaceful music, footage of a baby&#x27;s birth, and photos of the child and its mother being together and happy.

==Cast==
* Michael Carr as Francis B. Gröss
* Samuel Berkowitz as Victim
* Mary Ellen Brighton as Suicide Victim
* Thomas Noguchi as Chief Medical Examiner Coroner
* John Alan Schwartz as Cult Leader
* Vern Stierman as Narrator

==Production==
The film was written and directed by John Alan Schwartz (credited as &quot;Alan Black&quot; for writing and as &quot;Conan LeCilaire&quot; for directing). Schwartz also took credit as second unit director, this time as &quot;Johnny Getyerkokov&quot;. He also appears in one of the segments of the film, as the leader of the alleged flesh eating cult in San Francisco and has brief appearances in several other movies of this series. Schwartz wanted to depict very real death with &quot;an analytical view, rather than a purely exploitive purpose&quot;, but the film&#x27;s inclusion of fake scenes have brought this to debate. The movie features Michael Carr as the narrator, and &#x27;creative consultant&#x27; called &quot;Dr. Francis B. Gröss&quot;, whose voice is reminiscent of Leonard Nimoy in the popular TV show &quot;In Search of...&quot; (which Schwartz worked on). Schwartz states that the movie&#x27;s budget was $450,000 and there are estimates that it has grossed more than $35 million worldwide in theatrical releases, not including rentals.

No real humans dying are featured graphically in the movie, although some from a distance and real human corpses appear in archival footage. Approximately 60% of the film was real footage bought from news stations, medical researchers, witnesses of the Flight 182 crash, graphic war footage, deleted footage from other documentaries, and/or filmed by the actual crew in morgues or on a beach.

Many sequences in the film were recreations of news footage; special effects artist Douglas White stated the producers watched hundreds of hours of news footage and studied crime scene photos to determine whether their effects looked realistic. Editor Glenn Turner stated the initial version of the movie consisted of gruesome newsreel footage bought and compiled, but the lack of narrative made it &quot;difficult to watch&quot;, leading to the decision to recreate some of the footage instead.

With the exception of the slaughterhouse sequence (which uses methods of killing that are long outdated), chicken beheading and African tribe sacrificing a cow, several scenes of animals were inauthentic: a seal clubbing which featured choreographed clubbing to avoid harming the seals, and a &quot;violent dog fight&quot; that was simply two dogs covered in theater blood playing with dramatic editing and music, whilst a scene showing a monkey being &quot;killed and having its brains eaten&quot; used cauliflower and theater blood for &quot;brains&quot;.

The electric chair execution was achieved by building a fake chair, using toothpaste to emulate saliva, and adding electricity sounds in post-production. Schwartz was inspired to make the scene after reading about electric execution in the southern USA, and was surprised to find it still in practice. He wanted to find a way to film a real chair execution, but none were available during production.

The only &quot;real, unscripted&quot; part of the film features a body of a dead surfer who had washed upon shore as filmmakers were filming B-roll of litter for the pollution sequence nearby and beachgoers started a commotion.

White and Allen Apone&#x27;s newly formed special effects company had been given no details about the film upon being hired; they conceived of the police shootout, the alligator attack, the monkey brain dinner, the decapitation sequence and the cannibalistic cult scene with Schwartz himself playing the leader.

The Morgue, suicide jumper, parachute jumper, snake cult, war and Holocaust footage, and some of the vehicular accidents were authentic. The snake cult footage was later used in Michael Bolton&#x27;s music video &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Crazy&quot;, without the handler dying of a snake bite. The World War 2 footage was also used, with the exception of the Holocaust &amp; graphic battle footage. In their book &quot;Killing for Culture&quot;, authors David Kerekes and David Slater note that the nadir of the movie is the inclusion of an extreme fatal accident; &quot;the shattered remains of a cyclist are seen under a semi-tractor trailer. The camera pans long enough to capture paramedics scooping up blood clots, brain matter and clumps of hair from the tarmac; this incident is authentic and culled from newsreels.&quot; The train derailment footage was authentic, but the grisly aftermath was faked.

The Flight 182 crash happened less than 2 months before the film&#x27;s release, and graphic footage depicting the crash aftermath, destroyed houses and scattered body parts were included in the film near the climax. Still images and air traffic audio were used to simulate the crash itself, because no actual footage is known to exist. According to Schwartz, the film was largely completed, but reworked immediately after the crash occurred.

One sequence involves cryogenic patient Samuel Berkowitz, who was frozen in July 1978 and stored in northern California. The relatives who were funding the suspension began to lose interest and wherewithal, and an offer was made to continue the suspension as a neuro (head-only) free of charge, but was turned down. Instead, in October 1983 they had Berkowitz thawed, submerged in formaldehyde, given a proper funeral and buried. No attempt was made to preserve the brain.

==Censorship==
Due to its graphic content, &quot;Faces of Death&quot; was banned and censored in many countries. The movie is often billed as &quot;Banned in 46 Countries&quot;, but this claim is doubtful. In the United Kingdom, the film was prosecuted and added to the &quot;video nasty&quot; list, as it was deemed to violate the Obscene Publications Act 1959. In 2003, the film was allowed to be released on DVD in the UK; however, cuts of 2 minutes and 19 seconds were required by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) to remove scenes of &quot;fighting dogs and [a] monkey being cruelly beaten to death in accordance with Cinematograph Films (Animals Act) 1937 and BBFC Guidelines.&quot; In 1980, &quot;Faces of Death&quot; was refused classification by the Australian Classification Board. Despite the ban, several bootleg VHS tapes were released in the country, and the film was unbanned and released uncut on DVD in 2007. However, its sequels remain banned in the country. The film was also banned in New Zealand in 1989. In Germany, the film was edited for a VHS release, with the removal of some graphic scenes. The ban in Germany was lifted in 2022.

==Reception==
The film was received relatively poorly by critics, both retrospective and contemporary. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that &quot;Faces of Death&quot; received a 27% critical approval rating of 11 surveyed critics; the average rating was 4.3/10. Writing for the &quot;Kansas City Kansan&quot;, reviewer Steve Crum denounced the film as &quot;crude, tasteless exploitation footage. Filmed carnage.&quot; He ended his review urging the viewer to &quot;be ashamed to watch this garbage.&quot;

Joshua Siebalt of Dread Central had mixed feelings about the film: &quot;as a curiosity piece, &quot;Faces of Death&quot; is well worth a look, especially if you&#x27;ve not seen it in a very long time. As for its place in horror cinema history, well, that remains to be seen. As I said it&#x27;s not a film that holds up very well at all, but considering how groundbreaking it was for its time, I doubt anyone will ever forget it. And while it is nice to have all of the myths about &quot;Faces&quot; finally addressed by the people who created it, it also takes some of the fun out if it, too.&quot;

Christopher Kulik of DVD Verdict wrote, &quot;The YouTube generation will be unable to comprehend what purpose the film served thirty years ago, and thus it&#x27;s difficult to ignore how hopelessly dated &quot;Faces of Death&quot; really is. In short, it&#x27;s a cinematic experiment which has long outlived its effects, although it remains compelling for film and horror buffs viewing the film in the proper perspective. For the curious virgins, I say give it a shot only if you can handle what has been described up until this point; if you can get through &quot;Faces of Death&quot;, then you can get through just about anything. Feel free to judge for yourself.&quot;

In his review, Screen Anarchy&#x27;s Ard Vijn was dismissive of the film, remarking that &quot;many of the segments have lost their ability to shock, or can easily be recognized as fake by today&#x27;s more media-savvy audience. Interesting as a curious bit of film history, but nothing more.&quot;

It was ranked #50 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s &quot;Top 50 Cult Films of All Time&quot; in 2003.

===Sequels===
A number of straight to video sequels were made, containing far more real footage, some containing only real footage. &quot;Faces of Death II&quot;, &quot;Faces of Death III&quot;, &quot;The Worst of the Faces of Death&quot;, and &quot;Faces of Death IV&quot;, as well as &quot;Faces of Death: Fact or Fiction?&quot; (a documentary on the making of the series) were written and at least partially directed by John Alan Schwartz.

Originally released in theaters on November 10, 1978, &quot;Faces of Death&quot; was released on VHS and Betamax in October 1983, although a heavily edited version (running at 73 minutes) was released in the United Kingdom by &quot;Atlantis Video Productions LTD&quot; in 1982, only to later get banned and placed on the &quot;video nasty&quot; list (as listed in the &quot;Censorship&quot; section).

Originally released in theaters in late 1981 (May 1981 in Japan), &quot;Faces of Death II&quot; was later released on VHS and Betamax on May 22, 1985. It contained real footage of a dead body being pulled from under a pier, Guerrilla death squads in El Salvador, napalm bombings in Vietnam, Buddhist self-immolations, the drugging of a monkey, a dolphin slaughter, a train disaster in India, Cambodian patients with leprosy, a death museum featuring Joaquin Murrieta&#x27;s preserved head, a driver high on PCP and a boxer going down for his &quot;final&quot; count. The gas station robbery is the only scene outside of the narration to have been faked. Much like the PSA Aircraft crash, the assassination attempt on US President Ronald Reagan occurred recently before the film&#x27;s completion, and was included as well.

&quot;Faces of Death III&quot; was released on VHS in mid-August 1986, with the earliest known date being August 20 (March 10, 1985 in Japan). It was originally planned to be released on November 1, 1985, but was withheld from purchase due to concerns of its content, and protests from a number of animal rights groups, in which resulted in &quot;National Video Inc.&quot; banning the first two movies from over 550 video rental stores. It featured real footage of the German Autobahn, drug smugglers getting blown away by the Coast Guard, a parachutist landing in a crocodile pit, a videotaped rape/murder (the killer being played by Schwartz), a car thief getting ripped apart by two junkyard dogs, and footage of the last public execution by guillotine in France featuring a very young Christopher Lee.

&quot;The Worst of the Faces of Death&quot; was released on VHS in the Fall of 1991 as a 60-minute compilation film featuring the &quot;worst&quot; of the previous three movies, which included some new footage as well. It was originally planned to be released on February 28, 1990, but would be delayed for unknown reasons. This compilation film was likely produced because of both the delay of &quot;Faces of Death IV&quot;, and because the original trilogy was briefly discontinued in 1987 by &quot;MPI Home video&quot; due to controversy surrounding the franchise until it was rereleased in the early 1990s by its spin-off company, &quot;Gorgon Video&quot;.

Originally released in America as a midnight showing as early as August 29, 1991, &quot;Faces of Death IV&quot; was later released on VHS around late 1991/early 1992 (November 28, 1990 in Germany). The film was originally produced in 1985, and was planned to be released in the Summer of 1987, but it would be delayed due to similar concerns that &quot;Faces of Death III&quot; had previously faced with their content, resulting in the previous movies being temporary discontinued from circulation (read &quot;The Worst of the Faces of Death&quot; section above). According to the copyright, the film was planned to be released in 1990, but was again delayed. The ending of the film features footage of the Symphony Orchestra Stage Collapse in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The narrator claims that it resulted in many deaths, where various shots of injured musicians, corpses and ripped limbs were shown over the end credits. However, when the footage was shown on other TV shows, such as &quot;Maximum Exposure&quot; and &quot;Stupid Behavior: Caught on Tape&quot;, it clarified that while 43 people were left injured, no one was killed by the collapse. Since the film was delayed for a few years due to the controversy, it was able to include the aforementioned stage collapse footage from March 1988.

&quot;Faces of Death: Fact or Fiction&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on September 28, 1999. Unlike the previous entries in the series, this film goes into debunking some of the well known scenes in the franchise, such as &quot;the leg amputation scenes and the infamous eating live-monkey-brains sequence...&quot;, explaining how the reenacted scenes were produced to look realistic. While the VHS release also included a &quot;Faces of Death&quot; music and &quot;Scenes From the Underground&quot; (a compilation short of shocking, explicit footage from the Gorgon Video vaults), the DVD release also included the VHS bonuses, and the entire first &quot;Faces of Death&quot; film.

The franchise would have various Friday/Saturday midnight showings throughout the 1990s, with the earliest known date being late-August 1991, and the last known showing being October 16, 1999.

===Additional &quot;sequels&quot;===
&quot;Faces of Death V&quot; and &quot;Faces of Death VI&quot; were released in the mid-90s, and are compilations made up entirely of highlights from the first four movies, with no new footage, intentionally released in countries where the original movies were banned. The first three featured Carr as &quot;Dr. Gröss&quot;, although &quot;The Worst of Faces of Death&quot; (released between installments &quot;III&quot; and &quot;IV&quot; and consisting of highlights from the first three installments) instead featured Schwartz&#x27;s brother, James Schwartz, as &quot;Dr. Louis Flellis&quot;. Flellis explains that he accidentally killed &quot;Dr. Gröss&quot; while operating on him the prior week. However, in &quot;Faces of Death IV&quot;, Flellis explains the absence of Dr. Gröss by stating that he had killed himself, having been driven insane as a result of witnessing so much death.

Also released with the title &quot;Faces of Death VII&quot;, was a condensed version of Anton LaVey&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;Death Scenes&quot;; and another assemblage of stock footage titled &quot;Faces of Death part 7&quot; was released as an online file sometime during the late 1990s.

&quot;Faces of Death 8&quot; followed soon after. Released only in Germany, and made by unknown individuals, it is a collection of mostly unrelated gore scenes from around the world, with no narration, and no on-screen credits, aside from its title.

===Reboot===

In May 2021, it was reported that Legendary Entertainment had purchased the rights to the film, and a remake was in development, with filmmakers Isa Mazzei and Daniel Goldhaber attached to direct. The film will star Barbie Ferreira and Dacre Montgomery. Josie Totah was later announced to have joined the cast with Ferreira and Montgomery, with filming starting April 2023. Singer Charli XCX also joined the cast in a small role. The reboot will be a narrative film, surrounding an online moderator finding obscene content.

==Legal cases==
In June 1985, mathematics teacher Bart Schwarz showed the film to his class at Escondido High School in Escondido, California. Two of his students, Diane Feese and Sherry Forget, claimed they were so traumatized by the film that they both &quot;developed an unnatural fear of dying and suffered emotional distress.&quot; The families of the two girls sued the school district and received a combined $100,000 settlement ($57,500 for Feese and $42,500 for Forget). Schwarz was suspended from the school for 15 days without pay, but was not fired.

In November 1986, 14-year-old Rod Matthews of Canton, Massachusetts bludgeoned his Canton High School classmate Shaun Ouilette to death with a baseball bat. Matthews claimed the idea to kill Ouilette was conceived after he viewed &quot;Faces of Death&quot;, as he was curious about what it would be like to kill someone. He had shown previous signs of mental illness. Matthews was sentenced to life in prison, with parole eligibility after 15 years. In November 2024, he was granted parole on his fifth appeal.

== Home media ==
&quot;Faces of Death&quot; and its sequels were released in boxset form on DVD by MPI Home Video in July 2002. Australian distributor Umbrella Entertainment released the film on DVD in 2007. In 2008, Gorgon Video released the movie on DVD and Blu-ray for its 30th anniversary. A brand new high definition transfer was made with new material and a 5.1 digital soundtrack. The company still offers VHS editions of the film, with the 1980s and 1990s box art. Due to its graphic content and legal difficulties, the film has never been broadcast on television, but was briefly available to stream on Tubi &amp; Shudder.

<doc id="430221" wikidata="Q315920" url="?curid=430221" title="Hasan al-Askari">
<text>Hasan ibn Ali ibn Muhammad (; ), better known as Hasan al-Askari (), was a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He is regarded as the eleventh of the Twelve Imams, succeeding his father, Ali al-Hadi. Hasan Al-Askari was born in Medina in 844 and brought with his father to the garrison town of Samarra in 848, where the Abbasid caliphs held them under close surveillance until their deaths, even though neither were politically active. After the death of al-Hadi in 868, the majority of his following acknowledged his son, al-Askari, as their next Imam. Al-Askari&#x27;s contact with the Shia population was restricted by the caliphs and instead he communicated with his followers through a network of representatives. He died in Samarra in 873–874 at the age of about twenty-eight and was buried in the family home next to his father, which later developed into al-Askari shrine, a major center for Shia pilgrimage. Shia sources commonly hold the Abbasids responsible for the death of al-Askari and his father. A well-known early Shia commentary of the Quran is attributed to al-Askari.

Al-Askari died without leaving an obvious heir, which created widespread confusion and fragmented the Shia community into several sects, all of which disappeared within a few decades except the Twelver Shia. The Twelvers hold that al-Askari had a son, commonly known as Muhammad al-Mahdi (), who was kept hidden from the public out of the fear of Abbasid persecution. Al-Mahdi succeeded to the imamate after the death of his father and entered a state of occultation. His life is said to be miraculously prolonged until the day he manifests himself again by God&#x27;s permission to fill the earth with justice. Though in occultation, the Imam still remains responsible in Twelver belief for the spiritual guidance of humankind and the Shia accounts of his occasional encounters with the pious are numerous and popular.

== Titles ==
Hasan ibn Ali is known by the titles al-Samet (), al-Hadi (), and al-Zaki (), though his most common title is al-Askari ()، on the account of his almost life-long detention in Samarra, a garrison town not far from Baghdad which was the capital of the Abbasids at the time. As a great-grandson of Ali al-Rida, the eighth of the Twelve Imams, Hasan was also known by his contemporaries as Ibn al-Rida (lit. &#x27;son of al-Rida&#x27;).
==Life==
===Birth and early life===
Most Shia sources state that Hasan ibn Ali was born in Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal 230 AH (November 844), though other given dates range from 845 to 847. The Shia currently celebrate 8 Rabi&#x27; al-Thani as his birthday. Hasan was born in Medina, though Donaldson has cast doubt on this, as he is uncertain between Medina and Samarra. His father was the tenth Shia Imam, Ali al-Hadi, and his mother was a freed slave (&quot;umm walad&quot;), whose name is variously given as Hudayth, Susan, or Salil in different sources. At the age of about two, Hasan was brought to Samarra with his father in 233 or 234 AH (847–849), where the latter was held under close surveillance by the Abbasid caliphs until his death in 254 (868), some twenty years later.

When Hasan was about twenty-two, an agent of his father is said to have providentially bought a Byzantine concubine, named Narjis (Narcissus), who was given to Hasan in marriage, and later bore him his only son. Other sources give her name variously as Sayqal, Sawsan, and Rayhana. The detailed accounts of Majlesi and Tusi describe Narjis as a captured granddaughter of the Byzantine emperor and a pious woman who was told in a dream about her future union with Hasan, though these accounts have been described as hagiographic. Some other accounts describe Narjis as Nubian.
===During the reign of Abbasids===
A significant part of al-Askari&#x27;s life, both during his own imamate and his father&#x27;s, was spent in a situation where the Abbasid Caliphate had become a tool for rival emirs who played an effective role in the government system. The hostile rivalries between the emirs of the Abbasid system had caused the caliphs to hold the caliphate for short periods, which had severely weakened the foundations of the caliphate.
====Reign of al-Mustain====
Perhaps the first recorded political stance in the life of al-Askari dates back to when he was about 20 years old and his father was still alive. In fact, it was in 252 AH, two years before he assumed the Imamate, that al-Askari reportedly wrote a letter, addressed to a Tahirid emir, Abu Ahmad Ubaydullah ibn Abdullah ibn Tahir, (the brother of Tahir ibn Abdallah, the emir of Khorasan) who was an opponent of al-Musta&#x27;in, in which he calls the caliph a &quot;tyrant&quot; and asks God to remove him. Shortly after, following a rebellion against Musta&#x27;in, he was deposed and al-Mu&#x27;tazz succeeded him as caliph. According to Ibn Athir, Abu Ahmad Tahiri himself played an important role in the rebellion against al-Musta&#x27;in and his killing.

==== Reigns of al-Mu&#x27;tazz () and al-Muhtadi () ====
In 252 AH, Musta&#x27;in was overthrown and his enemy, Mu&#x27;taz, assumed the caliphate. According to Pakatchi, given the animosity between Mu&#x27;taz and Musta&#x27;in, and the fact that Mu&#x27;taz&#x27;s powerful emirs, such as Abu Ahmad Taheri, had informed the new caliph of al-Askari&#x27;s hatred for the murdered caliph, Mu&#x27;taz would not have shown hostility towards him and his father at the beginning of his reign, at least on the surface. In 254 AH, when al-Hadi died and al-al-Askari succeeded his father, al-Askari enjoyed relative freedom and lived in his own home, despite the restrictions imposed on his activities.
Less than a year into his imamate, Pakatchi writes, the caliph became suspicious of the Imam. Al-Askari&#x27;s diligent efforts to maintain and reform the Shia financial system and collect funds, which began at the very beginning of his imamate, and his extensive correspondence with the Shias of various regions, and the influence he had even over some government officials such as Abu Ahmad Taheri, could have caused the caliph to worry.

In the second year of Askari&#x27;s imamate and the last year of Mu&#x27;taz&#x27;s caliphate, i.e. 255 AH, al-Askari was imprisoned by al-Mu&#x27;tazz in Baghdad, and he was kept in prison through the short reign of al-Muhtadi, the next caliph.
During the reign of Mu&#x27;taz and before his death, some plots to assassinate Askari apparently failed.
Shortly after, Mu&#x27;taz died, and the short period of Muhtadi&#x27;s caliphate was marked by conflict between the rulers. Although Muhtadi had Mu&#x27;tazilite leanings, this did not prevent the caliph from persecuting Askari, since Salih ibn Wasif, who was the most powerful emir in the court of the previous caliph, still had so much authority that the caliph could not oppose his decisions.
In the last period of the Caliphate of al-Muhtadi, the Caliph adopted a strict policy towards the Shias, intending to drive them away from the important centers of Iraq; the pressure on the Shia prisoners also increased, and it was at this time that a certain emir named Nasr ibn Ahmad al-Zubairi agreed to carry out the Caliph&#x27;s intention to kill al-Askari, but this decision coincided with the collapse of al-Muhtadi government. Nasr ibn Ahmad al-Zubairi was forced to go to war, according to al-Tabari, in which he was killed on the first of Rajab 256 AH. This event was considered by al-Askari as a sign of God&#x27;s power. Al-Muhtadi himself was deposed from the Caliphate on the 29th of Rajab following a widespread rebellion, and his death occurred shortly thereafter.

==== Reign of al-Mu&#x27;tamid () ====
The persecution of the Shia continued under al-Mu&#x27;tamid, a son of al-Mutawakkil. It is believed that most of al-Askari&#x27;s prison experiences happened during the caliphate of al-Mu&#x27;tamid, who is represented in Shia sources as his main oppressor. Al-Mu&#x27;tamid ruled for thirteen years (256-279 AH), but only four years of this reign coincided with the life of al-Askari. The reign of al-Muttamid coincided with the revolts of the Alawites and individuals associated with them. Sahib al-Zanj, claiming Alawi descent, was the most important threat to al-Muttamid&#x27;s rule. Zanj&#x27;s violent and reckless actions were worrying even for the Imamiyyah leadership. Al-Askari clearly declared that &quot;Sahib al-Zanj is not from us, the Ahl al-Bayt&quot;. The purpose of this stance, according to Pakatchi, was, on the one hand, to prevent the general public from attributing the misconduct of Sahib al-Zanj to the Imamiyya and the Ahl al-Bayt, and another purpose was to prevent the Abbasid government from increasing its strictness against the Shiites, relying on the uprising of Sahib al-Zanj.
However, in 260, al-Mu&#x27;tamid, who had freed Askari at the beginning of his reign, ordered Askari and his brother Ja&#x27;far to be arrested and taken to prison. Although after a month the caliph was forced to release them, probably for the sake of state interests, but he did not allow him to return to his home in Samarra, instead sent him to &quot;Dar al-Hasan ibn Sahl&quot; to keep a close eye on him. Shortly afterwards, news of his death was circulated.

Al-Askari is said to have criticized the caliph for restricting the administration of Khums (), the Islamic alms distributed among the descendants of the prophet, who were forbidden from receiving general alms in the prophet&#x27;s lifetime. In his lifetime, a main source of assistance for the poor in his clan, the Banu Hashim, was the income of agricultural lands in Fadak. Historically, Abu Bakr, the first Rashidun caliph, discontinued the prophet&#x27;s policies and, in particular, reappropriated Fadak as public property, forcing Banu Hashim to rely on general alms, possibly to undermine their claims to the caliphate and cut their privileges as the prophet&#x27;s kins. This policy was partially reversed by his successor, Umar, and then by the Umayyad Umar II, though later caliphs again appended Fadak to the state treasury.

==Death==
At the age of about twenty-eight, al-Askari died on 1 or 8 Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal 260 AH (25 December 873 or 1 January 874) after a week-long illness. The Shia currently commemorate 8 Rabi&#x27; al-Awwal for this occasion. Shia sources commonly attribute his death to poisoning at the instigation of al-Mu&#x27;tamid. During the week of his illness, many notable Alid and Abbasid figures visited him on his deathbed and the caliph also sent his doctors and servants to attend the Imam. However, considering that al-Askari did not have an obvious heir, Tabatabai maintains that the caliph intended to closely monitor the Imam and later continued to search for his offspring after his death. Hussain, Amir-Moezzi, and Sachedina present similar accounts.

Al-Askari was buried in the family home, next to his father, Ali al-Hadi. The house was later expanded to a major shrine by various Shia and Sunni patrons. More recently, Naser al-Din Shah Qajar ordered to rebuild the complex in 1868-9 and the golden dome was added in 1905. The shrine also houses the tomb of his aunt, Hakima Khatun. As an important destination for Shia pilgrimage, the shrine was bombed in February 2006 and badly damaged. Another attack was executed on 13 June 2007, which led to the destruction of the two minarets of the shrine. Authorities in Iraq hold al-Qaeda responsible for this attack.

==Imamate==
=== Designation as the Imam ===
After the death of al-Hadi in 868, the majority of his followers acknowledged his son, Hasan al-Askari, as their next Imam. Shia sources report that al-Hadi designated Hasan as the next Imam a few months before his death. After al-Hadi, his another son, Ja&#x27;far, unsuccessfully claimed the imamate for himself. Madelung adds that some had expected another son of al-Hadi, Abu Ja&#x27;far Moḥammad, to be the next Imam but he predeceased his father in Samarra.
===Network of representatives===
The imamate of al-Askari began in 868 and lasted only about six years, overlapping with the caliphates of the Abbasid al-Mu&#x27;tazz, al-Muhtadi, and al-Mu&#x27;tamid. During these years, though not politically active, al-Askari mostly lived under house arrest in Samarra, subject to constant surveillance. Tabatabai and Sachedina write that al-Askari was not allowed any social contact with the general Shia population. Tabatabai also suggests that these restrictions were placed on al-Askari because the caliphate had come to know about the traditions, circulating among the Shia elite, which predicted that the eleventh Imam would father the eschatological Mahdi.
Al-Askari therefore communicated with his followers mostly through a network of representatives, notably Uthman ibn Sa&#x27;id.
The representatives were responsible for administering Shia affairs and collecting religious funds, although agents such as Ibrahim ibn Hilal Abartai had deviated from the Imam&#x27;s command, and for this reason, al-Askari had written a letter, disowning him, and cursing him.

The use of these representatives was a step towards establishing the tradition of the abwāb (gates), according to Pakatchi. Other than Uthman ibn Saeed, Aqid, a special servant of the Imam that raised him from childhood, was the bearer of many of his letters to the Shias. And a person with the nickname Gharib Abu al-Adian, who was also the Imam&#x27;s servant, was responsible for sending some letters. 
A group that was the forerunner of the Nusayriyyah has introduced Muhammad ibn Nusayr as his Bab.
Upon entering the period of the Minor Occultation, Uthman ibn Saeed, played the role of the first representative, and special deputy of the tewlve Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi.

===Ghulat===
Small groups of (), mostly formed earlier, continued their activities in the lifetime of al-Askari. They often conferred divinity on the Shia Imams and included the Namiriya, who followed Mohammad ibn Nosayr Namiri in Kufa, and the Eshaqiya, the adherents of Eshaq ibn Moḥammad Nakha&#x27;i Basri in Basra, Baghdad, and Mada&#x27;in.

===Succession===

As the eleventh Shia Imam, al-Askari died in 873-874 without leaving an obvious heir, which created widespread confusion () and fragmented the Shia community into up to twenty sects. All these sects, however, disappeared within a hundred years except the Twelver Shia. Some of them held that the imamate ceased with al-Askari and the Waqifiyya maintained that he would later emerge as the eschatological Mahdi. Others concluded that Muhammad ibn al-Hadi, a deceased brother of al-Askari, must have been the true Imam. Yet others accepted the imamate of Ja&#x27;far ibn al-Hadi, another brother of al-Askari, who had earlier unsuccessfully claimed the imamate for himself after the death of their father, al-Hadi. Some believed that the twelfth Imam would be born in the end of times to a descendant of al-Askari.

=== Occultation ===
The group that went on to become the Twelvers largely held that al-Askari had a son, named Abu al-Qasim Muhammad, same name as the prophet. Born around 255 (868), he is also known as Muhammad al-Mahdi (). Out of the fear of Abbasid persecution, Muhammad was kept hidden from the public and his existence was only known to a few trusted associates of the eleventh Imam. After the death of his father, Muhammad is said to have made his only public appearance to lead the funeral prayers for his father instead of his uncle, Ja&#x27;far. He was not seen publicly afterwards and entered a state of occultation for the fear of persecution. This is said to have happened in the family home in Samarra, where currently a mosque stands, under which there is a cellar () that hides a well (Bi&#x27;r al-Ghayba, ), into which al-Mahdi is said to have disappeared. 

Immediately after the death of al-Askari, his main representative (), Uthman al-Amri, claimed to be the Bab () to the hidden al-Mahdi. This was likely not a radical change for the Shia. Indeed, the tenth and eleventh Imams were also effectively in occultation for the majority of the Shia, as both Imams were held nearly isolated and under close surveillance by the Abbasid caliphs in Samarra. Uthman received petitions and made available their responses, sometimes in writing. According to Daftary, these responses were in Uthman&#x27;s handwriting, whereas Hussain holds that the handwriting and style did not change even after Uthman&#x27;s death, suggesting that the responses were written by al-Mahdi. This consistency, according to Hussain, partially explains the consensus of his followers on when the Major Occultation began.

Uthman later introduced his son, Abu Ja&#x27;far Muhammad ibn Uthman, as the next representative of al-Mahdi. In turn, he nominated Abu al-Qasim al-Husayn ibn Ruh al-Nawbakhti as the next representative. After about seventy years, this period of Minor Occultation () ended with the death of the fourth representative, Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad al-Samarri, who is said to have received a letter from al-Mahdi in 329 (941). The letter predicted the death of Abu al-Hasan in six days and announced the beginning of the Major Occultation () which, the letter stated, would continue until God grants permission to al-Mahdi to manifest himself again in a time when the earth would be filled with tyranny. It has been noted that the number of these agents was not limited to four in early Shia sources, and Momen suggests that the former network of the representatives () likely continued to operate during the Lesser Occultation.

=== Twelver doctrine of occultation ===
The Twelver doctrine of occultation () crystallized in the first half of the fourth (tenth) century. In its simplest form, this doctrine states that Muhammad al-Mahdi, the twelfth Imam, did not die but has been concealed by God from the mankind and his life has been miraculously prolonged until the day he manifests himself again by God&#x27;s permission to fill the earth with justice. This occultation continues until the life of Imam is not threatened by enemies, and until the humankind is ready to receive his guidance. During the Minor Occultation, he remained in contact with his followers through the four Babs (gates). During the Major Occultation, which started in 329 (941) and continues to this day, there is no direct communication, though the Imam still remains responsible in Shia belief for the spiritual guidance of humankind, as the sun behind a cloud still gives light and warmth. It also is believed that al-Mahdi occasionally appears to the pious in person or more commonly in dreams and visions. The accounts of these encounters are popular among the Shia. The Shia literature about the doctrine of occultation is extensive, based both on rational and textual arguments. One such instance is a famous hadith attributed to the prophet by both Shia and Sunni authorities. This hadith states that, &quot;If the earth had only one day of existence left to it, God would prolong that day until a man of my posterity, whose name will be my name, and his surname my surname, manifests himself; he will fill the earth, filled till then with violence and oppression, with harmony and justice.&quot;

==Contributions==
=== Contributions to Quranic exegesis===
Interpretation of Quranic verses is one of the areas that has been the focus of Hassan Askari&#x27;s efforts. Tafsir &quot;In the name of Allah,the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful&quot; (Ibn Sha&#x27;ba, 487; Masoudi, 264), Tafsir &quot;Thee we worship and Thee we ask for help.&quot; (Al-Fatiha / 1 / 5; See: Waram, 2 / 95), Tafsir &quot;And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam...&quot; (Al-A&#x27;raf / 7 / 172; see: Masoudi, 264), the interpretation of &quot;Allah eliminates what He wills or confirms, and with Him is the Mother of the Book.&quot; (Ar-Ra&#x27;d/ 13 /39 ; see: ibid.; also Tusi, al-Ghaiba, 430-431; Rawandi, al-Kharaij, 2 / 688; Ibn Hamzah, 567), the interpretation of &quot;O my father, why do you worship ...&quot; (Maryam / 19 / 42; See: Qumi, 2/51) and the interpretation of &quot;To Allah belongs the command before and after&quot; (Ar-Rum/ 30 / 4; see: Ibn Shahr Ashub, 3 / 535) are among them.

In addition to these, a well-known early Shia commentary of the Quran is attributed to al-Askari, which is believed to be authentic by some Shia authorities, notably, al-Mufid.
Even if the attribution is not correct, Pakatchi believes that al-Askari&#x27;s fame for interpretative discussions has provided the basis for this attribution. Meanwhile, some critics have doubted the attribution of the entire text to al-Askari, and have accepted the principle that some of the contents of the book may have come from the Imam.

The issue of the opposition between reason(Aql) and ignorance(Jahl) and their armies, which was previously raised by Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq and Musa al-Kazim, has found a new dimension in the teachings of al-Askari. According to al-Askari, it is the wise person who is the addressee of divine commands and words, and God has not made anyone but the wise person His addressee. Just as the beauty of the face causes external beauty, the beauty of the intellect also causes internal beauty. Ignorance is the enemy of man and always increases the suffering of the ignorant. In the teachings of al-Askari, ignorance is not something that can be removed by education and training, and the effort to educate the ignorant is like a miracle. With this understanding of the concept of reason, there is a clear contradiction between the possession of wisdom and the pursuit of the world, and it is on this basis that al-Askari says in a phrase: &quot;If the people of the world were wise, the world [would be ignored and] destroyed.&quot;
====Ilm and Ibadah====
Al-Askari considered the purpose of human creation to be two things: knowledge (Ilm (Arabic)) and worship (Ibadah). Regarding the relationship between Ilm and Ibadah, al-Askari does not consider worship to be a lot of fasting and prayer, but rather considers the indicator of worship to be a lot of thinking about divine matters.

Like the relationship between thinking and worship, in the words of al-Askari, any kind of fulfillment of the right to God is not achievable except through knowledge and understanding; for example, in a saying of al-Askari, it is stated that &quot;no one recognizes a blessing except the one who is grateful, and no one is grateful for a blessing except the one who has knowledge&quot;. Recognizing all blessings is something that is considered among the characteristics of the Ahl al-Bayt in the words of al-Askari, and the Imam has also called the believers to knowledge and insight into divine blessings. 
With the condition of knowledge, according to al-Askari, there is no blessing, no matter how great, that the grateful person cannot express gratitude for. 

Other than reason as a path to knowledge, one of the most important ways to knowledge is the verses of the Quran and the Prophetic hadiths, in the words of al-Askari. According to Pakatchi, many of the contents of al-Askari&#x27;s words are a literal translation of Quranic contents.

===Contributions to jurisprudence===
According to Shia scholars of hadith, one of the epithets by which al-Askari is referred to in hadiths is the title of Faqīh(Islamic jurist or expert in &quot;fiqh&quot;) which shows that during the life, he was specifically known by his companions with this title.

In the Hadiths of al-Askari, attention has been paid to the reasons for some divine rulings, including the reason for the creation of man, the reason for naming Fatima, Zahra, the causal relationship between a child&#x27;s disobedience to parents in childhood and disowned by parents in adulthood, the causal relationship between committing a sin and suffering poverty, and the causal relationship between lying and other sins. On this basis, when it came to jurisprudential issues, the evolutionary and not legislative reasons for the rulings were sought; such as that God made fasting obligatory so that the rich could taste hunger and show kindness to the needy, or that God made obligatory the prayers not because of need but as a mercy to His servants, to separate the impure from the pure, to test the breasts and purify the hearts, and to create competition in attaining divine mercy and competing to occupy higher positions in Paradise.
===Contribution to ethics===
====Fear and hope====
One of the characteristics of the moral school of the Ahl al-Bayt was generally a tendency to balance fear and hope.
For example, in a hadith from al-Askari, emphasis has been placed on having good suspicion of God and in relation to fear, in another hadith, belittling sin has been severely criticized: &quot;Among the sins that are not forgivable is that a person thinks about a sin and wishes that he were not held accountable except for it.&quot;
Regarding the function of fear and hope, al-askari has said: &quot;I do not know what the meaning of a man&#x27;s fear and hope is, until these two do not prevent him from committing the lusts presented to him and do not give him patience to face the calamity that has befallen him.&quot;

====Piety====
While recommending piety, al-Askari also explained the misunderstandings related to it and what piety is, such as the saying that the most pious of people is the one who stops when faced with misgiving (doubt).
Along with piety, other terms such as asceticism (Zuhd) and servitude (Ta&#x27;abbud) were also mentioned in al-Askari&#x27;s words, brief definitions of each of them are given; for example, it is stated that the most pious of people is the one who abandons the forbidden; and the most devout person is the one who fulfills his obligations. In al-Askari&#x27;s hadiths, Sufism is also discussed on occasions, and in a mild and at the same time critical tone, a &quot;fake Sufi&quot; is condemned.

In line with the definition that asceticism had in al-Askari&#x27;s moral teachings, some sins, foremost of which is lying, are forbidden in his hadiths as the mother of corruption; Sins such as lying and betrayal both disrupt social relations and cause a person&#x27;s moral decline. Regarding lying, it is stated in a quote from al-Askari that God has placed all evils in a house, and has placed the key to that house in lies. That is why al-Askari, in the general instructions he presents for moral reform, has combined piety in religion and truthfulness in speech. Another sin that al-Askari has strictly prohibited is betrayal of trust, and it is clear from al-Askari&#x27;s teaching that it does not matter to what extent the giver of the trust is approved by the receiver in terms of religion or character, the principle is that the trust must be returned to the one who is entrusted (An-Nisa 4:58) and no betrayal of trust is acceptable. In his famous will addressed to the Shias, al-Askari instructed them to &quot;fulfill the trust of anyone they have entrusted to them, whether they are good or evil.&quot; In the continuation of this will, he equated trustworthiness with piety and truthfulness as principles governing the moral conduct of believers.
====Tawakkul====
To determine a general framework for the moral teachings of al-Askari, Pakatchi considers this framework to be a combination of two policies: To the extent that is beyond the scope of human management, the proposed policy is Tawakkul (&quot;to put trust&quot; or &quot;to rely&quot;), and to the extent that can be managed by humans, the proposed policy is moderation.
In a quotation inspired by the Quran, al-Askari says that Whoever receives good, God has given him and whoever is kept away from evil, God has protected him.
He also says: &quot;There is no calamity except that God has a blessing in it that encompasses that calamity&quot;. And man has an active role in al-Askari&#x27;s doctrine of Tawakkul. In a saying of al-Askari, it is stated: &quot;No one who is dear abandons the truth except that he is humiliated, and no humiliation is committed to the truth except that he is made dear.&quot;
In various sayings of al-Askari, it is emphasized that no greedy person will achieve what is not destined for him ; When what is destined is certain to happen, then why should there be humiliation and lamentation? in the same time al-Askari emphasizes that a person&#x27;s guaranteed sustenance from God should not prevent him from fulfilling his obligations.

====Moderation====
As far as the sphere of human management of one&#x27;s character and behavior is concerned, the call for moderation is seen in the teachings of al-Askari. Even in worship, while the Imam has advised his Shiites to worship a lot and prostrate for a long time, he forbids excess and reminds them that the limit of commitment is to perform the obligatory duties. In this regard, obsession in religious matters has been criticized, and in a speech, the Imam has considered the one who transgresses in his purity as someone who has violated his purity. Moderation is also recommended in social relations, and, among other things, he has been advised to refrain from excessive joking and laughing. In a response to Muhammad ibn Hamza al-Suri, the Imam called upon him to be moderate in his livelihood and avoid extravagance, and reminded him that extravagance is the work of Satan.
However, the culmination of discussions on moderation is seen in a famous hadith of the Imam in which he considered a set of morally commendable qualities in the context of moderation; a hadith that says: &quot;Modesty has a limit, and if it exceeds it, it is weakness; generosity has a limit, and if it exceeds it, it is extravagance; caution has a limit, and if it exceeds it, it is cowardice; thrift has a limit, and if it exceeds it, it is stinginess; and courage has a limit, and if it exceeds it, it is recklessness.&quot;

====Sociability and good manners====
Humility in Askari&#x27;s words is known as the secret of ethical conduct in dealing with people and is introduced as a blessing that no one will ever envy.
In Askari&#x27;s words, greeting anyone who passes by and sitting in a gathering without paying attention to the honor of one&#x27;s position are examples of humility. Also, seeking superiority and leadership over others are considered factors that lead to destruction. 
Also in al-Askari&#x27;s words, anger is the key to all evil; resentment deprives one of comfort, and the least comfortable people are those who harbor resentment; the worst person is the hypocrite and backbiter who envies another if he receives a blessing and despises him if a calamity befalls him. What breaks a person&#x27;s back is a neighbor who, if he sees a good deed, hides it and if he sees a sin, exposes it; And he who does not fear people&#x27;s honor is far from fearing God.
Likewise, patience is part of wisdom, and he whose patience does not allow him to swallow the drops of anger does not know peace of heart; the best of brothers is the one who forgets his brother&#x27;s mistakes; and good behavior and good character towards people are among the signs of a true believer.
In the teachings of the Imam, seclusion and isolation are not recommended, and the Shias are even called to extensive interaction with those who oppose them in religion; in a speech, the Imam, while referring to the tradition left by the previous Imams, advises the Shias to pray with them, attend their funerals, visit their sick, and fulfill their rights. In another hadith, the Imam advised the Shias to be good neighbors and to take care of their neighbors&#x27; affairs - regardless of their religion.
One should not honor and favor a person with a means or behavior that causes him hardship; it is far from politeness for a person to express happiness in front of someone who is sad; the most deserving of love is the one who has been bored by others; silence is commendable in many situations, the heart of a fool is in his mouth and the mouth of a wise man is in his heart.
It is also from al-Askari who says: &quot;It is enough for a person to discipline himself that he avoids whatever he dislikes in others.&quot;

===Else===
In the context of Shia responsibilities in the absence of Imams, a hadith ascribed to al-Askari is given by Mavani. The hadith states that, &quot;It is obligatory for the populace to follow the jurist who refrains from committing wrong, mentions his faith, opposes carnal desire, and obeys Allah’s command.&quot;

Haider quotes a hadith, attributed to al-Askari, about the specific characteristics that distinguish a Shia from the wider mass of Muslims: &quot;There are five signs of a believer: fifty-one cycles of prayer [every day], the pilgrimage to Husayn&#x27;s tomb forty days after the anniversary of his death, the wearing of a ring on the right hand, the placing of the forehead on the earth in prostration, and the audible recitation of the () [during daily prayers].&quot; 

In the context of intercession (), al-Askari is reported to have said that only a small fraction of God&#x27;s mercy () has been dispersed among His creation in this world. All of God&#x27;s mercy will be diffused on the Day of Judgement by means of which true Muslims will successfully intercede on behalf of their communities.

==Companions and disciples==
Among the companions and disciples of al-Askari that Shaykh Tusi and Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Barqi listed in their Rijali books are the names of Abd al-Azim al-Hasani, Saad ibn Abdullah al-Ash&#x27;ari Qummi, Abdullah ibn Ja&#x27;far al-Humairi, Muhammad ibn Husayn ibn Abi al-Khattab Kufi, Abu Hashim Dawood ibn Qasim Ja&#x27;fari, Muhammad ibn Salih al-Armani, Harun ibn Muslim the scribe, Ahmad ibn Ishaq Ash&#x27;ari Qomi, Sahl ibn Ziyad al-Adi, Dawood ibn Amir al-Ash&#x27;ari Qummi, Muhammad ibn Isa Yaqtini, Muhammad ibn Ali Tustri, Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Siyari, Ali ibn Muhammad al-Sayyari, Ismail ibn Ishaq Nishaburi, Ibrahim ibn Abd al-Nishaburi, Abu Ali Ahmad ibn Hammad Mahmudi, Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Faris Nishaburi, Ahmad ibn Idris Qummi, and Husayn ibn Ashkib al-Marwazi. Al-Fadl ibn Shadhan, Abu Sahl Isma&#x27;il ibn Ali al-Nawbakhti, Uthman ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Asadi are also among his companions.

Some of Askari&#x27;s students had asked him questions on various religious issues, including beliefs and jurisprudence, and had compiled a collection of their questions and answers with the Imam in the form of a book, a copy of which does not exist today, but its information can be searched in early Imami indexes. Among these are the &quot;al-Masael and tawqiaat&quot; of Abdullah ibn Ja&#x27;far al-Humairi (Najashi, 220), the &quot;al-Masael&quot; (lit. questions) of Abu Tahir Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Zarari (ibd, 347), &quot;al-Masael&quot; of Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Isa Qummi (ibd, 371), and &quot;al-Masael&quot; of Muhammad ibn Hassan Saffar Qummi (Tusi, al-Fihrist, 144).
Also &quot;Day and night&quot; (یوم و لیله), a book by Al-Fadl ibn Shadhan, which was a jurisprudential text regarding religious practices day and night, is said to have reached the opinion of Hasan al-Askari and was approved by him.

<text>Edward Nicolae Luttwak (born 4 November 1942) is an American author known for his works on grand strategy, military strategy, geoeconomics, military history, and international relations. He is best known for being the author of &quot;Coup d&#x27;État: A Practical Handbook&quot;. His book &quot;Strategy: The Logic of War and Peace&quot;, also published in Chinese, Russian and ten other languages, is widely used at war colleges around the world. His books are currently published in 29 languages besides English.

==Early life==
Luttwak was born into a Jewish family in Arad, Romania that fled Soviet occupation after World War II. He was thereafter raised in Italy and England.

==Career==
After attending a boarding school in Berkshire, where he joined the British Army cadet corps, Luttwak moved to London at the age of 16 and went to a grammar school. He then studied analytical economics at the London School of Economics. In 1968, when he was 26 and working in London as a consultant for the oil industry, he published the book &quot;Coup d&#x27;État: A Practical Handbook&quot;, a pastiche of a military manual. The book explains in detail how to overthrow the government of a state, looking in particular at coups d&#x27;état on the African continent and in the Middle East. The spy fiction author John le Carré praised the book and compared Luttwak to Machiavelli. Luttwak graduated from the London School of Economics in 1969.

Luttwak was a war volunteer in Israel in 1967 and later worked for the Israel Defense Forces. In 1972 he moved to the United States for graduate studies at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). He graduated with a PhD in International Relations in 1975. The title of his dissertation was &quot;Force and Diplomacy in Roman Strategies of Imperial Security&quot;. Earlier, during a two-month visit to Washington, D.C. in 1969, Luttwak and Richard Perle, his former roommate in London, joined a thinktank, the Committee to Maintain a Prudent Defence Policy, assembled by Dean Acheson and Paul Nitze to lobby Congress for anti-ballistic missile systems.

In late 1974 and into 1975 a series of articles was published by neoconservative intellectuals discussing whether the US military should seize the oilfields in Saudi Arabia. In March 1975, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; published an article that Luttwak had written under the pseudonym &quot;Miles Ignotus&quot; with the title &quot;Seizing Arab Oil&quot;. Luttwak had previously published the gist of his argument on how to break Arab power under the title &quot;Obsolescent Elites&quot;, using his real name, in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. He suggested that U.S. Marines, assisted by the 82nd Airborne Division, should storm the eastern beaches of Saudi Arabia. The article and the author attracted considerable attention, but there is no evidence that the Ford administration ever considered such an intervention. James Akins, then U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, publicly denounced the &quot;invasion scenario&quot; as a product of &quot;sick minds&quot;. In 2004 Luttwak told the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; that he had written the article &quot;after discussion with several like-minded consultants and officials in the Pentagon&quot;.

In 1976 Luttwak published &quot;The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire from the First Century AD to the Third&quot;, which generated controversy among professional historians who saw Luttwak as an outsider and a non-specialist in the field. However, the book is recognized as seminal because it raised basic questions about the Roman Army and its defense of the Roman frontier. Kimberly Kagan, writing in the &quot;Journal of Military History&quot;, states &quot;Ancient historians have demonstrated that Edward Luttwak&#x27;s The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire does not accurately describe Roman grand strategy, and many conclude that there was no Roman imperial grand strategy.&quot; Tanner Greer writes &quot;So conclusively wrong is this book that I do not think it should be included on any syllabus. Since Luttwak published that book in 1976, a dozen studies of Roman frontier deployments, Roman strategic culture, and Roman decision making have been published. All offer a steady refutation of Luttwak’s work. However, not one of those books or articles would have been written without Luttwak’s work. Luttwak was wrong in every particular except the questions he asked—but those questions were good enough to create an entire subfield of research.&quot;

Later Luttwak started researching the Byzantine empire, beginning with its earliest surviving texts. According to Harry Sidebottom, the majority of scholars were hostile to Luttwak&#x27;s enthusiasm for fighting wars on client state territory and the book made uncomfortable reading in some circles in western Europe because in the 1980s Luttwak became a security consultant to U.S. President Ronald Reagan.

In 1987 Luttwak published &quot;Strategy: The Logic of War and Peace&quot;. According to Luttwak&#x27;s publisher, Harvard University Press, the book has been widely acclaimed. Luttwak became known for his innovative ideas. He suggested, for example, that attempts by major powers to quell regional wars actually make conflicts more protracted.

Luttwak went on to provide consulting services to multinational corporations and government agencies, including various branches of the U.S. government and the U.S. military.

Luttwak has served on the editorial boards of &quot;Géopolitique&quot; (France), the &quot;Journal of Strategic Studies&quot;, &quot;The European Journal of International Affairs&quot;, and the &quot;Washington Quarterly&quot;. He speaks English, French, Hebrew, Italian, and Spanish, in addition to his native Romanian. In 1997, with three partners, he purchased 19,000 hectares of land in the Bolivian Amazon, where he set up a cattle ranch.

Luttwak was a lecturer in economics at the University of Bath from 1964 to 1966. In 2004 Luttwak was awarded an honorary doctorate degree (LLD) from the University of Bath. He has also received honorary degrees from a university in Arad, Romania and another from Timisoara&#x27;s University as well as the University of Bucharest. His book &quot;The Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire&quot; was published in late 2009.

Leon Wieseltier, who got to know Luttwak during the Reagan years, wrote: &quot;Edward was this figure out of a Werner Herzog film. He was not some person who had read a bit of Tacitus and now worked at the Pentagon. He knew all the languages, the geographies, the cultures, the histories. He is the most bizarre humanist I have ever met.&quot; Luttwak has said that he has used Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s film &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; to train men to fight in war, including villagers in El Salvador.
==Predictions==
Before the first Persian Gulf War Luttwak incorrectly predicted that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would evacuate Kuwait &quot;after a week or two of bombing [the bombing continued for six weeks without inducing him to do so] and warned that the use of ground forces without heavy preliminary bombing &#x27;could make Desert Storm a bloody, grinding combat with thousands of (US) casualties.&#x27;&quot; Writing a month into the bombing, Luttwak still opposed a ground campaign. He forecast that it would lead inevitably to a military occupation of Iraq from which the United States would be unable to disengage without disastrous foreign policy consequences.

In the 1999 book &quot;Turbo-Capitalism: Winners and Losers in the Global Economy&quot; Luttwak predicted that dynamic economic growth would increase ugly social phenomena such as higher crime rates and job insecurity, as anticipated in his &quot;London Review of Books&quot; article &quot;Why Fascism is the Wave of the Future&quot;. &quot;New York Magazine&quot; described Luttwak&#x27;s article as forecasting the rise of Donald Trump to the American presidency, citing his article&#x27;s predictions about a political vacuum emerging from the neglect of workers from political party establishments.

In 2009, Richard Posner analyzed intellectuals with a public profile in the U.S. Posner claimed that Luttwak sees many affinities between the United States and the declining Roman Empire, leading Luttwak to predict a dark age in which the U.S. population will experience decline into third world status. According to Posner, Luttwak retained his economic pessimism when the economy of the United States stood at the turn of the century.

In 2015, Luttwak predicted that the Middle East will be embroiled in internecine war for the next thousand years, thanks to the &quot;brilliant stroke&quot; of strategic genius, far exceeding even Bismarck&#x27;s abilities, exemplified by George W. Bush when he ignited a religious war between Sunnis and Shiites.

Luttwak predicted in a 2016 op-ed in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that the Trump administration would pursue a foreign policy &quot;unlikely to deviate from standard conservative norms&quot;, withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, avoiding involvement in Syria and Libya, eschewing trade wars, and modestly reducing spending — in short, &quot;changes at the margin&quot;.

==On grand strategy==

Luttwak has long insisted on the necessity of a grand strategy, but he moved beyond preoccupation with military intervention, and started to theorize diplomacy and military alliances. His &quot;Grand Strategy of the Soviet Union&quot; (1983) was the first English-language text that recognized the different nationalities that were re-emerging in the USSR and were ignored by both &quot;Kremlinologists&quot; and U.S. intelligence. Luttwak concluded that the Soviet Union relied entirely on military instruments for its grand strategy.

Luttwak argued that Carl von Clausewitz&#x27;s warning against aggressive wars was no longer relevant in the post-World War II era. He reasoned that when confronted with weapons of mass destruction, statecraft needed a grand strategy, that is, &quot;the firm subordination of tactical priorities, material ideals, and warlike instincts to political goals&quot;. For Luttwak, grand strategy was no longer a military doctrine, but a political issue, and diplomacy was needed to achieve the security of the state.

Writing in 2007 for the &quot;National Review&quot;, former George W. Bush&#x27;s speechwriter David Frum said of Luttwak: &quot;His book on the grand strategy of the Roman Empire was terrific, and his &quot;Coup d&#x27;État&quot; is that astounding thing: a great work of political science that is also a hilarious satire.

== Personal life ==
Luttwak describes himself as a &quot;fanatical snorkeler&quot; and exercises every day. He lives with his wife in Maryland. He has a son and daughter, as well as three grandchildren. Luttwak does not own a smartphone.

<text>Vasily Sergeyevich Kalinnikov (; 13 January 1866 – 11 January 1901 ) was a Russian composer. His body of work consists of two symphonies, several additional orchestral works, and numerous songs, all of them imbued with characteristics of folksong. His symphonies, particularly the First, were frequently performed in the early 20th century. Kalinnikov&#x27;s musical style was inspired by composers like Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov, and is notable for its expressive melodies and lush orchestration. 

His younger brother Viktor Kalinnikov (1870–1927) was also a composer, mainly of choral music.

== Biography ==

Kalinnikov was a police official&#x27;s son. He studied at the seminary at Oryol, becoming director of the choir there at fourteen. Later he went to the Moscow Conservatory but could not afford the tuition fees. On a scholarship, he went to the Moscow Philharmonic Society School, where he received bassoon and composition lessons from Alexander Ilyinsky. He played bassoon, timpani and violin in theater orchestras and supplemented his income working as a music copyist.

In 1892, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky recommended Kalinnikov for the position of main conductor of the Maly Theatre, and later that same year to the Moscow Italian Theatre. However, due to his worsening tuberculosis, Kalinnikov had to resign from his theatre appointments and move to the warmer southern climate of the Crimea. He lived at Yalta for the rest of his life, and it was there that he wrote the main part of his music, including his two symphonies and the incidental music for Alexey Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Tsar Boris&quot;. In Yalta he joined two other famous tubercular patients, Maxim Gorky and Anton Chekhov. Exhausted, he died of tuberculosis on 11 January 1901, just two days before his 35th birthday. He was survived by his widow and his brother, Viktor Kalinnikov, who composed choral music and taught at the Moscow Philharmonic Society School.

Vasily Kalinnikov&#x27;s reputation was established with his First Symphony, written between 1894 and 1895, which had great success when Alexander Vinogradsky conducted it at a Russian Musical Society concert in Kyiv on 20 February 1897. Further performances swiftly followed, in Moscow, Vienna, Berlin, and Paris. It was not published until after his death.

At Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s suggestion (following a visit to Kalinnikov in his illness), Tchaikovsky&#x27;s publisher P. Jurgenson bought three Kalinnikov songs for 120 rubles. After Kalinnikov&#x27;s death Jurgenson purchased the Symphony No. 2 in A major and other works from his widow for a high sum, commenting that his death &quot;had multiplied the value of his works by ten&quot;.

In Russia, his First Symphony remains in the repertory, and his place in musical history is secure. On 7 November 1943, Arturo Toscanini conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra in a rare broadcast performance of the First Symphony; although the performance was recorded, it was never commercially released by RCA Victor, but was released as a CD recording in 2006.

<text>HMAS &quot;Tattoo&quot; (H26) was an Admiralty S-class destroyer of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Built for the Royal Navy during World War I, the ship was not completed until 1919, and spent less than eight months in British service before being transferred to the RAN at the start of 1920. After arriving in Australia, &quot;Tattoo&quot; spent her entire career in Australian waters, and was placed in reserve on several occasions. &quot;Tattoo&quot; was decommissioned in 1936, and was sold for ship breaking in 1937.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Tattoo&quot; was built to the Admiralty design of the S-class destroyer, which was designed and built as part of the British emergency war programme. The destroyer had a displacement of 1,075 tons, a length overall of , and a beam of . The propulsion machinery consisted of three Yarrow boilers feeding Brown-Curtis turbines, which supplied to the ship&#x27;s two propeller shafts. Although designed with a maximum speed of , &quot;Tattoo&quot; was only able to achieve on power trials. The destroyer&#x27;s economical speed of gave her a range of . The ship&#x27;s company was made up of 6 officers and 93 sailors.

The destroyer&#x27;s primary armament consisted of three QF 4-inch Mark IV guns. These were supplemented by a 2-pounder pom-pom, two 9.5-inch howitzer bomb throwers, five .303 inch machine guns (a mix of Lewis and Maxim guns), two twin 21-inch torpedo tube sets, two depth charge throwers, and two depth charge chutes.

&quot;Tattoo&quot; was laid down by William Beardmore and Company, Limited, at Dalmuir in Scotland on 21 December 1917. The destroyer was launched on 28 December 1918, and completed on 7 April 1919. The ship was commissioned into the Royal Navy in April 1919, but was quickly marked for transfer to the RAN, along with four sister ships. &quot;Tattoo&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 27 January 1920. There were plans to rename her HMAS &quot;Moresby&quot;, but these were cancelled in June 1930.

==Operational history==
&quot;Tattoo&quot; and three of her sister ships sailed for Australia on 20 February, visiting ports in the Mediterranean, India, Singapore, and the Netherlands East Indies before reaching Sydney on 29 April. The destroyer was placed in reserve in October 1921, then was reactivated on 12 March 1926 for a six-week period. She was to be fully decommissioned on 26 March 1928, but this was cancelled in favour of decommissioning . &quot;Tattoo&quot; was recommissioned on 13 July 1931. She was returned to reserve on 30 June 1933, and was briefly reactivated in October of that year to assist in torpedo re-ranging trials. On 8 January 1935, the destroyer was assigned to Flinders Naval Depot, and was moved in and out of commission as required for training.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Tattoo&quot; paid off for the final time on 19 June 1936. She was sold to Penguins Limited for ship breaking on 4 June 1937.

<doc id="430239" wikidata="Q8917042" url="?curid=430239" title="Muhammad al-Mahdi">
<text>Muhammad ibn Hasan al-Mahdi () is believed by the Twelver Shia to be the last of the Twelve Imams and the eschatological Mahdi, who will emerge in the end of time to establish peace and justice and redeem Islam.

Hasan al-Askari, the eleventh Imam, died in 260 AH (873–874 CE), possibly poisoned by the Abbasids. Immediately after his death, his main representative, Uthman ibn Sa&#x27;id, claimed that the eleventh Imam had an infant son named Muhammad, who was kept hidden from the public out of fear of Abbasid persecution. Uthman also claimed to represent Muhammad, who had entered a state of occultation. Other local representatives of al-Askari largely supported these assertions, while the Shia community fragmented into several sects over al-Askari&#x27;s succession. All these sects, however, are said to have disappeared after a few decades except the Twelvers, who accept the son of al-Askari as the twelfth and final Imam in occultation.

Uthman was followed by three more agents, collectively known as the Four Deputies, who were regarded by the Twelver community as representatives of Muhammad al-Mahdi. This period, later termed the Minor Occultation, ended after about seventy years with the death of the fourth agent, Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad al-Samarri (). He is said to have received the final letter of Muhammad al-Mahdi shortly before his death. The letter predicted the death of Abu al-Hasan in six days and announced the beginning of the complete occultation, later called the Major Occultation, which continues to this day. The letter, ascribed to Muhammad al-Mahdi, added that the complete occultation would continue until God granted him permission to manifest himself again in a time when the earth would be filled with tyranny.

The Twelver theory of occultation crystallized in the first half of the fourth century AH (tenth century CE) based on rational and textual arguments. This theory, for instance, sets forth that the life of Muhammad al-Mahdi has been miraculously prolonged, arguing that the earth cannot be void of the Imam as the highest proof of God. In the absence of the Hidden Imam, the leadership vacuum in the Twelver community was gradually filled by faqīh &quot;jurists&quot;. It is popularly held that the Hidden Imam occasionally appears to the pious. The accounts of these encounters are numerous and widespread among the Twelvers.

== Titles ==

Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Hasan al-Askari, the eschatological savior in Twelver Islam, is known by many titles, including al-Mahdi (), al-Qa&#x27;im (), al-Montazar (), Saheb al-Zaman (), al-Gha&#x27;ib (), al-Hojja/Hojjat Allah (), Sahib al-Amr (), Sahib al-Haqq (), Baqiyat Allah ().

The title al-Qa&#x27;im signifies the rise against tyranny, though a () hadith from the sixth Shia Imam, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, connects this title to the rise of al-Qa&#x27;im after his death. As a hadith, this report is not viewed as reliable by experts, writes the Shia Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi (), especially because it contradicts the Twelver belief that the earth cannot be void of Imam at any time, as the () on the earth. Majlesi also suggests that death might be meant figuratively in this hadith, referring to the forgotten memory of al-Qa&#x27;im after his long occultation.

Abdulaziz Sachedina notes that the titles &quot;al-Qa&#x27;im&quot; and &quot;Sahib al-Amr&quot; have more of a political emphasis than the eschatological title &quot;al-Mahdi&quot;. The title al-Hujja, on the other hand, highlights the religious function of the savior. Indeed, every Shia Imam is viewed as , the (highest) proof of God, through whom the inner meanings of the Quran become accessible after the death of the prophet. This title is more pronounced for the twelfth Imam, however, possibly because of a related hadith from the tenth Imam, Ali al-Hadi.

== Historical background ==
Until their deaths, the tenth and eleventh Shia Imams (Ali al-Hadi and Hasan al-Askari, respectively) were held under close surveillance in the garrison town of Samarra by the Abbasids, who are often responsible in Shia sources for poisoning the two Imams. The two Imams witnessed the deterioration of the Abbasid caliphate, as the imperial authority rapidly transitioned into the hands of the Turks, particularly after al-Mutawakkil (March 822 – 11 December 861 CE).

Contemporary to the tenth Imam, Caliph al-Mutawakkil violently prosecuted the Shia, partly due to the renewed Zaydi opposition. The restrictive policies of al-Mutawakkil towards the tenth Imam were later adopted by his son, al-Mu&#x27;tamid, who is reported to have kept the eleventh Imam under house arrest without any visitors. Instead, al-Askari is known to have mainly communicated with his followers through a network of representatives. Among them was Uthman ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Asadi, who is said to have disguised himself as a seller of cooking fat to avoid the Abbasid agents, hence his nickname al-Samman.

Muhammad Husayn Tabatabai suggests that these restrictions were placed on al-Askari because the caliphate had come to know about traditions among the Shia elite, predicting that the eleventh Imam would father the eschatological Mahdi.

== Succession to al-Askari ==
Hasan al-Askari died in 260 (873–874) without an obvious heir. The death of the eleventh Imam divided his followers into several sects and created widespread confusion (), particularly in Iraq. Immediately after the death of al-Askari, his main agent, Uthman ibn Sa&#x27;id, claimed that the Imam had an infant son, named Muhammad, who was kept hidden from the public out of fear of Abbasid persecution. As the closest associate of al-Askari, this assertion by Uthman was largely supported by other representatives of al-Askari. Those who accepted the imamate of this Muhammad later formed the Twelvers.

Some others held that the imamate ceased with al-Askari and the Waqifites maintained that the eleventh Imam would later reemerge as the eschatological Mahdi. Others concluded that Muhammad ibn Ali al-Hadi, a deceased brother of al-Askari, must have been the true Imam. Yet others accepted the imamate of Ja&#x27;far al-Zaki, another brother of al-Askari. Some believed that the twelfth Imam would be born in the end of time to a descendant of al-Askari, and some left the Shia community.

All these sects, however, are said to have disappeared within a hundred years except the group that went on to become the Twelver Shia.

==Birth and early life of al-Mahdi==

When al-Askari died without leaving an obvious heir, the traditions and predictions attributed to earlier Imams were largely the basis for the existence of the son of al-Askari as the twelfth Imam; see Twelver doctrine of occultation.

As for the details of his birth, Twelver sources report that the son of al-Askari was born around 255 (868). He was named Abu al-Qasim Muhammad, the same name and  as the Islamic prophet, though he is more commonly known as Muhammad al-Mahdi (). His birthdate is given differently, but most sources seem to agree on 15 Sha&#x27;ban, which is celebrated by the Shia for this occasion. The Twelver accounts describe that, except for a few trusted associates, the existence of al-Mahdi was kept secret since the Abbasids sought to eliminate the son of al-Askari, whom persistent rumors described as a savior. Hussain writes that the infant must have been sent to Medina, where al-Askari&#x27;s mother lived.

The birth of al-Mahdi is often compared in Twelver sources to the birth of Moses in the Quran, who was miraculously saved from the pharaoh. As a child Imam, al-Mahdi is also often compared to Jesus, since both are viewed as the proof of God () and both spoke with the authority of an adult while still a child.

Al-Mahdi is said to have been born to Narjis, a slave-girl whose name is given by various sources as Sawsan, Rayhana, Sayqal, and Maryam. The first three are names of flowers and were likely given to her by her owner in keeping with the practice of the day. Her origin is recorded as the Byzantine Empire or Nubia, and some accounts state that she was bought providentially by an agent of al-Hadi, who recognized by clairvoyance in her the future mother of al-Mahdi. In the same vein, the detailed accounts of Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi and Shaykh Tusi describe Narjis as a captured granddaughter of the Byzantine emperor and a pious woman who learned about her future union with al-Askari in a dream, though these accounts have been described as hagiographic. Possibly the correct account is given by al-Mufid, who writes that Narjis was a slave girl born and raised in the house of Hakima Khatun, daughter of Muhammad al-Jawad (the ninth Imam) and paternal aunt of al-Askari.

=== Abbasid reaction ===
The death of al-Askari in 260 (873–874) followed a brief illness, during which the Abbasid al-Mu&#x27;tamid sent his doctors and servants to attend the Imam. Considering that al-Askari did not have an obvious heir, it has been suggested that the caliph intended to closely monitor al-Askari from within his residence. After the death of al-Askari, there are reports that his residence was searched and the women were examined for pregnancy, possibly in the hope of finding his heir. A female servant of al-Askari was held for a while, perhaps due to false rumors of her pregnancy designed to distract the Abbasids in their search.

Al-Askari left his estate to his mother, Hadith, to the exclusion of his brother, Ja&#x27;far ibn Ali al-Hadi, who had earlier unsuccessfully laid a claim to the imamate after the death of their father, al-Hadi. Ja&#x27;far repeated his claims to the imamate after the death of al-Askari, which this time found a following in the form of the now-extinct Ja&#x27;fariyya and Fathiyya sects. He also contested al-Askari&#x27;s will and raised the case with the authorities. Al-Askari was apparently childless, and Hadith was thus regarded as the sole inheritor in Shia law. The caliph, however, ruled the inheritance to be divided between Hadith and Ja&#x27;far.

== Minor Occultation (874–941) ==
Immediately after the death of al-Askari in 260 (873–874), Uthman ibn Sa&#x27;id al-Asadi () claimed that al-Askari had a young son, named Muhammad, who had entered a state of occultation () due to the Abbasid threat to his life. As the special representative of al-Askari, Uthman also claimed that he had been appointed to represent the son of the eleventh Imam. A Shia tradition attributed to the sixth Imam, Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq, states that this threat was specific to Muhammad al-Mahdi, who was expected to rise, unlike his predecessors who practiced religious dissimulation () and were politically quiescent.

Twelver sources detail that al-Mahdi made his only public appearance to lead the funeral prayer for his father instead of his uncle, Ja&#x27;far al-Zaki. It is also said that the occultation took place in the family home in Samarra, where currently a mosque stands, under which there is a cellar () that hides a well (Bi&#x27;r al-Ghayba, ). Into this well, al-Mahdi is said to have disappeared.

In his new capacity as the caretaker of the office of imamate, Uthman received petitions and made available their responses, sometimes in writing. As the closest associate of al-Askari, most of al-Askari&#x27;s local representatives continued to support Uthman. However, there might have been doubts among the Shia about his authority to collect and manage the religious funds.

Uthman later introduced his son, Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Uthman (), as the next representative of al-Mahdi. Abu Ja&#x27;far, who served for some forty years, has been credited with the unification of the mainstream Shia behind the son of al-Askari as the twelfth Imam in concealment. In turn, as his replacement, Abu Ja&#x27;far nominated Abu al-Qasim al-Husayn ibn Ruh al-Nawbakhti (), who is said to have been a well-respected figure in the Abbasid court. Under Abu al-Qasim, it is reported that the communications with the Hidden Imam resumed after a lapse of about twenty-five years.

This period, later termed the Minor Occultation (), ended after about seventy years with the death of the fourth agent, Abu al-Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad al-Samarri (), who is said to have received a letter from al-Mahdi shortly before his death. The letter predicted the death of Abu al-Hasan in six days and announced the beginning of the complete () occultation, later called the Major Occultation (). The letter, ascribed to al-Mahdi, added that the complete occultation would continue until God granted him permission to manifest himself again in a time when the earth would be filled with tyranny. The letter emphasized that anyone claiming to be the deputy of the Imam henceforth had to be considered an imposter. This and similar letters to the four agents and other Shia figures are said to have had the same handwriting, suggesting that they were written by the Hidden Imam.

=== Shia authority ===
The number of these agents was not limited to four in early Shia sources. Sachedina suggests that the later stress of the Twelver literature on the Four Deputies () was likely due to their prominence in Baghdad, the Shia center of the time. Similarly, Moojan Momen reckons that al-Askari&#x27;s network of the representatives () likely continued to operate during the Minor Occultation of al-Mahdi. Indeed, ibn Babawayh () speaks of other trusted men of the Hidden Imam in different cities in addition to the four agents. Sachedina writes that the Shia community lacked a notable figure to replace the fourth agent after his death.

The authority of the four agents on behalf of the Hidden Imam was challenged by some Shia figures, more so during the term of the third agent, al-Nawbakhti. For instance, Abu Ja&#x27;far Muhammad ibn Ali al-Shalmaghani turned against al-Nawbakhti and claimed to be the rightful agent of al-Mahdi, before denouncing the concept of occultation as a lie. Another instance was a disciple of al-Askari, named al-Karkhi, who was later condemned in a rescript, said to be written by al-Mahdi. Some miracles are also ascribed to the four agents, perceived by the faithful to be the result of their initiation by the Hidden Imam.

=== Shia community ===
At the time, the occultation of al-Mahdi was likely not a radical change for his followers. Indeed, the tenth and eleventh Imams were already effectively in occultation for the majority of the Shia, as both Imams were held nearly isolated in Samarra by the Abbasid caliphs. It also appears that the idea of occultation was a well-established concept for the Shia and the related traditions were already in circulation among them. These traditions forecasted the occultation and rise of a future Imam, referred to as al-Qa&#x27;im () and less frequently as al-Mahdi. These traditions were appropriated by various Shia sects in different periods. For instance, they were used by the Waqifites to argue that Musa al-Kazim, the seventh Imam, had not died but was in occultation. Even earlier, the now-extinct Kaysanites denied the death of Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya and awaited his return.

The political situation of the Shia in Iraq improved after the rise of the Buyid dynasty in the fourth (tenth) century. Perhaps it was the relative safety of the Shia that prompted the second agent to issue a rescript to the effect that al-Mahdi remained in occultation to avoid the burden of commitment () to unjust rulers of the time who were the usurpers of the Imam&#x27;s right in the Shia view. Ibn Babawayh () suggested that the situation remains unknown until the reappearance of Muhammad al-Mahdi but also added that the large population of the Shia did not necessarily guarantee his safety.

Nevertheless, many did not expect the occultation to continue beyond six years or beyond the fortieth birthday of al-Mahdi, and this might have contributed to an atmosphere of doubt and uncertainty among the Shia. According to Hossein Modarressi, these doubts gradually disappeared from the Shia community, possibly due to the efforts of the Shia traditionists during the period of transition to the Major Occultation. These traditionists heavily relied on prophetic traditions and specific interpretations of the Quran to vindicate the imamate of al-Mahdi. In this period, possibly after 295 (908), Shia traditionists also settled the number of Imams with the help of a Sunni hadith, in circulation long before the occultation, which stated that the prophet would be followed by twelve successors. The Hidden Imam was thus also the last Imam.

== Major Occultation (941–present) ==
The Major Occultation, a term coined later, began with the death of the fourth agent in 329 (940–941), who did not designate a successor. In this period, which continues today, there is no agent of the Hidden Imam on earth. There is some evidence that the death of the fourth agent also dissolved the underground network of representatives responsible primarily for the collection and distribution of the religious dues. The office of deputyship was thus formally closed. Despite some uncertainty, there were likely early traditions among the Shia that had already predicted the two periods of occultation. These hadiths were previously cited, for instance, by the Waqifites in reference to the two arrests of Musa al-Kazim, the seventh Imam. Nevertheless, the prolonged absence of the Hidden Imam seems to have created widespread doubts among his followers.

=== Leadership vacuum ===
As both the spiritual and political head of the Shia community, the occultation of the Hidden Imam left a considerable gap in the Shia community. This leadership vacuum was eventually filled by Twelver jurists (), who remain the sole leaders of the Shia community during the Major Occultation. Often cited to support this transition is a letter received by Ishaq ibn Ya&#x27;qub in response to his religious inquiries of the second agent. The letter, said to be written by al-Mahdi, stipulated that
 A few similar hadiths are attributed to the tenth and eleventh Imams. The traditions also specify that these jurists must be just and knowledgeable in Islamic law. As the absence of the Hidden Imam continued, however, the Twelver jurists evolved from mere transmitters () of hadith to in order to resolve new religious questions that arose over time. Their authority also increased with time to address the need to explicate religious teachings for the community. For instance, as early as the seventh (thirteenth) century, Muhaqqiq al-Hilli () spent the Imam&#x27;s share of Khums (a type of Islamic alms) on activities that furthered the cause of Shia, as opposed to his predecessors, such as al-Shaykh al-Mufid (), who often asked the faithful to save these donations for the rise of al-Mahdi.

Considering that jurists were not directly appointed by the Hidden Imam, it was debated whether their authority should extend to functions with political implications, such as declaring holy war (). It was likely Zayn al-Din al-Juba&#x27;i al&#x27;Amili () who first suggested that a (qualified) jurist was the general deputy () of the Hidden Imam whose authority encompassed all prerogatives of the Imam. The transition of Twelver jurists into their new role was facilitated by the formation of Shia states, particularly the Safavid and Qajar dynasties in Iran. For instance, during the Russo-Iranian war of 1804–1813, the eminent clerics of Najaf and Isfahan issued a declaration of against the Russians to support the Qajarite Abbas Mirza, who was conducting the campaign. Later on, however, jurists often had to compete with the Shia monarchs for religious authority.

In sum, the politically quiescent approach of the Twelver jurists over time gave way to eventually questioning the legitimacy of Shia monarchs and even attempts to restrict their power through a constitution. This evolution culminated with the concept of () by Ruhollah Khomeini, the religious leader of the Iranian Revolution in 1979, who called upon religious scholars to assume an active role after the toppling of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last monarch of Iran.

=== Doctrinal developments ===
While some traditions, dating back to before 260 (874), might have predicted a second occultation, the sources from the beginning of Major Occultation indicate that the prolonged absence of the Hidden Imam may have led many of the Twelvers to abandon their belief in him. His absence also provided a basis for renewed criticisms at the time, voiced by the Mu&#x27;tazilites and Ash&#x27;arites. These pressures likely expedited a transition in Twelver arguments from a traditionist to a rationalist approach in order to vindicate the occultation of al-Mahdi. Abu Sahl Isma&#x27;il ibn Ali al-Nawbakhti (), for instance, argued that the absence of an Imam does not invalidate his religion or law, as with the absence of a prophet. Concerns about inauthentic hadiths, voiced by Tusi () and others, might have given another impetus to this transition.

Starting with ibn Babawayh () and his student al-Shaykh al-Mufid (), Shia scholars began to employ theological arguments modeled on the Mu&#x27;tazilite . Of these, the principle of () is an example which, at a high level, necessitates that a prophet or an Imam should exist at any time to guide towards God, as the manifestation of His utmost kindness towards His subjects. Other Twelver arguments aim to establish that the Hidden Imam benefits the humankind even in occultation, &quot;just as the people benefit from the sun while it is covered by clouds.&quot; While the ordinary Twelvers were likely content with the traditions about occultation, the theologist approach to vindicating the Hidden Imam was intended to address the criticisms of the non-Twelver theologians. The two approaches were blended together by Shaykh Tusi in his substantial monograph &quot;Kitab al-Ghayba&quot; ().

=== Visitations ===
The Twelvers believe that the primordial Nūr &quot;Light&quot; of the prophethood has continued to shine through the ages in the character of the Imams. Thus the Hidden Imam is not viewed as inaccessible in the state of occultation. Indeed, it is popularly held that al-Mahdi occasionally appears to the pious in person or, more commonly, in dreams and visions. The accounts of these encounters are numerous and widespread in the Twelver community. Among these accounts are also the encounters of the prominent religious scholars () with the Hidden Imam.

The descriptions of these contacts often show the concern of the Hidden Imam for the well-being of his followers and how such encounters may prompt the believer&#x27;s &quot;spiritual resurrection,&quot; an interpretation put forward by late mystic sources. As the Hidden Imam can only be seen in the end of time, those who see him, it is argued, have attained their end of time. For instance, publishers close to the Lebanese Shia militant organization Hezbollah have published the accounts of some Hezbollah fighters who believed they were directly assisted by al-Mahdi in critical moments on the battlefields of the 2006 Lebanon War.

== Twelver doctrine of occultation ==
The Twelver doctrine of occultation crystallized in the first half of the fourth (tenth) century. In its simplest form, this doctrine states that Muhammad al-Mahdi, the twelfth Imam, did not die but has been concealed by God from humanity. His life has been miraculously prolonged until the day he manifests himself again by God&#x27;s permission to fill the earth with justice. This occultation continues until the safety of the Imam can be guaranteed, and until humankind is ready to receive his guidance. During the Minor Occultation, he remained in contact with his followers through the four Babs (gates). During the Major Occultation, which began in 329 (941) and continues to this day, there is no direct communication, though the Hidden Imam still remains responsible in Twelver belief for the inward spiritual guidance of humankind (whereas his outward role begins with his reappearance).

=== Hadith literature ===
The Twelver literature about the doctrine of occultation is extensive, based on rational and textual arguments. One such instance is a prophetic hadith, reported by Shia and Sunni authorities, including the canonical &quot;Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal&quot;. One version of this hadith reads, &quot;If the earth had only one day of existence left to it, God would prolong that day until a man of my posterity, whose name will be my name, and his surname my surname, manifests himself; he will fill the earth, filled till then with violence and oppression, with harmony and justice.&quot; Another prophetic hadith, in circulation long before the occultation, predicted that Muhammad was to be followed by twelve successors (s), during whose reign the Islamic community would be united, as reported in &quot;Sahih Muslim&quot; and other canonical Sunni sources. It is argued that these twelve successors cannot include the (often immoral) Umayyad or Abbasid caliphs and, in any case, their number exceeded twelve. These twelve, he thus concludes, are the Twelve Imams. More generally, in Twelver collections of hadith, the reappearance of al-Mahdi is the most frequently cited subject in predictions made by the prophet, his daughter, Fatimah, and the Twelve Imams.

=== Quran ===
Al-Mahdi is viewed by the Twelvers as a hidden saint in view of verses 18:65–66 of the Quran and the two types of saints in those verses, namely, outwardly manifest, such as Moses, and hidden, like Khidr. As with the account of Khidr in the Quran, it is held that the Hidden Imam benefits the Islamic community () during the occultation, as the sun behind clouds still gives light and warmth.

Muhammad al-Baqir, the fifth Imam, is said to have related verse 21:105 of the Quran to the rise of al-Mahdi: &quot;And verily We have written in the scripture (&quot;Zabur&quot;), after the reminder, [that] My righteous slaves will inherit the earth.&quot; As another instance, Shaykh Tusi () connects verses 28:5–6 to the rule of al-Mahdi in the end of time. In particular, verse 28:5 reads, &quot;And We desired to show favor unto those who were oppressed in the earth, and to make them Imams and to make them the inheritors.&quot;

=== Reasons for occultation ===
While the Abbasid threat might have initially forced al-Mahdi into occultation, his absence continues in Twelver belief until initial conditions are met for his reappearance to establish justice and peace on earth. One such condition, Sobhani writes, is humankind&#x27;s readiness for the intellectual and spiritual message of the Hidden Imam. Without these conditions, he argues that al-Mahdi might be killed similar to his predecessors. Similarly, when asked about the reason for the occultation, Muhammad al-Baqir is reported to have answered, &quot;To prevent his being killed.&quot; Shia traditions add two more reasons for the occultation, namely, test for the followers of the Imam and their faith, and avoiding the burden of commitment () to unjust rulers of the time. It is also held that the true reason for the occultation will be only known when the Imam reappears as in the story of Musa and Khidr, where the motivation of Khidr for his actions was not immediately revealed to Musa.

=== Longevity ===
In response to Sunni criticism and even ridicule, Shia scholars have argued that the longevity of the Hidden Imam, born around 868 CE, is not unreasonable given the long lives of Khidr, Jesus, and the Dajjal (another eschatological figure), as well as secular reports about long-lived men. Along these lines, Muhammad Husayn Tabatabai emphasizes the miraculous qualities of al-Mahdi, adding that his long life, while unlikely, is not impossible.

Historians suggest that these views stem from the &quot;Ghulat&quot;, or exaggerators. Extremists or exaggerators would focus &amp; indulge in different concepts resulting in themes that would be integrated into Twelver Shiism. Hodgson states “nor is there anything more extreme in expecting a man to return whom others regard as dead – as some of the early Ghulat did – than in the expectation of the so-called moderate Sh’ia that a man will return whom others doubt was ever born”.

This view is supported by the absence of the occultation &quot;t&quot;raditions in early texts such as al-Qummi&#x27;s &quot;Basa’ir al-Darajat and&quot; &quot;Kitab al-Mahasin&quot; by al-Barqi (d. 893). Muhammad bin Ali bin Babawayhi (d. 991) was the one who began to mention details regarding occultation being beyond the ordinary human.

=== Reappearance ===
Shortly before the Last Judgment, when commanded by God, al-Mahdi will return to lead the forces of righteousness against the forces of evil in an apocalyptic war that would ultimately establish peace and justice on earth, according to the Twelvers. He is also viewed by the Twelvers as the restorer of true Islam. In his mission, al-Mahdi will be assisted by Jesus, who will kill the Dajjal or &quot;antichrist&quot; in some Islamic accounts. Al-Mahdi would also be accompanied by 313 loyal followers, their number identical to the number of Muslim warriors in the Battle of Badr. He is expected to reemerge as a young man in possession of the relics of the past prophets, e.g., the staff and arc of Moses. The time of his reappearance is unknown, however, and Shia hadiths expressly forbid haste () and setting time () for his return.

Numerous Shia hadiths predict that the reappearance of al-Mahdi would be heralded by some signs, of which some are inevitable, and others are conditional, i.e., might change by divine decision. Alternatively, some of these signs are general, and some are specific. The foremost general sign of the second coming of al-Mahdi is the prevalence of evil on earth in the form of tyranny, injustice, and religious and moral degradation. In particular, at the time, Islam would be devoid of its soul and practiced only outwardly. Only a fraction of the Shia, those who truly practice their Imams&#x27; teachings, will remain on the righteous path in the end of time.

Among the special signs are the rise of Sufyani, who would later command the enemies of al-Mahdi, the rise of Yamani, who would later support al-Mahdi, the divine cry (, ) which calls upon men to join al-Mahdi, often followed shortly by another supernatural cry from the earth that invites men to join the enemies of al-Mahdi, the swallowing up () of an army dispatched by Sufyani in a desert, and the assassination by Meccans of the messenger of al-Mahdi, referred to as the pure soul ().

== Connections with the Islamic figure of Mahdi ==
A widely-held Muslim belief is that a restorer of religion and justice, with the name of Mahdi (), will rule the world in the end of time. In particular, it appears to be an accepted notion in Sunni Islam that this savior would be a descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah and his son-in-law Ali. While absent from the &quot;Sahih&quot;s of Muhammad al-Bukhari and Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj, traditions about Mahdi can be found in other canonical Sunni hadith collections, including the works of Abu Dawud al-Sijistani, al-Tirmidhi, ibn Majah, and al-Nasa&#x27;i, and Ahmad ibn Hanbal. These hadiths have likely strengthened the popular belief in Mahdi among Muslims. Historically, various Muslim figures were identified with Mahdi or used the name as an honorific epithet with messianic significance. These include the Umayyad Umar II and the Abbasid al-Mahdi, among many others.

Unlike Sunni Islam, however, the belief in Mahdi of the lineage of the prophet is central to Shia Islam, in general, and to Twelver Shia, in particular, where Mahdi is identified with the twelfth Imam. Distinctive to Shia is also the doctrine of occultation or the temporary absence of Mahdi. Sunni and Shia traditions, however, have much in common about the career of Mahdi. In particular, Moojan Momen lists several signs before the advent of Mahdi which are common to both Sunni and Shia beliefs.

=== Support from Sunni circles ===
As early as the fourth (ninth) century, or possibly much earlier, Shia sources identify the twelfth Imam with the messianic figure of Mahdi in Islam. The Twelver authors also aim to establish that the description of Mahdi in Sunni sources applies to the twelfth Imam. Their efforts gained considerable momentum in the seventh (thirteenth) century when several notable Sunni scholars endorsed the Shia view of Mahdi. For instance, in his &quot;Kitab al-Bayan fi akhbar sahib al-zaman&quot;, the Shafi&#x27;i traditionist Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Gandji proved that the twelfth Shia Imam was Mahdi, relying solely on Sunni traditions. Since then, Amir-Moezzi writes, there is Sunni support from time to time for the Twelvers&#x27; view of Mahdi.

Wilferd Madelung writes that a major Sunni objection to the Mahdiship of the twelfth Imam, whose name and  matches those of the prophet, is that the name of his father, Hasan al-Askari, differs from the prophet&#x27;s father, Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib. On the other hand, according to Madelung, al-Aburi testified that this stipulation was later added to the tradition by the Kufan transmitter Za&#x27;ida ().

=== Support from Sufi circles ===
There has also been some Sufi support for the Mahdiship of the twelfth Imam. Al-Bayhaqi () writes that some Sufi gnostics agreed with the Twelvers about the identity and occultation of Mahdi. As another instance, the Egyptian Sufi al-Sha&#x27;rani, not known to be sympathetic to the Shia cause, echoed the Twelver views about Mahdi in his &quot;al-Yawaqit wa al-Jawahir.&quot; Possibly to avoid the Shia implications of this statement, al-Idwi later falsely quoted parts of it and suppressed the rest.

== Birthday celebration ==
The birthday of Muhammad al-Mahdi is celebrated annually in Iran on 15 Sha&#x27;ban. On the evening of the birthday, millions of people in the country celebrate the occasion annually. The city of Qom is decorated by bright lights and flags. The date of the celebration is based on the Islamic calendar and changes from year to year:

<text>The is a train service operated by Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu) on the Kyushu Shinkansen in Japan since 2004.

The word in Japanese means &quot;swallow&quot;, and has been used on a succession of limited express trains on the Tokaido and Sanyo Main Line in Japan since 1930.

==History==

===Pre-war===

The &quot;Tsubame&quot; name (originally written as &quot;燕&quot;) was first used from 1 October 1930 for limited express services operating between and , hauled by JNR Class C51 and JNR Class C53 steam locomotives. These services operated until 30 September 1943.

===Post-war===
The name was revived (this time written as &quot;つばめ&quot;) from 1 January 1950 for limited express services operating between Tokyo and , hauled by JNR Class C62 steam and JNR Class EF58 electric locomotives, and later by 151 series electric multiple unit (EMU) trains. From 1 October 1964, following the opening of the Tōkaidō Shinkansen, the name was reassigned to limited express trains operating between and . From 1 October 1965, services were extended to operate between and Hakata, operated by 481 and 583 series EMUs. These services continued until 9 March 1975 (when the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen was fully in operation).

===JR Kyushu===
The &quot;Tsubame&quot; name was once again revived by JR Kyushu from 15 July 1992 for limited express services operating on the Kagoshima Main Line between / and Nishi-Kagoshima (now Kagoshima-Chūō Station), operated using new 787 series EMUs in 6-, 7-, or 11-car formations.
These services operated until 12 March 2004, the day before the new Kyushu Shinkansen opened.

===&quot;Relay Tsubame&quot;===

With the start of services on the Kyushu Shinkansen between and from 13 March 2004, new &quot;Relay Tsubame&quot; services commenced on the Kagoshima Main Line between and using 787 series EMUs in 7-, 8-, and 11-car formations. The operation of the &quot;Relay Tsubame&quot; service was unique, as it was the only station in Japan where normal trains stopped at platforms adjacent to the shinkansen platforms. This was to facilitate transfer of passengers from shinkansen to &quot;Relay Tsubame&quot; and vice versa. Normally, shinkansen platforms are physically separated from normal train platforms with fare gates and may be at a different level (usually above the normal train platforms).

When the remainder of the Kyushu Shinkansen was opened on 12 March 2011, the &quot;Tsubame&quot; became an all-stations service (similar to the &quot;Kodama&quot; on the Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen), operating primarily as shuttle services between Hakata and . Services operate twice per hour in each direction during the morning and evening, and once per hour during the middle of the day. Some &quot;Tsubame&quot; services also run to/from Kagoshima-Chūō.

==Rolling stock==
Shinkansen train services are formed of eight-car N700 series (JR West N700-7000 series and JR Kyushu N700-8000 series) trains or six-car JR Kyushu 800 series trains.

==Formations==

===N700 series===
Eight-car N700 series services are formed as follows, with car 1 at the Kagoshima-Chūō (southern) end. Cars 1 to 3 are ordinary-class cars with 2+3 seating, and cars 4 to 8 are ordinary-class cars with 2+2 seating. Half of car 6 has &quot;Green car&quot; (first class) 2+2 seating. All cars are non-smoking since the smoking ban in March 2024.

On some train services, cars 4 and 5 are also non-reserved.

===800 series===
Six-car 800 series services are formed as follows, with car 1 at the Kagoshima-Chūō (southern) end. All accommodation is ordinary class with 2+2 seating. All cars are non-smoking.

On some train services, car 4 is also non-reserved.

<text>Prairie Public&#x27;s radio service is a network of ten radio frequencies in North Dakota. It is a service of Prairie Public Broadcasting based in Fargo.

Prairie Public maintains active studios in Fargo and Bismarck. It is a member station of National Public Radio (NPR) and provides NPR news and programming, local and regional news, and two distinct music formats: the News and Classical network, and the adult album alternative formatted Roots, Rock, and Jazz network.

==Programming==

Prairie Public produces and broadcasts &quot;Main Street&quot;, a weekday interview show hosted by Ashley Thornberg and Craig Blumenshine, &quot;Dakota Datebook&quot;, &quot;Into the Music with Mike Olson&quot;, &quot;Prebys on Classics&quot;, and &quot;Why?&quot;, hosted by UND philosophy professor Dr. Jack Weinstein. Prairie Public is also the distributor for &quot;Listening to America with Clay Jenkinson&quot;.

Prairie Public offers news programming on weekday mornings and afternoons from its newsrooms in Bismarck and Fargo. It also airs news from NPR.

Prairie Public is a member station of National Public Radio, airing programs such as &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, and also carries programming from Public Radio International (such as &quot;The World&quot;) and American Public Media, as well as from Public Radio Exchange (such as This American Life).

Prairie Public&#x27;s radio network offers two programming services. The primary News and Classical network originating from KCND in Bismarck is carried on most stations, and split into eastern and western schedules. The adult album alternative formatted Roots, Rock, and Jazz network originating from KFJM in Grand Forks has gradually expanded its programming to additional stations since its launch in 2002. KDSU in Fargo carries a combination of both networks, airing Roots, Rock and Jazz programming when the rest of the main network airs classical music.

===News and Classical network===

The primary network of Prairie Public airs classical music, news, talk, and weekend specialty shows, including jazz.

===Roots, Rock, and Jazz network===
KFJM originates Prairie Public&#x27;s second music format, a mixture of adult album alternative, blues, folk, and jazz. The network is rebroadcast full-time on KPPR Williston and the HD-2 channel of Prairie Public&#x27;s other full-power News and Classical stations. KDSU of Fargo broadcasts the network midday weekdays and overnights.

==Stations==
Prairie Public has 10 full power stations and 5 low-power translators broadcasting across North Dakota, northwest Minnesota, and eastern Montana.

=== News and Classical stations ===
=== Roots, Rock and Jazz stations ===
===HD Radio===
Prairie Public&#x27;s full power stations broadcast HD Radio signals, adding full-digital simulcasts of their analog channel, plus the Roots, Rock, and Jazz network on subchannel &quot;HD-2&quot; of the News and Classical stations.

===Cable systems===
Shaw Cable&#x27;s Winnipeg system carried Prairie Public&#x27;s News and Classical service at 107.9 FM (via KUND-FM), until Shaw discontinued FM distribution in 2012.

Prairie Public&#x27;s News and Classical network is carried on MTS Ultimate TV across Manitoba, on channel 733.

==History==
Prairie Public was established on February 1, 1999 as the North Dakota Public Radio network. It consisted of three partners — Prairie Public Broadcasting, the North Dakota State University, and the University of North Dakota — with the goal of providing a full public radio service to all of North Dakota.

At the time of North Dakota Public Radio&#x27;s formation, the University of North Dakota operated three stations in Grand Forks: KUND (AM), KUND-FM (89.3 FM) which dated to 1976, and KFJM (90.7 FM) which started in 1995. KUND (AM) had been established, as KFJM, in 1923 as one of the first college radio stations in the United States. It left the network after it was sold in 2004. North Dakota State University&#x27;s station, KDSU (91.9 FM) in Fargo dated to 1966. These stations were early members of NPR, but this left western North Dakota without public radio. Prairie Public Television had broadened its mission to include radio in the late 1970s, and in 1981 KCND in Bismarck signed on as the first public radio station in the western part of the state, under the on-air name of Prairie Public Radio. Between 1981 and 1993, four more stations signed on.

On September 26, 2006, North Dakota Public Radio was renamed Prairie Public, chosen to achieve brand consistency with Prairie Public Broadcasting&#x27;s television and other operations.

In 2009, KPPD signed on as a full-power station for the Devils Lake region, and HD Radio was rolled out to all Prairie Public full-power stations. In 2012, KPPW signed on as the new full-power News and Classical network station for Williston, with KPPR moving to the Roots, Rock, and Jazz network.

In September 2018, KFJM and KUND-FM were sold by the University of North Dakota to Prairie Public Broadcasting.

<doc id="430253" wikidata="Q908745" url="?curid=430253" title="Japan Prize">
<text>is awarded to individuals whose original and outstanding achievements in science and technology are recognized as having advanced the frontiers of knowledge and served the cause of peace and prosperity for mankind. As of 2024, the Japan Prize has been awarded to 111 people from more than ten countries.

The Japan Prize is presented by the Japan Prize Foundation, which selects internationally-renowned scientists and engineers to be awarded the Prize in one of two areas: one from Physics, Chemistry, Informatics, and Engineering; and one from Life Science, Agriculture, Medicine, and Pharmacy. The corresponding fields for each area are determined in advance, and each year, two awards are presented. Laureates each receive a certificate of merit, a prize medal, and as of 2020, a prize of 100 million yen. Only living individuals are eligible for the award.

The prestigious prize presentation ceremony is held in the presence of the Emperor and the Empress of Japan. According to his book &quot;Dancing Naked in the Mind Field&quot;, Kary Mullis, 1993 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, addressed Empress Michiko as &quot;sweetie&quot; when being awarded the prize in 1993 for the development of the polymerase chain reaction. The events are also attended by the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the President of the House of Councillors, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and by government ministers and representatives from various fields and industries. The 2014 Japan Prize Presentation Ceremony was held on April 23 at the National Theatre in Tokyo.

At present the international prize is often considered one of the most prestigious awards in science and technology fields after the Nobel Prize. According to an article in the scientific journal &quot;Nature Immunology&quot;, the prize is one of the prestigious science awards that recognize immunology as well as Nobel Prize, Sweden (since 1901), Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award, USA (since 1946), Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize, Germany (since 1952), Canada Gairdner International Award, Canada (since 1959), Wolf Prize, Israel (since 1978), and Crafoord Prize, Sweden (since 1980).

== Background ==

In 1981, the Japanese government wished to establish a prestigious international award that would contribute to the advancement of science and technology, and private donations would form the foundation of the prize. 

The Japanese Government issued the following cabinet endorsement on the establishment of the Japan Prize on October 28, 1983: 

&quot;The official position of the Japanese Government is that the Japan Prize, to be bestowed by the Science and Technology Foundation of Japan (now known as the Japan Prize Foundation), will serve to deepen the understanding of the role played by science and technology in furthering world peace and prosperity, thereby making a vital contribution to the positive development of mankind. Based on this judgment, the government agencies concerned are urged to offer whatever cooperation necessary in all phases pertinent to this Prize.&quot;

The first Japan Prize Presentation Ceremony was held in April 1985.

<text>The Wheatland Music Festival is a music and arts festival organized by the &quot;Wheatland Music Organization,&quot; a non-profit organization specializing in the preservation and presentation of traditional arts and music. Community outreach services include programming for Senior facilities and schools across mid-Michigan, year-round instrument lessons, scholarship programs, Jamborees, Traditional Dances, and Wheatscouts - a free program educating children through music, dance, storytelling, crafts and nature. Each year, the organization holds its annual Traditional Arts Weekend the weekend of Memorial Day, and its annual festival during the second weekend in September in the unincorporated community of Remus in the state of Michigan, in the United States. The first Wheatland Music Festival was held August 24, 1974.

==History==
In the early 1970s a small group of Mt. Pleasant Food Co-Op (now the GreenTree Cooperative Grocery) members and local musicians were staging free concerts and benefits around the Big Rapids and Mt. Pleasant, MI areas. Common sites were city parks and public halls. Proceeds enabled the food co-op to pay rent and utilities. Meanwhile, founders of the Wheatland Music Organization were organizing about two concerts a month during the summer.

The First Wheatland Bluegrass Festival was held as a benefit for the Mt. Pleasant Food Co-Op, August 24, 1974. It was a one-day event held on the Rhode family farm, located four miles east of Remus on M-20. June Rhodes&#x27; utility room became festival headquarters, her backyard was the backstage area, and her sister-in-law&#x27;s yard across the road was the parking lot. The flatbed trailers were in place along with the first-aid tent, a sound system, and a hotdog stand.

By 1975 Wheatland was born. Elections were held and the board of directors was established. Many of the first directors are still active in the organization. This can be attributed to their faith in each other, their commitment to community service, and passion for preserving and presenting traditional music and arts.

With the 47th annual festival being deferred to 2021, officials blamed the COVID-19 pandemic as the result of 2020&#x27;s cancellation.

2021 festival and lineup were announced in June 2021, however due to rising rates of COVID-19 the 2021 festival was cancelled on August 11, with the next festival deferred to September 2022.

<doc id="430263" wikidata="Q1140214" url="?curid=430263" title="Give 'Em Enough Rope">
<text>Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope is the second studio album by the English punk rock band the Clash, released on 10 November 1978 through CBS Records. It was their first album released in the United States, preceding the US version of the self-titled studio album. The album was well received by critics and fans, peaking at number two in the United Kingdom Albums Chart, and number 128 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album is tied with &quot;Combat Rock&quot; (1982) for being the highest-charting album for the Clash in their native United Kingdom.

The album marked the first album appearance of drummer Topper Headon, who joined the band shortly after the recording of their first studio album. Most of the tracks, as with the prior album, were written by guitarists Joe Strummer and Mick Jones, with the exception of &quot;English Civil War&quot; (a reworking of the traditional American folk song &quot;When Johnny Comes Marching Home&quot;) and &quot;Guns on the Roof&quot;, which is credited to all four band members, being Headon, Jones, Strummer, and bassist Paul Simonon.

==Background==
The album&#x27;s cover art was designed by Gene Greif, the front of which was based on a postcard titled &quot;End of the Trail&quot;, photographed by Adrian Atwater and featuring Wallace Irving Robertson. The cover of the first US pressings showed the band&#x27;s name written in block capital letters. Subsequent US pressings used a faux-oriental style font, which was then replaced with the more ornate faux-oriental style font used on the UK release. The original American issue of the album also retitled &quot;All the Young Punks&quot; as &quot;That&#x27;s No Way to Spend Your Youth&quot;. This was revised on later editions. &quot;Tommy Gun&quot; and &quot;English Civil War&quot; were released as the album&#x27;s singles, either side of Christmas 1978. They entered the UK charts at numbers 19 and 25, respectively.

Though the opening track of side two, &quot;Guns on the Roof&quot;, is ostensibly about global terrorism, war and corruption, it was partly inspired by an incident that resulted in the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s armed counterterrorist squad raiding the Clash&#x27;s Camden Market base. Paul Simonon and Topper Headon were arrested and charged with criminal damage (and later fined £750) for shooting racing pigeons with an air-gun from the roof of their rehearsal building.

The band continued to include contemporary subjects in their lyrics on the album; &quot;Tommy Gun&quot; deals with Middle Eastern terrorism, specifically the hi-jacking of aircraft, while &quot;Julie&#x27;s Been Working for the Drug Squad&quot; is a commentary on the infamous &quot;Operation Julie&quot; drug bust that saw the largest LSD production ring in the world, based in Wales, dismantled by an undercover police operation. The song also makes a reference to the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; in the opening line, &quot;It&#x27;s Lucy in the sky and all kinds of apple pie&quot;. &quot;Drug-Stabbing Time&quot; is strongly anti-drug and describes the paranoia of being caught despite the band&#x27;s (specifically Mick Jones&#x27;s) drug usage.

&quot;Safe European Home&quot; describes Strummer&#x27;s and Jones uneasy writing trip to Jamaica. Jones later commented on the trip by saying, &quot;we went down to the docks and I think we only survived because they mistook us for sailors.&quot; The song also contains references of Jamaican culture and buildings like the Sheraton hotel in Kingston.

During recording of the album, Joe Strummer&#x27;s trademark Fender Telecaster guitar needed to be taken in for repairs, so he played a hired semi-hollow Gibson ES-345 for most of the sessions. Sandy Pearlman, who produced the original album, was not a big fan of Joe Strummer&#x27;s voice, to the point that he ensured the drums were mixed louder than Strummer&#x27;s vocals on the entire album.

Other songs recorded during the sessions included the single &quot;(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais&quot;, as well as B-sides &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, &quot;1-2 Crush on You&quot; and &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. Four more songs were recorded: &quot;One Emotion&quot;, &quot;Groovy Times&quot;, &quot;Ooh Baby Ooh (It&#x27;s Not Over)&quot; (AKA &quot;Rusted Chrome&quot;, later reworked and released as &quot;Gates of the West&quot;) and &quot;RAF 1810.&quot;

==Critical reception==

In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Greil Marcus hailed &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot; as a poised, unpretentious record of &quot;straight English punk with a grip on the future&quot; and &quot;accessible hard rock&quot; showcasing the Clash&#x27;s unyielding, humorous &quot;vision of public life&quot;: &quot;The band&#x27;s vision of a world strangling on its own contradictions hasn&#x27;t changed, but their idea of their place in that world has.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised Jones as &quot;an excellent lead guitarist, both melodic and savage in his playing,&quot; dismissed &quot;Last Gang in Town&quot; as &quot;a plodding bore,&quot; and lamented the &quot;absence of ... roots reggae stylings.&quot;

Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that the album&#x27;s pessimistic mood and a couple of bad songs or moments made it less listenable than the band&#x27;s debut studio album, but concluded that most of the songs were &quot;effective melodically as anything on &quot;The Clash&quot;, and even the band&#x27;s ruminations on the star as culture hero become more resonant as you hear them over and over again. This isn&#x27;t among the greatest rock albums ever, but it is among the finest of the year.&quot; He named it the fourth best album of 1978 in his list for the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics in which &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot; also finished fourth. &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine named it the year&#x27;s best record.

In 1993, &quot;Give &#x27;Em Enough Rope&quot; was named the 87th greatest album of all time in &quot;NME&quot; magazine. &quot;Q&quot; included the record in their &quot;100 Best Punk Albums&quot; list, and wrote in retrospect that it was &quot;no more punk than Blondie&quot; and &quot;shined of quality&quot;, and &quot;their drumming problems were over with the arrival of jazz-trained [Topper] Headon.&quot;

<text>Midway Games Inc. (formerly Midway Manufacturing and Bally Midway, and commonly known simply as Midway) was an American video game company that existed from 1958 to 2010. Midway&#x27;s franchises included &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, &quot;Rampage&quot;, &quot;Spy Hunter&quot;, &quot;NBA Jam&quot;, &quot;Cruis&#x27;n&quot; and &quot;NFL Blitz&quot;. Midway also acquired the rights to video games that were originally developed by WMS Industries and Atari Games, such as &quot;Defender&quot;, &quot;Joust&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Gauntlet&quot; and the &quot;Rush&quot; series.

The company was founded as Midway Manufacturing in 1958, as an amusement game manufacturer. The company was then purchased by Bally Manufacturing in 1969. In 1973, Midway moved into the interactive entertainment industry, developing and publishing arcade video games. The company scored its first mainstream hit with the U.S. distribution of &quot;Space Invaders&quot; in 1978. Bally then consolidated its pinball division with Midway in 1982, which was renamed Bally/Midway. In 1988, Bally Manufacturing sold its amusement games operations to WMS Industries, the former Williams Electronics, which used the plain Midway name for video games while using the Bally and Williams names for pinball.

In 1994, WMS purchased Tradewest to bring publishing of home video game market in-house, with the latter becoming Midway Home Entertainment in 1996, the same year that Midway made its initial public offering of stock. In 1998, WMS spun off its remaining shares of Midway. Midway was ranked the fourth largest-selling video game publisher in 2000. However it experienced large annual net losses and engaged in a series of stock and debt offerings and other financings and borrowings. Midway exited the arcade industry in 2001. Sumner Redstone, the head of Viacom and CBS Corporation, increased his stake in Midway from about 15% in 1998 to about 87% by the end of 2007. In December 2008, Redstone sold all his stock and $70 million of Midway debt to Mark Thomas, a private investor, for $100,000.

In February 2009, Midway Games filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment acquired most of Midway&#x27;s assets, and Midway settled with Mark Thomas to relinquish his Midway stock and debt. The U.S. District Court in Chicago dismissed a lawsuit alleging that former officers of Midway misled shareholders while selling their own stock. In 2010, the bankruptcy court dismissed claims against Redstone concerning his sale of the company to Thomas and approved Midway&#x27;s plan of liquidation. Midway terminated the public registration of its securities on June 9, 2010.

==History==
===Arcade games===
Midway Mfg. Co. began in 1958 as an independent manufacturer of amusement equipment founded by Henry Ross and Marcine Wolverton. It was purchased by Bally in 1969. Bally, at that time, was a leader in the manufacture of slot machines. After some years making mechanical arcade games such as puck bowling and simulated western shoot-out, Midway became an early American maker of arcade video games. Throughout the 1970s, Midway had a close alliance with Japanese video game publisher Taito, with both companies regularly licensing their games to each other for distribution in their respective country.

Meanwhile, Midway&#x27;s breakthrough success came in 1978, with the licensing and distribution of Taito&#x27;s seminal arcade game &quot;Space Invaders&quot; in America. This was followed by Midway&#x27;s licensing and distributing the U.S. version of Namco&#x27;s &quot;Pac-Man&quot; in 1980, and its sequel, &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;, in 1982. Also in 1982, Midway became Bally Midway Mfg. Co. after Bally merged its pinball division with Midway. Three games released that year, including &quot;Satan&#x27;s Hollow&quot;, were the first to feature the Bally/Midway brand. From the late 1970s through the late 1980s, Midway was the leading producer of arcade video games in the United States. In 1983, Bally Midway acquired arcade manufacturing assets of Sega Electronics from Gulf and Western Industries, and through the purchase also gained distribution rights to arcade games developed by Sega Enterprises, Ltd. in the United States for two years which included titles such as &quot;Astron Belt&quot;, &quot;Flicky&quot;, &quot;Future Spy&quot;, and &quot;Up &#x27;N Down&quot;.

Bally Midway was purchased in 1988 by the arcade and pinball game company Williams Electronics Games through its holding company WMS Industries, Inc. and its name was changed back to Midway Manufacturing. Midway moved its headquarters from Franklin Park, Illinois, to Williams&#x27;s then-headquarters in Chicago, and WMS reincorporated Midway as a Delaware corporation. Although WMS retained many R&amp;D employees from the original Midway, only two game designers were retained: &quot;Rampage&quot; designers Brian Colin and Jeff Nauman. WMS obtained the right from Bally to use the &quot;Bally&quot; brand for its pinball games since Bally had completely left the arcade/pinball industry to concentrate on casinos and slot machines.

Under WMS ownership, Midway initially continued to produce arcade games under the Bally/Midway label, while producing pinball machines under the &quot;Bally&quot; brand. In 1991, however, Midway absorbed Williams&#x27; video game division and stopped using the &quot;Bally/Midway&quot; label for its arcade games. In 1992, the company&#x27;s &quot;The Addams Family&quot; machine became the best selling pinball game of all time. In 1996, WMS purchased Time Warner Interactive, which included Atari Games, originally a part of Atari, Inc. Also in 1996, Midway changed its original corporate name, Midway Manufacturing, to Midway Games Inc., due to its entrance in the home console market. This was facilitated by WMS transferring its former home console division, Williams Entertainment, Inc., to Midway. The division had previously been known as Tradewest, which WMS had acquired along with its subsidiary Leland Corporation in 1994. The original arcade division of the company became Midway Amusement Games and the newly created home division was named Midway Home Entertainment.

===Spin-off and home video game focus===
In 1996, WMS made a public offering of Midway stock. At the same time, WMS transferred its video game copyrights and trademarks to Midway while Midway transferred its pinball assets to WMS. In 1998, WMS spun off its remaining 86.8% interest in Midway to the WMS shareholders, making Midway an independent entity for the first time in almost 30 years. Midway kept Atari Games as a wholly owned subsidiary as part of this spin-off. Midway retained or shared some of the WMS executive staff and used some common facilities with WMS for a few more years. Over several years, Midway gradually terminated all material agreements and executive overlap with WMS and had a declining number of common members of its board of directors, until it shared only one with its former parent company.

On December 22, 1999, Midway changed the name of its Atari Games subsidiary to Midway Games West, Inc. to avoid confusion with Atari Interactive. In 2000, its home entertainment division acquired the remaining of Psygnosis&#x27; PlayStation lineup. On June 22, 2001, Midway announced that it was closing its arcade division due to a decline in the arcade market. Midway shut down Midway Games West in February 2003, but it remained as an entity. After losing money each year since 2000, Midway&#x27;s losses accelerated in 2003, as it lost $115 million on sales of about $93 million. Despite these losses, the company was able to finance its business with stock and debt offerings and various credit arrangements. In 2003, Sumner Redstone, a significant minority shareholder since the company&#x27;s spinoff, began to increase his stake in the company and soon owned 80% of the stock.

In 2004, in an effort to expand its market share, Midway began a purchasing spree of independent video game development studios to strengthen its product development teams In April 2004, Midway acquired Surreal Software of Seattle, Washington. In October 2004, it acquired Inevitable Entertainment of Austin, Texas (which became Midway Austin). In December 2004, it acquired Paradox Development of Moorpark, California. On August 4, 2005, Midway acquired privately held Australian developer Ratbag Games. The studio was renamed Midway Studios—Australia. Four months later, on December 13, Midway announced to its employees there that it was shutting the studio down, leaving its employees based at that studio without a job. Two days later, on December 15, the studio was closed and their Adelaide premises emptied. During 2004 and 2005, Midway lost $20 million on sales of $162 million, and $112 million on sales of $150 million, respectively. Redstone voted his shares to elect his daughter Shari Redstone to Midway&#x27;s board of directors and later as the chair of the board.

On February 15, 2005, Midway signed an agreement with Cartoon Network to publish games, based on properties, namely that of Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, and had option to expand their own properties.

Midway was ranked as the No. 4 video game publisher by sales in 2000. It was ranked as the No. 19 video game publisher in 2005 and had fallen to No. 20 in 2006, according to the magazine &quot;Game Developer&quot;.

===Late 2000s and bankruptcy filing===
In 2006 and 2007, Midway lost a further $77 million on sales of $166 million and $100 million on sales of $157 million, respectively. It continued to finance its business with debt offerings and other credit arrangements. As of 2007, Midway Games was engaged in a legal battle with Mindshadow Entertainment for the &quot;Psi-Ops&quot; video game rights. Mindshadow alleged that Midway copied &quot;Psi-Ops&quot;″s story from a screenplay written and owned by their client. On December 2, 2008, Judge Florence-Marie Cooper of the United States District Court for the Central District of California issued a ruling granting summary judgment on all counts in Midway&#x27;s favor. Judge Cooper found no evidence of copyright infringement.

On March 6, 2007, Midway reported that it had entered into a new $90 m credit agreement with National Amusements, a company controlled by Sumner Redstone. Midway&#x27;s CEO, David Zucker, stated that the introduction of &quot;Unreal Tournament 3&quot;, and the company&#x27;s growing success in mass-market games, were setting it up for a &quot;significant 2008&quot;. On March 21, 2008, Zucker resigned as CEO. He was the third executive to resign from the company in three months. Succeeding Zucker as CEO was former Senior Vice President Matt Booty. During the summer of 2008, in an effort to trim costs, Midway closed its Los Angeles and Austin studios. These closures left Midway with four studios, in Chicago, Seattle, San Diego and Newcastle, England. During this time, Midway just released &quot;TNA Impact!&quot; and &quot;&quot; around September/October 2008, under the Midway Studios Los Angeles office (before its closure) and the San Diego branch (Midway Studios San Diego/Midway Home Entertainment). In November 2008, Midway reported that its cash and other resources &quot;may not be adequate to fund... working capital requirements&quot; and that it &quot;would need to initiate cost cutting measures or seek additional liquidity sources&quot;. On November 20, 2008, Midway retained Lazard to assist it &quot;in the evaluation of strategic and financial alternatives&quot;. The next day, Midway received a NYSE delisting notice, after its stock&#x27;s price fell below one dollar. Midway&#x27;s last title, &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;, released around this time, in November 2008.

On December 2, 2008, Sumner Redstone sold his 87 percent stake in Midway Games to Mark Thomas, a private investor, through his company MT Acquisition Holdings LLC. Thomas&#x27;s company paid approximately $100,000, or $0.0012 per share. Thomas also received $70 million of Midway&#x27;s debt that was owed to Redstone. National Amusements took a significant loss on the sale, although the loss allowed it to benefit from tax losses. In December 2008, Midway disclosed that it might default on $240 million of debt after the sale of stock to Thomas triggered clauses in two bond issues totalling $150 million of debt that allowed the bondholders to demand full repayment.

In 2008, Midway lost $191 million on sales of $220 million, and Redstone&#x27;s sale of his shares to Thomas eliminated Midway&#x27;s ability to take advantage of accumulated net operating losses and other tax assets potentially worth more than $700 million. On February 12, 2009, Midway and its U.S. subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The company began to operate as a Debtor in possession. A company spokesperson said, &quot;We felt this was a logical next step for our organization, considering the change in control triggered the acceleration of the repayment options ... we&#x27;re looking to reorganize and to come out on the other side stronger.&quot;

===2009 sales of assets===
Midway announced on May 21, 2009, that it had received a takeover bid from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (now Warner Bros. Games), valued at more than $33 million, to acquire most of the company&#x27;s assets, including Midway&#x27;s Chicago and Seattle studios and rights to the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and &quot;Wheelman&quot; series. The offer did not include the San Diego and Newcastle studios or the &quot;TNA&quot; video game series. Midway had previously worked with Warner Bros. on several games including &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;. Midway announced on May 28, 2009, that it would &quot;accept binding offers up to June 24, 2009, to acquire some or all of the Company&#x27;s assets.&quot; An auction was to be held on June 29, followed by a court hearing to approve the sale to the winning bidder or bidders. However, no other bids were placed for Midway&#x27;s assets, and so the auction was canceled. On July 1, 2009, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of most of the company&#x27;s assets to Warner Bros. subject to the intellectual property claims of a third party, Threshold Entertainment, which produced two &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; films and some other &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; entertainment properties.

On July 8, 2009, Midway disclosed that it intended to close the San Diego studio by September. However, on August 19, 2009, THQ purchased the San Diego studio for $740,000 and extinguished Midway obligations to it. On July 10, 2009, pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement that was approved by the bankruptcy court, Midway agreed to pay to affiliates of its majority owner, Mark Thomas, approximately $4.7 million in full satisfaction of all Midway debt to Thomas and his affiliates, and Thomas and his affiliates granted to Midway&#x27;s Creditors&#x27; Committee an irrevocable proxy to vote his controlled shares of common stock in Midway and forever relinquished the right to vote or dispose of the shares. The settlement reduced Thomas&#x27;s claims by 93 percent, and Midway continued to operate as a Debtor in Possession. Also on July 10, 2009, the sale of assets to Warner Bros. was completed. The total gross purchase price for the sale was approximately $49 million, including receivables, and Warner Bros. assumed liabilities. The sale also triggered payments under Midway&#x27;s Key Employee Incentive Plan of approximately $2.4 million to company executives. The Midway Chicago studio, responsible for the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series and other games, became part of Warner Bros. and was later rebranded NetherRealm Studios.

On July 14, 2009, Midway announced that it had closed the Newcastle studio and terminated 75 employees. On August 19, 2009, Midway sold its French and German subsidiaries to holding companies called Spiess Media Holding UG and F+F Publishing GmbH, respectively. Spiess also purchased Midway&#x27;s London publishing subsidiary on the same day. The European sales resulted in cash proceeds of $1.7 million and the elimination of related intercompany claims. In September 2009, Midway shut down its Chicago headquarters and terminated all but a few of its remaining employees. Many of the former Midway employees at the Chicago studio acquired by Warner Bros. were retained by Warner Bros. On October 2, 2009, Midway and two of its subsidiaries, Midway Home Entertainment and Midway Studios Los-Angeles, sold intellectual property assets, including Midway&#x27;s TNA video game licenses, to SouthPeak Games for $100,000 and the assumption of related liabilities; Midway was no longer selling games and had been disposed of all fixed assets at that time.

===Lawsuits and liquidation===
In October 2009, the U.S. District Court in Chicago dismissed a lawsuit against former officers of Midway alleging that they had misled shareholders while selling their own stock. The judge ruled that Midway&#x27;s shareholders had not shown that the executives &quot;said or did anything more than publicly adopt a hopeful posture that its strategic plans would pay off&quot;. On January 29, 2010, the bankruptcy court dismissed claims brought by Midway creditors for fraud and breach of duty against Sumner Redstone, Shari Redstone and Midway&#x27;s other directors, concerning his 2008 loans to the company and his subsequent sale of his 87% stake in the company to Mark Thomas, which increased Midway&#x27;s net debt and wiped out the company&#x27;s net operating losses and other tax assets. Judge Kevin Gross wrote that his decision was &quot;not an endorsement of any of the defendants&#x27; actions. ... The defendants oversaw the ruin of a once highly successful company, only to hide behind the protective skirt of Delaware law, which the court is bound to apply.&quot; The court permitted other creditor claims to continue.

In February 2010, Midway filed its proposed plan of liquidation with the bankruptcy court. Under the plan, intercompany claims would be extinguished and a partial recovery would be allowed to the unsecured creditors of Midway Games (who held $155 million of claims) to the extent of about 16.5%, and to the unsecured creditors of Midway&#x27;s subsidiaries (who held $36.7 million of claims) of about 25%. Any settlement amount under the lawsuit against National Amusements was to be paid to the two groups of unsecured creditors in the same ratio. Holders of secured and priority claims were to be paid in full, National Amusements would not receive any payment under its Subordinated Loan Agreement, and the equity holders would not receive any payment. On May 21, 2010, the bankruptcy court approved the plan of liquidation. Unsecured creditors of Midway shared approximately $25.5 million, and unsecured creditors of the company&#x27;s subsidiaries shared about $9.2 million. A liquidating trust, administered by Buchwald Capital Advisors LLC as the Trustee, was created to pursue any remaining rights of Midway&#x27;s bankruptcy estate and distribute any proceeds to Midway&#x27;s remaining creditors.

On June 9, 2010, the company filed a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, terminating the public registration of its securities. The creditors&#x27; settlement of their lawsuit against National Amusements, in the total amount of $1 million, was approved by the bankruptcy court on June 21, 2010, ending the outstanding claims against the Redstone family. Since December 2010, the trustee for the liquidating trust of the company, Buchwald Capital Advisors LLC, has filed 57 avoidance actions seeking to recover a total of $2,936,736 in transfers made by Midway to creditors prior to its bankruptcy filing. In March 2011, the court dismissed the adversary proceeding by Threshold Entertainment. All of Midway&#x27;s remaining unsold assets, as well as the subsidiaries of the company itself, were completely dissolved shortly thereafter but the entity remains in existence as of 2025 as a shell company incorporated in Delaware. The Midway Games trademark and logo is currently owned by Warner Bros. upon the sale of Midway&#x27;s assets in 2009.

<text>Tariq Abdul-Wahad (born Olivier Michael Saint-Jean; November 3, 1974) is a French basketball coach and former player. As Olivier Saint-Jean, he played college basketball at Michigan and San Jose State. In 1997, the Sacramento Kings selected Saint-Jean in the first round of the NBA draft as the 11th overall pick, and Saint-Jean converted to Islam and changed his name to Tariq Abdul-Wahad. From 1997 to 2003, Abdul-Wahad played in the NBA for the Kings, Orlando Magic, Denver Nuggets, and Dallas Mavericks. He was the first player to be raised in France and play in the NBA.

==Early life and college years==
Olivier Saint-Jean was born in Maisons-Alfort near Paris. His mother George Goudet was a professional basketball player. His father Quinis Brower was a former Hofstra University and pro basketball player who was drafted by the ABA&#x27;s New York Nets before a professional career in France, playing with the club team Limoges.

After graduating from Lycee Aristide Briand in 1993, Abdul-Wahad first played college basketball for two years at Michigan and transferred to San Jose State in 1995. Abdul-Wahad was part of the San Jose State team that won the 1996 Big West Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament and made the NCAA tournament despite a 13–16 record.

His No. 3 jersey was retired by San Jose State in 2002, however the banner hanging in the Event Center Arena refers to him as Olivier Saint-Jean, the name he used while in college. He changed his name to Tariq Abdul-Wahad after converting to Islam in 1997.

==Professional career==
Abdul-Wahad&#x27;s peak year as a pro was with the Sacramento Kings in the lockout-shortened 1999 NBA season, when he was a starter for the team. They pushed the Utah Jazz to the brink of elimination but lost in the fifth and final game of the series.

He was known as a defensive specialist, but his playing time was restricted in later seasons due to injuries. He only played in 236 out of a possible 624 games between 1997 and 2005. In the whole 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons Abdul-Wahad was on the Dallas Mavericks&#x27; roster on injured reserve, as he was permanently unable to play. He was released by Mavericks on 28 September 2005, during training camp prior to the 2005–06 season. In November 2006 Italian team Climamio Bologna invited Abdul-Wahad to a try out, but he was not signed.

<doc id="430289" wikidata="Q352073" url="?curid=430289" title="Shareef Abdur-Rahim">
<text>Julius Shareef Abdur-Rahim (born December 11, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player who is the president of the NBA G League. Nicknamed Reef, he previously served as the director of player personnel for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the general manager of the Reno Bighorns, the Kings&#x27; minor-league affiliate.

Abdur-Rahim played both the forward and center positions during his career. He emerged as a prospect at Joseph Wheeler High School in his hometown of Marietta, Georgia. Abdur-Rahim played for the California Golden Bears during the 1995–96 season before he entered the 1996 NBA draft. He was selected third overall by the Vancouver Grizzlies where he was the star of the team during his early NBA career. Abdur-Rahim played on the United States men&#x27;s national basketball team that won the gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. He was traded by the Grizzlies in 2001 to the Atlanta Hawks with whom he made his only NBA All-Star appearance in the 2001–02 season. Abdur-Rahim was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers in 2004 before he signed with his last team, the Sacramento Kings, in 2008. Despite the fact that he achieved solid statistics throughout his career, Abdur-Rahim had played the second most games in NBA history without making a playoff appearance (744) until he made the playoffs for the first and only time in 2006. Following persistent injuries to his right knee, Abdur-Rahim announced his retirement from playing basketball in 2008. He finished with the lowest career plus–minus in NBA history at -2,904, a record that still stands as of April 2024.

==Early life==
Shareef Abdur-Rahim is the second eldest sibling in the family of twelve children born to Aminah and William Abdur-Rahim. Abdur-Rahim, whose first name means &quot;noble&quot; and whose last name means &quot;Servant of the Most Merciful One, is a devout Muslim. He values his parents for their guiding influence on him since his youth and credits them with his life philosophy: &quot;remember how you came on all your accomplishments and stay humble.&quot; From an early age, Abdur-Rahim was surrounded by family members who played basketball; his brother, Muhammad, played at the University of Detroit while his late younger brother, Amir, played at Southeastern Louisiana University and coached at the University of South Florida. Abdur-Rahim himself started playing competitive basketball at Joseph Wheeler High School in Marietta, Georgia. At Wheeler, he was named &quot;Mr. Basketball&quot; in back-to-back seasons, and he led the school to a state title as a junior in 1994. In his senior year, Abdur-Rahim averaged 31 points, 12.4 rebounds and 4 blocks per game.

Abdur-Rahim later attended college at the University of California, Berkeley, where he maintained a GPA of 3.5. At California, he averaged 21.1 points per game (ppg) and 8.4 rebounds per game (rpg) in 28 games. He was the first freshman in Pac-10 history to win Conference Player of the Year honors, and was named Third Team All-America by the Associated Press. Also named the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, Abdur-Rahim set single-season freshman records for points, scoring average, field goals, and free throws. After a year at California, however, he decided to leave college to enter the 1996 NBA draft.

==Professional career==

===Vancouver Grizzlies (1996–2001)===
Abdur-Rahim was selected third overall by the Vancouver Grizzlies in the 1996 Draft, behind Allen Iverson and Marcus Camby. He made an immediate impact playing for the Grizzlies, becoming the team&#x27;s leading scorer while setting a franchise record of 18.7 points per game. He also averaged 6.9 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game. On January 11, 1997, Abdur-Rahim scored a season high 37 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in a 109–101 loss against the Kings. He finished third in balloting for the Schick NBA Rookie of the Year behind Philadelphia&#x27;s Allen Iverson and Minnesota&#x27;s Stephon Marbury, and he was picked for the All-Rookie First Team. By the end of the 1996–97 season, Abdur-Rahim led the team in scoring on 33 occasions, rebounding on 23 occasions.

For the next few seasons, Abdur-Rahim remained the centerpiece of the Grizzlies team. In his sophomore season, he averaged 22.3 points, 7.1 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game. The following season, he elevated his performance with 23.0 points, 7.5 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game. On February 17, 1999, Abdur-Rahim scored a then career high 39 points, grabbed 13 rebounds, and recorded 5 assists in a 131-129 triple over time loss against the Celtics. Despite his best efforts, the Grizzlies remained at the bottom two spots of the Midwest Division in his first four seasons. In the 2000–01 season, Abdur-Rahim finished with a 20.5-point average for the fourth straight season and was ranked in the top 20 in 13 NBA statistical categories, once again leading the Grizzlies in both points and rebounds per game. Abdur-Rahim&#x27;s importance to the team was highlighted in a game against the Indiana Pacers on December 1, 2000, when he earned all of the 20 points scored by the Grizzlies in the final quarter of the game.

===Atlanta Hawks (2001–2004)===
On June 27, 2001, the Atlanta Hawks reached an agreement to acquire Abdur-Rahim and the 27th overall pick in the 2001 NBA draft from the Vancouver Grizzlies in exchange for Brevin Knight, Lorenzen Wright and Pau Gasol, the third overall pick in the 2001 NBA Draft. Abdur-Rahim&#x27;s return to his hometown, and expected partnership with sophomore Jason Terry, provided a significant amount of buzz around the league. While the Hawks finished the 2001–02 campaign with a 33–49 win–loss record, Abdur-Rahim&#x27;s performances, including a career-high 50-point game, ensured that he would be selected to the NBA All-Star game for that season.

In his second season with the Hawks, Abdur-Rahim achieved another personal milestone on December 28, 2002, when his jump shot against the Washington Wizards made him the sixth-youngest player in NBA history to reach 10,000-points. Although Glenn Robinson, Jason Terry and Abdur-Rahim combined to average 57.9 points per game and become the highest-scoring trio in the league for the 2002–03 season, the Hawks failed to make the playoffs again. With an average of 19.9 points and 8.4 rebounds per game, Abdur-Rahim played in all but one of the Hawks&#x27; games. By the end of the season, Hawks General Manager Billy Knight decided major changes had to be made for the franchise to move forward, and Abdur-Rahim was traded the next season.

===Portland Trail Blazers (2004–2005)===
Abdur-Rahim was sent, along with Theo Ratliff and Dan Dickau, to the Portland Trail Blazers on February 9, 2004, in exchange for Rasheed Wallace and Wesley Person. His impact in the two seasons with the Trail Blazers was considerably less than in previous seasons. His averages were 16.3 points/7.5 rebounds and 16.8 points/7.3 rebounds for the 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons respectively. At the end of the 2004–05 season, Abdur-Rahim became a free agent.

During the 2005 off-season, he was traded via a sign and trade agreement (in principle) to the New Jersey Nets for a first-round draft pick (which Portland planned to trade to the Phoenix Suns for Leandro Barbosa). On August 4, 2005, though the news conference was planned to announce the postponement of his arrival, it was revealed that he failed a required physical due to scar tissue found in his knee. The trade was put on hold, pending a second opinion from other medical sources. On August 7, Abdur-Rahim was quoted saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t feel I want to be a Net&quot;. He felt the knee was a non-issue, claiming that he never missed a game in his entire career because of the knee injury. Two days later, it was announced that New Jersey decided to rescind the trade.

===Sacramento Kings (2005–2008)===

On August 12, 2005, Abdur-Rahim signed a free-agent contract with the Sacramento Kings. In his first season with them, Abdur-Rahim started in 30 of the 72 games he played. As a starter, he averaged 16.0 points, 6.2 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game. He shot .543 for field goal percentage, and almost .800 from the free throw line. The Kings went on to qualify for the 2006 playoffs. Abdur-Rahim made his postseason career debut against the San Antonio Spurs. At the same time, he ended a streak of having played the most games in NBA history without participating in the post-season. Abdur-Rahim had played the second most games in NBA history without making a playoff appearance (744); he made the playoffs for the first and only time in 2006. In his second season with the Kings, Abdur-Rahim continued to be deployed as a sixth man; however, the Kings failed to secure a playoff berth as Abdur-Rahim recorded 9.9 points per game. The 2007–08 season proved to be Abdur-Rahim&#x27;s last, as he played only six games and his persistent knee injury forced him to announce his retirement on September 22, 2008. He joined the Sacramento Kings&#x27; coaching staff as an assistant the following week. On October 7, 2010, Abdur-Rahim was hired to be the assistant general manager for the Sacramento Kings. He later became the team&#x27;s director of player personnel, a position he held in 2014 after new ownership had taken over in 2013. Abdur-Rahim left the team in September 2014. League sources would later report his departure occurred after the 2014 NBA draft, where Abdur-Rahim had arguments with coach Michael Malone and general manager Pete D&#x27;Alessandro.

==National team career==
Prior to joining the NBA, Abdur-Rahim was the USA&#x27;s leading scorer and rebounder at the 1994 COPABA Junior World Championship Qualifying Tournament held in Argentina. He averaged a double-double of 16.8 points and 10.1 rebounds. While trying for a team high in blocked shots averaging 1.6 blocks per game, he helped push the American squad to an 8–0 record, the gold medal, and a qualifying berth in the 1995 FIBA Junior World Championship. The following May he was named to USA Basketball&#x27;s 1995 Junior Select Team that captured an 86–77 victory over an International Select Team in the inaugural Hoop Summit Game.

While playing for the Grizzlies, Abdur-Rahim was selected as a replacement for the injured Grant Hill to be part of the USA Men&#x27;s basketball team, a team that included several NBA stars such as Kevin Garnett and Tim Hardaway and won the gold medal at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.

<text>Ya&#x27;akov &quot;Kobi&quot; Shimony (Hebrew: יעקב &quot;קובי&quot; שמעוני, born November 13, 1979), generally known by his stage name Subliminal (), is an Israeli rapper, singer and record producer.

==Background==
Subliminal was born in Tel Aviv, Israel to a Persian Jewish mother and Tunisian Jewish father from Gafsa. Subliminal started performing music at age 12, and at age 15 he met Yoav &quot;HaTzel&quot; Eliasi. The two quickly became friends as a result of their mutual love of hip-hop.

In 1995 the two began performing in Israeli clubs geared toward a hip-hop audience, wearing baggy clothes and gold chains. They quickly developed a following among the nation&#x27;s youth, and soon put out their first album, &quot;The Light From Zion&quot;.

After the outbreak of the Second Intifada in 2000, the two began writing patriotic songs. They became known as creators of &quot;Zionist hip-hop&quot;, a label still applied to them. In further contrast to the generally rebellious &quot;outlaw&quot; nature of most hip-hop, they also praise army service and eschew drugs and smoking.

Being the son of Jewish refugees is at the core of Subliminal&#x27;s hard-line politics. &quot;In Tunisia, my father grew up with his family locking all the doors and windows whenever performing a Jewish ceremony -- out of fear of attacks.&quot; Both parents, he says, &quot;ran for their lives&quot; to Israel, where they spent decades recovering from the persecution they had faced.

Subliminal and his rapping partner at the time, Ha&#x27;Tzel (&quot;The Shadow&quot;), also helped discover the Palestinian rapper Tamer Nafar; they collaborated but eventually fell out over Subliminal and Nafar&#x27;s political disagreement. The bitter end of their musical relationship is chronicled in the documentary film, &quot;Channels of Rage&quot;.

In 2006, Subliminal collaborated with countertenor David D&#x27;Or to produce the song &quot;Ten Koah&quot; (&quot;Give Me Strength&quot;) on Subliminal&#x27;s hip hop album, &quot;Just When You Thought it Was Over&quot;.

In 2010, Subliminal married Ines Goldberg.

==Social impact==
Through lyrics and concerts, Subliminal and his rap group aim to inspire and encourage a new generation to stand as a unified Israeli nation. At many of his concerts, Subliminal begins by calling to the audience, &quot;Who is proud to be a Zionist in the state of Israel, put your hands in the air! Hell yeah!&quot; Subliminal can be seen at many of his concerts wearing American hip hop clothing and a large Star of David chain necklace. Journalist Joshua Mitnick writes that with Subliminal&#x27;s patriotic, 2002 chart-topping album &quot;Ha’or v’Ha’tzel&quot; (The Light and the Shadow),
He transformed the Star of David into a fashion statement and helped integrate the music of urban America into the fold of Israeli pop… For Subliminal, the music has generated tens of thousands of record sales. For Israeli teens, it has given voice to their outrage at the state of affairs in their country. Hip-hop, a quintessentially American art form, is helping bolster national morale in a country bruised by… years of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians.

<text>Vampire bats, members of the subfamily Desmodontinae, are leaf-nosed bats currently found in Central and South America. Their food source is the blood of other animals, a dietary trait called hematophagy. Three extant bat species feed solely on blood: the common vampire bat (&quot;Desmodus rotundus&quot;), the hairy-legged vampire bat (&quot;Diphylla ecaudata&quot;), and the white-winged vampire bat (&quot;Diaemus youngi&quot;). Two extinct species of the genus &quot;Desmodus&quot; have been found in North America.

==Taxonomy==
Due to differences among the three species, each has been placed within a different genus, each consisting of one extant species. In the older literature, these three genera were placed within a family of their own, Desmodontidae, but taxonomists have now grouped them as a subfamily, Desmodontinae, in the New World leaf-nosed bat family, Phyllostomidae.

The three known species of vampire bats all seem more similar to one another than to any other species. That suggests that hematophagy evolved only once, and the three species share this common ancestor.

The placement of the three genera of the subfamily Desmodontinae within the New World leaf-nosed bat family Phyllostomidae Gray, 1825, may be summarized as:
* subfamily Desmodontinae
** genus &quot;Desmodus&quot;
*** &quot;Desmodus archaeodaptes&quot;, extinct,
*** &quot;Desmodus draculae&quot;, extinct,
*** &quot;Desmodus rotundus&quot;,
*** &quot;Desmodus stocki&quot;, extinct.
** genus &quot;Diphylla&quot; 
*** &quot;Diphylla ecaudata&quot;
** genus &quot;Diaemus&quot; 
*** &quot;Diaemus youngi&quot;

===Evolution===
Vampire bats are in a diverse family of bats that consume many food sources, including nectar, pollen, insects, fruit and meat.
The three species of vampire bats are the only mammals that have evolved to feed exclusively on blood (hematophagy) as micropredators, a strategy within parasitism.
Hematophagy is uncommon due to the number of challenges to overcome for success: a large volume of liquid potentially overwhelming the kidneys and bladder, the risk of iron poisoning, and coping with excess protein.
There are multiple hypotheses for how vampire bats evolved.
*They evolved from frugivorous bats with sharp teeth specialized for piercing fruit
*They initially fed on the ectoparasites of large mammals, and then progressed to feeding on the mammals themselves (similar to red-billed oxpecker feeding behavior)
*They initially fed on insects that were attracted to the wounds of animals, and then progressed to feeding on the wounds
*They initially preyed on small arboreal vertebrates
*They were arboreal omnivores themselves and began ingesting blood and flesh from wound sites of larger animals
*They were specialized nectar-feeders that evolved to feed on another type of liquid

The vampire bat lineage diverged from its family 26 million years ago. The hairy-legged vampire bat likely diverged from the other two species of vampire bats 21.7 million years ago.
Because the hairy-legged vampire bat feeds on bird blood and it is the most basal of living vampire bats, it is considered likely that the first vampire bats fed on bird blood as well.
Recent analyses suggest that vampire bats arose from insectivores, which discount the frugivore, carnivore, and nectarivore hypotheses of origin. Within 4 million years of diverging from other Phyllostomidae, vampire bats had evolved all necessary adaptations for blood-feeding, making it one of the fastest examples of natural selection among mammals.

==Anatomy and physiology==

Unlike fruit bats, the vampire bats have short, conical muzzles. They also lack a nose leaf, instead having naked pads with U-shaped grooves at the tip.

A vampire bat has front teeth that are specialized for cutting and back teeth that are much smaller than in other bats. The inferior colliculus, the part of the bat&#x27;s brain that processes sound, is well adapted to detecting the regular breathing sounds of sleeping animals that serve as its main food source.

While other bats have almost lost the ability to maneuver on land, vampire bats can walk, jump, and even run by using a unique, bounding gait, in which the forelimbs instead of the hindlimbs are recruited for force production, as the wings are much more powerful than the legs. This ability to run seems to have evolved independently within the bat lineage.

Vampire bats also have a high level of resistance to a group of bloodborne viruses known as endogenous retroviruses, which insert copies of their genetic material into their host&#x27;s genome.

It was recently discovered that the vampire bat&#x27;s loss of the REP15 gene allows for enhanced iron secretion in adaptation to the high iron diet.

===Infrared sensing===

The common vampire bat, &quot;Desmodus rotundus&quot;, has specialized thermoreceptors on its nose, which aid the animal in locating areas of its prey where the blood flows close to the skin. A nucleus has been found in the brain of vampire bats that has a similar position and similar histology to the infrared receptor of infrared-sensing snakes, which are the only other known vertebrates capable of detecting infrared radiation (namely boas, pythons and pit vipers). A recent study has shown that common vampire bats tune a TRP-channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about . This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in dorsal root ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents.

==Ecology and life cycle==
Vampire bats tend to live in colonies in almost completely dark places, such as caves, old wells, hollow trees, and buildings. They range in Central to South America and live in arid to humid, tropical and subtropical areas. Vampire bat colony numbers can range from single digits to hundreds in roosting sites. The basic social structure of roosting bats is made of female groups and their offspring, a few adult males, known as &quot;resident males&quot;, and a separate group of males, known as &quot;nonresident males&quot;. In hairy-legged vampire bats, the hierarchical segregation of nonresident males appears less strict than in common vampire bats. Nonresident males are accepted into the harems when the ambient temperature lowers. This behavior suggests social thermoregulation.

Resident males mate with the females in their harems, and it is less common for outside males to copulate with the females. Female offspring often remain in their natal groups. Several matrilines can be found in a group, as unrelated females regularly join groups. Male offspring tend to live in their natal groups until they are about two years old, sometimes being forcibly expelled by the resident adult males.Vampire bats on average live about nine years when they are in their natural environment in the wild.

Vampire bats form strong bonds with other members of the colony. A related unique adaptation of vampire bats is the sharing of food. A vampire bat can only survive about two days without feeding, yet they cannot be guaranteed of finding food every night. This poses a problem, so when a bat fails to find food, it will often &quot;beg&quot; another bat for food. A &quot;donor&quot; bat may regurgitate a small amount of blood to sustain the other member of the colony. For equally familiar bats, the predictive capacity of reciprocity surpasses that of relatedness. This finding suggests that vampire bats are capable of preferentially aiding their relatives, but that they may benefit more from forming reciprocal, cooperative relationships with relatives and non-relatives alike. Furthermore, donor bats were more likely to approach starving bats and initiate the food sharing. When individuals of a population are lost, bats with a larger number of mutual donors tend to offset their own energetic costs at a higher rate than bats that fed less of the colony before the removal. Individuals that spend their own energy as a social investment of sorts are more likely to thrive, and higher rates of survival incentivize the behavior and reinforce the importance of large social networks in colonies. These findings contradict the harassment hypothesis—which claims that individuals share food in order to limit harassment by begging individuals. All considered, vampire bat research should be interpreted cautiously as much of the evidence is correlational and still requires further testing.

Another ability that some vampire bats possess is identifying and monitoring the positions of conspecifics (individuals of the same species) simply by antiphonal calling. Similar in nature to the sound mother bats make to call to their pups, these calls tend to vary on a bat to bat basis which may help other bats identify individuals both in and outside of their roost.

Vampire bats also engage in social grooming. It usually occurs between females and their offspring, but it is also significant between adult females. Social grooming is mostly associated with food sharing.

==Feeding==

Vampire bats hunt only when it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats, and unlike insectivorous and fish-eating bats, they emit only low-energy sound pulses. The common vampire bat feeds primarily on the blood of mammals (occasionally including humans), whereas both the hairy-legged vampire bat and white-winged vampire bat feed primarily on the blood of birds. Once the common vampire bat locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, it lands and approaches it on the ground while on all fours. It then likely uses thermoception to identify a warm spot on the skin to bite. They then start to lick the area over and over again to make the place tender so that it is easier to bite. They then create a small incision with their teeth and lap up blood from the wound.

Vampire bats, like snakes, have developed highly sensitive thermosensation, with specialized systems for detecting infrared radiation. Snakes co-opt a non-heat-sensitive channel, vertebrate TRPA1 (transient receptor potential cation channel A1), to produce an infrared detector. However, vampire bats tune a channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about , which allows them to sense the target.

As noted by Arthur M. Greenhall: If there is fur on the skin of the host, the common vampire bat uses its canine and cheek teeth like a barber&#x27;s blades to shave away the hairs. The bat&#x27;s razor-sharp upper incisor teeth then make a 7 mm wide and 8 mm deep cut. The upper incisors lack enamel, which keeps them permanently razor sharp. Their teeth are so sharp that even handling their skulls in a museum can result in cuts.

The bat&#x27;s saliva, left in the victim&#x27;s resulting bite wound, has a key function in feeding from the wound. The saliva contains several compounds that prolong bleeding, such as anticoagulants that inhibit blood clotting, and compounds that prevent the constriction of blood vessels near the wound.

===Digestion===
A typical female vampire bat weighs and can consume over 20 grams (1 fluid ounce) of blood in a 20-minute feed. This feeding behavior is facilitated by its anatomy and physiology for rapid processing and digestion of the blood to enable the animal to take flight soon after the feeding.
The stomach and intestine rapidly absorb the water in the blood meal, which is quickly transported to the kidneys, and on to the bladder for excretion. A common vampire bat begins to expel urine within two minutes of feeding.
While shedding much of the blood&#x27;s liquid facilitates flight takeoff, the bat still has added almost 20–30% of its body weight in blood. To take off from the ground, the bat generates extra lift by crouching and flinging itself into the air. Typically, within two hours of setting out in search of food, the common vampire bat returns to its roost and settles down to spend the rest of the night digesting its meal. Digestion is aided by their microbiome, and their genome protects them against pathogens in the blood. Its stool is roughly the same as that from bats eating fruits or insects.

==== Metabolism ====
In a 2024 study published in &quot;Biology Letters&quot;, researchers explored how vampire bats generate energy from their blood meals, hypothesizing that they metabolize amino acids due to their low-carbohydrate and low-fat diet. The team captured two dozen vampire bats in Belize and fed them cow blood enriched with glycine and leucine. After consumption, the bats were placed on a treadmill for up to 90 minutes, during which breath samples were collected to measure oxygen intake and carbon dioxide output. The results revealed that up to 60% of the bats’ energy production during exercise came from the rapid breakdown of these amino acids, revealing their ability to convert proteins into usable energy within ten minutes. Michael Hiller, a researcher at the LOEWE Center for Translational Biodiversity Genomics in Frankfurt, noted that this rapid metabolization of amino acids is &quot;unparalleled in mammals&quot; and described it as a compelling example of convergent evolution, where both vampire bats and blood-feeding insects developed similar strategies to adapt to their extreme diets.

This metabolic specialization presents drawbacks, as vampire bats have diminished their ability to store alternative energy sources, rendering them susceptible to starvation if they experience prolonged periods without feeding. To counteract this vulnerability, vampire bats engage in reciprocal altruism, regurgitating blood to assist conspecifics in need.

==Human health==

===Rabies===
Rabies can be transmitted to humans and other animals by vampire bat bites. Since dogs are now widely immunized against rabies, the number of human rabies transmissions by vampire bats exceeds those by dogs in Latin America, with 55 documented cases in 2005. The risk of infection to the human population is less than to livestock exposed to bat bites. Various estimates of the prevalence of rabies in bat populations have been made; it has been estimated that less than 1% of wild bats in regions where rabies is endemic are infected with the virus at any given time. Bats that are infected may be clumsy, disoriented, and unable to fly.

===Anticoagulant drug===
The unique properties of vampire bat saliva have found some positive use in medicine.

Various studies published in &quot;Stroke: Journal of the American Heart Association&quot; on a genetically engineered drug called desmoteplase which uses the anticoagulant properties of the saliva of &quot;Desmodus rotundus&quot; found that it increased blood flow in stroke patients.

<text>Emmett Louis Till (July 25, 1941 – August 28, 1955) was a 14-year-old African American youth, who was abducted and lynched in Mississippi in 1955 after being accused of offending a white woman, Carolyn Bryant, in her family&#x27;s grocery store. The brutality of his murder and the acquittal of his killers drew attention to the long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. Till posthumously became an icon of the civil rights movement.

Till was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. During summer vacation in August 1955, he was visiting relatives near Money, Mississippi, in the Mississippi Delta region. Till spoke to 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant, the white, married proprietor of a local grocery store. Although what happened at the store is a matter of dispute, Till was accused of flirting with, touching, or whistling at Bryant. Till&#x27;s interaction with Bryant, perhaps unwittingly, violated the unwritten code of behavior for a black male interacting with a white female in the Jim Crow-era South. Several nights after the encounter, Bryant&#x27;s husband Roy and his half-brother J. W. Milam, who were armed, went to Till&#x27;s great-uncle&#x27;s house and abducted Till, age 14. They beat and mutilated him before shooting him in the head and sinking his body in the Tallahatchie River. Three days later, Till&#x27;s mutilated and bloated body was discovered and retrieved from the river.

Till&#x27;s body was returned to Chicago, where his mother insisted on a public funeral service with an open casket, which was held at Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ. It was later said that &quot;The open-coffin funeral held by Mamie Till Bradley exposed the world to more than her son Emmett Till&#x27;s bloated, mutilated body. Her decision focused attention on not only American racism and the barbarism of lynching but also the limitations and vulnerabilities of American democracy.&quot; Tens of thousands attended his funeral or viewed his open casket, and images of Till&#x27;s mutilated body were published in black-oriented magazines and newspapers, rallying popular black support and white sympathy across the United States. Intense scrutiny was brought to bear on the lack of black civil rights in Mississippi, with newspapers around the U.S. critical of the state. Although local newspapers and law enforcement officials initially decried the violence against Till and called for justice, they responded to national criticism by defending Mississippians, giving support to the killers.

In September 1955 an all-white jury found Bryant and Milam not guilty of Till&#x27;s murder. Protected against double jeopardy, the two men publicly admitted in a 1956 interview with &quot;Look&quot; magazine that they had tortured and murdered Till, selling the story of how they did it for $4,000 (). Till&#x27;s murder was seen as a catalyst for the next phase of the civil rights movement. In December 1955, the Montgomery bus boycott began in Alabama and lasted more than a year, resulting eventually in a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that segregated buses were unconstitutional. According to historians, events surrounding Till&#x27;s life and death continue to resonate.

An Emmett Till Memorial Commission was established in the early 21st century. The county courthouse in Sumner was restored and includes the Emmett Till Interpretive Center. 51 sites in the Mississippi Delta are memorialized as associated with Till. The Emmett Till Antilynching Act, an American law which makes lynching a federal hate crime, was signed into law on March 29, 2022, by President Joe Biden.

== Early childhood ==
Emmett Till was born to Mamie and Louis Till on July 25, 1941, in Chicago. Emmett&#x27;s mother, Mamie [née Carthan], was born in the small Delta town of Webb, Mississippi. The Delta region encompasses the large, multi-county area of northwestern Mississippi in the watershed of the Yazoo and Mississippi rivers. When Carthan was two years old, her family moved to Argo, Illinois, near Chicago, as part of the Great Migration of rural black families out of the South to the North to escape violence, lack of opportunity and unequal treatment under the law. Argo received so many Southern migrants that it was named &quot;Little Mississippi&quot;; Carthan&#x27;s mother&#x27;s home was often used by other recent migrants as a way station while they were trying to find jobs and housing.

Mississippi was the poorest state in the U.S. in the 1950s, and the Delta counties were some of the poorest in Mississippi. Mamie Carthan was born in Tallahatchie County, where the average income per white household in 1949 was $690 (). For black families, the figure was $462 (). In the rural areas, economic opportunities for blacks were almost nonexistent. They were mostly sharecroppers who lived on land owned by whites. Blacks had essentially been disenfranchised and excluded from voting and the political system since 1890 when the white-dominated legislature passed a new constitution that raised barriers to voter registration. Whites had also passed ordinances establishing racial segregation and Jim Crow laws.

Mamie largely raised Emmett with her mother; she and Louis Till separated in 1942 after Mamie discovered that he had been unfaithful. Louis later assaulted Mamie, choking her to unconsciousness, to which she responded by throwing scalding water at him. For violating court orders to stay away from Mamie, Louis Till was forced by a judge in 1943 to choose between jail or enlisting in the U.S. Army. In 1945, a few weeks before his son&#x27;s fourth birthday, Louis Till was court-martialed and executed in Italy for the murder of an Italian woman and the rape of two others.

At the age of six, Emmett contracted polio, which left him with a persistent stutter. Mamie and Emmett moved to Detroit, where she met and married &quot;Pink&quot; Bradley in 1951. Emmett preferred living in Chicago, so he returned there to live with his grandmother; his mother and stepfather rejoined him later that year. After the marriage dissolved in 1952, &quot;Pink&quot; Bradley returned alone to Detroit.

Mamie Till-Bradley and Emmett lived together in a busy neighborhood in Chicago&#x27;s South Side near distant relatives. She began working as a civilian clerk for the U.S. Air Force for a better salary. She recalled that Till was industrious enough to help with chores at home, although he sometimes got distracted. Till&#x27;s mother remembered that he did not know his own limitations at times. Following the couple&#x27;s separation, Bradley visited Mamie and began threatening her. At 11 years old, Till, with a butcher knife in hand, told Bradley he would kill him if the man did not leave. Till was typically happy, however. He and his cousins and friends pulled pranks on each other (Till once took advantage of an extended car ride when his friend fell asleep and placed the friend&#x27;s underwear on his head), and they also spent their free time in pickup baseball games. Till was a smart dresser, and was often the center of attention among his peers.

=== Plans to visit relatives in Mississippi ===
In 1955, Mamie Till-Bradley&#x27;s uncle, 64-year-old Mose Wright, visited her and Emmett in Chicago during the summer and told him stories about living in the Mississippi Delta. Emmett wanted to see for himself. Wright planned to accompany Till with a cousin, Wheeler Parker; another cousin, Curtis Jones, would join them soon after. Wright was a sharecropper and part-time minister who was often called &quot;Preacher&quot;. He lived in Money, Mississippi, a small town in the Delta that consisted of three stores, a school, a post office, a cotton gin, and a few hundred residents, north of Greenwood. Before Till departed for the Delta, his mother cautioned him that Chicago and Mississippi were two different worlds, and he should know how to behave in front of white people in the South. Till assured her that he understood.

Statistics on lynchings began to be collected in 1882. Since that time, more than 500 African Americans have been killed by extrajudicial violence in Mississippi alone, and more than 3,000 across the South. Most of the incidents took place between 1876 and 1930; though far less common by the mid-1950s, these racially motivated murders still occurred. Throughout the South, interracial relationships were prohibited as a means to maintain white supremacy. Even the suggestion of sexual contact between black men and white women could carry severe penalties for black men. A resurgence of the enforcement of such Jim Crow laws was evident following World War II, when African-American veterans started pressing for equal rights in the South.

Racial tensions increased after the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s 1954 decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; to end segregation in public education, which it ruled unconstitutional. Many segregationists believed the ruling would lead to interracial dating and marriage. Whites strongly resisted the court&#x27;s ruling; one Virginia county closed all its public schools to prevent integration. Other jurisdictions simply ignored the ruling. In other ways, whites used stronger measures to keep blacks politically disenfranchised, which they had been since the turn of the century. Segregation in the South was used to constrain blacks forcefully from any semblance of social equality.

A week before Till arrived in Mississippi, a black activist named Lamar Smith was shot and killed in front of the county courthouse in Brookhaven for political organizing. Three white suspects were arrested, but they were soon released.

== Encounter between Till and Carolyn Bryant ==
Till arrived at the home of Mose and Elizabeth Wright in Money, Mississippi, on August 21, 1955. On the evening of August 24, Till and several young relatives and neighbors were driven by his cousin Maurice Wright to Bryant&#x27;s Grocery and Meat Market to buy candy. Till&#x27;s companions were children of sharecroppers and had been picking cotton all day. The market mostly served the local sharecropper population and was owned by a white couple, 24-year-old Roy Bryant and his 21-year-old wife Carolyn. 

The facts of what took place in the store are still disputed. Journalist William Bradford Huie reported that Till showed the youths outside the store a photograph of a white girl in his wallet, and bragged that she was his girlfriend. Till&#x27;s cousin Curtis Jones said the photograph was of an integrated class at the school Till attended in Chicago. According to Huie and Jones, one or more of the local boys then dared Till to speak to Bryant. However, in his 2009 book, Till&#x27;s cousin Simeon Wright, who was present, disputed the accounts of Huie and Jones. According to Wright, Till did not have a photo of a white girl, and nobody dared him to flirt with Bryant. Speaking in 2015, Wright said: &quot;We didn&#x27;t dare him to go to the store—the white folk said that. They said that he had pictures of his white girlfriend. There were no pictures. They never talked to me. They never interviewed me.&quot; The FBI report completed in 2006 notes: &quot;[Curtis] Jones recanted his 1955 statements prior to his death and apologized to Mamie Till-Mobley&quot;.

According to both Simeon Wright and Wheeler Parker, Till wolf-whistled at Bryant. Wright said, &quot;I think [Emmett] wanted to get a laugh out of us or something,&quot; adding, &quot;He was always joking around, and it was hard to tell when he was serious.&quot; Wright stated that following the whistle, he became immediately alarmed. &quot;Well, it scared us half to death,&quot; Wright recalled. &quot;You know, we were almost in shock. We couldn&#x27;t get out of there fast enough, because we had never heard of anything like that before. A black boy whistling at a white woman? In Mississippi? No.&quot; Wright stated &quot;The Ku Klux Klan and night riders were part of our daily lives&quot;. Following his disappearance, a newspaper account stated that Till sometimes whistled to alleviate his stuttering. His speech was sometimes unclear; Mamie said he had particular difficulty with pronouncing &quot;b&quot; sounds, and he may have whistled to overcome problems asking for bubble gum. She said that, to help with his articulation, Mamie taught Till how to whistle softly to himself before pronouncing his words.

During the murder trial, Bryant testified that Till grabbed her hand while she was stocking candy and said, &quot;How about a date, baby?&quot; Bryant said that after she freed herself from his grasp, Till followed her to the cash register, grabbed her waist and said, &quot;What&#x27;s the matter baby, can&#x27;t you take it?&quot; Bryant said she freed herself, and Till said, &quot;You needn&#x27;t be afraid of me, baby&quot;, used &quot;one &#x27;unprintable&#x27; word&quot; and said &quot;I&#x27;ve been with white women before.&quot; Bryant also alleged that one of Till&#x27;s companions came into the store, grabbed him by the arm, and ordered him to leave. According to historian Timothy Tyson, Bryant admitted to him in a 2008 interview that her testimony during the trial that Till had made verbal and physical advances was false. Bryant had testified Till grabbed her waist and uttered obscenities but later told Tyson, &quot;that part&#x27;s not true.&quot; As for the rest of what happened, the 72-year-old stated she could not remember. Bryant is quoted by Tyson as saying, &quot;Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him.&quot; However, the tape recordings that Tyson made of the interviews with Bryant do not contain Bryant saying this. In addition, Bryant&#x27;s daughter-in-law, who was present during Tyson&#x27;s interviews, says that Bryant never said it.

Decades later, Simeon Wright also challenged the account given by Carolyn Bryant at the trial. Wright claims he entered the store &quot;less than a minute&quot; after Till was left inside alone with Bryant, and he saw no inappropriate behavior and heard &quot;no lecherous conversation.&quot; Wright said Till &quot;paid for his items and we left the store together.&quot; In their 2006 investigation of the cold case, the FBI noted that a second anonymous source, who was confirmed to have been in the store at the same time as Till and his cousin, supported Wright&#x27;s account.

Author Devery Anderson writes that in an interview with the defense&#x27;s attorneys, Bryant told a version of the initial encounter that included Till grabbing her hand and asking her for a date, but not Till approaching her and grabbing her waist, mentioning past relationships with white women, or having to be dragged unwillingly out of the store by another boy. Anderson further notes that many remarks prior to Till&#x27;s kidnapping made by those involved indicate that it was his remarks to Bryant that angered his killers, rather than any alleged physical harassment. For instance, Mose Wright (a witness to the kidnapping) said that the kidnappers mentioned only &quot;talk&quot; at the store, and Sheriff George Smith only spoke of the arrested killers accusing Till of &quot;ugly remarks&quot;. Anderson suggests that this evidence taken together implies that the more extreme details of Bryant&#x27;s story were invented after the fact as part of the defense&#x27;s legal strategy.

After Wright and Till left the store, Bryant went outside to retrieve a pistol from underneath the seat of a car. Till and his companions saw her do this and left immediately. It was acknowledged that Till whistled while Bryant was going to her car. However, one witness, Roosevelt Crawford, maintained that Till&#x27;s whistle was directed not at Bryant, but at the checkers game that was taking place outside the store.

Carolyn&#x27;s husband, Roy Bryant, was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not return home until August 27. Historian Timothy Tyson said an investigation by civil rights activists concluded Carolyn Bryant did not initially tell her husband Roy Bryant about the encounter with Till, and that Roy was told by a person who frequented their store. Roy was reportedly angry at his wife for not telling him. Carolyn Bryant told the FBI she did not tell her husband because she feared he would assault Till.

== Lynching ==
When Roy Bryant was informed of what had happened, he aggressively questioned several young black men who entered the store. That evening, Bryant, with a black man named J. W. Washington, approached a black teenager walking along a road. Bryant ordered Washington to seize the boy, put him in the back of a pickup truck, and took him to be identified by a companion of Carolyn&#x27;s who had witnessed the episode with Till. Friends or parents vouched for the boy in Bryant&#x27;s store, and Carolyn&#x27;s companion denied that the boy Bryant and Washington seized was the one who had accosted her. Somehow, Bryant learned that the boy in the incident was from Chicago and was staying with Mose Wright. Several witnesses overheard Bryant and his 36-year-old half-brother, John William &quot;J. W.&quot; Milam, discussing taking Till from his house.

In the early morning hours of August 28, 1955, sometime between 2:00 and 3:30 a.m., Bryant and Milam drove to Mose Wright&#x27;s house. Armed with a pistol and a flashlight, he asked Wright if he had three boys in the house from Chicago. Till was sharing a bed with another cousin and there were a total of eight people in the cabin. Milam asked Wright to take them to &quot;the nigger who did the talking.&quot; Till&#x27;s great-aunt offered the men money, but Milam refused as he rushed Emmett to put on his clothes. Mose Wright informed the men that Till was from up north and did not know any better. Milam reportedly then asked, &quot;How old are you, preacher?&quot; to which Wright responded, &quot;64.&quot; Milam threatened that if Wright told anybody, he would not live to see 65. The men marched Till out to the truck. Wright said he heard them ask someone in the car if this was the boy, and heard someone say &quot;yes.&quot; When asked if the voice was that of a man or a woman Wright said that &quot;it seemed like it was a lighter voice than a man&#x27;s.&quot; In a 1956 interview with &quot;Look&quot; magazine, in which they confessed to the killing, Bryant and Milam said they would have brought Till by the store in order to have Carolyn identify him, but stated they did not do so because they said Till admitted to being the one who had talked to her.

Milam and Bryant tied up Till in the back of a green pickup truck and drove toward Money, Mississippi. According to some witnesses, they took Till back to Bryant&#x27;s Groceries and recruited two black men. The men then drove to a barn in Drew, pistol-whipping Till on the way and reportedly knocked him unconscious. Willie Reed, who was 18 years old at the time, saw the truck passing by and later recalled seeing two white men in the front seat, and &quot;two black males&quot; in the back. Some have speculated that the two black men worked for Milam and were forced to help with the beating, although they later denied being present.

Willie Reed said that while walking home, he heard the beating and crying from the barn. Reed told a neighbor and they both walked back up the road to a water well near the barn, where they were approached by Milam. Milam asked if they heard anything. Reed responded, &quot;No.&quot; Others passed by the shed and heard yelling. A local neighbor also spotted &quot;Too Tight&quot; (Leroy Collins) at the back of the barn washing blood off the truck and noticed Till&#x27;s boot. Milam explained he had killed a deer and that the boot belonged to him.

Some have claimed that Till was shot and tossed over the Black Bayou Bridge in Glendora, Mississippi, near the Tallahatchie River. The group drove back to Roy Bryant&#x27;s home in Money, where they reportedly burned Till&#x27;s clothes.

In an interview with William Bradford Huie that was published in &quot;Look&quot; magazine in 1956, Bryant and Milam said that they intended to beat Till and throw him off an embankment into the river to frighten him. They told Huie that while they were beating Till, he called them bastards, declared he was as good as they were and said that he had sexual encounters with white women. They put Till in the back of their truck, and drove to a cotton gin to take a fan—the only time they admitted to being worried, thinking that by this time in early daylight they would be spotted and accused of stealing—and drove for several miles along the river looking for a place to dispose of Till. They shot him by the river and weighted his body with the fan.

Mose Wright stayed on his front porch for 20 minutes waiting for Till to return. He did not go back to bed. Wright and another man went into Money, got gasoline, and drove around unsuccessfully trying to find Till. They had returned home by 8:00 a.m. After hearing from Wright that he would not call the police because he feared for his life, Curtis Jones placed a call to the Leflore County sheriff, and another to his mother in Chicago. Distraught, she called Emmett&#x27;s mother Mamie Till-Bradley. Wright and his wife Elizabeth drove to Sumner, where Elizabeth&#x27;s brother contacted the sheriff.

Bryant and Milam were questioned by Leflore County sheriff George Smith. They admitted they had taken the boy from his great-uncle&#x27;s yard, but claimed they had released him the same night in front of Bryant&#x27;s store. Bryant and Milam were arrested for kidnapping. Word got out that Till was missing, and soon Medgar Evers, Mississippi state field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and Amzie Moore, head of the NAACP&#x27;s Bolivar County chapter, became involved. They disguised themselves as cotton pickers and went into the cotton fields in search of any information that might help find Till.

Three days after his abduction and murder, Till&#x27;s swollen and disfigured body was found by two boys who were fishing in the Tallahatchie River. His head was very badly mutilated: he had been shot above the right ear, an eye was dislodged from the socket, there was evidence that he had been beaten on the back and the hips, and his body weighted by a fan blade fastened around his neck with barbed wire. Till was nude, but wearing a silver ring with the initials &quot;L. T.&quot; and &quot;May 25, 1943&quot; carved in it. His face was unrecognizable due to trauma and having been submerged in water. Mose Wright was called to the river to identify Till. The silver ring that Till was wearing was removed, returned to Wright, and passed on to the district attorney as evidence.

== Funeral and reaction ==
Although lynchings and racially motivated murders had occurred throughout the South for decades, the circumstances surrounding Till&#x27;s murder and the timing acted as a catalyst to attract national attention to the case of a 14-year-old boy who had allegedly been killed for breaching a social caste system. Till&#x27;s murder aroused feelings about segregation, law enforcement, relations between the North and South, the social status quo in Mississippi, the activities of the NAACP and the White Citizens&#x27; Councils, and the Cold War, all of which were played out in a drama staged in newspapers all over the U.S. and abroad.

After Till went missing, a three-paragraph story was printed in &quot;The Greenwood Commonwealth&quot; and quickly picked up by other Mississippi newspapers. They reported on his death when the body was found. The next day, when a picture of him his mother had taken the previous Christmas showing them smiling together appeared in the &quot;Jackson Daily News&quot; and &quot;Vicksburg Evening Post&quot;, editorials and letters to the editor were printed expressing shame at the people who had caused Till&#x27;s death. One read, &quot;Now is the time for every citizen who loves the state of Mississippi to &#x27;Stand up and be counted&#x27; before hoodlum white trash brings us to destruction.&quot; The letter said that Negroes were not the downfall of Mississippi society, but whites like those in White Citizens&#x27; Councils that condoned violence.

Till&#x27;s body was clothed, packed in lime, placed into a pine coffin, and prepared for burial. It may have been embalmed while in Mississippi. Mamie Till-Bradley demanded that the body be sent to Chicago; she later said that she worked to halt an immediate burial in Mississippi and called several local and state authorities in Illinois and Mississippi to make sure that her son was returned to Chicago. A doctor did not examine Till post-mortem.

Mississippi&#x27;s governor, Hugh L. White, deplored the murder, asserting that local authorities should pursue a &quot;vigorous prosecution&quot;. He sent a telegram to the national offices of the NAACP, promising a full investigation and assuring them &quot;Mississippi does not condone such conduct.&quot; Delta residents, both black and white, also distanced themselves from Till&#x27;s murder, finding the circumstances abhorrent. Local newspaper editorials denounced the murderers without question. Leflore County Deputy Sheriff John Cothran stated, &quot;The white people around here feel pretty mad about the way that poor little boy was treated, and they won&#x27;t stand for this.&quot;

However, discourse about Till&#x27;s murder soon became more complex. Robert B. Patterson, executive secretary of the segregationist White Citizens&#x27; Council, used Till&#x27;s death to claim that racial segregation policies were to provide for blacks&#x27; safety and that their efforts were being neutralized by the NAACP. In response, NAACP executive secretary Roy Wilkins characterized the incident as a lynching and said that Mississippi was trying to maintain white supremacy through murder. He said, &quot;there is in the entire state no restraining influence of decency, not in the state capital, among the daily newspapers, the clergy, nor any segment of the so-called better citizens.&quot; Mamie Till-Bradley told a reporter that she would seek legal aid to help law enforcement find her son&#x27;s killers and that the State of Mississippi should share the financial responsibility. She was misquoted; it was reported as &quot;Mississippi is going to pay for this.&quot;

The A. A. Rayner Funeral Home in Chicago received Till&#x27;s body. Upon arrival, Bradley insisted on viewing it to make a positive identification, later stating that the stench from it was noticeable two blocks away. She decided to have an open-casket funeral, saying: &quot;There was just no way I could describe what was in that box. No way. And I just wanted the world to see.&quot; Tens of thousands of people lined the street outside the mortuary to view Till&#x27;s body, and days later thousands more attended his funeral at Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ.

Photographs of Till&#x27;s mutilated corpse circulated around the country, notably appearing in &quot;Jet&quot; magazine and &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;, both black publications, generating intense public reaction. According to &quot;The Nation&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Chicago&#x27;s black community was &quot;aroused as it has not been over any similar act in recent history&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; later selected one of the &quot;Jet&quot; photographs showing Mamie Till over the mutilated body of her dead son, as one of the 100 &quot;most influential images of all time&quot;: &quot;For almost a century, African Americans were lynched with regularity and impunity. Now, thanks to a mother&#x27;s determination to expose the barbarousness of the crime, the public could no longer pretend to ignore what they couldn&#x27;t see.&quot; On September 6, Till was buried at Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.

News about Emmett Till spread to both coasts. Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley and Illinois Governor William Stratton also became involved, urging Mississippi Governor White to see that justice was done. The tone in Mississippi newspapers changed dramatically. They falsely reported riots in the funeral home in Chicago. Bryant and Milam appeared in photos smiling and wearing military uniforms, and Carolyn Bryant&#x27;s beauty and virtue were extolled. Rumors of an invasion of outraged blacks and northern whites were printed throughout the state, and were taken seriously by the Leflore County Sheriff. T. R. M. Howard, a local businessman, surgeon, and civil rights proponent and one of the wealthiest black people in the state, warned of a &quot;second civil war&quot; if &quot;slaughtering of Negroes&quot; were allowed.

Following Roy Wilkins&#x27; comments, white opinion began to shift. According to historian Stephen J. Whitfield, a specific brand of xenophobia in the South was particularly strong in Mississippi. Whites were urged to reject the influence of Northern opinion and agitation. This independent attitude was profound enough in Tallahatchie County that it earned the nickname &quot;The Freestate of Tallahatchie&quot;, according to a former sheriff, &quot;because people here do what they damn well please&quot;, making the county often difficult to govern.

Tallahatchie County Sheriff Clarence Strider, who initially positively identified Till&#x27;s body and stated that the case against Milam and Bryant was &quot;pretty good&quot;, on September 3 announced his doubts that the body pulled from the Tallahatchie River was that of Till. He speculated that the boy was probably still alive. Strider suggested that the recovered body had been planted by the NAACP: a corpse stolen by T. R. M. Howard, who colluded to place Till&#x27;s ring on it. Strider changed his account after comments were published in the press denigrating the people of Mississippi, later saying: &quot;The last thing I wanted to do was to defend those peckerwoods. But I just had no choice about it.&quot;

Bryant and Milam were indicted for murder. The state&#x27;s prosecuting attorney, Hamilton Caldwell, was not confident that he could get a conviction in a case of white violence against a black male accused of insulting a white woman. A local black paper was surprised at the indictment and praised the decision, as did &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The high-profile comments published in Northern newspapers and by the NAACP were of concern to the prosecuting attorney, Gerald Chatham; he worried that his office would not be able to secure a guilty verdict, despite the compelling evidence. Having limited funds, Bryant and Milam initially had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them, but five attorneys at a Sumner law firm offered their services &quot;pro bono&quot;. Their supporters placed collection jars in stores and other public places in the Delta, eventually gathering $10,000 for the defense (about $114,500 in 2023).

== Trial ==
The trial was held in the county courthouse in Sumner, the western seat of Tallahatchie County, because Till&#x27;s body was found in this area. Sumner had one boarding house; the small town was besieged by reporters from all over the country. David Halberstam called the trial &quot;the first great media event of the civil rights movement&quot;. A reporter who had covered the trials of Bruno Hauptmann and Machine Gun Kelly remarked that this was the most publicity for any trial he had ever seen. No hotels were open to black visitors. Mamie Till-Bradley arrived to testify, and the trial also attracted black congressman Charles Diggs from Michigan. Bradley, Diggs, and several black reporters stayed at T. R. M. Howard&#x27;s home in Mound Bayou. Located on a large lot and surrounded by Howard&#x27;s armed guards, it resembled a compound.

The day before the start of the trial, a young black man named Frank Young arrived to tell Howard he knew of two witnesses to the crime. Levi &quot;Too Tight&quot; Collins and Henry Lee Loggins were black employees of Leslie Milam, J. W.&#x27;s brother, in whose shed Till was beaten. Collins and Loggins were spotted with J. W. Milam, Bryant, and Till. The prosecution team was unaware of Collins and Loggins. Sheriff Strider, however, booked them into the Charleston, Mississippi, jail to keep them from testifying.

The trial was held in September 1955 and lasted for five days; attendees remembered that the weather was very hot. The courtroom was filled to capacity with 280 spectators; black attendees sat in segregated sections. Press from major national newspapers attended, including black publications; black reporters were required to sit in the segregated black section and away from the white press, farther from the jury. Sheriff Strider welcomed black spectators coming back from lunch with a cheerful, &quot;Hello, Niggers!&quot; Some visitors from the North found the court to be run with surprising informality. Jury members were allowed to drink beer on duty, and many white male spectators wore handguns.

The defense sought to cast doubt on the identity of the body pulled from the river. They said it could not be positively identified, and they questioned whether Till was dead at all. The defense also asserted that although Bryant and Milam had taken Till from his great-uncle&#x27;s house, they had released him that night. The defense attorneys attempted to prove that Mose Wright—who was addressed as &quot;Uncle Mose&quot; by the prosecution and &quot;Mose&quot; by the defense—could not identify Bryant and Milam as the men who took Till from his cabin. They noted that only Milam&#x27;s flashlight had been in use that night, and no other lights in the house were turned on. Milam and Bryant had identified themselves to Wright the evening they took Till; Wright said he had only seen Milam clearly. Wright&#x27;s testimony was considered remarkably courageous. It may have been the first time in the South that a black man had testified to the guilt of a white man in court—and lived.

Journalist James Hicks, who worked for the black news wire service, the National Negro Publishers Association (later renamed the National Newspaper Publishers Association), was present in the courtroom; he was especially impressed that Wright stood to identify Milam, pointing to him and saying &quot;There he is&quot;, calling it a historic moment and one filled with &quot;electricity&quot;. A writer for the &quot;New York Post&quot; noted that following his identification, Wright sat &quot;with a lurch which told better than anything else the cost in strength to him of the thing he had done&quot;. A reporter who covered the trial for the &quot;New Orleans Times-Picayune&quot; said it was &quot;the most dramatic thing I saw in my career&quot;.

Mamie Till-Bradley testified that she had instructed her son to watch his manners in Mississippi and that should a situation ever come to his being asked to get on his knees to ask forgiveness of a white person, he should do it without a thought. The defense questioned her identification of her son in the casket in Chicago and a $400 life insurance policy she had taken out on him ().

While the trial progressed, Leflore County Sheriff George Smith, Howard, and several reporters, both black and white, attempted to locate Collins and Loggins. They could not, but found three witnesses who had seen Collins and Loggins with Milam and Bryant on Leslie Milam&#x27;s property. Two of them testified that they heard someone being beaten, blows, and cries. One testified so quietly the judge ordered him several times to speak louder; he said he heard the victim call out: &quot;Mama, Lord have mercy. Lord have mercy.&quot; Sheriff Strider testified for the defense of his theory that Till was alive and that the body retrieved from the river was white. A doctor from Greenwood stated on the stand that the body was too decomposed to identify, and therefore had been in the water too long for it to be Till.

Carolyn Bryant was allowed to testify in court, but because Judge Curtis Swango ruled in favor of the prosecution&#x27;s objection that her testimony was irrelevant to Till&#x27;s abduction and murder, the jury was not present. In the event that the defendants were convicted, the defense wanted her testimony on record to aid in a possible appeal.

In the concluding statements, one prosecuting attorney said that what Till did was wrong, but that his action warranted a spanking, not murder. Gerald Chatham passionately called for justice and mocked the sheriff and doctor&#x27;s statements that alluded to a conspiracy. Mamie Bradley indicated she was very impressed with his summation. The defense stated that the prosecution&#x27;s theory of the events the night Till was murdered was improbable, and said the jury&#x27;s &quot;forefathers would turn over in their graves&quot; if they convicted Bryant and Milam. Only three outcomes were possible in Mississippi for capital murder: life imprisonment, the death penalty, or acquittal. On September 23 the all-white, all-male jury (both women and blacks had been banned) acquitted both Milam and Bryant after a 67-minute deliberation; one juror said, &quot;If we hadn&#x27;t stopped to drink pop, it wouldn&#x27;t have taken that long.&quot;

In post-trial analyses, the blame for the outcome varied. Mamie Till-Bradley was criticized for not crying enough on the stand. The jury was noted to have been picked almost exclusively from the hill country section of Tallahatchie County, which, due to its poorer economic make-up, found whites and blacks competing for land and other agrarian opportunities. Unlike the population living closer to the river (and thus closer to Bryant and Milam in Leflore County), who possessed a &quot;noblesse oblige&quot; outlook toward blacks, according to historian Stephen Whitaker, those in the eastern part of the county were virulent in their racism. The prosecution was criticized for dismissing any potential juror who knew Milam or Bryant personally, for fear that such a juror would vote to acquit. Afterward, Whitaker noted that this had been a mistake, as those who knew the defendants usually disliked them. One juror voted twice to convict, but on the third discussion, voted with the rest of the jury to acquit. In later interviews, the jurors acknowledged that they knew Bryant and Milam were guilty, but simply did not believe that life imprisonment or the death penalty were fit punishment for whites who had killed a black man. However, two jurors said as late as 2005 that they believed the defense&#x27;s case. They also said that the prosecution had not proved that Till had died, nor that it was his body that was removed from the river.

In November 1955, a grand jury declined to indict Bryant and Milam for kidnapping, despite their own admissions of having taken Till. Mose Wright and a young man named Willie Reed, who testified to seeing Milam enter the shed from which screams and blows were heard, both testified in front of the grand jury. After the trial, T. R. M. Howard paid the costs of relocating to Chicago for Wright, Reed, and another black witness who testified against Milam and Bryant, in order to protect the three witnesses from reprisals for having testified. Reed, who later changed his name to Willie Louis to avoid being found, continued to live in the Chicago area until his death on July 18, 2013. He avoided publicity and even kept his history secret from his wife until she was told by a relative. Reed began to speak publicly about the case in the PBS documentary &quot;The Murder of Emmett Till&quot;, which was broadcast in 2003.

== Media discourse ==
Newspapers in major international cities as well as religious and socialist publications reported outrage about the verdict and strong criticism of American society, while Southern newspapers, particularly in Mississippi, wrote that the court system had done its job. Till&#x27;s story continued to make the news for weeks following the trial, sparking debate in newspapers, among the NAACP and various high-profile segregationists about justice for blacks and the propriety of Jim Crow society.

In October 1955, the &quot;Jackson Daily News&quot; reported facts about Till&#x27;s father that had been suppressed by the U.S. military. While serving in Italy, Louis Till was court-martialed for the rape of two women and the killing of a third. He was found guilty and executed by hanging by the Army near Pisa in July 1945. Mamie Till-Bradley and her family knew none of this, having been told only that Louis had been killed for &quot;willful misconduct&quot;. Mississippi senators James Eastland and John C. Stennis probed Army records and revealed Louis Till&#x27;s crimes. Although Emmett Till&#x27;s murder trial was over, news about his father was carried on the front pages of Mississippi newspapers for weeks in October and November 1955. This renewed debate about Emmett Till&#x27;s actions and Carolyn Bryant&#x27;s integrity. Stephen Whitfield writes that the lack of attention paid to identifying or finding Till is &quot;strange&quot; compared to the amount of published discourse about his father. According to historians Davis Houck and Matthew Grindy, &quot;Louis Till became a most important rhetorical pawn in the high-stakes game of north versus south, black versus white, NAACP versus White Citizens&#x27; Councils.&quot; In 2016, reviewing the facts of the rapes and murder for which Louis Till had been executed, John Edgar Wideman posited that, given the timing of the publicity about Emmett&#x27;s father, although the defendants had already confessed to taking Emmett from his uncle&#x27;s house, the post-murder trial grand jury refused to even indict them for kidnapping.
Wideman also suggested that the conviction and punishment of Louis Till may have been racially motivated, referring to his trial as a &quot;kangaroo court-martial&quot;.

Protected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam struck a deal with &quot;Look&quot; magazine in 1956 to tell their story to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. The interview took place in the law firm of the attorneys who had defended Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam&#x27;s own attorneys did. Neither attorney had heard their clients&#x27; accounts of the murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more articulate and sure of himself than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till and neither of them believed they were guilty or that they had done anything wrong.
Reaction to Huie&#x27;s interview with Bryant and Milam was explosive. Their brazen admission that they had murdered Till caused prominent civil rights leaders to push the federal government harder to investigate the case. Till&#x27;s murder contributed to congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957: it authorized the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene in local law enforcement issues when individual civil rights were being compromised. Huie&#x27;s interview, in which Milam and Bryant said they had acted alone, overshadowed inconsistencies in earlier versions of the stories. As a consequence, details about others who had possibly been involved in Till&#x27;s abduction and murder, or the subsequent cover-up, were forgotten, according to historians David and Linda Beito.

== Later events ==
Till&#x27;s murder increased fears in the local black community that they would be subjected to violence and the law would not protect them. According to Deloris Melton Gresham, whose father was killed a few months after Till, &quot;At that time, they used to say that &#x27;it&#x27;s open season on n*****s.&#x27; Kill&#x27;em and get away with it.&quot;

After Bryant and Milam admitted to Huie that they had killed Till, the support base of the two men eroded in Mississippi. Many of their former friends and supporters, including those who had contributed to their defense funds, cut them off. Blacks boycotted their shops, which went bankrupt and closed, and banks refused to grant them loans to plant crops. After struggling to secure a loan and find someone who would rent to him, Milam managed to secure and a $4,000 loan to plant cotton, but blacks refused to work for him. Milam was forced to pay whites higher wages.

Eventually, Milam and Bryant relocated to Texas, but their infamy followed them; they continued to generate animosity from locals. In 1961, while in Texas, when Bryant recognized the license plate of a Tallahatchie County resident, he called out a greeting and identified himself. The resident, upon hearing the name, drove away without speaking to Bryant. After several years, they returned to Mississippi.

Milam found work as a heavy equipment operator, but ill health forced him into retirement. Over the years, Milam was tried for offenses including assault and battery, writing bad checks, and using a stolen credit card. He died of spinal cancer on December 31, 1980, at the age of 61.

Bryant worked as a welder while in Texas, until increasing blindness forced him to give up this employment. At some point, he and Carolyn divorced; he remarried in 1980. Bryant opened a store in Ruleville, Mississippi. He was convicted in 1984 and 1988 of food stamp fraud. In a 1985 interview, Bryant denied killing Till despite having admitted to it in 1956, but said: &quot;if Emmett Till hadn&#x27;t got out of line, it probably wouldn&#x27;t have happened to him.&quot; Fearing economic boycotts and retaliation, Bryant lived a private life and refused to be photographed or reveal the exact location of his store, explaining: &quot;this new generation is different and I don&#x27;t want to worry about a bullet some dark night&quot;. He died of cancer on September 1, 1994, at the age of 63.

Mamie Till married Gene Mobley, became a teacher, and changed her surname to Till-Mobley. She continued to educate people about her son&#x27;s murder. In 1992, Till-Mobley had the opportunity to listen while Bryant was interviewed about his involvement in Till&#x27;s murder. With Bryant unaware that Till-Mobley was listening, he asserted that Till had ruined his life, expressed no remorse, and said: &quot;Emmett Till is dead. I don&#x27;t know why he can&#x27;t just stay dead.&quot;

In 1996, documentary filmmaker Keith Beauchamp, who was greatly moved by Till&#x27;s open-casket photograph, started background research for a feature film he planned to make about Till&#x27;s murder. He asserted that as many as 14 people may have been involved, including Carolyn Bryant Donham (who by this point had remarried). Mose Wright heard someone with &quot;a lighter voice&quot; affirm that Till was the one in his front yard immediately before Bryant and Milam drove away with the boy. Beauchamp spent the next nine years producing &quot;The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till&quot;, released in 2003.

That same year, PBS aired an installment of &quot;American Experience&quot; titled &quot;The Murder of Emmett Till&quot;. In 2005, CBS journalist Ed Bradley aired a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report investigating the Till murder, part of which showed him tracking down Carolyn Bryant at her home in Greenville, Mississippi.

A 1991 book written by Stephen J. Whitfield, another by Christopher Metress in 2002, and Mamie Till-Mobley&#x27;s memoirs the next year all posed questions as to who was involved in the murder and cover-up. Federal authorities in the 21st century worked to resolve the questions about the identity of the body pulled from the Tallahatchie River.

In 2004, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that it was reopening the case to determine whether anyone other than Milam and Bryant was involved. David T. Beito, a professor at the University of Alabama, states that Till&#x27;s murder &quot;has this mythic quality like the Kennedy assassination&quot;. The DOJ had undertaken to investigate numerous cold cases dating to the civil rights movement, in the hope of finding new evidence in other murders as well.

Till&#x27;s body was exhumed, and the Cook County coroner conducted an autopsy in 2005. Using DNA from Till&#x27;s relatives, dental comparisons to images taken of Till, and anthropological analysis, the exhumed body was positively identified as that of Till. It had extensive cranial damage, a broken left femur, and two broken wrists. Metallic fragments found in the skull were consistent with bullets being fired from a .45 caliber gun.

In February 2007, a Leflore County grand jury, composed primarily of black jurors and empaneled by Joyce Chiles, a black prosecutor, found no credible basis for Beauchamp&#x27;s claim that 14 people took part in Till&#x27;s abduction and murder. Beauchamp was angry with the finding. David Beito and Juan Williams, who worked on the reading materials for the &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; documentary, were critical of Beauchamp for trying to revise history and taking attention away from other cold cases. The grand jury failed to find sufficient cause for charges against Carolyn Bryant Donham. Neither the FBI nor the grand jury found any credible evidence that Henry Lee Loggins, identified by Beauchamp as a suspect who could be charged, had any role in the crime. Other than Loggins, Beauchamp refused to name any of the people he alleged were involved.

=== Historical markers ===

The first highway marker remembering Emmett Till, erected in 2006, was defaced with &quot;KKK&quot;, and then completely covered with black paint.

In 2007, eight markers were erected at sites associated with Till&#x27;s lynching. The marker at the &quot;River Spot&quot; where Till&#x27;s body was found was torn down in 2008, presumably thrown in the river. A replacement sign received more than 100 bullet holes over the next few years. Another replacement was installed in June 2018, and in July it was vandalized by bullets. Three University of Mississippi students were suspended from their fraternity after posing in front of the bullet-riddled marker, with guns, and uploading the photo to Instagram. As stated by reporter Jerry Mitchell, &quot;It is not clear whether the fraternity students shot the sign or are simply posing before it.&quot; In 2019, a fourth sign was erected. It is made of steel, weighs , is over thick, and is said by its manufacturer to be indestructible.

=== Claim that Carolyn Bryant recanted her testimony ===
In 2017, historian and author Timothy Tyson released details of a 2008 interview with Carolyn Bryant, during which, he alleged, she had disclosed that Bryant had fabricated parts of her testimony at the trial. According to Tyson&#x27;s account of the interview, Bryant retracted her testimony that Till had grabbed her around her waist and uttered obscenities, saying &quot;that part&#x27;s not true&quot;. The jury did not hear Bryant&#x27;s testimony at the trial as the judge had ruled it inadmissible, but the court spectators heard. The defense wanted Bryant&#x27;s testimony as evidence for a possible appeal in case of a conviction. In the 2007 interview, the 72-year-old Bryant said she could not remember the rest of the events that occurred between her and Till in the grocery store. Tyson also reported her as saying: &quot;nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him.&quot; Tyson said that Roy Bryant had been abusive toward Carolyn, and &quot;it was clear she was frightened of her husband.&quot; Tyson believed Bryant embellished her testimony under coercive circumstances. Bryant described Milam as &quot;domineering and brutal and not a kind man&quot;. An editorial in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, regarding Bryant&#x27;s admission that portions of her testimony were false: &quot;This admission is a reminder of how black lives were sacrificed to white lies in places like Mississippi. It also raises anew the question of why no one was brought to justice in the most notorious racially motivated murder of the 20th century, despite an extensive investigation by the F.B.I.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted Wheeler Parker, a cousin of Till&#x27;s, who said: &quot;I was hoping that one day she [Bryant] would admit it, so it matters to me that she did, and it gives me some satisfaction. It&#x27;s important to people understanding how the word of a white person against a black person was law, and a lot of black people lost their lives because of it. It really speaks to history, it shows what black people went through in those days.&quot;

However, the &#x27;recanting&#x27; claim made by Tyson was not on his tape-recording of the interview. &quot;It is true that that part is not on tape because I was setting up the tape recorder&quot; Tyson said. The support Tyson provided to back up his claim, was a handwritten note that he said had been made at the time.

In a report to Congress in March 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice stated that it was reopening the investigation into Till&#x27;s death due to new information. In December 2021, the DOJ announced that it had closed its investigation in the case.

=== Discovery of unserved arrest warrant ===
In June 2022, an unserved arrest warrant for Carolyn Bryant (now known as Carolyn Bryant Donham), dated August 29, 1955, and signed by the Leflore County Clerk, was discovered in a courthouse basement by members of the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation. Following the discovery, Till&#x27;s family called for Donham&#x27;s arrest. However, the district attorney declined to charge Donham, and said that there was no new evidence to reopen the case.

In August 2022, a grand jury concluded there was insufficient evidence to indict Donham.

In December 2022, Bowling Green, Kentucky, canceled its annual Christmas parade scheduled for December 3, 2022, due to threats of violence against groups who planned to protest outside Donham&#x27;s home, an apartment at Shive Lane, Bowling Green. The protests took place peacefully.

=== Carolyn Bryant Donham memoir ===
In 2022, &quot;I Am More Than a Wolf Whistle&quot;, the 99-page memoir of Carolyn Bryant Donham, was copied and given to NewsOne by an anonymous source. The text had been given to the University of North Carolina to privately hold until 2036.

The memoir had been prepared by Donham&#x27;s daughter-in-law Marsha Bryant, who had shared the material with Timothy Tyson, with the understanding that Tyson would edit the memoir. However, Tyson said there had been no such agreement, and placed the memoir at the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill library archives, with access restricted for 20 years or until Donham&#x27;s death.

Donham died on April 25, 2023, at the age of 88.

== Influence on civil rights ==

Till&#x27;s case became emblematic of the injustices suffered by blacks in the South. Myrlie Evers, the widow of Medgar Evers, said years later that the case &quot;struck a spark of indignation that... touched off a world-wide clamor and cast the glare of a world spotlight on Mississippi&#x27;s racism.&quot;

Mamie Till toured the country in one of the NAACP&#x27;s most successful fundraising campaigns ever. Journalist Louis Lomax acknowledges Till&#x27;s death to be the start of what he terms the &quot;Negro revolt&quot;, and scholar Clenora Hudson-Weems characterizes Till as a &quot;sacrificial lamb&quot; for civil rights. NAACP operative Amzie Moore considers Till the start of the Civil Rights Movement, at the very least in Mississippi.

The 1987 Emmy award-winning documentary series &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot;, begins with the murder of Emmett Till. Accompanying written materials for the series, &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; and &quot;Voices of Freedom&quot; (for the second time period), exhaustively explore the major figures and events of the Civil Rights Movement. Stephen Whitaker states that, as a result of the attention Till&#x27;s death and the trial received,

In Montgomery a few months after the murder, Rosa Parks attended a rally for Till, led by Martin Luther King Jr. Soon after, she refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus to a white passenger. The incident sparked a year-long well-organized grassroots boycott of the public bus system. The boycott was designed to force the city to change its segregation policies. Parks later said when she did not get up and move to the rear of the bus, &quot;I thought of Emmett Till and I just couldn&#x27;t go back.&quot;

According to author Clayborne Carson, Till&#x27;s death and the widespread coverage of the students integrating Little Rock Central High School in 1957 were especially profound for younger blacks: &quot;It was out of this festering discontent and an awareness of earlier isolated protests that the sit-ins of the 1960s were born.&quot;After seeing pictures of Till&#x27;s mutilated body, in Louisville, Kentucky, young Cassius Clay (later famed boxer Muhammad Ali) and a friend took out their frustration by vandalizing a local railyard, causing a locomotive engine to derail.

In 1963, Sunflower County resident and sharecropper Fannie Lou Hamer was jailed and beaten for attempting to register to vote. The next year, she led a massive voter registration drive in the Delta region, and volunteers worked on Freedom Summer throughout the state. Before 1954, 265 black people were registered to vote in three Delta counties, where they were a majority of the population. At this time, blacks made up 41% of the total state population. The summer Emmett Till was killed, the number of registered voters in those three counties dropped to 90. By the end of 1955, 14 Mississippi counties had no registered black voters. The Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964 registered 63,000 black voters in a simplified process administered by the project; they formed their own political party because they were closed out of the Democratic Regulars in Mississippi.

== Legacy and honors ==

* A statue was unveiled in Denver in 1976 (and has since been moved to Pueblo, Colorado) featuring Till with Martin Luther King Jr.
* In 1984, a section of 71st Street in Chicago was named Emmett Till Road and in 2005, the 71st street bridge was named in his honor.
* In 1989, Till was included among the 40 names of people who had died in the Civil Rights Movement; they are listed as martyrs on the granite sculpture of the Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama.
* A demonstration for Till was held in 2000 in Selma, Alabama, on the 35th anniversary of the march over the Edmund Pettus Bridge. His mother Mamie Till-Mobley attended and later wrote in her memoirs: &quot;I realized that Emmett had achieved the significant impact in death that he had been denied in life. Even so, I had never wanted Emmett to be a martyr. I only wanted him to be a good son. Although I realized all the great things that had been accomplished largely because of the sacrifices made by so many people, I found myself wishing that somehow we could have done it another way.&quot;
* In 2005, James McCosh Elementary School in Chicago, where Till had been a student, was renamed the Emmett Louis Till Math And Science Academy.
* In 2006, the Emmett Till Memorial Highway was dedicated between Greenwood and Tutwiler, Mississippi; this was the route his body was taken to the train station, to be returned to his mother for burial in Chicago. It intersects with the H. C. &quot;Clarence&quot; Strider Memorial Highway.
* In 2006, the Emmett Till Memorial Commission was established by the Tallahatchie Board of Supervisors
* In 2007, the Emmett Till Memorial Commission issued a formal apology to Till&#x27;s family at an event attended by 400 people. It reads:

We the citizens of Tallahatchie County recognize that the Emmett Till case was a terrible miscarriage of justice. We state candidly and with deep regret the failure to effectively pursue justice. We wish to say to the family of Emmett Till that we are profoundly sorry for what was done in this community to your loved one.
* The same year, Georgia congressman John Lewis sponsored a bill to provide a plan for investigating and prosecuting unsolved (cold case) Civil Rights-era murders. The Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act was signed into law in 2008.
* In 2008, a memorial plaque that was erected in Tallahatchie County, next to the Tallahatchie River at Graball Landing where Till&#x27;s body was retrieved, was stolen and never recovered. The plaque was a &quot;frequent target for racist vandalism&quot;. The location is in a remote area and down a gravel road, meaning that vandals had to go out of the way to get to it. Its replacement was soon also shot up, as was the replacement sign after that. In October 2019, a new bulletproof sign costing over $10,000, and weighing over was installed. In November 2019, a group of white supremacists was caught making a propaganda video in front of the sign raising new concerns that more vandalism was being planned. The group was carrying a white flag with a black St. Andrews cross, a flag commonly used by a racist Neo-Confederate group called the League of the South. The group quickly scattered when they set off alarms designed to protect the sign.
* The Tallahatchie County Courthouse in Sumner, site of the 1955 trial of Till&#x27;s killers, was restored and re-opened in 2012. The Emmett Till Interpretive Center opened across the street and is also serving as a community center.
* The Emmett Till Memorial Project is an associated website and smartphone app to commemorate Till&#x27;s death and his life. It identifies 51 sites in the Mississippi Delta associated with him. On August 29, 2015, the Center held a 60th-anniversary event.
*In 2015, Florida State University Libraries created the Emmett Till archives.
* In 2020, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ, the site of Till&#x27;s funeral, as one of America&#x27;s most endangered historic places.
*In 2022, the U.S. Senate voted to award Till and his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, the Congressional Gold Medal, forwarding the measure for concurrent action in the U.S. House of Representatives. The House passed the measure on December 21, 2022.
*In March 2022, Congress passed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act.
*In October 2022, a bronze statue commemorating Till was unveiled in Greenwood, Mississippi&#x27;s Rail Spike Park, partially funded by the State of Mississippi.
*On July 25, 2023 (Till&#x27;s 82nd birthday), President Biden signed a proclamation establishing the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument which honors Till and his mother. The monument will be managed by the National Park Service, and will preserve three areas related to Emmett Till&#x27;s life and death: Graball Landing in Mississippi, Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ in Chicago, and the Tallahatchie County Second District Courthouse in Mississippi.

=== Casket ===
During a renewed investigation of the crime in 2005, the Department of Justice exhumed Till&#x27;s remains to conduct an autopsy and DNA analysis which confirmed the identification of his body. As required by state reburial law, Till was reinterred in a new casket later that year. In 2009, his original glass-topped casket was found, rusting in a dilapidated storage shed at the cemetery. The casket was discolored and the interior fabric torn. It bore evidence that animals had been living in it, although its glass top was still intact. The Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. acquired the casket a month later.

== Representation in culture ==
Langston Hughes dedicated an untitled poem (eventually to be known as &quot;Mississippi—1955&quot;) to Till in his October 1, 1955, column in &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;. It was reprinted across the country and continued to be republished with various changes from different writers. William Faulkner, a prominent white Mississippi native who often focused on racial issues, wrote two essays on Till: one before the trial in which he pleaded for American unity and one after, a piece titled &quot;On Fear&quot; that was published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; in 1956. In it he questioned why the tenets of segregation were based on irrational reasoning.

Till&#x27;s murder was the focus of a 1957 television episode for the &quot;U.S. Steel Hour&quot; titled &quot;Noon on Doomsday&quot; written by Rod Serling. He was fascinated by how quickly Mississippi whites supported Bryant and Milam. Although the script was rewritten to avoid mention of Till, and did not say that the murder victim was black, White Citizens&#x27; Councils vowed to boycott U.S. Steel. The eventual episode bore little resemblance to the Till case.

Writer James Baldwin loosely based his 1964 drama &quot;Blues for Mister Charlie&quot; on the Till case. He later divulged that Till&#x27;s murder had been bothering him for several years.

Anne Moody mentioned the Till case in her autobiography, &quot;Coming of Age in Mississippi&quot;, in which she states she first learned to hate during the fall of 1955. Audre Lorde&#x27;s poem &quot;Afterimages&quot; (1981) focuses on the perspective of a black woman thinking of Carolyn Bryant 24 years after the murder and trial. Bebe Moore Campbell&#x27;s 1992 novel &quot;Your Blues Ain&#x27;t Like Mine&quot; centers on the events of Till&#x27;s death. Toni Morrison mentions Till&#x27;s death in the novel &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; (1977) and later wrote the play &quot;Dreaming Emmett&quot; (1986), which follows Till&#x27;s life and the aftermath of his death. The play is a feminist look at the roles of men and women in black society, which she was inspired to write while considering &quot;time through the eyes of one person who could come back to life and seek vengeance&quot;. Emmylou Harris includes a song called &quot;My Name is Emmett Till&quot; on her 2011 album, &quot;Hard Bargain&quot;. According to scholar Christopher Metress, Till is often reconfigured in literature as a specter that haunts the white people of Mississippi, causing them to question their involvement in evil, or silence about injustice. The 2021
novel &quot;The Trees&quot; by Percival Everett uses this theme. The 2002 book &quot;Mississippi Trials, 1955&quot; is a fictionalized account of Till&#x27;s death. The 2015 song by Janelle Monáe &quot;Hell You Talmbout&quot; invokes the names of African-American people—including Emmett Till—who died as a result of encounters with law enforcement or racial violence. In 2016 artist Dana Schutz painted &quot;Open Casket&quot;, a work based on photographs of Till in his coffin as well as on an account by Till&#x27;s mother of seeing him after his death.

<text>Sir Walter Nash (12 February 1882 – 4 June 1968) was a New Zealand politician who served as the 27th prime minister of New Zealand in the Second Labour Government from 1957 to 1960. He is noted for his long period of political service, having been associated with the New Zealand Labour Party since its creation.

Nash was born in the West Midlands, England, and is the most recent New Zealand prime minister to be born outside the country. He arrived in New Zealand in 1909, soon joined the original Labour Party, and became a member of the party&#x27;s executive in 1919. Guided to politics by his beliefs in Anglicanism, Christian socialism and pacifism, he gained a reputation for brilliant ability as an organiser and administrator which compensated for a lack of charisma and bouts of indecisiveness.

Nash was elected to the House of Representatives in the Hutt by-election of 1929. He served as the member of Parliament (MP) for the Hutt electorate for 13 consecutive terms, over a period of 38 years and 168 days. As of 2023, he is the fourth-longest serving MP. Appointed as minister of finance in 1935, Nash guided the First Labour Government&#x27;s economic recovery programme during the Great Depression and then directed the government&#x27;s wartime controls. At 14 years he has the longest period of continuous service of any New Zealand minister of finance, and this service included the entire period of World War II. He succeeded Peter Fraser as leader of the Labour Party and leader of the Opposition in 1951. He was from the moderate wing of the Labour Party and was criticised by the left wing of the party for failing to support the strikers during the 1951 Waterfront Dispute, and for not taking stronger action over the controversial exclusion of Māori players from the 1960 rugby tour of South Africa.

In the , the Labour Party won a narrow victory and Nash became prime minister. The Second Labour Government&#x27;s &quot;Black Budget&quot; of 1958, in response to a balance of payments crisis, increased taxes on luxuries such as beer and tobacco. Public hostility toward the budget contributed to Labour&#x27;s heavy defeat in the . Nash was active in international affairs and travelled extensively during his premiership, revising trade terms and supporting aid and development in other nations. Leaving office at 78 years of age, Nash is to date New Zealand&#x27;s oldest prime minister. He died on 4 June 1968 at the age of 86 while still a serving MP, apparently the oldest person to be a serving MP. He was accorded a state funeral, the first in New Zealand for 18 years.

==Early life==
Nash was born on 12 February 1882 in Kidderminster, a town in the English county of Worcestershire. He was born into a poor family and his father was an alcoholic. Nash performed well at school and won a scholarship to King Charles I Grammar School but additional costs associated with attending prevented him from accepting. Nash began employment as a clerk, initially with a lawyer in Kidderminster and then at a factory near Birmingham.

On 16 June 1906, Nash married Lottie May Eaton and established a shop. He became highly active in his community, participating in a large number of societies and clubs. He also attended night school to further his education. However, by 1908 problems began to arise. His wife and son were both ill and a daughter died at birth. In addition an economic recession in the following year seriously harmed his business. The family decided to leave England, settling on New Zealand as a destination.

After arriving in Wellington, in May 1909 Nash became secretary to a local tailor. His wife had two more sons. Nash&#x27;s religious and political beliefs also began to solidify at this point, with the strong Christian faith he received from his mother being merged with a growing belief in socialism. Nash would remain a Christian socialist for the rest of his life, believing that the two components were inseparable. His political opinions were influenced by his friendship with prominent New Zealand socialists such as Michael Joseph Savage, Bob Semple and Harry Holland. Nash also became a committed pacifist. During World War I he made many speeches at the Church of England Men&#x27;s Society stating his reasons for pacifism were faith based and called for understanding with German and Austrian Christians. Despite anti-German sentiment in New Zealand during the war, Nash allowed a German to stay at his home. Due to his open pacifism and friendship with other anti-war activists such as Holland his mail was scrutinised by police looking for evidence on himself and colleagues for sedition or treason.

Nash&#x27;s financial situation deteriorated when the tailor&#x27;s firm that he worked for (and was a shareholder of) declined. Nash and his family moved to Palmerston North where he became a salesman for a wool and cloth merchant. Later he established a tailoring company in New Plymouth along with Bill Besley, a tailor from Stratford, although the business performed poorly.

==Political career==
===Early political career===

Nash had briefly been involved with the first Labour Party, established in 1910, but this association had been interrupted by his financial difficulties. In 1918 however, he helped to establish the New Plymouth branch of the modern Labour Party and he became highly active as secretary of the branch and main organiser for the Labour Party ticket at the 1919 local-body elections. Labour campaigned on borrowing £30,000 to finance council housing which the occupiers were to have a right to purchase, with the rest funded by profits made by the local electric light department. Another pledge was to establish a municipal milk supply. Twenty-six thousand leaflets were printed and distributed by the branch. Nash was a candidate for the borough council himself, but was unsuccessful though did poll the highest of the Labour candidates. The following year Nash was elected to the party&#x27;s national executive.

In 1920 Nash and his wife travelled to Europe, attending various socialist conferences. When they returned to New Zealand in January 1921, Nash was fined for importing &quot;seditious literature&quot;. Despite the reputation that this fine gave him among his fellow socialists, Nash was one of the more moderate members of the Labour Party. In 1922, a year after he had returned to Wellington, Nash was elected national secretary of the Labour Party. After winning the national secretary position he withdrew as Labour&#x27;s candidate for the seat at the upcoming . When he took up the national secretary role he found the party had a total debt of £220. The debt was settled when together with Nash&#x27;s own loan, John Glover (manager of the &quot;Maoriland Worker&quot;) lent some £100 interest free.

Nash is often credited with turning the Labour Party into a fully functioning entity by establishing an efficient organisational structure and paying off the party&#x27;s debts. Following his announcement of &quot;&quot; in the &quot;Maoriland Worker&quot; he worked hard to increase the party&#x27;s membership which grew from 21,000 in 1919 to 45,000 in 1925. The delegates at Labour&#x27;s 1922 annual conference voted to establish a permanent national office which Nash was given the responsibility of doing. Having now set up a centralised location to coordinate party activities and election campaigns was a vital step up to Labour becoming a major political party in New Zealand.

As he had been in New Plymouth, Nash became involved in local politics in Wellington. At the 1927 local elections he stood as a Labour candidate for a seat on the Wellington City Council. He polled well but was not successful. Two years later he contested the Wellington mayoralty for Labour at the 1929 election, but was defeated by the incumbent mayor George Troup.

===Member for Hutt===





Nash stood for election in the electorate in the and s, but was not successful until the . He served the electorate for 13 consecutive terms over a period of 38 years and 168 days which, , makes him New Zealand&#x27;s fourth-longest serving MP. Immediately upon entering Parliament Nash became one of Labour&#x27;s main finance spokesmen. By 1932 he had moved up to the front bench and had become the senior finance spokesman. After entering Parliament, Nash built a house in the electorate he represented. The house, a modest bungalow in St Albans Grove, was completed in 1930 and he lived in the house the rest of his life.

===Minister of Finance===

When Labour, led by Michael Joseph Savage, won the 1935 election Nash was appointed to Cabinet as minister of finance, although he also held a number of more minor positions. His other portfolios were customs, statistics, marketing, revenue and social security. He was ranked third in the First Labour Government, with only Savage and Peter Fraser above him. Nash remained as minister of finance, responsible for the New Zealand Treasury for the next 14 years. As of 2023, he has the longest period of continuous service in that role. Soon after its election the government gave a &quot;Christmas bonus&quot; of £270,000 to the unemployed and needy.

New Zealand&#x27;s economy was in poor shape at the time of Nash&#x27;s appointment as finance minister and he was very busy for the early part of his ministerial career. Nash introduced a number of substantial changes, in an attempt to improve the situation. He reintroduced a graduated land tax at high rates. The land tax (which had been rescinded in October 1931) netted an extra £8 million to fund government spending. He also supervised the nationalisation of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. Although some unemployment persisted, rising export prices helped the government to implement its election policies. The changes in economic policy included restoring wage cuts, expanding pensions, guaranteeing farmers&#x27; prices and revaluation of the currency. In 1936 Nash departed for England to conduct trade negotiations. The negotiations were only partially successful, with an agreement reached over New Zealand&#x27;s meat prices for beef and lamb exports. He also visited other European capitals, particularly Berlin and Moscow, to determine whether there was scope for trade agreements there. He reached a bilateral trade deal with Germany to export butter there. He also went to Copenhagen to study the Danish system of exchange controls, and had further fruitless trade talks in both Paris and Amsterdam.

After returning to New Zealand he became involved in disputes within the Labour Party about economic policy. In particular he was heavily criticised by supporters of the Social Credit movement who wanted their views adopted as Labour Party policy. Nash was also attacked by the more radical socialists in the party who saw Nash&#x27;s pragmatic economic policies as too moderate. However, Nash was supported by both Savage and Fraser and emerged relatively unscathed. He gained the additional responsibility of implementing Labour&#x27;s social security plan. Nash himself had limited involvement in the formulation of Labour&#x27;s economic reform policies, however he was largely responsible for putting them into effect, with other ministers relying on him for his attention to detail.

Immediately following Labour&#x27;s re-election at the 1938 general election New Zealand experienced an exchange crisis with its reserves of sterling funds falling. The orthodox economic response given to the government to call up overdrafts and cut spending to reduce demand and increase unemployment was rejected by the government. Nash instead stated the government would react by introducing exchange controls and import selection which he said in January 1939 would allow the country to maintain its living standards while ensuring the country could live within its income. He was already well familiar with exchange controls systems, having studied the Danish system while in Europe in 1937 and had wished to implement them in New Zealand earlier. Other colleagues (such as John A. Lee and Mark Woolf Silverstone) felt the main reason this decision had been delayed was to not frighten voters too soon ahead of the election with radical economic repositioning. Prime Minister Savage informed the public that exchange controls were introduced to &#x27;insulate&#x27; the country from unfair overseas competition and to encourage industrial development locally.

Nash&#x27;s proposals to control primary produce marketing and restrict imports were strongly criticised abroad. They conflicted with agreements at 1932&#x27;s British Empire Economic Conference and were labelled as &#x27;economic totalitarianism&#x27; by a British Department of Overseas Trade memorandum. In the immediate period before the exchange controls system could be established, borrowing was necessary. Nash returned to Britain in April 1939 to seek loans and to reassure the British government (in vain) that existing British exports would not be harmed. He spent over two months in negotiations with hostile officials who were fearful of losing New Zealand as an export market. Nash attempted to compromise suggesting that British manufacturers could take advantage of import regulations by establishing branch factories in New Zealand. This proposal, that British manufacturers should export themselves rather than their products, was rejected. It was a method by which Nash thought New Zealand could industrialise with minimal need for borrowing. Nash eventually secured a loan of £16 million, but it was subject to very harsh terms, requiring repayment in five annual instalments. Many British newspapers wrote that the terms were &quot;impossibly onerous; indeed blackmailing.&quot;

With loans secured Nash sailed home, stopping in Washington, D.C., &quot;en route&quot; and met with President Franklin D. Roosevelt to discuss defence arrangements in the event of a war. Several days later war was declared between Britain (and New Zealand) against Germany. The British government cabled that it wished to purchase New Zealand&#x27;s entire exportable surplus of meat. The following day they likewise requested to buy New Zealand&#x27;s entire exports of dairy produce. Nash took some quiet ironical satisfaction that the government that had been so hostile to his policies and negotiated so unfairly was now so desperate for the bulk sales it had earlier denied. Over the next few months, New Zealand&#x27;s sterling reserves built up quickly and economic stability was restored. The country was then able to repay the loan from Britain.

The first years of World War II were difficult for the Labour Party, because Savage was seriously ill. Further problems were caused by John A. Lee, a Labour Party member who launched strong attacks on its economic policy. Lee was particularly vicious towards Savage and Nash. Peter Fraser became prime minister after Savage&#x27;s death and Lee was expelled. Nash reluctantly set aside his earlier pacifist beliefs during World War II. Unlike World War I, he deemed this war necessary and inevitable in any case because of the overtly aggressive actions by Germany. Other pacifists were critical of Nash for his change in stance labelling him a hypocrite. Nash retorted that other attempts at peace had been tried and failed, and defeating Germany and its allies by force was the only option left.

Taxes were raised considerably to pay for the war. Income tax in particular was targeted rising from £4.5 million in 1935–36 to £16.5 million in 1941–42. Expenditure for social security was extended by Nash for the poor to offset the cost of the extra wartime taxes. Pension payments were raised in 1941 and the government began to subsidise the prices of basic goods such as bread, sugar and coal. The family benefit was extended to second children in 1940 and to all in 1941 for all families earning less than £5 per week. From May to September 1941 Nash was acting prime minister when Fraser visited New Zealand troops in North Africa. During 1941 the government&#x27;s internal debt rose by £11.8 million to £26 million but while Fraser was abroad he negotiated so that the British government would pay the costs of New Zealand troops serving overseas leading to New Zealand&#x27;s overseas debt reducing. This compensated for the rise in internal debt.

Nash was appointed minister from New Zealand in the United States as New Zealand&#x27;s diplomatic representative in the United States in 1942, but he frequently returned to Wellington to fulfil his role as finance minister. As a result of Nash&#x27;s frequent absences, Geoffrey Cox, the first secretary at the New Zealand Embassy, was &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; for 11 out of the 21 months that he was posted to Washington. Nash was difficult to work for; he was unable to delegate, accumulated files before making a decision, and was inconsiderate of staff.

At the end of the war Nash attended the conferences to create the United Nations and also recommended that New Zealand join the International Monetary Fund. He also travelled as New Zealand&#x27;s representative to several major post-war international conferences concerned with reconstruction, (such as the Bretton Woods Conference and the initial 1948 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade).

By the time of the 1949 election, the Labour government had become increasingly unpopular, partly as a result of industrial strife and inflation. The election was won by the National Party, led by Sidney Holland.

===Leader of the Opposition===

Fraser died shortly after the 1949 election and Nash was elected leader of the Labour Party unopposed. Nash was seen as the likely replacement for Fraser, but his succession was not assured. As acting leader he deliberately brought the leadership election to before the imminent by-election for Fraser&#x27;s seat of Brooklyn. The Brooklyn by-election was to be contested by former cabinet minister and party president Arnold Nordmeyer (who had lost his seat in the 1949 election) and thus Nordmeyer was unable to contest the leadership, as only elected members of the caucus were eligible to stand. Nash&#x27;s decision on the leadership election date caused an argument in caucus, being seen by some as self-motivated, although eventually MPs voted to proceed with the early vote by a majority of two.

The first major test of Nash&#x27;s leadership came with the 1951 waterfront dispute, where major strikes were damaging the economy. Labour&#x27;s position on the matter was seen as indecisive—the party was condemned by many workers for giving them insufficient support but at the same time was condemned by the business community for being &quot;soft&quot; on the communist-influenced unions. Infamously he said &quot;We are not for the waterside workers, and we are not against them&quot; when addressing a large rally in Auckland on 13 May 1951. He was ridiculed for this stance for many years from National, unions and media. Labour suffered badly in the snap election that Holland called in 1951 to reaffirm his mandate. The scale of Labour&#x27;s election loss soon put Nash&#x27;s leadership under pressure.

As Leader of the Opposition Nash is not generally regarded as having been a success. His primary talent appeared to have been in organisation and finance, and not in the inspirational leadership that Savage and Fraser had provided. He was also seen as too slow in coming to decisions. In 1954 several MPs attempted an abortive coup to remove the 71-year-old Nash as leader. They included Rex Mason, Bill Anderton and Arnold Nordmeyer. Nash was told by Mason that a number of members had complained about the leadership of the party to him and that Mason thought that the majority wanted a new leader. In 1954 a majority of the caucus was in favour of a new leader but pressure from the unions and continued support from Party branches allowed Nash to survive the subsequent vote.

The negative press from the leadership challenge was unhelpful to Labour&#x27;s position, but Nash rebounded well heading into the 1954 election. He fought a strong campaign that led to a gain of five seats and virtually levelled the popular vote with National, with a margin of only 0.2% behind. The advent of the new Social Credit Party (which won 11.2% of the vote, but no seats) was seen as a spoiler and it was claimed by Nash that Social Credit denied Labour victory by diminishing the two-party swing. The gains made in the election were seen as sufficient to justify Nash retaining the leadership, despite some murmurs of a surprise challenge to him by either his deputy Jerry Skinner or Nordmeyer. Nash&#x27;s leadership was also bolstered by the talent and energy of new Labour MPs who joined the caucus after the election.

As the National government began to grow more unpopular, Labour regained some of its earlier dynamism. In the 1957 election the party won a narrow victory—41 seats to 39— assisted by its promises of tax rebates and the abolition of compulsory military training. At the age of 75, Nash became prime minister, heading the Second Labour Government.

===Prime minister (1957–1960)===
Nash appointed himself as minister of foreign affairs, minister of Maori affairs and minister of statistics. Immediately upon taking office the Second Labour Government found the country&#x27;s financial situation was much worse than the previous government had admitted. The balance of payments was a serious concern. Nash decided that drastic measures would be necessary to bring the situation back under control. These measures resulted in the so-called &quot;Black Budget&quot;, presented by Arnold Nordmeyer the new minister of finance. The budget included significant tax increases and generated widespread public anger. This was fuelled by the National Party claiming that Nash and Nordmeyer were exaggerating the extent of the problem. The fact that the extra taxes were largely on petrol, cigarettes and beer contributed to the image of Nash&#x27;s government as miserly. While the public and the opposition were scolding of the budget decisions, it was praised by economists for financial discipline and its effectiveness in directly addressing the problem. The situation was exacerbated by Nash&#x27;s frequent absences from the country, leaving Nordmeyer and other Labour ministers to defend the government&#x27;s policies by themselves. Nash&#x27;s habit for accumulating paperwork had not abated and the tables in his office were said to &quot;groan&quot; under the weight of files that had been left awaiting a decision to be made. During his overseas trips, public servants would eagerly go through his office and dig through the &quot;cemetery&quot; of unattended piles of paperwork, retrieving them to pass them on the appropriate ministers for actions to take place.

Nash&#x27;s focus shifted from his previous interests of finance and social welfare to external affairs. His biographer Keith Sinclair explained that &quot;for Nash, by 1958, the great moral issues were not poverty and social security at home but world affairs, peace and war. He meant to make whatever contribution he could to guiding the world to wiser and more moral courses.&quot; He was also well regarded by his peers for his knowledge on geopolitical matters. Australian foreign minister Richard Casey acknowledged Nash as one of the few world leaders who had any broad and balanced grasp of world affairs: &quot;Mr. Nash spoke with authority and other world statesmen were ready to listen; his views were well informed and liberal and, although occasionally he seemed to be lost in visionary speculations, he arrived in the end at a practical, hard-headed and courageous attitude. Nearly all New Zealanders, whatever their party, were proud to have Mr. Nash representing them overseas.&quot;

Nash&#x27;s main effort in foreign affairs was to revise the trade and tariff terms of the 1932 Ottawa agreement, in 1958. He was also a strong supporter of the Colombo Plan and visited many of the New Zealand-funded Colombo Plan projects in Asia and attended the Colombo Plan conference at Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The plan was one of his main interests in foreign policy, with aid and economic development for impoverished peoples appealing to his principles. The Nash government also made progress towards the independence of Western Samoa. Nash had previously shown interest in Samoa during the 1929 uprising when he collected statistics to evidence Labour&#x27;s criticism of the New Zealand government&#x27;s administration of Samoa. Following the work by the Nash government, Samoa gained its independence in 1962.
In April 1960, Nash and his secretary of foreign affairs, Alister McIntosh, visited the Soviet Union where they met Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. Nash proposed that the 1958 moratorium on nuclear testing—observed by the Soviet Union, the US and the UK—be formalised into a permanent ban. However, the Soviet Union resumed tests in 1961. (A partial ban was achieved in 1963.)

In 1960, Nash was criticised for failing to act in the controversy over the rugby tour of South Africa. At the time, South Africa had an apartheid government. On the insistence of the South Africans the New Zealand team included no Māori players, prompting a petition against the tour supported by almost 10% of New Zealanders. Opposition to the tour was led by the Citizens All Black Tour Association (CABTA) in whose view the exclusion of Māori from a national team was a gross act of racial discrimination. Nash had long been an outspoken critic of apartheid and in 1958, after he became prime minister, New Zealand voted against apartheid for the first time at the United Nations. As Nash had personally denounced racism for most of his life it was expected that he would side with the protesters, but he did not. He refused to step in, saying that the matter was for the rugby authorities to decide. In an April 1960 speech Nash defended the decision of the New Zealand Rugby Union stating that it would be unfair to expect Māori to visit South Africa as they would be sure to experience racial discrimination there and also argued that ostracising apartheid would merely accentuate bitterness in South Africa. The decision to exclude Māori from the team to tour South Africa was widely reported and condemned in other countries, having an adverse effect on New Zealand&#x27;s international standing. The domestic political effect was more benign because the opposition National Party was also reluctant to see government interference in the tour. After the tour had ended Nash told the Rugby Union that in future tours it would be desirable for South Africa to accept Māori to avoid a repetition of the controversy. New Zealand did not tour South Africa again until 1970 when Māori players were included.

Against expectations Nash did not appoint a Māori as minister of Māori affairs. Instead, he appointed himself, along with an associate minister Eruera Tirikatene, who had been spokesperson in the portfolio when in opposition. Historian Keith Sinclair wrote that Nash either had reservations about Tirikatene&#x27;s ability or was nervous that a Māori appointed as minister of Māori affairs might favour his own iwi. A previous minister Āpirana Ngata had been accused of this, in a well-remembered scandal. In any case, following Fraser&#x27;s example, Nash believed that the best way to show government commitment to Māori was to lend the &quot;mana&quot; of the office of prime minister to the portfolio. Nash often spoke on marae, frequently repeating his belief that &quot;there were no inferior or superior races&quot;. Nash was concerned at the fragmentation of Māori land interests and appointed a Public Service Commissioner, Jack Hunn, to act as Secretary for Māori Affairs and &quot;get an accounting of Maori assets and see what we can do with them&quot;. This resulted in the famous and contentious &#x27;Hunn report&#x27; on the problems and future of Māori which was completed in August 1960. Nash was preoccupied with winning the coming election, and told Hunn that he would not have time to study it until after the election. The report was left unread and was not implemented until early 1961, when it was published by his successor as Minister of Māori affairs, Ralph Hanan. The Hunn report became the basis of National&#x27;s policy, to the frustration of Nash.

In the , Labour was defeated by the National Party and Nash became leader of the Opposition once again. Nash is the only Labour leader who has served as leader of the Opposition both before and after his tenure as prime minister.

==Later life and career==
By late 1960, Nash was nearly eighty years old. Privately he admitted to confidantes that he had noticed his hearing and memory had deteriorated. The death of his wife in 1961 also took its toll. Gradually, calls for him to retire grew more frequent. Nash, however, refused to step down, partly because of a desire to continue his work, and partly due to a reluctance to see Arnold Nordmeyer succeed him. Initially Nash was planning to announce his retirement as leader at Labour&#x27;s 1962 party conference to clear the way for his deputy Jerry Skinner. By this time the media and public were widely anticipating Skinner to lead Labour at the 1963 election. After Skinner&#x27;s sudden death (only a week before the 1962 conference) Nash had been forced to change his plans. The media speculated that Skinner had died with the knowledge that the party leadership would soon be his and that the caucus had already approved of his succession, however Nash strongly denied the suggestion. Skinner was replaced by Fred Hackett, but Hackett also died before Nash&#x27;s retirement. By June 1962 Nash told the caucus that he would resign at the end of the year unless caucus requested otherwise. At the beginning of the final caucus meeting of the year Nash told caucus that he would resign at a caucus meeting in February and he would not be a candidate for re-election. In February 1963 Nash finally retired as leader of the Labour Party and Nordmeyer was chosen to replace him. Nash was the first Labour leader who did not die in office.

Nash was one of the few New Zealand prime ministers who remained in Parliament a long time after losing power. He became the elder statesman of the house, and was frequently referred to in the press as the &quot;&quot; of New Zealand politics. He continued to speak frequently on foreign affairs and still travelled abroad regularly. In 1963 he went to a Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference in Kuala Lumpur. In January 1964 at the age of 81 (to widespread astonishment) he travelled to Antarctica, flying to McMurdo Sound in an American research plane. It was widely reported in newspapers, claiming that he was the oldest man to have reached the South Pole. In 1966 he sailed to England for a three-month holiday with his sister Emily, his first non-parliamentary visit since 1909.

Despite supporting the government decision in 1963 to send a small non-combatant advisory force to South Vietnam, Nash opposed any military involvement in Vietnam. He became active in the protest movement against the Vietnam War, and denounced the bombing of North Vietnam by the United States. He spoke at many teach-ins on the subject around New Zealand&#x27;s university campuses where he was well received. An old colleague, Ormond Wilson, said that he &quot;had never heard Walter so clear about an issue&quot;. Nash had become unpopular with the left wing because of his responses to the 1951 waterfront dispute and the 1960 rugby tour to South Africa, but his outspokenness in opposition to the war did a great deal to restore his reputation. Nash believed that Labour&#x27;s failure to win the 1966 general election was because of its principled anti-Vietnam war policy, despite voters preferring Labour&#x27;s economic policy to National&#x27;s.

==Death and state funeral==
In late 1966 he spent three weeks in hospital for treatment on his veins following a demanding travel schedule in that year&#x27;s election campaign. In mid-May 1968 he was taken to Hutt Hospital for &quot;observation and rest&quot; and a few days later he had a heart attack. He died on 4 June 1968. At his death he was eulogised positively for his career contributions, particularly in his time as finance minister.

His body lay in state at Parliament House, Wellington, and he was awarded a state funeral, the first since Fraser&#x27;s in 1950. The funeral was held at St James&#x27; Church of England, Lower Hutt. It was broadcast on television, the first funeral in New Zealand to be televised. He was buried in Karori Cemetery alongside his wife. Funds for a children&#x27;s ward at a hospital in Quy Nhon, Vietnam, were raised to serve as a memorial to him. It fitted with a suggestion of his years earlier that New Zealand&#x27;s contribution to the Vietnam War should be providing &quot;hospitals rather than artillery&quot;.

At the time of his death Nash was still a serving MP, though he had already indicated that he intended to retire at the 1969 general election. At 86 years old he is apparently the oldest ever person to be a serving New Zealand MP. His death triggered a by-election which was won by Trevor Young.

==Honours and awards==

In 1935 Nash was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. In 1946 he was appointed to the Privy Council. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 1959 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours and in the 1965 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George. It took him two years to decide whether he would accept a knighthood in conformity with the principles of the Labour Party. After discussing it first with Nordmeyer and then the party executive he accepted, though he twice declined a life peerage and seat in the House of Lords. In 1957 he also received the highest distinction of the Scout Association of Japan, the Golden Pheasant Award. In 1963 he was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws by Victoria University of Wellington.

==Honorific eponyms==
A number of streets and public facilities have been named in honour of Nash, in various towns in New Zealand as well as his birthplace of Kidderminster in England. These include:

*Nash Road, Mount Roskill, Auckland
* In Taitā, Lower Hutt
** Nash Street
** Walter Nash Centre
** Walter Nash Park
** Walter Nash Stadium
* Walter Nash Avenue, Kawerau
* Nash Street, New Plymouth
* Walter Nash Place, Whanganui
* Walter Nash Road East, Kidderminster

==Personal life==

Nash was a cricket enthusiast and played village cricket for the Selly Oak Cricket Club, Birmingham. His interest extended to statistics and he could recite the average scores of many famous cricketers of the day by memory. In his youth Nash was interested in Christian theology. He was an assiduous Anglican church service attendee all his life, but overall held very basic views of Christianity. Likewise he did not believe that Christianity was the only true religion or path and believed in religious tolerance. From the 1930s he was a patron and/or president of sixty-six clubs and societies. They included tennis, boating, cricket, cycling, boxing and basketball clubs as well as amateur actors, Boy Scouts, Red Cross and the Anglican Boys&#x27; Home Society.

He met his wife, Lotty May Eaton, through a mutual friend in the Selly Oak Post Office where she was the head assistant. Lotty was less serious-minded than her husband, and had a natural exuberance which made her good company and an entertaining hostess. Their first child was a son, followed by a daughter who died shortly after birth. After moving to New Zealand two more sons were born. Nash was also a voracious reader and was rarely seen during his leisure time without a book in hand. He disliked swimming, unlike his wife, and he would read whenever he accompanied her while she was swimming.

Nash did not smoke and consumed alcohol in moderation. There are several anecdotes about Nash getting orange juice laced with gin at receptions. When Nordmeyer and Nash were given glasses of orange juice, the teetotal Nordmeyer sipped his and said quietly &quot;I seem to have Mr Nash&#x27;s&quot;. On another social occasion future Prime Minister Robert Muldoon went to take a glass of orange juice, only to be told by the waitress &quot;Oh no, Mr Muldoon, that&#x27;s for Mr Nash. That&#x27;s the one with gin in it.&quot; Keith Sinclair comments that while minister in Washington for 14 months:

[Nash] purchased an excellent cellar from a wealthy man. His cook, Margaret Moore, introduced him to &#x27;old fashioneds&#x27; which, so he pretended, consisted of fruit juice. His taste for good food and drink expanded with opportunity – not that this had been lacking, for instance on his missions in the nineteen-thirties. It was generally supposed in New Zealand that Nash was a &#x27;wowser&#x27;, opposed to such human pleasures. This was so of Fraser, but quite untrue of Nash. He loved his food, and enjoyed good wine and liquor in moderation.

A grandson, J. R. Nash, was elected a member of the Taupo Borough Council in 1971. Nash&#x27;s great-grandson, Stuart Nash, was also an MP from 2008 to 2011 and again from 2014.

<doc id="430318" wikidata="Q3307390" url="?curid=430318" title="Vancouver Grizzlies">
<text>The Vancouver Grizzlies were a Canadian professional basketball team based in Vancouver. The Grizzlies competed in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Midwest Division of the Western Conference. The team was established in 1995, along with the Toronto Raptors, as part of the NBA&#x27;s expansion into Canada. Following the 2000–01 season, the team relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, United States and was renamed the Memphis Grizzlies. The Grizzlies played their home games at General Motors Place (now Rogers Arena) for all of their six seasons in Vancouver.

Like most expansion teams, the Grizzlies struggled in their early years. The team finished last in their division in all but one season (1997-98 Denver Nuggets), and never won more than 30% of its games in any of the team&#x27;s seasons in Vancouver. In total, the team won 101 games, lost 359, and never qualified for the NBA playoffs. The two expansion teams were denied early draft picks in the first season, but the Grizzlies secured Shareef Abdur-Rahim in 1996 and Mike Bibby with the second pick of the 1998 NBA draft. The team continued to lose games despite high draft picks. After they selected Steve Francis as second pick in 1999, he refused to play in Vancouver and was traded away. After the 1998–99 lockout, lower attendance and a weak Canadian dollar caused the owner Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment to lose money on the franchise. After a failed attempt to sell the team to Bill Laurie, it was instead sold to Michael Heisley and subsequently moved to Memphis, Tennessee, for the 2001–02 season.

==History==

===Establishment===
The only former professional basketball team to play in Canada was the Toronto Huskies, who played a single season in 1946–47 before folding. Attempts had been made by Nelson Skalbania, a local entrepreneur, to get an NBA franchise to Vancouver in the 1980s, but had failed. Arthur Griffiths, owner of the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) through Northwest Sports Enterprises, announced in February 1993 that he hoped to bring an NBA franchise to Vancouver. Griffiths was developing a privately owned 20,000-seat arena for the Canucks in downtown Vancouver, which was scheduled for completion for the 1995–96 season. The Toronto Raptors were awarded an expansion franchise for that season on September 30, 1993. On February 14, 1994, the NBA&#x27;s Expansion Committee gave a preliminary approval for Vancouver, with full approval being granted by the Board of Governors on 27 April. Both franchises paid a fee of US$125 million, up from $32.5 million paid during the 1988–89 expansion. The Grizzlies became the NBA&#x27;s 29th franchise.

One hindrance for the expansion was that the NBA wanted the province of British Columbia to abolish wagering on Grizzlies games, specifically by removing the games from the Sports Actions betting. NBA betting accounted for CA$1.56 million in 1993, with the profits going to provincial health care. Similar demands were laid forward in Ontario. There was large public opposition against the league&#x27;s demands. This issue was resolved on February 9, 1994, after the franchise company agreed to donate $500,000 per year to health care.

The company hired Stu Jackson as general manager on 22 July, who was at the time head coach of the University of Wisconsin Badgers and, previously, head coach for the New York Knicks. Jackson started by hiring a scouting department headed by Larry Riley. Original proposals were for the team to be called the Vancouver Mounties, but objections from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police forced the team to find a new name, which was announced on 11 August, named for the bear indigenous to British Columbia. The team colors were announced to be turquoise, bronze and red.

The Grizzlies were the first NBA team to have a website, which was created in 1995 by Bob Kerstein, Chief Information Officer of the Grizzlies at the time. Josh Davis was credited with designing the Vancouver Grizzlies logo in 1995.

To start playing, the team needed to have sold 12,500 season tickets with 50 percent payment prior to January 1, 1995. This was a number higher than that of the Canucks, and both Orlando Magic and Minnesota Timberwolves had seen problems reaching 10,000 during the 1989 expansion. On December 21, 1994, only about 10,000 tickets had been sold when Shoppers Drug Mart purchased the necessary 2,500 tickets to push the team over the limit, in a deal similar to what was necessary in Toronto. On March 7, 1995, the majority of the holding company was sold from Griffiths to Seattle-based John McCaw, Jr. Griffiths and McCaw, Jr. proceeded to create a parent company for the Canucks, Grizzlies and the General Motors Place, which at first was baptized Northwest Entertainment Group, but got renamed in August as Orca Bay Sports and Entertainment. Brian Winters was announced as head coach on 19 June. Winters had spent the past nine seasons as an assistant under Lenny Wilkens with the Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers. Prior to the draft, the team signed free agent Kevin Pritchard, the team&#x27;s first player.

Five days later, the Grizzlies and Raptors attended the 1995 NBA Expansion Draft. Each of the 27 NBA teams could protect eight of their players, and the two expansion teams could select one unprotected player from each team. Vancouver won the coin flip, and opted for a better position in the upcoming draft, allowing the Raptors the first pick. Vancouver&#x27;s first pick was Knicks&#x27; point guard Greg Anthony; other top players were guards Byron Scott and Gerald Wilkins, and swingman Blue Edwards. The team also selected forward Kenny Gattison, center Benoit Benjamin, forward Larry Stewart, Rodney Dent, Antonio Harvey, Reggie Slater, Trevor Ruffin, Derrick Phelps and Doug Edwards.

Both the Canadian teams were hampered by the NBA&#x27;s decision to deny them one of the top five picks in the draft. The teams would not be allowed a top draft pick in the following three seasons, even if they should win the lottery. The teams were also hindered from using their full salary cap the first two seasons. In the first draft, the Grizzlies were sixth and selected center Bryant Reeves. Although a solid player, he failed both at carrying the team and, lacking creative style, did not help draw up attendance.

===Six seasons===
Every year, except the 1998–99 season, the Grizzlies played the Raptors in the pre-season Naismith Cup, held at a neutral venue in Canada. The Grizzlies&#x27; first official contest was against the Portland Trail Blazers; both the first game and the following game against the Timberwolves were won. The team followed up by losing 19 straight games, and later set the NBA single-season record of 23 straight losses in February to April (a record since bested by the Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons and Philadelphia 76ers). The season ended with 15 wins and 67 losses—the .196 winning percentage being the lowest in the whole league. The team saw an average attendance of 17,183 spectators, 14th in the NBA.

Shareef Abdur-Rahim was selected third overall by the Grizzlies in the 1996 NBA draft. The Grizzlies also traded for Anthony Peeler and George Lynch from the Los Angeles Lakers on July 16, 1996. Abdur-Rahim made an immediate impact playing for the Grizzlies, becoming the team&#x27;s leading scorer while setting a franchise record of 18.7 points per game (ppg). He finished third in balloting for the NBA Rookie of the Year and was picked for the NBA All-Rookie First Team. By the end of the 1996–97 season, Abdur-Rahim led the team in scoring on 33 occasions, rebounding on 23 occasions. Despite these acquisitions, Brian Winters was removed as head coach after 43 games of the 1996–97 season, and replaced for the remainder of the season by Stu Jackson. The Grizzlies went on to win only 14 games that season, again the worst in the whole league.

The 1997–98 season saw the hiring of Brian Hill as head coach. In the draft, Vancouver selected Antonio Daniels with the fourth pick. The team traded to get Otis Thorpe for the 2003 first-round draft pick and Sam Mack for Rodrick Rhodes. Both would play a single season for the Grizzlies. The team won 19 games, placing the sixth in the division, ahead of the Denver Nuggets, and 25th overall in the league.

Ahead of the 1998–99 Vancouver Grizzlies season, the Grizzlies signed free agent Cherokee Parks and traded Daniels for the Spurs&#x27; Felipe López and Carl Herrera. In the draft, the Grizzlies selected Mike Bibby with the second overall pick. During the 1998–99 season, Abdur-Rahim elevated his performance with 23.0 ppg, the highest season average of his career. Due to the 1998–99 NBA lockout, the season was reduced to only 50 games. As a result, the league&#x27;s average attendance dropped that season. Vancouver actually registered a slight increase in attendance. This was despite the team finishing with 8 wins and 42 losses, yielding the all-time low winning percentage of .160.

The Grizzlies again had second pick in the 1999 draft. Despite having an all-star caliber point guard in Mike Bibby, they selected Steve Francis. He had hoped to be selected first by the Chicago Bulls, and his managers had several times indicated that he was not interested in playing in Vancouver. He relented and briefly considered joining the Grizzlies, but after an incident at the airport, his manager Jeffrey Fried started trying to get him traded. In what became the biggest deal till then in NBA history, involving eleven players and three teams, Francis and Tony Massenburg were sent to Houston, Michael Smith, Lee Mayberry, Rodrick Rhodes and Makhtar N&#x27;Diaye were sent to Orlando Magic, while the Grizzlies received forwards Othella Harrington and Antoine Carr, guards Michael Dickerson and Brent Price, first- and second-round draft picks and cash. Francis would go on to win the Rookie of the Year Award, and was harassed both verbally and physically by fans when he played in Vancouver.
The 1999–2000 season saw Lionel Hollins take over as coach after 22 games, after Hill had only four wins. The season ended with 22 wins and 60 losses, placing the Grizzlies last in the division. The season also saw a large drop in attendance, averaging 13,899, ranking the team 27th in the league. Hollins was relieved as head coach following the 1999–2000 season. He would later serve two additional stints as head coach of the Grizzlies following their move to Memphis, thus making him head coach of the team on three occasions.

For the 2000–01 season, the team&#x27;s final season in Vancouver, Sidney Lowe was hired as head coach. Forward Stromile Swift was selected as the second-overall pick in the draft. Despite finishing with a franchise-best 23 wins and 59 losses, the team still finished last in the division. The team&#x27;s final home game at GM Place was against the Rockets on April 14, 2001. The team&#x27;s final game as the Vancouver Grizzlies was a 95–81 win against the Golden State Warriors on April 18, 2001.

===Relocation===

Financially, the lockout that occurred in 1998 was the turning point for the team. Attendance plummeted from a league average of 16,108 in the 1997–98 season to 13,899 in the 1999–2000 season, which was the third-lowest in the league. Orca Bay started losing money on operations, in part because of a weak Canadian dollar.

Griffiths sold Orca Bay to Seattle-based John McCaw, Jr. in 1995 and 1996. In September 1999, McCaw announced the sale of the Grizzlies, but not the arena or the Canucks, to NHL&#x27;s St. Louis Blues owner Bill Laurie for US$200 million. He stated that he intended to move the Grizzlies to St. Louis, but the transaction was stopped by the NBA.

Instead, McCaw sold the team to Chicago-based Michael Heisley for US$160 million. At the time he stated that he intended to keep the team in Vancouver, but immediately started a process to find a suitable relocation city in the US. Cities considered for relocation of the team included Memphis, Nashville, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Tampa, Anaheim, San Diego, Buffalo and Louisville. Despite the need for the construction of a new venue to house the team on a permanent basis, Memphis was announced as the recipient city (pending league approval) on March 26, 2001. The NBA Board of Governors approved the move on July 3, 2001.

The last Vancouver Grizzlies player on Memphis&#x27; active roster was Stromile Swift, who last played for the team in the 2007-08 season, though he played for Houston in the 2005–06 season before returning to Memphis. The last active Vancouver Grizzlies player in the NBA was Mike Bibby, who retired after playing for the New York Knicks following the conclusion of the 2011–12 season.

==Uniforms==
The Vancouver Grizzlies&#x27; original uniforms featured Indigenous imagery and red accents on the piping. Home uniforms were white with turquoise letters and black and bronze trim, while road uniforms were turquoise with white letters and black and bronze trim. The front of the uniform featured the full team name from the logo, while the &quot;howling bear&quot; alternate was emblazoned on the left leg. The &quot;ball and claws&quot; logo is also added to the beltline.

In the 1997–98 season, the Grizzlies added a black alternate uniform, featuring only the city name in front and thick turquoise and thin red stripes. Letters were in white with red and turquoise trim. The alternate &quot;G-bear&quot; logo is on the right leg, while the &quot;paw&quot; logo is on the beltline. The &quot;ball and claws&quot; logo was moved below the neckline. This uniform would become the primary for the 2000–01 season. A corresponding white uniform, with the team name and letters in black with red and turquoise trim, was also unveiled that season.

Both original Vancouver Grizzlies uniforms have since been brought back by the current Memphis Grizzlies in the 2019–20 (turquoise) and 2024–25 (white) seasons, as part of the Grizzlies franchise&#x27;s 25th and 30th anniversaries respectively. 

==Venue==
General Motors Place was host to the Vancouver Grizzlies for all of their games before moving to Memphis, Tennessee. The arena has since changed its name to Rogers Arena.

==Season-by-season record==

While in Vancouver, the Grizzlies played in the Midwest Division of the Western Conference.

<text> () is a neo-pagan tradition similar to Wicca, with Italian and Italian American origins. While most practitioners consider to be a distinct tradition from Wicca, some academics consider it to be a form of Wicca or an offshoot. Both have similar beliefs and practices. For example, honors a pantheon centered on a Moon Goddess and a Horned God, similar to Wiccan views of divinity.

Author Raven Grimassi has written on the topic. Grimassi taught what he called the Aridian tradition from 1980. He discusses elements of &#x27;Italian witchcraft&#x27; adopted by Gardnerian Wicca with ideas inspired by Charles G. Leland&#x27;s &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot; (1899). The name &quot;Aradia&quot; (a version of Herodias) is due to Leland, who claimed she was venerated by a &quot;witch-cult&quot; in medieval Tuscany.

==Names==
The word is an archaic Italian word for &quot;witchcraft&quot;, the most used word in modern Italian being . is sometimes referred to as (&quot;the Old Religion&quot;).

==Raven Grimassi==

Raven Grimassi is the pen name of an Italian-American author, born in 1951 as the son of an Italian immigrant who was born and raised in the area of Naples, Italy. He became involved with a coven presenting itself as Gardnerian Wicca in 1969 in San Diego. He is the founder of the Aridian and Arician traditions of Italian-based witchcraft. He stepped down as the directing elder of Arician Witchcraft in 2004. Grimassi currently (as of 2009) lives in Massachusetts and is the directing elder of the Ash, Birch and Willow tradition, and co-director of the Fellowship of the Pentacle. He was formerly co-director of the College of the Crossroads.

His later interest in Neo-paganism began in 1969, and he was initiated into a system claiming to be Gardnerian Wicca in San Diego though the tradition&#x27;s claim eventually proved to be false. Ten years later, Grimassi began teaching the &quot;Aridian Tradition&quot;, which he describes as a &quot;modern system&quot; of Italian Witchcraft or , that he created for non-initiates. Grimassi also studied Kabbalah and other traditions of Wicca such as Brittic and the Pictish-Gaelic system in which he received third degree initiation in 1983 according to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Wicca &amp; Witchcraft&quot;. 

===Views on a historical &quot;religion of witchcraft&quot;===

Grimassi shares in common, in his books, the general &quot;Witch-cult hypothesis&quot; that appears in the writings of Charles G. Leland (&quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot;, 1899), a discredited theory that European witchcraft was the continuation of an ancient pre-Christian religion.

Grimassi describes the roots of as a syncretic offshoot of Etruscan religion that later blended with &quot;Tuscan peasant religion&quot;, medieval Christian heresy, and veneration of saints.
Grimassi views Leland&#x27;s book &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot; as a &quot;Christianized and distorted version&quot; of the original story of Aradia, whom he believes to be a mortal woman named Aradia di Toscano. However, Grimassi does endorse a number of elements from Leland&#x27;s Aradia material, such as the inclusion of a full moon ritual and a sacred meal at the Tregenda, or Sabbat, along with the pantheon of a goddess and god figure.

Grimassi writes that Aradia di Toscano passed on a religion of witchcraft, based on ancient Etruscan paganism, to her followers (whom Grimassi calls &quot;The Triad Clans&quot;). The Triad Clans are referred to as &quot;an alliance of three related Witch Clans known as the Tanarra, Janarra, and Fanarra&quot;.

===Claims of family tradition===
Reports that Grimassi claims to belong to a &quot;family tradition&quot; of religious witchcraft has attracted criticism. Grimassi responds by saying that, although he wrote about such a family tradition, he intentionally never specifically mentions his own family in his books, but that Llewellyn&#x27;s marketing department designed text depicting him as being raised in a family tradition . Grimassi does not deny being the bearer of a family lineage but chooses to protect the privacy of his family by not mentioning or referencing specific members (hence his use of a pseudonym).

Sabina Magliocco, who has criticized some of Grimassi&#x27;s claims, does point out that &quot;Grimassi never claims to be reproducing exactly what was practiced by Italian immigrants to North America; he admits Italian-American immigrants &quot;have adapted a few Wiccan elements into their ways&quot;. After personally meeting Grimassi, Magliocco writes in her letter to the Pomegranate Reader&#x27;s Forum: 
I had the pleasure of meeting Raven Grimassi during the summer of 2001, unfortunately after the final draft of my article had already been submitted to &quot;The Pom&quot;. He was very gracious and helpful to me. From information he revealed during our interview, I can say with reasonable certainty that I believe him to have been initiated into a domestic tradition of folk magic and healing such as I describe in my article.Grimassi&#x27;s tradition centers around a duotheistic pair of deities that are regarded as divine lovers, and they may go by many different names, including: Uni and Tagni, Tana and Tanus, Diana and Dianus, Jana and Janus, and more.
According to Grimassi some Stregheria rituals take place in a circle, with an altar facing North. Ritual actions include prayer, and the blessing of food.

In comparing Stregheria to Wicca, Grimassi notes both similarities between the two and differences. He has defended his material as being significantly different from Wicca at the roots level, and asserts that many of the foundational concepts in Gerald Gardner&#x27;s Wicca can be found earlier in works on Italian Witchcraft and ancient Mediterranean mystery sects.

==Academics==
Some academics, such as Ethan Doyle White, consider Stregheria to be an offshoot of Wicca. Professor of anthropology and religion Sabina Magliocco has described Stregheria as &quot;a religion similar to Wicca in structure and practice, with Italian flavor added through the names of deities, spirits, and sabbats.&quot;

<text>Thomas George Bonney (27 July 1833 – 10 December 1923) was an English geologist, president of the Geological Society of London.

==Career==
Bonney was born in Rugeley, Staffordshire, England, the eldest son of the Reverend Thomas Bonney, headmaster of Rugeley Grammar School. His uncle was the Australian explorer Charles Bonney, and one of his brothers, Frederic Bonney, is remembered for his photography and ethnology in Australia. Thomas was educated at Uppingham School and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he graduated as 12th wrangler in 1856, and was ordained in the following year.

From 1856 to 1861 he was mathematical master at Westminster School, and he pursued geology only as a recreational activity, mainly in Alpine regions. In 1868 he was appointed tutor at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge and lecturer in geology. His attention was specially directed to the study of the igneous and metamorphic rocks in Alpine regions and in various parts of England (e.g.: the Lizard in Cornwall, at Salcombe and in the Charnwood Forest), Wales and the Scottish Highlands.

From 1877 to 1901 he was professor of geology in University College London. He became secretary and later president of the Geological Society of London (1884–1886), and also a fellow; secretary of the British Association (1881–1885) and its president for the year 1910–1911; president of the Mineralogical Society. He was president of the Alpine Club, 1881–1883. In 1887, Bonney was appointed honorary canon of Manchester.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 6 June 1878. He died in Cambridge on 10 December 1923. Lake Bonney in Antarctica is named after him.

==Publications==
His purely scientific works are:
* &quot;Cambridgeshire Geology&quot; (1875)
* &quot;The Story of our Planet&quot; (1893)
* &quot;Charles Lyell and Modern Geology&quot; (1895)
* &quot;Ice Work, Past and Present&quot; (1896)
* &quot;Volcanoes&quot; (1899).

In addition to many papers published in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society and Geological Magazine, he wrote several popular works on Alpine Regions, on English and Welsh scenery, as well as on theological subjects.

<doc id="430323" wikidata="Q1031028" url="?curid=430323" title="Franklin (TV series)">
<text>Franklin is an animated preschool educational children&#x27;s television series, based on the &quot;Franklin the Turtle&quot; books by Brenda Clark and Paulette Bourgeois, and co-produced by Nelvana Limited. It was followed up by a CGI adaptation, &quot;Franklin and Friends&quot;.

The animated series has also produced several television films: &quot;Franklin and the Green Knight&quot; (2000), &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Magic Christmas&quot; (2001) and &quot;Back to School with Franklin&quot; (2003), alongside a theatrical movie: &quot;Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure&quot; (2006), all of which were co-produced by Nelvana Limited.

==Premise==
&quot;Franklin&quot; follows the eponymous growing young anthropomorphic turtle (specifically a tortoise - which is a subgroup of turtles - a species which belong to the order Testudines or Chelonia, reptiles having bodies encased in a bony shell).

His television stories and books always begin, &quot;(Franklin) could count by twos and tie his shoes&quot;. He goes to school, lives in a small village called Woodland with his friends, and has many adventures playing and learning in the world around him, sometimes with the helping hand of an adult such as his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Turtle. Franklin likes swimming, arts and crafts (especially drawing), and loves shoofly pie. He&#x27;s been known to be afraid of the dark and thunderstorms. Franklin has a best friend named Bear, as well as a blue blanket and a blue plush dog with shorter purple ears named Sam. In earlier seasons, he sleeps with his blanket and Sam. When Franklin is scared by thunderstorms, Sam and his blue blanket help keep him calm because he might otherwise panic or have a meltdown.

==Episodes==


==Setting and characters==
The main character of the series is Franklin Turtle. All episodes and films focus on Franklin. Almost all events are presented directly from his point of view, with some exceptions. There are no stories in which Franklin is absent, but sometimes, other characters may take more of a focus.

Franklin&#x27;s family includes his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Turtle, and his younger sister, Harriet. Mr. and Mrs. Turtle are presented as gentle, loving parents who provide direction and guidance for Franklin and reasonable discipline when needed. His sister, Harriet, was born in the film &quot;Franklin and the Green Knight&quot; and was featured in stories in the fifth and sixth seasons of the program. Franklin&#x27;s extended family includes his paternal grandmother, who lives nearby, and his maternal grandparents, who live on a remote farm (as shown in &quot;Franklin’s Magic Christmas&quot;). Franklin’s paternal grandfather never appears in the series and is assumed to be deceased. 

In the film &quot;Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure&quot;, his paternal aunt Lucy and her goddaughter Sam chose to settle in Woodland, as well. Sam has parents but they let her stay in Woodland so she could visit her Godmother, Lucy. In the CGI series, his paternal Aunt Teeny (&quot;Aunt T&quot; or &quot;Aunt Turtle&quot;) is introduced. In later episodes, Franklin&#x27;s maternal aunt and uncle and his maternal cousin are introduced.

Franklin&#x27;s best friend is Bear, who is a bear who loves to eat and, in later seasons, has a sister named Beatrice. His other close friend is Snail, a garden snail who considers Franklin his best friend. One of Franklin&#x27;s other friends who appears most often in the series is Beaver. Franklin&#x27;s other friends who appear most often in the series are Goose, Rabbit, Fox, Badger, Raccoon, and Skunk. Mr. Owl is Franklin&#x27;s primary teacher, but was temporarily replaced by Miss Koala in the film &quot;Back to School with Franklin&quot; when Mr. Owl was called away on a family emergency.

Goose&#x27;s family includes a mother and father who are revealed to be divorced in &quot;Franklin and Friends&quot;. Goose&#x27;s large family, as seen in &quot;Franklin Migrates,&quot; includes her paternal grandmother (who is called Granny) and her maternal grandfather (who is called Grandpa), her maternal aunt and uncle, and her younger maternal cousin, Giselle.

Other characters are seen on the show with less frequency—sometimes appearing in just a few episodes.

===Woodland===
Franklin and his friends live in Woodland, a small animal-resident village in eastern North America. The village is small enough that most residents know one another and meet regularly. There is a small shopping district, roads (with every bit of traffic), and at least one community schoolhouse. It is implied that Woodland is located in the Canadian province of Manitoba; however, this has never been officially confirmed by the show&#x27;s creators. Residents of Woodland include:

* Turtle Household – Franklin, his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Turtle, and Harriet.
* Granny Turtle – Franklin&#x27;s paternal grandmother who talks a lot and has a nice attic.
* Grandma Jenny Turtle - Franklin’s maternal grandmother who has lived her entire life on Faraway Farm. 
* Grandpa Turtle - Grandma Jenny’s husband and Franklin&#x27;s maternal grandfather.
* Great-Grandpa Turtle – Shown once on Franklin&#x27;s Magic Christmas when Grandma Jenny was telling a story about him.
* Great-Grandma and Great-Grandpa Turtle – The parents of Granny who died in a wildfire. Great-Grandma was a great berry picker, and Great-Grandpa was a great fisherman.
* Oakwood School – The schoolhouse in Woodland where Mr. Owl works and Franklin goes to school.
* James Turtle – The Legal Father/Stepfather of Grandfather Turtle, The Legal Father-in-law of Grandma Jenny Turtle, The Legal Grandfather/Step-Grandfather of Mrs. Turtle, and The Legal Great-Grandfather/Step-Great-Grandfather of Franklin and Harriet. James Died
* Ivana Turtle – The Mother of Grandfather Turtle, The Mother-in-law of Grandma Jenny Turtle, The Paternal Grandmother of Elizabeth Turtle, and The Great-Grandmother of Franklin and Harriet. She Was Married To James and Bricklin
* Bricklin Turtle – The Biological Father of Grandfather Turtle, The Father-in-law of Grandma Jenny Turtle, The Paternal-Biological Grandfather of Elizabeth Turtle, and The Great-Grandfather of Franklin and Harriet. Grandfather Turtle Is Bricklin&#x27;s Biological Son.
* Shopping District – Woodland is known for its substantial shopping district, which includes an ice cream shop, Mr. Mole&#x27;s hardware store, a pharmacy, a grocery market, a coffee shop, a bookstore, and more. Franklin and his friends sometimes travel here with their parents, with each other, or even by themselves.
* Tree Fort - A treehouse Franklin&#x27;s friends built in the episode &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Fort&quot;. At the time, Franklin was afraid of heights, but he overcame his fear at the end of the episode after he helped a tiny bird. Franklin and his friends would then use it for their activities and to hang out. In the episode &quot;Franklin Plays It Safe&quot;, it broke due to falling out of its tree when the branch holding it broke. However, a new one was built at the end.
* Pond – Franklin and his friends often hang out by the pond, which is attached to a stream. They sometimes swim, sit by the pond, or participate in other activities.
*Woods – Woodland is surrounded by forests on at least one end. A character named Gopher, who appeared in the film &quot;Franklin and the Green Knight&quot;, is known to live here. Franklin and Snail had an adventure here in &quot;Franklin and the Green Knight&quot;. They explored deep into the woods, where they met several characters and found magic cherry blossoms.
* Oakwood Ravine – Located within the woods and connected distantly to the playground. The only area in Woodland that is shown to add poison ivy.
* Nature Trail – The Nature Trail has a picnic ground, the Monarch Meadow, and the Blueberry Hill Lookout. Franklin and Bear went on a hiking trip on the trail once. They expected to find monarch butterflies in the meadow but found caterpillars instead. There is also a pond here. Franklin and Bear try to skip stones across the pond, but the stones sink.
* Village Park – Kids go skateboarding here.
* Playground – For the little kids, such as Harriet and Beatrice. It has a slide, swings, and monkey bars. Harriet, Kit, and Beatrice all enjoy playing here.
* Tamarack Play Park – An amusement park never seen on the program but is referenced. When Franklin is unable to travel there with all his friends, he creates &quot;Turtle Play Park&quot;.
* Faraway Farm – The farm far away from Woodland, where Franklin&#x27;s maternal grandparents live. Franklin and his family spend Christmas here with his maternal grandparents in the special episode &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Magic Christmas&quot;.
* Turtle Lake – An area featured only in the TV special &quot;Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure&quot;. Franklin&#x27;s Granny lived in this area but lost her home and parents in a fire.
* Woodland Town Hall – The Woodland Town Hall hosts the production of &quot;Sleeping Beauty,&quot; which Franklin and his class play in &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Starring Role”.
* Thrill Hill – A steep hill that the older kids in town like to skateboard down. Franklin accidentally skateboards down it and is dared to do it again. At first, he agrees but does not take the dare.
* Blueberry Hill – A hill within a nature park with the most extensive view of the village and its surroundings when the sky is not too cloudy. The name may be a reference to the song.

===Sports and games===
Baseball is seen more often in earlier seasons, with only sporadic appearances in later episodes. Hockey and soccer are favoured as sports to play. Once, when Franklin and Bear went to sign up for football, spaces had run out, so they were signed up for basketball instead.

Owing to the show&#x27;s Canadian roots, ice hockey has an important place in the &quot;Franklin&quot; universe. It is featured in several stories, including one in which Skunk is taught how to play by Franklin and Bear. Franklin also meets a couple of his professional hockey icons in the fifth and sixth seasons of the program.

In addition to sports, the characters enjoy many games and activities. Franklin becomes his school&#x27;s chess champion. Harriet and Beatrice enjoy playing tag and hide-and-seek. Franklin and his friends enjoy playing knights.

==Production==
===Development===
The development design of Franklin the Turtle for the animated series character, was the achievement of Canadian Animation artist and Illustrator Kurt Lehner, which he worked on during his time at Nelvana studio in 1997. These designs were studies taken directly from the Franklin the Turtle book series itself. Though Lehner did not continue to work with the &quot;series&quot; design team which was hired after the development process, at that time he was given the privilege of also designing Beaver, Rabbit, and Skunk as well.

In May 2004, new episodes of the series began airing on the Canadian network Treehouse TV. Franklin and many of his friends had new voice actors in these new adventures, including actor Grant Eubanks. Many of the show&#x27;s strongest writers and staff members remained on board, however. These new stories saw Franklin facing a flood, worrying about the old treehouse, and earning a badge in a group called the Woodland Trailblazers. For the sixth season Funbag and other animation studios joined in the development of Franklin. The most recent film in the series is &quot;Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure&quot;. The film was written by John van Bruggen and directed by Dominique Monféry. The 76-minute film premiered in theaters in 2006 and had its debut on Noggin on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2007, as part of a celebration of the network&#x27;s conversion to a 24/7 format.

===Format===
&quot;Franklin&quot; is traditionally animated with some computer aid, especially in the later seasons. &quot;Franklin&quot; is closed-captioned.

&quot;Franklin&quot; mostly aired with two 11-minute stories, except on CBC in Canada, which splits the stories apart and shows one at a time. The &quot;Franklin&quot; DVD and video releases include individual stories grouped together as part of a theme, rather than complete episodes. Unlike many animated children&#x27;s programs, &quot;Franklin&quot; has no interstitial segments or end-tags featuring the characters. The scenes shown in the animated opening introduction were changed after the show&#x27;s first season. Many of these scenes featured Otter, a character who left the series early in the first season and was only seen once more in later seasons.

Differences in the colouring of the cartoon can be spotted from season to season. The more recent feature films, most noticeably &quot;Back to School with Franklin&quot; have a somewhat different look from the television series. The film &quot;Franklin and the Turtle Lake Treasure&quot; had considerably higher production values, with more colour differentiation between the other turtles, higher quality animation, an overall brighter look, and prettily painted backgrounds.

==Release==
===Broadcast===
In Canada, the series aired on CBC Television, Family Channel, and Treehouse TV.

In the United States, it aired on CBS as part of their Saturday-morning &quot;CBS Kidshow&quot; block from October 3, 1998 to January 2, 1999.

It also aired on Nickelodeon as part of the Nick Jr. programming block from January 11, 1999, to July 30, 2004. It aired on the Noggin channel from October 4, 1999, until September 25, 2009, and returned to Noggin on August 26, 2015, after the brand was relaunched as a streaming service. It was available on the Noggin streaming service until September 30, 2018. It also aired on the Nick Jr. Channel from September 28, 2009, until June 14, 2013. Seven years later, it moved to Qubo and aired from January 1 (New Year&#x27;s Day), 2021, until February 26 of that same year when some affiliates abruptly switched that night to other Katz networks, two days before others were switched automatically at the end of the same second month&#x27;s last day at the master control level, at which point the network ceased operations.

In Australia, it aired on ABC.

In The Arab World, it aired on Spacetoon from 2004 to 2015.

===Home media===

==Reception==

The show was well-received by critics and parents. Joly Herman of Common Sense Media stated in a review, &quot;Franklin is a show that takes for granted respect for elders and vice versa. There&#x27;s no whining, fighting, yelling, provocation, or aggravation. Franklin ultimately sets a good example of responsible TV programming, and it is a rare show that celebrates the innocence of childhood.&quot;

==In other media==

===Books and movies===
&quot;Franklin&quot; television stories are mostly based on books in the original Franklin Adventure series. The practice of adapting television stories from books was dropped in the program&#x27;s second season, though elements and dialogue from some of the books are incorporated into later stories. Although, many Franklin television stories have been made into books in the Franklin TV Storybook and Franklin First Readers series. Usually written by Sharon Jennings, these adaptations are shortened versions of what is seen on TV and may contain non-canon material.

On September 11, 2000, Franklin&#x27;s younger sister Harriet was introduced in the direct-to-video and DVD movie &quot;Franklin and the Green Knight&quot;. The two shared an adventure on November 24, 2001, in &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Magic Christmas&quot;. &quot;Back to School with Franklin&quot; was released direct-to-video on August 19, 2003, which involved Harriet befriending Beaver&#x27;s younger brother Kit, and new character Mrs. Koala introduced as a teacher to Franklin and his friends.

===Live tours===
&quot;Franklin&quot; has been seen in numerous touring stage shows, including &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Big Adventure,&quot; &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Class Concert,&quot; &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Family Christmas Concert,&quot; and &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Carnival Of Animals.&quot; Produced by Koba Entertainment and presented by Paquin Entertainment, these stage shows featured a number of songs including &quot;Come See the World,&quot; &quot;What I Do in the Morning&quot; and &quot;The Dinosaur Song&quot;.

In 2009, a new touring show, &quot;Franklin and The Adventures of the Noble Knights&quot;, was developed, and is currently touring in France. The show is also produced by Koba Entertainment, and presented by Paquin Entertainment. The Director/Choreographer is Patti Caplette. This show toured in Canada in 2010. A soundtrack CD featuring the songs from the programme is now available.

===Video games===
Three educational video games, &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Activity Center&quot;, &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Reading World&quot; and &quot;Franklin Learns Math&quot; are published by Sanctuary Woods, Multimedia Corporation and released from PC in 1995 and 1996. In 2000, Nelvana and Knowledge Adventure, Inc. developed two PC games, &quot;Franklin the Turtle Goes to School&quot; and &quot;Franklin the Turtle&#x27;s Clubhouse&quot;. In 2004, Nelvana also developed an educational PC game called &quot;Franklin the Turtle After School&quot;. Between 2005 and 2006, The Game Factory released &quot;Franklin the Turtle&quot; and &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Great Adventures&quot; in 2005, and &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Birthday Surprise&quot; on April 18, 2006.

===CGI series===

On September 27, 2010, Nelvana announced that it had begun production on a new all-CGI &quot;Franklin&quot; series called &quot;Franklin and Friends&quot;. The series has been ordered for 52 episodes and the characters that return in the series are Bear, Fox, Rabbit, Beaver, Goose, Snail and, naturally, Franklin himself. Additionally, the series features a new regular character, Franklin&#x27;s paternal aunt named Aunt T., described as &quot;quirky.&quot; The series &quot;features special themes including fun mysteries, Woodland events and outdoor activities.&quot; This is a Canada-Singapore joint venture between Nelvana and Infinite Frameworks Pte. Ltd.

The series officially premiered on Treehouse TV on March 4, 2011. A US release date had been announced on the Nick Jr. Channel Franklin webpage for February 13, 2012. It also premiered in Singapore on Mediacorp on February 15, 2012.

<doc id="430324" wikidata="Q7248870" url="?curid=430324" title="Progressive shifting">
<text>Progressive shifting is a technique for changing gears commonly practiced by drivers of semi-trailer trucks. It is meant to reduce fuel consumption — something very important for drivers who travel several hundred miles each day.

Progressive shifting is accomplished by changing gears upward as early as possible when accelerating while staying within the flat torque range. Each shift will go a little higher into the RPM until the vehicle is in its top gear at cruising speed. After each shift is completed, the engine and transmission should be operating at or near the lowest rpm speeds recommended by the manufacturers of those parts.

The fastest acceleration is achieved when the truck is receiving as close as possible to maximum power throughout the entire time it is accelerating. E.g. in a truck with a Caterpillar C15 engine, it is achieved by going all the way up to 1950RPM, then shifting to a gear that will put the engine at 1500RPM.

In contrast, using progressive shifting, i.e. maintaining maximum torque, the overall acceleration is slower but there is increased fuel efficiency and lower wear of the engine due to lower RPM.

<doc id="430325" wikidata="Q1001232" url="?curid=430325" title="Waikouaiti">
<text>Waikouaiti is a small town in East Otago, New Zealand, within the city limits of Dunedin. The town is close to the coast and the mouth of the Waikouaiti River.

Today, Waikouaiti is a retail trade and servicing centre for the surrounding district, which has sheep farming as the principal primary activity. A major egg producer, Zeagold Foods, a branch of Mainland Poultry LTD has a 500,000-hen factory farming operation here and is in the process of expanding over the next year to meet demand for egg products. Hawksbury, 3 km southwest of Waikouaiti, has a cheese factory and shop, a swimming pool and housing developed from the old mental health institution, Cherry Farm. Karitane, 3 km to the southeast has a small fishing port.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of Europeans the area was occupied by Māori, who had a kāinga, or unfortified settlement, at modern Karitane and a pā, or fortified settlement, on the adjacent Huriawa Peninsula.

An 1826 sketch of the east Otago coast, shows the headlands and beaches of what are now Karitane and Waikouaiti.

Waikouaiti was the first European settlement in southern New Zealand to be mainly based on farming and one of the first enduring European settlements in Otago. From 1837 there had been a whaling station confusingly also called &quot;Waikouaiti&quot; nearby on the south side of the estuary at what is now called &quot;Karitane&quot;. Having already purchased large areas of land in the South Island (much of which was later declared to have been invalid) Johnny Jones sent settlers from Sydney, Australia in the &quot;Magnet&quot; to farm the district in 1840, eight years before the foundation of the Otago Association&#x27;s settlement. This was the first farm in the Otago region.
Jones himself did not move to Waikouaiti until 1843, after financial losses during an economic depression in Sydney. His original homestead and some of the associated buildings of his colonial manor farm, known as Matanaka Farm, which still stand on Cornish Head, date from this time. The farm buildings, though not the homestead, are owned by Heritage New Zealand and are open to the public. They are the oldest surviving farm buildings in New Zealand.

Jones moved to Dunedin in 1854 but was influential in the development of Waikouaiti for many years after. The wooden shingle roofed St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church in Waikouaiti proper opened in 1858, was funded by Jones. It was designed by Benjamin Mountfort of Christchurch who also designed the Provincial Council Building there. In 1861 Dr. William Chapman, at Jones request, became the first GP for the district.

The Presbyterians built a wooden church in 1863. It was moved to Kildare Street in 1876 and still remains. It became the Sunday School when a brick church was built in 1914, designed by J.Louis Salmond but this building closed in 2008 and was demolished in 2009.

===2021 lead poisoning scare===

In early February 2021, high levels of lead (40 times the acceptable level of 0.01 mg/L) were detected in Waikouaiti and nearby Karitane&#x27;s drinking water supply. The high levels of lead were first detected on 18 December 2020 but the alert was emailed to a Dunedin City Council staff member who was on holiday. In response, Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield offered free blood tests to Karitane and Waikouaiti residents. The Dunedin City Council also dispatched water tanks and staff to assist and reassure local residents. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described the lead levels in the two towns as &quot;unacceptable.&quot; On 9 February, the City Council distributed free fruits and vegetables to residents of Waikouaiti, Karitane, and Hawksbury due to concerns about eating crops irrigated with the contaminated water.

Following lead scare, the Dunedin City Council announced on 11 February that it would drain a raw water reservoir and replace five kilometres of old pipes in order to reassure residents of Waikouaiti, Karitane and Hawksbury. By 10 March, the Southern District Health Board confirmed that 1,512 people had been tested, with blood test results indicating that nobody had a blood lead level requiring hospitalisation and that long term exposure to lead from the water supply was limited. In July 2021 the City Council removed its recommendation to not drink from the areas water supply.
