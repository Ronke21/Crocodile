<text>Laburnum, sometimes called golden chain or golden rain, is a genus of two species of small trees in the subfamily Faboideae of the pea family Fabaceae. The species are &quot;Laburnum anagyroides&quot;—common laburnum and &quot;Laburnum alpinum&quot;—alpine laburnum. They are native to the mountains of southern Europe from France to the Balkans.

Some botanists include a third species, &quot;Laburnum caramanicum&quot;, but this native of southeast Europe and Anatolia is usually treated in a distinct genus &quot;Podocytisus&quot;, more closely allied to the &quot;Genisteae&quot; (brooms).

==Description==
The &quot;Laburnum&quot; trees are deciduous. The leaves are trifoliate, somewhat like a clover; the leaflets are typically long in &quot;L. anagyroides&quot; and long in &quot;L. alpinum&quot;.

They have yellow pea-flowers in pendulous leafless racemes long in spring, which makes them very popular garden trees. In &quot;L. anagyroides&quot;, the racemes are long, with densely packed flowers; in &quot;L. alpinum&quot; the racemes are long, but with the flowers sparsely along the raceme. The fruit develops as a pod and is extremely poisonous.

The yellow flowers are responsible for the old poetic name &#x27;golden chain tree&#x27; (also written as golden chaintree or goldenchain tree).

All parts of the plant are poisonous, although mortality is very rare. Symptoms of laburnum poisoning may include intense sleepiness, vomiting, convulsive movements, coma, slight frothing at the mouth and unequally dilated pupils. In some cases, diarrhea is very severe, and at times the convulsions are markedly tetanic. The main toxin in the plant is cytisine, a nicotinic receptor agonist.

It is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the Palearctic moth, the buff-tip.

==Uses==

===Woodworking===
&quot;Laburnum&quot; has historically been used for cabinetmaking and inlay, as well as for musical instruments. In addition to such wind instruments as recorders and flutes, it was a popular wood for Great Highland Bagpipes before taste turned to imported dense tropical hardwoods such as &quot;Brya ebenus&quot; (cocus wood), ebony, and &quot;Dalbergia melanoxylon&quot; (African monkeywood). The heart-wood of a laburnum may be used as a substitute for ebony or rosewood. It is very hard and a dark chocolate brown, with a butter-yellow sapwood. 

===Cultivation===
&quot;Laburnum&quot; species and hybrids are cultivated as ornamental trees for gardens and parks. They are also trained as espaliers on pergolas, for ceilings of pendant flowers in season. In its natural form, &quot;Laburnum&quot; is a shrubby, multi-branched tree, but it is often pruned to maintain a single trunk which displays the smooth green bark.

Gardeners are advised to remove the spent seedpods after flowering because they sap the strength of the tree and are the most poisonous part. Generally &quot;Laburnum&quot; does not perform well in hot climates, and has a reduced life-span if grown in climates with warm winters. Afternoon shade and the occasional deep watering are advisable in areas with hot, dry summers. They do best in climates with moderate winter and summer temperatures, ideally Oceanic climates like those of the Pacific Northwest and Northern Europe. &quot;Laburnum&quot; trees are ubiquitous in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, where they are commonly planted as lawn specimens or in shrub borders.

Most garden specimens are of the hybrid between the two species, &quot;Laburnum&quot; ×&quot;watereri&quot; &#x27;Vossii&#x27; (Voss&#x27;s laburnum), which combines the longer racemes of &quot;L. alpinum&quot; with the denser flowers of &quot;L. anagyroides&quot;; it also has the benefit of low seed production. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<text>An entity to be named the European Political Community (EPC) was proposed in 1952 as a combination of the existing European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the proposed European Defence Community (EDC). A draft EPC treaty, as drawn up by the ECSC assembly (now the European Parliament), would have seen a directly elected assembly (&quot;the Peoples’ Chamber&quot;), a senate appointed by national parliaments and a supranational executive accountable to the parliament.

The European Political Community project failed in 1954 when it became clear that the European Defence Community would not be ratified by the French national assembly, which feared that the project entailed an unacceptable loss of national sovereignty. As a result, the European Political Community idea had to be abandoned.

Following the collapse of the EPC, European leaders met in the Messina Conference in 1955 and established the Spaak Committee which would pave the way for the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC).

<text>Giorgio Giulio Clovio or Juraj Julije Klović (1498 – 5 January 1578) was a Croatian-Italian illuminator, miniaturist, and painter born in the Kingdom of Croatia, who was mostly active in Renaissance Italy. He is considered the greatest illuminator of the Italian High Renaissance, and arguably the last very notable artist in the long tradition of the illuminated manuscript, before some modern revivals.

==Biography==
Giulio Clovio was born in Grižane, a village in Kingdom of Croatia (today&#x27;s Croatia).
He came from a Croatian family, and he is known as &quot;Clovio Croata.&quot;

It is not known where he had his early training, but he may have studied art with monks at Rijeka of Novi Bazar when he was young.
He moved to Italy at age 18 and entered the household of Cardinal Marino Grimani where he was trained as a painter. Between 1516 and ca 1523 Clovio may have lived with Marino in the residence of the latter&#x27;s uncle Cardinal Domenico Grimani in Rome. Clovio studied under Giulio Romano during this early period.

He also studied under Girolamo dai Libri.

While a protégé of Cardinal Domenico Grimani, Clovio engraved medals and seals for him, as well as the Grimani Commentary Ms., an important early illuminated book (now Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum, London).

By 1524 Clovio was at Buda, at the Hungarian court of King Louis II, for whom he painted the &quot;Judgment of Paris&quot; and &quot;Lucretia&quot;. After Louis&#x27; death in the Battle of Mohács, Clovio travelled to Rome where he continued his career.

After 1527 he visited several monasteries of the Canons Regular of St. Augustine. In 1534 Clovio returned to the household of Cardinal Marino Grimani. A year later Clovio may have followed Marino when the latter was appointed as a papal legate to Perugia, where Clovio is thought to have worked on illustrations for the Soane Manuscript written by Marino Grimani around that time. Clovio likely returned to Rome by the end of 1538 when he is known to have met with the writer Francisco de Hollanda.

Clovio later became a member of the household of Alessandro Farnese with whom he would be associated until his death. It was during his time with Farnese that Clovio created one of his masterpieces, the Farnese Hours. Other well-known works from this period include the illustrations for the Towneley Lectionary.

From 1551 to 1553 Clovio is known to have worked in Florence. During this time he painted a miniature of Eleanor of Toledo (England, Welbeck Abbey, Private Collection).

==Contact with other artists==
Clovio was a friend of the much younger El Greco, the celebrated Greek artist from Crete Heraklion, who later worked in Spain, during El Greco&#x27;s early years in Rome. Greco painted two portraits of Clovio; one shows the four painters whom he considered his masters; in this, Clovio is side by side with Michelangelo, Titian, and Raphael. Clovio was also known as &quot;Michelangelo of the miniature&quot;. Books with his miniatures became famous primarily due to his skilled illustrations. He was persuasive in transferring the style of Italian high Renaissance painting into the miniature format.

Pieter Bruegel the Elder was a personal friend of Giulio Clovio, and stayed with Clovio in Rome during his Italian trip of 1553. Breugel executed a small medallion depicting ships in a storm on a Clovio miniature of the Last Judgment (New York Public Library), but the six Bruegels mentioned in Clovio&#x27;s will have all disappeared.

==Major works==
===&quot;Soane Manuscript&quot;===
Clovio illuminated the Commentary of Marino Grimani on St Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Romans. This work is now in the Sir John Soane Museum in London. The commentary consists of 130 vellums. Two large miniatures are included, as well as richly decorated borders. The miniatures depict the conversion of St Paul.

===&quot;Farnese Hours&quot;===
His most famous work is the &quot;Farnese Hours,&quot; completed in 1546 for Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, which was nine years in the making (now Morgan Library, New York). He is pointing to this work in the El Greco portrait (above). This contains twenty-eight miniatures, mostly of Old and New Testament scenes, but with a famous double-page picture representing the Corpus Christi procession in Rome. It has splendid silver-gilt covers, although they are not by Benvenuto Cellini, as Vasari claimed.

===&quot;Towneley Lectionary&quot;===
The &quot;Towneley Lectionary&quot; is now in the New York Public Library and probably belonged to Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. Used during services, the book contained six majestic, full-page miniatures opposite miniature depictions of the Evangelists. The illustrations introduced the relevant readings from the Scripture. They include the Nativity, the Resurrection and the Last Judgment.

===&quot;Colonna Missal&quot;===

This work is now in the John Rylands Library in Manchester. The Colonna Missal was made for Cardinal Pompeo Colonna. There had been some debate about the identity of the artist. Some had attributed the missal to Raphael (about 1517). It has also been suggested that the work may belong to Vinzenzio Raimondi. It is now generally attributed to Clovio.
===Other===
The British Library has his twelve full-page miniatures of the victories of the Emperor Charles V, and the Stuart de Rothesay Book of Hours, which was originally commissioned by Cardinal Marino Grimani and includes 4 miniatures by Giulio Clovio.

The Vatican library has a manuscript life of Federigo III di Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, superbly illustrated by Clovio. Other illustrations by him are kept in libraries in Vienna, New York City, Munich, and Paris, and in many private collections. A large exhibition of his works was held in 2012 in &quot;Klovićevi Dvori&quot; (&quot;Palace of Klović&quot;), the art gallery dedicated to him in Zagreb.

According to a description written for publication by Antonfrancesco Cirni, he also designed many of the costumes for the famously elaborate wedding festivities of Ortensia Borromeo in March 1565, which were held in the Vatican and included a tournament in the Belvedere courtyard. Such duties were often expected of a Renaissance court painter. The costumes are carefully recorded in a series of anonymous etchings, some probably based on Clovio&#x27;s design drawings.

==Death and burial==
Giulio Clovio died in Rome on 5 January 1578. His tomb is in the Basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli, the church containing Michelangelo&#x27;s celebrated &quot;Moses&quot;.

==500th anniversary==
Croatia celebrated the 1998 500th anniversary of his birth. The Croatian National Bank issued a special 200 kuna silver coin in commemoration. A monument to Clovio was also raised in Drivenik. The Croatian government recently made news by purchasing Clovio&#x27;s &quot;The Last Judgement&quot;, a painting Clovio gave as a gift to Pope Clement VII. Bernardin Modrić released his film &quot;The Gospel According to Klović&quot; in 2006. The Vatican celebrated this anniversary with postal stamps.

==Legacy==
Today, Giulio Clovio is celebrated in Italy and Croatia. He was born in the Kingdom of Croatia and stated his Croatian identity. But, for most of his life he worked in Italy, and is therefore often referred to as an Italian painter.

<text>Shingles, also known as herpes zoster or zona, is a viral disease characterized by a painful skin rash with blisters in a localized area. Typically the rash occurs in a single, wide mark either on the left or right side of the body or face. Two to four days before the rash occurs there may be tingling or local pain in the area. Other common symptoms are fever, headache, and tiredness. The rash usually heals within two to four weeks, but some people develop ongoing nerve pain which can last for months or years, a condition called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). In those with poor immune function the rash may occur widely. If the rash involves the eye, vision loss may occur.

Shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV) that also causes chickenpox. In the case of chickenpox, also called varicella, the initial infection with the virus typically occurs during childhood or adolescence. Once the chickenpox has resolved, the virus can remain dormant (inactive) in human nerve cells (dorsal root ganglia or cranial nerves) for years or decades, after which it may reactivate and travel along nerve bodies to nerve endings in the skin, producing blisters. During an outbreak of shingles, exposure to the varicella virus found in shingles blisters can cause chickenpox in someone who has not yet had chickenpox, although that person will not suffer from shingles, at least on the first infection. How the virus remains dormant in nerve cells or subsequently re-activates is not well understood.

The disease has been recognized since ancient times. Risk factors for reactivation of the dormant virus include old age, poor immune function, and having contracted chickenpox before 18 months of age. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms presented. &quot;Varicella zoster virus&quot; is not the same as &quot;herpes simplex virus&quot;, although they both belong to the alpha subfamily of herpesviruses.

Shingles vaccines reduce the risk of shingles by 50 to 90%, depending on the vaccine used. Vaccination also decreases rates of postherpetic neuralgia, and, if shingles occurs, its severity. If shingles develops, antiviral medications such as aciclovir can reduce the severity and duration of disease if started within 72 hours of the appearance of the rash. Evidence does not show a significant effect of antivirals or steroids on rates of postherpetic neuralgia. Paracetamol, NSAIDs, or opioids may be used to help with acute pain.

It is estimated that about a third of people develop shingles at some point in their lives. While shingles is more common among older people, children may also get the disease. According to the US National Institutes of Health, the number of new cases per year ranges from 1.2 to 3.4 per 1,000 person-years among healthy individuals to 3.9 to 11.8 per 1,000 person-years among those older than 65 years of age. About half of those living to age 85 will have at least one attack, and fewer than 5% will have more than one attack. Although symptoms can be severe, risk of death is very low: 0.28 to 0.69 deaths per million.

==Signs and symptoms==
The earliest symptoms of shingles, which include headache, fever, and malaise, are nonspecific, and may result in an incorrect diagnosis. These symptoms are commonly followed by sensations of burning pain, itching, hyperesthesia (oversensitivity), or paresthesia (&quot;pins and needles&quot;: tingling, pricking, or numbness). Pain can be mild to severe in the affected dermatome, with sensations that are often described as stinging, tingling, aching, numbing or throbbing, and can be interspersed with quick stabs of agonizing pain.

Shingles in children is often painless, but people are more likely to get shingles as they age, and the disease tends to be more severe.

In most cases, after one to two days—but sometimes as long as three weeks—the initial phase is followed by the appearance of the characteristic skin rash. The pain and rash most commonly occur on the torso but can appear on the face, eyes, or other parts of the body. At first, the rash appears similar to the first appearance of hives; however, unlike hives, shingles causes skin changes limited to a dermatome, normally resulting in a stripe or belt-like pattern that is limited to one side of the body and does not cross the midline. &quot;Zoster sine herpete&quot; (&quot;zoster without herpes&quot;) describes a person who has all of the symptoms of shingles except this characteristic rash.

Later the rash becomes vesicular, forming small blisters filled with a serous exudate, as the fever and general malaise continue. The painful vesicles eventually become cloudy or darkened as they fill with blood, and crust over within seven to ten days; usually the crusts fall off and the skin heals, but sometimes, after severe blistering, scarring and discolored skin remain. The blister fluid contains varicella zoster virus, which can be transmitted through contact or inhalation of fluid droplets until the lesions crust over, which may take up to four weeks.

===Face===
Shingles may have additional symptoms, depending on the dermatome involved. The trigeminal nerve is the most commonly involved nerve, of which the ophthalmic division is the most commonly involved branch. When the virus is reactivated in this nerve branch it is termed &quot;zoster ophthalmicus&quot;. The skin of the forehead, upper eyelid and orbit of the eye may be involved. Zoster ophthalmicus occurs in approximately 10% to 25% of cases. In some people, symptoms may include conjunctivitis, keratitis, uveitis, and optic nerve palsies that can sometimes cause chronic ocular inflammation, loss of vision, and debilitating pain.

&quot;Shingles oticus&quot;, also known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II, involves the ear. It is thought to result from the virus spreading from the facial nerve to the vestibulocochlear nerve. Symptoms include hearing loss and vertigo (rotational dizziness).

Shingles may occur in the mouth if the maxillary or mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve is affected, in which the rash may appear on the mucous membrane of the upper jaw (usually the palate, sometimes the gums of the upper teeth) or the lower jaw (tongue or gums of the lower teeth) respectively. Oral involvement may occur alone or in combination with a rash on the skin over the cutaneous distribution of the same trigeminal branch. As with shingles of the skin, the lesions tend to only involve one side, distinguishing it from other oral blistering conditions. In the mouth, shingles appears initially as 1–4 mm opaque blisters (vesicles), which break down quickly to leave ulcers that heal within 10–14 days. The prodromal pain (before the rash) may be confused with toothache. Sometimes this leads to unnecessary dental treatment. Post-herpetic neuralgia uncommonly is associated with shingles in the mouth. Unusual complications may occur with intra-oral shingles that are not seen elsewhere. Due to the close relationship of blood vessels to nerves, the virus can spread to involve the blood vessels and compromise the blood supply, sometimes causing ischemic necrosis. In rare cases, oral involvement causes complications such as osteonecrosis, tooth loss, periodontitis (gum disease), pulp calcification, pulp necrosis, periapical lesions and tooth developmental anomalies.

===Disseminated shingles===
In those with deficits in immune function, &quot;disseminated shingles&quot; may occur (wide rash). 
It is defined as more than 20 skin lesions appearing outside either the primarily affected dermatome or dermatomes directly adjacent to it. Besides the skin, other organs, such as the liver or brain, may also be affected (causing hepatitis or encephalitis, respectively), making the condition potentially lethal.

==Pathophysiology==

The causative agent for shingles is the varicella zoster virus (VZV)—a double-stranded DNA virus related to the herpes simplex virus. Most individuals are infected with this virus as children which causes an episode of chickenpox. The immune system eventually eliminates the virus from most locations, but it remains dormant (or latent) in the ganglia adjacent to the spinal cord (called the dorsal root ganglion) or the trigeminal ganglion in the base of the skull.

Shingles occurs only in people who have been previously infected with VZV; although it can occur at any age, approximately half of the cases in the United States occur in those aged 50 years or older. Shingles can recur. In contrast to the frequent recurrence of herpes simplex symptoms, repeated attacks of shingles are unusual. It is extremely rare for a person to have more than three recurrences.

The disease results from virus particles in a single sensory ganglion switching from their latent phase to their active phase. Due to difficulties in studying VZV reactivation directly in humans (leading to reliance on small-animal models), its latency is less well understood than that of the herpes simplex virus. Virus-specific proteins continue to be made by the infected cells during the latent period, so true latency, as opposed to chronic, low-level, active infection, has not been proven to occur in VZV infections. Although VZV has been detected in autopsies of nervous tissue, there are no methods to find dormant virus in the ganglia of living people.

Unless the immune system is compromised, it suppresses reactivation of the virus and prevents shingles outbreaks. Why this suppression sometimes fails is poorly understood, but shingles is more likely to occur in people whose immune systems are impaired due to aging, immunosuppressive therapy, psychological stress, or other factors. Upon reactivation, the virus replicates in neuronal cell bodies, and virions are shed from the cells and carried down the axons to the area of skin innervated by that ganglion. In the skin, the virus causes local inflammation and blistering. The short- and long-term pain caused by shingles outbreaks originates from inflammation of affected nerves due to the widespread growth of the virus in those areas.

As with chickenpox and other forms of alpha-herpesvirus infection, direct contact with an active rash can spread the virus to a person who lacks immunity to it. This newly infected individual may then develop chickenpox, but will not immediately develop shingles.

The complete sequence of the viral genome was published in 1986.

==Diagnosis==

If the rash has appeared, identifying this disease (making a differential diagnosis) requires only a visual examination, since very few diseases produce a rash in a dermatomal pattern (sometimes called by doctors on TV &quot;a dermatonal map&quot;). However, herpes simplex virus (HSV) can occasionally produce a rash in such a pattern (zosteriform herpes simplex).

When the rash is absent (early or late in the disease, or in the case of ), shingles can be difficult to diagnose. Apart from the rash, most symptoms can occur also in other conditions.

Laboratory tests are available to diagnose shingles. The most popular test detects VZV-specific IgM antibody in blood; this appears only during chickenpox or shingles and not while the virus is dormant. In larger laboratories, lymph collected from a blister is tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for VZV DNA, or examined with an electron microscope for virus particles. Molecular biology tests based on &quot;in vitro&quot; nucleic acid amplification (PCR tests) are currently considered the most reliable. Nested PCR test has high sensitivity, but is susceptible to contamination leading to false positive results. The latest real-time PCR tests are rapid, easy to perform, and as sensitive as nested PCR, and have a lower risk of contamination. They also have more sensitivity than viral cultures.

=== Differential diagnosis ===
Shingles can be confused with herpes simplex, dermatitis herpetiformis and impetigo, and skin reactions caused by contact dermatitis, candidiasis, certain drugs and insect bites.

== Prevention ==
Shingles risk can be reduced in children by the chickenpox vaccine if the vaccine is administered before the individual gets chickenpox. If primary infection has already occurred, there are shingles vaccines that reduce the risk of developing shingles or developing severe shingles if the disease occurs. They include a live attenuated virus vaccine, Zostavax, and an adjuvanted subunit vaccine, Shingrix.

A review by Cochrane concluded that Zostavax was useful for preventing shingles for at least three years. This equates to about 50% relative risk reduction. The vaccine reduced rates of persistent, severe pain after shingles by 66% in people who contracted shingles despite vaccination. Vaccine efficacy was maintained through four years of follow-up. It has been recommended that people with primary or acquired immunodeficiency should not receive the live vaccine.

Two doses of Shingrix are recommended, which provide about 90% protection at 3.5 years. As of 2016, it had been studied only in people with an intact immune system. It appears to also be effective in the very old.

In the UK, shingles vaccination is offered by the National Health Service (NHS) to all people in their 70s. Zostavax is the usual vaccine, but Shingrix vaccine is recommended if Zostavax is unsuitable, for example for those with immune system issues. Vaccination is not available to people over 80 as &quot;it seems to be less effective in this age group&quot;. By August 2017, just under half of eligible 70–78 year olds had been vaccinated. About 3% of those eligible by age have conditions that suppress their immune system, and should not receive Zostavax. There had been 1,104 adverse reaction reports by April 2018. In the US, it is recommended that healthy adults 50 years and older receive two doses of Shingrix, two to six months apart.

==Treatment==
The aims of treatment are to limit the severity and duration of pain, shorten the duration of a shingles episode, and reduce complications. Symptomatic treatment is often needed for the complication of postherpetic neuralgia.
However, a study on untreated shingles shows that, once the rash has cleared, postherpetic neuralgia is very rare in people under 50 and wears off in time; in older people, the pain wore off more slowly, but even in people over 70, 85% were free from pain a year after their shingles outbreak.

===Analgesics===
People with mild to moderate pain can be treated with over-the-counter pain medications. Topical lotions containing calamine can be used on the rash or blisters and may be soothing. Occasionally, severe pain may require an opioid medication, such as morphine. Once the lesions have crusted over, capsaicin cream (Zostrix) can be used. Topical lidocaine and nerve blocks may also reduce pain. Administering gabapentin along with antivirals may offer relief of postherpetic neuralgia.

===Antivirals===
Antiviral drugs may reduce the severity and duration of shingles; however, they do not prevent postherpetic neuralgia. Of these drugs, aciclovir has been the standard treatment, but the newer drugs valaciclovir and famciclovir demonstrate similar or superior efficacy and good safety and tolerability. The drugs are used both for prevention (for example in people with HIV/AIDS) and as therapy during the acute phase. Complications in immunocompromised individuals with shingles may be reduced with intravenous aciclovir. In people who are at a high risk for repeated attacks of shingles, five daily oral doses of aciclovir are usually effective.

===Steroids===
Corticosteroids do not appear to decrease the risk of long-term pain. Side effects however appear to be minimal. Their use in Ramsay Hunt syndrome had not been properly studied as of 2008.

===Zoster ophthalmicus===
Treatment for zoster ophthalmicus is similar to standard treatment for shingles at other sites. A trial comparing aciclovir with its prodrug, valaciclovir, demonstrated similar efficacies in treating this form of the disease.

==Prognosis ==
The rash and pain usually subside within three to five weeks, but about one in five people develop a painful condition called postherpetic neuralgia, which is often difficult to manage. In some people, shingles can reactivate presenting as &quot;zoster sine herpete&quot;: pain radiating along the path of a single spinal nerve (a &quot;dermatomal distribution&quot;), but without an accompanying rash. This condition may involve complications that affect several levels of the nervous system and cause many cranial neuropathies, polyneuritis, myelitis, or aseptic meningitis. Other serious effects that may occur in some cases include partial facial paralysis (usually temporary), ear damage, or encephalitis. Although initial infections with VZV during pregnancy, causing chickenpox, may lead to infection of the fetus and complications in the newborn, chronic infection or reactivation in shingles are not associated with fetal infection.

There is a slightly increased risk of developing cancer after a shingles episode. However, the mechanism is unclear and mortality from cancer did not appear to increase as a direct result of the presence of the virus. Instead, the increased risk may result from the immune suppression that allows the reactivation of the virus.

Although shingles typically resolves within 3–5 weeks, certain complications may arise:
* Secondary bacterial infection.
* Motor involvement, including weakness especially in &quot;motor herpes zoster&quot;.
* Eye involvement: trigeminal nerve involvement (as seen in herpes ophthalmicus) should be treated early and aggressively as it may lead to blindness. Involvement of the tip of the nose in the zoster rash is a strong predictor of herpes ophthalmicus.
* Postherpetic neuralgia, a condition of chronic pain following shingles.

==Epidemiology==

Varicella zoster virus (VZV) has a high level of infectivity and has a worldwide prevalence. Shingles is a re-activation of latent VZV infection: zoster can only occur in someone who has previously had chickenpox (varicella).

Shingles has no relationship to season and does not occur in epidemics. There is, however, a strong relationship with increasing age. The incidence rate of shingles ranges from 1.2 to 3.4 per 1,000 person‐years among younger healthy individuals, increasing to 3.9–11.8 per 1,000 person‐years among those older than 65 years, and incidence rates worldwide are similar.
This relationship with age has been demonstrated in many countries, and is attributed to the fact that cellular immunity declines as people grow older.

Another important risk factor is immunosuppression. Other risk factors include psychological stress. According to a study in North Carolina, &quot;black subjects were significantly less likely to develop zoster than were white subjects.&quot; It is unclear whether the risk is different by sex. Other potential risk factors include mechanical trauma and exposure to immunotoxins.

There is no strong evidence for a genetic link or a link to family history. A 2008 study showed that people with close relatives who had shingles were twice as likely to develop it themselves, but a 2010 study found no such link.

Adults with latent VZV infection who are exposed intermittently to children with chickenpox receive an immune boost. This periodic boost to the immune system helps to prevent shingles in older adults. When routine chickenpox vaccination was introduced in the United States, there was concern that, because older adults would no longer receive this natural periodic boost, there would be an increase in the incidence of shingles.

Multiple studies and surveillance data, at least when viewed superficially, demonstrate no consistent trends in incidence in the U.S. since the chickenpox vaccination program began in 1995. However, upon closer inspection, the two studies that showed no increase in shingles incidence were conducted among populations where varicella vaccination was not as yet widespread in the community. A later study by Patel &quot;et al.&quot; concluded that since the introduction of the chickenpox vaccine, hospitalization costs for complications of shingles increased by more than $700 million annually for those over age 60. Another study by Yih &quot;et al.&quot; reported that as varicella vaccine coverage in children increased, the incidence of varicella decreased, and the occurrence of shingles among adults increased by 90%. The results of a further study by Yawn &quot;et al.&quot; showed a 28% increase in shingles incidence from 1996 to 2001. It is likely that incidence rate will change in the future, due to the aging of the population, changes in therapy for malignant and autoimmune diseases, and changes in chickenpox vaccination rates; a wide adoption of zoster vaccination could dramatically reduce the incidence rate.

In one study, it was estimated that 26% of those who contract shingles eventually present complications. Postherpetic neuralgia arises in approximately 20% of people with shingles. A study of 1994 California data found hospitalization rates of 2.1 per 100,000 person-years, rising to 9.3 per 100,000 person-years for ages 60 and up. An earlier Connecticut study found a higher hospitalization rate; the difference may be due to the prevalence of HIV in the earlier study, or to the introduction of antivirals in California before 1994.

==History==
Shingles has a long recorded history, although historical accounts fail to distinguish the blistering caused by VZV and those caused by smallpox, ergotism, and erysipelas. Aulus Cornelius Celsus, around 25 BC to 50 AD, first used the term herpes zoster. In the late 18th century William Heberden established a way to differentiate shingles and smallpox, and in the late 19th century, shingles was differentiated from erysipelas. In 1831 Richard Bright hypothesized that the disease arose from the dorsal root ganglion, and an 1861 paper by Felix von Bärensprung confirmed this.

Recognition that chickenpox and shingles were caused by the same virus came at the beginning of the 20th century. Physicians began to report that cases of shingles were often followed by chickenpox in younger people who lived with the person with shingles. The idea of an association between the two diseases gained strength when it was shown that lymph from a person with shingles could induce chickenpox in young volunteers. This was finally proved by the first isolation of the virus in cell cultures, by the Nobel laureate Thomas Huckle Weller, in 1953. Some sources also attribute the first isolation of the herpes zoster virus to Evelyn Nicol.

Until the 1940s the disease was considered benign, and serious complications were thought to be very rare. However, by 1942, it was recognized that shingles was a more serious disease in adults than in children and that it increased in frequency with advancing age. Further studies during the 1950s on immunosuppressed individuals showed that the disease was not as benign as once thought, and the search for various therapeutic and preventive measures began. By the mid-1960s, several studies identified the gradual reduction in cellular immunity in old age, observing that in a cohort of 1,000 people who lived to the age of 85, approximately 500 (i.e., 50%) would have at least one attack of shingles, and 10 (i.e., 1%) would have at least two attacks.

In historical shingles studies, shingles incidence generally increased with age. However, in his 1965 paper, Hope-Simpson suggested that the &quot;peculiar age distribution of zoster may in part reflect the frequency with which the different age groups encounter cases of varicella and because of the ensuing boost to their antibody protection have their attacks of zoster postponed&quot;.
Lending support to this hypothesis that contact with children with chickenpox boosts adult cell-mediated immunity to help postpone or suppress shingles, a study by Thomas &quot;et al.&quot; reported that adults in households with children had lower rates of shingles than households without children. Also, the study by Terada &quot;et al.&quot; indicated that pediatricians reflected incidence rates from 1/2 to 1/8 that of the general population their age.

==Etymology==
The family name of all the herpesviruses derives from the Greek word , from (&quot;to creep&quot;), referring to the latent, recurring infections typical of this group of viruses. &quot;Zoster&quot; comes from Greek , meaning &quot;belt&quot; or &quot;girdle&quot;, after the characteristic belt-like dermatomal rash. The common name for the disease, &quot;shingles&quot;, derives from the Latin , a variant of Latin , meaning &quot;girdle&quot;.

==Research==
Until the mid-1990s, infectious complications of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by VZV reactivation were regarded as rare. The presence of rash, as well as specific neurological symptoms, were required to diagnose a CNS infection caused by VZV. Since 2000, PCR testing has become more widely used, and the number of diagnosed cases of CNS infection has increased.

Classic textbook descriptions state that VZV reactivation in the CNS is restricted to immunocompromised individuals and the elderly; however, studies have found that most participants are immunocompetent, and younger than 60 years old. Historically, vesicular rash was considered a characteristic finding, but studies have found that rash is only present in 45% of cases.
In addition, systemic inflammation is not as reliable an indicator as previously thought: the mean level of C-reactive protein and mean white blood cell count are within the normal range in participants with VZV meningitis.
MRI and CT scans are usually normal in cases of VZV reactivation in the CNS. CSF pleocytosis, previously thought to be a strong indicator of VZV encephalitis, was absent in half of a group of people diagnosed with VZV encephalitis by PCR.

The frequency of CNS infections presented at the emergency room of a community hospital is not negligible, so a means of diagnosing cases is needed. PCR is not a foolproof method of diagnosis, but because so many other indicators have turned out not to be reliable in diagnosing VZV infections in the CNS, PCR is the recommended method of testing for VZV. Negative PCR does not rule out VZV involvement, but a positive PCR can be used for diagnosis, and appropriate treatment started (for example, antivirals can be prescribed rather than antibiotics).

The introduction of DNA analysis techniques has shown some complications of varicella-zoster to be more common than previously thought. For example, sporadic meningoencephalitis (ME) caused by varicella-zoster was regarded as rare disease, mostly related to childhood chickenpox. However, meningoencephalitis caused by varicella-zoster is increasingly recognized as a predominant cause of ME among immunocompetent adults in non-epidemic circumstances.

Diagnosis of complications of varicella-zoster, particularly in cases where the disease reactivates after years or decades of latency, is difficult. A rash (shingles) can be present or absent. Symptoms vary, and there is a significant overlap in symptoms with herpes-simplex symptoms.

Although DNA analysis techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to look for DNA of herpesviruses in spinal fluid or blood, the results may be negative, even in cases where other definitive symptoms exist. Notwithstanding these limitations, the use of PCR has resulted in an advance in the state of the art in our understanding of herpesviruses, including VZV, during the 1990s and 2000s. For example, in the past, clinicians believed that encephalitis was caused by herpes simplex and that people always died or developed serious long-term function problems. People were diagnosed at autopsy or by brain biopsy. Brain biopsy is not undertaken lightly: it is reserved only for serious cases that cannot be diagnosed by less invasive methods. For this reason, knowledge of these herpes virus conditions was limited to severe cases. DNA techniques have made it possible to diagnose &quot;mild&quot; cases, caused by VZV or HSV, in which the symptoms include fever, headache, and altered mental status. Mortality rates in treated people are decreasing.

<text>Appius Claudius Caudex ( 264 BC) was a Roman politician. He was the younger brother of Appius Claudius Caecus, and served as consul in 264 BC.

In that year, he drew Rome into conflict with Carthage over possession of Sicily. In 265 BC, Hiero II of Syracuse had attacked Messana (modern Messina) in an attempt to capture it from the Mamertines, mercenaries from Campania who had taken it some years before. The Mamertines allied with a nearby Carthaginian fleet and held off the Syracusans, but when the Carthaginians did not leave, the Mamertines appealed to Rome in 264 BC.

Some senators were opposed to helping them, but Appius Claudius persuaded the citizens to support them. He led a force to Messina and, as the Mamertines had convinced the Carthaginians to withdraw, he met with only a symbolic resistance. The Mamertines handed the city over to Appius Claudius, but the Carthaginians returned and laid siege to Messana. The Syracusans, meanwhile, were also stationed outside the city. Claudius tried to send ambassadors to both the Carthaginians and the Syracusans, but he was ignored. He then led his troops outside the city, defeated the Syracusans in battle, and Hiero retreated back to Syracuse. The next day Claudius also defeated the Carthaginians. Following these victories Appius laid siege to Echetla but after the loss of many troops returned to Messana.

This dispute was one of the immediate causes of the First Punic War.

According to the Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger he was surnamed &quot;Caudex&quot; because of his boats: &quot;among the ancients a structure formed by joining together several boards was called a &quot;.

<text>Earl of Elgin ( ) is a title in the Peerage of Scotland, created in 1633 for Thomas Bruce, 3rd Lord Kinloss. He was later created Baron Bruce, of Whorlton in the County of York, in the Peerage of England on 30 July 1641. The Earl of Elgin is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Bruce.

==History==

The family descended from the Bruces of Clackmannan, whose ancestor was Thomas de Bruys. According to Sir James Balfour Paul, there is no evidence that this branch of the family was descended from Robert the Bruce (King Robert I), despite claims that Thomas was an illegitimate son of the king. However, King Robert&#x27;s son David II made a grant of land in 1359 to Robert Bruce referring to him as &quot; dilecto consanguineo suo&quot; (our beloved cousin). It was generally accepted that Clackmannan branch descended from John de Brus who was a younger son of Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale.

The first earl was succeeded by his son, Robert, who also was created Earl of Ailesbury in the Peerage of England. The two Earldoms continued united until the death of the fourth Earl of Elgin, when the Ailesbury and Baron Bruce (of Whorlton) titles became extinct, and the Elgin title passed to the Earl of Kincardine; the Lordship of Kinloss became dormant. Thereafter, the Earldoms of Elgin and Kincardine have remained united.

In Dublin there are roads that come from the Earl&#x27;s titles. These are Elgin Road and Ailesbury Road.

The most famous Earl was the 7th Earl, who removed and transported to Britain the so-called Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon.

As well as the titles Earl of Elgin and Earl of Kincardine, Lord Elgin also holds the titles Lord Bruce of Kinloss (created 1604), Lord Bruce of Torry (1647) and Baron Elgin, of Elgin in Scotland (1849). The first two are in the Peerage of Scotland; the third is in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The Lordship of Kinloss held by the first four Earls was inherited on the death of the 4th Earl by the 3rd Duke of Chandos. Through his daughter it passed to the Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos, and is now held by these Dukes&#x27; heir of line.

The family seat is Broomhall House, three miles south-west of Dunfermline, Scotland.

<text>Kings of Convenience is an indie folk duo from Bergen, Norway, consisting of Erlend Øye and Eirik Glambek Bøe.

==History==
Øye and Bøe were both born in 1975 (Øye on 21 November and Bøe on 25 October) and have known each other since they met in the same class at school. Their first musical collaboration was a comedic rap about a teacher. At sixteen, they played together in the band Skog (&quot;forest&quot;) with two other friends, releasing one EP, &quot;Tom Tids Tale&quot;, before breaking up and later forming the Kings duo.

The duo was signed to the American label Kindercore after appearing in European festivals during the summer of 1999. After a spell living in London in 2001, they released their debut album &quot;Quiet Is the New Loud&quot;. The album was produced by Coldplay producer Ken Nelson. The album was very successful and even lent its name to a small movement of musicians in the pop underground (including acoustic contemporaries such as Turin Brakes) which took Elliott Smith, Belle &amp; Sebastian and Simon &amp; Garfunkel as their inspiration and focused on more subtle melodies and messages. Kings of Convenience also inspired an indian music duo Parekh &amp; Singh.

&quot;Versus&quot;, an album of remixes of tracks from &quot;Quiet Is the New Loud&quot;, came out shortly after. After this breakthrough year, not much was heard from the band. Øye spent the next few years living in Berlin and doing solo material, releasing music under the &quot;DJ Kicks&quot; series as well as a solo album titled &quot;Unrest&quot;. He also had a side project named The Whitest Boy Alive.

It was not until 2004 that the Kings&#x27; follow-up &quot;Riot on an Empty Street&quot; was released. The video made for &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Dance With You&quot;, the second single from the album, topped MTV&#x27;s European list as the best music video of 2004. The album also featured contributions by Feist.

In January 2008 the band played concerts in the Northern Norwegian cities of Tromsø, Svolvær and Bodø, and Swedish city Umeå along with a concert in August in Stockholm. The band then toured North America, Latin America and Europe, including stops in Boston, New York, Toronto, Detroit; Latin American stops in Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Brazil and Chile, where they performed in Santiago with local musician Javiera Mena, who later opened for them in Spain and Portugal. European stops include Italy, Switzerland and Spain. On some of their American tour stops they appeared with the band Franklin for Short who joined them on stage for a few rousing numbers.

Their third album, called &quot;Declaration of Dependence&quot;, was released on 20 October 2009.

In June 2012, the band performed at the Primavera Sound festivals in both Barcelona and Porto.

In 2017, Eirik released an album entitled &#x27;Analog Dance Music&#x27; with his other band Kommode.

In March 2019, Kings of Convenience provided an update regarding their upcoming (fourth) album, stating that &quot;the songs were written and even performed live, but when we tried to record it during 2016/2017 for a mixture of reasons the results just weren’t good enough[, and] by that time I (Erlend) didn’t have anymore energy to pour into it[, ... so] 2018 was a charging battery year, and now we are planning to try again&quot;.

On 30 April 2021, Kings of Convenience released a new song, &quot;Rocky Trail&quot;, after 12 years without publishing music as the duo. They also announced, through their official social network channels, that their fourth studio album, &quot;Peace or Love&quot;, was released on 18 June 2021 via EMI.

<text>Motor Coach Industries (MCI) is a North American multinational bus manufacturer, specializing in production of motorcoaches. Best known for coaches produced for intercity transit and commuter buses, MCI produces coaches for a variety of applications, ranging from tour buses to prison buses.

Currently, MCI is headquartered in Des Plaines, Illinois. Since 2015, it has been a subsidiary of Canadian bus manufacturer NFI Group, the parent company of New Flyer Industries.

== History ==

The company was incorporated in 1933 by Harry Zoltok as Fort Garry Motor Body and Paint Works Limited, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. In 1948, Greyhound Lines of Canada, at that time MCI&#x27;s major customer, became a majority shareholder when it purchased 65 percent of the company. MCI was purchased outright by Greyhound Lines in 1958. In 1963 a new plant was opened in Pembina, North Dakota, to increase capacity as MCI began to expand into the U.S. market, while Greyhound widened its operations and switched increasingly from GMC to its own in-house products. In 1974 another plant was opened in Roswell, New Mexico, under the title Transportation Manufacturing Corporation (TMC).

In December 1986, Greyhound was split, with Greyhound Lines being sold to an investor group, and Greyhound Lines of Canada, MCI and TMC remaining part of The Greyhound Corporation, which was renamed Dial, Inc. in 1991.

In 1987, Greyhound Corporation bought the transit bus manufacturing operations of General Motors Diesel Division (GMC), which was based in Canada. (GM phased out intercity and transit bus construction at the large GMC Coach and Truck plant in Pontiac, Michigan, shifting medium duty school bus chassis production to Janesville, Wisconsin.)

MCI also took over production of GM&#x27;s RTS model, transferring production to TMC. MCI also purchased the GM bus assembly plant in Saint-Eustache, Quebec, which then produced GM&#x27;s Canadian transit bus model, the Classic. TMC ceased production of the older MCI vehicles in 1990 to concentrate on manufacturing the RTS, and on the A-Series intercity coaches.

In 1993 MCI became an independent corporation, Motor Coach Industries International Inc.

=== 1994 acquisition ===

In 1994, MCI stocks were purchased by Mexican DINA S.A., which had a long history of bus building and developed their HTQ proprietary technology (valued at 70 million dollars) that culminated with the creation of the Viaggio Confort Bus Line. MCI reproduced its Viaggio 1000 DOT for sale to the United States and Canada, and in late 1999/2000 the G4100, G4500 and F3500 models were released to the United States and to the Canadian markets. Production of the G4500 later moved to Winnipeg, after the G4100 was discontinued. Poor reliability of the G4500 resulted in very low sales after Greyhound Lines filed a lawsuit against MCI over the various issues with the bus. Greyhound took delivery of very few Winnipeg-built G4500s; these were later retired and sold. Related to a major contract cancellation by Western Star, DINA S.A. sold a great portion of its previously acquired MCI shares to Joseph Littlejohn &amp; Levy.

In 1994 TMC, including production rights for the RTS, was sold to NovaBus. In 1997 MCI purchased the rights from the bankrupt Flxible to produce the Flxible Metro and all related parts for it. After a period of waning product demand, increased competition and lay-offs in the early 2000s, production at MCI plants in Winnipeg and Pembina increased in 2006, and 130 employees were added.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, MCI consolidated its operations, the Winnipeg site was expanded and modernized. DINA S.A. purchased North American Symix and opened an assembly plant in Buenos Aires, Argentina and the DIMEX and DINAIR companies. A new coach finishing and paint facility and customer delivery centre were constructed on the site. At the same time, a seven-year contract was signed with the IAM union local. This agreement contained cost improvements and production operations flexibility to improve the productivity and competitiveness of the manufacturing and assembly operations.

The buses, especially the older MC-8 and workhorse MC-9 models of the 1980s, became the standard for interstate travel for many bus companies. Those particular buses featured metal frames and roof supports, metal panels on the sides and were extremely durable and reliable. Many of the buses, having survived millions of miles of commercial use, had a second career serving churches or other organizations, while the MCI/TMC coaches were popular &quot;conversion shells&quot;, used for motorhomes.

=== 2008 bankruptcy ===

Motor Coach Industries Inc. announced on September 15, 2008, the company had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as part of a restructuring the company said would &quot;help shed hundreds of millions of dollars of debt&quot;.

On April 17, 2009, Motor Coach Industries Inc. emerged from its voluntary Chapter 11 reorganization. MCI and its subsidiaries became wholly owned by KPS Capital Partners, LP. KPS Capital Partners, LP is the Manager of the KPS Special Situations Funds, a family of private equity limited partnerships with over $2.6 billion of committed capital focused on constructive investing in restructurings, turnarounds, and other special situations.

=== Partnership with Daimler AG ===

Motor Coach Industries announced on April 25, 2012, that it had reached a deal with German vehicle manufacturer Daimler AG to distribute its Setra brand of motorcoaches for the North American market. The agreement came as Daimler reconfigured its commercial bus operations in North America, also selling off its Orion brand of transit buses to New Flyer Industries.

Under the agreement, Setra would build its S407 and S417 motorcoaches in Germany and ship them to North America, where MCI would sell and service the coaches using its existing dealer network. In exchange, Daimler would purchase a 10 percent share in Motor Coach Industries.

The relationship between competitors was less than ideal. Daimler complained that MCI focused on its own motorcoaches, and did not allow for sufficient attention to the Setra brand.

The deal came to an end on January 4, 2018, with Daimler signing a new distribution rights agreement with REV Group, a U.S.-based specialty vehicle manufacturer. Sales of new motorcoaches transferred immediately, followed by the service agreement in mid-2018.

=== 2015 acquisition ===

On November 10, 2015, it was announced that Canadian bus manufacturer New Flyer Industries had agreed to acquire Motor Coach Industries, Inc. for C$604 million (approximately US$459 million). The deal closed in December 2015.

In late 2022, the factory in Pembina, North Dakota was planned to be shut down; this decision was later reversed, and the facility has since remained open. The U.S. assembly line was moved to the NFI group facility in Crookston, Minnesota.

==Operating subsidiaries==
*Motor Coach Industries, Ltd. – Canadian manufacturing facility, located in Winnipeg, Manitoba
*Motor Coach Industries, Inc. – U.S. manufacturing facility, located in Pembina, North Dakota
*Motor Coach Industries, Inc. – U.S. headquarters in Des Plaines, Illinois
*MCI Sales and Service, Inc. – U.S. new and used coach sales division
*MCI Service Parts – aftermarket parts sales division of the company, based in Des Plaines, Illinois, with its distribution center located in Louisville, Kentucky, with close access to the international UPS distribution center
*MCI Financial Services – coach financing division, based in Dallas, Texas

== Models ==

After the &quot;Courier&quot; and &quot;MC&quot; model name schemes, MCI adopted an alphanumerical system for naming the different series of coaches. Two different systems have been used:


For Example, a wheelchair-lift equipped, 45-foot, diesel powered, D-Series with fluted stainless steel sides from 1997 would be designated a 102-DLW3SS. A 45-foot, battery-electric powered J-Series from 2020 would be designated a J4500 CHARGE. Not all possible combinations of models, lengths, and powertrains are made.

===Current===
Motor Coach Industries currently produces two different product lines. All current models are wide, exclusive of mirrors.

===Past===

====Letter series (post-1985)====
====MC series (1958–1998)====
These models bore the MC-&quot;number&quot; designation.
====Courier series (pre-1960)====
===Transit (all discontinued)===

<doc id="443821" wikidata="Q642270" url="?curid=443821" title="United States Disciplinary Barracks">
<text>The United States Disciplinary Barracks (USDB), colloquially known as Leavenworth, is a military correctional facility located on Fort Leavenworth, a United States Army post in Kansas. It is one of two major prisons built on Fort Leavenworth property, the other is the military Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility, which opened on 5 October 2010. Together the facilities make up the Military Corrections Complex which is under the command of its commandant, who holds the rank of colonel, and serves as both the Army Corrections Brigade Commander and Deputy commander of The United States Army Corrections Command.

The USDB is the U.S. military&#x27;s only maximum-security facility that houses male service members convicted at court-martial for violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Only male service members with sentences over ten years are confined to the USDB. Those with sentences under ten years are confined in smaller facilities, such as the nearby Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility or the Naval Consolidated Brig at Chesapeake, Virginia. Corrections personnel at the facility are Army Corrections Specialists (MOS 31E) trained at the U.S. Army Military Police school located at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, as well as Marine and Air Force corrections personnel.

Female prisoners from all branches of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) are typically incarcerated in the Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar instead of the USDB.

==First facility==
Originally known as the United States Military Prison, the USDB was established by Act of Congress in 1874. Prisoners were used for the bulk of the construction, which began in 1875 and was completed in 1921. The facility was able to house up to 1,500 prisoners. From 1895 until 1903, prisoners from the USDB were used to construct the nearby United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth.

The original USDB followed the Pennsylvania plan modeling on a layout of the Eastern State Penitentiary where cell blocks radiated out from a central structure. Individual cells were relatively isolated. In contrast, the civilian prison, modeled on the Auburn Correctional Facility in New York, reflected a newer concept where prisoners were housed in a large rectangular building where there was a certain amount of communal living. The site covered with walls from high.

The original USDB was Fort Leavenworth&#x27;s biggest and tallest building sited at the corner of McPherson Avenue and Scott Avenue on bluffs above the Missouri River (). The old domed building was nicknamed &quot;Little Top&quot; in contrast to the domed federal prison south which was nicknamed the &quot;Big Top&quot;.

During World War I, two brothers named Joseph and Michael Hofer, died at Fort Leavenworth in 1918 after refusing to enlist or wear uniforms after they were drafted under the Selective Service Act of 1917. The pair of conscientious objectors, who were Christian Hutterites, were held in solitary confinement, beaten, and starved to death.

In 1988 the prison had 1,450 prisoners, including 21 women. This included 42 officers, the highest ranking being a lieutenant colonel. By 2014, all female prisoners have been moved to NAVCONBRIG Miramar. In August 1988, an inmate named David Newman escaped after hiding in Pope Hall while on Wood Shop detail. He assembled a ladder, kicked out a window and climbed over the wall between Towers 3 and 4. He was captured four days later in Kansas City. Following the escape, bars were placed on the windows of all buildings within the complex and interior chain link with razor wire top guard was placed between the buildings and the exterior stone walls. Shortly before the detention barracks closed more than 300 inmates refused lockdown on 12 May 1995. The uprising was put down by 150 correction officers.

In 2002, Gail Dillon of &quot;Airman&quot; magazine wrote of the old detention barracks:

A visitor would immediately notice the medieval ambiance of this institution – the well-worn native stone and brick walls constructed by long-forgotten inmates when &#x27;hard labor&#x27; meant exactly that – have witnessed thousands of inmates&#x27; prayers, curses, and pleas over the past 128 years&quot; and that entering the facility was &quot;like stepping back in time or suddenly being part of a kitschy movie set about a prison bust.

In the late 1990s, work began on a new purpose-built military detention center on the site of the former USDB Farm Colony. The largest buildings of the original barracks (&quot;The Castle&quot;) were torn down in 2004. The walls and ten of the buildings in the original location—including Pope Hall—have been converted or are in the process of being converted to other uses at Fort Leavenworth. The prison&#x27;s original commandant&#x27;s house still remains.

==Current facility==
The new state-of-the-art, 515-bed, disciplinary barrack, which cost $67.8 million ($ million in dollars), became operational in September 2002. It was built about a mile north of the original USDB at Fort Leavenworth. The new site is enclosed by two separate high fences. There are three housing units, each of which can accommodate up to 142 prisoners. The units, described as &quot;bow ties&quot;, are two-tiered, connected triangular shaped domiciles. The cells in the new facility have solid doors and a window. There are no bars. The new facility is said to be much quieter than the old one and is preferred by inmates. Colonel Colleen L. McGuire, the first female commandant of the USDB, said in 2002 that the new facility is &quot;much more efficient in design and layout – much brighter and lighter.&quot;

In 2009, the Barracks, along with the Standish Maximum Correctional Facility in Michigan, were being considered for relocation of 220 prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Kansas officials, including both U.S. Senators, objected to the transfer; Pat Roberts stated that the transfer would require 2,000 privately owned acres around the fort to be acquired through the use of eminent domain to establish a stand-off zone because the prison is on the perimeter of the fort.
The new prison reflects current prison design of smaller low-rise separate buildings where prisoners can be more easily isolated from the general population. In 2012 the facility received a 100% rating and the accolades from an assessment team from the American Correctional Association (ACA) (who have been auditing the sites since 1988). Three independent evaluators visited the prison facilities to check on more than 500 standards, including mental health services, safety issues, and other aspects of the facility related to humane treatment of inmates. The USDB received a top rating in all of the standards despite having a portion of its staffing deployed to Iraq. The facility has maintained this rating and score on each of its subsequent triennial inspections.

The USDB is staffed by both &quot;green-suiters,&quot; Service Members assigned to the 15th Military Police Brigade as well as DoD liaisons from each branch, and DA Civilians. Many soldiers have a designated Military Occupational Specialty 31E, corrections specialists, while treatment and support staff range from food services to occupational therapists and chaplains. The unit is designated a Direct Reporting Unit under Army Corrections Command, which was activated in Washington, D.C., in 2007 under the Provost Marshal General.

In August 2010, two inmates overpowered an MP guard in the Special Housing Unit. They then were joined by 11 others. The guard was freed by a special tactics unit which retook control of the Special Housing Unit. Several inmates and one rescuer sustained non-life-threatening injuries in the incident. This was the first such incident in the new prison.

==Cemetery==
Deceased prisoners who are not claimed by their family members are buried near the original USDB. There are 300 graves dating from approximately 1894 to 1957, 56 of which are unmarked and 14 that belong to German prisoners of war executed for the murder of fellow POWs. The executions were carried out in 1945, in three groups: five on 10 July, two on 14 July, and seven on 25 August. The most recent interment in the cemetery was in May 2023.

==Capital punishment==

The USDB houses the U.S. military’s death row inmates who have been convicted of one or more capital offenses under the UCMJ and sentenced to death by a court-martial. All four death row inmates currently awaiting execution are former U.S. military personnel convicted of murder; however, enemy combatants who are currently being tried before a military commission at Guantanamo Bay would be transferred to USDB for execution if they are convicted and sentenced to death.

Since 1945, there have been 21 executions at the USDB, including 14 German prisoners of war executed in 1945 for murder. The last execution by the U.S. military was the hanging of Army PFC John A. Bennett, on 13 April 1961, for the rape and attempted murder of an 11-year-old girl. Bennett&#x27;s execution took place four years after it was approved by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and then his successor President John F. Kennedy. Bennett applied to Kennedy for a stay of execution after an appeal to him from the Austrian victim and her parents for Bennett. This was promptly denied by the White House.

All executions at the USDB thus far have been by hanging, but lethal injection has been specified as the military&#x27;s current mode of execution. , there are four inmates on death row at the USDB, the most recent addition being Nidal Hasan.

The execution of Army private Ronald A. Gray, who has been on military death row since 1988, was approved by President George W. Bush on 28 July 2008. Gray was convicted of the rape, two murders and an attempted murder of three persons, two of them Army soldiers and the third a civilian taxi driver whose body was found on the post at Fort Cavazos (then Fort Hood). On 26 November 2008, a federal judge granted Gray a stay of execution to allow time for further appeals.

All 21 executions in the history of the USDB took place at the old facility. The old facility had a lethal injection chamber next to the men&#x27;s death row. The chamber was called the &quot;special processing unit&quot;. &quot;New York Daily News&quot; described the facility as &quot;virtually identical to the&quot; execution chamber at U.S. Penitentiary Terre Haute. When the new facility was constructed, though the federal death penalty moratorium had been in effect since 1972 meaning the sentence had not been carried out, there were still individuals sentenced and convictions being handed out that carried a possibility for the punishment.

The new facility does not have a death chamber; pursuant to the reinstatement of capital punishment at the federal level, all federal executions take place at United States Penitentiary Terre Haute.

Within the prison, death row is located in an isolated corridor away from other inmates. There are currently four men assigned to this area of the prison and four others formerly assigned, who were granted clemency by the President of the United States residing in general population.

<text>Greyhound Lines, Inc. (Greyhound), operates the largest intercity bus service in North America. Services include Greyhound Mexico, charter bus services, and Amtrak Thruway services. Greyhound operates 1,700 coaches produced mainly by Motor Coach Industries and Prevost serving 230 stations and 1,700 destinations. The company&#x27;s first route began in Hibbing, Minnesota, in 1914 and the company adopted the &quot;Greyhound&quot; name in 1929. The company is owned by Flix North America, Inc., an affiliate of (owner of FlixBus), and is based in downtown Dallas.
==History==
===1914–1930: early years===

In 1914, Eric Wickman, a 27-year-old Swedish immigrant, was laid off from his job as a drill operator at a mine in Alice, Minnesota. He became a Hupmobile salesman in Hibbing, Minnesota, and, when he could not sell the first seven-passenger Hupmobile that he received, he began using it along with fellow Swedish immigrant Andy &quot;Bus Andy&quot; Anderson and C. A. A. &quot;Arvid&quot; Heed to transport iron ore miners two miles from Hibbing to Alice for 15 cents per ride. Wickman made $2.25 on his first run.

Wickman almost gave up after the first winter due to the harsh driving conditions in Minnesota. However, he agreed to continue on by reducing his driving duties. In 1915, he added a 15-mile route to Nashwauk, Minnesota. In December 1915, Wickman merged his company with that of 19-year-old Ralph Bogan, who was running a similar transportation service from Hibbing to Duluth, Minnesota, to form the Mesaba Transportation Company. By 1918, the company had 18 vehicles and annual income of $40,000.

In 1922, Wickman and Heed sold their interests in the company to Bogan and Anderson. Wickman and Heed then moved to Duluth and acquired White Bus Lines. In 1924, Wickman formed Northland, which acquired the Superior-White Company; its founder, Orville S. Caesar, who had strong business acumen, mechanical skills, and ambition, eventually became president of the company. In 1925, the company completed the $2.5 million acquisition of eight independent bus lines in Minnesota. In 1928, Anderson and Bogan disbanded and sold most of the routes of the Mesaba Transportation Company to Northland.

The company continued to expand and, in 1928, it had income of $6 million and was offering trips all over the United States. In 1929, the company acquired the Yelloway-Pioneer System, which in 1928 made the first transcontinental bus trip, and The Pickwick Corporation.

In 1929, the company acquired additional interests in Gray Line Worldwide and part of the Colonial Motor Coach Company to form Eastern Greyhound Lines. It also acquired an interest in Northland Transportation Company and renamed it Northland Greyhound Lines.

===1930–1945===
By 1930, more than 100 bus lines had been consolidated into the parent company, then called Motor Transit Corporation. Recognizing the need for a more memorable name, the partners of the Motor Transit Corporation changed its name to The Greyhound Corporation after the Greyhound name used by earlier bus lines. According to company lore, that name came from a driver, Ed Stone, who was reminded of a greyhound when he saw a passing bus in a reflection.

Also in 1930, the company moved from Duluth, Minnesota to Chicago, Illinois.

The business suffered during the Great Depression, and by 1931 was over $1 million in debt. As the 1930s progressed and the economy improved, Greyhound began to prosper again.

In 1934, intercity bus lines, of which Greyhound was the largest carried approximately 400 million passengers — nearly as many passengers as the Class I railroads. The film &quot;It Happened One Night (1934)&quot; — about an heiress (Claudette Colbert) traveling by Greyhound bus with a reporter (Clark Gable) — has been credited by the company for spurring bus travel nationwide.

In 1935, national intercity bus ridership climbed 50% to 651,999,000 passengers, surpassing the volume of passengers carried by the Class I railroads for the first time. In 1935, Wickman reported record profits of $8 million. In 1936, already the largest bus carrier in the United States, Greyhound began taking delivery of 306 new buses.

In 1941, the company acquired Greyhound Canada.

Between 1937 and 1945, Greyhound built many new stations and acquired new buses in the period in the late Art Deco style known as Streamline Moderne. For terminals, Greyhound retained architects including William Strudwick Arrasmith and George D. Brown. Notable examples of Streamline Moderne stations include the Blytheville Greyhound Bus Station, Cleveland, Ohio Greyhound Bus Station, Columbia, South Carolina Greyhound Bus Station, and the Old Washington, D.C. Greyhound Bus Station.

Greyhound worked with the Yellow Coach Manufacturing Company for its streamlined Series 700 buses, first for &quot;Series 719&quot; prototypes in 1934, and from 1937 as the exclusive customer for Yellow&#x27;s &quot;Series 743&quot; bus (which Greyhound named the &quot;Super Coach&quot;). Greyhound bought a total of 1,256 buses between 1937 and 1939.

By the beginning of World War II, the company had 4,750 stations and nearly 10,000 employees.

===1945–1983: expansion, desegregation, and diversification===

Wickman retired as president of the Greyhound Corporation in 1946 and was replaced by his long-time partner Orville S. Caesar. Wickman died at the age of 66 in 1954.
Greyhound commissioned industrial designer Raymond Loewy and General Motors to design several distinctive buses from the 1930s through the 1950s. Loewy&#x27;s first was the Yellow Coach PDG-4101, the Greyhound &quot;Silversides&quot; produced in 1940-1941. Production was suspended during World War II. When the &quot;Silversides&quot; buses resumed production in 1947, it was renamed GM PD 3751. PD 3751 production continued through 1948. In 1954, the first of Greyhound&#x27;s distinctive hump-backed buses was introduced. In 1944, Loewy had produced drawings for the GM GX-1, a full double-decker parlor bus with the first prototype built in 1953. The PD-4501 Scenicruiser was designed by Roland E. Gegoux and built by General Motors as model PD-4501. The front of the bus was markedly lower than its rear section.

After World War II, and the building of the Interstate Highway System beginning in 1956, automobile travel became a preferred mode of travel in the United States. This, combined with the increasing affordability of air travel, led to a decline in business for Greyhound and other intercity bus carriers.

In October 1953, Greyhound acquired the Tennessee Coach Company&#x27;s entire operation, and the negotiations for the Blue Ridge Lines, and its affiliate White Star Lines, that operated between Cleveland and the Mid Atlantic Seaboard.

In 1955, the Interstate Commerce Commission ruled in the case of &quot;Keys v. Carolina Coach Co.&quot; that U.S. interstate bus operations, such as Greyhound&#x27;s, could not be segregated by race. In 1960, in the case of &quot;Boynton v. Virginia&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court found that an African American had been wrongfully convicted for trespassing in a &quot;whites only&quot; terminal area. In May 1961, Civil Rights Movement activists organized interracial Freedom Rides as proof of the desegregation rulings. On May 14, a mob attacked a pair of buses (a &quot;Greyhound&quot; and a &quot;Trailways&quot;) traveling from Washington, D.C., to New Orleans, Louisiana, and slashed the Greyhound bus&#x27;s tires. Several miles outside of Anniston, Alabama, the mob forced the Greyhound bus to stop, broke its windows, and firebombed it. The mob held the bus&#x27; doors shut, intending to burn the riders to death. Sources disagree, but either an exploding fuel tank or an undercover state investigator brandishing a revolver caused the mob to retreat. When the riders escaped the bus, the mob beat them, while warning shots fired into the air by highway patrolmen prevented them from being lynched. Additional Freedom Riders were beaten by a mob at the Greyhound Station in Montgomery Alabama.
The Civil Rights Act of 1964&#x27;s Title II and Title III broadened protections beyond federally regulated carriers such as Greyhound, to include non-discrimination in hotels, restaurants, and other public accommodations, as well as state and local government buildings.

Later in the 1960s, Greyhound leadership ridership declined and Greyhound used the profitable bus operations to invest in other industries.

In 1966, Gerald H. Trautman became president and CEO of the company.

In 1970, the company acquired Armour and Company meat-packing company, which owned the Dial deodorant soap brand, for $400 million.

In 1971, Greyhound moved its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona.

The company also acquired Traveller&#x27;s Express money orders, MCI and TMC bus manufacturing companies, and airliner leasing.

In the late 1970s, Greyhound began hiring African American and female drivers for the first time.
In 1972, Greyhound introduced the unlimited mileage Ameripass. The pass was initially marketed as offering &quot;99 days for $99&quot; or, transportation to anywhere at any time for a dollar a day. For decades, it was a popular choice for people traveling across the U.S. on a budget. Over time, Greyhound raised the price of the pass, shortened its validity period and rebranded it as the Discovery Pass, until it was discontinued in 2012.

Greyhound acquired Premier Cruise Line in 1984. Between 1985 and 1993, Premier operated as the &quot;Official Cruise Line of Walt Disney World&quot; with onboard Disney characters.

===1983–2001: consolidation, strikes, and bankruptcies===
====1983 Greyhound drivers&#x27; strike====
In 1983, Greyhound operated a fleet of 3,800 buses and carried about 60% of the intercity bus-travel market in the United States.

Starting November 2, 1983, Greyhound suffered a major and bitter drivers&#x27; strike action. A fatality occurred in Zanesville, Ohio, when a replacement driver ran over a striking worker at a picket line. A new contract was ratified on December 19, 1983 and drivers returned to work the next day.

====1986–1990: spin-off, merger, and first bankruptcy====
In early 1987, the bus line was acquired by an investor group led by Fred Currey, a former executive of rival Continental Trailways, who became CEO of Greyhound and relocated its headquarters to Dallas, Texas.

In February 1987, Greyhound Lines&#x27; new ownership and the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) agreed on a new, 3-year contract.

In June 1987, Greyhound Lines acquired &quot;Trailways, Inc.&quot; (formerly &quot;Continental Trailways&quot;), the largest member of the rival Trailways Transportation System, effectively consolidating into a national bus service. Greyhound was required by the Interstate Commerce Commission to maintain coordinated schedules with other scheduled service operators in the U.S.

Between 1987 and 1990, Greyhound Lines&#x27; former parent continued to be called The Greyhound Corporation, confusing passengers and investors alike. The Greyhound Corporation retained Premier Cruise Lines and ten non-bus subsidiaries using the Greyhound name, such as Greyhound Leisure Services, Inc. (an operator of airport and cruise ship duty-free shops), and Greyhound Exhibits. In March 1990, The Greyhound Corporation changed its name to Greyhound Dial Corporation. Because Greyhound Dial&#x27;s switchboard continued to get questions from misdirected bus passengers, it changed its name to The Dial Corporation in March 1991, to eliminate any association with bus travel.

====1990: Greyhound drivers&#x27; strike====
In early 1990, the drivers&#x27; contract from 1987 expired at the end of its three-year term. In March, the ATU began a strike action against Greyhound. The 1990 drivers&#x27; strike was similar in its bitterness to the strike of 1983, with violence against both strikers and their replacement workers. One striker in California was killed by a Greyhound bus driven by a strikebreaker, and a shot was fired at a Greyhound bus. While Greyhound CEO Fred Currey argued that &quot;no American worth his salt negotiates with terrorists,&quot; ATU leader Edward M. Strait responded that management&#x27;s failure to negotiate amounted to &quot;putting the negotiations back into the hands of terrorists.&quot; During the strike by its 6,300 drivers, Greyhound idled much of its fleet of 3,949 buses and cancelled 80% of its routes. At the same time, Greyhound was having to contend with the rise of low-cost airlines such as Southwest Airlines, which further reduced the market for long-distance inter-city bus transportation. Without the financial strength provided in the past by a parent company, the strike&#x27;s lower revenues and higher costs for security and labor-law penalties caused Greyhound to file for bankruptcy in June 1990. The strike was not settled until May 1993, 38 months later, under terms favorable to Greyhound. While the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had awarded damages for unfair labor practices to the strikers, this liability was discharged during bankruptcy reorganization. Greyhound agreed to pay $22 million in back wages to union drivers, recall 550 of the remaining strikers, reinstate most of the 200 strikers who were fired for alleged misconduct, and increase hourly pay for drivers to $16.55 from $13.83 by March 1998.

====Early 1990s: bankruptcy and antitrust cases====
In August 1991, Greyhound emerged from bankruptcy by which time it had shrunk its overall workforce to 7,900 employees from 12,000 pre-bankruptcy, and trimmed its fleet to 2,750 buses and 3,600 drivers.

In August 1992, Greyhound canceled its bus terminal license (BTL) agreements with other carriers at 200 terminals, and imposed the requirement that Greyhound be the sole-seller of the tenant&#x27;s bus tickets within a 25-mile radius of such a Greyhound terminal. In 1995, the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division brought suit to stop this practice, alleging that it was an illegal restraint of trade, bad for consumers, and reduced competition. In February 1996, the DOJ won its case, and Greyhound agreed to permit its tenants to sell tickets nearby and permit its tenants to honor interline tickets with competitors.

Greyhound&#x27;s total revenues in 1994 were $616 million. At that time, the company was offering $10 fares due to competition.

In September 1998, Greyhound promised to make accommodations for disabled passengers, including equipping most buses with wheelchair lifts.

====2001: Trailways-Laidlaw mergers and bankruptcy====

In the late 1990s, Greyhound Lines acquired two more members of the National Trailways Bus System. The company purchased &quot;Carolina Trailways&quot; in 1997, followed by the intercity operations of &quot;Southeastern Trailways&quot; in 1998. Following the acquisitions, most of the remaining members of the &quot;Trailways System&quot; began interlining cooperatively with Greyhound, discontinued their scheduled route services, diversified into charters and tours, or went out of business altogether.

On September 3, 1997, Burlington, Ontario–based transportation conglomerate Laidlaw announced it would buy Greyhound Canada, Greyhound&#x27;s Canadian operations, for US$72 million.

In October 1998, Laidlaw announced it would acquire the U.S. operations of Greyhound Lines, Inc., including Carolina Trailways and other Greyhound affiliates, for about $470 million. The acquisition was completed in March 1999.

In June 2001, after incurring heavy losses through its investments in Greyhound Lines and other parts of its diversified business, Laidlaw filed for bankruptcy protection in both the U.S. and Canada.

===2002–2007: Laidlaw ownership===
Naperville, Illinois–based Laidlaw International, Inc. listed its common shares on the New York Stock Exchange on February 10, 2003 and emerged from re-organization on June 23, 2003 as the successor to Laidlaw Inc.

By 2003, Greyhound faced significant competition in the northeast from Chinatown bus lines. More than 250 buses, operated by competitors such as Fung Wah Bus Transportation and Lucky Star Bus were competing fiercely from curbsides in the Chinatowns of New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. When operating on inter-city routes, the Chinatown buses offered prices about 50% less than Greyhound&#x27;s. Between 1997 and 2007, Chinatown buses took 60% of Greyhound&#x27;s market share in the northeast United States.

In 2003, Greyhound expanded its QuickLink service, Greyhound&#x27;s brand of commuter bus service that runs frequently during the peak weekday commuting hours. Routes were operated from Sacramento, California to the San Francisco Bay Area and Macon, Georgia to Atlanta.

In 2004, Greyhound dropped low-demand rural stops and started concentrating on dense, inter-metropolitan routes. It cut nearly 37% of its network. In some rural areas, particularly in the Plains states, parts of the upper Midwest (such as Wisconsin), and the Pacific Northwest, local operators took over the old stops, often with government subsidies.

===2007–2021: FirstGroup ownership===


On February 7, 2007, Scottish transport group FirstGroup announced the acquisition of Laidlaw International for $3.6 billion, which closed on October 1, 2007.

Almost immediately after acquiring the carrier, FirstGroup sought to improve Greyhound&#x27;s image by refurbishing many terminals, expanding the fleet with new buses, refurbishing old buses, and retraining customer service staff. Greyhound also started a new advertising campaign with Butler, Shine, Stern &amp; Partners aimed at attracting 18- to 24-year-olds and Hispanics.

Although FirstGroup&#x27;s interest was primarily the school and transit bus operations of Laidlaw, FirstGroup retained the Greyhound operations and in 2009 exported the brand to the United Kingdom as Greyhound UK (unrelated to bus operator Greyhound Motors which operated from 1921 to 1972).

In 2008, Greyhound&#x27;s three regional bus operations (Carolina Trailways, based in Raleigh, N.C., Vermont Transit Lines of Burlington, Vermont, and Texas, New Mexico &amp; Oklahoma Coaches of Lubbock, Texas [&quot;T.N.M.&amp;O.&quot;]) were consolidated into Greyhound Lines.

On March 27, 2008, Greyhound launched service under the BoltBus brand. The first buses started running between Boston, New York City, and Washington, D.C. In the Northeastern U.S., BoltBus was originally operated in partnership with Peter Pan Bus Lines, but this arrangement ended on September 27, 2017, with Greyhound continuing the brand alone. BoltBus expanded to the West Coast in May 2012 with a route in the Pacific Northwest between Vancouver, BC, Seattle, and Portland. Service was expanded again in October 2013 with a route between the two largest metropolitan areas in California, Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area (San Jose and Oakland). A stop in San Francisco was added in December 2013 along with a route between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.

Beginning in 2009, all buses purchased have three-point seat belts installed.

In 2010, in response to competition from Megabus and Chinatown bus lines, the company launched &quot;Greyhound Express&quot;, featuring newer buses and fewer stops.

In February 2013, in partnership with DriveCam, Greyhound deployed video cameras across its entire fleet to increase safety and driver compliance by combining data and video analytics with real-time driver feedback and coaching.

As of 2014, Greyhound&#x27;s 1,229 buses served over 3,800 destinations in North America, traveling 5.5 billion miles (8.8 billion km) on North America&#x27;s roads.

In 2014, the company introduced a refreshed logo and a new navy blue and dark gray livery for buses. Buses were refurbished to add wireless Internet access, power outlets, and leather seating with increased legroom.

Before 2014, Greyhound was criticized for overbooking, often leaving passengers to wait for the next bus departure. Shortly after the sale to FirstGroup closed, Greyhound began a program in select markets, where riders could reserve a seat for an additional $5. However, only a limited number of seats could be reserved and the fee would have to be paid at the terminal&#x27;s ticketing counter, even if the ticket was bought in advance online. In 2014, Greyhound rolled out a new yield management computer system, enabling the company to more closely manage the number of tickets sold for each departure and dynamically adjust pricing based on sales. Although the amount of overbooked buses has been sharply reduced with this new system, Greyhound still does not explicitly guarantee a seat to everyone with a ticket (except on Greyhound Express routes).

In 2014, Greyhound reported a profit of $73 million on revenues of $990.6 million, and attributed the company&#x27;s success to a mix of changing urban populations and a focus on more profitable routes with higher demand.

In 2013–2015, Greyhound expanded its Greyhound Connect service, which operates shorter routes to take passengers from stops in smaller, rural cities to stations in larger, urban cities. Some routes are operated using funds from the &quot;Federal Formula Grant Program for Rural Areas&quot; from the Federal Transit Administration.

In July 2015, the company announced that it would open terminals in Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and begin service between the two cities and Texas, claiming to be the first American bus company to operate an intra-Mexican route. In September 2015, Greyhound announced expanded service in Missouri and Kansas shortly after Megabus announced that it would be ending service to several cities and college campuses.

The company&#x27;s Lucky Streak brand is for routes to/from cities with casinos. All fares are sold as open-ended round-trips, with passengers allowed to return to their origin at any time. On the Atlantic City routes, casinos offer special bonuses (gambling credit, room/dining discounts) to Lucky Streak passengers. Lucky Streak routes serve Atlantic City (to/from Baltimore, Brooklyn, New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.), Connecticut (Mohegan Sun &amp; Foxwoods Casino) (to/from Boston, Bridgeport, New Haven, New York City, Providence, and Stamford), and Las Vegas (to/from Anaheim, Barstow, Claremont, Compton, El Monte, Hollywood, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Ana, and Victorville).

In February 2020, the company reversed its position regarding unwarranted searches and notified the Department of Homeland Security that it no longer would allow unwarranted searches on its buses, in areas of terminals, company offices, or any area where a person needs a ticket for access.

In December 2020, the company sold the customer terminal facility in Los Angeles, as well as facilities in Denver, Colorado, and Ottawa, Canada for a total of $137 million. The facility in Denver was sold for $38 million.

In May 2021, Greyhound Canada shut down all of its bus routes in Canada. Greyhound Lines continues to operate four cross-border routes that either start or finish in the U.S. from Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver: the company also placed 38 buses used by its Canada division up for auction.

In July 2021, BoltBus suspended operations indefinitely and Greyhound took over all routes.

In July 2021, the bus station in Columbus, Ohio, was sold to the Central Ohio Transit Authority for $9.5 million. In October 2021, the bus station in Downtown Louisville was sold for $2.8 million. The bus station in Cincinnati was sold to a real estate company for $4.25 million, with plans to convert it to parking.

In September 2021, the company agreed to pay $2.2 million to settle a lawsuit over its practice of allowing U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to board its buses in Washington State to conduct warrantless immigration sweeps. The company had been criticized for allowing government officials to arrest its customers who were illegally in the country.

===2021–present: FlixMobility===
On October 21, 2021, Munich-based Flix SE acquired Greyhound for $78 million.

In 2022, FirstGroup sold almost all its remaining Greyhound properties to Twenty Lake Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Alden Global Capital, for approximately $140 million. Twenty Lake began closing the properties in 2023, leaving Greyhound passengers without sheltered waiting spaces or amenities at stations. Bus depot and station closures continued in 2024.

==Notable incidents and collisions==

Below is a list of major incidents and collisions on Greyhound buses and buses of subsidiaries in the United States.

* August 4, 1952: in Greyhound&#x27;s most deadly collision, two Greyhound buses collided head-on with each other along U.S. Route 81 near Waco, Texas. The fuel tanks of both buses then ruptured, bursting into flames. Of the 56 persons aboard both coaches, 28 were killed, including both drivers.
* May 13, 1972: near Bean Station, Tennessee, between Knoxville and Bristol, a Greyhound Scenicruiser on a scheduled trip from Memphis to New York City collided head-on with a tractor-trailer truck. The driver of the bus had begun to pass a car. Fourteen people, including both the bus and truck drivers, died. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the cause of the crash was the Greyhound driver&#x27;s overtaking maneuver and his failure to avoid the truck.
* May 9, 1980: the cargo ship MV &quot;Summit Venture&quot; collided with the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, near St. Petersburg, Florida, causing a part of the roadway to collapse and causing several vehicles, including a Greyhound bus, to fall into Tampa Bay. All 26 people aboard the bus died, as did nine others.
* December 18, 1990: a Greyhound bus left Salt Lake City for Chicago and was caught in a driving snowstorm on I-80. Just short of the Wyoming border, the bus was hit by a semi-tractor trailer that had crossed the median heading in the opposite direction. The force of the collision tipped the bus onto its right side and it fell down a steep embankment. The bus slid for 150 feet and came to rest against a fence, about 35 feet below the eastbound lanes of I-80. Seven passengers were killed and more than 40 injured.
* June 20, 1998: a Greyhound bus on a scheduled trip from New York City to Pittsburgh ran off a road near Burnt Cabins, Pennsylvania, and hit a truck parked in an emergency parking area. Six passengers and the driver died. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the collision was the driver&#x27;s use of a sedating antihistamine and driver fatigue, due to an irregular work-rest schedule.
* October 3, 2001: in the 2001 Greyhound bus attack, at approximately 4:15a.m. local time, a passenger, Damir Igric, assaulted the driver of his bus, attempting to slit his throat, and causing the bus to crash near Manchester, Tennessee, killing Igric himself and five other passengers and injuring 32 others. Since the incident occurred three weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks, Greyhound temporarily suspended all schedules as soon as the company learned of the incident for fear that it may have been part of a larger coordinated attack. After investigation by the company and the FBI, it was confirmed that Igric had acted alone and service resumed later that afternoon. After the incident, Greyhound bus stations increased security, though not nearly to the same level as airports or train stations.
* September 30, 2002: Arturo Martinez Tapia assaulted a Greyhound driver near Fresno, California, resulting in two passenger deaths after the bus rolled off an embankment and crashed. Following this attack, an aisle gate and driver&#x27;s shield were installed on most Greyhound buses to prevent passengers from having direct contact with the driver when the bus is in motion, even if the aisle gate is forced open. The project was funded by a $16 million grant from the Transportation Security Administration.

* January 23, 2014: Maquel Donyel Morris, who was reportedly hallucinating, screamed &quot;everybody&#x27;s going to die,&quot; attacked the driver, and grabbed the steering wheel of a bus traveling on Interstate 10 near Tonopah, Arizona, west of Phoenix. 24 passengers were injured, including 21 who were airlifted to nearby hospitals. Police credited the driver for keeping the bus upright and preventing it from crossing into oncoming traffic.
* January 19, 2016: an overnight bus carrying 20 passengers that had departed from Los Angeles the previous night crashed on Highway 101 in San Jose, California, killing two and hospitalizing eight others. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the crash was the failure of the California Department of Transportation to properly delineate the crash attenuator and the gore area.
* July 12, 2018: on a bus traveling from Columbus to Cincinnati, Ohio, three Colombian athletes on the Comunidad el Oso Ultimate club claimed they were thrown off one of the buses for speaking Spanish. Greyhound indicated the players had become unruly because they were not dropped off where they wanted to be dropped off, which was a place other than their ticketed destination. The driver left them and all their luggage at a gas station. The players were traveling to the World Flying Disc Federation&#x27;s World Ultimate Club Championships. They were picked up by the Ohio police soon after and dropped off at their hotel in Cincinnati.
* August 30, 2018: a Greyhound bus traveling from St. Louis to Los Angeles was involved in a collision with a semi-truck on Interstate 40 westbound near Thoreau, New Mexico. One of the tires on the eastbound truck blew out and caused the driver to lose control and cross the median, colliding with the bus. Of the 48 onboard, 8 people, including the driver, were killed, and several more sustained injuries.
* February 3, 2020: one person was killed and five others were injured when a passenger opened fire on a bus heading from Los Angeles to San Francisco. At the time of the shooting, the bus was travelling northbound on Interstate 5 near Grapevine, California. After the shooting, the driver pulled to the side of the highway and convinced the shooter to get off the bus. The driver then continued down the highway to a gas station to get medical assistance for the injured passengers. The suspect, still on the side of the highway, was later arrested without incident.
* February 2, 2022: one person was killed and four others were injured when a fellow passenger opened fire on them as they exited a Los Angeles-bound bus after it stopped at a convenience store in the city of Oroville, California. Passengers reported that, earlier in the trip, the suspect exhibited paranoid behavior and showed the firearm he had in a bag on the bus. After the shooting, the suspect dropped the gun and ran into a Walmart, where he was found naked and arrested after getting into a fight.
* July 12, 2023: shortly before 2a.m., a westbound Greyhound bus, traveling from Indianapolis to St. Louis, struck three semi tractor trailers parked along the I-70 Silver Lake rest area exit ramp near Highland, Illinois. Three people were killed and 14 were seriously injured; four injured passengers were taken by helicopter to hospitals, the rest by ambulance. Although Illinois law prohibits trucks from parking along exit ramps, industry observers say there has been a nationwide shortage of overnight parking places. The National Transportation Safety Board expects the investigation to take between one and two years.

<text>The Full Gospel Fellowship of Churches and Ministers, International (FGFCMI), also known simply as The Fellowship, is a fellowship of like-minded Finished Work Pentecostal churches and ministers.

The Fellowship was formed from the common thought of some 100 ministers in the Voice of Healing movement that began in 1948. 

On September 18 and 19, 1962 Gordon Lindsay, who was a prominent voice in the movement at the time, held a convention at the Baker Hotel in Dallas for interested ministers. Plans were laid and the Full Gospel Fellowship of Churches &amp; Ministers International was born. Temporary officers were elected to serve until the great National Convention in latter part of June 1963. John Mears President, J.C. Hibbard Vice-President, Gordon Lindsay Secretary-Treasurer, W. A. Raiford Executive Secretary. June 28, 1963, A. C. Valdez was elected president.

The implication of the terminology &quot;Full Gospel&quot; is that many
mainline denominations leave out parts of the gospel - such as miracles,
speaking in tongues, divine healing, while the &quot;Full Gospel&quot; maintains
it in its entirety and for every aspect of the individual.

Though its full constitutional name is still the &quot;Full Gospel Fellowship of Churches &amp; Ministers International&quot;, its shortened name for common use is
&quot;The Fellowship&quot;. &quot;The Fellowship&quot; maintains offices in Irving, Texas. In 2006, there were 902 participating churches with 414,100 members.

<doc id="443834" wikidata="Q315747" url="?curid=443834" title="Georges Ernest Boulanger">
<text>Georges Ernest Jean-Marie Boulanger (29 April 1837 – 30 September 1891), nicknamed Général Revanche (&quot;General Revenge&quot;), was a French general and politician. An enormously popular public figure during the second decade of the Third Republic, he won multiple elections. At the zenith of his popularity in January 1889, he was feared to be powerful enough to establish himself as dictator. His base of support was the working-class districts of Paris and other cities, plus rural traditionalist Catholics and royalists. He introduced an obsessive and almost pathological anti-German sentiment, known as revanchism, which demanded the complete destruction of Imperial Germany as vengeance for the defeat and fall of the Second French Empire during the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), into French culture and accordingly laid the foundations for the outbreak of the First World War.

The elections of September 1889 marked a decisive defeat for the Boulangists. Changes in the electoral laws prevented Boulanger from running in multiple constituencies and the aggressive opposition of the established government, combined with Boulanger&#x27;s self-imposed exile, contributed to a rapid decline of the movement. The decline of Boulanger severely undermined the political strength of the conservative and royalist elements of French political life; they would not recover strength until the establishment of the Vichy regime in 1940. The defeat of the Boulangists ushered in a period of political dominance by the Opportunist Republicans.

Academics have attributed the failure of the movement to Boulanger&#x27;s own weaknesses. Despite his charisma, he lacked coolness, consistency, and decisiveness; he was a mediocre leader who lacked vision and courage. He was never able to unite the disparate elements, ranging from the far left to the far right, that formed the base of his support. He was able, however, to frighten Republicans and force them to reorganize and strengthen their solidarity in opposition to him.

== Early life and career ==
Boulanger was born on 29 April 1837 in Rennes, Brittany. He was the youngest of three children born to Ernest Boulanger (1805–1884), a lawyer in Bourg-des-Comptes, and Mary-Ann Webb Griffith (1804–1894), born in Bristol to a Welsh aristocratic family (the Griffiths of Burton Agnes). His brother Ernest enlisted in the Union Army and was killed in action during the American Civil War. After attending the Lycée of Nantes, Boulanger entered the Saint-Cyr Military Academy in 1855, graduating and entering the French Army in 1856.

Boulanger first saw action in 1857 in Kabylia, during the French conquest of Algeria. He fought in the Austro-Sardinian War (he was wounded at Robecchetto con Induno, where he received the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot;) and in the Cochinchina campaign, after which he became a captain and instructor at Saint-Cyr. During the Franco-Prussian War, Boulanger was noted for his bravery, and soon promoted to &quot;chef de bataillon&quot;; he was again wounded while fighting at Champigny-sur-Marne during the Siege of Paris. Subsequently, Boulanger was among the Third Republic military leaders who crushed the Paris Commune in April–May 1871. He was wounded a third time as he led troops to the siege of the Panthéon, and was promoted commander of the &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; by Patrice de MacMahon. However, he was soon demoted (as his position was considered provisional), and his resignation in protest was rejected.

With backing from his direct superior, Henri d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Aumale (incidentally, one of the sons of former King Louis-Philippe), Boulanger was made a brigadier-general in 1880, and in 1882 Minister of War Jean-Baptiste Billot appointed him director of infantry at the war office, enabling him to make a name as a military reformer (he took measures to improve morale and efficiency). In 1884, he was promoted to general of division and appointed to command the army occupying Tunisia, but was recalled owing to his differences of opinion with Pierre-Paul Cambon, the political resident. He returned to Paris, and began to take part in politics under the aegis of Georges Clemenceau and the Radicals. In January 1886, when Charles de Freycinet was brought into power, Clemenceau used his influence to secure Boulanger&#x27;s appointment as War Minister (replacing Jean-Baptiste Campenon). Clemenceau assumed Boulanger was a republican, because he was known not to attend Mass. However Boulanger would soon prove himself a conservative and monarchist.

== Minister of War==

It was in the capacity of Minister of War that Boulanger gained most popularity. He introduced reforms for the benefit of soldiers (such as allowing soldiers to grow beards) and appealed to the French desire for revenge against Imperial Germany—in doing so, he came to be regarded as the man destined to serve that revenge (nicknamed &quot;Général Revanche&quot;). He also managed to quell the major workers&#x27; strike in Decazeville. A minor scandal arose when Philippe, comte de Paris, the nominal inheritor of the French throne in the eyes of Orléanist monarchists, married his daughter Amélie to Portugal&#x27;s Carlos I, in a lavish wedding that provoked fears of anti-Republican ambitions. The French parliament hastily passed a law expelling all possible claimants to the crown from French territories. Boulanger communicated to d&#x27;Aumale his expulsion from the armed forces. He received the adulation of the public and the press after the Sino-French War, when France&#x27;s victory added Tonkin to its colonial empire.

He also vigorously pressed for the accelerated adoption, in just first five months of 1886, of a new rifle for the technically revolutionary smokeless powder Poudre B developed by P. Vielle two years earlier. Essentially, that backfired: hastily developed 8×50mmR Lebel cartridge became an unprecedented high-velocity ammunition but due to its double taper and rim handicapped French firearm development for decades to come, and hastily designed Lebel Model 1886 rifle, essentially a strengthened Kropatschek rifle from late 1870s, became obsolete much faster than any of the magazine rifles of other European militaries that followed during late 1880s and 1890s (before Boulanger, the French military planned to adopt a much more modern design as well). Boulanger also ordered to produce a million rifles by May 1887, but his proposal how to achieve that was entirely unrealistic (with the best efforts in manufacturing it took several years).

On Freycinet&#x27;s defeat in December of the same year, Boulanger was retained by René Goblet at the war office. Confident of political support, the general began provoking the Germans; he ordered military facilities to be built in the border region of Belfort, forbade the export of horses to German markets, and even instigated a ban on presentations of &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. Germany responded by calling to arms more than 70,000 reservists in February 1887. After the Schnaebele incident (April 1887), war was averted, but Boulanger was perceived by his supporters as coming out on top against Bismarck. For the Goblet government, Boulanger was an embarrassment and risk, and became engaged in a dispute with Foreign Minister Émile Flourens. On 17 May Goblet was voted out of office and replaced by Maurice Rouvier. The latter sacked Boulanger, and replaced him with on 30 May.

== The rise of &quot;Boulangisme&quot; ==

The government was astonished by the revelation that Boulanger had received around 100,000 votes for the partial election in Seine, without even being a candidate. He was removed from the Paris region and sent to the provinces, appointed commander of the troops stationed in Clermont-Ferrand. Upon his departure on 8 July, a crowd of ten thousand took the Gare de Lyon by storm, covering his train with posters titled &quot;Il reviendra&quot; (&quot;He will come back&quot;), and blocking the railway, but he was smuggled out.

The general decided to gather support for his own movement, an eclectic one that capitalized on the frustrations of French conservatism, advocating the three principles of &quot;Revanche&quot; (revenge on Germany), &quot;Révision&quot; (revision of the constitution), &quot;Restauration&quot; (restoration of the monarchy). The common reference to it has become &quot;Boulangisme&quot;, a term used by its partisans and adversaries alike. Immediately, the new popular movement was backed by notable conservative figures such as Count Arthur Dillon, Alfred Joseph Naquet, Anne de Rochechouart de Mortemart (Duchess of Uzès, who financed him with immense sums), Arthur Meyer, Paul Déroulède (and his &quot;Ligue des Patriotes&quot;).

After the political corruption scandal surrounding President Jules Grévy’s son-in-law Daniel Wilson, who was secretly selling &quot;Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; medals, the Republican government was brought into disrepute and Boulanger&#x27;s popular appeal rose in contrast. His position became essential after Grévy was forced to resign due to the scandal: in January 1888, the &quot;boulangistes&quot; promised to back any candidate for the presidency that would in turn offer his support to Boulanger for the post of War Minister (France was a parliamentary republic). The crisis was cut short by the election of Sadi Carnot and the appointment of Pierre Tirard as Prime Minister—Tirard refused to include Boulanger in his cabinet. During the period, Boulanger was in Switzerland, where he met with Prince Napoléon-Jérôme Bonaparte, technically a Bonapartist, who offered his full support to the cause. The Bonapartists had attached themselves to the general, and even the Comte de Paris encouraged his followers to support him. Once seen as a republican, Boulanger showed his true colors in the camp of the conservative monarchists. On 26 March 1888 he was expelled from the army. The day after, Daniel Wilson had his imprisonment repealed. It seemed to the French people that honorable generals were punished while corrupt politicians were spared, further increasing Boulanger&#x27;s popularity.

Although he was not in fact a legal candidate for the French Chamber of Deputies (since he was a military man), Boulanger ran with Bonapartist backing in seven separate &quot;départements&quot; during the remainder of 1888. &quot;Boulangiste&quot; candidates were present in every &quot;département&quot;. Consequently, he and many of his supporters were voted to the Chamber, and accompanied by a large crowd on 12 July, the day of their swearing in—the general himself was elected in the constituency of Nord. The &quot;boulangistes&quot; were, nonetheless, a minority in the Chamber. Since Boulanger could not pass legislation, his actions were directed to maintaining his public image. Neither his failure as an orator nor his defeat in a duel with Charles Thomas Floquet, then an elderly civilian and the Minister of the Interior, reduced the enthusiasm of his popular following.

During 1888 his personality was the dominating feature of French politics, and, when he resigned his seat as a protest against the reception given by the Chamber to his proposals, constituencies vied with one another in selecting him as their representative. His name was the theme of the popular song &quot;C&#x27;est Boulanger qu&#x27;il nous faut&quot; (&quot;Boulanger is the One We Need&quot;), he and his black horse became the idol of the Parisian population, and he was urged to run for the presidency. The general agreed, but his personal ambitions soon alienated his republican supporters, who recognised in him a potential military dictator. Numerous monarchists continued to give him financial aid, even though Boulanger saw himself as a leader rather than a restorer of kings.

==Downfall==
In January 1889, he ran as a deputy for Paris, and, after an intense campaign, took the seat with 244,000 votes against the 160,000 of his main adversary. A &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; seemed probable and desirable among his supporters. Boulanger had now become a threat to the parliamentary Republic. Had he immediately placed himself at the head of a revolt he might have effected the coup which many of his partisans had worked for, and might even have governed France; but the opportunity passed with his procrastination on 27 January. According to Lady Randolph Churchill &quot;[a]ll his thoughts were centered in and controlled by her who was the mainspring of his life. After the plebiscite...he rushed off to Madame Bonnemain&#x27;s house and could not be found&quot;.

Boulanger decided that it would be better to contest the general election and take power legally. This, however, gave his enemies the time they needed to strike back. Ernest Constans, the Minister of the Interior, decided to investigate the matter, and attacked the &quot;Ligue des Patriotes&quot; using the law banning the activities of secret societies.

Shortly afterward the French government issued a warrant for Boulanger&#x27;s arrest for conspiracy and treasonable activity. To the astonishment of his supporters, on 1 April he fled Paris before it could be executed, going first to Brussels and then to London. On 4 April the Parliament stripped him of his immunity from prosecution; the French Senate condemned him and his supporters, Rochefort, and Count Dillon for treason, sentencing all three to deportation and confinement.

In 1890 &quot;Le Figaro&quot; caused a sensation by alleging that Boulanger&#x27;s London promoter Alexander Meyrick Broadley had taken Boulanger and Rochefort to the male brothel at the centre of the Cleveland Street scandal, an allegation that Dillon was forced to publicly deny.

==Death==
After his flight, support for him dwindled, and the Boulangists were defeated in the general elections of July 1889 (after the government forbade Boulanger from running). Boulanger himself went to live in Jersey before returning to the Ixelles Cemetery in Brussels in September 1891 to kill himself with a bullet to the head on the grave of his mistress, Madame de Bonnemains (née Marguerite Brouzet) who had died in his arms the preceding July. He was buried in the same grave.

==Boulangist movement==
Some historians viewed the Boulangist movement as a proto-fascist right-wing movement. A number of scholars have presented Boulangism as a precursor of fascism, including Zeev Sternhell.

France&#x27;s traditional right was based in followers of the Catholic Church in France and customarily led by members of the French nobility whose ancestors had survived the Reign of Terror, but Boulanger&#x27;s new movement was based on mass populist following that was national, rather than merely religious or class-based. As Jacques Néré says, &quot;Boulangism was first and foremost a popular movement of the extreme left&quot;. Irvine says he had some royalist support but that, &quot;Boulangism is better understood as the coalescence of the fragmented forces of the Left.&quot; This interpretation is part of a consensus that the ideology of France&#x27;s radical right was formed in part during the Dreyfus era by men, ironically, who had been Boulangist partisans of the Far Left a decade earlier.

For example, Boulanger had the support of a number of former Communards from the Paris Commune and some supporters of Blanquism (a faction within the Central Revolutionary Committee). This included men such as Victor Jaclard, Ernest Granger and Henri Rochefort.

Général Boulanger inspired the 1956 Jean Renoir movie &quot;Elena and Her Men&quot;, a musical fantasy loosely based on the end of his political career. The role of Général François Rollan, a Boulanger-like character, was played by Jean Marais.

IMDb notes that there was also a French television programme about Boulanger in the early 1980s, &quot;La Nuit du général Boulanger&quot;, in which Boulanger is played by Maurice Ronet.

He is quoted as the one who authorised the institution of the &quot;Suicide Bureau&quot; in Guy de Maupassant&#x27;s short story &quot;The Magic Couch&quot;, reportedly &quot;the only good thing he did&quot;.

Maurice Leblanc also mentions him in his 1924 novel &quot;The Countess of Cagliostro&quot;.

<text>Earl of Dalhousie (), in the County of Midlothian, is a title in the Peerage of Scotland, held by the Chief of Clan Ramsay.

==History==
The family descends from Sir George Ramsay, who represented Kincardineshire in the Scottish Parliament in 1617. He received a charter of the barony of Dalhousie and also of the barony of Melrose on the resignation of John Ramsay, 1st Earl of Holderness. In 1618 he was raised to the Peerage of Scotland as Lord Ramsay of Melrose. However, as he did not like the title, he obtained a letter from James VI in 1619 to change it to Lord Ramsay of Dalhousie (with the precedence of 1618). He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Lord. He sat as a member of the Scottish Parliament for Montrose in 1617 and 1621 and served as Sheriff Principal of Edinburghshire. In 1633 he was created Lord Ramsay of Keringtoun and Earl of Dalhousie, in the County of Midlothian, in the Peerage of Scotland. His grandson, the third Earl (who succeeded his father in 1674), fought at the Battle of Bothwell Brig in 1679. His eldest son, the fourth Earl, was killed in a duel with a Mr Hamilton. He was unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He was a colonel in the Scots Guards and brigadier-general in the British Army and fought in the War of the Spanish Succession.

He was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, the sixth Earl. He was the son of Captain the Hon. John Ramsay, second son of the first Earl. Lord Dalhousie&#x27;s eldest son of George Ramsay, Lord Ramsay (died 1739), married Jean, daughter of the Hon. Harry Maule of Kelly, younger son of George Maule, 2nd Earl of Panmure, brother of James Maule, 4th Earl of Panmure, who took part in the Jacobite Rebellion of 1715 and was attainted in 1716 with his titles forfeited (see Earl of Panmure). Dalhousie was succeeded by his grandson, the seventh Earl. He was the eldest son of Lord Ramsay. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. He sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1774 to 1787. His second son the Hon. William Ramsay succeeded to the Maule estates in 1784 and was created Baron Panmure in 1831. Lord Dalhousie was succeeded by his eldest son, the ninth Earl. He was a distinguished soldier and served as Governor General of British North America (and previously Governor of Nova Scotia where he founded Dalhousie University) and as Commander-in-Chief of India. In 1815 he was created Baron Dalhousie, of Dalhousie Castle in the County of Edinburgh, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which entitled him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords.

He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, the tenth Earl. He was an influential Tory politician and also served as Governor-General of India from 1847 to 1856. In 1849 he was created Marquess of Dalhousie, of Dalhousie Castle in the County of Edinburgh and of the Punjab, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Dalhousie assumed the additional surname of Broun of Colstoun upon succeeding to the Colstoun estates. He had no male issue and on his death in 1860 the marquessate and barony of 1815 became extinct. He was succeeded in the Scottish titles by his first cousin Fox Maule, 2nd Baron Panmure, the eleventh Earl (see Baron Panmure for earlier history of this branch of the family). He was a prominent Liberal politician and notably held office as Secretary of State for War. On succeeding to the earldom in 1860 he assumed the surname and arms of Ramsay of Dalhousie after that of Maule. Lord Dalhousie was childless and on his death in 1874 the barony of Panmure became extinct. He was succeeded in the Scottish titles by his first cousin, the twelfth Earl, who was the second son of the Hon. John Ramsay, fourth son of the eighth Earl. Lord Dalhousie was an admiral in the Royal Navy. In 1875, he was created Baron Ramsay, of Glenmark in the County of Forfar, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which entitled him to a seat in the House of Lords.
He was succeeded by his eldest son, the thirteenth Earl. He was a Liberal politician and served under William Ewart Gladstone as Secretary of State for Scotland in 1886. His eldest son, the fourteenth Earl, was a captain in the Scots Guards and an honorary colonel in the North Scottish Royal Garrison Artillery (TA). He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fifteenth Earl. He was a Deputy Lieutenant of Angus. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixteenth Earl. He was a Conservative Member of Parliament before succeeding in the earldom and later served as Governor-General of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and was Chancellor of the University of Dundee. the titles are held by his eldest son, the seventeenth Earl, who succeeded in 1999. Lord Dalhousie is Chief of Clan Ramsay.

Several other members of the family have also gained distinction. The Hon. George Ramsay (died 1705), younger son of the second Earl, was a lieutenant-general in the Army and served as commander-in-chief of the forces in Scotland in 1702. The aforementioned the Hon. William Ramsay, second son of the eighth Earl, was created Baron Panmure in 1831. The aforementioned the Hon. John Ramsay (1775–1842), fourth son of the eighth Earl, was a lieutenant-general in the service of the General Staff of India. He was the father of 1) William Ramsay (1804–1871), a major-general in the Bengal Army; 2) the twelfth Earl (see above); 3) James Ramsay (1808–1868), a major-general in the Bengal Army; and 4) the Hon. Sir Henry Ramsay (1816–1893), a general in the Bengal Army, whose grandson was the politician Archibald Maule Ramsay. The Hon. Charles Ramsay, fourth son of the twelfth Earl, represented Forfar in the House of Commons from 1894 to 1895. The Hon. Sir Patrick Ramsay (1879–1962), second son of the thirteenth Earl, was a diplomat and served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Greece, Hungary and Denmark. The Hon. Sir Alexander Ramsay, third son of the thirteenth Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy and served as Fifth Sea Lord from 1938 to 1939. He was the husband of Princess Patricia of Connaught, youngest child of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught. Their son was Alexander Ramsay of Mar, husband of Flora Fraser, 21st Lady Saltoun.

The family seat is Brechin Castle near Brechin, Angus, which is currently put up for sale through the Savills real estate company. The other former seat, Dalhousie Castle, was sold in the late 20th century and is now a hotel. Until then it was said to be a property longer in one family than any other in Scotland.

<doc id="443838" wikidata="Q977300" url="?curid=443838" title="Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll">
<text>Archibald Campbell, Marquess of Argyll, 8th Earl of Argyll, Chief of Clan Campbell (March 160727 May 1661) was a Scottish nobleman, politician, and peer. The &quot;de facto&quot; head of Scotland&#x27;s government during most of the conflict of the 1640s and 1650s known as the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, he was the main leader of the Covenanter movement that fought for the Establishment of Presbyterianism in opposition to the preference of King Charles I and the Caroline Divines for instead Establishing both High Church Anglicanism and Bishops. He is often remembered as the principal antagonist to the Royalist general James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose.

==Early life==
Archibald Campbell, Marquess of Argyll, was the eldest son of Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll, by his first wife Agnes Douglas, daughter of William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton, and was educated at St Andrews University, where he matriculated on 15 January 1622. He had early in life, as Lord Lorne, been entrusted with the possession of the Argyll estates when his father renounced Protestantism and took arms for Philip III of Spain; and he exercised over Clan Campbell an authority almost absolute, disposing of a force of 20,000 retainers, being, according to Baillie, &quot;by far the most powerful subject in the kingdom&quot;.

Argyll was said to be of above average height, but slight in build. He had reddish hair, which darkened in later life – among the Highlanders he was often called &quot;red Argyll&quot; – and a pronounced squint. Contemporaries said he had a very charming and persuasive manner, although early in life he developed a habit of abruptly leaving the room if a conversation took a turn he did not like. Clarendon said that &quot;his wit was pregnant, and his humour gay and pleasant, except when he liked not the company or the argument&quot;.

==In the Covenanter movement==

On the outbreak of the religious dispute between the king and Scotland in 1637, Lord Lorne&#x27;s support was eagerly sought by Charles I. He was made a privy councillor in 1628. In 1638, the king summoned him, together with the earls of Traquair and Roxburgh, to London, but he refused to be won over, warned Charles against his despotic ecclesiastical policy, and showed great hostility towards William Laud. In consequence, a secret commission was given to the Randal MacDonnell, Earl of Antrim to invade Argyll and stir up the MacDonalds against the Campbells. Argyll, who inherited the title at the death of his father in 1638, originally had no preference for Presbyterianism, but now definitely took the side of the Covenanters in defence of national religion and liberties.
Argyll continued to attend the meetings of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland after its dissolution by the Marquess of Hamilton, when Episcopacy was abolished. In 1639, he sent a statement to Laud, and subsequently to the king, defending the General Assembly&#x27;s action.

During what became known as the First Bishops&#x27; War, Argyll raised a body of troops and seized Hamilton&#x27;s castle of Brodick in Arran. After the Pacification of Berwick, he carried a motion, in opposition to James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, by which the estates secured to themselves the election of the lords of the articles, who had formerly been nominated by the king. This was a fundamental change to the Scottish constitution, whereby the management of public affairs was entrusted to a representative body and withdrawn from the control of the crown.

An attempt by the king to deprive Argyll of his office as justiciary of Argyll failed, and on the prorogation of the parliament by Charles, in May 1640, Argyll moved that it should continue its sittings and that the government and safety of the kingdom should be secured by a committee of the estates, of which he was the guiding spirit. In June, as part of what became known as the Second Bishops&#x27; War, he was trusted with a Commission of fire and sword against the royalists in Atholl and Angus, which, after succeeding in entrapping John Murray, 1st Earl of Atholl, he carried out with completeness and cruelty.

It was on this occasion that the Bonnie Hoose o&#x27; Airlie was burned. By this time, the personal dislike and difference in opinion between Montrose and Argyll led to an open breach. The former arranged that on the occasion of Charles&#x27;s approaching visit to Scotland, Argyll would be accused of high treason in the parliament. The plot, however, was disclosed, and Montrose, among others, was imprisoned. Accordingly, when the king arrived, he found himself deprived of every remnant of influence and authority. It only remained for Charles to make a series of concessions. He transferred control over judicial and political appointments to the parliament, created Argyll a marquess in 1641, and returned home, having, in Clarendon&#x27;s words, made a perfect deed of gift of that kingdom. Meanwhile, there was an unsuccessful attempt to kidnap Argyll, Hamilton, and Lanark, known as The Incident. Argyll was mainly instrumental in this crisis in keeping the national party faithful to what was to him evidently the common cause, and in accomplishing the alliance with the Long Parliament in 1643.

==English and Scottish Civil Wars==
In January 1644, he accompanied the Scottish army into England as a member of the Committee of Both Kingdoms and in command of a troop of horse, but was soon compelled, in March, to return to suppress Royalists in the Scottish Civil War and to defend his own territories. He forced Huntly to retreat in April. In July, he advanced to abet the Irish troops now landed in Argyll, which were fighting in conjunction with Montrose, who had put himself at the head of the Royalist forces in Scotland. Neither general succeeded in obtaining an advantage over the other, or even in engaging in battle. Argyll then returned to Edinburgh, threw up his commission, and retired to Inveraray Castle. Montrose unexpectedly followed him in December, compelling him to flee to Roseneath, and devastating his territories. On 2 February 1645, while following Montrose northwards, Argyll was surprised by him at Inverlochy. He witnessed, from his barge on the lake to which he had retired after falling from his horse, a fearful slaughter of his troops, which included 1,500 of the Campbells. He arrived at Edinburgh on 12 February and was again present at Montrose&#x27;s further great victory on 15 August at Kilsyth, whence he escaped to Newcastle. Argyll was at last delivered from his formidable antagonist by Montrose&#x27;s final defeat at Philiphaugh on 12 September.

In 1646, he was sent to negotiate with the king at Newcastle after his surrender to the Scottish army, when he endeavoured to moderate the demands of the parliament and at the same time to persuade the king to accept them. On 7 July 1646, he was appointed a member of the Assembly of Divines.

Up to this point, Argyll&#x27;s statesmanship had been highly successful. The national liberties and religion of Scotland had been defended and guaranteed, and the power of the king in Scotland reduced to a mere shadow. In addition, these privileges had been still further secured by the alliance with the English opposition, and by the subsequent triumph of the Parliament and Presbyterianism in the neighbouring kingdom. The king himself was a prisoner in their midst. But Argyll&#x27;s influence could not survive the rupture of the alliance between the two nations on which his whole policy was founded. He opposed in vain the Engagement, concluded in December 1647, between Charles I and the Scots against the English Parliament. James, Duke of Hamilton commanded an Engager army that marched into England and was defeated by Cromwell at Preston the following August. Argyll, after a narrow escape from a surprise attack at the Battle of Stirling in September 1648, joined the Whiggamores, a body of Covenanters at Edinburgh; and, supported by John Campbell, 1st Earl of Loudoun and Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven, he established a new government, which welcomed Oliver Cromwell on his arrival there on 4 October 1648.

==War with the English Parliament and personal ruin==

This alliance, however, was at once destroyed by the execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649, which excited universal horror in Scotland. In the series of tangled incidents which followed, Argyll lost control of the national policy. He describes himself at this period as &quot;a distracted man ... in a distracted time&quot; whose &quot;remedies ... had the quite contrary operation&quot;.

Argyll supported the invitation from the Covenanters to Charles II to land in Scotland, and gazed upon the captured Montrose, bound on a cart to execution at Edinburgh. When Charles II came to Scotland, having signed the Covenant and repudiated Montrose, Argyll remained at the head of the administration. After the defeat of Dunbar, Charles retained his support by the promise of a dukedom and the Garter, and an attempt was made by Argyll to marry the king to his daughter, Lady Anne. On 1 January 1651, he placed the crown on Charles&#x27;s head at Scone. But his power had now passed to the Hamiltonian party.

Argyll strongly opposed, but was unable to prevent, the expedition into England. In the subsequent reduction of Scotland, after holding out in Inveraray Castle for nearly a year, he was at last surprised in August 1652 and submitted to the Commonwealth. His ruin was then complete. His policy had failed, his power had vanished. He was hopelessly in debt, and on terms of such violent hostility with his eldest son and heir Archibald as to be obliged to demand a garrison in his house for his protection.

==Later life and writings==

During his visit to Monck at Dalkeith in 1654 to complain of this, Argyll was subjected to much personal insult from his creditors, and on visiting London in September 1655 to obtain money due to him from the Scottish Parliament, he was arrested for debt, though soon liberated. In Richard Cromwell&#x27;s Parliament of 1659 Argyll sat as member for Aberdeenshire.

At the Restoration, Argyll presented himself at Whitehall, but was at once arrested by order of Charles II and placed in the Tower of London (1660), before being sent to Edinburgh to stand trial for high treason. He was acquitted of complicity in the death of Charles I, and his escape from the whole charge seemed imminent, but the arrival of a packet of letters written by Argyll to Monck showed conclusively his collaboration with Cromwell&#x27;s Protectorate of England, particularly in the violent suppression of Glencairn&#x27;s Royalist rising in 1652. He was found guilty and sentenced to death, his execution by beheading on the &#x27;Maiden&#x27; taking place on 27 May 1661, before the death warrant had even been signed by the king. He was attended in his final hours by Rev Archibald Hutchison of Tolbooth Parish (contained in St Giles Cathedral) which oversaw the Tolbooth prison.

His head was deliberately placed on the same spike upon the west end of the Tolbooth, as that of Montrose, who had previously been exposed there, and his body was buried at Kilmun Parish Church near the Holy Loch, where the head was also deposited in 1664. A monument was erected to his memory in High Kirk of St Giles in Edinburgh in 1895.

==Works==
While imprisoned in the Tower he wrote &quot;Instructions to a Son&quot; (1661). Some of his speeches, including the one delivered on the scaffold, were published and are printed in the &quot;Harleian Miscellany&quot;.

==Family==
Argyll married Lady Margaret Douglas, second daughter of William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton, with whom he had two sons, the elder of whom, Archibald, succeeded him as the 9th Earl, and four daughters.

<text>Monroe Curtis Beardsley ( ; December 10, 1915 – September 18, 1985) was an American philosopher of art.

==Biography==
Beardsley was born and raised in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and educated at Yale University (B.A. 1936, Ph.D. 1939), where he received the John Addison Porter Prize. He taught at a number of colleges and universities, including Mount Holyoke College and Yale University, but most of his career was spent at Swarthmore College (22 years) and Temple University (16 years). His wife and occasional coauthor, Elizabeth Lane Beardsley, was also a philosopher at Temple.

His work in aesthetics is best known for its championing of the instrumentalist theory of art and the concept of aesthetic experience. Beardsley was elected president of the American Society for Aesthetics in 1956. Among literary critics, Beardsley is known for two essays written with W.K. Wimsatt, &quot;The Intentional Fallacy&quot; and &quot;The Affective Fallacy,&quot; both key texts of New Criticism. His books include: &quot;Practical Logic&quot; (1950), &quot;Aesthetics&quot; (1958) (an introductory text), and &quot;Aesthetics: A Short History&quot; (1966). He also edited a well-regarded survey anthology of philosophy, &quot;The European Philosophers from Descartes to Nietzsche&quot;. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1976.

He and his wife were over-all series editors for Prentice-Hall&#x27;s &quot;Foundations of Philosophy,&quot; a series of textbooks on different fields within philosophy, written in most cases by leading scholars in those fields.

<doc id="443849" wikidata="Q5442531" url="?curid=443849" title="Fellowship of Fundamental Bible Churches">
<text>The Fellowship of Fundamental Bible Churches (FFBC) is a fellowship of independent, autonomous, fundament churches established in 1939. It is considered only a fellowship of like-minded churches, rather than a denomination. Local congregations in the fellowship have no financial obligations to the fellowship, and the fellowship exercises no control over them. It is only expected that the churches believe and teach Wesleyan theology, consistent with the Fundamentals of the Faith.

The church originated in a split from the Methodist Protestant Church, which was in merger talks with the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Shortly before almost all of the Methodist Protestant Church joined the two Methodist Episcopal bodies to form The Methodist Church, the Eastern Conference of the Methodist Protestant Church reorganized as the Bible Protestant Church. It took its current name in 1985.

Doctrinally, the FFBC professes to hold these distinctives: &quot;Biblically literal in our interpretation; dispensational (not covenantal) in our theology; premillennial and pretribulational in our eschatology; evangelistic and missions-oriented in our outreach; Biblically separated in personal life and ecclesiastical associations, and baptistic with regard to the mode and subjects of baptism.&quot; They also oppose the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements, holding that spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues were sign gifts that ceased to operate after the close of the New Testament canon.

Currently (2018), the FFBC comprises 18 churches spread out over New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan, and California. The fellowship operates the &quot;Tri-State Bible Camp &amp; Conference Center&quot; in Montague, New Jersey. Most churches in the fellowship are either &quot;Bible Churches&quot; or &quot;Baptist Churches&quot;. The &quot;Fellowship of Fundamental Bible Churches&quot; is a member of the American Council of Christian Churches.

The Fellowship of Fundamental Bible Churches is not to be confused with the International Fellowship of Bible Churches, another conservative Methodist association of churches with a similar name.

<doc id="443851" wikidata="Q7868745" url="?curid=443851" title="USS Darter (SS-227)">
<text>USS &quot;Darter&quot; (SS-227), a , was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the darter.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Darter&quot;′s keel was laid down on 20 October 1942 by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 6 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. E. B. Wheeler, wife of Edwin B. Wheeler, Shipbuilding Manager of Electric Boat, and commissioned on 7 September 1943.

==World War II==
&quot;Darter&quot; put out from New London, Connecticut on 31 October 1943 for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 26 November.

===First patrol===
On 21 December 1943, she cleared harbor on her first war patrol, bound for the heavily traveled shipping lanes south and west of Truk. This patrol was twice interrupted for repairs, at Pearl Harbor from 29 December 1943 – 3 January 1944, and at Tulagi and Milne Bay from 30 January–8 February. She performed a reconnaissance of Eniwetok on 12 January, and the next day scored a torpedo hit on a large ship, only to receive a severe depth-charging from her target&#x27;s escorts. She stood by on patrol during the carrier air strikes on Truk of 16–17 February, then fueled at Milne Bay on her way to refit at Brisbane from 29 February–17 March. She suffered her only casualty of the war during this refit when Motor Machinist&#x27;s Mate, Second Class Robert Richard Gould, Jr. was electrocuted.

===Second patrol===
On her way to her second war patrol north of Western New Guinea and south of Davao, &quot;Darter&quot; topped off fuel at Milne Bay on 21–22 March 1944. On 30 March, she sank a ship, then patrolled off New Guinea during Allied landings on its coast. She put into Darwin to refuel on 29–30 April, then returned to her patrol area until 23 May, when she arrived at Manus Island.

===Third patrol===
Refitted, she put out for action waters once more on 21 June on her third war patrol off Halmahera and Mindanao. She sank the IJN minelayer off Morotai on 29 June 1944, and again endured a heavy depth charge barrage as a result of her attack.

===Fourth patrol===
Returning to Brisbane on 8 August 1944, &quot;Darter&quot; cleared on her fourth and last war patrol. She searched the Celebes Sea and South China Sea, returned to Darwin to fuel and make minor repairs on 10 September, and put back to the Celebes Sea. She pulled into Mios Woendi on 27 September for additional fuel, and sailed on 1 October with to patrol the South China Sea in coordination with the forthcoming invasion of Leyte. She attacked a tanker convoy on 12 October, and on 21 October headed with &quot;Dace&quot; for Balabac Strait to watch for Japanese shipping moving to reinforce the Philippines or attack the landing forces.

In an outstanding performance of duty, which was to award both submarines the Navy Unit Commendation and &quot;Darter&quot;″s commanding officer, David Hayward McClintock, the Navy Cross, &quot;Darter&quot; and &quot;Dace&quot; made contact with the Japanese Center Force approaching Palawan Passage on 23 October. Immediately, &quot;Darter&quot; flashed the contact report, one of the most important of the war, since the location of this Japanese task force had been unknown for some days. The two submarines closed the task force, and with attacks on the cruisers of Center Force, initiated the attacks in the Palawan Passage, the first action of the decisive Battle for Leyte Gulf. &quot;Darter&quot; sank the heavy cruiser and seriously damaged the cruiser . With &quot;Dace&quot;, she tracked the damaged cruiser through the tortuous channels of Palawan Passage until just after midnight of 24–25 October when &quot;Darter&quot; grounded on Bombay Shoal .

As efforts to get the submarine off the shoal began, the closed, unsuccessfully tried to tow her off the reef or to destroy her, but then sailed on. With the tide receding, all &quot;Dace&quot;″s and &quot;Darter&quot;″s efforts to get her off failed. All confidential papers and equipment were destroyed, and the entire crew taken off to &quot;Dace&quot;. When the demolition charges planted in &quot;Darter&quot; failed to destroy her, &quot;Dace&quot; fired torpedoes which exploded on the reef due to the shallow water. &quot;Dace&quot; did, however, score 21 hits with her  gun. was called in and fired 10 torpedoes at &quot;Darter&quot; with similar lack of success. Finally, arrived on 31 October and scored 55 hits with her guns. Her report states, &quot;It is doubtful that any equipment in DARTER at 1130 this date would be of any value to Japan – except as scrap. Estimated draft of DARTER – 4 feet.&quot; With the scuttling occurring late in the war, the Japanese made no further efforts to recover the wreck, and her hull remained remarkably intact as late as 1962.

&quot;Dace&quot; reached Fremantle safely with &quot;Darter&quot;″s men on 6 November. In order to retain their high &quot;esprit de corps&quot;, the entire &quot;Darter&quot; crew was ordered to take over , then being built at Manitowoc, Wisconsin.

==Postwar==
In January 1952 a salvage party from the US Navy arrived at the wreck to dispose of the six torpedoes left on board in the forward torpedo room. Charges were placed around the torpedoes, and the resulting detonation blew off the entire bow. As of 1998 her badly deteriorated remains protrude above the surface on the reef.

==Awards==
In addition to the Navy Unit Commendation, &quot;Darter&quot; received four battle stars earned during her four war patrols, the last three of which were designated as &quot;successful&quot;. She is credited with having sunk a total of 19429 tons of Japanese shipping.

<doc id="443852" wikidata="Q484799" url="?curid=443852" title="Marbella">
<text>Marbella ( , , ) is a city and municipality in southern Spain, belonging to the province of Málaga in the autonomous community of Andalusia. It is part of the Costa del Sol and is the headquarters of the Association of Municipalities of the region; it is also the head of the judicial district that bears its name.

Marbella is situated on the Mediterranean Sea, between Málaga and the Strait of Gibraltar, in the foothills of the Sierra Blanca. The municipality covers an area of crossed by highways on the coast, which are its main entrances.

In 2023, the population of the city was 156,295 inhabitants,&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.ine.es/en/wel/faq_en.htm#3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; making it the second most populous municipality in the province of Málaga and the seventh in Andalusia. It is one of the most important tourist cities of the Costa del Sol and throughout most of the year is an international tourist attraction, due mainly to its climate and tourist infrastructure. It is also one of the fastest-growing cities in both Andalusia and Spain.

The city also has a significant archaeological heritage, several museums and performance spaces, and a cultural calendar.

==Geography==
The Marbella municipality occupies a strip of land that extends along of coastline of the Penibético region, sheltered by the slopes of the coastal mountain range, which includes the Bermeja, Palmitera, Royal, White and Alpujata sub-ranges. Due to the proximity of the mountains to the coast, the city has a large gap between its north and south sides, thus providing views of the sea and mountain vistas from almost every part of the city. The coastline is heavily urbanised; most of the land not built up with golf courses has been developed with small residential areas. Marbella is bordered on the north by the municipalities of Istán and Ojén, on the northwest by Benahavís, on the west by Estepona and on the northeast by Mijas. The Mediterranean Sea lies to the south.

===Topography===

There are five geomorphological areas in Marbella—the Sierra Blanca, the Sierra Blanca piedmont (foothills), the lower hill country, the plains and the coastal dunes. The Sierra Blanca is the most centrally-located in the province, peaking behind the old village. The mountain range has three notable peaks—La Concha, located further west at above sea level, Juanar Cross, located eastward (within the municipality of Ojen) at above sea level, and the highest, Mount Lastonar, located between the two at . Marbella&#x27;s topography is characterised by extensive coastal plains formed from eroded mountains. North of the plain is an area of around above sea level, encompassing low, rolling hills, with higher foothills and steeper slopes approaching the mountains behind. The coast is generally low-lying, with sandy beaches that are more extensive further east, between the fishing port and . Despite the intense urbanisation of the coast, it still retains a natural area of dunes, the Artola Dunes (&quot;Dunas de Artola&quot;), at the eastern end of town.

===Hydrography===

The entire region lies within the Andalusian Mediterranean Basin. The rivers are short and have very steep banks, so that flash floods are common. These include the Guadalmina, the Guadaiza, the Verde and the Rio Real, which provide most of the water supply. The irregularity of rainfall has resulted in intermittent rivers that often run dry in summer; most of the many streams that cross the city have been bridged. The La Concepción reservoir supplies the population with drinking water—apart from this water feature, there are other reservoirs, like El Viejo and El Nuevo (the &#x27;Old&#x27; and the &#x27;New&#x27;), that irrigated the old agricultural colony of El Ángel. Additionally, Las Medranas and Llano de la Leche irrigated the plantations of the colony of San Pedro de Alcántara.

===Climate===
Marbella has a subtropical Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;) with humid, very mild winters (for European standards) and warm to hot, dry summers. Marbella is protected on its northern side by the coastal mountains of the Cordillera Penibética and so enjoys a climate with an average annual temperature between . During winters, the highest peaks of the nearby mountain range are occasionally covered with snow, which can be seen from the coastline of Marbella when it snows on the Sierra Blanca mountain peak at . Average rainfall is , while hours of sunshine average above 2,900 annually.

===Flora and fauna===

As most of the montane and wilderness areas around Marbella are under the management and protection of the central government, a great biodiversity is still thriving, with numerous endemic trees and plants, including chestnut and cherry trees, fir trees, Aleppo, Monterrey and maritime pines, pinyons, and ferns. The fauna is rich, with nearly 300 observed species of birds, including large raptors such as the lammergeier, cinereous (black), Egyptian, and Eurasian and Rüppell&#x27;s griffon vultures, osprey, booted, Bonelli&#x27;s and golden eagles, as well as buzzards, goshawks, harriers, kites, sparrowhawks and snake-eagles; owls include the Eurasian eagle-owl, little owl, long-eared owl and the tawny owl. Over 50 species of sea and shorebirds can be seen, in addition to some 20-30 species of ducks, swans, geese and other waterfowl. Greater and (occasionally) lesser flamingoes may be observed. Around 40 different mammals, including Iberian ibex, the rare Iberian lynx, badger, red deer, fallow deer, roe deer, genets, hedgehogs, marbled polecat, red fox, river otter, stone marten and wild boar, in addition to free-ranging (some feral) groups of goats, horses, donkeys, cattle, and sheep, as well as potentially destructive feral dogs and cats. Around 50 reptiles and amphibians, and nearly 100 fish species, both marine and freshwater, can be found.

The coast has the Natural Monument site of the Dunas de Artola, one of the few protected natural beaches of the Costa del Sol, which contains marram grass, sea holly, sea daffodils and shrubs, such as large-fruited juniper. The &quot;Posidonia oceanica&quot;, endemic to the Mediterranean, is found in the Cabopino area, and is an important part of the marine ecosystem around Marbella.

==Demographics==

According to the census of the INE for 2023, Marbella had a population of 156,295 inhabitants, which ranked it as the second-most populous city in the province of Málaga and eighth in Andalusia after surpassing Cádiz in 2008. Unlike other towns in the Costa del Sol, Marbella had a significant population before the population explosion caused by the tourist boom of the 1960s. The census counted about 10,000 people in 1950; population growth since has been as great as that of neighboring towns. Between 1950 and 2001 the population grew by 897%, with the decade of the 1960s having the highest relative increase, at 141%. In 2001, only 26.2% of Marbella&#x27;s population had been born there, 15.9% were foreign-born, and those born in other towns in Spain made up the difference. During the summer months the population of Marbella increases by 30% with the arrival of tourists and foreigners who have their second homes in the area.

The population is concentrated in two main centres: Marbella and San Pedro Alcántara; the rest is scattered in many developments in the districts of Nueva Andalucia and Las Chapas, located along the coast and on the mountain slopes. According to a study by the Association of Municipalities of the Costa del Sol, based on the production of solid waste in 2003, Marbella had a population of about 246,000 inhabitants, almost twice that of the population census of 2008. From the estimated volume of municipal waste in 2010, the City calculates the population during the summer months at around 400,000 people, while official police sources estimated it at about 500,000, with a peak of up to 700,000 people. 

===Demonyms===
Traditionally the people of Marbella have been called &quot;marbelleros&quot; in the local vernacular and &quot;marbellenses&quot; in more formal registers; these names have appeared in dictionaries and encyclopedias. Since the mid-1950s, however, Marbellan residents have been called &quot;marbellís&quot; or &quot;marbellíes&quot;, the only gentilic, or demonym, that appears in the &quot;Diccionario de la Lengua Española&quot; (Dictionary of the Spanish Language) published by the Royal Spanish Academy.

The use of &quot;marbellí&quot; as a gentilic was popularised by the writer and journalist Víctor de la Serna (1896–1958), who wrote a series of documentary articles on &quot;The Navy of Andalucía&quot;; in his research he had come upon the &quot;Historia de Málaga y Su Provincia&quot; (History of Málaga and the Province) by Francisco Guillén Robles, who used the plural word &quot;marbellíes&quot; to designate the Muslim inhabitants of Marbella.

==History==
===Prehistory and antiquity===

Archaeological excavations have been made in the mountains around Marbella which point to human habitation in Paleolithic and Neolithic times. Some historians believe that the first settlement on the present site of Marbella was founded by the Phoenicians in the 7th century BC, as they are known to have established several colonies on the coast of Málaga province. However, no remains have been found of any significant settlement, although some artefacts of Phoenician and later Carthaginian settlements have been unearthed in different parts of the municipality, as in the fields of Rio Real and Cerro Torrón.

The existence of a Roman population centre in what is now the &quot;El Casco Antiguo&quot; (Old Town) is suggested by three Ionic capitals embedded in one section of the &quot;Murallas del Castillo&quot; (Moorish castle walls), that reused materials of a building from earlier times. Recent discoveries in &quot;La Calle Escuelas&quot; (School Street) and other remains scattered throughout the old town testify to a Roman occupation as well. West of the city, on the grounds of the Hotel Puente Romano, is a small 1st century Roman Bridge over a stream. There are ruins of other Roman settlements along the rivers Verde and Guadalmina: Villa Romana on the &quot;Rio Verde&quot; (Green River), the Roman baths at Guadalmina, and the ruins of a Roman villa and an early Byzantine basilica at Vega del Mar, built in the 3rd century and surrounded by a paleo-Christian necropolis, later used as a burial ground by the Visigoths. All of these further demonstrate a continued human presence in the area. In Roman times, the city was called &quot;Salduba&quot; (Salt City).

===Middle Ages===
During the period of Islamic rule, after the Normans lay waste to the coast of Málaga in the 10th century, the Caliphate of Córdoba fortified the coastline and built a string of several lighthouse towers along it. In the Umayyad fashion they constructed a citadel, the Alcazaba, and a wall to protect the town, which was made up of narrow streets and small buildings with large patios, the most notable buildings being the citadel and the mosque. The village was surrounded by orchards; its most notable crops were figs and mulberry trees for silkworm cultivation. The current name most likely developed from the name the Arabs gave it: &quot;Marbal·la&quot; (مربلة), which may in turn derive, according to some linguistic investigations, from a previous Iberian place name. The traveller Ibn Battuta characterised it as &quot;a pretty little town in a fertile district.&quot; During the time of the first kingdoms of Taifa, &quot;Marbil-la&quot; was disputed by the Taifas of Algeciras and of Málaga, eventually falling into the orbit of Málaga, which in turn later became part of the Nasrid Kingdom. In 1283 the Marinid sultan Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd Al-Haqq launched a campaign against the Kingdom of Granada. Peace between the Marinid dynasty and the Nasrid dynasty was achieved with the signing of the Treaty of Marbella on 6 May 1286, by which all the Marinid possessions in Al-Andalus were restored to the Nasrid sultan.

===Early modern age===

On 11 June 1485, the town passed into the hands of the Crown of Castile without bloodshed. The Catholic Monarchs gave Marbella the title of city and capital of the region and made it a &quot;realengo&quot; (royal protectorate). The &quot;Plaza de los Naranjos&quot; was built along the lines of Castilian urban design about this time, as well as some of the historical buildings that surround it. The &quot;Fuerte de San Luis de Marbella&quot; (Fort of San Luis) was built in 1554 by Charles V. The main door faced north and was protected by a moat with a drawbridge. Today, the ruins of the fort house a museum, and on the grounds are the &quot;Iglesia del Santo Cristo de la Vera Cruz&quot; (Church of the Holy Christ of the True Cross) and &quot;Ermita del Calvario&quot; (Calvary Chapel). Sugar cane was introduced to Marbella in 1644, the cultivation of which spread on the Málaga province coast, resulting in the construction of numerous sugar mills, such as &quot;Trapiche del Prado de Marbella&quot;.

===19th century===

In 1828 Málaga businessman Manuel Agustín Heredia founded a company called &quot;La Concepción&quot; to mine the magnetite iron ores of the Sierra Blanca at nearby Ojén, due to the availability of charcoal made from the trees of the mountain slopes and water from the river Verde, as a ready supply of both was needed for the manufacture of iron. In 1832 the company built the first charcoal-fired blast furnace for non-military use in Spain; these iron-smelting operations ultimately produced up to 75% of the country&#x27;s cast iron. By 1860 competition from the coke-fired blast furnaces in northern Spain had made the plant uneconomical. In 1860 the 1st Marquess of Duero founded an agricultural colony for the unemployed iron workers, now the heart of San Pedro de Alcántara.

The simultaneous dismantling of the iron industry, based in the forges of &quot;El Angel&quot; and &quot;La Concepción&quot;, disrupted the local economy. Much of the population had to return to farming or fishing for a livelihood. The situation was compounded by the widespread crisis of traditional agriculture and by the epidemic of phylloxera blight in the vineyards, causing Marbella to suffer high unemployment, an increase in poverty, and the starvation of many day labourers.
The associated infrastructure built for the installation of the foundry of El Angel in 1871 by the British-owned Marbella Iron Ore Company temporarily relieved the situation, and even made the city a destination for immigrants, increasing its population. However, the company did not survive the worldwide economic crisis of 1893, and closed its doors in that year due to the difficulty of finding a market for the magnetite iron ore it mined.

In the late 19th century, Marbella was a village composed of three parts: the main districts, the Barrio Alto or San Francisco, and the Barrio Nuevo. There were three smaller nuclei arranged around the old ironworks and the farm-model of the colony of San Pedro Alcántara, as well as isolated dwellings in orchards and farms. The general population was divided between a small group of oligarchs and the working people, the middle class being practically non-existent.

===20th century===
In the early decades of the century the first hotels were built: El Comercial, which opened in 1918, and the Miramar, in 1926. During the Second Republic, Marbella experienced major social changes and contentious political parties mobilized.

As the Spanish Civil War began in the late 1930s, Marbella and Casare suffered more anticlerical violence than the rest of western Málaga province. The day after the failed uprising which led to the civil war, several religious buildings in Marbella were set on fire. Only the walls of the Church of St. Mary of the Incarnation and the Church of San Pedro Alcantara were left standing. With the aid of Fascist Italian troops, Nationalist forces seized Marbella during the first months of the war. It became a haven for prominent Nazis, including Léon Degrelle and Wolfgang Jugler, and Falangist personalities like José Antonio Girón de Velasco and José Banús.

After the Second World War, Marbella was a small jasmine-lined village with only 900 inhabitants. , Marquis of Ivanrey, moved to Marbella and popularised it among his rich and famous friends. In 1943, he acquired a country estate located between Marbella and San Pedro called &quot;El Rodeo&quot;, and later built a resort there called &quot;Venta y Albergues El Rodeo&quot;, beginning the development of tourism in Marbella.

Soriano&#x27;s nephew, Prince Alfonso of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, descendant of a high-ranking aristocratic family (his mother, María de la Piedad de Yturbe y Scholtz-Hersmendorff, was the Marquesa de Belvís de las Navas) acquired another estate, &quot;Finca Santa Margarita&quot;. In 1954, he opened the Marbella Club, an international resort aimed at movie stars, business executives and the nobility.

Both resorts came to be frequented by members of European aristocratic families with famous names: Bismarck, Rothschild, Thurn und Taxis, Metternich, de Mora y Aragon, de Salamanca or Thyssen-Bornemisza. This transformed Marbella into a destination for the international jet set. Trading on Prince Alfonso&#x27;s kinship to the royal courts of Europe, his hotel quickly proved popular with vacationing members of Europe&#x27;s social elites for its casual but discreet luxury. Jaime de Mora y Aragón, a Spanish &quot;&quot; and brother to Fabiola, Queen of the Belgians, as well as Adnan Khashoggi, were frequent visitors. Prince Alfonso&#x27;s first marriage was to Princess Ira von Fürstenberg, an Agnelli heiress. Princess Marie-Louise of Prussia (great-granddaughter of Kaiser Wilhelm II) and her husband Count Rudolf &quot;Rudi&quot; von Schönburg–Glauchau eventually worked closely with the new proprietors, the Shamoon family, who took over the Marbella Club Hotel from Prince Alfonso.
In 1966, Prince Alfonso hired a Beverly Hills architect and, with the assistance of the Banus family, who were personal friends of dictator Francisco Franco and had already developed the later-controversial Valle de los Caídos, developed the high-end tourist resort Puerto Banus. The resort opened to much fanfare in 1970. Celebrities in attendance included Franco&#x27;s designated successor, Juan Carlos (then Prince of Asturias), Prince Rainier of Monaco and his wife Grace Kelly, and Aga Khan IV; entertainers included Julio Iglesias. In 1973, exiled dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zaldívar, who had left Cuba with a fortune estimated at between $100 and $300 million and lived extravagantly in various Iberian resorts, died of a heart attack there. Fugitive financier Marc Rich bought a house in Marbella, renounced his American citizenship and claimed Spanish citizenship during his decades of evading American income taxes, although he spent more time in Switzerland, where he died.

In 1974, Prince Fahd arrived in Marbella from Monte Carlo. Until his death in 2005, Prince Fahd was a frequent and profligate guest. Marbella welcomed his retinue of over a thousand people spending petro-dollars. The then-anonymous Osama bin Laden visited on a number of occasions with his family between 1977 and 1988.
In the 1980s, Marbella continued as a popular jet set destination. However, the 1987 kidnapping of Melodie Nakachian, the daughter of local billionaire philanthropist Raymond Nakachian and the Korean singer Kimera, focused less-favourable international media scrutiny on Marbella, even though a police raid ultimately freed her.

From the first democratic elections after the adoption of the 1978 Spanish Constitution, until 1991, all the mayors of Marbella were members of the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (&#x27;El Partido Socialista Obrero Español&#x27; or PSOE in Spanish).

In 1991, the builder and president of Atlético Madrid, Jesús Gil was elected mayor of Marbella by a wide majority. He and his party, the right-wing populist Independent Liberal Group (&#x27;Grupo Independiente Liberal&#x27; or GIL in Spanish), promised to fight petty crime as well as the region&#x27;s declining prestige. Actor Sean Connery became Marbella&#x27;s international spokesman, although Connery later ended this business relationship after Gil used his image in an election campaign. Gil&#x27;s administration facilitated a building boom. However, critics complained about disregard for the existing urban plan, market speculation and environmental predation by developers; the regional Andalusian government suspended some development. Gil despised town-hall formalities, instead ruling from his office at the Club Financiero, and cultivated a maverick image. The PSOE and the People&#x27;s Party criticized Gil even at the national level, but voters re-elected him and some Spanish celebrities continued to spend summers there. Gil&#x27;s political party, GIL, also proved popular in other tourist-dependent Costa del Sol towns like Estepona, and even across the Strait of Gibraltar to the Spanish North African cities of Ceuta and Melilla.

In 1999, Gil was convicted of embezzling public funds and falsifying public documents. Gil died in 2004, and his party remained in power until 2006, but related scandals continue to this day, as discussed below.

==Landmarks and places of interest==
===Old Town (Casco Antiguo)===
The old town of Marbella includes the ancient city walls and the two historical suburbs of the city, the &quot;Barrio Alto&quot;, which extends north, and the &quot;Barrio Nuevo&quot;, located to the east. The ancient walled city retains nearly the same layout as in the 16th century. Here is the &quot;Plaza de los Naranjos&quot;, an example of Castilian Renaissance design, its plan laid out in the heart of Old Town after the Christian reconquest. Around the square are arranged three remarkable buildings: the town hall, built in 1568 by the Catholic Monarchs in Renaissance style, the Mayor&#x27;s house, which combines Gothic and Renaissance elements in its façade, with a roof of Mudejar style and fresco murals inside, and the Chapel of Santiago, the oldest religious building in the city, built earlier than the square and not aligned with it, believed to date from the 15th century. Other buildings of interest in the centre are the Church of Santa María de la Encarnación, built in the Baroque style starting in 1618, the &quot;Casa del Roque&quot;, and the remains of the Arabic castle and defensive walls; also in the Renaissance style are the &quot;Capilla de San Juan de Dios&quot; (Chapel of St. John of God), the &quot;Hospital Real de la Misericordia&quot; (Royal Hospital of Mercy) and the &quot;Hospital Bazán&quot; which now houses the Museum of Contemporary Spanish Engravings.
One of the highlights of the Barrio Alto is the &quot;Ermita del Santo Cristo de la Vera Cruz&quot; (Hermitage of the Holy Christ of the True Cross), built in the 15th century and enlarged in the 18th century, which consists of a square tower with a roof covered by glazed ceramic tiles. The &quot;Barrio Alto&quot; is also known as the San Francisco neighborhood, after a Franciscan convent formerly located there. The so-called &quot;Nuevo Barrio&quot; (New Town), separated from the walled city by the &quot;Arroyo de la Represa&quot;, has no monumental buildings but retains its original layout and much of its character in the simple whitewashed houses with their tiled roofs and exposed wooden beams, orchards and small corrals.

===Historic extension (Ensanche histórico)===

Between the old town and the sea in the area known as the &quot;historic extension&quot; (&quot;ensanche histórico&quot;), there is a small botanical garden on Paseo de la Alameda, and a garden with fountains and a collection of ten sculptures by Salvador Dalí on the Avenida del Mar, which connects the old town with the beach. To the west of this road, passing the Faro de Marbella, is Constitution Park (&quot;Parque de la Constitución&quot;), which houses the auditorium of the same name and the Skol Apartments, designed in the Modernist style by the Spanish architect Manuel Jaén Albaitero.

===Marbella&#x27;s Golden Mile===
What is known as Marbella&#x27;s Golden Mile is actually a stretch of which begins at the western edge of Marbella city and stretches to Puerto Banús. The area is home to some of Marbella&#x27;s most luxurious villas and estates with views of mountain and sea, such as the Palace of King Fahd, as well as some landmark hotels, among them the Melia Don Pepe, the Hotel Marbella Club and the Hotel Puente Romano. The area developed during the tourism boom of the 1960s, where may be found the ruins of the Roman villa by the Rio Verde, and El Ángel, where the land of the old forge works was converted to an agricultural colony, and the Botanical Gardens of El Ángel with gardens of three different styles, dating from the 8th century.

The Golden Mile is divided into two parts by a motorway that runs through it. Along the motorway are strings of business centres, five-star hotels, golf course and other services. The beachside of the motorway is fully developed, while the mountain side is still undergoing development. Urbanisations in the area&#x27;s sea side are Alhambra del Mar, La Alcazaba, Las Torres, Los Verdiales, Marbellamar, Marina Marbella, Oasis, Rio Verde and Santa Margarita. On the mountainside of the motorway, the following residential areas are currently being developed: Sierra Blanca, Nagüeles, Cascada de Camoján, Jardines Colgantes, Marbella Hill Club, El Venero, El Batatal, La Capellania, La Virginia, Carolina, El Vicario, Altos de Salamanca, Casas del Señorio de Marbella, Coto Real, and Ancon Sierra.

The Golden Mile should not be confused with the New Golden Mile which is a marketing name given to the area between San Pedro de Alcantara and Estepona.

===Nueva Andalucía===
Nueva Andalucía is an area just west of Marbella and inland from the marina of Puerto Banús. Home to many golf courses, it is also known as Golf Valley. The bullring by Centro Plaza marks the entrance to Nueva Andalucia where the villas and apartments are based on traditional Andalusian architecture and design. Nueva Andalucia is a very popular residential area both due to its three golf courses, but also due to an increasing number of restaurants and entertainment venues. The three golf courses in Nueva Andalucia are Los Naranjos Golf Club, Las Brisas Golf Club and Aloha Golf.

===San Pedro Alcántara===
At the heart of San Pedro Alcántara are two industrial buildings of the 19th century: the &quot;Trapiche de Guadaiza&quot; and the sugar mill, which now houses the Ingenio Cultural Centre. The 19th century heritage of San Pedro is also represented by two buildings of colonial style, the parish Church and the Villa of San Luis, residence of the Marqués del Duero. Next to San Pedro, near the mouth of the river Guadalmina, are some of the most important archaeological sites in Marbella: the early Christian &quot;Basílica de Vega del Mar&quot;, the vaulted Roman baths of Las Bóvedas (the Domes) and the eponymous watch tower of &quot;Torre de Las Bóvedas&quot;. The important archaeological site of Cerro Colorado is located near Benahavis; it features a chronologically complex stratigraphy that begins in the 4th century BC within a Mastieno (ancient Iberian ethnicity of the Tartessian confederation) area, then a town identified as Punic, and finally a Roman settlement. A series of domestic structures built behind the city walls, and corresponding to these different stages of occupation recorded in the archaeological sequence of the site, characterise the settlement as being fortified. A hoard of three pots filled with silver coins of mostly Hispano-Carthaginian origin, and numerous pieces of precious metalwork, along with clippings and silver ingots, all dating from the 3rd century BC, were found here.

===District of Las Chapas===
In the eastern part of the municipality in the district of Las Chapas is the site of &quot;Rio Real&quot;, situated on a promontory near the mouth of the river of the same name. Here traces of Phoenician habitation dating to the early 7th century BC were discovered in excavations made during an archaeological expedition led by Pedro Sánchez in 1998. Bronze Age utensils including plates, carinated bowls, lamps and other ceramics of Phoenician and indigenous Iberian types have been found, as well as a few Greek examples. There are two ancient watchtowers, the &quot;Torre Río Real&quot; (Royal River Tower) and the &quot;Torre Ladrones&quot; (Tower of Thieves). Among the notable tourist attractions is the residential complex &quot;Ciudad Residencial Tiempo Libre&quot; (Residential Leisure City), an architectural ensemble of the Modernist movement, which has been a registered property of &quot;Bien de Interés Cultural&quot; (Heritage of Cultural Interest) since 2006.

===Beaches===

The of coastline within the limits of Marbella is divided into twenty-four beaches with different features; however, due to expansion of the municipality, they are all now semi-urban. They generally have moderate surf, golden or dark sand ranging through fine, medium or coarse in texture, and some gravel. The occupancy rate is usually high to midrange, especially during the summer months, when tourist arrivals are highest. Amongst the various notable beaches are Artola beach, situated in the protected area of the Dunas de Artola, and Cabopino, one of the few nudist beaches in Marbella, near the port of Cabopino. The beaches of Venus and La Fontanilla are centrally located and very popular, and those of Puerto Banús and San Pedro Alcántara have been awarded the blue flag of the Foundation for Environmental Education for compliance with its standards of water quality, safety, general services and environmental management.

==Politics and administration==
Political administration of the municipal government is run by the Ayuntamiento (City Hall), whose members are elected every four years. Maria Angeles Muñoz, leader of the People&#x27;s Party (PP) in Marbella, became mayor in 2007, and her party has governed the town ever since. The electoral roll is composed of all residents registered in Marbella who are over age 18 and a citizen of Spain or one of the other member states of the European Union. The Spanish Law on the General Election sets the number of councilors elected according to the municipality&#x27;s population; the Municipal Corporation of Marbella consists of 27 councilors.

===Gil Cases===
Corruption accusations and mayor Gil&#x27;s further conviction in 2002 for diverting public funds to Atlético led to reappraisal of the city&#x27;s finances. When Jesús Gil y Gil finally resigned that year, he was succeeded by Julián Muñoz, his right-hand man, a former waiter famous for his romantic involvement with singer Isabel Pantoja, a matador&#x27;s widow. After a power struggle in which Muñoz fired Juan Antonio Roca Nicolas, a planning consultant, for involvement in the Gil-era scandal and in the later scandal discussed below, the city council censured the new mayor and expelled him from office. More than 79 companies and 85 individuals were implicated in the initial corruption scandal (for which Roca had been released from prison upon paying a 450,000 euro fine), and an additional fifty persons and more companies were convicted in June 2013. In a televised debate, Muñoz and Gil each accused the other of having robbed public funds.

After his own party repudiated Muñoz, Marisol Yagüe, a former secretary, became Marbella&#x27;s new mayor, but was herself arrested and jailed in March 2006. Deputy Mayor Isabel Garcia Marcos was arrested at Malaga&#x27;s airport en route to a honeymoon in Russia at this time, and police found over €360,000 in cash in a safe in her home. Garcia, a Socialist until her expulsion from that party in 2003, had been known for criticizing Marbella&#x27;s endemic corruption. Gil died in 2004, a year after Spain&#x27;s Supreme Court barred him from holding further public office for 28 years for breach of trust and influence-peddling in the earlier cases, as well as shortly after a lower court ordered him to surrender his Atlético shares and fined him $16 million in connection with the 2002 conviction (but allowed him to remain free on bail during his appeal).

===Operation Malaya===

In March 2006, Marbella seemed nearly bankrupt. City councilor Tomás Reñones, a former Atlético Madrid football player, ran Marbella after Mayor Yague and Deputy Mayor Garcia were jailed, but soon ended up in jail as well. On 8 April 2006, the Spanish Senate unanimously approved the report of the General Commission of Autonomous Communities and suspended the city council, the first time such a course of action had occurred in Spain since democracy&#x27;s restoration. Spain&#x27;s Prime Minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, head of the national PSOE, appointed a committee of auditors to run Marbella temporarily, as well as unravel the financial machinations.

After a short period of interim government, municipal elections were held in May 2007. For the first time, the People&#x27;s Party (PP) gained a majority, with 16 out of the 27 council seats. The PSOE won 10 council seats, United Left (IU) had 1. In the municipal elections of May 2011, the PP won 15 seats, the PSOE 7, the IU 2, and independents 3.
The investigation, known as the Operation Malaya case, has resulted in numerous convictions and the seizure of goods worth €2.4 million. Today &quot;Marbellan urbanism&quot; is synonymous in Spain with governmental corruption, with as many as 30,000 illegal homes built in the town, without significant educational and health infrastructure.

During the complex, three-year trial (which included over 300 hours of hearings and 400 witnesses), evidence showed that under a scheme masterminded by Roca (a formerly unemployed builder who ran the city&#x27;s planning department in the 1990s), building permits were issued in exchange for envelopes of cash, and the money then illegally laundered. Although prosecutors had sought even stiffer terms after convicting 50 municipal officials and business executives, in October 2013, Roca was sentenced to 11 years in jail and fined €240m, former mayor Muñoz sentenced to six years, and former mayor Yagüe sentenced to serve two years in prison. Forty of the 95 accused were found not guilty by the Malaga court.

The corruption investigation that led to this round of convictions began in 2005, as an investigation into drug moneylaundering. Roca reportedly claimed to control the town after Gil&#x27;s death. At the height of his wealth he was one of the richest men in Andalucia, having accumulated several hotels, ranches with more than 103 thoroughbred horses and fighting bulls, a private jet, a helicopter, 14 vintage cars, 5 kilos of jewellery and a 275 piece art collection including Miro paintings. However, although Marbella&#x27;s population had boomed to approximately 160,000 residents during the previous fifteen years, neither additional schools nor health centres were built; the city&#x27;s infrastructure remained virtually unchanged since 1991. Although the city expanded its workforce from 400 employees in 1991 to 3,200 in 2006, under the GIL administrations Marbella paid neither social security contributions nor taxes for its employees. The town&#x27;s debt now exceeds over €200 million and precludes necessary infrastructure improvements. Hundreds of the poorly built apartments and homes, many sold to expatriate British and Irish retirees, face demolition as hazardous. Investigating magistrate Miguel Angel Torres Segura, who led the investigations through 2007, was promoted to the criminal court in Granada.

===Symbols===
The design of the coat of arms and the flag used by Marbella City Hall has been the subject of controversy.

==Economy==
According to 2003 data, Marbella is amongst the municipalities ranking highest in household disposable income per capita in Andalusia, second to Mojácar and matched by four other municipalities, including its neighbour, Benahavís.

Its business sector consisted of 17,647 establishments in 2005, representing a total of 14.7% of the businesses in Malaga province, and showed greater dynamism than the provincial capital itself for growth over the period 1998–2004, when it grew 9% compared to the 2.4% growth rate of Málaga. Compared to the rest of Andalusia, the volume of production in Marbella is higher than that of most other municipalities with similar population, ranking even above the capitals of Almería, Huelva and Jaén.
As in most cities of the Andalusian coast, Marbella&#x27;s economy revolves around tertiary activities. The service sector accounts for 60% of employment, while trade accounts for almost 20%. The main branches of the service sector are hospitality, real estate, and business services, which underscores the importance of tourism in Marbella&#x27;s economy. Employment in construction, industry, and agriculture is 14.2%, 3.8%, and 2.4% respectively.

The number of business establishments in the service sector accounts for 87.5% of the total. Businesses in construction account for 9.6% and, in industry, 2.9%. Of these companies, 89.5% have fewer than 5 employees and only 2.3% have a staff of at least 20 employees.

In 2008, a study by the Institute of Statistics of Andalusia (IEA) based on 14 variables (income, equipment, training, etc.), found Marbella was the Andalusian city with the most developed general welfare and the highest quality of life. According to the study&#x27;s results, Marbella ranks highest in the number of private clinics, sports facilities, and private schools.

In December 2016, an investment fund based in Hong Kong announced that it had acquired of land near Elviria and planned to invest €300 million to develop a five-star luxury hotel and 120 villas. According to its developer, the future resort &quot;is to be the most luxurious in the country&quot; and will be run by an international hotel chain.

==Transport==
Cities on the coast are accessible by bus from Marbella, including Málaga, Estepona, Torremolinos, Fuengirola and Gibraltar. The area is also served by the A7 motorway; the closest airport is Málaga-Costa Del Sol.

===Marine shipping===
The four ports of Marbella are primarily recreational; although both Puerto Banús and the Puerto de la Bajadilla are permitted to dock cruise ships, neither operates regular service to other ports. The port of Bajadilla is home to the Marbella fishermen&#x27;s guild and is used to transport goods.

===Rail===
Marbella is the most populous municipality in the Iberian Peninsula without a railway station in its territory, and is the only Spanish city of over 100,000 inhabitants not served by rail.

A project is underway to construct a railway (Costa del Sol railway) to connect Nerja, Málaga, and Algeciras. It may be a high speed railway with several stops in Marbella. Until then, the nearest station is near Fuengirola, distant. Further away is Málaga Maria Zambrano, in Málaga city, away, and Ronda railway station, also .

=== Urban bus ===
Marbella offers residents of the municipality free mobility on its urban bus lines (Urbanos de Marbella) operated by Avanza, thanks to the Tarjeta Municipal de Movilidad. There are currently 14 urban bus lines, spanning from San Pedro de Alcántara to Cabopino, including the seasonal Starlite line available during summers and the L11 available only on October 31 and November 1.

The central bus station has connections to other domestic destinations, such as Madrid and Barcelona.

===Taxis===
There are plenty of taxis to Marbella from the airports at Malaga and Gibraltar and from the taxi ranks along the Costa del Sol. Most are clean and non-smoking, as well as being the most comfortable way to travel to local vacation destinations.

Marbella is not formally integrated into the Metropolitan Transportation Consortium Málaga area.

==Media==
Due to the city&#x27;s ethnic diversity, Marbella&#x27;s newspapers and magazines are published in several European languages, among which are &quot;La Tribuna de Marbella&quot; (in Spanish) and &quot;Costa del Sol Nachrichten&quot; (in German). In addition, &quot;Diario Sur&quot; (Spanish) or &quot;Southern Journal&quot; (English) and &quot;La Opinión de Málaga&quot; (Spanish) have editorial offices in the city.

===Cuisine===
The traditional cuisine of Marbella is that of the Malagueño coast and is based on seafood. The most typical dish is fried fish, using anchovies, mackerel, mullet or squid, amongst others. Gazpacho and garlic soup are very typical. Bakeries sell oil cakes, wine donuts, borrachuelos (aniseed rolls fried with a little wine and dipped into syrup), torrijas (similar to French toast) and churros (fritters). In addition to the traditional native cuisine, there are many restaurants in Marbella that serve food of the international, nouvelle, or fusion cuisines.

<text>Rh disease (also known as rhesus [[isoimmunization]], Rh (D) disease, or rhesus incompatibility, and blue baby disease) is a type of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). HDFN due to anti-D antibodies is the proper and currently used name for this disease as the Rh blood group system actually has more than 50 antigens and not only the D-antigen. The term &quot;Rh Disease&quot; is commonly used to refer to HDFN due to anti-D antibodies, and prior to the discovery of anti-Rho(D) immune globulin, it was the most common type of HDFN. The disease ranges from mild to severe, and occurs in the second or subsequent pregnancies of Rh-D negative women when the biologic father is Rh-D positive.

Due to several advances in modern medicine, HDFN due to anti-D is preventable by treating the mother during pregnancy and soon after delivery with an injection of anti-Rho(D) immune globulin (Rhoclone, Rhogam, AntiD). With successful mitigation of this disease by prevention through the use of anti-Rho(D) immune globulin, other antibodies are more commonly the cause of HDFN today.

== Mechanism == 
During pregnancy, there is normally a barrier between maternal and fetal blood called the placenta, a temporary organ that connects a mother’s uterus to the umbilical cord to provide nutrients and oxygen to the fetus. However, in certain circumstances, small amounts of fetal blood cells may enter the mother’s circulation. Certain types of events where this occurs are during childbirth, miscarriage or abortion, trauma, and invasive procedures such as amniocentesis. Once the fetal Rh-positive red blood cells enter the bloodstream of a Rh-negative mother, they are recognized as foreign. The mother’s immune system reacts to the Rh-positive red blood cells the same way that it would respond to something like a virus or bacteria, activating B cells — a type of white blood cell that is key to the triggering of an immune response. These activated B cells then differentiate into plasma cells, which produce anti-D antibodies. After the primary exposure, some of these B cells become memory cells, that remember the original exposure and produce IgG antibodies, which are smaller and can cross the placental barrier. Once they cross this barrier, they are into the fetal bloodstream, binding to fetal Rh-positive cells, triggering opsonization, which marks the red blood cells for destruction. The fetal spleen and liver then begin to break down those red blood cells, thinking that they are a foreign invader when in reality they are they are just mismatched.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of Rh disease include yellowish amniotic fluid and enlarged spleen, liver or heart or buildup of fluid in the abdomen of the fetus. 

== Pathophysiology ==
During the first pregnancy, the Rh- mother&#x27;s initial exposure to fetal Rh+ red blood cells (RBCs) is usually not sufficient to activate her Rh-recognizing B cells. However, during delivery, the placenta separates from the uterine wall, causing umbilical cord blood to enter the maternal circulation, which results in the mother&#x27;s proliferation of IgM-secreting plasma B cells to eliminate the fetal Rh+ cells from her blood stream. IgM antibodies do not cross the placental barrier, which is why no effects to the fetus are seen in first pregnancies for Rh-D mediated disease. However, in subsequent pregnancies with Rh+ fetuses, the IgG memory B cells mount an immune response when re-exposed, and these IgG anti-Rh(D) antibodies &quot;do&quot; cross the placenta and enter fetal circulation. These antibodies are directed against the Rhesus (Rh) factor, a protein found on the surface of the fetal RBCs. The antibody-coated RBCs are destroyed by IgG antibodies binding and activating complement pathways.

The resulting anemia has multiple sequelae:
# The immature haematopoietic system of the fetus is taxed as the liver and spleen attempt to put immature RBCs into circulation (erythroblasts, thus the previous name for this disease &quot;erythroblastosis fetalis&quot;).
# As the liver and spleen enlarge under this unexpected demand for RBCs, a condition called portal hypertension develops, and this taxes the immature heart and circulatory system.
# Liver enlargement and the prolonged need for RBC production results in decreased ability to make other proteins, such as albumin, and this decreases the plasma colloid osmotic pressure (the fluid-retaining ability of blood plasma) leading to leakage of fluid into tissues and body cavities, termed &quot;hydrops fetalis&quot;.
# The severe anemia taxes the heart to compensate by increasing output in an effort to deliver oxygen to the tissues and results in a condition called high output cardiac failure.
# If left untreated, the result may be fetal death.

The destruction of RBCs leads to elevated bilirubin levels (hyperbilirubinemia) as a byproduct. This is not generally a problem during pregnancy, as the maternal circulation can compensate. However, once the infant is delivered, the immature system is not able to handle this amount of bilirubin alone and jaundice or kernicterus (bilirubin deposition in the brain) can develop which may lead to brain damage or death. Sensitizing events during pregnancy include c-section, miscarriage, therapeutic abortion, amniocentesis, ectopic pregnancy, abdominal trauma and external cephalic version. However, in many cases there was no apparent sensitizing event. Approximately 50% of Rh-D positive infants with circulating anti-D are either unaffected or only mildly affected requiring no treatment at all and only monitoring. An additional 20% are severely affected and require transfusions while still in the uterus. This pattern is similar to other types of HDFN due to other commonly encountered antibodies (anti-c, anti-K, and Fy(a)).

== Diagnosis ==

=== Maternal blood ===

In the United States, it is a standard of care to test all expecting mothers for the presence or absence of the RhD protein on their RBCs. However, when medical care is unavailable or prenatal care not given for any other reason, the window to prevent the disease may be missed. In addition, there is more widespread use of molecular techniques to avoid missing women who appear to be Rh-D positive but are actually missing portions of the protein or have hybrid genes creating altered expression of the protein and still at risk of HDFN due to Anti-D.
* At the first prenatal visit, the mother is typed for ABO blood type and the presence or absence of RhD using a method sensitive enough to detect weaker versions of this antigen (known as weak-D) and a screen for antibodies is performed.
** If she is negative for RhD protein expression and has not formed anti-D already, she is a candidate for RhoGam prophylaxis to prevent alloimmunization.
** If she is positive for anti-D antibodies, the pregnancy will be followed with monthly titers (levels) of the antibody to determine if any further intervention is needed.
* A screening test to detect for the presence or absence of fetal cells can help determine if a quantitative test (Kleihauer-Betke or flow cytometry) is needed. This is done when exposure is suspected due to a potential sensitizing event (such as a car accident or miscarriage).
* If the screening test is positive or the appropriate dose of RhoGam needs to be determined, a quantitative test is performed to determine a more precise amount of fetal blood to which the mother has been exposed.
** The Kleihauer–Betke test or Flow Cytometry on a maternal blood sample are the most common ways to determine this, and the appropriate dose of RhoGam is calculated based on this information.
* There are also emerging tests using Cell-free DNA. Blood is taken from the mother, and using PCR, can detect fetal DNA. This blood test is non-invasive to the fetus and can help determine the risk of HDFN. Testing has proven very accurate and is routinely done in the UK at the International Blood Group Reference Laboratory in Bristol.

=== Paternal blood ===

Blood is generally drawn from the biological father to help determine fetal antigen status. If he is homozygous for the antigen, there is a 100% chance of all offspring in the pairing to be positive for the antigen and at risk for HDFN. If he is heterozygous, there is a 50% chance of offspring to be positive for the antigen.

== Prevention ==

The protection that is offered today against Rh incompatibility involved preventive measures that primarily utilize Rh immunoglobulin, also known as RhoGAM. The aim of these treatments are to prevent the mother’s immune system from becoming sensitized to the Rh antigen, which reduces the risk of hemolytic disease in future pregnancies. RhoGAM, Rh Immunoglobulin Administration, is a product that contains antibodies to the Rh D antigen, it is used to prevent the mother from developing an immune response to fetal red blood cells. RhIg ‘coats’ any Rh-positive fetal red blood cells that enter the mother’s bloodstream, effectively ‘hiding’ them from the mother’s immune system. RhoGAM is typically administered at around 28 weeks of pregnancy, then again within 72 hours after childbirth. It is also given during other events that happen during pregnancy like miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, amniocentesis, and abdominal trauma 

In Arar, Saudi Arabia, results of a study showed that women had a low level of knowledge regarding maternal-fetal blood incompatibility (about 38% of the studied mothers during the research, had knowledge about Rh incompatibility). Regarding their knowledge about anti-D, researchers found that; 68.5% of the mothers had knowledge about it, while only 51% of the mothers had knowledge about the administration of prophylactic anti D after delivery.

== Management ==
As medical management advances in this field, it is important that these patients be followed by high risk obstetricians/maternal-fetal medicine, and skilled neonatologists postpartum to ensure the most up to date and appropriate standard of care

=== Antenatal ===
* Routine prenatal labs drawn at the beginning of every pregnancy include a blood type and an antibody screen. Mothers who are Rh negative (A−, B−, AB−, or O− blood types) and have anti-D antibodies (found on the antibody screen) need to determine the fetus&#x27;s Rh antigen. If the fetus is also Rh negative (A−, B−, AB−, or O− blood types) then the pregnancy can be managed like any other pregnancy. The anti-D antibodies are only dangerous to Rh positive fetuses (A+, B+, AB+, or O+ blood types). 
**The fetal Rh can be screened using non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). This test can screen for the fetus&#x27;s Rh antigen (positive or negative) at the 10th week of gestation using a blood sample drawn from the mother. The Unity test uses NGS technology to look for Rh alleles (genes) in the cell free fetal DNA in the maternal bloodstream. In healthy pregnancies, at least 5% (fetal fraction) of the cell free DNA in the maternal bloodstream comes from the fetus (placenta cells shed DNA into the maternal bloodstream). This small fraction of cell free DNA from the fetus is enough to determine the fetus&#x27;s Rh antigen.
*Once a woman has been found to have made anti-D (or any clinically significant antibody against fetal red cells), she is followed as a high risk pregnancy with serial blood draws to determine the next steps
* Once the titer of anti-D reaches a certain threshold (normally 8 to 16), serial Ultrasound and Doppler examinations are performed to detect signs of fetal anemia
** Detection of increased blood flow velocities in the fetus are a surrogate marker for fetal anemia that may require more invasive intervention
* If the flow velocity is found to be elevated a determination of the severity of anemia needs to ensue to determine if an intrauterine transfusion is necessary
** This is normally done with a procedure called percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling (PUBS or cordocentesis) 
* Intrauterine blood transfusion
** Intraperitoneal transfusion—blood transfused into fetal abdomen
** Intravascular transfusion—blood transfused into fetal umbilical vein—This is the method of choice since the late 1980s, and more effective than intraperitoneal transfusion. A sample of fetal blood can be taken from the umbilical vein prior to the transfusion.
** Often, this is all done at the same PUBS procedure to avoid the needs for multiple invasive procedures with each transfusion

=== Postnatal ===
* Phototherapy for neonatal jaundice in mild disease
* Exchange transfusion if the neonate has moderate or severe disease
* Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) can be used to reduce the need for exchange transfusion and to shorten the length of phototherapy.

== History ==
In 1939 Drs. Philip Levine and Rufus E. Stetson published their findings about a 25-year-old mother who had a stillborn baby that died of hemolytic disease of the newborn. Both parents were blood group O, so the husband&#x27;s blood was used to give his wife a blood transfusion due to blood loss during delivery. However, she had a severe transfusion reaction. Since both parents were blood group O, which was believed to be compatible for transfusion, they concluded that there must be a previously undiscovered blood group antigen that was present on the husband&#x27;s red blood cells (RBCs) but not present on his wife&#x27;s. This suggested for the first time that a mother could make blood group antibodies because of immune sensitization to her fetus&#x27;s RBCs as her only previous exposure would be the earlier pregnancy. They did not name this blood group antigen at the time, which is why the discovery of the rhesus blood type is credited to Drs. Karl Landsteiner and Alexander S. Wiener with their first publication of their tables for blood-typing and cross-matching in 1940, which was the culmination of years of work. However, there were multiple participants in this scientific race and almost simultaneous publications on this topic. Levine published his theory that the disease known as erythroblastosis fetalis was due to Rh alloimmunization in 1941 while Landsteiner and Wiener published their method to type patients for an antibody causing transfusion reactions, known as “Rh&quot;.

The first treatment for Rh disease was an exchange transfusion invented by Wiener and later refined by Dr. Harry Wallerstein. Approximately 50,000 infants received this treatment. However, this could only treat the disease after it took root and did not do anything to prevent the disease. In 1960, Ronald Finn, in Liverpool, England proposed that the disease might be prevented by injecting the at-risk mother with an antibody against fetal red blood cells (anti-RhD). Nearly simultaneously, Dr. William Pollack, an immunologist and protein chemist at Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation, and Dr. John Gorman (blood bank director at Columbia-Presbyterian) with Dr. Vincent Freda (an obstetrician at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center), came to the same realization in New York City. The three of them set out to prove it by injecting a group of male prisoners at Sing Sing Correctional Facility with antibody provided by Ortho, obtained by a fractionation technique developed by Pollack.

Animal studies had previously been conducted by Dr. Pollack using a rabbit model of Rh. This model, named the rabbit HgA-F system, was an animal model of human Rh, and enabled Pollack&#x27;s team to gain experience in preventing hemolytic disease in rabbits by giving specific HgA antibody, as was later done with Rh-negative mothers. One of the needs was a dosing experiment that could be used to determine the level of circulating Rh-positive cells in an Rh-negative pregnant female derived from her Rh-positive fetus. This was first done in the rabbit system, but subsequent human tests at the University of Manitoba conducted under Dr. Pollack&#x27;s direction confirmed that anti-Rho(D) immune globulin could prevent alloimmunization during pregnancy.

Ms. Marianne Cummins was the first at risk woman to receive a prophylactic injection of anti-Rho(D) immune globulin (RHIG) after its regulatory approval. Clinical trials were set up in 42 centers in the US, Great Britain, Germany, Sweden, Italy, and Australia. RHIG was finally approved in England and the United States in 1968. The FDA approved the drug under the brand name RhoGAM, with a fixed dose of 300 μg, to be given within three days (72 hours) postpartum. Subsequently, a broader peripartum period was approved for dosing which included prophylaxis during pregnancy. Within a year, the antibody had been injected with great success into more than 500,000 women. Time magazine picked it as one of the top ten medical achievements of the 1960s. By 1973, it was estimated that in the US alone, over 50,000 babies&#x27; lives had been saved. The use of Rh immune globulin to prevent the disease in babies of Rh negative mothers has become standard practice, and the disease, which used to claim the lives of 10,000 babies each year in the US alone, has been virtually eradicated in the developed world. In 1980, Cyril Clarke, Ronald Finn, John G. Gorman, Vincent Freda, and William Pollack each received an Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research for their work on rhesus blood types and the prevention of Rh disease.

<text>William Kurtz Wimsatt Jr. (November 17, 1907 – December 17, 1975) was an American professor of English, literary theorist, and critic. Wimsatt is often associated with the concept of the intentional fallacy, which he developed with Monroe Beardsley in order to question the importance of an author&#x27;s intentions for the creation of a work of art.

== Life and career ==
Wimsatt was born in Washington D.C., attended Georgetown University and, later, Yale University, where he received his PhD In 1939, Wimsatt joined the English department at Yale, where he taught until his death in 1975. During his lifetime, Wimsatt became known for his studies of eighteenth-century literature (Leitch et al. 1372). He wrote many works of literary theory and criticism such as &quot;The Prose Style of Samuel Johnson&quot; (1941) and &quot;Philosophic Words: A Study of Style and Meaning in the &quot;Rambler&quot; and &quot;Dictionary&quot; of Samuel Johnson&quot; (1948; Leitch et al. 1372). His major works include &quot;The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry&quot; (1954); &quot;Hateful Contraries&quot; (1965) and &quot;Literary Criticism: A Short History&quot; (1957, with Cleanth Brooks). Wimsatt was considered crucial to New Criticism (particularly New Formalist Criticism; 1372). He was a member of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences.

== Influences ==
Wimsatt was influenced by Monroe Beardsley, with whom he wrote some of his most important pieces. Wimsatt also drew on the work of both ancient critics, such as Longinus and Aristotle, and some of his own contemporaries, such as T. S. Eliot and the writers of the Chicago School, to formulate his theories, often by highlighting key ideas in those authors&#x27; works in order to refute them.

== Influence ==

Wimsatt&#x27;s ideas have affected the development of reader-response criticism and his influence has been noted in the works of writers such as Stanley Fish. Wimsatt&#x27;s ideas have been disputed in works such as Walter Benn Michaels&#x27; and Steven Knapp’s “Against Theory” (Leitch et al. 1373-1374).

== Approach ==

Wimsatt was interviewed, along with Walter J. Ong of Saint Louis University, by Sheila Hough in 1964. (Professor Wimsatt had received an honorary doctorate from Saint Louis University in 1963.) Hough asked Professor Wimsatt a question that still resonates today: &quot;Is literature taught in complete isolation from its author, Mr. Wimsatt -- don&#x27;t you consider the person who wrote it?&quot;

Wimsatt replied: &quot;I do, of course. Your question, I think, was prompted by that very fine essay of Father Ong&#x27;s, &#x27;The Jinnee in the Well-Wrought Urn,&#x27; which you read in his book &quot;The Barbarian Within&quot; [1962: 15-25]. It first appeared in &quot;Essays in Criticism&quot; at Oxford some years ago [1954], and was in part, I believe, an answer to an essay written many years ago, about twenty at least, by a friend of mine, Monroe Beardsley, and myself, called &#x27;The Intentional Fallacy.&#x27; I would like to pay Father Ong the compliment of saying that I think that his essay &#x27;The Jinnee in the Well-Wrought Urn&#x27; is the only sensible response that has ever been written to that essay of ours.&quot;

As a staunch formalist critic, Wimsatt believed in the authority of the poem: any analysis of a poem must centre on the text itself (Leitch et al. 1371-1372). He outlines and advocates (particularly in his two influential essays written with Monroe Beardsley, “The Intentional Fallacy” and “The Affective Fallacy”) an “objective criticism” in which the critic essentially disregards the intentions of the poet and the effect of the poem on the audience as the sole (or even the major) factors in analyzing and evaluating a poem (Davis and Schleifer 43).

Wimsatt does allow for a certain degree of variation in the analysis of poetry and does not necessarily contend that there is only one possible reading for any given poem. He allows, for example, for what he calls the “literary sense” of meaning, saying that “no two different words or different phrases ever mean fully the same” (Verbal Icon xii).

Much of his theory, however, appears to stem from an ambivalence towards &quot;impressionism, subjectivism, and relativism” (Leitch et al. 1373) in criticism. In &quot;Hateful Contraries&quot;, Wimsatt refers to a “New Amateurism,” an “anti-criticism” emerging in works such as Leslie Fiedler’s “Credo,” which appeared in the &quot;Kenyon Review&quot;. “The only reservation the theorist need have about such critical impressionism or expressionism,” says Wimsatt, “is that, after all, it does not carry on very far in our cogitation about the nature and value of literature…it is not a very mature form of cognitive discourse” (&quot;Hateful Contraries&quot; xvi).

Indeed, Wimsatt is concerned with ensuring a level of legitimacy in English studies and he sets about doing so by favouring a scientific approach to criticism—even, for example, decrying affective theory as “less a scientific view of literature than a prerogative -- that of the soul adventuring among masterpieces” (&quot;Verbal Icon&quot; 29).

== Theories ==

Wimsatt contributed several theories to the critical landscape, particularly through his major work, &quot;The Verbal Icon&quot; (of which some of the ideas are discussed below). His ideas generally centre around the same questions tackled by many critics: what is poetry and how does one evaluate it?

=== Intentional fallacy ===
Perhaps Wimsatt’s most influential theories come from the essays “The Intentional Fallacy” and “The Affective Fallacy” (both are published in &quot;Verbal Icon&quot;) which he wrote with Monroe Beardsley. Each of these texts “codifies a crucial tenet of New Critical formalist orthodoxy,” making them both very important to twentieth-century criticism (Leitch et al. 1371).

The Intentional Fallacy, according to Wimsatt, derives from “confusion between the poem and its origins” (&quot;Verbal Icon&quot; 21) – essentially, it occurs when a critic puts too much emphasis on personal, biographical, or what he calls “external” information when analyzing a work (they note that this is essentially the same as the “Genetic fallacy” in philosophical studies; 21). Wimsatt and Beardsley consider this strategy a fallacy partly because it is impossible to determine the intention of the author — indeed, authors themselves are often unable to determine the “intention” of a poem — and partly because a poem, as an act that takes place between a poet and an audience, has an existence outside of both and thus its meaning can not be evaluated simply based on the intentions of or the effect on either the writer or the audience (see the section of this article entitled “The Affective Fallacy&quot; for a discussion of the latter; 5). For Wimsatt and Beardsley, intentional criticism becomes subjective criticism, and so ceases to be criticism at all. For them, critical inquiries are resolved through evidence in and of the text — not “by consulting the oracle” (18).

=== Affective fallacy ===
The Affective fallacy (identified in the essay of the same name, which Wimsatt co-authored with Monroe Beardsley, as above) refers to “confusion between the poem and its &quot;results&quot;” (&quot;Verbal Icon 21&quot;; italics in original). It refers to the error of placing too much emphasis on the effect that a poem has on its audience when analyzing it.

Wimsatt and Beardsley argue that the effect of poetic language alone is an unreliable way to analyze poetry because, they contend, words have no effect in and of themselves, independent of their meaning. It is impossible, then, for a poem to be “pure emotion” (38), which means that a poem’s meaning is not “equivalent to its effects, especially its emotional impact, on the reader” (Leitch et al. 1371).

As with the Intentional fallacy, engaging in affective criticism is too subjective an exercise to really warrant the label “criticism” at all — thus, for Wimsatt and Beardsley, it is a fallacy of analysis.

=== Concrete Universal ===

In “The Concrete Universal,” Wimsatt attempts to determine how specific or general (i.e., concrete or universal) a verbal representation must be in order to achieve a particular effect. What is the difference, for example, between referring to a “purple cow” and a “tan cow with a broken horn” (&quot;Verbal Icon&quot; 74)? In addressing such questions, Wimsatt attempts to resolve what it is that makes poetry different from other forms of communication, concluding that “what distinguishes poetry from scientific or logical discourse is a degree of concreteness which does not contribute anything to the argument but is somehow enjoyable or valuable for its own sake.” For Wimsatt, poetry is “the vehicle of a metaphor which one boards heedless of where it runs, whether cross-town or downtown — just for the ride” (76).

=== The Domain of Criticism ===

In “The Domain of Criticism,” Wimsatt “[defends] the domain of poetry and poetics from the encircling (if friendly) arm of the general aesthetician&quot; (&quot;Verbal Icon&quot; 221) – that is, he discusses the problems with discussing poetry in purely aesthetic terms. Wimsatt questions the ability of a poem to function aesthetically in the same way as a painting or sculpture. For one, visual modes such as sculpture or painting are undertaken using materials that directly correlate with the object they represent — at least in terms of their “beauty.” A beautiful painting of an apple, for example, is done with beautiful paint.

Verbal expression, however, does not function this way — as Wimsatt points out, there is no such thing as a “beautiful” or “ugly” word (or, at least, there is no general consensus as to how to apply such concepts in such a context; 228). There is no correlation between words and their subject, at least in terms of aesthetics — “the example of the dunghill (or equivalent object) beautifully described is one of the oldest in literary discussion” (228).

More importantly, language does not function merely on the level of its effects on the senses, as (for example) visual modes do. A poem does not just derive its meaning from its rhyme and meter, but these are the domains of aesthetics (231) — to analyse poetry on the basis of its aesthetics, then, is insufficient if one is to adequately explore its meaning.

== Major works ==

=== &quot;The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry&quot; ===

Written as a series of independent essays between 1941 and 1952, &quot;The Verbal Icon&quot; was finally published as a cohesive work (after Wimsatt revised some of the original versions) in 1954. Probably his most influential work, &quot;The Verbal Icon&quot; contains two of Wimsatt&#x27;s most important essays, “The Intentional Fallacy” and “The Affective Fallacy” (co-authored with Monroe Beardsley). Paul de Man offers a significant critique of Wimsatt&#x27;s text, taken as an example of the understanding of the notion of &#x27;autonomy&#x27; in New Criticism, in &quot;Blindness and Insight&quot;.

=== &quot;Hateful Contraries: Studies in Literature and Criticism&quot; ===

Apparently concerned with the (admittedly lessened) influence of what he calls “Amateur Criticism,” Wimsatt published &quot;Hateful Contraries&quot; in 1965 as a way to “distinguish what [he] consider[s] an inevitable and proper literary interest in the contraries” (Hateful Contraries xviii). Through studies of works by T. S. Eliot as well as discussions of topics such as “The Augustan Mode in English Poetry” and “The Criticism of Comedy” (xi), Wimsatt attempts to add to the efforts to justify and improve literary criticism (xix).

=== &quot;Literary Criticism: A Short History&quot; ===

Written with Cleanth Brooks in 1957, &quot;Literary Criticism: A Short History&quot; is intended as “a history of ideas about verbal art and about its elucidation and criticism” (Wimsatt and Brooks ix). The authors attempt to contribute to the “intelligibility in the history of literary argument” as well as “contributes to a distinct point of view,” which, they argue, is a necessary part of any historical literary studies (vii).

<text>Martín Chambi Jiménez (November 5, 1891 – September 13, 1973) was a Peruvian photographer, originally from Puno, in southern Peru. He was one of the first major Indigenous Latin American photographers.

Recognized for the profound historic and ethnic documentary value of his photographs, he was a prolific portrait photographer in the towns and countryside of the Peruvian Andes. As well as being the leading portrait photographer in Cuzco, Chambi made many landscape photographs, which he sold mainly in the form of postcards, a format he pioneered in Peru.

In 1979, New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art held a Chambi retrospective, which later traveled to various locations and inspired other international expositions of his work.

== Beginnings as a photographer ==

Martín Chambi was born into a Quechua-speaking peasant family in Puno, one of the poorest regions of Peru, on November 5, 1891. When his father went to work in a Carabaya Province gold mine on a small tributary of the Inambari River, Martin went along.

There he had his first contact with photography, learning the rudiments from the photographer of the Santo Domingo Mine near Coaza (owned by the Inca Mining Company of Bradford, Pennsylvania). This chance encounter planted the spark that made him seek to support himself as a professional photographer. With that idea in mind, he headed in 1908 to the city of Arequipa, where photography was more developed and where there were established photographers who had taken the time to develop individual photographic styles and impeccable technique.

== Photographic career ==

Chambi began his work as a photographer as an apprentice to Max T. Vargas (the father of Alberto Vargas) in Arequipa, Peru. During this time as an apprentice, Chambi learned different ways of manipulating light for portraits in the studio. His daughter, Julia Chambi, is quoted as saying, &quot;my father was enchanted by light.&quot; His studio in Cuzco included a set of blinds and shutters made specifically so that he could alter the natural lighting to best suit his photographs. Most of Chambi&#x27;s photos of Indigenous people were taken outside so that he could use only natural lighting.

After nine years set up his own studio in Sicuani in 1917, publishing his first postcards in November of that year. In 1923 he moved to Cuzco and opened a studio there, photographing both society figures and his Indigenous compatriots. During his career, Chambi also traveled the Andes extensively, photographing landscapes, Inca ruins, and local people.

Chambi traveled to Chile to exhibit some of his artworks, and used his artistic skills to allow the audience to understand how the photographer prioritized the Indigenous outcome that relates to the Peruvians and the Chileans.

Chambi produced a variety of works over his career as a photographer.In his studio, he took many portraits of wealthy and elite members of society as well as the Indigenous people. He also shot many self-portraits. Chambi is well-known for his work in documenting the Indigenous culture, including Machu Picchu and other prehispanic ruins. In a magazine interview in 1936, he is quoted saying &quot;in my archive I have more than two hundred photographs of diverse aspects of the Quechua culture.&quot; He took pictures of ruins and architecture, but also tried to capture the events of everyday life. Addressing Chambi&#x27;s diverse work, Jorge Heredia said, &quot;He has been the photographer of whites who seek after his images, but also of Indians and Mestizos.&quot;

In addition to taking photographs for individual commissions or for his own personal interests, Chambi also used his photographs in other publications. One such publication was the use of his photographs in postcards. His photographs frequently appeared in &quot;La Nación&quot; (&quot;The Nation&quot;), an Argentine weekly newspaper. They published his photographs of artists, writers, and any other assignments he was commissioned to do.

==Critical response==
&quot;It is wrong to focus too much on the testimonial value of his photos. They have that, indeed, but, in equal measure they express the milieu in which he lived and they show (...) that when he got behind a camera, he became a giant, a true inventor, a veritable force of invention, a recreator of life.&quot;
:- Mario Vargas Llosa

<doc id="443868" wikidata="Q928674" url="?curid=443868" title="USS Shark (SS-314)">
<text>USS &quot;Shark&quot; (SS-314), a , was the sixth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the shark, a large marine predator.

Construction began in 1943 and commissioning occurred in 1944. Following shakedown, &quot;Shark&quot; was deployed to the Pacific, where she attacked ships and rescued downed airmen. &quot;Shark&quot; was sunk on its third patrol by a Japanese destroyer on 24 October 1944. In the engagement in which she was sunk, &quot;Shark&quot; torpedoed and sank the Japanese freighter . &quot;Arisan Maru&quot; was transporting captured Americans, but carried no markings or flag indicating this. The Americans had no way of recognizing &quot;Arisan Maru&quot; was a prison ship. The sinking of &quot;Arisan Maru&quot; is the greatest loss of American life in a single military sinking.

== History ==
Her keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut, on 28 January 1943. She was launched on 17 October 1943 (sponsored by Mrs. Lera Millard Thomas, the wife of Albert Thomas, the United States Congressman from the Eighth District of Texas), and commissioned on 14 February 1944.

Following shakedown off New London, Connecticut, &quot;Shark&quot; transited the Panama Canal and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 24 April 1944 for final training in the Hawaiian area. Her first war patrol commenced on 16 May 1944 and was conducted in waters west of the Mariana Islands as part of a coordinated attack group with submarines and . Early on the morning of 2 June, &quot;Shark&quot; submerged ahead of an enemy convoy and fired a spread of torpedoes at a Japanese tanker. Although all missed the original target, the torpedoes continued on to hit and sink another enemy vessel, the 4,700-ton cargo ship, &quot;Chiyo Maru&quot;. After evading an ensuing depth-charge attack, the submarine continued her patrol.

On 4 June, &quot;Shark&quot; began tracking another heavily escorted convoy, and in maneuvering for attack, encountered a patrolling destroyer dead ahead. Upon failing in a maneuver for a &quot;down-the-throat&quot; shot, the submarine passed down the port side of the enemy at and launched four torpedoes toward a heavily laden cargo ship. She was rewarded with four solid hits that quickly sent &quot;Katsukawa Maru&quot; to the bottom. After escaping from the aroused escort ships, &quot;Shark&quot; surfaced and continued the chase. She caught up with the convoy on the afternoon of 5 June, and after nightfall, let go a spread of six torpedoes, which sank the 3,080-ton freighter &quot;Tamahime Maru&quot; and the 7,006-ton passenger-cargo ship &quot;Takoka Maru&quot;. &quot;Shark&quot; again evaded the escort ships, then surfaced near midnight, but was unable to catch up with the convoy. The remainder of the patrol was uneventful, and the submarine returned to Midway Island for refit on 17 June.

&quot;Shark&quot; put to sea on 10 July for her second war patrol, this time in the waters off the Volcano Islands and Bonin Islands. On 19 July, she launched four torpedoes at an enemy convoy, but they missed their mark as the convoy made a sharp &quot;zig&quot; away. On 1 August, &quot;Shark&quot; was again frustrated in an attack on a Japanese convoy when, while moving into firing position, three escorts forced her to take evasive action, allowing the convoy to escape. The following afternoon, the submarine set course for Iwo Jima, where she took up lifeguard station in support of carrier airstrikes.

On the afternoon of 4 August, &quot;Shark&quot; rescued two airmen from a crashed Curtiss SB2C Helldiver from AG19 piloted by William S. Emerson. She terminated her lifeguard duties on 19 August and touched at Midway Island before arriving at Pearl Harbor 10 days later.

&quot;Shark&quot; was lost during her third war patrol, probably in the vicinity of Luzon Strait, while participating in a coordinated attack group with submarines and .

On 24 October, &quot;Seadragon&quot; received a message from &quot;Shark&quot; stating that she had made radar contact with a single freighter, and she was going in to attack. This was the last message received from the submarine. She was reported as presumed lost on 27 November.

After making radar contact, &quot;Shark&quot; was in pursuit of a single freighter. Around 5:00 pm on 24 October 1944 in the Bashi Straits, South China Sea, latitude 20°46&#x27;N, longitude 118°18&#x27; E, the 6,886-ton Japanese freighter was sunk. &quot;Arisan Maru&quot; carried no markings or flag to indicate that she was carrying Allied prisoners of war. The Americans had no way of recognizing &quot;Arisan Maru&quot; was a prison ship. The torpedo launched from &quot;Shark&quot; hit aft of midships, causing &quot;Arisan Maru&quot; to split in two.

Naval records indicate that &quot;Shark&quot; was lost with all 87 hands in the same battle after having torpedoed &quot;Arisan Maru&quot;. &quot;Regardless of the final count, the sinking of the &quot;Arisan Maru&quot; still represents the greatest loss of American life in a single military sinking.&quot;

&quot;Shark&quot; received one battle star for World War II service.

Japanese records examined after the war indicate that on 24 October 1944, in Luzon Strait, made contact with a submerged submarine and dropped depth charges. After losing and regaining the contact, the destroyer dropped another 17 depth charges, which resulted in &quot;bubbles, heavy oil, clothes, and cork&quot; coming to the surface.

She was the second U.S. submarine named &quot;Shark&quot; to be sunk during the war. was sunk in early February 1942.

<text>Bluecurve is a desktop theme for GNOME and KDE created by the Red Hat Artwork project. The main aim of Bluecurve was to create a consistent look throughout the Linux environment, and provide support for various Freedesktop.org desktop standards. It was used in Red Hat Linux in version 8 and 9, and in its successor OS, Fedora Linux through version 4.
The Bluecurve window borders and GTK theme were replaced by those from Clearlooks (the former in Fedora Core 4, and the latter in Fedora Core 5). The Bluecurve icon set remained installed in Fedora 7, but was replaced as the default by Echo.

There had been controversy surrounding the theme, especially the alterations to KDE, which were sufficient to cause developer Bernhard Rosenkraenzer to quit Red Hat, &quot;mostly in mutual agreement — I don&#x27;t want to work on crippling KDE, and they don&#x27;t want an employee who admits RHL 8.0&#x27;s KDE is crippleware.&quot; Others simply criticized it for giving the same look to both desktops, even though they were obviously different in many ways. This approach was subsequently emulated by Mandrake Linux with their &quot;Galaxy&quot; theme, which was also available for GNOME and KDE, and in Kubuntu 6.06 with the GTK-Qt theme engine (enabled by default).

Enterprising GUI artists have created themes in the past that emulated the Bluecurve theme on other operating systems, including Microsoft Windows.

<doc id="443873" wikidata="Q373426" url="?curid=443873" title="Round the Twist">
<text>Round the Twist is an Australian children&#x27;s comedy drama television series which follows the supernatural adventures of the Twist family, who leave their conventional residence to live in a lighthouse, in the fictional coastal town of Port Niranda.

The series was created and produced by Patricia Edgar, and developed by the Australian Children&#x27;s Television Foundation (ACTF) as a show that both children and parents could watch. Early episodes were based on stories by author Paul Jennings.

==History==
Patricia Edgar agreed to have Jennings write the series on the condition he would be mentored by and collaborate with the director, actor, and writer Esben Storm.

Edgar previously worked with Storm on the children&#x27;s show &quot;Winners&quot; and the TV film series &quot;Touch the Sun&quot;. The partnership between Edgar, Storm and Jennings was an efficient team for the development of the first series, whose characters and community were set around a lighthouse on a coastline. Storm and Jennings drew from the plots in the latter&#x27;s existing short stories and created new ideas, sometimes using two stories in an episode to fill out the plots.

Edgar&#x27;s instructions, based on research done on Australian children&#x27;s viewing preferences, was to balance the stories around a family with three leading child characters. The children (Pete, Linda, and Bronson) were given equal time throughout the episodes&#x27; stories. The rest of the cast were to be gender-balanced. Edgar stressed the importance of jokes and humour and told Storm to push the boundaries, while grounding the series firmly in the emotions and issues of growing children.

&quot;Round the Twist&quot; was first produced by Edgar for the Australian Children&#x27;s Television Foundation (ACTF) in 1989. The four series of the program won 16 national and international awards, including the Prix Jeunesse, the Banff Rockie Award for Best Children&#x27;s Program, the Grand Jury Prize, two Gold World Medals in the Youth Category at the New York Festivals, two Australian Film Institute awards for Most Outstanding Children&#x27;s program, and five Australian Teachers of Media Awards.

The series was screened in over 70 countries by broadcasters such as Fox Kids (USA), BBC One (UK), Nickelodeon (UK), CBC Television (Canada), France 2 (France), ZDF (Germany), Network 2 (Ireland) and NHK (Japan).

In 1998, &quot;Round the Twist&quot; was chosen in the international trade magazine &quot;KidScreen&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Dream Block&quot; poll – a &quot;Dream Two-Hour Children&#x27;s Block&quot; — by the world&#x27;s leading programmers and distributors of children&#x27;s television. Other programs selected for the “Dream Block” included &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

== Synopsis ==
&quot;Round the Twist&quot; was set around an old lighthouse in the fictional Port Niranda, on the rugged southwest Victorian coast and features the Twist family: fourteen-year-old twins Pete and Linda, eight-year-old son Bronson, and father Tony, a widowed artist who makes sculptures. Each episode finds the Twist kids involved in surreal, supernatural adventures.

The series has been categorised as humorous, contemporary fantasy.

There were four series of &quot;Round the Twist&quot; made during the show&#x27;s 11-year run. The first 13 half-hour episodes were part of a three-program package the ACTF sold to the Seven Network in September 1988, which also included &quot;Kaboodle&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Tune on Earth&quot;. The first series of &quot;Round the Twist&quot; was based on the popular novels &quot;Unreal!&quot;, &quot;Quirky Tales&quot;, &quot;Unbelievable!&quot;, &quot;Cabbage Patch Fib&quot;, and &quot;Uncanny!&quot; by Jennings, who had three books on the Australian children&#x27;s bestseller list at the time.

Jennings was the scriptwriter for the first and second series, while Storm became script editor of the first series, co-writer for the second series, and screenwriter and script editor for the third and fourth series. Ray Boseley and Chris Anastassiades were also the writers for the third series, while Louise Fox, Christine Madafferi, and Robert Greenberg were assigned the fourth series. In addition to these, the second (1992), third (2000), and fourth series (2001) shared elements with the first regarding styles, characterisations, themes, locations, and genres with the original series. The third and fourth series were not based on Jennings&#x27; books but served as continuations for the former two series.

==Theme song==
The lyrics and music of the theme song were written by Andrew Duffield and sung by Tamsin West, who played Linda Twist in the first series. It borrowed lines from nursery rhymes such as, &quot;There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly&quot;, &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; and &quot;Rain Rain Go Away&quot;. The song was used in a series of Halloween television adverts by UK supermarket chain Sainsbury&#x27;s in 2018.

== Casting ==
Making a show about children over the course of more than a decade necessitated a number of cast changes, as the child actors became too old for their parts. Three sets of children (the Twists, the Gribbles, and Fiona) were cast, and most of the major adult roles were recast at least once.

Around sixty child actors from all over Victoria were divided into small groups and given the scripts to the workshop under Esben Storm&#x27;s direction.
;Notes
== Characters ==
The show revolves around the Twist family:
* Tony Twist (&quot;Dad&quot;) is a widower with a kind heart who maintains a romantic interest in Bronson&#x27;s schoolteacher, Ms. James, and regularly embarrasses the Twist children.
* Pete Twist is Linda&#x27;s 14-year-old twin brother who occasionally goes out with his classmate Fiona. Along with Linda, he enjoys teasing his younger brother Bronson. Pete finds himself in embarrassing situations, and is often under siege from Gribble Junior and his gang. 
* Linda Twist is Pete&#x27;s 14-year-old twin sister, whose interests include feminism, environmentalism, and judo. She enjoys picking on her younger brother. She takes life quite seriously and tries to bring a sense of normality to her family who sometimes go out of control. Linda also has a strong sense of justice, knows what is fair, and is prepared to go out of her way to achieve it. She is the most mature and spiritual of the Twist kids.
* Bronson Twist is the twins&#x27; 8-year-old younger brother. He is obsessed with food and odors and uses comedic malapropisms, such as confusing &quot;widower&quot; with &quot;windower&quot;. As the youngest of the family, he often feels left out of what his older siblings are doing, and tags along their adventures despite the possibility of danger or ridicule. On a few occasions, he is treated as older than his age, such as in Series 1, where he is expected to take full responsibility for a green baby he found in the cabbage patch.

=== Other ===
* Helen &quot;Nell&quot; Rickards (Series 2 as Nell Sands) – the old woman who lives in a cottage next door, whose brother, Tom, had been the former lighthouse keeper. Her father, mother, and sister died when the ship they were on sank. The family&#x27;s spirits, as well as Tom&#x27;s, haunted the lighthouse.
* Harold Gribble – a greedy real-estate agent and one-time Senate candidate, who often tries to force the Twists to move out of the lighthouse.
* &quot;Matron&quot; Cecilia Gribble – Harold&#x27;s supportive wife who is a nurse. She is just as scheming as her husband.
* James Gribble – Harold&#x27;s no-good son. He is a bully at school who often antagonizes Pete.
* &quot;Rabbit&quot; – one of James Gribble&#x27;s friends.
* &quot;Tiger&quot; Gleeson – one of James Gribble&#x27;s friends.
* Fay James – Bronson&#x27;s schoolteacher; Fay James is a love interest for Tony, and lives with the Twists in Series 3 and 4.
* Ralph Snapper – Pete and Linda&#x27;s teacher. He is a harsh disciplinarian who does not respond well to children&#x27;s insolence, but is socially awkward around adults.
* Fiona Richmond – Linda&#x27;s friend, and Pete&#x27;s sometime girlfriend.
* Hugh Townsend – Linda&#x27;s love crush in Series 1.
* Anthony – A well-meaning nerd with a crush on Linda in Series 3 and 4.
* Padre, Sacha, and Emily – Three girls Pete tries to win over in Series 4.
Characters who appear briefly in each episode of a series include:
* Ghosts of Nell Rickard&#x27;s family members – her parents Stanley &amp; Louise Rickards, her siblings Tom and sister Sarah Rickards. 
*Ghost Matthew and Ghost Jeremiah – ghosts of two men whose spirits were trapped in the lighthouse during Series 2 after they failed to guide a boat to shore one hundred years earlier.
* Ariel – a girl from the &quot;Isle of Dreams&quot; who wants to take Pete away in Series 4.
* Mr. Nic Papadelioises – a local small deli owner who gave Bronson his first job.

== Storylines ==

&quot;Round the Twist&quot; pushed the boundaries of acceptability for children&#x27;s television.

Four series of &quot;Round the Twist&quot; were made, each comprising thirteen episodes. Although each episode has a self-contained plot, each series has a recurring theme, usually an object or character which appears briefly in every episode, and develops until the final episode of each series in which it is explained and resolved.

The Twist family also has frequent conflicts with a ruthless local businessman, Harold Gribble, and his family. Gribble seeks to remove the Twists from the lighthouse in order to turn it into a tourist attraction. This is a continuing feature of the first series and a recurring feature of the third and fourth series.

=== Series 1 (1990) ===
The first series had the following episodes:

* &quot;Skeleton on the Dunny&quot;
* &quot;Birdsdo&quot;
* &quot;A Good Tip for Ghosts&quot;
* &quot;The Cabbage Patch Fib&quot;
* &quot;Spaghetti Pig Out&quot;
* &quot;The Gum Leaf War&quot;
* &quot;Santa Claws&quot;
* &quot;Wunderpants&quot;
* &quot;Lucky Lips&quot;
* &quot;Know All&quot;
* &quot;The Copy&quot;
* &quot;Without My Pants&quot;
* &quot;Lighthouse Blues&quot;

The lighthouse is haunted by eerie music coming from upstairs. In the final episode, &quot;Lighthouse Blues&quot;, the music is revealed to be played by the ghosts of Nell&#x27;s deceased family. The ghosts help the Twists prevent one of Gribble&#x27;s business associates from destroying the lighthouse.

In a subplot, Tony falls in love with Fay and spends the series developing a relationship with her, culminating in a marriage proposal at the finale. The answer to the proposal is left open-ended.

The series provides a lot of laughter and suspense and retains the surprise endings which made the books so popular among modern young readers.

=== Series 2 (1992) ===
The second series reintroduces the Twist family and the local identities from the coastal town of Port Niranda. The thirteen stories in the second series were completely new tales. They shared elements in style, characterisation, theme, location, and genre with the first series but each storyline was unpredictable and fresh.

The second series has the following episodes:

* &quot;Second Time Around&quot;
* &quot;Copy Cat&quot;
* &quot;Little Squirt&quot;
* &quot;Pink Bow Tie&quot;
* &quot;Nails&quot;
* &quot;Sloppy Jalopy&quot;
* &quot;Smelly Feet&quot;
* &quot;Grandad&#x27;s Gift&quot;
* &quot;Ice Maiden&quot;
* &quot;Yuckles&quot;
* &quot;Quivering Heap&quot;
* &quot;Little Black Balls&quot;
* &quot;Seeing The Light&quot;

Richard Moir reprises his role as Tony, but his children have been recast.

The lighthouse is haunted again by two ghosts who reveal themselves as Matthew and Jeremiah, who are being punished because, 100 years ago, they failed as lighthouse keepers to stop a ship carrying Matthew&#x27;s love, Jane, from being wrecked on the rocks. In the final episode, &quot;Seeing the Light&quot;, the ghost ship comes again, and this time, all of the characters from the show help turn on the lighthouse light and save the family who was lost at sea and redeem the ghosts.

Tony and Fay become officially engaged, but Fay becomes concerned that Bronson does not want her to marry Tony, which leads to the engagement being broken off. They are re-engaged at the end of the series.

In this series, Mr. Gribble is not concerned with removing the Twists from the lighthouse; rather, he campaigns for a Senate seat with the fictional Progressive Conservative Party. Disagreeing with his policies, Nell runs against him in a party similar to the Australian Greens and ultimately wins in a landslide.

=== Series 3 (2000) ===
The demand for more &quot;Round The Twist&quot; worldwide led Edgar to proceed with Series 3 and 4, which were made back-to-back with the same child cast. Storm led the workshops to create scripts for the third and fourth series, which have the following episodes:

* &quot;The Big Burp&quot;
* &quot;Viking Book of Love&quot;
* &quot;Whirling Derfish&quot;
* &quot;UMI&quot;
* &quot;Truth Hits Everybody&quot;
* &quot;The Nirandathal Beast&quot;
* &quot;Mail-Boo&quot;
* &quot;Brainless&quot;
* &quot;Toy Love&quot;
* &quot;Tears of Innocence&quot;
* &quot;The Ice Cream Man Cometh&quot;
* &quot;If the Walls Could Talk&quot;
* &quot;The Big Rock&quot;

The third series recast most of the characters. In this series, Mr. Gribble plans to turn Port Niranda into the honeymoon capital of the world by tearing down the lighthouse and building a casino in its place. Fay has moved in with Tony and the kids for a trial period to see if they can live in harmony with each other.

=== Series 4 (2001) ===
The fourth series has the following episodes:

* &quot;Welcome Back&quot;
* &quot;Monster Under the Bed&quot;
* &quot;Linda Godiva&quot;
* &quot;Dog by Night&quot;
* &quot;TV or Not TV&quot;
* &quot;Face the Fear&quot;
* &quot;Hair Brain&quot;
* &quot;Princess and the Pete&quot;
* &quot;Bird Boy&quot;
* &quot;The Shadow Player&quot;
* &quot;Radio Da Da&quot;
* &quot;Skunkman&quot;
* &quot;The Isle of Dreams&quot;

In each episode, a knight in armour enters the lighthouse through a magical door. At the beginning of the series, the knight&#x27;s face is hidden behind a visor; in the second half, the visor is raised. In the final episode, &quot;The Isle of Dreams&quot;, the stranger is revealed to be a girl, Ariel, who offers the children a perfect life on the Isle of Dreams if Pete will become her husband. In the end, they decline, and Ariel disappears forever, along with the enchanted isle.

A subplot in this series is Fay&#x27;s pregnancy with Tony&#x27;s baby, named Ariel, who is born in the series finale.

== Production ==

=== Series 1 ===
The first series of &quot;Round The Twist&quot; went into pre-production in March 1989 and production began on 4 April and ran for 13 weeks. Filming took place at Melbourne Film Studios and the lighthouse on the Victorian coast.

Throughout the series, several locations in Victoria, Australia, were used for external shots. Exterior scenes of the Twist family&#x27;s lighthouse home were shot at the Split Point Lighthouse in Aireys Inlet. The school and some town scenes were shot in Williamstown, Point Lonsdale, and Queenscliff.

The seventh episode of series one was supposed to be &quot;Frozen Stiff&quot;, but that had to be changed as it was too expensive to freeze a house and thirty animals inside large ice blocks.

Nell was supposed to die in &quot;Lighthouse Blues&quot;, but Storm told Jennings, &quot;it&#x27;s too depressing after thirteen weeks. We can&#x27;t finish the series by killing off a well-loved character.&quot;

The first two series were written by Jennings and edited by Storm. Jennings made cameo appearances, including as the ghost of Ben Byron in &quot;Without My Pants&quot;.

=== Series 2 ===
Following the success of &quot;Round the Twist&quot; both in Australia and in overseas markets, the ACTF developed a second 13-episode series. The second series was in pre-production in April 1992. Filming took place from 23 March to 19 June 1992 and finished on 23 June 1992.

Edgar continued as executive director, and Jennings and Storm wrote the scripts. Storm was the main series director, Steve Jodrell also directed episodes in the second series, and Antonia Barnard was the co-producer of the second series. Adult cast members remained the same as in the first series, except for Mr. Gribble and Matron Gribble, who were recast with Mark Mitchell and Jan Friedl. Auditions were held in 1991 to find new child actors to replace characters like Pete, Linda, and Bronson. The second series was in post-production until 30 November 1992. It was pre-purchased by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the British Broadcasting Corporation, Ravensburger Film, and TV Gmbh (for German-speaking territories), and Tri Star Gmbh (for Italy).

=== Series 3 ===
The third and fourth series were written by various writers and re-used the same characters, but they did not draw from Jennings&#x27; material. Two years before the third series was aired, Jennings&#x27; stories were being adapted into a different show called &quot;Driven Crazy&quot;, which failed to match the popularity of the early &quot;Round the Twist&quot; and of which only one series was produced.

The ACTF started development of a new series of &quot;Round The Twist&quot; in 1997. It was produced by Edgar with Bernadette O&#x27;Mahony and written by Storm, Chris Anastassiades, and Ray Boseley. The series was directed by Boseley, Storm, and Pino Amenta. The series was pre-sold to the ABC, BBC, Nickelodeon UK, and Disney European channels, and financed by the Australian Film Finance Corporation. The scripts were completed by November 1997, and official pre-production of the series commenced in November 1998. An Australia-wide search for the child leads was conducted, and more than 800 children auditioned for the roles of Linda, Pete, Bronson, and the Gribble gang, Rabbit, Tiger, and Gribbs. Filming took place on location at Aireys Inlet and Crawford Productions&#x27; studio in Melbourne in early 1999. The series was completed and distributed to broadcasters in November 1999.

=== Series 4 ===
Storylines for the fourth series were being written in 1998 following a creative workshop directed by Storm in early September at the ACTF&#x27;s offices. In 2000, the ACTF completed the development of the fourth series of &quot;Round the Twist&quot;, which was written by Storm, Boseley, Louise Fox, Christine Madafferi, and Robert Greenberg. The pre-production of the fourth series commenced in November 1999, with principal photography starting in February 2000 and ending in May 2000. Edgar was executive producer and producer, and the line producer was Helen Watts, with directors David Swann, Arnie Custo, and Boseley. Filming for the series started on 7 February 2000, and continued for three months in and around Melbourne, in the Crawford Productions&#x27; studio, Williamstown Primary School, and Airey&#x27;s Inlet. Most of the main cast from Season 3 returned for Season 4.

=== Feature film ===
A full-length &quot;Round the Twist&quot; feature film was developed and written by Storm and Boseley. Under Storm&#x27;s guidance, a storyline workshop for the feature film was held in October 1994. Production was planned for 1997–98, but funding for the project was not granted. Edgar explains in her book &quot;Bloodbath&quot; that feature films based on television are rarely financed by distributors, must compete with big-budget films, and are typically launched during the school holidays, among many other complicating factors. Despite Edgar&#x27;s best efforts to have the &quot;Round the Twist&quot; feature film come to fruition, the project was scrapped.

== Reception ==
In the United Kingdom, &quot;Round the Twist&quot; aired on BBC One during the channel&#x27;s Children&#x27;s BBC strand several times in the 1990s and early 2000s. It was rerun in 2007 on Channel 5 on Sunday mornings. It also regularly appeared on Network 2 in Ireland, and was popular in Germany and the Netherlands. It was shown in Sri Lanka by the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation. In Canada, it won the Banff Television Festival award for &quot;Best Children&#x27;s Program&quot; in 2000, and in Australia, it won the Logie Award for &quot;Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program&quot; in 2001 (tied with &quot;Hi-5&quot;) and 2002. It was also nominated for an award at the Australian Film Institute. The show is currently shown in Australia on ABC Me.

=== Series 1 ===
In 1995, TV 4 Sweden advised that the &quot;Round the Twist&quot; series won its time slot in the afternoons with a 25 percent audience share. TV 2 Denmark also screened the series during the year and reported excellent ratings. In Denmark, &quot;Round the Twist&quot; is called “The Children Of The Lighthouse”; in Germany, it is called “Twist Totale”. The Finnish Broadcasting Company and Wharf Cable in Hong Kong acquired &quot;Round the Twist&quot; in March 1995, while AVRO, a Dutch public channel, acquired the second series in June 1995.

The ACTF received letters and phone calls from viewers of &quot;Les Twist Famille&quot; in France, many of whom had watched the program on Canal J, the French children&#x27;s channel. In Canada, CBC Television started screening the program in May 1995, while the French-language version was broadcast on sister channel Télévision de Radio-Canada later that year. The CBC reported that a significant number of university students had been among the correspondents writing to them to express their appreciation of the series.

=== Series 2 ===
The second series was pre-sold to the BBC and Ravensburger in Germany, and received an upfront distribution advance from DARO for Spain, Portugal, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Rumania, USSR, Africa (excluding South Africa), Ireland, Greece, Belgium, New Zealand, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Iceland, and South Korea.

In 1995, Series 1 of &quot;Round the Twist&quot; screened in Sweden for the first time by TV4. It was so popular that TV4 contacted the ACTF to acquire the second series so that it be immediately aired.

The second series of &quot;Round the Twist&quot; aired on TV 2 in Denmark in January 1995, and was shown on Canal J in France. The ACTF received letters and telephone calls from young viewers in France who loved the series.

In 1997, &quot;Round the Twist&quot; was named &quot;Kids’ Vid of the Week&quot; and given four stars by The Age Green Guide.

The acquisition of &quot;Round the Twist&quot; by FOX Network coincided with the repeat of series one on BBC1 in the UK. The series reached number two in the Top 10 Children&#x27;s Programs.

There were 6109 hits on the &quot;Round the Twist&quot; website from Finland during the second week in July 1997, which reflected local viewer interest.

&quot;Round The Twist&quot; series 1 and 2 sold and resold in 54 countries including the US.

To launch the program, the ACTF and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) transformed one of the ABC&#x27;s Elsternwick studios into a &quot;Round the Twist&quot; set. Four Foundation staff members attended the MIPCOM market in Cannes, France, in October 1992 to launch the second series of &quot;Round the Twist&quot; and &quot;Lift Off&quot; on the international market.

The second series of &quot;Round the Twist&quot; was a major success when it was screened on BBC1 in the United Kingdom in early 1993. It was rated the first most popular children&#x27;s program in the United Kingdom by the time it had finished airing. BBC Enterprises entered into a contract with the ACTF for the release of &quot;Round the Twist&quot; in the United Kingdom. Series 2 was also sold to Germany, Austria, Italy, France, Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Zimbabwe, and Thailand in 1993.

==== Family Album on ABC ====
Throughout 1994, the ABC presented a family viewing hour, Family Album, from 6.00 pm to 7.00 pm on Saturday, from 26 February 1994 to January 1995. The slot was conceived by Edgar in recognition of 1994 being the International Year of the Family.

The Foundation produced a study guide to accompany the Family Album series, which included information on individual programs and activities for students to supplement &quot;Round the Twist&quot;, and was sent out to all schools in Australia.

==== ACTF Programs in Children&#x27;s Hospitals ====
The ACTF donated 210 videos to the Starlight Fun Centre Trolley program operating in pediatric wards in hospitals around Australia; &quot;Round the Twist&quot; and &quot;Lift Off&quot; were particularly requested.

=== Series 3 ===
&quot;Round the Twist&quot; rated number one on the BBC in the middle of 1998. The BBC screened the third series at 4:30 pm on Monday afternoons from 10 January – 10 April 2000. Figures supplied by the BBC Broadcast Strategy Channel Development group indicated that the BBC audience viewership in the 4:30 pm slot increased by 13–18% share over the period when the program aired. The BBC&#x27;s average audience in those weeks was approximately two million people or 37% of the audience watching television at that time.

In Finland, the series aired daily during the summer holidays in June 2000. Yle described the screening as a &quot;great success&quot; with an average rating of 8.0. The audience share achieved was never less than 55% and it peaked at 75% in the 10- to 14-year-old age group.

Series 3 was a critical and popular success. In the 5.00 pm time slot, season 3 was consistently watched by 323,300 people, including:

* An average of 61% of children between the ages of 5–12 years old (compared to averages of between 9-19% on the other networks at this time)
* Over 31% of children in the 13-17 year age group

=== Series 4 ===
==== The Queen&#x27;s visit ====
The Foundation hosted Queen Elizabeth II during her Australian tour in March. She visited the Melbourne set of the fourth series on 23 March 2000, where she was greeted by Edgar, Janet Holmes à Court, and Dame Margaret Guilfoyle.

The Queen included &quot;Round the Twist&quot; as part of her itinerary in recognition of the ACTF&#x27;s achievements on behalf of young people since its inception in 1982. &quot;Round The Twist&quot; was the most commercially successful and popular Australian children&#x27;s drama series ever made. The third series (which was screened on the ABC and BBC when the Queen visited the set) attracted 2.1 million viewers in the UK in 2000 and was the highest-rated program for 5–12-year-olds in the 5:00 pm timeslot in Australia.

==== Studio City ====
Studio City at Melbourne Docklands opened in 2002. The ACTF signed a contract for a major children&#x27;s attraction at the proposed Paramount-branded theme park, and the attraction included the characters and adventures of the popular series, and featured a tree spirit, a Viking shipwreck, and a hall of distortion that culminated in a slide from the series’ lighthouse icon.

Edgar said the attraction would enable local families and overseas visitors to interact with the characters and storylines from Round The Twist.

Studio City, backed by Viacom, comprises a theme park, film and television studios, and a recreational precinct.

==== Melbourne International Festival and Museum ====
The cast members from &quot;Round the Twist&quot; were at the Big Box Family Children&#x27;s Festival. Two episodes from the fourth series, filmed earlier in the year, were screened at the new Melbourne Museum&#x27;s theatre. Many fans met their favourite characters from &quot;Round the Twist&quot; at the Festival on 29 October 2000; the Festival was jointly hosted by the Melbourne Festival and the Melbourne Museum.

The cast were the emcees for the day, and they introduced national and international performers including Ethiopian Circus and Wild Moves.

<doc id="443878" wikidata="Q376041" url="?curid=443878" title="Primm, Nevada">
<text>Primm (formerly known as State Line) is an unincorporated town in Clark County, Nevada, United States, primarily notable for its position straddling Interstate 15 at the Nevada–California border. It sits on Ivanpah Dry Lake, which extends to the north and south of town.

Primm was initially known as State Line and started as a small motel and coffee shop built by Ernest Primm in the 1950s. Over the years, Primm grew, with Gary Primm, Ernest&#x27;s son, expanding the area by building casino hotels. In 1996, the town was officially renamed Primm in honor of its founder and to avoid confusion with Stateline in northern Nevada.

The community&#x27;s economy is based on its two casinos (the Primm Valley Resorts), which attract gamblers from Southern California wanting to stop before reaching Las Vegas to the north, or as a last chance to gamble before leaving Nevada. Most of Primm&#x27;s residents are employees of the casinos. Conversely, a store located just over the California state line from Primm sells California State Lottery tickets and games (including the multi-state Mega Millions and Powerball games) mainly to residents of Nevada, whose constitution prohibits a state lottery. In addition to gambling, shopping, and dining, Buffalo Bill’s Resort and Casino also features several rides and attractions, notably the 200’ rollercoaster &quot;Desperado&quot;, which was previously—at the time of its debut in 1996–the tallest and fastest steel coaster in America. The ride travels outside and inside parts of the casino. There is also a log flume ride inside the casino building.

While not a census-designated place, the 2000 census population for the community is 436. A Clark County Comprehensive Planning Department estimate placed the population at 284 on July 1, 2006, apparently using different boundaries for the area. In a December 5, 2007 article in the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot;, Primm&#x27;s population is listed as around 1,132.

For 2020, Census Block 2156, Census Tract 57.03 and Block 2155, Census Tract 57.03 showed a total population of 650.

== Transportation ==
Primm, Nevada is located along Interstate 15, midway between Las Vegas, Nevada and Baker, California.

The nearest commercial airport is Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Primm hosted an Amtrak station at Whiskey Pete&#x27;s Resort until late 2017, operating bi-directionally with a premium deluxe Amtrak Thruway service between Bakersfield, California and Las Vegas, Nevada.

==History==
In the 1920s, Pete MacIntyre owned a gas station at the state line, on a road later designated U.S. Route 91. MacIntyre, apparently, had a difficult time in the gas business, eventually resorting to bootlegging (alcohol); Primm historians remember him as “Whiskey Pete”. According to local legend, MacIntyre expressed his desire to—upon his death in 1933–be buried in a vertical coffin with his body in a standing posture, along with a bottle of bootleg placed in his hands to “drink” as he “watched over” the region. Whiskey Pete&#x27;s unmarked grave was accidentally exhumed while workers were building a connecting bridge from Whiskey Pete&#x27;s to Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Hotel and Casino (on the other side of I-15); the remains were apparently relocated, and are now said to be buried in one of the caves where he cooked his moonshine.

During its heyday, Primm featured family-friendly attractions like the Adventure Canyon Log Flume and the Desperado roller coaster, which was once the world&#x27;s tallest. However, by the 2000s, Primm&#x27;s energy waned. In 1998, MGM Grand acquired the casinos from the Primm family, and later in 2007, they were sold to Affinity Gaming.

Dale Hamilton was the proprietor of State Line from the early 1950s to the early 1970s, as U.S. 91 was upgraded to today’s Interstate 15. After obtaining the property, Hamilton built a Chevron station, as well as a small-slots casino and a café/lunch counter. He also opened a basic automotive garage and maintained a towing service. He called the business simply &quot;State Line Bar:Slots&quot;. Hamilton also campaigned legislators in Carson City to grant an Interstate 15 interchange to the site, which was not originally planned.

In 2004, under the then-ownership of MGM Mirage, 52 apartment buildings were constructed in Primm to serve as more convenient housing for employees of the three casinos. The name of the apartment complex is the Desert Oasis, and its current location is at 355 E. Primm Boulevard.

Prizm Outlets, formerly known as the Fashion Outlets of Las Vegas, is a 370,000-square-foot mall that, as of 2023, is almost completely empty. It was sold in 2021 for $400,000.

==Climate==
Primm&#x27;s climate is a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification: BWh).

==Events==
In 1996, SCORE International started hosting an annual off-road race known as Terrible&#x27;s SCORE Primm 300. The Primm 300 is one in a series of annual off-road races that include the Baja 1000, Baja 500, San Felipe 250 and the Laughlin Desert Challenge.

In 1997, the 20th World&#x27;s Strongest Man competition was held in Primm.

Primm was the end location for the 2004 DARPA Grand Challenge. Additionally, it was the starting and ending location for the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. The $2 million prize was won by a team from Stanford University.

The Stateline Supermoto Challenge also takes place at Buffalo Bill&#x27;s casino every year attracting pro and amateur supermoto racers from around the country.

Primm is the location of the Mint 400, the American off-road race.

Primm is the location of WORCS, (World Off Road Championship) of two to four rounds of Motocross, UTV, Side by Side and ATV off-road racing.

Primm is also where Simon Lizotte set the Flying Disc Distance World Record at 263.2 m (863.5 ft) on October 25, 2014. He used a 157-gram Innova Blizzard Champion Boss.

== Bonnie and Clyde Getaway Car ==
Primm is home to the Bonnie and Clyde Getaway Car, the vehicle that Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were in when they were shot and killed after being pursued by the police. It was previously located inside Whiskey Pete&#x27;s, but was moved to the connecting annex between the Prizm Outlet Mall &amp; Primm Valley Hotel &amp; Casino in 2022.

The couple were shot and killed in Gibsland, Louisiana, on May 23, 1934, around 2,400 km (1,500 miles) from Primm.

== In popular culture ==
Primm appears as a location the player can visit in the 2010 videogame &quot;&quot;.

<text>Simon Newcomb (March 12, 1835 – July 11, 1909) was a Canadian–American astronomer, applied mathematician, and autodidactic polymath. He served as Professor of Mathematics in the United States Navy and at Johns Hopkins University. Born in Nova Scotia, at the age of 19 Newcomb left an apprenticeship to join his father in Massachusetts, where the latter was teaching.

Though Newcomb had little conventional schooling, he completed a B.S. at Harvard in 1858. He later made important contributions to timekeeping, as well as to other fields in applied mathematics, such as economics and statistics. Fluent in several languages, he also wrote and published several popular science books and a science fiction novel.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Simon Newcomb was born in the town of Wallace, Nova Scotia. His parents were John Burton Newcomb and his wife Emily Prince. His father was an itinerant school teacher, and frequently moved in order to teach in different parts of Canada, particularly in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Through his mother, Simon Newcomb was a distant cousin of William Henry Steeves, a Canadian Father of Confederation. Their immigrant ancestor in that line was Heinrich Stief, who immigrated from Germany and settled in New Brunswick about 1760.

Newcomb seems to have had little conventional schooling and was taught by his father. He also had a short apprenticeship in 1851 to Dr. Foshay, a charlatan herbalist in New Brunswick. But his father gave him an excellent foundation for the youth&#x27;s future studies. Newcomb was apprenticed to Dr. Foshay at the age of 16. Their agreement was that Newcomb would serve a five-year apprenticeship, during which time Foshay would train him in using herbs to treat illnesses. After two years Newcomb had become increasingly unhappy and disillusioned, as he realized that Foshay had an unscientific approach and was a charlatan. He left Foshay and broke their agreement. He walked the to the port of Calais, Maine. There he met a ship&#x27;s captain who agreed to take him to Salem, Massachusetts, where his father had moved for a teaching job. In about 1854, Newcomb joined his father in Salem, and the two journeyed together to Maryland.

Newcomb taught for two years in Maryland, from 1854 to 1856; for the first year in a country school in Massey&#x27;s Cross Roads, Kent County, then for a year nearby in Sudlersville in Queen Anne&#x27;s County. Both were located in the largely rural area of the Eastern Shore. In his spare time Newcomb studied a variety of subjects, such as political economy and religion, but his deepest studies were made in mathematics and astronomy.

In particular he read Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; (1687) at this time. In 1856 Newcomb took a position as a private tutor close to Washington, DC. He often traveled to the city to study mathematics in its libraries. He borrowed a copy of Nathaniel Bowditch&#x27;s translation of Pierre-Simon Laplace&#x27;s &quot;Traité de mécanique céleste&quot; from the library of the Smithsonian Institution, but found the mathematics beyond him.

Newcomb independently studied mathematics and physics. For a time he supported himself by teaching before becoming a human computer (a functionary in charge of calculations) at the Nautical Almanac Office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1857. At around the same time, he enrolled at the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University, graduating with a BSc in 1858.

===Peirce family===
Newcomb studied mathematics under Benjamin Peirce, who also often invited the poor scholar to his home. Newcomb&#x27;s biographer Brent said in his 1993 book that the young man developed a dislike of Peirce&#x27;s son, Charles Sanders Peirce and was accused of the &quot;successful destruction&quot; of C. S. Peirce&#x27;s career. In particular, Daniel Coit Gilman, president of Johns Hopkins University, was said to have been on the point of awarding tenure to C. S. Peirce, before Newcomb intervened behind the scenes to dissuade him. Brent says that about 20 years later, Newcomb similarly influenced the Carnegie Institution Trustees to deny a Carnegie grant to C. S. Peirce. This prevented Peirce from publishing his life&#x27;s work. The grant was supported by Andrew Carnegie, Theodore Roosevelt, William James, and others, who wrote to support it. Newcomb&#x27;s motivation has been speculated to have been that, despite he being &quot;no doubt quite bright&quot;, &quot;like Salieri in Peter Shaffer’s &quot;Amadeus&quot; he also had just enough talent to recognize he was not a genius and just enough pettiness to resent someone who was&quot;. Additionally &quot;an intensely devout and literal-minded Christian of rigid moral standards&quot;, he was appalled by what he considered Peirce&#x27;s personal shortcomings, making intolerable to Newcomb the fact that he had been reliant on the patronage of the father of a man he considered contemptible.

===Career in astronomy===
In the prelude to the American Civil War, many US Navy staff with Southern backgrounds left the service. In 1861, Newcomb took advantage of a vacancy and was hired as professor of mathematics and astronomer at the United States Naval Observatory, in Washington D.C. Newcomb set to work on the measurement of the position of the planets as an aid to navigation, becoming increasingly interested in theories of planetary motion.

By the time Newcomb visited Paris, France, in 1870, he was aware that the table of lunar positions calculated by Peter Andreas Hansen was in error. While in Paris, he realized that, in addition to the data from 1750 to 1838 that Hansen had used, there was earlier data documented as far back as 1672. But he had little time for analysis as he witnessed the defeat of French emperor Napoleon III in the Franco-Prussian War and the coup that ended the Second French Empire. Newcomb managed to escape from the city during the ensuing rioting; it led to the formation of the Paris Commune and engulfed even the Paris Observatory. Newcomb used the &quot;new&quot; data to revise Hansen&#x27;s tables.

In 1875 he was offered the post of director of the Harvard College Observatory but he declined, having by now settled that his interests lay in mathematics rather than observation.

===Director of the Nautical Almanac Office===
In 1877 he became director of the Nautical Almanac Office where, ably assisted by George William Hill, he embarked on a program of recalculation of all the major astronomical constants. From 1884 he also fulfilled a demanding role as professor of mathematics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, continuing, however, to reside at Washington.

With A. M. W. Downing, Newcomb conceived a plan to resolve much international confusion on the subject of astronomical constants. By the time he attended a standardization conference in Paris, France, in May 1896, the international consensus was that all ephemerides should be based on Newcomb&#x27;s calculations: Newcomb&#x27;s &quot;Tables of the Sun&quot;. As late as 1950, another conference confirmed Newcomb&#x27;s constants as the international standard.

===Personal life===

During the American Civil War, Newcomb married Mary Caroline Hassler on August 4, 1863. The couple had three daughters, and a son who died in infancy. Mary Caroline Hassler&#x27;s parents were US Navy Surgeon Dr. Charles Augustus Hassler and his wife. Her paternal grandfather was Ferdinand Hassler, the first Superintendent of the Coast Survey.

Newcomb died in Washington, D.C., on July 11, 1909, of bladder cancer. He was buried with military honors in Arlington National Cemetery with President William Howard Taft in attendance.

Newcomb&#x27;s daughter Anita Newcomb McGee (1864–1940) became a medical doctor and founded the Army Nurse Corps. She received the Spanish War Service Medal for her services during the Spanish–American War. For her later work in Japan, she was awarded the Japanese Imperial Order of the Precious Crown, the Japanese Red Cross decoration, and two Russo-Japanese War medals from the Japanese government. She was buried next to her father with full military honors.

Newcomb&#x27;s daughter Anna Josepha studied at the Art Students&#x27; League in New York. She was active in the suffrage movement. In 1912, she organized the first Cornwall meeting in support of voting rights for women. Josepha Newcomb married Edward Baldwin Whitney, who was the son of Professor William Dwight Whitney and his wife, and the grandson of US Senator and Connecticut Governor Roger Sherman Baldwin. He served as Assistant US Attorney General. Their grandson Hassler Whitney became a mathematician and professor.

==Work==
===Speed of light===
In 1878, Newcomb had started planning for a new and precise measurement of the speed of light. He believed it was needed to account for the exact values of many astronomical constants. He had already started developing a refinement of the method of Léon Foucault when he received a letter from Albert Abraham Michelson, a young naval officer and physicist who was also planning such a measurement. Thus began a long collaboration and friendship. In 1880, Michelson assisted at Newcomb&#x27;s initial measurement with instruments located at Fort Myer and the United States Naval Observatory, then situated near the Potomac River. Michelson had left to start his own project by the time Newcomb arranged a second set of measurements between the observatory and the Washington Monument. Though Michelson published his first measurement in 1880, Newcomb&#x27;s measurement was substantially different. In 1883, Michelson revised his measurement to a value closer to Newcomb&#x27;s.

===Benford&#x27;s law===
In 1881, Newcomb discovered the statistical principle now known as Benford&#x27;s law. He observed that the earlier pages of logarithm books, used at that time to carry out logarithmic calculations, were far more worn than the later pages. This led him to formulate the principle that, in any list of numbers taken from an arbitrary set of data, more numbers will tend to begin with &quot;1&quot; than with any other digit.

===Chandler wobble===
In 1891, within months of Seth Carlo Chandler&#x27;s discovery of the 14-month variation of latitude, now referred to as the Chandler wobble, Newcomb explained the apparent conflict between the observed motion and predicted period of the wobble. The theory was based on a perfectly rigid body, but Earth is slightly elastic. Newcomb used the variation of latitude observations to estimate the elasticity of Earth, finding it to be slightly more rigid than steel.

===Other work===
Newcomb was an autodidact and polymath. He wrote on economics and his &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot; (1885) was described by John Maynard Keynes as &quot;one of those original works which a fresh scientific mind, not perverted by having read too much of the orthodox stuff, is able to produce from time to time in a half-formed subject like economics.&quot; Newcomb was credited by Irving Fisher with the first-known enunciation of the equation of exchange between money and goods used in the quantity theory of money. He spoke French, German, Italian and Swedish; was an active mountaineer; and read widely. He also wrote a number of popular science books and a science fiction novel, &quot;His Wisdom the Defender&quot; (1900). Newcomb was the first person to observe the geophysical phenomenon Airglow, in 1901.

===On the state of astronomy===
In 1888 Simon Newcomb wrote: &quot;We are probably nearing the limit of all we can know about astronomy.&quot;
In 1900, his &quot;Elements of Astronomy&quot; was published by the American Book Company.

By 1903, however, his view had changed. In an article in &quot;Science,&quot; he wrote: 
&quot;What lies before us is an illimitable field, the existence of which was scarcely suspected ten years ago, the exploration of which may well absorb the activities of our physical laboratories, and of the great mass of our astronomical observers and investigators for as many generations as were required to bring electrical science to its present state.&quot;

===On the impossibility of a flying machine===
Newcomb is famously quoted as having believed it impossible to build a &quot;flying machine.&quot; He begins an article titled &quot;Is the Airship Possible?&quot; with the remark, &quot;That depends, first of all, on whether we are to make the requisite scientific discoveries.&quot; He ends with the remark &quot;the construction of an aerial vehicle ... which could carry even a single man from place-to-place at pleasure requires the discovery of some new metal or some new force.&quot;

In the October 22, 1903, issue of &quot;The Independent&quot;, Newcomb made the well-known remark that &quot;May not our mechanicians ... be ultimately forced to admit that aerial flight is one of the great class of problems with which man can never cope, and give up all attempts to grapple with it?&quot;, He suggested that even if a man flew, he could not stop. &quot;Once he slackens his speed, down he begins to fall. Once he stops, he falls as a dead mass.&quot; Newcomb had no concept of an airfoil. His &quot;aeroplane&quot; was an inclined &quot;thin flat board&quot;. He therefore concluded that it could never carry the weight of a man.

Newcomb was particularly critical of the work of Samuel Pierpont Langley, who claimed that he could build a flying machine powered by a steam engine, but whose initial efforts at flight were public failures. In 1903, however, Newcomb was also saying, 
&quot;Quite likely the 20th century is destined to see the natural forces which will enable us to fly from continent to continent with a speed far exceeding that of a bird. But when we inquire whether aerial flight is possible in the present state of our knowledge; whether, with such materials as we possess, a combination of steel, cloth and wire can be made which, moved by the power of electricity or steam, shall form a successful flying machine, the outlook may be altogether different.&quot;

Newcomb was not aware of the Wright Brothers&#x27; efforts, whose work was done in relative obscurity (Santos-Dumont flew his 14-bis in Paris only in 1906) and apparently unaware of the internal combustion engine&#x27;s better power-to-weight ratio. When Newcomb heard about the Wrights&#x27; flight in 1908, he was quick to accept it.

Newcomb favored the development of rotating wing (helicopters) and airships that would float in the air (blimps). Within a few decades, zeppelins regularly transported passengers between Europe and the United States, and the Graf Zeppelin circumnavigated the Earth.

===Psychical research===
Newcomb was the first president of the American Society for Psychical Research. Although skeptical of extrasensory perception and alleged paranormal phenomena, he believed the subject was worthy of investigation. By 1889 his investigations were negative and his skepticism increased. Biographer Albert E. Moyer has noted that Newcomb &quot;convinced and hoped to convince others that, on methodological grounds, psychical research was a scientific dead end.&quot;

<text>Georg Arthur Constantin Friedrich Zander (also Tsander, , tr. ; , – 28 March 1933), was a Baltic German pioneer of rocketry and spaceflight in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. He designed the first liquid-fueled rocket to be launched in the Soviet Union, GIRD-X, and made many important theoretical contributions to the road to space.

==Biography==
Zander was born in Riga, Russian Empire, into a Baltic German commoner family. His father Arthur Georg Zander was a doctor, but Friedrich Zander was fascinated by other natural sciences. Zander was enrolled in the Riga urban technical high school in 1898, for a seven-year program in which he was a top student. During this time, he became acquainted with the work of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and space travel became his foremost scientific passion. While studying engineering at the Riga Polytechnic Institute, he carried out trajectory calculations for a flight to Mars. Mars held a special fascination for Zander, and &quot;Forward to Mars!&quot; (Вперед, на Марс!) became his famous motto.

He graduated with his engineering degree in 1914, moved to Moscow in 1915. He worked at the &quot;Provodnik&quot; rubber plant, then in 1919 worked at Aircraft Factory No. 4 (&quot;Motor&quot;). In 1923, he was married to A.F. Milyukova, and they had a daughter named Astra and a son named Mercury. Mercury died of scarlet fever in 1929. After several years of unemployment and intensive research on rocketry and space travel, in 1926, Zander began work at the Central Design Bureau of Aviation, and in 1930 worked at the Central Institute of Aviation Motor Construction (TsIAM).

==Scientific contributions==

In 1908, he made notes about the problems of interplanetary travel in which he addressed issues such as life support and became the first to suggest growing plants in greenhouses aboard a spacecraft. In 1911, he published plans for a spacecraft built using combustible alloys of aluminum in its structure that would take off like a conventional aircraft and then burn its wings for fuel as it reached the upper atmosphere and no longer needed them. In 1921, he presented his material to the Association of Inventors (AIIZ), where he met and discussed space travel with V.I. Lenin, who was attending the conference. In 1924, he published it in the journal of Technology and Life (Tekhnika i Zhizn).

1924 was a particularly active year for Zander. The year before, Hermann Oberth had published the influential theoretical work &quot;Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen&quot; (&quot;The rocket to interplanetary space&quot;), which in turn introduced Zander and other Russian enthusiasts to the ground breaking work by Robert Goddard (&quot;A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes&quot; published in 1919). Zander took advantage of this by promoting Tsiolkovsky&#x27;s work, and developing it further. Together with Vladimir Vetchinkin and members of a rocketry club at the airforce academy, he founded the Society for Studies of Interplanetary Travel. In an early publication, they would be the first to suggest using the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere as a way of braking a re-entering spacecraft. The same year, Zander lodged a patent in Moscow for a winged rocket that he believed would be suitable for interplanetary flight, and in October gave a lecture to the Moscow Institute on the possibility of reaching Mars by rocket. During questioning after the lecture, he summarised the importance of reaching this planet in particular: &quot;because it has an atmosphere and the capacity to support life. Mars is also known as &#x27;the red star&#x27; and this is the emblem of our grand Soviet army.&quot;

Around this time, Zander became the first to suggest the solar sail as a means of spacecraft propulsion, although Johannes Kepler had suggested a solar wind sail in the 17th century.

In 1925 Zander presented a paper, &quot;Problems of flight by jet propulsion: interplanetary flights,&quot; in which he suggested that a spacecraft traveling between two planets could be accelerated at the beginning of its trajectory and decelerated at the end of its trajectory by using the gravity of the two planets&#x27; moons — a method known as gravity assist. Zander showed his deep understanding of the physics behind the concept and he foresaw the advantage it could play for interplanetary travels, with a vision far ahead of his contemporaries.

In 1929–1930, while at the IAM, Zander worked on his first engine, OR-1, which ran on compressed air and gasoline and was based on a modified blowtorch. He also taught courses at the Moscow Aviation Institute during this time. In 1931, Zander was a founding member of GIRD (Group for the Study of Reactive Motion) (Группа изучения реактивного движения (ГИРД)) in Moscow. As head of brigade #1, Zander worked on the OR-2 (GIRD-02) rocket engine, to power the &quot;216&quot; winged cruise missile. He also worked on the engine and rocket GIRD-10, which flew successfully on 25 November 1933. Zander had designed the rocket, but did not live to see it fly, having died of typhus in March of that year in the city of Kislovodsk.

<text>USS &quot;Perch&quot; (SS-176), a &quot;Porpoise&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the perch.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Perch&quot;′s keel was laid down on 25 February 1935 by the Electric Boat Company, in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 9 May 1936, sponsored by Mrs. Helen Lorena Withers (&quot;née&quot; LaBar), wife of Captain (later Admiral) Thomas Withers, Jr., then assigned to Naval Submarine Base New London at Groton, She was commissioned on 19 November 1936.

==Service history==

===Inter-war period===
After shakedown in the North Atlantic Ocean, &quot;Perch&quot; became a unit of the United States Pacific Fleet when she joined Submarine Squadron 6 (SubRon 6) in November 1937. The following spring she was engaged in the annual fleet problem and did some work on a survey of the Aleutian Islands, entering the Bering Sea on 28 February. In the spring of 1939, &quot;Perch&quot; operated with the fleet on its cruise to the United States East Coast.

In October 1939, &quot;Perch&quot; departed San Diego, California, for Manila where she became a division flagship and made a summer cruise in 1940 to Tsingtao and Shanghai. She spent the year preceding World War II in operations around the Philippines. A week before Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Perch&quot; rendezvoused with two transports off Shanghai and escorted the 4th Marine Regiment from China to the Philippines.

===World War II===
At the outbreak of hostilities on 8 December 1941 (7 December in Hawaii on the other side of the International Date Line), &quot;Perch&quot;, commanded by David A. Hurt, was in Cavite Navy Yard. She took part in the rush to clear the navy yard on 10 December and watched, at close range, the destruction of Cavite by Japanese bombers. That night, &quot;Perch&quot; slipped through the Corregidor minefields and scouted between Luzon and Formosa (now Taiwan) in search of targets. Failing to detect any, she shifted to an area off Hong Kong, and on the evening of 25 December 1941 launched four torpedoes at a large merchant ship, all missing. A few days later, she torpedoed a merchant ship, probably . Japanese escorts prevented &quot;Perch&quot; from observing the kill.

&quot;Perch&quot; proceeded south to Darwin, Australia, to repair damage, making several unsuccessful attacks &quot;en route&quot;. She next made a patrol to Kendari, Celebes (now Sulawesi), where she scouted the harbor and made several attempts to get through the narrow entrance to an attack position.

After a week of close contact with the Japanese while obtaining information, &quot;Perch&quot; headed south, searching for targets. In a night attack on a large merchant ship off the eastern coast of Celebes, &quot;Perch&quot; was hit in the superstructure, forward of the pressure hull of the conning tower, by a high-explosive round which blew away the bridge deck, punctured the antenna trunk and temporarily put her radio out of commission. Her crew made repairs on deck at night in waters heavily patrolled by the Japanese, and &quot;Perch&quot; headed for the Java Sea.

=== Final battle ===

On the evening of 1 March 1942, &quot;Perch&quot; surfaced northwest of Surabaya, Java, and started in for an attack on a Japanese convoy landing troops to the west of Surabaya. However, before this could be done, &quot;Perch&quot; just so happened to run into a pair of Japanese destroyers, the &quot;Minegumo&quot; and &quot;Natsugumo&quot;. Since she was still running on the surface, &quot;Perch&quot; crashed dived to avoid detection, and seemed to do so successfully, swerving into firing range for a potential kill, observing the enemy destroyers waiting for the right time to unleash the torpedoes, but upon a final inspection through the periscope, the destroyers were well aware of &quot;Perch&#x27;s&quot; presence and were preparing a depth charge attack. Hoping to score a kill before the reverse happened, &quot;Perch&quot; climbed to around 90 feet deep, but it was too late, &quot;Minegumo&quot; and &quot;Natsugumo&quot; were right on top of her and furiously unleashed their depth charges. The first patterned missed their mark, but a second pattern of four depth charges gouged &quot;Perch&quot; and inflicted considerable damage. The pressure hull and a section of the conning tower were dented inwards, several ventilation valves were jammed shut, major leaking occurred through the ship&#x27;s doors and gaskets, and around 90% of the ship&#x27;s instruments and gouges were broken or destroyed. &quot;Minegumo&quot; and &quot;Natsugumo&quot; assumed their target had perished and continued on, but &quot;Perch&quot; had enough integrity to remain under water, surfacing after 2 hours in the early morning of the 2nd and began sailing for repairs. Upon surfacing, the crew discovered practically every window was shattered, both pericope tubes were flooded, and only half the main engines were operable. &quot;Perch&quot; has survived her encounter, but still suffered major damage, yet still continued in hopes of attacking Japanese ships.

Because of this, two hours later just before sunrise, &quot;Perch&quot; was spotted yet again by the Japanese destroyers &quot;Ushio&quot; and &quot;Sazanami&quot;, prompting the submarine to immediately dive to 200 feet, but it was too late. &quot;Ushio&quot; and &quot;Sazanami&quot; dropped a depth charge attack, and the damage inflicted to &quot;Perch&quot; went from bad to worse. &quot;Perch&quot; attempted to maneuver away, but her crew discovered the propulsion system to be completely inoperable as &quot;Ushio&quot; and &quot;Sazanami&quot; further depth charged their enemy. &quot;Perch&quot; lied motionless underwater, and when sunrise broke, &quot;Ushio&quot; and &quot;Sazanami&quot; launched a final depth charge attack which caused the most critical damage of all before leaving the area, concluding they had sunk their target.

&quot;Perch&quot; was forced to surface, and through she had already been badly damaged by &quot;Minegumo&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Natsugumo&#x27;s&quot; attack, &quot;Ushio&quot; and &quot;Sazanami&quot; further crippled her. Upon resurfacing, seawater flooded the pressure hull, leaked in heat and humidity made the ship&#x27;s interior unbearable, and the ship was completely dead in the water. Damage control efforts eventually got just one of her four engines up and running, limiting &quot;Perch&quot; to just 5 knots. An attempt to dive was made, but it almost sank the ship then and there, and meaning the crew found out the hard way &quot;Perch&quot; was completely incapable of underwater travel and resurfaced for the last time.

By the evening of the 3rd, the idea to simply scuttle &quot;Perch&quot; was brought up, but her crew disputed the order as the crippled submarine desperately limped to repairs. While the crew was attempting to repair the watertight hatches on the deck, one sailor decided to light a cigar for a smoke. The blinkering light emitted by the cigar was spotted by Captain Tameichi Hara aboard the Japanese destroyer &quot;Amatsukaze&quot;, which quickly trained her guns on the submarine and fired away. 5-inch (127 mm) shells rained on &quot;Perch&quot; as &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; sped at 30 knots to decrease the range, and at least three shells made their mark, setting Perch on fire as in turn she trained her deck gun on what she reported as &quot;two light cruisers and three destroyers&quot; (actually the light cruiser &quot;Jintsū&quot; leading the destroyers &quot;Amatsukaze&quot;, &quot;Hatsukaze&quot;, &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, and &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot;)

Destroyer &quot;Yukikaze&quot; shortly joined &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; in the attack on &quot;Perch&quot;. Rather than pointlessly die on the defenseless vessel, &quot;Perch&#x27;s&quot; crew decided to abandon ship, and as &quot;Amatsukaze&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Yukikaze&#x27;s&quot; shells continued to damage her, several hull valves were opened in an attempt to scuttle the boat followed by her crew members jumping into the water one by one. &quot;Perch&quot; made her last dive as she slipped beneath the waves, followed by the destroyers ceasing fire. The next morning, Captain Hara called &quot;Amatsukaze&#x27;s&quot; crew to the deck to graduate them on their kill, and decided to ban smoking on the ship due to the experience. Simultaneously, &quot;Perch&#x27;s&quot; entire crew of nearly 60 men escaped the ship and were struggling in the water when a Japanese destroyer located them. It was the familiar &quot;Ushio&quot;, which was still on patrol duty and located the crew of the very submarine she helped to sink. All of the men were rescued by &quot;Ushio&quot;, which transported them to prison camps in the freshly captured Dutch East Indies. Besides 5 that died from malnutrition, all of them returned to their families on V-J Day.

===Wreck===
On 23 November 2006, Thanksgiving Day in the United States, the wreck of &quot;Perch&quot; was unexpectedly located by an international team of divers aboard MV &quot;Empress&quot; while searching for the wreck of the British heavy cruiser northwest of Bawean Island in the Java Sea. The expedition had hoped to locate and photograph the wreck of &quot;Exeter&quot;, sunk in the same area on 1 March 1942. The wreck of &quot;Perch&quot; was illegally salvaged sometime between 2006 and 2016 and no longer exists. Unlike the Dutch and British ships near her, which also were scavenged illegally, &quot;Perch&quot; was not a war grave, as she had been abandoned by her crew without fatalities.

==Awards==
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with one battle star for World War II service

Lieutenant Kenneth G. Schacht was awarded a Navy Cross for assisting in the scuttling of &quot;Perch&quot; and therefore preventing the Japanese from capturing classified code books, materials, and equipment.

==In media==
&quot;Perch&quot; is the subject of an episode of the syndicated television anthology series &quot;The Silent Service&quot;, which aired in the United States during the 1957–1958 television season.

<doc id="443917" wikidata="Q1353151" url="?curid=443917" title="Catch That Kid">
<text>Catch That Kid is a 2004 family action comedy film directed by Bart Freundlich, written by Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, and starring Kristen Stewart, Corbin Bleu, Max Thieriot, Jennifer Beals, Sam Robards, John Carroll Lynch, and James Le Gros. It is a remake of the Danish film &quot;Klatretøsen&quot; (2002) and tells the story of three kids who rob a bank to obtain the money to pay for the expensive and experimental surgery needed for the father of one of them when the insurance company and the bank president won&#x27;t help his wife.

The film&#x27;s working titles were &quot;Mission Without Permission&quot; (also the film&#x27;s UK title as well as part of one of the taglines), &quot;Catch That Girl&quot;, and &quot;Catch That Kid!&quot; The film received negative reviews.

==Plot==
Madeline Rose &quot;Maddy&quot; Phillips is a 12-year-old girl who loves to climb, often ascending the nearby water tower. Her father Tom shares her passion but fell more than 100 feet during a climb years earlier. Tom and his wife Molly are afraid Maddy may suffer a similar accident and have forbidden her from climbing. Latent injuries from Tom&#x27;s fall have recently paralyzed him from the neck down.

The family hears of an experimental operation which can save him, but insurance will not pay for the operation and the family does not have $250,000 for the treatment. Harderbach Financial&#x27;s president Donald Brisbane refuses to loan the amount, despite Molly being employed by the bank to design a security system. Maddy comes up with a plan to rob the bank for the money with her knowledge of her mother&#x27;s system.

Maddy steals three go-karts from her father&#x27;s race course and recruits her two friends Gus a young mechanic, and Austin a computer geek and aspiring filmmaker, to help her. To convince them, she separately tells each one she loves him and gives him one-half of her friendship necklace.

They break into Harderbach Financial on the night of a party Brisbane is throwing, bringing along Max, Maddy&#x27;s infant brother, whom she is supposed to be babysitting. Maddy distracts the security guards Ferrell and Gus&#x27; older brother Chad. Maddy and Gus progress to a room with thousands of security deposit boxes while Austin watches Max and manipulates the cameras and alarms to keep the guards away from them. After a sudden equipment failure with her climbing gear, Maddy is forced to free-climb the rest of the way up to the main vault containing hundreds of thousands of dollars. Upon reaching the vault door, she accidentally triggers a timer, then with seconds left, cracks the code (&quot;Madeline&quot;), grabs $250,000 from the vault, and flees the room, unintentionally setting off the alarm after forgetting to type the exit code. The trio manages to escape the bank&#x27;s Rottweilers and re-escapes Chad who tasers Ferrell, but then lets them go before accidentally tasering himself.

Molly arrives at the bank and Brisbane accuses her system of being useless and fires a Phillips family friend and bank employee Hartmann. Brisbane&#x27;s guest Francois Nuffaut apologizes to Molly and redirects the blame onto Brisbane for throwing a party at the bank before the security system was operable.

Gus and Austin find out that Maddy played them after seeing each other&#x27;s necklaces and leave her, but the trio reunites during a police chase and evades them successfully.

Maddy and her friends go to the hospital with the money to pay for the surgery, but Molly realizes who the thieves are (through the amount they stole being equal to that of surgery costs and the climbing gear Maddy left in the vault) and intercepts them. Molly realizes her daughter was only doing what she thought was right for her father and does a cover-up by telling the bank executives that the robbery was an unplanned test she performed as chief of security. As they leave, reporters outside the hospital give the public the full story.

Molly forgives Maddy for her actions. The public and the news studio sympathize with the Phillips family and donate money for Tom&#x27;s surgery. Brisbane is fired; Hartmann is promoted to bank president and gives them the loan.

Three months later, Tom has recovered from the surgery. Maddy, Gus, and Austin continue to argue playfully about who will be a better boyfriend for Maddy.

==Cast==
==Production==
Mara Wilson revealed she auditioned for the role of Maddy Phillips, despite knowing she was too old for the role, in a 2016 article written by the actress for &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Catch That Kid&quot; opened at #6 in the weekend of February 6, 2004, raking in $5.8 million in its first opening weekend. The film spent two weeks at the U.S. box office top ten. The film made $16.7 million in the United States and $226,963 in other countries for a worldwide total of $16.9 million, against a budget of $12 million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 13% based on 86 reviews and an average score of 3.82/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;An unimaginative heist movie aimed strictly at the preteen set.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 33 out of 100, based on 27 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Critics overall expressed dislike towards the film&#x27;s questionable morals and lack of originality, comparing it unfavorably to the &quot;Spy Kids&quot; trilogy. Despite these negative reviews, Roger Ebert of Ebert &amp; Roeper and the Chicago Sun Times gave &quot;Catch That Kid&quot; &quot;thumbs up&quot;, stating that it lacks the flash of &quot;Spy Kids&quot; and is more fun than &quot;Agent Cody Banks&quot;.

<doc id="443927" wikidata="Q1542592" url="?curid=443927" title="Grand Falls-Windsor">
<text>Grand Falls-Windsor is a town located in the central region of the island of Newfoundland in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, with a population of 13,853 at the 2021 census. The town is the largest in the central region, the sixth largest in the province, and is home to the annual Exploits Valley Salmon Festival. Grand Falls-Windsor was incorporated in 1991, when the two former towns of Grand Falls and Windsor amalgamated.

Grand Falls-Windsor is one of two major population centres in Central Newfoundland. 

==History==
In 1768, Lieutenant John Cartwright, while following the Exploits River through the Exploits Valley, named the waterfall he found &quot;Grand Falls&quot;. The land remained undeveloped until 1905, except for the Newfoundland Railway, which ran about north of Grand Falls. The railway offered development potential. 

In 1905, the town of Grand Falls was established as a company town using Garden City principles expounded by Ebenezer Howard. Worried about the impending war in Europe, Alfred Harmsworth (Baron Northcliffe) began looking for an alternative source of newsprint for his family&#x27;s newspaper and publishing business. During their search for a suitable location to build and operate a pulp and paper mill, Harold Harmsworth and Mayson Beeton, son of Isabella Beeton, the author of Mrs Beeton&#x27;s Book of Household Management, discovered Grand Falls. The site had great potential due to access to lumber, the possibility of hydroelectricity and a deep-water port available in nearby Botwood. On January 7, 1905, the Harmsworths and Robert Gillespie Reid, owner of the Newfoundland Railway, formed the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company, and the mill was constructed and opened on October 9, 1909. The first roll of salable newsprint was produced on December 22, 1909. Workers came from throughout the colony and the world to help develop the new area. At that time, only employees of the mill and workers from private businesses were permitted to live in Grand Falls. Other people settled north of the railway in a shack town known as Grand Falls Station, which became Windsor, named for the Canadian Royal Family.

The Anglo Newfoundland Development Company, owners of the town, catered to the social and athletic needs of the people living there. The Grand Falls Athletic Club was formed in 1907. Sports such as hockey, boxing, golf, soccer and baseball were played in the area. Increasing interest in music and the arts reflected in the creation of several clubs, including The Andophians, The Exploits Amateur Theatre Company, the Northcliffe Drama Club (1951) and Another Newfoundland Drama Company Inc. (A.N.D. Company Inc.) (1998). Several musical groups were formed. From 1905 to 1906, the religious needs of the residents were filled by visiting clergy. However, because of the increasing population of Grand Falls, several churches were built.

Due to its continued growth, Grand Falls Station became a vibrant town. Main Street, in what is now the former town of Windsor, featured lines of small business that catered to the needs of the residents and the town was officially incorporated on November 1, 1938. During the incorporation, Grand Falls Station changed its name to Windsor in honour of the British Royal Family, the House of Windsor.

In 1961, Price Brothers and Company Limited acquired a large amount of Anglo Newfoundland Development Company stock. An election for the first municipal government was soon held, which eventually led to the incorporation of the town of Grand Falls. In 1988, the town took the title of the World Forestry Capital briefly. Finally, in 1991, the towns of Grand Falls and Windsor voted to amalgamate, becoming the current town of Grand Falls-Windsor. The Abitibi Bowater pulp and paper mill closed in 2009.

In 1998, the Texas Vampires scandal occurred in the town, leading to the inception of the Newfoundland Health Research Ethics Authority.

Today, the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, part of the 5th Canadian Division is stationed in the town.

==Geography==
The town is located centrally on the island of Newfoundland. It is approximately an hour west of Gander, two and a half hours west of Clarenville and about four hours west of St. John&#x27;s. On the other hand, the town is slightly over two hours east of Deer Lake, two hours and forty-five minutes east of Corner Brook and close to five hours east of Port Aux Basques, when traveling on the Newfoundland and Labrador Route 1, part of the Trans-Canada Highway.

The town itself consists of the former towns of Grand Falls and Windsor. The Newfoundland and Labrador Route 1 runs through the middle of town, with exits for Main Street, Station Road, Cromer Avenue, Union Street, Grenfell Heights and New Bay Road. Main thoroughfares in the town include Lincoln Road, Cromer Avenue, Main Street, High Street, and Scott Avenue, though this list is not exhaustive.

===Climate===
Grand Falls-Windsor has a humid continental climate (Koppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;), its classification being similar to the remainder of Newfoundland. Due to its farther inland position than most localities the influence of the Atlantic Ocean and its moderation is less prevalent, rendering its summers the warmest on the island. Winter lows are also more extreme than in St. John&#x27;s and Corner Brook, although swings are very moderate when compared to areas on similar latitudes in continental Canada.

==Economy==
On December 4, 2008, Abitibi Bowater released a statement concerning imminent closure of the pulp and paper mill in Grand Falls-Windsor, representing a cutback of 205 000 tons of paper. The mill produced its last roll of newsprint on February 12, 2009. The closure was effected due to exchange rate volatility, energy, and fiber pricing, as well as structural challenges in the North American newsprint industry. At the time of closure, the paper mill was the second largest employer of the town. From 2016 to 2017, the mill was demolished.

Like most other communities in Newfoundland and Labrador, Grand Falls-Windsor has suffered from out-migration. However, the town endures as the service centre for all of Central Newfoundland. Despite the mill closure, businesses continue to grow in the community. Central Health is the largest employer in the town. The town&#x27;s heritage centre now stands where the mill training centre once did.

==Services==

===Education===
The town is part of the Newfoundland and Labrador English School District and is served by Woodland Primary (kindergarten to grade 3), Sprucewood Academy (Grade 4 to Grade 6), Forest Park Primary (kindergarten to Grade 3), Exploits Valley Intermediate (Grade 7 to Grade 9) and Exploits Valley High (Grade 10 to Grade 12).

Post-secondary training is available at the College of the North Atlantic, a community college formed in 1977.

Private colleges include Keyin College and Corona College.

===Health===
Healthcare services in the town are administered by Newfoundland and Labrador Health Services.

===Transportation===
The nearest airport is the Exploits Valley (Botwood) Airport located north of Bishop&#x27;s Falls which is used for hospital medical airlift transports and some private small aircraft. The nearest international airport is Gander International Airport, approximately east of Grand Falls-Windsor. There is a public heliport on Scott Avenue, Grand Falls-Windsor Heliport operated by the town.

===Media and communications===
Communication services are provided by AT&amp;T Canada, Primus Canada and Aliant, formerly NewTel Communications. The companies provide mobile phones, high speed Internet and digital television, including CJON-TV (NTV), the only privately owned television station in Newfoundland and Labrador, and other services.

The local newspaper, the &quot;Advertiser&quot;, was published twice weekly from 1936 until 2017, and has been replaced by &quot;The Central Voice&quot;. It had a readership of more than 10,000 per edition and had won numerous awards, both regionally and nationally. The paper was first published by brothers Mike and Walter Blackmore, with Mike&#x27;s wife, the former Laura Cantwell, serving as the first editor.

Private radio stations in the town include CHEV-FM (94.5), CKXG-FM (102.3), CKCM (620), a VOCM affiliate, both owned by Stingray Radio and CKMY-FM (95.9) owned by Geoff Stirling.

It is named for Demasduit&#x27;s European given name. A locomotive of the Newfoundland Railway which was closed down in 1988 can be seen in front of the museum. The Salmonid Interpretation Centre at the Grand Falls is noteworthy as well Also every year in summer the Salmon Festival is held; it has had performances by Aerosmith, Kiss, and The Eagles.

===Harmsworth Hall===
Harmsworth Hall was constructed by the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company in 1929. This was one of the most important companies in Newfoundland in the early part of the 20th century. It was largely responsible for the development of Grand Falls as a town with the creation of a pulp-and-paper mill. The company named the hall after one of the original owners of the mill, and for decades it served the community as a theatre, playhouse and meeting hall.

The Town of Grand Falls was incorporated in 1963, and the company gave the building to the new municipality as a town hall. Since then, the city council has renovated the interior to include offices and council chambers. The hall still operates as the offices for the Town of Grand Falls-Windsor.

The hall has a wood frame with a brick exterior and stands two storeys tall. It has roof trim moulding, copper flashing and large arched windows that overlook High Street, the main street in Grand Falls. It has concrete lintels over the doors and windows, and the centre portion of the hall features a peaked roof.

Harmsworth Hall became a Registered Heritage Structure in 1998. It is one of very few heritage structures in central Newfoundland.

<text>Digos, officially the City of Digos (; ), is a component city and capital of the province of Davao del Sur, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 188,376 people.

The city lies on the western shores of Davao Gulf and southern foothills of Mount Apo on the island of Mindanao, centrally located between the three major cities in Mindanao, Davao City in the north, General Santos in the south and Cotabato City in the west.

It is the second most populous city in Davao del Sur after the highly-urbanized city of Davao as well as the fourth most populous city in Davao Region. And it is also considered as part of Metropolitan Davao.

It is known for its sweet-juicy &#x27;carabao variety mango,&#x27; sold locally and exported abroad, thus being dubbed as the Mango Capital City of the Philippines. It is also considered as The Gate City Of The South.

On September 8, 2000, Digos was converted into a city.

==History==

In the early days, Digos was a watercourse, a meeting place of inhabitants belonging to the Austronesians who settled along the southern foothills of Mount Apo. The Digos River meets Davao Gulf and it is ideal for fishing and bathing.

Digos was once part of the Sultanate of Maguindanao. During the 1800s, it was under the influence of Datu Bago, a Maguindanaon datu who led the resistance in Davao Region against the Spanish Empire.

During the Spanish Era, a group of natives carrying bows and arrows were approached by some Spaniards traversing the very fertile tracts of land in Davao. One Lopez Jaena Pacheco, a conquistador during the administration of Governor Claveria serving as the head of the group, inquired about the name of the place from the barefooted natives. Believing that the Spaniards were asking where they were bound to, the natives answered &quot;Padigus&quot;, which means &quot;to take a bath&quot;. Since then the place was identified as Digos.

As a portion of the &quot;food bowl&quot; of the province of Davao del Sur, otherwise known as the Padada Valley, Digos lured many migrants, majority of whom came from the Visayas and Ilocos regions to settle permanently in the area. Before World War II, an enterprising American by the name of N.E. Crumb leased 10.24 km2 and transformed the place into an Abaca Plantation. This became the hub of economic activity in the locality during those days.

Digos was occupied by the Japanese troops in 1942.

In 1945, through the brave efforts of the combined forces of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, the local Davaoeño guerrilla units from the Davao peninsula, and the United States military, the Japanese soldiers were defeated.

Through the initiation of Davao Congressman Apolinario Cabigon, Digos, became a regular municipality of the unified Davao in 1949 by virtue of Presidential Executive Order No. 236, dated July 1, 1949, issued by President Elpidio Quirino. Its coverage included the barrios of Tres de Mayo, Goma Bansalan, Matanao, Darapuay and the Poblacion, where the seat of government was located. Before its creation into a municipality, Digos was a barrio of Santa Cruz, a town away. On July 19, 1949, the town was formally inaugurated with Benito Rabor appointed as Mayor.

On May 8, 1967, the municipality became part of Davao del Sur following Davao&#x27;s division under Republic Act No. 4867.

Digos in later years, before its conversion into a city, was regarded as the capital town of the Province of Davao del Sur, long before it gained the status of a First-Class Municipality in 1993, being center for trade, commerce and education, accruing to its strategic location at the cross point of two principal thoroughfares in the south.

===Cityhood===

In July 1998, the bid to convert into a city was moved and initiated by Mayor Arsenio A. Latasa, considering its very satisfactory qualifications required for in R.A. 7160

House Bill No. 5672 dated November 24, 1998, of Congress authored by Davao Del Sur 1st district Congressman Douglas Cagas, led to the drafting of Republic Act No. 8798, converting the Municipality of Digos into a component City of Davao del Sur, which was signed by President Joseph Estrada on July 14, 2000, and ratified by the Digoseños on September 8, 2000.

<text>Badger is a town in north-central Newfoundland, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada on the Exploits River. It supplied pulp and paper for the mills in Grand Falls for many years and was famous for its large spring log drives. The town is located in the interior of the island, twenty miles west of Grand Falls in Division No. 6. Badger was incorporated as a Town on September 30, 1963.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Badger had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==History ==
=== Early history ===
The name of the town was taken from Badger Brook, which flows through the town and is a tributary of the Exploits River. The Brook was initially thought to flow into Badger Bay, and was named Badger Bay Brook. It was later shortened to Badger Brook. (It does not flow into Badger Bay.)

The history of human settlement in what is now Badger can be traced back to the Beothuck, who are known to have lived where Badger Brook flows into the Exploits River. There are remains of Beothuck sites known in the area. A strategically important point with regards to transportation by water, the Mi&#x27;kmaq are also known to have used this area as a camp site when traveling to the Exploits River and on to Halls Bay.

=== Logging and lumbering ===

The Mi&#x27;kmaq family names most closely associated with Badger are Paul and Barrington, and it is a John Paul that is thought to be the first permanent resident of the town. John Paul and John Barrington are known to have trapped in current Badger area. John Barrington also served as a guide in the 1875 survey for the Newfoundland railway. The area was all wilderness until about 1894, when the Newfoundland Railway went through. Soon after, the first railway workers settled there. Around that same time, lumbering operations commenced and was initially a source of logs for the Exploit Lumber Company, who had a sawmill at Botwood and owned the timber limits. The same company established a mill at Badger sometime around the turn of the century. According to the Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador, there were two mills in the area in 1901. A company known as the Newfoundland Pinelands Company owned a mill at Badger in 1905. Pinelands was a Harvey and Company subsidiary. The lumbering operations in Badger were taken over in the period 1905–1909 by Harry Judson Crowe, who would later sell the timber limits to the A.E. Reed (Newfoundland) company as a source of wood for their Bishop&#x27;s Falls pulp mill.

In 1911, the Reed company began a series of sales of timber rights with the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company (&quot;A.N.D.&quot;) which led to the latter&#x27;s acquisition of most of the timber limits in the area. In 1910–1911 A.N.D. established Badger Woods Division to facilitate logging operations. From that point until 1965 the A.N.D. Co would be the most important force in the local economy. In 1911 AND Co built warehouses, repair shops, blacksmiths forges and a cable scow to facilitate the movement of men, horses and supplies across the Exploits River.

== The Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company and the &quot;Badger Drive&quot; ==

Perhaps Badger&#x27;s most important role in logging was that it was from there that the &quot;Badger Drive&quot; was conducted. This log drive took place on the Exploits River between Badger and Grand Falls and was carried on between 1908–1991. It was famously described by John Valentine Devine in his song &quot;The Badger Drive&quot;. Most all of the pulpwood from Millertown and Badger divisions west of Badger had to pass through the area. To facilitate this, hundreds of men were employed keeping the logs flowing down the river.

During the 1920s, a tractor repair garage was also built by A.N.D. Co. in the town to repair its tractors. This garage later involved the Newfoundland Tractor and Equipment Company, who preferred to do all the maintenance for A.N.D. Co. With the building of the road to Halls Bay, Badger became a railhead for the communities in the Springdale and Green Bay areas.

For many years Badger, was essentially a company town, with most services provided by the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Company. Under this company, the town was the responsibility of a man by the name of Hugh Wilding Cole. Cole was an Englishman who came to work for A.N.D. Co in 1905. As superintendent of the Badger Division, Cole was known as the &quot;Mayor of Badger.&quot;

As logging was the mainstay of the area, Badger received national attention during the 1959 Newfoundland International Woodworkers of America (IWA) Strike. The Strike culminated in March 1959 with a riot in the town in which one policeman was killed and dozens of loggers injured.

=== Recent history ===
When a bridge was built over the Exploits River at Grand Falls in the early 1960s, Badger&#x27;s importance as the gateway into the lumber woods was greatly diminished. In 1965 it ceased to be a woods division. Despite this, logging remained important to the community for many years. Some people found employment in mining at the nearby Buchans and Gullbridge mines, though these would later close. The closure of these mines combined with the closure of the Newfoundland Railway in 1988 took much importance away from the town. Today many residents, as well as students, commute to Grand Falls-Windsor for work and school. As of late, important players in the town economy include several gas stations and restaurants, a heavy equipment training school and a metal fabrication establishment.

Long plagued by flooding, Badger was inundated by a catastrophic flood on Saturday, February 15, 2003 when the Exploits River, Red Indian River, and Badger River were backed up with ice jams, causing water levels to rise 2.5 meters overflowing their banks and flooding the town under several feet of water and ice. The town was forced to evacuate and many found lodging in nearby Grand Falls-Windsor.

In 2008, a novel by J. A. Ricketts, &quot;The Badger Riot&quot;, was written depicting the events of the IWA Strike in 1959. The book would become the bestselling book in Atlantic Canada for that year.

<doc id="443932" wikidata="Q1798523" url="?curid=443932" title="USS Los Angeles (ZR-3)">
<text>USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot; was a rigid airship, designated ZR-3, which was built in 1923–1924 by the Zeppelin company in Friedrichshafen, Germany, as war reparations. She was delivered to the United States Navy in October 1924 and after being used mainly for experimental work, particularly in the development of the American parasite fighter program, was decommissioned in 1932.

==Design==
The second of four vessels to carry the name USS &quot;Los Angeles&quot;, the airship was built for the United States Navy as a replacement for the Zeppelins that had been assigned to the United States as war reparations following World War I, and had been sabotaged by their crews in 1919.
Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles Luftschiffbau Zeppelin were not permitted to build military airships. In consequence &quot;Los Angeles&quot;, which had the Zeppelin works number LZ 126, was built as a passenger airship, although the treaty limitation on the permissible volume was waived, it being agreed that a craft of a size equal to the largest Zeppelin constructed during World War I was permissible.

The airship&#x27;s hull had 24-sided transverse ring frames for most of its length, changing to an octagonal section at the tail surfaces, and the hull had an internal keel which provided an internal walkway and also contained the accommodation for the crew when off duty. For most of the ship&#x27;s length the main frames were apart, with two secondary frames in each bay. Following the precedent set by LZ 120 &quot;Bodensee&quot;, crew and passenger accommodation was in a compartment near the front of the airship that was integrated into the hull structure. Each of the five Maybach VL I V12 engines occupied a separate engine car, arranged as four wing cars with the fifth aft on the centerline of the ship. All drove two-bladed pusher propellers and were capable of running in reverse. Auxiliary power was provided by wind-driven dynamos.

==Operational history==

&quot;Los Angeles&quot; was first flown on 27 August 1924. After completing flight trials, she began the transatlantic delivery flight to the U.S. on 12 October 1924 under the command of Hugo Eckener, arriving at the U.S. Naval Air Station at Lakehurst, New Jersey, after an 81-hour flight of . The airship was commissioned into the U.S. Navy on 25 November 1924 at Naval Support Facility Anacostia at Washington, D.C. with Lieutenant Commander Maurice R. Pierce in command. On her arrival in the United States, her lifting gas was changed from hydrogen to helium, which reduced payload but improved safety. At the same time the airship was fitted with equipment to recover water from the exhaust gases for use as ballast to compensate for the loss of weight as fuel was consumed, so avoiding the necessity to vent scarce helium to maintain neutral buoyancy.

The airship went on to log a total of 4,398 hours of flight, covering a distance of . Long-distance flights included return flights to Panama, Costa Rica and Bermuda. She served as an observatory and experimental platform, as well as a training ship for other airships.

On 24 January 1925, U.S. Naval Observatory and U.S. Bureau of Standards gathered a group of astronomers to observe a total solar eclipse from the airship over the New York City, with Captain Edwin Taylor Pollock as a head of the group. They used &quot;two pairs of telescopic cameras&quot;, to capture inner and outer portions of Sun&#x27;s corona, and a spectrograph. The expedition achieved good publicity, but it was not very successful in its observations - the dirigible was not very stable and the photos were blurred.

On 25 August 1927, while &quot;Los Angeles&quot; was tethered at the Lakehurst high mast, a gust of wind caught her tail and lifted it into colder, denser air that was just above the airship. This caused the tail to lift higher. The crew on board tried to compensate by climbing up the keel toward the rising tail, but could not stop the ship from reaching an angle of 85 degrees, before it descended. The ship suffered only slight damage and was able to fly the next day.

In 1929, &quot;Los Angeles&quot; was used to test the trapeze system developed by the U.S. Navy to launch and recover fixed wing aircraft from rigid airships. The tests were a success and the later purpose-built s were fitted with this system. The temporary system was removed from &quot;Los Angeles&quot;, which never carried any aircraft on operational flights. On 31 January 1930, &quot;Los Angeles&quot; also tested the launching of a glider over Lakehurst, New Jersey.

On 25 May 1932, &quot;Los Angeles&quot; participated in a demonstration of photophone technology. Floating over the General Electric plant in Schenectady, New York, the crew of the ship engaged in an on-air conversation with a WGY radio announcer using a beam of light.

As the terms under which the Allies permitted the United States to have &quot;Los Angeles&quot; restricted her use to commercial and experimental purposes only, when the U.S. Navy wanted to use the airship in a fleet problem in 1931 permission had to be obtained from the Allied Control Commission. &quot;Los Angeles&quot; took part in Fleet Problems XII (1931) and XIII (1932), although as was the case with all U.S. Navy rigid airships, demonstrated no particular benefit to the fleet.
&quot;Los Angeles&quot; was decommissioned in 1932 as an economy measure, but was recommissioned after the crash of in April 1933. She flew for a few more years and then retired to her Lakehurst hangar where she remained until 1939, when the airship was struck off the Navy list and was dismantled in her hangar. &quot;Los Angeles&quot; was the Navy&#x27;s longest-serving rigid airship. Unlike , R38, &quot;Akron&quot;, and , the German-built &quot;Los Angeles&quot; was the only Navy rigid airship which did not meet a disastrous end.

<doc id="443935" wikidata="Q328763" url="?curid=443935" title="Psamtik I">
<text>Wahibre Psamtik I (Ancient Egyptian: ) was the first pharaoh of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt, the Saite period, ruling from the city of Sais in the Nile delta between 664 and 610 BC. He was installed by Ashurbanipal of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, against the Kushite rulers of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty, but later gained more autonomy as the Assyrian Empire declined.

==Name==
The Egyptian name , pronounced as , was a short form of , meaning &quot;the man of Meṯek&quot;, with Meṯek presumably a deity.

His name was rendered by the Assyrians as Pishamilki (), by the Ancient Greeks as (), and by the Romans as .

Psamtik was also called Nabu-shezibanni ( and ), meaning &quot;O Nabu, save me!&quot; by the Assyrians.

== Background ==
In 671 BCE, the Assyrian king Esarhaddon invaded Egypt. This invasion was directed against the Kushite rulers of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt, who had been in control of Upper Egypt, rather than against the native Egyptian rulers. The Assyrians created an administration relying on local Egyptian rulers, and put in place the twelve kinglets who formed a Dodecarchy ruling over the Nile Delta. They also formed alliances with the ruler of the city of Sais, Necho I, who was the most powerful of the Delta kinglets, as well as with Pakruru, the ruler of the important nome of Per-Sopdu.

In 665 BCE, the Kushite king Tantamani invaded Lower Egypt again, and Necho I and Pakruru resisted the Kushite attack. Necho I died in battle and his son Psamtik I fled to Syria, while Pakruru became the spokesperson of the Delta kinglets during the peace negotiations with Tantamani at Memphis.

The next year, in 664 BCE, the Assyrians under Esarhaddon&#x27;s son Ashurbanipal invaded Egypt again, and the Assyrian army retook Memphis, proceeded with the Sack of Thebes, and expelled Tantamani from Egypt. Necho I&#x27;s son Psamtik I returned to Egypt with this invading force, was installed by the Assyrians as the ruler of Sais and Memphis, and concluded with the Assyrians an agreement, some type of superior-inferior relation, but none of the Assyrian sources details the arrangements.

== Reign ==
For the first two years of his reign, Psamtik I ruled in conformity with the arrangement implemented by the Assyrians in Egypt as one of many vassal kinglets of the Egyptian Dodecarchy. According to Herodotus, during this period, Psamtik unwittingly fulfilled a prophecy by an oracle which promised the kingship of all Egypt to whoever poured a libation from a bronze vessel, after which the other kinglets of the Docecarchy chased him from Memphis, of which he lost the rule, and he had to flee into the swamps of the Nile Delta.

After being chased from Memphis, Psamtik I received another similar prophecy from the goddess Wadjet of Buto, who promised him the rule over all Egypt should he employ bronze men from the sea. Beginning in 662 BCE, Psamtik I formed contacts with Gyges, the king of the Anatolian kingdom of Lydia, who sent to Egypt the Ionian Greek and Carian mercenaries that Psamtik I used to reconquer Memphis and defeat the other kinglets of the Dodecarchy, some of whom fled to Libya. Psamtik I might have been also aided in these military campaigns by Arabs from the Sinai Peninsula.

After having eliminated all his rivals, Psamtik I reorganized these mercenaries and placed them in key garrisons at Daphnae in the East and Elephantine in the South to prevent a possible Kushite attack and to control trade. This military aid from Lydia lasted until 658 BCE, at which point Gyges faced an impending Cimmerian invasion. By Psamtik I&#x27;s 4th regnal year, he completed the forging of an alliance with the powerful family of the Masters of Shipping from Heracleopolis, and by his 8th regnal year in 657 BCE, he was in full control of the Delta.

Interpretations of Psamtik I&#x27;s wars as an alliance between Sais and Lydia against Assyria appear to be inaccurate, despite negative attitudes of the Assyrians towards Gyges&#x27;s and Psamtik&#x27;s actions. The Assyrians had risen Sais into preeminence in Egypt after expelling the Saites&#x27; Kushite enemies from the country, but Psamtik I and Ashurbanipal had signed a treaty with each other, and no hostilities between them is recorded. Thus Psamtik I and Ashurbanipal had remained allies ever since the former had been put in power with Assyrian military support. The participation of the Arab tribes of the Sinai, who were Assyrian vassals, further attest to the lack of enmity between Sais and Assyria at this period, and the silence of Assyrian sources concerning Psamtik I&#x27;s expansion imply there was no hostility, whether overt or covert, between Assyria and Sais during Psamtik I&#x27;s unification of Egypt under his rule.

Likewise, Gyges&#x27;s military support of Psamtik I was not directed against Assyria and is not mentioned as hostile to Assyria or allied with other countries against Assyria in Assyrian records; the Assyrian disapproval of Gyges&#x27;s support for Psamtik I was primarily motivated by Gyges&#x27;s refusal to form an alliance with Assyria and his undertaking of these actions independently of Assyria, which the Assyrians interpreted as an act of arrogance, rather than by the support itself. Psamtik I&#x27;s campaigns were not directed against Assyrian power and appear to have been conducted only against the rival kinglets of the Delta, and Ashurbanipal&#x27;s disapproval of his actions were motivated not by his claim of kingship over Egypt, but by his revocation of the agreement between the two kings, as well as by Psamtik I&#x27;s elimination of the other kinglets allied to Assyria, especially Pakruru of Per-Sopdu and Šarru-lū-dāri, since Ashurbanipal was aware that he had to rely on those kinglets to maintain Assyrian power in Egypt.

In Psamtik I&#x27;s 9th regnal year, in 656 BCE, he sent an expedition to the city of Thebes which compelled the existing God&#x27;s Wife of Amun, Shepenupet II, daughter of the former Kushite Pharaoh Piye, to adopt his daughter Nitocris I as her heiress in the so-called Adoption Stela. This was concluded with the approval of the Theban aristocracy and the tacit support of Mentuemhat, who was the Fourth Priest of Amun and the Mayor of Thebes. Psamtik I had unified all of Egypt under his rule.

In 655 and 654 BCE, that is his 10th and 11th regnal years, Psamtik I carried out a war with Libyan tribes who had seized control of the area from the Oxyrhynchite nome around the Bahr Yussef till the Mediterranean Sea, and who had been joined by Psamtik I&#x27;s previously defeated enemies from his wars in the Delta. Following the successful conclusion of this war, Psamtik I placed an Egyptian garrison at Marea to prevent incursions by Libyans from the desert. Thus, by the end of his first decade of rule in 654 BCE, Psamtik I was firmly in control of all Egypt.

According to Herodotus, Psamtik carried out a twenty-nine year siege of Ashdod. The exact dating of this siege is uncertain.

In the later part of Psamtik I&#x27;s reign, the Neo-Assyrian Empire started unravelling following the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC, leaving a power vacuum in the Levant which allowed the Assyrians&#x27; former Scythian vassals to overrun the area. Some time between 623 and 616 BCE, the Scythians reached as far south as Judah and Edom until Psamtik I met them and convinced them to turn back by offering them gifts.

Following the encounter with the Scythians, Psamtik expanded his military operations through the Via Maris into the Levant to support the collapsing Assyrian Empire against the Medes, Babylonians, Scythians and Chaldeans who had revolted against it. Psamtik I&#x27;s intervention implied that an alliance had already been concluded between him and the Neo-Assyrian Empire, although it is unknown whether it was a new alliance between him and the new Assyrian king Sin-shar-ishkun or a renewal of the old alliance signed when Psamtik I had been enthroned by the Assyrian army as king of Sais in 664 BCE.

Stela dated to Year 51 of Psammetikhos I, dedicated by Paderpsu. Berlin 8348 (lost).

Psamtik died in 610 BCE and was succeeded by his son, Necho II.

== Investigation into the origin of language ==

The Greek historian Herodotus conveyed an anecdote about Psamtik in the second volume of his &quot;Histories&quot; (2.2). During his visit to Egypt, Herodotus heard that Psammetichus (&quot;Psamṯik&quot;) sought to discover the origin of language by conducting an experiment with two children. Allegedly he gave two newborn babies to a shepherd, with the instructions that no one should speak to them, but that the shepherd should feed and care for them while listening to determine their first words. The hypothesis was that the first word would be uttered in the root language of all people. When one of the children cried &quot;βεκός&quot; (bekós) with outstretched arms, the shepherd reported this to Psammetichus, who concluded that the word was Phrygian because that was the sound of the Phrygian word for &quot;bread&quot;. Thus, they concluded that the Phrygians were an older people than the Egyptians, and that Phrygian was the original language of men. There are no other extant sources to verify this story.

== Wives ==

Psamtik&#x27;s chief wife was Mehytenweskhet, the daughter of Harsiese, the vizier of the North and High Priest of Re at Heliopolis. Psamtik and Mehytenweskhet were the parents of Necho II, Merneith, and the Divine Adoratrice Nitocris I.

Psamtik&#x27;s father-in-law—the aforementioned Harsiese—was married twice: to Sheta, with whom he had a daughter named Naneferheres, and to an unknown woman, by whom he had both Djedkare, who succeeded him as vizier of the North, and Mehytenweskhet.

==Discovery of a colossal statue==

On 9 March 2017, Egyptian and German archaeologists discovered a colossal statue about in height at the Heliopolis site in Cairo. Made of quartzite, the statue was found in a fragmentary state, with the bust, the lower part of the head and the crown submerged in groundwater.

While the statue was initially speculated to be of Ramesses II, it was later been confirmed to be of Psamtik I due to engravings found that mentioned one of Psamtik&#x27;s names on the base of the statue. A spokesperson at the time commented that &quot;If it does belong to this king, then it is the largest statue of the Late Period that was ever discovered in Egypt.&quot; The head and torso are expected to be moved to the Grand Egyptian Museum.

The statue was sculpted in the ancient classical style of 2000 BC, establishing a resurgence to the greatness and prosperity of the classical period, and reconstructions bear a strong similarity with a statue of a striding Senusret I (1971–1926 BC), now in the Cairo Museum. However, from the many fragments of quartzite collected (now 6,400 of them), it has been established that the colossus was at some time deliberately destroyed. Certain discolored and cracked rock fragments show evidence of having been heated to high temperatures then shattered (with cold water), a typical way of destroying ancient colossi.

<doc id="443940" wikidata="Q1422687" url="?curid=443940" title="Genesee River">
<text>The Genesee River ( ) is a tributary of Lake Ontario flowing northward through the Twin Tiers of Pennsylvania and New York in the United States. The river contains several waterfalls in New York at Letchworth State Park and Rochester. 

The river was historically used as a border between the lands of the Seneca to the east and the Erie and Wenro to the west. Later, the river provided the original power for the Rochester area&#x27;s 19th century mills, and still provides hydroelectric power for downtown Rochester. Flooding occurred periodically in the river valley before construction of the Mount Morris Dam in the 1950s.

==Geology==

The Genesee is the remaining western branch of a preglacial system, with rock layers tilted an average of 40 feet (12 m) per mile, so the river flows across progressively older bedrock as it flows northward. It begins in exposing the Allegheny Plateau&#x27;s characteristic conglomerates: sandstones and shales in the of the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian subperiods. Thereafter, farther downstream as it traverses the area known as &quot;The Grand Canyon of the East&quot;, where it falls (three times) through over 600 feet (180 m). As it passes through the gorges in New York&#x27;s Letchworth State Park, the river also often exposes older rocks such as shales (some rich in hydrocarbons), siltstones and some limestones of the Devonian period at Letchworth and, at other canyons with three more waterfalls at Rochester cuts through the Niagara Escarpment, exposing limestones and shales of Silurian age in the rock column. With cuttings in the geologic record showing so many early ages, the river area has a great variety of fossils for paleobiological and stratigraphic analysis.

During the past million years, four glacial ages covered the Rochester area. The southern edges of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and those advances impacted the formation geology and geography of the area. The most recent glacier that left evidence here was about 10,000 years ago and it caused compression of the earth by as much as 2,500 feet (760 m). About 12,000 years ago, the area underwent massive changes, which included the rerouting of the Genesee and other water bodies. The pre-ice age eastern branch of the Genesee runs south of Mount Morris and was completely diverted by extensive terminal moraines in Livingston County with a key blocking dam just south of Dansville, so most of the upper section of the ancient river was diverted instead to fall the off Appalachian Plateau toward the Susquehanna River system (to an eventual destination well to the southeast).

Only a small creek (Irondequoit Creek) flows in what is left of this large paleogeologic valley. The area of the lower river was also affected. Since the earth rebounded from the melting glaciers more rapidly in Canada than in New York, water from Lake Ontario was spilled over New York due to its lower elevation. During this time, the original outlet of the Genesee River, Irondequoit Bay, was flooded out, creating the current bay. As these waters later retreated, glacial debris caused the river to be rerouted to the west along its current path.

==History==
The Seneca nation traditionally lived between the Genesee River and Canandaigua Lake. The region was surveyed by Thomas Davies in 1766. The High Falls was then also known as the Great Seneca Falls, and the Genesee River was also spelled Zinochsaa by early writers.

Historically, the river&#x27;s gorge formed a clearly demarcated border between the lands of the Five Nations of the Iroquois, whose range extended east and the related tribes of the Erie people and Wenro along the west side of the gorge. By the end of the Beaver Wars and the American Revolution, the lands in all of upstate New York into the Ohio Country were controlled by the Iroquois Confederation, but were also effectively depopulated, the tribes weakened in the Revolution. In 1779, on the orders of George Washington, the Sullivan Expedition destroyed over 40 Haudenosaunee villages in and around the watershed to force the Seneca and allied nations out of the newly formed United States. Subsequently, with most Iroquois having fled to Canada, the remnant tribal groups were in no position to further impede white settlers, so most of New York state west of the Genesee River became part of the Holland Purchase after the American Revolution. From 1801 to 1846 the entire region was sold to individual owners from the Holland Land office in Batavia, New York. In the 1797 Treaty of Big Tree, the Seneca tribes were granted six reservations along the river, among them Canawaugus, Little Beard&#x27;s Town, Geneseo, Caneadea, Deyuitgau and Gardeau. In August 1826, the Ogden Land Company purchased the six Genesee River reservations from the Seneca, allegedly under duress; the modern Seneca Nation of Indians does not recognize the 1826 sale as valid and moved to reclaim Canawaugus in December 2022.

On Friday, November 13, 1829 (Friday the 13th), the daredevil Sam Patch jumped to his death before 8,000 spectators at the Upper Falls in Rochester.

If &quot;not for hydropower, the flour mills, clothing mills, and tool fabricators would not have located in Rochester&quot;, and the 1825 Erie Canal allowed the mills to ship products to New York City. A few hundred feet north of the center of the village of Rochester, the Erie Canal crossed the Genesee River via an 1823 stone aqueduct (802 feet (244 m) long, 17 feet (5.2 m) wide), which was replaced by the Second Genesee Aqueduct in 1842.

In 1836 the Genesee Valley Canal was begun to build a new canal from the Erie Canal near Rochester, up the Genesee Valley, across to the Allegheny River at Olean. Construction of new sections extended upriver (southward) until 1880. Although an important commercial route, the canal was plagued by frequent flood damage and the final leg down the Allegany River was never completed. The most difficult section to build was the bypass around the gorge and falls at present day Letchworth Park. The canal followed the old Native American portage route, which necessitated many locks. These old locks can still be seen near Nunda. The project was abandoned, and the right of way was sold in 1880. The property became the roadbed for the Genesee Valley Canal Railroad, which eventually merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad. Much of the canal and railroad right-of-way is open to the public today as the Genesee Valley Greenway, which was started in 1991.

In 1852 a wooden railroad bridge was built over the Upper Falls at Portageville. It was the largest of all wooden bridges built at the time. The wood from 300 acres (1.2 km²) of trees was required for its timber. In the &quot;summer of 1943&quot;, Arch Merrill walked the length of the Genesee River.

Serial killer Arthur Shawcross dumped most of his victims in or near the river, leading to him being nicknamed &quot;The Genesee River Killer&quot;.

===Floods===
A March 1865 thaw was the worst Genesee flood in Rochester history, and a similar 1913 flood motivated the excavation of the Genesee&#x27;s rock bed in Downtown Rochester. The 1972 Hurricane Agnes flood broke all county historical records, with the most concentrated damage in the Wellsville area. The water from Hurricane Agnes caused the only instance where the river&#x27;s flow exceeded the storage capacity of the reservoir of the Mount Morris Dam, the largest flood control dam east of the Mississippi, and water had to be released from the dam to prevent overtopping of the spillway.

<text>Psamtik II (Ancient Egyptian: , pronounced ), known by the Graeco-Romans as Psammetichus or Psammeticus, was a king of the Saite-based Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt (595 BC – 589 BC). His prenomen, Nefer-Ib-Re, means &quot;Beautiful [is the] Heart [of] Re.&quot; He was the son of Necho II.

==Campaigns and battles==
Psamtik II led a foray into Nubia in 592 BC, marching as far south as the Third or even the Fourth Cataract of the Nile, according to a contemporary stela from Thebes (Karnak), which dates to Year 3 of this king&#x27;s name and refers to a heavy defeat that was inflicted upon the kingdom of Kush. A well-known graffito inscribed in Greek on the left leg of the colossal seated statue of Ramesses II, on the south side of the entrance to the temple of Abu Simbel, records that:

 Kerkis was located near the Fifth Cataract of the Nile &quot;which stood well within the Cushite Kingdom.&quot;

This was the first confrontation between Egypt and Nubia since the reign of Tantamani. A Kushite king named Anlamani had revived the power of the kingdom of Napata. Psamtik II&#x27;s campaign was likely initiated to destroy any future aspirations the Kushites may have had to reconquer Egypt. The Egyptian army advanced to Pnubs (Kerma) and the capital city of Napata in a series of fierce battles, where they looted its temples and destroyed the royal Kushite statues. The Kushite capital was sacked under the reign of the native Kushite king Aspelta who was the younger brother of Anlamani and the son of Senkamanisken. The Year 3 Karnak stela is dated to II Shemu day 10 of Psamtik II&#x27;s reign and states that:
As a result of Psamtik&#x27;s devastating campaign, Kush&#x27;s power was crushed, and its kings from Aspelta onwards lost any opportunity of ever regaining control of Egypt. Instead, the Nubian rulers decided to shift their capital further south from Napata to the relative safety of Meroë. Curiously, however, Psamtik II does not appear to have capitalized on his victory. His troops retreated back to the First Cataract, and Elephantine continued to be the southern border of Egypt.

An outcome of this campaign was the deliberate destruction of monuments belonging to the 25th Dynasty Kushite kings in Egypt &quot;by hacking out their names and the emblems of royalty from their statues and reliefs.&quot; Later, in 591 BC, during the fourth year of his reign, Psamtik II launched an expedition into Palestine &quot;to foment a general Levantine revolt against the Babylonians&quot; that involved, among others, Zedekiah of the Kingdom of Judah. Or according to Dan’el Kahn, &quot;592 B.C. seems to be the date of the military reconquest of the Levant by Psammetichus II.&quot;

==Monuments==
Psamtik II was both a dynamic warrior pharaoh as well as a prolific builder in his brief 6-year reign. A significant Saite temple was likely built by Psamtik II and his son Apries at the village of El-Mahalla El-Kubra which lies equidistant from Sebennytos and Behbeit El-Hagar in the Lower Nile Delta. Officials from the Napoleonic expedition to Egypt observed &quot;an extraordinary number of pharaonic building elements of granite and turquoise reused in modern buildings&quot; at this site; this discovery was subsequently confirmed by Nestor L&#x27;Hôte in 1828 who counted more than 120 granite columns built into this village&#x27;s mosque alone. A 1.8 metre long fragment of red granite with the name of Psamtik II and a door lintel of Apries was also seen at El-Mahalla El-Kubra.

Under Psamtik II&#x27;s reign, a pair of obelisks more than 21.79 metres high were erected in the temple of Heliopolis; the first Emperor of Rome, Augustus, later had one of the obelisks, today known as the Obelisk of Montecitorio, which had probably been thrown down by the Persian invaders in 525 BC, brought to Rome in 10 BC.
Psamtik II also constructed a kiosk on Philae island. This kiosk today &quot;represents the oldest known monument known on the island&quot; and consisted &quot;of a double row of four columns, which were connected by screen walls.&quot;


Psamtik II was also responsible for founding the Temple-house at Hibis in El-Kharga Oasis for the triad of Amun, Mut, and Khonsu with significant installations for the cult of Osiris. This 19.5 x 26 metre temple was originally situated on the bank of an ancient lake which has now disappeared and its temple decorations were only completed under the Persian kings Darius I and possibly Darius II. The Hibis temple consisted of a hypostyle hall with two-by-two papyrus capital columns, a hall of offerings, three sanctuaries in the rear section of the temple and a chapel at the side of the sanctuaries for the cult of Psamtik II. The front of the temple house of Hibis featured:
: &quot;a pronaos with four papyrus bundle columns and screen walls. During the construction of the pronaos, the side walls were extended for the addition of a court[yard]. This extension, was, however, only carried out in the 30th Dynasty [by Nectanebo I and Nectanebo II.] The eight papyrus columns of the pronaos still show the New Kingdom type of open, bell-shaped capitals.&quot;
A massive sandstone gateway through an outer enclosure wall still stands almost 5 metres tall and was constructed during the Ptolemaic or Roman periods. Many inscriptions and decrees were carved on the gateway on a wide variety of topics such as taxation, inheritance, the court system and the rights of women, with the earliest text dating to 49 AD.

The Temple of Psamtik II at Hibis was completely preserved until 1832 when its roof and portions of the temple were removed for the construction of an aluminium factory. Only excavation work by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1910-1911 and restorations performed by the Egyptian Antiquities Service arrested its decline. Today, the Hibis temple remains—together with the Oracle or Ammoneion of Siwa—as &quot;the best preserved and best-documented temple of the early Egyptian Late Period and is therefore a primary monument to the history of [Egyptian temple] building.&quot;

==Successor==

When Psamtik II died in 589 BC, he was succeeded by Apries who was his son by Queen Takhut, a Princess of Athribis. Psamtik and Queen Takhut were also the parents of Menekhubaste, a Priestess of Atum at Heliopolis, and Ankhnesneferibre, a God&#x27;s Wife of Amun who served in this powerful office in Upper Egypt to the end of the Saite period in 525 BC, when Egypt was conquered by the Persians. The date of Psamtik II&#x27;s death is mentioned in the Adoption stela of Ankhnesneferibre: Year 7, I Akhet day 23.

<text>The San Gabriel Valley (), often referred to by its initials as SGV, is one of the principal valleys of Southern California, with the city of Los Angeles directly bordering it to the west, and occupying the vast majority of the southeastern part of Los Angeles County. Surrounding landforms and other features include the following:

* the San Gabriel Mountains to the north;
* the San Rafael Hills to the west, with the Los Angeles Basin beyond;
* the Crescenta Valley to the northwest;
* the Puente Hills to the south, with the coastal plain of Orange County beyond;
* the Chino Hills and San Jose Hills to the east, with the Pomona Valley and Inland Empire beyond; and
* the city limits of Los Angeles, bordering its western edge.

The San Gabriel Valley derives its name from the San Gabriel River that flows southward through the center of the valley, which itself was named for the Spanish Mission San Gabriel Arcángel originally built in the Whittier Narrows in 1771.

Once predominantly agricultural, the San Gabriel Valley today is almost entirely urbanized and is an integral part of the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. It is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in the country. Covering about in area, the valley includes 31 cities and five unincorporated communities. It is located entirely within Los Angeles County.

Pasadena is the largest city in the San Gabriel Valley. Pasadena was incorporated in 1886, making it the fourth city incorporated in Los Angeles County, following Los Angeles, Santa Ana, and Anaheim (Santa Ana and Anaheim are both now located in Orange County, which broke off in 1889). More recently, statewide droughts have further strained the San Gabriel Valley&#x27;s and Los Angeles County&#x27;s water security.

== Cities and communities ==
The incorporated cities and unincorporated neighborhoods of the San Gabriel Valley include:
* Alhambra
* Altadena
* Arcadia
* Avocado Heights
* Azusa
* Baldwin Park
* Bassett
* Bradbury
* Claremont
* Charter Oak
* Citrus
* City of Industry
* Covina
* Diamond Bar
* Duarte
* East Los Angeles
* East Pasadena
* El Monte
* Glendora
* Hacienda Heights
* Irwindale
* La Cañada Flintridge
* La Puente
* La Verne
* Mayflower Village
* Monrovia
* Montebello (northern portion)
* Monterey Park
* North El Monte
* Pasadena
* Pomona
* Ramona
* Rosemead
* Rowland Heights
* Rose Hills
* San Dimas
* San Gabriel

* San Pasqual
* Sierra Madre
* South El Monte
* South Pasadena
* South San Gabriel
* South San Jose Hills
* Temple City
* Valinda
* Vincent
* Walnut
* West Covina
* West Puente Valley


Whittier, like Montebello, is considered a part of the Gateway Cities region. An unincorporated portion of Whittier, Rose Hills, sits below the Puente Hills. While Montebello is considered to be part of the Gateway Cities region, the northern portion of Montebello is part of the San Gabriel Valley.

Claremont, La Verne, and Pomona are adjacent to the San Gabriel Valley, and though they are properly considered part of the Pomona Valley, they are also commonly considered part of the San Gabriel Valley. The 57 Freeway (Orange Freeway) is generally considered the dividing line between the Pomona and San Gabriel valleys. However, for statistical and economic development purposes, the County of Los Angeles generally includes these three cities as part of the San Gabriel Valley. The community of El Sereno, in the city of Los Angeles, is situated at the westernmost edge of the Valley. Unofficial estimates place the combined population of the San Gabriel Valley at around 2 million—roughly a fifth of the population of Los Angeles County.

==Early history==

Before the arrival of the Spaniards, the land along the Rio Hondo River, a branch of the San Gabriel River, was populated by the Tongva people. The Tongva occupied much of the Los Angeles basin and the islands of Santa Catalina, San Nicolas, San Clemente and Santa Barbara. In the northern part of the valley were the Hahanog-na Indian tribe, a branch of the Tongva Nation (part of the Shoshone language group) who lived in villages scattered along the Arroyo Seco and the canyons from the mountains down to the South Pasadena area. In 1542, when the explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo arrived off the shores of San Pedro and Santa Catalina. The Tongva were the people who rowed the remarkable Ti&#x27;ats (plank canoes) out to meet Cabrilho. The language of the Tongva was different from the neighboring Indian tribes and it was called Gabrielino by the Spanish. The Tongva also provide the origin of many current names; Piwongna – Pomona, Cucomog-na – Cucamonga. The Gabrielinos lived in dome-like structures with thatched exteriors. Both sexes wore long hair styles and tattooed their bodies. During warm weather the men wore little clothing, but the women would wear minimal skirts made of animal hides. During the cold weather they would wear animal skin capes. European diseases killed many of the Tongva and by 1870 the area had few remaining native inhabitants. Today, several bands of Tongva people live in the Los Angeles area.

The first Europeans to see inland areas of California were the members of the 1769 Portolà expedition, which traveled north by land after establishing the first Spanish settlement in today&#x27;s state of California at San Diego. On July 30, the expedition crossed the San Gabriel River and continued north toward what is now the city of Los Angeles. To cross the river, the expedition built a rough bridge, which gave the name &quot;La Puente&quot; to today&#x27;s San Gabriel Valley city, and hills to the south are called the Puente Hills. A few years later, a mission was established near the river crossing.

Mission San Gabriel Arcangel was founded by Franciscan Father Junipero Serra, first head of the Spanish missions in California, on September 8, 1771. Its original location, called Mission Vieja, was near where San Gabriel Boulevard now crosses the Rio Hondo, which is also near the present day Juan Matias Sanchez Adobe. Angel Somera and Pedro Cambon were the first missionary priests at the new mission, which marked the beginning of the Los Angeles region&#x27;s settlement by Spaniards. The San Gabriel mission was the third of twenty-one missions that would ultimately be established along California&#x27;s El Camino Real.

The San Gabriel mission did well in establishing cattle ranching and farming, but six years after its founding a destructive flood led the mission fathers to relocate the establishment to its current location farther north in present-day city of San Gabriel. The original mission site is now marked by a California Historical Landmark.

During the early years of the mission, the region operated under a Rancho system. The lands which now compose the city of Montebello were originally parts of Rancho San Antonio, Rancho La Merced, and Rancho Paso de Bartolo. The Juan Matias Sanchez Adobe, built in 1844, remains standing at the center of old Rancho La Merced in Eastern Montebello in the La Merced area. Recently restored, it is the city&#x27;s oldest structure.

Mission San Gabriel Arcángel served a central role in Spanish colonial society, with many of the area&#x27;s first Mexican settlers being baptized at the mission, including Pio Pico, who was born and baptized at the mission in 1801. He became governor of California twice, in 1832 and in 1845 and the city of Pico Rivera was named honoring him as the last Mexican governor of California.

The Battle of Rio San Gabriel took place in Montebello on January 8, 1847, on the banks of the Rio Hondo. This battle gave the control of Los Angeles and Alta California to the United States, and was a decisive battle in the Mexican-American War. Two days later, after several battle losses and defeats, Mexico was forced to cede Alta California to the United States. By 1852, after American occupation, San Gabriel became one of the first townships in the County of Los Angeles. Today the battle site is California State Historical Landmark #385, and there are two old cannons and a plaque commemorating the battle overlooking the river on Bluff Rd. and Washington Blvd.

In 1853, with a contingent of Army Engineers passing through searching for the best route to build a railroad, Geologist William P. Blake observed that the once-extensive vineyards were falling to decay, with fences broken down and animals roaming freely through it. But the bells were ringing, and the church was in use. Prophetically, he wrote, &quot;I believe that when the adaptation of that portion of California to the culture of the grape and the manufacture of wine becomes known and appreciated, the state will become celebrated not only for its gold and grain, but for it fruits and wines.

Following the American Civil War, some 5,000 acres (20 km2) of the East Los Angeles region were owned by an Italian settler from Genoa, Alessandro Repetto. After Repetto&#x27;s death in 1885, his brother sold his rancho to a consortium of five Los Angeles businessmen including banker Isaias Hellman and wholesale grocer/historian Harris Newmark for $60,000, about $12 an acre.

Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and South Asian pioneers and settlers first came to the San Gabriel Valley in the mid-19th century. These pioneers worked the fields, picked the grapes and citrus fruit, and built part the infrastructure of today&#x27;s San Gabriel Valley. In the 1920s Japanese immigrants arrived in Monterey Park to work as farmhands.

The discovery of oil by Standard Oil Company in the Montebello hills, in 1917, brought about a revolutionary change to the locality. The agricultural hills soon became a major contributor to oil production. By 1920, its oil fields were producing one-eighth of California&#x27;s crude oil. For several decades, the hills were dotted with active oil wells.

The cities of Whittier, Covina and Pasadena were formerly the sites of the citrus industry. In addition, the oil, dairy and cattle industries used to flourish in the southern region of the SGV. Many equestrian trails in the San Gabriel Valley—specifically, in Covina and Walnut—have disappeared or fallen into disuse. The remaining rural countryside-like areas include the area between eastern West Covina and Cal Poly Pomona and in Walnut and Diamond Bar and La Puente.

== Demographics and ethnic diversity ==
The total population of the San Gabriel Valley in the 2000 Census was 1,510,378 people, of which 1,425,596 were living in the 30 incorporated cities. The average size of a household in the San Gabriel Valley according to the 2000 Census was 3.28 persons compared with 2.98 persons for Los Angeles County as a whole. Eight cities in the Valley have average household sizes of over four persons, while an unincorporated area, the South San Jose Hills, was at a significant 5.07 persons per household. (Most addresses do not use South San Jose Hills as the city but use La Puente, West Covina, or Valinda.) At the other end of this scale is Sierra Madre, at 2.20 persons per household.

The age distribution in the San Gabriel Valley was a little unusual when compared with the county. A larger share of the population was aged 10–19, 15.5% versus 14.8% for the county. Also, the Valley had a higher share of people over 45 years of age. The income ranges in the San Gabriel Valley area are also quite wide. The highest median household income was found in San Marino ($117,267), followed by Bradbury ($100,454). At the other end of the scale was El Monte with a median household income of $32,439. Four other cities in the Valley had household incomes of less than $40,000.

Significant percentages of all major ethnic groups reside in San Gabriel Valley communities, and the area is in general one of the most ethnically diverse regions in the country. The largest groups residing in the San Gabriel Valley are those of Hispanic and Asian-American origin. The communities of Glendora, La Verne, Claremont, Monrovia, Sierra Madre, Pasadena, South Pasadena, and San Dimas have significant White populations.

The Gabrieleno/Tongva of San Gabriel are headquartered in San Gabriel. A small Native American population is also located in Arcadia, Rowland Heights, Walnut, and Diamond Bar. Despite the European influx they remained an integral part of the Southern California community, and continue to in the present day.

The African-American population in the San Gabriel Valley is relatively low. However, there are sizable, long-established African-American communities in the western Altadena area and in northwest Pasadena, as well as in Monrovia.

Montebello is home to the oldest Armenian community in Los Angeles County. It contains Holy Cross Armenian Apostolic Cathedral, which was the only Armenian cathedral in California until Saint Leon Cathedral was built in Burbank in 2012. The Armenian Martyrs Monument at Bicknell Park commemorating the victims of the Armenian Genocide by the Ottoman Turks is the largest monument of the genocide found on public property in the world. The Armenian community of Pasadena has its roots in the 1890s. The Pashgian Bros. Oriental Rugs and Fine Carpets was established in 1889.

Hispanic residents, predominately Mexican Americans, are concentrated in Alhambra, Baldwin Park, City of Industry, El Monte, Hacienda Heights, La Puente, Montebello, Rosemead, San Gabriel, South El Monte, West Covina, Covina, Pomona, and Whittier, with significant populations in Pasadena and South Pasadena.

=== Asian-American population ===

The San Gabriel Valley has the largest concentration of East Asian American communities in the United States, located primarily in the southwestern part of the San Gabriel Valley. Eight of the ten cities in the United States with the largest proportion of Chinese Americans are located in the San Gabriel Valley. The cities and communities of Monterey Park, Walnut, Alhambra, San Gabriel, San Marino, Rowland Heights, Hacienda Heights, Diamond Bar, and Arcadia form a large Asian-American community.

There are many Filipino Americans in the communities of West Covina and Walnut. Vietnamese Americans tend to be concentrated in San Gabriel, Rosemead, and El Monte. Many Korean Americans live in Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights, and Diamond Bar. A longstanding Japanese-American community exists in Monterey Park.

Early Chinese pioneers settled into the Valley mostly as laborers. They packed oranges, picked walnuts, did construction, owned or worked in laundries, and worked as cooks and servants in the homes of the wealthy. Mostly a bachelor society (especially after the Page Act of 1875 banned Chinese women), the early Chinese did not leave many descendants. By the late 1880s, there was a growing Japanese pioneer population. Filipinos and Asian Indians also served as laborers in the valley. Immigration of Chinese laborers was banned by the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act until 1943.

Almost a century later, the San Gabriel Valley&#x27;s burgeoning population of Asian Americans has become a dominant cultural force. Several business districts developed to serve their needs creating a collection of Southern California Chinatowns loosely connected along the Valley Boulevard Corridor. This trend began in the city of Monterey Park during the late 1970s when many well-to-do Taiwanese professionals began settling in the area. Initially, many Chinese restaurateurs and business owners used primarily Traditional Chinese script and not English names on their business signs. This changed in 1986, when the city council of Monterey Park enacted an ordinance requiring all businesses to translate their business signs and describe the nature of their businesses in English, deemed a matter of public safety.

Monterey Park is a microcosm of changing demographics, highlighting Asian American history and evolution in the San Gabriel Valley. Rosemead has a smaller group of Vietnamese and Chinese business districts. There are also small pockets of Chinese American businesses that are scattered throughout San Gabriel Valley cities. In Rowland Heights, a handful of Korean American strip malls co-exist with Chinese American businesses. Another ethnic enclave is the Filipino American business district of &quot;Little Manila&quot;, in West Covina along with an Asian indoor and outdoor shopping center. Small Chinatowns have sprung up in many cities throughout the valley.

By the 2010 census there were more than half a million Asian Americans living in San Gabriel Valley. While smaller than the Latino population in the valley, it outnumbered the White population, and had a faster growth rate. More than a quarter of the population in the region are Asian American. The largest populations of Asian Americans in San Gabriel Valley were Chinese, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Korean, Taiwanese, and Japanese.

Burmese Americans are concentrated in Alhambra.

==Arts and culture==

The San Gabriel Valley is home to the annual Tournament of Roses Parade, which is broadcast live on television on New Year&#x27;s Day from Pasadena. After the parade, the Rose Bowl game between two rival college football teams is also televised live.

As the oldest incorporated community in the valley, the City of Pasadena serves as a cultural center for the San Gabriel Valley. Several art-house film and play theatres are located in Pasadena, including the Pasadena Playhouse. In addition, the local news/talk National Public Radio station KPCC 89.3 FM broadcasts from Pasadena City College, although it is operated by Minnesota Public Radio.

Old Pasadena, which has been restored and rejuvenated, remains highly popular. Old Pasadena has an active nightlife, a shopping mall, boutiques, outdoor cafés, nightclubs, comedy clubs, and varied restaurants. Other communities hope to emulate its successes through commercial redevelopment and reviving their own downtown areas or &quot;Main Streets&quot;.

The city of Azusa has attempted to encourage redevelopment of its once-dilapidated downtown section by using a &quot;Route 66&quot; theme. Covina has had moderate success with its nostalgic Downtown Covina, with emphasis placed on a small-town America atmosphere and mom-and-pop merchants rather than big-box retail chains; Monrovia has also embraced this theme for their &quot;Old Town.&quot; Alhambra has also worked to renovate its downtown along Main St. San Gabriel Mission is the center of Historical Culture in SGV.

The California Institute of Technology, Caltech, is located in Pasadena. The university is ranked in the top 10 universities worldwide by metrics such as citation index, Nobel Prizes, and general university rankings. Caltech is also responsible for the well-known Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which designs and engineers many of NASA&#x27;s spacecraft.

The city of Baldwin Park is the birthplace of the popular hamburger fast food chain In-N-Out Burger. Its first location opened in the city in 1948.

Huy Fong&#x27;s Sriracha sauce, the ubiquitous Sriracha sauce found at Vietnamese restaurants across the western world, manufactures and is headquartered in Irwindale.

Naked Juice, now a division of PepsiCo, is headquartered in Monrovia.

Panda Express was launched as a fast food version of the Panda Inn restaurant in Pasadena in 1983. The company&#x27;s headquarters are in Rosemead.

Trader Joe&#x27;s opened its first location in Pasadena in 1967. The company&#x27;s headquarters are now in Monrovia.

== Politics and government ==

Most cities have their own local mayor, city council, police and fire departments. Unincorporated areas such as Hacienda Heights and Rowland Heights are governed by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department has jurisdiction in these areas.

In many unincorporated areas, advisory town councils guide the decisions, made by a supervisor or city manager. Often these groups began as collaborations of local homeowner associations. The Hacienda Heights Improvement Association, Rowland Heights Coordinating Council, and Altadena Town Council are examples of advisory bodies that are officially sanctioned by the county supervisor representing that community.

In 2003, voters in the unincorporated community of Hacienda Heights defeated a proposal to incorporate as a city. It remains an unincorporated district governed by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors rather than by a locally elected mayor and city council.

== Transportation ==

Foothill Transit and the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority provide bus transit services throughout the valley. El Monte Station, a large regional bus station, provides transportation to Union Station in downtown Los Angeles via the El Monte Busway, an shared-use bus corridor (transitway). The Metrolink San Bernardino Line commuter train runs westward to Downtown Los Angeles and eastward to San Bernardino through the valley. Most of the public transit via bus in the valley is provided by Foothill Transit.

On March 5, 2016, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority opened the Metro Gold Line Foothill Extension, expanding the current light rail service that previously traveled from East LA to Pasadena through Downtown LA to a new Northern terminus in Azusa. It has since been taken over by the A Line, which goes down through Downtown Los Angeles to Long Beach, and is also the longest light rail line in the world.

Several cities provide their own in-city transportation shuttles. Cities known to provide such service are:

* Alhambra
* Arcadia
* Baldwin Park
* Duarte
* Glendora
* La Puente
* Monrovia
* Montebello
* Monterey Park
* Pasadena
* Temple City
* West Covina

The San Gabriel Valley is served by several major freeways:

* the Foothill Freeway (Interstate 210 (California) and State Route 210)
* the Ventura Freeway (State Route 134)
* the San Bernardino Freeway (Interstate 10)
* the Pomona Freeway (State Route 60)
* the Pasadena Freeway (State Route 110)
* the Long Beach Freeway (Interstate 710)
* the San Gabriel River Freeway (Interstate 605)
* the Orange Freeway (State Route 57)

I-710 ends abruptly at the western border of Alhambra, near California State University, Los Angeles, with an unsigned spur of I-710 starting again in Pasadena at California Boulevard and ending at the junction of I-210 and SR 134. Efforts to complete the freeway were met with fierce opposition, including the possibility of using advanced tunneling technologies to overcome objections by South Pasadena. The gap will no longer be constructed, and both Pasadena and Alhambra are exploring options on the future of their respective spurs.

At the eastern end of the San Gabriel Valley, the eastern freeway segment of SR 210 (formerly designated SR 30 and still signed as such in some places in San Bernardino County) between SR 57 and I-15 had been a source of similar contention in the bordering community of La Verne, but was finally constructed and added to the Foothill Freeway in 2002.

State Route 39 leads north into the San Gabriel Mountains to the Crystal Lake Recreation Area. The portion connecting the recreation area to the Angeles Crest Highway (State Route 2) has been closed to the public since the early 1970s due to massive damage and rockslides.

General aviation is served by San Gabriel Valley Airport (EMT) in El Monte, and Brackett Field (POC) in Pomona. Commercial aviation is served by the five major Southern California airports: Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Hollywood Burbank Airport (BUR), Ontario International Airport (ONT), Long Beach Airport (LGB), and John Wayne Airport (SNA).

== Media ==
The local daily English-language newspapers are the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, which includes a real estate and automotive advertising section for the San Gabriel Valley/Inland Empire, the &quot;San Gabriel Valley Tribune&quot;, and the &quot;Pasadena Star-News&quot;, which operates from its Monrovia office. The &quot;Pasadena Star-News&quot; covers the Pasadena/Arcadia area and the &quot;Tribune&quot; covers the central and eastern San Gabriel Valley communities. Business news is covered by the &quot;San Gabriel Valley Business Journal&quot;.

Other San Gabriel Valley-wide publications include the weekly &quot;Mountain Views News&quot;, &quot;San Gabriel Valley NOW&quot;, and the &quot;San Gabriel Valley Examiner&quot; that serve the foothill communities, the &quot;Mid Valley News&quot; which serves the central San Gabriel Valley, and the Beacon Media weekly newspaper chain, whose weekly newspapers cover several San Gabriel Valley cities. The &quot;South Pasadena Review&quot; serves South Pasadena and the &quot;San Marino Tribune&quot; serves San Marino. Additionally, the cities of Alhambra, Glendora, Azusa, San Dimas and La Verne have monthly community newspapers that are published on the first Friday of every month. These papers include &quot;Around Alhambra&quot;, the &quot;Glendora Community News&quot;, &quot;Azusa Community News&quot;, &quot;San Dimas Community News&quot; and the &quot;La Verne Community News&quot;, all distributed directly to each mailing address. The &quot;Alhambra Source&quot; is a USC Annenberg–backed community news site founded in 2010. The site is based on research into local information need, and includes a multilingual cadre of volunteer and young adult contributors. It is published online every weekday and includes select content in Spanish and Chinese as well as English. In the eastern part of the valley, Claremont has its own community newspaper called the Claremont Courier.

Several large newspaper publishing companies serve the large Chinese-speaking readership in the Greater Los Angeles Area; a number of them are based in the San Gabriel Valley. The national daily Chinese-language newspapers &quot;Chinese Daily News&quot; (Los Angeles edition of the &quot;World Journal&quot; newspaper) and &quot;International Daily News&quot; are both printed in Monterey Park. The Los Angeles edition of the Hong Kong–based &quot;Sing Tao&quot; is printed in Alhambra and the newspaper is specifically tailored to the Cantonese-speaking readership. &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; (大纪元) is based in New York City and has its Los Angeles office in San Gabriel. These newspapers are circulated and distributed throughout Chinese American communities in the San Gabriel Valley, Chinatown, San Diego, and in Las Vegas, Nevada (where the latter two cities generally receive the Los Angeles editions due to a relatively lower population density of Chinese-speaking Americans).

== In popular culture ==

Many films have been filmed on location in the San Gabriel Valley. Chantry Flats above Arcadia is featured as the landing site of aliens in the original film &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;. South Pasadena and Alhambra served as the gloomy backgrounds of a fictional Illinois town of Haddonfield in John Carpenter&#x27;s 1978 horror film &quot;Halloween&quot;. Some areas of Pasadena and South Pasadena have a distinctly Midwestern look. Pasadena&#x27;s distinctive domed City Hall has doubled as a courthouse or capitol building in countless television commercials and movies, and its South Lake shopping district filled in for Rodeo Drive in &quot;Beverly Hills Ninja&quot;.

The city of San Marino has acted as a backdrop for a number of films and television shows. Major studio motion pictures filmed in San Marino include &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs, Smith&quot;, &quot;Disturbia&quot;, &quot;Enough&quot;, &quot;Monster-in-Law&quot;, &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, &quot;Frailty&quot;, &quot;Men in Black II&quot;, &quot;The Hot Chick&quot;, &quot;One Hour Photo&quot;, &quot;Anger Management&quot;, &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot;, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;Intolerable Cruelty&quot;, &quot;Mystery Men&quot;, &quot;Legally Blonde 2&quot;, &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills Ninja&quot;, &quot;The Sweetest Thing&quot;, &quot;S1m0ne&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot;, and &quot;American Wedding&quot;. Prime time television programs filmed within city borders include &quot;Felicity&quot;, &quot;The Office&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, and &quot;Alias&quot;. In addition, San Marino High School students in the graduating classes of 2004 and 2005 were documented in two separate reality television programs by MTV, which aired on the cable television network in 2005.

The cities of Temple City and Rosemead served as the backdrop for the Emmy Award–winning television series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; (1988 to 1993). While Temple City&#x27;s Las Tunas Drive served as the downtown for the Arnold Family&#x27;s fictitious hometown, Rosemead High School stood in for the town&#x27;s high school. Downtown Covina was used in the show &quot;Roswell.&quot;

The city of Whittier also hosts film crews for various motion picture, television and feature films. In Robert Zemeckis&#x27; &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy of time travel adventure movies (1985, 1989, 1990), Whittier High School was used as Hill Valley High School. Michael J. Fox&#x27;s character travels back in time on the huge parking lot of the Puente Hills Mall in the City of Industry that served as the location of the fictitious Twin Pines Mall/Lone Pine Mall. The Gamble House in Pasadena provided the exterior of Christopher Lloyd&#x27;s character&#x27;s 1950s mansion. The city of El Monte served as a dilapidated future neighborhood. Another movie starring Fox, &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;. was largely filmed in Arcadia. The Pasadena Chapter building of the Red Cross served as JAG Headquarters for the TV series &quot;JAG&quot;, and the Caltech campus is regularly seen as the &quot;Cal Sci&quot; campus in the TV series Numb3rs. The actual house used as the residence of the main characters is also located in the southern end of Pasadena. Uptown Whittier was a principal location for the 1987 release &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;, and many scenes of the film show the buildings of the neighborhood as they appeared before most of them were damaged or destroyed by the Whittier Narrows earthquake of that year. &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994), starring Tom Hanks, was partially filmed at East Los Angeles College in Monterey Park. The downtown portion of Myrtle Avenue in Monrovia has been used in many movies and television commercials. Multiple locations throughout Monrovia also played the role of the fictitious Rome, WI in the TV series &quot;Picket Fences&quot;.Pinky&#x27;s Record Store in Friday; The 90s television show &quot;Roswell&quot; filmed in Covina, most noticeably the downtown area. Most recently, the former location of a now closed IKEA in the City of Industry was used to film scenes in the movie &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith&quot; (2005), starring Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. Across the street from the defunct IKEA is Speed Zone, an amusement center with 4 race tracks, it has been featured in the films &quot;Guess Who&quot; and &quot;Clerks 2&quot; and on TV in &quot;Melrose Place (2009 TV series)&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot;, &quot;Freaks And Geeks&quot;, and more.

== Climate ==
Like much of the Los Angeles region, the San Gabriel Valley enjoys a warm, sunny year-round Mediterranean climate. Rain is sporadic. Due to the Eastern San Gabriel Valley, (East of State Route 57) being more inland, the area is subject to hotter summers and colder winters. Light snow is extremely rare in the Valley but can often be viewed on the nearby San Gabriel Mountains.

<text>Brave Saint Saturn (stylized as braveSaintSaturn, brave saint saturn or BS2) is a Christian rock band formed in Denver, Colorado in 1999. The band is a side-project of members of Five Iron Frenzy started by Reese Roper. The band calls their music style &quot;astro-rock&quot;, although Roper has stated that this &quot;doesn&#x27;t mean anything&quot;. The trilogy of albums are meant to artfully represent early life, adversity, and death.

==Background==
Before the band was signed, they were called Astronaut. As a result, &quot;Astronaut Versions&quot; of several early Brave Saint Saturn songs exist. The &quot;Astronaut Version&quot; of &quot;Two-Twenty-Nine&quot; is available on the compilation &quot;Manna 2 Go&quot; (fifty280 records). An otherwise unreleased Astronaut song, &quot;Albatross,&quot; is also available on &quot;Green Manna&quot; (fifty280 records)

Brave Saint Saturn often uses the vastness of space as a metaphor for loneliness and isolation. With this in mind, the band used NASA recordings and electronic samples on their first two albums. One of the biggest influences on the band&#x27;s sound was the Electric Light Orchestra album &quot;Time&quot;. Roper has said that because of this band he has tried to include more strings and orchestral sounds into the group&#x27;s music.

Some reviewers consider Brave Saint Saturn as a generally more serious band than the often light-hearted Five Iron Frenzy. As the former leader of Five Iron Frenzy, Roper often found the band too straightforwardly fun for expressing feelings of loneliness and abandonment. BS2 is the platform for the more depressed and sad lyrics which Roper has written. When speaking of the band, Roper states that, &quot;I&#x27;ve tried to show the redemption and peace of God through tragic things. I think overall the lyrics are about … hope.&quot;

The third of the &quot;Saturn 5 Trilogy&quot;, &quot;Anti-Meridian&quot;, was released on September 15, 2008. The physical album is only available through the band&#x27;s website store, but digital copies were made available at various online stores for digital distribution.

Roper has stated that the band originally planned to make a story arc that would go across three albums, but the band is in talks to create more music in the future beyond their first three albums. There are plans for an album of b-sides, rarities, and redone songs titled &quot;Add-Infinitum&quot;.

Brave Saint Saturn published their first three albums as the &quot;Saturn 5 Trilogy&quot;.

&quot;Saturn 5 Trilogy&quot; tells the story of a fictional NASA Saturn 5 Mission, where the crew of the spacecraft &quot;Gloria&quot; is sent to map the rings of Saturn. While in orbit around Saturn&#x27;s moon, Titan, the &quot;Gloria&quot; suffers a crippling disaster that leaves the craft stranded in geosynchronous orbit on the dark side of the moon. The crew is cut off from radio contact with Earth and the light of the sun, and both the crew and their families fear they are lost forever.

The final album of the trilogy, &quot;Anti-Meridian&quot;, chronicles the return of the crew of the U.S.S. &quot;Gloria&quot; in an escape pod called the &quot;Starling&quot;. Lieutenant Hoerig saves the mission at the cost of his own life. The rest of the crew returns to Earth in one of the &quot;Starling&quot;″s escape pods. Several of the songs deal with the crew&#x27;s thoughts and remembrances in the aftermath of their safe return.

&quot;Saturn 5 Trilogy&quot; uses the loss and subsequent rescue of the crew metaphorically touching on themes of death, resurrection, redemption, and self-sacrifice drawn from secular, mythological, and Christian sources.

<doc id="443961" wikidata="Q250293" url="?curid=443961" title="Donald Judd">
<text>Donald Clarence Judd (June 3, 1928February 12, 1994) was an American artist associated with minimalism. In his work, Judd sought autonomy and clarity for the constructed object and the space created by it, ultimately achieving a rigorously democratic presentation without compositional hierarchy. He is generally considered the leading international exponent of &quot;minimalism&quot;, and its most important theoretician through such writings as &quot;Specific Objects&quot; (1964). Judd voiced his unorthodox perception of minimalism in &quot;Arts Yearbook 8,&quot; where he says, &quot;The new three dimensional work doesn&#x27;t constitute a movement, school, or style. The common aspects are too general and too little common to define a movement. The differences are greater than the similarities.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Judd was born in Excelsior Springs, Missouri. From 1946 to 1947, he served in the Army as an engineer, and in 1948, he enrolled in the College of William and Mary. Later, he transferred to Columbia University School of General Studies where he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in philosophy and where he worked towards a master&#x27;s in art history under Rudolf Wittkower and Meyer Schapiro while attending classes at the Art Students League of New York. From 1959 to 1965, he wrote art criticism for major American art magazines. In 1968, he bought a five-story cast-iron building at 101 Spring Street for less than $70,000. Judd used the building (designed by Nicholas Whyte and built in 1870) as his New York residence and studio, and during the next 25 years, renovated it floor by floor, occasionally installing works he purchased or commissioned from other artists.

==Work==

===Early work===
In the late 1940s, Donald Judd began to practice as a painter. His first solo exhibition, of expressionist paintings, at the Panoras Gallery in New York, opened in 1957. From the mid-1950s to 1961, as he started to explore the medium of the woodcut, Judd progressively moved from figurative to increasingly abstract imagery, first carving organic rounded shapes, then moving on to the painstaking craftsmanship of straight lines and angles. His artistic style soon moved away from illusory media and embraced constructions in which materiality was central to the work. He would not have another one person show until the Green Gallery in 1963, an exhibition of works that he finally thought worthy of showing.

By 1963 Judd had established an essential vocabulary of forms — &#x27;stacks&#x27;, &#x27;boxes&#x27; and &#x27;progressions&#x27; — which preoccupied him for the next thirty years. Most of his output was in freestanding &quot;specific objects&quot; (the name of his seminal essay of 1965 published in Arts Yearbook 8, 1965), that used simple, often repeated forms to explore space and the use of space. Humble materials such as metals, industrial plywood, concrete and color-impregnated Plexiglas became staples of his career. Judd&#x27;s first floor box structure was made in 1964, and his first floor box using Plexiglas followed one year later. Also by 1964, he began work on wall-mounted sculptures, and first developed the curved progression format of these works in 1964 as a development from his work on an untitled floor piece that set a hollow pipe into a solid wooden block. While Judd executed early works himself (in collaboration with his father, Roy Judd), in 1964 he began delegating fabrication to professional artisans and manufacturers (such as the industrial manufacturers Bernstein Brothers) based on his drawings. In 1965, Judd created his first stack, an arrangement of identical iron units stretching from floor to ceiling.

As he abandoned painting for sculpture in the early 1960s, he wrote the essay &quot;Specific Objects&quot; in 1964. In his essay, Judd found a starting point for a new territory for American art, and a simultaneous rejection of residual inherited European artistic values, these values being illusion and represented space, as opposed to real space. He pointed to evidence of this development in the works of an array of artists active in New York at the time, including H.C. Westermann, Lucas Samaras, John Chamberlain, Jasper Johns, Dan Flavin, George Earl Ortman and Lee Bontecou. The works that Judd had fabricated inhabited a space not then comfortably classifiable as either painting or sculpture and in fact he refused to call them sculpture, pointing out that they were not sculpted but made by small fabricators using industrial processes. That the categorical identity of such objects was itself in question, and that they avoided easy association with well-worn and over-familiar conventions, was a part of their value for Judd. He displayed two pieces in the seminal 1966 exhibit, &quot;Primary Structures&quot; at the Jewish Museum in New York where, during a panel discussion of the work, he challenged Mark di Suvero&#x27;s assertion that real artists make their own art. He replied that methods should not matter as long as the results create art; a groundbreaking concept in the accepted creation process. In 1968, the Whitney Museum of American Art staged a retrospective of his work which included none of his early paintings. That same year, Judd received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts. 

In 1968, Judd bought a five-story building in New York that allowed him to start placing his work in a more permanent manner than was possible in gallery or museum shows. This would later lead him to push for permanent installations for his work and that of others, as he believed that temporary exhibitions, being designed by curators for the public, placed the art itself in the background, ultimately degrading it due to incompetency or incomprehension. This would become a major preoccupation as the idea of permanent installation grew in importance and his distaste for the art world grew in equal proportion.

===Mature work===
In the early seventies Judd started making annual trips to Baja California with his family. He was affected by the clean, empty desert and this strong attachment to the land would remain with him for the rest of his life. In 1971 he rented a house in Marfa, Texas, where he would later buy numerous buildings and acquired over of ranch land, collectively known as Ayala de Chinati. During this decade, Judd&#x27;s art increased in scale and complexity. He started making room sized installations that made the spaces themselves his playground and the viewing of his art a visceral, physical experience. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s he produced radical work that eschewed the classical European ideals of representational sculpture. Judd believed that art should not represent anything, that it should unequivocally stand on its own and simply exist. His aesthetic followed his own strict rules against illusion and falsity, producing work that was clear, strong and definite. Supported by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, Northern Kentucky University commissioned a aluminum sculpture from Judd that was unveiled in the middle of the school&#x27;s campus in 1976. Another commission, &quot;Untitled&quot; (1984), a three-part sculpture out of concrete with steel reinforcements, was installed at Laumeier Sculpture Park.

Judd started using unpainted plywood in the early 1970s, a material the artist embraced for its durable structural qualities, which enabled him to expand the size of his works while avoiding the problem of bending or buckling. Plywood had been the staple of his art earlier, but never unpainted. In 1972 Judd appointed Peter Ballantine, a former Whitney Independent Study Program student, as the primary fabricator of his plywood works. He later began using Cor-ten steel in the 1980s for a small number of large-scale outdoor pieces, and by 1989 would create single and multi-part works with the material. The Cor-ten works are unique in that they are the only works the artist himself fabricated in Marfa, Texas.

The artist began working with enamel on aluminum in 1984, when he commissioned Lehni AG in Switzerland to construct works by bending and riveting thin sheets of the material, a process Judd previously used to create furniture. These pieces were initially created for a temporary outdoor exhibition in Merian Park outside Basel. Judd would continue to produce pieces using these techniques through the early 1990s. Judd&#x27;s work with enamel on aluminum greatly expanded his palette of colors, which had previously been restricted to the colors of anodized metal and Plexiglas, and led to the use of more than two colors in an individual artwork. Combining a wide range of colors, he used the material to create five large-scale floor pieces and many horizontal wall works in unique variations of color and size. Judd&#x27;s only known work in granite, an untitled Sierra White granite floor piece from 1978, measures 72 x 144 x 12&quot;. The structure is composed of two vertical slabs that rest on the floor, to which the bottom component is conjoined, and the ceiling of the structure extends to the outer edges of the vertical walls.

In 1990, Judd opened an atelier in an old liquor factory from 1920 at Mülheimer Hafen in Cologne, Germany.

===Works in edition===

Over the course of four decades, Donald Judd created hundreds of prints using aquatint, etching, and screen print techniques though woodcut was his primary print medium. Judd began to make figurative prints in 1951 while at the Art Students League, transitioning to abstract images by the mid-1950s. Working first with lithographs, Judd shifted his attention to woodcuts, which became his dominant print medium as early as 1953. As a printmaker, Judd investigated many of the same issues of form and color that are found in his paintings and three-dimensional works.

In 1961 Judd conceived and designed a parallelogram woodcut series. This is based on thirteen different patterns of twelve parallel lines, and their mirror images, thus there are 26 prints in total. Within the parallelogram woodcut series there exists one exceptional, experimental impression of Untitled (6-L) (1969), now in the Palmer Museum of Art, University Park, Pennsylvania. Rejecting the more traditional rectangular paper shape, this impression of Untitled (6-L) is cut into the shape of a parallelogram.

Between the years 1967 and 1992, Judd made eight different sets of works in editions ranging from three to two hundred in a range of materials: stainless steel, galvanized iron, cold-rolled steel, anodized aluminum, acrylic sheet, and wood.

===Furniture design and architecture===
Judd also worked with furniture, design, and architecture. He was careful to distinguish his design practice from his artwork, writing in 1993: The configuration and the scale of art cannot be transposed into furniture and architecture. The intent of art is different from that of the latter, which must be functional. If a chair or a building is not functional, if it appears to be only art, it is ridiculous. The art of a chair is not its resemblance to art, but is partly its reasonableness, usefulness and scale as a chair... A work of art exists as itself; a chair exists as a chair itself.
The first furniture, a bed and a sink, Judd designed in 1970 for Spring Street. After he moved from New York to Marfa his designs started to include chairs, beds, shelves, desks and tables. Judd was initially prompted to design furniture by his own dissatisfaction with what was commercially available in Marfa. Early furniture was made by Judd of rough, lumberyard-cut pine but he continually refined the construction of the wooden pieces, employing craftspeople using a variety of techniques and materials around the world.

Judd&#x27;s activity in architecture and furniture design increased beginning around 1978, at which time he was involved professionally and romantically with Lauretta Vinciarelli, an Italian-born architect and artist. Vinciarelli lived and worked with Judd in Marfa and New York for roughly a decade and collaborated with him on projects for Providence and Cleveland, and her influence can be seen on his architecture and furniture design. In fact, in a 1986 article published in &quot;Architectural Digest,&quot; William C. Agee stated that Judd and Vinciarelli were &quot;starting a firm&quot;.

At the time of his death, he was working on a series of fountains commissioned by the city of Winterthur in 1991, Switzerland, and a new glass facade for a railroad station in Basel, Switzerland.

In 1984, Judd commissioned Lehni AG, the fabricator of his multi-colored works in Dübendorf, Switzerland to produce his furniture designs in sheet metal, in finishes of monochrome colored powdercoat based on the RAL colour standard, clear anodized aluminium, or solid copper. Today, Lehni AG still fabricates Judd metal furniture in 21 colors, which are sold through the Judd Foundation alongside his furniture in wood and plywood.

===Chinati Foundation===

In 1979, with help from the Dia Art Foundation, Judd purchased a tract of desert land near Marfa, which included the abandoned buildings of the former U.S. Army Fort D. A. Russell. The Chinati Foundation opened on the site in 1986 as a non-profit art foundation, dedicated to Judd and his contemporaries. The permanent collection consists of large-scale works by Judd, sculptor John Chamberlain, light-artist Dan Flavin and select others, including Ingólfor Arnarsson, David Rabinowitch, Roni Horn, Ilya Kabakov, Richard Long, Carl Andre, Claes Oldenburg and Coosje Van Bruggen, as well as Robert Irwin. Judd&#x27;s work at Chinati includes 15 outdoor works in concrete and 100 aluminum pieces housed in two former artillery sheds that he adapted in great detail specifically for the installation of the work.

===Academic work===
Judd taught at several academic institutions in the United States: The Allen-Stevenson School (1960s), Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences (1962–64); Dartmouth College, Hanover (1966); and Yale University, New Haven (1967). In 1976 he served as Baldwin Professor at Oberlin College in Ohio. Beginning in 1983, he lectured at universities across the United States, Europe and Asia on both art and its relationship to architecture. During his lifetime, Judd published a large body of theoretical writings, in which he rigorously promoted the cause of Minimalist Art; these essays were consolidated into two volumes, published in 1975 and 1987.

===Writings===
In his reviews as a critic, Judd discussed in detail the work of more than 500 artists showing in New York in the early and mid-1960s for publications including &quot;ARTnews,&quot; &quot;Arts Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Art International&quot;. He provided a critical account of this significant era of art in America while addressing the social and political ramifications of art production. His essay &quot;Specific Objects&quot;, first published in 1965, remains central to the analysis of the new art development in the early 1960s.

Four major collections of his writings were published during his lifetime. &quot;Donald Judd: Complete Writings 1959-1975&quot; (Halifax, Nova Scotia/New York: Press of the College of Art and Design/New York University Press, 1975); &quot;Donald Judd: Complete Writings: 1975-1986&quot; (Eindhoven: Van Abbemuseum, 1987); &quot;Donald Judd: Architektur&quot; (Münster: Westfälischer Kunstverein, 1989); &quot;Donald Judd: Écrits 1963-1990&quot; (Paris: Daniel Lelong, 1991).

==Exhibitions==
The artist&#x27;s work has been included in over 230 solo museum and gallery exhibitions worldwide, excluding site-specific works.

The Panoras Gallery organized Judd&#x27;s first solo exhibition in 1957. In 1963, the Green Gallery mounted his first solo exhibition of three-dimensional work. The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, organized the first retrospective of his work in 1968.

The Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, presented &quot;Don Judd&quot; in 1970, which also traveled to the Folkwang Museum in Essen, Germany, the Kunstverein Hannover, Germany, as well as Whitechapel Art Gallery in London, UK. In 1975, the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, organized a large exhibition in 1975 and published a catalogue raisonné of Judd&#x27;s work.

Judd participated in his first Venice Biennale in 1980, and in Documenta, Kassel, in 1982. In 1987, another large Judd-exhibition was presented at the Van Abbemuseum; this show also traveled to the Kunsthalle Düsseldorf, Germany, Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, France, Fundació Joan Miró, Barcelona, Spain, and Castello di Rivoli in Turin, Italy.

The Whitney Museum organized a second, traveling retrospective of his work in 1988, and another major European survey, &quot;Donald Judd,&quot; was mounted at Tate Modern, London, in 2004, which traveled to major museums in Düsseldorf and Basel through 2005.

Other important exhibitions include &quot;Donald Judd: Prints 1951–1993, Retrospektive der Druckgraphik&quot;, Gemeentemuseum Den Haag, The Hague, 1993–1994; &quot;Donald Judd. Early Work 1955–1968&quot; at Kunsthalle Bielefeld, Germany, 2002; &quot;Donald Judd Colorist&quot;, Sprengel Museum, Hanover, Germany, 2000. &quot;Judd,&quot; a large retrospective of Judd&#x27;s work&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; opened at the Museum of Modern Art, New York in March 2020.

==Judd Foundation==
Originally conceived by Judd in 1977, and created in 1996, the Judd Foundation was formed in order to preserve the work and installations of Judd in Marfa, Texas and at 101 Spring Street in New York. Judd Foundation maintains and preserves his permanently installed living and working spaces, libraries, and archives across 22 buildings that comprise more than 100,000 square feet (approx. 9290 m2) and are considered fundamental components to the understanding of Judd&#x27;s work as they remain the standard for his concept of permanent installation. The Foundation promotes a wider understanding of Judd&#x27;s artistic legacy by providing access to these spaces and resources and by developing scholarly and educational programs. Judd Foundation is a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization.

In 2006, Judd Foundation established an endowment to support its operations through the sale of 36 works at auction. The foundation board requested one of its members, publisher Richard Schlagman, to get Christie&#x27;s and Sotheby&#x27;s to submit proposals for the sale of a group of works. Christie&#x27;s offered a reported $21 million guarantee and agreed to display the consigned work for five weeks in New York on the 20th floor of the Simon &amp; Schuster building. Concerns that the sale would have an adverse effect on the market proved unfounded and the exhibition itself won an AICA award for &quot;Best Installation in an Alternative Space&quot; for 2006. The $20 million in proceeds from the sale went into an endowment to enable the Foundation to fulfill its mission, by supporting the permanent installations that are located at 101 Spring Street in New York City and Marfa, Texas. Marianne Stockebrand, the director of the Chinati Foundation at the time, resigned from her post on the Judd Foundation&#x27;s board partly in protest of the auction.

In 2013, the Judd Foundation — led by the artist&#x27;s children — completed a $23 million renovation of 101 Spring Street, opening the building to the public for the first time. In 2018, Judd Foundation began a long-term restoration plan for its buildings in Marfa. In 2022, eight of the buildings stewarded by Judd Foundation in Marfa were added to the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Central Marfa Historic District. The listing is the first time that Judd&#x27;s approach to architecture and preservation has been recognized as historically significant at the federal level.

The publication program of Judd Foundation intends to develop texts for scholars, students, and those interested in the life and work of Judd. Judd Foundation published a reprint edition of &quot;Donald Judd: Complete Writings 1959-1975&quot; (2015); and co-published &quot;Donald Judd Writings&quot; (2016), a new collection of Judd&#x27;s writings and notes; &quot;Donald Judd Interviews&quot; (2019); and &quot;Donald Judd Spaces&quot; (2020).

A comprehensive catalogue raisonné of paintings, objects, and wood-blocks is currently in the research phase by Judd Foundation.

The Leo Castelli Gallery, New York, represented the artist from 1965 to 1985. Judd then worked with Paula Cooper Gallery, New York, where he had a number of solo shows, and PaceWildenstein, which represented him through the end of his life. Judd&#x27;s work has been represented – through the Judd Foundation – by Gagosian Gallery since September 2021 and Thaddaeus Ropac since 2018.

Prices for Judd&#x27;s works first peaked in 2002, when a group of six Plexiglas boxes sold for $4.2 million. One of Judd&#x27;s large stacks, comprising 10 galvanised iron elements with nine-inch (228.6 mm) intervals, untitled (1977) fetched $9.8 million at Christie&#x27;s in 2007. Judd&#x27;s ten-unit untitled (1968) made of stainless steel and amber Plexiglas was sold for $4.9 million at Christie&#x27;s New York in 2009. As of 2013, the artist&#x27;s auction record is held by untitled (1963) a large-scale sculpture executed in galvanized iron, aluminum and wood, which sold for $14,165,000 at Christie&#x27;s New York in 2013.

==Personal life==
Judd married dancer Julie Finch in 1964 and together they had two children, son Flavin Starbuck Judd (born 1968) and daughter Rainer Yingling Judd (born 1970). The couple divorced in 1978. From the late 1970s to the mid-1980s Judd was partners with artist, architect, and educator Lauretta Vinciarelli. In 1989, he met curator and museum director Marianne Stockebrand, who became the director and later, director emerita of Chinati Foundation.

Judd had homes in Manhattan, Marfa, Texas, and Kussnacht am Rigi, Switzerland. He died in Manhattan of non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma on February 12, 1994, aged 65.

<text>Hook is a 1991 American fantasy adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg and written by James V. Hart and Malia Scotch Marmo. It stars Robin Williams as Peter Banning / Peter Pan, Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook, Julia Roberts as Tinker Bell, Bob Hoskins as Mr. Smee, Maggie Smith as Granny Wendy and Charlie Korsmo as Jack Banning. It serves as a sequel in a modern day setting to J. M. Barrie&#x27;s 1911 novel &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot;, focusing on an adult Peter Pan who has forgotten his childhood due to his high-powered lifestyle. In his new life, he is known as Peter Banning, a successful but career-minded lawyer who neglects his wife (Wendy&#x27;s granddaughter) and their two children. However, when his old archenemy, Captain Hook, kidnaps his children, he returns to Neverland to save them. Along the journey, he reclaims the memories of his past and develops full emotional maturity.

Spielberg began developing &quot;Hook&quot; in the early 1980s with Walt Disney Productions and Paramount Pictures. It would have followed the Peter Pan storyline seen in the 1924 silent film and 1953 animated Disney film. It entered pre-production in 1985, but Spielberg abandoned the project. Hart developed the script with director Nick Castle and TriStar Pictures before Spielberg decided to direct in 1989. It was shot almost entirely on sound stages at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California.

Released on December 11, 1991, &quot;Hook&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the performances (particularly those of Williams and Hoffman), John Williams&#x27;s musical score, and the film&#x27;s production values, but criticized the screenplay and tone. The film also received five nominations at the 64th Academy Awards. Despite turning a profit, the film failed to meet box-office expectations. Since its release, &quot;Hook&quot; gained a strong cult following, and it is considered by many to be a cult classic.

==Plot==

Peter Banning, a workaholic lawyer fixated on success, has a strained relationship with his wife, Moira, and their children, Jack and Maggie, due to his constant absences and broken promises. During Christmas, the family travels to London to visit Moira&#x27;s grandmother, Wendy Darling, who cared for Peter as an orphan. When Peter loses his temper with the children for interrupting a work call, Moira scolds him, reminding him how fleeting their time with the children is. During a dinner honoring Wendy’s work with orphans, the children stay home with her old friend, Tootles. Returning from the event, Peter and Moira discover the children are missing, with a note left behind signed by Captain James Hook. 

Wendy urges Peter to return to Neverland and rescue his children because he is Peter Pan. Having no memory of his childhood, Peter does not believe her until the fairy Tinker Bell arrives and flies him to Neverland. In the pirate town, Peter confronts Hook, who fails to recognize his once formidable rival. Hook challenges Peter to fly and save his children, but Peter fails. Dismayed at how pathetic Peter has become, Hook orders his execution, but Tinker Bell convinces him to give her three days to train Peter for their final battle. 

Peter is brought to the Lost Boys&#x27; hideout, now led by Rufio. They mock the grown man before them until the group ultimately recognizes him. They begin training Peter, urging him to abandon his uptight adult demeanor and embrace his imagination. Meanwhile, Hook&#x27;s first mate, Smee, suggests turning Peter&#x27;s children against him. Maggie resists, but Jack, hurt by Peter&#x27;s broken promises and failure to save him, begins to side with Hook.

While infiltrating the pirate town, Peter sees Jack playing in a baseball game organized by Hook, who has taken on a fatherly role. Devastated, Peter returns to the Lost Boys&#x27; camp with renewed determination. His shadow leads him to the ruins of Wendy&#x27;s house, where he remembers his past: as an infant in the early 1900s, he ran away from his mother, fearing growing up and dying, and was brought to Neverland by Tinker Bell. Visiting his family later, he found they had a new child and assumed they had forgotten him. Peter met Wendy, who fell in love with him, but as she aged and started a family, Peter fell for her granddaughter, Moira, and remained with her. Recalling Jack&#x27;s birth as his happiest memory, Peter regains his powers and ability to fly. That night, a heartbroken Tinker Bell confesses her unrequited love to Peter.

The next day, Peter and the Lost Boys launch an attack on the pirates. While Peter rescues Maggie, Rufio is fatally wounded in a duel with Hook. Witnessing Rufio&#x27;s dying wish for a father like Peter, Jack reconciles with his father. Peter prepares to leave Neverland with his children, but Hook demands a final battle, vowing to eternally stalk Peter&#x27;s descendants if denied. With help from Tinker Bell and the Lost Boys, Peter subdues Hook, who feigns surrender. Hook tries to stab Peter, but misses and impales the taxidermied Crocodile that once ate his hand. The Crocodile appears to come to life, topples over, and consumes Hook. Tinker Bell then returns Jack and Maggie home while Peter bids farewell to the Lost Boys, appointing Thud Butt as their new leader. Thud Butt gives Peter a bag of marbles that belonged to Tootles, a former Lost Boy.

Peter awakens in London, where Tinker Bell tearfully bids him farewell. Transformed by his journey, Peter joyfully reunites with his family and discards his work phone. He returns the bag to Tootles, who sprinkles the pixie dust within on himself and flies off to Neverland. When Wendy observes that Peter&#x27;s adventures are over, he replies, &quot;To live will be an awfully big adventure.&quot;

==Production==
===Inspiration===
Steven Spielberg found a close personal connection to Peter Pan&#x27;s story from his own childhood. The troubled relationship between Peter Banning and his son Jack in the film echoed Spielberg&#x27;s relationship with his own father Arnold. Previous Spielberg films that explored a dysfunctional father-son relationship included &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;. Peter&#x27;s &quot;quest for success&quot; paralleled Spielberg starting out as a film director and transforming into a Hollywood business magnate. &quot;I think a lot of people today are losing their imagination because they are work-driven. They are so self-involved with work and success and arriving at the next plateau that children and family almost become incidental. I have even experienced it myself when I have been on a very tough shoot and I&#x27;ve not seen my kids except on weekends. They ask for my time and I can&#x27;t give it to them because I&#x27;m working.&quot;

Like Peter at the beginning of the film, Spielberg has a fear of flying. He feels that Peter&#x27;s &quot;enduring quality&quot; in the storyline is simply to fly. &quot;Anytime anything flies, whether it&#x27;s Superman, Batman, or E.T., it&#x27;s got to be a tip of the hat to Peter Pan,&quot; Spielberg reflected in a 1992 interview. &quot;&quot;Peter Pan&quot; was the first time I saw anybody fly. Before I saw Superman, before I saw Batman, and of course before I saw any superheroes, my first memory of anybody flying is in &quot;Peter Pan&quot;&quot;.

===Pre-production===
The genesis of the film started when Spielberg&#x27;s mother often read him &quot;Peter and Wendy&quot; as a bedtime story. He explained in 1985, &quot;When I was 11 years old, I actually directed the story during a school production. I have always felt like Peter Pan. I still feel like Peter Pan. It has been very hard for me to grow up, I&#x27;m a victim of the Peter Pan syndrome&quot;.

In the early 1980s, Spielberg began to develop a film with Walt Disney Pictures that would have closely followed the storyline of the 1924 silent film and 1953 animated film. He also considered directing it as a musical with Michael Jackson in the lead. Jackson expressed interest in the part, but was not interested in Spielberg&#x27;s vision of an adult Peter Pan, who had forgotten about his past.

The project was taken to Paramount Pictures, where James V. Hart wrote the first script, with Dustin Hoffman already cast as Captain Hook. It entered pre-production in 1985, with filming to begin at sound stages in England. Elliot Scott had been hired as production designer. With the birth of his first son, Max, in 1985, Spielberg decided to drop out. &quot;I decided not to make &quot;Peter Pan&quot; when I had my first child,&quot; Spielberg commented. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to go to London and have seven kids on wires in front of blue screens. I wanted to be home as a dad.&quot; Around this time, he considered directing &quot;Big&quot;, which carried with it similar motifs and themes. In 1987, he &quot;permanently abandoned&quot; it, feeling he expressed his childhood and adult themes in &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;.

Meanwhile, Paramount and Hart moved forward on production with Nick Castle as director. Hart began to work on a new storyline when his son Jake showed his family a drawing. &quot;We asked Jake what it was and he said it was a crocodile eating Captain Hook, but that the crocodile really didn&#x27;t eat him, he got away,&quot; Hart reflected. &quot;As it happens, I had been trying to crack &quot;Peter Pan&quot; for years, but I didn&#x27;t just want to do a remake. So I went, &#x27;Wow. Hook is not dead. The crocodile is. We&#x27;ve all been fooled.&#x27; In 1986, our family was having dinner and Jake said, &#x27;Daddy, did Peter Pan ever grow up?&#x27; My immediate response was, &#x27;No, of course not.&#x27; And Jake said, &#x27;But what if he did?&#x27; I realized that Peter did grow up, just like all of us baby boomers who are now in our forties. I patterned him after several of my friends on Wall Street, where the pirates wear three-piece suits and ride in limos.&quot;

Many fans believed Tom Hanks was Spielberg&#x27;s original choice for the role of Peter Pan. Hanks has debunked that rumour. Joseph Mazzello auditioned for the role of Jack Banning, but was turned down because he was deemed too young for the role. Mazzello was cast later as Tim Murphy in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

===Filming===
By 1989, Ian Rathbone changed the title to &quot;Hook&quot;, and took it from Paramount to TriStar Pictures, headed by Mike Medavoy, who was Spielberg&#x27;s first talent agent. Robin Williams signed on, but he and Hoffman had creative differences with Castle. Medavoy saw the film as a vehicle for Spielberg and Castle was dismissed, but he was paid a $500,000 settlement. Dodi Fayed, who owned certain rights to make a &quot;Peter Pan&quot; film, sold his interest to TriStar in exchange for an executive producer credit. Spielberg briefly worked with Hart to rewrite the script before hiring Malia Scotch Marmo to rewrite Captain Hook&#x27;s dialog, and Carrie Fisher for Tinker Bell&#x27;s. The Writers Guild of America gave Hart and Marmo screenplay credit, while Hart and Castle were credited with the story. Fisher went uncredited.

Filming began February 19, 1991, occupying nine sound stages at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California. Stage 30 housed the Neverland Lost Boys playground, while Stage 10 supplied Captain Hook&#x27;s ship cabin. Hidden hydraulics were installed to rock the set-piece to simulate a swaying ship, but the filmmakers found the movement distracted from the dialogue, so the idea was dropped.

Stage 27 housed the full-sized &quot;Jolly Roger&quot; and the surrounding Pirate Wharf. Industrial Light &amp; Magic provided the visual effects sequences. This marked the beginning of Tony Swatton&#x27;s career, as he was asked to make weaponry for the film.

It was financed by Amblin Entertainment and TriStar Pictures, with TriStar distributing it. Spielberg hired John Napier as a &quot;visual consultant&quot;, having been impressed with his work on &quot;Cats&quot;. The original production budget was set at $48 million, but ended up between $60–80 million. The primary reason for the increased budget was the shooting schedule, which ran 40 days over its original 76-day schedule. Spielberg explained, &quot;It was all my fault. I began to work at a slower pace than I usually do.&quot;

Spielberg&#x27;s on-set relationship with Julia Roberts was troubled, and he admitted in a 1992 interview with &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, &quot;It was an unfortunate time for us to work together.&quot; In a 1999 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; interview, Roberts said that Spielberg&#x27;s comments &quot;really hurt my feelings&quot;. She &quot;couldn&#x27;t believe this person that I knew and trusted was actually hesitating to come to my defense... it was the first time that I felt I had a turncoat in my midst.&quot;

==Soundtrack==

The film score was composed and conducted by John Williams. He was brought in at an early stage when Spielberg was considering making the film as a musical. Williams wrote approximately eight songs with lyricist Leslie Bricusse for the project at this stage. Williams and Bricusse finalized it to five songs. Several of these songs were recorded, and some musical segments were even filmed.

Julie Andrews recorded one song, &quot;Childhood&quot;, at the Sony Pictures Studios, so that Maggie Smith could lip-sync it on-set; it was meant to be sung by Granny Wendy to her grandchildren in their bedroom. Two additional songs, &quot;Stick with Me&quot; and &quot;Low Below&quot;, performed by Dustin Hoffman and Bob Hoskins, respectively, were also rehearsed. These three songs were ultimately cut from the film, and instead were incorporated into the instrumental score. Two remaining songs survive in the finished film: &quot;We Don&#x27;t Wanna Grow Up&quot; and &quot;When You&#x27;re Alone&quot;, both with lyrics by Bricusse. The &quot;Prologue&quot; track later appeared in a commercial for the 68th Academy Awards in 1995, and in trailers for &quot;Matilda&quot; (1996), another film by TriStar.

The original 1991 issue was released by Epic Soundtrax. In 2012, a limited edition of the soundtrack, called &quot;Hook: Expanded Original Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;, was released by La-La Land Records and Sony Music. It contains almost the complete score, with alternates and unused material. It also contains liner notes that explain the film&#x27;s production and score recording.
;Commercial songs from the film, but not on the soundtrack
* &quot;Pick&#x27;em Up&quot; – Music by John Williams and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse
* &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; – Written by Jack Norworth and Albert Von Tilzer

In November 2023, La-La Land Records announced a remastered and expanded three-disc ultimate edition of the film&#x27;s score in its entirety, to be released December 1, 2023. The first disc includes the score presentation. The second disc features the additional musical tracks, and the third disc features alternate cues, source music, and Leslie Bricusse&#x27;s songs.

==Video games==

A video game based on the film and bearing the same name was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991. The game was released for additional game consoles in 1992. Another game was released for personal computer and Commodore Amiga, and is a point-and-click adventure game.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Spielberg, Williams and Hoffman did not take salaries for &quot;Hook&quot;. Their deal called for them to split 40% of TriStar Pictures&#x27;s gross revenues. They were to receive $20 million from the first $50 million in gross theatrical film rentals, with TriStar keeping the next $70 million in rentals before the three resumed receiving their percentage.

&quot;Hook&quot; was released in North America December 11, 1991, earning $13.5 million in its opening weekend. It went on to gross $119.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $181.2 million in foreign countries, accumulating a worldwide total of $300.9 million. It is the sixth-highest-grossing &quot;pirate-themed&quot; film, behind all five films in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film series. In the United States and Canada, it was the sixth-highest-grossing film in 1991, and fourth-highest-grossing worldwide. It was the second-highest-grossing film in Japan, with theatrical rentals of $22.4 million. It ended up making a profit of $50 million for the studio, yet it was still declared a financial disappointment, having been overshadowed by the release of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, and a decline in box-office receipts compared to the previous years.

===Critical response===
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 29% of critics have given the film a positive review, based on 66 reviews, with an average rating of 4.70/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;The look of &quot;Hook&quot; is lively indeed, but Steven Spielberg directs on autopilot here, giving in too quickly to his sentimental, syrupy qualities.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a 52 out of 100 rating, based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote: Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine felt it would &quot;only appeal to the baby boomer generation&quot;, and highly criticized the sword-fighting choreography. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt the story structure was not well balanced, feeling Spielberg depended too much on art direction. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was one of the few who gave it a positive review. Hinson elaborated on crucial themes of children, adulthood and loss of innocence. However, he said Spielberg &quot;was stuck too much in a theme park world&quot;.

John Williams&#x27;s musical score was particularly praised, and is considered by many as one of his best. Filmmaker Jon M. Chu cited the film as a source of inspiration for the visual aesthetics of his two-part film adaptation of the musical &quot;Wicked&quot; (2024-2025).

===Spielberg&#x27;s assessment===
In the years since its release, Spielberg has admitted in interviews that he was not proud of the film, and disappointed with the final result. In 2011, he told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;There are parts of &quot;Hook&quot; I love. I&#x27;m really proud of my work right up through Peter being hauled off in the parachute out the window, heading for Neverland. I&#x27;m a little less proud of the Neverland sequences because I&#x27;m uncomfortable with that highly stylized world that today, of course, I would probably have done with live-action character work inside a completely digital set. But we didn&#x27;t have the technology to do it then, and my imagination only went as far as building physical sets and trying to paint trees blue and red.&quot;

Spielberg gave a more blunt assessment in a 2013 interview on &quot;Kermode &amp; Mayo&#x27;s Film Review&quot;: &quot;I wanna see &quot;Hook&quot; again because I so don&#x27;t like that movie, and I&#x27;m hoping someday I&#x27;ll see it again and perhaps like some of it.&quot; In 2018, Spielberg told &quot;Empire&quot;, &quot;I felt like a fish out of water making &quot;Hook&quot;... I didn&#x27;t have confidence in the script. I had confidence in the first act and I had confidence in the epilogue. I didn&#x27;t have confidence in the body of it.&quot; He added, &quot;I didn&#x27;t quite know what I was doing and I tried to paint over my insecurity with production value,&quot; admitting &quot;the more insecure I felt about it, the bigger and more colorful the sets became.&quot;

<doc id="443982" wikidata="Q4646307" url="?curid=443982" title="99 Ranch Market">
<text>99 Ranch Market () is an American supermarket chain owned by Tawa Supermarket Inc., which is based in Buena Park, California. 99 Ranch has 58 stores in the U.S. (as of April 2023), primarily in California, with other stores in Nevada, Oregon, Washington, New Jersey, Texas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Arizona, and Virginia. The company also started offering shopping via its website in 2014. In February 2021, the company also launched their mobile app for grocery delivery. One of its main competitors is H-mart.

Founded in 1984 by Taiwanese immigrant Roger H. Chen, 99 Ranch Market has grown into the largest Asian supermarket chain in the United States.

The parent company Tawa Supermarket Inc. also owns 168 Market, a smaller Taiwanese-American supermarket chain which has six stores in California and Nevada.

==History==

Roger Chen, a Taiwanese-born American, opened the chain&#x27;s first location in 1984 in Little Saigon, a Vietnamese American community located in Westminster, California (now closed). In 1987, a second market was opened in Montebello (also now closed). It was originally called &quot;99 Price Market&quot; but was eventually renamed 99 Ranch Market to give the supermarket a somewhat more attractive name.

Prior to 1998, all stores that were opened outside of California were done through franchises, with the exception for a single store in Nevada, all of these franchises had either failed (Hawaii and Georgia), became independent (Indonesia), or both (Arizona).

In their first expansion outside of California, company owned stores were opened in the Seattle area at the Great Wall Shopping Center in 1998 and a second store at the Edmonds Shopping Center in 2003.

Over the years, 99 Ranch Market has developed into the largest Asian supermarket chain, with its own production facilities, including farms and processing factories. The chain is currently headquartered in Buena Park, California. 

In addition to its American stores, it maintains its own production facilities in China and these company-owned plants have implemented quality control measures to ensure that products from China are compliant with Food and Drug Administration standards and regulations.

A franchise store was established in Atlanta at the Asian Square in 1993. This store was unable to compete with more recently opened East Coast based chains like Super H Mart and closed in 2010.

In 1993, the parent of the 99 Ranch Asian supermarket chain, Tawa Supermarkets, created a Chinese-Canadian supermarket chain called T&amp;T Supermarket (大統華) as a joint venture with Uni-President Enterprises Corporation of Taiwan and a group of Canadian investors headed by President and CEO Cindy Lee. T&amp;T initially started stores in the Vancouver area, and then expanded throughout Canada and into Edmonton, Calgary and Toronto. Tawa and partners sold the T&amp;T Supermarket chain to Loblaw Companies in 2009 for $225 million.

In 1995, the first 99 Ranch Market location in the state of Nevada was opened by a franchise that was owned by Chen&#x27;s nephew Jason Chen as the anchor for the new Chinatown Plaza development in Las Vegas. A second Las Vegas area location was opened two decades later in October 2015.

In Phoenix, a franchise store was established by E&amp;E Supermarkets in 1997 at the Chinese Cultural Center. However, E&amp;E Supermarkets filed for bankruptcy in 1999 and the store was eventually closed. 99 Ranch Market reentered the Phoenix market in May 2021 by opening a store in Chandler, Arizona.

Another franchise store in Honolulu was established by Sunrise USA, Inc. in 1998 at the Moanalua Ethnic Village. This store was closed in 2007.

In 1997, PT Supra Boga Lestari established a franchise in Jakarta, Indonesia. After the May 1998 riots, PT Supra Boga Lestari decided it was best to break its ties with Tawa and become independent while using the similarly sounding &quot;Ranch Market&quot; and &quot;Ranch 99 Market&quot; names in Indonesia.

Expanding into Texas, two company owned stores were opened near Houston in 2008 and 2009 while a third store was opened in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex at Plano in 2010. A fourth Texas location opened up in Carrollton in March 2016 followed by a fifth location in Katy in August 2016. A sixth location in Austin, TX opened on March 3, 2018.

In 2006, the parent company Tawa Supermarket Inc. established a new Taiwanese-American supermarket chain, 168 Market, as a lower-cost alternative to 99 Ranch Market. The two chains share the same management team and owners. As of 2020, 168 Market has 5 stores in California and one in Nevada.

The company&#x27;s first store location east of the Mississippi River was opened in Edison, New Jersey in January 2017 in a former Pathmark location. A second New Jersey location was opened in April 2017 in Jersey City.

In August 2017, the company opened its first Oregon store in Beaverton.

In April 2018, the company opened its first store in the state of Maryland, in Gaithersburg.

In January 2020, the company opened its first Massachusetts store in Quincy.

In August 2020, the company opened its first store in the state of Virginia, in Fairfax. 

In April 2022, the company opened its first store in the state of New York, in Westbury.

==Customer base==
Although most of its customers are ethnic Chinese Americans, shoppers also include recent immigrants from China, ethnic Chinese from Vietnam, and others. The chain sells a wide range of imported food products and merchandise from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia (particularly Vietnam and Thailand). It also carries some domestic products made by Chinese American companies and a limited selection of mainstream American brands. In addition, it has also reached out to pan-Asian customers, especially Filipino Americans and Japanese Americans, by opening locations in areas predominantly populated by people of these two ethnicities.

Because 99 Ranch Market serves a predominantly Chinese American base, Mandarin Chinese serves as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the supermarket and its adjacent businesses. In-store PA announcements announcing specials are multi-lingual and often in Mandarin and Cantonese, less often in English.

The name of the chain includes &quot;99,&quot; a number considered lucky by ethnic Chinese. The number nine in Chinese sounds like the word for &quot;long-lasting.&quot;

The company&#x27;s slogan is &quot;For 100 we try harder,&quot; a play on the grocery&#x27;s name. In earlier times, the company utilized an English slogan of &quot;united at heart for a better future,&quot; with the Chinese slogan being &quot;大華與您共創未來&quot; (&quot;Dà Huá yǔ nín gòngchuàng wèilái -&quot; &quot;99 Ranch is creating the future together with you&quot;). As of 2017, the company has also described itself as &quot;Your Favorite Destination For Asian Food Since 1984.&quot;

==General locations==
Generally, the chain locates its stores in newer suburban Mandarin-speaking immigrant communities, such as Milpitas, California, where the supermarket is strategically located near the technology industries of the Silicon Valley which employ many Asian immigrants, and Irvine, California, where wealthy Taiwanese Americans settled during the 1990s.

Non-suburban locations tend to be located in multi-ethnic districts. For instance, the Van Nuys, California and Richmond, California stores are located in multi-cultural neighborhoods and are popular among African American, Mexican American, and European American customers, as well as Chinese-speaking customers.

In California, the chain has purportedly not been as popular in older Chinese communities. The 99 Ranch in Los Angeles&#x27; Chinatown operated in the Bamboo Plaza area for several years, but eventually the store was closed, perhaps due to its obscure location and lack of parking space, and perhaps due to competition from local small grocers, who have maintained their popularity among elderly Chinese American shoppers.

Setting up in suburbia, 99 Ranch Market is often the only Asian American supermarket and shopping center for miles around. For instance, 99 Ranch Market is one of the very few Asian supermarkets operating in the San Fernando Valley.

Given the market chain&#x27;s premium locations, the costs of rent for tenants are generally high, but other Chinese businesses, such as Sam Woo Restaurants, Chinese traditional medicine shops, and gift stores, have been known to follow 99 Ranch Market to its new locations, with 99 Ranch market becoming the anchor tenant for the smaller stores and restaurants within developing Asian suburban shopping areas. For example, in Phoenix, Arizona, the state&#x27;s first 99 Ranch Market opened as part of a larger Chinese Cultural Center that offered a number of Asian restaurants and shops for the city and surrounding areas.

Since 2008, 99 Ranch Market has opened locations in Texas, in particular Houston (2008), Sugar Land (2009), Plano (2010), Carrollton (2016), Katy (2016), Austin (2018), and Frisco (2019). This is in response to the growing population of Asian-Americans in Texas in the 2000s.

Most 99 Ranch Markets are company-owned. The only franchised locations remaining in the United States are those in Las Vegas. 99 Ranch Market is a popular American supermarket chain that is owned by Tawa Supermarkets Inc. and is based in Buena Park CA. As of April 2023 58 stores of 99 Grand Supermarkets are primarily based in California with other stores in Oregon, Nevada, New Jersey, Washington, Texas, Massachusetts, Maryland, Arizona and Virginia. 

==Store layout and offerings==
In design, 99 Ranch Market stores are similar to mainstream American supermarkets, with aisles that are wider and less cluttered than in most other Chinese markets. The supermarket accepts credit cards for totals above US$5.00 whereas many markets in old Chinatowns do not. Also, a scant handful of 99 Ranch Market locations have an in-store branch of East West Bank, a major Chinese American bank.

Most 99 Ranch Market locations have a full-service take-out deli serving a combination of Cantonese, Taiwanese, and Sichuan fare. Some of the delis in the markets also feature sushi, or pre-cooked meats, such as Cantonese roast duck (huo ya) and barbecued pork (Char Siu). These stores also have a bakery with decorated cakes and fresh Chinese pastries; most of the bread products and pastries sold in the markets are no longer being made inside the store. The 99 Ranch locations that do not have delicatessens and/or bakeries simply operate as bare-bones markets.

99 Ranch Market used to operate a membership VIP card program and send out direct mail circulars with coupons. All of these programs and promotions were discontinued in August 2007, in favor of offering all customers the same price benefits. Although the chain remains successful and popular, prices are on average generally higher when compared to smaller non-chain Chinese groceries. In 2014, 99 Ranch Market re-launched a new point rewards program known as the Super Rewards Card, where customers gain 1 point for every pre-tax dollar spent. The chain also regularly runs sweepstakes giveaways, having worked with automakers such as Lexus, BMW, and Toyota.

The chain also runs major advertising campaigns, including in-print ads in Chinese-language newspapers such as &quot;World Journal&quot; and radio ads on Chinese-language radio in Southern California.

==Regional monikers==

In Northern California, 99 Ranch is known as &quot;Ranch 99&quot; because the 99 Ranch signs in the bay area have the &quot;99&quot; part of the logo located between &quot;Ranch&quot; and &quot;Market&quot;.

<doc id="443983" wikidata="Q3032" url="?curid=443983" title="Darwin Harbour">
<text>Darwin Harbour is a body of water close to the city of Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is the traditional waterways of the Larrakia people.

It opens to the north at a line from Charles Point in the west to Lee Point in the east into the Beagle Gulf and connects via the Clarence Strait with the Van Diemen Gulf. It contains Port Darwin, which is flanked by Frances Bay to the east and Cullen Bay to the west. 

== History ==
The Larrakia people are the Traditional Owners of Darwin Harbour who used canoes to navigate its waterway for fishing, trading and cultural purposes.

Despite having never visited the area, Darwin Harbour was named after naturalist Charles Darwin. It was named by his friend and former shipmate Lieutenant John Lort Stokes during &#x27;s third expedition on 9 September 1839.

Ships in Darwin Harbour were heavily bombed by the Japanese during World War II in February 1942, leaving numerous wrecks that were eventually salvaged up in the 1960s.

== Climate ==
The climate of the Darwin Harbour region is monsoon tropical with two distinct seasons: the Dry and the Wet. The Dry lasts for 6 months between April and September with an average rainfall of 24 mm, whereas the Wet lasts between October and March with an average monthly rainfall of 254 mm/month (according to the Bureau of Meteorology, 1999). The majority of the rain falls between December and April. Runoff varies between 250–1000 mm. Riverine discharge is relatively low with the exception of the Blackmore River and Elizabeth River. Peak flow for these rivers occurs in February, respectively 605Ml/day and 389 Ml/day, after which it slowly decreases until July when there is no freshwater input into Darwin Harbour until the onset of the following wet season (Padovan 1997). Cyclone frequency is low to moderate.

== Marine life ==
Darwin Harbour supports very high fish diversity with 415 fish species now known. Darwin Harbour provides a unique opportunity to see dugongs in the wild, because their
favourite food is located off Casuarina and Bundilla (formerly Vesteys) beaches. Seagrass meadows are also the main diet of green turtles and provide habitats for many smaller marine animals including commercially important species such as prawns and fish.

==Oceanography==
=== Currents ===
The tides at Port Darwin are macro-tidal with a maximum tidal range of 7.8 m, a mean spring range of 5.5 m and a mean neap range of 1.9 m (Padovan, 1997). The currents caused by these tides are complex and strong.

=== Estuaries ===

Darwin Harbour is a drowned river valley and consist of ria shorelines and extensive headlands.

===Catchment===
The catchment of Darwin Harbour occupies a total area of approximately , of this is land based and the other are estuarine areas at the high water mark.

=== Geology ===
The underlying lithology is dominated by Permian siltstones and sandstones.

==Administrative status==
On 4 April 2007, the remainder of Darwin Harbour which was not already part of a suburb or a locality within the boundaries of either of the two local government areas, the City of Darwin and the Litchfield Municipality, was gazetted by the Northern Territory Government as a locality with the name, Darwin Harbour. Its north-western boundary aligns with that of the boundary for the Port of Darwin which extends from Charles Point in the west to Lee Point in the east. The locality has not been added to any existing local government area and is considered to be part of the Northern Territory&#x27;s unincorporated areas.

<text>Canandaigua Lake is the fourth largest of the Finger Lakes in the U.S. state of New York. The City of Canandaigua is located at the northern end of the lake and the village of Naples is several miles south of the southern end. It is the westernmost of the major Finger Lakes.

The name Canandaigua is derived from the Seneca name spelled variously Kanandarque, Ganondagan, Ga-nun-da-gwa, or in a modern transcription, &quot;tganǫdæ:gwęh&quot;, which means &quot;the chosen spot&quot;, or &quot;at the chosen town&quot;.

==Description==
Canandaigua Lake is long, wide, and has a shoreline of . Near the northern end is Skenoh Island. About fifty percent of the surrounding land is in forest, but most of the remainder is under cultivation. Of of shoreline, (97%) are private and (3%) are public.

Canandaigua Lake is known for its water quality. The lake is the sole source of drinking water for the town and city of Canandaigua, located on the northern end of the lake, in addition to serving the communities of Rushville, Newark, Canandaigua, Palmyra, and Gorham township as their main public supplier of water. In April 2013 and 2017, the drinking water was entered into a competition held by the New York section of American Water Works Association, in which it was voted the best drinking water in New York State. The lake&#x27;s water is well-oxygenated, allowing fish to live in both shallow and deep areas. The water is also very clear, allowing visibility of the bottom up to below the surface.

===Skenoh Island===

Skenoh Island, formerly known as Squaw Island, is located at the north end of the lake. It is the smallest Fish and Wildlife Management Area in New York State and one of only two islands in the eleven Finger Lakes. The Seneca recall that the island was used to hide the Seneca women and children during the Sullivan Expedition against the Six Nations of the Iroquois in 1779. The island exhibits an extremely rare form of carbonate of lime forms deposits on pebbles (conglomerate). It is a feathery light rock which is calcified from algae filtered by sand and pond scum. The rock, locally called &quot;water biscuits&quot;, is hard in the water but crumbles if allowed to dry out. In recent years the island has been eroding rapidly from the forces of ice, wind, water currents and development changing the wave patterns.

In 1977, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation installed a cedar log buffer around the island to help preserve it. Its size, approximately in 1853, shrank by 75% in 162 years, to about in 1971. Today only by of the island remains. A newly formed group called the Squaw Island Preservation Society has raised citizen support to protect the island and its unique place in science and local history, after state officials said they would no longer maintain it. Work on the preservation was completed in Summer 2001.

As with other places with &quot;squaw&quot; in the name, efforts began in the 21st century to have the name changed, since the use of the term is seen as insensitive. These efforts became successful with the announcement in October 2021 that the U.S. Board on Geographic Names had approved the name &quot;Skenoh Island&quot;, effective immediately, based on recommendations from the New York State Geographic Names Committee, the New York State Museum and the Commissioner of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. The word &quot;skenoh&quot; translates to &quot;health&quot; or &quot;peace&quot; in the Seneca language.

==History==
The first steamboat in the Finger Lakes region was the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which was launched in 1825. Canandaigua Lake&#x27;s steamboat era ran from 1827 with the launching of the &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot; and ended in 1935 when the &quot;Idler&quot; discontinued passenger service. There were fourteen major boats that provided commercial service on Canandaigua Lake. Today, the &quot;Canandaigua Lady&quot;, a 19th-century replica of a double-decked paddleboat, continues this tradition.

The Native Americans and white settlers signed the Treaty of Canandaigua just north of the lake. This parchment, which is in the Memorial Museum, has the names of a number of famous Indian chiefs including Red Jacket, Cornplanter, Handsome Lake, Farmer&#x27;s Brother, and Fish Carrier.

The lake is a popular second home destination for families from nearby Rochester, New York, as well as other parts of the Northeast.

==Points of interest==
*Canandaigua Lake State Marine Park is located in the City of Canandaigua on the lake&#x27;s north end. It offers a boat launch for powerboats and fishing access from May to mid-October.
*Sonnenberg Gardens and Mansion State Historic Park is located near the north end of the lake.
*County Road 12 into Naples (town), New York at the south end of the lake, which is known for its views of the lake and is a favorite of fall travelers. Also along the road is the new South Bristol Overlook.
*The Canandaigua Wine Trail, which is a collection of wineries, breweries, bed &amp; breakfasts, hotels, attractions, shops, and restaurants around Canandaigua Lake.
*The &quot;Canandaigua Lady&quot;, a double-decker paddle wheel boat and steamboat replica that offers public cruises on Canandaigua Lake from May through October.
*Fishing is widely popular. The lake is home to a few species of salmonids (lake trout, brown trout, rainbow trout), largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, chain pickerel, and panfish, including yellow perch, blue gills, pumpkinseed, rock bass, black crappie and bullheads. Carp can be found near public access points and close to stream beds filtering into the lake. Bowfishing and spearfishing is strictly prohibited on the lake. Fisherman can sometimes be seen hooking mudpuppies, a large member of the salamander family that live their lives entirely underwater and feed on crayfish, small fish, and snails. They can grow to up to in length and have gills that protrude from outside of their bodies.
*Four public access points are located on Canandaigua Lake.
*Five full-service marinas are located on Canandaigua Lake and all offer service, sales, rentals, docking facilities, and storage. Sutter&#x27;s Marina and Seager Marine are located at the north end, German Brothers Marina on the west side of the lake, Canandaigua Boatworks on the east side of the lake, and Smith Boys at the south end. Canandaigua Sailboard at the north end offers non-motorized watercraft options.

<doc id="443986" wikidata="Q4651987" url="?curid=443986" title="AIROS Native Radio Network">
<text>American Indian Radio on Satellite or AIROS was a service that transmitted Native American radio programs between producers and radio stations via satellite. It also distributed radio programming directly to listeners via the Internet. Its satellite service ran from 1994 to 2006. It was operated by Native American Public Telecommunications.

== Programming ==
AIROS carried a variety of Native American radio programming, including news and music. Although primarily a distributor, it produced some of its own programming.

Two of the programs AIROS carried have become among the longest-running Native American radio programs. The music program &quot;Native Sounds Native Voices&quot; originated in the studios of KZUM. It was first broadcast in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1994. &quot;Native American Calling&quot; is a call-in talk show. AIROS carried its national premiere on June 5, 1995. Initially, it was jointly produced by AIROS and the Alaska Public Radio Network and originated from the studios of KUNM, Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 2001, the New York Times described &quot;Native American Calling&quot; as very popular. By 2006, it was produced by Koahnic and was one of the best-known Native American radio programs.

== Distribution ==
In the 1990s, satellite communications were considered especially useful for reaching radio stations in remote locations that did not have access to services like special high-quality telephone lines or the Internet. AIROS started its satellite distribution network in 1994. AIROS used the Public Radio Satellite System. As a result, its programming was available to public radio stations across the United States, not just Native American stations. The number of stations AIROS served grew from 29 in 1995 to 50 in 2000 and 77 in 2001, including Native American and other stations in the United States and Canada. In 2001, the New York Times described AIROS as the &quot;primary distribution system for (Native American) public radio&quot;. AIROS satellite operations ended in 2006, when Koahnic won the contract to distribute Native American programming over the Public Radio Satellite System.

By 2014, Koahnic&#x27;s Native Voice One and Radio Bilingüe were the two indigenous radio networks in the United States. Like AIROS, both used the Public Radio Satellite System.

AIROS also used the Internet to connect producers, radio broadcasters and listeners. In 1997, AIROS initiated webcasts, reaching the large urban Native American population out of reach of Native American radio stations. AIROS claimed it had one of the first web sites to provide live-streaming. Broadcast stations continued to be the primary means of reaching American Indians on reservations lacking reliable Internet. AIROS live streaming ended in December 2010. Podcasts continued for a few more years.

<doc id="443995" wikidata="Q624242" url="?curid=443995" title="Heliconia">
<text>Heliconia is a genus of flowering plants in the monotypic family Heliconiaceae. Most of the 194 known species are native to the tropical Americas, but a few are indigenous to certain islands of the western Pacific and Maluku in Indonesia. Many species of &quot;Heliconia&quot; are found in the tropical forests of these regions. Most species are listed as either vulnerable or data deficient by the IUCN Red List of threatened species. Several species are widely cultivated as ornamentals, and a few are naturalized in Florida, Gambia, and Thailand.

Common names for the genus include lobster-claws, toucan beak, wild plantain, or false bird-of-paradise; the last term refers to their close similarity to the bird-of-paradise flowers in the &quot;Strelitzia&quot; genus. Collectively, these plants are also simply referred to as &quot;heliconias&quot;.

&quot;Heliconia&quot; originated in the Late Eocene (39 Ma) and are the oldest known clade of hummingbird-pollinated plants.

==Description==
These herbaceous plants range from 0.5 to nearly 4.5 m (1.5–15 ft) tall, depending on the species.

=== Leaves ===
The simple leaves of these plants are 15–300 cm (6 in–10 ft). They are characteristically long, oblong, alternate, or growing opposite one another on nonwoody petioles often longer than the leaf, often forming large clumps with age. The leaves in different positions on the plant have a different absorption potential of sunlight for photosynthesis when exposed to different degrees of sunlight. They also look like lobster claws.

=== Flower ===

Their flowers are produced on long, erect or drooping panicles, and consist of brightly colored, waxy bracts, with small true flowers peeping out from the bracts. The growth habit of heliconias is similar to &quot;Canna&quot;, &quot;Strelitzia&quot;, and bananas, to which they are related. The flowers can be hues of reds, oranges, yellows, and greens, and are subtended by brightly colored bracts.

The flowers&#x27; shape often limits pollination to a subset of the hummingbirds in the region. They also produce ample nectar that attract these birds.

=== Seeds ===
Fruits are blue-purple when ripe and primarily bird dispersed. Studies of post-dispersal seed survival showed that seed size was not a determinant. The highest amount of seed predation came from mammals.

== Taxonomy ==
The generic name Heliconia was given by Carl Linnaeus in 1771 from the Greek word &quot;Helikṓnios&quot; from &quot;Helikṓn&quot; after Mount Helicon in Boeotia, central Greece.

&quot;Heliconia&quot; is the only genus in the monotypic family Heliconiaceae, but was formerly included in the family Musaceae, which includes the bananas (e.g. &quot; Musa&quot;, &quot;Ensete&quot; and so on). However, the APG system of 1998, and its successor, the APG II system of 2003, confirm the Heliconiaceae as distinct and places them in the order Zingiberales, in the commelinid clade of monocots.


==Species==
Species accepted by Kew Botanic Gardens
== Distribution and habitat ==
Most of the 194 known species are native to the tropical Americas, but a few are indigenous to certain islands of the western Pacific and Maluku. Many species of &quot;Heliconia&quot; are found in the tropical forests of these regions. Several species are widely cultivated as ornamentals, and a few are naturalized in Florida, Gambia and Thailand.

== Ecology ==

Heliconias are an important food source for forest hummingbirds, especially the hermits (Phathornithinae), some of which – such as the rufous-breasted hermit (&quot;Glaucis hirsuta&quot;) – also use the plant for nesting. The Honduran white bat (&quot;Ectophylla alba&quot;) also lives in tents it makes from heliconia leaves.

=== Bats ===
==== Pollination ====
Although &quot;Heliconia&quot; are almost exclusively pollinated by hummingbirds, some bat pollination has been found to occur. &quot;Heliconia solomonensis&quot; is pollinated by the macroglosine bat (&quot;Melonycteris woodfordi&quot;) in the Solomon Islands. &quot;Heliconia solomonensis&quot; has green inflorescences and flowers that open at night, which is typical of bat pollinated plants. The macroglosine bat is the only known nocturnal pollinator of &quot;Heliconia solomonensis&quot;.

==== Habitat ====
Many bats use Heliconia leaves for shelter. The Honduran white bat, &quot;Ectohylla alba&quot;, utilizes five species of &quot;Heliconia&quot; to make diurnal tent-shaped roosts. The bat cuts the side veins of the leaf extending from the midrib, causing the leaf to fold like a tent. This structure provides the bat with shelter from rain, sun, and predators. In addition, the stems of the &quot;Heliconia&quot; leaves are not strong enough to carry the weight of typical bat predators, so shaking of the leaf alerts roosting bats to presence of predators. The bats &quot;Artibeus anderseni&quot; and &quot;A. phaeotis&quot; form tents from the leaves of &quot;Heliconia&quot; in the same manner as the Honduran white bat. The neotropical disk-winged bat, &quot;Thyroptera tricolor&quot;, has suction disks on the wrists which allow it to cling to the smooth surfaces of the &quot;Heliconia&quot; leaves. This bat roosts head-up in the rolled young leaves of Heliconia plants.

===Insects===

Heliconias provide shelter for a diverse range of insects within their young rolled leaves and water-filled floral bracts. Insects that inhabit the rolled leaves often feed upon the inner surfaces of the leaf, such as beetles of the family Chrysomelidae. In bracts containing small amounts of water, fly larvae and beetles are the dominant inhabitants. In bracts with greater quantities of water the typical inhabitants are mosquito larva. Insects living in the bracts often feed on the bract tissue, nectar of the flower, flower parts, other insects, microorganisms, or detritus in the water contained in the bract (Siefert 1982). Almost all species of Hispini beetles that use rolled leaves are obligate herbivores of plants of the order of Zingiberales, which includes &quot;Heliconia&quot;. These beetles live in and feed from the rolled leaf, the stems, the inflorescences, or the unfurled mature leaves of the &quot;Heliconia&quot; plant. In addition, these beetles deposit their eggs on the leaf surface, petioles of immature leaves, or in the bracts of the &quot;Heliconia&quot;. Furthermore, some wasp species such as &quot;Polistes erythrocephalus&quot; build their nest on the protected underside of large leaves.

===Hummingbirds===
Hummingbirds are the main pollinators of heliconia flowers in many locations. The concurrent diversification of hummingbird-pollinated taxa in the order Zingiberales and the hummingbird family (Trochilidae: Phaethorninae) starting 18 million years ago supports the idea that these radiations have influenced one another through evolutionary time. At La Selva Research Station in Costa Rica, specific species of &quot;Heliconia&quot; were found to have specific hummingbird pollinators. These hummingbirds can be organized into two different groups: hermits and non-hermits. Hermits are the subfamily Phaethornithinae, consisting of the genera &quot;Anopetia, Eutoxeres, Glaucis, Phaethornis, Ramphodon,&quot; and &quot;Threnetes&quot;. Non-hermits are a catch-all group of other hummingbirds that often visit heliconias, comprising several clades (McGuire 2008). Hermits are generally traplining foragers; that is, individuals visit a repeated circuit of high-reward flowers instead of holding fixed territories Non-hermits are territorial over their &quot;Heliconia&quot; clumps, causing greater self-pollination. Hermits tend to have long curved bills while non-hermits tend to possess short straight bills, a morphological difference that likely spurred the divergence of these groups in the Miocene era. Characteristics of &quot;Heliconia&quot; flowers that select for either hermit or non-hermit pollinator specificity are degree of self-compatibility, flowering phenology, nectar production, color, and shape of flower. The hummingbird itself will choose the plants its feeds from on the basis of its beak shape, its perch on the plant, and its territory choice.

Hummingbird visits to the &quot;Heliconia&quot; flower do not affect its production of nectar. This may account for the flowers not having a consistent amount of nectar produced from flower to flower.

Different &quot;Heliconia&quot; species have different flowering seasons. This suggests that the species compete for pollinators. Many species of &quot;Heliconia&quot;, even the newly colonized species, are visited by many different pollinators.

== Cultivation ==

Several cultivars and hybrids have been selected for garden planting, including:
* &quot;H. psittacorum&quot; × &quot;H. spathocircinata&quot;, both species of South America, mainly Brazil
* &quot;H. × rauliniana&quot; = &quot;H. marginata&quot; (Venezuela) × &quot;H. bihai&quot; (Brazil)
* &quot;H. chartacea&quot; cv. &#x27;Sexy Pink&#x27;

Most commonly grown landscape &quot;Heliconia&quot; species include &quot;H. augusta, H. bihai, H. brasiliensis, H. caribaea, H. latispatha, H. pendula, H. psittacorum, H. rostrata, H. schiediana, &quot;and&quot; H. wagneriana&quot;.

== Uses ==

Heliconias are grown for the florist&#x27;s trade and as landscape plants. These plants do not grow well in cold, dry conditions. They are very drought intolerant, but can endure some soil flooding. Heliconias need an abundance of water, sunlight, and soils that are rich in humus in order to grow well. These flowers are grown in tropical regions all over the world as ornamental plants. The flower of &quot;H. psittacorum&quot; (parrot heliconia) is especially distinctive, its greenish-yellow flowers with black spots and red bracts reminiscent of the bright plumage of parrots.

<text>The Leyland cypress, Cupressus&quot; × &quot;leylandii, × Cuprocyparis leylandii or × Cupressocyparis leylandii, often referred to simply as leylandii, is a fast-growing coniferous evergreen tree much used in horticulture, primarily for hedges and screens. Even on sites of relatively poor culture, plants have been known to grow to heights of in 16 years. Their rapid, thick growth means they are sometimes used to achieve privacy, but such use can result in disputes with neighbours whose own property becomes overshadowed. The tree is a hybrid of Monterey cypress (&quot;Cupressus macrocarpa&quot;) and Nootka cypress (&quot;Cupressus nootkatensis&quot;). It is almost always sterile, and is propagated mainly by cuttings.

==History==

In 1845, the Leighton Hall, Powys estate was purchased by the Liverpool banker Christopher Leyland. In 1847, he gave it to his nephew John Naylor (1813–1889). Naylor commissioned Edward Kemp to lay out the gardens, which included redwoods, monkey puzzle trees and two North American species of conifers in close proximity to each other – Monterey cypress and Nootka cypress. The two parent species would not likely cross in the wild, as their natural ranges are more than apart, but in 1888, the hybrid cross occurred when the female flowers or cones of Nootka cypress were fertilised by pollen from Monterey cypress.

John Naylor&#x27;s eldest son Christopher John (1849–1926) inherited Leighton Hall from his father in 1889. Christopher was a sea captain by trade. In 1891, he inherited the Leyland Entailed Estates established under the will of his great-great-uncle, which passed to him following the death of his uncle Thomas Leyland. On receiving the inheritance, Christopher changed his surname to Leyland, and moved to Haggerston Castle, Northumberland. He further developed the hybrid at his new home, and hence named the first clone variant &#x27;Haggerston Grey&#x27;. His younger brother John (1856–1906) resultantly inherited Leighton Hall, and when in 1911 the reverse hybrid of the cones of the Monterey cypress were fertilised with pollen from the Nootka, that hybrid was baptised &#x27;Leighton Green.&#x27;

The hybrid has since arisen on nearly 20 separate occasions, always by open pollination, showing the two species are readily compatible and closely related. As a hybrid, although fertility of certain Leyland cypress forms were recently reported, most Leyland cypress were thought to be sterile, and nearly all the trees now seen have resulted from cuttings originating from those few plants. Over 40 forms of Leyland cypress are known, and as well as &#x27;Haggerston Grey&#x27; and &#x27;Leighton Green&#x27;, other well-known forms include &#x27;Stapehill&#x27;, which was discovered in 1940 in a garden in Ferndown, Dorset by M. Barthelemy and &#x27;Castlewellan&#x27;, which originated from a single mutant tree in the Castlewellan estate arboretum in Northern Ireland. This form, widely propagated from the 1970s, was selected by the park director, John Keown, and was named &quot;Cupressus macrocarpa&quot; &#x27;Keownii&#x27;, 1963.

==Description==
A large, evergreen tree, &quot;Cupressus&quot; × &quot;leylandii&quot; reaches a size between 20 and 25 m high, with its leaves giving it a compact, thick and regular habit. It grows very fast with yearly increases of 1 m. The leaves, about 1 mm long and close to the twig, are presented in flaky, slightly aromatic branches. They are dark green, somewhat paler on the underside, but can have different colors, depending on the cultivar. The crown of many forms is broadly columnar with slightly overhanging branch tips. The branches are slightly flattened and densely populated with scaly needles. The tree bark is dark red or brown and has deep grooves.

The seeds are found in cones about 2 cm in length, with eight scales and five seeds with tiny resinous vesicles. With the tree being a hybrid, its seeds are sterile. Over time, the cones shrink dry and turn gray or chocolate brown and then have a diameter of 1 cm.

==Taxonomic status==

&quot;Cupressus&quot; × &quot;leylandii&quot; is a hybrid of two other cypress species: Monterey cypress (&quot;Cupressus macrocarpa&quot;) and Nootka cypress (&quot;Cupressus nootkatensis&quot;). The taxonomic status of Nootka cypress has changed over time, and this has affected the taxonomic status of the hybrid. Nootka cypress was first regarded as belonging in the genus &quot;Cupressus&quot;, but was later placed in &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot;. It has become clear, however, that when the genus &quot;Cupressus&quot; is defined to include &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot;, it is paraphyletic unless it also includes &quot;Juniperus&quot;. In 2004, Little et al. transferred the Nootka cypress to &quot;Callitropsis&quot;. Little (2006) proposed another alternative by transferring all the North American species of &quot;Cupressus&quot;, including the Monterey cypress (&quot;C. macrocarpa&quot;), to &quot;Callitropsis&quot;.

In some of these classifications, this and other hybrids of Nootka cypress become very unusual in being intergeneric hybrids, the only ones ever reported among the gymnosperms. In 2010, Mao et al. performed a more detailed molecular analysis and redefined &quot;Cupressus&quot; to exclude &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot;, but to include the Nootka cypress. It may be added that attempts to cross Nootka cypress with other &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot; species have been universally unsuccessful. The scientific name of Leyland cypress depends on the taxonomic treatment of Nootka cypress. Where Nootka cypress is considered as &quot;Cupressus nootkatensis&quot;, the hybrid is within the &quot;Cupressus&quot; genus and is therefore &quot;Cupressus&quot; × &quot;leylandii&quot;. If both Monterey and Nootka cypress are considered as species of &quot;Callitropsis&quot;, the hybrid is &quot;Callitropsis&quot; × &quot;leylandii&quot;. However where the parents are treated as being in different genera, Leyland cypress becomes an intergeneric hybrid: if Nootka cypress is within &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot;, the name of the hybrid becomes ×&quot;Cupressocyparis leylandii&quot;, and where it is treated as &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot;, the hybrid becomes ×&quot;Cuprocyparis leylandii&quot;.

Two other similar hybrids have also been raised, both involving Nootka cypress with other &quot;Cupressus&quot; species:&lt;br&gt;
:&quot;Cupressus arizonica&quot; var. &quot;glabra&quot; × &quot;Cupressus nootkatensis&quot; (&quot;Cupressus&quot; × &quot;notabilis&quot;)
:&quot;Cupressus lusitanica&quot; × &quot;Cupressus nootkatensis&quot; (&quot;Cupressus&quot; × &quot;ovensii&quot;)

==Adaptation==
Leyland cypress is light-demanding, but is tolerant of high levels of pollution and salt spray. A hardy, fast-growing natural hybrid, it thrives on a variety of soils, and sites are commonly planted in gardens to provide a quick boundary or shelter hedge, because of their rapid growth. Although widely used for screening, it has not been planted much for forestry purposes. In both forms of the hybrid, Leyland cypress combines the hardiness of the Nootka or Alaska cypress with the fast growth of the Monterey cypress.

The tallest Leyland cypress documented is about tall and still growing. However, because their roots are relatively shallow, a large leylandii tends to topple over. The shallow root structure also means that it is poorly adapted to areas with hot summers, such as the southern half of the United States. In these areas, it is prone to develop cypress canker disease, which is caused by the fungus &quot;Seiridium cardinale&quot;. Canker causes extensive dieback and ultimately kills the tree. In California&#x27;s Central Valley, they rarely live more than 10 years before succumbing, and not much longer in southern states like Alabama. In these areas, the canker-resistant Arizona cypress is much more successful. In northern areas where heavy snows occur, this plant is also susceptible to broken branches and uprooting in wet, heavy snow. The tree has also been introduced in Kenya on parts of Mount Kenya.

The sap can cause skin irritation in susceptible individuals.

==Commercialization==

In 1925, a firm of commercial nurserymen specialising in conifers were looking for a breed that was fast-growing, and could be deployed in barren, windy and salty areas such as Cornwall. Eventually they found the six original trees developed by Leyland, and began propagating the species. In 1953, a freak tornado blew down one of the original trees at Haggerston (the other original five trees still survive), on which the research division of the Forestry Commission started developing additional hybrids. Commercial nurseries spotted the plant&#x27;s potential, and for many years, it was the biggest-selling item in every garden centre in Great Britain, making up to 10% of their total sales.

==Uses==
They continue to be popular for cultivation in parks and gardens. Leyland cypress trees are commonly planted to quickly form fence or protection hedges. However, their rapid growth (up to 1 m per year), their thick shade and their large potential size (often more than 20 m high in garden conditions, and they can reach at least 35 m) make them problematic.

==Cultivars==
The cultivar &#x27;Gold Rider&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017), though the original hybrid has now lost its AGM status.

Other cultivars include &#x27;Douglas Gold&#x27;, &#x27;Leighton Green&#x27;, &#x27;Drabb&#x27;, &#x27;Haggerston Grey&#x27;, &#x27;Emerald Isle&#x27;, &#x27;Ferndown&#x27;, &#x27;Golconda&#x27;, &#x27;Golden Sun&#x27;, &#x27;Gold Rider&#x27;, &#x27;Grecar&#x27;, &#x27;Green Spire&#x27;, &#x27;Grelive&#x27;, Haggerston 3, Haggerston 4, Haggerston 5, Haggerston 6, &#x27;Harlequin&#x27;, &#x27;Herculea&#x27;, &#x27;Hyde Hall&#x27;, &#x27;Irish Mint&#x27;, &#x27;Jubilee&#x27;, &#x27;Medownia&#x27;, &#x27;Michellii&#x27;, &#x27;Moncal&#x27;, &#x27;Naylor&#x27;s Blue&#x27;, &#x27;New Ornament&#x27;, &#x27;Olive&#x27;s Green&#x27;, &#x27;Robinson&#x27;s Gold&#x27;, &#x27;Rostrevor&#x27;, &#x27;Silver Dust&#x27;, &#x27;Variegata&#x27;, &#x27;Ventose&#x27;, and &#x27;Winter Sun&#x27;.

==Legal aspects==
The plant&#x27;s rapid growth and great potential height can become a serious problem. In 2005 in the United Kingdom, an estimated 17,000 households were involved in disputes over the height of garden hedges. Such disputes between neighbours have been known to deteriorate into violence and in at least one case, culminate in murder when in 2001, retired Environment Agency officer Llandis Burdon, 57, was shot dead after an alleged dispute over a &quot;leylandii&quot; hedge in Talybont-on-Usk, Powys.

Part VIII of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003, introduced in 2005, gave a way for people in England and Wales affected by high hedges (usually, but not necessarily, of &quot;leylandii&quot;) to ask their local authority to investigate complaints about the hedges, and gave the authorities in England and Wales power to have the hedges reduced in height. In May 2008, UK resident Christine Wright won a 24-year legal battle to have her neighbour&#x27;s leylandii trees cut down for blocking sunlight to her garden.

Legislation with similar effect followed in Northern Ireland, Isle of Man and Scotland.

<text>Alstroemeria (), commonly called the Peruvian lily or lily of the Incas, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Alstroemeriaceae. They are all native to South America, although some have become naturalized in the United States, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Madeira and the Canary Islands. Almost all of the species are restricted to one of two distinct centers of diversity: one in central Chile and southern Argentina, the other in eastern Brazil. Species of &quot;Alstroemeria&quot; from Patagonia are winter-growing plants, while those of Brazil are summer growing. All are long-lived perennials except &quot;A. graminea&quot;, a diminutive annual from the Atacama Desert of Chile.

== Description ==
Plants of this genus grow from a cluster of tubers. They send up fertile and sterile stems, the fertile stems of some species reaching in height. The leaves are alternately arranged and resupinate, twisted on the petioles so that the undersides face up. The leaves are variable in shape and the blades have smooth edges. The flowers are solitary or borne in umbels. The flower has six petals each up to long. They come in many shades of red, orange, yellow, green, purple, pink, and white, flecked and striped and streaked with darker colors. There are six curving stamens. The stigma has three lobes. The fruit is a capsule with three valves. Alstroemeria are classified as an inferior monocot, meaning the petals are located above the ovary and the leaf veins are parallel.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The genus &quot;Alstroemeria&quot; is exclusively native to South America, with various species found ranging from Venezuela (3° north of the Equator), to Tierra del Fuego, Argentina (53° South). Within this range of the entire genus, two centers of species diversity are recognized, one in Brazil and one in Chile.

In Chile, &quot;Alstroemeria&quot; is amongst the most diverse genera of vascular monocotyledons, with more than 50 recognized or accepted taxa (species, subspecies and varieties). Of these taxa, roughly 80% are endemic to the Mediterranean matorral zone of central Chile.

In Brazil, which is home to more than 40 species, most &quot;Alstroemeria&quot; species are found outside of the Amazonian region, and are concentrated towards the south and east of the country. &quot;Alstroemeria&quot; can be found in almost all types of habitat, from forests to savannahs, caatingas to swamps, and commonly, high altitude grasslands and rocky outcrops, with typical altitudes ranging from 300m in the Amazon, to 2300m in the Itatiaia National Park. Most Brazilian species have relatively restricted distributions.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus was described by Johan Peter Falk and his thesis supervisor Carl Linnaeus in his 1762 dissertation &quot;Planta Alströmeria&quot;. Linnaeus bears the botanical authority (L.).

=== Etymology ===
The genus was named after the Swedish baron Clas Alströmer (1736–1794), a friend of Linnaeus.

== Cultivation and uses ==
Many hybrids and at least 190 cultivars have been developed, featuring many markings and colors, including white, yellow, orange, apricot, pink, red, purple, and lavender. The most popular and showy hybrids commonly grown today result from crosses between species from Chile (winter-growing) with species from Brazil (summer-growing). This strategy has overcome the florists&#x27; problem of seasonal dormancy and resulted in plants that are evergreen, or nearly so, and flower for most of the year. This breeding work derives mainly from trials that began in the United States in the 1980s; the main breeding is done nowadays by companies in the Netherlands. The flower, which resembles a miniature lily, is very popular for bouquets and flower arrangements in the commercial cut flower trade. These delicate flowers survive up to 14 days in water without any signs of shrivelling.

Most cultivars available for the home garden will bloom in the late spring and early summer. The roots are hardy to a temperature of . The plant requires at least six hours of morning sunlight, regular water, and well-drained soil.

===AGM cultivars===
The following cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit, all with a hardiness rating of H4 (Hardy – average winter ) apart from &#x27;Friendship&#x27; (H5: Hardy – cold winter ):
* &#x27;Apollo&#x27; (white/yellow flowers, 100 cm)
* &#x27;Cahors&#x27; (pink/yellow, 90 cm)

* &#x27;Coronet&#x27; (salmon/yellow flowers, 140 cm)
* &#x27;Friendship&#x27; (yellow flushed pink, 100 cm)
* &#x27;Orange Glory&#x27; (150 cm)
* &#x27;Oriana&#x27; (salmon/yellow, 50 cm)
* &#x27;Phoenix&#x27; (red/yellow, 100 cm)
* &#x27;Red Elf&#x27; (100 cm)
* &#x27;Sirius&#x27; (pink/yellow, 100 cm)
* &#x27;Sonata&#x27; (red/yellow, 100 cm)

* &#x27;Tessa&#x27; (red flowers, 120 cm)
* &#x27;Yellow Friendship&#x27; (140 cm)
==Ecology==
Some alstroemerias have escaped cultivation and become weeds, such as &quot;Alstroemeria pulchella&quot;. and &quot;A. aurea&quot;, which are now weeds in Australia.

<text>Joanna Clare MacGregor (born 16 July 1959) is a British concert pianist, conductor, composer, and festival curator. She is Head of Piano at the Royal Academy of Music and a professor of the University of London. She was artistic director of the International Summer School &amp; Festival at Dartington Hall from 2015 to 2019.

==Biography==
MacGregor grew up in North London, and was educated at home, with her brother and sister, by her parents; she won a free place to South Hampstead High School at the age of 11. Her mother is a piano teacher and taught her when she was a young child, and her father worked in the printing trade. MacGregor began studying with Christopher Elton at the age of seventeen, and read music at New Hall (now Murray Edwards College, Cambridge) (1978–81) where she was taught composition by Hugh Wood. After Cambridge, she pursued postgraduate studies at the Royal Academy of Music. She became Head of Piano at the Royal Academy of Music in 2011.

In the early years of her performing career, MacGregor was a prolific composer for the theatre (including work for &quot;Cheek by Jowl&quot;, and Oxford Stage Company&#x27;s production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; at Elsinore Castle and the Edinburgh Festival). She was one of the first artists to be selected for the Young Concert Artists Trust in 1985, and has since performed in more than seventy countries, appearing as a solo artist with many of the world&#x27;s leading orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic, London Symphony Orchestra, Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra, Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Berlin Symphony Orchestra, London Philharmonia, Melbourne Symphony and Sydney Symphony Orchestras, Hong Kong Philharmonic, BBC Symphony and Salzburg Camerata.

The conductors with whom she has worked include Pierre Boulez, Sir Simon Rattle, Sir Colin Davis, Michael Tilson Thomas, and Valery Gergiev, and she has appeared in many of the world&#x27;s greatest venues, including the Wigmore Hall, Southbank Centre and the Barbican in London, Sydney Opera House, New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center, Leipzig Gewandhaus, the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam and the Mozarteum in Salzburg.

Between 1997 and 2000, MacGregor was Professor of Music at Gresham College, London, giving free public lectures. She was appointed as Professor of Performance at Liverpool Hope University in 2007.

==Repertoire==
MacGregor is particularly known for her Bach interpretations and recordings, and was invited by Sir John Eliot Gardiner to perform the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall in April 2013. She is also currently performing the complete Mozart concertos and Beethoven sonatas, and performed the complete Chopin Mazurkas to widespread acclaim in 2010. Alongside core piano repertoire, she has premiered many landmark compositions – including piano concertos by Sir Harrison Birtwistle, Django Bates, Hugh Wood, John Adams, Alasdair Nicolson, Jonathan Harvey and James MacMillan – and has commissioned over 100 new works.

==Conducting, curating and collaboration==
MacGregor made her conducting debut in 2002 and regularly directs her own orchestral projects, including an all-Mozart programme with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and Bach with the Hallé. She enjoys a close artistic partnership as conductor and performer with Britten Sinfonia, in programmes ranging from classical music to collaborations with jazz and world musicians, including Andy Sheppard, Seb Rochford, Nitin Sawhney and Arve Henriksen. In 2009 she opened the London Jazz Festival with Britten Sinfonia and Arabic singer and oud virtuoso Dhafer Youssef, hailed by &quot;The Times&quot; as &#x27;the future of music&#x27;. Their fifteen-year orchestral partnership has continued with tours in Europe and Latin America.

She created (with composer Alasdair Nicolson) the &quot;Platform Festival&quot; of contemporary and improvised music, which ran at the ICA in London from 1991 until 1993; a series of music events, &quot;SoundCircus&quot;, ranging from Elvis Costello and Courtney Pine to Ensemble Modern and Steve Reich, at Bridgewater Hall, Manchester (1997–99); a celebration of British contemporary music (featuring Tom Ades) for the New York Philharmonic (1999); and &quot;Cross Border&quot; with Jin Xing&#x27;s Contemporary Dance Theatre of Shanghai, combining Chinese traditional music with computer technology and film. &quot;Cross Border&quot; toured China in 2003.

From 2006 until 2012, MacGregor was the Artistic Director of the Bath International Music Festival, where alongside many classical artists, ensembles and orchestras, she commissioned Brian Eno, the writer and cultural historian Marina Warner, jazz and electronica artists, folk musician Kathryn Tickell, and poets Roger McGough and Michael Rosen. She instigated &quot;Party in the City&quot;, a massive, free event which takes over the whole city of Bath on the first Friday of the Festival; she also created the annual installation &quot;On the Edge of Life&quot;, bringing together visual artists, scientists, writers and musicians examining issues as diverse as premature birth, homelessness and child human rights.

In 2010, she curated the multi-arts festival Deloitte Ignite for the Royal Opera House, which included performances from the Royal Ballet and Phoenix Dance Theatre, Ex Cathedra, the aerialist Ilona Jäntti, Jah Wobble, Talvin Singh, and Tibetan Monks from Tashi Lumpo Monastery, as well as major installations from the Royal College of Art and the sculptural artist Alice Anderson.

In 2014, she was announced as Artistic Director for Dartington International Summer School and Festival. MacGregor&#x27;s fifth and last festival was held in 2019. Since 2020, the festival has been curated by Sara Mohr-Pietsch.

==Books and broadcasts==
In 1990 the BBC broadcast MacGregor&#x27;s radio play, &quot;Memoirs of an Amnesiac&quot;, about the life of Erik Satie, with Jim Broadbent. It was nominated for the Prix Italia.

Her series of colourful piano teaching books for children, &quot;Piano World&quot;, was published in May 2001 by Faber Music. The books feature storytelling, cartoons, games and include companion CDs, with music ranging from classical and jazz to gospel and hip hop. Her short piano piece, &quot;Lowside Blues&quot;, was chosen for the Associated Board Grade 7 piano exams, and became very popular with young pianists worldwide.

Recent compositions have included &quot;Lute Songs&quot; (2008) (based on the music of Dowland), and &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (2010), for piano and orchestra. In 2012 she revived and re-worked, with director Richard Williams, a popular adaption of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, for chamber ensemble and seven opera singers. It has toured extensively, and was chosen as her swansong at Bath International Music Festival.

MacGregor broadcasts regularly on television and radio; in 2012 she was the soloist in three BBC Proms, and her performance of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot; was broadcast live from the Albert Hall in 2013. She was the subject of an edition of &quot;The South Bank Show&quot; in December 2001 and presented her own series &quot;Strings, Bows, and Bellows&quot; for BBC television. She also filmed Bach&#x27;s &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; for BBC television, as well as appearing in the &quot;Great Composers&quot; Series.

==Honours and awards==
MacGregor has received honorary Fellowships from the Royal Academy of Music, Trinity College of Music, and Murray Edwards, Cambridge (New Hall). She has been awarded Honorary Doctorates from the University of St Andrews, the Open University, the University of Bath and Bath Spa University. MacGregor was appointed as Member of the Arts Council England in 1998 alongside Anish Kapoor, Brian McMaster, Anthony Gormley and Andrew Motion, leaving in 2004.

She was recognised for her innovation with a Royal Philharmonic Society award in 2003 for imaginative programming and tireless work in opening up music to new audiences. Other awards include European Encouragement Prize for Music 1995, NFMS Sir Charles Groves Award 1998, and South Bank Show Award for Classical Music 2000. MacGregor was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours, both for services to music.

==Recordings and SoundCircus label==
Between 1990 and 1995, MacGregor made more than 15 solo recordings with Collins Classics, ranging from Bach and Domenico Scarlatti to music by Ravel, Debussy, Ives, Bartók and Messiaen, as well as contemporary music.

In 1998, she launched her own record label SoundCircus in association with John L. Walters&#x27; Unknown Public. The label combines new recordings with re-releases of older recordings which MacGregor was able to reclaim after Collins Classics ceased trading. She now owns the copyright to all of her recorded material, and the label is now in partnership with Warner Classical and Jazz.

<doc id="444013" wikidata="Q3228829" url="?curid=444013" title="Jungle carbine">
<text>The Rifle No. 5 Mk I, commonly referred to as the &quot;jungle carbine&quot; for its use in jungle warfare throughout Asia, was a bolt action carbine derivative of the British Lee–Enfield No. 4 Mk I. It was developed per jungle fighting experiences in the Pacific War that led the British to decide &quot;a rifle shorter and lighter&quot; than the regular Lee–Enfield was critical for better mobility. Produced between March 1944 and December 1947. It notably saw widespread usage on various sides of postwar colonial conflicts such as the Indonesian National Revolution, Malayan Emergency, and Vietnam War well into the 1960s, with sporadic use reported to have continued in several secessionist wars such as the Bangladesh Liberation War and Bougainville conflict throughout the rest of the 20th century.

==Development==
Experience of jungle fighting in 1943 identified that mobility was critical and to that end the weight of equipment carried by the individual soldier needed to be reduced. The requirement for a rifle was a &quot;light handy weapon with good accuracy to 400 yards []&quot;

The first tests of the rifles took place in 1944 during which a flash hider was added. The rifle was officially introduced into service in September 1944 with 20,000 produced, and by end of 1944, 50,000 had been accepted for service.

==Design==
The No. 5 was about shorter and nearly a kilogram () lighter than the No. 4 from which it was derived. A number of &quot;lightening cuts&quot; were made to the receiver body and the barrel, the bolt knob drilled out, woodwork cut down to reduce weight and had other new features like a flash suppressor and a rubber buttpad to help absorb the increased recoil and to prevent slippage on the shooter&#x27;s clothing while aiming. Unlike modern recoil pads, the No. 5 buttpad significantly reduced the contact area with the user&#x27;s shoulder, increasing the amount of felt recoil of the firearm.
In official recoil tests, the No. 4 rifle yielded average free recoil energy and the No. 5 carbine . Of the No. 5 carbine&#x27;s extra recoil energy, was caused by adding the conical flash suppressor (muzzle shroud).
The No. 5 iron sight line was also derived from the No. 4 marks and featured a rear receiver aperture battle sight calibrated for with an additional ladder aperture sight that could be flipped up and was calibrated for in increments. It was used in the Far East and other jungle-type environments (hence the &quot;jungle carbine&quot; nickname) and was popular with troops because of its light weight (compared to the SMLE and Lee–Enfield No. 4 Mk I rifles then in service) and general ease of use, although there were some concerns from troops about the increased recoil due to the lighter weight.

Due to the large conical flash suppressor, the No 5 Mk I could only mount the No. 5 blade bayonet, which was also designed to serve as a combat knife if needed.

Several No. 5 Mk 2 versions of the rifle were proposed, including changes such as strengthening the action to enable grenade-firing, and mounting the trigger from the receiver instead of on the trigger guard, but none of them were ever put into production; there was never a No. 5 Mk 2 rifle in service. Similarly, a number of &quot;takedown&quot; models of No. 5 Mk I rifle intended for Airborne use were also trialed, but were not put into production.

=== &quot;Wandering zero&quot; ===
One of the complaints leveled against the No. 5 Mk I rifle by soldiers was that it had a &quot;wandering zero&quot; – i.e., the rifle could not be &quot;sighted in&quot; and then relied upon to shoot to the same point of impact later on. This condition is accurately referred to as an inability to zero. 

Tests conducted during the mid to late 1940s appeared to confirm that the rifle did have some accuracy issues, likely relating to the lightening cuts made in the receiver, combined with the presence of a flash suppressor on the end of the barrel. The British government officially declared the jungle carbine possessed faults &quot;inherent in the design&quot; and discontinued production at the end of 1947.

However, modern collectors and shooters have pointed out that no jungle carbine collector/shooter on any of the prominent internet military firearm collecting forums has reported a confirmed &quot;wandering zero&quot; on their No. 5 Mk I rifle, leading to speculation that the No. 5 Mk I may have been phased out largely because the British military did not want a bolt-action rifle when most of the other major militaries were switching over to semiautomatic rifles such as the M1 Garand, SKS, FN Model 1949 and MAS-49.

Nonetheless, it has also been pointed out by historians and collectors that the No. 5 Mk I must have had some fault not found with the No. 4 Lee–Enfield (from which the jungle carbine was derived), as the British military continued with manufacture and issue of the Lee–Enfield No. 4 Mk 2 rifle until 1957, before finally converting to the L1A1 SLR.

==Operational history==
The rifle was first issued to British airborne forces in Norway towards the end of the Second World War; these were troops that were likely to be sent to the Far East for an invasion of Japan.
The term was colloquial and never applied by the British Armed Forces, but the Rifle No. 5 Mk I was informally referred to as a &quot;jungle carbine&quot; by British and Commonwealth troops during the Malayan Emergency.

==Postwar non-military conversions==

Though they did not invent the name, the designation &quot;jungle carbine&quot; was used by the Golden State Arms Corporation in the 1950s and 1960s to market sporterised military surplus Lee–Enfield rifles under the &quot;Santa Fe&quot; brand. Golden State Arms Co. imported huge numbers of SMLE Mk III* and Lee–Enfield No. 4 rifles and converted them to civilian versions of the No. 5 Mk I and general sporting rifles for the hunting and recreational shooting markets in the US, marketing them as &quot;Santa Fe Jungle Carbine&quot; rifles and &quot;Santa Fe Mountaineer&quot; rifles, among other names.

This has led to a lot of confusion regarding the identification of actual No. 5 Mk I &quot;jungle carbine&quot; rifles, as opposed to the post-war civilian sporting rifles marketed under the same name. The easiest way to identify a &quot;jungle carbine&quot; rifle is to look for the markings on the left hand side of the receiver; a genuine No. 5 will have &quot;Rifle No 5 Mk I&quot; electrostencilled there, while a post-war conversion will generally have either no markings or markings from manufacturers who did not make the No. 5 Mk I (for example, Savage or Long Branch). Santa Fe &quot;Jungle Carbine&quot; rifles are so marked on the barrel.

Companies such as the Gibbs Rifle Company and Navy Arms in the U.S. have produced and sold completely re-built Enfields of all descriptions, most notably their recent &quot;#7 Jungle Carbine&quot; (made from Ishapore 2A1 rifles) and the &quot;Bulldog&quot; or &quot;Tanker&quot; carbine rifles, which are also fashioned original SMLE and No. 4 rifles.

<doc id="444022" wikidata="Q6577383" url="?curid=444022" title="List of MPs elected in the 1979 United Kingdom general election">
<text>This is a list of members of Parliament (MPs) elected in the 1979 general election, held on 3 May. This Parliament was dissolved in 1983.

Parliament, which consists of the House of Lords and the elected House of Commons, was convened on Tuesday 15 May 1979 at the Palace of Westminster by Queen Elizabeth II.

Of the 77 newcomers, two were women (Sheila Faith and Sheila Wright). In total, the Parliament had 19 female members (8 Conservative, 11 Labour), fewer than any post-war parliament before or since, with the sole exception of 1951. 

It was the election from which Margaret Thatcher, the incumbent Conservative Party leader became Prime Minister, the first female head of government in the United Kingdom and Europe.

==Composition==
These representative diagrams show the composition of the parties in the 1979 general election.

Note: The Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru sit together as a party group. This is not the official seating plan of the House of Commons, which has five rows of benches on each side, with the government party to the right of the speaker and opposition parties to the left, but with room for only around two-thirds of MPs to sit at any one time.



==By-elections==
See the list of United Kingdom by-elections.

Two seats were vacant when Parliament was dissolved preparatory to the 1983 general election:
*Cardiff, North-West – Michael Roberts (Con) died 10 February 1983
*Rhondda – Alec Jones (Lab) died 20 March 1983
