<text>Granville Sharp (10 November 1735 – 6 July 1813) was an English scholar, philanthropist and one of the first campaigners for the abolition of the slave trade in Britain. Born in Durham, he initially worked as a civil servant in the Board of Ordnance. His involvement in abolitionism began in 1767 when he defended a severely injured slave from Barbados in a legal case against his master. Increasingly devoted to the cause, he continually sought test cases against the legal justifications for slavery, and in 1769 he published the first tract in England that explicitly attacked the concept of slavery.

Granville Sharp&#x27;s efforts culminated in 1772 when he was instrumental in securing Lord Mansfield&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Somerset v Stewart&quot;, which held that slavery had no basis in English law. In 1787, Sharp and Thomas Clarkson founded the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. The continuing campaigns of Sharp, Clarkson and William Wilberforce led to the abolition of slave trade through the Slave Trade Act 1807. Sharp died in 1813, two decades before the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery in most of the British Empire.

In addition to his abolitionist cause, Sharp also championed the creation of a free colony in Sierra Leone, which encouraged black people in Britain to settle in west Africa. His efforts led to the founding of the Province of Freedom and later Freetown. He was also an advocate for the American colonists, parliamentary reform and the legislative independence of Ireland. An accomplished classicist and biblical scholar, Sharp was also one of the founders of the British and Foreign Bible Society.

==Life==
Granville Sharp was the son of Judith Wheler (d. 1757) and Thomas Sharp (1693–1759), Archdeacon of Northumberland, prolific theological writer and biographer of his father, John Sharp, Archbishop of York. Judith was the daughter of travel writer George Wheler and Grace née Higgons, who grew up in the political household of Sir Thomas Higgons.

Sharp was born in Durham in 1735. He had eight older brothers and five younger sisters. Five of his brothers survived their infancy and by the time Sharp had reached his midteens the family funds set aside for their education had been all but depleted, so Sharp was educated at Durham School but mainly at home.

He was apprenticed to a London linen-draper at the age of fifteen. Sharp loved to argue and debate, and his keen intellect found little outlet in the mundane work in which he was involved. However, one of his fellow-apprentices was Socinian (a Unitarian sect that denied the divinity of Christ), and in order better to argue, Sharp taught himself Greek. Another fellow apprentice was Jewish, and so Sharp learned Hebrew in order to be able to discuss theological matters with his colleague. Sharp also conducted genealogical research for one of his masters, Henry Willoughby, who had a claim to the barony of Willoughby de Parham, and it was through Sharp&#x27;s work that Willoughby was able to take his place in the House of Lords.

Sharp&#x27;s apprenticeship ended in 1757, and both his parents died soon after. That same year he accepted a position as Clerk in the Ordnance Office at the Tower of London. This civil service position allowed him plenty of free time to pursue his scholarly and intellectual pursuits. 


Sharp had a keen musical interest. Four of his siblings – William, later to become surgeon to George III, James, Elizabeth and Judith – had also come to London, and they met every day. They all played musical instruments as a family orchestra, giving concerts at William&#x27;s house in Mincing Lane and later in the family sailing barge, &quot;Apollo&quot;, which was moored at the Bishop of London&#x27;s steps in Fulham, near William&#x27;s country home, Fulham House. The fortnightly water-borne concerts took place from 1775–1783, the year his brother James died. Sharp had an excellent bass voice, described by George III as &quot;the best in Britain&quot;, and he played the clarinet, oboe, flageolet, kettle drums, harp and a double-flute which he had made himself. He often signed his name in notes to friends as G♯. 
Sharp died at Fulham House on 6 July 1813, and a memorial of him was erected in Westminster Abbey. He lived in Fulham, London, and was buried in the churchyard of All Saints&#x27;, Fulham. The vicar would not allow a funeral sermon to be preached in the church because Sharp had been involved with the British and Foreign Bible Society, which was Nonconformist.

==Abolitionism==
Sharp is best known for his untiring efforts for the abolition of slavery, although he was involved in many other causes, fired by a dislike of any social or legal injustice.

===Sharp&#x27;s first involvement: Jonathan Strong===
Sharp&#x27;s brother William held a regular surgery for the local poor at his surgery at Mincing Lane, and one day in 1765 when Sharp was visiting, he met Jonathan Strong. Strong was a young black slave from Barbados who had been badly beaten by his master, David Lisle, a lawyer, with a pistol to the head. This left him close to blindness and as a result he had been cast out into the street as useless. Sharp and his brother tended to his injuries and had him admitted to Barts Hospital, where his injuries were so bad they necessitated a four-month stay. The Sharps paid for his treatment and, when he was fit enough, found him employment as an errand runner with a Quaker apothecary friend of theirs.

In 1767, Lisle saw Strong in the street and planned to sell him to a Jamaica planter named James Kerr for £30. Two slave catchers captured Strong with the intention to ship him to the Caribbean where he would work on Kerr&#x27;s plantation. Strong was able to get word to Sharp, who went directly to the Lord Mayor who in turn convened those laying claim to Strong. In court, Macbean, Kerr&#x27;s attorney, produced the bill of sales from when Lisle sold Strong to Kerr. That was not enough to convince the Lord Mayor because Strong was imprisoned without clear cause, and so he liberated Strong. Afterwards, a West India Captain named David Laird grabbed Jonathan Strong&#x27;s arm and claimed he would take him as James Kerr&#x27;s property. Sharp, at the suggestion of Thomas Beech, the Coroner of London, threatened to charge Laird with assault should he attempt to take Strong by force. Laird let go of Strong and everyone who had been summoned departed without further dispute.

Afterwards, David Laird instituted a court action against Sharp claiming £200 damages for taking their property, and Lisle challenged Sharp to a duel—Sharp told Lisle that he could expect satisfaction from the law. Sharp consulted lawyers and found that as the law stood it favoured the master&#x27;s rights to his slaves as property: that a slave remained in law the chattel of his master even on English soil. Sharp said &quot;he could not believe the law of England was really so injurious to natural rights.&quot; He spent the next two years in study of English law, especially where it applied to the liberty of the individual.

Lisle disappeared from the records early, but Kerr persisted with his suit through eight legal terms before it was dismissed, and Kerr was ordered to pay substantial damages for wasting the court&#x27;s time. Jonathan Strong was free, even if the law had not been changed, but he only lived for five years as a free man, dying at 25.

===Increasing involvement===
The Strong case made a name for Sharp as the &quot;protector of the Negro&quot; and he was approached by two more slaves, although in both cases (&quot;Hylas v Newton&quot; and &quot;R v Stapylton&quot;) the results were unsatisfactory, and it became plain that the judiciary – and Lord Mansfield, the Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench (the leading judge of the day) in particular – was trying very hard &quot;not&quot; to decide the issue. By this time, Great Britain controlled the largest share in the transatlantic slave trade, and the triangular trade based on slavery was important to the British economy.

In 1769 Sharp published &quot;A Representation of the Injustice and Dangerous Tendency of Tolerating Slavery ...&quot;, the first tract in England attacking slavery. Within it, he argues that &quot;the laws of nature&quot; grant equality to all humans regardless of any artificial laws imposed by society. He also condemns slave contracts because the liberty of a man cannot be matched in value by anything. Sharp&#x27;s work attracted the attention of James Oglethorpe, who had long been concerned with slavery as a moral issue. The two men remained close until Oglethorpe&#x27;s death in 1785.

=== &quot;Somerset v Stewart&quot; ===
(Also called Somersett&#x27;s case.) On 13 January 1772, Sharp was visited and asked for help by James Somerset, an indigenous person of Africa who had been brought to America to be sold in the Colony of Virginia. He was then taken to England with his master Charles Stewart in 1769, where he was able to run away in October 1771. After evading slave hunters employed by Stewart for 56 days, Somerset had been caught and put in the slave ship Ann and Mary, to be taken to Jamaica and sold. This was the perfect case for Sharp because, unlike the previous cases, this was a question of lawful slavery rather than of ownership. Three Londoners had applied to Lord Mansfield for a writ of habeas corpus, which had been granted, with Somerset having to appear at a hearing on 24 January 1772. Members of the public responded to Somerset&#x27;s plight by sending money to pay for his lawyers (who in the event all gave their services &quot;pro bono publico&quot;), while Stewart&#x27;s costs were met by the West Indian planters and merchants.

Having studied English law for several years by this point, Sharp called on his now-formidable knowledge of the law regarding individual liberty and briefed Somerset&#x27;s lawyers. Mansfield&#x27;s deliberate procrastination stretched Somerset&#x27;s Case over six hearings from January to May, and he finally delivered his judgment on 22 June 1772. It was a clear victory for Somerset, Sharp and the lawyers who acted for Somerset. Mansfield acknowledged that English law did not allow slavery, and only a new Act of Parliament (&quot;positive law&quot;) could bring it into legality. However, the verdict in the case is often misunderstood to mean the end of slavery in England. It was no such thing: it dealt only with the question of the forcible sending of someone overseas into bondage; a slave becomes free the moment they set foot on English territory. It was one of the most significant achievements in the campaign to abolish slavery throughout the world, more for its effect than for its actual legal weight.

===The &quot;Zong&quot; massacre===
In 1781 the crew of the over-capacity slaver ship &quot;Zong&quot; massacred an estimated 132 slaves by tossing them overboard; an additional ten slaves threw themselves overboard in defiance or despair and over sixty people had perished through neglect, injuries, disease and overcrowding.

The &quot;Zong&quot;&#x27;s crew had mis-navigated her course and overestimated water supplies; according to the maritime law notion of general average, cargo purposely jettisoned at sea to save the remainder was eligible for insurance compensation. It was reasoned that as the slaves were cargo, the ship&#x27;s owners would be entitled to the £30 a head compensation for their loss if thrown overboard: were the slaves to die on land or at sea of so-called &quot;natural&quot; causes, no compensation would be forthcoming.

The ship&#x27;s owners, a syndicate of merchants based in Liverpool, filed their insurance claim; the insurers disputed it. In this first case the court found for the owners. The insurers appealed.

Sharp was visited on 19 March 1783 by Olaudah Equiano, a famous freed slave and later to be the author of a successful autobiography, who told him of the horrific events aboard the &quot;Zong&quot;. Sharp immediately became involved in the court case, facing his old adversary over slave trade matters, the Solicitor General for England and Wales, John Lee. Lee notoriously declared that &quot;the case was the same as if assets had been thrown overboard&quot;, and that a master could drown slaves without &quot;a surmise of impropriety&quot;.

The judge ruled that the &quot;Zong&quot;&#x27;s owners could not claim insurance on the slaves: the lack of sufficient water demonstrated that the cargo had been badly managed. However, no officers or crew were charged or prosecuted for the deliberate killing of the slaves, and Sharp&#x27;s attempts to mount a prosecution for murder never got off the ground.

===The Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade===

Sharp was not completely alone at the beginning of the struggle: the Quakers, especially in America, were committed abolitionists. Sharp had a long and fruitful correspondence with Anthony Benezet, a Quaker abolitionist in Pennsylvania. However, the Quakers were a marginal group in England, and were debarred from standing for Parliament, and they had no doubt as to who should be the chairman of the new society they were founding, The Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade. On 22 May 1787, at the inaugural meeting of the committee – nine Quakers and three Anglicans (who strengthened the committee&#x27;s likelihood of influencing Parliament) – Sharp&#x27;s position was unanimously agreed. In the 20 years of the society&#x27;s existence, during which Sharp was ever-present at committee meetings, such was Sharp&#x27;s modesty that he would never take the chair, always contriving to arrive just after the meeting had started to avoid any chance of having to take the meeting. While the committee felt it sensible to concentrate on the slave trade, Sharp felt strongly that the target should be slavery itself. On this he was out-voted, but he worked tirelessly for the Society nevertheless.

===Correspondence with Benjamin Rush===
The correspondence between Granville Sharp and Anthony Benezet inspired Benjamin Rush, a physician in Philadelphia who would later become one of the founding fathers, to contact Sharp as well. This led to a connection by letter between the two that lasted 36 years. In the first letter, written May 1, 1773, Rush attests to the increasing compassion within the colonies towards the suffering of the slaves. He makes mention of the clergy publicly arguing that slavery is a violation of both &quot;the laws of nature&quot; and Christian belief. This detail is noteworthy because Sharp was of the belief that laws should follow both &quot;the laws of nature&quot; and that which is given in Judeo-Christian scripture. Another letter, written February 21, 1774, has Sharp providing Rush with several pamphlets, written by himself and his brothers William and James, to be shared with friends and eventually to Lord Dartmouth. Many similar exchanges of pamphlets occur throughout their correspondence, which allowed them to inspire one another and refine their arguments against slavery. The final letter of their correspondence was written June 20, 1809, four years prior to the death of both figures in 1813.

===Abolition===
When Sharp heard that the Act of Abolition had at last been passed by both Houses of Parliament and given Royal Assent on 25 March 1807, he fell to his knees and offered a prayer of thanksgiving. He was now 71, and had outlived almost all of the allies and opponents of his early campaigns. He was regarded as the grand old man of the abolition struggle, and although a driving force in its early days, his place had later been taken by others such as Thomas Clarkson, William Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect. Sharp, however, did not see the final abolition as he died on 6 July 1813.

==The Province of Freedom==
Although no reliable figures exist, it is thought that in the early 1780s there were around 15,000 black people in Britain, most of them without employment. Ideas were formulated for a settlement in Africa where they could return &quot;home&quot;. Henry Smeathman, a plant collector and entomologist who had visited Sierra Leone, propounded to the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor that the country would be an excellent location. Worried black people came to see Sharp, concerned that they might be re-enslaved in such a place.

Sharp took to the idea with alacrity: he saw it as a perfect opportunity to create a new model society from scratch. He drew up plans and regulations, and persuaded the Treasury to finance the ships and pay £12 a head to each embarking settler. He named the new, egalitarian, peaceful Christian society-to-be &quot;The Province of Freedom&quot;.

The utopian ideal quickly went sour in the face of tremendous logistical difficulties; fire broke out even before the ships had left London. Sharp&#x27;s friend, Olaudah Equiano, highlighted corruption in the process of stocking the ships, and was dismissed as a result; 411 people sailed for Africa, including some 60 white women without Sharp&#x27;s knowledge, married to the male settlers. It is unclear how many were previously betrothed and how many married in preparation for the journey; traditionally these women have been characterized as prostitutes from Deptford. However, historians have since dismissed that description as false. The settlers arrived in May 1787, at the onset of the five-month rainy season, and a settlement of sorts was built, named Granville Town. The commander of the naval escort that had brought the settlers concluded that they were unfit for the complex challenge of founding a new settlement in a potentially hostile environment. One of the settlers whom Granville had rescued from a slave ship left the settlement to work in the slave trade, much to Sharp&#x27;s despair. By the end of 1788 Sharp had poured £1,735 18s 8d of his own money into the settlement. In 1789 Granville Town was burned to the ground by a local Temne chief; this may have been in retaliation for the burning of a Temne by a slave-trader.

Through The Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade, in 1790 Granville came into contact with Thomas Peters, a former American slave who fought with the British during revolution in return for freedom. Sharp was instrumental in helping Peters to establish Freetown, Sierra Leone. Sharp is considered to be one of the founders of Sierra Leone alongside Thomas Peters and the Clarkson brothers (Thomas Clarkson and John Clarkson).

==Other activism==
Sharp ardently sympathized with the revolt of the American colonists. He believed in peace in America, but he also believed they were entitled to &quot;Equitable Representation&quot;, an idea repeated in the famous phrase &quot;No taxation without representation&quot;. When he realised his job in the Ordnance Office meant sending equipment to British forces fighting the colonists, he took leave of absence. As the war continued, he wrote to his employers &quot;I cannot return to my ordnance duty whilst a bloody war is carried on, unjustly, against my fellow-subjects.&quot; Eventually in 1776 he resigned, never to have paid employment again and supported willingly by his brothers, who were happy to see him dedicate his time to his various causes.

Sharp also advocated parliamentary reform and the legislative independence of Ireland, and agitated against the impressment of sailors for the Navy. It was through his efforts that bishops for the United States of America were consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1787. He also argued for the reform of Parliament based on Magna Carta and to back this up he devised the doctrine of accumulative authority. This doctrine stated that because almost innumerable parliaments had approved Magna Carta it would take the same number of Parliaments to repeal it. Like many others, Sharp accepted the supremacy of Parliament as an institution, but did not believe that this power was without restraint, and thought that Parliament could not repeal Magna Carta.

Sharp was also one of the founders and the first President of the British and Foreign Bible Society and of the Society for the Conversion of the Jews.

==Classical grammarian==
One of Granville&#x27;s letters written in 1778 (published in 1798), propounded what has come to be known as The Granville Sharp Rule (in actuality only the first of six principles that Sharp articulated involving the Greek article):

:&quot;When the copulative &quot;kai&quot; connects two nouns of the same case, if the article &quot;ho&quot;, or any of its cases, precedes the first of the said nouns or participles, and is not repeated before the second noun or participle, the latter always relates to the same person that is expressed or described by the first noun or participle ...&quot;

This rule, if true, has a profound bearing on Unitarian doctrine, which led to a ‘celebrated controversy’, in which many leading divines took part, including Christopher Wordsworth.

Sharp&#x27;s Rule and its application to passages in the New Testament which teach the deity of Christ were the subject of the series &quot;The Greek Article and the Doctrine of Christ&#x27;s Deity,&quot; by Clifford Kuehne, published in the &quot;Journal of Theology&quot; of the Church of the Lutheran Confession. This series also discusses the application of Colwell&#x27;s Rule to John 1:1.

Daniel B. Wallace says about Sharp:

:&quot;His strong belief in Christ’s deity led him to study the Scriptures in the original in order to defend more ably that precious truth ... As he studied the Scriptures in the original, he noticed a certain pattern, namely, when the construction article-noun-και-noun involved personal nouns which were singular and not proper names, they always referred to the same person. He noticed further that this rule applied in several texts to the deity of Jesus Christ.&quot;

But Wallace claims that this rule is often too broadly applied. &quot;Sharp’s rule Number 1&quot; does not always work with plural forms of personal titles. Instead, a phrase that follows the form article-noun-&quot;and&quot;-noun, when the nouns involved are plurals, can involve two entirely distinct groups, two overlapping groups, two groups of which is one a subset of the other, or two identical groups. In other words, the rule is of very specific and limited application.

Of Granville Sharp&#x27;s most successful critic, Calvin Winstanley, Wallace says:

:&quot;Winstanley conceded &#x27;There are, you say, no exceptions, in the New Testament, to your rule; that is, I suppose, unless these particular texts [i.e. the ones Sharp used to adduce Christ&#x27;s deity] be such ... it is nothing surprising to find all these particular texts in question appearing as the exceptions to your rule, and the sole exceptions ... in the New Testament&#x27; – an obvious concession that he could find no exceptions save for the ones he supposed exist in the christologically pregnant texts.&quot;

What Wallace neglects by use of ellipses (...) is the flow of Winstanley&#x27;s argument as well as the character of his theology. Winstanley&#x27;s quote argued that one could not apply Sharp&#x27;s rule to the possible exceptions unless it could be shown that extra-biblical literature also followed Sharp&#x27;s rule. Through multiple examples Winstanley showed that in classical Greek and in patristic Greek – all the literature surrounding the New Testament, the rule simply did not apply consistently. Wallace&#x27;s quote comes from the end of Winstanley&#x27;s argument in which he clearly is not conceding the point. To complete Winstanley&#x27;s argument:

:&quot;There are, you say, no exceptions, in the New Testament, to your rule; that is, I suppose, unless these particular texts be such; which you think utterly improbable. You would argue, then, that if these texts were exceptions, there would be more. I do not perceive any great weight in this hypothetical reasoning. But, however plausible it may appear, the reply is at hand. There are no other words so likely to yield exceptions; because there are no other words, between which the insertion of the copulative, would effect so remarkable a deviation from the established form of constructing them to express one person; and of course, would so pointedly suggest a difference of signification.&quot;

Winstanley was Trinitarian, but cautioned that a rule that held true only in the New Testament in all but the disputed cases was too flimsy a ground on which to try to prove the divinity of Christ to the Socinians (Unitarians). Instead he said, &quot;[I think] there are much more cogent arguments in reserve, when [Sharp&#x27;s] rule of interpretation shall be abandoned.&quot; His biggest criticisms of Sharp&#x27;s rule rest in the fact that 1) the early church fathers do not follow it and 2) the early church fathers never invoked this rule to prove the divinity of Christ (though it would have been an obvious tool against such heresy). He concludes, &quot;Hence it may be presumed that the doctrine then rested on other grounds.&quot;

However, just because Wallace exaggerates Winstanley&#x27;s concession does not mean that he has no evidence to refute Winstanley. Wallace argues that, for various reasons, the only two passages from Granville&#x27;s eight that truly follow Sharp&#x27;s rule (for textual reasons, among others) are Titus 2:13 and 2 Peter 1:1. Wallace interacts in depth with Winstanley&#x27;s critiques of Sharp and shows from grammatical, textual, linguistic, and Patristic evidence that Sharp&#x27;s rule is truly valid across Classical, Biblical, Papyrological, and Patristic Greek – with some slight modification to the rules. Here is how Wallace restates the issue:

&quot;In native Greek constructions (i.e., not translation Greek), when a single article modifies two substantives connected by καί (thus, article-substantive-καί-substantive), when both substantives are (1) singular (both grammatically and semantically), (2) personal, (3) and common nouns (not proper names or ordinals), they have the same referent.&quot;

==Legacy==


After his death on 6 July 1813, Granville Sharp was buried at All Saints&#x27; Church, Fulham, beside his brother William Sharp and sister Elizabeth Prouse. The inscription on his tomb states:

&quot;Here by the Remains 
of the Brother and Sister whom he tenderly loved 
lie those of 
GRANVILLE SHARP Esqr. 
at the age of 79 this venerable Philanthropist 
terminated his Career 
of almost unparalleled activity and usefulness 
July 6th 1813 
&quot;Leaving behind him a name&quot; 
&quot;That will be Cherished with Affection and Gratitude&quot;
&quot;as long as any homage shall be paid to those principles&quot;
&quot;of JUSTICE HUMANITY and RELIGION&quot;
&quot;which for nearly half a Century&quot;
&quot;He promoted by his Exertions&quot;
&quot;and adorned by his Example&quot;&quot;

A reredos erected a generation later in All Saints&#x27; Church, Fulham, reads: &quot;This reredos was erected in 1845 to the honor of God and in memory of William Sharp of Fulham House, Surgeon to King George III, Catherine his wife, daughter of Thomas Barwick, Granville Sharp, his brother...&quot;

Sharp&#x27;s portrait was made many times, both during his life and afterwards. The National Portrait Gallery, London holds seven portraits, including the large oil of &quot;The Sharp Family&quot; by Johann Zoffany and six pencil drawings, etchings and engravings. An oil portrait of Sharp by Mather Brown is in a private collection.

As well as Granville Town in Sierra Leone, the free village of Granville in Jamaica was named after Sharp.

A memorial to Sharp was erected in Westminster Abbey, and he features in carved bas-relief on the side of the Clarkson Memorial, Wisbech, a memorial to fellow-abolitionist Thomas Clarkson (1760–1846).

In 2007, the Royal Mail issued a set of stamps to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the United Kingdom. Sharp featured on the 50p stamp.

In 2007, Sharp&#x27;s tomb in the graveyard of All Saints&#x27;, Fulham was also restored to coincide with the anniversary. In recognition of Sharp&#x27;s historical importance and preparation for the anniversary, the tomb was listed as Grade II on 16 March 2007, only three months after the application was made to English Heritage and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. The tomb was restored in June 2007 and a ceremony to mark the completion of the work was held in the church, attended by many notable figures including the historian Simon Schama. Speaking at the service, Schama said that &quot;Sharp&#x27;s great contribution was to &#x27;lower the threshold of shame&#x27; in society.&quot;

Granville Sharp&#x27;s papers are deposited at the Gloucestershire Archives, reference D3549. There is also a substantial collection of his letters at York Minster Library. His &#x27;entire library&#x27; was sold at auction by Leigh &amp; Sotheby in London on 22 November 1813 (and seven following days) in 1875 lots, although he gave some books to the Bible Society Library during his lifetime (now deposited at Cambridge University Library); a copy of the sale catalogue is held at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.160(7)). His collection of &#x27;music, printed and in manuscript&#x27; was sold by Leigh &amp; Sotheby in London on 7 February 1814 (and two following days); a copy is at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.162(5)).

Among the papers at Gloucestershire Archives is a transcription of a work song sung by enslaved Africans in the sugar-cane fields of Barbados. Sharp wrote down the music and lyrics reported by William Dickson, who had heard the song while in Barbados as secretary to the governor. The manuscript, &quot;An African Song or Chant from Barbados&quot;, is the oldest notation of a piece of music from the island. In 2017, the manuscript was given UNESCO Memory of the World status, recognising documentary heritage of global importance.

<doc id="444865" wikidata="Q927894" url="?curid=444865" title="Earl of Southesk">
<text>Earl of Southesk is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1633 for Sir David Carnegie, an Extraordinary Lord of Session. He had already been created Lord Carnegie of Kinnaird in 1616 and was made Lord Carnegie, of Kinnaird and Leuchars, at the same time he was given the earldom. These titles are also in the Peerage of Scotland. The earldom is named after the River South Esk in Angus. Carnegie&#x27;s younger brother John Carnegie was given the corresponding title: earl of Northesk. The earl of Southesk also holds the Scottish feudal title of Baron of Kinnaird and is a baronet in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. Kinnaird Castle, Brechin, has been the home of the earls of Southesk for several hundred years.

The first earl of Southesk&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the fifth earl, was involved in the Jacobite rising of 1715. As a result, he was attainted by Act of Parliament and his titles and estates forfeited. The representation of the family then passed to his third cousin Sir James Carnegie, 3rd Baronet, of Pittarrow (now recognized as the &quot;de jure&quot; sixth earl of Southesk; for earlier history of the baronetcy, see below). In contrast to his cousin, he fought on the side of King George II during the Jacobite rebellion, and later purchased his cousin&#x27;s forfeited estates. Carnegie also sat as a Member of Parliament for Kincardineshire. His son, the fourth baronet and &quot;de jure&quot; seventh earl, also represented this constituency in the House of Commons. His son, the fifth baronet and &quot;de jure&quot; eighth earl, briefly represented Aberdeen in Parliament. His son, the sixth baronet and &quot;de jure&quot; ninth earl, obtained a reversal of the attainder in 1855 and became the ninth earl of Southesk. Lord Southesk notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Kincardineshire. In 1869 he was created Baron Balinhard, of Farnell in the County of Forfar, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This title gave the earls an automatic seat in the House of Lords. His grandson, the eleventh earl, married Princess Maud, granddaughter of King Edward VII. Princess Maud and her elder sister Princess Alexandra were in special remainder to the Dukedom of Fife. On Alexandra&#x27;s death in 1959, the titles passed to her nephew James Carnegie, Lord Carnegie, the only son of the eleventh earl of Southesk and Princess Maud (who died in 1945), who became the third duke. On his father&#x27;s death in 1992, the Duke also succeeded as twelfth earl of Southesk. The earldom and minor titles are now subsidiary titles of the Dukedom of Fife, with the title of earl of Southesk used as a courtesy title by the duke&#x27;s eldest son and heir apparent.

The Carnegie baronetcy, of Pittarrow in the County of Kincardine, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 20 February 1663 for David Carnegie. He was the son of Hon. Sir Alexander Carnegie, fourth son of the first earl of Southesk. As mentioned above, his grandson, the third baronet, became representative of the family after his cousin&#x27;s attainder in 1715.

<text>The First Battle of Krithia () was the first Allied attempt to advance in the Battle of Gallipoli during the First World War. Starting on 28 April, three days after the Landing at Cape Helles, the defensive power of the Ottoman forces quickly overwhelmed the attack, which suffered from poor leadership and planning, lack of communications, and exhaustion &amp; demoralisation of the troops.

==Prelude==
On the morning of 25 April 1915, the 29th Division (Major General Aylmer Hunter-Weston), landed on five beaches around Cape Helles at the southern tip of the Gallipoli peninsula in the Ottoman Empire. The main landings at &#x27;V&#x27; and &#x27;W&#x27; Beaches were hotly contested and the British suffered heavy casualties. A supporting landing made at &#x27;Y&#x27; Beach on the Aegean coast to the north was made without opposition but the troops were without instructions and made no attempt to either advance or dig in. The first-day objectives of the village of Krithia and the nearby hill of Achi Baba were virtually undefended. The British forfeited an opportunity for an early success when they were forced retreat from &#x27;Y&#x27; Beach when the Ottoman reinforcements arrived.

After much fighting, the British were able to secure the main landings. After a diversionary landing at Kum Kale on the Asian shore of the Dardanelles, the French &quot;Corps expéditionnaire d&#x27;Orient&quot; moved across the straits to Helles and took over the right of the Allied line. By the afternoon of 27 April, the Allies were able to make an advance of about up the peninsula towards Krithia, ready for an assault on the following day. The success of the Ottoman defence of the beaches, led the British grossly to overestimate the opposition they faced. The Ottomans were outnumbered 3:1 but believing that the Ottomans were indifferent fighters, the British assumed they were faced by two divisions, rather than two understrength regiments fighting a delaying action.

==Battle==
The battle commenced around on 28 April with a naval bombardment. The plan of advance was for the French to hold position on the right while the British line would pivot, capturing Krithia and assailing Achi Baba from the south and west. The overly-complex plan was poorly communicated to the brigade and battalion commanders of the 29th Division who would make the attack. Hunter-Weston remained far from the front; because of this, he was not able to exert any control as the attack developed. The initial advances were easy but as pockets of Ottoman resistance were encountered, some stretches of the line were held up while others kept moving, thereby becoming outflanked. As the troops advanced further up the peninsula, the terrain became more difficult as they encountered the four great ravines that ran from the heights around Achi Baba towards the cape.

On the extreme left, the British ran into Gully Ravine which was as wild and confusing as the ground at Anzac Cove. Two battalions of the 87th Brigade (1st Border Regiment and 1st Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers) entered the ravine but were halted by a machine gun post near &#x27;Y&#x27; Beach. No further advance would be made up the ravine until the 1/6th Gurkha Rifles captured the post on the night of This involved them going up a vertical slope, upon which the Royal Marine Light Infantry and the Royal Dublin Fusiliers had been defeated. The site became known as &#x27;Gurkha Bluff&#x27;. The exhausted, demoralised and virtually leaderless British troops could go no further in the face of stiffening Ottoman resistance. In some places, Ottoman counter-attacks drove the British back to their starting positions. By the attack was called off.

==Aftermath==
About troops participated in the battle and suffered and casualties. The scale and duration of the battle was minor compared to later fighting but the First Battle of Krithia was one of the most significant of the campaign as it proved that the original British assumption of a swift victory over an indifferent enemy was mistaken. Helles became the scene of numerous attrition battles, in which success would be measured by an advance of or the capture of a trench.

<text>USS &quot;Houston&quot; (SSN-713), a attack submarine, was the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for Houston, Texas. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 1 August 1975 and her keel was laid down on 29 January 1979. She was launched on 21 March 1981 sponsored by Barbara Bush, wife of then Vice-President of the United States George H. W. Bush. &quot;Houston&quot; was commissioned on 25 September 1982. 

==History==

Author Robert D. Kaplan embedded aboard the ship in the spring of 2005 and recounted his experiences in her for his book &quot;Hog Pilots, Blue Water Grunts&quot; in Chapter Four &quot;Geeks with Tattoos: The Most Driven Men I have Ever Known.&quot;

=== 2008 radiation leak ===
On 1 August 2008 the Navy reported to CNN that &quot;Houston&quot; was found to have been leaking radioactive water for months while on patrol and visiting stations in Japan, Guam and Hawaii. The problem was discovered the previous month during servicing at Pearl Harbor. One crewman was exposed to radioactive water but not injured. The Navy reported that the &quot;Houston&quot;″s leak released only a &quot;negligible&quot; amount of radioactivity. The Navy later expanded the estimated time the leak existed to nearly two years, although they maintained the amount of radioactivity leaked was very small – &quot;less than a smoke detector&quot;.

===Final deployment===
On 28 October 2015, &quot;Houston&quot; moored in Pearl Harbor, after completing her final scheduled deployment. She was decommissioned on 26 August 2016 in a ceremony at Naval Base Kitsap—Bangor. The ship is currently awaiting disposal, presumably in its home port of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

<doc id="444870" wikidata="Q3296057" url="?curid=444870" title="Mirko and Stjepan Seljan">
<text>Mirko Seljan (5 April 1871 – c. 1913) and Stjepan Seljan (19 August 1875 – 7 June 1936) were Croatian explorers.

==Early life==
The brothers were born in Karlovac, Croatia (at the time part of Austria-Hungary). After receiving a basic education there and attending Gymnasium Karlovac, they started traveling across Europe. Older Mirko was, in 1898, known under the name Champion Globetrotter because he walked the distance between Paris, France and Saint Petersburg in Russia. It is believed that the brothers started their journey after being impressed by the books or lectures by another Croatian explorer, Dragutin Lerman, who was in Africa as leader of Henry Morton Stanley&#x27;s team.

Stjepan Seljan&#x27;s birth name was actually Štefan; later in his life he was commonly referred to as Stevo.

==Africa==

They started in January 1899, leaving Karlovac for Trieste, today in Italy. They visited Alexandria and Cairo, then walked along the river Nile toward Sudan. After returning to Cairo, they headed to Port Said, Djibouti, and Aden, reaching Bab el Mandeb. After traveling to Obock back in Djibouti, they eventually ended up in Harar and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia.

There, on the recommendation of several influential Europeans, Menelik II, Emperor of Ethiopia provided them with an escort of 300 people to continue their expedition to the south. Mirko was appointed governor of the southern province of Ethiopia with his brother Stjepan as his lieutenant-governor. They spent three years defining the border between Ethiopia and Kenya, bringing the tribes under the unified government of Menelik II. Their expedition and military camps near Lake Turkana (Lake Rudolf) were named Seljanville and still appear on maps today.

The greatest benefit of the journey was that they expanded the sovereignty of Ethiopia to the right side of the river Omo. The current borders between the states of Ethiopia, Sudan, and Kenya around Lake Turkana are the same as drafted by the Seljan explorers at that time. In 1902, due to political tension, they left, only to return after the end of hostilities between imperial Britain and France (cf. Fashoda Incident).

They were highly regarded by the emperor Menelik II, and received many gifts, some of which are today in the possession of their families; some others are on display in the Ethnographic Museum in Zagreb. It is obvious today that the journeys of the two explorers were partly influenced or disrupted by world politics. Nonetheless their initial intention was to enrich their lives and the world with new knowledge and understanding of the world.

==South America==

In April 1903 the two brothers left for Rio de Janeiro in Brazil with the intention of entering areas that were at that time unknown, to establish traveling and trade routes and permanent posts. The government of Brazil was interested in enhancing trading and development going from the east to the west. During 1903, they established the Croatian Scientific Mission (Misión Científica Croata). They made contacts with the Guaraní tribe around the Aguapehu river and intensively mapped the area. At the end of 1903 they were on their way from Salta Grande to Asunción, Paraguay, ending their journey on the Paraná River in Argentina. The expedition is described in the book &quot;El Salto del Guayran&quot;, published in 1905 in Buenos Aires. In 1905 they left for the waterfalls of Iguaçu and later conducted research for the state of Santa Catarina.

At the beginning of 1905, after crossing the Andes by foot and with mules from Argentina, the Seljans arrived in Chile. In Valparaíso as well in Santiago they planned a new expedition to approach the area of the Amazon River from the south side. Here, they met with Croatian immigrants and established the Sociedad Slava Exploradora de Mato Grosso (&quot;Slavic Society for the Exploration of Mato Grosso&quot;), which was supposed to provide public relations and support expeditions. In May of the same year, they left for Montevideo, Uruguay with their new friend and new explorer Franjo Pommer. Due to extensive preparations, they started rather late, in 1908, focusing on the Rio Branco and Rio Maracá rivers in the Amazon delta. Exhausted and discouraged by delays in obtaining permits from the government, they returned to Chile hoping to see Peru and Bolivia. They spent 1911 exploring the Atacama desert and the area of Tarapacá. In that year, for the first time, they entered Peru. They established &quot;Hrvatsko dioničarsko društvo&quot; (Croatian Brokerage Society) with the purpose of helping the government of Peru to plan, finance and build roads connecting two parts of the country, from the Andes to the Amazon basin.

==End==
The brothers took different paths for the first time in October 1912 with Stjepan heading toward the United States to initiate new business contracts, while Mirko was supposed to continue their research, starting a new expedition. Because his group did not meet another group of explorers to continue with, Mirko decided to proceed on his own deeper into the rainforest around Huayabamba river, not to be seen again. In the aftermath, numerous theories about his disappearance arose, including murder, death from hazards of the jungle, even cannibalism, but none was ever proven. After his older brother&#x27;s disappearance, Stjepan kept moving, searching for mineral deposits in South and Central America until, in 1917, he decided to settle and made his home in Ouro Preto, Brazil, where he died in 1936.

==Reasons==

It is obvious today that the journeys of the two explorers were partly influenced or disrupted by world politics and by newly industrialized society. During their travels, they conducted numerous observations and provided documentation later used for works in geomorphology, climatology, and ethnography. Their initial intention was to enrich their lives and the world with new knowledge and understanding. In their diaries, they described the areas they passed through, discussed Indian tribes they met, and left numerous sketches, photographs, maps, data, and memories regarding the nature and cultures that they had so much enjoyed meeting.

<doc id="444872" wikidata="Q185649" url="?curid=444872" title="Miklós Fehér">
<text>Miklós &quot;Miki&quot; Fehér (; 20 July 1979 – 25 January 2004) was a Hungarian professional footballer who played as a striker.

He spent most of his nine-year career in Portugal, representing four clubs and amassing Primeira Liga totals of 80 games and 27 goals. On 25 January 2004, he died of a cardiac arrest during a match between Vitória de Guimarães and his team Benfica in Guimarães.

Fehér represented Hungary national team at international level, making his debut in 1998 at the age of 19.

==Club career==
Born in Tatabánya, Fehér started his playing career at Győri ETO, where he was spotted by Porto scouts. He was signed in 1998 but never really made a breakthrough onto the first team, being loaned to gain experience from ages 20 to 21 to another two northern sides, Salgueiros and Braga.

At Braga, Fehér had his best professional season, scoring 14 Primeira Liga goals in 26 games in 2000–01. After Porto chairman Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa quarrelled with his agent José Veiga, the player refused to part with the latter and left, joining Lisbon side Benfica and going on to net eight official goals over two seasons.

===Death and legacy===

On 25 January 2004, Fehér was in Guimarães with Benfica to play against Vitória de Guimarães. The game was being broadcast live on television, and Benfica were leading 1–0. Fehér had just come on as a substitute and assisted another player just off the bench, Fernando Aguiar, for the match&#x27;s only goal, but received a yellow card in injury time and suddenly bent forward, seemingly in pain; he then fell backwards to the ground.

Members of both teams rushed immediately to aid Fehér before medical personnel arrived on the pitch. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, an ambulance arrived on the pitch and he was rushed to the hospital. His condition was covered by the Portuguese media throughout the day and, before midnight, his death was confirmed, the cause of death being cardiac arrhythmia brought on by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In his memory, Benfica retired the number 29 shirt, which he wore during his time at the club. He was remembered by many and his death caused a profound shock in Portuguese sports. Among others, Porto director of football Reinaldo Teles and manager José Mourinho paid their respects at the Estádio da Luz, where the player&#x27;s body remained before his burial in his native Hungary.

Benfica&#x27;s delegation, which included president Luís Filipe Vieira, coach Giovanni Trapattoni and the entire first-team squad, travelled to Hungary, presenting Fehér&#x27;s parents with the 2004–05 league championship medal, in respect for the player and his time with the club. They had previously dedicated the 2003–04 Taça de Portugal trophy to him. 

On 9 October 2009, the day before their 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Portugal in Lisbon, the Hungary national team squad laid a wreath next to a metal bust of Fehér at Benfica&#x27;s homeground, in tribute to his memory. Before a UEFA Europa Conference League game at the ground where he died, Hungarian club Puskás Akadémia FC paid tribute to him on 20 July 2022, which would have been his 43rd birthday.

He was only 24 years old when he died.

==International career==
Fehér earned his first cap for the Hungary national team on 10 October 1998, in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying match against Azerbaijan. He came on as a sixth-minute substitute for Ferenc Horváth at the Tofiq Bahramov Stadium in Baku, and scored the final goal of the 4–0 win.

On 11 October 2000, Fehér netted a hat-trick in a 6–1 away rout of Lithuania for the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. In total, he scored seven goals in 25 appearances.

<text>Louis Menand (; born January 21, 1952) is an American critic, essayist, and professor who wrote the Pulitzer-winning book &quot;The Metaphysical Club&quot; (2001), an intellectual and cultural history of late 19th- and early 20th-century America.

==Life and career==
Menand was born in Syracuse, New York, and raised around Boston, Massachusetts. His mother, Catherine (Shults) Menand, was a historian who wrote a biography of Samuel Adams. His father, Louis Menand III, taught political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His grandfather and great-grandfather owned the Louis Menand House, located in Menands, New York, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The village of Menands is named after his great-grandfather, a 19th-century horticulturist.

A 1973 graduate of Pomona College, Menand attended Harvard Law School for one year (1973–1974) before he left to earn Master of Arts (1975) and PhD (1980) degrees in English from Columbia University.

He thereafter taught at Princeton University and held staff positions at &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; (contributing editor 1994–2001) and &quot;The New Republic&quot; (associate editor 1986–1987). He has contributed to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; since 1991 and remains a staff writer. In 1988 he was appointed a Distinguished Professor of English at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and in 1990 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. He left CUNY to accept a post in the English Department at Harvard University in 2003. He has also taught at Columbia, Queens College, the University of Virginia School of Law.

He published his first book, &quot;Discovering Modernism: T. S. Eliot and His Context&quot;, in 1987. His second book, &quot;The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America&quot; (2001), includes detailed biographical material on Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., William James, Charles Sanders Peirce, and John Dewey, and documents their roles in the development of the philosophy of pragmatism. It received the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for History, the 2002 Francis Parkman Prize, and The Heartland Prize for Non-Fiction. In 2002 Menand published &quot;American Studies&quot;, a collection of essays on prominent figures in American culture.

He is the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of English at Harvard. In 2018 he was appointed for a 5-year term to the Lee Simpkins Family professorship of Arts and Sciences. His principal field of academic interest is 19th and 20th century American cultural history. He teaches literary theory and postwar cultural history at both the graduate and undergraduate level. At Harvard he helped co-found a freshman course with content in literature and philosophy, Humanities 10: An Introductory Humanities Colloquium. He also served as co-chair on the Task Force on General Education at Harvard working on a new general education curriculum.

In consultation with the National Endowment for the Humanities, President Barack Obama awarded him the National Humanities Medal in 2015.

In 2021, Menand&#x27;s book &quot;The Free World: Art and Thought in the Cold War&quot; was published. Mark Grief&#x27;s review in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; described the book as a &quot;monumental new study of cold war culture,&quot; covering &quot;art, literature, music, and thought from 1945 to 1965.&quot;

<doc id="444882" wikidata="Q388553" url="?curid=444882" title="Explosive belt">
<text>An explosive belt (also called suicide belt, suicide vest or bomb vest) is an improvised explosive device, a belt or a vest packed with explosives and armed with a detonator, worn by suicide bombers. Explosive belts are usually packed with ball bearings, nails, screws, bolts, and other objects that serve as shrapnel to maximize the number of casualties in the explosion.

==History==
The Chinese used explosive vests during the Second Sino-Japanese War. A Chinese soldier detonated a grenade vest and killed 20 Japanese at Sihang Warehouse. Chinese troops strapped explosives like grenade packs or dynamite to their bodies and threw themselves over Japanese tanks to blow them up. This tactic was used during the Battle of Shanghai, where a Chinese suicide bomber stopped a Japanese tank column by exploding himself beneath the lead tank, and at the Battle of Taierzhuang, where Chinese troops rushed at Japanese tanks and blew themselves up with dynamite and grenades. During one incident at Taierzhuang, Chinese suicide bombers destroyed four Japanese tanks with grenade bundles.

The use of suicidal attacks to inflict damage upon an enemy predates the Second World War, in which Kamikaze units (suicidal air attacks) and Kaiten (&quot;living torpedoes&quot;) were used to attack Allied forces. Japanese soldiers routinely detonated themselves by attacking Allied tanks while carrying antitank mines, magnetic demolition charges, hand grenades and other explosive devices.

==Description==
The explosive belt usually consists of several cylinders filled with explosive (de facto pipe bombs), or in more sophisticated versions with plates of explosive. The explosive is surrounded by a fragmentation jacket that produces the shrapnel responsible for most of the bomb&#x27;s lethality, effectively making the jacket a crude, body-worn, Claymore mine. Once the vest is detonated, the explosion resembles an omnidirectional shotgun blast. The most dangerous and the most widely used shrapnel are steel balls in diameter. Other shrapnel material can be anything of suitable size and hardness, most often nails, screws, nuts, and thick wire. Shrapnel is responsible for about 90% of all casualties caused by this kind of device.

A &quot;loaded&quot; vest may weigh between and may be hidden under thick clothes, usually jackets or snow coats.

A suicide vest may cover the entire stomach and usually has shoulder straps.

A common security procedure against suspected suicide bombers is to move the suspect at least away from other people, then ask them to remove their upper clothing. While this procedure is relatively uncontroversial for use on males, it may cause an issue when dealing with females suspected of being suicide bombers. Male security personnel may be reluctant to inspect or strip-search females, and can be accused of sexual harassment after having done so. Alternatively, an infrared detector can be used. There are assertions that using a millimeter wave scanner would be viable for the task, but the concept has been disputed.

The discovery of remains as well as incidentally unexploded belts or vests can offer forensic clues to the investigation after the attack.

==Forensic investigation==
Suicide bombers who wear the vests are often obliterated by the explosion; the best evidence of their identity is the head, which often remains relatively intact because it is separated and thrown clear off the body by the explosion. Journalist Joby Warrick conjectured: &quot;The vest&#x27;s tight constraints and the positioning of the explosive pouches would channel the energy of the blast outward, toward whoever stood directly in front of him. Some of that energy wave would inevitably roll upward, ripping the bomber&#x27;s body apart at its weakest point, between the neck bones and lower jaw. It accounts for the curious phenomenon in which suicide bombers&#x27; heads are severed clean at the moment of detonation and are later found in a state of perfect preservation several metres away from the torso&#x27;s shredded remains.&quot;

<doc id="444884" wikidata="Q1277323" url="?curid=444884" title="Earl of Lauderdale">
<text>Earl of Lauderdale is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. The current holder of the title is Ian Maitland, 18th Earl of Lauderdale.

==History==
The title was created in 1624 for John Maitland, 2nd Lord Maitland of Thirlestane, Berwickshire.
The second Earl was created Duke of Lauderdale and by popular naming represented the &quot;L&quot; in the Cabal ministry, an acronym which amounted to the first major, perennial delegation of power from the monarch to a cabinet. When he died without male issue, the dukedom became extinct. The earldom passed to his brother Charles, 3rd Earl. Charles married, in 1652, Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Lauder of Haltoun and by this marriage came into that family&#x27;s great estates.

Other titles associated with the earldom are: Viscount of Lauderdale (created 1616), Viscount of Maitland (1624), Lord Maitland of Thirlestane (1590) and Lord Thirlestane and Boulton (1624). All of these titles are in the Peerage of Scotland. The Earl of Lauderdale is the hereditary chief of Clan Maitland. The eldest son is the Master of Lauderdale. The title &quot;Viscount Maitland&quot; is sometimes used as a courtesy title for the Earl&#x27;s eldest son and heir.

The Earl of Lauderdale, as Bearer for the Sovereign of the Sovereign&#x27;s National Flag for Scotland, one of the Officers of the Royal Household in Scotland, has the right to bear the saltire for the Sovereign.

The historical family seat is Thirlestane Castle, near Lauder in Scotland, home of Captain Gerald Maitland-Carew and his family. He is a son of Lady Sylvia Maitland – who became wife to the 6th Baron Carew – she was the eldest of two children of the 15th Earl of Lauderdale; her brother was killed in action in North Africa, aged 27 and left three daughters. Therefore the earldom passed to a cadet branch and the castle passed down the more direct female line.

;Notable wives and Maitland descendants
*Elizabeth Tollemache, Countess of Dysart in her own right was (the second wife of the Duke) saw her titles and her estate of Ham House, Petersham, London (then in Surrey) pass to her son from her own previous marriage.

*Lieutenant-Colonel John Maitland (1732–1779) was the tenth son (eighth-surviving childhood) of the sixth Earl, active in the Battle of Stono Ferry and Siege of Savannah.

<doc id="444886" wikidata="Q611361" url="?curid=444886" title="Chthonic deities">
<text>In Greek mythology, deities referred to as chthonic () or chthonian () were gods or spirits who inhabited the underworld or existed in or under the earth, and were typically associated with death or fertility. The terms &quot;chthonic&quot; and &quot;chthonian&quot; are derived from the Ancient Greek word () meaning &#x27;earth&#x27; or &#x27;soil&#x27;. The Greek adjective () means &#x27;in, under, or beneath the earth&#x27;, which can be differentiated from (), which speaks to the living surface of land on the earth. In Greek, () is a descriptive word for things relating to the underworld, which was in antiquity sometimes applied as an epithet to deities such Hermes, Demeter, and Zeus.

The chthonic deities have been compared to the more commonly referred-to Olympic gods and their associated rites and cults. Olympic gods are understood to reference that which exists above the earth, particularly in the sky. Gods that are related to agriculture are also considered to have chthonic associations as planting and growing take place in part under the earth.

==Relationship to Olympian deities==
Chthonic and ouranic, or olympic, are not completely opposite descriptors. They do not cleanly differentiate types of gods and worship into distinct categories, but represent a cultic spectrum. These terms communicate associations with the underworld and/or agriculture. This makes some deities such as Hades, Persephone, and the Erinyes more likely to be considered chthonic due to their proximity to the underworld. 

While this is the case, virtually any god could be considered chthonic to emphasize different aspects of the god. For example, Demeter and Hermes are categorized within the twelve Olympian gods but are often considered chthonic. Zeus has also been referenced with the surname &quot;chthonios&quot;, demonstrating the situational use of a chthonic description.

==Epithets==

In Ancient Greece, the names of deities were sometimes followed by an epithet, similar in concept to a surname. In this context, the purpose of an epithet was to describe a characteristic or association of a deity. The epithets &#x27;chthonios&#x27; and &#x27;chthonia&#x27; would follow the name of a god or goddess to reference their relationship either to the underworld or agriculture. 

For example, Hermes Chthonios references Hermes&#x27; role as the underworld escort. In contrast, Charon does not necessitate a chthonic epithet as his relation to the underworld is his main attribution. Additional examples of deities with recorded epithets include Demeter Chthonia, Ge Chthonia, Persephone Chthonia, Zeus Chthonios, and Hecate Chthonia.

==Common chthonic deities==
As discussed, many deities can be considered chthonic based upon what attributes are being referenced. Though this is the case, a few gods are most commonly considered chthonic due to their considerable role in the underworld and/or agriculture. These include Hades as he is the ruler of the underworld. Persephone is the Queen of the Underworld alongside Hades. She spends half the year in the underworld and the other half above the earth. The period when Persephone is in the underworld corresponds with winter while she personifies spring when she returns to above the earth.

It is for these reasons that she is mainly associated with the underworld as well as agriculture. Demeter is related to the underworld as she attempts to rescue Persephone from Hades in her grief. She is associated with agriculture and fertility. The Furies, or the Erinyes, reside in the underworld and are known for vengeance.

==Chthonic cult==
Offerings were a significant aspect of Ancient Greek religion. They were used to communicate with the gods and commonly took the forms of sacrifice and libation. Offerings were central to the worship of both chthonic and ouranic gods, though the specifics of these rituals differed. These differences provide insight into the ways in which Greeks perceived chthonic and ouranic deities as well as the ways they related to them.

=== Sacrifice ===

Ouranic sacrifices took place during the daytime and included wine as a libation. They were performed on high altars which resided outside of temples. The animal sacrifice was roasted with the smoke traveling upward toward the sky, in the direction of the Olympic gods. Once cooked, the worshippers would feast on the sacrifice with the idea that they were sharing this meal with the gods. The worshippers would eat the consumable portions of the animal and burn the rest for the god. While performing the sacrifice, worshippers would raise their palms open and upward, again gesturing toward the sky where the ouranic gods resided.

Chthonic sacrifice was commonly defined by offering a black or dark-hided animal to the deity. Worshippers did not consume the sacrifice themselves, but instead burned the entirety of the animal for the god. This type of sacrifice is called a holocaust, defined by the completely burned and destroyed nature of the offering. The sacrifice was performed on a low altar or in a pit in the ground, offered in the direction of the earth where chthonic deities would reside. The animal sacrifice was sometimes buried as well. 

The temples in which these sacrifices were performed were typically built outside city walls with caves and grottos being popular locations, believed to be openings for chthonic deities. Worshippers lowered their palms and faced them downwards toward the earth and underworld, in the direction of the chthonic gods. The goal of chthonic worship was to interact with gods beneath the earth so offerings were directed toward the ground to reach these deities. For this reason, incense was not used in Chthonic worship, as the smoke would rise upwards rather than downwards. Wine was not utilized in this form of worship, but instead honey was a common libation used.

Sacrificial practices would not always follow these exact patterns, but these are differences which can allude to whether the worshipper is conducting an ouranic or chthonic sacrifice. Though the specifics of chthonic and ouranic sacrifice differ, they both have similar goals. In both scenarios, worshippers perform sacrifices to communicate and forge a relationship with the gods. They may perform a sacrifice to thank, honor, or request a favor from a god.

== Scholarly controversy ==
There is scholarly debate regarding whether the distinction of chthonic is historically accurate and/or useful. Some scholars, including van Straten, argue that the term is not archaeologically verifiable. Some of these scholars believe that the modern use of chthonic is much more binary and concrete than it was in Ancient Greece. Schlesier notes that discussions of chthonic practices often create a false sense of &quot;normal&quot; worship and &quot;deviant&quot; worship, again citing the stark binary which modern scholars may fall into.

In response, Scullion articulates the benefits of the term chthonic as long as one also understands the fact that chthonic and Olympian are not mutually exclusive categories. The term serves to highlight differing aspects of religious practice. Scholars emphasize the importance of reserving the label of chthonic for situations that were explicitly labeled as such in Ancient Greece.

<text>The Baptist Union of Southern Africa is a Baptist Christian denomination in South Africa. It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance and the Evangelical Alliance of South Africa. The headquarters is in Roodepoort in Gauteng province

==History==
The Baptist Union of Southern Africa has its origins in the first Baptist churches in Salem, Eastern Cape and in Grahamstown founded in 1823 by William Miller, an English Baptist pastor. The first ordained Baptist preacher to travel to South Africa was William Davies, who was sent by the Baptist Missionary Society in England. He arrived in 1832 and ministered in Grahamstown for a short period. Work in Kariega, about 16 miles from Grahamstown, began in 1834. A German settlement around 1860 brought the first German Baptist work led by Carsten Langheim. A German pastor, Carl H. Gutsche, baptized J. D. Odendall, who founded the first Dutch-speaking Baptist church in South Africa in 1886. The &quot;Baptist Union&quot; was founded in 1877 by four English-speaking churches and one German-speaking church. The &quot;South African Baptist Missionary Society&quot; was formed in 1892. Black Baptist churches united to form the &quot;Bantu Baptist Church&quot; in 1927, under the auspices of the &quot;South African Baptist Missionary Society&quot;.

According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 537 churches and 36,591 members.

==Schools==
In 1951, the Baptist Union establishes the &quot;Baptist Theological College of Southern Africa&quot; in Randburg and the &quot;Cape Town Baptist Seminary&quot; in 1974 in Cape Town.

== Missionary Organization ==
The Convention has a missionary organization, Missions Board. 

== Social programs ==
It has a humanitarian organization, Deed of Love Ministry. 

==Associations==
The Baptist Union of Southern Africa comprises a number of associations and networks. Each association or network is made up of a number of autonomous local churches which prescribe to Christian tenets of belief and Baptist distinctives and hold voluntary membership with an association.

<text>Jason Shiga (born 1976) is an American cartoonist who incorporates puzzles, mysteries and unconventional narrative techniques into his work.

==Early life==
Jason Shiga is from Oakland, California. His father, Seiji Shiga, was an animator who worked on the 1964 Rankin-Bass production &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot;. Jason Shiga was a pure mathematics major at the University of California at Berkeley, from which he graduated in 1998.

==Career==
Shiga is credited as the &quot;Maze Specialist&quot; for Issue #18 (Winter 2005/2006) of the literary journal &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly&quot;, which features a solved maze on the front cover and a (slightly different) unsolved maze on the back. The title page of each story in the journal is headed by a maze segment labeled with numbers leading to the first pages of other stories.

Shiga has also drawn and written several comics and illustrated features for &quot;Nickelodeon Magazine&quot;, some of which feature his original creations, and some starring Nickelodeon characters such as SpongeBob SquarePants and the &quot;Fairly OddParents&quot;.

Shiga makes a cameo appearance in the Derek Kirk Kim comic &quot;Ungrateful Appreciation&quot; as a Rubik&#x27;s Cube-solving nerd.

===Techniques and materials===
According to the rear credits page of &quot;Empire State: A Love Story&quot;, Shiga, who was inspired by an actual Greyhound Bus trip from Oakland to New York to create that story, pencilled it with a yellow No. 2 pencil on copy paper. He then inked it with a lightbox and a 222 size Winsor &amp; Newton brush, and lettered it with a Micron 08 felt-tip pen. The colors were applied digitally by John Pham.

<text>Kånna is a locality situated in Ljungby Municipality, Kronoberg County, Sweden with 352 inhabitants in 2010.

The name Kånna is guessed to mean &quot;swamp&quot;. In this area during the Iron Age people used to settle on higher grounds where it was drier. There have been found Viking burial places and settlements by archaeologists which all are located on higher grounds. During the 18th century there was a church together with a village in Kånna.
In 1890 there was a railroad made through the area which was part of &quot;Skåne-Smålands Järnväg&quot;.

In late 2015, politicians in Ljungby laid plans to make accommodation for refugees in the old school building in Kånna, which had been disused since 2011. Shortly after, the old school building was burned down in a fire. The fire began at ~1:00 a.m. on Saturday, October 17, 2015.

<doc id="444906" wikidata="Q1384202" url="?curid=444906" title="Exotica (film)">
<text>Exotica is a 1994 Canadian film written and directed by Atom Egoyan, and starring Bruce Greenwood, Mia Kirshner, Don McKellar, Arsinée Khanjian, and Elias Koteas. Set primarily in the fictional Exotica strip club in Toronto, the film concerns a father grieving over the loss of a child and his obsession with a young stripper. It was inspired by Egoyan&#x27;s curiosity about the role strip clubs play in sex-obsessed societies. &quot;Exotica&quot; was filmed in Toronto in 1993.

Marketed as an erotic thriller on its release in Canada and the United States, the film proved to be a major box office success for English-language Canadian cinema, and received positive reviews. It won numerous awards, including the FIPRESCI Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and eight Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture.

== Plot ==
Francis Brown, a tax auditor for Revenue Canada, is a regular visitor to a Toronto strip club called Exotica. He always has Christina, an exotic dancer dressed in a schoolgirl uniform, give him a private dance. This inspires the jealousy of the club&#x27;s DJ, Eric, Christina&#x27;s former boyfriend who has also impregnated the club&#x27;s owner, Zoe. While at the club, Francis pays his brother Harold&#x27;s teenage daughter, Tracey, to &quot;babysit&quot;. However, Francis has no children and the girl merely practices music alone on his piano until Francis returns and drives her home. Francis&#x27; relationship with Harold is strained, as Francis learned that Harold and Francis&#x27; wife had been having an affair before she died in a car accident that left Harold a paraplegic. Francis&#x27; daughter, Lisa, had been kidnapped and murdered a few months before the accident, and he was one of the suspects but was later exonerated. These events have left a huge psychological scar on Francis.

In his professional life, Francis is sent to audit an exotic pet store owned and operated by Thomas Pinto, an introverted gay man profiting from the illegal import of a rare bird species. Thomas has been smuggling hyacinth macaw eggs, and his operation has afforded him hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, spurring suspicion from Canadian authorities. Francis soon discovers these illegal activities in Thomas&#x27; financial records.

Francis is eventually banned from Exotica when Eric manipulates him into touching Christina during one of her dances, violating the club&#x27;s rules. Having realized that Eric intentionally set out to get Francis banned from the club, he vows to murder him. Armed with the knowledge of Thomas&#x27;s tax evasion, Francis blackmails Thomas into visiting Exotica, and instructs him to touch Christina during one of her dances, so that Thomas too will be thrown out of the club; Francis intends to use this as an opportunity to infiltrate the club and murder Eric.

Francis affixes Thomas with a wiretap so that he can listen in on Thomas&#x27;s visit to Exotica. While Christina gives Thomas a lap dance, he attempts to glean information from her, and the two have a conversation which Francis listens to from his parked car. Christina explains to Thomas that she and Francis share a relationship of mutual dependency, and reveals to Thomas personal details about Francis&#x27;s life, specifically his daughter&#x27;s murder. A distraught Francis exits his car and waits for Eric outside the club. Confronting Eric with a gun, Francis is defused when Eric reveals he and Christina, who met each other while volunteering in a search party for the missing Lisa, were the ones who discovered Lisa&#x27;s dead body. Francis embraces Eric.

In a flashback, Francis drives a teenage Christina—who, at that time, worked for Francis and his wife as Lisa&#x27;s babysitter—to her parents&#x27; home. During these routine drives, Francis would often comfort Christina over her troubled home life. As Francis drops Christina off at her house, he assures her that she can always confide in him.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
=== Development ===

Director Atom Egoyan, who wrote the screenplay, first conceived of the story in the fall of 1992, intrigued by the ritualistic nature of table dances and the rule that clients can not touch the dancers, envisioning a story of a dancer having a main customer. He believed a strip club could be an important setting for a film because of society&#x27;s sexual obsessions, and the roles of such clubs as &quot;a collective sexual outlet&quot;. While wanting to portray the clubs accurately, he also believed he could bring a skeptical perspective.

He began working on the screenplay in February 1993. In writing it, he &quot;wanted to structure the story like a striptease, gradually revealing an emotionally loaded history&quot;. He also cited thriller films as an influence. Although the city in the film is not named, Egoyan stated &quot;Exotica&quot; and his other films portray &quot;different areas of Toronto&quot;.

The film had CAD 2 million budget, with CAD 900,000 coming from Telefilm Canada and the Ontario Film Development Corporation pledging CAD 700,000. To save money, Egoyan&#x27;s own 1990 Volvo 240 station wagon was used as Francis&#x27;s car.

=== Casting ===
With the script completed in April 1993, Egoyan began casting the film and choosing his crew, a process that took two months.
Egoyan&#x27;s wife Arsinée Khanjian played the club owner Zoe, having appeared in all of his previous films. Zoe is pregnant with Eric&#x27;s child, and in reality, Khanjian was pregnant during filming, with Egoyan&#x27;s son Arshile. Egoyan later expressed regret for surrounding Khanjian with nude women when she was unsure how her own body would change during her first pregnancy.

Bruce Greenwood was cast in the film after he met Egoyan through a mutual friend in a bar, before the director had raised his international profile. Greenwood had previously appeared in &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; and &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, and the two became friends.

=== Filming ===
Art directors Richard Paris and Linda Del Rosario built the Exotica strip club set in an unused room in the Party Centre, a Toronto building, with construction commencing in May 1993. During production, several people arrived at the set believing it was a real club. For the outside of the club, the filmmakers used a shop on Mutual Street which has since been torn down, outside Metropolitan United Church. Osgoode Hall is used for the opera house.

The cinematography was done by Paul Sarossy, with Egoyan saying the goal of the camerawork was to capture the perspective of a missing character, in this case Francis&#x27; dead daughter. Principal photography was completed by July. Composer Mychael Danna recorded his score for the film from India, with influences from classical music in India.

== Release ==
&quot;Exotica&quot; was invited to compete in the Cannes Film Festival in May 1994, the first invitation for a Canadian film in several years. Based on the good reactions from film festivals, the film was able to fully recoup its CAD 2 million budget via international pre-sales even before getting theatrical release in Canada. The film was released on three screens in Toronto by Alliance Communications Corporation on September 29, 1994. In the United States, the film was initially released by Miramax Films in six cities; its distributors were impressed when &quot;Exotica&quot; grossed $14,379 per screen, allowing for a broader release to 433 screens. Miramax Films marketed the film as an erotic thriller. Egoyan stated that he was &quot;very demanding that the image of Christina dressed as a schoolgirl won&#x27;t be used on any posters, because it&#x27;s an image that only makes sense in the context of the film&quot;, adding that he was &quot;aware of how [the image] could be abused.&quot; Egoyan also commented that he felt &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an erotic film at all. You begin by assuming the relationship between Francis and Christina is perverse, that he has a pedophiliac attraction to her. When you realize what is actually going on, it&#x27;s platonic in the truest sense.&quot;

The film played in Toronto for 25 weeks, at one point in an IMAX theatre. In the United States, it was initially released in 500 theatres. In the Philippines, the film was released on July 27, 1995, with ads containing the tagline, &quot;After &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and &quot;Belle Époque&quot; comes another controversial and multi-awarded hot film.&quot;

=== Home media ===
On home video, &quot;Exotica&quot; went out of print in Canada for years, but was available on DVD in England through the company Network. In 2012, Alliance Films released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in Canada, with commentary from Egoyan and Danna. The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray and DVD on September 20, 2022 in the United States.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
The film grossed $32,856 in its opening weekend in Toronto. The film&#x27;s initial box office performance in its limited release was considered &quot;huge&quot; by distributors. In March 1995, U.S. critic Roger Ebert reported &quot;Exotica&quot; was breaking box office records in Canada.

By 1995, &quot;Exotica&quot; had grossed $1.75 million in Canada, a substantial sum for English-language Canadian cinema. The film ended its run after grossing $5.13 million in the United States and Canada. The film grossed around CAD 15 million at worldwide box office.&quot;Exotica&quot; was Egoyan&#x27;s biggest financial success, and has been called his box-office breakthrough.

=== Critical response ===

&quot;Exotica&quot; received positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 39 reviews and gave the film an approval rating of 95%, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Exotica&quot; simmers with sex and obsession, while successfully doubling as an extreme character study.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on 25 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film four stars upon the film&#x27;s initial release, calling it &quot;a movie labyrinth, winding seductively into the darkest secrets of a group of people who should have no connection with one another, but do&quot;. He judged it Egoyan&#x27;s best film to date and said Mia Kirshner &quot;combines sexual allure with a kindness that makes her all the more appealing&quot;. In 2009, Ebert added the film to his Great Movies list, calling it a &quot;deep, painful film about those closed worlds of stage-managed lust&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum called it &quot;A must-see&quot; and &quot;lush and affecting&quot;, praising the score, the set and the camera movements. Leonard Klady, writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, called it &quot;a haunting, chilling experience&quot;, albeit with an ending that was &quot;anticlimactic, fuzzy and considerably less than a knockout emotional punch&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a B+, concluding &quot;Like Christina&#x27;s dance, the movie is a gorgeous tease, an artful promise of something that never quite arrives&quot;. Desson Howe, writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, said it &quot;starts off promisingly, but eventually sinks into its own convoluted oblivion&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Exotica&quot; is Egoyan&#x27;s most accomplished and seductive film to date&quot;, and less flashy than the upcoming &quot;Showgirls&quot; (1995) promised to be. B. Ruby Rich of &quot;The Advocate&quot; wrote the film is &quot;a jigsaw puzzle of the emotions in which sex spells out whole language of human behavior&quot;, and said the cast, including Kirshner and Don McKellar, &quot;rivet our attention on these characters&quot;. Critics complimented use of the song &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; by Leonard Cohen.

In 2001, Girish Shambu, writing for &quot;Senses of Cinema&quot;, said &quot;Atom Egoyan&#x27;s sad, elegant &quot;Exotica&quot; (1994) is at once intimate and remote, concrete and abstract&quot;, praising Bruce Greenwood for &quot;quiet gravity&quot; and Sarah Polley as &quot;precociously perfect&quot;. In 2002, readers of &quot;Playback&quot; voted it the seventh greatest Canadian film ever made. In 2012, Jeff Heinrich of the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; gave the film five stars, calling it &quot;An utterly hypnotic, X-rated art film&quot; with a &quot;haunting score&quot;. Mike D&#x27;Angelo of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; stated &quot;&quot;Exotica&quot; —much like Egoyan’s subsequent film, &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;— proves to be a devastatingly cathartic exploration of tragedy&#x27;s aftermath and the ways that people attempt to cope with inexpressible grief&quot;. In 2015, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named &quot;Exotica&quot; as one of &quot;the 10 best (and worst) stripper movies&quot;, calling Egoyan &quot;a then-wunderkind of Canadian cinema&quot; and noting the film won awards at both Cannes and the AVN Awards, which are for pornography.

In 2001, an industry poll conducted by &quot;Playback&quot; named it the fifth best Canadian film of the preceding 15 years.

=== Accolades ===

At the 1994 Cannes Film Festival, &quot;Exotica&quot; won the FIPRESCI Prize, the first time an English-language Canadian film had won the honour. At the 1994 Genie Awards, the film won eight prizes, including Best Motion Picture and Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Egoyan.

<text>Philip Greenspun (born September 28, 1963) is an American computer scientist, educator, early Internet entrepreneur, and pilot who was a pioneer in developing online communities like photo.net.

==Biography==
Greenspun was born on September 28, 1963, grew up in Bethesda, Maryland, and received a B.S. in Mathematics from MIT in 1982. After working for HP Labs in Palo Alto and Symbolics, he became a founder of ICAD, Inc. Greenspun returned to MIT to study electrical engineering and computer science, eventually receiving a Ph.D.

Working with Isaac Kohane of Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Greenspun was the developer of an early Web-based electronic medical record system. The system is described in &quot;Building national electronic medical record systems via the World Wide Web&quot; (1996). Greenspun and Kohane continue to work together on a medical informatics at Harvard Medical School.

In 1995, Greenspun was hired to lead development of Hearst Corporation&#x27;s Internet services, which included early e-commerce sites. In 1997 he co-founded ArsDigita, a web services company which grew to $20 million in annual revenues by 2000.

==Photo.net and ArsDigita==

In 1993, Greenspun founded photo.net, an online community for people helping each other to improve their photographic skills. He seeded the community with &quot;Travels with Samantha&quot;, a photo-illustrated account of a trip from Boston to Alaska and back. Photo.net became a business in 2000 with the help of some of his cofounders Rajeev Surati and Waikit Lau. Having grown to 600,000 registered users, it was acquired by NameMedia in 2007 for $6 million, according to documents filed in connection with a planned public offering of NameMedia shares. Greenspun founded the open-source software company ArsDigita and, as CEO, grew it to about $20 million in revenue before taking a venture capital investment.

Greenspun was an early developer of database-backed Web sites, which became the dominant approach to engineering sites with user contributions, e.g., Amazon.com. Greenspun was also a developer of one of the first Web-based electronic medical record systems. Greenspun&#x27;s Oracle-based community site LUSENET was an important early host of free forums.

==Aviation==
Greenspun was employed as a commercial pilot for Delta Air Lines subsidiary Comair from 2008 until it ceased operation in 2012. According to the FAA Airmen registry, Greenspun holds an Airline Transport Pilot License and Flight Instructor certificates for both airplanes and helicopters, as well as type ratings for two turbojet-powered airplanes. Greenspun is listed as an instructor at the East Coast Aero Club and was interviewed by NPR regarding the success of a Groupon helicopter lesson offer.

==Publications==

Greenspun has written several textbooks on developing Internet applications, including &quot;Philip and Alex&#x27;s Guide to Web Publishing&quot;, &quot;SQL for Web Nerds&quot;, and &quot;Software Engineering for Internet Applications&quot;, the textbook for an MIT course. Greenspun is the editor of &quot;Medical School 2020&quot;, which provides a first-person account by a medical student.

==Teaching==

Greenspun and his co-founders at ArsDigita started a non-profit foundation that ran the ArsDigita Prize, an award for young web developers, and the ArsDigita University, a tuition-free one-year program teaching the core computer science curriculum, one course at a time. Winners of the Prize include a 12 year old Aaron Swartz.

Greenspun has taught electrical engineering and computer science at MIT. One of Greenspun&#x27;s most famous students is Randal Pinkett, who built an online community for low-income housing residents in Greenspun&#x27;s 6.171 Software Engineering for Internet Applications course. Pinkett went on to win NBC TV show &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. In 2003, Greenspun helped teach a newly designed circuits and electronics course at MIT.

In January 2011 and again in January 2012, Greenspun taught an intensive RDBMS/SQL programming course at MIT using Google Docs to coordinate classroom instruction.

==Charitable work==

In 2007, Greenspun donated $20,000 to Wikimedia Foundation to start a project fund for the payment of illustrators to supply illustrations for use on Wikimedia Foundation projects.

Greenspun is a volunteer for Angel Flight and, on December 6, 2010, assisted in the first nationally arranged kidney paired-donation in which kidneys were flown from Lebanon, New Hampshire to St. Louis and vice versa.

In December 2013, Greenspun donated $10,000 to Kids on Computers (KOC), a 501(c)(3) non-profit which sets up computer labs in areas where kids do not have access to technology. In recognition of Greenspun&#x27;s donation, the KOC lab at Escuela Manuel Gonzalez Gatica was named the Gittes Family Lab in honor of his grandfather. Avni Khatri, President of  Kids on Computers in 2012 credits her time at ArsDigita as where she learned the value of FOSS and how it can help bridge and connect virtual and real-world communities.

<doc id="444912" wikidata="Q40461" url="?curid=444912" title="Bachata (music)">
<text>Bachata is a genre of music that originated in the Dominican Republic in the 20th century. It contains elements of European (mainly Spanish music), indigenous Taino and African musical elements, representing the cultural diversity of the Dominican population. The form of dance, bachata, also developed with the music.

In the 1990s bachata&#x27;s instrumentation changed from nylon string Spanish guitar and maracas of traditional bachata to the electric steel string and guira of modern bachata. Bachata further transformed in the 21st century with the creation of urban bachata styles by bands such as Monchy y Alexandra and Aventura. These new modern styles of bachata became an international phenomenon, and today bachata is one of the most popular styles of Latin music.

The original term used to name the genre was &quot;amargue&quot; (&quot;bitterness&quot;, &quot;bitter music&quot;), until the mood-neutral term &quot;bachata&quot; became popular. Bachata originates from the pan-Latin American style called bolero and son. The genre mixed these and the troubadour singing tradition common in Latin America (and later, from the mid-1980s, merengue). The first recognised bachata recorded was a composed by José Manuel Calderón in 1962 (&quot;Borracho de amor&quot;).

:&quot;It has been compared to the blues in the past in terms of, structurally, the kind of folks who were making it, people on the margins of society. It&#x27;s a little more cheerful, though, than the blues. Even songs where they&#x27;re singing about the treachery of a woman ... if you just listen to them musically, they still sound kind of sweet.&quot;
== Instrumentations ==
The typical bachata group consists of five instruments: requinto (lead guitar), segunda (rhythm guitar), bass guitar, bongos and güira. The segunda serves the purpose of adding syncopation to the music. Bachata groups mainly play a straightforward style of bolero (lead guitar instrumentation using arpeggiated repetitive chords is a distinctive characteristic of bachata), but when they change to merengue-based bachata, the percussionist will switch from bongo to a tambora drum. In the 1960s and 1970s, maracas were used instead of güira. The change in the 1980s from maracas to the more versatile güira was made as bachata was becoming more dance oriented.

==History==

Bachata arose in the poor and working class areas of the country. During the 1960s and early 1970s, while bachata was known as amargue music, it was seen as music of the lower class by middle-upper-class Dominicans. The genre&#x27;s popularity rose in the 1980s and early 1990s when the rhythm began to reach the mainstream media. The genre was declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of humanity by UNESCO.

During much of its history, bachata music was disregarded by middle-upperclass Dominican society and associated with rural underdevelopment and crime. As recently as the 1980s, bachata was considered too vulgar, crude and musically rustic to be broadcast on television or radio in the Dominican Republic.
=== 1950s: Trujillo&#x27;s dictatorship and the origins of bachata music ===
Although the first official bachata song was released in 1962, bachata music had already existed informally in &quot;el campo&quot; (here refers to the rural areas of the country), the rural or countryside parts of the Dominican Republic where it originated. Prior to the 1960s, at the time of Trujillo&#x27;s dictatorship accompanied by censorship, the word &quot;bachata&quot; meant an impromptu party in el campo, characterized by its melancholy and bittersweet lyrics, singing, and dancing. Informal bachateros at the time were majority poor, working class people and so was their audience. Given the initial demographics of bachata music’s audience and musicians, Trujillo harbored negative emotions towards bachata music and stigmatized it. As a result, bachata became synonymous with poverty, delinquency, lack of education, and prostitution to the middle and upper-class Dominican society. Bachata was also referred to as &quot;música cachivache&quot;, or music of little worth, and &quot;música de guardia&quot;, or music for low ranking military and police men. Still, Bachata music prevailed through the 50s as poor, working class people played bachata music in bars and brothels. also participated in the informal music sector where they paid studios to record songs on records or vinyls and sold them to people and establishments for low prices. Establishments like colmados in el campo bought popular bachata recordings and played them on jukeboxes for their customers to listen to while shopping.

=== 1960s: Trujillo&#x27;s death and the spread of bachata music ===
The 1960s signal the immense spread of bachata music—the decade saw the birth of the Dominican music industry and of the bachata music which would dominate it.

Following Trujillo&#x27;s death and end of his dictatorship in 1961, there was an opening for bachata music within the music industry amidst the loosened restrictions. The end of Trujillo&#x27;s dictatorship motivated people from el campo to migrate to Santo Domingo, the capital and largest city in the Dominican Republic—before then, strict migration policies prevented the movement of people within and outside the country. As people settled in the city, they continued to play Bachata music because it allowed them to express the struggle and poverty they experienced in the city. Along with Bachata&#x27;s audience in the city, bachateros from el campo who also migrated to Santo Domingo took advantage of the city&#x27;s growing music industry.

The music industry increased music production and broadcasting after the end of Trujillo&#x27;s dictatorship. When it came to bachata music, music industry leaders began recording, producing, and broadcasting bachata songs as long as musicians had the financial means to pay for the service. Soon enough, José Manuel Calderón recorded the first official bachata songs released on 45 rpm and got air-time on the radio stations for select songs (&quot;Borracho de amor&quot; and &quot;Que será de mi (Condena)&quot;). Following Calderon&#x27;s bachata debut, recordings by the likes of such as Rodobaldo Duartes, Rafael Encarnacion, Ramoncito Cabrera, El Chivo Sin Ley, Corey Perro, Antonio Gómez Sacero, Luis Segura, Louis Loizides, Eladio Romero Santos, Ramón Cordero were also released. Ramon Pichardo, an entrepreneur, offered bachateros the option to finance records—paying the service fee in installments—and publish them on a record label. Singers such as Melinda Rodriguez and Tatico Henríquez were a few of the rural artists who were able to take advantage of this opportunity and start careers in the Dominican music industry. While the bachatas recorded in the 1960s had a distinct Dominican style, they were regarded at the time as a variant of bolero, as the term &quot;bachata&quot;, which originally referred to an informal party, had not yet come into use.

As studios began recording bachata music in the 1960s, bachata music listeners beyond the countryside were exposed to the music. Radio Guarachita, hosted by Radhamés Aracena in 1966, was the only radio station at the time that played and centered bachata music. Aracena broadcast popular bachata songs produced in the 60s and worked with bachateros to produce music. Listeners regarded Bachata music as a variant of bolero since the term &quot;bachata&quot;&quot;&quot; still referred to impromptu parties.

Even though Bachata music began to spread, anti-bachata sentiment from Trujillo&#x27;s rule continued into the 1960s. A campaign ensued to brand bachata in this negative light. Middle and upper-class Dominican society denounced bachata, calling bachata music a form of cultural backwardness. Bachata music had lyrics with sexual meaning or references, which was frowned upon by middle-upper-class Dominicans because bachateros did not have academic backgrounds. Since Bachata music was not widely accepted by society for its &quot;vulgar and sensual&quot; nature, middle and upper-class people refrained from listening and dancing to Bachata music to protect their reputation. They attached a negative connotation to the word &quot;bachata&quot; and used it as an insult to the music.

=== 1970s–1980s: The continual growth of bachata music ===
The popularity of bachata music steadily rose during the 1970s and 1980s.

In the 1970s, bachata music was hardly played on radio stations other than Radio Guarachita and unmentioned on television and in print. Bachateros were also barred from performing in upper-class venues. Bachateros were barred from performing in high society venues. Even so, many Bachateros performanced in bars, brothels, and small venues in poor city neighborhoods and el campo. Bachata music became known as &quot;la musica de amargue&quot;, or bitter music, because it was still influenced by despair, sex, and hardship, which only fueled anti-bachata sentiment in middle-upper-class Dominican society. Despite its unofficial censorship, bachata remained widely popular, while orchestral merengue benefited from the country&#x27;s major publicity outlets.

By the 1980s, different styles of Bachata music began to appear. Blas Durán took &quot;la musica de amargue&quot; and &quot;introduced musical innovations such as an electric rather than acoustic lead guitar, faster tempi, and multitrack recording.&quot; Durán was the first to record with electric guitar in his 1987 bachata-merengue song, &quot;Mujeres hembras.&quot; Due to popular demand, more radio stations began playing bachata, and bachateros soon found themselves performing on television as well. Bachata style merengues, or guitar merengues, also began to appear. Other Dominican bachateros that emerged from this time period were Marino Perez, Silvestre Peguero, and Leonardo Paniagua. Beyond the Dominican Republic, Dominican people continued to migrate outside the Dominican Republic years after Trujillo&#x27;s death, carrying bachata music with them where they went such as New York City.

=== 1990s–2000s: The acceptance of bachata music ===

Juan Luis Guerra played a pivotal role in bringing bachata music to an international audience, extending its reach beyond its Dominican Republic origins. The genre&#x27;s rising global popularity was accompanied by a fresh, contemporary influence on its musical style. This evolution in bachata not only transformed its sound but also its associated dance form. Dance studios began to incorporate this modernized version of bachata, teaching enhanced techniques and more elaborate movement patterns, reflecting the genre&#x27;s dynamic progression.

By the early 1990s, the sound was further modernized and the bachata scene was dominated by two new artists: Luis Vargas and Antony Santos. Both incorporated a large number of bachata-merengues in their repertoires. Santos, Vargas and the many new style bachateros who would follow achieved a level of stardom that was unimaginable to the bachateros who preceded them—they were the first generation of pop bachata artists. It was also at this time that bachata began to emerge internationally as a music of Hispanic dance-halls.
Juan Luis Guerra&#x27;s Grammy-winning 1992 release, &quot;Bachata Rosa&quot;, is credited with making the genre more acceptable and helping bachata achieve legitimacy and international recognition. Although he used the word &quot;bachata&quot; in the album title, his songs have a more traditional bolero sound.

By the beginning of the 21st century, the bachata group Aventura had taken the bachata envisioned by Juan Luis Guerra in the early 1990s to new heights. Led by lead singer Anthony &quot;Romeo&quot; Santos, they revolutionized and modernized the genre. They sold out Madison Square Garden numerous times and released countless top ten hits on the hot Latin charts including two number one hits &quot;Por un segundo&quot; and &quot;Dile al Amor&quot;. Other big bachata acts in the decade included &quot;Monchy y Alexandra&quot; and Los Toros Band.

=== 2010s–present ===
Today, parallel to bachata music, fusion genres arose in Western countries such as the US, combining some of the rhythmic elements of bachata music with elements of Western music such as hip hop, R&amp;B, pop, techno and more. This fusion genre became popular among Western audiences, and often includes covers of Western pop songs played on MTV and non-Latin radio stations. Notable artists of the new fusion genre are Prince Royce, Xtreme and Toby Love, among others. By 2011, former Aventura member Romeo Santos also joined the fusion bandwagon, releasing several new albums which became popular in the US and other Western countries. Not only has bachata&#x27;s popularity changed but so has its lyrics; before the lyrics were mostly about a cheating relationship and hurt feelings but now it talks about love and is more romantic. According to &quot;Bachata: Música Del Pueblo&quot; (&quot;Bachata: Music of the People&quot;) the writers said: &quot;In the past decade, bachata has been transformed from a ballad-style guitar music of the rural poor in the Dominican Republic to the hottest new music in the international Latino music market.&quot;

<text>The Informbiro period was an era of Yugoslavia&#x27;s history following the Tito–Stalin split in mid-1948 that lasted until the country&#x27;s partial rapprochement with the Soviet Union in 1955 with the signing of the Belgrade declaration. After World War II in Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia&#x27;s new leadership under Josip Broz Tito pursued a foreign policy that did not align with the Eastern Bloc. Eventually, this led to public conflict, but the Yugoslav leadership decided not to acquiesce to Soviet demands, despite significant external and internal pressures. The period saw the persecution of the political opposition in Yugoslavia, resulting in thousands being imprisoned, exiled, or sent to forced labour. 100 Yugoslav citizens were seriously wounded or killed between 1948 and 1953 while some sources claim 400 victims during the existence of Goli otok prison camp. The purges included a significant number of members of Yugoslavia&#x27;s security apparatus and its military.

This break with the Eastern Bloc caused significant economic difficulties for Yugoslavia as the country relied on trade with the USSR and Soviet allies. Economic pressures within the country led to reforms that would ultimately result in the introduction of socialist self-management and increased decentralisation of the country through constitutional amendments formalising the reforms.

The United States saw the rift between the Eastern Bloc and Yugoslavia as an opportunity during the Cold War to fragment the Eastern Bloc further and consequently provided economic and military aid, loans, and diplomatic support to the country. The new foreign policy circumstances led Tito to end Yugoslav support of Communist forces in the Greek Civil War and concluded the Balkan Pact, an agreement of cooperation and defence with Greece and Turkey.

The period had an impact on Yugoslavia&#x27;s contemporary art and popular culture, as artists were encouraged to seek inspiration in the wartime struggle of the Yugoslav Partisans and the construction of new infrastructure. Decades later, many literary works and films covered the era&#x27;s events.

The descriptor &quot;Informbiro period&quot; arose from the Communist Information Bureau, an organisation initiated by Stalin that had aimed to reduce divergence among communist governments.

==Background==
Relations between Joseph Stalin and Josip Broz Tito were often strained during World War II as the Soviet Union and the Yugoslav Partisans, a resistance movement established following Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, pursued divergent interests other than defeating the Axis powers and promoting Communist ideas. Nonetheless, Soviet advisers arrived in Yugoslavia in the autumn of 1944 and promised economic and military assistance—specifically arms and aid to the defence industry. By February 1947, little aid had arrived. In September 1947, when the Soviets formed the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties, also known as the Cominform, they insisted on headquartering it in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, expanding their agents&#x27; access to Yugoslavia.

After the war, Stalin and Tito, and by extension the USSR and Yugoslavia, had increasingly divergent objectives and priorities in the areas of foreign relations, economic policies, and even in ideological approaches to the development of a Communist society. Despite these conflicting objectives, Stalin supported Yugoslav policy towards Albania, which treated it like a Yugoslav satellite state. The Soviet–Yugoslav relations took a significant turn to worse when Bulgaria and Yugoslavia signed a friendship and mutual assistance treaty in Bled in August 1947. The agreement, calling for greater integration between the two countries, was negotiated without consulting the USSR, leading Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov to denounce it. The conflict gradually grew until 1948 when it culminated in the Tito–Stalin split—pitting Yugoslavia against the USSR, supported by the rest of the Eastern Bloc through the Cominform, in the period of conflict or at least tense relations with all pro-Western Yugoslav neighbours, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Following the military conquests of Trieste and a part of Carinthia in the final days of World War II, Tito pressed territorial claims against Austria—specifically Carinthia and Burgenland hoping for a corridor to Czechoslovakia—and against Italy in the Julian March area, including Trieste. The immediate vicinity of the city was organised as the Free Territory of Trieste under divided military administration by Yugoslavs and Western Allies, while the latter controlled the city itself. Following the Tito–Stalin split, the Soviets withdrew their support for Yugoslavs in further resolution of the Trieste dispute, and switched from backing Yugoslavia in favour of Austria. Since 1947, Yugoslavia provided increasing aid to the Democratic Army of Greece (Δημοκρατικός Στρατός Ελλάδας, &quot;Dimokratikós Stratós Elládas&quot;, DSE) in the Greek Civil War. Even after Stalin obtained assurances from Yugoslav leadership that the aid would cease, Tito informed Nikos Zachariadis of the Communist Party of Greece that the DSE could count on further help.

==Cominformist purges==
===Persecution of internal enemies===

In the immediate aftermath of the Tito–Stalin split, the leadership of the ruling Communist Party of Yugoslavia (&quot;Komunistička partija Jugoslavije&quot;, KPJ) was faced with uncertainty over personal loyalty. Interior minister Aleksandar Ranković noted it was impossible to know who to trust and that one&#x27;s closest comrades may now be the enemy. Even as Tito and Stalin exchanged letters which led to their open split in early 1948, Tito called for action against central committee member Sreten Žujović and former minister of industry Andrija Hebrang. Žujović was the only person openly supporting Stalin when the central committee discussed Stalin&#x27;s direct accusations and who was his source of information. Tito alleged Hebrang was the main source for Soviet mistrust and tasked Ranković with charging him. Ranković fabricated charges that Hebrang became an Ustaše spy during his captivity in 1942 and that the Soviets subsequently blackmailed him using that information as leverage. Both Žujović and Hebrang were apprehended within a week. There were numerous victims of persecution beyond Žujović and Hebrang. Real or perceived supporters of Stalin were termed &quot;Cominformists&quot; or &quot;ibeovci&quot; as a pejorative initialism based on the first two words in the official name of the Cominform. Thousands were imprisoned, killed, or exiled.

In response to the situation in the country, Ranković established a special anti-Cominform staff in the State Security Administration (&quot;Uprava državne bezbednosti&quot;, UDB) consisting of his deputy, and nominal head of the UDB, Svetislav Stefanović Ćeća, Veljko Mićunović, Jovo Kapičić, Vojislav Biljanović, Mile Milatović, and Jefto Šašić as the head of the Counterintelligence Service (&quot;Kontraobaveštajna služba&quot;, KOS).

In 1948–51 alone, 55,663 KPJ members were registered as Cominformists, or 19.52% of the 1948 party membership. However, in the same period, the membership was augmented by the introduction of more than half a million new members. The number and proportion of Cominformists in the KPJ membership varied substantially by federal constituent republics and regions, and as by ethnicity. More than half the members were registered in Serbia proper, while the highest proportion relative to the total population was found in Montenegro.

Such high numbers of Cominformists in Serbia in absolute terms, and in Montenegro in relative terms compared to its population, are explained by the Russophilia traditionally observed there. The origins of this sentiment are linked to Imperial Russian aid in 1804–1815 during the Serbian Revolution coinciding with the 1806–1812 Russo-Turkish War, and subsequently, diplomatically as the Principality of Serbia gained diplomatic recognition in 1830. The sentiment was reinforced in Montenegro since the Russian Empire acted, or was perceived to have acted, to protect the Principality of Montenegro against the Ottoman Empire in the mid-18th century. By extension, this support was given to the USSR.

The exact number of those arrested remains uncertain, but in 1983, Radovan Radonjić stated that 16,288 were arrested and convicted, including 2,616 belonging to various levels of the KPJ leadership. According to Ranković, 51,000 people were killed, imprisoned or sent to forced labour. A majority of them were sentenced without a trial. Prisoners were held at numerous sites including actual prisons, as well as prison camps in Stara Gradiška and the repurposed Ustaše concentration camp in Jasenovac. A special-purpose prison camp was built for Cominformists on the uninhabited Adriatic islands of Goli Otok and Sveti Grgur in 1949.

===Purge of the military and security apparatus===

The secret police themselves were among organisations targeted by purges. Yugoslav sources indicate that 1,722 UDB servicemen and officers were convicted. Particularly wide-ranging purges were carried out against the UDB in Sarajevo after all of the UDB personnel of Sarajevo&#x27;s second district declared their support for the Cominform. Their action was echoed by UDB chiefs in Mostar and Banja Luka. At least seventeen UDB officers holding the rank of Lieutenant Colonel or higher in high-profile positions in the federal bodies or in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro were arrested, and several UDB officers escaped to Romania.

Support for the Soviets within the Yugoslav Army ranks is difficult to determine. Low-end estimates indicate that 10–15% of the army&#x27;s personnel favoured the Soviet position. Yugoslav sources estimate the number of military members arrested is in a range from 4,153 officers and soldiers put forward by Radonjić, to 7,000 imprisoned officers estimated by Milovan Đilas. The purge included 22 officers in the presidential guard regiment reporting directly to Tito, including Momčilo Đurić, wartime commander of the Yugoslav Partisan Supreme Headquarters escort battalion.

Forty-nine Yugoslav Army graduates of the Voroshilov, the Frunze, and other Soviet military academies were deemed potential Soviet supporters. Many of those attending such academies in the USSR at the time of the Tito–Stalin split never returned to Yugoslavia.

The split particularly affected the Air Force. Almost all Air Force officers had Soviet training, and some of them fled the country in air force planes. The defectors included Major General Pero Popivoda, who was the head of the air force operational service. Batajnica, Zemun, and Pančevo airbases near Belgrade saw several attacks by groups of saboteurs, while the Zemun airbase commander and his deputy fled to Romania.

==Opposition and resistance==
===Attempted coup===
In the immediate aftermath of the split, there was at least one failed attempt of a military coup d&#x27;état supported by the Soviets. Colonel General Arso Jovanović, who was chief of Tito&#x27;s wartime Supreme Headquarters and later the chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army headed it, supported by Major General Branko Petričević Kadja and Colonel Vladimir Dapčević. Border guards killed Jovanović near Vršac while he was attempting to flee to Romania, Petričević was arrested in Belgrade, and Dapčević was arrested just as he was about to cross the Hungarian border.

===Émigrés and infiltrators===
Tito faced opposition from a group of émigrés—Yugoslav nationals who were out of the country at the time of the split. According to Yugoslav sources, the group consisted of 4,928 people including 475 specifically chosen military and civilian experts sent to the USSR and elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc for training, and comparably few defectors. Initially, the Yugoslav ambassador to Romania, Radonja Golubović, led them. In addition to Golubović, the group included diplomats posted to Hungary, Sweden, Norway, and the United States. By late 1949, Popivoda was established as the undisputed leader of the exiled opposition, and the group named itself the League of Yugoslav Patriots for the Liberation of the Peoples of Yugoslavia from the Yoke of the Tito-Ranković Clique and Imperialist Slavery.

Soviet authorities organised the émigrés along several lines. They supported the publication of several newspapers advocating anti-Titoist efforts, the most influential being &quot;Za socijalističku Jugoslaviju&quot; (For Socialist Yugoslavia) and &quot;Nova borba&quot; (New Struggle). Radio Free Yugoslavia aired daily propaganda broadcasts from Bucharest. Various non-military experts were trained for a future takeover of the government, while military personnel were organised into four international brigades deployed to Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria near their Yugoslav borders, and an air force unit was set up in the Ural Mountains. The international brigades included thousands of personnel drawn from various Eastern Bloc countries touted as volunteers.

The Soviet allies blockaded their borders with Yugoslavia—where 7,877 border incidents took place. By 1953, Soviet or Soviet-backed incursions resulted in the killing of 27 Yugoslav security personnel. More than 700 agents are thought to have crossed the border into Yugoslavia—160 of whom were captured and 40 killed in combat.

===Insurrections===
The Yugoslav security apparatus also faced armed insurrection in several areas—most notably in Montenegro. As a result, an entire UDB division was deployed to Montenegro in the summer and autumn of 1948 to combat the insurrection led by former secretary of the KPJ organisation Ilija Bulatović, in the town of Bijelo Polje. In addition to the KPJ organisation there, large segments or entire organisations in Kolašin, Berane, Cetinje, Nikšić, Bar, and Danilovgrad voiced support for the Cominformists. A special task force, headed by Komnen Cerović, was added to the Montenegrin government to persecute the insurgents. They suppressed the rebellion but only temporarily. In 1949, Cerović&#x27;s force took out insurgent strongholds in the Monetenegrin part of Sandžak. Further uprisings took place in the Zeta River valley and the area between the republic&#x27;s capital, Titograd and Nikšić. Ultimately, the insurgents failed.

Two more insurrections, led by ethnic Serb veterans of the Partisan forces and former army officers, took place in the areas of Kordun, Lika, Banovina in Croatia, and just across the federal unit&#x27;s border in Bosnia and Herzegovina where rebellion centered on the city of Cazin in 1950. In the Cazin area, the bulk of the insurgents were actually Muslim peasants. The motivation for the twin rebellions appears more diverse, including real or perceived inadequate appreciation of the wartime efforts of the rebellion leaders, promises to abolish various taxes, and the restoration of King Petar II to the throne. Yugoslav authorities captured ten infiltrators, including eight former Chetniks, coming from Austria to support the rebels. The insurrections were put down quickly, and Yugoslav authorities ascribed them to Cominformism. Also, a likewise unsuccessful, small-scale rebellion took place in Slovenia at the same time.
===Albania&#x27;s Resistance during the Informbiro Era===

Throughout the Informbiro period, spanning from 1948 to 1954, Albania and Yugoslavia were embroiled in a series of armed confrontations fueled by territorial disputes and ideological differences between their leaders, Josip Broz Tito and Enver Hoxha. This era witnessed heightened tensions along the Albanian-Yugoslav border, making it a focal point of contention within the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. Additionally, Enver Hoxha also ordered the expulsion of all Yugoslav politicians and military personnel from across Albania.

==Impact on Yugoslav policies==
===Economic development until mid-1948===
Prior to 1948, the Yugoslav economy relied on state-controlled trade of agricultural products and raw materials to the USSR in exchange for processed goods and machinery. Overall shortages of machinery and local shortages of labour—especially skilled experts—plagued the economy. As the conflict with Stalin progressed, Yugoslavia decided to become self-sufficient and develop its military capabilities, which led to greater budget expenditures for infrastructure and personnel, and the establishment of research and development institutions. To offset the lack of machinery, third shifts were introduced in factories. Authorities mobilised, under threat of imprisonment, those not otherwise employed, and peasants not actively doing agricultural work, to work in mines extracting coal or ores for export, or at construction sites. Food and fuel were stockpiled for the military, leading to market shortages.

===Turning to the United States for aid===
By June 1948, Yugoslavia reached an agreement with the United States, allowing Yugoslav authorities to access their gold reserves held in the United States. At the same time, Yugoslavia announced it would like to trade with the West. Yugoslavia first requested assistance from the United States in summer 1948. In December, Tito announced strategic raw materials would be shipped to the West in return for increased trade.

In February 1949, the US decided to provide Tito with economic assistance and, in return, the US would demand Tito to cut support to the DSE when the internal situation in Yugoslavia allowed such a move without endangering his position. Ultimately, Secretary of State Dean Acheson took the position that the Yugoslav five-year plan must succeed if Tito was to prevail against Stalin and that, regardless of the nature of his regime, Tito was in the United States&#x27; interest. In October 1949, Yugoslavia received backing by the United States and won its bid for a seat on the United Nations Security Council, despite Soviet opposition.

===Economy following the rift with the USSR===

The Soviet-led blockade of Eastern Bloc trade with Yugoslavia came into effect gradually and remained incomplete until 1949. It first took the form of stoppage of oil from Albania, Hungary and Romania, but purchases from Allied authorities in the Free Territory of Trieste offset this. Trading with the United States began in 1948 when Yugoslavia purchased a steel blooming mill, fifteen oil drills, industrial mixers required to set up a tire production facility, five mobile repair workshops and several thousand tractor tires in exchange for various minerals and ores. By the end of the year, it concluded trade agreements with several West European countries.

The Export–Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank) approved its first loan in late August 1949, when the Soviet blockade took full effect. It reflected the decision to &quot;keep Tito afloat&quot; made in February. The United States switched to full support by September. Soon, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank approved loans as well, albeit requiring Yugoslavia to use them to repay pre-war debts to Britain, France, Italy and Belgium. The United States pressured Belgium to accept payment in kind instead of cash.

By the end of the year, stocks of grain, fertilisers, and agricultural machinery were running very low. At the same time, export income declined by 36% requiring the extension of rationing. Consequently, a $20 million Ex-Im Bank loan was used to buy food in October 1950, and the United States sent nearly twice the amount of food as aid in November. In late December, President Harry S. Truman signed the 1950 Yugoslav Emergency Assistance Act granting $50 million worth of food. This aid helped Yugoslavia overcome poor harvests of 1948, 1949 and 1950, but there would be almost no economic growth before 1952.

In 1950, Yugoslav authorities sought to combat unsustainable labour practices and improve production efficiency through the introduction of compulsory employment contracts and the reduction of labour quotas while maintaining production goals, and requiring factories to balance goods, available cash, and labour through workers&#x27; councils. The system would later become known as &quot;self-management&quot;. The push to increased efficiency led to lay-offs of workers deemed less productive—including women, the elderly and even maintenance crews, which did not actually produce anything—resulting in a sharp rise in unemployment.

==Decentralisation and constitutional reform==
Even though Soviet and Cominform propaganda drew attention to inequalities in the economic development of various parts of Yugoslavia alleging restoration of capitalism, and national oppression of the underdeveloped nations, the clash between strict centralisation and decentralisation appeared as a conflict between the political principle and economic priorities. There was a proposal led by Ranković in 1949 to introduce oblasts as an intermediate-level administrative bodies designed to reduce power of federal republics, but it was dismissed by the KPJ central committee following Slovene objections. In 1952, Deputy Prime Minister Edvard Kardelj drafted constitutional amendments to reflect the reality of the economic reforms of 1950–51 leading to a debate which would extend for more than a year. The 1953 Yugoslav constitutional amendments established an additional legislative chamber composed of representatives of socially-owned economic operators who debated and voted on all economic matters—including the budget. Furthermore, it sought to reflect the economic power of each constituent republic, giving a majority to Slovenia and Croatia if strictly applied, while ensuring equal representation of each federal unit in the assembly to counterbalance this.

Ultimately, the KPJ accepted decentralisation and rebranded itself as the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (&quot;Savez komunista Jugoslavije&quot;, SKJ) at its sixth congress held in Zagreb in 1952 to reflect the prevailing spirit. The constitutional amendments, adopted on 13 January 1953, were only the second step in a series of five constitutional reforms reflecting the social development of Communist-ruled Yugoslavia, but the principles introduced in 1953 were retained all the way to socialist Yugoslavia&#x27;s final constitution adopted in 1974.

==Foreign relations and defence cooperation==
===Perception of Soviet threat and military aid===

Even though the Yugoslavs initially avoided asking for military aid, believing it would be a pretext for a Soviet invasion, it is unclear whether the USSR planned any military intervention in response to the Tito–Stalin split. Hungarian Major General Béla Király, who defected to the United States in 1956, claimed that there were such plans, but research carried out in the 2000s demonstrated his claims were false. Regardless of any Soviet plans, Yugoslavs believed an invasion was likely and planned accordingly. It would appear from a message from Stalin to Czechoslovak president Klement Gottwald in 1948 that his aim was the isolation and decline of Yugoslavia.

Following a shift of United States policy to &quot;all-out support&quot; for Yugoslavia, on 17 November 1949, the National Security Council pledged to help Yugoslavia defend against invasions. By 1951, Yugoslav authorities became convinced that a Soviet attack was inevitable and Yugoslavia joined the Mutual Defense Assistance Program (MDAP). Shortly before Yugoslavia joined the MDAP, the Yugoslav military held an exercise near Banja Luka in 1951 which hosted US observers, including the Chief of Staff of the United States Army General J. Lawton Collins. In November, the United States provided aid under the MDAP and successfully persuaded the British and French to sell arms to Yugoslavia. The United States provided a large quantity of military hardware; the bulk of the equipment was given to the Army. The Yugoslav Air Force was particularly low on equipment in 1951, but within two years it received 25 Lockheed T-33As, and 167 Republic F-84 Thunderjets. In view of the defence cooperation, the United States Forces in Austria proposed a plan for joint American-Yugoslav defence against Soviet advances from Hungary to Austria through Slovenia, but such plans were never approved. By the mid-1950s, the military aid provided by the United States amounted to a half a billion dollars.

===Alliance with Greece and Turkey===

In 1952, as Greece and Turkey joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the US ambassador approached the Yugoslav ambassador to Turkey in Ankara and suggested strengthening military ties between Yugoslavia with Greece and Turkey. The idea was discussed through 1952 at various levels, with all three countries expressing interest in cooperation, although Yugoslavia employed the most cautious approach to an alliance.

In February 1953, Yugoslav, Greek and Turkish foreign ministers signed the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in Ankara, later also known as the Ankara Agreement, formalising an agreement to cooperate in defence matters. A military alliance agreement building on the Ankara Agreement was signed by the three in Bled on in August 1954, but it did not attach Yugoslavia to NATO. Instead, it allowed Yugoslavia to retain an independent policy. Tito signed this pact to bolster the defense of Yugoslavia against a potential Soviet military invasion. It also made the option of Yugoslavia&#x27;s NATO membership more plausible at its time. Under this pact, any potential Soviet invasion of Yugoslavia could also lead to NATO intervention to help defend Yugoslavia due to the NATO memberships of Greece and Turkey. However, the foreign policy disagreements between the three countries in the pact eventually crippled the alliance itself, thus ending the possibility of Yugoslavia&#x27;s NATO membership.

==Rapprochement with the USSR==

Stalin&#x27;s death in March 1953 resulted in a reduction of Soviet pressure against Yugoslavia. In turn, within months, Tito moved to halt further SKJ reforms advocated most vocally at that point by Milovan Đilas. His expulsion from the SKJ in early 1954 was seen as a favourable development by the new Soviet leadership. As a sign of normalisation of mutual relations, the USSR and Yugoslavia exchanged ambassadors and re-established economic relations by the end of 1953.

On 1 July 1954, as signing of the Bled agreement was imminent, a Soviet ambassador delivered Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s message to Tito indicating an urgent desire to restore relations between the USSR and Yugoslavia. Khruschev and Nikolai Bulganin visited Yugoslavia where they expressed regret over the disruption of the Soviet-Yugoslav relations and promised to rebuild them on new foundations. They signed the Belgrade Declaration recognising Yugoslav socialism as a legitimate variant of the political system, and the Cominform was dissolved in 1956. The United States saw the visit as a setback to their defence cooperation with Yugoslavia, but noted it was the Soviets who backed down and appeared to have accepted Tito&#x27;s terms of cooperation. In that light, they continued to view Yugoslavia as a Cold War asset of value to US policy. Still, US aid was reduced as Yugoslav cooperation with the Eastern Bloc increased.

In light of the new situation on the ground, the United States Congress sought to eliminate aid to Yugoslavia altogether to cut costs, but President Dwight Eisenhower opposed the idea fearing Yugoslavia might be unable or unwilling to maintain independence and forced to turn completely to the USSR. US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles met with Tito at the Brijuni Islands in November 1955 and was able to confirm to Eisenhower that Yugoslavia would keep its distance from the Eastern Bloc. Yugoslavia&#x27;s independence was further supported through aid, thus denying the USSR a strategic position in Southeast Europe and preventing the consolidation of the Eastern Bloc. This led Eisenhower to declare Yugoslavia &quot;one of our greatest victories of the Cold War&quot;.

==In art and popular culture==

In the immediate aftermath of the Tito–Stalin split, Yugoslav artists were encouraged to cover topics thought more fitting to the glorification of the ideology touted by the KPJ. In response, themes such as various aspects of then recent wartime struggle and contemporary construction of important infrastructure became popular among artists. The encouragement took the form of preferential treatment in the selection of works for various state-sponsored exhibitions. The policy was abandoned in the early 1950s in favour of Modernism and proclaimed artistic freedom. The break with the USSR also led to abandoning the monumentalist architecture style in favour of designs found in the West. The overall design of the new KPJ central committee building was changed to give the structure the appearance of an American skyscraper in an effort to contrast it from the Stalinist architecture. The same approach was applied to the Assembly of Slovenia and the Zagreb Assembly buildings. The split with the Eastern Bloc opened the country to Western popular culture and the revival of Yugoslav comics. There were also two early examples of treatment of the break with the USSR and the Cominform in Yugoslav cinema. Both are satirical works filmed in 1951. One is &quot;Tajna dvorca I. B.&quot; (The Secret of the I.B. Castle), a ballet pantomime written by Fadil Hadžić and directed by Milan Katić, while the other is Walter and Norbert Neugebauer&#x27;s cartoon &quot;Veliki miting&quot; (The Big Meeting).

The period of the purges following the Tito–Stalin split was more extensively covered by Yugoslav writers, playwrights, and filmmakers since 1968 when Dragoslav Mihailović wrote his novel &quot;Kad su cvetale tikve&quot; (When the Pumpkins Blossomed) and especially in the 1980s. Particularly notable literary works were written by Puriša Đorđević, Ferdo Godina, Branko Hofman, Antonije Isaković, Dušan Jovanović, Dragan Kalajdžić, Žarko Komanin, Krsto Papić, Slobodan Selenić, Abdulah Sidran, Aleksandar Tišma, and Pavle Ugrinov contributing to what literary and social commentator Predrag Matvejević named the &quot;Goli Otok literature&quot; after the prison. In Yugoslavia, the period of purges following the 1948 Yugoslav–Soviet rift became referred to as the Informbiro period.

The Informbiro period was also revisited by Yugoslav plays and films especially in the 1980s. The most significant play on the topic was &quot;The Karamazovs&quot; by Dušan Jovanović which premiered in 1980. The most significant Yugoslav films on the topic are 1985 feature &quot;When Father Was Away on Business&quot; with its screenplay written by Sidran, and directed by Emir Kusturica; and &quot;Happy New Year &#x27;49&quot;, released a year later, written by Gordan Mihić and directed by Stole Popov. Other notable films dealing with the period are &quot;Evening Bells&quot; (1986) based on a novel by Mirko Kovač and directed by Lordan Zafranović, &quot;Dancing in Water&quot; (1986) written and directed by Jovan Aćin, and &quot;Balkan Spy&quot; (1984) co-directed by cinematographer Božidar Nikolić and playwright Dušan Kovačević.

<doc id="444919" wikidata="Q3206634" url="?curid=444919" title="The Redhead from Wyoming">
<text>The Redhead from Wyoming is a 1953 American Western film produced by Leonard Goldstein and directed by Lee Sholem. It stars Maureen O&#x27;Hara as a saloon proprietress who becomes embroiled in a range war and Alex Nicol as the sheriff who tries to prevent it. The supporting cast includes William Bishop as a politician who provokes the war and Alexander Scourby as a prominent cattle rancher.

==Plot==
The film begins with scenes of life in Wyoming Territory, where new settlers join the cattle business by finding stray, unbranded cattle, called &quot;mavericks&quot;, on public land. The narrator explains that established ranchers use the &quot;Maverick Act&quot; against the settlers, while &quot;sharp-witted men&quot; take advantage of the resulting conflict. After this introduction, Jim Averell (Bishop) is shown exhorting settlers to elect him governor to defend them against cattle barons such as Reece Duncan (Scourby). When Averell&#x27;s speech is over, the famous stage performer Kate Maxwell (O&#x27;Hara) arrives with a group of showgirls. Averell has arranged for Kate to operate both a cattle-buying business and a saloon. Duncan warns Kate that he will kill anyone caught stealing cattle on his land, and Sheriff Stan Blaine (Nicol) warns her of an impending war over the cattle business.

The tension between Duncan and the settlers rises as the settlers search for mavericks on Duncan&#x27;s land and outlaws hired by Averell steal Duncan&#x27;s cattle. Averell designed the &quot;K-M&quot; brand for Kate&#x27;s cattle business in such a way that her branding iron completely covers Duncan&#x27;s &quot;bar double check&quot; brand when applied directly over it. When Averell explains this trick to Kate, he makes it clear to her that she will be hanged as a rustler if she informs the authorities, and Duncan refuses her offer to support him against Averell.

Meanwhile, unknown gunfighters assemble in the nearby hills, and one of them shoots a settler. After Duncan attempts to stop a cattle roundup organized by Averell and the settlers, one of his men is killed, with Kate&#x27;s branding iron left near the body. To further increase the tension, Averell offers Duncan his support against the settlers immediately after inciting their anger against Duncan. Averell&#x27;s plan is to ignite a cattle war and promote his own political career by providing leadership once the war has begun.

However, Blaine discovers Averell&#x27;s plan. After Blaine and Kate have explained it to their men, they stage a fake war, and Blaine forces Averell to signal his men. When the outlaws ride into town, they begin a gunfight against both Duncan&#x27;s men and the settlers. After Averell shoots Blaine, Kate catches him stealing money from the saloon, and when he tries to shoot her, she and Blaine kill him. After the fight, Blaine prepares to leave town, but Kate persuades him to stay with her. The film ends as they ride away to inspect some farmland for a new home.

==Production==
The film was called &quot;Cattle Kate&quot; based on an original story by Polly Bishop. (In December 1949 Hal Wallis announced he wanted to make a biopic of the Wyoming pioneer Ellen Watson called &quot;Cattle Kate&quot; starring Barbara Stanwyck but this appears to have become &quot;The Furies&quot;.)

Maureen O&#x27;Hara signed in April 1952. Hugh O&#x27;Brien was to play the lead but he went into &quot;The Great Companions&quot; instead. Alex Nicol was cast in the male lead. Filming started 10 May 1952. Many town scenes were filmed in the Gold Rush town of Columbia, Tuolumne County, California, while many outdoors scenes were filmed in the general area. Maureen O&#x27;Hara narrowly escaped injury when a gun exploded in the hands of an extra. The title was changed to &quot;Redhead from Wyoming&quot; in June 1952. Star Maureen O&#x27;Hara was under contract to Universal Pictures at the time.

<doc id="444923" wikidata="Q587812" url="?curid=444923" title="El Chapulín Colorado">
<text>El Chapulín Colorado (English: &quot;The Red Grasshopper&quot;) is a Mexican television comedy series that aired from 1973 to 1979 and parodied superhero shows. It was created by Roberto Gómez Bolaños (Chespirito), who also played the main character. It was first aired by Televisa in 1973 in Mexico, and then was aired across Latin America and Spain until 1981, alongside &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot;, which shared the same cast of actors. Both shows have endured in re-runs and have won back some of their popularity in several countries such as Brazil, Colombia or Peru. Although the series has a regular cast, all actors but Gómez Bolaños play different characters each episode, and it is therefore described as an anthology series.

==Overview==

&quot;Chapulín Colorado&quot; translates literally in English as &quot;The Red Grasshopper&quot; or &quot;The Cherry Cricket&quot; (the word &quot;chapulín&quot; is of Nahuatl origin and applies to a Mexican species of grasshopper, while &quot;colorado&quot; means &quot;red&quot;). The show embodies many aspects of Latin and Mexican culture while making a critique on the unrealistic image of superheroes. In each episode, people recognized Chapulín wherever he appeared (one episode took place on the planet Venus), believing him to be a great superhero. Recognition caused him to boast, only to stumble and fall right away, proving himself to be puny and timid, and disappointing his fans. Despite this, Chapulín tried his best to help, and all his adventures ended well (though sometimes by sheer good luck or outside help).

Parodying Superman&#x27;s &quot;Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive&quot; introduction, Chapulín was introduced as follows in the show&#x27;s opening, reinforcing the idea of a barely powered hero:

:&quot;Más ágil que una tortuga, más fuerte que un ratón, más noble que una lechuga, su escudo es un corazón... ¡Es el Chapulín Colorado!&quot;
: (More agile than a turtle, stronger than a mouse, nobler than lettuce, his shield is a heart... He&#x27;s the Cherry Cricket!)
:&quot;Más veloz que una montaña, Más ágil que un refrigerador, Más astuto que un aguacate, ¿y quién es?, Es……, ¿Una paleta helada, ¿Un clavel?, ¿Un cuaderno cuadriculado?, ¡No!, Es…., ¡El Chapulín Colorado!
: (Faster than a mountain, More agile than a refrigerator, smarter than an avocado and who is he?, He’s……, A popsicle?, A carnation?, A squared notebook?, No!, He’s…., The Cherry Cricket!

==Recurrent characters besides the protagonist==

=== Heroes ===
* Súper Sam (Super Sam): (1973–1978; 1981) Played by Ramón Valdés.
He is a superhero that hails from somewhere in the U.S. (most probably its southernmost regions) whose appearance is very similar to that of Uncle Sam (including the famous top hat with the colors of the U.S.), but his suit is similar to Superman&#x27;s. Half of the things Súper Sam says are in English, considering his inadequate skills with Spanish (he is known for having to carry an English-Spanish dictionary in his pocket whenever he needs to save someone in Mexico). Súper Sam&#x27;s primary weapon is a bag full of dollars that he says were &quot;few, but very powerful&quot;; it is usually used to beat on the head of the wrongdoers or Chapulín, as both don&#x27;t get along very well. Every time he uses his weapon, the ringing of a cash register chimes in the show&#x27;s audio. His catchphrase is &quot;Time is Money, oh yeah!&quot; and when present, most people say that &quot;they don&#x27;t want imported superheroes&quot;, much to Súper Sam&#x27;s annoyance. According to Florinda Meza&#x27;s character, Super Sam is &quot;just like Chapulín, but with a bank account.&quot;

=== Villains ===

==== The Mob ====
* Tripaseca (Dry-Gut): (1975–1979) Played by Ramón Valdés. He is one of the most frequently recurring villains on the show. He is a very dangerous gangster who is part of a mafia gang composed of Cuajináis, Chory, Botija and Minina. He is considered the archenemy of Chapulín, always scheming along with the rest of his gang to kill the hero to commit all the robberies he wants. In an episode in which he pretends to be dead to fool the local police force, Chapulín states that he had known Tripaseca since the two of them were children.
* Cuajináis (Almost-Nothing): (1973–1978) Played by Carlos Villagrán. He is a deadly gangster characterized by the huge scar on his right cheek. Although he is an ally of Tripaseca, sometimes he attempts to score certain crimes on his own.
* Chory (the word has double meaning; it is the Spanish abbreviation of the word &quot;chorizo&quot;, or Spanish sausage, and is also based on the English word &quot;shorty&quot;, a sarcastic reference on Rubén Aguirre&#x27;s height of 1.96m or 6&#x27;5&quot;): (1973–1992) Played by Rubén Aguirre. He is a vicious mobster characterized by his high stature and coldness. El Shory often gives trouble to Chapulín in combat because of his superior strength and endurance. In some chapters, this character is nicknamed &quot;El Nene (The Kid)&quot;.
* Minina (Pussycat): (1975-1979) Played by Florinda Meza. A woman who accompanies the mafia in their schemes and is characterized by constant smoking and her low intellectual capacity.
* Pocas Trancas (Few-Lock): Played by Rubén Aguirre. He is a madman who escaped from the asylum. People believe that Pocas Trancas was deaf but a detective clarified that he couldn&#x27;t speak because he didn&#x27;t wash his tongue and that he couldn&#x27;t listen because he didn&#x27;t wash his ears. What he lacked in intelligence he made up for in raw strength, according to the same detective. Súper Sam and Chapulín usually have to team up to fight him.

==== The Gunmen ====
* Rascabuches (Tear-Maw): (1973-1979; 1981) Played by Ramón Valdés. He is a fiery gunslinger whose mere presence makes all the inhabitants of any village flee in terror. He faced Chapulín many times and was always defeated by him (although once he was trapped by a giant mousetrap that had a bag of money as bait). The Rascabuches has a young daughter named Rosa.
* Matonsísimo Kid (Thesuperkiller Kid): (1975-1981) Played by Carlos Villagrán or Rubén Aguirre. A dangerous gunman who constantly plagues small towns of the old American West, he is an ally of Rascabuches and Rosa la Rumorosa. Although claimed to be the fastest gunman of the Old West, Chapulín always managed to overcome him.
* Rosa la Rumorosa (Rose the Rumor Girl): (1973-1981) Played by Florinda Meza. She is the only daughter of Rascabuches, one of the most feared gunmen of the Old West. Despite being an accomplice to her father, she sometimes laments the fact that no one proposes marriage to her because of the notoriety of her father.

==== The Pirates ====
* Alma Negra (Black Soul): (1975-1978; 1981) Played by Ramón Valdés. He is the captain of the pirates, and as he said, the chief of all the pirates of the seven seas. Captain Alma Negra is evil but sometimes clumsy as well (once being hurt with his own dagger while trying to intimidate el Chapulín). He is characterized by his malevolent laughter and his tendency to endanger the life of his own crew and of Chapulín or any girl that doesn&#x27;t want to marry him. According to himself, he killed the Dead Sea and therefore there are no longer seven seas, only six. At some point, he died but his ghost continued to curse the seas.
* Matalote (Slaughter): (1975-1978) Played by Rubén Aguirre. He is Alma Negra&#x27;s right-hand man, the tallest of the pirates, and surely the most cruel after Alma Negra. El Matalote is known for being quite strong and ruthless.
* Sabandija (Gecko/Louse): (1975-1978) Played by Carlos Villagrán. He is a clumsy pirate that has a left wooden leg and a right glass eye, the former lost in one of the many battles fought under Alma Negra&#x27;s command and the latter lost after peeking through a keyhole. He and Panza Loca are the only ones in the crew who rebel against the master pirate alongside Chapulín.
* Panza Loca (Crazy Belly): Played by Édgar Vivar. He is the fattest of the pirates, has a little intimidating voice and apparently was not a very good pirate. He is as cowardly as Sabandija and often suffers through life-threatening situations because of the whims of Captain Alma Negra.

==Production==
===Concept===
According to Chespirito, the difference between Chapulín and standard heroes:
===Pioneer in visual effects===
With &quot;Chapulín&quot;, Chespirito and along his production team made extensive use of the chroma key device and bluescreen to produce visual effects which made the adventures of this superhero more interesting. Though somewhat unrefined by modern standards, the show achieved surprising effects like floating in the air or flying, performing impossible acrobatics, fighting against Martians, strange creatures, witches and various monsters, and, most often, to get the physical reduction effect thanks to his famous &quot;pastillas de chiquitolina&quot;, which Chapulín frequently used to pass under doors, reach dangerous areas without attracting attention, or solve problems.

This innovation, which was already known in Mexican television but not widely used, gave &quot;Chapulín&quot; the distinction of being virtually the only adventure-comedy broadcast in Mexico.

=== Music ===

Similarly to &quot;El Chavo&quot;, the production music of &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; typically derives from feature films or other media. The opening intro, for instance, combines excerpts of &quot;The Red Sea&quot; from The Ten Commandments (1956), as well as &quot;Finale&quot; from Tom Sawyer (1973). In the end credits for most episodes between 1975 and 1979, Baroque Hoedown by Jean Jacques Perrey (who also composed The Elephant Never Forgets used in &quot;El Chavo&quot;) can be heard. However, the two versions of the song used in the credits actually originate from the 1973 and 1977 soundtrack releases of Disney&#x27;s Main Street Electrical Parade, where Baroque Hoedown was rearranged twice for exclusive use on the famous Disney parade.

==Related media==
===Animated series===

==== &quot;El Chapulin Colorado&quot; ====

An animated series based on the show premiered in April 2015, made by Ánima Estudios.

==== &quot;Los Colorado&quot; ====
In May 2024, it was reported that a new animated series based on the show, titled &quot;Los Colorado&quot;, is in development. The series will center on El Chapulin as he struggles with both his crimefighting activities and his duties as husband and father. The series will be developed by Rodolfo and Gabriel Riva Palacio, while Roberto Gómez Fernández will executive-produce. The series will be produced by Grupo Chespirito and TH3 Media Group alongside Huevocartoon.

===Animated film===
In May 2017, Roberto Gómez Fernández revealed that an animated film adaptation of El Chapulin Colorado is in development. On 6 October 2019, it was reported that Gomez Fernandez had begun working on the script. Later that month, Gómez Fernández revealed that production on the film has begun. He also said that the film will take place in a shared universe featuring characters created by Chespirito.

===Live-action film===
In December 2020, Gómez Fernández revealed that a live-action film based on the character is being produced in parallel to the animated film. The idea for a live-action feature film was conceived during development on the animated film. Although no actor has been cast on the title role, Gómez Fernández acknowledged that the studio has certain actors in consideration.

===Comics===
El Chapulín Colorado comics were sold in Mexico during the program&#x27;s broadcasting years from 1974 until 1982. These comics have also been seen occasionally appearing in some episodes of &quot;El Chavo&quot; (where El Chapulín Colorado is considered a fictional character on the show) usually being read by the characters. The comics were sold weekly and sold an estimated total of more than 400 issues.

In the early 1990s with the high popularity of the products of the Chespirito characters in Brazil, two series of children&#x27;s comics were made in partnership with the Editora Globo, with a new art style different from Mexican comics. These comics were &quot;Chaves &amp; Chapolim&quot; (1990–1993) and &quot;Chapolim &amp; Chaves&quot; (1991–1992), both comics features stories both with El Chavo and El Chapulín Colorado.

In May 2017, along with the announcement of a film, Gómez Fernández revealed that a comic series based on the character is in development.

===Video games===
&quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; is also extremely popular in Brazil. The company, Tec Toy, responsible for distributing the Sega consoles in Brazil, published a video game for the Sega Master System called &quot;Chapolim x Drácula: Um duelo assustador&quot; (&quot;Chapulín vs. Dracula: A Frightening Duel&quot;). It was a localization of another existing SMS title, &quot;Ghost House&quot;, with the hero&#x27;s graphics changed to Chapulín&#x27;s.

To celebrate the 91st anniversary of Chespirito&#x27;s birth date and the 50th anniversary of the character&#x27;s creation, on 21 February 2020, the videogame &quot;FIFA 20&quot; added a free DLC based on El Chapulín Colorado. The DLC specifically added a new yellow and red uniform based on the character for the &quot;Ultimate Team&quot; game mode, which includes the heart shield on the uniform&#x27;s shirt.

On October 29, 2021, it was announced that El Chapulín Colorado would become a playable character in the popular video game &quot;Fortnite&quot;, becoming available to the public as of November 2, 2021. Additionally, there are two sets of 5 outfits made with common &quot;Fortnite&quot; characters wearing the Chapulín Colorado outfit.

On July 9, 2022, a skin based on El Chapulín Colorado was added to Epic Games&#x27; &quot;Fall Guys&quot;, which was available until July 13. Later that year on October 11, a Chapulín Colorado-themed vehicle and the character&#x27;s imagery were added to sister game &quot;Rocket League&quot;, which were available until October 17.

==Reception==
===Popularity===

&quot;Chapulín&quot; has enjoyed popularity all over Latin America, the United States, Spain, Portugal and other countries, albeit somewhat less than its sister production of &quot;El Chavo&quot;. Like &quot;El Chavo&quot;, it is still shown in reruns in various countries. The cast of &quot;Chapulín&quot; was the same as that of &quot;El Chavo&quot;, although only actors Florinda Meza, Carlos Villagrán and Ramón Valdés were usually in every episode; however, the characters usually were different. Some of the regular (albeit infrequent) characters who appeared, usually Chapulín foes, were El Tripaseca (Valdés) and El Cuajinais&#x27; (Villagrán), a pair of Mafiosi who liked to make heists, as well as concurrent superhero Super Sam (played by Valdés too; see below). One-off villains, mostly those played by Valdés, like Wild West outlaw El Rascabuche, are also fondly remembered by fans.

Shorter Chapulín adventures were preceded by a skit, usually featuring Chespirito&#x27;s other characters, like Dr. Chapatín, a tactless, impatient old physician, or El Chómpiras, an incompetent thief in the skit called Los Caquitos, along with El Peterete, played by Ramón Valdés. Chompiras and his new partner in crime, El Botija, played by Edgar Vivar, came to dominate the later years of &quot;Chespirito&quot;, an hour-long showcase featuring all the characters of the show.

The physical diversity of &quot;Chespirito&quot; actors permitted the richness of characters in the adventures, each week a new one. Chapulín was a hero of undetermined geographic and temporal location: his adventures could unfold in the American Old West, in ancient Japan, in haunted houses, in London, in the Swiss Alps, during the Spanish Inquisition, in pirate ships, in Nazi Germany (an episode in which Chespirito played a double role as Chapulín and as Adolf Hitler himself, in the style of Charles Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;) or outer space, and his enemies range from the mafians, pirates, ghosts, Yeti to Egyptian mummies, including his interaction, in some occasions, with literary characters such as, Romeo and Juliet (&quot;Juleo y Rumieta&quot;, or literally &quot;Juleo and Rumiet&quot;).

===Legacy===
&quot;The Simpsons&quot; creator Matt Groening has said that he created the Bumblebee Man character after watching &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; in a motel on the United States–Mexico border.

The character made a cameo on &quot;Action Comics&quot; No. 820 (December 2004), published by DC Comics.

The Marvel Comics superheroine Red Locust, a member of the newest incarnation of the Champions, was created as an homage to El Chapulín Colorado.

On the manga and anime series &quot;One Punch Man&quot;, a superhero called &quot;Smile Man&quot; physically resembles El Chapulín Colorado, while also resembling classic Japanese character Anpanman. The character wears almost the same yellow and red suit as El Chapulín, using a big red and yellow hammer as well. However, there are a few noticeable differences, such as the lack of antennae on the head, a big smile face instead of a heart shield on his chest (just like Anpanman) and the use of a mask. While it is yet to be confirmed if the character is a parody or a tribute of El Chapulín Colorado, several news websites (especially from Latin America) noticed the physical similarities. The official Spanish Twitter account of the series even acknowledged the similarities, using one of El Chapulín&#x27;s quotes along a screenshot showing Smile Man.

El Chapulín Colorado appears in one of the episodes of season 5 of &quot;Monica Toy&quot; (animated spin-off of &quot;Monica and Friends&quot;).

The DC film &quot;Blue Beetle&quot; (2023) features an homage to El Chapulín Colorado. Director Angel Manuel Soto and writer Gareth Dunnet-Alcocer incorporated the homage due to having watched the original series while growing up.

=== Fine art ===
El Chapulín Colorado was one of the subjects incorporated by photographer Dulce Pinzon in her photographic series titled &quot;The Real Stories of the Superheroes&quot;. In this series, Pinzon dressed mostly Mexican immigrants as various superheroes, but performing their normal, daily work in construction, childcare, waitressing, window cleaning, etc., and then photographed them. The series included super heroes such as Batman, Superman, Spider-Man, as well as El Chapulín Colorado. This photographic series was declared as part of the National Legacy of Mexico in 2020.

<text>Mia Kirshner (born January 25, 1975) is a Canadian actress, writer, and social activist. She is known for television roles as Mandy in &quot;24&quot; (2001–2005), as Jenny Schecter in &quot;The L Word&quot; (2004–2009), as Amanda Grayson in &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; (2017–2019) and &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; (2023), and as Isobel Flemming in &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; (2010–2011). Her film credits include &quot;Love and Human Remains&quot; (1993), &quot;Exotica&quot; (1994), &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot; (1996), &quot;Mad City&quot; (1997), &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; (2001), and &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; (2006).

== Early life ==
Kirshner was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the daughter of Etti (Henrietta), a teacher, and Sheldon Kirshner, a journalist who wrote for &quot;The Canadian Jewish News&quot;. Kirshner is a granddaughter of Holocaust survivors; her father was born in the displaced persons camp at Bad Reichenhall in Germany in 1946; and met Kirshner&#x27;s mother, a Bulgarian Jewish refugee (of Sephardi Jewish descent), after they immigrated to Israel. Kirshner&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Polish Jews (of Ashkenazi Jewish descent). Kirshner had a middle class upbringing, and attended Forest Hill Collegiate Institute but later graduated from Jarvis Collegiate Institute. Kirshner studied Russian literature and the 20th-century movie industry at McGill University in Montreal. Her younger sister, Lauren Kirshner, a writer, was involved in the I Live Here project.

== Career ==

Kirshner started her career in 1989 in &quot;Loving the Alien&quot;, a second-season episode of &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, as both Jo, a young resistance fighter who is captured and duplicated by the enemy aliens, and her doppelgänger. Kirshner made her film debut in 1993 at the age of 18 in Denys Arcand&#x27;s &quot;Love and Human Remains&quot;. She convinced her father to sign a &quot;nudity waiver&quot; to play a dominatrix. The following year, she starred as a conflicted exotic dancer in Atom Egoyan&#x27;s &quot;Exotica&quot;. In 1996, she appeared in &quot;The Crow: City of Angels&quot;. She also played Kitty Scherbatsky in the 1997 version of &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;.

Kirshner also appeared in the first three episodes of &quot;24&quot; as the assassin Mandy in 2001. She would later reprise the role for the second season&#x27;s finale and in the latter half of the show&#x27;s fourth season. Also in 2001, Kirshner played Catherine Wyler, &quot;The Cruelest Girl in School&quot;, in &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot;. The character is primarily a spoof of Kathryn Merteuil (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar) in &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;, and was partially based on Mackenzie Siler (played by Anna Paquin) from &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot;. In Marilyn Manson&#x27;s music video for &quot;Tainted Love&quot;, which was featured on the movie&#x27;s soundtrack, she made a cameo appearance as her character Catherine Wyler.

In 2004, Kirshner was cast as writer Jenny Schecter, a main character in the drama series &quot;The L Word.&quot; She remained with the show through 2009, for all six seasons.

In 2006, she starred in Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot; in which she plays the young aspiring actress Elizabeth Short, whose mutilation and murder in 1947 remains unsolved. While the film itself was critically panned, many reviews singled out her performance for acclaim. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com, in a largely negative review, notes that the eponymous character was &quot;played wonderfully by Mia Kirshner...&quot; Mick LaSalle wrote that Kirshner &quot;makes a real impression of the Dahlia as a sad, lonely dreamer, a pathetic figure.&quot; J. R. Jones described her performance as &quot;haunting&quot; and that the film&#x27;s fictional screen tests &quot;deliver the emotional darkness so lacking in the rest of the movie.&quot; In 2010, Kirshner co-starred in the film &quot;30 Days of Night: Dark Days&quot; which began filming in the fall of 2009. In 2010, she was cast as Isobel Flemming, a guest role on &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;.

In 2011, she voiced the title character in &quot;Bear 71&quot;, a National Film Board of Canada web documentary that premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.

On April 20, 2012, it was announced that Kirshner would join the new Syfy series &quot;Defiance&quot;.

On October 9, 2013, it was mentioned on the Showcase blog that Kirshner would be one of several guest stars in season four of the television series &quot;Lost Girl&quot;.

From 2017 to 2019, she played the recurring role of Amanda Grayson, mother of Spock and stepmother of series protagonist Michael Burnham on &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; (a role originated by Jane Wyatt on the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;). She later reprised the role in an episode of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;.

On September 5, 2019, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; news outlet ET Online reported that Kirshner would play a character in Lifetime&#x27;s film &quot;The College Admissions Scandal&quot; with co-star Penelope Ann Miller in roles inspired by real-life actresses Lori Loughlin&#x27;s and Felicity Huffman&#x27;s involvement in a massive college admissions bribery scam. Describing her role, Kirshner was quoted saying &quot;This story is about privilege and corruption and it&#x27;s about people who don&#x27;t follow the rules because they think they&#x27;re above rules... My character [based on Loughlin but named &quot;Bethany&quot; in the film] is so corrupt, greedy, narcissistic, self-centered, and the dialogue is hilarious, so I&#x27;m glad that they&#x27;re able to capture humor about this as well.&quot;

In September 2020, it was announced that Kirshner would co-star with Ben Savage in a Hallmark Channel holiday film entitled &quot;Love, Lights, Hanukkah!&quot;, which premiered on December 12, 2020. Kirshner plays a restaurant owner named Christina, who learns of her Jewish ancestry through a DNA test.

== Philanthropy ==
In October 2008, after seven years in production, Kirshner published the book &quot;I Live Here&quot;, which she co-produced with ex-Adbusters staffers Paul Shoebridge and Michael Simons, as well as writer James MacKinnon. In the book, four different groups of women and children refugees from places such as Chechnya, Juárez, Burma and Malawi tell their life stories. The book features original material from well-known comic and graphic artists including Joe Sacco and Phoebe Gloeckner. It was published in the U.S. by Random House/Pantheon. It was supported logistically by Amnesty International, which will receive proceeds from the book. After the release of the book, the Center for International Studies at MIT invited Kirshner to run a 4-week course on &quot;I Live Here&quot; in January 2009.

== In popular culture ==
Kirshner was ranked #43 on the &quot;Maxim&quot; Hot 100 Women of 2002. She and Beverly Polcyn were nominated for Best Kiss at the 2002 MTV Movie Awards for &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot;. In 2011 it was announced that Kirshner would be the face of Monica Rich Kosann&#x27;s jewelry collection.

== Personal life ==
Between 2014 and 2015, Kirshner was in a relationship with actor and playwright Sam Shepard.

<text>The Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) project is a collaboration of the United States Air Force, NASA, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Lincoln Laboratory for the systematic detection and tracking of near-Earth objects. LINEAR was responsible for the majority of asteroid discoveries from 1998 until it was overtaken by the Catalina Sky Survey in 2005. , LINEAR had detected 231,082 new small Solar System bodies, of which at least 2,423 were near-Earth asteroids and 279 were comets. The instruments used by the LINEAR program are located at Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s Experimental Test Site (ETS) on the White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) near Socorro, New Mexico.

== History ==

In the late 1970s, the &quot;Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s Experimental Test Site&quot; facility (observatory code 704) was built at White Sands Missile Range. The project&#x27;s prototype used low-light video cameras. In 1994 a new proposal was made for automated detection of asteroids, this time using newer digital detector technology. The LINEAR project began operating a near-Earth object discovery facility in 1996 using a aperture telescope designed for the Air Force Space Command&#x27;s Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS). The wide-field Air Force telescopes were designed for optical observation of Earth-orbiting spacecraft. Initial field tests used a 1024 × 1024 pixel charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. While this CCD detector filled only about one fifth of the telescope&#x27;s field of view, four near-earth objects were discovered. A 1960 × 2560 pixel CCD which covered the telescope&#x27;s two-square degree field of view was then installed, and both detectors were used in later tests.

The first LINEAR telescope became fully operational in March 1998. Beginning in October 1999, a second 1.0 m telescope was added to the search effort. In 2002, a telescope equipped with the original CCD was brought on-line to provide follow-up observations for the discoveries made by the two search telescopes. This allowed about 20% more of the sky to be searched each night. Data recorded by the telescopes is sent to a Lincoln Laboratory facility at Hanscom Air Force Base in Lexington, Massachusetts for processing. Detections are then forwarded to the Minor Planet Center.

== Discoveries ==

In addition to discovering more than 140,000 minor planets, LINEAR is also credited with the discovery, or co-discovery, or rediscovery of several periodic comets, including 11P/Tempel–Swift–LINEAR, 158P/Kowal-LINEAR, 160P/LINEAR (LINEAR 43), 165P/LINEAR (LINEAR 10), and 176P/LINEAR (LINEAR 52, 118401 LINEAR: one of only five objects classified both as comets and asteroids). Other objects discovered include , , and 2004 FH. One of LINEAR&#x27;s discoveries passed near the Earth on 21 March, 2021

<text>The 25th Infantry Division (nicknamed &quot;Tropic Lightning&quot;) is a United States Army division based at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii. The division, which was activated on 1 October 1941 in Hawaii, conducts military operations primarily in the Asia-Pacific region. Its present deployment is composed of light infantry and aviation units. Tropic Lightning soldiers regularly train with other U.S. military branches to practice and maintain joint operations capabilities. The climate and terrain of the Pacific region demands Tropic Lightning soldiers be able to operate in physically demanding and harsh environments. In 2014, the division opened the Jungle Operations Training Center—the first such school in the Army since the closing of the old Jungle Warfare School at Fort Sherman, Panama Canal Zone. Joint operations and training with partner states herald a new chapter in the history of Tropic Lightning—America&#x27;s Pacific Division.

The division was originally activated from Hawaii garrison units during World War II, slightly more than two months before the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor began the Pacific War. After spending almost a year training, it fought in the Allied counteroffensive during the Guadalcanal Campaign from December 1942, helping to end organized Japanese resistance on that island by early February 1943. The 25th spent a period garrisoning the island, then moved on to fight in the New Georgia Campaign in July. After the Japanese defeat in the latter, it was sent to New Zealand later that year for rest and training, before moving to New Caledonia for further training. The division returned to combat in the January 1945 invasion of Luzon, reducing Japanese resistance on the island until late June, after which it was pulled out of the line for training. The division then served in the occupation of Japan after the surrender of the latter from September 1945.

When the Korean War began in June 1950, the division was deployed to South Korea, where it fought in the defense of and the breakout from the Pusan Perimeter in mid-1950, with elements advancing as far as the Amnok River in November. After being thrown back by the Chinese Communist intervention in the war, the division eventually took up positions south of Osan. It participated in a series of United Nations counteroffensives in early 1951, then fought in a stalemate close to the 38th parallel from the middle of the year. The division defended Seoul against Chinese Communist attack from May 1953 to the July armistice, returning to Hawaii in late 1954.

After undergoing major reorganizations in 1957 and 1963 to adapt to changing tactics, the division deployed to South Vietnam to fight in the Vietnam War between late 1965 and early 1966. The 25th served in Vietnam until its withdrawal back to Hawaii in 1970–1971, participating in Operation Attleboro, Operation Cedar Falls, Operation Junction City, the Battle of Saigon during the North Vietnamese Tet Offensive, and the Cambodian Incursion. It was reorganized as a light infantry division in 1985, and elements have participated in the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan.

==History==

===Lineage===
Sources:
* Constituted 26 August 1941 in the Army of the United States as Headquarters, 25th Infantry Division, based on a cadre Force from the former Hawaiian Division.
* Activated 1 October 1941 at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii
* Allotted 27 June 1949 to the Regular Army
* Division headquarters reorganized and redesignated 1 April 1960 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 25th Infantry Division
* Reorganized and redesignated 16 November 2005 as Headquarters and Tactical Command Posts, 25th Infantry Division
* Reorganized and redesignated 16 January 2010 as Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 25th Infantry Division

The 25th Division was originally formed in the Army of the United States from the 27th and 35th Infantry Regiments of the Regular Army Hawaiian Division− a pre–World War II &quot;square&quot; division composed of two brigades each with two infantry regiments, and the 298th Infantry Regiment of the Hawaii National Guard. The remaining units of the Hawaiian Division were reorganized in the Regular Army as the 24th Infantry Division. These steps, part of the &quot;triangular&quot; division reorganization, were undertaken to provide more flexibility, with direct divisional control of the three infantry regiments. On 23 July 1942, the 24th Infantry Division&#x27;s 299th Infantry Regiment was inactivated after the transfer of many &quot;Nisei&quot; (second-generation Japanese-American) soldiers to form the 100th Infantry Battalion left its ranks depleted. The Washington National Guard&#x27;s 161st Infantry Regiment, detached from the 41st Infantry Division and on duty in the Hawaiian Department, was at first attached, and then formally assigned as the 25th Infantry Division&#x27;s third regiment on 3 August 1942.

===Pacific War===

After the Japanese air attack on Schofield Barracks on 7 December 1941, the 25th Infantry Division moved to beach positions for the defense of Honolulu and Ewa Point.
Following intensive training, the 25th began moving to Guadalcanal, 25 November 1942, to relieve Marines near Henderson Field. First elements landed near the Tenaru River, 17 December 1942, and entered combat, 10 January 1943, participating in the seizure of Kokumbona and the reduction of the Mount Austen Pocket in some of the bitterest fighting of the Pacific campaign. The threat of large enemy attacks caused a temporary withdrawal, but division elements under XIV Corps control relieved the 147th Infantry and took over the advance on Cape Esperance. The junction of these elements with Americal Division forces near the cape, 5 February 1943, ended organized enemy resistance.

A period of garrison duty followed, ending 21 July: On that date, advance elements debarked on Munda, New Georgia. The 25th Infantry, under the Northern Landing Force, took part in the capture of Vella Lavella, 15 August to 15 September 1943. Meanwhile, other elements landed on New Georgia, took Zieta, marched through jungle mud for 19 days, and captured Bairoko Harbor, winning the island. Elements cleared Arundel Island, 24 September 1943, and Kolombangara island with its important Vila Airport, 6 October. Organized resistance on New Georgia ended, 25 August, and the division moved to New Zealand for rest and training, last elements arriving on 5 December. The 25th was transferred to New Caledonia, 3 February-14 March 1944, for continued training.

The division landed in the San Fabian area of Luzon on 11 January 1945 to enter the struggle for the liberation of the Philippines. It drove across the Luzon Central Plain, meeting the enemy at Binalonan, 17 January. Moving through the rice paddies, the 25th occupied Umingan, Lupao, and San Jose and destroyed a great part of the Japanese armor on Luzon. On 21 February, the division began operations in the Caraballo Mountains in tandem with the 32nd Infantry Division which fought the Battle of Villa Verde Trail. The 25th fought its way along Highway No. 5, taking Digdig, Putlan, and Kapintalan against fierce Japanese counterattacks and captured Balete Pass, 13 May, and opened the gateway to the Cagayan Valley, 27 May, with the capture of Santa Fe. Until 30 June, when the division was relieved, it carried out mopping-up activities. On 1 July, the division moved to Tarlac for training, leaving for Japan, 20 September.

====Casualties====
*Total battle casualties: 5,432

*Killed in action: 1,236
*Wounded in action: 4,190
*Missing in action: 4
*Prisoner of war: 2
The division&#x27;s rapid movements during its campaigns led to the adoption of the nickname &quot;Tropic Lightning&quot;. It remained on occupation duty in Japan for the next five years.

===Korean War===

The Korean War began on 25 June 1950 when the North Korean Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) crossed the 38th Parallel to invade South Korea. Acting under United Nations (UN) orders, the division moved from its base in Japan to Korea between 5–18 July 1950 to join the Eighth United States Army. The division, then under the command of Major General William B. Kean, successfully completed its first mission by blocking the approaches to the port city Pusan. For this action, the division received its first Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. The division participated in the breakout from the Pusan perimeter commencing on 16 September and Eighth Army then began a general offensive northward against crumbling KPA opposition to establish contact with forces of the 7th Infantry Division driving southward from the Inchon beachhead. Major elements of the KPA were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration; the link-up was affected south of Suwon on 26 September. On 23 September the division was assigned to the newly activated US IX Corps. The UN offensive was continued northwards, past Seoul, and across the 38th Parallel into North Korea on 1 October. The momentum of the attack was maintained, and the race to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, ended on 19 October when elements of the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) 1st Infantry Division and US 1st Cavalry Division captured the city. The advance continued, but against unexpectedly stiffening resistance. The Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA) entered the war on the side of North Korea, making their first attacks in late October. The UN forces renewed their offensive on 24 November before being stopped by the PVA Second Phase Offensive starting on 25 November. The division was forced to carry out a systematic withdrawal and ordered to take up defensive positions on the south bank of the Chongchon River on 30 November 1950. Eventually, these lines failed and Eighth Army suffering heavy casualties, ordered a complete withdrawal to the Imjin River, near the 38th Parallel.

After a month and a half of planning and reorganization, a new offensive was launched on 25 January 1951 and succeeded in recapturing Inchon and Kimpo Air Base. This was the first of several successful assaults on the PVA/KPA. The division next participated in Operation Ripper, during which it drove the PVA across the Han River. Success continued with Operations Dauntless and Piledriver in early 1951. These offensives secured part of the Iron Triangle which enhanced the UN&#x27;s bargaining position. With leaders of four nations now at the negotiating tables in the summer of 1951, Division activity slowed to patrol and defensive actions to maintain the line of resistance. This type of action continued into the winter of 1952. In January 1953 the division was transferred from IX Corps to I Corps and assumed the responsibility of guarding the approaches of Seoul on 5 May 1953. 23 days later, when ceasefire negotiations at Panmunjom stalled, a heavy PVA assault hit the Nevada Complex, the division held its ground; the brunt of the attack was absorbed by the attached Turkish Brigade and the 14th Infantry Regiment. By successfully defending Seoul from continued attack from May to July 1953, the division earned its second Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. Again, negotiators moved toward peace. In July, the division again moved to reserve status at Camp Casey where it remained through the signing of the armistice 27 July 1953. Fourteen division soldiers were awarded Medals of Honor during the Korean War, making the division one of the most decorated US Army divisions of that war.

The division&#x27;s 14th Infantry Regiment had three recipients of the Medal of Honor, Donn F. Porter, Ernest E. West and Bryant E. Womack. The 24th Infantry Regiment had two recipients, Cornelius H. Charlton and William Thompson. The 35th Infantry Regiment had three recipients, William R. Jecelin, Billie G. Kanell and Donald R. Moyer. Finally, the 27th Infantry Regiment had five recipients, John W. Collier, Reginald B. Desiderio, Benito Martinez, Lewis L. Millett and Jerome A. Sudut. The divisions patch is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Electric Strawberry&quot;.

The division remained in Korea until 1954 and returned to Hawaii from September through October of that year. After a 12-year absence, the 25th Infantry Division had finally returned home.
On 1 February 1957, the division was reorganized as a Pentomic Division. The division&#x27;s three infantry regiments (the 14th, 27th and 35th) were inactivated, with their elements reorganized into five infantry battle groups (the 1-14 IN, 1-27 IN, 1-35 IN, 2-19 IN and the 2-21 IN).

In August 1963, the division was reorganized as a Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD). Three Brigade Headquarters were activated and Infantry units were reorganized into battalions.

===Vietnam War===
In response to a request from the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), the division sent 100 helicopter door-gunners to South Vietnam in early 1963. By August 1965, further division involvement in the coming Vietnam War included the deployment of Company C, 65th Engineer Battalion, to South Vietnam to assist in the construction of port facilities at Cam Ranh Bay. By mid-1965, 2,200 men of the Tropic Lightning Division were involved in Vietnam. The division was again ordered to contribute combat forces in December of that year. Its resupply regiment, the 467th, was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George S Dotson through the end of the war.

In response to a MACV request, the division deployed the 3rd Brigade, a Reinforced Task Force, with 5,150 infantrymen and 9,000 tons of equipment from Hawaii in 25 days to the Northwest sector of South Vietnam to firmly establish a fortified enclave from which the division could operate. Operation Blue Light was the largest and longest airlift of personnel and cargo into a combat zone in military history before Operation Desert Shield. The brigade deployed its first soldiers from Hickam Air Force Base, Honolulu, to the central highlands at Pleiku. These men arrived in Vietnam 24 December 1965. The 25th Infantry Division had its headquarters at Củ Chi Base Camp, near the Iron Triangle from January 1966 until February 1970. The division was heavily engaged from April 1966 until 1972 throughout the area of operations in Southeast Asia. During this period, Tropic Lightning soldiers fought in some of the toughest battles of the war including Operation Junction City and Operation Pershing.

During the Tet offensives of 1968 and 1969, Tropic Lightning soldiers were instrumental in defending the besieged city of Saigon. From May through June 1970, division soldiers participated in Allied thrusts deep into enemy sanctuaries located in Cambodia. In these Incursion operations, the division units confiscated thousands of tons of supplies and hundreds of weapons. This operation crippled the Cambodian-based efforts against American units. Following its return from Cambodia to South Vietnam, the division resumed its place in the Vietnamization Program. The war was winding down. By late December 1970, elements of the 25th Infantry Division were able to begin redeployment to Schofield Barracks. Second Brigade was the last element of the division to depart Vietnam. It arrived at Fort Lewis, Washington in the early days of May 1971. Some elements in the 2nd Brigade were originally assigned to the 4th Infantry Division when they arrived in Vietnam. During the war in Vietnam, 22 Medals of Honor were awarded to Tropic Lightning soldiers.

===Reorganization and light infantry status===
After its return to Schofield Barracks, the 25th Infantry Division remained the only Army division to have never been stationed in the continental United States. In a time of overall military downsizing, it was reduced to a single brigade numbering 4,000 men. The division was reactivated in March 1972. It was reorganized to include as a &quot;roundout&quot; brigade the 29th Infantry Brigade of the Hawaii Army National Guard which included: the 2nd Battalion, 299th Infantry, Hawaii Army National Guard; 100th Battalion, 442d Infantry, US Army Reserve; and the 1st Battalion, 184th Infantry California Army National Guard. Now reorganized, the 25th Infantry Division trained for the next eight years throughout the Pacific Theater and continued to improve its combat capabilities with troop deployment varying in size from squads, who participated in training missions with Fijian forces, to exercises as large as Team Spirit, where more than 5,000 divisional troops and 1,700 pieces of equipment were airlifted to South Korea for this annual exercise.

In 1985, the division began its reorganization from a conventional infantry division to a light infantry division. The four primary characteristics of this new light infantry division were to be: mission flexibility, rapid deployment and combat readiness at 100 percent strength with a Pacific Basin orientation. Major configuration changes included the addition of a third infantry brigade, an additional direct-support artillery battalion and the expansion of the combat aviation battalion to a brigade-sized unit. With the loss of large quantities of heavy equipment, the 25th Infantry Division earned the designation &quot;light&quot; — the reorganization was completed by 1 October 1986. Training became more sophisticated and more intense. In 1988, the division&#x27;s first battalions participated in rotations at the Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. This training center provides the most realistic training available to light forces in the Army. Coupled with joint/combined training exercises Cobra Gold in Thailand, Kangaroo in Australia and Orient Shield in Japan, the division&#x27;s demanding exercise schedule significantly increased the division&#x27;s fighting capabilities. Until 1993 Operation Team Spirit in Korea remained the division&#x27;s largest annual maneuver exercise, involving more than half of the division&#x27;s strength.

===Desert Storm and the Post-Cold War era===
Very few of the division&#x27;s units participated in Operation Desert Storm, due to the division being earmarked for Pacific contingencies, such as a renewal of hostilities in Korea. However, during the Gulf War, one platoon each from Companies A, B and C, 4th Battalion, 27th Infantry, deployed to Saudi Arabia in January 1991. These Tropic Lightning soldiers were scheduled to be replacement squads in the ground campaign; however, after observing their performance in desert warfare training, the Assistant Commander of Third U.S. Army asked for them to become the security force for the Army&#x27;s forward headquarters. In that role, the Wolfhound platoons were alerted and attached to Third Army (Forward) into Kuwait City 26 February, where they secured the headquarters area and conducted mop-up operations in the city and its adjacent mine fields. Company A&#x27;s platoon was separated from the other Wolfhounds following that battle to accompany General H. Norman Schwarzkopf into Iraq 1 March 1991 to provide security at the truce signing. The three platoons returned to Schofield Barracks without casualties on 20 March 1991.

In 1995, the division underwent another reorganization and reduction as a part of the Army&#x27;s downsizing. First Brigade and its direct support units were inactivated and moved to Fort Lewis, Washington, where they were again reactivated as a detached brigade of the 25th Infantry Division (Light). Today the division is composed of the 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Teams (based in Schofield Barracks, Hawaii), the 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (Schofield Barracks), a Combat Aviation Brigade, division support command, and a complement of separate battalions. As a major ground reserve force for the U.S. Pacific Command, the &quot;Tropic Lightning&quot; Division routinely deploys from Schofield Barracks to participate in exercises in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia and the Big Island of Hawaii.

===Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan===
The division did not take part in the fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq from 2001 to 2003. However, in early 2004, units from the division deployed to Iraq to take part in the combat operations of that country. The 2d Brigade deployed in January 2004 to Iraq and returned to Schofield Barracks in February of the following year. The 3d Brigade, 25th Infantry Division began deploying to Afghanistan in March 2004. The first element to deploy was 2d Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment (&quot;Wolfhounds&quot;). They were accompanied by Battery B, 3d Battalion, 7th Field Artillery Regiment. The Wolfhounds operated in the volatile Paktika Province on the border with Pakistan in the Waziristan region. The 25th Infantry Division redeployed to Schofield Barracks Hawaii in April 2005.

The 25th Infantry Division is recognized for the first successful free democratic elections in Afghanistan on 9 October 2004. One of the missions of the 25th Infantry Division was to track down insurgent Taliban and Al-Qaeda members in the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan.

2005-2006 saw reorganization of 25th ID&#x27;s brigades. 2nd and 3rd BCTs became Stryker and infantry brigade combat teams, respectively. 4th Brigade Combat Team (Airborne), 25th Infantry Division was activated in Fort Richardson, Alaska. The &quot;Light&quot; designation was dropped from the division name in January 2006. On 15 December 2006 the 172nd Stryker Brigade Combat Team was reflagged as the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. Soldiers of the former 1st Stryker BCT at Fort Lewis, Washington moved to Germany to become part of the new 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment.

The 4th &quot;Spartan&quot; Brigade made its first combat deployment in October 2006 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, serving for total of 15 months when the brigade was extended as part of the troop surge. 2nd Brigade arrived in Iraq for a fifteen-month tour of duty in November 2007 and was based at Camp Taji northwest of Baghdad. Serving with the Multi-National Division-Baghdad, the brigade was responsible for the rural areas northwest and west of Baghdad with the 1st Battalion operating near Abu Ghuraib. 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry, working closely with their Iraqi counterparts, eliminated terrorist cells and uncovered and destroyed multiple weapons caches. The brigade returned to Schofield Barracks in early 2009.

In 2009, the 1st BCT, 2nd BCT, and 3rd BCT were deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom while the 4th BCT deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.

In June–August 2009, elements of the 25th Division participated in Operation Champion Sword.

December 2010 saw the division headquarters and headquarters battalion (HHBN) deploy to Baghdad Iraq to become the last division headquarters in Iraq. &quot;Task Force Lightning&quot; simultaneously advised and assisted Iraqi security forces, pursued insurgents, and prepared bases and equipment for transfer to Iraqi authorities. On 18 December 2011 the Division Headquarters completed its retrograde, training and security mission and redeployed back to Schofield Barracks Hawaii.

In April 2011, 3rd &quot;Bronco&quot; Brigade returned to Afghanistan for a 12-month deployment. As part of Regional Command- East, 3rd BCT assumed responsibility for security and stability operations for Nangarhar, Kunar and Nuristan provinces located along the border with Pakistan. 1st Brigade followed in May 2011, deploying for 12 months to Kandahar Province. Partnered with the Afghan forces, the brigade conducted offensive operations that resulted in a major reduction of insurgent attacks in the province. In December 2011, the 4th BCT returned to Afghanistan for second time. The brigade was operated in Paktika and Khost Province near the eastern border of Afghanistan. In October 2012, the 4th BCT officially ended its 9-month deployment turning over operational responsibility to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division.

The Combat Aviation Brigade, 25th Infantry Division was also in Afghanistan, from 1 January 2012 to 1 January 2013. The CAB operated in several key regions of Afghanistan, executing missions ranging from air assault to air movement, resupply and counterinsurgency operations. The CAB&#x27;s Company F (Pathfinder), 2d Battalion, 25th Aviation Regiment, was on the ground conducting missions alongside Afghan forces. The Pathfinders conducted air assault missions with the 2nd Afghan National Civil Order Patrol SWAT to cut off the export of drugs into the area and keep the weapons from coming into the province. The CAB flew its last mission on 7 January 2013. The CAB, 3d Infantry Division took over 25th&#x27;s mission.

In late 2017, approximately 1,500 soldiers of the 4th BCT deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel.

On summer 2019, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team deployed to Iraq as a part of Operation Inherent Resolve. They relieved the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division.

===Post Global War on Terror Reorganization===

As part of Army-wide restructuring, units of the 25th ID underwent transformations and reorganizations. In 2016, 2nd BCT transferred its Strykers and reorganized to an infantry BCT. The brigade also deactivated its 1st Battalion, 14th Infantry Regiment. In addition, the 25th ID CAB&#x27;s armed reconnaissance squadron swapped its OH-58 Kiowa for Apaches.

In May 2022, Army leadership announced US Army Alaska will be reflagged to 11th Airborne Division. Subsequently, in June 2022 the two 25th ID patch wearing units, 1st and 4th BCTs, which were under operational control of USARAK, reflagged to 1st and 2nd Brigade Combat Teams, 11th Abn Division, respectively.

==Division memorial==
The 25th Infantry Division Memorial, which is located at Schofield Barracks, consists of four statues. The first statue was unveiled in June 2005. Cast in bronze, it depicts a War on Terrorism infantry soldier, representing the more than 4,000 soldiers of the division who have served in Afghanistan and Iraq since the war began in 2001. The other three statues represent the division&#x27;s soldiers who served in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam.

The War on Terrorism statue was sculpted by local artist Lynn Liverton. An active-duty soldier, wounded in Iraq, was selected by the Army in 2005 as the model for the statue. He is shown in full infantry uniform (bearing his surname), looking at a deceased comrade&#x27;s boots, weapon, and helmet, set up as a field cross.

<text>Aircheck is the radio industry term for a recording that has dual meanings: a demonstration to show off the talent of an announcer or programmer to a prospective employer, and an archival record of content broadcast over-the-air made for legal archiving purposes. With evolving technology, the term came to be applied in the television industry as well.

A &quot;scoped&quot; (short for &quot;telescoped&quot;—by analogy with pressing the ends of a hand-held telescope to reduce its size) aircheck usually contains only segments where the announcer is actually talking, along with a bit of the music or commercial on either side. In an &quot;unscoped&quot; aircheck, all programming is left intact and unedited, including music, commercials, newscasts, jingles and other on-air events.

The term is also applied by some to recordings made &quot;off-the-air&quot; by listeners, using consumer or semi-professional equipment. These airchecks became more common with the advent of commercial cassette recorders.

==History==

One of the oldest known surviving airchecks consists of a 15-minute broadcast by Bing Crosby on Los Angeles station KHJ and the CBS network from September 2, 1931. It was recorded by the RCA Victor company of Hollywood and is fully documented in the Victor files at the National Archives. The recordings were made by RCA Victor at the request of rival network NBC, which apparently wanted to monitor the then-rising young singer. The sound of the recording suggests that it was made by placing an open microphone before a high-quality radio (a method known in the radio trade as a &quot;mic-feed&quot;).

== Methods ==
Airchecks can be recorded directly off the air (from a tuner or modulation monitor), from the pre-air feed that goes into the transmitter (which has usually been modified by the station&#x27;s processing), or directly from before the station&#x27;s processing has been applied.

Some radio stations used &quot;logger reels&quot; for airchecks. On these large reels of tape would be recorded the air signal at super-slow speeds. These reels were kept by the station for regulatory purposes (e.g. to provide an audio record that commercials ran as logged or to confirm aired content after allegations of inappropriate content). After a time, normally around 30 days for most stations, these logger reels would be reused or discarded.

Many airchecks are made by the announcers themselves on a recorder that begins recording when the microphone is turned on and then goes into pause when the microphone goes off. In the 1960s and 1970s reels of tape were used for these &quot;skimmer&quot; airchecks. Later it was cassettes. Today most stations use computer digital recordings (usually MP3 or WAV) for aircheck creation.

Airchecks made by listeners, generally with consumer-grade equipment, are often lost to poor quality copies made with tape playback machines that are not aligned to the recording machine. Many airchecks were made to record DXing reception, which often included fading, static and interference.

== Uses == 
DJs use airchecks to critique themselves, sometimes with the Program Director listening along with them to provide suggestions for improvements. Announcers keep some of their airchecks as &quot;audio snapshots&quot; of their career.

Airchecks are also recorded at radio stations to send to clients to demonstrate how their live commercials, remote breaks or contests sounded.

Some airchecks of older radio programs are highly prized by collectors, due to their nostalgia value. For example, baby boomers often enjoy listening to airchecks recorded from Top 40 radio stations in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly if they are airchecks of the same stations that the person listened to when they were a teenager or young adult. Many such airchecks were made in the 1960s by DJs who then sent them to troops in the Vietnam War, and a surprising number have survived. Another class of aircheck has to do with transitions between programming formats on a given station, where recordings are made of the final hours of an old format or early beginnings of a new format.

A large number of airchecks have survived from listeners during the Top 40 era, many of whom recorded talented DJs to learn how to be DJs, and many who recorded Top 40 music because it was cheaper than buying the 45s. Still others were, and still are, recorded by radio personalities themselves for archiving their own work. Many have been donated to online aircheck &quot;museums&quot;, such as Reelradio, Airchexx.com by Archivist Steve West in Connecticut, and Rock Radio Scrapbook by Dale Patterson in Canada.

An example of the high quality of many of these archived broadcasts is a recording of Dan Taylor on 66 WNBC New York during the station&#x27;s weekend &quot;Time Machine&quot; format from January 16, 1988, the final year of WNBC&#x27;s existence as a radio station from Airchexx.com.

== For television == 
Airchecks are also used in the television industry, mostly for billing purposes. An aircheck is the only accurate record of what aired on a TV station. Stations generally retain airchecks for one year.

Generally, airchecks are recorded by the master control department of most TV stations, and for decades were recorded on VHS tapes, although today recordings are often made digitally. The standard is three 8-hour tapes per day, one per shift. On this tape is the video of the off-air receiver at the station recording what was actually broadcast; usually there is a time-of-day graphic superimposed over the video to keep track of what aired and when it aired.

Most local TV programs (and network TV broadcasts on local affiliated stations) were not recorded until the early 1970s, when video tape became available to consumers. With the advent of video sharing websites such as YouTube, video airchecks have been posted, and made viewable by the public, of TV programs (including news programs, sporting events, short-lived sitcoms and game shows) not seen since their original broadcast, or otherwise previously considered rare or even lost.

<text>Fiore Furlano de Cividale d&#x27;Austria, delli Liberi da Premariacco (Fiore dei Liberi, Fiore Furlano, Fiore de Cividale d&#x27;Austria; born ca. 1350; died after 1409) was a late 14th century knight, diplomat, and itinerant fencing master.

He is the earliest Italian master from whom an martial arts manual has survived. His Flower of Battle (&quot;Fior di Battaglia&quot;, &quot;Flos Duellatorum&quot;) is among the oldest surviving fencing manuals.

== Life ==

Fiore dei Liberi was born in Cividale del Friuli, a town in the Patriarchal State of Aquileia in the Friuli region of modern-day Italy, the son of Benedetto and scion of a Liberi house of Premariacco. The term &quot;Liberi&quot;, while potentially merely a surname, probably indicates that his family had imperial immediacy, either as part of the Edelfrei (&quot;nobili liberi&quot;, &quot;free nobles&quot;), the Germanic unindentured knightly class which formed the lower tier of nobility in the Middle Ages, or possibly of the rising class of Imperial Free Knights. It has been suggested by various historians that Fiore and Benedetto were descended from Cristallo dei Liberi of Premariacco, who was granted immediacy in 1110 by Emperor Henry V, but this has yet to be confirmed.

Fiore wrote that he had a natural inclination to the martial arts and began training at a young age, ultimately studying with &quot;countless&quot; masters from both the Italian and German parts of the Holy Roman Empire.

He also writes of meeting many &quot;false&quot; or unworthy masters who lacked even the limited skill he&#x27;d expect in a good student, 
and mentions that on five separate occasions he was forced to fight duels for his honor against certain of these masters whom he described as envious because he refused to teach them his art; the duels were all fought with sharp longswords, unarmored except for gambesons and chamois gloves, and he stated that he won each without injury.

He further offers an extensive list of the famous &quot;condottieri&quot; that he trained, including Piero Paolo del Verde (Peter von Grünen), Niccolo Unricilino (Nikolo von Urslingen), Galeazzo Cattaneo dei Grumelli (Galeazzo Gonzaga da Mantova), Lancillotto Beccaria di Pavia, Giovannino da Baggio di Milano, and Azzone di Castelbarco, and also highlights some of their martial exploits.

Based on Fiore&#x27;s autobiographical account, he can tentatively be placed in Perosa (Perugia) in 1381 when Piero del Verde likely fought a duel with Pietro della Corona (Peter Kornwald). 
That same year, the Aquileian War of Succession erupted as a coalition of secular nobles from Udine and surrounding cities sought to remove the newly appointed Patriarch, Philippe II d&#x27;Alençon. Fiore seems to have sided with the secular nobility against the cardinal as in 1383 there is record of him being tasked by the grand council with inspection and maintenance on the artillery pieces defending Udine (including large crossbows and catapults). There are also records of him working variously as a magistrate, peace officer, and agent of the grand council during the course of 1384, but after that the historical record is silent. The war continued until a new Patriarch was appointed in 1389 and a peace settlement was reached, but it&#x27;s unclear if Fiore remained involved for the duration. Given that he appears in council records five times in 1384, it would be quite odd for him to be completely unmentioned over the subsequent five years, and since his absence after May 1384 coincides with a proclamation in July of that year demanding that Udine cease hostilities or face harsh repercussions, it seems more likely that he moved on.

After the war, Fiore seems to have traveled a good deal in northern Italy, teaching fencing and training men for duels. In 1395, Fiore can be placed in Padua training the mercenary captain Galeazzo Gonzaga of Mantua for a duel with the French Marshal Jean II Le Maingre (who used the war name &quot;Boucicaut&quot;). Galeazzo made the challenge when Boucicaut called into question the valor of Italians at the royal court of France, and the duel was ultimately set for Padua on 15 August. Both Francesco Novello da Carrara, Lord of Padua, and Francesco I Gonzaga, Lord of Mantua, were in attendance. The duel was to begin with spears on horseback, but Boucicaut became impatient and dismounted, attacking his opponent before he could mount his own horse. Cattaneo landed a solid blow on the Frenchman&#x27;s helmet, but was subsequently disarmed. At this point, Boucicaut reached for his poleaxe but the lords intervened to end the duel.

Fiore surfaces again in Pavia in 1399, this time training Giovannino da Baggio for a duel with a German squire named Sirano. It was fought on 24 June and attended by Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan, as well as the duchess and other nobles. The duel was to consist of three bouts of mounted lance followed by three bouts each of dismounted poleaxe, estoc, and dagger. They ultimately rode two additional passes and on the fifth, Baggio impaled Sirano&#x27;s horse through the chest, slaying the horse but losing his lance in the process. They fought the other nine bouts as scheduled, and due to the strength of their armor (and the fact that all of the weapons were blunted), both combatants reportedly emerged from these exchanges unharmed.

Fiore was likely involved in at least one other duel that year, between his final named student Azzone di Castelbarco and Giovanni degli Ordelaffi, as the latter is known to have died in 1399. After Castelbarco&#x27;s duels, Fiore&#x27;s activities are unclear. Based on the allegiances of the nobles that he trained in the 1390s, he seems to have been associated with the ducal court of Milan in the latter part of his career. Some time in the first years of the 15th century, Fiore composed a fencing treatise in Italian and Latin called &quot;The Flower of Battle&quot; (rendered variously as &quot;Fior di Battaglia&quot;, &quot;Florius de Arte Luctandi&quot;, and &quot;Flos Duellatorum&quot;). The briefest version of the text is dated to 1409 and indicates that it was a labor of six months and great personal effort; as evidence suggests that two longer versions were composed some time before this, we may assume that he devoted a considerable amount of time to writing during this decade.

Beyond this, nothing certain is known of Fiore&#x27;s activities in the 15th century. Francesco Novati and D. Luigi Zanutto both assume that some time before 1409 he accepted an appointment as court fencing master to Niccolò III d&#x27;Este, Marquis of Ferrara, Modena, and Parma; presumably he would have made this change when Milan fell into disarray in 1402, though Zanutto went so far as to speculate that he trained Niccolò for his 1399 passage at arms. However, while two surviving copies of &quot;the Flower of Battle&quot; are dedicated to the marquis, it seems more likely that the manuscripts were written as a diplomatic gift to Ferrara from Milan when they made peace in 1404.

C. A. Blengini di Torricella stated that late in life he made his way to Paris, France, where he could be placed teaching fencing in 1418 and creating a copy of a fencing manual located there in 1420. Though he attributes these facts to Novati, no publication verifying them has yet been located. The time and place of Fiore&#x27;s death remain unknown.

Despite the depth and complexity of his writings, Fiore dei Liberi does not seem to have been a very influential master in the development of Italian fencing. That field was instead dominated by the tradition of his near-contemporary the Bolognese master Filippo di Bartolomeo Dardi. Even so, there are a number of later treatises which bear strong resemblance to his work, including the writings of Philippo di Vadi and Ludwig VI von Eyb of Hartenstein. This may be due to the direct influence of Fiore or his writings, or it may instead indicate that the older tradition of Johane and Nicholai survived and spread outside of his direct line.

== The Flower of Battle ==

Four illuminated manuscript copies of this treatise survive, and there are records of at least two others whose current locations are unknown. The Ms. Ludwig XV 13 and the Pisani Dossi Ms. are both dedicated to Niccolò III d&#x27;Este and state that they were written at his request and according to his design. The Ms. M.383, on the other hand, lacks a dedication and claims to have been laid out according to his own intelligence while the Mss. Latin 11269 lost any dedication it might have had along with its prologue. Each of the extant copies of &quot;the Flower of Battle&quot; follows a distinct order, though both of these pairs contain strong similarities to each other in order of presentation.

The major sections of the work include: &quot;abrazare&quot;, unarmed plays (usually translated as &quot;wrestling&quot; but more literally &quot;grappling&quot;); &quot;daga&quot;, including both unarmed defenses against the dagger and plays of dagger against dagger; &quot;spada a un mano&quot;, the use of the sword in one hand (also called &quot;the sword without the buckler&quot;); &quot;spada a dui mani&quot;, the use of the sword in two hands; &quot;spada en arme&quot;, the use of the sword in armor (primarily techniques from the halfsword); &quot;azza&quot;, plays of the poleaxe in armor; &quot;lancia&quot;, spear and staff plays; and mounted combat (including the spear, the sword, and grappling). Brief bridging sections serve to connect each of these, covering such topics as &quot;bastoncello&quot;, or plays of a small stick or baton against unarmed and dagger-wielding opponents; plays of longsword vs. dagger; plays of staff and dagger and of two clubs and a dagger; and the use of the chiavarina against a man on horseback.

The format of instruction is largely consistent across all copies of the treatise. Each section begins with a group of Masters (or Teachers), figures in golden crowns who each demonstrate a particular guard for use with their weapon. These are followed by a master called &quot;Remedio&quot; (remedy) who demonstrates a defensive technique against some basic attack (usually how to use one of the listed guards to defend), and then by his various Scholars (or Students), figures wearing golden garters on their legs who demonstrate iterations and variations of this remedy. After the scholars there is typically a master called &quot;Contrario&quot; (counter), wearing both crown and garter, who demonstrates how to counter the master&#x27;s remedy (and those of his scholars), who is likewise sometimes followed by his own scholars in garters. In rare cases, a fourth type of master appears called &quot;Contra-Contrario&quot; (counter-counter), who likewise wears the crown and garter and demonstrates how to defeat the master&#x27;s counter. Some sections feature multiple master remedies or master counters, while some have only one. There are also many cases in which an image in one manuscript will only feature a scholar&#x27;s garter where the corresponding image in another also includes a master&#x27;s crown. Depending on the instance, this may either be intentional or merely an error in the art.

=== &quot;Fior di Battaglia&quot; (Ms. M.383) ===

The Ms. M.383, titled &quot;Fior di Battaglia&quot;, is in the holdings of the Morgan Library &amp; Museum in New York City, NY. Novati described it as a small, thin, vellum folio, pen and ink with gold highlights, and illustrations of sword and lance combat on foot and horseback. Unlike the other surviving manuscripts, the swords and other weapons were enameled in silver, though it has since tarnished to a glossy black. This is the briefest copy of Fiore&#x27;s work currently known, with only 19 folios; it has a prologue in Italian and four illustrated figures per page in the main body. The figures are accompanied by text that is often identical to that of the Ms. Ludwig XV 13 (excepting differences in spelling), but at times includes additional explanation. The Ms. M.383 is almost certainly longer when it was first written; its text makes reference to sections on poleaxe, dagger, and grappling which are not present in the book&#x27;s current state. It also refers to a certain play of the sword in one hand which is likewise missing from that section. This manuscript is typically referred to as the &#x27;Pierpont Morgan version&#x27; or simply the &#x27;Morgan&#x27;.

The known provenance of the Ms. M.383 is:

* Written between 1400 and 1409. The Pisani Dossi Ms. dates to 1409 and states that the master had fifty years of experience in the martial arts; the Ms. M.383 and the Ms. Ludwig XV 13 both state that he had been training for &quot;forty years and more&quot;, which makes them slightly older.
* before 1780 – it occupied ff 241–259 of a larger collective binding titled, &quot;Arte di armeggiare a piedi ed acavallo&quot; (codex Soranzo MCCLXI) in the Biblioteca Soranzo in Venice (Library of Jacopo Soranzo, Venetian senator, 18th century). The other contents of this codex are unknown.
* 1780–1836 – the collection of the Venetian former Jesuit Matteo Luigi Canonici (1727–c.1806) (sold London, Sotheby&#x27;s, 15 June 1836, no. 40).
* 1836–1903 – owned by Rev. Walter Sneyd of Bagington Rectory, Coventry (sold London, Sotheby&#x27;s, 19 Dec. 1903, no. 720).
* 1903–1909 – owned by Tammaro de Marinis (catalog 8, 1908, plate 9).
* 1909–1913 – owned by John Pierpont Morgan.
* 1913–1924 – owned by John Pierpont Morgan, Jr. (donated 1924).

=== &quot;Fior di Battaglia&quot; (Ms. Ludwig XV 13) ===

The Ms. Ludwig XV 13, also titled &quot;Fior di Battaglia&quot;, is currently in the holdings of the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, CA. Its prologue, format, illustrations, and text are all very similar to the Ms. M.383, though it&#x27;s largely free of silver enamel. The text takes the form of descriptive paragraphs set in poor Italian verse, which are nevertheless fairly clear and informative. Despite its shared characteristics with the Ms. M.383, there are important differences, not the least of which is the vastly different order of the information. This is the longest and most comprehensive of the four manuscripts of &quot;Fior di Battaglia&quot;. This manuscript is typically referred to as the &#x27;Getty version&#x27;.

The known provenance of the Ms. Ludwig XV 13 is:

* Written between 1400 and 1409. The Pisani Dossi Ms. dates to 1409 and states that the master had fifty years of experience in the martial arts; the Ms. M.383 and the Ms. Ludwig XV 13 both state that he had been training for &quot;forty years and more&quot;, which makes them slightly older.
* before 1474 – owned by Nicolò Marcello of Venice.
* ca. 1699 – gifted to Apostolo Zeno (1668–1750), who created a copy of the preface.
* before 1825 – owned by Luigi Celotti (sold London, Sotheby&#x27;s, 1825)).
* 1825–1966 – the Ms. 4202 in the collection of Thomas Phillipps (sold London, Sotheby&#x27;s, 1966).
* 1966–1983 – the Ms. Ludwig XV 13 in the collection of Peter and Irene Ludwig.
* 1983–present – the Ms. Ludwig XV 13 in the J. Paul Getty Museum.

The contents of the Ms. Ludwig XV 13 are as follows:

* Prologue (ff 1v–2v)
* (ff 3r–5v – blank pages)
* &quot;Abrazare&quot; stances (f 6r)
* &quot;Abrazare&quot; plays (ff 6v–8r)

=== &quot;Flos Duellatorum&quot; (Pisani Dossi Ms.) ===

The Pisani Dossi Ms., titled &quot;Flos Duellatorum&quot;, was believed to have been lost in World War II and only resurfaced in a private collection in Italy in 2005. Novati described this manuscript as an unbound collection of leaves, covered with a cardboard folder with a marbled paper cover. The Pisani Dossi Ms. is the only manuscript in the series that includes a date, claiming to be completed on 10 February 1409 after six months of effort. It consists of 36 folia and possesses two different prologues, one in Renaissance Latin and one in Italian. The body of the text consists of four to six illustrations per page, each with only a brief couplet or quatrain to explain it. This manuscript is typically referred to as either the &#x27;Novati&#x27; or &#x27;Pisani Dossi version&#x27;.

The Pisani Dossi Ms. was published in facsimile by Francesco Novati in 1902, including the only reproductions of a copy of &quot;the Flower of Battle&quot; that are clearly in the public domain. However, it is unclear how accurate this facsimile is as evidence suggests that Novati may have hired an artist to create a tracing of the original manuscript rather than reproducing it directly. This would have provided ample opportunity for errors to creep into the images, and might also account for the significant divergences from the artistic style of the Getty and the Morgan.

The known provenance of the Pisani Dossi Ms. is:

* Completed by Fiore de&#x27;i Liberi on 10 February 1409. Though it was dedicated to Niccolò III d&#x27;Este, there is no evidence that it ever passed into his library.
* before 1663 – belonged to Schier de&#x27; Prevosti da Valbregaglia, passed into the library of the Sacchi da Bucinigo family (purchased before 1902, Carlo Alberto Pisani Dossi).
* before 1902–present – owned by the Pisani Dossi family.

The contents of the Pisani Dossi Ms. are as follows:

* Latin Prologue (f 1r)
* Italian Prologue (ff 1r–1v)
* (ff 2r–2v – blank pages)
* &quot;Abrazare&quot; stances (f 3r)
* &quot;Abrazare&quot; plays (ff 3v–4v)
* &quot;Bastoncello&quot; plays (f 4v)
* &quot;Daga&quot; intro (f 5r)
* &quot;Daga&quot; plays (ff 5r–11v)
* Four strikes of the sword (ff 11v–12r)
* &quot;Spada a un mano&quot; plays (ff 12r–13v)

=== &quot;Florius de Arte Luctandi&quot; (Mss. Latin 11269) ===

The Mss. Latin 11269, titled &quot;Florius de Arte Luctandi&quot; in a 17th-century script, was rediscovered in the holdings of the Bibliothèque nationale de France by Ken Mondschein in 2008. Any preface it once possessed is missing from the current form of the manuscript; it consists of 44 folios with two pairings per page, and is the only copy of Fiore&#x27;s treatise whose illustrations are fully painted. Unlike Fiore&#x27;s other works, this manuscript is written entirely in Latin; its descriptions are cast in couplets and quatrains similar to the Pisani Dossi Ms. This manuscript is generally referred to as either the Florius or the Paris. Mondschein speculates that this was a presentation copy made for Lionello d&#x27;Este.

The known provenance of the Mss. Latin 11269 is:

* Written in the early 15th century, probably after the completion of Flos Duellatorum in 1409.
* Ca. 1635 – rebound by a master papermaker who worked at the Puy-moyen mill for Sieur Janssen.
* before 1712 – in the collection of Louis Phélypeaux, marquis de Phélypeaux. Donated by him to the Bibliothèque du Roi, where it was labeled &quot;Florius de Art Luctandi&quot;.
* 1712–present – held by the Bibliothèque du Roi/Bibliothèque Nationale de France.

The contents of the Mss. Latin 11269 are as follows:

* Title page (f 1r)
* Segno with 7 swords and animal virtues (f 1v)
* Mounted combat (ff 2r–5v)
* Spear vs. cavalry (ff 6r–6v)
* &quot;Lanza&quot; plays (ff 6v–7v)
* Plays of spear with dagger and two clubs with dagger (f 8r–8v)
* &quot;Azza&quot; plays (ff 8v–10r)
* &quot;Spada a un mano&quot; (ff 10r–12r)

* Sword vs. dagger plays (ff 20r–20v)
* &quot;Daga&quot; intro (f 21r)
* &quot;Daga&quot; plays (ff 21v–25v)

* &quot;Abrazare&quot; plays (ff 39r–42v)
* &quot;Daga&quot; plays (ff 43r–44r)
* Closing (f 44r)

=== Codices LXXXIV and CX ===

The Codex LXXXIV (or Ms. 84) is mentioned in the 1436 and 1508 catalogs of the Biblioteca Estense in Ferrara, but disappeared some time in the 16th century. It consisted of 58 folios bound in leather with a clasp, with a white eagle and two helmets on the first page. The Codex CX (or Ms. 110) is also mentioned in the 1436 and 1508 catalogs of the Biblioteca Estense, but not in later inventories. It consisted of 15 small-format folios on unbound parchment, and was written in two columns.

The contents and current whereabouts of these copies of the Flower of Battle are unknown. It is possible that these listings refer to manuscripts listed above, though none currently possess the correct number of folios or match the physical descriptions.

<doc id="444959" wikidata="Q945332" url="?curid=444959" title="Centennial (miniseries)">
<text>Centennial is a 12-episode American television miniseries that aired on NBC from October 1978 to February 1979, and again from September 1980 to October 1980. The miniseries follows the fictional history of Centennial, Colorado, from 1795 to the 1970s. It was based on the 1974 novel of the same name by James A. Michener and was produced by John Wilder.

With a runtime of 26 hours and a $25 million budget, it was one of the longest miniseries ever and the most expensive television show in history. It employed four directors and five cinematographers, and featured over 100 speaking parts. &quot;Centennial&quot; was released on DVD on July 29, 2008.

==Synopsis==
This epic television series chronicles the settlement and development of an area of Colorado that would eventually become the fictional town of Centennial. It begins with the arrival of the first white men, French trapper Pasquinel and Scottish trader Alexander McKeag. Other settlers who care for the land and attempt to co-exist with the original Pawnee and Cheyenne people are Mennonite Levi Zandt, who founds the town, German immigrant Hans Brumbaugh, who is the first to raise crops, and Englishman Oliver Seccombe, who sees the opportunity to graze large herds of cattle.

As the town grows and evolves, the land loses its unspoiled beauty. Later arrivals include the Wendell family who seeks to gain power and wealth, and Colonel Frank Skimmerhorn who believes only the white man belongs and that the Indians must either be killed or driven off. In the modern area, rancher Paul Garrett, who can trace his family line back to Pasquinel, fights to prevent exploitation of the land by Morgan Wendell, a wealthy businessman.

==Episodes==
== Production ==
Principal filming occurred in 1978. There were numerous filming locations in several parts of the United States. Colorado filming locations included Greeley, the Pawnee National Grasslands, Denver, Central City, Orchard, Bent&#x27;s Old Fort National Historic Site and the Rocky Mountain National Park. Several of the mountain men era scenes were filmed in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. The scenes representing St. Louis in the late 18th and early 19th century were filmed in Augusta, Kentucky. The White Hall State Historic Site in Richmond, Kentucky served as the Bockweiss mansion. Scenes representing the Zendt farm and Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, were filmed in and around Coshocton, Ohio.

The ranch house and surrounding buildings used for the Venneford Ranch house was the Highlands Ranch Mansion in Highlands Ranch, which is located near the real town of Centennial, Colorado. Years later the surrounding property was developed for housing by the Mission Viejo Company. One of the streets in the development was named Venneford Ranch Road.

The Great Western Railway engine No. 75 was back-dated for scenes in the 1880s and then modernized for scenes in the 1910s.

On November 27, 1978, actor Richard Kelton died on location south of Denver after one day of shooting his scenes. Cast as the adult character of Philip Wendell, Kelton&#x27;s death was the result of accidental carbon monoxide asphyxiation due to improper ventilation in his dressing room trailer. Universal Studios, which produced the mini-series, was fined $720 for the failure to provide a proper ventilation system for the trailer where Kelton was rehearsing his lines. His wife received a $50,000 settlement per a statute in California Workers Compensation Law.

=== Differences between the book and miniseries ===

Although Michener began his novel in prehistory, the series itself begins with elements from Chapter 4 of his book, &quot;The Many Coups of Lame Beaver&quot;. The Wendells use the badger game to blackmail the town pastor out of his house in the miniseries, but in the book they get the house from a local businessman. The novel devotes an entire section to Kurt Brumbaugh&#x27;s development of Central Beet company; the miniseries, however, makes only passing reference to it.

In the miniseries, Morgan Wendell tries to cover up his family&#x27;s shady history, but in the book he speaks openly about the murder and his father&#x27;s admiration of the sheriff to the author–who in turn agrees to publish the facts of the killing &quot;after&quot; the election. Paul Garrett is in his 50s and is Lloyd&#x27;s grandson in the miniseries, but he is in his early 40s in the novel and is their great-grandson. The miniseries skips a generation for the sake of simplicity. This skipped generation would have revealed that Garrett is also a descendant of Maxwell and Lisette Mercy, Levi and Lucinda Zendt, and John Skimmerhorn.

There is no election pitting Garrett against Wendell in the novel. Wendell is elected Commissioner of Resources, and Garrett reluctantly accepts his offer to be his principal deputy. The novel also portrays Wendell as a more reasonable and balanced man than what is depicted in the miniseries. It is he, not Garrett, who makes the reference to Warren G. Harding as the anti-standard by which all politicians should be judged.

=== Historical basis ===

The Pasquinel character bears similarities to Jacques La Ramee, a French-Canadian, coureur de bois, fur trapper who explored the region, of the North Platte River, in southern Wyoming, in the early 19th century. The &quot;Pasquinel brothers&quot;, the sons of Pasquinel and Clay Basket, are loosely-based on the four half-breed sons of trader William Bent, of Old Bent&#x27;s Fort, near present-day La Junta, Colorado. During &quot;The Yellow Apron&quot;, Pasquinel tells his son Jake that he was named after his good friend and early trapping partner, &quot;Jacques La Ramee&quot;.

The character of Indian hater and religious fanatic Colonel Frank Skimmerhorn appears to be loosely based on John Chivington, a disgraced ex-Methodist minister who led the infamous Sand Creek massacre in Kiowa County, Colorado in 1864. The miniseries however seems to imply that the Skimmerhorn character is a Mormon since he refers to the Arapaho as &quot;Lamanites&quot;, a term found in Mormon theology to refer to Indians, but not in Protestant or Roman Catholic doctrine. Captain John McIntosh&#x27;s (Major Mercy in the novel) role in the incident and subsequent trial appears to be loosely based on Silas Soule.

The range war depicted in the series is similar in many respects to the 1892 Johnson County War in Wyoming. The scene where Nate Person, Bufe Coker, and Fat Laura are murdered by hired killers, the Pettis brothers, bears similarity to the lynching of Ellen &quot;Cattle Kate&quot; Watson with the Oliver Seccombe character taking a role similar to that of Albert John Bothwell. The character of Hans &quot;Potato&quot; Brumbaugh appears to be loosely based on the Colorado historical figure Rufus &quot;Potato&quot; Clark, a failed gold prospector who turned to agriculture and became a pioneer in irrigation. Like the character in Centennial, Clark grew wealthy by growing potatoes near Littleton, eventually switching to sugar beets and controlling more than .

Despite the name and location, the city of Centennial, Colorado was founded in 2001 and is &quot;not&quot; based on the novel, but rather was independently inspired by Colorado&#x27;s 1876 statehood.

== Broadcast ==
&quot;Centennial&quot; originally aired during the 1978-1979 television season. It re-aired in the fall of the 1980-1981 season during the 1980 actors&#x27; strike which delayed the availability of new programs.

<text>Joseph Blaine Johnson (August 29, 1893 – October 25, 1986) was an American politician who served as the 70th governor of Vermont from 1955 to 1959.

==Biography==
Born in Helsingborg, Sweden, Johnson moved with his family from Sweden to Springfield, Vermont, in 1902 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He graduated from the University of Vermont in 1915 and became a mechanical engineer. Johnson was a Congregationalist. He married Virginia F. Slack on September 23, 1919.

==Career==
Johnson worked at the Bryant Chucking Grinder Company, starting as a draftsman and retiring as General Manager in 1949. He also served as vice president of the Springfield Cooperative Savings and Loan Association, director of the First National Bank of Springfield, and director of the Lovejoy Tool Company of Springfield.

Johnson was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives in 1945 and served from 1945 to 1946. He was elected to the Vermont Senate from Windsor County in 1947 and served until 1951. He then served two terms from 1951 to 1955 as the 65th lieutenant governor of Vermont.

Receiving the Republican nomination for governor, Johnson won the election and served from January 6, 1955 to January 6, 1959. During his administration, he sponsored legislation supporting increased financial support for the University of Vermont. He also facilitated Vermont&#x27;s inclusion in the federal interstate highway system. He was a Vermont delegate to the 1956 Republican National Convention. After serving two terms as governor, he retired from public life but remained director of the Lovejoy Tool Company.

==Death==
Johnson died on October 25, 1986, and is interred at Summerhill Cemetery, Springfield, Windsor County, Vermont.

<doc id="444964" wikidata="Q2984388" url="?curid=444964" title="Centennial (novel)">
<text>Centennial is a novel by American author James A. Michener, published in 1974. It traces the history of the plains of north-east Colorado from prehistory until the mid-1970s. Geographic details about the fictional town of Centennial and its surroundings indicate that the region is in modern Weld County.

&quot;Centennial&quot; was made into a popular twelve-part television miniseries, also titled &quot;Centennial&quot;, that was broadcast on NBC from October 1978 through February 1979 and was filmed in several parts of Colorado. NBC Universal released a six volume DVD set in 2008.

== Overview ==
Michener lived in Greeley during the late 1930s and was familiar with the area. He used a variety of source material for his fictional town taken from various areas in eastern Colorado, and Centennial is not meant to represent a single settlement. His description of the town&#x27;s location places it at the junction of the South Platte River and the Cache la Poudre River. This is roughly halfway between the Colorado towns of Greeley and Kersey, in central Weld County on the High Plains about east of the base of the Rockies. There is a city called Centennial, Colorado, but it did not exist until 2001 and its location and history are not like the town described in either the book or miniseries.

Many episodes in the book are loosely based on events in eastern Colorado and south-east Wyoming, which for novelistic reasons are brought to one locale. For example, &quot;The Massacre&quot; is based on the Sand Creek Massacre which took place in Kiowa County, Colorado, in 1864. Other parts of the book are loosely based on a family from Sterling in Logan County. In explaining fact from fiction, Michener states in the text that:

This is a novel. Its characters and scenes are imaginary. There was no Venneford Ranch, no prairie town of Line Camp, no Skimmerhorn cattle drive of 1868, no Centennial. None of the families depicted here were real, nor founded upon real precedents. There was no Lame Beaver, nor Skimmerhorn nor Zendt nor Grebe. On the other hand, certain background incidents and characters are real. There was a great convocation in 1851 at Fort Laramie. There was a drought in 1931–5. Jennie Jerome, the mother of Winston Churchill, did frequent the English ranches near Cheyenne. Charles Goodnight, one of the great men of the west, did haul the corpse of his partner home in a lead box. Melchior Fordney, the master gunsmith, was murdered. The South Platte River did behave as described.

<text>Andrew Fordham (2 February 1962 – 15 July 2021) was an English professional darts player, commonly known as The Viking. He won the 2004 BDO World Darts Championship and the 1999 Winmau World Masters.

== Darts career ==
Fordham made his first appearance on the stage at Lakeside in the 1995 BDO World Darts Championship and reached the semi-finals before losing to Richie Burnett. Another semi-final defeat followed in 1996, this time to Steve Beaton. On both these occasions, his victor then went on to claim the title. Second round defeats followed in 1997 (to Marshall James) and 1998 (to Raymond van Barneveld) before Fordham made it to the semi-final stage of the World Championship for third time in 1999, but was defeated by Ronnie Baxter.

His 2000 campaign ended in the quarter-finals at the hands of Chris Mason and his fourth semi-final loss in 2001 was to Ted Hankey. In 2002 and 2003 he went out in the first and second rounds respectively.

Fordham finally put an end to his &quot;nearly man&quot; reputation in the 2004 World Championship. His run saw him win his first match comfortably, 3–0 against qualifier Brian Derbyshire. He then beat former Masters champion Tony West 3–0, and teased a 9-dart leg in the third set. He defeated Darryl Fitton in the quarter-finals 5–4, and then stunned Van Barneveld, the defending world champion and strong tournament favourite, by recovering from 0–3 and 2–4 down to win the match 5–4, in what is still considered one of the most dramatic and exciting matches in BDO history.

In the final, Fordham defeated Mervyn King, hitting a 139 checkout to take the eighth set 3–2 when King had reached a double-18, and then recovering from 2–0 down in the next set to take it 3–2 with double-8, and win the match by 6 sets to 3.

=== Showdown with Taylor and health concerns ===
On 21 November 2004, Fordham, as reigning BDO world champion, faced off against Phil Taylor, the reigning PDC world champion, in a best-of-13-sets match at Purfleet&#x27;s Circus Tavern. The special pay-per-view event was billed as &quot;The Showdown&quot; and was promoted and broadcast by Sky Sports. During the match, Fordham became unwell and complained of shortness of breath. He took a break after the seventh set and was advised not to continue by medical staff at the venue. Taylor was leading the match 5–2 at the time and declared the winner by default.

After the incident Fordham visited a doctor, and following medical tests he was informed that, as a result of long term alcohol damage, his liver was operating at only 25% capacity. He was advised to stop drinking alcohol immediately. Fordham&#x27;s health had long been a concern; at one point he weighed and was in the habit of regularly consuming 24 bottles of lager before going on stage to play darts. He admitted to the media that he had felt more comfortable playing when not fully sober. The doctors&#x27; advice led Fordham to seek help and assistance via the television programme &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot;, where he became friends with the journalist and TV presenter Paul Ross.

While getting an exercise regime underway to try to lose some weight, in January 2005 Fordham returned to the Lakeside World championship as defending champion, but was defeated 3–2 in the first round by Dutchman Vincent van der Voort. He failed to progress past the first round of any of the other BDO majors that year, although he did reach the final of the Masters of Darts event, where he lost 7–1 to Phil Taylor.

Fordham made another Lakeside appearance in 2006 but again suffered a first round exit, this time losing 3–0 to Australia&#x27;s Simon Whitlock. Fordham was scheduled to face Whitlock again in the first round of the 2007 BDO World Darts Championship, but prior to the tournament starting he was again hospitalised after complaining of chest pains and breathing difficulties. Subsequently, he had 18 litres of bile drained from his lungs and was to remain in hospital for three weeks. Fordham was withdrawn from the tournament, with Whitlock receiving a walkover to the second round. Less than one week after being discharged from hospital, Fordham suffered what was initially thought to be a minor stroke, but which turned out to be severe breathing difficulties caused by further fluid build-up in his lungs. He eventually made a full recovery. In 2008, Fordham applied for a liver transplant. Although initially on an emergency liver transplant list, he subsequently lost 17 st (108 kg, 238 lbs) in weight and stopped drinking alcohol completely, leading to an announcement in December that, due to the improvement in his physical well-being, he probably would not now require a transplant for five years.

=== Return to darts ===

In September 2007, after a nine-month absence from darts due to his health issues, Fordham made a low-key return to the oche at the Turunc Open in Turkey. Fordham did comparatively well, reaching the semi-final of the singles event where he lost to the eventual winner Martin Phillips from Wales. During his lay-off from the game, Fordham had lost 10 stone (63.5 kg, 140 lbs).

He won one match in an attempt to qualify for the 2008 Lakeside World Championship, but went out in the last 128 and also lost in his opening match at the last 136 stage of the Winmau World Masters. He then received an invitation to play at the Zuiderduin Masters in December 2007 – but lost both matches 0–5, to Mark Barilli (averaging 53.43) and to Co Stompé (averaging 76.20).

=== Move to the PDC ===
Fordham made his PDC debut in March 2009 at a Players Championship in Coventry, losing his preliminary round match 6–4 against Gary Scratchley. After ending his first six tournaments with no prize money and without a single win, Fordham won his first match at the East Midlands Players Championship, beating Jon Archer 6–4 and earned £200 for his efforts. He eventually lost to James Wade in the last 64 stage. He also won £200 in Austria and a combined total of £400 over two tournaments in Nuland. As of October 2011, Fordham was ranked 303 in the PDC Order of Merit, having not won any prize money since October 2009.

After steady improvement in results and increased practice to regain his skills, in 2013, he made a return to competitive tournament darts.

=== Return to the BDO ===
It was announced that Fordham would return to the British Darts Organisation in 2013, starting with the Dutch Open. MariFlex were announced as his new sponsors in February 2013. He also extended his long running partnership with leading darts sponsor Winmau in May 2013.

Fordham was awarded a wild card for the televised stages at the 2014 BDO World Trophy and faced Alan Norris in the first round. He was beaten 6–2 by Norris.

In October 2015, Fordham advanced through a field of almost 200 players to qualify for the 2015 Grand Slam of Darts (a PDC major), winning one of two BDO UK Qualifiers. He was unable to qualify from a group consisting of Adrian Lewis, Michael Smith and Wayne Jones. His only victory, 5–3 against Jones, was his first televised win in over ten years, since the Masters of Darts in February 2005. Fordham also received a wildcard for the 2015 Zuiderduin Masters. He failed to qualify from his group because of an inferior legs difference to Brian Dawson. Also in 2015, Fordham notably reached the quarter-finals of the Jersey Classic and the last 16 of the Hal Masters, German Masters and BDO International Open.

In September 2015, Fordham was awaiting clearance to play darts for the White Bear in the Chorley Darts and Dominoes League.

He extended his partnership with Winmau for a further five years in April 2016. Fordham was unveiled as an ambassador for the British Disability Darts Association (BDDA) in May 2016. Handed another wildcard for the 2016 BDO World Trophy, Fordham lost 6–2 to Glen Durrant in round one.

===2018===
He attempted to qualify for the 2018 World Masters, reaching the last 272.

==Performance timeline==


==Outside darts==
Fordham was the eldest of a brother and two sisters. He grew up in Charlton, south-east London and attended Charlton Manor Primary School and Eaglesfield Secondary School. He was a keen track-and-field athlete in his younger days and was nicknamed &#x27;The Whippet&#x27; at school.

Fordham was a fan of Rangers, and paraded his BDO World Championship trophy before a game at Ibrox Stadium in 2004. He was also a fan of Millwall, and paraded his trophy at half-time of a match at The Den.

==Death==
On 15 July 2021, Fordham died in hospital from organ failure after a long battle with health problems. He had been a heavy drinker and was diagnosed with cirrhosis, where reportedly more than 70 per cent of his liver had been destroyed. He was 59.

<text>John Hugo Aronson (September 1, 1891 – February 25, 1978) was an American businessman and politician from the Republican Party and the 14th Governor of the State of Montana.

==Biography==
John Hugo Aronson was born in Gällstad, Älvsborg County, Sweden. He was one of five children born to Johan Aron Johanson (1856–1927) and Juliana Fredrika Johansdotter (1857–1940). Aronson was married twice, to Matilda Langane and then to Rose McClure.

==Career==
In 1915, Aronson filed for a homestead in Elk Basin, Montana. In 1922 oil was discovered in the Kevin Sunburst Oil Field in Toole County, among the richest Montana&#x27;s natural gas and oil fields. Aronson operated his own rig-building outfit. He soon added a trucking business to the rig-building company and started advertising as &quot;The Galloping Swede&quot;. He served as a member of Montana House of Representatives in 1938 and the Montana Senate in 1944.

Aronson ran for Governor of Montana in 1952, challenging incumbent Democratic governor John W. Bonner, whom he ended up narrowly defeating. When he ran for re-election in 1956, he was opposed by State Attorney General Arnold Olsen, whom he defeated by a slim margin to win his second and final term as governor. Aronson authorized the exclusive revenue for the state Highway Department with the creation of state gasoline user taxes. Governor Aronson also authorized the creation of the Legislative Council to assist the legislative branch in the creation of necessary law.

Aronson died in the Veterans Hospital at Columbia Falls, Montana, exactly ten years after his wife&#x27;s death. He was buried in Pleasant View Cemetery, Mondovi, Lincoln County, Washington.

<text>Old Fort Erie, also known as Fort Erie, or the Fort Erie National Historic Site of Canada, was the first British fort to be constructed as part of a network developed after the Seven Years&#x27; War (known as &quot;the French and Indian War&quot; in the colonies) was concluded by the Treaty of Paris (1763), at which time France ceded its territories east of the Mississippi River (all of New France) to Great Britain. The installation is located on the southern edge of what is now the Town of Fort Erie, Ontario, directly across the Niagara River from Buffalo, New York, United States.

The fort and surrounding battlefield are owned and operated by the Niagara Parks Commission, a self-funded agency of the Ontario provincial government.

==History==
The British established control of their new territory by occupying the French forts and by constructing a line of communications along the Niagara River and Upper Great Lakes. The original fort, built in 1764, was located on the Niagara River&#x27;s edge below the present fort (parking lot on Lakeshore Road). It served as a supply depot and a port for ships transporting merchandise, troops and passengers via Lake Erie to the Upper Great Lakes. In 1795, the fort consisted of some wooden blockhouses surrounded by a wooden palisade (dropped from the plan was a magazine, officer&#x27;s quarters, storehouses and guard house). Provisions were stored inside the fort, and just outside was a large wooden magazine (original plans were to have it built inside the fort), as well as houses for workmen. The fort was damaged by winter storms and in 1803, plans were made for a new fort on the higher ground behind the original. It was larger and made of flintstone but was not quite finished at the start of the War of 1812.

The fort served as a supply base for British troops, United Empire Loyalists Rangers, and allied Iroquois warriors during the American Revolution. The little fort at the water&#x27;s edge suffered considerable damage due to continuous winter storms. In 1803, planning was authorized for a new Fort Erie on the heights behind the original post. The new fort was made more formidable as it was constructed of the Onondaga flintstone that was readily available in the area.

===War of 1812 (1812–1815)===

Fort Erie was the site of the bloodiest battles during the War of 1812. This new fort was unfinished when the United States declared war on June 18, 1812. Part of the garrison of Fort Erie fought at the Battle of Frenchman&#x27;s Creek against an American attack in November 1812. In 1813, Fort Erie was held for a period by U.S. forces and then abandoned on June 9, 1813. The fort had been partially dismantled by the small garrison of British troops and Canadian Militia as they withdrew.

British reoccupation followed American withdrawal from the area in December 1813. The British attempted to rebuild the fort. On July 3, 1814 another American force landed nearby and again captured Fort Erie. The U.S. Army used the fort as a supply base and expanded its size, adding to defensive fortifications. At the end of July, after the Battles of Chippawa and Lundy&#x27;s Lane, the American army withdrew to Fort Erie. They were besieged by the British for an extended period. In the early hours of August 15, 1814, the British launched a four-pronged attack against the fortifications. A well-prepared American defence and an explosion in the North East Bastion destroyed the British chance for success, and they lost more than 1,000 of their men.

An American sortie on September 17 captured two of the British batteries and the American troops were able to spike the guns in one of them before being driven back to the fort. In the American sortie, NY Militia Brigadier General Davis died at the front of his column. Colonel Gibson was cut down as well. Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Eleazer D. Wood was also killed leading this sortie. Shortly afterward, the British lifted the siege and retired to positions to the north at Chippawa. After an unsuccessful American attack at Cook&#x27;s Mills, west of Chippawa, news reached the American forces that the eastern seaboard of the U.S. was under attack. On November 5, 1814, with winter approaching, the Americans destroyed the fort and withdrew to Buffalo.

===Mid-19th century (1814–1866)===
The Treaty of Ghent was signed December 24, 1814, ending the War of 1812. Fearing further American attacks, the British continued to occupy the ruined fort until 1823. Some of the stones from the fort were incorporated into the construction of St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church in 1824. It was rebuilt after fire and explosion in 1892. Today the church is adjacent to the later constructed Niagara Parkway north of the fort.

The town of Fort Erie began to develop north of the fort when a rail terminus and station were constructed to the area.

===Fenian Raids (1866)===

The Fenians, Irish-American veterans of the American Civil War demanding independence from Britain for Ireland, mounted several raids on Upper Canada. One was quite large, attacking Fort Erie on June 1, 1866 after crossing the Niagara River with a large force of 1,000 to 1500 men (depending on the source of the report). The Fenians occupied the town and demanded food and horses. The only payment they could offer were Fenian bonds, which the townspeople would not accept. The Fenians cut the telegraph wires and tore up some railway tracks.

Afterwards, they marched to Chippewa and the next day to Ridgeway, where they fought the Battle of Ridgeway, a series of skirmishes with the Canadian militia. The Fenians returned to Fort Erie, where they defeated a small force of the Canadian militia.

Unable to get reinforcements from across the river, which was guarded by the Americans, and worried about the large force of British and militia that was approaching, the Fenian commander decided to retreat to the US. Some of his troops deserted. Approximately 850 surrendered to forces of the American navy. This was the last notable Fenian raid on Upper Canada.

===Recent history (1866–present)===
The fort lay vacant with old parts of the barracks, walls and mill still standing. It was eventually settled by military pensioners and others until it was sold to the Niagara Parks Commission in 1901.

The reconstruction of the fort was started in 1937 (featuring only the walls and two barracks). The reconstruction was jointly sponsored by the Provincial and Federal governments and the Niagara Parks Commission, and was a way to invest in a long term project while providing employment during the Depression. The fort was restored to the 1812-1814 period and officially reopened on July 1, 1939. During the restoration, a mass grave of 150 British and 3 American soldiers was uncovered. A monument was erected at this site, in the ruins, in 1904.

The Niagara Parkway was constructed starting at Fort Erie and continues north to Lake Ontario. Sir Winston Churchill was quoted saying that the parkway was &quot;the prettiest Sunday drive in the world.&quot; Each year, during the second weekend of August, hundreds of historical re-enactment enthusiasts come together to re-enact the siege of Fort Erie.

On June 28, 1985 Canada Post issued &#x27;Fort Erie, Ont.&#x27; one of the 20 stamps in the &quot;Forts Across Canada Series&quot; (1983 &amp; 1985). The stamps are perforated 12½ x 13 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited based on the designs by Rolf P. Harder.

<doc id="444977" wikidata="Q289564" url="?curid=444977" title="Swedish royal family">
<text>The Swedish royal family () since 1818 has consisted of members of the Swedish Royal House of Bernadotte, closely related to the King of Sweden. Today those who are recognized by the government are entitled to royal titles and styles (manner of address), and perform official engagements and ceremonial duties of state. The extended family of the King () consists of other close relatives who are not royal and thus do not represent the country officially.

==History==

A Swedish royal family, as closely related to a head of state, has been able to be identified as existent from as early as the 10th century A.D., with more precise detail added during the two or three centuries that followed. An exceptional case is that of Saint Bridget (1303–1373) who outside of Sweden became known as the &quot;Princess of Nericia&quot;, a title which appears to have been a noble, rather than a royal one, since she was not the daughter of a king. Historically confirmed monarchs are listed officially by the Swedish Royal Court.

Until the 1620s Swedish provinces were granted as territorial appanages to royal princes which, as dukes thereof, they governed semi-autonomously. Beginning during the reign of Gustav III, and as codified in § 34 of the 1772 Instrument of Government, provincial dukedoms have existed in the royal family as nominal non-hereditary titles only, without any inherent property ownership or trust attached to them; although several members of the royal family have maintained a special public connection to, and sometimes a secondary residence in, &quot;his or her duchy&quot;.

The son of a Swedish king has usually held the princely title as a royal dynast (such as Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland), but on a rare occasion also as a rank of nobility (such as &quot;Fursten&quot; Prince Frederick William of Hessenstein), or as a courtesy title for an ex-dynast (such as &quot;Prins&quot; Oscar Bernadotte).

<doc id="444984" wikidata="Q905432" url="?curid=444984" title="The Perils of Penelope Pitstop">
<text>The Perils of Penelope Pitstop is an American Saturday morning animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions that premiered on CBS on September 13, 1969. The show ran for one season with a total of 17 half-hour episodes, the last first-run episode airing on January 17, 1970. Repeats aired Sunday mornings on CBS until September 4, 1971; and in syndication as &quot;Fun World of Hanna-Barbera&quot; from 1976 to 1982. It is a spin-off of &quot;Wacky Races&quot;, reprising the characters of Penelope Pitstop and the Ant Hill Mob. Rebroadcasts of the show air on the Cartoon Network-owned channel Boomerang, as well as MeTV Toons.

==Production==
The series was patterned on the silent movie era melodrama cliffhanger movie serial &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot;. It originally was to also star the characters of Dick Dastardly and Muttley, though Dastardly and Muttley were later dropped in pre-production. Those characters would be later reused in their own series, &quot;Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines&quot;.

Joe Ruby and Ken Spears were the head writers for the series, and Ruby, Spears, and Warner Bros. Cartoons veteran Michael Maltese wrote the stories for the individual episodes. Deciding to feature the characters in a different setting, studio heads decided to set the characters into an active adventure format strongly reminiscent of the 1910s.

==Plot==
The series features characters from &quot;Wacky Races&quot;, Penelope Pitstop and the Ant Hill Mob, the latter of whom take on the role of heroes in contrast to their previously nefarious personalities.

In each episode, Penelope&#x27;s guardian, Sylvester Sneekly, attempts to claim Penelope&#x27;s inheritance for himself by attacking her in the disguise of his sinister alter-ego the Hooded Claw. Aided by his twin henchmen the Bully Brothers, who always speak in unison, the Claw creates overly elaborate Rube Goldberg-style plots to do away with Penelope. Even though the Ant Hill Mob often come to Penelope&#x27;s rescue, she herself often needs to save the Mob from the unintended effects of their attempts to rescue her. But just as quickly as Penelope is delivered from one quandary, she almost immediately finds herself ensnared in another one of the Claw&#x27;s traps. Despite their overall bumbling, however, the Ant Hill Mob always manage to rescue Penelope and foil the Hooded Claw&#x27;s plans in the end.

While Penelope is curiously helpless whenever the Hooded Claw grabs her, once he leaves her tied up for his fiendish plans to take effect she usually becomes resourceful and ingenious, sometimes coming up with spontaneous or creative methodologies to escape her own predicaments.

==Characters==
* Penelope Pitstop is the title character and the protagonist of the spin-off. She is the heiress who inherits the Pitstops&#x27; vast fortune, but is unaware that her guardian, Sylvester Sneekly, who disguises himself as the Hooded Claw, has plans to kill her for her fortune. She is often rescued by the Ant Hill Mob from her perils and she also rescues them when they fail to rescue her. Despite constantly being portrayed as the typical damsel in distress, Penelope is shown to be clever and resourceful when in danger.
* The Ant Hill Mob is a group of seven adventurers. This incarnation is vastly altered from their Wacky Races incarnation where they are active gangsters constantly being chased by various law officials into a collection of thrill seekers who openly reflect characteristics of the Seven Dwarfs of the fairy tale &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. The Mob are usually the ones called upon to rescue Penelope when she is caught in one of the Hooded Claw&#x27;s schemes.
** Clyde: The Moe Howard-like leader of the Mob. He is the only character who retains his Wacky Races format though drastically reduced in the Wacky Races aggressive nature
** Dum Dum: comedic foil to &quot;straight man&quot; Clyde and is the marksman of the group despite his reduced intellect.
** Pockets: inventor and technical support person of the group who carries an excessive number of devices or creating such devices from the source material he carries in his multitude of pockets visible on his suit.
** Snoozy: A constantly sleeping character.
** Softy: Cries at any opportunity, often at ironic times (often heard sobbing &quot;Penelope is saved!&quot;).
** Yak Yak: In many ways Softy’s opposite, Yak Yak instead chuckles at any opportunity, including inappropriate ones (&quot;Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hoo! We&#x27;re gonna crash! Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hoo!&quot;).
** Zippy: A character with impressive speed.
* Chugga-Boom (a.k.a. Chuggie): The Ant Hill Mob&#x27;s sentient touring car.
* Sylvester Sneekly/the Hooded Claw: The guardian of Penelope Pitstop and the main antagonist of the spin-off, who plots to kill Penelope to inherit her vast fortune. Described by the show&#x27;s narrator as &quot;that villain of villains&quot; in his disguise as the Hooded Claw, he manages to capture or kidnap Penelope, who is unaware of her guardian&#x27;s secret identity. In most episodes, he usually makes deadly traps for Penelope to get her killed and thereby get her inheritance. However, he always fails to kill Penelope when the Ant Hill Mob rescues her or Penelope outsmarts him when she manages to free herself from his traps. When his plans are foiled, he angrily yells &quot;Blast!&quot;
** The Bully Brothers: The Hooded Claw&#x27;s henchmen. The two large goons speak almost entirely in unison in a guttural voice: &quot;Right, Claw.&quot;

==Cast==
* Janet Waldo as Penelope Pitstop
* Mel Blanc as Yak Yak, Chug-a-Boom, the Bully Brothers
* Don Messick as Dum Dum, Snoozy, Pockets, Zippy
* Paul Winchell as Clyde, Softy
* Gary Owens as Narrator
* Paul Lynde as Sylvester Sneekly/the Hooded Claw (uncredited)

==Episodes==
==Home media==
On , Warner Home Video (via Hanna-Barbera Cartoons and Warner Bros. Family Entertainment) released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 territories. The UK had the full series released on DVD on July 31, 2006 in Region 2 PAL format. The series is also available at the iTunes Store.
==Cultural references==
* The 1984 song &quot;The Power of Love&quot; by British dance-pop band Frankie Goes to Hollywood makes reference to the show&#x27;s main villain, the Hooded Claw.
* The 2008 series &quot;Headcases&quot; featured segments parodying &quot;The Perils of Penelope Pitstop&quot;.
* The Hooded Claw appears in the &quot;Wacky Races&quot; episode &quot;The Trial of Dick Dastardly&quot; voiced by Tom Kenny impersonating Paul Lynde. He appears as the prosecutor at Dick Dastardly&#x27;s trial. There is also a reference to the original voice actor Paul Lynde&#x27;s appearances on the original 1966-1981 version of &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; as the Hooded Claw is shown in a middle square. The Hooded Claw was planned to return in season 3 but the series was canceled after the second season.
* The Hooded Claw and the Bully Brothers will appear in &quot;Jellystone!&quot;.

<doc id="444990" wikidata="Q652964" url="?curid=444990" title="Boeing 377 Stratocruiser">
<text>The Boeing 377 Stratocruiser was a large long-range airliner developed from the C-97 Stratofreighter military transport, itself a derivative of the B-29 Superfortress. The Stratocruiser&#x27;s first flight was on July 8, 1947. Its design was advanced for its day; its relatively innovative features (though neither completely new) included two passenger decks and a pressurized cabin. It could carry up to 100 passengers on the main deck plus 14 in the lower deck lounge; typical seating was for 63 or 84 passengers or 28 berthed and five seated passengers.

The Stratocruiser was larger than the Douglas DC-6 and Lockheed Constellation and cost more to buy and operate. Its reliability was poor, chiefly due to problems with the four 28-cylinder Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major radial engines and structural and control problems with their propellers. Only 55 Model 377s were built for airlines, along with the single prototype. A 377 was also converted into the Aero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy by John M. Conroy for NASA’s Gemini space program.

==Design and development==

The Boeing 377 Stratocruiser was a civil derivative of the Boeing Model 367, the Boeing C-97 Stratofreighter, which first flew in late 1944. William Allen, who had become president of the Boeing Company in September 1945, sought to introduce a new civilian aircraft to replace reduced military production after World War II. Boeing saw in their large-bodied, fast, and long-ranged military transport potential for a passenger aircraft suited for premium service on long transoceanic routes, expanding on the precedent set by their Boeing 314 Clipper with Pan American World Airways. Despite a recession in late 1945, Allen ordered 50 Stratocruisers, spending capital on the project without an order from an airline customer. His gamble that customers would be interested in Boeing&#x27;s unique and expensive new airplane turned out to be correct for a brief period.

On November 29, 1945, Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) became the launch customer with the largest commercial aircraft order in history, a $24.5 million order for 20 Stratocruisers. Earlier in 1945, a Boeing C-97 had flown from Seattle to Washington, D.C. nonstop in six hours and four minutes; with this knowledge, and with Pan Am President Juan Trippe&#x27;s high regard for Boeing after their success with the Boeing 314 Clipper, Pan Am was confident in ordering the expensive plane.

The 377 shared the distinctive design of the C-97, with a &quot;double-bubble&quot; fuselage cross-section, resembling a figure-8, with the smaller loop on the bottom, with of interior space shared between two passenger decks. Outside diameter of the upper lobe was 132 inches, compared to 125 inches for the DC-6 and other Douglas types (and 148 inches for today&#x27;s 737). The lower deck served as a lounge, seating 14. The 377 had innovations such as higher cabin pressure and air conditioning; the superchargers on the four Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 engines increased power at altitude and allowed constant cabin pressure. 

The wing was the Boeing &quot;117&quot; airfoil. In all, 4 million man-hours went into the engineering of the 377. It was one of only a few double deck airliners ever built for commercial use, another being its French contemporary, the Breguet Deux-Ponts, as well as later models, the 747 and the Airbus A380. 

The first flight of the 377 was on July 8, 1947, two years after the first commercial order. The flight test fleet of three 377s underwent of flying to test its limits before certification.

Adoption of the Stratocruiser got a boost from the US government, with a controversial incentive package offered to Northwest Orient Airlines for its purchase. Its components were unusually generous mail contracts offered to Northwest for opening new routes to Hawaii and points in the western Pacific region that they were invited to apply for, and a Reconstruction Finance Corporation loan earmarked for the purchase of a fleet of Stratocruisers. Pan-Am saw Northwest&#x27;s mail contract deal and appealed for new terms in their own international mail contracts, which were granted much to the consternation of Trans World Airlines, who were able to provide the same Atlantic mail services as Pan-Am with lower operating costs. The Northwest deal led to allegations of graft and political favoritism towards Boeing. 

The other carriers who adopted the Stratocruiser were British Overseas Airways Corporation, American Overseas Airlines (merged with Pan Am in 1950) and United Airlines. The last 377 was delivered to BOAC in May 1950. On this delivery flight, Boeing engineer Wellwood Beall accompanied the final 377 to England, and returned with news of the de Havilland Comet, the first jet airliner, and its appeal. The tenure of the Stratocruiser with United ended in 1954, when United had the opportunity to sell them to BOAC after finding them unprofitable without the extra mail subsidies enjoyed by Pan Am and Northwest.

Only 56 were built, one prototype (later reconditioned) and 55 production aircraft. As a result of low production volume, Boeing lost $7 million on the aircraft.

==Operational history==
As the launch customer, Pan Am was the first to begin scheduled flights, from San Francisco to Honolulu in April 1949. At the end of 1949 Pan Am, BOAC and American Overseas Airlines (AOA) were flying 377s transatlantic, while Northwest Orient Airlines was flying in the United States; in January 1950 United began flights from San Francisco to Honolulu. Stratocruisers were pressed into emergency military service after the onset of the Korean War. In late 1950 Northwest Stratocruisers were serving New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Milwaukee, Spokane, Seattle, and Honolulu. 

By late 1952, Northwest Stratocruisers replaced DC-4s to Tokyo via Anchorage, Alaska; Northwest replaced the Stratocruiser on the Honolulu run in 1953 and to Tokyo in 1955. For a short time, Pan Am 377s flew to Beirut, Lebanon, but after 1954, no 377 was scheduled east of Europe or west of Singapore. In 1954, United Stratocruisers flew Los Angeles to Honolulu and between Seattle and San Francisco; United&#x27;s B377 flights to Honolulu were all first class. In 1955, BOAC 377s had 50 First Class seats (fare $400 one way New York to London) or 81 Tourist seats (fare $290). In 1956, Pan Am 377s flew from Los Angeles and San Francisco to Sydney with stops at Honolulu, Canton Island and Suva (via Nadi Airport in Fiji). 

By 1958, Pan Am was operating the Stratocruiser between Seattle, Washington and Fairbanks, Juneau and Ketchikan, Alaska and between Seattle and Whitehorse, Yukon. Within six years of first delivery, the Stratocruiser had carried 3,199,219 passengers; it had completed 3,597 transcontinental flights, and 27,678 transatlantic crossings, and went between the United States and South America 822 times. In these first six years, the Stratocruiser fleet had flown 169,859,579 miles (273,362,494 km).

The 377 was one of the most advanced and capable of the propeller-driven transports, and among the most luxurious, but it was troubled by reliability issues and maintenance costs. Problems included catastrophic failures of propellers, failures of propeller pitch control leading to overspeed incidents, problems related to the poor thermal design of the engine, and aerodynamic problems arising from design constraints imposed by the engine&#x27;s thermal problems. Its service record was marred by a high incidence of in-flight emergencies and hull-loss accidents related to those issues. The propellers were the subject of Airworthiness Directives in 1955, 1957, and 1958.

In 1953, &quot;United&#x27;s [Chief Executive] Ray Ireland ...described the Stratocruiser as unbeatable in luxury attraction but is uneconomical. Ireland said PAA&#x27;s Stratocruiser competition to Hawaii induced United to buy the plane originally.&quot; In 1950, United&#x27;s seven 377s averaged $2.46 &quot;direct operating cost&quot; per plane-mile, and &quot;Indirect costs are generally considered to be equal or greater than the direct costs.&quot; Most operators were using Stratocruisers on long-range routes where higher prices could be charged, off-setting the higher operating costs. 

The exception was Northwest Airlines, who managed to keep the aircraft competitive on shorter U.S. domestic routes where the aircraft&#x27;s higher payload capacity benefited from lower fuel weights. United however could not integrate their six-plane fleet of 377s. By 1954, the lack of spares and the inability to cross-train their Douglas crews with the type relegated their Stratocruisers primarily to their Hawaii route, where they faced stiff competition from Pan American and Northwest. By the end of that year, the six United 377s were all sold to BOAC in a deal orchestrated by Douglas Aircraft. BOAC, which was short of aircraft after the grounding of the Comet 1, paid between US$895,000 and US$995,000 per unit and spares for what were essentially five-year-old aircraft. An equivalent brand new Douglas DC-7 cost US$775,000 (~$ in ) in 1954.

Boeing set never-exceed speed at IAS but in testing, the 377 reached IAS (about TAS) in a 15–20 degree dive at ; another report said it reached true air speed while diving from altitude to in 50 seconds using &quot;full rated power&quot;. Typical airline cruise was less than ; in August 1953, Pan Am and United 377s (and United DC-6s) were scheduled between Honolulu and San Francisco () in 9 h 45 min each way.

The longest (by distance) 377 nonstop flights were made by Pan Am from Tokyo to Honolulu during four winter seasons beginning in 1952–1953. In January 1953, two nonstops a week were scheduled with a flight time of 11 hr 1 min due to tailwinds; the following August all flights took 19 hours, with a stop at Wake Island Airfield. In winter 1953-54, one Tokyo-Honolulu flight took 9 hr 35 min for .

By 1960, Stratocruisers were being superseded by jets: the de Havilland Comet, Boeing 707, and Douglas DC-8. The last flight of the 377 with United was in 1954, the last with BOAC was in 1959, and the last with Northwest was in September 1960. In November 1960, only a weekly Pan Am Honolulu to Singapore flight remained, and the 377 was retired by Pan Am in 1961. High operating costs (notably the fuel consumption and maintenance of the Wasp Major engines) led to rapid abandonment of the 377 with the onset of the jet era. Its contemporaries such as the Douglas DC-6 and the Lockheed Constellation continued longer, on secondary routes or rebuilt as freighters. A few 377s were sold to smaller airlines, used as freighters, or converted by Aero Spacelines into heavily modified enlarged freighters called Guppies. 

During 1959 and 1960, Transocean Airlines assembled a fleet of fourteen at bargain prices. In 1960, TOA went bankrupt and only four were in operable condition. The hulks were stored at Oakland International Airport through the 1960s and cannibalized for parts, contributing some to the Aero Spacelines Guppies. Five remaining 377s were modified by Bedek Aviation to resemble former U.S. Air Force Model 367 Stratofreighters and pressed into service with the Israel Defense Forces. Two were shot down during the course of their service and the three remaining 377Ms were retired in 1978 and later scrapped. None of the 56 377s built were preserved for display in original condition, although one airframe remains today as the Mini Guppy; the IAF Museum in Israel has a C-97 (4X-FPM) on display painted to resemble their most famous 377M, &quot;Masada&quot;.

;377F
:Freighter conversion.
;377M

:In the early 1960s, the Israeli Air Force wanted to upgrade to the C-130 Hercules, which could lift larger payloads, but it was expensive and sales were embargoed by the United States. Israel Aircraft Industries at Ben Gurion International Airport offered to modify Boeing 377 Stratocruisers. It had a stronger cabin floor which could handle cargo, plus a C-97 military Stratocruiser tail section, which included a clamshell cargo door. These were dubbed &quot;Anak&quot; (or Giant in Hebrew) and entered service in 1964. Three of these were modified by the use of a swing tail section, similar to the Canadair CL44D-4 airliner. Two others served as aerial tankers with underwing hose reel refueling pods. Two others were ELINT-platforms for electronic reconnaissance, surveillance and electronic countermeasure (ECM) missions. These were later joined by four KC-97Gs with the flying boom system.

===Aero Spacelines Guppy===
In addition to the Israeli Anaks, a company called Aero Spacelines was converting old 377s to aircraft called Guppies in the 1960s. There were three types: the Pregnant Guppy, Super Guppy, and Mini Guppy. They had an extension to the top of the fuselage to enable them to carry large aircraft parts between manufacturing sites.
The first was the Pregnant Guppy, followed by the Super Guppy, and finally the Mini Guppy. The Super Guppy and the Mini Guppy had turboprop engines.

;Aero Spacelines 377PG Pregnant Guppy
:Conversion of one 377-10-26, incorporating an enlarged upper deck and a fuselage lengthened by 16 feet to carry sections of the Saturn V rocket. One converted.
;Aero Spacelines 377SG Super Guppy
:A single heavy-lift transport similar to the Pregnant Guppy built by Aero Spacelines. The aircraft contained parts of a YC-97J Stratofreighter and a 377-10-26 mated with a larger main fuselage, larger tail and Pratt &amp; Whitney T34 turboprops.
;Aero Spacelines 201 Super Guppy Turbine
:Originally designated the 377SGT, it was similar to the 377SG, but with a more aerodynamic fuselage, a Boeing 707 nosewheel, wingspan stretched by , and four Allison 501-D22C turboprops. Four were built and were used by Airbus to carry aircraft parts between its factories. In the 1990s, Airbus retired them due to rising operational costs and they have been replaced with Airbus Belugas. Two of the former Airbus Industrie Super Guppies remain in Germany and France, with a third being scrapped in December 2020 after eleven years of restoration at Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome in the UK. The fourth aircraft was acquired by NASA as part of a barter agreement with ESA for its role as a partner with the International Space Station.

;Aero Spacelines 377MG Mini Guppy
:Conversion of a 377-10-26, it featured a larger main cabin for oversize cargo, stretched wing and a hinged tail.
;Aero Spacelines 101 Mini Guppy Turbine
:Originally designated the 377MGT. Similar to the 377MG, but powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney T34-PWA turboprop engines. Two built.

==Accidents and incidents==
This aircraft type suffered 13 hull-loss accidents between 1951 and 1970 with a total of 139 fatalities. The worst single accident occurred on April 29, 1952. The aircraft type also experienced a significantly high rate of in-flight emergencies related to engine and propeller failure, resulting in Airworthiness Directives. 

Faults included structural failures of neoprene-cored propellers, failures of propeller pitch control resulting in overspeed, and failures related to engine cooling. Six propeller failures between 1950 and 1955 resulted in separation or near-separation of engines from mounts, with two resulting in hull-loss accidents. Directives were issued in 1950, 1955, and 1958 regarding enhanced maintenance and fault detection, in-flight vibration monitoring, and propeller replacement. 

A Directive concerning the pitch control system was issued after the October 16, 1956 hull-loss accident. A June 1957 overspeed incident occurred on &quot;Romance of the Skies&quot;, after the compliance date of the Directive and less than six months before its fatal accident of November 8, 1957. No hull-loss accidents after the loss of the &quot;Romance&quot; have been attributed to an overspeed incident.

; September 12, 1951
: United Air Lines Flight 7030, a Stratocruiser 10-34 (N31230, named &quot;Mainliner Oahu&quot;), was being used for a semi-annual instrument check of a captain. At 11:39 PDT, the flight was cleared for an ILS approach to the San Francisco Airport. The aircraft, with No. 4 propeller feathered, stalled and abruptly dived from an altitude of approximately 300 feet and was destroyed upon impact in San Francisco Bay. All three crew aboard were killed. The probable cause was an inadvertent stall at low altitude.
; April 29, 1952
: Pan Am Flight 202, a Stratocruiser 10-26 (N1039V, named &quot;Clipper Boa Esperança&quot; aka Clipper Good Hope) en route from Buenos Aires-Ezeiza and Rio de Janeiro–Galeão to New York via Port of Spain crashed in the jungle in the south of the State of Pará. Probable causes are the separation of the second engine and propeller from the aircraft due to highly unbalanced forces followed by uncontrollability and disintegration of the aircraft. All 50 passengers and crew died in the worst-ever accident involving the Boeing 377.
; July 27, 1952
: Pan Am Flight 201, a Stratocruiser 10-26 (N1030V) en route from New York and Rio de Janeiro-Galeão to Buenos Aires-Ezeiza suffered explosive decompression at about 12,000 feet about 20 miles south of Rio de Janeiro. A passenger was blown out and the cabin considerably damaged, but the aircraft was able to return to Rio de Janeiro and make a safe landing. The main cabin door had not been properly locked.
; December 25, 1954
: A BOAC Stratocruiser 10-28 (G-ALSA, named &quot;RMA Cathay&quot;) crashed on landing at Prestwick at 0330 hours, killing 28 of the 36 passengers and crew on board. The aircraft had been en route from London to New York City, when, on approach to Prestwick, it entered a steep descent before leveling-out too late and too severely, hitting the ground short of the runway.
; March 26, 1955
: Pan Am Flight 845/26, a Stratocruiser 10-26 (N1032V, named &quot;Clipper United States&quot;), ditched 35 miles (56 km) off the Oregon coast after the no. 3 engine and propeller tore loose from the wing, causing severe control difficulties. The aircraft sank after 20 minutes in water of about 1,600 m (5,200 ft) depth. There were four fatalities out of the 23 occupants, including two of the crew.
; April 2, 1956
: Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 2, a Stratocruiser 10-30 (N74608, named &quot;Stratocruiser Tokyo&quot;), ditched into Puget Sound after the flight engineer mistakenly failed to close the cowl flaps on the plane&#x27;s engines, an error attributed to confusing instrument layout. Although all aboard escaped the aircraft after a textbook ditching, four passengers and one flight attendant succumbed either to drowning or to hypothermia before being rescued.
; October 16, 1956
: Pan Am Flight 6, a Stratocruiser 10-29 (N90943, named &quot;Clipper Sovereign of the Skies&quot;), ditched northeast of Hawaii during the last leg of an around-the-world flight from Philadelphia to San Francisco after two of its four engines failed following an overspeed incident. The aircraft was able to circle around USCG &quot;Pontchartrain&quot; until daybreak, when it ditched; all 31 on board survived.
; November 8, 1957
: Pan Am Flight 7, a Stratocruiser 10-29 (registered N90944, named &quot;Clipper Romance of the Skies&quot;), left San Francisco for Hawaii with 38 passengers and six crew. The 377 crashed around 5:25 p.m. in the Pacific Ocean. There were no survivors and the entire wreckage has never been found. Only 19 bodies and bits of debris were recovered. There is speculation that two passengers had a motive to bring the plane down. Eugene Crosthwaite, a 46-year-old purser, had shown blasting powder to a relative days prior to the flight, and had cut a stepdaughter from his will only one hour before the flight. Pan Am concluded that there was sufficient evidence that Crosthwaite was the culprit. William Payne, an ex-Navy demolitions expert, had taken out large insurance policies on himself just before the flight, and had a $10,000 debt he was desperate to pay off. The insurance investigator later suspected him of never being on the plane. His wife received at least $125,000 in payouts. It was the opinion of the flight engineer during the &quot;Sovereign&quot; incident, and a pilot who had experienced an overspeed on the &quot;Romance&quot; less than six months before its loss, that an overspeed was a likely cause of the crash. The overspeed theory calls into question whether Pan Am was in compliance with an Airworthiness Directive concerning a weakness in the pitch control system, issued in response to the &quot;Sovereign&quot; incident the previous year.
; June 2, 1958
: A Pan Am Stratocruiser 10-26 (registration N1023V, named &quot;Clipper Golden Gate&quot;) was on a flight from San Francisco to Singapore via several intermediate stops. As the aircraft touched down at Manila (runway 06) in a heavy landing in rainy and gusty conditions, the undercarriage collapsed as a result of the hard landing. The plane skidded and swerved to the right, coming to rest 2,850 feet past the runway threshold and 27 feet from the edge of the runway. One of the passengers was killed when one of the blades of the number 3 propeller broke off, penetrating the passenger cabin.
; April 10, 1959
: At the conclusion of a flight from Seattle to Juneau, Alaska, a Pan Am Stratocruiser 10-26 (N1033V, named &quot;Clipper Midnight Sun&quot;) undershot on final approach and collided with an embankment. The aircraft caught fire and was destroyed, but all 10 passengers and crew survived.
; July 9, 1959
: A Pan Am Boeing Stratocruiser 10-29 (N90941, named &quot;Clipper Australia&quot;) belly landed at Haneda Airport following landing gear problems; all 59 passengers and crew on board survived, but the aircraft was written off.
; August 1967
: An Aero Spacelines Stratocruiser 10-29 (N90942) suffered a ground collision with Stratocruiser 10-32 N402Q at Mojave, California; the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
; May 12, 1970
: An Aero Spacelines 377MGT (N111AS) was being test flown following conversion from a Boeing 377. During the sixth takeoff with one engine shut down, the aircraft turned and rolled to the left. The left wingtip then struck the ground and the aircraft yawed severely after which the forward fuselage struck the ground, destroying the cockpit. All four crew died.

<text>U.S. Route 160 (US 160) is a east–west United States Numbered Highway in the Midwestern and Western United States. The western terminus of the route is at US 89 west of Tuba City, Arizona. The eastern terminus is at US 67 and Missouri 158 southwest of Poplar Bluff, Missouri.
Its route, if not its number, was made famous in song in 1975, as the road from Wolf Creek Pass to Pagosa Springs, Colorado in C.W. McCall&#x27;s country music song &quot;Wolf Creek Pass&quot;.

==Route description==

===Arizona===

US 160 begins at US 89 near the western edge of Navajo Nation. Near Tuba City, it intersects State Route 264. It goes through Tonalea and Cow Springs before entering Kayenta, where it intersects U.S. Route 163. It continues northeast through Dennehotso, then has a brief overlap with U.S. Route 191 in Mexican Water. It goes east until Teec Nos Pos, where it intersects U.S. Route 64, then turns northeast to go to the Four Corners and enters New Mexico.

US 160 is one of the major routes crossing the Navajo Nation and in Arizona does not leave the Navajo Nation.

===New Mexico===

About of US 160 is located within New Mexico. The highway travels northeast through extreme northwestern New Mexico, intersecting State Road 597, which provides access to the Four Corners Monument. US-160 along with NM-597 do not connect to any other portion of the New Mexico state highway network, requiring New Mexico Department of Transportation crews to travel through either Arizona or Colorado to access it.

===Colorado===

U.S. Route 160 enters Colorado near the Four Corners Monument. It goes northeast and intersects U.S. Route 491, then turns north to enter Cortez with U.S. 491. East of Cortez, a road leads south from U.S. 160 to Mesa Verde National Park. It continues east to Durango, where it intersects U.S. Route 550. After overlapping with U.S. 550 south of Durango, U.S. 160 turns east and meets U.S. Route 84 at Pagosa Springs. It then goes northeast and crosses the Continental Divide at Wolf Creek Pass.

From Wolf Creek Pass, U.S. 160 continues northeast and turns east at South Fork. At Monte Vista, an overlap begins with U.S. Route 285, which continues southeast into Alamosa. It turns east, then goes northeast to go through North La Veta Pass, then continues east to Walsenburg, where it intersects Interstate 25.

From Walsenburg, U.S. 160 continues south with Interstate 25 to Trinidad, then turns northeast to intersect U.S. Route 350. It continues east, passing through the Comanche National Grassland before intersecting the concurrent U.S. Route 287 and U.S. Route 385 south of Springfield. It continues east and enters Kansas east of Walsh.

The Wolf Creek Pass is famous in the 1975 C.W. McCall&#x27;s country song of the same name.

===Kansas===

US-160 enters Kansas just west of Saunders. It goes northeast to Johnson City, then turns east to go through Ulysses. Near Sublette, it intersects U.S. Route 83 and runs concurrently southward past its intersection with U.S. Route 56. It turns east and then runs concurrently with U.S. Route 54 between Plains and Meade. It continues east, and runs concurrently with U.S. Route 283 and U.S. Route 183. At Medicine Lodge, it intersects U.S. Route 281. It continues east and at Wellington, intersects U.S. Route 81 and then Interstate 35, on which the Kansas Turnpike is routed in the area.

East of Interstate 35, it intersects U.S. Route 77 in Winfield. It goes east from Winfield, then turns north to Burden, then goes east before going south to Elk City. It then turns east and goes through Independence after being concurrent with U.S. Route 75. It continues east, is briefly concurrent with U.S. Route 169 and then intersects U.S. Route 59 at Altamont. US-160 and US-59 then go into Oswego and separate. At Columbus, US-160 begins a concurrency with U.S. Route 69, which goes east to Crestline, then north to Frontenac, Kansas. Also at Crestline, it picks up a second concurrency with U.S. Route 400, which goes north and ends just south of Pittsburg, Kansas. After Frontenac, it turns east and enters Missouri.

===Missouri===
U.S. Route 160 enters Missouri west of Mindenmines. At Lamar, it intersects Interstate 49/U.S. Route 71. It goes southeast going through Greenfield and Willard before passing through Springfield, where it intersects Interstate 44 and U.S. Route 60, with which it has a short concurrency with the latter. It goes south out of Springfield into Nixa as Massey Boulevard, then turns east and intersects U.S. Route 65 north of Branson. It continues east to West Plains, where it intersects U.S. Route 63, then ends southwest of Poplar Bluff at an intersection with U.S. Route 67 (Future Interstate 57).

In Willard, US 160 runs on a bypass along the western and southern edge of town. The old alignment through Willard is now U.S. Route 160 Business.

==History==

===Western terminus===
As commissioned in 1930 the western terminus was Trinidad, Colorado. In 1939, US 160 absorbed all of former route U.S. Route 450 which ran from U.S. 50 at Crescent Junction, Utah to U.S. Route 85 at Walsenburg, Colorado.

In 1970 many US highways in the Four Corners region were re-aligned. U.S. 160 was diverted southwesterly from Cortez, Colorado to follow its present route past the Four Corners into Arizona, absorbing the route numbered U.S. Route 164 from 1964-1970.

The portion of former US 160 (and US 450) from Crescent Jct. to Monticello, Utah was replaced with U.S. Route 163 (now U.S. Route 191) and the portion from Monticello to Cortez, Colorado was replaced with U.S. Route 666 (now U.S. Route 491).

===Eastern terminus===

The eastern terminus of US 160 was originally located at an intersection with U.S. Route 60 and then-U.S. Route 66 in Springfield, Missouri (Grant Avenue and College Street). In the 1950s, the terminus moved eastward across the state to an intersection with then-US 60 and then-U.S. Route 67 (now US 60 Bus. and U.S. Route 67 Business) in Poplar Bluff. The extension between Springfield and Poplar Bluff was parallel to U.S. Route 65 from Springfield to Highlandville. Between Highlandville and Holister, the highways ran concurrently. Past Holister, US 160 headed east across the Ozark Mountains. Route 160 was later routed further north in the Branson area, replacing a section of Route 148. In 2007, the terminus was moved to its current location southwest of Poplar Bluff, eliminating a concurrency between US 160 and two other highways (US 67 and US 67 Business) over the last 10 miles (16 km) of US 160.

===Missouri===
When U.S. Route 160 was formed in Missouri in 1930, it replaced Route 12, which had been created in 1922 as Route 36 from Kansas to Springfield and renumbered in 1926 due to US 36. The 1950s extension absorbed Route 80 (Gainesville to West Plains in 1922, later extended west to Lakeview and east to Thomasville) and the part of Route 14 east of Alton (created in 1922 as Route 42, and later absorbed by Route 14).

<text>The .45 Reising submachine gun was manufactured by Harrington &amp; Richardson (H&amp;R) Arms Company in Worcester, Massachusetts, USA, and was designed and patented by Eugene Reising in 1940. The three versions of the weapon were the Model 50, the folding stock Model 55, and the semiautomatic Model 60 rifle. Over 100,000 Reisings were ordered during World War II, and were initially used by the United States Navy, Marine Corps, and the United States Coast Guard, though some were shipped to Canadian, Soviet, and other allied forces to fight the Axis powers.

==History==

Reising was an assistant to firearm inventor John M. Browning. In this role, Reising contributed to the final design of the US .45 ACP M1911 pistol. Reising then designed a number of commercial rifles and pistols on his own, when in 1938, he turned his attention to designing a submachine gun as threats of war rapidly grew in Europe.

Two years later he submitted his completed design to the Harrington &amp; Richardson Arms Company (H&amp;R) in Worcester, Massachusetts. It was accepted, and in March 1941, H&amp;R started manufacturing the Model 50 submachine gun. Months later, production began on the Model 55, which was identical to the Model 50 other than having a folding wire buttstock, no compensator, and a barrel; and the Model 60 semiautomatic rifle that also resembled a Model 50, but had an barrel without cooling fins or a compensator.

H&amp;R promoted the submachine guns for police and military use, and the Model 60 for security guards. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 the US was suddenly in desperate need of thousands of modern automatic weapons. Reising&#x27;s only competitor was the .45 ACP Thompson submachine gun.

The US Army first tested the Reising in November 1941 at Fort Benning, Georgia. During this test, several parts failed due to poor construction. Once this was corrected, a second test was made in 1942 at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. In that test, 3,500 rounds were fired, resulting in two malfunctions: one from the ammunition, the other from a bolt malfunction. As a result, the Army didn&#x27;t adopt the Reising, but the Navy and Marines did, due to insufficient supply of Thompsons.

The Reising submachine gun was innovative for its time. In comparison to its main rival, the famous Thompson, it possessed similar firepower, better accuracy, excellent balance, a lighter weight, a much lower cost, and greater ease of manufacture. Despite these achievements, the poor combat performance of the Reising—contrasted with favorable combat and law enforcement use of the Thompson—mired the weapon in controversy.

==Design==

The Reising was far less costly ($62) compared to the Thompson ($200). It was much lighter (seven vs. eleven pounds). The Model 55 was also more compact (about twenty-two vs. thirty-three inches in length).

The Reising cost less than the Thompson because its metal components were mostly stampings instead of machined parts. This also allowed it to be lighter, as did its firing mechanism . Like the 1928A1 Thompson, its operating principle was delayed blowback, but the Thompson&#x27;s Blish lock system was far less mechanically effective and so, like a simple blowback weapon, the Thompson was dependent on high bolt mass or more specifically bolt inertia to provide an acceptably low rate of fire. That is, a lighter bolt, as used in earlier models of the Thompson, would have reciprocated faster and produced too great a firing speed. This in turn meant that the Thompson could not be radically lightened without a deterioration in its controllability, as a heavy gun was necessary in automatic fire, to counteract and stabilize the effects on control and accuracy of its heavy bolt moving back and forwards. The Reising&#x27;s bolt is much lighter due to its delayed blowback mechanism being the main determinant of the automatic rate of fire; and consequently the whole gun could be correspondingly light without detracting from accuracy and controllability.

The M50 Reising&#x27;s delayed blowback operation, often classified as hesitation lock, works as follows: as the cartridge is chambered, the rear end of the bolt is pushed up into a recess, in a manner similar to tilting-bolt locked breech guns; but whereas such weapons rely on an additional mechanism to unlock them, in the case of the Reising the end of the bolt that pushes against the back wall of this recess, is subtly rounded, while the wall is correspondingly curved. On firing, the extreme pressure from the propellant gases is thereby able to force the bolt-end down, back to the horizontal. From here the bolt can move to the rear removing the cartridge from the chamber; but the combination of mechanical disadvantage and friction the force of the gases must overcome to push the end of the bolt down has achieved a delay of a fraction of a second, allowing pressure in the barrel to drop to a level sufficiently low for safe and efficient cartridge extraction.

The Reising fired from a closed bolt with its return spring as part of its cocking handle underneath the barrel. It notably used a linear hammer in the main receiver.

The Reising was more balanced than the Thompson because the barrel-and-receiver-group rested concentrically within the stock. It had smoother lines in that the stock was of conventional shape, and because the cocking handle (action bar) was placed inside the forearm. In addition, it was more accurate both in semi-auto and at the onset of automatic fire, because due to it being a closed bolt gun, only the linear hammer and firing pin moved at the moment the trigger was squeezed, whereas the Thompson slammed home a heavy bolt and actuator.

The Reising was made in selective fire versions that could be switched between semi-automatic or full-automatic fire as needed and in semi-auto only versions to be used for marksmanship training and police and guard use. The Reising had a designed full-auto cyclic rate of 450–600 rounds per minute but it was reported that the true full-auto rate was closer to 750–850 rounds per minute. At those rates, the twenty round magazine could be emptied in less than two seconds. In 1941, the Reising was priced at approximately $50 per weapon as opposed to $225 for the standard military issue Thompson submachine gun.

==Variants==
There were four versions of the Reising, two selective fire models: the M50 and M55, and two semi-automatic only variants: the M60, a .45 ACP carbine, and the M65, chambered for the .22 Long Rifle rimfire cartridge designed for training purposes.


There were two differences between the M50 and the M55, those being the elimination of the compensator and the addition of a folding wire buttstock making the M55 lighter and shorter. M55 was originally issued to Marine parachute infantry and armored vehicle crews.

The M60 was a long-barreled, semi-automatic carbine model designed primarily for military training and police use. However, few of these were ever sold. The Marines used M60s for training, guard duty, and other non-combat roles. Some M60s were believed to have been issued to Marine officers at Guadalcanal. The remaining guns were passed on to State Guards and civilian law enforcement agencies. The M65 was developed as a sub-caliber training rifle version of the M60, produced only from 1944 to 1946. H&amp;R later made updates to the M65 and sold them on the civilian market (and to the Marines in small numbers) as the MC-58 and M150/151/165 Leatherneck.

===H&amp;R Reising light rifle===
From the submachine gun the .30 carbine light rifle prototype was developed, it was competing to become the M1 carbine but lost to Winchester. While sharing many parts with the submachine gun the light rifle uses a gas piston, it was built in semi-automatic and fully automatic versions and issued with a 12 round magazine. 

==USMC deployment==
The Reising entered military service primarily because of uncertainty of supply of sufficient quantities of the Thompson submachine gun. In the testing stage, it won out over some other competing designs. It was very light and quite accurate in aimed fire, and &quot;capable of intensive fire against personnel within a range of 300 yards.&quot; This was attributed to its better stock fit and intricate closed bolt, delayed blowback design. Most submachine guns fire from the open bolt position, meaning the full mass of the bolt slams forward when the trigger is pulled; with the closed-bolt system employed by the Reising there is much less movement involving far lighter components, and the resulting improved control in the moment before shooting gives better accuracy, both for semi-automatic and at the onset of full automatic fire. Less advantageously though, this more accurate firepower was somewhat limited due to the 20-round capacity of its largest magazine.

The U.S. Marines adopted the Reising in 1941 with 4,200 authorized per division with approximately 500 authorized per each infantry regiment. Most Reisings were originally issued to Marine officers and NCOs in lieu of a compact and light carbine, since the newly introduced M1 carbine was not yet being issued to the Marines. Although the Thompson submachine gun was available, this weapon frequently proved too heavy and bulky for jungle patrols, and initially it, too, was in short supply.

During World War II, the Reising first saw action on August 7, 1942, exactly eight months to the day after Pearl Harbor, when 11,000 men from the 1st Marine Division stormed the beaches of Guadalcanal, in the Solomon Islands. The same date of Guadalcanal&#x27;s invasion, the Model 50 and 55 saw action with the 1st Marine Raiders on the small outlying islands of Tulagi and Tanambogo to the north. Two companies of Marine paratroopers also used Model 55s, to attack the island of Gavutu, between Tulagi and Tanambogo. Paramarines and armored crewmen were issued the folding stock M55, and this version included a notable flaw: its wire-frame stock was poorly designed, crude and flimsy, and had a tendency to fold while firing. Moreover, other serious shortcomings in both guns were becoming apparent. The reality was that the Reising was designed as a civilian police weapon and was not suited to the stresses of harsh battle conditions encountered in the Solomon Islands—namely, sand, saltwater that easily rusted the commercial blued finish, and the difficulty in keeping the weapon clean enough to function properly. Tests at Aberdeen Proving Ground and at Fort Benning, Georgia, had found difficulties in blindfold reassembly of the Reising, indicating the design was complicated and difficult to maintain.

The producer, H&amp;R, had not yet mastered mass-production technologies in 1940-1941, and many of the parts were hand fitted at the factory just like the company did with their commercial firearms; this lack of parts interchangeability was not a problem for a civilian security or police firearm, and the Marines had to accept it in order to get the weapons quickly, but it was very problematic when Reisings were maintained in the field under combat conditions; the Marines were not told not to mix up the parts during communal cleaning, as they were used to.

While more accurate than the Thompson, particularly in semi-automatic mode, the Reising had a tendency to jam. The problem with the Reising&#x27;s form of delayed blowback was the recess in which the bolt lodged when in battery. If this accumulated dirt or fouling these could prevent the bolt from seating in it properly; and if this happened the trigger disconnector automatically prevented firing. In addition, the magazine was a staggered-column, single-cartridge feed design, and slight damage to the feed lips or debris in the magazine would render the magazine unusable. A partial solution to the magazine problem was the later introduction of a single-column magazine that reduced the capacity from 20 to 12 rounds.

The Reising earned a dismal reputation for reliability in the combat conditions of Guadalcanal. The M1 carbine eventually became available and was often chosen over both the Reising and the Thompson in the wet tropical conditions, as the M1928 Thompson&#x27;s built-in oiling pads in the receiver were a liability.

==Withdrawal from the Fleet Marine Force==
In late 1943 following numerous complaints, the Reising was withdrawn from Fleet Marine Force (FMF) units and assigned to Stateside guard detachments and ship detachments. After the Marines proved reluctant to accept more Reisings, and with the increased issue of the .30-caliber M1 carbine, the U.S. government passed some Reising submachine guns to the OSS and to various foreign governments (as Lend-Lease aid). Canada purchased some Model 50 SMGs and these were issued to 2nd Battalions in Canada where the 1st Battalions of regiments were serving overseas. They were issued along with .30-06 M1917 Enfields and .30-06 Lewis machine guns. One such unit to receive them was the 2nd Bn, Seaforth Highlanders of Canada. The Veteran&#x27;s Guard of Canada were issued the weapon to guard German prisoners of war. Others were given to various anti-Axis resistance forces operating around the world.

Many Reisings (particularly the semiautomatic M60 rifle) were issued to State Guards for guarding war plants, bridges, and other strategic resources. After the war, thousands of Reising Model 50 submachine guns were acquired by state, county, and local U.S. law enforcement agencies. The weapon proved much more successful in this role, in contrast to its wartime reputation.

==Issues of reliability==
H&amp;R was justifiably proud of the Reising&#x27;s superior accuracy and balance, lighter weight, and ease of manufacturing when compared to the Thompson. However, the Reising&#x27;s close tolerances and delicate magazine proved unreliable in the sand and mud of the Solomons, unless kept scrupulously clean. The gun quickly became despised by front-line Marines, and Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. Edson, Commander, 1st Marine Raider Battalion, ordered that his troops&#x27; Reisings be flung into Guadalcanal&#x27;s crocodile-infested Lunga River, as his troops resorted to reliable bolt-action M1903 Springfield rifles.

This failure made a mockery of H&amp;R&#x27;s company slogan, &quot;Six-and-one-half pounds of controlled dynamite. The H&amp;R Reising will get a bullet there when you need it!&quot;

There are other reasons for its failure. Foremost was the Reising&#x27;s complex design of many small pins, plungers, springs and levers. Disassembly and assembly was difficult even under normal conditions. Simple maintenance was problematic as there was no bolt hold-open device. Chambering a cartridge was awkward as the action bar was hard to grasp in the forearm and could be obstructed by the sling. Worse, the safety/selector switch couldn&#x27;t be sensed by feel at night if it was in the safe, semi, or automatic position.

&quot;Filing-to-fit&quot; of certain parts during production limited interchangeability. The exposed rear sight had no protective ears and was vulnerable to breakage. The adjustable front sight could be lost if the retaining screw wasn&#x27;t tightly secured. The weapon was susceptible to jamming if grime clogged the bolt&#x27;s locking recess in the receiver. The two small magazine guide retaining pins and corresponding receiver stud holes were tapered allowing disassembly and assembly only from one direction—right to left for disassembly, and left to right for assembly; adding unacceptable levels of complexity in a combat environment. The retaining pins had to be delicately tapped out whenever the bolt needed to be removed for cleaning; again, an awkwardly involved task whilst under fire. And afterwards when the pins had to be put back during the reassembly process, if they were inserted either too far or not far enough, the receiver might not fit back into the tight confines of the stock.

==Model confusion==
What constitutes a &quot;commercial&quot; and &quot;military&quot; Model 50 is amorphous. First, H&amp;R never made a distinction; the distinction is made by collectors. This confusion stems from a period in production where early Model 50s were manufactured with commercial characteristics and H&amp;R&#x27;s wartime practice of randomly installing old parts in stock throughout production.

While there is not one factor that distinguishes the so-called commercial from the military model, the commercial model is usually blued. It commonly has a fixed front sight and a rear sight with no retaining screw. It often has 28 fins on the barrel, a one piece magazine release, no outward flanges on the safety/selector switch, and no sling swivels. Lastly, the commercial model commonly has a smooth take-down screw, a two-hole trigger guard, and serial numbers ranging from one to 20,000.

Military Reisings are usually parkerized. They often have an adjustable front sight with an Allen screw and a rear sight with a retaining screw. They routinely have 14 fins on the barrel, a two-piece magazine release, outward flanges on the safety/selector switch, sling swivels, stock ties (crossbolts through the forearm), and a knurled take-down screw. Finally, the military model commonly has a three-hole trigger guard, proofmarks like &quot;PH&quot; or &quot;Pm2&quot; above the chamber, and serial numbers ranging from 20,000 to 120,000.

There are three types of H&amp;R magazines. The first and second models are both smooth body, are blued, and are twenty-shot double column. The first model is distinguished by five cartridge peep holes on the left side, a feature eliminated on the second model to prevent mud and sand from entering. In contrast, the third model is parkerized, has two long indentations on the sides to reduce its capacity to a twelve-shot single column magazine because of feeding problems experienced with former models.

==Postwar==
Production of the Model 50 and 55 submachine guns ceased in 1945 at the end of World War II. Nearly 120,000 submachine guns were made of which two-thirds went to the Marines. H&amp;R continued production of the Model 60 semiautomatic rifle in hopes of domestic sales, but with little demand, production of the Model 60 stopped in 1949 with over 3,000 manufactured. H&amp;R sold their remaining inventory of submachine guns to police and correctional agencies across America who were interested in the Reising&#x27;s selective-fire capability, semi-auto accuracy, and low cost relative to a Thompson. Then, faced with continued demand, H&amp;R resumed production of the Model 50 in 1950 which sputtered to a halt in 1957 with nearly 5,500 additional submachine guns manufactured. But just when the Reising story seemed to end, a final foreign order was received in the 1960s for nearly 2,000 more Model 60s.

Decades later, in 1986, H&amp;R closed their doors and Numrich Arms (aka Gun Parts Corporation) purchased their entire inventory. Acquiring a number of Model 50 receivers, Numrich assembled them with parts. These weapons all have an &quot;S&quot; preceding the serial number and were sold domestically in the early 1990s after reparkerization and fitting with newly manufactured walnut stocks. These stocks are distinguished from originals by their wider than normal sling swivels and buttstocks, by the fact they have no stock ties, and have H&amp;R marked plastic buttplates (originals were unmarked metal).

== Machine gun murders ==
In New Zealand in December 1963, two men thought to have been operating an illegal beerhouse business were murdered execution-style with a Reising submachine gun. At the time, machine guns were not thought to be in the hands of civilians in the country.

<text>A bolo punch is a punch used in martial arts. The bolo punch is not among the traditional boxing punches (jab, uppercut, hook and cross).

&quot;Bolo&quot; is a Filipino single-edged knife similar to the machete. The primary use for the bolo is clearing vegetation. However, it is also one of the most important weapons in Filipino martial arts. After the United States defeated Spain in the Spanish–American War, they took over occupation of the Philippine Islands. Many Filipinos began emigrating to the United States, mostly California and Hawaii, as farm laborers. These immigrants were practitioners of the Filipino martial arts which included the boxing art known as Suntukan, Panantukan, and Pangamot. Many of these Filipino fighters gravitated towards the local sport boxing matches because they could earn more from one boxing match than working a week on the farms. Some used false names and traveled around so they could get around the boxing commission rules and fight more often without any restrictions. They would often use an unorthodox punch that the non-Filipino boxers had never seen before. It became known as the &quot;bolo punch&quot; because the movement was similar to swinging a bolo machete when working to cut down crops like sugar cane when working in the fields.

Ceferino Garcia is commonly referred to as the inventor of the bolo punch, though a 1924 article appearing in the &quot;Tacoma News-Tribune&quot; reported a Filipino boxer named Macario Flores to be using it. Garcia, Kid Gavilán, Sugar Ray Robinson, Sugar Ray Leonard and Pedro Carrasco are widely recognized as some of the best bolo punchers in boxing history. Roy Jones Jr. and Joe Calzaghe also use the bolo punch frequently.

When used in boxing, the bolo punch&#x27;s range of motion is like that of a hook combined with an uppercut. As such, the punch should be thrown at 4–5 o&#x27;clock from an orthodox boxer&#x27;s perspective. Its most important aspect is a circular motion performed with one arm to distract an opponent, causing the opponent to either take his eyes off the attacker&#x27;s other arm or actually focus on the fighter&#x27;s circling arm. When the opponent concentrates on the hand that is circling, the bolo puncher will usually sneak in a punch with the opposite hand. When the rival concentrates on the hand that is not moving, the bolo puncher will usually follow through with a full punch.

Three of the most famous cases of a fighter using the bolo punch were when Leonard avenged his loss to Roberto Durán in &quot;The No Más Fight&quot;, when Leonard drew with Thomas Hearns in their second fight, and when Ike Ibeabuchi knocked out Chris Byrd with a left-handed bolo punch during their 1999 heavyweight contest.

<doc id="445020" wikidata="Q229468" url="?curid=445020" title="Dilution refrigerator">
<text>A 3He/4He dilution refrigerator is a cryogenic device that provides continuous cooling to temperatures as low as 2 mK, with no moving parts in the low-temperature region. The cooling power is provided by the heat of mixing of the helium-3 and helium-4 isotopes. 

The dilution refrigerator was first proposed by Heinz London in the early 1950s, and was experimentally realized in 1964 in the Kamerlingh Onnes Laboratorium at Leiden University.

== Theory of operation ==
The refrigeration process uses a mixture of two isotopes of helium: helium-3 and helium-4. When cooled below approximately 870 millikelvins, the mixture undergoes spontaneous phase separation to form a 3He-rich phase (the concentrated phase) and a 3He-poor phase (the dilute phase). As shown in the phase diagram, at very low temperatures the concentrated phase is essentially pure 3He, while the dilute phase contains about 6.6% 3He and 93.4% 4He. The working fluid is 3He, which is circulated by vacuum pumps at room temperature.

The 3He enters the cryostat at a pressure of a few hundred millibar. In the classic dilution refrigerator (known as a &quot;wet dilution refrigerator&quot;), the 3He is precooled and purified by liquid nitrogen at 77 K and a 4He bath at 4.2 K. Next, the 3He enters a vacuum chamber where it is further cooled to a temperature of 1.2–1.5 K by the &quot;1 K bath&quot;, a vacuum-pumped 4He bath (as decreasing the pressure of the helium reservoir depresses its boiling point). The 1 K bath liquefies the 3He gas and removes the heat of condensation. The 3He then enters the main impedance, a capillary with a large flow resistance. It is cooled by the still (described below) to a temperature 500–700 mK. Subsequently, the 3He flows through a secondary impedance and one side of a set of counterflow heat exchangers where it is cooled by a cold flow of 3He. Finally, the pure 3He enters the mixing chamber, the coldest area of the device.

In the mixing chamber, two phases of the 3He–4He mixture, the concentrated phase (practically 100% 3He) and the dilute phase (about 6.6% 3He and 93.4% 4He), are in equilibrium and separated by a phase boundary. Inside the chamber, the 3He is diluted as it flows from the concentrated phase through the phase boundary into the dilute phase. The heat necessary for the dilution is the useful cooling power of the refrigerator, as the process of moving the 3He through the phase boundary is endothermic and removes heat from the mixing chamber environment. The 3He then leaves the mixing chamber in the dilute phase. On the dilute side and in the still the 3He flows through superfluid 4He which is at rest. The 3He is driven through the dilute channel by a pressure gradient just like any other viscous fluid. On its way up, the cold, dilute 3He cools the downward flowing concentrated 3He via the heat exchangers and enters the still. The pressure in the still is kept low (about 10 Pa) by the pumps at room temperature. The vapor in the still is practically pure 3He, which has a much higher partial pressure than 4He at 500–700 mK. Heat is supplied to the still to maintain a steady flow of 3He. The pumps compress the 3He to a pressure of a few hundred millibar and feed it back into the cryostat, completing the cycle.

== Cryogen-free dilution refrigerators ==
Modern dilution refrigerators can precool the 3He with a cryocooler in place of liquid nitrogen, liquid helium, and a 1 K bath. No external supply of cryogenic liquids is needed in these &quot;dry cryostats&quot; and operation can be highly automated. However, dry cryostats have high energy requirements and are subject to mechanical vibrations, such as those produced by pulse tube refrigerators. The first experimental machines were built in the 1990s, when (commercial) cryocoolers became available, capable of reaching a temperature lower than that of liquid helium and having sufficient cooling power (on the order of 1 Watt at 4.2 K). Pulse tube coolers are commonly used cryocoolers in dry dilution refrigerators.

Dry dilution refrigerators generally follow one of two designs. One design incorporates an inner vacuum can, which is used to initially precool the machine from room temperature down to the base temperature of the pulse tube cooler (using heat-exchange gas). However, every time the refrigerator is cooled down, a vacuum seal that holds at cryogenic temperatures needs to be made, and low temperature vacuum feed-throughs must be used for the experimental wiring. The other design is more demanding to realize, requiring heat switches that are necessary for precooling, but no inner vacuum can is needed, greatly reducing the complexity of the experimental wiring.

==Cooling power==
The cooling power (in watts) at the mixing chamber is approximately given by
: formula_1
where formula_2 is the 3He molar circulation rate, &quot;Tm&quot; is the mixing-chamber temperature, and &quot;Ti&quot; the temperature of the 3He entering the mixing chamber. There will only be useful cooling when
: formula_3
This sets a maximum temperature of the last heat exchanger, as
above this all cooling power is used up only cooling the incident 3He.

Inside of a mixing chamber there is negligible thermal resistance between the pure and dilute phases, formula_4 and 
the cooling power reduces to 
: formula_5

A low &quot;Tm&quot; can only be reached if &quot;Ti&quot; is low. In dilution refrigerators, &quot;Ti&quot; is reduced by using heat exchangers as shown in the schematic diagram of the low-temperature region above. However, at very low temperatures this becomes more and more difficult due to the so-called Kapitza resistance. This is a heat resistance at the surface between the helium liquids and the solid body of the heat exchanger. It is inversely proportional to &quot;T&quot;4 and the heat-exchanging surface area &quot;A&quot;. In other words: to get the same heat resistance one needs to increase the surface by a factor 10,000 if the temperature reduces by a factor 10. In order to get a low thermal resistance at low temperatures (below about 30 mK), a large surface area is needed. The lower the temperature, the larger the area. In practice, one uses very fine silver powder.

==Limitations==
There is no fundamental limiting low temperature of dilution refrigerators. Yet the temperature range is limited to about 2 mK for practical reasons. At very low temperatures, both the viscosity and the thermal conductivity of the circulating fluid become larger if the temperature is lowered. To reduce the viscous heating, the diameters of the inlet and outlet tubes of the mixing chamber must go as &quot;T&quot;, and to get low heat flow the lengths of the tubes should go as &quot;T&quot;. That means that, to reduce the temperature by a factor 2, one needs to increase the diameter by a factor of 8 and the length by a factor of 256. Hence the volume should be increased by a factor of 214 = 16,384. In other words: every cm3 at 2 mK would become 16,384 cm3 at 1 mK. The machines would become very big and very expensive. There is a powerful alternative for cooling below 2 mK: nuclear demagnetization.

<text>Women&#x27;s studies is an academic field that draws on feminist and interdisciplinary methods to place women&#x27;s lives and experiences at the center of study, while examining social and cultural constructs of gender; systems of privilege and oppression; and the relationships between power and gender as they intersect with other identities and social locations such as race, sexual orientation, socio-economic class, and disability.

Popular concepts that are related to the field of women&#x27;s studies include feminist theory, standpoint theory, intersectionality, multiculturalism, transnational feminism, social justice, affect studies, agency, bio-politics, materialism, and embodiment. Research practices and methodologies associated with women&#x27;s studies include ethnography, autoethnography, focus groups, surveys, community-based research, discourse analysis, and reading practices associated with critical theory, post-structuralism, and queer theory. The field researches and critiques different societal norms of gender, race, class, sexuality, and other social inequalities.

Women&#x27;s studies is related to the fields of gender studies, feminist studies, and sexuality studies, and more broadly related to the fields of cultural studies, ethnic studies, and African-American studies.

Women&#x27;s studies courses are now offered in over seven hundred institutions in the United States, and globally in more than forty countries.

== History ==
===Africa===
The erasure of women and their activities in Africa was complex. When women&#x27;s studies emerged in the 1980s, it focused on recovering women from the obscurity of all of African history caused by colonialism and the &quot;patriarchal social systems&quot; left behind in Africa after decolonization. Because systems prevailed which supported boys&#x27; education over that of girls, in the era following independence there were few women who could read and write. Those who could were not encouraged to become professionals and often resorted to activism to address educational and other disadvantages women faced in the 1960s and 1970s. The first generation of scholars focused on establishing and legitimizing Africa&#x27;s precolonial history. They also questioned whether the Western construct of gender applied in Africa or whether the concepts of gender existed in pre-colonial Africa.

Ifi Amadiume&#x27;s work &quot;Male Daughters, Female Husbands&quot; (1987) and Oyeronke Oyewumi&#x27;s &quot;The Invention of Women&quot; (1997) are some of the first works which sought to examine gender perceptions in Africa. In 1977, the Association of African Women for Research and Development (AAWORD) was established to promote research on African women by African women. Scholars affiliated with the organization from its founding included: Simi Afonja (Nigeria), N&#x27;Dri Thérèse Assié-Lumumba (Ivory Coast), (Bolanle Awe (Nigeria), Nawal El Saadawi (Egypt), Nina Mba (Nigeria), Omolara Ogundipe-Leslie (Nigeria), Achola Pala Okeyo (Kenya), Filomena Steady (Sierra Leone), Fatou Sow (Senegal), and Zenebework Tadesse (Ethiopia). Other scholars joined Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era (DAWN), a network for feminist academics and activists focused on the Global South, created in 1984. African scholars among DAWN&#x27;s founding members were Fatema Mernissi (Morocco), Pala Okeyo (Kenya), and Marie-Angélique Savané (Senegal). These scholars inspired a second group of researchers and activists, which included: Rudo Gaidzanwa (Zimbabwe), Ayesha Imam (Nigeria), Patricia McFadden (Eswatini), Amina Mama (Nigeria), Takyiwaa Manuh (Ghana), Maria Nzomo (Kenya), and Charmaine Pereira (Nigeria). The University of Ghana established the Development and Women&#x27;s Studies Program (DAWS) in 1989, which by 1996 offered both undergraduate and graduate level studies. After the demise of Apartheid, the University of Cape Town, South Africa established the African Gender Institute in 1996 to facilitate research and gender studies in Africa. By 2003, full departments dedicated to gender and women&#x27;s studies had also been established at Makerere University (Uganda), the University of Buea (Cameroon), and the University of Zambia (Zambia).

=== Americas ===
The first accredited women&#x27;s studies course in the U.S. was held in 1969 at Cornell University. After a year of intense organizing of women&#x27;s consciousness raising groups, rallies, petition circulating, and operating unofficial or experimental classes and presentations before seven committees and assemblies, the first women&#x27;s studies program in the United States was established in 1970 at San Diego State College (now San Diego State University). In conjunction with National Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement, students and community members created the ad hoc committee for women&#x27;s studies. The second women&#x27;s studies program in the United States was established in 1971 at Wichita State University in Wichita, Kansas. It was mostly formed through many efforts by women in the English department, administration and within the community. By 1974, San Diego State University faculty members began a nationwide campaign for the integration of the department. At the time, these actions and the field were extremely political. Before formalized departments and programs, many women&#x27;s studies courses were advertised unofficially around campuses and taught by women faculty members – without pay – in addition to their established teaching and administrative responsibilities. Then, as in many cases today, faculty who teach in women&#x27;s studies often hold faculty appointments in other departments on campus.

The first scholarly journal in interdisciplinary women&#x27;s studies, &quot;Feminist Studies&quot;, began publishing in 1972. The National Women&#x27;s Studies Association (of the United States) was established in 1977.

In 1977, there were 276 women&#x27;s studies programs nationwide in the United States. The number of programs increased in the following decade, growing up to 530 programs in 1989, which included the program at the University of Puerto Rico founded by Margarita Benítez in 1986. Around the 1980s, universities in the U.S. saw the growth and development of women&#x27;s studies courses and programs across the country while the field continued to grapple with backlash from both conservative groups and concerns from those within the women&#x27;s movement about the white, existentialist, and heterosexual privilege of those in the academy.

In Canada The first few university courses in Women&#x27;s Studies were taught in the early 1970s. In 1984 the federal government established five regional endowed chairs in Women&#x27;s Studies for each region of the country at:
* Simon Fraser University (British Columbia),
* University of Winnipeg and University of Manitoba (Prairies, joint chair)
* Carleton University and the University of Ottawa (Ontario, joint chair),
* Université Laval (Quebec), and
* Mount St Vincent University (Atlantic Canada).

Around the same time, women academics in Latin America began to form women&#x27;s studies groups. The first chair of women&#x27;s studies in Mexico was created in the political and social sciences faculty of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 1970. Starting in 1979, the Grupo Autónomo de Mujeres Universitarias (GAMU, Autonomous Group of University Women), which included both Mexican faculty and students began meeting periodically to discuss how feminism could be introduced to various campuses across the country. In 1982, a women&#x27;s studies program was created at the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana-Xochimilco. Similarly in 1983, activists in the Mexican feminist movement, including Lourdes Arizpe, Flora Botton, and Elena Urrutia, founded the Programa Interdisciplinario de Estudios de la Mujer (PIEG, Interdisciplinary Women&#x27;s Studies Program) at El Colegio de México in Mexico City. In 1984, academics formed the Centro de Estudios de la Mujer (Center for Women&#x27;s Studies) in the psychology faculty at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The field was formalized with the creation of the Programa Universitario de Estudios de Género (PUEG, University Program on Gender Studies) in 1992, at the urging of academics like Gloria Careaga, Teresita de Barbieri, , Araceli Mingo, Lorenia Parada, and Alicia Elena Pérez Duarte.

Activists and researchers in Chile began meeting in 1978 with creation of the Círculo de la Mujer (Women&#x27;s Circle). In 1984, they founded the Centro de Estudios de la Mujer (CEM, Center for Women&#x27;s Studies) in Santiago to facilitate multi-disciplinary studies on women and gender. That same year, Virginia Vargas began teaching women&#x27;s studies in Peru, and the following year, she along with Virginia Guzmán Barcos and others, founded the Flora Tristán Peruvian Women&#x27;s Center. The center provided a research facility for women scholars and provided publishing for their works. From the early 1980s, women like Juanita Barreto Gama, Guiomar Dueñas Vargas, Florence Thomas, Magdalena León Gómez, María Martínez, Donny Meertens, , María Himelda Ramírez and Ana Rico de Alonso worked to create an interdisciplinary field of feminist study in Colombia. First they met informally, then were able to gain official recognition in 1985 as the Grupo de Estudios Mujer y Sociedad (Women &amp; Society Study Group) and finally in 1994, they launched the Programa de Estudios de Género, Mujer y Desarrollo (PGMD, Gender, Women and Development Studies Program) in the Human Sciences Department at the National University of Colombia.

In 1985, activists in Argentina launched the &quot;Introduction to Women&#x27;s Studies&quot; and a post-graduate seminar, &quot;La construcción social del género sexual&quot; (The Social Construction of Sexual Gender) at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1987, María Fernández became the chair of UBA&#x27;s degree program in women&#x27;s studies. In 1992, the Area Interdisciplinaria de Estudios de la Mujer (AIEM, Interdisciplinary Area of Women&#x27;s Studies), which became the Instituto Interdisciplinario de Estudios de Género (Interdisciplinary Institute of Gender Studies) in 1997, was founded at UBA linking academics from the faculties of Arts, Anthropology, Classics and Letters, Education, History, Languages, and Philosophy to encourage broader research and analysis of women in these fields. Hilda Habichayn founded the (Center for Historical Studies on Women), which began in 1993 to offer the first master&#x27;s degree in women&#x27;s studies in Latin America.

The first women&#x27;s study program in Paraguay was the (Paraguayan Center of Women&#x27;s Studies) at the Universidad Católica &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Asunción&quot;. It was founded in 1983 by Olga Caballero, Manuelita Escobar, Marilyn Godoy and Edy Irigoitia. The (GEMPA, Paraguayan Women&#x27;s Studies Group) was founded at the Paraguayan Center for Sociological Studies in 1985 by Graziella Corvalán and Mirtha Rivarola.
Gender studies also began to be established in universities in Brazil in the 1980s and continued expanding throughout the 1990s. In 1992, Brazilian academics at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro launched &quot;Revista Estudos Feministas&quot;, one of the primary academic journals on gender in Brazil.
 Among the contributors for the inaugural issue were , Heloísa Buarque de Hollanda, Maria Carneiro da Cunha, , Rosiska Darcy de Oliveira, Valéria Lamego, Miriam Moreira Leite, Leila Linhares, Heleieth Saffioti, Bila Sorj, and others.

The political aims of the feminist movement that compelled the formation of women&#x27;s studies found itself at odds with the institutionalized academic feminism of the 1990s. As &quot;woman&quot; as a concept continued to be expanded, the exploration of social constructions of gender led to the field&#x27;s expansion into both gender studies and sexuality studies. The field of women&#x27;s studies continued to grow during the 1990s and into the 2000s with the expansion of universities offering majors, minors, and certificates in women&#x27;s studies, gender studies, and feminist studies. The first official PhD program in Women&#x27;s Studies was established at Emory University in 1990. there were 16 institutions offering a PhD in Women&#x27;s Studies in the United States. Since then, UC Santa Cruz (2013), the University of Kentucky-Lexington (2013), Stony Brook University (2014), and Oregon State University (2016) also introduced a PhD in the field.

=== Australia ===
In 1956, Australian feminist Madge Dawson took up a lectureship in the Department of Adult Education at Sydney University and began researching and teaching on the status of women. Dawson&#x27;s course, &quot;Women in a Changing World&quot;, which focused on the socio-economic and political status of women in western Europe, becoming one of the first women&#x27;s studies courses.

===Asia===
==== Central Asia ====
In 2015 at Kabul University, the first master&#x27;s degree course in gender and women&#x27;s studies in Afghanistan began.

=== Europe ===
Elizabeth Bird traced the development of Women&#x27;s Studies in the UK out of informal education run by the women&#x27;s liberation movement (WLM), the Workers&#x27; Educational Association, &quot;CR&quot; or &quot;consciousness raising&quot; groups, left-wing activist groups, and extramural departments attached to universities and colleges. Bird notes that, according to feminist activists and scholars Anna Coote and Beatrix Campbell who interviewed many participants in the 1960s-70s development of women&#x27;s studies, &quot;in the summer of 1969 Juliet Mitchell taught a short course entitled &#x27;The Role of Women in Society&#x27; in the &#x27;Anti University&#x27;, which had been organised by radical academics as part of the student protest movement&quot;. Maggie Humm identifies this summer course as &quot;Britain&#x27;s first women&#x27;s studies course&quot;.

In 1975, Margarita Rendel, Oonagh Hartnett, Zoe Fairbairns, wrote a guide outlining the 17 then-existing undergraduate courses, 1 postgraduate option, four college of education offers and six polytechnics courses in Women&#x27;s Studies – often called &#x27;women in society&#x27; – in the United Kingdom. They compiled the guide from surveys of UK universities and adding to research previously published by Sue Beardon and Erika Stevenson for the National Union of Students in 1974.

A part time postgraduate Diploma in Women&#x27;s Studies was offered by The Polytechnic of Central London from 1977, and in 1978 an MA course on the subject of &#x27;Rights&#x27;, including women&#x27;s rights, was organised by Margarita Rendel at the London Institute of Education.

In 1980, the University of Kent launched the first named MA degree in Women&#x27;s Studies, with Mary Evans leading the development of the course. Following Kent, Bradford (1982), Sheffield City Polytechnic (1983), Warwick (1983) and York (1984) opened MA courses. In 1990, part-time BAs in Women&#x27;s Studies launched at the Polytechnic of North East London and at Preston Polytechnic. Veronica Beechey was recruited by the Open University in 1983 to initiate a women&#x27;s studies course there.

Current courses in Women&#x27;s Studies in the United Kingdom can be found through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service.

== Theoretical traditions and research methods ==

Early women&#x27;s studies courses and curricula were often driven by the question &quot;Why are women not included? Where are the women?&quot;. That is, as more women became more present in higher education as both students and faculty, questions arose about the male-centric nature of most courses and curricula. Women faculty in traditional departments such as history, English, and philosophy began to offer courses with a focus on women. Drawing from the women&#x27;s movement&#x27;s notion that &quot;the personal is political&quot;, courses also began to develop around sexual politics, women&#x27;s roles in society, and the ways in which women&#x27;s personal lives reflect larger power structures.

Since the 1970s, scholars of women&#x27;s studies have taken post-modern approaches to understand gender and its intersections with race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, age, and (dis)ability to produce and maintain power structures within society. With this turn, there has been a focus on language, subjectivity, and social hegemony, and how the lives of subjects, however they identify, are constituted. At the core of these theories is the notion that however one identifies, gender, sex, and sexuality are not intrinsic, but are socially constructed.

Major theories employed in women&#x27;s studies courses include feminist theory, intersectionality, standpoint theory, transnational feminism, and social justice. Research practices associated with women&#x27;s studies place women and the experiences of women at the center of inquiry through the use of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. Feminist researchers acknowledge their role in the production of knowledge and make explicit the relationship between the researcher and the research subject.

=== Feminist theory ===

Feminist theory refers to the body of writing that works to address gender discrimination and disparities, while acknowledging, describing, and analyzing the experiences and conditions of women&#x27;s lives. Theorists and writers such as bell hooks, Simone de Beauvoir, Patricia Hill Collins, and Alice Walker added to the field of feminist theory with respect to the ways in which race and gender mutually inform the experiences of women of color with works such as &quot;Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center&quot; (hooks), &quot;In Search of Our Mothers&#x27; Gardens&quot; (Walker), and &quot;Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment&quot; (Collins). Alice Walker coined the term womanism to situate black women&#x27;s experiences as they struggle for social change and liberation, while simultaneously celebrating the strength of black women, their culture, and their beauty. Patricia Hill Collin&#x27;s contributed the concept of the &quot;matrix of domination&quot; to feminist theory, which reconceptualized race, class, and gender as interlocking systems of oppression that shape experiences of privilege and oppression.
=== Intersectionality ===

Intersectionality is a way of understanding and analyzing the complexity in people, human experiences, and society. Associated with the third wave of feminism, Kimberlé Crenshaw&#x27;s theory of intersectionality has become the key theoretical framework through which various feminist scholars discuss the relationship of between one&#x27;s social and political identities such as gender, race, age, and sexual orientation, and received societal discrimination. Intersectionality posits that these relationships must be considered to understand hierarchies of power and privilege, as well as the effects in which they manifest in an individual&#x27;s life. Though events and conditions of social and political life are often thought to be shaped by one factor, intersectionality theorizes that oppression and social inequality are a result of how powerful individuals view the combination of various factors; emphasizing that discrimination is accounted for by power, not personal identity.

=== Standpoint theory ===

Standpoint theory, also classified as feminist standpoint theory, developed in the 1980s as a way of critically examining the production of knowledge and its resulting effects on practices of power. Standpoint theory operates from the idea that knowledge is socially situated and underrepresented groups and minorities have historically been ignored or marginalized when it comes to the production of knowledge. Emerging from Marxist thought, standpoint theory argues for analysis that challenges the authority of political and social &quot;truths&quot;. Standpoint theory, assumes that power lies solely within the hands of the male gender as the process of decision making in society is constructed exclusively for, and by men. An example of where standpoint theory presents itself in society is through the processes of political analysis, as this field of study is almost entirely controlled by men. Furthermore, from a Marxist viewpoint, Karl Marx had expressed a notion in which believed that those in power have the inability to understand the perspectives of those whom they hold power. Providing that standpoint theory acknowledges the male incapability of understanding the oppression in which women face in society.

=== Transnational feminist theory ===

Transnational feminism is concerned with the flow of social, political, and economic equality of women and men across borders; directly in response to globalization, neoliberalism, and imperialism. Women&#x27;s studies began incorporating transnational feminist theory into its curricula as a way to disrupt and challenge the ways in which knowledge regarding gender is prioritized, transmitted, and circulated in the field and academy. Transnational feminist theory is continually challenging the traditional divides of society, in which are crucial to ongoing politics and cultural beliefs. A key recognition advanced from the transnational feminist perspective is that gender is, has been, and will continue to be, a global effort. Furthermore, a transnational feminist perspective perpetuates that a lack of attention to the cultural and economic injustices of gender, as a result of globalization, may aid in the reinforcing of global gender inequalities; though, this can only come about when one occupies globally privileged subject positions.

=== Social justice ===

Since its inception and connection with the women&#x27;s movement, activism has been a foundation of women&#x27;s studies. Increasingly social justice has become a key component of women&#x27;s studies courses, programs, and departments. Social justice theory is concerned with the fight for just communities, not on the individual level, but for the whole of society. Women&#x27;s studies students engage in social justice projects, although some scholars and critics are concerned about requiring students to engage in both mandated activism and/or social justice work. Women&#x27;s studies not only focus on concepts such as domestic violence, discrimination in the workplace, and gender differences in the division of labor at home, but gives a foundation for understanding the root cause of these concepts, which is the first step to making for a better life for women.

=== Agency ===
Agency may be defined as the capability to make choices individually and freely. An individual&#x27;s agency may be restricted due to various social factors, such as gender, race, religion and social class. From a feminist standpoint, agency may be viewed as an attempt to equalize the one-sided oppression that has characterized first wave feminism. Feminists use agency in attempt to create new forms of autonomy and dependence from the reshaping of gender relations that is taking place in global society. Women&#x27;s studies acknowledges the lack of agency in which women historically possessed, due to hierarchical positions in society. Feminists are actively making an effort to increase gender equality, as it may result in expanding social agency for all women.

=== Materialism ===
Materialist theory derives from 1960s and 1970s social work in feminism. Materialism possesses significant ties to the Marxist theories of history, agency, and ideology; though, may be distinguished through the incorporation of language and culture to its philosophy. Materialism poses questions to both social analytics and social relations, in which may be found in the material conditions of any given society. In addition from examining from a gender standpoint, material conditions are studied in relation to realistic aspects of women&#x27;s lives. A key aspect in which materialist feminists have revealed these relations is from the feminist perspective, claiming that social conditions of gender are historically situated, as well as subjected to intervention and change. Materialist feminism specifically focuses on social arrangements that accentuate the role of women notably the aspects of family, domesticity, and motherhood. Materialism analyzes gendering discourses in which promote women&#x27;s marginalization; Thus, one of the most influential aspects of materialist feminism is its attentiveness with questions of ideology and how they relate to history and agency.

=== Pedagogies ===
In most institutions, women&#x27;s studies courses employ feminist pedagogy in a triad model of equal parts research, theory, and praxis. The decentralization of the professor as the source of knowledge is often fundamental to women&#x27;s studies classroom culture. Students are encouraged to take an active role in &quot;claiming&quot; their education, taking responsibility for themselves and the learning process. Women&#x27;s studies programs and courses are designed to explore the intersectionality of gender, race, sexuality, class and other topics that are involved in identity politics and societal norms through a feminist lens. Women&#x27;s studies courses focus on a variety of topics such as media literacy, sexuality, race and ethnicity, history involving women, queer theory, multiculturalism and other courses closely related. Faculty incorporate these components into classes across a variety of topics, including popular culture, women in the economy, reproductive and environmental justice, and women&#x27;s health across the lifespan.

Women&#x27;s studies programs are involved in social justice work and often design curricula that are embedded with theory and activism outside of the classroom setting. Some women&#x27;s studies programs offer internships that are community-based allowing students the opportunity to experience how institutional structures of privilege and oppression directly affects women&#x27;s lives. Women&#x27;s studies curricula often encourage students to participate in service-learning activities in addition to discussion and reflection upon course materials. However, Daphne Patai, from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, has criticized this aspect of women&#x27;s studies programs, arguing that they place politics over education, stating &quot;the strategies of faculty members in these programs have included policing insensitive language, championing research methods deemed congenial to women (such as qualitative over quantitative methods), and conducting classes as if they were therapy sessions.&quot; Since women&#x27;s studies students analyze identity markers including gender, race, class, and sexuality, this often results in dissecting institutionalized structures of power. As a result of these pedagogies, women&#x27;s studies students leave university with a tool set to make social change and do something about power inequalities in society.

Notable women&#x27;s studies scholars include Charlotte Bunch, Patricia Hill Collins, bell hooks, Angela Davis, Cherríe Moraga, Audre Lorde, Adrienne Rich, and Barbara Ransby.

== Internal academic criticism ==
In the book &quot;Professing Feminism: Education and Indoctrination in Women&#x27;s Studies&quot;, thirty Women&#x27;s Studies academics came together to criticise the &quot;unhealthy conditions and self-destructive tendencies that appear to be intrinsic to many Women&#x27;s Studies programs&quot;. Professors spoke of being unable to &quot;discuss their concerns about this belligerent anti-intellectualism with other faculty members in Women&#x27;s Studies&quot;, with claims of a &quot;constant emphasis on political purity... from both students and professors&quot;.

<text>U.S. Highway 350 (US 350) is a northeast–southwest United States highway located entirely within the state of Colorado.

==Route description==
US 350 starts at a junction with US 160 northeast of Trinidad. The highway runs northeast, past the Perry Stokes Airport and crossing the Purgatoire River. It then continues the rest of its length along a route chosen by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and close to the Mountain Branch of the Santa Fe Trail. The highway passes just northeast of the Piñon Canyon Maneuver Site, then crosses Comanche National Grassland before a junction with SH 71 going north. At La Junta, the highway turns east on 5th Street, then north on Barnes Avenue before ending at a junction with US 50.

==History==

Until the 1990s, US 350 continued into Trinidad, where it intersected with Interstate 25 (I-25). Prior to the creation of I-25, the road terminated at US 85 and US 87.

<doc id="445024" wikidata="Q916937" url="?curid=445024" title="Earl of Airlie">
<text>Earl of Airlie is a title of the peerage in Scotland created on 2 April 1639 for James Ogilvy, 7th Lord Ogilvy of Airlie, along with the title &quot;Lord Ogilvy of Alith and Lintrathen&quot;. The title &quot;Lord Ogilvy of Airlie&quot; was created on 28 April 1491.

In 1715, James Ogilvy, son of the 3rd Earl, took part in a Jacobite uprising against the Crown and was therefore punished by being attainted; consequently, after his father&#x27;s death two years later, he was unable to inherit the title. He was, however, pardoned in 1725. After his death, his brother John was recognised as the Earl; John&#x27;s son David was also attainted, but later pardoned. Then, a cousin also named David Ogilvy claimed the title suggesting that the previous attainders did not affect his succession, but the House of Lords rejected his claim. Parliament later passed an Act completely reversing the attainders; therefore, David Ogilvy was allowed to assume the title. In the list of Earls below, the attainders are therefore disregarded for the purpose of numbering.

The Earl is the Chief of Clan Ogilvy.

The Earl&#x27;s heir apparent uses the title ‘Lord Ogilvy’.

The family seats are Airlie Castle and Cortachy Castle, near Kirriemuir, Angus, Scotland.

==Coat of arms==

The heraldic blazon for the coat of arms of the Earldom is &quot;Argent, a lion passant guardant gules, armed and langued azure, crowned with an imperial crown and collared with an open one, both proper&quot;.;
==Family history==
The family was probably descended from Gillebride, Earl of Angus, who received lands from William the Lion. Sir Walter Ogilvy (died 1440) of Lintrathen, Lord High Treasurer of Scotland from 1425 to 1431, was the Son of Sir Walter Ogilvy of Wester Powrie and Auchterhouse, a man, says Andrew of Wyntoun, &quot;stout and manfull, bauld and wycht&quot;, who was killed in 1392. He built a castle at Airlie in Forfarshire and left two sons. The elder of these, Sir John Ogilvy (D.C 1484), was the father of Sir James Ogilvy (c. 1430–c. 1504), who was made a Lord of Parliament in 1491; and the younger, Sir Walter Ogilvy, was the ancestor of the Earls of Findlater. The Earldom of Findlater, bestowed on James Ogilvy, Lord Ogilvy of Deskford, in 1638, was united in 1711 with the Earldom of Seafield and became dormant after the death of James Ogilvy, the 7th Earl, in October 1811.

Sir James Ogilvy&#x27;s descendant, James Ogilvy, 5th Lord Ogilvy of Airlie (c. 1541–1606), a son of James Ogilvy, master of Ogilvy, who was killed at the Battle of Pinkie in 1547, took a leading part in Scottish politics during the reigns of Mary — Queen of Scotts, and of James VI. In June 1562, the 5th Lord Ogilvy was badly injured in a duel with John Gordon of Findlater in Edinburgh. John Gordon was imprisoned until Ogilvy recovered.

The 5th Lord Ogilvy&#x27;s grandson, James Ogilvy (c. 1593–1666), was created Earl of Airlie and Lord Ogilvy of Alith and Lintrathen by Charles I at York on 2 April 1639. A loyal partisan of the king, he joined Montrose in Scotland in 1644 and was one of the royalist leaders at the Battle of Kilsyth. The destruction of the Earl&#x27;s castles of Airlie and of Forther in 1640 by the Earl of Argyll, who &quot;left him not in all his lands a cock to crow day&quot;, gave rise to the song &quot;The Bonnie House of Airlie&quot;. His eldest son, James, the 2nd Earl (c. 1615–c. 1704) also fought among the royalists in Scotland; in 1644 he was taken prisoner, but he was released in the following year as a consequence of Montrose&#x27;s victory at Kilsyth. He was again a prisoner after the Battle of Philiphaugh and was sentenced to death in 1646, but he escaped from his captivity at St. Andrews and was afterward pardoned. Serving with the Scots against Cromwell, he became a prisoner for the third time in 1651 and was in the Tower of London during most of the years of the Commonwealth. He was a fairly prominent man under Charles II and James II, and in 1689 he ranged himself on the side of William of Orange. Earl&#x27;s grandson, James Ogilvy (d. 1731), took part in the Jacobite rising of 1715 and was attainted; consequently, on his father&#x27;s death in 1717, he was not allowed to succeed to the Earldom, although he was pardoned in 1725. When he died, his brother John (d. 1761) became Earl &quot;de jure&quot;, and John&#x27;s son David (1725–1803) joined the standard of Prince Charles Edward Stuart in 1745. He was attainted, and after the defeat of the prince at Culloden, escaped to Norway and Sweden, afterward serving in the French army, where he commanded &quot;le regiment Ogilvy&quot; and was known as &quot;le bel Ecossais&quot;. In 1778, he was pardoned and was allowed to return to Scotland. His direct line became extinct when his son David died unmarried in April 1812. After this event, David&#x27;s cousin, another David Ogilvy (1785–1849), claimed the Earldom. He asserted that he was unaffected by the two attainders, but the House of Lords decided that these barred his succession. However, in 1826, the attainders were reversed by an act of Parliament, the David Ogilvy Restoration Act 1826 (7 Geo. 4. c. &quot;50&quot;), and David became 6th Earl of Airlie. He died on 20 August 1849 and was succeeded by his son, David Graham Drummond Ogilvy (1826–1881), who was a Scottish representative peer for over thirty years. The latter&#x27;s son, David Stanley William Drummond Ogilvy, the 8th Earl (1856–1900), served in Egypt in 1882 and 1885 and was killed on 11 June 1900, during the Boer War while at the head of his regiment, the 12th Lancers. His titles then passed to his son, David Lyulph Gore Wolseley Ogilvy, the 9th Earl. , the titles are held by his grandson, David John Ogilvy, who succeeded in 2023.

Other noteworthy members of the Ogilvy family were John Ogilvy, also known as &#x27;Powrie Ogilvy&#x27;, a political adventurer who professed to serve King James VI as a spy and who served William Cecil in this capacity. Mariota Ogilvy (d. 1575) was the mistress of Cardinal Beaton. Sir George Ogilvy (d. 1663), a supporter of Charles I during the struggle with the Covenanters, was created a peer as Lord of Banff in 1642; this dignity became dormant or extinct on the death of his descendant, William Ogilvy, the 8th Lord, in June 1803. Sir George Ogilvy of Barras (d. c. 1679) defended Dunnottar Castle against Cromwell in 1651 and 1652 and was instrumental in preventing the regalia of Scotland from falling into his hands. In 1660, he has created a baronet, the title becoming extinct in 1837. Lady Blanche Ogilvy, daughter of the 10th Earl of Airlie, was the mother of Clementine Churchill, the wife of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Sir Angus Ogilvy, son of the 12th Earl, married Princess Alexandra of Kent; their son James is in line to inherit the throne as well as the Earldom, though both somewhat distantly.

The numbering of the titles varies, depending on whether the attainted holders of the Earldom and their successors are counted or not.

<doc id="445032" wikidata="Q215609" url="?curid=445032" title="Icosagon">
<text>In geometry, an icosagon or 20-gon is a twenty-sided polygon. The sum of any icosagon&#x27;s interior angles is 3240 degrees.

==Regular icosagon==

The regular icosagon has Schläfli symbol , and can also be constructed as a truncated decagon, , or a twice-truncated pentagon, .

One interior angle in a regular icosagon is 162°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 18°.

The area of a regular icosagon with edge length is
:formula_1

In terms of the radius of its circumcircle, the area is

:formula_2

since the area of the circle is formula_3 the regular icosagon fills approximately 98.36% of its circumcircle.

==Uses==
The Big Wheel on the popular US game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; has an icosagonal cross-section.

The Globe, the outdoor theater used by William Shakespeare&#x27;s acting company, was discovered to have been built on an icosagonal foundation when a partial excavation was done in 1989.

As a golygonal path, the swastika is considered to be an irregular icosagon.
A regular square, pentagon, and icosagon can completely fill a plane vertex.

===Construction===
As , regular icosagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge, or by an edge-bisection of a regular decagon, or a twice-bisected regular pentagon:

== The golden ratio in an icosagon ==
* In the construction with given side length the circular arc around with radius , shares the segment in ratio of the golden ratio.
:formula_4

== Symmetry==
The &quot;regular icosagon&quot; has symmetry, order 40. There are 5 subgroup dihedral symmetries: , and , and 6 cyclic group symmetries: , and (.

These 10 symmetries can be seen in 16 distinct symmetries on the icosagon, a larger number because the lines of reflections can either pass through vertices or edges. John Conway labels these by a letter and group order. Full symmetry of the regular form is and no symmetry is labeled . The dihedral symmetries are divided depending on whether they pass through vertices ( for diagonal) or edges ( for perpendiculars), and when reflection lines path through both edges and vertices. Cyclic symmetries in the middle column are labeled as for their central gyration orders.

Each subgroup symmetry allows one or more degrees of freedom for irregular forms. Only the subgroup has no degrees of freedom but can be seen as directed edges.

The highest symmetry irregular icosagons are , an isogonal icosagon constructed by ten mirrors which can alternate long and short edges, and , an isotoxal icosagon, constructed with equal edge lengths, but vertices alternating two different internal angles. These two forms are duals of each other and have half the symmetry order of the regular icosagon.

== Dissection==
Coxeter states that every zonogon (a -gon whose opposite sides are parallel and of equal length) can be dissected into parallelograms.
In particular this is true for regular polygons with evenly many sides, in which case the parallelograms are all rhombi. For the icosagon, , and it can be divided into 45: 5 squares and 4 sets of 10 rhombs. This decomposition is based on a Petrie polygon projection of a 10-cube, with 45 of 11520 faces. The list enumerates the number of solutions as 18,410,581,880, including up to 20-fold rotations and chiral forms in reflection.
==Related polygons==
An icosagram is a 20-sided star polygon, represented by symbol . There are three regular forms given by Schläfli symbols: , , and . There are also five regular star figures (compounds) using the same vertex arrangement: , , , , , and .
Deeper truncations of the regular decagon and decagram can produce isogonal (vertex-transitive) intermediate icosagram forms with equally spaced vertices and two edge lengths.

A regular icosagram, , can be seen as a quasitruncated decagon, . Similarly a decagram, has a quasitruncation , and finally a simple truncation of a decagram gives .

==Petrie polygons==
The regular icosagon is the Petrie polygon for a number of higher-dimensional polytopes, shown in orthogonal projections in Coxeter planes:
It is also the Petrie polygon for the icosahedral 120-cell, small stellated 120-cell, great icosahedral 120-cell, and great grand 120-cell.

<doc id="445038" wikidata="Q2665617" url="?curid=445038" title="Canadian Corps">
<text>The Canadian Corps was a World War I corps formed from the Canadian Expeditionary Force in September 1915 after the arrival of the 2nd Canadian Division in France. The corps was expanded by the addition of the 3rd Canadian Division in December 1915 and the 4th Canadian Division in August 1916. The organization of a 5th Canadian Division began in February 1917 but it was still not fully formed when it was broken up in February 1918 and its men used to reinforce the other four divisions.

The majority of soldiers of the Canadian Corps were British-born Canadians until near the end of the war, when the number of those of Canadian birth who had enlisted rose to 51 percent. They were mostly volunteers, as conscription was not implemented until the end of the war (&quot;see&quot; Conscription Crisis of 1917). Ultimately, only 24,132 conscripts made it to France before 11 November 1918. In the later stages of the war the Canadian Corps was regarded by friend and foe alike as one of the most effective Allied military formations on the Western Front.

== History ==

Although the corps was within and under the command of the British Expeditionary Force, understandably there was considerable political pressure in Canada, especially following the Battle of the Somme, in 1916, to have the corps fight as a single unit rather than have the divisions dissipated through the whole army. The corps was commanded by Lieutenant General Sir E.A.H. Alderson, until 1916. Political considerations caused command to be passed to Lieutenant-General Sir Julian Byng. When Byng was promoted to a higher command during the summer of 1917, he was succeeded by General Sir Arthur Currie, the commander of the 1st Division, giving the corps its first Canadian commander. Currie was able to reconcile the desire for national independence with the need for Allied integration. He resisted pressure to replace all British officers in high-ranking positions, retaining those who were successful until they could be replaced by trained and experienced Canadians. British staff officers made up a considerable part of the Corps – although by 1917, 7 of 12 infantry brigades were commanded by Canadians trained during the war, British regulars were the staff officers of the divisions and British officers held two-thirds of senior appointments across the infantry, artillery and Corps headquarters with only four of the most senior appointments being Canadian. Among the British officers were Alan Brooke (at the time a major of the Royal Artillery who planned the artillery barrages for Vimy Ridge and later) and William Ironside. Both eventually became Field Marshals and held the position of Chief of the Imperial General Staff.

The Canadian Corps captured Vimy Ridge in April, 1917, in a daring attack that was a turning point in the war, and as Currie called it, &quot;the grandest day the Corps ever had&quot;. During the German spring offensive of the spring and summer of 1918, the Canadian Corps supported British and French soldiers while they held the Germans back. Between August 8 and 11, 1918, the corps spearheaded the offensive during the Battle of Amiens. Here a significant defeat was inflicted on the Germans, causing the German commander-in-chief, General Erich Ludendorff, to call August 8 &quot;the black day of the German army.&quot; This battle marked the start of the period of the war the French later named &quot;Canada&#x27;s Hundred Days&quot;. After Amiens, the Canadian Corps continued to help lead the vanguard of an Allied push that ultimately ended on 11 November 1918 at Mons where the British Empire had first met in conflict with Imperial German forces in 1914.

At the end of war the Canadian 1st and 2nd Divisions took part in the occupation of Germany and the corps was eventually demobilized in 1919. Upon their return home the veterans were greeted by large and welcoming crowds all across the country. Total fatal battle casualties during the war was 56,638, 13.5% of the 418,052 sent overseas and 9.26% of the 611,711 who enlisted.

== Canadian Corps divisions ==
== Battles ==

Following its formation in late 1915, the Canadian Corps readied to fight major battles as a unified entity, beginning in 1916. Additional actions were fought by one or more units of the corps (&quot;see&quot; separate listings for the divisions, above). Major battles fought by the corps were the following:

=== 1916 ===

* Battle of Mont Sorrel: June 2–13
* Battle of Flers–Courcelette: September 15–22
* Battle of Morval: September 25
* Battle of Thiepval Ridge: September 26–28
* Battle of Le Transloy: October 1–18
* Battle of the Ancre Heights: October 1 – November 11

=== 1917 ===

* Battle of Vimy Ridge: April 9–12
* Battle of Arras (1917): April 9 – May 16, 1917
* Battle of Arleux: April 28–29
* Third Battle of the Scarpe: May 3–4
* Battle of Hill 70: August 15–25
* Second Battle of Passchendaele: October 26 – November 10

=== 1918 ===

* Battle of Amiens: August 8–11
* Second Battle of the Somme: August 21 – September 2
* Battle of the Canal du Nord: September 27 – October 1 (including the capture of Bourlon Wood)
* Battle of Cambrai: October 8–9 (including the Capture of Cambrai)

== Assessment ==

The military effectiveness of the corps has been extensively analyzed. The corps evolved steadily following the 1915 summer campaign. As Godefroy (2006) notes, the Canadian Expeditionary Force &quot;worked ceaselessly to convert all of its available political and physical resources into fighting power.&quot; One striking feature of the corps&#x27; evolution was its unique commitment and ability to exploit all opportunities for learning. This was a corps-wide activity, involving all levels from the commander to the private soldier. This ability to learn from allied successes and mistakes made the corps increasingly successful. Doctrine was tested in limited engagements and, if proven effectual, developed for larger scale battles. Following each engagement, lessons were recorded, analyzed and disseminated to all units. Doctrine and tactics that were ineffective or cost too many lives were discarded and new methods developed. This learning process, combined with technical innovation and competent senior leadership in theatre created one of the most effective allied fighting forces on the Western Front.

== In literature ==

Bartholomew Bandy, hero of The Bandy Papers series of humorous novels by Donald Jack, initially served as an infantry officer in the Canadian Corps before transferring to the Royal Flying Corps.

A large part of Robertson Davies&#x27; 1970 novel &quot;Fifth Business&quot; is devoted to the protagonist&#x27;s experiences as a soldier in the Canadian Corps.

Lucy Maud Montgomery’s novel &quot;Rilla of Ingleside&quot;, (the 8th book in the “Anne of Green Gables” series), is one of the first successful commercial publications focusing on Canadian civilian and soldier World War I experiences. It is the only Canadian novel written of the First World War by a contemporary. It is also one of the first texts to mention the Gallipoli campaign as well as the ANZACs.

<text>Mount Katahdin ( ) is the highest mountain in the U.S. state of Maine at . Named Katahdin, which means &quot;Great Mountain&quot;, by the Penobscot Native Americans, it is within Northeast Piscataquis, Piscataquis County, and is the centerpiece of Baxter State Park. It is a steep, tall massif formed from a granite intrusion weathered to the surface. The flora and fauna on the mountain are typical of those found in northern New England, with the summit hosting fragile and endangered alpine tundra.

Katahdin has been known to the Native Americans in the region for thousands of years and was known to Europeans at least since 1689. It has inspired hikes, climbs, journal narratives, paintings, and a piano sonata. The area around the peak was protected by Governor Percival Baxter starting in the 1930s. Katahdin is the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail and is near a stretch known as the Hundred-Mile Wilderness. Though part of the Appalachian Mountain system, Katahdin is isolated from the range, and sits largely on its own as a monadnock. The nearest higher mountains in any direction are the high peaks of the Presidential Range, around to the south-west.

In 1967, Mount Katahdin was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

The mountain is commonly called just &quot;Katahdin&quot;, though the official name is &quot;Mount Katahdin&quot; as decided by the US Board on Geographic Names in 1893.

==Geology==
Katahdin is part of a laccolith that formed in the Acadian orogeny when an island arc collided with eastern North America approximately 400 million years ago. On the sides of Katahdin are four glacial cirques carved into the granite by alpine glaciers and in these cirques behind moraines and eskers are several ponds.

In Baxter State Park, many outcrops of sedimentary rocks have striations, whereas Katahdin Granite and Traveler Rhyolite lava have weathered surfaces on which striations are commonly not preserved. Bedrock surfaces of igneous rocks which were buried by glacial sediments and only recently exposed have well preserved striations, as in the vicinity of Ripogenus Dam. Several outcrops of sedimentary rocks along the Patten Road show striations, especially on the north side of the road at Hurricane Deck. A few outcrops near the Patten Road just north of Horse Mountain are striated, as are several outcrops of sedimentary rocks along the road from Trout Brook Farm northward to Second Lake Matagamon.

==Fauna==
Fauna include black bear, deer, and moose as well as black flies and mosquitos in the spring. A subspecies of Arctic butterfly, known as the Katahdin Arctic (&quot;Oeneis polixenes katahdin&quot;) is specific to the area, and is currently listed as endangered.
Among the birds are Bicknell&#x27;s thrush and various songbirds and raptors. A study of the animal communities was published by Irving H. Blake in 1926. The flora includes pine, spruce, fir, hemlock, beech, maple, birch, aspen, and pincushion plant (&quot;Diapensia lapponica&quot;).
==Geography==
Katahdin is in Baxter State Park, which is in east central Piscataquis County, about northwest of Millinocket. It is on the drainage divide between the East and West branches of the Penobscot River.

The mountain massif itself consists of multiple peaks. Baxter Peak is the tallest, and is the official northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. South Peak and Pamola Peak are southeast and east of Baxter Peak, respectively, along the Knife Edge ridgeline, while Hamlin Peak lies to the north.

There is low lake country to the south and west of Katahdin, and lowlands extending east to the Atlantic and north to the Saint Lawrence River in Canada.

It is commonly thought that Katahdin is the first place in the United States mainland to receive sunlight in the morning, but this is incorrect. Other mountains lower in elevation but farther to the east or southeast see the first sunrise of the day, depending on the season. Regardless, the summit of Katahdin offers some of the longest unbroken lines of sight in the United States, and on clear days can be seen all the way from the White Mountains of neighboring New Hampshire; a distance of .

Katahdin&#x27;s height and isolation earns it significant coverage in indigenous and post-colonial Maine culture and literature. Katahdin&#x27;s profile is distinctive and the indisputable centerpiece of Baxter State Park. Katahdin and nearby Hamlin Peak are the only two areas to host a subarctic climate and alpine vegetation in Maine. In winter, the snowcapped east and west faces of Katahdin resemble &quot;the Kilimanjaro of New England&quot;, and it dominates the otherwise flat and endless forests of the North Maine Woods. Katahdin is also the northernmost mountain in the eastern United States with an elevation over .

==Climate==
==Human history==
Katahdin is referred to 60 years after Field&#x27;s climb of Agiokochuk (Mount Washington) in the writings of John Gyles, a teenage colonist who was captured near Portland, Maine, in 1689 by the Abenaki. While in the company of Abenaki hunting parties, he traveled up and down several Maine rivers including both branches of the Penobscot, passing close to &quot;Teddon&quot;. He remarked that it was higher than the White Hills above the Saco River.

Among some Native Americans, Katahdin was believed to be the home of the storm god Pamola, and thus an area to be avoided.

The first recorded climb of &quot;Catahrdin&quot; was by Massachusetts surveyors Zackery Adley and Charles Turner, Jr. in August 1804. The letter describing the ascent of Charles Turner Jr. states that they began at the (West Branch Penobscot) at 8:00 a.m. and arrived on the summit at 5:00 p.m. guided by two Native Americans who were initially cautious but when the &quot;cold part of the mountain&quot; was reached and sensing the determination of the others became ambitious to reach the top first. Turner lists his party as: William Howe, Amos Patten, Joseph Treat, Samuel Call, William Rice, Richard Winslow, Charles Turner, Jr. In the 1930s Governor Percival Baxter began to acquire land and finally deeded more than to the State of Maine for a park, named Baxter State Park after him. The summit was officially recognized by the US Board on Geographic Names as &quot;Baxter Peak&quot; in 1931.

In the 1840s Henry David Thoreau climbed Katahdin, which he spelled &quot;Ktaadn&quot;; his ascent is recorded in a well-known chapter of &quot;The Maine Woods&quot;. A few years later Theodore Winthrop wrote about his visit in &quot;Life in the Open Air&quot;. Painters Frederic Edwin Church and Marsden Hartley are well-known artists who created landscapes of Katahdin. On 30 November 2011, Christie&#x27;s auctioned Church&#x27;s 1860 painting &quot;Twilight (Katahdin)&quot; for $3.1 million.

Elizabeth Oakes Smith &quot;climbed Mount Katahdin in 1849—reportedly the first white woman to do so&quot;.

==Recreation opportunities==
As the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail and southern terminus of the International Appalachian Trail, Katahdin is a popular hiking and backpacking destination and the centerpiece of Baxter State Park. Baxter State Park is open year-round, though strictly regulated in winter. The overnight camping season is, weather permitting, from May 15 to October 15 each year, with some campgrounds staying open until October 22. Capacity limits have been placed on day use parking at the trailheads to minimize the overuse of trails.

Mt. Katahdin has several trails leading up to Baxter, Pamola, or Hamlin Peaks These trails start right up the mountain, but each trail on the mountain ends up taking eight to ten hours round-trip depending on ability. Even for experienced hikers, Katahdin is often considered one of the most challenging hikes in the entire Appalachian Mountain range. The rest of the trails go up the north side or west side of the mountain. These are accessed from the Chimney Pond Trail. For these trails, hikers must park at the Roaring Brook Campground and hike in. All trails are maintained by the Baxter State Park Authority, which runs the State Park. All of the trails on the mountain are classified as very strenuous, the highest classification the Park Authority gives, except for Saddle (strenuous), Hamlin Ridge trail (moderate), and Chimney Pond (moderate).

The most famous hike to the summit goes along Knife Edge, a glacial arête which traverses the ridge between Pamola Peak and Baxter Peak. There have been more than 60 deaths on Katahdin since 1933 including October 8 and 9, 2020. The park as a whole typically sees a need for roughly 40 search-and-rescue events per year (1 in 2,000 hikers), with a peak of 70 in 2013. The vast majority of incidents occur in the summer months, and the primary causes are leg injury, exhaustion, dehydration and disorientation. Because of this, Katahdin and not-so-nearby Mount Washington routinely near the top of the most deadly &quot;low mountains&quot; on Earth, with more fatalities per foot of elevation gained than some much higher mountains in the Himalaya.

<text>The Chadian Association of Baptist Churches () (ATEBAM) is an Baptist Christian denomination in Chad. The headquarters is in N&#x27;Djamena.

==History==
The Chadian Association of Baptist Churches has its origins in an American mission of the Baptist Mid-Missions organization in 1925 in Sarh. In the 1930s, a hospital and a Bible college were established in Koumra. In 1964, the association was officially founded.

<doc id="445056" wikidata="Q7621561" url="?curid=445056" title="Stranger on the Shore">
<text>&quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; is a piece for clarinet written by Acker Bilk for his young daughter and originally named &quot;Jenny&quot; after her. The tune was written on a single scrap of paper by Bilk and handed over to arranger Leon Young who crafted the string arrangement, including the characteristic harmonic shifts at the very end.

The recording was subsequently used as the theme tune of a BBC TV drama serial for young people, &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot;. It was first released in 1961 in the UK, and then in the US, and reached number 1 on both the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.

In May 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 took &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; on their mission to the moon. Gene Cernan, a member of the crew, included the tune on a cassette tape used in the command module of the Apollo spacecraft.

==Chart and sales performance==
The track, performed by Acker Bilk (as &quot;Mr. Acker Bilk&quot;) with backing by the Leon Young String Chorale, was recorded at the Lansdowne Studios and produced by Denis Preston with sound engineer Adrian Kerridge. It was released as a single on EMI&#x27;s Columbia label, catalogue number DB 4750, in October 1961; the label text states &quot;Theme from the BBC T.V. Series&quot; as it was used as the theme song to the series &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot;. The UK B-side was &quot;Take My Lips&quot; whereas the US flipside was &quot;Cielito Lindo&quot;. The single became a phenomenal success, topping the &quot;NME&quot; singles chart and spending nearly a year on the &quot;Record Retailer&quot; Top 50. It was the UK&#x27;s biggest-selling single of 1962, the biggest-selling instrumental single of all time, and appears fifty-eighth in the official UK list of best-selling singles issued in 2002. It had sold 1.16 million copies as of November 2012.

One of songwriter and music publisher Robert Mellin&#x27;s major songwriting successes came in 1962, when he wrote lyrics for this song, allowing it to be covered by vocal acts including Andy Williams and the Drifters.

On 26 May 1962, &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; became the first British recording to reach number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 where it was issued by Atlantic Records on the Atco label, but it was quickly followed, on 22 December, by British band The Tornados&#x27; &quot;Telstar&quot;, another instrumental. In the pre-rock era, Vera Lynn&#x27;s &quot;Auf Wiederseh&#x27;n Sweetheart&quot; had reached #1 in 1952, on the shorter &quot;Best Sellers In Stores&quot; survey. After &quot;Telstar&quot;, the next British performers to top the U.S. charts were the Beatles, with their first Capitol Records single &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;. &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; was &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s #1 single of 1962, and it spent seven weeks atop the &quot;Easy Listening&quot; chart, which later became known as the Adult Contemporary chart. The tune became the second of three &quot;one-hit wonders&quot; named &quot;pop single of the year&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot; (the others being 1958&#x27;s &quot;Volare (Nel Blu Dipinto Di Blu)&quot; by Domenico Modugno and 2006&#x27;s &quot;Bad Day&quot; by Daniel Powter).

The song is certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

==Cover versions==
The composition has been covered by many other artists, most prominently a vocal 1962 version by Andy Williams from his album &quot;Warm and Willing&quot;, which reached #9 on the adult contemporary chart, #30 in the UK, and #38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and a group vocal version by the Drifters for their compilation album &quot;Up on the Roof – The Best of the Drifters&quot;, which reached #19 on the adult contemporary chart and #73 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Herb Alpert performed an instrumental cover on his 1987 album &quot;Keep Your Eye on Me&quot;. Kenny G covered the song in 1999 on his album, &quot;Classics in the Key of G.&quot; A version in French, &quot;Savoir Aimer&quot;, was sung by Nana Mouskouri.

==In popular culture==
The song is used as the theme music for the 2003–2013 BBC Radio 4 sketch show &quot;That Mitchell and Webb Sound&quot;.

==Album==
Released in 1961, the original &quot;Stranger on the Shore&quot; album also featured the string arrangements of Leon Young and the performances of his Chorale string players. It primarily consists of melodies from classical, traditional and show music sources, but there is one more original: &quot;Is This the Blues&quot;, also assembled by Young from a Bilk melody.

<doc id="445059" wikidata="Q2126571" url="?curid=445059" title="Henry Lane Wilson">
<text>Henry Lane Wilson (November 3, 1857 – December 22, 1932) was an American attorney, journalist, and diplomat who served successively as United States Minister to Chile (1897–1904), Minister to Belgium (1905–09), and Ambassador to Mexico (1909–13). He is best known to history for his involvement in the February 1913 coup d&#x27;etat which deposed and assassinated President of Mexico Francisco I. Madero, for which he remains controversial and &quot;perhaps the most vilified United States official of [the 20th] century&quot; in Mexico.

Wilson was appointed by President William Howard Taft to the post of United States Ambassador to Mexico in 1910. He brought together opponents of Mexico&#x27;s democratically-elected President Francisco I. Madero in the Pact of the Embassy, colluding with them to stage a coup d&#x27;etat in February 1913. Soon after President Woodrow Wilson took office in March 1913, he was appalled to learn that the American ambassador was involved in the plot in which the president and vice president of Mexico were murdered. President Wilson recalled him from his post as ambassador.

==Biography==
Wilson was born in Crawfordsville, Indiana, to Congressman James Wilson and his wife, Emma Ingersoll. In 1866, his father was appointed to the position of Minister Resident to Venezuela by President Andrew Johnson and served in that role until his death in Caracas, Venezuela, on August 8, 1867. Henry Lane Wilson was a law graduate of Wabash College and practiced law and published a newspaper (the &quot;Lafayette Journal&quot;) in Lafayette, Indiana. He married Alice Vajen in 1885, and moved to Spokane, Washington, where he was in business until he was wiped out financially in the Panic of 1893.

==Diplomatic Service==
Wilson served in the U.S. Foreign Service during the presidencies of William McKinley (1897–1901), Theodore Roosevelt (1901–1909), and William Howard Taft (1909–1913), and briefly under Woodrow Wilson. He was appointed Minister to Chile in 1897, remaining in that capacity until 1904, when he was made Minister to Belgium, serving in Brussels during the height of the Congo Free State controversy.

Wilson was appointed Ambassador to Mexico by President Taft on December 21, 1909. At the time it was the only diplomatic post with the rank of ambassador. He presented his credentials to President Porfirio Diaz on March 5, 1910. Wilson arrived in Mexico following the fraudulent elections that kept Díaz in office; he had been continuously elected since 1884. A liberal general who came to power initially by coup in 1876, Díaz had opened Mexico to foreign investment and development of infrastructure, with U.S. business interests investing capital in the petroleum industry, mining, ranching and agriculture. From the U.S. government and business perspective, the stability of Díaz&#x27;s authoritarian government brought stability and material progress to Mexico while generating huge profits to foreign interests. However, in 1910, there was a serious challenger to Díaz, now 80 years old. Francisco I. Madero, the scion of a rich, landowning family in northern Mexico, brought together a broad coalition of Mexicans opposed to Díaz. Rebels in northern Mexico and in the state of Morelos put pressure on Díaz, who resigned. An interim government was established, and Madero was elected president in November 1911. From the start, Ambassador Wilson was critical of President Madero and worked to promote U.S. interests, ultimately involving, or even spearheading, the coup that ousted Madero in February 1913.

== Coup against Madero ==

When Díaz was forced to resign in 1911, his Mexican political supporters and the foreign powers and businesses that had benefited from his policies regarding investments saw that the new president was unable to effectively lead. Wilson was &quot;a natural ally of reactionary elements including U.S. and Mexican business interests, the Catholic Church, and eventually high-ranking members of the federal army&quot;. Wilson was a master manipulator of information and disinformation, which helped amplify the Mexican public&#x27;s and foreign powers&#x27; perceptions that Madero was a naïve bungler, opposed to the interests of the U.S. He had direct contacts with the Associated Press, which conveyed news about Mexico to the U.S. and the English-language &quot;Mexico City Herald&quot;, whose American readership became increasingly unsettled by their coverage of the Madero government. 

The coup d&#x27;état of General Victoriano Huerta, Felix Díaz, and General Bernardo Reyes against Madero was launched in February 1913, now known as the Ten Tragic Days. Mexico City was the site of armed violence between those supporting Madero and the rebels. The violence was the culmination of the psychological campaign that prepared those disposed to believe Madero an incapable leader to welcome his forced resignation. Although the Pact of the Embassy was to have a power-sharing arrangement between the leaders of the Mexican coup and the U.S., Huerta seized power once events were underway. The murders of Madero and his vice president were not explicitly part of the Pact of the Embassy. There was enough plausible deniability for Wilson and the Department of State to escape sanctions, but in Mexico, they are considered culpable for their deaths. Wilson was purported to even have assisted in arranging the murder of Madero&#x27;s brother, Gustavo A. Madero, all of which was later disputed by Wilson.

In a 1916 interview with American journalist Robert Hammond Murray, Madero&#x27;s widow, Sara Pérez Romero de Madero, described an audience she had with the U.S. ambassador during her husband&#x27;s captivity. Wilson refused to use his influence to save the president&#x27;s life, telling her, &quot;I will be honest with you, Madam. Your husband&#x27;s fall is because he never agreed to consult me. You know your husband had very peculiar ideas.&quot; According to Pérez, Wilson claimed that unlike Madero, Huerta did consult him as to what to do with the president and vice president, to which he answered to &quot;do what is best for the interests of the nation&quot;.

After the inauguration of President Woodrow Wilson on March 4, 1913, he was informed of events in Mexico by a special agent, William Bayard Hale. The new president was appalled by Henry Lane Wilson&#x27;s role in the coup against Madero. Hale reported that &quot;Madero would never have been assassinated had the American Ambassador made it thoroughly understood that the plot must stop short of murder&quot;, and accused Henry Lane Wilson of &quot;treason, perfidy and assassination in an assault on constitutional government&quot;. The President sought information independent of that provided by Henry Lane Wilson by sending John Lind, the former governor of Minnesota, to Mexico as his personal envoy. On July 17, 1913, the president dismissed Ambassador Wilson. The ambassador advocated for the diplomatic recognition of General Huerta&#x27;s government, which the new U.S. president refused to do, providing an opening for forces opposed to Huerta&#x27;s government to rise in armed rebellion. 

In his memoirs published in 1927, the former ambassador criticized Madero&#x27;s character and intelligence, without making mention of his own role in the Pact of the Embassy and the coup against the Mexican president:
 Madero was a person of unsound intellect, of imperfect education and vision. He was a disciple in the least the deep of the French school in politics and economics, but never gathered for the uses of practical application its threads of philosophy or comprehended the deep common sense which lies at the root of all French political opinion. He came into power as an apostle of liberty but he was simply a man of disoriented intellect who happened to be in the public eye at the psychological moment. the responsibilities of office and the disappointments growing out of rivalries and intrigues shattered his reason completely, and in the last days of his government, during the bombardment of the capital, his mental qualities always abnormal, developed into a homicidal, dangerous form of lunacy...

==Post-government activities==
During World War I, Wilson served on the Commission for Relief in Belgium and, in 1915, accepted the chairmanship of the Indiana State Chapter of the League to Enforce Peace, a position he held until his resignation over U.S. involvement in the League of Nations after the close of the war. Wilson was a member of Sons of the American Revolution, Society of Colonial Wars, and the Loyal Legion. He published his memoir in 1927 and died in Indianapolis in 1932. He is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery, Indianapolis.

<doc id="445066" wikidata="Q372514" url="?curid=445066" title="RoboCop">
<text>RoboCop is a 1987 American science fiction action film directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. The film stars Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, Daniel O&#x27;Herlihy, Ronny Cox, Kurtwood Smith, and Miguel Ferrer. Set in a crime-ridden Detroit in the near future, &quot;RoboCop&quot; centers on police officer Alex Murphy (Weller) who is murdered by a gang of criminals and revived by the megacorporation Omni Consumer Products as the cyborg law enforcer RoboCop. Unaware of his former life, RoboCop executes a campaign against crime while coming to terms with the lingering fragments of his humanity.

The film was conceived by Neumeier while working on the set of &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982), and he developed the idea with Miner. Their script was purchased in early 1985 by producer Jon Davison on behalf of Orion Pictures. Finding a director proved difficult; Verhoeven dismissed the script twice because he did not understand its satirical content, until he was convinced of its value by his wife. Filming took place between August and October 1986, mainly in Dallas, Texas. Rob Bottin led the special-effects team in creating practical effects, violent gore and the RoboCop costume.

Verhoeven emphasized violence throughout the film, making it so outlandish that it became comical. Censorship boards believed that it was too extreme and several scenes were shortened or modified to receive an acceptable theatrical rating. &quot;RoboCop&quot; was a financial success upon its release in July 1987, earning $53.4million. Reviewers praised it as a clever action film with deeper philosophical messages and satire, but were conflicted about its extreme violence. The film was nominated for several awards, and won an Academy Award and a number of Saturn Awards.

&quot;RoboCop&quot; has been critically reevaluated since its release, and it has been hailed as one of the best films of the 1980s and one of the greatest science fiction and action films ever made. The film has been praised for its depiction of a robot affected by the loss of humanity, in contrast to the stoic and emotionless robotic characters of that era. &quot;RoboCop&quot; has continued to be analyzed for its themes such as the nature of humanity, personal identity, corporate greed and corruption, and is seen as a rebuke of the era&#x27;s Reaganomics policies. Its success created a franchise: the sequels &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; (1990) and &quot;RoboCop 3&quot; (1993), children&#x27;s animated series, live-action television shows, video games, comic books, toys, clothing and other merchandise. A remake was released in 2014.

== Plot ==

In a near-future dystopia, Detroit is on the brink of social and financial collapse. Overwhelmed by crime and dwindling resources, the city grants the mega-corporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP) control of the Detroit Police Department. OCP senior president Dick Jones demonstrates ED-209, a law-enforcement droid designed to supplant the police. ED-209 malfunctions and brutally kills a volunteer, allowing ambitious junior executive Bob Morton to introduce OCP&#x27;s chairman (&quot;the Old Man&quot;) to his own project: RoboCop.

Meanwhile, police officer Alex Murphy is transferred to the Metro West precinct. Murphy and his new partner, Anne Lewis, pursue notorious criminal Clarence Boddicker and his gang: Emil Antonowsky, Leon Nash, Joe Cox, and Steve Minh. The gang ambushes and tortures Murphy until Boddicker fatally shoots him. Morton has Murphy&#x27;s corpse converted into RoboCop, a heavily armored cyborg with no memory of his former life. RoboCop is programmed with three prime directives: serve the public trust, protect the innocent, and uphold the law. A fourth prime directive, Directive 4, is classified.

Assigned to Metro West, RoboCop is hailed by the media for his brutally efficient campaign against crime. Lewis suspects that he is Murphy, recognizing the unique way he holsters his gun (a trick Murphy learned to impress his son). After experiencing a nightmare of Murphy&#x27;s death during maintenance, RoboCop encounters Lewis, who addresses him as Murphy. While on patrol, RoboCop arrests Emil, who recognizes Murphy&#x27;s mannerisms, which furthers RoboCop&#x27;s recall. RoboCop then uses the police database to identify Emil&#x27;s associates and review Murphy&#x27;s police record. He recalls further memories while exploring Murphy&#x27;s former home, his wife and son having moved away after his death.

Elsewhere, Jones gets Boddicker to murder Morton as revenge for Morton&#x27;s attempt to usurp his position at OCP. RoboCop tracks down Boddicker&#x27;s gang. After a shootout, RoboCop brutally interrogates Boddicker until he admits to working for Jones. He cannot kill Boddicker as that would violate his prime directives. RoboCop attempts to arrest Jones at the OCP Tower, but Directive 4 is activated: a fail-safe measure to neutralize RoboCop when he acts against an OCP executive. Jones admits his culpability in Morton&#x27;s death and releases an ED-209 to destroy RoboCop. Although he escapes, RoboCop is attacked by the police force on OCP&#x27;s order and is badly damaged. He is rescued by Lewis, who brings him to an abandoned steel mill to repair himself.

Angered by OCP&#x27;s underfunding and short-staffing, the police force goes on strike; Detroit descends into chaos as riots break out throughout the city. Jones frees Boddicker and his remaining gang, arming them with high-powered weaponry to destroy RoboCop. Boddicker&#x27;s men are quickly eliminated at the steel mill, but Lewis is badly injured; RoboCop, trapped under steel girders, kills Boddicker by stabbing him in the throat. RoboCop confronts Jones at the OCP Tower during a board meeting, revealing the truth behind Morton&#x27;s murder. Jones takes the Old Man hostage, but the Old Man fires Jones, nullifying Directive 4. RoboCop shoots Jones, causing him to crash through a window to his death. The Old Man compliments RoboCop&#x27;s shooting and asks his name. He replies, &quot;Murphy.&quot;

Smith&#x27;s partner, Joan Pirkle, appears as Dick Jones&#x27;s secretary.

== Production ==
=== Conception and writing ===
&quot;RoboCop&quot; was conceived in the early 1980s by Universal Pictures junior story executive and aspiring screenwriter Edward Neumeier. A fan of robot-themed science-fiction films, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and action films, Neumeier had developed an interest in mature comic books while researching them for potential adaptation. The 1982 science-fiction film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; was filming on the Warner Bros. lot behind Neumeier&#x27;s office, and he unofficially joined the production to learn about filmmaking. His work there gave him the idea for &quot;RoboCop&quot;: &quot;I had this vision of a far-distant, &quot;Blade Runner&quot;–type world where there was an all-mechanical cop coming to a sense of real human intelligence&quot;. He spent the next few nights writing a 40-page outline.

While researching story submissions for Universal, Neumeier came across a student video by aspiring director Michael Miner. The pair met and discussed their similar concepts: Neumeier&#x27;s &quot;RoboCop&quot; and Miner&#x27;s robot-themed rock music video. In a 2014 interview, Miner said that he also had an idea called &quot;SuperCop&quot;. They formed a working partnership and spent about two months discussing the idea and two to three months writing together at night and over weekends, in addition to their regular jobs. Their collaboration was initially difficult because they did not know each other well, and had to learn how to constructively criticize each other.

Neumeier was influenced to kill off his main character early by the psychological horror film &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960), whose main character is killed early in the film. Inspired by comic books and his experience with corporate culture, Neumeier wanted to satirize 1980s business culture. He noted the increasing aggression of American financial services in response to growing Japanese influence and the popularity on Wall Street of &quot;The Book of Five Rings&quot;, a 17th-century book about how to kill more effectively. Neumeier also believed that Detroit&#x27;s declining automobile industry was due to increased bureaucracy. ED-209&#x27;s malfunction in the OCP boardroom was based on Neumeier&#x27;s office daydreams about a robot bursting into a meeting and killing everyone. Miner described the film as &quot;comic relief for a cynical time&quot; during the presidency of Ronald Reagan, when economist &quot;Milton Friedman and the Chicago Boys ransacked the world, enabled by Reagan and the Central Intelligence Agency. So when you have this cop who works for a corporation that insists &#x27;I own you,&#x27; and he still does the right thing—that&#x27;s the core of the film.&quot; Neumeier and Miner conceived the in-universe news and advertisement &quot;Media Breaks&quot; that appear throughout &quot;RoboCop&quot;, and a spec script was completed by December 1984.

=== Development ===

The first draft of the script, &quot;RoboCop: The Future of Law Enforcement&quot;, was given to industry friends and associates in early 1985. A month later, Neumeier and Miner had two offers: one from Atlantic Releasing and another from director Jonathan Kaplan and producer Jon Davison with Orion Pictures. An experienced producer of exploitation and B films such as the parody &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), Davison said that he was drawn to the script&#x27;s satire. He showed Neumeier and Miner films—including &quot;Madigan&quot; (1968), &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; (1971), and &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; (1981)—to demonstrate the tone he wanted. After Orion greenlit the project, Neumeier and Miner began a second draft.

Davison produced the film with his Tobor Pictures company. Neumeier and Miner were paid a few thousand dollars for the script rights and $25,000 between them for the rewrite. They were entitled to eight percent of the producer profits upon release. Davison&#x27;s contacts with puppeteers, animators, and practical effects designers were essential to Verhoeven, who had no prior experience with them. The producers discussed changing the Detroit setting, but Neumeier insisted on its importance because of its failing auto industry. The connection between Clarence Boddicker and Dick Jones was added at Orion&#x27;s suggestion.

Kaplan left to direct &quot;Project X&quot; (1987), and finding his replacement took six months; many prospects declined because of the film&#x27;s title. The project was offered to David Cronenberg, Alex Cox, and Monte Hellman; Hellman joined as second-unit director. Miner asked to direct, but Orion refused to trust a $7million project to an untested director. He declined the second-unit director position in order to direct &quot;Deadly Weapon&quot; (1989); Orion executive Barbara Boyle suggested Paul Verhoeven—who had been praised for his work on &quot;Soldier of Orange&quot; (1977) and his first English-language film, &quot;Flesh+Blood&quot; (1985)—for director. Verhoeven looked at the first page and rejected the script as awful, stalling the project. Boyle sent Verhoeven another copy, suggesting that he pay attention to the subtext. Verhoeven was still uninterested until his wife Martine read it and encouraged him to give it a chance, saying he had missed the &quot;soul&quot; of the story about someone losing his identity. Not fluent in English, Verhoeven said that the satire did not make sense to him; the scene that attracted his attention was RoboCop returning to Murphy&#x27;s abandoned home and experiencing memories of his former life.

Davison, Neumeier and Verhoeven discussed the project at Culver Studios&#x27; Mansion House. Verhoeven wanted to direct it as a serious film; Neumeier gave him comic books to explain the tone they wanted, including &quot;2000 AD&quot; with the character Judge Dredd. Neumeier and Miner wrote a third draft based on Verhoeven&#x27;s requests, working through injuries and late nights; the 92-page revision included a subplot about a romantic affair between Murphy and Lewis. After reading it, Verhoeven admitted that he was wrong and returned to the second draft in search of a comic-book tone.

=== Casting ===

Six to eight months were spent searching for an actor to play Alex Murphy / RoboCop. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Ironside, Rutger Hauer, Tom Berenger, Armand Assante, Keith Carradine and James Remar were considered. Orion favored Schwarzenegger, the star of their recent success &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), but he and other actors were considered too physically imposing to be believable in the RoboCop costume; it was thought that Schwarzenegger would look like the Michelin Man or the Pillsbury Doughboy. Others were reluctant because their face would be largely concealed by a helmet. Davison said that Weller was the only person who wanted to be in the film. The low salary he commanded was in his favor, as were his good body control from martial-arts training and marathon running and his fan base in the science-fiction genre after his performance in &quot;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension&quot; (1984). Verhoeven said he hired him because &quot;his chin was very good&quot;. Weller spent months working with mime Moni Yakim, developing a fluid movement style with a stiff ending while wearing an American football uniform to approximate the finished costume. Weller said that working with Verhoeven was his main reason for choosing the role over appearing in &quot;King Kong Lives&quot; (1986).

Stephanie Zimbalist was cast as Murphy&#x27;s partner Anne Lewis, but dropped out because of contractual obligations to &quot;Remington Steele&quot; (which had been canceled in 1986, but was revived because of its popularity). Her replacement, Nancy Allen, thought the film&#x27;s title was terrible but found the script engrossing. Allen was known for her long blonde hair, but Verhoeven wanted it cut short so the character was not sexualized. Her hair was cut eight times before the desired look was achieved. Allen undertook police-academy training for her role, and sought advice from her police lieutenant father. Verhoeven encouraged her to act masculine and gain weight, which she accomplished by quitting smoking.

Kurtwood Smith auditioned for Boddicker and Jones. He was known mainly for television work, but had not had film success, and saw &quot;RoboCop&quot; as a B-film with potential. The character was scripted to wear glasses so he would look like Nazi Party member Heinrich Himmler. Smith was unaware of this, and interpreted it as the character having an intelligent and militaristic front to conceal being a &quot;sneering, smirking drug kingpin&quot;. Ironside was offered the role, but did not want to be involved with another special effects-laden film or play a &quot;psychopath&quot; after working on &quot;Extreme Prejudice&quot; (1987). Robert Picardo also auditioned for the role.

Ronny Cox had been stereotyped as playing generally nice characters, and said that this left the impression that he could not play more masculine roles. Because of this, Verhoeven cast him as the villainous Dick Jones. Cox said that playing a villain was &quot;about a gazillion times more fun than playing the good guys&quot;. Jones, he said, has no compassion and is an &quot;evil [son of a bitch]&quot;. Miguel Ferrer was unsure if the film would be successful, but was desperate for work and would have accepted any offer. The Old Man was based on MCA Inc. CEO Lew Wasserman, whom Neumeier considered a powerful and intimidating individual. Television host Bixby Snyder was written as an Americanized, more-extreme version of British comedian Benny Hill. Radio personality Howard Stern was offered an unspecified role, but turned it down because he thought the idea was stupid (although he later praised the finished film).

=== Filming ===

Principal photography began on August 6, 1986, on an $11million budget. Jost Vacano was the cinematographer, after working with Verhoeven on &quot;Soldier of Orange&quot;. Verhoeven wanted &quot;Blade Runner&quot; production designer Lawrence G. Paull, but Davison said he could afford either a great production designer or a great RoboCop costumenot both. William Sandell was hired. Monte Hellman directed several of the action scenes.

&quot;RoboCop&quot; was filmed primarily on location in Dallas, with additional filming in Las Colinas and Pittsburgh. Verhoeven wanted a filming location which suggested the near future. Detroit was dismissed because it had many low buildings, many brownstones and Victorian-style buildings. Neumeier said that it was also a union city, making it more expensive to film there. Detroit made a brief appearance in nighttime, stock aerial footage at the beginning of the film. Chicago was dismissed for aesthetic reasons, New York City for high costs, and California because according to Davison, Orion wanted to distance itself from the project. Dallas was chosen over Houston because it has modern buildings and older, less-maintained areas where explosives could be used. The filming schedule in Dallas was nine weeks, but it soon became clear that it would take longer. Based on filmed footage, Orion approved the schedule extension and a budget increase to $13.1million. The weather fluctuated during filming; Dallas in summer was often , and the weather in Pittsburgh was frigid.

RoboCop&#x27;s costume was not finished until some time into filming. This did not impact the shooting schedule, but it denied Weller the month of costume rehearsal he had expected. Weller was frustrated with the costume; it was too cumbersome for him to move as he had practiced, and he spent hours trying to adapt. He struggled to see through the thin helmet visor and interact with (or grab) objects while wearing the gloves. Weller fell out with Verhoeven and was fired, with Lance Henriksen considered as a replacement; because the costume was designed for Weller, however, he was encouraged to mend fences. Mime Moni Yakim helped Weller to develop a slower, more deliberate way of moving. Weller&#x27;s experience in the costume was worsened by the warm weather, which made him sweat off up to per day. Verhoeven began taking prescription medication to cope with stress-induced insomnia, and he filmed scenes under the influence.
He often choreographed scenes with the actors before filming. Improvisation was also encouraged, because Verhoeven believed that it could produce interesting results. Smith improvised some of his character&#x27;s quirks, such as sticking chewing gum to a secretary&#x27;s desk and spitting blood onto the police-station counter: What if I spat blood on the desk?&#x27;... [Verhoeven] got this little smile on his face, and we did it.&quot; Neumeier was on set throughout filming and occasionally wrote additional scenes, including a New Year&#x27;s Eve party after seeing some party-hat props and a news story about the Strategic Defense Initiative platform misfiring. Verhoeven found Neumeier&#x27;s presence invaluable, because they could discuss how to adapt the script or location to make a scene work.

Verhoeven gained a reputation for verbal aggression and unsociable behavior on set; Smith said that he never yelled at the actors, however, but was too engrossed in filming to be sociable. Cox and Allen spoke warmly of Verhoeven. Weller spent his time between filming with the actors who played his enemies (including Smith, Ray Wise and Calvin Jung), who maintained healthy lifestyles that supported Weller in his training for the New York City Marathon.

A number of locations in and around Dallas were used in production. An office in Renaissance Tower was used for the OCP interior of; the company&#x27;s exterior is Dallas City Hall, modified with matte paintings to appear taller. The OCP elevator was that of the Plaza of the Americas. The Detroit police station&#x27;s exterior is Crozier Tech High School; its interior is the Sons of Hermann hall, and city hall is the Dallas Municipal Building. Scenes of Boddicker&#x27;s gang blowing up storefronts were filmed in the Deep Ellum neighborhood. One explosion was larger than anticipated; actors can be seen moving out of the way, Smith had to remove his coat because it was on fire, and the actors involved received an additional $400 in stunt pay. The Shell gas station that explodes was in the Arts District, where local residents unaware of the filming called the fire department. The scene was scripted for flames to modify the sign to read &quot;hell&quot;; Davison approved it, but it does not appear in the film. Miner called it a disappointing omission.

The nightclub was the former Starck Club. Verhoeven was filmed demonstrating how the clubbers should dance, and used the footage in the film. Other Dallas locations included César Chávez Boulevard, the Reunion Arena and the parking lot of the Crescent. The final battle between RoboCop and Boddicker&#x27;s gang was filmed at a steel mill in Monessen, outside Pittsburgh. Filming ended in late October 1986.
=== Post-production ===

An additional $600,000 budget increase was approved by Orion for post-production and the music score, raising the budget to $13.7million.

Frank J. Urioste was the film&#x27;s editor. Several pick-up shots were filmed during this phase, including Murphy&#x27;s death, RoboCop removing his helmet, and shots of his leg holster. After the OCP boardroom scene in which RoboCop calls himself Murphy, another scene revealed that Lewis was alive in a hospital before showing RoboCop on patrol. The latter scene was thought to lessen the former&#x27;s triumphant feeling, and was removed. Verhoeven wanted the in-film Media Breaks to abruptly interrupt the narrative and unsettle the viewer. He was influenced by Piet Mondrian&#x27;s art, which featured stark black lines separating colored squares. Peter Conn directed many of the Media Breaks, but &quot;TJ Lazer&quot; was directed by Neumeier.

&quot;RoboCop&quot;″s violent content made it difficult to receive an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), which restricted the film to viewers over 17 unless accompanied by an adult. It initially received the more-restrictive X rating, limiting the film to those over 17. Although some reports suggest it was refused an R-rating eleven times, Verhoeven said that the number was actually eight. The MPAA took issue with several scenes, including Murphy&#x27;s death and ED-209 shooting an executive. The violent scenes were shortened and Media Breaks were added to help lighten the mood; Verhoeven recalled that one reviewer was confused by their jarring appearance in the film, and complained that the projectionist had used the wrong film reel.

The MPAA also objected to a scene of a mutated Emil being disintegrated by Boddicker&#x27;s car, but Verhoeven, Davison and Orion refused to remove it because it consistently received the biggest laughs during test screenings. Verhoeven made the violence comical and surreal, and believed that the cuts made the scenes appear more (not less) violent. He said that his young children laughed at the X-rated cut, and audiences laughed less at the R-rated version. According to Verhoeven, people &quot;love seeing violence and horrible things&quot;. The film is 103 minutes long.

Basil Poledouris composed the film score after working with Verhoeven on &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot;. The score combines synthesizers and orchestral music, reflecting RoboCop&#x27;s cyborg nature. The music was performed by the Sinfonia of London.

==Special effects and design==

===Special effects===
The special-effects team, led by Rob Bottin, included Phil Tippett, Stephan Dupuis, Bart Mixon and Craig Davies. The effects were very violent because Verhoeven believed that that made scenes funnier. He compared the brutality of Murphy&#x27;s death to the crucifixion of Jesus, an effective way to evoke sympathy for the character. The scene was filmed at an abandoned auto-assembly plant in Long Beach, California, on a raised stage that allowed operators to control the effects from below. To show Murphy being dismantled by gunfire, prosthetic arms were cast in alginate and filled with tubing that could pump artificial blood and compressed air. Weller&#x27;s left hand, attached to his shoulders by velcro and controlled by three operators, was designed to explode in a controllable way so it could be easily put back together for repeat shots. The right arm was jerked away from Weller&#x27;s body by a monofilament wire. A detailed, articulated replica of Weller&#x27;s upper body was used to depict Boddicker shooting Murphy through the head. A mold was made of Weller&#x27;s face using foam latex that was baked to make it rubbery and flesh-like, and placed over a fiberglass skull containing a blood squib and explosive charge. The articulated head was controlled by four puppeteers, and had details of sweat and blood. A fan motor attached to the body made it vibrate, as if shaking in fear. The charge in the skull was connected to the trigger of Smith&#x27;s gun by wire to synchronize the effect.

Emil&#x27;s melting condition was inspired by the 1977 science-fiction film &quot;The Incredible Melting Man&quot;. Bottin designed and constructed Emil&#x27;s prosthetics, creating a foam-latex headpiece and matching gloves that gave the appearance of Emil&#x27;s skin melting &quot;off his bones like marshmallow sauce&quot;. A second piece, depicting further degradation, was applied over the first. Dupuis painted each piece differently to emphasize Emil&#x27;s advancing degradation. The prosthetics were applied to an articulated dummy to show Emil being struck by Boddicker&#x27;s car. The head was loosened so it would fly off; by chance, it rolled onto the car&#x27;s hood. The effect was completed with Emil&#x27;s liquified body (raw chicken, soup, and gravy) washing over the windscreen. The same dummy stands in for RoboCop when he is crushed by steel beams (painted wood). Verhoeven wanted RoboCop to kill Boddicker by stabbing him in the eye, but it was believed the effort to create the effect would be wasted due to censorship concerns.

Dick Jones&#x27;s fatal fall is shown by a stop-motion puppet of Cox, animated by Rocco Gioffre. The limited development time forced Gioffre to use a foam-rubber puppet with an aluminum skeleton instead of a better-quality, articulated version. It was composited against Mark Sullivan&#x27;s matte painting of the street below. ED-209&#x27;s murder of OCP executive Mr. Kinney was filmed over three days. Kevin Page&#x27;s body was covered with 200 squibs, but Verhoeven was unhappy with the result and brought him back months later to re-shoot it in a studio-built recreation of the board room. Page was again covered in over 200 squibs and plastic bags filled with spaghetti squash and fake blood. Page described intense pain as each squib detonation felt like a punch. In the cocaine-warehouse scene, Boddicker&#x27;s stuntman was thrown through glass panes rigged with detonating cord to shatter microseconds before he hit. Gelatin capsules filled with sawdust and a sparkling compound were fired from an air gun at RoboCop to create the effect of ricocheting bullets.

===RoboCop===

Bottin was tasked with designing the RoboCop costume. He researched the &quot;Star Wars&quot; character C-3PO and its stiff costume, which made movement difficult. Bottin was also influenced by robot designs in &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927), &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951), and several comic-book superheroes. He developed about 50 designs based on feedback from Verhoeven (who pushed for a more machine-like character), before settling on a sleek aesthetic inspired by the work of Japanese illustrator Hajime Sorayama. Verhoeven admitted his unrealistic expectations after reading Japanese science-fiction manga; it took him a while to realize it, which contributed to the costume delay.

The scope of the RoboCop costume was unprecedented, with its design and construction exceeding cost and schedule. The costume took six months to build with flexible foam latex, semi-and completely-rigid polyurethane, and a fiberglass helmet. Moving sections were joined with aluminum and ball bearings. The costume is supported by an internal harness of hooks, allowing for sustained movement during action scenes. Seven costumes were made, including a fireproof version and costumes depicting sustained damage. Reports on their weight vary from . RoboCop&#x27;s gun, the Auto-9, is a Beretta 93R with an extended barrel and larger grip. It was modified to fire blank bullets, and vents were cut into the side to allow for multi-directional muzzle flashes with every three-shot burst.

===ED-209===
To budget for ED-209&#x27;s development, Tippett developed preliminary sketches and hired Davies to design the full-scale model which was constructed with the help of Paula Lucchesi. Verhoeven wanted ED-209 to look mean, and thought that Davies&#x27; early designs lacked a &quot;killer&quot; aesthetic. Davies was influenced by killer whales and a United States Air Force LTV A-7 Corsair II. He approached the design with modern American aesthetics and a corporate-design policy that he believed prioritized looks over functionality, including excessive and impractical components. He did not add eyes, thinking that they would make ED-209 more sympathetic. The fully-articulated fiberglass model took four months to build, cost $25,000, stood tall, and weighed . The 100-hour work weeks took their toll and Davies minimized the detail of ED-209&#x27;s feet, since he did not think they would be shown. The model was later used on promotional tours.

Davies spent another four months building two miniature replicas for stop motion animation. The two small models allowed scenes to be animated and filmed more efficiently, which saved time in completing the 55 shots needed in three months. Tippett was the lead ED-209 animator, assisted by Randal M. Dutra and Harry Walton. Tippett conceived ED-209&#x27;s movement as &quot;unanimal&quot;-like, as if it were about to fall over before catching itself. To complete the character, the droid was given the roar of a leopard. Davison provided a temporary voiceover for ED-209&#x27;s speaking voice, which was retained in the film.

===Other effects and designs===
&quot;RoboCop&quot; contains seven matte effects, mainly painted by Gioffre. Each matte was painted on masonite. Gioffre supervised on-site filming to mask the camera where the matte is inserted, and remembered having to crawl out from a five-story-high ledge to get the right shot of the Plaza of the Americas. The burnished steel RoboCop logo was developed using photographic effects that supervisor Peter Kuran based on a black-and-white sketch from Orion. Kuran created a scaled-up matte version and backlit it. A second pass was made with a sheet of aluminum behind it to create reflective detail. RoboCop&#x27;s vision was created with hundreds of ink lines on acetate composited over existing footage. Several attempts had to be made to get the line thickness right; at first, the lines were too thick or too thin. Assuming that thermographic photography would be expensive, Kuran replicated thermal vision using actors in body stockings painted with thermal colors and filmed the scene with a polarized lens filter. RoboCop&#x27;s mechanical recharging chair was designed by John Zabrucky. The OCP boardroom model of Delta City was made under the supervision of art director Gayle Simon.

The film&#x27;s police cars are 1986 Ford Taurus models painted black. The Taurus was chosen because of its futuristic, aerodynamic styling for the vehicle&#x27;s first production year. The car was intended to feature a customized interior that would show graphical displays of mug shots, fingerprints, and other related information, but the concept was considered too ambitious. The 6000 SUX driven by Boddicker and others was an Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, modified by Gene Winfield and based on a design by Chip Foose. Two working cars were made with a third, non-functional one that was used when the vehicle exploded. The 6000 SUX commercial features a plasticine dinosaur animated by Don Waller and blocked by Steve Chiodo.

=== Context ===

Industry experts were optimistic about the theatrical summer of 1987 (June–September). The season focused on genre films—science fiction, horror, and fantasy—that were proven to generate revenue, if not industry respect. Other films—such as &quot;Roxanne&quot;, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; and &quot;The Untouchables&quot;—were targeted at older audiences (over age 25), who had been ignored in recent years by films targeted at teenagers. The action comedy &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; was predicted to dominate the theaters but many other films were expected to perform well, including the action adventure &quot;Ishtar&quot;, the comedies &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; and &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, the action film &quot;Predator&quot; and sequels such as &quot;Superman IV: The Quest for Peace&quot; and &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;, the latest James Bond film. With the musical &quot;La Bamba&quot;, &quot;RoboCop&quot; was predicted to be a sleeper hit. It received positive feedback before release, including a positive industry screening (considered a rarity) and pre-release screenings that demonstrated the studio&#x27;s confidence in the film.

=== Marketing ===

Marketing the film was considered difficult. For the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Jack Mathews described &quot;RoboCop&quot; as a &quot;terrible title for a movie that anyone would expect an adult to enjoy&quot;. Orion head of marketing Charles Glenn said it had a &quot;certain liability... it sounds like &#x27;Robby the Robot&#x27; or Gobots or something else. It&#x27;s nothing like that.&quot; The campaign began three months before the film&#x27;s release, when 5,000 adult-oriented and family-friendly trailers were sent to theaters. Orion promotions director Jan Kean said that children and adults responded positively to the RoboCop character. Miguel Ferrer recalled a theater audience laughing derisively at the trailer, which he found disheartening. Models and actors in fiberglass RoboCop costumes made appearances in cities throughout North America. The character appeared at a motor-racing event in Florida, a laser show in Boston, a subway in New York City, and children could take their picture with him at the Sherman Oaks Galleria in Los Angeles.

An incomplete version of the unrated film was screened early for critics, which was unconventional for an action film. Glenn reasoned that critics who favored Verhoeven&#x27;s earlier work would appreciate &quot;RoboCop&quot;. Feedback was generally positive, providing quotes for promotional material and making it one of the best-reviewed films of the year up to that point. The week before release saw the introduction of television commercials and limited theatrical screenings for the public. The film was released in the United Kingdom without cuts, which the BBFC justified by the comic excess of the violence and the clear line between the hero and villains.

===Box office===
&quot;RoboCop&quot; began a wide North American release on July17, 1987. During its opening weekend, the film earned $8million from 1,580 theaters—an average of $5,068 per theater. It was the weekend&#x27;s number-one film, ahead of a re-release of the 1937 animated film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; ($7.5million) and the horror sequel &quot;&quot; ($7.2million), both of which were also in their first week of release. &quot;RoboCop&quot; retained the number-one position in its second weekend with an additional gross of $6.3million, ahead of &quot;Snow White&quot; ($6.05million) and the debuting comedy &quot;Summer School&quot; ($6million). It was the fourth-highest-grossing film in its third weekend with a gross of $4.7million, behind &quot;La Bamba&quot; ($5.2million) and the debuts of the horror film &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; ($5.2million) and &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; ($11.1million).

&quot;RoboCop&quot; never regained the number-one spot, but remained in the top ten for six weeks. By the end of its theatrical run, the film had grossed about $53.4million and was a modest success. It was the year&#x27;s fourteenth-highest-grossing film, behind &quot;Crocodile Dundee&quot; ($53.6million), &quot;La Bamba&quot; ($54.2million) and &quot;Dragnet&quot; ($57.4million). Figures are unavailable for the film&#x27;s performance outside North America.

Due in part to higher ticket prices and an extra week of the theatrical summer, 1987 set a record of $1.6billion in box-office gross and exceeded the previous record of $1.58billion record set in 1984. Unlike that summer, which featured several blockbusters such as &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, the summer of 1987 delivered only one: &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;. More films (including &quot;RoboCop&quot;) performed modestly well, however, earning a collective total of $274million—a 50-percent increase over 1986. The average audience age continued to increase, as teen-oriented films such as &quot;RoboCop&quot; and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; had a 22-percent drop in performance from similar 1986 films. Adult-oriented films had a 39-percent increase in revenue. &quot;RoboCop&quot; was one of the summer&#x27;s surprise successes, and contributed to Orion&#x27;s improving fortunes.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===

&quot;RoboCop&quot; opened to generally positive reviews. Audience polls by CinemaScore reported that moviegoers gave the film an average letter grade of A−.

Critics noticed influences in the film from the action of &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984) and &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), and the narratives of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931), &quot;Repo Man&quot; (1984) and the television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. &quot;RoboCop&quot; built a distinct, futuristic vision for Detroit, wrote two reviewers, as &quot;Blade Runner&quot; had done for Los Angeles. A number of critics struggled to identify the film&#x27;s genre, writing that it combined social satire and philosophy with elements of action, science fiction, thrillers, Westerns, slapstick comedy, romance, snuff films, superhero comics and camp without being derivative.

Some publications found Verhoeven&#x27;s direction smart and darkly comic, offering sharp social satire that &quot;The Washington Post&quot; suggested would have been just a simple action film in another director&#x27;s hands. Others, such as Dave Kehr of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, believed the film was over-directed with Verhoeven&#x27;s European filmmaking style lacking rhythm, tension and momentum. According to the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; review, Verhoeven&#x27;s typical adeptness at portraying the &quot;sleazily psychological&quot; through physicality failed to properly use RoboCop&#x27;s &quot;Aryan blandness&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and Roger Ebert praised Weller&#x27;s performance and his ability to elicit sympathy and convey chivalry and vulnerability while concealed beneath a bulky costume. Weller offered a certain beauty and grace, wrote &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reviewer, that added a mythic quality and made his murder even more horrible. In contrast, Weller &quot;hardly registered&quot; behind the mask for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; cited Nancy Allen as providing the only human warmth in the film, and Kurtwood Smith as a well-cast &quot;sicko sadist&quot;.

Many reviewers noted the film&#x27;s violence. It was so excessive for Ebert and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that it became deliberately comical, with Ebert writing that ED-209 killing an executive subverted audience expectations of a seemingly serious and straightforward science-fiction film. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviewer believed that the violent scenes simultaneously conveyed sadism and poignancy . Other reviewers were more critical, including Kehr and Walter Goodman, who believed that &quot;RoboCop&quot; satire and critiques of corporate corruption were excuses to indulge in violent visuals. The &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; found the violence had a &quot;brooding, agonized quality... as if Verhoeven were both appalled and fascinated&quot; by it, and &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; said critical praise for the &quot;nasty&quot; film demonstrated a preference for &quot;style over substance&quot;.

Kehr and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that the satire of corporations and the interchangeable use of corporate executives and street-level criminals was the film&#x27;s most successful effort, depicting their unchecked greed and callous disregard with witty criticism of game shows and military culture. Some reviewers appreciated the film&#x27;s adaptation of a classic narrative about a tragic hero seeking revenge and redemption, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writing that the typical cliché revenge story was transformed by making the protagonist a machine that keeps succumbing to humanity, emotion and idealism. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; considered RoboCop&#x27;s victory satisfying because it offered a fable about a decent hero fighting against corruption, villains and the theft of his humanity, with morality and technology on his side. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; agreed that the film&#x27;s &quot;heart&quot; is the story of Murphy regaining his humanity: &quot;[W]ith all our flesh-and-blood heroes failing us—from brokers to ballplayers—we need a man of mettle, a real straight shooter who doesn&#x27;t fool around with Phi Beta Kappas and never puts anything up his nose. What this world needs is &#x27;RoboCop&#x27;.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;RoboCop&quot; received a Special Achievement for Best Sound Editing (Stephen Flick and John Pospisil) at the 60th Academy Awards. The film had two other nominations: Best Film Editing for Frank J. Urioste (losing to Gabriella Cristiani for the drama film &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;) and Best Sound for Michael J. Kohut, Carlos Delarios, Aaron Rochin and Robert Wald (losing to Bill Rowe and Ivan Sharrock for &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;). In a comedy routine at the event, the RoboCop character rescued presenter Pee-wee Herman from ED-209.

At the 42nd British Academy Film Awards, &quot;RoboCop&quot; received two nominations: Best Makeup and Hair for Carla Palmer (losing to Fabrizio Sforza for &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;), and Best Special Visual Effects for Bottin, Tippett, Kuran, and Gioffre (losing to George Gibbs, Richard Williams, Ken Ralston, and Edward Jones for the 1988 fantasy film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;).

At the 15th Saturn Awards, &quot;RoboCop&quot; was the most-nominated film. It received awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Director for Verhoeven, Best Writing for Neumeier and Miner, Best Make-up for Bottin and Dupuis, and Best Special Effects for Kuran, Tippett, Bottin, and Gioffre. The film received three more nominations, including Best Actor (Weller) and Best Actress (Allen).

== After release ==
=== Home media ===

&quot;RoboCop&quot; was released on VHS on January 28, 1988, priced at $89.98; and had an estimated $24million in sales. Orion promoted the film by having former United States president Richard Nixon shake hands with a RoboCop-costumed actor. Nixon was paid $25,000, which he donated to the Boys Club of America. &quot;RoboCop&quot; was a popular rental, peaking at number one in mid-March 1988. Rental demand outstripped supply; estimates suggested that there was one VHS copy of a film per 100 households, making it difficult to find new releases such as &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, &quot;Predator&quot; and &quot;Platoon&quot;. The longest waiting list was for &quot;RoboCop&quot;. The film was released in S-VHS in 1988, one of the earliest films to adopt the format, and was offered free of charge when buying branded S-VCR players.

The extended violent content removed from the U.S. theatrical release was restored on a Criterion Collection LaserDisc, which included audio commentary by Verhoeven, Neumeier and Davison. The uncut version of the film has been made available on other home-media releases. It was released on DVD by Criterion in September 1998. In June 2004, the DVD version was released in a trilogy box set with &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; (1990) and &quot;RoboCop 3&quot; (1993). This edition included featurettes about the making of the film and the RoboCop design. A 20th-anniversary edition was released in August 2007 which included the film&#x27;s theatrical and uncut versions, previous extras, and new featurettes on the special effects and villains.

Its scheduled Blu-ray debut in 2006 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment was canceled days before release, with reviews indicating poor video quality. A new version was released in 2007 by Fox Home Entertainment without extra features. Reviews indicated that the film&#x27;s visual quality had improved, but images were still perceived as grainy or too dark. The trilogy was released as a Blu-ray Disc box set in October 2010.

The film was restored in 4K resolution from the original camera negative in 2013. A two-disc limited-edition Blu-ray set was released in 2019 by Arrow Video which included collectible items (a poster and cards), new commentaries by film historians and fans, deleted scenes, new featurettes with Allen and casting director Julie Selzer, and the theatrical, extended and television cuts of the film. Arrow re-released the set on Ultra HD Blu-ray in 2022, which included the uncut scenes re-scanned from the negative to match the quality of the theatrical-cut scans.

===Other media===

&quot;RoboCop&quot; was considered easier to merchandise than other R-rated films and, despite its violent content, its merchandise was targeted at a younger audience. Merchandise included cap guns and other toys, comic books, theme-park rides, novels and RoboCop Ultra Police action figures, which were released with the 1988 animated series &quot;RoboCop&quot;. By the time of the film&#x27;s release, Marvel Comics had published a black-and-white comic-book adaptation of the film without violence and adult language; a video game was in development, and negotiations were underway to release T-shirts, other video games and RoboCop dolls by Christmas. The film&#x27;s poster, painted by Mike Bryan, was reportedly more popular than the &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue&quot; and its novelization, written by Ed Naha, was in its second printing by July. Since its release, &quot;RoboCop&quot; has continued to be merchandised with collectible action figures, clothing and crockery. A 2014 book, &quot;RoboCop: The Definitive History&quot;, details the &quot;RoboCop&quot; franchise.

The story of &quot;RoboCop&quot; has been continued in comics, initially by Marvel. The adaptation of the film was reprinted in color to promote a 23-issue series that ran between 1987 and 1992, when the rights were transferred to Dark Horse Comics. Dark Horse released a number of miniseries, including &quot;RoboCop Versus The Terminator&quot; (1992), which pitted RoboCop against Skynet and its Terminators from &quot;The Terminator&quot; franchise. The story was well-received and was followed by other series, including &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; (1992), &quot;Roulette&quot; (1994) and &quot;Mortal Coils&quot; (1996). The &quot;RoboCop&quot; series was continued by Avatar Press (2003), Dynamite Entertainment (2010) and Boom! Studios (2013).

Several games based on, or inspired by, the film have been released. A side-scroller of the same name was released for arcades in 1988, and was ported to other platforms such as the ZX Spectrum and Game Boy. &quot;RoboCop Versus The Terminator&quot;, an adaptation of the comic of the same name, was released in 1994. &quot;RoboCop&quot;, a 2003 first-person shooter, was poorly received and resulted in the shuttering of developer Titus Interactive. &quot;&quot; (2023) continues the narrative of &quot;RoboCop&quot;, being set between &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; and &quot;RoboCop 3&quot;.

== Thematic analysis ==
=== Corporate power ===

A central theme in &quot;RoboCop&quot; is the power of corporations. Those depicted in the film are corrupt and greedy, privatizing public services and gentrifying Detroit. A self-described hippie who grew up during the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War, Miner was critical of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s pro-business policies and believed that Detroit was destroyed by American corporations. The Detroit presented in the film is described as beset by rape, crime and &quot;Reaganomics gone awry&quot;, where gentrification and unfettered capitalism result in corporations waging war as the police become a profit-driven entity. Miner said that out-of-control crime was a particularly Republican or right-wing fear, but &quot;RoboCop&quot; puts the blame for drugs and crime on advancing technology and the privatization of public services such as hospitals, prisons and the police. Although criticism of Reagan-era policies was in the script, Verhoeven did not understand urban politics such as the privatization of prisons. Weller said that the trickle-down economics espoused by Reagan was &quot;bullshit&quot; and did not work fast enough for those in need.

Michael Robertson described the Media Breaks throughout the film as direct criticisms of neoliberal Reagan policies. Robertson focused on OCP&#x27;s claim that it has private ownership of RoboCop, despite making use of Murphy&#x27;s corpse. The Old Man was based on Reagan, and the corporation&#x27;s policies emphasize greed and profit over individual rights. The police are deliberately underfunded, and the creation of RoboCop aims to replace them with a more efficient force. Jones admits that it does not matter if ED-209 works, because they have contracts to provide spare parts for years. He plots with Boddicker to corrupt workers brought in to build Delta City with drugs and prostitution. Davison believed that the film is politically liberal, but the violence makes it &quot;fascism for liberals&quot;. It takes a pro-labor stance; the police chief, believing in the essential nature of his service, refuses to strike but the underfunded, understaffed and under-assault police eventually walk out. OCP sees the strike as an opportunity to develop more robots.

=== Humanity and death ===

Another central theme is the question of what humanity is, and how much of Murphy is left in RoboCop. Neumeier wanted to leave audiences asking &quot;what&#x27;s left&quot; of Murphy, and described the character&#x27;s journey as coping with his transformation. As an officer, Murphy works for a corporation that insists it owns individuals based on waivers and can do what it wants with Murphy&#x27;s remains. He does the right thing, however, and fights against the demands of his corporate masters. Despite his inhuman appearance, RoboCop has a soul, experiences real human fears, and has a core consciousness that makes him more than a machine. Brooks Landon says that Murphy is dead, however; although he remembers Murphy&#x27;s life, RoboCop is not (and can never be) Murphy and regain enough of his humanity to rejoin his family. Dale Bradley writes that RoboCop is a machine who mistakenly thinks it is Murphy because of its composite parts, and only believes it has a human spirit within. An alternative view is that RoboCop&#x27;s personality is a new construct, informed partially by fragments of Murphy&#x27;s personality. Slavoj Žižek describes Murphy as a man between life and death, who is deceased and simultaneously reanimated with mechanical parts. As he regains his humanity, he transforms from being programmed by others to his former state as a being of desire. Žižek calls this return of the living dead a fundamental human fantasy, a desire to avoid death and take revenge against the living.

Murphy&#x27;s death is prolonged and violent, so the audience can see RoboCop as imbued with the humanity taken from him by Boddicker&#x27;s gang and OCP. Verhoeven considered it important to acknowledge the inherent darkness of humanity to avoid inevitable mutual destruction. He was affected by his childhood experiences during World War II and the inhuman actions he witnessed. Verhoeven believed that the concept of an immaculate hero died after the war, and subsequent heroes had a dark side they had to overcome. Describing the difference between making films in Europe and America, Verhoeven said that a European &quot;RoboCop&quot; would explore the spiritual and psychological problems of RoboCop&#x27;s condition; the American version focuses on revenge. He incorporated Christian mythology into the film; Murphy&#x27;s brutal death is analogous to the crucifixion of Jesus before his resurrection as RoboCop, an American Jesus who walks on water at the steel mill and wields a handgun. Verhoeven said that he did not believe in the resurrection of Jesus, but &quot;[he] can see the value of that idea, the purity of that idea. So from an artistic point of view, it&#x27;s absolutely true&quot;. The scene of RoboCop returning to Murphy&#x27;s home is compared to finding the Garden of Eden or a similar paradise.

Brooks Landon describes the film as typical of the cyberpunk genre because it does not treat RoboCop as better or worse than average humans (just different), and asks the audience to consider him a new life form. The film does not treat this technological advance as necessarily negative, just an inevitable result of a progression that will change one&#x27;s life and one&#x27;s understanding of what it means to be human. The RoboCop character embodies the struggle of humanity to embrace technology. The central cast do not have romantic interests or overt sexual desires. Paul Sammon described the scene of RoboCop shooting bottles of baby food as symbolic of the relationship he and Lewis can never have. Taylor agreed, but believed that the confrontation between Morton and Jones in the OCP bathroom was sexualized.
=== Masculinity and authority ===
Vince Mancini describes the 1980s as a period in which cinematic heroes were unambiguously good, as depicted in films that promoted suburban living, materialism and unambiguous villains such as &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981) and &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985). Some films of the decade send the message that authority is good and trustworthy, but &quot;RoboCop&quot; demonstrates that those in authority are flawed and Detroit has been carved up by greed, capitalism and cheap foreign labor. Weller described RoboCop as an evolution of strait-laced 1940s heroes such as Gary Cooper and Jimmy Stewart, who lived honorably; modern audiences now cheer a maimed police officer taking brutal revenge.

Susan Jeffords considers &quot;RoboCop&quot; among the many &quot;hard body&quot; films of the decade that portray perfect, strong, masculine physiques who must protect the &quot;soft bodies&quot;: the ineffectual and the weak. RoboCop portrays strength by eliminating crime and redeeming the city through violence. Bullets ricochet harmlessly off his armor; attempts to attack his crotch (a typical weak point) only hurt the attacker, demonstrating the uncompromising strength and masculinity needed to eliminate crime. According to Darian Leader, the addition of something unnatural to a biological body is required to be truly masculine. RoboCop&#x27;s body incorporates technology, a symbolic addition that makes him more than an average man.

== Legacy ==
=== Cultural influence ===

&quot;RoboCop&quot; is considered a groundbreaking entry in the science-fiction genre. Unlike many protagonists at the time, the film&#x27;s central character is not a robotic-like human who is stoic and invincible but a human-like robot who is affected by his lost humanity. In a 2013 interview following Detroit&#x27;s bankruptcy and the city&#x27;s labeling as the most dangerous place in the United States, Neumeier spoke about the film&#x27;s prescience: &quot;We are now living in the world that I was proposing in &quot;RoboCop&quot;... how big corporations will take care of us and... how they won&#x27;t.&quot; Verhoeven described &quot;RoboCop&quot; as a film ahead of its time, which could not be improved with digital effects. Weller said that the filming experience was among the worst of his life, mainly because of the RoboCop costume. Verhoeven also considered filming &quot;RoboCop&quot; a miserable experience, in part due to the difficulties with special effects and other things going wrong. Ferrer, however, described it as the best summer of his life.

The film&#x27;s impact was not limited to North America, and Neumeier recalled finding unlicensed RoboCop dolls for sale near the Colosseum in Rome. He has said that many robotics labs use a &quot;Robo-&quot; prefix for projects in reference to the film, and he was hired as a United States Air Force consultant for futuristic concepts because of his involvement with &quot;RoboCop&quot;. In the years immediately after its release, Verhoeven parlayed his success into directing the science-fiction film &quot;Total Recall&quot; (1990, also with Cox) and the erotic thriller &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992). He also worked with Neumeier on the tonally-similar science-fiction film &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; (1997). In 2020, the &quot;Guardian&quot;″s Scott Tobias wrote that in hindsight, &quot;RoboCop&quot; was the beginning of Verhoeven&#x27;s unofficial science-fiction trilogy about authoritarian governance (followed by &quot;Total Recall&quot; and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;). Previously typecast as someone who played moral characters, Cox credited &quot;RoboCop&quot; with changing his image and—with the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; films—boosting his film career to make him one of the decade&#x27;s most iconic villains.

The RoboCop, ED-209 and Clarence Boddicker characters are considered iconic. Lines such as RoboCop&#x27;s &quot;Dead or alive, you&#x27;re coming with me&quot;, ED-209&#x27;s &quot;You have 20 seconds to comply&quot; and television host Bixby Snyder&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;d buy that for a dollar&quot; are among the film&#x27;s most recognizable. The film has been referred to in a variety of media, from television (including &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;, &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, &quot;South Park&quot;, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;) to films (including &quot;Hot Shots! Part Deux&quot; and &quot;Ready Player One&quot;) and video games (&quot;Deus Ex&quot; and its prequel, &quot;Deus Ex: Human Revolution&quot;). &quot;Doom Eternal&quot; (2020) creative director Hugo Martin cited it as an inspiration. RoboCop (voiced by Weller) is a playable character in the fighting game &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (2019). The character was a design inspiration for the Nintendo Power Glove (1989), and appeared in advertisements for KFC in 2019 (again voiced by Weller), and Direct Line in 2020 with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Bumblebee.

For the 30th anniversary of &quot;RoboCop&quot; release in 2017, Weller attended a screening by Alamo Drafthouse Cinema at Dallas City Hall (in his home town) and called the film an homage to the city. The crowdfunded making-of documentary &quot;RoboDoc: The Creation of RoboCop&quot; was released in August 2023. It covers the production and influence of &quot;RoboCop&quot;, with interviews of many of the cast and crew involved. A RoboCop statue is to be erected in Detroit. First proposed in 2011, $70,000 was crowdfunded for its construction and, , the statue was complete and awaiting installation.

===Modern reception===
&quot;RoboCop&quot; has been called one of the best science-fiction and action films of all time, and among the best films of the 1980s. Several publications have listed it as one of the greatest action films of all time: On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it has a approval rating based on reviews, with an average rating of . According to the website, &quot;While over-the-top and gory, &quot;RoboCop&quot; is also a surprisingly smart sci-fi flick that uses ultraviolence to disguise its satire of American culture.&quot; Rotten Tomatoes listed the film at number139 on its list of 200 essential movies to watch, and one of 300 essential movies. The film has a score of 70 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 17 &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. In the 2000s, &quot;The New York Times&quot; listed it as one of its 1,000 &quot;Best Movies Ever&quot;, and &quot;Empire&quot; ranked the film number404 on its list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.

Filmmakers have spoken about their appreciation for &quot;RoboCop&quot; and cited it as an inspiration in their own careers, including Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, Neill Blomkamp and Leigh Whannell and Ken Russell, who called it the best science fiction film since Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927). During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was among the action films recommended by director James Gunn.

==Sequels and adaptations==

By November 1987, Orion had greenlit the development of a sequel targeting a PG rating, that would allow children to see the film unaccompanied by adults, and tying into the 12-episode animated series &quot;RoboCop&quot;, released by Marvel Productions in 1988. Neumeier and Miner began writing the film but were fired after refusing to work during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike and were replaced by Frank Miller, whose second draft was made into &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; and first draft became the second sequel, &quot;RoboCop 3&quot;. Weller reprised his role in the Irvin Kershner–directed first sequel, which was released to mixed reviews and was estimated to have lost money.

&quot;RoboCop 3&quot;, directed by Fred Dekker, was targeted at younger audiences who were driving merchandise sales. Robert John Burke replaced Weller in the title role, and Allen returned as Anne Lewis for the third and final time in the series. The film was a critical and financial failure. 

A live-action television series was released in 1994, but had a poor critical reception and was canceled after 22 episodes. Starring Richard Eden as RoboCop, the series used aspects of Neumeier and Miner&#x27;s &quot;RoboCop 2&quot; ideas. A second animated series, &quot;&quot;, followed in 1998. Page Fletcher starred as RoboCop in a four-part live-action miniseries, &quot;&quot; (2001). The series, set ten years after the events of the first film, ignores the events of the sequels. After years of financial difficulties, Orion and the rights to &quot;RoboCop&quot; were purchased by MGM in the late 1990s.

A 2014 reboot of the first film, also called &quot;RoboCop&quot;, was directed by José Padilha and starred Joel Kinnaman. The film received mixed reviews, but was a financial success. Verhoeven said that he &quot;should be dead&quot; before a reboot was attempted, and Allen believed that an &quot;iconic&quot; film should not be remade. &quot;RoboCop Returns&quot;, a sequel to &quot;RoboCop&quot; that ignores the series&#x27; other films, was announced to be in development in 2019. However, MGM was purchased by Amazon in 2022, and a television series was announced in 2024.
