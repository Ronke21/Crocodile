<doc id="438713" wikidata="Q435743" url="?curid=438713" title="Shigechiyo Izumi">
<text>was a Japanese man who was titled the oldest living person after the death of Niwa Kawamoto on 16 November 1976, also from Japan. Izumi&#x27;s claimed birth date of 29 June 1865 was accepted by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, which recognized him as the oldest verified man ever, but this was eventually withdrawn in 2010; in the 2012 edition of the Guinness World Records book, Christian Mortensen was named the &quot;oldest verified man ever&quot; and Izumi was not mentioned.

== Biography ==
&quot;Guinness World Records&quot; found a document attesting that he was 24 years old in 1889 when he was exempted from military service to deal with sugar cane fields.

Izumi drank brown sugar &quot;shōchū&quot; (a Japanese alcoholic beverage often distilled from barley or rice), and took up smoking at age 70. Izumi&#x27;s personal physician strongly advised him against drinking shōchū as his kidneys were not strong enough to process shōchū in his advanced age, but Izumi went on to say: &quot;Without shōchū there would be no pleasure in life. I would rather die than give up drinking.&quot; He retired from sugar cane farming in 1970.

== Death and uncertainty over age ==
After a brief hospitalization, Izumi died of pneumonia at 21:15 JST on 21 February 1986. At the time, he was considered the only person ever verified to have reached the age of 120, although subsequent research has cast doubt on his actual age. In April 1987, 14 months after Izumi&#x27;s death, the Department of Epidemiology at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology reported that research into Izumi&#x27;s family registration records indicated he might have been 105 when he died. The 2011 &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; book states that the birth certificate submitted as evidence might have actually belonged to a deceased brother, and the family may have re-used &quot;Shigechiyo&quot; as a necronym.

With the closing of the Guinness World Record Museum in Niagara Falls, Ontario, in September 2020, the display and fibreglass statue of Izumi was sold for $850 on February 12th 2021 and now resides in a private collection in Canada.

The oldest undisputed case of male longevity is Jiroemon Kimura, also from Japan, who died at age 116 years and 54 days. Jeanne Calment holds the record for verified female longevity and longevity as a whole at 122 years and 164 days.

<text>Yuvraj Singh (born 12 December 1981) is a former Indian international cricketer who played in all formats of the game. An all-rounder who batted left-handed in the middle order and bowled slow left-arm orthodox, he has won 7 Player of the Series awards in One Day International cricket, which is the joint third-highest by an Indian cricketer, shared with former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly. He is the son of former Indian cricketer and actor Yograj Singh.

Yuvraj was a member of the Indian cricket team in ODIs from 2000 to 2017 and played his first Test match in October 2003. He was the vice-captain of the Indian ODI team between 2007 and 2008. In a match against England at the 2007 World Twenty20, he famously hit six sixes in one over bowled by Stuart Broad—a feat performed only three times previously in any form of senior cricket, and never in an international match between two teams with Test match status. In the same match, he set the record for the fastest fifty in Twenty20 Internationals and in all T20 cricket, reaching 50 runs in 12 balls, which was a record for fastest half century in International cricket, until it was broken by Dipendra Airee during 2023 Asian Games but Singh still holds the record in the ICC Cricket World Cup and among ICC full member nations. During the 2011 World Cup, he became the first player to take a 5-wicket haul and score a 50 in the same World Cup match. During the 2011 World Cup, Yuvraj Singh played eight innings in nine matches and scored 362 runs at a remarkable average of 90.50. He also took 15 wickets in the tournament, maintaining an economy rate of 5.02.

In 2011, Yuvraj was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in his left lung and underwent chemotherapy treatment in Boston and Indianapolis. In March 2012, he was discharged from the hospital after completing the third and final cycle of chemotherapy and returned to India in April. He made his international comeback in a Twenty20 match in September against New Zealand shortly before the 2012 World Twenty20.

In 2012, Yuvraj was conferred with the Arjuna Award, India&#x27;s second highest sporting award by the Government of India. In 2014, he was awarded the Padma Shri, India&#x27;s fourth highest civilian honour. At the 2014 IPL auction, Royal Challengers Bangalore bought Yuvraj for an all-time high price of 14 crore and, in 2015, the Delhi Capitals bought him for 16 crore, making him the second most expensive player ever to be sold in the IPL until Chris Morris was sold to the Rajasthan Royals for a record 16.25 crore in February 2021. In February 2014, he was honoured with the &quot;Most Inspiring Sportsperson of the Year Award&quot; by FICCI.

On 10 June 2019, Yuvraj announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket. He last represented India in June 2017, against the West Indies. His request for a return to domestic cricket and IPL was turned down by the BCCI over his participation in the Global T20 Canada in Canada and Abu Dhabi T10 in the United Arab Emirates.

==Early years and personal life==
Yuvraj Singh was born in a Punjabi Jat Sikh family to Yograj Singh, a former Indian cricketer, and Shabnam Singh. Tennis and roller skating were Yuvraj&#x27;s favourite sports during his childhood and he was quite good at both. He had also won the National Under-14 Roller Skating Championship. His father threw away the medal and told him to forget skating and concentrate on cricket. He would take Yuvraj to training every day.

Singh studied at the DAV Public School in Chandigarh. He completed his graduation degree in commerce from DAV College, Punjab University, Chandigarh. He also did two short roles as child star in &quot;Mehndi Sagna Di and Putt Sardara&quot;.

On 12 November 2015, Singh got engaged to British actress Hazel Keech and married her on 30 November 2016. The couple had their first child, a boy named Orion, on 25 January 2022. Their second child, a girl named Aura, was born on 25 August 2023.

==Career==

===Youth career===
Yuvraj began his career with Punjab Under-16s at the age of 13 years and 11 months in November of the 1995–96 season against Jammu and Kashmir-16s. In 1996–97, Yuvraj was promoted to Punjab Under-19s and scored 137 not out against Himachal Pradesh Under-19s.

Yuvraj made his first-class debut in late-1997 against Odisha during the 1997–98 Ranji Trophy but was dismissed for a duck opening the innings. His first break-out performance came in the Under-19 Cooch Behar Trophy Final of 1999 against Bihar at Jamshedpur; Bihar was all out with a score of 357 and Yuvraj batted at three for Punjab and made 358 runs himself. Yuvraj represented India in the series against Sri Lanka Under-19s in India in February 1999. In the third ODI, Yuvraj scored 89 runs from 55 balls. In 1999-2000 Ranji Trophy, he scored 149 against Haryana.

In the 2000 Under-19 Cricket World Cup which India won under the captaincy of Mohammad Kaif, Yuvraj&#x27;s all-round performance earned him the Player of the Tournament award and a call-up to the national squad. His performance in the tournament included 68 off 62 and 4/36 against New Zealand in a group stage match, and a quickfire 58 off 25 balls against Australia in the semifinal. Yuvraj was subsequently selected in 2000 for the first intake of cricketers in the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore.

===International breakthrough===
Yuvraj was selected in the Indian squad for the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy on the back of his impressive performances for the Under-19 team. He made his international debut against Kenya in the pre-quarterfinal. He bowled four overs conceding 16 runs but did not get to bat. In the quarterfinal match against Australia, Yuvraj won the man of the match for his innings of 84 out of 80 balls, against a pace attack consisting of Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, that helped India win by 20 runs. In the semifinal against South Africa, he scored 41 and picked 1/15. He scored only 18 against New Zealand in the final which India lost. The tournament was followed by a tri-series involving India, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Yuvraj scored just 55 runs in five innings at an average of 11. Yuvraj averaged 15.50 in the ODI series against the touring Zimbabwe side in December 2000 after which he was dropped from the team.

Yuvraj made his comeback during the 2001 Coca-Cola Cup in Sri Lanka. He scored a crucial 98* against Sri Lanka in the fifth match of an otherwise disappointing series with the bat. However, he proved to be useful with the ball as he took 8 wickets at an average of 27. In the Standard Bank triangular series involving hosts South Africa, India and Kenya, Yuvraj managed to score only 69 runs from 6 innings, including a duck in the final against South Africa. Following this, Dinesh Mongia and Hemang Badani were chosen over Yuvraj in the squad for the home series against England in January 2002.

Yuvraj returned to domestic cricket in early 2002. After a disappointing run in the Ranji knockouts, Yuvraj struck 209 for North Zone against South Zone in a Duleep Trophy match in March 2002. He was immediately drafted into the national squad for the final two ODIs against Zimbabwe with India trailing the series 1–2. Yuvraj made an impact in his return match at Hyderabad, scoring an unbeaten 80 off just 60 balls, taking India to a five-wicket win and levelling the series. He won the Man of the Match award for his efforts. In the final ODI at Guvahati, Yuvraj made 75 runs from 52 balls, sharing a 157-run fifth-wicket partnership with Mongia who scored his career-best unbeaten 159, to help India post a total of 333 in their 50 overs. India went on to win the game by 101 runs and the series 3–2.

===2002 NatWest Series===
After winning the ODI series in the West Indies 2–1, where Yuvraj managed scores of only 1 and 10, the Indian team toured England in June for the NatWest triangular series, featuring England, Sri Lanka, and India, and a four-match Test series against the hosts. In the first match at Lord&#x27;s, Yuvraj won the man of the match for his all-round performance (3/39 and 64*) as India successfully chased down England&#x27;s total of 271. In the next match against Sri Lanka, he scored 31 and shared a crucial 60-run sixth-wicket partnership with Mohammad Kaif to set up another successful run-chase. India&#x27;s next match against England was washed out due to rain after Yuvraj had scored an unbeaten 40 off 19 balls to take India to 285/4 in their 50 overs. Yuvraj&#x27;s knock of 37, along with a fifty from Rahul Dravid, helped India recover from 59/4 to reach a target of 188 posted by Sri Lanka. This win eliminated Sri Lanka from the series with another round of matches still to be played. Yuvraj had scores of 5 and 8 in the final round of matches but proved to be useful with the ball as he picked one wicket in each of the two games. At the end of the round-robin matches, India topped the points table with 19 points while England finished second with 15 points.

The final was played at Lord&#x27;s on 13 July between India and England. After winning the toss and electing to bat first, England posted a daunting total of 325/5 in 50 overs. In reply, India was struggling at 146/5 at the end of 24 overs, when Kaif joined Yuvraj at the crease. The pair initially stabilised the innings and later scored at a brisk rate. The pair shared a partnership of 121 runs for the sixth wicket which came to an end when Yuvraj was dismissed for 69 off 63 balls when he top-edged a sweep shot in the 42nd over off the bowling of Paul Collingwood resulting in a simple catch to Alex Tudor at short fine leg. India went on to win the game by two wickets with three balls to spare. This was India&#x27;s first win in the final of an ODI tournament since 2000, after nine consecutive defeats. This win is regarded as one of India&#x27;s greatest victories in ODI cricket.

===Highs and lows===
Yuvraj batted in two games of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy which was held in Sri Lanka in September. He scored 3 against Zimbabwe in the opening match, and 62 in the semifinal against South Africa. In November 2002, Yuvraj struggled in the first five games of the 7-match ODI series against West Indies, with a high score of 30. He returned to form in the sixth ODI at Jodhpur with a half-century that helped India win the match by three wickets and level the series 3-3. He top-scored for India in the 7th match with a 69-ball 68, but could not get support from any other batsman. India crashed to a 135-run defeat and lost the series. He struggled for runs in the seven-match ODI series in New Zealand in December 2002-January 2003, averaging just above 19 with a solitary fifty.

Despite his average form leading up to the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup in South Africa, Yuvraj secured a place in the 15-man Indian squad for the tournament. He scored 37 in India&#x27;s opening match against Netherlands. In the following games, he had scores of 0, 1 and 7* against Australia, Zimbabwe and Namibia respectively. He then scored a brisk 42 against England, followed by an unbeaten 50 against Pakistan setting up wins for India in both games. In the Super Six stage of the tournament, Yuvraj had scores of 58* against Kenya and 5 against Sri Lanka. He scored 16 in the semifinal against Kenya, and 24 against Australia in the final.

Yuvraj scored his maiden ODI century (102* from 85 balls) against Bangladesh at Dhaka on 11 April 2003. In May 2003, Yuvraj was signed up by the Yorkshire County Cricket Club for the 2003 county season. He became only the second Indian after Sachin Tendulkar to represent the county. Yuvraj&#x27;s Test debut came on 16 October 2003 at his home ground Mohali against New Zealand. Batting at six, he scored 20 in the first innings, and 5* in the second innings. In the TVS Cup tri-series in October–November 2003 involving India, Australia and New Zealand, he scored 113 runs from 7 games at an average of 18.83 and top-score of 44.

Yuvraj returned to form in early-2004 in the tri-series involving Australia and Zimbabwe. He scored 314 runs from 8 innings at an average of 39.25, including his second ODI hundred - 139 runs from 122 balls, with 16 fours and two sixes - against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He had a mixed tour of Pakistan in March–April 2004. He disappointed in the ODI series with 141 runs from 5 matches, averaging just over 28, but found success in the Test series. In the first Test at Multan, he scored 59 - his maiden Test fifty - as India registered an innings win. He also picked his maiden Test wicket during Pakistan&#x27;s second innings. In the second Test at Lahore, Yuvraj scored his maiden Test century during India&#x27;s first innings while the rest of the batting line-up struggled against the bowling of Umar Gul. Yuvraj&#x27;s score of 112 came from just 129 deliveries with 15 fours and two sixes. He made only 12 runs in the second Test as Pakistan levelled the series after winning the match by 9 wickets. He scored 47 in the final Test at Rawalpindi where India secured the series with another innings victory. However, he suffered a drop in form in the latter half of 2004 with batting averages of 31 in the 2004 Asia Cup, 12.33 in the Natwest Series in England and just 4.50 in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy. In October 2004, after the first two Tests of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, he was dropped from the Test squad as his dismal run with the bat yielded just 47 runs from the two matches.

Despite Yuvraj&#x27;s loss of form, he continued to be a regular feature in the Indian ODI team. In the Platinum Jubilee Match against Pakistan in November 2004, he scored a 62-ball 78 in a losing cause. In December 2004, Yuvraj scored 94 runs at an average of 31.33 in the three-match ODI tour of Bangladesh including a quickfire knock of 69 from 32 balls in the final ODI at Dhaka. He had a disappointing ODI series at home against Pakistan in April 2005, scoring 98 runs in six matches at 19.60.

===Return to form===
In July–August 2005, Yuvraj was the leading run-scorer for India in the 2005 Indian Oil Cup triangular series in Sri Lanka also involving the hosts Sri Lanka and West Indies. He scored 192 runs in four matches, averaging 48. He also recorded his third ODI century during the series - 110 runs from 114 balls - against the West Indies at Colombo for which he was adjudged the man of the match. Yuvraj then played in the Videocon Cup in August–September 2005, a triangular series involving India, New Zealand and the host&#x27;s Zimbabwe. He averaged 54 with the bat in the series, scoring 216 runs from 5 matches. He scored 120 in the final round-robin match against Zimbabwe at Harare, helping India recover from 36/4 to successfully chase down a target of 251.

In October–November 2005, Yuvraj had a quiet seven-match ODI series at home against Sri Lanka. He managed just 124 runs in six innings at an average of 31 with a top score of 79*.

In November 2005, Yuvraj scored 103 in the first ODI against South Africa at Hyderabad to take India from 35/5 to a respectable total of 249/9, and won the man of the match award despite South Africa winning the game by five wickets. He picked 1/17 and remained not out in the second ODI at Bangalore, before the third match at Chennai was washed out due to rain. He scored 53 and 49 in the final two matches at Delhi and Ahmedabad respectively, and the series was drawn 2-2. Yuvraj and South African captain Graeme Smith were jointly awarded the Man of the series award as both of them scored 209 runs at 69.66, finishing as the joint-highest run-scorers of the series. Yuvraj had a mixed home Test series against Sri Lanka in December 2005 as he registered two ducks and two half-centuries. He scored 0 &amp; 77* in the second Test at Delhi, and 0 &amp; 75 in the third Test at Ahmedabad as India won both the matches by comfortable margins.

Yuvraj was picked in both Test and ODI squads for the Pakistan tour in January–February 2006. The first two Tests were drawn and Yuvraj batted only once, in the second Test, scoring 4. In the third Test at Karachi, he top-scored for India in both innings. After scoring 45 in the first innings, he went to score his second Test hundred in the second innings (122 runs from 144 balls). India lost the match by 341 runs and the series 1–0. In the one-day series, he continued his good form. He scored a 28-ball 39 in the first ODI at Peshawar which Pakistan won by 7 runs by the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method. He scored an unbeaten 82 in the second match at Rawalpindi taking India to an emphatic 7-wicket win, before scoring an unbeaten 79 in the third game at Lahore and helping India successfully chase the target of 289. In the low-scoring fourth match at Multan, he scored 37 as India took the series with a five-wicket victory.

He won the man of the match award for this innings and was also adjudged player of the series.

Against England, Yuvraj averaged 21.33 in two Tests in March but proved to be successful with both bat and ball in the ODI series in which he again won the player of the series award.

In the second ODI at Kingston, with India needing two runs to win with one wicket in hand and three balls to spare, Yuvraj was bowled by Dwayne Bravo for 93. India went on to lose the series 4–1. His poor run of form in Tests continued, with him scoring 104 runs from four matches at an average of 17.33 and a top-score of 39. In September 2006, Yuvraj was dropped from the playing eleven during the 2006-07 DLF Cup in Kuala Lumpur after he registered two consecutive ducks against Australia and West Indies. He played in two group matches of the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy held in India in October. and scored 27* against England and 27 against West Indies. During a training session before India&#x27;s final group fixture against Australia, Yuvraj suffered a ligament injury in his left knee. Dinesh Mongia replaced him for the match which India lost to crash out of the tournament. In November, Indian team physio Andrew Leipus suggested that Yuvraj was unlikely to recover from the injury before the start of the World Cup in March 2007.

Yuvraj was not named in any of the Indian squads that toured South Africa in late 2006. In January 2007, less than two months before the World Cup, he made a comeback from injury for the last two matches of the four-match ODI series against West Indies, but did not make much of an impact in either game. Despite concerns over his fitness, Yuvraj was selected in the 15-man Indian squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, with chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar confirming that Yuvraj was fit. He featured in the last two matches of the four-ODI series against Sri Lanka in February 2007, and struck an unbeaten 83-ball 95 in the deciding final game at Visakhapatnam. India won the match by seven wickets and the series 2–1.

Yuvraj made 47 in India&#x27;s first match of the World Cup, a shock defeat to Bangladesh. In India&#x27;s next group match at Port-of-Spain against World Cup debutants Bermuda, he hit 83 off 46 balls to help India post a total of 413/5, the highest total in World Cup history at the time. After their emphatic against Bermuda, India were left with a must-win final group fixture against Sri Lanka. Chasing 255 to win the match, Yuvraj was run out for 6, as India were bowled out for 185 and made an early exit from the World Cup.

In the three-match ODI series against South Africa in Ireland, Yuvraj took 3 for 36 and scored an unbeaten 49 in the second ODI before winning man of the match for his unbeaten 61 in the series-deciding final game. On India&#x27;s tour of England, Yuvraj remained on the bench throughout the Test series before finishing third on the run-scorers list in the ODI series with 283 runs from 7 matches at an average of 40.42.

===2007 World Twenty20 and vice-captaincy===
Yuvraj was the vice-captain of the Indian squad at the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in South Africa. In India&#x27;s Super 8 match against England at Durban, he hit six sixes in an over off Stuart Broad. In the process, he reached the fastest fifty ever in a Twenty20 game, off just 12 balls, which was also the fastest in any form of international cricket. This was the fourth time that six sixes had been hit in one over in senior cricket, the first time in Twenty20 cricket, and the first time in any form of international cricket against a bowler from a Test playing nation. He finished his innings with 58 runs off 16 balls and won the man of the match.

Yuvraj missed the next game against South Africa due to a minor injury but recovered before the semifinal against Australia. In the semifinal, he top-scored with 70 off 30 balls and also hit the longest six of the tournament () off the bowling of Brett Lee). The knock later was named the Best Twenty20 Batting Performance

He was dismissed for 14 in the final against Pakistan but India went on to win by five runs and win the tournament.

He was named in the &#x27;Team of the Tournament&#x27; by ESPNcricinfo for the 2007 T20I World Cup.
In September 2007, MS Dhoni and Yuvraj were named ODI captain and vice-captain respectively, following the resignation of Rahul Dravid. Yuvraj scored 121 at Hyderabad in a losing cause in the third of the seven ODIs against Australia, but accumulated only 71 in the other six matches of the series. He enjoyed a return to form in India&#x27;s home ODI series against Pakistan in November 2007. He scored four half-centuries in five matches, averaging 68, and was named player of the series as India won the series 3–2. He was also fined for showing dissent in the final match in Jaipur. Although Yuvraj was included in Indian squad for the subsequent Test series against Pakistan, Test captain Anil Kumble said that Yuvraj &quot;will have to wait a little bit more to become a regular member in the Test squad.&quot; He did not feature in the playing eleven in the first two matches, but was picked in the third Test at Bangalore to replace an injured Sachin Tendulkar. Batting first, India was 61/4 before Yuvraj and Sourav Ganguly shared a 300-run fifth-wicket partnership, and Yuvraj recorded his highest Test score of 169 off 203 balls, while Ganguly went on to score 239 which was also his highest score in tests.

In November 2008, he hit 138 not out from 78 balls against England at Rajkot, taking 64 balls to reach his century which at the time was the second fastest by an Indian in ODIs after Mohammad Azharuddin&#x27;s century in 1988 against New Zealand came off 62 balls. 
After reaching 50 from 42 balls, he added an additional 88 runs in the next 36 balls. He did so despite straining his back, which necessitated the use of Gautam Gambhir as a runner. This was followed by a score of 118 off 122 balls and bowling figures of 4/28, with all of his wickets being specialist batsmen, in the next match in Indore, earning him two consecutive man of the match awards. Yuvraj scored 85 not out and put on an unbroken partnership of 163 with Sachin Tendulkar to defeat England in the First Test at Chennai in December 2008. It was the fourth highest successful run chase in history and the highest in India. Yuvraj scored a quick, unbeaten 54 in the second innings of the Napier Test against New Zealand to help India save the game after following on. India preserved their series lead and went on to win the series 1–0.

For his performances in 2009, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC.

Yuvraj was dropped from the Asia Cup following the team&#x27;s return from the World Twenty20 in West Indies. A drop in form, disciplinary issues and fitness were talked of as the reasons for his exclusion, but he made a return for the series against Sri Lanka.
With Suresh Raina scoring a century on Test debut and Cheteshwar Pujara making a compelling case for higher honours with consistent first-class performances, Yuvraj was dropped from the Test squad for the two-match series against Australia.

In the process, he became the first allrounder to score 300-plus runs and take 15 wickets in a single World Cup.
In India&#x27;s match against Ireland, he became the first player to take 5 wickets and score 50 runs in a World Cup match. He also took his 100th ODI wicket with the dismissal of Wesley Barresi in the World Cup match against the Netherlands. He later took 2/44 and scored 57 runs against defending champions Australia in the quarter finals, earning him the Man of the Match award.

Yuvraj had respiratory difficulties through 2011 and in May he withdrew from the ODI series in the West Indies due to an illness. His issues began with breathing difficulties, nausea and bouts of vomiting blood. 
He toured England but had to return home after breaking his finger in the Nottingham Test and later played two home Tests against West Indies. However, he then pulled out of the ODI series against West Indies in November citing an abnormal tumour in his lung.

For his performances in 2012, he was named in the T20I XI of the year by ESPNcricinfo.

In September 2013, Yuvraj made a comeback to India&#x27;s limited-overs squad for the Twenty20 and first three ODIs of the home series against Australia.
In October 2013, Yuvraj scored 77 off 35 in the only T20I against Australia at Niranjan Shah Stadium in Rajkot. India faced a required run rate of nearly 12 per over when at 100 for 4 in the 12th over, but Yuvraj&#x27;s unbeaten 102 run partnership with Dhoni guided India to victory. However, Yuvraj had a woeful time in the ODI series that followed, scoring 19 runs in four innings, and being visibly troubled by the pace of Mitchell Johnson.

Yuvraj was unable to return to form in both the home ODIs against West Indies and in the subsequent tour of South Africa, and was dropped for the New Zealand tour given the conditions in that country and the hosts&#x27; pace-heavy attack. He was not selected for 2014 Asia Cup in Bangladesh but he was selected for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 in the same place. In a Super 10 match against Pakistan he missed a full delivery and was bowled on his second ball by pacer Bilawal Bhatti. In the same match he dropped a catch that would have resulted in the wicket of Mohammad Hafeez, and later against the West Indies dropped a delivery hit by Chris Gayle.

Yuvraj then scored 60 off 43 balls against Australia at Mirpur, his eighth T20I fifty and third against Australia. His 84-run partnership with MS Dhoni is India&#x27;s third-highest for the fifth wicket.

On 5 July 2014, he played for the Rest of the World XI against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in the Bicentenary Celebration match at Lord&#x27;s, as he had been left out of India&#x27;s ODI team. Under Shane Warne&#x27;s captaincy, he struck a century at nearly a run a ball to rescue his team, who were struggling at 59 for 3. His 100 came up as he hit Sachin Tendulkar for a boundary. The Rest of the World finished on 293 for 7 after 50 overs, but the MCC went on to win the match by 7 wickets.

Yuvraj in an interview with Hindustan Times during his cancer treatment, said ‘Even if I die let India win World Cup’.

Notably, Singh was one of five senior members of India&#x27;s 2011 World Cup squad who were not considered for the 2015 Cricket World Cup and was not included in India&#x27;s 30-man probable list for the tournament.

===Late career===
Singh was picked in India&#x27;s T20I squad for the January 2016 Australia tour on the back of strong performances in Vijay Hazare Trophy, where he was the third-highest run scorer with 341 runs at an average of 85.25. He finished the three-match series with 15 runs after getting to bat in just one innings, while also taking two wickets. He played a crucial role in India&#x27;s titular run in Asia Cup 2016, often teaming up with Virat Kohli to take the team home. He was also a part of the Indian team in the ICC T20 World Cup 2016. He was not named in the T20I squad for India&#x27;s tour of West Indies in August. Meanwhile, he was named captain of the India Red side for the 2016–17 Duleep Trophy. His team lost to India Blue in the final.

Yuvraj was picked in India&#x27;s ODI squad for the home series against England in January 2017. This came on the back of his fine performances in the Ranji Trophy, having scored 672 runs in five games for Punjab, which included a 260 against Baroda. In the second match of the series, he scored his career best score 150, which came off 127 balls, a knock that included 21 fours and three sixes. He put on 256 runs for the fourth wicket along with Dhoni and helped the team post a total of 381. Following the team&#x27;s 15-run victory, he was named the Player of the Match.

Following the match, Singh revealed that he had thought of quitting after having been dropped from the team. He said, &quot;When I came back from cancer it was hard work. I was not performing and after being dropped I thought about whether I wanted to continue or not.&quot;

Yuvraj was selected to play in the Champions Trophy 2017. He scored 53 off 32 balls in a group stage match against Pakistan and won the man of the match award. However, as a result of failing to clear the yo-yo test, Yuvraj was dropped from the squad before the tour of Sri Lanka in August 2017 which ended his international career.

=== Retirement from international cricket ===
On 10 June 2019, Yuvraj Singh announced his retirement from international cricket. Yuvraj Singh held a press conference in Mumbai where he announced his decision to retire from all formats of the game. He said that he had decided to &quot;move on&quot;. Yuvraj recounted his best memories through his career, while also recalling his worst.

&quot;I would say I am extremely lucky to play 400-plus games for India. I would&#x27;ve not imagined doing this when I started my career in cricket. Through this journey, some matches that remain in my memory are - the 2002 NatWest series final, my first Test hundred in Lahore in 2004, the 2007 Test series in England, of course the six sixes and the 2007 T20 World Cup. And then the most memorable one was the 2011 World Cup finals.&quot;

&quot;And then, probably the worst day in my career, was the 2014 World T20 final against Lanka where I scored 11 off 21 balls. It was so shattering that I felt my career was over.&quot;

He also said &quot;As for now, I have decided to provide service and help for people affected by cancer.&quot;

==== Speculations of return ====
In September 2020, Yuvraj Singh hinted at making a return to the Punjab team and play domestic T20s for them. He said that it was on the suggestion of Punjab Cricket Association secretary Puneet Bali that he had considered to come out of retirement. However, his return was denied by the Punjab Cricket Association, as he had taken part in foreign franchise leagues.

==T20 franchise cricket==
===Indian Premier League===
Yuvraj was the icon player and captain for Indian Premier League (IPL) team Punjab Kings in the first two seasons; in 2010, the third season, icon player status was discontinued and the captaincy given to Kumar Sangakkara. Punjab Kings came second in the round-robin phase of the tournament, but lost the semi-finals to Chennai Super Kings. On 1 May 2009, Yuvraj registered his first hat-trick in T20 cricket against Royal Challengers Bangalore at Kingsmead in Durban, the same ground where he hit his six sixes. He dismissed Robin Uthappa, Mark Boucher and Jacques Kallis. On 17 May 2009, Yuvraj took his second Twenty20 hat-trick against Deccan Chargers at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. Yuvraj dismissed Herschelle Gibbs, Andrew Symonds and Venugopal Rao.

The Pune Warriors India were a new team introduced for the 2011 IPL. Yuvraj Singh was bought by the team and chosen as captain. Pune Warriors finished ninth, ahead of only the Delhi Capitals. From 14 matches, Yuvraj took 11 wickets and also scored 343 runs at an average of 34.30, including two half-centuries. After much controversy, the BCCI allowed Pune Warriors to find a replacement for Yuvraj for the 2012 Indian Premier League, citing his medical condition and non-availability for 2012 IPL as the reasons for doing so.

In 2014, Yuvraj was bought by the Royal Challengers Bangalore for 14 crore. A Kingfisher employee union sent a letter to Yuvraj requesting him not to play for Royal Challengers Bangalore. He had a successful stint with RCB, scoring 376 runs and taking six wickets. In 2015, he was bought by Delhi Capitals for Rs.16 Crores, the highest ever bid at an IPL auction. at the time.

In the 2016 IPL auction he was bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs.7 crores. He had a very successful IPL campaign with the Sunrisers Hyderabad with them winning the 2016 Indian Premier League. He played several crucial knocks at crunch moments, and some experts called him the &quot;Unsung hero of SRH&#x27;s titular run&quot;. Yuvraj scored 38 runs from 23 balls in the final.

Yuvraj was retained by Sunrisers Hyderabad for the 2017 Indian Premier League.

In the 2018 IPL auction, he was picked by Punjab Kings for base price of 2 crores. He scored only 64 runs from 6 innings at a low average of 12.80. He batted at four different positions during those six innings and was not given a consistent run by the team management.

Yuvraj was released by Kings XI Punjab ahead of the 2019 IPL Auction, where was purchased by Mumbai Indians for his base price of ₹1 crore. He scored 53 in his debut match for Mumbai Indians, and smashed a hattrick of sixes against Yuzvendra Chahal in the next match, but he wasn&#x27;t given a longer run by the team management, and was dropped after he failed in the next two matches. He was released by the Mumbai Indians ahead of the 2020 IPL auction.

===Other leagues===
In June 2019, Yuvraj was selected to play for the Toronto Nationals franchise team in the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament. He also played for the Maratha Arabians in the Abu Dhabi T10 League in 2019. In 2020, Yuvraj played in the Ultimate Kricket Challenge.

==Playing style==
Yuvraj is primarily a left-handed batsman but can bowl part-time left-arm orthodox spin, which he improved in the latter part of his career. He is regarded as a better batsman against fast bowling than spin bowling, and cites the Indian Oil Cup 2005 as a turning point in his career. Yuvraj is one of the athletic fielders in the Indian team, fielding primarily at point &amp; covers with a good aim at the stumps. Yuvraj is a natural stroke player with an aggressive style of play, as seen by his strike rate of above 150 in T20 internationals &amp; just below 90 in ODIs. Many regard him as one of the best clean strikers of the ball, with his trademark punch through the covers a treat to watch. When in good touch, he can clear the ropes quite effortlessly. An ESPNcricinfo report published in late 2005 showed that since 1999, he was the fourth most prolific fielder in affecting ODI run outs, and of those on the list of prolific fielders, he had the second highest rate of effecting a run out.

<text>HMAS &quot;Echuca&quot; (J252/M252), named for the town of Echuca, Victoria, was one of 60 s constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Echuca&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Echuca&quot; was laid down by HMA Naval Dockyard at Williamstown, Victoria on 22 February 1941. She was launched on 17 January 1942 by Lady Royle, wife of First Naval Member Sir Guy Royle, and commissioned into the RAN on 7 September 1942.

==Operational history==

===World War II===
&quot;Echuca&quot;’s initial role was as an anti-submarine patrol and convoy escort vessel along the eastern Australia coast and in New Guinea waters. She stayed in this role from October 1942 until August 1944, when she was ordered to Darwin and attached to the United States Seventh Fleet&#x27;s Survey Group. She performed survey duties until the end of World War II, when she was refitted with minesweeping gear in Brisbane and assigned to the 20th Minesweeping Flotilla. The Flotilla was responsible for clearing minefields set up in the waters of Australia, New Guinea, New Britain, and the Solomon Islands.

&quot;Echuca&quot; received the battle honours &quot;Pacific 1942–44&quot; and &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot; for her wartime service.

&quot;Echuca&quot; was paid off into Reserve in August 1946, but recommissioned in January 1947 for mine clearance work in the Great Barrier Reef. The corvette performed this duty until August 1947, and in November 1947 towed the decommissioned corvette to Sydney. &quot;Echuca&quot; was decommissioned again in Fremantle on 29 June 1948. At the end of April 1952, the corvette was sailed to Melbourne.

===RNZN service===
On 5 March 1952, &quot;Echuca&quot; and three other &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes (HMA Ships &quot;Inverell&quot;, , and ) were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN). She was commissioned into the RNZN in May 1952, and received the prefix HMNZS.

The corvette remained in service with the RNZN until 1967, although from 1953 she was classified as being in reserve. She was sold to Pacific Scrap Limited of Auckland for scrapping on 11 April 1967.

<text>Creative Micro Designs, Inc. (CMD) was founded in 1987 by Doug Cotton and Mark Fellows. It is a computer technology company which originally developed and sold products for the Commodore 64 and C128 8-bit personal computers. After 2001 it sold PCs and related equipment.

==History==
CMD&#x27;s first product, JiffyDOS, was developed from 1985 onwards by Mark Fellows. An updated disk operating system, it maintained broad compatibility with Commodore floppy drives&#x27; DOS while offering much increased read-write access.

CMD stopped selling Commodore products in 2001. In July of that year, programmer Maurice Randal was sold an exclusive license to produce and sell the Commodore-related products. His company Click Here Software Co supplied the products until around 2009.

In 2010, Jim Brain acquired the license to supply JiffyDOS. Since January of that year, he has sold the product via his webshop Retro Innovations.

<doc id="438722" wikidata="Q7836942" url="?curid=438722" title="Treaty Oak (Austin, Texas)">
<text>The Treaty Oak is a Texas live oak tree in Austin, Texas, United States, and the last surviving member of the Council Oaks, a grove of 14 trees that served as a sacred meeting place for Comanche and Tonkawa tribes before European colonization of the area. Foresters estimate the Treaty Oak to be about 500 years old. Before its vandalism in 1989, the tree&#x27;s branches had a spread of . The tree is located in Treaty Oak Park, on Baylor Street between 5th and 6th Streets, in Austin&#x27;s West Line Historic District.

==History and legends==
===Legends===
A Native American legend holds that Council Oaks was a location for launching war and peace parties. Legends also describe that Hasinai women would drink a tea made from honey and the acorns of the oaks to ensure the safety of warriors in battle.

According to popular local folklore, as well as the inscription on the plaque at the tree&#x27;s base, in the 1830s, early Texas pioneer Stephen F. Austin met local Native Americans in the grove to negotiate and sign Texas&#x27;s first boundary treaty after two children and a local judge were killed in raids. No historical documentation exists to support this event taking place. Folklore also holds that Sam Houston rested beneath the Treaty Oak after being deposed as Governor of Texas by the secessionist state legislature at the start of Texas&#x27;s involvement in the American Civil War.

===History===
As more and more European-Americans colonized Texas, Council Oaks fell victim to neglect and the development of Austin. By 1927 only one of the original 14 trees remained. The American Forestry Association proclaimed the tree a perfect specimen of a North American tree and inducted the Treaty Oak into its Hall of Fame.

Beginning in the 1880s, the tree was privately owned by the Caldwell family in Austin. Because she could no longer afford to pay property taxes on the land, in 1926, the widow of W.H. Caldwell offered the land for sale for $7,000. While local historical groups urged the Texas Legislature to buy the land, it appropriated no funds. In 1937, the City of Austin purchased the land for $1,000 and installed a plaque honoring the tree&#x27;s role in the history of Texas.

==Vandalism==
In 1989, in a deliberate act of vandalism, the tree was poisoned with the powerful hardwood herbicide Velpar. Lab tests showed the quantity of herbicide used would have been sufficient to kill 100 trees. The incident sparked community outrage, national news reports, and a torrent of homemade &quot;Get Well&quot; cards from children that were displayed on the fence around the park. Texas industrialist Ross Perot wrote a blank check to fund efforts to save the tree. DuPont, the herbicide manufacturer, established a $10,000 reward to capture the poisoner. The vandal, Paul Cullen, was apprehended after reportedly bragging about poisoning the tree to cast a spell. Cullen was convicted of felony criminal mischief and sentenced to serve nine years in prison.

The intensive effort to save the Treaty Oak included applying sugar to the root zone, replacing soil around its roots, and installing a system to mist the tree with spring water. Although arborists expected the tree to die, the Treaty Oak survived. Still, almost two-thirds of the tree died, and more than half of its crown was pruned.

==Later events==
In 1997, the Treaty Oak produced its first crop of acorns since the vandalism. City workers gathered and germinated the acorns, distributing the seedlings throughout Texas and other states. Today, the tree is a thriving, although lopsided, reminder of its once-grand form. Many Texans see the Treaty Oak as a symbol of strength and endurance. In January 2009, the Texas chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture partnered with the Austin Parks and Recreation Department to do maintenance pruning of the Treaty Oak.

<doc id="438726" wikidata="Q8027352" url="?curid=438726" title="Wisconsin Walleye War">
<text>The Wisconsin Walleye War became the name for late 20th-century events in Wisconsin in protest of Ojibwe (Chippewa) hunting and fishing rights. In a 1975 case, the tribes challenged state efforts to regulate their hunting and fishing off the reservations, based on their rights in the treaties of St. Peters (1837) and La Pointe (1842). On August 21, 1987, U.S. District Court judge Barbara Crabb ruled that six Ojibwe tribal governments had the right under these treaties for hunting and fishing throughout their former territory.

Protests erupted in Wisconsin among sports fishermen and resort owners who were opposed to tribal members spearfishing walleye during spawning season. Protests continued into 1991 against the Ojibwe walleye harvests. Tribal supporters successfully petitioned federal courts to issue an injunction against the protesters, curbing the protest events at boat landings.

The events were chronicled in a &quot;Mother Jones&quot; 1991 article, books published in 1994 and 2002, and the documentary film &quot;Lighting the Seventh Fire&quot; (1995).

==Background of court cases==
During the 1970s, American Indian activism increased on a number of fronts, in terms of land claims, treaty rights, and tribal sovereignty to exercise traditional practices. This particular conflict started in 1973, when two members of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of the Ojibwe Nation crossed a reservation boundary that divided Chief Lake, cut a hole in the ice, and harvested fish with spears, contrary to Wisconsin state laws. In a class taught by attorney Larry Leventhal, the members had learned their band held by treaty an unresolved claim to off-reservation hunting and fishing rights in the northern part of the state. The members were arrested and a Sawyer County judge convicted them under state law of poaching, as they were fishing out of season.

The Lac Courte Oreilles band joined the legal fight on behalf of the two tribal members, contending that they had the right to fish off the reservation without restrictions because of mid-19th-century treaties made by the bands with the U.S. government; at the time, the bands ceded hundreds of thousands of acres of land to the U.S. The case was heard in U.S. District Court as it related to treaty rights. This court upheld the band&#x27;s treaty rights to traditional hunting and fishing throughout its former territories, without regulation by the state. The state appealed, and the Seventh Court of Appeals&#x27; decision also upheld the rights of the Ojibwe. The state appealed again, but the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the state&#x27;s argument to reverse the lower court decision. After the highest court refused to reverse, five other Ojibwe bands joined the Lac Courte Oreilles&#x27; legal action. The Seventh Circuit sent the case back to U.S. District Court with instructions for the court to determine the scope of the treaty rights and to resolve conflicts related to regulation of off-reservation resources.

On August 21, 1987, the U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Crabb ruled that six Ojibwe tribal governments had the right under these federal treaties for hunting and fishing throughout their former territories. In settling questions about regulation of off-reservation hunting and fishing, Judge Crabb ruled the state could intervene to protect natural resources, but that tribes had the right first to establish their own regulatory system. This could prevail if they showed the court their system was as protective of the resource as was the state&#x27;s system. After detailed scientific testimony, Crabb approved a natural resource code adopted by the six tribal governments, which allowed members to harvest walleye and other fish using traditional methods during the spawning season, when lakes are closed to state-licensed anglers.

==Conflict==
By late April 1988 of the spring spearfishing season, residents and visitors of Park Falls, Wisconsin, rallied at Butternut Lake. A band of fishers were led by Tom Maulson, a former judge and council member of the Lac du Flambeau Band. The crowd pressed against the fishers, the tribal wardens, and the few state game wardens, pushing them toward the water. Local police declined to render aid, and the standoff lasted until a convoy of officers was brought from Superior, almost distant. They made their way through the crowd to rescue the fishers and game wardens.

With the opening of the 1989 fishing season, the Ojibwe and other interested groups wondered what would take place. Governor Tommy Thompson, a Republican, mobilized the state&#x27;s Division of Emergency Government to form a Treaty Rights Task Force. He ordered them to find a way to keep the peace. Dressed in riot gear, police stood shoulder to shoulder, often three deep, with sticks and shields ready to stop the crowd if they pressed past snow fences hastily erected for crowd control.

During the spring walleye spawning seasons of 1989, 1990, and 1991, the task force deployed hundreds of police officers from around the state to help local sheriffs maintain order at lakes where Ojibwe members began exercising their newly reaffirmed rights. Hundreds of protesters lined boat landings to make their case that tribal members enjoyed &quot;special rights&quot; under Crabb&#x27;s decision. They shouted offensive slogans and sometimes threw rocks at the tribal fishers and the protection officials. At protests and in Park Falls itself, white townspeople disseminated racist propaganda, including posters with a mock advertisement for an &quot;Indian Shoot&quot; (which also included racist sentiment against Black, Hmong, and Cuban people), t-shirts and posters with the slogan &quot;Save a Walleye, Spear an Indian&quot; on them, and Ojibwe being lynched in effigy. To disrupt the fishing, protesters launched boats and circled the fishers at high speed, trying to upend the Ojibwe fishers, who were standing in boats to spear fish by lamplight. Other protesters joined mass arrests, at least one of which degraded into a melee when police moved to seize sound amplification devices from protest leaders.

In 1989, pro-treaty groups organized as the Midwest Treaty Network in support of the Ojibwe fishing families. Activists such as Walter Bresette of the Red Cliff Band from northern Wisconsin and Minneapolis–St. Paul asked witnesses to document by video the anti-Indian harassment and violence at the boat landings. He issued &quot;Witness for Nonviolence Reports&quot; in 1990 and 1991. Convoys of activists from the American Indian Movement in Minneapolis also joined the protests, playing native drums to sound above emergency power generators and protesters&#x27; chants.

==Resolution==
Protests subsided in 1991 as a result of developments on several fronts.

On April 10, 1990, the first day of spearing season the previous year, Governor Tommy Thompson signed a bill authorizing a fine of as much as $1,000 for anyone preventing Ojibwe from spearfishing.

During the spring of 1991, because of a late thaw, the Vilas County Sheriff imposed weight limits on county roads that prohibited travel by the heavy satellite news vehicles sent by local and national TV news departments to cover the protests. Protesters could show up, but there was no chance of being interviewed on camera. Seeing a significant drop in heightened emotion at the boat landings. During the following years, weight limits were again imposed at the same time as spearing season.

The Lake of the Torches Casino in nearby Lac du Flambeau had recently opened. Many who lived on the reservation now had full time jobs at the gaming establishment and stopped their participation in spearing fish for fear of losing their jobs if they were absent.

Dean Crist, head of the &quot;Stop Treaty Abuse&quot;, and Tom Maulson, tribal chairman from Lac du Flambeau were interviewed on camera, not at the boat landings, but outside their places of business during the day with no protests in the background.

Judge Crabb issued an injunction against the &quot;Stop Treaty Abuse&quot; group for physically harassing and blocking the exercise of treaty rights by the Lac du Flambeau Ojibwe.

The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission reported that the Ojibwe speared only 3% of the walleye in treaty-ceded territory. By this time, protest leaders had lost considerable prestige by reports of their groups&#x27; racially motivated chants, gunshots, bombings, and frequent rock throwing and slingshot attacks. Also in 1991, the newly elected Wisconsin Attorney General, James Doyle, reached an agreement with the six tribes by which neither the state nor the Ojibwe would further appeal the federal court rulings.

The state legislature passed a hunters&#x27; protection law and a law requiring schools statewide to include information about local tribes in history and geography curricula. This included an explanation of the treaty rights they had acquired in exchange for ceding hundreds of thousands of acres of land to the U.S., which benefited countless European-American settlers. Later in the 1990s, some of those sportfishing groups that had originally opposed Native American fishing rights, worked with northern Wisconsin tribes to protect the fish from industry plans for metallic sulfide mining, particularly the Crandon mine.

As a result of the protests, a team of federal, state, and tribal biologists formed the Joint Assessment Steering Committee in 1990 to analyze the impact of sportfishing and spearfishing on walleye populations. More than 20 years of research by the panel of fisheries biologists has shown that the walleye resource is not harmed by spring spearing, noting that only 9% of the tribal harvest is made up of females.

==In popular culture==
The treaty rights fishing battles captured national attention from media, including the political magazine &quot;Mother Jones&quot;. The events, issues, and people were explored in &quot;Lighting the Seventh Fire&quot;, a 1995 documentary film made by Sandra Osawa and broadcast nationally on PBS on July 4, 1995. The title refers to an Ojibwe prophecy about the seventh fire, when the people&#x27;s traditions will be revived after a time of trial.

Two books have also been written about the events. The bands&#x27; legal challenges are considered to be part of a renewal of activism since the late 20th century by Native American tribes to exercise their treaty rights, pursue land claims, exercise rights to traditional hunting and fishing when not explicitly addressed in a treaty, and exercise sovereignty.

<text>The Green armies (), also known as the Green Army (Зелёная Армия, &quot;Zelonaya Armiya&quot;) or Greens (Зелёные, &quot;Zelonyye&quot;), were armed peasant groups which fought against all governments in the Russian Civil War from 1918 to 1922. The Green armies were semi-organized local militias that opposed the Bolsheviks, Whites, and foreign interventionists, and fought to protect their communities from requisitions or reprisals carried out by third parties. The Green armies were politically and ideologically neutral, but at times associated with the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. The Green armies had at least tacit support throughout much of Russia. However, their primary base, the peasantry, were largely reluctant to wage an active campaign during the Russian Civil War and, with an impending Bolshevik victory, dissolved in 1922.

== Background ==
The Russian peasantry lived through two wars against the Russian state, the product of revolutions that ended with state victory: 1905-1907 and 1917-1922. At the beginning of 1918 the Bolshevik Party only controlled a few cities, &quot;unique Bolshevik islets in the middle of a peasant ocean&quot; unwilling to hand over the fruits of their labor and submit to any external authority.

The conflict between the cities and a countryside was one of the main edges of the civil war. This resistance was interpreted by many as a mere expression of the &quot;social anarchy&quot; that existed in the country. The Communist influence on the peasants and workers was negligible. The Bolsheviks controlled some soviets, but without coercive power over the majority of the population, who opposed them in a passive and disorganized way.

Between late 1917 and early 1918 there was no serious opposition to the Bolsheviks, who controlled central Russia, Baku and Tashkent. The only opposition force was the Volunteer Army (Russian: &quot; Добровольческая армия &quot;), barely 3,000 men, still organized in southern Russia. All the White movement&#x27;s hopes were on winning over the Don and Kuban Cossacks, who were initially more interested in obtaining their own independence. For their part, Ukraine and Finland were in the process of becoming independent, but the Whites refused to recognize their secession. Only the violent Bolshevik repression of the Cossacks in early 1918 made it possible to win them over to the White cause.

After the October Revolution, the new Bolshevik authorities enacted a policy of war communism. This system sought to abolish all private enterprise, maximize state control over distribution and the foreign market, nationalize all heavy industry, requisition agricultural surplus, and impose a universal rationing system to focus the entire economy on supporting the war effort. It was a way of fighting their opponents on the &quot;home front&quot;. Among the new measures was the dispatch of officials to the farms of central Russia to collect supplies for the Red Army and start the construction of the socialist economy, by any means necessary. The aim was to requisition grain, cattle and horses, recruit young people to the army, and punish villages suspected of harboring deserters.

The farmers&#x27; first reaction was to bury their grain, feed it to cattle, or clandestinely distill it into alcohol. In response, the Bolsheviks organized a &#x27;supply army&#x27; of 80,000 men tasked with forcibly requisitioning grain surpluses. Half were unemployed workers from Petrograd who were looking for a fixed salary and to keep some of the loot. The rest were criminals, other unemployed and ex-soldiers. They formed undisciplined troops, known as &quot;prodotriady&quot; (), who did not hesitate to steal vital reserves, seed and other possessions from the peasants. The &quot;prodotriady&quot; were killed at an increasing rate: 2,000 in 1918, 5,000 in 1919, and 8,000 in 1920. The Bolsheviks retaliated by burning villages, confiscating livestock, and executing peasants by the hundreds. Many were accused of being &quot;kulaks&quot; but most were poor farmers, the most vulnerable to poor harvests. People fled to the forests with nothing to lose and joined the rebels to defend the &quot;local peasant revolution&quot;. Thus, what in most cases began as small revolts against the requisitions, the incompetent and brutal response of the local Communists turned into large rebellions.

The first collectivizations also generated great resistance due to forced transfers and the new ways of life that were imposed. Many units and inspectors exceeded their powers, looting houses and murdering villagers. They harshly repressed any sign of resistance. All of this contributed to widespread resentment against the new regime. The Bolsheviks understood that they had to control the grain supply and, in order not to depend on the small farmers, they tried to found Kolkhoz (cooperatives) and Sovkhoz (state farms). Another source of the peasantry&#x27;s rejection of the Bolsheviks was the abolition of the Committees of Poor Peasants or &quot; komitety bednoty &quot; () in December 1918, but Lenin had foreseen fierce resistance and increased both the size of the &quot;prodotriady&quot; and the tax requirement. The following season, some 242 million &quot;pud&quot; of grain was requisitioned.

== Objectives ==
At the outbreak of the February Revolution, the most important political parties were the Social Revolutionary Party, Mensheviks, and Kadets. The first two controlled most of the country&#x27;s soviets, except the ones in Petrograd and Moscow; the third were liberals with the support of moderate sectors who wanted to maintain the freedoms won with the revolution. The Mensheviks quickly lost the support of many soviets, except in the Caucasus, and especially in the Democratic Republic of Georgia, while Bolshevik influence rapidly grew. The peasants were overwhelmingly in favour of the SR. In some cases, as in Western Siberia in 1920–1921, the rebellious peasants began their revolts without any proposal or plan more complex than overthrowing the Bolsheviks (consequently, Bolsheviks who fell into their hands were assassinated and government or Party buildings razed). Only as some successful movements became more complex and territorially broad did the Greens present a political program, an adaptation of SR ideas.

Russia rapidly polarized during 1917. Very soon, large masses of the population were in favor of smaller and less organized revolutionary groups than the Bolsheviks, the anarchists and Left SRs. The Great War had encouraged the peasants and workers to follow a revolutionary path, so Lenin proposed to turn the &quot;imperialist war&quot; into a &quot;civil war.&quot;

=== Agricultural distribution ===
The greens were driven by the ideal of the SR &quot;black division&quot;, &quot;a division of all lands according to the number of mouths to be fed in each family&quot;, not for the broader nationalization and collectivization of the lands as presented by the Bolsheviks. In Lenin&#x27;s eyes there was nothing socialist about this measure, believing the plan of the SRs would be to establish capitalism in the countryside. This was seen as avoiding concrete Socialist policy, instituting basic programs such as improvements to peasant quality of life and an end to slavery. According to him, it was no more than a bourgeois slogan, just like &quot;land and liberty&quot;, to appeal to the desperate peasantry of rural Russia. Another source of opposition from the population towards the Bolsheviks was the &quot;way of life Communist leaders&#x27; feudal system,” with the excesses of Bolshevik leaders in contrast to the horrors of the civil war producing resentment from the impoverished and war-torn peasantry.

The ideology of the Greens was very uniform, representing the common aspirations and goals of peasant revolutions in Russia and Ukraine. They wanted to regain the self-government maintained until 1918, seize the nobility&#x27;s lands, maintain rural market-economies and govern their communities with soviets chosen by them. The peasants rejected the growing authority that the new state was gaining. Four years after the Revolution they watched as the Soviet state centralized, with the autonomy of their Soviets integrated into the growing organs of the state. Their own small agricultural holdings were replaced by large state collectivizations, with the product produced on their farms requisitioned and the land promised to them in the Revolution occupied by the State. With these worries and concerns growing, they began to accept the SR proposals: the end of Bolshevik rule, land redistribution and an end to the civil war. Their opposition to the Bolsheviks was due to, rather than a political plan or national alternative, a desire to protect and preserve their communal land. Interested in defending local interests, these movements took a defensive stance: incapable and unwilling to march on Moscow, they hoped to remove the Bolshevik state&#x27;s central influence.

=== Rejection of the Whites ===

The greens were always hostile to the Whites, which is why their uprisings against the reds only became massive after ensuring the defeat of the Whites. Many White officers were members of the former Tsarist Nobility, and had lost the land they had or could inherit in the peasant revolution of 1917. With deeply entrenched classism against the peasants they once ruled over, the Whites sought to turn back time and take revenge against every symbol of change. They would never recognize new national realities or the attempts at agrarian revolution.

One of the main causes of the White defeat was being identified by the people with the restoration of the old regime, signaled by the treatment that their officers and officials gave to the peasants. With their deeply reactionary positions desire to restore the old Tsarist social and economic order aggressive repression and rejection of the Peasant base and refusal to carry out even basic reforms demanded by the circumstances The Whites could not take advantage of the countryside&#x27;s hesitance towards the Reds and win it for their cause. They refused to reform land ownership, stoking the fears of the rural majority against the prior regime and failing to take the possibly decisive advantage of rural support. That is why many peasants feared that the Whites would restore the rights of the rural nobility to the land, destroying the autonomy and local representation that they&#x27;d won in the Revolution of 1917. Faced with this fear, many peasants joined the reds when the Whites advanced on the districts of Orel and Moscow in 1919. They had through their efforts been the ones who had secured the most land from the nobility. According to SR politicians, if Alexander Kolchak had not restored the rights of landowners, he would have won greater support of farmers in the Urals and the Volga.

The robberies and massacres at the hands of the Cossack cavalry also contributed to turning the countryside against the White advance in 1919. Denikin proved unable to contain the violence. The best White troops were from the Kuban, the Don and the Caucasus, as the Cossacks were the main a source of men and resources for the Whites. When they realized that Denikin was defeated, they wanted to return to their homes en masse, seeing greater benefit in negotiating their own autonomy with the Communists. Despite everything, Denikin cracked down on the rights of the unions and returned the factories to their former owners, sparking the hatred and resistance of the workers. The Whites, unable to effectively contain the unrest, resorted to greater repression and terror. Like Kolchak, Denikin failed to create his own local government structure, resorting to repression to try to mobilize the population and its resources under his control. With these being something decisive in any modern civil or total war, he attempted to tap into these possible resources but the terror proved not to be enough to spurn the territories they held. Alongside this, it was unable to counteract the critical waste and bleed of already present supply. When the Military aid from their western allies was reduced, White soldiers had to loot for supplies, only further stoking the rage and fear of the local populace.

Finally, they failed to properly capitalize on the propaganda front. To the Whites, the peasants had a duty to serve in their armies, based primarily on the old structure of the Tsarist regime. Due to this, they saw no reason in convincing or aligning those they conscripted. On the other hand, the Bolsheviks knew how to use the symbolism of the revolution, proclaiming themselves the defenders of peasantry and smaller farmers. Paradoxically, many White commanders waited for a popular uprising against the Bolsheviks to obtain victory, but usually most of the population was hostile to both sides and indifferent to who won the war. Wrangel was the only White general to realize the mistake. He knew that the war would not be won without successfully winning over the peasants, workers and national minorities to their side. Despite this, his subordinates in Crimea behaved like an occupying army, perpetrating all manner of arbitrariness and institutionalizing corruption.

=== Cooperation with other groups ===
The Greens collaborated several times with other opposition groups, such as anarchists and SRs, in a more strategic than ideological effort against the Reds. White deserters joined their cause and came to lead bands of peasants, which served as a pretext for the Bolsheviks to exaggerate the relations between the two elements. More likely to follow aggressive rhetoric and promises of violent revenge, peasants tended to reject leaders with purely political or more moderate goals, that is, any close to the Russian Provisional Government of 1917. &quot;They prefer to fight a desperate and lonely war on their own, rather than to help the oppressors of the past [the Whites] defeat the oppressors of the present [the reds].”

== Organisation ==
A union network emerged in the villages, replacing the Soviets and helping provide supplies to the rebels. Each village was responsible for mobilizing, feeding and equipping their own units. The Church and the local SRs, mainly from the left, were key in the organization of the movements. For example, in West Siberia the SRs led the revolts and although there was a central authority in Tobolsk, it had little to no control of the Bolshevik-free territory. Because of this, essentially every &quot;volost&quot; was self-governed. In contrast, the Siberian movement demonstrated a high level of organization and even installed an administration in the cities it captured (the guerrillas of Tambov were unable to seize cities but also created a complex administrative network in the countryside); on the contrary, the Makhnovists were present in both countryside and cities, maintaining a loose and autonomous administration in line with Anarchist ideology.

At the beginning of 1920, when the Red victory was practically assured after the defeat of the armies of Anton Denikin, Nikolai Yudenich and Aleksandr Kolchak, continued requisitioning came to be viewed as more and more unjustifiable. Numerous contingents of peasant soldiers, usually having connections and sympathy with the Peasantry, refused to repress the green uprisings and defected, forming their own &quot;green&quot; guerrillas in the forests. In 1919-1921 most of the guerrillas were deserters, including the leaders, with many in positions of leadership being veterans of the fight against the Whites. Alongside this, White Holdouts described as &quot;little White dabbling&quot; continued to fight until 1922, however were described to be &quot;more like a permanent hindrance than a real threat.” Officially two and a half million soldiers were demobilized in 1921, with many returning to their homes and joining the Greens, worsening the situation for the central government, as there were 250,000 in Tambov alone.

However, by that time both Greens and Blacks could only dream of damaging the Red Army, with its experience and size making it a true &quot;military giant&quot;, although their armed forces (undermined by desertions) never reached official figures. They claimed; the Bolsheviks had tried to realize the French revolutionary ideal of a &quot;nation in arms&quot; and failed. There were just over a million red soldiers at the end of 1918, 3 million in 1919, 5 million at the end of 1920, and 6 million in 1921. They were mainly forcibly recruited peasants. There was resistance among the Communists to the massive recruitment of peasants. For many, their army of loyal workers would become a force largely made up of an element that was alien and hostile to them, a possible enemy. According to the British historian Orlando Figes, at the climax of the civil war Lenin played pragmatically into the Red Army&#x27;s advantages, in the form of a better organized but smaller army. Optimally disciplined, equipped and supplied, the force exerted less pressure on Rural areas by demanding less requisitions or levies and causing fewer peasant rebellions. They would also put less pressure on factory workers. Furthermore, it would not be made up mainly of peasants but rather workers, more loyal and motivated to fight for the reds.

The massive desertion as a phenomenon that affected the entire Red Army indicates that the peasantry were hesitant to serve in it. With many still having rural farms or villages to return to, many deserted during periods of Harvest, with spikes in desertion being indicated by season. During 1918 more than a million soldiers deserted, the following year the figure increased to 2 million, and in 1921 there were almost 4 million. Between 1919 and 1920 3 million men deserted. In 1919, these fugitive &quot;green deserters&quot; numbered more than one million in the territory under Bolshevik control alone, and although trace amounts went on to serve with the Whites, most fought in heavily wooded areas near their own homes against authorities from both sides. Detachments were sent to villages near the battlefront and families suspected of harboring deserters were punished with fines, confiscation of livestock and land, the seizure of hostages, executing community leaders and even burning whole villages to the ground. The special commissions ordered by the Cheka with pursuing them captured 500,000 deserters in 1919 and 600,000 to 800,000 in 1920. Thousands were shot and their families deported, but 1.5 to 2 million avoided capture.

The mass desertions started much earlier. From the Kerensky Offensive to the October Revolution two million soldiers abandoned their positions and returned to their homes. The Tsarist army that was 10,000,000 strong had been defeated by shattered morale in its ranks and the weakness of its institutions, with millions returned to their farms. That same year, 1917, a massive demobilization was decreed. Many of these deserters were peasants, &quot;the Imperial Army was a peasant army&quot;, who called themselves Marxists, despite lacking knowledge or understanding of the ideology. Their &quot;&quot;trenches Bolshevism&quot; reflected above all an aspiration for peace, shared by the combatants of all the countries involved for three years in the most deadly and total wars.” More than 2 million of their comrades had perished fighting the Central Powers. Many supported the Bolsheviks in 1917 because they promised an assured peace, but due to the outbreak of the civil war, the peasants were very reluctant to be recruited. During the civil war, the desire for peace in the face of devastation led many communities to declare themselves &quot;neutral republics&quot; to prevent the red or White armies from entering their territories.

It&#x27;s possible that the Reds never gathered more than half a million &quot;equipped soldiers&quot; at any one time. After capturing Kazan in a five-day struggle, the Bolsheviks stopped retreating and began to reap successes thanks to the cemented centralization of command and a mass wave of recruits. It quickly had to face mass desertions between June 1919 and June 1920. About 2,700,000 men were recruited, with almost all of this figure deserting except 60,000 troops. In August 1920, the Reds had no more than 700,000 combatants, less than 500,000 active, with 2,250,000 as reservists in training, 391,000 in reserve units and 159,000 in labor units, wounded, sick or deserters. The greens were always more numerous than the Whites. In concrete figures, Yudenich commanded 30,000 Whites, Kolchak 120,000 and Denikin around 150,000; by comparison, the Greens numbered over half a million during 1919. According to Western intelligence services, in September of that year the Bolsheviks were holding out with 120,000 soldiers in the Urals (eastern front), 180,000 in the &quot;Chernozem&quot; region (southern front), 35,000 in Pskov (northern front) and 130,000 in Belarus (western front). In July 1918, there were 40 to 50 thousand &quot;international combatants&quot;, made up of Chinese, Romanian, Polish, Czech and Austro-Hungarian leftists, not including the Latvian Rifles.

The Bolshevik forces were militarily fragile, as proven after the Battle of Warsaw, where Lenin&#x27;s project to expand the revolution to Berlin or Budapest and then further west by military invasion was ultimately fruitless. Westerners wanted to surround Russia with a belt that prevented the further spread of Marxist and Leftist fervor, with a strong independent Poland being key in that plan and acting as one of the causes of the Polish-Soviet war: first encouraging Polish expansionism to the east, after stoking the Russian nationalism that the Bolsheviks knew how to take advantage of, and finally motivating Lenin to try to break this belt and overwhelm the new order founded in Versailles. The red soldiers were unable to defeat the newborn Polish army, ensuring that they would be unable to compete with the established and powerful industrial countries of central and western Europe. The failure to spread the Revolution across Europe would spurn on internal debate within the Bolsheviks, with Bukharin and Stalin later formulating the dominant theory of socialism in one country.

Within this Red Army, the special units of the Cheka and the &quot;internal defense troops of the Republic&quot; stood out, with 200,000 members in 1921. In the wake of the Revolution, they were the main repressive organs of the fledgling Soviet State. Due to the small number of regular soldiers at the disposal of all sides, the armies that were in the Russian battlefields were very small - tens of thousands in the largest battles - compared to those used in the World War I. Volunteers were scarce and undisciplined, forcing Soviet commanders to recruit peasants, a social group that Soviet military leadership considered unreliable. This was coupled with increased pressure towards requisitions, which only contributed to the formation of new peasant guerrillas.

== Leadership ==
Besides Soviet records of their oppositional activity, there is very little personal information about the Green leaders, described as &quot;men who acted and wrote not&quot; due to the widespread illiteracy and spontaneous nature of their movement (85% of the population was illiterate in 1917). In order to build substantial forces, a motivated individual would lead a group of soldiers through the countryside, enlisting village inhabitants and deserters from the Red Army along the way. The leaders would enter a village and make an announcement, employing simple messages and vague, reactionary goals in their rhetoric to rouse enthusiasm. They often exaggerated Bolshevik weakness and opposition victories as a means to convince listeners to join. By keeping the objectives simple, the recruitment indiscriminate, and the mood optimistic, Green leaders succeeded in provoking a sense among the peasants that they could make a significant dent in Bolshevik power. They also drew support from disillusioned urban and railroad workers, who had &quot;fled back to the villages&quot; and informed the peasants about the horrendous working conditions of developing industry. Among these atamans were Aleksandr Antonov, Nykyfor Hryhoriv, Danylo Terpylo and Nestor Makhno.

==Constituents, leadership and goals==
Despite Soviet attempts to associate the Green armies with White leadership, such a designation overemphasizes the political aspects of the movement. In a broad sense, the Green armies were spontaneous manifestations of peasant discontent rather than of any specific ideology. By 1920, the Bolsheviks had secured victory over the Whites. The peasant soldiers of the Red Army, outraged at the prospect of continuing to violently oppress their own class in the interest of the new government, deserted and consolidated in groups in the forests, eventually leading to their &quot;Green&quot; designation. While these groups primarily opposed the Bolsheviks, they often did so without a plan or alternative form of government in mind; rather, they simply wanted to rid the countryside of Bolshevik influence by any means necessary.

== Peasant Wars ==
The revolts varied greatly from one another, however, the Soviets tended to classify them into two main categories: &quot;bunt&quot;, a specific, brief revolt with few participants; and &quot;vostante&quot;, an insurrection of thousands of peasants, capable of conquering cities and giving themselves a coherent political program, usually of a social-revolutionary type, as in Tambov, or anarchist, like the peasant armies of Makhno.

=== First revolts ===
Among the initial movements would be the Livny rebellion, easily put down during August 1918. Also included is the Izhevsk–Votkinsk Uprising of that year and what is considered the first true &quot;vostante&quot;, the Chapan rebellion, which broke out on the banks of the Volga, in the districts of Karsun, Syzran, Sengilei and Stavropol in 1919.

It should be mentioned that the Kuban and Don Cossacks and the tribes of Caucasus rose up in 1920, forming their own peasant guerrillas. The latter reached more than 30,000 rebels in arms. They remained very active until the summer of the following year, when they will be definitively defeated, although small green parties in Kuban, Don and Western Siberia remained active until 1923. Later, in 1924, there would be a last revolt in Georgia. It was quickly and harshly repressed.

=== Ukrainian Atamans ===
Danylo Ilkovych Terpylo led a Ukrainian nationalist peasant uprising characterized by antisemitic pogroms. He came to control the countryside of the Kiev province, but not the big cities, and had 20,000 armed followers.

Another green movement was the brief rebellion of Nykyfor Hryhoriv, ataman of Kherson, and Yuriy Tyutyunnyk. Hryhoriv was an opportunistic leader who knew how to switch sides when it suited him.

=== Siberian rebellions ===

Admiral Kolchak made the fatal mistake of winning the animosity of peasants eager for agricultural reform by restoring the rights of landowners. The problem worsened in early 1919. Kolchak resorted to terror to appease them. With his rear weakened by the wear and tear of the guerrillas, the White regime could not stop the Bolshevik advance, which on the other hand, knew how to add local partisans to its forces wherever it advanced.

At the beginning of 1920 the Pitchfork uprising broke out, led by the Army of Black Eagles, which spread through the fields of Kazan, Simbirsk and Ufa. However, the rapid Bolshevik reaction brought their annihilation the following month.

Between the beginning of 1921 and the end of 1922, the West Siberian rebellion took place, the largest green uprising, and perhaps the least studied, both in number of rebels and in size geographic.

=== Makhnovist Revolution ===

One of the best known and most organized of these movements was the Makhnovist Revolution led by the Ukrainian anarchists Nestor Makhno, Fedir Shchus and Semen Karetnyk. Its movement was only comparable to that of Tambov due to its magnitude and organization. In a few years the Makhnovist partisans fought against Germans and Austro-Hungarians, Petliura nationalists, a French-led intervention in Berdyansk, and were targets of Denikin, Wrangel and Bolsheviks.

=== Tambov Rebellion ===

Probably the best known green movement is the rebellion that broke out on August 19, 1920 in the small town of Khitrovo, as a rejection of food requisitions in the Tambov Oblast and quickly spread to Penza, Saratov and Voronezh. This was defeated in June 1922 with the death of its leader, Aleksandr Antonov.

== Tactics ==
While it can be difficult to distinguish Green armies from other forms of peasant unrest, they were marked by concentrated leadership and distinct units, displaying a higher level of organization than most peasant uprisings. For instance, Aleksandr Antonov&#x27;s Green army in Tambov had a medical staff, reinforcement brigades, and a complex system of communication and intelligence that employed women, children, and the elderly. Notable Green movements also developed in the regions of Novgorod, Tula, Ryazan, Tver, Voronezh, Kostroma, Syzran, Gomel, Kursk, Bryansk and Oryol, among many others. Estimations of Green forces ranged from a few hundred to 50,000 fighters. Apart from the weapons that Red deserters brought with them, the Greens stole war material from defeated Bolshevik soldiers, from Bolshevik supply buildings, and from abandoned garrisons of the former Imperial Russian Army. They incited armed resistance to Bolshevik institutions in nearby villages and towns, bragging of peasant victories and recruiting new soldiers, sometimes by force. They formed guerrilla bands, which conducted highly mobile guerrilla warfare, attacking Bolshevik communication systems, mills, railways and factories. They also organized detachments numerically comparable to the Reds, in West Siberia they were even capable of facing them in the open field. The peasants were permanently in need of modern rifles and machine guns, decisive for the war, being forced to obtain them anyway. Crowds stormed the cities, looting and burning the Party offices, the local Soviet, police posts, courts, and propaganda centers. The collective farms were destroyed. Tools, livestock, requisitioned grain, mills, factories, breweries, and bakeries were redistributed. This claim of popular property served the Greens to gain the support of the population. If the peasants successfully overwhelmed Bolsheviks, they cruelly punished soldiers and officials, often mutilating bodies, torturing families or burying victims alive.

No more than 6,000 men, evenly distributed, fought in the first battles between the Whites of Lavr Kornilov and the Reds of Rudolf Sivers. Because of the small number of men involved and the tiny territory affected, it is difficult to call this even a civil war. During the entire first year of the war there were only skirmishes and artillery duels with small armies or partisan forces, more concerned with obtaining supplies. Territory continually changed hands, there were no front lines or fixed positions. In the decisive battles of 1919, they mobilized the peasantry by force, to fight in large armies with hundreds of thousands of men facing each other on fronts of hundreds of kilometers and supported with heavy weapons.

Their favored activities included blowing up bridges, cutting telegraph lines and raising railways in an attempt to paralyze communications and movements of the Reds. They preferred to prowl during the day, keeping watch over their enemies and attacking at night. They permanently refused to fight in the open, hiding in hills and forests to ambush and retreat quickly. Their greater mobility made up for their total absence of artillery. In Western Siberia and Central Russia, their guerilla tactics were aided by the wooded terrain of the taiga. When they were defeated they mixed with the civil population or fled on horses provided by the locals.

The Greens formed multitudes of peasants with clogs made of linden bark, they armed themselves with what they found: sticks, pitchforks, tridents, pikes, hoes, axes and clubs. To a lesser extent, also firearms such as shotguns, carbines, hunting rifles, pistols and rifles. Also many greens fought under red flags, symbols of the revolution later appropriated by the Communists.

The first small units sent by the Bolsheviks to subdue them were easily defeated and practically did nothing more than give them more weapons. Many Bolshevik units, especially in 1918, lacked training and discipline, dispersing after the first shots. For every Red soldier in combat, another eight were inactive due to illness or lack of training, clothing or ammunition. Whites were more disciplined and numerous and better trained. When the Bolsheviks were forced to withdraw from a region by guerrilla harassment they tended to take hostages in towns and cities and execute them once they were safe in territory under their rule. On the other hand, the Reds did not hesitate to suppress them with machine guns, tanks, armored cars, armored trains, heavy cannons, observation airplanes and poison gases leftovers from the arsenals of the Great War. In addition to flooding rebel areas with troops and propaganda. Quickly, the Communists learned that: &quot;Conventional armies, however well armed, are ill equipped to fight against a well supported peasant army.&quot; A lesson they would learn again much later in Afghanistan.

==Bolshevik response==
The Bolshevik government tried to build an anti-revolutionary, anti-communist image for the Green armies. Provincial Communist officials announced to locals that the Green armies were a subsection of the villainous White movement, despite the fact that Green armies were generally just as hostile to the Whites as they were to the Reds. The Bolsheviks also exaggerated the influence of the kulaks in Green armies, who were undoubtedly involved, but hardly the driving force of the movement.

These massive uprisings, which shook Soviet power in Eastern Ukraine, Tambov, and Siberia in 1919-1921, involved more than 100,000 guerrillas and millions of peasant supporters. In the words of Vladimir Lenin, it was a &quot;great internal political crisis&quot;, the first in Soviet history. These rebellions were recognized by Lenin as &quot;far more dangerous than all the forces of Denikin, Yudenich and Kolchak combined,&quot; as he proclaimed on March 8, 1921, in his opening speech at the 10th Party Congress.
The Bolsheviks initially believed that they could easily defeat the Greens, treating them as a hopeless cause both in their propaganda and in their military strategies. Instead of focusing armed attention on the Greens as a whole, the Reds treated each peasant army as a specific instance of unrest, suppressing harshly and further angering the peasant population. By the time that Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks realized the strength of the Green movement, it had grown into a serious social and military threat to Bolshevik power. The small units sent to subdue them many times defected demoralized, so they were replaced by a combination of mass terror, propaganda and flooding rebel areas with troops. Some scholars credit the Green movement with indirectly forcing the Communist Party to change its economic strategy in 1921 (see New Economic Policy), and yet, while the Greens certainly contributed to changes in Bolshevik policy, the extent of their influence is open to debate. It is far less contestable that the New Economic Policy – along with increased rainfall – quelled the Green movement by improving rural conditions and thus damaged the Green armies’ foundation for successful recruitment – peasant discontent. By the summer of 1922, as the Bolsheviks were securing their victory in the civil war, the Green troops had all but disappeared. The demise of these movements was in large part caused by the famine of 1921-1922, which affected 29 million people in total and killed about five million, being the main weapon of the regime to regain control over many provinces. Ruthless terror played its part in suppressing the revolts, but the main weapon was hunger.

In the opinion of the anarchists: &quot;The basic psychological trait of Bolshevism is the realization of its will by means of the violent elimination of all other wills, the absolute destruction of all individuality, to the point where it becomes an inanimate object.&quot; Many local Communist officials saw that the requisition orders starved their own people to death, but &quot;The good comrade did the what was said to him; he was pleased to leave all critical thinking to the Central Committee.&quot; That was the discipline the Party advocated. Ironically, many Bolshevik officers were the children of peasants educated in Tsarist military schools. With their minds open when leaving the narrow rural world, they rejected the mentality of their parents and grandparents and did not hesitate to repress their own people.

The resistance of the Cossacks led to a fierce campaign of decossackization, from 1919 to 1920, in which they were repressed with the clear intention of eliminating them &quot;as a social group&quot; -the first of many repressions in Soviet history. Men were shot, women and children deported, their homes burned and their lands repopulated with non-Cossack settlers. During the Lenin and Stalin governments, to economically develop territories and punish potentially separatist peoples, numerous communities were starved, deported and replaced by Russian settlers. Hence, the resistance and genocide of the Cossacks were called by the Bolshevik leaders themselves as the &quot;Soviet Vendée.&quot; Lenin admitted to imitating the tactics devised by François Babeuf, inventor of modern communism, who planned the &quot;populicide&quot; of Vendée, which found its climax in the &quot;infernal columns&quot;.

The Red Terror was much more systematic, widespread and effective than the White Terror. Any opposition, real or potential, was mercilessly repressed, setting the tone for future civil wars of the 20th century. The prison population of the Chekas were &quot;a reduced version of society itself&quot;, they included all kinds of people and there was no family that had not suffered the arrest or disappearance of a member. Terror against the workers had begun in 1918 and reached its climax in 1921, with the subjugation of Kronstadt. According to several of the Bolshevik leaders, the terror started by Lenin was the natural consequence of the violent seizure of power and his rejection of democracy. The only allies of the Bolsheviks were the left SRs, although only at the beginning because later they were also repressed following the Left SR Uprising. According to the anarchists, both sought to subjugate the people through the state.

Lenin also ordered the Bolshevik Party itself to be purged to get rid of potentially unfair or useless elements. In parallel there was an exorbitant growth of the Party, distancing the bases from its leaders. The first purge took place in the summer of 1918, the second in the spring of 1919, and the third in the summer of 1920, focusing on comrades of peasant or non-Russian origin. The Party did not inspire loyalty and people voluntarily left it in waves.

==Reasons for failure==
Aside from the Bolshevik response, a number of internal aspects of the Green movement led to its failure. Green activity often amounted to violence without an actual goal beyond killing communists and interrupting their economic and political activity. Thus, the armies rarely moved outside of their original geographic region. When Greens conquered towns or villages, they did not install themselves politically, leaving the territory to be retaken later by Bolsheviks. At the same time, many peasant militias were loosely organized and lacked greater military or political coordination among them, which made it difficult to take advantage of the widespread discontent, preventing &quot;most or all of peasant Russia bustling with rebellion&quot; to overthrow the new regime. Furthermore, there was a great deal of tension within the bands, which often included agrarian peasants, kulaks, workers and Whites, many with preexisting resentment towards each other. The Green armies were underfunded, low on supplies, and outmatched by the Red Army (which, despite its flaws, had better organization and morale as a result of greater, more frequent victories).

The civil war caused more than ten million deaths from fighting, terror, plagues and mainly famine, which took about half, and another couple of million emigrated, affecting mainly adult men. Another ten million people were not born as a result of the fall in the birth rate according to demographic estimates. According to the American demographer Frank Lorimer, between 1914 and 1926, some two million military personnel and fourteen million civilians died, of which nine to ten million were direct or indirect victims of the revolution. His Soviet counterpart, Boris Tsezarévich Urlanis, spoke of eight million. More Red soldiers died from smallpox, cholera, typhoid and venereal diseases than in combat. According to Urlanis, 300,000 Reds, Whites and Poles died in combat, but more than 450,000 from disease. According to the historian Evan Mawdsley epidemics decimated the Russian population. In 1917, 63,000 deaths from typhus and typhoid fever were counted, in 1919 there were 890,000 and in 1920 another 1,044,000. To this is added the quota in lives that dysentery, cholera and &quot;Spanish flu&quot; took in 1918–1919, so the figure probably exceeded three million based on data on extremely high infant mortality. About seven million orphans were left roaming the streets, living off handouts, robberies and prostitution. Many were later recruited into the army to become the soldiers and repressors of Stalinism. Ironically, this is how they received education, clothing and food, and established child-parent relationships with their officers.

=== New Economic Policy ===
Short of food and fuel, Petrograd was abandoned by most of its population. Of its 2 million inhabitants in 1918, barely 500,000 remained in 1920. Millions returned to the countryside to get food, crowding the railway stations. The fuel shortage, the economic crisis and the impossibility of repairing the cars caused these transports to collapse. The first to do so were those peasants who had arrived to the cities a few years ago or those who still had close ties with their native villages. For their part, the villagers received migrants with kinship ties or who knew some trade (carpenters or blacksmiths), but not the rest. Many were workers whose factories had closed, others only migrated to exchange manufactured objects for food and return to the cities, they went in armed brigades on stolen trains, becoming uncontrollable for the Bolshevik authorities. In addition, many railway officials were very corrupt; trains leaving the farms laden with food were looted by hungry crowds until they were emptied before reaching the cities. This only contributed to throwing transport into chaos and paralyzing industry, with the majority of workers spending most of their time making their own products and then going to exchange them for food on long trips.

Thus, in 1920 most of rural Russia was in the power of rebellious peasant smallholders, while the Bolshevik authorities only controlled the cities with &quot;volost&quot;. The following year, the Communists locked up in the cities saw communications interrupted and industry was paralyzed because the workers went on strike due to the null supply of grain to the cities. Since they had no food to encourage them to work, the Bolsheviks responded by depriving them of the few rations they received, imprisoning them or even shooting them if they did not meet production quotas. Large worker protests broke out in Petrograd, Moscow and other cities, in &quot;a last desperate attempt to bring it down&quot;, sparking the Kronstadt rebellion. Its subsequent submission led to the fierce repression of the SRs and Mensheviks, parties closely linked to the organization of the protests.

In the end, this was the cause of the abandonment of war communism and the adoption of the New Economic Policy (NEP): &quot;Having defeated the Whites, who were backed by no less than eight Western powers, the Bolsheviks surrendered to the peasantry.” War communism had brought massive desertions and the blocking of supplies by the peasantry, and it was clear that &quot;the national question was also ipso facto the peasant question&quot;, after all, 85% of Russians lived in rural areas. This change was nothing more than a &quot;temporary deviation&quot; in everyone&#x27;s mind, possibly more than a decade in Lenin&#x27;s mind, and for the sole purpose of rebuilding Russia. The market would always be regulated and would be gradually socialized by the State.

The Bolsheviks searched for a way to end popular support for the Greens. Salt and manufactured goods were offered to villages that passed a resolution declaring the rebels &quot;bandits,&quot; knowing that the latter would attack them in retaliation. The guerrillas themselves helped them in their work. Many criminals joined them and dedicated themselves to looting and raping, earning the hatred of the people.

At the end of the war, the large urban populations were disintegrated and the industry had almost disappeared, only the small rural owners remained. In 1921, with the civil war decided, the Soviet republics numbered 75 million ethnic Russians and 65 million other peoples, including 30 million speakers of Turkish or Iranian languages. Of these, 112 million were peasants, that is, it was a predominantly rural country.

=== Famine ===

The year 1921 in the Russian countryside was characterized by droughts, extreme frosts, and strong spring winds that ripped off the topsoil and ruined fledgling crops. To make matters worse, plagues of locusts and mice followed and the harvest of the previous season had been terrible, so much so that they knew that if they delivered everything the &quot;prodotriady&quot; demanded they knew that they would starve, being forced to rebel. However, war communism had its part in the disaster. Faced with requisitions, the peasants preferred to cultivate less land, just enough to survive. Faced with the almost non-existence of surpluses, the Bolsheviks began to take away their vital reserves, arguing that they had more hidden. They were accustomed to poor harvests and they overcame them by keeping communal reserves, but to avoid requisitions they reduced their production to mere survival, leaving them extremely vulnerable to bad weather conditions. Thus, the regions most affected by the famine of 1921-1922 had suffered the most from the requisitions of 1918–1921. The regions most disputed in the war, with constant changes of the front, were even more ruined.

Hunger made them eat grass, weeds, leaves, moss, tree bark, roof coverings, and flour made from acorns, sawdust, mud, and horse dung. They devoured their livestock, and hunted dogs, cats, and rodents. Many fell into cannibalism, eating the meat of people who had already died. Many even ate their dead children and relatives. As famine slowly exterminated the inhabitants of the Volga, Kama and Don river basins, of the Urals, Bashkortostan, Kazakhstan, Western Siberia and southern Ukraine, Bolshevik authorities ordered the thousands who tried to save themselves by fleeing to the cities be forced to return to the fields, claiming that they carried contagious diseases with them. They also ordered the export of a large quantity of grain from Ukraine to the Volga, feeding one affected region and further damaging another. The intention was to punish the Ukrainian peasantry for their resistance to the new regime, as Stalin did again in the 1930s.
Out of shame, the Bolshevik government did not recognize the famine until July 1921. At the request of Maxim Gorky, one of the most respected Russian writers of his time, Herbert Hoover organized international aid through the American Relief Administration (ARA). Gorky organized the Pomgol (Помгол), short for Помощь голодающим, &quot;Famine Relief.&quot; The conditions of the ARA were the release of all American citizens in Bolshevik prisons and the non-interference of the Communist authorities in the delivery of aid. Moscow accepted. Once international aid was secured, Lenin ordered the arrest of all Pomgol members on August 27, with the exception of prominent members like Gorky, on charges of being counterrevolutionary. Many were exiled or banished to restricted access areas in the interior of Russia.

In the summer of 1922 the ARA fed eleven million people a day and brought medicines, clothes, tools and seeds that were essential to achieve two large harvests of 1922 and 1923, bringing Russia out of the famine. In contrast, the corrupt and inefficient central commission created by Lenin helped less than three million. The gratitude of the Bolshevik government was translated into accusations to the ARA of attempting to discredit, spy on and shoot them down, interfering in their operations, searching their convoys, stopping their trains, stealing supplies and arresting members of assistance teams. However, the US aid was not canceled until it was made public that in full famine the Communist government continued to export millions of tons of its own cereals abroad, excusing itself from buying industrial and agricultural equipment. The ARA ended its operations in June 1923. The Bolsheviks alone wrote a short formal note of thanks, Gorki was much more grateful in a long letter to Hoover.

Despite the efforts, some five million people died. The famine marked the end of the revolution.

=== Collectivization and restart of conflict ===

Unable to rule the countryside peacefully or to produce manufactured goods to trade with, the Bolsheviks resorted to terrorizing it and forcibly taking the fruits of their labor. This started a &quot;hidden civil war&quot; between the peasantry and the nascent Bolshevik state, characterized by thousands of large and small revolts and riots. After the conflict ended, there was a tense truce between the peasantry and the state, but the state later returned with collectivization.

On March 10, 1923, Lenin suffered his third stroke. From then on, and especially after his death on the following January 24, the struggle to succeed him as unquestionable leader of the USSR intensified. This briefly prevented the regime from focusing on repressing and exploiting the peasantry. Thus, the peasants were able to redistribute their lands, be free to consume and trade with the fruit of their labor. They rebuilt the commercial networks that had been broken since 1914, and self-governed themselves according to the traditions of each village. The presence of the state was reduced to a minimum. However, this calm only masked the tension between the repressive state and the broader society. In those years, state terrorism tended to be concentrated in the peripheral areas of the USSR, such as the Caucasus and Central Asia, recently subdued areas of non-Russian culture and with a long tradition of resistance to Moscow.

The first Soviet ethnographers who visited the villages around Moscow felt that they were going to the Amazon. There were people who &quot;lived as if they were trapped in the Middle Ages.&quot; A society of archaic and patriarchal life, where witchcraft was believed, time was divided by seasons and religious festivals instead of months, with pagan rituals and superstitions, beatings of wives, tumultuous law, fistfights and days of drunkenness. Since before the revolution the urban elites saw the countryside as a &quot;particularly obscurantist&quot; environment where magic, religious rites and customs gave terror and comfort to people. Half a million soldiers joined the Communist Party after the war, bringing party ideology to their villages during the 1920s. The Bolsheviks and the NEP modernized village life with power lines, hospitals, theaters, cinemas and libraries. They also brought chemical fertilizers, cross-seed and modern tools. Dairy production and exclusive crops for the market became generalized, which before the revolution were exclusive activities of the nobility. There was an increased exchange of products, tools and livestock with cities, in addition to credit. Cooperatives among peasants also grew: &quot;with its smallholder instincts, superstitions and attachment to tradition, it would be abolished by these socialist farms.&quot; A literate youth was born among the peasantry that was much more ambitious than their parents, defiant before the authority of the elderly and religion, they were more individualistic. The Party based its influence in the countryside on them. Many young people sought in it the way to escape from the boring life in the countryside and helped organize Stalinist collectivization, all in order to break with the old ways of life. The villages were not divided between rich and poor, as the Bolsheviks believed, but between old and young.

At the end of the decade the Bolsheviks tried to centralize power. They resorted to reducing the number of rural Soviets, but this left many villages without any authority in 1929, making it impossible to collect taxes or enforce laws. The small rural owners had been decisively strengthened by the revolution and as a consequence of the civil war, most of the villages were ruled by their own community. The state only reached the cities with &quot;volost&quot;. Stalin realized that the longer the NPE lasted, the greater the distance grew between the regime&#x27;s plans and its impotence before the peasantry, until they could do nothing against the &quot;kulak,&quot; that is, small and medium-sized owners. It was better to go ahead and restart the civil war with an advantage. Only in 1927, after banishing, displacing or eliminating his main opponents and remaining safe as boss, did Stalin put an end to the &quot;peasant utopia&quot; based on the &quot;eserovschina&quot; or &quot;revolutionary socialist mentality&quot;. That year, greater state intervention on agricultural production began with a strong political repression, despite the fear of some leaders of a new war. This brought down production, causing a &quot;harvest crisis&quot;, which served as a pretext for Stalin to initiate collectivization.

There was no resistance from the peasantry until the confrontations against Stalinist collectivization, the expropriation of cattle and church closings. This hit particularly hard in 1930, with two and a half million villagers taking part in 14,000 revolts, riots and mass demonstrations that year. These mainly affect Chernozem, the North Caucasus and Western Ukraine (especially border areas with Poland and Romania), regions that came to be outside government control. About five million fled from the Kolkhoz in the aforementioned regions and Kazakhstan. But this new movement could not federate or organize like the previous one, they had no capable leaders or political cadres (decimated during the civil war), had to fight with pitchforks and axes (firearms were progressively requisitioned during the 1920s) and the regime reacted too quickly.

<text>HMAS &quot;Encounter&quot; was a second-class protected cruiser of the operated by the Royal Navy (RN) and Royal Australian Navy (RAN). She was built by HM Dockyard Devonport and completed at the end of 1905.

&quot;Encounter&quot; spent the first six years of her career operating with the RN&#x27;s Australia Squadron, before being transferred to the newly formed RAN. During World War I, the cruiser became the first ship of the RAN to fire in anger when she bombarded Toma Ridge. &quot;Encounter&quot; operated in the New Guinea, Fiji-Samoa, and Malaya areas until 1916, when she returned to Australian waters. The ship spent the rest of the war patrolling and escorting convoys around Australia and into the Indian Ocean. In 1919, &quot;Encounter&quot; was sent to evacuate the Administrator of the Northern Territory and his family following the Darwin Rebellion.

&quot;Encounter&quot; was paid off into reserve in 1920, but saw further use as a depot ship until being completely decommissioned in 1929. In 1932, the cruiser was scuttled off Sydney.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Challenger&quot; class vessels had a standard displacement of 5,880 tons, a length of overall and between perpendiculars, a beam of , and a draught of . The cruisers were propelled by a Keyham 4-cylinder triple expansion steam engine, which provided 12,500 horsepower to two propeller shafts, allowing her to reach speeds just over . Her economical cruising speed was , which allowed the ship to travel before exhausting her 1,314 tons of coal. In British service, the ship&#x27;s company stood at 450, but while operated by the RAN, this was reduced to 29 officers and 269 sailors.

She was among the first ships of the Royal Navy to receive water-tube Dürr boilers.

As completed, the ship&#x27;s armament consisted of eleven BL 6-inch Mk VII naval guns, nine QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval guns, six 3-pounder guns, three machine guns, and two 18-inch (450-mm) torpedo tubes mounted broadside. By the 1920s, the 6-inch and 12-pounder guns had been reduced to three and four respectively, although a 12-pounder field gun was added to the ship&#x27;s arsenal. A single QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss gun replaced the six 3-pounders, while the original three machine guns were supplanted by four Maxim guns and two Lewis guns.

&quot;Encounter&quot; was laid down for the RN by HM Dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth on 28 January 1901. The ship was launched on 18 June 1902, when the naming ceremony was performed by Lady Sturges Jackson, wife of Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Sturges Jackson, Admiral-Superintendent of Devonport Dockyard. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy on 21 November 1905, and completed on 16 December 1905. The ship sailed for Australia on 31 December.

==Operational history==

From April 1906 to June 1912, &quot;Encounter&quot; served as part of the RN Australia Squadron. In 1909, 15 of her crew drowned when a naval longboat was run over by the small coastal steamer &quot;Dunmore&quot; in Sydney Harbour. Herbert Wilson, a petty officer aboard &quot;Encounter&quot;, published his personal log covering 1910–1912, including an account of the British expeditions to Vavaʻu for the total solar eclipse of 28 April 1911. On 1 July 1912, the ship was commissioned into the RAN on loan, for use until was completed.

===World War I===

Assigned to the Pacific Station during 1914–15, &quot;Encounter&quot; was part of the force which occupied German New Guinea. In the course of that operation, she captured the steamer &quot;Zambezi&quot; on 12 August and, on 14 September, bombarded Toma Ridge to support the Australian Military and Naval Expeditionary Force which was besieging the town. That action made her the first RAN ship to . She covered the landing at Madang on 24 September. In October, she was sent to the Fiji-Samoa area. During a patrol of the region on 25 April 1915, &quot;Encounter&quot; captured the German sailing vessel &quot;Elfriede&quot;.

In 1915, &quot;Encounter&quot; underwent refit in Sydney, then sailed on 21 July to transport a garrison to Fanning Island. Sometime in 1915, the ship sustained hull damage from a coral reef at Johnson Island. Temporary repairs were made at Suva, before the ship sailed to Hong Kong for permanent repairs. The cruiser also operated in the Malay archipelago during early 1916, but was recalled to Australian waters on 11 February 1916, because all other RAN ships had been deployed elsewhere.

In July 1916, during a visit to an unnamed island off the coast of Western Australia, two bronze cannons were discovered by &quot;Encounter&quot; officers Commander C.W. Stevens and Surgeon Lieutenant W. Roberts. The latter described:
Because the guns were erroneously thought to be carronades, the place was named &quot;Carronade Island&quot;.

On 12 January 1917, &quot;Encounter&quot; was ordered to New Zealand, where she met a convoy of Australian and New Zealand troopships. The cruiser remained with the convoy until a rendezvous point in the Indian Ocean, where responsibility was handed over to ships of the East Indies Station. On 6 July, &quot;Encounter&quot; assisted SS &quot;Cumberland&quot;, which had struck a mine off Gabo Island. In August, the cruiser assisted in the search for the missing merchantman SS &quot;Matunga&quot;; it was not known until 1918 that she had been a victim of the German raider . The ship visited Mopelia Island in September 1917, to search for the wreck of the German raider .

From December 1917 until April 1918, &quot;Encounter&quot; underwent refit in Sydney, and then returned to Western Australia. The ship travelled between Fremantle and Sydney several times before the end of the war. The cruiser&#x27;s wartime activities were later recognised with the battle honour &quot;Rabaul 1914&quot;.

===Post-war===
In early 1919, &quot;Encounter&quot; was sent to Darwin to protect Administrator John Gilruth, following the Darwin Rebellion. Gilruth and his family boarded her on 20 February 1919 and were taken to Melbourne. The ship was permanently transferred to the RAN on 5 December 1919. The ship was used in a training role, and acquired the nickname &quot;the Old Bus&quot;.

&quot;Encounter&quot; paid off into reserve on 30 September 1920. She was assigned to the naval base at Garden Island as a depot ship in May 1923, and was renamed HMAS &quot;Penguin&quot;. The ship was decommissioned on 15 August 1929. She was scuttled on 14 September 1932 off Bondi Beach, Sydney. &quot;Encounter&quot; lies at a depth of around and is dived regularly.

<doc id="438730" wikidata="Q5152516" url="?curid=438730" title="Commercial Pacific Cable Company">
<text>Commercial Pacific Cable Company was founded in 1901, and ceased operations in October 1951. It provided the first direct telegraph route from America to the Philippines, China, and Japan.

The company was established as a joint venture of three companies: the Commercial Cable Company (25%), the Great Northern Telegraph Company (25%), and the Eastern Telegraph Company (50%). Though the Eastern (a British firm) was the majority shareholder, the CPCC was registered in the United States.

The company used cable ships to lay its undersea cable across the Pacific Ocean from America&#x27;s west coast. The cables extended a length of and the project cost about $12 million. Before this, messages had to travel across the Atlantic to the Far East via Cape Town and the Indian Ocean, or &quot;via&quot; London to Russia, then across the Russian landline to Vladivostok, then by submarine cable to Japan and the Philippines.

The first section of cable was laid in 1902 by the cable ship CS &quot;Silvertown&quot; from Ocean Beach, adjacent to the famous Cliff House in San Francisco to Honolulu. It began operating on January 1, 1903. Later that year, cables were laid from Honolulu to Midway Atoll, thence to Sumay, Guam, and thence to Manila. The cables carried the first message to ever travel around the globe from US President Theodore Roosevelt on July 4, 1903. He wished &quot;a happy Independence Day to the US, its territories and properties...&quot; It took nine minutes for the message to travel worldwide.

In 1906 Siemens AG made and laid the section from Guam to Bonin Islands in the Japanese archipelago. In the same year the &quot;India Rubber, Gutta Percha and Telegraph Works Company&quot; manufactured and laid a cable between Manila and Shanghai using CS &quot;Silvertown&quot; and CS &quot;Store Nordiske&quot;.
In the First World War, the trans-Pacific service slowed significantly from repeated faults and the general increase in war-related traffic. Despite repeated requests by United States businesses and the Federal government, the company would not invest in improvements to increase traffic volume or speed. After the war conditions eased, but demand continued to be high and the company made repeated promises to invest in a second cable, though it never followed through on these promises. When the US entered the Second World War, the cable connection from Midway to the Philippines closed quickly after 7 December 1941 and did not reopen until the war was over.

By 1946 the cables were developing serious faults. Over a million dollars was spent on repairs, but the company was unable to maintain a viable service and stopped operating in 1951. It merged with American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T).

<text>HMAS &quot;Flinders&quot; (GS 312/A 312), named for Matthew Flinders (1774–1814), was a hydrographic survey ship of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Built by HMA Naval Dockyard at Williamstown, Victoria, &quot;Flinders&quot; was commissioned into the RAN in 1973, and was used to conduct hydrographic surveys in the waters to Australia&#x27;s north, including parts of New Guinea. In 1974, the ship was tasked with assisting clean up efforts in the wake of Cyclone Tracy, which devastated large parts of Darwin. The ship was decommissioned in 1998 and sold to civilian operators, who have since converted her into a private yacht in the Cayman Islands.

==Construction and design==
The ship was ordered in 1970 to replace the light survey vessel . &quot;Flinders&quot; was in length overall, with a beam of , a draught of , and a full load displacement of 740 tons. Propulsion was provided by two Paxman Ventura diesel motors connected to twin screws, providing a top speed of and a range of at . The hull was all-welded, and designed to Australian Shipping Board standards for coastal operations. Increased seakeeping ability was imparted through a bulbous bow, high forecastle, and a stabilising system. Most operations were intended to be in the waters of Australia and Papua New Guinea, although &quot;Flinders&quot; was also capable of limited oceanographic work. The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 38 personnel, and &quot;Flinders&quot; carried light-calibre weapons for self-defence.

&quot;Flinders&quot; was laid down by HMA Naval Dockyard at Williamstown, Victoria, in February 1971. She was launched on 29 July 1972 and commissioned into the RAN on 27 April 1973. The ship cost $2,600,000.

==Operational history==
On commissioning, the ship was based in Cairns, and afterwards was used to undertake hydrographic surveys to Australia&#x27;s north. Following the destruction of Darwin by Cyclone Tracy during the night of 24–25 December 1974, &quot;Flinders&quot; was deployed as part of the relief effort; Operation Navy Help Darwin. She sailed from Cairns on 26 December, and as the first ship to arrive, &quot;Flinders&quot; was tasked with surveying the harbour to work out the position of wrecks and the safest areas for the other RAN ships to anchor. The majority of &quot;Flinders&quot;″ survey work was undertaken off the Queensland coast, but in 1976 she undertook operations in the Dampier Strait, in New Guinea waters. From 1980 to 1983 she operated off the coasts of Queensland and Papua New Guinea under Commander James Bond. In 1982, Bond and &quot;Flinders&quot; discovered, surveyed and charted the Hydrographers Passage, providing a faster, more efficient route through the Great Barrier Reef for merchant shipping.

&quot;Flinders&quot; was decommissioned in 1998. In October 1999, the ship was sold at auction for A$518,460 to a New Zealand consortium. She was remodelled into a private yacht, and now operates as MY &quot;Plan B&quot;, registered in the Cayman Islands.

<doc id="438740" wikidata="Q2554316" url="?curid=438740" title="Sobelair">
<text>Société Belge des Transports par Air SA, known by its short form Sobelair, was a Belgian charter airline that operated from 1946 to 2004. It was headquartered in Brussels (later in Zaventem) and operated mostly non-scheduled passenger and cargo flights out of Brussels Airport.

==History==
Sobelair was founded as a charter airline on 30 July 1946, originally (only during the initial months) known as Société d&#x27;Etude et de Transports Aériens, abbreviated SETA. The first revenue flight using a Douglas DC-3 aircraft, which took place on 15 October of that year, was a flowers transport to Nice via Paris. In 1947, scheduled flights from Brussels to Elisabethville in Belgian Congo were launched on behalf of several companies in the Belgian colony, which held the majority of the stakes in the company. In 1949, these shares were acquired by Belgian flag carrier Sabena, which thus owned 72.29 percent in Sobelair.

When Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville) was founded as an independent state in the former Belgian Congo, Sobelair ceased its African service, and concentrated on offering chartered holiday flights to the Mediterranean instead, as well as (between 1957 and 1962) domestic routes using small Cessna 310 airplanes.

Sobelair joined the jet age in 1971, when the first Caravelle was acquired second-hand from Sabena. Over the following years, the fleet was further modernized with Boeing 707 aircraft, which stayed until 1988. By then, Sobelair operated a fleet composed exclusively of smaller Boeing 737 airliners. Long haul flights were relaunched only in 1994, using a newly bought Boeing 767-300.

When Swissair started an alliance with Sabena in 1995, plans were made for a co-operation of the respective charter subsidiaries. Thus, Sobelair went into negotiation with the Swiss subsidiary of Trans European Airways in 1996, which turned out to be fruitless. Instead, an agreement was signed with Crossair. In 1997, Sobelair operated chartered passenger flights from Zürich to San Francisco and Las Vegas on behalf of Swissair. In the late 1990s, a charter contract with tour operator Jetair was signed. In 2001, further agreements with ALM Antillean Airlines and Balair were secured.

In October 2001, Swissair went bankrupt, which was followed by the demise of partner Sabena in November of the same year, which led to the future of Sobelair becoming uncertain, too. Delta Air Transport, which the Sabena slots had been transferred to, briefly considered taking over Sobelair&#x27;s 767s for the re-launch of scheduled passenger flights to Africa (instead, Birdy Airlines was founded for that purpose), and German tour operator Preussag went into negotiations concerning a taking-over of the airline, which were dropped again in February 2002.

After having been acquired by a group of investors in June 2002, which led to the launch of scheduled flights on the Brussels-Johannesburg route, Sobelair was passed on to SN Brussels Airlines in early 2003, for which it operated charter flights henceforth. This did not lead to an improvement of the financial situation, and Sobelair declared bankruptcy in January 2004. TUI Travel placed an offer for taking over Sobelair&#x27;s aircraft in order to create a Belgian airline subsidiary, provided that creditor protection would be granted. On 19 January, this measure was rejected, so that Sobelair went out of business and its then approximately 450 employees lost their jobs.

===Historical fleet===
Over the nearly 60 years of its existence, Sobelair operated the following aircraft types:

==Accidents and incidents==
*Sobelair suffered one fatal accident, which occurred on 22 April 1960. A Douglas C-54 Skymaster of the airline, registered OO-SBL, crashed into a mountain slope (a so-called controlled flight into terrain) whilst approaching an airfield in Bunia, then Belgian Congo. All 28 passengers and the seven crew members that had been on the chartered flight from Cairo died.
*On 20 December 1970, a Sobelair Douglas DC-6 (registered OO-CTL) was damaged beyond repair when it ran off the runway at Málaga Airport. The cargo flight with seven occupants had had to perform an emergency landing at the airport in bad weather conditions because the left main landing gear could not be extended due to a hydraulic problem.
*On 29 March 1981, an engine fire occurred with a Sobelair Boeing 707 (registered OO-SJA) shortly after take-off from Brussels Airport. The pilots returned to the airport and had to execute an emergency landing. As there had not been time to dump fuel, the airplane was too heavy, and was deliberately steered off the runway in order not to overshoot it, during which it suffered extensive damage. The 109 passengers and eight crew members survived the accident.

<doc id="438748" wikidata="Q816814" url="?curid=438748" title="Kingdom of Gwynedd">
<text>The Kingdom of Gwynedd (Medieval Latin: ; Middle Welsh: ) was a Welsh kingdom and a Roman Empire successor state that emerged in sub-Roman Britain in the 5th century during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.

Based in northwest Wales, the rulers of Gwynedd repeatedly rose to dominance and were acclaimed as &quot;King of the Britons&quot; before losing their power in civil wars or invasions. The kingdom of Gruffydd ap Llywelynthe King of Wales from 1055 to 1063was shattered by a Saxon invasion in 1063 just prior to the Norman invasion of Wales, but the House of Aberffraw restored by Gruffudd ap Cynan slowly recovered and Llywelyn the Great of Gwynedd was able to proclaim the Principality of Wales at the Aberdyfi gathering of Welsh princes in 1216. In 1277, the Treaty of Aberconwy between Edward I of England and Llywelyn&#x27;s grandson Llywelyn ap Gruffudd granted peace between the two but would also guarantee that Welsh self-rule would end upon Llywelyn&#x27;s death, and so it represented the completion of the first stage of the conquest of Wales by Edward I.

Welsh tradition credited the founding of Gwynedd to the Brittonic polity of Gododdin (Old Welsh , earlier Brittonic form &quot;Votadini&quot;) from Lothian invading the lands of the Brittonic polities of the Deceangli, Ordovices, and Gangani in the 5th century. The sons of their leader, Cunedda, were said to have possessed the land between the rivers Dee and Teifi. The true borders of the realm varied over time, but Gwynedd proper was generally thought to comprise the cantrefs of Aberffraw, Cemais, and Cantref Rhosyr on Anglesey and Arllechwedd, Arfon, Dunoding, Dyffryn Clwyd, Llŷn, Rhos, Rhufoniog, and Tegeingl at the mountainous mainland region of Snowdonia opposite.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Gwynedd&quot; is believed to be a borrowing from early Irish (reflective of Irish settlement in the area in antiquity), either cognate with the Old Irish ethnic name , &quot;Irish People&quot;, from Primitive Irish * &quot;Forest People&quot;/&quot;Wild People&quot; (from Proto-Indo-European &quot;wood, wilderness&quot;), or (alternatively) Old Irish &quot;war band&quot;, from Proto-Irish * (from Proto-Indo-European &quot;chase, pursue, suppress&quot;).

Ptolemy in the 1st century marked the Llŷn Peninsula as the &quot;Promontory of the Gangani&quot;, which is also a name he recorded in Ireland. It is theorised in the 1st century BC some of the Gangani tribe may have landed in what is now the Llŷn Peninsula and had driven out the Deceangli or the Ordovices tribe from that area either peacefully or by force. In the late and post-Roman eras, Irish from Leinster may have arrived in Anglesey and elsewhere in northwest Wales with the name &quot;Llŷn&quot; derived from &quot;Laigin&quot;, an Old Irish form that means &quot;Leinstermen, or simply Leinster.&quot;

The 5th-century Cantiorix Inscription now in Penmachno church seems to be the earliest record of the name. It is in memory of a man named Cantiorix, and the Latin inscription is : &quot;Cantiorix lies here. He was a citizen of Gwynedd and a cousin of Maglos the magistrate&quot;. The use of terms such as &quot;citizen&quot; and &quot;magistrate&quot; may be cited as evidence that Romano-British culture and institutions continued in Gwynedd long after the legions had withdrawn.

==History, background and familial descent==
The background involving the Kingdom of Gwynedd starts with the history of Wales. After the last ice age, Wales was settled during the prehistoric times. Neolithic sites have been discovered with tools made from flint, such as near Llanfaethlu, a long house excavated from 6000 years ago. Further examples of human activity in Gwynedd and Anglesey are involved in places such as Bryn Celli Ddu on Anglesey, which was built in phases starting 5000 years ago. Archeological findings from the Bronze Age, millennia ago, include findings such as the Arthog cauldron, a bronze cauldron from 1100 BC found near the Merioneth border, also named &#x27;The Nannau Bucket&#x27; (similar to the Dowris bucket). And the Moel Hebog shield which is also 3,000 years old (similar to the Rhyd-y-gors example), and more recently the Trawsfynydd tankard, which was used to drink mead and beer between 100 BC and 75 AD.

Examples of early settlement in Gwynedd are Bryn Eryr near Llansadwrn, Anglesey, now found at the St Fagans National Museum of History, and Garn Boduan, a Celtic hillfort on the Llŷn Peninsula. Iron Age forts were being adapted until after the Roman conquest of Britain, &#x27;Castle of Buan&#x27; (Garn Boduan) in Llŷn was recorded as being fortified until the 7th century. During the Roman period, new roads and forts were constructed throughout the Roman empire and for centuries in Wales and England, Welsh examples include Caer Gybi (fort) on Anglesey, and Segontium in Caernarfon, Gwynedd. The establishment of Christianity in Wales also gave rise to a new era; the Romans founded towns with churches and installed governors. During the centuries of sub-Roman Britain, new political structures were established. The Brythonic Kingdom of Gwynedd was established in the 5th century, and it proved to be the most durable of these Brythonic states, surviving until the late 13th century.

Boundaries and names emerging from the 1st millennium AD onwards are still being used today to define towns and counties of the region. Noteworthy descendants from the Kingdom of Gwynedd include royalty such as Owain Glyndŵr, and the titular Prince of Wales, also the Salusbury family via Katheryn of Berain. The people mentioned can be associated with the Anglesey based Tudors of Penmynydd family. The Tudors were ancestors and namesake to the former English Royal House of Tudor, they were descended from the Welshman Maredudd ap Tudur, Ednyfed Fychan being his famous ancestor, his family were seneschals to the Kings of Gwynedd. The Tudor dynasty became ancestors to the House of Stuart, and the Stuarts formed the European Jacobite family, they include direct descendants in United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy and other countries on the continent of Europe, and all around the world.

== Gwynedd in the Early Middle Ages ==

===Cunedda and his sons===

The region became known as &quot;Venedotia&quot; in Latin. The name was initially attributed to a specific Irish colony on Anglesey but broadened to refer to Irish settlers as a whole in North Wales by the 5th century. According to the 9th-century monk and chronicler Nennius, North Wales was left defenceless by the Roman withdrawal and subject to increasing raids by marauders from the Isle of Man and Ireland, a situation which led Cunedda, his sons and their entourage, to migrate in the mid-5th century from &quot;Manaw Gododdin&quot; (now Clackmannanshire) to settle and defend North Wales against the raiders and bring the region within Romano-British control. Whether they were invited to keep out the invaders or were raiders themselves, however, is unknown. According to traditional pedigrees, Cunedda&#x27;s grandfather was Padarn Beisrudd, &quot;Paternus of the red cloak&quot;, &quot;an epithet which suggests that he wore the cloak of a Roman officer&quot;, and perhaps it was evidence of a high-ranking officer. Cunedda () brought order to North Wales and after his death, Gwynedd was divided among his sons: Dynod was awarded &quot;Dunoding&quot;, another son Ceredig received &quot;Ceredigion&quot;,&quot; Afloeg by Aflogion in Lleyn, Dogfael by Dogfeiling in Dyffryn Clwyd, and Edern by Edeirnion ... Osfeilion of Osfael has not yet been located; Tybion, the eldest son, is said to have died in Manaw Gododdin, but his son Meirion (Marianus) comes into the picture as lord of Meirionydd. Einion Yrth completes the number&quot;. Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion one of his grandsons, was the final leader to defeat the Irish on Anglesey. However, this overly neat origin myth has been met with skepticism,

The inhabitants of Gwynedd remained conscious of their Romano-British heritage, and an affinity with Rome survived long after the Empire retreated from Britain, particularly with the use of Latin in writing and sustaining the Christian religion. The ruling classes continued to emphasise Roman ancestors within their pedigrees as a way to link their rule with the old imperial Roman order, suggesting stability and continuity with that old order. According to Professor John Davies, &quot;[T]here is a determinedly Brythonic, and indeed Roman, air to early Gwynedd.&quot; So palpable was the Roman heritage felt that Professor Bryan Ward-Perkins of Trinity College, Oxford, wrote, &quot;it took until 1282, when Edward I conquered Gwynedd, for the last part of Roman Britain to fall [and] a strong case can be made for Gwynedd as the very last part of the entire Roman Empire, east and west, to fall to the barbarians.&quot; Nevertheless, there was generally quick abandonment of Roman political, social, and ecclesiastical practices and institutions within Gwynedd and elsewhere in Wales. Roman knowledge was lost as the Romano-Britons shifted towards a streamlined militaristic near-tribal society that no longer included the use of coinage and other complex industries dependent on a money economy, architectural techniques using brick and mortar, and even more basic knowledge such as the use of the wheel in pottery production. Ward-Perkins suggests the Welsh had to abandon those Roman ways that proved insufficient, or indeed superfluous, to meet the challenge of survival they faced: &quot;Militarized tribal societies, despite their political fragmentation and internecine strife, seem to have offered better protection against Germanic invasion than exclusive dependence on a professional Roman army (that in the troubled years of the fifth century was all too prone to melt away or mutiny).&quot;

Reverting to a more militaristic tribal society allowed the Welsh of Gwynedd to concentrate on those martial skills necessary for their very survival, and the Romano-Britons of western Britain did offer stiffer and ultimately successful resistance. The region of Venedotia, however, had been under Roman military administration and included established Gaelic settlements, and the civilian element there was less extensive, perhaps facilitating technological loss.
In the post-Roman period, the earliest rulers of Wales and Gwynedd may have exerted authority over regions no larger than the &quot;cantrefi&quot; (hundreds) described in Welsh law codified centuries later, with their size somewhat comparable in size to the Irish &quot;tuath&quot;. These early petty kings or princelings (Lloyd uses the term &quot;chieftain&quot;) adopted the title &quot;rhi&quot; in Welsh (akin to the Irish Gaelic &quot;rí&quot;), later replaced by &quot;brenin&quot;, a title used to &quot;denote a less archaic form of kingship,&quot; according to Professor John Davies. Genealogical lists compiled around 960 bear out that a number of these early rulers claimed degrees of association with the old Roman order, but do not appear in the official royal lineages. &quot;It may be assumed that the stronger kings annexed the territories of their weaker neighbours and that the lineages of the victors are the only lineages to have survived,&quot; according to Davies. Smaller and weaker chieftains coalesced around more powerful princelings, sometimes through voluntary vassalage or inheritance, though at other times through conquest, and the lesser princelings coalesced around still greater princelings until a regional prince could claim authority over the whole of north Wales from the River Dyfi in the south to the Dee in the east, and incorporating Anglesey.

Other evidence supports Nennius&#x27;s claim that a leader came to North Wales and brought the region a measure of stability although an Irish Gaelic element remained until the mid-5th century. Cunedda&#x27;s heir Einion Yrth ap Cunedda defeated the remaining Gaelic Irish on Anglesey by 470, while his son, Cadwallon Lawhir ap Einion, appears to have consolidated the realm during the time of relative peace following the Battle of Badon, where the Anglo-Saxons were defeated. During that peace, he established a mighty kingdom. After Cadwallon, Gwynedd appears to have held a pre-eminent position among the petty Cambrian states in the post-Roman period. The great-grandson of Cunedda, Maelgwn Hir (Maelgwn the Tall), was regarded as an able military leader, impetuous and generous. There are several legends about his life concerning either his own trickery and craftiness or, on the other hand, miracles performed against him by Christian saints. He is attributed in some old stories as hosting the first Eisteddfod, and he is also one of five Celtic British kings castigated for their sins by the contemporary Christian writer Gildas (who referred to him as Maglocunus, meaning &#x27;Prince-Hound&#x27; in Brittonic), written in the &quot;De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae&quot;. Maelgwn was curiously described as &quot;the dragon of the island&quot; by Gildas which was possibly a title, but explicitly as the most powerful of the five named British kings. &quot;[Y]ou the last I write of but the first and greatest in evil, more than many in ability but also in malice, more generous in giving but also more liberal in sin, strong in war but stronger to destroy your soul.&quot;

Maelgwn eventually died from the plague in 547, leaving a succession crisis in his wake. His son-in-law, Elidyr Mwynfawr of the Kingdom of Strathclyde, claimed the throne and invaded Gwynedd to displace Maelgwn&#x27;s son, Rhun Hir ap Maelgwn. Elidyr was killed in the attempt, but his death was then avenged by his relatives, who ravaged the coast of Arfon. Rhun counter-attacked and exacted the same penalty on the lands of his foes in what is now South and Central Scotland. The long distances these armies travelled suggests they were moving across the Irish Sea, but, because almost all of what is now northern England was at this point (c. 550) under Brittonic rule, it is possible that his army marched to Strathclyde overland. Rhun returned to Gwynedd, and the rest of his reign was for the majority uneventful until the relatives of Elidir renewed their aggressions against Rhun who was killed in the conflict. He was succeeded by his son or in some accounts nephew Beli ap Rhun in c. 586.

On the accession of Beli&#x27;s son Iago ap Beli in c. 599, the situation in Britain had deteriorated significantly. Most of northern England had been overrun by the invading Angles of Deira and Bernicia, who were in the process of forming the Kingdom of Northumbria. In a rare show of common interest, it appears that Gwynedd and the neighbouring Kingdom of Powys acted in concert to rebuff the Anglian advance but were defeated at the Battle of Chester in 613. Following this catastrophe, the approximate borders of northern Wales were set with the city of Caerlleon (now called Chester) and the surrounding Cheshire Plain falling under the control of the Anglo-Saxons. Beli&#x27;s grandson was Cadfan ap Iago from the line of Maelgwn, his tombstone in Gwynedd wrote in (most renowned), he was an ancestor of the future Kings of Gwynedd.

===Cadwallon ap Cadfan===
The Battle of Chester did not end the ability of the Welsh to seriously threaten the Anglo-Saxon polities. Among the most powerful of the early kings was Cadwallon ap Cadfan (c. 624 – 634), grandson of Iago ap Beli. He became engaged in an initially disastrous campaign against Northumbria where following a series of epic defeats he was confined first to Anglesey, and then just to Puffin Island, before being forced into exile across the Irish Sea to Dublin, – a place which would come to host many royal refugees from Gwynedd. All must have seemed lost but Cadwallon () raised an enormous army and after a brief time in Guernsey he invaded Dumnonia, relieved the West Welsh who were suffering a Mercian invasion and forced the pagan Penda of Mercia into an alliance against Northumbria. With new vigour Cadwallon returned to his Northumbrian foes, defeated their armies and slew a series of their kings. In this furious campaign, his armies devastated Northumbria, captured and sacked York in 633 and briefly controlled the kingdom. At this time, according to Bede, many Northumbrians were slaughtered, &quot;with savage cruelty&quot;, by Cadwallon.
Despite the war and 14 battles undertaken by the allied forces of Gwynedd and Mercia against Northumbria, of which the chief one was the Battle of Cefn Digoll in 632, an alliance was concluded when Cadwallon married Alcfritha, daughter of Pybba of Mercia. However, the effect of these tumultuous events would come to be short-lived, for he died in battle in 634 close to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, at the Battle of Heavenfield. On account of these deeds, he and his son Cadwaladr, (who fought at the Battle of the Winwaed) appear to have been considered the last two High Kings of Britain. Cadwaladr presided over a period of consolidation and devoted much time to the Church, earning the title &quot;Bendigaid&quot; for &quot;Blessed&quot;. As a monk in later life, he was involved with Clynnog&#x27;s abbey, and St Cadwaladr&#x27;s Church, Llangadwaladr on Anglesey. The Tudors of Penmynydd and Henry VII of England in particular claimed descent from Cadwaladr in the &quot;twenty-second degree&quot;.

=== Rhodri the Great and Aberffraw primacy ===

During the later part of the 9th and 10th centuries, the coastal areas of Gwynedd, particularly Anglesey, were coming under increasing attack by the Vikings. Wales had also been at war with the neighbouring English Kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex who were assisted by Anglo-Saxons and Danes (Vikings). But it was the kings of Welsh kingdoms who were protected by the Scandinavian York mercenaries. These raids no doubt had a seriously debilitating effect on the country but fortunately for Gwynedd, the victims of the Vikings were not confined to Wales. The House of Cunedda – as the direct descendants of Cunedda are known – eventually expired in the male line in 825 upon the death of Hywel ap Rhodri Molwynog and, as John Edward Lloyd put it, &quot;a stranger possessed the throne of Gwynedd.&quot;
This &quot;stranger&quot; who became the next King of Gwynedd was Merfyn &quot;Frych&quot; (Merfyn &quot;the Freckled&quot;). When, however, Merfyn Frych&#x27;s pedigree is examined – and to the Welsh pedigree meant everything – he seems not a stranger but a direct descendant of the ancient ruling line. He was the son of Gwriad, the contemporaneous King of Mann from the Isle of Man and depending on the source either son or husband of Essyllt daughter of Cynan Dindaethwy a former King of Gwynedd. The most ancient genealogical sources agree that Merfyn was the son of Essyllt, heiress and cousin of the aforementioned Hywel ap Caradog, last of the ruling House of Cunedda in Gwynedd, and that Merfyn&#x27;s male line went back to the Hen Ogledd to Llywarch Hen, a first cousin of Urien and thus a direct descendant of Coel Hen. Thus the House of Cunedda and the new House of Aberffraw, as Merfyn&#x27;s descendants came to be known, shared Coel Hen as a common ancestor, although the House of Cunedda traced their line through Gwawl his daughter and wife of Cunedda.

Merfyn married Nest ferch Cadell, the sister or daughter of Cyngen ap Cadell, the King of Powys of the Gwertherion dynasty, and founded the House of Aberffraw, named after his principal court on Anglesey. No written records are preserved from the Britons of southern Scotland and northern England and it is very likely that Merfyn Frych brought many of these legends as well as his pedigree with him when he came to north Wales. It appears most probable that it was at Merfyn&#x27;s court that all the lore of the north was collected and written down during his reign and that of his son.

Rhodri the Great (844–878), son of Merfyn Frych and Nest ferch Cadell, was able to add the Powys to his realm after its king (his maternal uncle) died on a pilgrimage to Rome in 855. Later, he married Angharad ferch Meurig, the sister of King Gwgon of Seisyllwg. When Gwgon drowned without an heir in 872, Rhodri became a steward over the kingdom and was able to install his son, Cadell ap Rhodri, as a subject king. Thus, he became the first ruler since the days of Cunedda to control the greater part of Wales.

When Rhodri died in 878 AD (battle against Ceolwulf I of Mercia) the relative unity of Wales ended and it was once again divided into its component parts each ruled by one of his sons. Rhodri&#x27;s eldest son Anarawd ap Rhodri inherited Gwynedd and would firmly establish the princely &quot;House of Aberffraw&quot;. His son Merfyn ap Rhodri was given the Kingdom of Powys to rule and Cadell founded the medieval Welsh Royal &quot;House of Dinefwr&quot; in Deheubarth, this divided Wales into North Wales, Mid Wales and South Wales respectively. Gwynedd and the Aberffraw dynasty thrived with but a few interruptions until 1283.

From the successes of Rhodri and the seniority of Anarawd among his sons the Aberffraw family claimed primacy over all other Welsh lords including the powerful kings of Powys and Deheubarth. In &quot;The History of Gruffudd ap Cynan&quot;, written in the late 12th century, the family asserted its rights as the senior line of descendants from Rhodri the Great who had conquered most of Wales during his lifetime. Gruffudd ap Cynan&#x27;s biography was first written in Latin and intended for a wider audience outside Wales. The significance of this claim was that the Aberffraw family owed nothing to the English king for its position in Wales and that they held authority in Wales &quot;by absolute right through descent,&quot; wrote historian John Davies.

The House of Aberffraw was displaced in 942 by Hywel Dda, a King of Deheubarth from a junior line of descent from Rhodri Mawr. This occurred because Idwal Foel, the King of Gwynedd, was determined to cast off English overlordship and took up arms against the new English king, Edmund I. Idwal and his brother Elisedd were both killed in battle against Edmund&#x27;s forces. By normal custom Idwal&#x27;s crown should have passed to his sons, Ieuaf and Iago ab Idwal, but Hywel Dda intervened and sent Iago and Ieuaf into exile in Ireland and established himself as ruler over Gwynedd until his death in 950 when the House of Aberffraw was restored. Nonetheless, surviving manuscripts of &quot;Cyfraith Hywel&quot; recognise the importance of the lords of Aberffraw as overlords of Wales along with the rulers of Deheubarth.

Between 986 and 1081 the throne of Gwynedd was often in contention with the rightful kings frequently displaced by rivals within and outside the realm. One of these, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, originally from Powys, displaced the Aberffraw line from Gwynedd making himself ruler there, and by 1055 was able to make himself king of most of Wales. He became powerful enough to present a real menace to England and annexed some neighbouring parts after several victories over English armies. Eventually, he was defeated by Harold Godwinson in 1063 and later killed by his own men in a deal to secure peace with England. Bleddyn ap Cynfyn and his brother Rhiwallon of the Mathrafal dynasty of Powys, Gruffudd&#x27;s maternal half-brothers, came to terms with Harold and took over the rule of Gwynedd and Powys.

Shortly after the Norman conquest of England in 1066 the Normans began to exert pressure on the eastern border of Gwynedd. They were helped by internal strife following the killing of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn in 1075 by his second cousin Rhys ap Owain King of Deheubarth. Another relative of Bleddyn&#x27;s Trahaearn ap Caradog seized the throne but was soon challenged by Gruffudd ap Cynan, the exiled grandson of Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig who had been living in the Norse–Gael stronghold of Dublin. In 1081 Trahaearn was killed by Gruffudd in battle and the ancient line of Rhodri Mawr was restored.

== Gwynedd in the High Middle Ages ==
===Gruffudd ap Cynan===
The Aberffraw dynasty suffered various depositions by rivals in Deheubarth, Powys, and England in the 10th and 11th centuries. Gruffudd ap Cynan (c. 1055–1137), who grew up in exile in Norse–Gael Dublin, regained his inheritance following his victory at the Battle of Mynydd Carn in 1081 over his Mathrafal rivals then in control of Gwynedd. However, Gruffudd&#x27;s victory was short-lived as the Normans launched an invasion of Wales following the Saxon revolt in northern England, known as the Harrowing of the North.

Shortly after the Battle of Mynydd Carn in 1081, Gruffudd was lured into a trap with the promise of an alliance but seized by Hugh d&#x27;Avranches, Earl of Chester, in an ambush near Corwen. Earl Hugh claimed the Perfeddwlad up to the River Clwyd (the commotes of Tegeingl and Rhufoniog; the modern counties of &quot;Denbighshire, Flintshire&quot;, and &quot;Wrexham&quot;) as part of Chester, and viewed the restoration of the Aberffraw family in Gwynedd as a threat to his own expansion into Wales. The lands west of the Clwyd were intended for his cousin Robert of Rhuddlan, and their advance extended to the Llŷn Peninsula by 1090. By 1094 almost the whole of Wales was occupied by Norman forces. However, although they erected many castles, Norman control in most regions of Wales was tenuous at best. Motivated by local anger over the &quot;gratuitously cruel&quot; invaders, and led by the historic ruling houses, Welsh control over the greater part of Wales was restored by 1100.

In an effort to further consolidate his control over Gwynedd, Earl Hugh of Chester had Hervey le Breton elected as Bishop of Bangor in 1092, and consecrated by Thomas of Bayeux, Archbishop of York. However, the Welsh parishioners remained hostile to Hervey&#x27;s appointment, and the bishop was forced to carry a sword with him and rely on a contingent of Norman knights for his protection. Additionally, Hervey routinely excommunicated parishioners who he perceived as challenging his spiritual and temporal authority.

Gruffudd escaped imprisonment in Chester and slew Robert of Rhuddlan in a beachside battle at Deganwy on 3 July 1093. Gruffudd recovered Gwynedd by 1095, and by 1098 Gruffudd allied with Cadwgan ap Bleddyn of the Mathrafal house of Powys, their traditional dynastic rivalry notwithstanding. Gruffudd and Cadwgan led the Welsh resistance to the Norman occupation in the north and mid-Wales. However, by 1098 Earl Hugh of Chester and Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury advanced their army to the Menai Strait, with Gruffudd and Cadwgan regrouping on defensible Anglesey, where they planned to make retaliatory strikes from their island fortress. Gruffudd hired a Norse fleet from a settlement in Ireland to patrol the Menai and prevent the Norman army from crossing; however, the Normans were able to pay off the fleet to instead ferry &quot;them&quot; to Môn. Betrayed, Gruffudd and Cadwgan were forced to flee to Ireland in a skiff.

The Normans landed on Anglesey, and their furious &#x27;victory celebrations&#x27; which followed were exceptionally violent, with rape and carnage committed by the Norman army left unchecked. The earl of Shrewsbury had an elderly priest mutilated and made the church of Llandyfrydog a kennel for his dogs.

During the &#x27;celebrations&#x27; a Norse fleet led by Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway, appeared off the coast at Puffin Island, and in the battle that followed, known as the Battle of Anglesey Sound, Magnus shot dead the earl of Shrewsbury with an arrow to the eye. The Norse left as suddenly and as mysteriously as they had arrived, leaving the Norman army weakened and demoralized.

The Norman army retired to England, leaving a Welshman, Owain ab Edwin of Tegeingl, in command of a token force to control Ynys Môn (now Anglesey) and upper Gwynedd, and ultimately abandoning any colonisation plans there. Owain ap Edwin transferred his allegiance to Chester following the defeat of his ally Trahaearn ap Caradog in 1081, a move which earned him the epithet &quot;Bradwr&quot; &quot;the Traitor&quot; (), among the Welsh.

In late 1098 Gruffudd and Cadwgan landed in Wales and recovered Anglesey without much difficulty, with Hervé the Breton fleeing Bangor for safety in England. Over the course of the next three years, Gruffudd was able to recover upper Gwynedd to the Conwy, defeating Hugh, Earl of Chester. In 1101, after Earl Hugh&#x27;s death, Gruffudd and Cadwgan came to terms with England&#x27;s new king, Henry I, who was consolidating his own authority and also eager to come to terms. In the negotiations which followed Henry I recognised Gruffudd&#x27;s ancestral claims of Anglesey, Llŷn, Dunoding (Eifionydd and Ardudwy) and Arllechwedd, being the lands of upper Gwynedd to the Conwy which were already firmly in Gruffudd&#x27;s control. Cadwgan regained Ceredigion, and his share of the family inheritance in Powys, from the new earl of Shrewsbury, Robert of Bellême.

With the settlement reached between Henry I and Gruffudd, and other Welsh lords, the dividing of Wales between &quot;Pura Wallia&quot;, the lands under Welsh control; and &quot;Marchia Wallie&quot;, Welsh lands under Norman control, came into existence. Author and historian John Davies notes that the border shifted on occasion, &quot;in one direction and in the other&quot;, but remained more or less stable for almost the next two hundred years.

After generations of incessant warfare, Gruffudd began the reconstruction of Gwynedd, intent on bringing stability to his country. According to Davies, Gruffudd sought to give his people the peace to &quot;plant their crops in the full confidence that they would be able to harvest them&quot;. Gruffudd consolidated royal authority in north Wales, and offered sanctuary to displaced Welsh from the Perfeddwlad, particularly from Rhos, at the time harassed by Richard, 2nd Earl of Chester.

Alarmed by Gruffudd&#x27;s growing influence and authority in north Wales, and on pretext that Gruffudd sheltered rebels from Rhos against Chester, Henry I launched a campaign against Gwynedd and Powys in 1116, which included a vanguard commanded by King Alexander I of Scotland. While Owain ap Cadwgan of Ceredigion sought refuge in Gwynedd&#x27;s mountains, Maredudd ap Bleddyn of Powys made peace with the English king as the Norman army advanced. There were no battles or skirmishes fought in the face of the vast host brought into Wales; rather, Owain and Gruffudd entered into truce negotiations. Owain ap Cadwgan regained royal favour relatively easily. However, Gruffudd was forced to render homage and fealty and pay a heavy fine, though he lost no land or prestige.

The invasion left a lasting impact on Gruffudd, who by 1116 was in his 60s and with failing eyesight. For the remainder of his life, while Gruffudd continued to rule in Gwynedd, his sons Cadwallon, Owain, and Cadwaladr, would lead Gwynedd&#x27;s army after 1120. Gruffudd&#x27;s policy, which his sons would execute and later rulers of Gwynedd adopted, was to recover Gwynedd&#x27;s primacy without blatantly antagonising the English crown.

====The Expansion of Gwynedd====

In 1120 a minor border war between Llywarch ab Owain, lord of a commote in the Dyffryn Clwyd cantref, and Hywel ab Ithel, lord of Rhufoniog and Rhos, brought Powys and Chester into conflict in the Perfeddwlad. Powys brought a force of 400 warriors to the aid of its ally Rhufoniog, while Chester sent Norman knights from Rhuddlan to the aid of Dyffryn Clwyd. The bloody Battle of Maes Maen Cymro, fought northwest of Ruthin, ended with Llywarch ab Owain slain and the defeat of Dyffryn Clwyd. However, it was a pyrrhic victory as the battle left Hywel ab Ithel mortally wounded. In the last of his line, when Hywel ab Ithel died six weeks later, he left Rhufoniog and Rhos bereft. Powys, however, was not strong enough to garrison Rhufoniog and Rhos, nor was Chester able to exert influence inland from its coastal holdings of Rhuddlan and Degannwy. With Rhufoniog and Rhos abandoned, Gruffudd annexed the cantrefs.

On the death of Einion ap Cadwgan, lord of Meirionnydd, a quarrel engulfed his kinsmen on who should succeed him. Meirionnydd was then a vassal cantref of Powys, and the family there a cadet of the Mathrafal house of Powys. Gruffudd gave licence to his sons Cadwallon and Owain to press the opportunity the dynastic strife in Meirionnydd presented. The brothers raided Meirionnydd with the Lord of Powys as important there as he was in the Perfeddwlad. However, it would not be until 1136 that the cantref was firmly within Gwynedd&#x27;s control. Perhaps because of their support of Earl Hugh of Chester, Gwynedd&#x27;s rival, in 1124, Cadwallon slew the three rulers of Dyffryn Clwyd, his maternal uncles, bringing the cantref firmly under Gwynedd&#x27;s vassalage that year. And in 1125 Cadwallon slew the grandsons of Edwin ap Goronwy of Tegeingl, leaving Tegeingl bereft of lordship. However, in 1132 while on campaign in the commote of Nanheudwy, near Llangollen, &#x27;victorious&#x27; Cadwallon was defeated in battle and slain by an army from Powys. The defeat checked Gwynedd&#x27;s expansion for a time, &quot;much to the relief of the men of Powys&quot;, wrote historian Sir John Edward Lloyd (J.E Lloyd).

In 1136 a campaign against the Normans was launched from Gwynedd in revenge for the execution of Gwenllian ferch Gruffudd ap Cynan, the wife of the King of Deheubarth and the daughter of Gruffudd. When word reached Gwynedd of Gwenllian&#x27;s death and the revolt in Gwent, Gruffudd&#x27;s sons Owain and Cadwaladr invaded Norman controlled Ceredigion, taking Llanfihangle, Aberystwyth, and Llanbadarn. Liberating Llanbadarn, one local chronicler hailed Owain and Cadwaladr both as &quot;bold lions, virtuous, fearless and wise, who guard the churches and their indwellers, defenders of the poor [who] overcome their enemies, affording a safest retreat to all those who seek their protection&quot;. The brothers restored the Welsh monks of Llanbadarn, who had been displaced by monks from Gloucester brought there by the Normans who had controlled Ceredigion. By late September 1136, a vast Welsh host gathered in Ceredigion, which included the combined forces of Gwynedd, Deheubarth, and Powys, and met the Norman army at the Battle of Crug Mawr at Cardigan Castle. The battle turned into a rout, and then into a resounding defeat of the Normans.

When their father Gruffudd died in 1137, the brothers Owain and Cadwaladr were on a second campaign in Ceredigion and took the castles of Ystrad Meurig, Lampeter (&quot;Stephen&#x27;s Castle&quot;), and Castell Hywell (&quot;Humphries Castle&quot;) Gruffudd ap Cynan left a more stable realm than had hitherto existed in Gwynedd for more than 100 years. No foreign army was able to cross the Conwy into upper Gwynedd. The stability of Gruffudd&#x27;s long reign allowed Gwynedd&#x27;s Welsh to plan for the future without fear that home and harvest would &quot;go to the flames&quot; from invaders.

Settlements became more permanent, with buildings of stone replacing timber structures. Stone churches, in particular, were built across Gwynedd, with so many limewashed that &quot;Gwynedd was bespangled with them as is the firmament with stars&quot;. Gruffudd had built stone churches at his royal manors, and Lloyd suggests Gruffudd&#x27;s example led to the rebuilding of churches with stone in Penmon, Aberdaron, and Towyn in the Norman fashion.

Gruffudd promoted the primacy of the Episcopal See of Bangor in Gwynedd, and funded the building of Bangor Cathedral during the episcopate of David the Scot, Bishop of Bangor, between 1120 and 1139. Gruffudd&#x27;s remains were interred in a tomb in the presbytery of Bangor Cathedral.

Owain ap Gruffudd (Owain Gwynedd   23 or 28 November 1170) succeeded his father to the greater portion of Gwynedd in accordance with Welsh law, the &quot;Cyfraith Hywel&quot;, the Laws of Hywel; and became known as &quot;Owain Gwynedd&quot; to differentiate him from another Owain ap Gruffudd, the Mathrafal ruler of Powys, known as &quot;Owain Cyfeiliog&quot;. Cadwaladr, Gruffudd&#x27;s youngest son, inherited the commote of Aberffraw on Ynys Môn (now Anglesey), and the recently conquered Meirionydd and northern Ceredigion--&quot;i.e.&quot;, Ceredigion between the rivers Aeron and the Dyfi.

By 1141 Cadwaladr and Madog ap Maredudd of Powys led a Welsh vanguard as an ally of the Earl of Chester in the Battle of Lincoln, and joined in the rout which made Stephen of England a prisoner of Empress Matilda for a year Owain, however, did not participate in the battle, keeping the majority of Gwynedd&#x27;s army at home.

Owain and Cadwaladr came to blows in 1143 when Cadwaladr was implicated in the murder of King Anarawd ap Gruffudd of Deheubarth, Owain&#x27;s ally and future son-in-law, on the eve of Anarawd&#x27;s wedding to Owain&#x27;s daughter. Owain followed a diplomatic policy of binding other Welsh rulers to Gwynedd through dynastic marriages, and Cadwaladr&#x27;s border dispute and murder of Anarawd threatened Owain&#x27;s efforts and credibility. As ruler of Gwynedd, Owain stripped Cadwaladr of his lands, with Owain&#x27;s son Hywel dispatched to Ceredigion, where he burned Cadwaladr&#x27;s castle at Aberystwyth. Cadwaladr fled to Ireland and hired a Norse fleet from Dublin, bringing the fleet to Abermenai to compel Owain to reinstate him. This same fleet of ships would be considered a sizeable one to be able to face the fleet of Stephen, King of England, as well as The Irish and Scottish at Abermenai Point prior in 1142. Taking advantage of the brotherly strife, and perhaps with the tacit understanding of Cadwaladr, the marcher lords mounted incursions into Wales. Realizing the wider ramifications of the war before him, Owain and Cadwaladr came to terms and reconciled, with Cadwaladr restored to his lands. Peace between the brothers held until 1147, when an unrecorded event occurred which led Owain&#x27;s sons Hywel and Cynan to drive Cadwaladr out of Meirionydd and Ceredigion, with Cadwaladr retreating to Môn. Again an accord was reached, with Cadwaladr retaining Aberffraw until a more serious breach occurred in 1153 when he was forced into exile in England, where his wife was the sister of Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Hertford and the niece of Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester.

In 1146 news reached Owain that his favoured eldest son and heir, Rhun ab Owain Gwynedd, died. Owain was overcome with grief, falling into a deep depression from which none could console him until news reached him that Mold Castle in Tegeingl had fallen to Gwynedd, &quot;[reminding Owain] that he had still a country for which to live,&quot; wrote historian Sir John Edward Lloyd.

Between 1148 and 1151, Owain I of Gwynedd fought against Madog ap Maredudd of Powys, Owain&#x27;s son-in-law, and against the Earl of Chester for control of Iâl (Yale), with Owain having secured Rhuddlan Castle and all of Tegeingl from Chester. &quot;By 1154 Owain had brought his men within sight of the red towers of the great city on the Dee&quot;, wrote Lloyd.&quot;

Having spent three years consolidating his authority in the vast Angevin Empire, Henry II of England resolved on a strategy against Owain I of Gwynedd by 1157. By now, Owain&#x27;s enemies had joined Henry II&#x27;s camp, enemies such as his wayward brother Cadwaladr and in particular the support of Madog of Powys. Henry II raised his feudal host and marched into Wales from Chester. Owain positioned himself and his army at Dinas Basing (Basingwerk), barring the road to Rhuddlan, setting up a trap in which Henry II would send his army along the direct road on the coast, while he crossed through the woods to out-flank Owain. The King of Gwynedd anticipated this, and dispatched his sons Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd and Cynan into the woods with an army, catching Henry II unaware.

In the melee which followed Henry II might have been slain had not Roger de Clare, 2nd Earl of Hertford, rescued the king. Henry II retreated and made his way back to his main army, by now slowly advancing towards Rhuddlan. Not wishing to engage the Norman army directly, Owain repositioned himself first at St. Asaph, then further west, clearing the road for Henry II to enter into Rhuddlan &quot;ingloriously&quot;. Once in Rhuddlan Henry II received word that his naval expedition had failed, as instead of meeting Henry II at Degannwy or Rhuddlan, it had gone to plunder Anglesey, this resulted in the Battle of Ewloe, and has since been commemorated with a plaque 850 years after the battle of 1157, during 2007.

In a later letter to the Byzantine emperor, Henry probably recalled these experiences when he wrote, &quot;A people called Welsh, so bold and ferocious that, when unarmed, they do not fear to encounter an armed force, being ready to shed their blood in defence of their country, and to sacrifice their lives for renown.&quot;

The naval expedition was led by Henry II&#x27;s maternal uncle (Empress Matilda&#x27;s half-brother), Henry FitzRoy; and when they landed on Môn, Henry FitzRoy had the churches of Llanbedr Goch and Llanfair Mathafarn Eithaf torched. During the night the men of Môn gathered together, and the next morning fought and defeated the Norman army, with Henry FitzRoy falling under a shower of lances. The defeat of his navy and his own military difficulties had convinced Henry II that he had &quot;gone as far as was practical that year&quot; in his effort to subject Owain, and the King offered terms.

Owain I of Gwynedd, &quot;ever prudent and sagacious&quot;, recognised that he needed time to further consolidate power, and agreed to the terms. Owain was to render homage and fealty to the King, and resign Tegeingl and Rhuddlan to Chester, and restore Cadwaladr to his possessions in Gwynedd.

The death of Madog ap Meredudd of Powys in 1160 opened an opportunity for Owain I of Gwynedd to further press Gwynedd&#x27;s influence at the expense of Powys. However, Owain continued to further Gwynedd&#x27;s expansion without rousing the English crown, maintaining his &#x27;prudent policy&#x27; of &quot;Quieta non-movere&quot; (translated from Latin - &quot;do not move settled things&quot;). It was a policy of outward conciliation while masking his own consolidation of authority. To further demonstrate his goodwill, in 1160 Owain handed over to the English crown the fugitive Einion Clud. By 1162 Owain was in possession of the Powys cantref of Cyfeiliog, and its castle, Tafolwern; and ravaged another Powys cantref, Arwystli, slaying its lord, Hywel ab Ieuaf. Owain&#x27;s strategy was in sharp contrast to Rhys ap Gruffudd, King of Deheubarth, who in 1162 rose in open revolt against the Normans in south Wales, drawing Henry II back to England from the continent.

In 1163 Henry II quarrelled with Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, causing growing divisions between the king&#x27;s supporters and the archbishop&#x27;s supporters. With discontent mounting in England, Owain of Gwynedd joined with Rhys ap Gruffudd of Deheubarth in a second grand Welsh revolt against Henry II. England&#x27;s king, who only the prior year had pardoned Rhys ap Gruffudd for his 1162 revolt, assembled a vast host against the allied Welsh, with troops drawn from all over the Angevin empire assembling in Shrewsbury, and with the Norse of Dublin paid to harass the Welsh coast. While his army gathered on the Welsh frontier, Henry II left for the continent to negotiate a truce with France and Flanders to not disturb his peace while campaigning in Wales.

However, when Henry II returned to England he found that the war had already begun, with Owain&#x27;s son Dafydd raiding Angevin positions in Tegeingl, exposing the castles of Rhuddlan and Basingwerk to &quot;serious dangers&quot;, wrote Lloyd. Henry II rushed to north Wales for a few days to shore up defences there, before returning to his main army now gathering in Oswestry.

The vast host gathered before the allied Welsh principalities represented the largest army yet assembled for their conquest, a circumstance which further drew the Welsh allies into a closer confederacy, wrote Lloyd. With Owain I of Gwynedd the overall battle commander, and with his brother Cadwaladr as his second, Owain assembled the Welsh host at Corwen in the vale of Edeyrion where he could best resist Henry II&#x27;s advance.

The Angevin army advanced from Oswestry into Wales crossing the mountains towards Mur Castell and found itself in the thick forest of the Ceiriog Valley where they were forced into a narrow thin line. Owain I had positioned a band of skirmishers in the thick woods overlooking the pass, which harassed the exposed army from a secured position. Henry II ordered the clearing of the woods on either side to widen the passage through the valley and to lessen the exposure of his army. The road his army travelled later became known as the &quot;Ffordd y Saeson&quot;, the &quot;English Road&quot;, and leads through heath and bog towards the Dee. In a dry summer the moors may have been passable, but &quot;on this occasion the skies put on their most wintry aspect; and the rain fell in torrents [...] flooding the mountain meadows&quot; until the great Angevin encampment became a &quot;morass,&quot; wrote Lloyd. In the face of &quot;hurricane&quot; force of wind and rain, diminishing provisions and an exposed supply line stretching through a hostile country subject to enemy raids, and with a demoralised army, Henry II was forced into a complete retreat without even a semblance of a victory.

In frustration, Henry II had twenty-two Welsh hostages mutilated; the sons of Owain&#x27;s supporters and allies, including two of Owain&#x27;s own sons. In addition to his failed campaign in Wales, Henry&#x27;s mercenary Norse navy, which he had hired to harass the Welsh coast, turned out to be too few for use and were disbanded without engagement.

Henry II&#x27;s Welsh campaign was a complete failure, with the king abandoning all plans for the conquest of Wales, returning to his court in Anjou and not returning to England for another four years. Lloyd wrote:
It is true that [Henry II] did not cross swords with [Owain I], but the elements had done their work for [the Welsh]; the stars in their courses had fought against the pride of England and humbled it to the very dust. To conquer a land which was defended, not merely by the arms of its valiant and audacious sons, but also by tangled woods and impassable bogs, by piercing winds and pitiless storms of rain, seemed a hopeless task, and Henry resolved to no longer attempt it.

Owain expanded his international diplomatic offensive against Henry II by sending an embassy to Louis VII of France in 1168, led by Arthur of Bardsey, Bishop of Bangor (1166–1177), who was charged with negotiating a joint alliance against Henry II. With Henry II distracted by his widening quarrel with Thomas Becket, Owain&#x27;s army recovered Tegeingl for Gwynedd by 1169.

Lloyd quotes: &quot;The praises so repeatedly accorded to his many personal qualities by contemporary poets, and indeed by several public figures who could not have been predisposed in his favour, have so genuine a tone about them that the progressive trends in all the arts of peace and war discerned in 12th century Wales, it must be concluded, were in large measure due to the fostering genius of &#x27; Owain the Great.&#x27;&quot;

In his later reign Owain I was styled &quot;princeps Wallensium&quot;, Latin for the &quot;Prince of the Welsh&quot;, a title of substance given his leadership of the Welsh and victory against the English king, wrote historian Dr. John Davies. Additionally, Owain commissioned the &quot;Life of Gruffudd ap Cynan&quot;, the biography of his father in which Owain firmly asserted his primacy over other Welsh rulers by &quot;absolute right through descent&quot; from Rhodri the Great, according to Davies. Owain I was the eldest male descendant of Rhodri the Great through paternal descent.

The adoption of the title &quot;prince&quot; (Latin &quot;princeps&quot;, Welsh &quot;tywysog&quot;), rather than the king (Latin &quot;rex&quot;, Welsh &quot;brenin&quot;), did not mean a diminution in status, according to Davies. The use of the title &quot;prince&quot; was a recognition of the ruler of Gwynedd in relation to the wider international feudal world. The princes of Gwynedd exercised greater status and prestige than the earls, counts, and dukes of the Angevin empire, suggesting a similar status as that of the King of Scots, himself nominally a vassal of the King of England, argued Davies. As Welsh society became further influenced by feudal Europe, the princes of Gwynedd would in turn use feudalism to strengthen their own authority over lesser Welsh lords, a &quot;two-edged sword&quot; for the King of England, wrote Davies. Though Gwynedd&#x27;s princes recognised the &quot;de jure&quot; suzerainty of the King of England, there remained well-established Welsh law separate from English law, and were independent &quot;de facto&quot;, wrote Davies.

====Civil war, usurpation 11701195, and the Prince of Wales====
Welsh manuscripts and Annals state the events which unfolded during the end of the 12th century. This story of the Royal court of Gwynedd suffering an uprising stems from the Norman invasion of Wales a century prior to the civil strife of Owain Gwynedd and his immediate family. The internal wranglings for the crown of Gwynedd began with two sons, Rhun ab Owain Gwynedd and Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd, who were illegitimate, by Owain&#x27;s Irish wife Pyfog. Owain and his father, Gruffudd ap Cynan, both had a Norse-Irish connection in their immediate family and would have used this allegiance to their advantage, especially Gruffudd who hired and army fleets of ships to invade North Wales himself. In 1146, Hywel and Cadell ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth had combined their forces to battle against invading Normans who had built castles in west Wales, they took Carmarthen, Llanstephan, and Wiston castles.

Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd duly succeeded his father for a short-lived term during 1170. Due to the Norman invasion of Wales, the realm was in civil war, Princess-Dowager (wife of Owain Gwynedd) Cristin verch Goronwy who promoted her own son Dafydd ab Owain Gwynedd (Dafydd I/ David I) as Prince of Gwynedd ahead of Hywel and any other senior son of Owain Gwynedd. Dafydd I made his move, and within a few months of his succession, Hywel was overthrown and killed at the Battle of Pentraeth in 1171.

Due to splinter factions, the Kingdom&#x27;s royal family began to move away from Gwynedd, it is Maelgwn ab Owain Gwynedd (died after 1174 strife) who appeared to have gained Anglesey, whilst the sons of Cynan held the cantrefs of Meirionnydd, Eifionydd and Ardudwy between them . Dayfdd I was of Welsh royal stock, although his parents&#x27; union wasn&#x27;t recognised by the church, and he was deemed illegitimate (his parents Owain and Cristin were first cousins), he would still marry royalty, his wife being the half sister of Henry II. As a Prince, he made the most of his position as a son of Owain Gwynedd, and it was Dafydd I who waged a war on his brothers when he won the Crown at the battle of Pentraeth. Dafydd I, King of Gwynedd was his title, and his merciless rule continued when he used his powers to harass his brothers into leaving Gwynedd, at one stage in 1173 Dafydd I imprisoned all of his siblings except for Madoc and Maelgwn. It was Madoc (also known as Madog ab Owain Gwynedd) who after his father&#x27;s death is claimed to have set sail across the Atlantic Ocean and discovered America. After 3 years of Maelgwn possessing Anglesey he jailed him too. Eventually, Dafydd I was himself imprisoned by the future Prince of Wales Llywelyn the Great, that was after losing the Battle of Aberconwy against an alliance of Rhodri ab Owain, and the sons of Cynan ab Owain Gwynedd.

The following year he expelled all his remaining family rivals and made himself master of all Gwynedd and in 1175, Dafydd I imprisoned his brother Rhodri. During a revolt in 1173, Dafydd I adhered to Henry II as an ally, and it was agreed that Dafydd I would marry Emma of Anjou, who was Henry&#x27;s half-sister, and would receive the manor of Ellesmere as dowry.

All this was done, as the Brut y Tywysogion explained, &quot;because [Dafydd] thought he could hold his territory in peace thereby&quot;, but it proved insufficient. Before the end of 1175 Rhodri had escaped from captivity and gathered sufficient support to drive Dafydd I from the Royal household of Aberffraw, there appears to be no activity from Dafydd I for almost 20 years after 1175, until then the final battle at Aberconwy in 1197. Dafydd I may not have inherited the leadership abilities of his father but he had sufficient diplomatic qualities remaining to ensure he could live at peace with his neighbours. This appears to be the one quality recognised by his contemporaries as he was described by Giraldus Cambrensis as a man who showed &quot;good faith and credit by observing a strict neutrality between the Welsh and English&quot;.

His brother Rhodri had a more eventful time and fell out with the descendants of Cynan. They acted against Rhodri in 1190 and drove him out of Gwynedd altogether. Rhodri fled to the safety of the Isle of Man only to be briefly reinstated in 1193 with the assistance of Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles, and then driven out once more at the beginning of 1194, sharing the humiliation of his brother Dafydd ab Owain.

Dafydd Ist had a nemesis in his nephew Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, who was born most likely in the year 1173 and therefore only a child when all these events played out. Llywelyn&#x27;s father Iorwerth Drwyndwn had been involved in the early stages of the dynastic struggles and most likely died sometime around 1174, during the same time as the usurpation of Dafydd I. As the century drew to a close Llywelyn became a young man and decided to stake his claim to power in Gwynedd. He conspired with his cousins Gruffudd and Maredudd and his uncle Rhodri and in the year 1194 they all united against Dafydd I. Llywelyn fought battles throughout Wales, giving him the moniker &#x27;The great&#x27; as his ancestor Owain Gwynedd had attained. Having made alliances in his birth county of Powys and the county of the origins of his family Gwynedd, in north Wales, the stage was set for Llywelyn to dominate in battle and make alliances with the Crown of England, similar to his predecessor Dafydd I. Llywelyn married Joan, Lady of Wales, the daughter of John, King of England.

==Prince of Wales &quot;(de facto)&quot;==

=== Llywelyn I, the Great ===
&quot;See also Llywelyn ap Iorwerth&quot;
Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (117311 April 1240), later known as Llywelyn the Great (Llywelyn I), was sole ruler of Gwynedd by 1200, and made a treaty with King John of England the same year. Llywelyn&#x27;s relations with John remained good for the next ten years. He married John&#x27;s illegitimate daughter Joan, also known as Joanna, in 1205, and when John arrested Gwenwynwyn ab Owain of Powys in 1208 Llywelyn took the opportunity to annex southern Powys, Ceredigion and also he built Aberystwyth Castle. In 1210 relations deteriorated and John invaded Gwynedd in 1211. Llywelyn was forced to seek terms and to give up all his lands east of the River Conwy, but was able to recover these lands the following year in alliance with the other Welsh princes. He later allied himself with the barons who forced John to sign Magna Carta in 1215. By 1216 he was the dominant power in Wales, holding a council at Aberdyfi that year to apportion lands to the other princes. Llywelyn concluded the Treaty of Worcester with the next King of England, Henry III in 1218. The treaty formally recognised Llywelyn I as Prince of Wales.

During 12201230, Llywelyn bolstered his claim to the Kingship of Gwynedd by reinforcing his borders with castles being built around the Kingdom of Gwynedd, Criccieth, Deganwy, Dolbadarn, Dolwyddelan and Castell y Bere are among the best examples. The Peace of Middle treaty in 1234 marked the beginning of the end of his military exploits and virtually established peace for the rest of Llywelyn&#x27;s life. Having been on terms with his neighbouring compatriots, Llywelyn had taken to his wife&#x27;s style of fashioning royal court similar to that of the English Crown and also the same rules of court devised in 914 at the Aberffraw palace. The Prince convened a court with 35 household members, and 12 Royal mounted guards. In 1317, the llys was dismantled after 4 centuries and the wood taken to Caernarfon castle for repairs. The Royal palace consisted of positions similar to Royal Households of the United Kingdom used today in England.

Llywelyn followed the laws of Hywel Dda and attempted a succession process using the Welsh gavelkind custom of choosing an heir. Llywelyn promoted his younger son Dafydd II, and he customised the process of designating an heir to his own fruition by giving his eldest son Gruffudd lands to rule. Dafydd II was named heir with the support of King Henry III of England, during 1238 a Welsh Royal council of Princes was held at Strata Florida Abbey in honour of the heir of Gwynedd. Llywelyn in 1239 suffered a stroke and retired from active work in the Welsh government, he died only a year later in 1240.

===Prince Dafydd II===
Prince Dafydd II (Dafydd ap Llywelyn / David II, March 121225 February 1246), the son of Llywelyn the Great was installed as heir of Gwynedd by the Prince of Wales. While King Henry III of England had accepted Dafydd II and his Royal claims to Gwynedd and Wales, Henry invaded Gwynedd, and Dafydd II was forced to negotiate peace near St. Asaph, on 29 August 1241, under the terms of the Treaty of Gwerneigron, Dafydd II gave up all his lands outside Gwynedd. Dafydd II was ruthless with his power, like his predecessors he&#x27;d imprisoned his own brother, once for 6 years, and again in Criccieth and then in the Tower of London. It was the Bishop of Bangor who negotiated letting Prince Gruffudd move to a better location in London. Gruffudd fell to his death in March 1244 while trying to escape from the Tower of London by climbing down a knotted sheet.

With his main rival dead, Dafydd formed an alliance with other Welsh rulers and began a campaign against the English occupation of parts of Wales, all the while communicating with Pope Innocent IV in the Vatican City, Rome, talking about the powers bestowed on him by his predecessors as the ruler of Gwynedd. After savage fighting, the campaign was successful, however, Llywelyn&#x27;s former seneschal Sir Tudur ap Ednyfed Fychan was captured by Henry III&#x27;s forces in September 1245 in the battle against Dafydd II, yet Tudur was released in 1247 after swearing fealty to the King of England. Dafydd II died a sudden and natural death on 25 February 1246, this brought a halt to the succession crisis which was fuelling the wars, his widow Isabella de Braose returned to England, living in Haverford, she died 2 years later.

===Prince Llywelyn II, the Last===
Prince Llywelyn II (, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, 122311 December 1282) was living in Gwynedd at the time of his succession to the throne and had fought alongside his uncle Dafydd II during the last campaign of his reign. This gave him an advantage over his elder brother Owain who had been imprisoned in England with his father since 1242. Owain returned to Gwynedd from England, immediately after the news of the death of Prince Dafydd the IInd. Llywelyn and Owain were able to come to an agreement during an arranged peace accord by King Henry III of England, the Treaty of Woodstock, they were to share a realm west of Conwy, the treaty only lasted 8 years.

The younger brother of Llywelyn II was Dafydd III, who had come of age by 14 and was invited by Henry III to pay homage in 1253. But in the spirit of his ancestors, he went to battle with his brother by forming an alliance with their other brother Owain and fought at the Battle of Bryn Derwin where they met with respective armies. Llywelyn II in victory imprisoned his brothers Owain (until 1277), and Dafydd III for around a years time, Dafydd III eventually gained favour by 1277 working in conjunction with the Crown of England by gaining land on the northern border of England and Wales, Dafydd III married Elizabeth Ferrers and had offspring, while Owain was given the title Lord of Llŷn. Llywelyn was seen as a figurehead for the new state of Wales but had to coordinate with the newly formed Norman dynasty neighbouring to the east of Gwynedd, this was formalised with the Treaty of Montgomery later in 1267.

With his brothers out of contention, Llyewlyn II was the sole ruler and this allowed for over a decade of unbroken military success, aided by the weakness of the Crown of England and the support of his seneschal Goronwy ab Ednyfed, he triumphed in battle by reuniting north Wales. Llywelyn II made an alliance with the Montfort family, marrying Eleanor de Montfort in 1275. Eleanor was the daughter of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, who had been integral in the English civil war by rebelling during the Second Barons&#x27; War. This time it was another Pope, Clement IV who negotiated peace with the Welsh Prince, insisting to disassociate from the Monforts after the Battle of Evesham. Llywelyn II and Montfort married twice, once in secret in 1275, and once again after the marriage was given consent by the new brother-in-law of Llywelyn II, Edward I, only after Eleanor herself was placed under house arrest for three years for passing through Bristol with her father&#x27;s banner on board a ship, their daughter Gwenllian ferch Llywelyn was orphaned before her first birthday, she was the last of her line.

Succession would continue with a new King of England, Edward I would later acquire the title of the Prince of Wales. The Treaty of Aberconwy was signed in 1277 by Llywelyn II, it was a formal agreement to hand over the power Gwynedd he had accumulated throughout Wales, and the new House of Plantagenet was of French, Norman origins. However Llywelyn&#x27;s brother Dafydd III still had different ideas, it was he who provoked the incident by attacking Hawarden castle on Palm Sunday in 1282. Later on in November 1282 the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Peckham, visited North Wales to mediate any potential conflict between sovereigns. Prince Llywelyn II was offered a financial incentive, and an English estate for his family, only if he were to surrender Gwynedd&#x27;s territory to Edward. Llywelyn II rejected the offer. The next month, on 11 December 1282, after not being recognised Llywelyn was killed in an ambush. His head sent to London, his body interred to Abbeycwmhir.

===Prince Dafydd III ===
After generations of civil strife in Gwynedd, it was Dafydd ap Gruffydd (David III, 11 July3 October 1283) named Dafydd III, the grandson of Llywelyn the Great who was next to gain the Prince of Wales title. From the offset it was Dafydd III who was immersed in Royal life representing the Welsh royal family. During 1253, Dafydd III attended an event and paid homage to the English court with Queen Eleanor, and Richard of Cornwall, as Henry III was in Gascony. That era however was the starting point for military campaigns against his brother Llywelyn II from 1255, Llywelyn II jailed him for a year after the battle of Bryn Derwin. Dafydd III 1263 revolted against Llywelyn II once more, this time failing badly enough to flee to England, and a year later was offered the lands of the English rebel Baron Boteler after the battle of Evesham during an English civil war. Dafydd III had joined the English court life with Henry III and was in England until 1267. Again it was another Pope, Ottobuono, Adrian V who negotiated between the Royal families of England and Wales, peace ensued in Wales for another 6 years when Dafydd III was councillor to his brother, the Prince of Wales. Peace ensues until another coup is formed involving Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn Prince of Powys (whose father was arrested by King John), and falls apart due to severe storms. Dafydd III was forced to flee to England once more, this time pledging allegiance to King Edward I in 1274, and is decorated a knight and considered a friend. Years later in 1277, Dafydd III returns to haunt Wales accompanying Edward I, and on 16 August an agreement of peace is made as to how to share the spoils of war, by 10 November Llywelyn I submits to the English Crown at the Treaty of Aberconwy. The lands of Snowdonia, Anglesey, and Penllyn (cantref) are shared amongst the Princes and a dowry is given to Dafydd III, along with an estate in Cheshire and a consented marriage to the daughter of a former adversary, William de Ferrers the 5th Earl of Derby.

Later in his life, after returning to Wales, Dafydd III changes alliance once again and continues to fight against the English Crown at risk of being a traitor. The Welsh courts had kept the support of Goronowy ap Heilin, the seneschal of Gwynedd who also supported his brother Llywelyn II, Goronwy was the Lord of Rhôs. Dafydd III also had the support of Hywel ap Rhys Gryg son of Rhys Gryg, and his brother Rhys Wyndod, the disinherited princes of Deheubarth. Dafydd III had rekindled his ancestors wish for Welsh Independence, however the involvement in rebellion had been against agreements in place the treaty of Aberconwy. The provocation on 22 March, Palm Sunday in 1282 was an attack on Hawarden castle and was the final conflict of the Kingdom of Gwynedd.

Dafydd III, like his brothers had incurred the wrath of the English forces, the Norman army encircled Snowdonia and starved the Welsh people, Dafydd III was soon moving desperately from one fort to another as effective resistance was systematically crushed. Dolwyddelan Castle, which was at risk of becoming encircled and trapped, was the first castle to be abandoned on 18 January 1283. The next was Dolbadarn Castle, the castle served as a base, but by March of that year, this noble site in the heartland of Snowdonia was also under threat from foreign forces and Dafydd III was forced to retreat once again. Finally, Dafydd III moved his headquarters south to Castell y Bere near Llanfihangel-y-pennant. From this point forward the Prince, royal family, and remaining members of the Welsh government were all fugitives on the run, sleeping outdoors whilst being forced to keep moving from place to place to avoid capture. Castell Y Bere&#x27;s starving garrison would eventually surrender on 25 April and then be given to William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke. After the fall of Y Bere, Dafydd III&#x27;s movements are speculative but he is recorded in May 1283 as leading raids from the mountains, supported by his seneschal Goronwy ap Heilyn, and Prince&#x27;s of Deheubarth, Hywel ap Rhys and Rhys Wyndod.

&quot;The last months saw inward disintegration as well as submission to superior force. Nevertheless, Goronwy ap Heilin had committed himself to the struggle and died in rebellion, alongside the disinherited princes who stood with Dafydd ap Gruffudd in the last springtime of the principality of Wales, diehards who knew that theirs was not the heroism of a new beginning but the ultimate stand of the very last cohort clutching the figment of the political order that they had once been privileged to know.&quot;

On 21 June 1283, Dafydd III was captured in the uplands above Abergwyngregyn close to Bera Mawr in a secret hiding place recorded as &quot;Nanhysglain&quot;. King Edward I decreed, in , and was caught by &quot;men of his own tongue&quot;. The last Royal family of Wales were imprisoned, and Dafydd III was executed by hanging in Shrewsbury for treason, his body was dismembered and he suffered same fate as his brother, Llywelyn II with his head put on a pole for display at the Tower of London, the bard Bleddyn Fardd made his elegy. After the capture of the last true Royal family of Gwynedd, the Princes, including Llywelyn ap Dafydd were imprisoned in Bristol Castle by the English Crown, and daughters became Nuns in Sempringham and other monasteries.

===Coat of arms===
Whilst there is no contemporary evidence of Llywelyn I bearing arms, The Welsh MSS of a later date mostly give the coat as: Quarterly Gules and Or, four lions passant gardant counter-changed, with some presenting the lions as passant (not gardant). He was however said to have granted arms to others such as Ednyfed Fychan, and so he probably bore arms himself. Contemporaneous evidence for the arms of Llywelyn’s sons Dafydd II and Gruffydd however are recorded with the lions simply as passant. That may be a strong indication that their father also bore the same. Significantly the arms of Dafydd and Gruffydd are inverted on account of Dafydd styling himself as Prince of Wales following the death of his brother and having rebelled against the Crown in 1245. Gruffydd (d. 1244) however had not rebelled, but because his arms were not distinguishable from those of Dafydd, they too were also inverted. Llywelyn’s grandsons Llywelyn II, Rhodri, Dafydd III and Owain Goch could not therefore adopt the arms of their father Gruffydd under the auspices of the Crown. Consequently, the arms of Llywelyn II, and the descendants of Rhodri are found to be: Quarterly Gules and Or, four lions rampant counter-changed; with Dafydd III adopting a differenced version of his father’s arms namely: Quarterly Or and Azure, four lions passant gardant counter-changed. 

==End of independence==

Following the death of Llywelyn II in 1282, and the execution of his brother Dafydd III the following year, eight centuries of independent rule by the House of Gwynedd came to an end, and the kingdom, which had long been one of the final holdouts to total English domination of Wales, was annexed to England. The remaining important members of the ruling house were all arrested and imprisoned for the remainder of their lives. Under the terms of the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 Wales was broken up and re-organised into six shires. The Snowdonia district in Gwynedd was made into three settlements, creating the counties of Anglesey, Carnarvonshire, Merionethshire, and the rest of Wales split beyond the Rivers Dee and Conwy, making Denbighshire and Flintshire in North Wales, and Cardigan and Carmarthen to the south of Wales.

The &quot;Pura Walia&quot; was the new definition for the Welsh marshland. Pura Wallia was effectively the new counties which had been Gwynedd, Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire and Marchia Wallie were defined through division of lands still held by the Welsh people and the Norman castles built in the Marchia Wallie. The Pura Walia continued to be within a nominal Principality of Wales ruled by the Council of Wales at Ludlow as a part of the English crown.

There were many Gwynedd-based rebellions after 1284 with varying degrees of success with most being led by peripheral members of the old royal house. In particular the rebellions of Prince Madoc in 1294, and of Owain Lawgoch (the great-nephew of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd) between 1372 and 1378 are most notable. Because of this the old royal house was purged and any surviving members went into hiding. A final rebellion in 1400 led by Owain Glyndŵr, a member of the rival royal house of Powys, also drew considerable support from within Gwynedd.

The title &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was recreated after Llywelyn II, Prince Edward (later Edward II) was conferred in 1301 at Caernarfon castle, beginning the Principality of Wales. The Welsh Marches would be merged with the principality in 1534 under the Council of Wales and the Marches until all separate governance for Wales. The penal system was eventually abolished, and as an administrative entity, the administrative entity the Marches of Wales was abolished by the joint reigns of King William III of England and Mary II of England (monarchs of England and Scotland combined) in 1689.

==Military==

According to Sir John Edward Lloyd, the challenges of campaigning in Wales were exposed during the 20-year Norman invasion. If a defender could bar any road, control any river-crossing or mountain pass, and control the coastline around Wales, then the risks of extended campaigning in Wales were too great.

The Welsh method of warfare during the reign of Henry II is described by Gerald of Wales in his work &quot;Descriptio Cambriae&quot; written c. 1190:

Their mode of fighting consists in chasing the enemy or in retreating. This light-armed people, relying more on their activity than on their strength, cannot struggle for the field of battle, enter into close engagement, or endure long and severe actions...though defeated and put to flight on one day, they are ready to resume the combat on the next, neither dejected by their loss, nor by their dishonour; and although, perhaps, they do not display great fortitude in open engagements and regular conflicts, yet they harass the enemy by ambuscades and nightly sallies. Hence, neither oppressed by hunger or cold, not fatigued by martial labours, nor despondent in adversity, but ready, after a defeat, to return immediately to action, and again endure the dangers of war.--&quot;The Historical Works of Giraldus Cambrensis translated by Sir Richard Colt-Hoare (1894), p.511&quot;

The Welsh were revered for the skills of their bowmen. Additionally, the Welsh learned from their Norman rivals. During the generations of warfare and close contact with the Normans, Gruffudd ap Cynan and other Welsh leaders learned the arts of knighthood and adapted them for Wales. By Gruffudd&#x27;s death in 1137, Gwynedd could field hundreds of heavy well-armed cavalry as well as their traditional bowmen and infantry.

They make use of light arms, which do not impede their agility, small coats of mail, bundles of arrows, and long lances, helmets and shields, and more rarely greaves plated with iron. The higher class go to battle mounted on swift and generous steeds, which their country produces; but the greater part of the people fight on foot, on account of the marshy nature and unevenness of the soil. The horsemen, as their situation or occasion requires, willingly serve as infantry, in attacking or retreating; and they either walk bare-footed, or make use of high shoes, roughly constructed with untanned leather. In time of peace, the young men, by penetrating the deep recesses of the woods, and climbing the tops of mountains, learn by practice to endure fatigue through day and night..--&quot;The Historical Works of Giraldus Cambrensis translated by Sir Richard Colt-Hoare (1894), p.491&quot;

In the end, Wales was defeated militarily by the improved ability of the English navy to blockade or seize areas essential for agricultural production such as Anglesey. With control of the Menai Strait, an invading army could regroup on Anglesey; without control of the Menai an army could be stranded there; and any occupying force on Anglesey could deny the vast harvest of the island to the Welsh.

Lack of food would force the disbandment of any large Welsh force besieged within the mountains. Following the occupation, Welsh soldiers were conscripted to serve in the English Army. During the revolt of Owain Glyndŵr the Welsh adapted the new skills they had learnt to guerrilla tactics and lightning raids. Owain Glyndŵr reputedly used the mountains with such advantage that many of the exasperated English soldieries suspected him of being a magician able to control the natural elements.

==Administration==

In early times Gwynedd (or &quot;Venedotia&quot;) may have been ruled from Chester, which is shown in the subsidiary title of the current Prince of Wales, Earl of Chester. After the Battle of Chester in 613 when the city fell to the Anglo-Saxons the royal court moved west to the stronghold at Deganwy Castle near modern Conwy. This site was destroyed by lightning in 812, rebuilt and destroyed again by Saxons in 822. Afterwards Aberffraw on Anglesey became the principal power base, with exceptions such as Gruffydd ap Llywelyn&#x27;s court at Rhuddlan. However, as the English fleet became more powerful and particularly after the Norman colonisation of Ireland began it became indefensible and from about 1200 until 1283, at Abergwyngregyn or simply called just &quot;Aber&quot; (its anglicised shortened form adopted by the Crown of England after the conquest) was the new family home of the &#x27;Lord of Snowdown&#x27; on the banks of the menai Strait. Joan, Lady of Wales, died there in 1237; Dafydd ap Llywelyn in 1246; Eleanor de Montfort, Lady of Wales, wife of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales (&quot;Tywysog Cymru&quot; in modern Welsh), on 19 June 1282, giving birth to a daughter, Gwenllian. The royal home was occupied and expropriated by the English Crown in early 1283.

The traditional sphere of Aberffraw&#x27;s influence in north Wales included the Isle of Anglesey (Ynys Môn) as their early seat of authority, and Gwynedd Uwch Conwy (&quot;Gwynedd above the Conwy&quot;, or &quot;upper Gwynedd&quot;), and the Perfeddwlad (&quot;the Middle Country&quot;) also known as Gwynedd Is Conwy (&quot;Gwynedd below the Conwy&quot;, or &quot;lower Gwynedd&quot;). Additional lands were acquired through vassalage or conquest, and by regaining lands lost to Marcher lords, particularly that of Ceredigion, Powys Fadog, and Powys Wenwynwyn. However, these areas were always considered an addition to Gwynedd, never part of it.
After the Norman conquest, the residents of Llanfaes were moved to make way for Beaumaris Castle on Anglesey. The newly built Llys Rhosyr replaced the now abandoned Llys Aberffraw was one of 3 main courts on Anglesey, only due to a sandstorm in 1332 the Llys also became disused and unattended until excavations in the 20th century. The courts () were administrative centres in the Kingdom, the courts were royal residences, but also were to collect taxes and function the same as a modern government building.

Gwynedd was traditionally divided into using nature as borders, the rivers Conwy and Dee were used to define lands in relation to the counties. Gwynedd Uwch Conwy and Gwynedd Is Conwy (with the River Conwy forming the border), which included Anglesey (Môn). The kingdom of the Princes of Snowdonia was administered under Welsh custom through thirteen &quot;Cantrefi&quot; each containing, in theory, one hundred settlements or &quot;Trefi&quot;. Most cantrefs were also divided into cymydau (English commotes). A complete census was created in the Red Book of Hergest during the end of the 14th century.

== Legacy ==
Following Edward&#x27;s conquest, the lands of Gwynedd proper were divided among the English counties of Anglesey, Caernarfonshire, Merionethshire, Denbighshire, and Flintshire. The Local Government Act 1972 reformed these, creating a new county (now called a &quot;preserved county&quot;) of Gwynedd which comprised Anglesey and Llyn, Arfon, Dunoding, and Meirionydd on the mainland. The modern principal area of Gwynedd established by the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 no longer includes Anglesey.

<text>HMAS &quot;Onslow&quot; (SS 60/SSG 60) is one of six s, previously operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The submarine was named after the town of Onslow, Western Australia, and Sir Alexander Onslow, with the boat&#x27;s motto and badge derived from Onslow&#x27;s family heritage. Ordered in 1963, &quot;Onslow&quot; was laid down at the end of 1967 by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Scotland, launched almost a year later, and commissioned into the RAN at the end of 1969.

During her career, &quot;Onslow&quot; became the first conventionally powered submarine to be fitted with anti-ship missiles, and was successful in wargames, &quot;sinking&quot; a seven-ship flotilla during Exercise Kangaroo 3 in 1980 and the United States supercarrier at RIMPAC 1998.

After being decommissioned in March 1999, &quot;Onslow&quot; was then presented to the Australian National Maritime Museum in April, where she is preserved as a museum ship.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Onslow&quot; is one of four &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines ordered in 1963. The last of this group, &quot;Onslow&quot; was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Co. in Greenock, Scotland on 4 December 1967. She was launched by Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy on 3 December 1968, and commissioned into the RAN on 22 December 1969. The boat was named after the coastal town of Onslow, Western Australia, which was in turn named after Sir Alexander Onslow, the third Chief Justice of Western Australia. &quot;Onslow&quot;″s motto, &quot;Festina Lente&quot; (Latin for &quot;Hasten Slowly&quot;), is shared with the Onslow family, and the ship&#x27;s badge contains a judge&#x27;s wig. Although this was the only use of the name by the RAN, two surface ships of the Royal Navy have previously been named .
The submarine is long, with a beam of , and a draught of when surfaced. At full load displacement, &quot;Onslow&quot; displaces 2,030 tons when surfaced, and 2,410 tons when submerged. The two propeller shafts are each driven by an English Electric motor providing 3,500 brake horsepower and 4,500 shaft horsepower; the electricity for these is generated by two Admiralty Standard Range supercharged V16 diesel generators. These can propel the submarine at up to on the surface, and up to when submerged. &quot;Onslow&quot; has a maximum range of at , and a test depth of below sea level. When launched, the boat had a company of 8 officers and 56 sailors, but by the time she was decommissioned, the number of sailors had increased to 60. In addition, up to 16 trainees could be carried.

Unlike other submarines in her class, &quot;Onslow&quot; is fitted with a four-man diver access hatch, allowing for easier deployment and recovery of special forces divers.

===Armament===
The main armament of &quot;Onslow&quot; are six bow torpedo tubes, capable of firing torpedoes or releasing sea mines. The British Mark 8 torpedo was initially carried by the submarine; this was replaced by the wire-guided Mark 23. During a refit from 1982 to 1984, &quot;Oberon&quot; became the first conventionally-powered submarine in the world to be fitted with anti-ship missiles—specifically, the UGM-84 Sub Harpoon. At the same time, the Mark 23 torpedoes were replaced by the United States Mark 48 wire-guided torpedo. As of 1996, the standard payload of &quot;Onslow&quot; was a mix of 20 Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and Sub Harpoon missiles. Some or all of the torpedo payload could be replaced by Mark 5 Stonefish sea mines, which were deployed through the torpedo tubes.

The submarine&#x27;s secondary armament consisted of two stern-mounted, short-length torpedo tubes: these were intended for use against pursuing submarines, but the development of steerable wire-guided torpedoes shortly after the boat entered service made these redundant, and they were closed off during the 1982–84 refit. The aft tubes fired Mark 20 anti-submarine torpedoes.

==Operational history==

===1970–1981===
&quot;Onslow&quot; arrived in Sydney at the conclusion of her delivery voyage to Australia on 4 July 1970. On board was Vice Admiral Sir Victor Smith, at the time the Chief of Naval Staff, who had embarked at Brisbane. The boat visited Pearl Harbor later that year; arriving without being detected by the USN until she surfaced in the middle of the harbour. &quot;Onslow&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor in 1971 to participate in the RIMPAC multinational naval exercise. During the exercise, a practice torpedo fired by the United States Coast Guard Cutter failed to disengage as designed and hit the submarine—the only damage was a small dent near the stern.

&quot;Onslow&quot; became the first vessel of the RAN to be assigned to the ANZUK force in Singapore on 22 July 1972. During another ANZUK deployment, in 1974, the boat&#x27;s attack periscope was damaged when it came in contact with the log probe of the frigate . The boat returned to Australia on 18 December. On 5 May 1975, &quot;Onslow&quot; began a two-year refit at Cockatoo Island Dockyard, becoming the first Australian submarine to use the dockyard&#x27;s new slave dock. This dock had been built specifically for refit work on &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines, and was the main location of all &quot;Onslow&quot;″s refits until 1990. In 1977, &quot;Onslow&quot; was presented with the Gloucester Cup, marking her as the most efficient warship in the RAN during the previous year—&quot;Onslow&quot; was the first submarine to receive the award.
In 1980, &quot;Onslow&quot; participated in Exercise Kangaroo 3 as an opposing submarine. During the exercise, &quot;Onslow&quot; carried out successful simulated attacks on all seven surface ships involved in the exercise without being &#x27;sunk&#x27; herself, including a simultaneous &#x27;attack&#x27; on two United States Navy (USN) amphibious warfare vessels and a RAN replenishment ship while they were under escort by the other four warships. To indicate her success, the submarine flew a Jolly Roger from her communications mast upon her return to port, which was marked with the silhouettes of her seven targets: the s and , the , the , the , the , and the .

On 1 March 1981, &quot;Onslow&quot; participated in wargames with a Royal New Zealand Navy frigate off the coast of Sydney. While operating at periscope depth, the submarine spotted an &#x27;enemy&#x27; P-3C Orion aircraft and stopped snorting (the process of taking in air to operate the boat&#x27;s two diesel generators and expelling the produced exhaust through a snorkel) in preparation to go deep. Both generators were turned off, but upon diving, it was quickly discovered that the starboard diesel had failed to switch off or had restarted and as the exhaust snorkel was sealed, the carbon monoxide exhaust filled the submarine. &quot;Onslow&quot; rapidly resurfaced, and the exhaust was pumped from the submarine. Able Seaman Christopher Passlow, who had been on the lower deck of the submarine at the time, died of asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning, while another eighteen were rendered unconscious or were convulsing because of blood poisoning. Upon returning to base, doctors found that one-third of the 66 survivors had absorbed twice the lethal limit of carbon monoxide into their blood. The crew onboard were taken to Soldiers Beach surf club and provided with free alcohol for 3 days before returning back to duties. They were not compensated in any other way as stated they were by the RAN.

The RAN Board of Inquiry into the incident concluded that the accident was caused by human error—the duty engineer failed to shut down both engines—but members of &quot;Onslow&quot;″s complement disagree with this, claiming the problem to be mechanical in origin. Changes were made to Submarine Service operating procedures as a result of the Inquiry, but the investigation and subsequent report remained classified until 2009, when the information was acquired by the &quot;Sunday Night&quot; newsmagazine program under the Freedom of Information Act. When interviewed by &quot;Sunday Night&quot; in March 2009, the deputy Chief of Navy, Rear Admiral Davyd Thomas (who had been Passlow&#x27;s divisional officer prior to the incident) promised counselling for the survivors, and claimed that prior treatment of the &quot;Onslow&quot; submariners was due to a limited understanding of post-traumatic stress disorder back in the 1980s.

===1982–1990===
&quot;Onslow&quot; underwent a modernisation refit from 1982 until 1984, becoming the third Australian &quot;Oberon&quot; to be modernised. As part of the modernisation, integrated data processing and fire control systems were installed, and the boat was fitted with Micropuffs passive ranging sonar. The torpedo payload was upgraded to the United States Mark 48 wire-guided torpedo. In addition to new torpedoes, the modernisation allowed &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines to carry and fire the Harpoon anti-ship missile through the torpedo tubes: &quot;Onslow&quot; became the first conventionally-powered submarine in the world to be fitted with guided anti-ship missiles.

&quot;Onslow&quot; was the first Australian submarine to visit the west coast of the United States of America when she arrived in San Diego on 17 July 1985. The boat made goodwill visits to the cities of San Francisco and Seattle during mid-August, before participating in the Royal Fleet Review for the 75th anniversary of the Royal Canadian Navy.

&quot;Onslow&quot;″s &quot;safe to dive&quot; certificate ran out just after Christmas 1989. The Australian government had been trialling a program whereby refit work was tendered out to the private sector; delays in selecting the winning company and allocating the funds meant that an 18-month refit of the submarine scheduled to begin at the start of 1990 did not commence on time. Australian Defence Industries (ADI) was awarded the $100 million refit contract for &quot;Onslow&quot; and sister submarine in July. Cockatoo Island&#x27;s slave dock was transferred to the ADI facilities at Garden Island in November 1990, and was used for the refit. It was later found, during arbitration between the Australian Government and Cockatoo Island Dockyard for various issues, that by tendering out the submarine refits to other companies, the government was in breach of contract with the Dockyard; A$17.3 million in compensation was awarded to the dockyard in August 1996 for loss of profits and overhead costs.

===1990–1999===
In the early 1990s, four of &quot;Onslow&quot;″s sister boats were decommissioned from service. By 1996, &quot;Onslow&quot; and &quot;Otama&quot; were the only members of the class in active service.

During 1995, &quot;Onslow&quot; was deployed to South East Asia. During this deployment, the personnel of &quot;Onslow&quot; were involved in a controversial line-crossing ceremony while operating near the equator. During this particular ceremony, normally intended to induct new sailors into the &#x27;court of King Neptune&#x27;, the victims were verbally and physically abused, had their pelvises and genitals covered in what was described as a &quot;blistering concoction&quot;, then thrown overboard and forced to stay there until the rest of the company permitted them on board. When one of the victimised sailors complained to superiors, he became subject to several administrative errors and inconveniences, to the point where he was forced to resign a year later. The sailor acquired a copy of a videotape made of the ceremony and presented it to the Nine Network, which broke the story on 6 July 1999. An inquiry into the incident aboard &quot;Onslow&quot; was held, which found that although guidelines had been developed in the years after the incident to prevent harassment in the Australian Defence Force, disciplinary charges against the sailors involved could not be laid, as more than three years had passed since the offence. The inquiry also stated that while line-crossing ceremonies would continue to be held aboard RAN vessels, they would be supervised by a non-involved member of the crew to prevent similar extreme situations developing. The deployment ended in December, with &quot;Onslow&quot; visiting her namesake town for the last time on her return to Australia.

On the evening of 16 April 1997, three Australian Special Air Service Regiment soldiers were injured when they were thrown from their Zodiac boat during launch and recovery exercises with the submarine. Later that year, in November, &quot;Onslow&quot; participated in a joint RAN-RAAF exercise off the coast of Western Australia. Over the end of 1997 and the start of 1998, &quot;Onslow&quot; and &quot;Otama&quot; were used for trials of the Australian-designed Narama towed array sonar. The Narama sonar was one of the towed arrays under consideration for incorporation with the under-developments, and was the array selected.

In mid-1998, the date of &quot;Onslow&quot;″s decommissioning was announced for early 1999. Representatives from the town of Onslow, Western Australia requested that the submarine visit her namesake town before decommissioning, but were informed that the submarine&#x27;s planned operational schedule could not accommodate such a visit. As part of this schedule, &quot;Onslow&quot; participated in the 1998 RIMPAC exercise. The submarine had to pull out of the early part of the exercise: a resistor in the motor room switchboard had begun to smoke, forcing &quot;Onslow&quot; to return to Pearl Harbor for repairs. She departed on 12 July, but was forced to return less than 24 hours later when a smouldering smell was noticed. During the latter part of RIMPAC 98, on the morning of 10 August, &quot;Onslow&quot; located the &#x27;enemy&#x27; , closed to within without being detected, then released green flares to indicate her location, &#x27;sinking&#x27; the supercarrier. From 7 November onwards, &quot;Onslow&quot; was used as the target submarine for the annual Fincastle competition. &quot;Onslow&quot; operated on a secret patrol course south of Kangaroo Island while aircraft from the competing Australian, British, Canadian, and New Zealand air forces attempted to locate and &#x27;sink&#x27; her. No. 5 Squadron RNZAF was declared the winner, although all teams were successful in locating the submarine during at least one of their three attempts.

==Decommissioning and preservation==

 &quot;Onslow&quot; was decommissioned from service on 30 March 1999. While in service, &quot;Onslow&quot; travelled . On the same day, sister boat &quot;Otama&quot; was permanently reassigned to the submarine base at in Western Australia, clearing the way for the closure of .

The submarine was gifted to the Australian National Maritime Museum in April 1999. On 3 May 1999, the submarine was towed from &quot;Platypus&quot; to the museum at Darling Harbour. &quot;Onslow&quot; was docked next to , another warship belonging to the museum, and was officially opened to the public on 1 June 1999. &quot;Onslow&quot; is the second RAN submarine to be preserved as a museum ship; the first was sister submarine , which was decommissioned at the end of 1998 and installed at the Western Australian Maritime Museum. , she is one of seven &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines preserved in this manner.

On 22 November 2002, &quot;Onslow&quot; was taken by tugs to Garden Island for three weeks of maintenance in drydock. This included cleaning and repainting of the hull, replacement of the tributyltin coating used to prevent biofouling with a coating that was not harmful to marine organisms, and the sealing of several ballast tanks to improve the boat&#x27;s stability and raise the aft section relative to the waterline. &quot;Onslow&quot; was returned to the museum on 11 December, and re-opened to the public three days later. In October and November 2008, &quot;Onslow&quot; returned to Garden Island for maintenance and upkeep. During this refit, an additional torpedo was loaded into the submarine&#x27;s torpedo tubes and her hull was cleaned and painted. Another docking occurred on 18 May 2012, with hull cleaning, rust removal, repainting, and repairs to the boat&#x27;s aft torpedo tubes done before she returned to display on 6 June. In November 2015, the submarine was moved to the new Warships Pavilion &#x27;Action Stations&#x27; at the Australian National Maritime Museum alongside HMAS Vampire (D11) and HMAS Advance. In February 2018 Onslow was towed from the museum to Garden Island, Sydney, for regular maintenance in dry dock.

<text>HMAS &quot;Orion&quot; (S 61) was an of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). One of six submarines ordered by the RAN during the 1960s, &quot;Orion&quot;, named after the constellation in a break from ship-naming tradition, was built in Scotland and commissioned in 1977. &quot;Orion&quot; was one of two Oberon-class submarines designed for intelligence gathering and conducted regular patrols in Soviet, Indian and Chinese waters to gather information regarding enemy capabilities.

&quot;Orion&quot; was decommissioned in 1996, marked for disposal in 2003, and broken up for scrap in 2006. Several sections of the submarine remain intact as memorials and museum pieces.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Oberon&quot; class was based heavily on the preceding &quot;Porpoise&quot; class of submarines, with changes made to improve the vessels&#x27; hull integrity, sensor systems, and stealth capabilities. Eight submarines were ordered for the RAN, in two batches of four. The first batch was approved in 1963, and the second batch (including &quot;Orion&quot;) was approved during the late 1960s, although two of these were cancelled before construction started in 1969, with the funding redirected to the Fleet Air Arm. This was the fourth time the RAN had attempted to establish a submarine branch.

The submarine was long, with a beam of , and a draught of when surfaced. At full load displacement, she displaced 2,030 tons when surfaced, and 2,410 tons when submerged. The two propeller shafts were each driven by an English Electric motor providing 3,500 brake horsepower and 4,500 shaft horsepower; the electricity for these was generated by two Admiralty Standard Range supercharged V16 diesel generators. The submarine could travel at up to on the surface, and up to when submerged, had a maximum range of at , and a test depth of below sea level. When launched, the boat had a company of 8 officers and 56 sailors, but by the time she decommissioned, the number of sailors had increased to 60. In addition, up to 16 trainees could be carried. A small number of non-RAN personnel, most often from the Defence Signals Directorate, were also present during some intelligence gathering missions.

The main armament of the &quot;Oberon&quot;s consisted of six torpedo tubes. The British Mark 8 torpedo was initially carried by the submarine; this was later replaced by the wire-guided Mark 23. Between 1977 and 1985, the Australian &quot;Oberons&quot; were upgraded to carry United States Navy Mark 48 torpedoes and UGM-84 Sub Harpoon anti-ship missiles. As of 1996, the standard payload of an Australian &quot;Oberon&quot; was a mix of 20 Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and Sub Harpoon missiles. Some or all of the torpedo payload could be replaced by Mark 5 Stonefish sea mines, which were deployed through the torpedo tubes. On entering service, two stern-mounted, short-length torpedo tubes for Mark 20 anti-submarine torpedoes were fitted. However, the development of steerable wire-guided torpedoes made the less-capable aft-firing torpedoes redundant; they were closed off, and later removed during a refit.

&quot;Orion&quot; was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at Greenock, Scotland on 6 October 1972, launched on 16 September 1974, and commissioned into the RAN on 15 June 1977. The submarine was due to enter service in 1975, but faulty high-power electrical cabling had been installed in &quot;Orion&quot; and sister boat ; stripping out and replacing the cabling delayed each submarine&#x27;s construction by two years. The delay meant that the two boats could be fitted with Micropuffs rangefinding sonar during construction, and have additional electronic surveillance equipment installed. &quot;Orion&quot;″s name comes from the constellation Orion: although a name with strong links to the Royal Navy (with six vessels operating as ), this was a break from the RAN&#x27;s traditional use of the names of explorers and pioneers for submarines. The submarine&#x27;s motto of &quot;Orbe Circumcincto&quot; (Latin for &quot;All around the world&quot;) refers to the visibility of the constellation from any point on Earth.

==Operational history==
&quot;Orion&quot; was the first ever Australian vessel to visit a German port. On her delivery voyage from Scotland in 1978, &quot;Orion&quot; recorded communications and any other signals emitted from Libyan Navy vessels around the ports of Tripoli, Benghazi, Darnah and Tobruk at the request of the United Kingdom and the United States.

As &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Otama&quot; were fitted with specialist intelligence gathering equipment, they were regularly deployed on surveillance and spying operations, earning them the nickname &quot;Mystery Boats&quot;. Activities were part of the broader Western nations&#x27; intelligence-gathering apparatus, and included surveillance off the coasts of China, India, Vietnam, and Indonesia, tailing of Soviet Pacific Fleet units during operations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and observation off the Soviet base at Vladivostok. These activities continued until the end of the Cold War in 1992, and most of &quot;Orion&quot;″s activities and deployments during this period remain classified. The first captain of &quot;Orion,&quot; Commander Rob Woolrych , stated that &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Otama&quot; conducted sixteen intelligence-gathering missions during their service between March 1978 to December 1992. Each mission was under the command of the Chief of the Defence Force, authorised by the Minister for Defence and conducted with the knowledge of the Prime Minister. Regular patrols were conducted for six to eight weeks. On occasion, &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Otama&quot; would dock in British naval facilities in Singapore or Hong Kong for refuelling and maintenance.

&quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Otama&quot; would remain just off the horizon—around five nautical miles from a target—at periscope depth to observe surroundings and record information during operations close to enemy waters. Batteries which powered the submarines would be recharged during the night and intelligence gathering took place during daylight hours. The submarine was equipped with passive sonar hydrophones which allowed it to record signatures from Soviet vessels, identifying the capabilities of each individual vessel.

On 27 September 1980, the officers and crew of &quot;Orion&quot; were granted the Freedom of the City of Wollongong in perpetuity. In 1987, &quot;Orion&quot; was awarded the Gloucester Cup, for being the RAN vessel demonstrating the greatest overall efficiency over the previous twelve months. &quot;Orion&quot; was the last submarine to receive the Cup until 2005, when it was presented to the submarine . Like a number of other &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarines, &quot;Orion&quot; carried out many special operation deployments during her service which qualified those crew members for the Australian Service Medal, with Special Operations clasp. Conducted between 1978 and 1992, these operations involved intelligence-gathering missions off the coasts of Vietnam, Indonesia, China and India, primarily targeting the Soviet Navy during the Cold War.

==Decommissioning and fate==

&quot;Orion&quot; paid off into reserve at Garden Island, Western Australia in 1996. She remained there for several years, until she was marked for disposal as scrap in September 2003. Efforts to hand her over to a state government for preservation as a museum ship or sinking as a dive wreck failed, and submissions for disposal companies were closed off on 6 August 2004. The submarine was sold for scrapping, and was broken up by Tenix at Henderson, Western Australia in December 2006. The fin was given to the City of Rockingham and is now mounted as a permanent memorial at Rockingham Naval Memorial Park. The port propeller was donated to the Western Australia Maritime Museum.

In November 2011, authorisation was granted to establish a new Australian Naval Cadets unit in Jindabyne, New South Wales, named New Training Ship (NTS) &quot;Orion&quot; after the submarine. In addition to the name, the cadet unit will use &quot;Orion&quot;″s badge and motto.

<text>HMAS &quot;Otama&quot; (SS 62/SSG 62) was an , formerly of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Built in Scotland, the submarine was the last of the class to enter service when commissioned into the RAN in 1978. &quot;Otama&quot; was a specialist, one of two &quot;Mystery Boats&quot;, fitted with additional surveillance and intelligence-gathering equipment. &quot;Otama&quot; was routinely deployed on classified operations to obtain intelligence on Soviet Pacific Fleet vessels and Chinese Navy vessels, and conducted associated coastal surveillance, throughout Asia.

The submarine was part of the RAN&#x27;s largest flag-showing cruise in the Indian Ocean during 1980. From 1983 to 1985, she underwent an extensive upgrade. In August 1987, two submariners died when &quot;Otama&quot; submerged while they were still working in the fin. &quot;Otama&quot; remained in service until late 2000; a delay from her original planned decommissioning date to help attenuate the problems with the replacement s.

&quot;Otama&quot; was sold to the Western Port Oberon Association in 2001, which planned to preserve her as a museum vessel as part of the proposed Victorian Maritime Centre. Submissions to build the maritime museum at various locations on the Mornington Peninsula were repeatedly rebuffed. In late 2008, the submarine was listed for sale on eBay, but despite several expressions of interest, &quot;Otama&quot; was not sold. In-principle approval to build the Victorian Maritime Centre on reclaimed land adjacent to the Western Port Marina at Hastings was granted in 2013 but planning permits were not issued 

In September 2022 &quot;Otama&quot; arrived in Western Australia for scrapping after all attempts to keep her as a museum failed.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Oberon&quot; class was based heavily on the preceding &quot;Porpoise&quot; class of submarines, with changes made to improve the vessels&#x27; hull integrity, sensor systems, and stealth capabilities. Eight submarines were ordered by the RAN, in two batches of four. The first batch was approved in 1963, and the second batch (including &quot;Otama&quot;) was approved during the late 1960s, although two of these were cancelled before construction started in 1969, with the funding redirected to the Fleet Air Arm. This was the fourth time the RAN had attempted to establish a submarine branch.

The submarine was long, with a beam of , and a draught of when surfaced. At full load displacement, she displaced 2,030 tons when surfaced, and 2,410 tons when submerged. The two propeller shafts were each driven by an English Electric motor providing and ; the electricity for these was generated by two Admiralty Standard Range supercharged V16 diesel generators. The submarine could travel at up to on the surface, and up to when submerged, had a maximum range of at , and a test depth of below sea level. When launched, the boat had a company of eight officers and 56 sailors, but by the time she decommissioned, the number of sailors had increased to 60. In addition, up to 16 trainees could be carried.

The main armament of the &quot;Oberon&quot;s consisted of six torpedo tubes. The British Mark 8 torpedo was initially carried by the submarine; this was later replaced by the wire-guided Mark 23. After a multi-year refit was completed in 1985 by Cockatoo Docks &amp; Engineering Company, &quot;Otama&quot; was upgraded to carry United States Navy Mark 48 torpedoes and UGM-84 Sub Harpoon anti-ship missiles; the last Australian &quot;Oberon&quot; to undergo the Submarine Weapon Update Program. As of 1996, the standard payload of an Australian &quot;Oberon&quot; was a mix of 20 Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and Sub Harpoon missiles. Some or all of the torpedo payload could be replaced by Mark 5 Stonefish sea mines, which were deployed through the torpedo tubes. On entering service, two stern-mounted, short-length torpedo tubes for Mark 20 anti-submarine torpedoes. However, the development of steerable wire-guided torpedoes made the less-capable aft-firing torpedoes redundant; they were closed off, and later removed during a refit.

&quot;Otama&quot; was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding &amp; Engineering Company at Greenock, Scotland on 25 May 1973, launched on 3 December 1975, and commissioned into the RAN on 27 April 1978. The submarine was due to enter service in 1976, but faulty high-power electrical cabling had been installed in &quot;Otama&quot; and sister boat ; stripping out and replacing the cabling delayed each submarine&#x27;s construction by two years. The delay meant that the two boats could be fitted with Micropuffs rangefinding sonar during construction that the earlier built boats were due to receive as an upgrade.

&quot;Otama&quot; was the sixth and final &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarine to enter service with the RAN. The boat&#x27;s name comes from a North Queensland Aboriginal word meaning dolphin; this was a break in RAN tradition, which had used the names of explorers and pioneers for previous submarines. &quot;Otama&quot; was assigned the pennant number 62. The high standard of internal fittings compared to the rest of the class led to the &quot;Gucci Boat&quot; nickname.

&quot;Otama&quot; received a special electronic surveillance fit after &quot;Orion&quot; had been fitted with this during construction.

==Operational history==
After a delivery voyage via ports in Denmark, Florida, and Mexico, &quot;Otama&quot; arrived at in Sydney on 15 December 1978.

During the Cold War, &quot;Otama&quot; and &quot;Orion&quot; regularly deployed on surveillance and spying operations using their specialist intelligence-gathering equipment, earning them the nickname &quot;Mystery Boats&quot;. These activities starting in 1978 were part of the broader Western nations&#x27; intelligence-gathering apparatus, and included surveillance off the coasts of Vietnam, China, India and Indonesia. Obtaining intelligence on Soviet and Chinese made vessels in operations in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. Observation off the Soviet base at Vladivostok. These activities continued until 1992 after an incident with &quot;Orion&quot;, and most of &quot;Otama&quot;″s activities and deployments during this period remain classified.

In April 1980, &quot;Otama&quot; and the destroyer were sent to Fiji as part of Australia&#x27;s response to Tropical Cyclone Wally. On 8 September 1980, &quot;Otama&quot; joined five other RAN vessels to form the Australia Squadron. The Squadron, which included HMA Ships , , , , and spent two months in the Indian Ocean as part of a flag-showing cruise; the largest RAN deployment since World War II.

In July 1983, &quot;Otama&quot; was docked for modernisation by the Cockatoo Docks &amp; Engineering Company. The Submarine Weapon Update Program refit lasted until 1985.
On 3 August 1987, two sailors were killed aboard &quot;Otama&quot;. At 09:00, the submarine left HMAS &quot;Platypus&quot; to test a new towed hydrophone array. Extreme weather forced the cancellation of the test, and two sailors were sent into the fin at around 10:20 to retrieve and stow the array. At 10:35, the submarine was prepared for diving, and she submerged four minutes later, with the two men still in the fin. The submariners, on noticing their vessel diving underneath them, climbed up the fin to the bridge and opened the voicepipe in an unsuccessful attempt to contact the control room before being washed overboard. Their absence was not noticed until around 11:00, despite post-dive checks and a rotation of duty stations in the interim, and was not confirmed for at least another half-hour. A search for the submariners was conducted, and one of the bodies was spotted, but could not be recovered. Estimated survival time in the prevailing conditions was only five minutes, and the submariners were not required to wear lifebelts. A naval board of inquiry recommended that action be taken against two officers, although the Navy Office did not take action, as there were multiple factors leading into the incident, and court martialing the two officers could find one or both held solely responsible for the deaths. In addition to the rejection of the board&#x27;s findings, several officers involved in the incident (including the two singled out by the inquiry), were promoted. A coronial inquiry followed (one of the first heard by the new office of the State Coroner of New South Wales), to which there was some opposition by the RAN, including advising personnel not to cooperate with the task force gathering evidence for the inquiry, and attempting to fend off a request by the coroner for a trip on the submarine replicating the events of the day. Following two separate weeks of hearings in October and November 1988, the state coroner concluded that the incident was the sum of multiple moderate-to-minor breaches of operating procedure and careless negligence (including that notices indicating personnel were outside the submarine were not posted, and key personnel were not informed) aboard a submarine operating in non-standard conditions (such as the testing of new equipment, along with observers and trainees aboard, and a high rotation of personnel between stations in a short period of time). The coroner singled out &quot;Otama&quot;″s commanding officer for allowing so many rules and procedures to be ignored under his command, but did not find sufficient cause to recommend charges against any individual. Several changes were made to casing operational procedures at sea, including making lifebelts compulsory and requiring the senior petty officer on duty to sign out and sign back in personnel working outside. The fatalities aboard &quot;Otama&quot; were two of the only three deaths aboard Australian &quot;Oberon&quot;s.

From 1996, &quot;Otama&quot; was given approval to conduct coastal surveillance operations using its specialist intelligence-gathering equipment on Indonesia in particular to obtain information on East Timor.

At the end of March 1999, &quot;Otama&quot; was reassigned to in Western Australia, where the s were operating. Within days of leaving Sydney, sister boat was paid off, leaving &quot;Otama&quot; the only one of her class in service, and the submarine base at HMAS &quot;Platypus&quot; was cleared for closure.

==Decommissioning and fate==
&quot;Otama&quot; paid off on 15 December 2000: problems with the introduction of the &quot;Collins&quot;-class submarines kept &quot;Otama&quot; and sister boat HMAS &quot;Onslow&quot; in service for several years beyond their planned decommissioning date. In the year leading up to her paying off, the pending decommissioning combined with the findings of the McIntosh-Prescott Report to cause the &quot;Fast Track&quot; program, A$1 billion of modifications to make and fit for service by the end of the year. &quot;Otama&quot; was the last Australian &quot;Oberon&quot; to leave service.

The submarine was sold in 2001 to the Western Port Oberon Association, a community group intending to preserve her as a museum vessel and building the Victorian Maritime Centre in Hastings, Victoria. The association beat 32 other tenders for the disposal of &quot;Otama&quot;, and received a $500,000 &quot;Centenary of Federation&quot; grant from the federal government to fund the purchase and relocation. The grant included the $50,000 purchase price of the submarine, plus $300,000 to tow &quot;Otama&quot; from Fremantle to Western Port Bay, with the balance to be used in bringing the boat ashore once a suitable venue was built. &quot;Otama&quot; arrived in Western Port in 2002, where she was moored while waiting for the approval and development of the museum.

By late 2008, plans for three separate locations for the Victorian Maritime Centre – Hastings, Crib Point, and Stony Point – had all been rejected by the Department of Sustainability and Environment. As the Western Port Oberon Association could no longer afford to maintain the submarine while waiting for a favourable decision, &quot;Otama&quot; was listed on eBay for sale in November 2008. Although no bids were placed by the time the online auction closed in late December, the association received several expressions of interest: including from the St Kilda Marina, Frankston City Council, and one purporting to be a tourism operator but believed by the Western Port Oberon Association to be wanting to restore the submarine for drug smuggling (which was referred to the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation). No sale was made, and the submarine remained in the possession of the association.

In early 2010, &quot;Otama&quot;″s interior was used to represent a Russian submarine for the short film &quot;Deeper Than Yesterday&quot;. The 20-minute film won awards at the 2010 Australian Film Institute Awards, the 2010 Leeds International Film Festival, and the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.

In-principle approval to build the Victorian Maritime Centre was given by Victorian environmental minister Ryan Smith in March 2013. The association submitted plans in June for a site on the seawall of the Western Port Marina at Hastings, to be built on reclaimed land. The proposed site is on the outer edge of the existing seawall, with &quot;Otama&quot; enclosed in a semi-recessed concrete pit designed to support the main internal deck at ground level, located between the seawall and the planned site of the maritime centre. As of February 2015, design work has been completed, but the association was awaiting the approval of a planning permit.
In January 2016 it was announced that new mooring cables worth $50,000 were needed if the vessel was to withstand winter storms. By May 2016 difficulties in raising the funds led to the Western Port Oberon Association looking into selling the submarine for scrap if necessary. Pledges of more than $10,000 were received by the end of May. The following month the moorings were repaired by Patrick Ports Hastings after being contracted by Parks Victoria. In June 2021, the ship listed and was in danger of capsizing.

In September 2022 the decision was made to scrap the Otama, with Parks Victoria moving to remove the vessel and scrap it, despite the previous efforts to preserve the vessel, and its heritage value. 

On 13 September 2022 the semi-submersible vessel, &quot;Rolldock Sun&quot; hired by the Department of Defence arrived in Western Port Bay to uplift &quot;Otama&quot; for transfer to Henderson, WA and breaking up. Passage to WA commenced on 19 September 2022.

<text>In zoology, mammalogy is the study of mammals – a class of vertebrates with characteristics such as homeothermic metabolism, fur, four-chambered hearts, and complex nervous systems. Mammalogy has also been known as mastology, theriology, and therology. The archive of number of mammals on earth is constantly growing, but is currently set at 6,495 different mammal species including recently extinct. There are 5,416 living mammals identified on earth and roughly 1,251 have been newly discovered since 2006. The major branches of mammalogy include natural history, taxonomy and systematics, anatomy and physiology, ethology, ecology, and management and control. The approximate salary of a mammalogist varies from $20,000 to $60,000 a year, depending on their experience. Mammalogists are typically involved in activities such as conducting research, managing personnel, and writing proposals.

Mammalogy branches off into other taxonomically oriented disciplines such as primatology (study of primates), and cetology (study of cetaceans). Like other studies, mammalogy is also a part of zoology which is also a part of biology, the study of all living things.

== Research purposes ==
Mammalogists have stated that there are multiple reasons for the study and observation of mammals. Knowing how mammals contribute or thrive in their ecosystems gives knowledge on the ecology behind it. Mammals are often used in business industries, agriculture, and kept for pets. Studying mammals habitats and source of energy has led to aiding in survival. The domestication of some small mammals has also helped discover several different diseases, viruses, and cures.

== Mammalogist ==
A mammalogist studies and observes mammals. In studying mammals, they can observe their habitats, contributions to the ecosystem, their interactions, and the anatomy and physiology. A mammalogist can do a broad variety of things within the realm of mammals. A mammalogist on average can make roughly $58,000 a year. This depends on employer and state.

== History ==
The first people recorded to have researched mammals were the ancient Greeks with records on mammals that were not even native to Greece and others that were. Aristotle was one of the first to recognize whales and dolphins as mammals since up until the 18th century most of the study was done by taxonomy.

== Journals ==

This is a list of scientific journals broadly serving mammalogists. In addition, many other more general zoology, ecology and evolution, or conservation journals also deal with mammals, and several journals are specific to only certain taxonomic groups of mammals.

<doc id="438763" wikidata="Q9284699" url="?curid=438763" title="HMAS Ovens">
<text>HMAS &quot;Ovens&quot; (S 70) is an &quot;Oberon&quot;-class submarine, formerly of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). She was one of six &quot;Oberon&quot;s built for the Royal Australian Navy by the Scottish Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, and entered service in 1969. The vessel was named for Irishman and Australian explorer John Ovens (1788–1825) and for whom the Victorian river Ovens was named. During her career, &quot;Ovens&quot; was the first RAN submarine to deploy with the ANZUK force, and the first RAN submarine to fire an armed Mark 48 torpedo, sinking the target ship . The boat was decommissioned in 1995, and is preserved at the Western Australian Maritime Museum as a museum ship.

==Design and construction==

The &quot;Oberon&quot; class was based heavily on the preceding &quot;Porpoise&quot; class of submarines, with changes made to improve the vessels&#x27; hull integrity, sensor systems, and stealth capabilities. Eight submarines were ordered for the RAN, in two batches of four. The first batch (including &quot;Ovens&quot;) was approved in 1963, and the second batch was approved during the late 1960s, although two of these were cancelled before construction started in 1969, with the funding redirected to the Fleet Air Arm. This was the fourth time the RAN had attempted to establish a submarine branch.

The submarine was long, with a beam of , and a draught of when surfaced. At full load displacement, she displaced when surfaced, and 2,410 tons when submerged. The two propeller shafts were each driven by an English Electric motor providing 3,500 brake horsepower and 4,500 shaft horsepower; the electricity for these was generated by two Admiralty Standard Range supercharged V16 diesel generators. The submarine could travel at up to on the surface, and up to when submerged, had a maximum range of at , and a test depth of below sea level. When launched, the boat had a company of 8 officers and 56 sailors, but by the time she decommissioned, the number of sailors had increased to 60. In addition, up to 16 trainees could be carried.

The main armament of the &quot;Oberon&quot;s consisted of six torpedo tubes. The British Mark 8 torpedo was initially carried by the submarine; this was later replaced by the wire-guided Mark 23. Between March 1980 and August 1982, the Australian &quot;Oberons&quot; were upgraded to carry United States Navy Mark 48 torpedoes and UGM-84 Sub Harpoon anti-ship missiles. As of 1996, the standard payload of an Australian &quot;Oberon&quot; was a mix of 20 Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and Sub Harpoon missiles. Some or all of the torpedo payload could be replaced by Mark 5 Stonefish sea mines, which were deployed through the torpedo tubes. On entering service, two stern-mounted, short-length torpedo tubes for Mark 20 anti-submarine torpedoes. However, the development of steerable wire-guided torpedoes made the less-capable aft-firing torpedoes redundant; they were closed off, and later removed during a refit.

&quot;Ovens&quot; was laid down by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company at Greenock, Scotland on 17 June 1966, launched on 4 December 1967, and commissioned into the RAN on 18 April 1969.

==Operational history==
In 1970, &quot;Ovens&quot; visited ports in New Zealand. The submarine visited New Zealand again during late August and early September 1971, and was used to train Royal New Zealand Navy vessels in anti-submarine warfare.

In January 1972, &quot;Ovens&quot; was deployed to South East Asia to serve with the ANZUK force: the first RAN submarine to do so. During the deployment, which lasted until June, the boat participated in SEATO Exercise Sea Hawk. On 3 August, the submarine encountered the launch &quot;Sea Witch&quot;, abandoned and adrift, about off Newcastle, New South Wales.

In May 1976, the submarine was sent to the Far East on a five-and-a-half-month deployment. Before returning to home port, &quot;Ovens&quot; participated in the Kangaroo 2 multinational exercise, which simulated an attack on a coastal area. Assigned to the Orange (defending) force, &quot;Ovens&quot; was able to claim successful &#x27;attacks&#x27; on of shipping, including the aircraft carrier . Returning to after the exercise, the submarine sailed into Sydney Harbour claiming a &quot;clean sweep&quot; by lashing a broom to the attack periscope.

&quot;Ovens&quot; became the first RAN submarine to fire an armed Mark 48 torpedo, when she sank the decommissioned on 4 March 1987. On her return to port, &quot;Ovens&quot; flew a &#x27;Jolly Roger&#x27; to indicate a successful mission: the first time a RAN submarine had done so.

The submarine made a port visit to Geelong, Victoria in June 1995.

==Decommissioning and fate==

&quot;Ovens&quot; paid off on 1 December 1995. The submarine was gifted to the Western Australian Museum in November 1998. She is preserved as a museum ship at the Western Australian Maritime Museum in Fremantle, Western Australia.

<text>A raised beach, coastal terrace, or perched coastline is a relatively flat, horizontal or gently inclined surface of marine origin, mostly an old abrasion platform which has been lifted out of the sphere of wave activity (sometimes called &quot;tread&quot;). Thus, it lies above or under the current sea level, depending on the time of its formation. It is bounded by a steeper ascending slope on the landward side and a steeper descending slope on the seaward side (sometimes called &quot;riser&quot;). Due to its generally flat shape, it is often used for anthropogenic structures such as settlements and infrastructure.

A raised beach is an emergent coastal landform. Raised beaches and marine terraces are beaches or wave-cut platforms raised above the shoreline by a relative fall in the sea level.
Around the world, a combination of tectonic coastal uplift and Quaternary sea-level fluctuations has resulted in the formation of marine terrace sequences, most of which were formed during separate interglacial highstands that can be correlated to marine isotope stages (MIS).

A marine terrace commonly retains a shoreline angle or inner edge, the slope inflection between the marine abrasion platform and the associated paleo sea-cliff. The shoreline angle represents the maximum shoreline of a transgression and therefore a paleo-sea level.

== Morphology ==

The platform of a marine terrace usually has a gradient between 1°5° depending on the former tidal range with, commonly, a linear to concave profile. The width is quite variable, reaching up to , and seems to differ between the northern and southern hemispheres. The cliff faces that delimit the platform can vary in steepness depending on the relative roles of marine and subaerial processes. At the intersection of the former shore (wave-cut/abrasion-) platform and the rising cliff face the platform commonly retains a shoreline angle or inner edge (notch) that indicates the location of the shoreline at the time of maximum sea ingression and therefore a paleo-sea level. Sub-horizontal platforms usually terminate in a low tide cliff, and it is believed that the occurrence of these platforms depends on tidal activity. Marine terraces can extend for several tens of kilometers parallel to the coast.

Older terraces are covered by marine and/or alluvial or colluvial materials while the uppermost terrace levels usually are less well preserved. While marine terraces in areas of relatively rapid uplift rates (&gt; 1 mm/year) can often be correlated to individual interglacial periods or stages, those in areas of slower uplift rates may have a polycyclic origin with stages of returning sea levels following periods of exposure to weathering.

Marine terraces can be covered by a wide variety of soils with complex histories and different ages. In protected areas, allochthonous sandy parent materials from tsunami deposits may be found. Common soil types found on marine terraces include planosols and solonetz.

== Formation ==

It is now widely thought that marine terraces are formed during the separated highstands of interglacial stages correlated to marine isotope stages (MIS).

=== Causes ===

The formation of marine terraces is controlled by changes in environmental conditions and by tectonic activity during recent geological times. Changes in climatic conditions have led to eustatic sea-level oscillations and isostatic movements of the Earth&#x27;s crust, especially with the changes between glacial and interglacial periods.

Processes of eustasy lead to glacioeustatic sea level fluctuations due to changes of the water volume in the oceans, and hence to regressions and transgressions of the shoreline. At times of maximum glacial extent during the last glacial period, the sea level was about lower compared to today. Eustatic sea level changes can also be caused by changes in the void volume of the oceans, either through sedimento-eustasy or tectono-eustasy.

Processes of isostasy involve the uplift of continental crusts along with their shorelines. Today, the process of glacial isostatic adjustment mainly applies to Pleistocene glaciated areas. In Scandinavia, for instance, the present rate of uplift reaches up to /year.

In general, eustatic marine terraces were formed during separate sea level highstands of interglacial stages and can be correlated to marine oxygen isotopic stages (MIS). Glacioisostatic marine terraces were mainly created during stillstands of the isostatic uplift. When eustasy was the main factor for the formation of marine terraces, derived sea level fluctuations can indicate former climate changes. This conclusion has to be treated with care, as isostatic adjustments and tectonic activities can be extensively overcompensated by a eustatic sea level rise. Thus, in areas of both eustatic and isostatic or tectonic influences, the course of the relative sea level curve can be complicated. Hence, most of today&#x27;s marine terrace sequences were formed by a combination of tectonic coastal uplift and Quaternary sea level fluctuations.

Jerky tectonic uplifts can also lead to marked terrace steps while smooth relative sea level changes may not result in obvious terraces, and their formations are often not referred to as marine terraces.

=== Processes ===

Marine terraces often result from marine erosion along rocky coastlines in temperate regions due to wave attack and sediment carried in the waves. Erosion also takes place in connection with weathering and cavitation. The speed of erosion is highly dependent on the shoreline material (hardness of rock), the bathymetry, and the bedrock properties and can be between only a few millimeters per year for granitic rocks and more than per year for volcanic ejecta. The retreat of the sea cliff generates a shore (wave-cut/abrasion-) platform through the process of abrasion. A relative change of the sea level leads to regressions or transgressions and eventually forms another terrace (marine-cut terrace) at a different altitude, while notches in the cliff face indicate short stillstands.

It is believed that the terrace gradient increases with tidal range and decreases with rock resistance. In addition, the relationship between terrace width and the strength of the rock is inverse, and higher rates of uplift and subsidence as well as a higher slope of the hinterland increases the number of terraces formed during a certain time.

Furthermore, shore platforms are formed by denudation and marine-built terraces arise from accumulations of materials removed by shore erosion. Thus, a marine terrace can be formed by both erosion and accumulation. However, there is an ongoing debate about the roles of wave erosion and weathering in the formation of shore platforms.

Reef flats or uplifted coral reefs are another kind of marine terrace found in intertropical regions. They are a result of biological activity, shoreline advance and accumulation of reef materials.

While a terrace sequence can date back hundreds of thousands of years, its degradation is a rather fast process. A deeper transgression of cliffs into the shoreline may completely destroy previous terraces; but older terraces might be decayed or covered by deposits, colluvia or alluvial fans. Erosion and backwearing of slopes caused by incisive streams play another important role in this degradation process.

=== Land and sea level history ===
The total displacement of the shoreline relative to the age of the associated interglacial stage allows calculation of a mean uplift rate or the calculation of eustatic level at a particular time if the uplift is known.

In order to estimate vertical uplift, the eustatic position of the considered paleo sea levels relative to the present one must be known as precisely as possible. Current chronology relies principally on relative dating based on geomorphologic criteria, but in all cases the shoreline angle of the marine terraces is associated with numerical ages. The best-represented terrace worldwide is the one correlated to the last interglacial maximum (MIS 5e). Age of MISS 5e is arbitrarily fixed to range from 130 to 116 ka but is demonstrated to range from 134 to 113 ka in Hawaii and Barbados with a peak from 128 to 116 ka on tectonically stable coastlines. Older marine terraces well represented in worldwide sequences are those related to MIS 9 (~303–339 ka) and 11 (~362–423 ka). Compilations show that sea level was 3 ± 3 meters higher during MIS 5e, MIS 9 and 11 than during the present one and −1 ± 1 m to the present one during MIS 7. Consequently, MIS 7 (~180-240 ka) marine terraces are less pronounced and sometimes absent. When the elevations of these terraces are higher than the uncertainties in paleo-eustatic sea level mentioned for the Holocene and Late Pleistocene, these uncertainties have no effect on overall interpretation.

Sequence can also occur where the accumulation of ice sheets have depressed the land so that when the ice sheets melts the land readjusts with time thus raising the height of the beaches (glacio-isostatic rebound) and in places where co-seismic uplift occur. In the latter case, the terrace are not correlated with sea level highstand even if co-seismic terrace are known only for the Holocene.

== Mapping and surveying ==

For exact interpretations of the morphology, extensive datings, surveying and mapping of marine terraces is applied. This includes stereoscopic aerial photographic interpretation (ca. 1 : 10,000 – 25,000), on-site inspections with topographic maps (ca. 1 : 10,000) and analysis of eroded and accumulated material. Moreover, the exact altitude can be determined with an aneroid barometer or preferably with a levelling instrument mounted on a tripod. It should be measured with the accuracy of and at about every , depending on the topography. In remote areas, the techniques of photogrammetry and tacheometry can be applied.

== Correlation and dating ==

Different methods for dating and correlation of marine terraces can be used and combined.

=== Correlational dating ===

The morphostratigraphic approach focuses especially in regions of marine regression on the altitude as the most important criterion to distinguish coastlines of different ages. Moreover, individual marine terraces can be correlated based on their size and continuity. Also, paleo-soils as well as glacial, fluvial, eolian and periglacial landforms and sediments may be used to find correlations between terraces. On New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, for instance, tephra and loess were used to date and correlate marine terraces. At the terminus advance of former glaciers marine terraces can be correlated by their size, as their width decreases with age due to the slowly thawing glaciers along the coastline.

The lithostratigraphic approach uses typical sequences of sediment and rock strata to prove sea level fluctuations on the basis of an alternation of terrestrial and marine sediments or littoral and shallow marine sediments. Those strata show typical layers of transgressive and regressive patterns. However, an unconformity in the sediment sequence might make this analysis difficult.

The biostratigraphic approach uses remains of organisms which can indicate the age of a marine terrace. For that, often mollusc shells, foraminifera or pollen are used. Especially Mollusca can show specific properties depending on their depth of sedimentation. Thus, they can be used to estimate former water depths.

Marine terraces are often correlated to marine oxygen isotopic stages (MIS) and can also be roughly dated using their stratigraphic position.

=== Direct dating ===

There are various methods for the direct dating of marine terraces and their related materials. The most common method is 14C radiocarbon dating, which has been used, for example, on the North Island of New Zealand to date several marine terraces. It utilizes terrestrial biogenic materials in coastal sediments, such as mollusc shells, by analyzing the 14C isotope. In some cases, however, dating based on the 230Th/234U ratio was applied, in case detrital contamination or low uranium concentrations made finding a high resolution dating difficult. In a study in southern Italy paleomagnetism was used to carry out paleomagnetic datings and luminescence dating (OSL) was used in different studies on the San Andreas Fault and on the Quaternary Eupcheon Fault in South Korea. In the last decade, the dating of marine terraces has been enhanced since the arrival of terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides method, and particularly through the use of 10Be and 26Al cosmogenic isotopes produced on site. These isotopes record the duration of surface exposure to cosmic rays. This exposure age reflects the age of abandonment of a marine terrace by the sea.

In order to calculate the eustatic sea level for each dated terrace, it is assumed that the eustatic sea-level position corresponding to at least one marine terrace is known and that the uplift rate has remained essentially constant in each section.

== Relevance for other research areas ==
Marine terraces play an important role in the research on tectonics and earthquakes. They may show patterns and rates of tectonic uplift and thus may be used to estimate the tectonic activity in a certain region. In some cases the exposed secondary landforms can be correlated with known seismic events such as the 1855 Wairarapa earthquake on the Wairarapa Fault near Wellington, New Zealand which produced a uplift. This figure can be estimated from the vertical offset between raised shorelines in the area.

Furthermore, with the knowledge of eustatic sea level fluctuations, the speed of isostatic uplift can be estimated and eventually the change of relative sea levels for certain regions can be reconstructed. Thus, marine terraces also provide information for the research on climate change and trends in future sea level changes.

When analyzing the morphology of marine terraces, it must be considered, that both eustasy and isostasy can have an influence on the formation process. This way can be assessed, whether there were changes in sea level or whether tectonic activities took place.

== Prominent examples ==

Raised beaches are found in a wide variety of coast and geodynamical background such as subduction on the Pacific coasts of South and North America, passive margin of the Atlantic coast of South America, collision context on the Pacific coast of Kamchatka, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Japan, passive margin of the South China Sea coast, on west-facing Atlantic coasts, such as Donegal Bay, County Cork and County Kerry in Ireland; Bude, Widemouth Bay, Crackington Haven, Tintagel, Perranporth and St Ives in Cornwall, the Vale of Glamorgan, Gower Peninsula, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay in Wales, Jura and the Isle of Arran in Scotland, Finistère in Brittany and Galicia in Northern Spain and at Squally Point in Eatonville, Nova Scotia within the Cape Chignecto Provincial Park.

Other important sites include various coasts of New Zealand, e.g. Turakirae Head near Wellington being one of the world&#x27;s best and most thoroughly studied examples. Also along the Cook Strait in New Zealand, there is a well-defined sequence of uplifted marine terraces from the late Quaternary at Tongue Point. It features a well preserved lower terrace from the last interglacial, a widely eroded higher terrace from the penultimate interglacial and another still higher terrace, which is nearly completely decayed. Furthermore, on New Zealand&#x27;s North Island at the eastern Bay of Plenty, a sequence of seven marine terraces has been studied.

Along many coasts of mainland and islands around the Pacific, marine terraces are typical coastal features. An especially prominent marine terraced coastline can be found north of Santa Cruz, near Davenport, California, where terraces probably have been raised by repeated slip earthquakes on the San Andreas Fault. Hans Jenny famously researched the pygmy forests of the Mendocino and Sonoma county marine terraces. The marine terrace&#x27;s &quot;ecological staircase&quot; of Salt Point State Park is also bound by the San Andreas Fault.

Along the coasts of South America marine terraces are present, where the highest ones are situated where plate margins lie above subducted oceanic ridges and the highest and most rapid rates of uplift occur. At Cape Laundi, Sumba Island, Indonesia an ancient patch reef can be found at above sea level as part of a sequence of coral reef terraces with eleven terraces being wider than . The coral marine terraces at Huon Peninsula, New Guinea, which extend over and rise over above present sea level are currently on UNESCO&#x27;s tentative list for world heritage sites under the name &quot;Houn Terraces - Stairway to the Past.&quot;

Other considerable examples include marine terraces rising up to on some Philippine Islands and along the Mediterranean Coast of North Africa, especially in Tunisia, rising up to .

== Related coastal geography ==

Uplift can also be registered through tidal notch sequences. Notches are often portrayed as lying at sea level; however notch types actually form a continuum from wave notches formed in quiet conditions at sea level to surf notches formed in more turbulent conditions and as much as above sea level. As stated above, there was at least one higher sea level during the Holocene, so that some notches may not contain a tectonic component in their formation.

<text>Jacob Leonard Replogle (May 6, 1876 – November 25, 1948), usually known as J. L. Replogle, was a wealthy American industrialist.

==Biography==
J. Leonard Replogle was born in New Enterprise, Pennsylvania on May 6, 1876, one of twelve children of Rinehart Zook and Mary Ann (&quot;née&quot; Furry) Replogle. Rinehart was a Brethren minister, and moved his family away from New Enterprise to live in Johnstown. It was in Johnstown that Jacob grew up and went to school. Jacob quit his schooling when he was 13 years old, shortly after the Johnstown Flood, and went to work as a $5-per-week office boy in the general offices of the Cambria Steel Company.

He went on to become a general supervisor at Cambria, rising through the ranks to finally become the head of Replogle Steel Co. In 1918, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine named him one of the wealthiest persons in the United States.

He married Blanche Kenley McMillen on January 10, 1905.

During World War I, he directed the steel supply for the War Industries Board, organizing the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Chester with William Sproul, Samuel Vauclain of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, T. Coleman du Pont, and Edward V. Babcock of Pittsburgh. After the war, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army). He did similar work for the War Production Board in World War II.

He was also head of the Vanadium Corporation of America, with Charles M. Schwab. In August 1942, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers established the Manhattan Engineer District (MED), also known as the Manhattan Project, to develop atomic weapons and to procure the raw materials, principally uranium, necessary for their production. The MED contracted the Vanadium Corporation of America and the United States Vanadium Corporation (owned by Union Carbide) to procure and process uranium bearing ore.

While in Paris in 1931 he and a friend, Paulding Fosdick, invented a form of the game bridge, which they called Towie. In 1935, he sought to make Towie a popular game in the United States, with limited success.

The J. Leonard Replogle Elementary School in Loysburg, Pennsylvania is named after him.

In his later years he entered into Republican politics. He was Presidential Elector for Pennsylvania, 1920; a delegate to Republican National Convention from Florida, 1932, 1936, 1940, and 1944; and a member of Republican National Committee from Florida, 1940.

J. Leonard Replogle died at the Savoy-Plaza Hotel in New York on November 25, 1948. He was buried in Grandview Cemetery, Johnstown.

<text>Richard M. Romley (born April 28, 1949) is an American lawyer and politician. As a Republican, he served as the County Attorney for Maricopa County, Arizona from 1989 to 2004 and again in 2010.

==Early life==
A veteran of the Vietnam War, serving in the United States Marine Corps, he received numerous commendations for his service in that war, including the Purple Heart medal. He was severely wounded by a land mine, losing both legs above the knee and suffering other injuries. Following the war, Romley went to Arizona State University in Tempe as a business management student, and graduated in 1974. He later attended ASU&#x27;s law school and attained his Juris Doctor degree in 1981.

==Career highlights==
Romley was elected Maricopa County attorney in 1989. One of his highest publicized cases was his prosecution of the &quot;AzScam&quot; scandal of the early 1990s. In 2002, he initiated an investigation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Phoenix and its part in the Catholic sex abuse cases, that led to an admission of wrongdoing by the then-Bishop Thomas O&#x27;Brien.
Romley also prosecuted Ray Krone for the murder of Kim Ancona. Krone, who had no prior criminal record, was convicted and sentenced to death. After spending ten years in prison, four on Death Row, Krone was freed after DNA conclusively proved that he was innocent. Romley defended his prosecution of Ray Krone by saying there was &quot;strong circumstantial evidence&quot; of his guilt. In response to the conclusive proof that an innocent Ray Krone spent years in prison, four of which was spent on Arizona&#x27;s death row, Prosecutor Romley said, &quot;we will try to do better.&quot; He neglected to mention that the prosecution&#x27;s concealment of the odontologist&#x27;s report that cast doubt on Ray&#x27;s guilt prior to his first trial indicates they may have knowingly prosecuted an innocent man. 
(See: &quot;Twice Wrongly Convicted of Murder - Ray Krone Is Set Free After 10 Years&quot; by Hans Sherrer, &quot;Justice Denied Magazine&quot;, Vol. 2, Issue 9.)

In 2001, he received the Disabled American Veterans&#x27; (DAV) Outstanding Disabled Veteran of the Year Award.

After leaving the county attorney&#x27;s post, Romley served as a special advisor to the Arizona Attorney General for six months. In August 2007, he became a personal advisor to James Nicholson, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in Washington, D.C.
In April 2010 the Board of Supervisors appointed him as Interim Maricopa County Attorney when Andrew Thomas resigned amid ethics investigations from that position to run for the office of Attorney General of Arizona, making Romley only the third interim ever since 1912, following Donald Harris in 1976 and Phil MacDonnell (Andrew Thomas&#x27; Chief Deputy) in 2010.

Romley&#x27;s success as the interim county attorney came to an end on August 24, 2010, when Bill Montgomery beat Romley in the Republican primary. Rick Romley ended his appointed term on November 3, 2010.

<text>Marquess of Londonderry, of the County of Londonderry ( ), is a title in the Peerage of Ireland.

==History==
The title was created in 1816 for Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Londonderry. He had earlier represented County Down in the Irish House of Commons. Stewart had already been created Baron Londonderry in 1789, Viscount Castlereagh, of Castlereagh in the County of Down, in 1795 and Earl of Londonderry, of the County of Londonderry, in 1796. These titles are also in the Peerage of Ireland.

He was the son of Alexander Stewart, who had married Mary Cowan, sister and heiress of Robert Cowan, who gained great wealth as Governor of Bombay from 1729 to 1737. Alexander was from Ballylawn, a townland at the south-west corner of Inishowen in the north of County Donegal, a county located in the west of Ulster in the northern part of Ireland. However, much of the Stewart family&#x27;s wealth was based on the estates which came into the family through this marriage.

The 1st Marquess was one of the few people to become a Marquess without inheriting any titles prior to the creation. He sat in the British House of Lords as one of the twenty-eight original Irish representative peer from 1800 to 1821. He was succeeded by his son from his first marriage to Lady Sarah Seymour. The 2nd Marquess, better known as Lord Castlereagh (he went by the courtesy title of Viscount Castlereagh from 1796 to 1821), was a noted statesman and diplomat. Castlereagh is best remembered for his tenure as Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom from 1812 to 1822 and played an important role at the Congress of Vienna of 1814 to 1815. He committed suicide in 1822, one year after succeeding his father in the marquessate. The 2nd Marquess did not follow his father as a Representative Peer into the House of Lords, this permitted him to continue fulfilling his roles in the House of Commons.

Castlereagh was succeeded by his half-brother, the 3rd Marquess. He was the only son from the 1st Marquess&#x27;s second marriage to Lady Frances Pratt, daughter of Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden. He was a General in the Army and like his elder half-brother a prominent politician and diplomat. Lord Londonderry served as Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies from 1807 to 1809, fought in the Napoleonic Wars and was Ambassador to Austria from 1814 to 1823. In 1814 he was created Baron Stewart, of Stewart&#x27;s Court and Ballylawn in County Donegal, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1819 Londonderry married as his second wife Frances Anne Vane-Tempest (died 1865), daughter and wealthy heiress of Sir Henry Vane-Tempest, 2nd Baronet, through which marriage substantial estates in County Durham came into the Stewart family. He assumed the additional surname of Vane on his marriage and in 1823 he was created Viscount Seaham, of Seaham in the County Palatine of Durham, and Earl Vane, with remainder to the male issue of his second marriage. These titles are in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

Lord Londonderry was succeeded in the viscountcy of Seaham and earldom of Vane according to the special remainder by his eldest son from his second marriage while he was succeeded in the Irish titles and the barony of Stewart by his son from his first marriage to Lady Catherine Bligh, the 4th Marquess. He died childless in 1872 and was succeeded by his half-brother, the 5th Marquess, who had already succeeded his father as second Earl Vane in 1854. He represented Durham North in the House of Commons and served as Lord-Lieutenant of County Durham. In 1851 the 5th Marquess assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Tempest. On his death, the titles passed to his eldest son, the 6th Marquess. He was a Conservative politician and held office in the administrations of Lord Salisbury and Arthur Balfour as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, as Postmaster General, as President of the Board of Education, as Lord Privy Seal and as Lord President of the Council. In 1885 he assumed by Royal licence the additional and principal surname of Stewart.

He was succeeded by his son, the 7th Marquess, who was also a Conservative politician. He had a career in both Irish and British politics but is best known for his role as Secretary of State for Air from 1931 to 1935. Lord Londonderry subsequently gained notoriety for his informal diplomatic contacts with senior members of the German government. He made six visits to Nazi Germany between January 1936 and September 1938 meeting Adolf Hitler on a number of occasions and sympathising with some of his viewpoints. His wife Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry, was an influential society hostess remembered for her close friendship with Ramsay MacDonald. Lord Londonderry was succeeded by his son, the 8th Marquess. He represented County Down in the House of Commons as a Conservative from 1931 to 1945.

The heir apparent to the marquessate is styled &quot;Viscount Castlereagh&quot;, although the Marquess is also the Earl Vane, and the heir apparent&#x27;s heir apparent, when such exists, is styled &quot;Lord Stewart&quot;.

Between 1823 and 1854 and between 1872 and 1999, the Marquesses of Londonderry sat in the House of Lords as &quot;The Earl Vane&quot;. Between 1822 and 1823 and between 1854 and 1872, they sat as &quot;The Lord Stewart&quot;.

==Residences==
The principal family seats were Mount Stewart, near Newtownards, County Down, Northern Ireland, and the Wynyard Park estate in County Durham. Other properties included Seaham Hall in County Durham, as well as Londonderry House on Park Lane in London (where the Londonderry Hotel was later located), and Plas Machynlleth in mid-Wales.

*Robert Stewart, 2nd Marquess of Londonderry (1769–1822)

*Frederick Aubrey Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 10th Marquess of Londonderry (born 1972)

The 4th Marquess did not inherit the Seaham viscountcy and Vane earldom as he was not the heir male of the 3rd Marquess&#x27;s second wife, a limitation of the remainder of those peerages. 
==Present peer==
Frederick Aubrey Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 10th Marquess of Londonderry (born 6 September 1972), is the son of the 9th Marquess and his wife, Doreen Patricia Wells, who was a ballerina with the Royal Ballet between 1955 and 1974. He was styled as Viscount Castlereagh from birth and later as 
Earl Vane. 

On 20 June 2012, Earl Vane succeeded his father as Marquess of Londonderry (I., 1816), Earl of Londonderry (I., 1796), Earl Vane (U.K., 1823), Viscount Castlereagh (I., 1795), Viscount Seaham of Seaham (U.K., 1823), Baron Stewart of Stewart&#x27;s Court and Ballylawn (U.K., 1814), and Baron Londonderry (I., 1789).

The heir presumptive is Londonderry&#x27;s brother, Lord Reginald Alexander Vane-Tempest-Stewart (born 1977), whose heir apparent is his son Robin Gabriel Vane-Tempest-Stewart (born 2004).

<text>Marquess Conyngham, of the County of Donegal, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1816 for Henry Conyngham, 1st Earl Conyngham. He was the great-nephew of another Henry Conyngham, 1st Earl Conyngham, a member of a family of Scottish descent which had settled during the Plantation of Ulster in County Donegal in Ireland in the early 17th century. The &#x27;founder&#x27; of the dynasty in Ireland was The Very Rev. Dr. Alexander Cunningham, Dean of Raphoe. The earlier Henry was a member of both the Irish House of Commons and the British House of Commons and served as Vice-Admiral of Ulster and as Governor of the counties of Donegal and Londonderry. In 1753 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Conyngham, of Mount Charles in the County of Donegal, and in 1756 he was created Viscount Conyngham, in Ireland, also in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1781 he was made Baron Conyngham, of Mount Charles in the County of Donegal, with remainder to his nephew Francis Burton, and Earl Conyngham, of Mount Charles in the County of Donegal, which like the creations of 1753 and 1756 was created with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. The latter titles were also in the Peerage of Ireland. Lord Conyngham was childless and on his death in 1781 the barony of 1753, the viscountcy and earldom became extinct while he was succeeded in the barony of 1781 according to the special remainder by his aforementioned nephew Francis. He was the eldest son of Mary, sister of the first Earl Conyngham, by her husband Francis Burton. The new 2nd Baron Conyngham, who had earlier represented Killybegs and County Clare in the Irish House of Commons, assumed by Royal licence the surname and arms of Conyngham on succeeding to the titles.

The 2nd Baron Conyngham was succeeded by his eldest twin son, Henry, the third Baron. He was a General in the British Army, one of the original 28 Irish representative peer, Governor of both County Donegal and County Clare and Lord Steward of the Household. He was created Viscount Conyngham, of Mount Charles in the County of Donegal, in 1789, Viscount Mount Charles and Earl Conyngham in 1797, and Viscount Slane, in the County of Meath, Earl of Mount Charles and Marquess Conyngham, of the County of Donegal, in 1816. All these titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1821 he was also made Baron Minster, of Minster Abbey in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, Francis, the second Marquess. Like his father he was a General in the Army and also held government office as Postmaster General and as Lord Steward of the Household. His eldest son, George, the third Marquess, was a Lieutenant-General in the British Army. When he died the titles passed to his eldest son Henry, the fourth Marquess. He was Vice-Admiral of Ulster. Two of his sons, Victor, the fifth Marquess (who was aide-de-camp to Lieutenant General Sir John Grenfell Maxwell during World War I, and who died on 9 November 1918 in York), and Frederick, the sixth Marquess, both succeeded in the titles. Frederick&#x27;s son, Frederick, succeeded him in 1974 as seventh Marquess, followed by his son Henry, the eighth Marquess, in 2009.

Several other members of the Conyngham and Burton families may also be mentioned. Henry Conyngham (died 1706), father of the first Earl Conyngham (of the 1718 creation), was a Major-General in the British Army and was killed in the War of the Spanish Succession. Francis Burton (died 1743), father of the second Baron Conyngham, was a Member of the Irish Parliament for Coleraine and County Clare. William Conyngham (who assumed the surname of Conyngham in lieu of Burton in 1781), younger son of Francis Burton and younger brother of the second Baron Conyngham, was a Member of the Irish Parliament and served as a Teller of the Exchequer. The Honourable Sir Francis Burton, second son of the second Baron, was a colonial administrator and Member of Parliament for County Clare. Elizabeth Conyngham, Marchioness Conyngham, wife of the first Marquess, was a mistress of King George IV. Henry Francis Conyngham, Earl of Mount Charles, eldest son of the first Marquess, represented County Donegal in the House of Commons but predeceased his father, unmarried. Lord Albert Denison Conyngham, third son of the first Marquess, assumed the surname of Denison in lieu of Conyngham in 1849 on succeeding to the vast fortune of his maternal uncle William Joseph Denison, and was raised to the peerage as Baron Londesborough the following year (see this title for more information on this branch of the family). Lady Jane Conyngham, second daughter of the first Marquess, was a Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Victoria. Lord Francis Conyngham, second son of the second Marquess, was Member of Parliament for County Clare.

The family seat is Slane Castle in County Meath. A former family seat was The Hall in the village of Mountcharles, near Donegal Town in the south of County Donegal. The family surname is pronounced &quot;&quot;Cunn&quot;ingum&quot;.

<text>Marquess of Ailesbury (later styled Aylesbury), in the County of Buckingham, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 17 July 1821 for Charles Brudenell-Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury.

On 18 March 1664, Robert Bruce, 2nd Earl of Elgin in the Peerage of Scotland was created Baron Bruce, of Skelton in the County of York, Viscount Bruce, of Ampthill in the County of Bedford, and Earl of Ailesbury, in the County of Buckingham, all in the Peerage of England. His grandson, Charles, the 3rd Earl of Ailesbury (and 4th Earl of Elgin), was created Baron Bruce, of Tottenham in the County of Wilts, on 17 April 1746, in the Peerage of Great Britain, with a special remainder to his nephew, the Honourable Thomas Brudenell, fourth and youngest son of George Brudenell, 3rd Earl of Cardigan, by Lady Elizabeth Bruce, sister of the 3rd Earl of Ailesbury. On Lord Ailesbury&#x27;s death in 1747, his English titles became extinct, except for the 1746 Barony of Bruce, which was inherited by his nephew, Robert, according to the special remainder. His Scottish titles passed to his kinsman, Charles Bruce, 5th Earl of Elgin.

Thomas Brudenell, 2nd Baron Bruce, assumed the additional surname of Bruce by Royal licence in 1767. On 10 June 1776 he was created Earl of Ailesbury, in the County of Buckingham, in the Peerage of Great Britain, a revival of the title which had become extinct on his uncle&#x27;s death 29 years earlier. His son, Charles Brudenell-Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury was created Viscount Savernake, of Savernake Forest in the County of Wilts, Earl Bruce, of Whorlton in the County of York, and Marquess of Ailesbury, in the County of Buckingham, on 17 July 1821, all in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1838 his eldest son, George Brudenell-Bruce, 2nd Marquess of Ailesbury, was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Bruce. In 1868 the 2nd Marquess also inherited the Earldom of Cardigan from his kinsman the 7th Earl of Cardigan, and so the Marquesses of Ailesbury now also hold the titles Earl of Cardigan (1661) and Baron Brudenell, of Stonton in the County of Leicester (1628), in the Peerage of England, as well as being Baronets of England, styled &quot;of Deene in the County of Northampton&quot;.

The 2nd Marquess was succeeded by his younger brother, Ernest Brudenell-Bruce, 3rd Marquess of Ailesbury, who had previously sat in the House of Commons for 46 years under the name of Lord Ernest Bruce. The 3rd Marquess was succeeded by his grandson, George Brudenell-Bruce, 4th Marquess of Ailesbury, the only son of George John Brudenell-Bruce. The 4th Marquess died bankrupt at an early age and was succeeded by his uncle, Henry Brudenell-Bruce, 5th Marquess of Ailesbury, who had previously represented Chippenham in Parliament under the name of Lord Henry Bruce. As of 2024, the titles are held by the 5th Marquess&#x27;s great-great-grandson, David Brudenell-Bruce, 9th Marquess of Ailesbury, the titles having descended from father to son.

The heir apparent to the Marquessate bears the courtesy title Earl of Cardigan, and his heir apparent bears the title Viscount Savernake. Between 1776 and 1821 the heir apparent to the earldom of Ailesbury bore the courtesy title Lord Bruce. Between 1821 and 1868 the heir apparent to the marquessate bore the courtesy title Earl Bruce while Earl Bruce&#x27;s heir apparent bore the title Viscount Savernake.

Ever since Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury succeeded his father in 1685, every Earl and Marquess of Ailesbury has also been a Hereditary Warden of Savernake Forest. This explains the usage of the title Viscount Savernake within the family. Although not an earl until 1685, Thomas Bruce had already inherited the Wardenship through his marriage to Lady Elizabeth Seymour in 1676, as the Wardenship had previously been in the Seymour family. The current Lord Ailesbury is the 31st such Warden, who became Warden in 1987 when his father retired from the role.

Lord Charles Bruce, youngest son of the 1st Marquess, was a Liberal politician. A descendant of the 3rd Marquess is the model Florence Brudenell-Bruce.

The family seat was Tottenham House, near Marlborough, Wiltshire. The family last lived in the house in 1945, after which it became a school, and was sold in 2015. The Estate is held in a trust, controlled by the family. In 2013, the heir to the marquessate, Earl of Cardigan, filed a lawsuit against the trustees, alleging mismanagement. As a result, the two Trustees were ordered to stand down.

==Coat of arms==

The heraldic blazon for the coat of arms of the marquessate is: &quot;Quarterly: 1st and 4th, or a saltire and chief gules on a canton argent a lion rampant azure (for Bruce); 2nd and 3rd, argent a chevron gules between three chapeaux to the sinister azure (for Brudenell)&quot;. This can be translated as: a shield divided into quarters, the top left and bottom right quarters being gold, with a red saltire over the gold field, and the top part of the shield also being red. In addition, there is a white square in the top left corner of the shield with a blue lion rampant (for the Bruce family); the top right and bottom left quarters are white with a red chevron between three blue caps of state that are turned to face to the viewer&#x27;s right (for the Brudenell family).

<text>OpenSSL is a software library for applications that provide secure communications over computer networks against eavesdropping, and identify the party at the other end. It is widely used by Internet servers, including the majority of HTTPS websites.

OpenSSL contains an open-source implementation of the SSL and TLS protocols. The core library, written in the C programming language, implements basic cryptographic functions and provides various utility functions. Wrappers allowing the use of the OpenSSL library in a variety of computer languages are available.

The OpenSSL Software Foundation (OSF) represents the OpenSSL project in most legal capacities including contributor license agreements, managing donations, and so on. OpenSSL Software Services (OSS) also represents the OpenSSL project for support contracts.

OpenSSL is available for most Unix-like operating systems (including Linux, macOS, and BSD), Microsoft Windows and OpenVMS.

== Project history ==

The OpenSSL project was founded in 1998 to provide a free set of encryption tools for the code used on the Internet. It is based on a fork of SSLeay by Eric Andrew Young and Tim Hudson, which unofficially ended development on December 17, 1998, when Young and Hudson both went to work for RSA Security. The initial founding members were Mark Cox, Ralf Engelschall, Stephen Henson, Ben Laurie, and Paul Sutton.

In 2018 OpenSSL version numbering skipped from 1.1.1 to 3.0.0, omitting 2 as a major version number to avoid a conflict with one of OpenSSL&#x27;s modules. Version 3.0.0 was the first to use the Apache License.

, the OpenSSL management committee consisted of seven people and there are seventeen developers with commit access (many of whom are also part of the OpenSSL management committee). There are only two full-time employees (fellows) and the remainder are volunteers.

The project has a budget of less than $1 million USD per year and relies primarily on donations. Development of TLS 1.3 was sponsored by Akamai.

== Major version releases ==


== Algorithms ==

OpenSSL supports a number of different cryptographic algorithms:
; Ciphers:
: AES, Blowfish, Camellia, ChaCha20, Poly1305, SEED, CAST-128, DES, IDEA, RC2, RC4, RC5, Triple DES, GOST 28147-89, SM4
; Cryptographic hash functions:
: MD5, MD4, MD2, SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, RIPEMD-160, MDC-2, GOST R 34.11-94, BLAKE2, Whirlpool, SM3
; Public-key cryptography:
: RSA, DSA, Diffie–Hellman key exchange, Elliptic curve, X25519, Ed25519, X448, Ed448, GOST R 34.10-2001, SM2

(Perfect forward secrecy is supported using elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman since version 1.0.)

== FIPS 140 validation ==

FIPS 140 is a U.S. Federal program for the testing and certification of cryptographic modules. An early FIPS 140-1 certificate for OpenSSL&#x27;s FOM 1.0 was revoked in July 2006 &quot;when questions were raised about the validated module&#x27;s interaction with outside software.&quot; The module was re-certified in February 2007 before giving way to FIPS 140-2. OpenSSL 1.0.2 supported the use of the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module (FOM), which was built to deliver FIPS approved algorithms in a FIPS 140-2 validated environment. OpenSSL controversially decided to categorize the 1.0.2 architecture as &#x27;end of life&#x27; or &#x27;EOL&#x27;, effective December 31, 2019, despite objections that it was the only version of OpenSSL that was currently available with support for FIPS mode. As a result of the EOL, many users were unable to properly deploy the FOM 2.0 and fell out of compliance because they did not secure extended support for the 1.0.2 architecture, although the FOM itself remained validated for eight months further.

The FIPS Object Module 2.0 remained FIPS 140-2 validated in several formats until September 1, 2020, when NIST deprecated the usage of FIPS 186-2 for Digital Signature Standard and designated all non-compliant modules as &#x27;Historical&#x27;. This designation includes a caution to federal agencies that they should not include the module in any new procurements. All three of the OpenSSL validations were included in the deprecation – the OpenSSL FIPS Object Module (certificate #1747), OpenSSL FIPS Object Module SE (certificate #2398), and OpenSSL FIPS Object Module RE (certificate #2473). Many &#x27;private label&#x27; OpenSSL-based validations and clones created by consultants were also moved to the Historical List, although some FIPS validated modules with replacement compatibility avoided the deprecation, such as BoringCrypto from Google and CryptoComply from SafeLogic.

The OpenSSL Management Committee announced a change in the versioning scheme.

Due to this change, the major number of the next major version would have been doubled, since the OpenSSL FIPS module already occupied this number. Therefore the decision was made to skip the OpenSSL 2.0 version number and continue with OpenSSL 3.0 .

OpenSSL 3.0 restored FIPS mode and underwent FIPS 140-2 testing, but with significant delays: The effort was first kicked off in 2016 with support from SafeLogic and further support from Oracle in 2017, but the process has been challenging.

On October 20, 2020, the OpenSSL FIPS Provider 3.0 was added to the CMVP Implementation Under Test List, which reflected an official engagement with a testing lab to proceed with a FIPS 140-2 validation. This resulted in a slew of certifications in the following months.

== Licensing ==

OpenSSL was dual-licensed under the OpenSSL License and the SSLeay License, which means that the terms of either licenses can be used. The OpenSSL License is Apache License 1.0 and SSLeay License bears some similarity to a 4-clause BSD License.
As the OpenSSL License was Apache License 1.0, but not Apache License 2.0, it requires the phrase &quot;this product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit&quot; to appear in advertising material and any redistributions (Sections 3 and 6 of the OpenSSL License). Due to this restriction, the OpenSSL License and the Apache License 1.0 are incompatible with the GNU GPL.
Some GPL developers have added an &quot;OpenSSL exception&quot; to their licenses that specifically permits using OpenSSL with their system. GNU Wget and climm both use such exceptions. Some packages (like Deluge) explicitly modify the GPL license by adding an extra section at the beginning of the license documenting the exception. Other packages use the LGPL-licensed GnuTLS, BSD-licensed Botan, or MPL-licensed NSS, which perform the same task.

OpenSSL announced in August 2015 that it would require most contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), and that OpenSSL would eventually be relicensed under the terms of Apache License 2.0. This process commenced in March 2017, and was complete in 2018.

On 7 September 2021, OpenSSL 3.0.0 was released under the Apache License 2.0.

== Notable vulnerabilities ==

=== Denial of service: ASN.1 parsing ===

OpenSSL 0.9.6k has a bug where certain ASN.1 sequences triggered a large number of recursions on Windows machines, discovered on November 4, 2003. Windows could not handle large recursions correctly, so OpenSSL would crash as a result. Being able to send arbitrary large numbers of ASN.1 sequences would cause OpenSSL to crash as a result.

=== OCSP stapling vulnerability ===

When creating a handshake, the client could send an incorrectly formatted ClientHello message, leading to OpenSSL parsing more than the end of the message. Assigned the identifier by the CVE project, this affected all OpenSSL versions 0.9.8h to 0.9.8q and OpenSSL 1.0.0 to 1.0.0c. Since the parsing could lead to a read on an incorrect memory address, it was possible for the attacker to cause a DoS. It was also possible that some applications expose the contents of parsed OCSP extensions, leading to an attacker being able to read the contents of memory that came after the ClientHello.

=== ASN.1 BIO vulnerability ===

When using Basic Input/Output (BIO) or FILE based functions to read untrusted DER format data, OpenSSL is vulnerable. This vulnerability was discovered on April 19, 2012, and was assigned the CVE identifier . While not directly affecting the SSL/TLS code of OpenSSL, any application that was using ASN.1 functions (particularly d2i_X509 and d2i_PKCS12) were also not affected.

=== SSL, TLS and DTLS plaintext recovery attack ===

In handling CBC cipher-suites in SSL, TLS, and DTLS, OpenSSL was found vulnerable to a timing attack during the MAC processing. Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson discovered the problem, and published their findings on February 5, 2013. The vulnerability was assigned the CVE identifier .

=== Predictable private keys (Debian-specific) ===

OpenSSL&#x27;s pseudo-random number generator acquires entropy using complex programming methods. To keep the Valgrind analysis tool from issuing associated warnings, a maintainer of the Debian distribution applied a patch to Debian&#x27;s variant of the OpenSSL suite, which inadvertently broke its random number generator by limiting the overall number of private keys it could generate to 32,768. The broken version was included in the Debian release of September 17, 2006 (version 0.9.8c-1), also compromising other Debian-based distributions, for example Ubuntu. Ready-to-use exploits are easily available.

The error was reported by Debian on May 13, 2008. On the Debian 4.0 distribution (etch), these problems were fixed in version 0.9.8c-4etch3, while fixes for the Debian 5.0 distribution (lenny) were provided in version 0.9.8g-9.

=== Heartbleed ===

OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f have a severe memory handling bug in their implementation of the TLS Heartbeat Extension that could be used to reveal up to 64 KB of the application&#x27;s memory with every heartbeat (). By reading the memory of the web server, attackers could access sensitive data, including the server&#x27;s private key. This could allow attackers to decode earlier eavesdropped communications if the encryption protocol used does not ensure perfect forward secrecy. Knowledge of the private key could also allow an attacker to mount a man-in-the-middle attack against any future communications. The vulnerability might also reveal unencrypted parts of other users&#x27; sensitive requests and responses, including session cookies and passwords, which might allow attackers to hijack the identity of another user of the service.

At its disclosure on April 7, 2014, around 17% or half a million of the Internet&#x27;s secure web servers certified by trusted authorities were believed to have been vulnerable to the attack. However, Heartbleed can affect both the server and client.

=== CCS injection vulnerability ===

The CCS Injection Vulnerability () is a security bypass vulnerability that results from a weakness in OpenSSL methods used for keying material.

This vulnerability can be exploited through the use of a man-in-the-middle attack, where an attacker may be able to decrypt and modify traffic in transit. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a specially crafted handshake to force the use of weak keying material. Successful exploitation could lead to a security bypass condition where an attacker could gain access to potentially sensitive information. The attack can only be performed between a vulnerable client &quot;and&quot; server.

OpenSSL clients are vulnerable in all versions of OpenSSL before the versions 0.9.8za, 1.0.0m and 1.0.1h. Servers are only known to be vulnerable in OpenSSL 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta1. Users of OpenSSL servers earlier than 1.0.1 are advised to upgrade as a precaution.

=== ClientHello sigalgs DoS ===

This vulnerability () allows anyone to take a certificate, read its contents and modify it accurately to abuse the vulnerability causing a certificate to crash a client or server. If a client connects to an OpenSSL 1.0.2 server and renegotiates with an invalid signature algorithms extension, a null-pointer dereference occurs. This can cause a DoS attack against the server.

A Stanford Security researcher, David Ramos, had a private exploit and presented it to the OpenSSL team, which then patched the issue.

OpenSSL classified the bug as a high-severity issue, noting version 1.0.2 was found vulnerable.

=== Key recovery attack on Diffie–Hellman small subgroups ===

This vulnerability () allows, when some particular circumstances are met, to recover the OpenSSL server&#x27;s private Diffie–Hellman key. An Adobe System Security researcher, Antonio Sanso, privately reported the vulnerability.

OpenSSL classified the bug as a high-severity issue, noting only version 1.0.2 was found vulnerable.

== Forks ==

=== Agglomerated SSL ===

In 2009, after frustrations with the original OpenSSL API, Marco Peereboom, an OpenBSD developer at the time, forked the original API by creating Agglomerated SSL (assl), which reuses OpenSSL API under the hood, but provides a much simpler external interface. It has since been deprecated in light of the LibreSSL fork circa 2015.

=== LibreSSL ===

In April 2014 in the wake of Heartbleed, members of the OpenBSD project forked OpenSSL starting with the 1.0.1g branch, to create a project named LibreSSL. In the first week of pruning the OpenSSL&#x27;s codebase, more than 90,000 lines of C code had been removed from the fork.

=== BoringSSL ===

In June 2014, Google announced its own fork of OpenSSL dubbed BoringSSL. Google plans to co-operate with OpenSSL and LibreSSL developers. Google has since developed a new library, Tink, based on BoringSSL.

=== AWS-LC ===

In September 2020, it was released as a general-purpose cryptographic library maintained by the Amazon Web Services Cryptography team to be used in the AWS cloud computing platform. It іs based on code from the OpenSSL and BoringSSL projects.

== Criticisms ==

=== Backwards compatibility ===

Among developers communities, OpenSSL is often cited for introducing API compatibility breakage with each new major version, which requires software adaptations that tend to delay new version adoptions. This, combined with the fact that previous releases are generally maintained for no more than two years after a new major one is released tends to force some vendors to anticipate software migrations very early while still having little time left to update to a new release, sometimes at the risk of losing some compatibility with existing software or risking regressions.

=== Delay between releases ===

While long-term support (LTS) releases are maintained for 5 years, accumulated delays in release time frames tend to force operating system vendors to stay on the last supported release longer, leaving less margin when the new version is available. For example OpenSSL 3.0 was initially expected for Q4 2019 and was finally issued 21 months later without extending the expected end of support for previously supported version 1.1.1, and this despite the significant changes that required adaptations to existing software.

=== Significant performance regressions ===

The reduced support delay of version 1.1.1 mentioned above causes further concerns to users whose workloads are sensitive to performance. Some time after general availability of 3.0, some users started to report serious performance regressions affecting this version in multi-threaded environments, many citing the inefficient use of locks in frequent low-level operations, citing slowdowns from 80 to 400 times. The OpenSSL team has created a meta-issue to try to centralize reports of such massive performance regressions. About half of these reporters indicate the impossibility for them to upgrade to 3.0 from earlier versions, adding to the trouble caused by the limited support time left on previous version 1.1.1.

=== Consideration for users&#x27; requirements ===

While the QUIC transport layer was being worked on to support the third version of the HTTP protocol, it was proposed to use TLS to provide security, and identified that some adaptations to TLS libraries would be needed. Such modifications were brought to BoringSSL which was the library being primarily used by QUIC developers by then, and later ported to other libraries. A port of this work was quickly proposed to OpenSSL. While some discussion started the same day, it quickly stalled and was first blocked on license considerations, then kept on hold once these concerns were cleared. Finally 10 months later the OpenSSL Management Committee announced on a blog post that this patch set would not be adopted for 3.0 on the fear that the API would change over time. Finally more than one year after planned release of 3.0 which was still not coming, a team of volunteers from Akamai and Microsoft decided to fork the project as QuicTLS and support these patches on top of the OpenSSL code in order to unblock QUIC development. This action was generally welcome by the community. Finally after OpenSSL 3.0 was finally released, the QUIC patch set was reconsidered and decided against, causing tens to hundreds of reactions of disappointment among the community. The pull request was closed, while users felt the need to publicly express their disappointment, or beg operating system vendors to support the alternative QuicTLS fork, or seek for alternative solutions. Finally Rich Salz, co-founder of the QuicTLS fork, announced his interest in seeing an Apache project forked from QuicTLS. As of 25 February 2023 there is still no QUIC-compatible long-term supported TLS library available by default in operating systems without requiring end-users to rebuild it themselves from sources.

<text>Marquess of Ailsa, of the Isle of Ailsa in the County of Ayr, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 10 September 1831 for Archibald Kennedy, 12th Earl of Cassilis. The title Earl of Cassilis (pronounced &quot;Cassels&quot;) had been created in 1509 for the 3rd Lord Kennedy. This title had been created in the Peerage of Scotland in 1457. The 1st Marquess had been created Baron Ailsa in the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 12 November 1806.

The name of the title was taken from the Island of Ailsa Craig in the Firth of Clyde.

James Kennedy, Archbishop of St Andrews, was the younger brother of the first Lord Kennedy.

The Marquess of Ailsa is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Kennedy.

The family&#x27;s seats were Cassillis House and Culzean Castle, near Maybole, Ayrshire.

==Lords Kennedy (1457)==
* Gilbert Kennedy, 1st Lord Kennedy (–)
* John Kennedy, 2nd Lord Kennedy (died 1508)
* David Kennedy, 3rd Lord Kennedy (died 1513) (created Earl of Cassilis in 1509)

==Earls of Cassilis (1509)==
* David Kennedy, 1st Earl of Cassilis (1463–1513)
* Gilbert Kennedy, 2nd Earl of Cassilis (died 1527)
* Gilbert Kennedy, 3rd Earl of Cassilis (1515–1558)
* Gilbert Kennedy, 4th Earl of Cassilis (c. 1541–1576)
* John Kennedy, 5th Earl of Cassilis (c. 1573–1615)
* John Kennedy, 6th Earl of Cassilis (died 1668)
* John Kennedy, 7th Earl of Cassilis (1653–1701)
* John Kennedy, 8th Earl of Cassilis (1700–1759)

From 1759 to 1762 the titles and estates were in dispute between the heir male and the heir general. The latter, William [Douglas], Earl of Ruglen and March later Duke of Queensberry, was son and heir of William [Douglas], Earl of March, by his wife Anne [Hamilton], &quot;suo jure&quot; Countess of Ruglen, 1st dau. and heir of line of John [Hamilton], Earl of Selkirk and Ruglen, by his first wife Lady Anne Kennedy, the only daughter that had issue of John [Kennedy], 7th Earl of Cassillis. He claimed the estates under an entail of 5 September 1698, which he contended could not be set aside by the entail of 1759. The entail of 1759 was however upheld, though by a narrow majority, in the Court of Session, and confirmed, on appeal, by the House of Lords. He then, under the designation of &quot;William, Earl of Cassillis, Ruglen and March&quot; claimed &quot;the titles and honours of Earl of Cassillis and Lord Kennedy,&quot; on the ground of certain charters of 24 April 1641 and 29 September 1642. Sir Thomas Kennedy, Bart., claimed the said titles as heir male, and the two petitions having been laid before the House of Lords, it was adjudged, 27 January 1762, that the latter had a right &quot;to the honour and dignity of Earl of Cassillis as heir male of the body of David, the 1st Earl of Cassillis, and [to that] of Lord Kennedy as heir male of the body of Gilbert, the 1st Lord Kennedy.&quot;

* Thomas Kennedy, 9th Earl of Cassilis (died 1775), previously the 4th Baronet of Culzean

* Archibald Kennedy, 11th Earl of Cassilis (died 1794)
* Archibald Kennedy, 12th Earl of Cassilis (1770–1846) (created Baron Ailsa in 1806 and Marquess of Ailsa in 1831)

<doc id="438825" wikidata="Q11770357" url="?curid=438825" title="Marquess of Abergavenny">
<text>Marquess of Abergavenny (pronounced Aber&quot;genn&quot;y) in the County of Monmouth, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom created on 14 January 1876, along with the title Earl of Lewes (pronounced &quot;Lewis&quot;), in the County of Sussex, for the 5th Earl of Abergavenny, a member of the Nevill family.

The 6th and present Marquess is Christopher George Charles Nevill (b. 23 April 1955), son of Lord Rupert Nevill and Lady Anne Camilla Evelyn Wallop. He succeeded to the title in 2000 on the death of his uncle the 5th Marquess, who had no surviving sons.

The family seat is Eridge Park, near Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent.

==History==

===Medieval origins===
The incumbent Marquess of Abergavenny is the current head of the House of Neville, a noble house of early medieval origins, notable for its central role in the Wars of the Roses. Lord Abergavenny&#x27;s ancestor, Edward Neville, 3rd Baron Bergavenny, was a younger son of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, and Lady Joan Beaufort, daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Abergavenny in the Marquess&#x27;s title derives from the market town in Wales in which this branch of the Nevill family inherited Abergavenny Castle, much of the family&#x27;s ancestral lands and title of Baron Bergavenny by virtue of the marriage between the &quot;suo jure&quot; peeress Elizabeth de Beauchamp, Baroness Bergavenny, and Edward Neville in 1424.

===Subsidiary titles===
Subsequent Nevill Barons Bergavenny have been raised to higher ranks within the peerage. The 1st Marquess&#x27;s ancestor, the &quot;de facto&quot; 17th (&quot;de jure&quot; 2nd) Baron Bergavenny, was created Earl of Abergavenny, in the County of Monmouth, and Viscount Nevill, of Birling in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of Great Britain on 17 May 1784. The Barony of Bergavenny was held by his successors, the Earls and Marquesses of Abergavenny, until 1938, when it passed into abeyance between the two daughters of the 3rd Marquess. The 5th Earl of Abergavenny was elevated to the title of Marquess of Abergavenny along with the subsidiary title of Earl of Lewes on 14 January 1876, following his role in the foundation of the modern-day Conservative Party with Disraeli and Lord Salisbury.

==Coat of arms==
The heraldic blazon for the coat of arms of the Marquesses of Abergavenny is: &quot;Gules, a saltire argent charged with a rose of the field (barbed and seeded proper)&quot;. These are the ancient arms of Neville differenced by a rose, the symbol of a 7th son, in reference to Sir Edward Neville, 1st Baron Bergavenny (d.1476), 7th son of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland. The blazon can be translated as &quot;On a red background, a white saltire with a red rose, naturally coloured, upon it.&quot;

<doc id="438829" wikidata="Q840233" url="?curid=438829" title="Marquess of Linlithgow">
<text>Marquess of Linlithgow, in the County of Linlithgow or West Lothian, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 23 October 1902 for John Hope, 7th Earl of Hopetoun. The current holder of the title is Adrian Hope.

This branch of the Hope family descends from Sir Charles Hope, grandson of Sir James Hope, sixth son of Sir Thomas Hope, 1st Baronet, of Craighall (see Hope baronets). In 1703 he was created Lord Hope, Viscount Aithrie and Earl of Hopetoun in the Peerage of Scotland, with remainder to the heirs male and female of his body. He later served as Lord Lieutenant of Linlithgowshire and as Governor of the Bank of Scotland. Lord Hopetoun married Lady Henrietta, only surviving daughter of William Johnstone, 1st Marquess of Annandale (died 1721). He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. In 1763 he succeeded his kinsman as fourth Baronet, of Kirkliston (see Hope baronets for earlier history of this title).

His son from his first marriage, the third Earl, served as Lord Lieutenant of Linlithgowshire from 1794 to 1816 and sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1784 to 1794. In 1792 Lord Hopetoun succeeded his great-uncle as &quot;de jure&quot; fifth Earl of Annandale and Hartfell, although he never successfully claimed this title. In 1809 he was created Baron Hopetoun, of Hopetoun in the County of Linlithgow, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, with remainder to the heirs male of his father. He died without male issue and the claim the earldom passed to his daughter Lady Anne (see below and the Earl of Annandale and Hartfell for later history of this branch of the family). Lord Hopetoun was succeeded (in the barony of Hopetoun according to the special remainder) by his half-brother, the fourth Earl. He was a general in the army, sat as Member of Parliament for Linlithgow and served as Lord Lieutenant of Linlithgowshire. In 1814, two years before he succeeded in the earldom, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom in his own right as Baron Niddry, of Niddry Castle in the County of Linlithgow.

He was succeeded by his son, the fifth Earl. He was Lord Lieutenant of Linlithgowshire. His son, the sixth Earl, also served as Lord Lieutenant of Linlithgowshire. He was succeeded by his son, the seventh Earl. He was a prominent colonial administrator and Conservative politician and served as Governor of Victoria, as the first Governor-General of Australia and as Secretary of State for Scotland. In 1902 he was created Marquess of Linlithgow, in the County of Linlithgow or West Lothian. His son, the second Marquess, was also a politician and served as Viceroy of India from 1936 to 1943. He was succeeded by his eldest twin son, the third Marquess. He was Lord Lieutenant of West Lothian from 1964 to 1985. the titles are held by his only son, the fourth Marquess, who succeeded in 1985.

The family seat is Hopetoun House, near Queensferry, West Lothian.

<doc id="438836" wikidata="Q7290570" url="?curid=438836" title="Ramón Valdés">
<text>Ramón Esteban Gómez-Valdés y Castillo (2 September 1924 – 9 August 1988) was a Mexican actor and comedian. He is best remembered for his portrayal of Don Ramón. He is also recognized as one of Mexico&#x27;s best comedians.

Born in Mexico City, he was raised in a humble and large family that moved to Ciudad Juárez when he was aged two. Valdés made his acting debut at cinema in the movie &quot;Tender Pumpkins&quot; (1949), appearing along with his brother, Germán Valdés, already an actor better known as &quot;Tin-Tan&quot;, and who introduced Ramón into the acting world. Under extra or supporting roles, he continued making appearances in films during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. Ramón and Germán had two other brothers, also actors, Manuel Valdés, better known as &quot;Manuel &quot;El Loco&quot; Valdés&quot;, and Antonio Valdés, better known as &quot;El Ratón Valdés&quot;.

In 1968, Valdés met Roberto Gómez Bolaños, better known as &quot;Chespirito&quot;, with whom he began working on programs such as &quot;Los supergenios de la mesa cuadrada&quot;, &quot;Chespirito&quot; and &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot;. It was on Bolaños&#x27;s sitcom &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot; that he gained international fame for his portrayal of Don Ramón. He left &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot; in 1979 but returned in 1981 for his final year on the project.

In 1982, Valdés starred with Carlos Villagrán on the Venezuelan sitcom &quot;Federrico&quot; and on &quot;Ah que Kiko&quot; in 1987.

== Life and career ==

=== 1924–1968: Childhood, early career and multiple films ===

Ramón Esteban Gómez Valdés y Castillo was born on 2 September 1924, in Mexico City, a son of Rafael Gómez-Valdés Angellini and Guadalupe Castillo. He lived a quiet childhood, without being surrounded by many luxuries. He had several brothers, Germán Valdés &quot;Tin Tan&quot;, Manuel &quot;El Loco&quot; Valdés, Antonio Valdés &quot;El Ratón Valdés&quot;, Guadalupe, Angela, Cristóbal, Antonio and Armando. He was nicknamed &quot;El Moncho&quot;. At the age of two, his family moved to Ciudad Juárez.

In his youth, Valdés earned his living in multiple activities and trades, and due to this instability, he sometimes faced economic problems. At the same time he began his artistic career thanks to the support of his brother Germán (&quot;Tin Tan&quot;), who took him to act with him in different projects, so he participated in more than 50 films of the Golden Age of Mexican cinema. His film debut took place on &quot;Tender Pumpkins&quot; (1949). He continued appearing on multiple movies as an extra or with supporting roles till he met Roberto Gomez Bolaños (Chespirito) in 1968.

=== 1968–1980: Meeting with Chespirito and career success ===

In 1968, he met Roberto Gomez Bolaños (Chespirito) on the program &quot;Sábados de la fortuna&quot;, Bolaños saw the talent of Váldes and he made him part of the cast of comedians for his new television project called &quot;Los supergenios de la mesa cuadrada&quot;, where he performed along with María Antonieta de las Nieves and Rubén Aguirre. Then the program changed its name to &quot;Chespirito&quot;. It was so successful that it was on television for many years. Then came the television phenomenon &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot; in 1973, where he played Don Ramón, achieving more success and recognition than he had experienced before. It is said that his character was similar to Váldes in real life. Coworker Rubén Aguirre stated:

He also participated in &quot;El Chapulín Colorado&quot; airing in 1973 in which he portrayed multiple characters.

=== 1980–1988: Return with Chespirito and final projects ===
After quitting the part of Don Ramón in El Chavo del Ocho, Valdés continued making films until 1986.

He returned to television in 1981, performing in &quot;Chespirito&quot; as his former characters. He also returned to &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot;, this being kept as a secret until the moment of recording. According to the history behind his return on one of the episodes in the series, Váldes entered the set to surprise La Chilindrina (María Antonieta de las Nieves) and such was the surprise of the actress, that the tears shed during that scene were real. Valdés only stayed one more year in the production as at the end of that year he left the program forever.

In 1982, Valdés returned to television with Carlos Villagrán on the Venezuelan show &quot;Federrico&quot; and on &quot;¡Ah qué Kiko!&quot; in 1987 with these two being his final projects.

== Other media ==
In 1984, Váldes starred in a musical program entitled &quot;Aprendiz de Pirata&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Pirate Apprentice&quot;) with Luis Miguel in which he performed his song &quot;Tú No Tienes Corazón&quot; of his 1984 album &quot;Palabra de honor&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Valdés was a Roman Catholic of Spanish and Italian descent who owned a circus. According to Valdés, he had a falling out with Chespirito after he refused to lend Valdés 20,000 pesos he needed to buy a house.

Valdés had three wives with whom he had a total of 10 children. One of his wives was the singer Araceli Julián.

Valdés kept a strong friendship with Angelines Fernández, an actress on &quot;El Chavo del Ocho&quot;, better known on the show as Doña Clotilde &quot;La Bruja del 71&quot;. At Valdés&#x27;s funeral, Fernández stood in front of his coffin, crying inconsolably due to his death. Valdés was also good friends with María Antonieta de las Nieves. A persistent rumor remains that Fernández, who showed an unrequited strong romance for Valdés&#x27;s character was actually in love with Valdés in real life, but this has remained unconfirmed by those close to them.

He was the uncle of Mexican pop singer Cristian Castro; his brother Manuel &quot;El Loco&quot; Váldes was Castro&#x27;s father.

== Death ==

Valdés was a heavy tobacco smoker and people close to him stated that it was not unusual to see him with a cigarette in the recording sets.

On 9 August 1988, Valdés died of stomach cancer at age 63. The cancer had spread to his spinal cord. Valdés was entombed at Mausoleos del Ángel in Mexico City, the same cemetery where Angelines Fernández rests.

== Legacy ==
Valdés is remembered as one of the most beloved actors from El Chavo del Ocho for portraying Don Ramón.

=== Posthumous documentary ===
On 17 May 2019, a trailer on Valdés&#x27; official YouTube account was released for &quot;Con permisito dijo Monchito&quot; (Spanish for, Excuse me, said Little Moncho), a documentary featuring Valdés&#x27;s life with unpublished material, interviews with fans and fellow co-workers and little known things about him.

<doc id="438840" wikidata="Q693430" url="?curid=438840" title="Marquess of Reading">
<text>Marquess of Reading is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1926 for Rufus Isaacs, who had been Member of Parliament for Reading between 1904 and 1913, before serving as Viceroy of India and Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. He had already been created Baron Reading, of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire, in 1914, Viscount Reading, of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire, in 1916, and Viscount Erleigh, of Erleigh in the County of Berkshire, and Earl of Reading, in 1917.

The marquessate of Reading is the highest title in the British peerage ever attained by a Jew, and is the most recently created &quot;extant&quot; marquessate in the Peerage of the United Kingdom (that of Willingdon was created in 1936 but became extinct in 1979). In this role, the marquessate of Reading is currently the junior-most marquessate in the Order of precedence in England and Wales.

Upon the death of the 1st Marquess of Reading, he was succeeded by his son, the second marquess. He notably held ministerial office from 1951 to 1957 in the Conservative administrations of Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden. the titles are held by his grandson, the fourth marquess, who succeeded his father in 1980. The family seat was Jaynes Court, near Bisley, Gloucestershire.

In May 1804, the title of Baron Reading was offered to the outgoing prime minister, Henry Addington, who had many links with the largely pre-industrialised town, as a subsidiary title of the customary retirement earldom for prime ministers. However, Addington refused the honour, though later accepting a peerage as Viscount Sidmouth.

<doc id="438843" wikidata="Q535360" url="?curid=438843" title="George Herbert Walker">
<text>George Herbert &quot;Bert&quot; Walker Sr. (June 11, 1875 – June 24, 1953) was an American banker and businessman. He was the maternal grandfather of the 41st United States President George H. W. Bush and a great-grandfather of President George W. Bush, both of whom were named in his honor. He was also the amateur heavyweight-boxing champion of Missouri while studying law at Washington University School of Law.

==Early life and education ==
George Herbert Walker was born on June 11, 1875, in St. Louis, Missouri. Walker was descended from a Maryland family. He was the youngest son of David Davis Walker, a dry goods merchant from Bloomington, Illinois, and Martha Adela (Beaky). Ely, Walker &amp; Company, which grew into a leading regional wholesaler, was later acquired by Burlington Industries.

Walker, who was Roman Catholic, was educated at Stonyhurst College, a Jesuit boarding school in England. He graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in 1897.

==Career==

=== Business Career ===
Walker started a banking and investment firm named G.H. Walker &amp; Co. in 1900. His family had developed many international banking contacts, and he helped organize the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. Walker was known as the power behind the local Democratic Party.

In 1920, Walker became the President of the W.A. Harriman &amp; Co. investment firm, and quickly arranged the credits that W. Averell Harriman needed to take control of the Hamburg-Amerika Line. Walker also organized the American Ship and Commerce Corp. to be subsidiary of the W.A. Harriman &amp; Co., with contractual power over the affairs of the Hamburg-Amerika. W.A. Harriman &amp; Co. (renamed Harriman Brothers &amp; Company in 1927) well-positioned for this enterprise and rich in assets from their German and Russian business, merged with the British-American investment house Brown Bros. &amp; Co. on January 1, 1931. Walker retired to his own G.H. Walker &amp; Co. This left the Harriman brothers, his son-in-law Prescott Bush and Thatcher M. Brown as senior partners of the new firm of Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co. The firm&#x27;s London branch continued operating under its historic name Brown, Shipley &amp; Co.

Walker was a director of the W.A. Harriman &amp; Company; Harriman Fifteen, American International Corporation; Georgian Manganese Corporation; Barnsdall Corporation; American Ship &amp; Commerce Corporation; Union Banking Corporation; G.H. Walker &amp; Company; Missouri Pacific Railroad; Laclede Gas and the New Orleans, Texas and Mexico Railroad.

=== Golf and horse racing ===
In addition to his business concerns, Walker was also a golf enthusiast and a President of the United States Golf Association (USGA). The USGA&#x27;s Walker Cup (the famous biennial golf match) acquired Walker&#x27;s namesake for his role in the event&#x27;s creation. Walker was a member of Deepdale Golf Club as well as National Golf Links of America, the location of the first Walker Cup.

He also coheaded the syndicate, (with W. Averell Harriman), which rebuilt the famed sports venue of Madison Square Garden and the Belmont Race Track, 1925.

==Personal life==
Walker married Lucretia Wear (1874–1961), daughter of James H. Wear and they had six children: 

* Dorothy Wear Walker, wife of U.S. Senator Prescott Bush, mother of President George H. W. Bush and grandmother of George W. Bush;
* George Herbert Walker Jr., co-founder of the New York Mets;
* Dr. John M. Walker Sr., CEO of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and father of Judge John M. Walker Jr.;
* James Wear Walker; 
* Nancy Walker; and
* Louis Walker (S&amp;B 1936). 

His brother-in-law Joseph Walker Wear was one of the founders of the Davis Cup. His son-in-law Prescott Bush was a member of the executive committee of the USGA, serving successively as Secretary, Vice President and President, 1928–1935. Walker not only maintained the Walker&#x27;s Point estate in Kennebunkport, but also a mansion on Long Island, and a stunning residence at One Sutton Place in Manhattan. In the 1930s Walker purchased the 10,000-acre (40 km2) Duncannon Plantation near Barnwell, South Carolina, as a private hunting retreat. In the 1940s Walker moved out of the circa 1835 plantation house, and the property became a hunting club. Much of the land was later purchased by the U.S. Government for development of the Savannah River Site.

==Death and legacy==
Walker died in 1953 in New York City, aged 78. He was survived by his wife, several grandchildren including George H. W. Bush, Ambassador to Hungary and Stifel Nicolas CEO George Herbert Walker III, William H. T. (Bucky) Bush, Nancy Ellis Bush, Ray Walker, Betty Walker Holden, and many great-grandchildren including George W. Bush and Jeb Bush.

The first correctly exposed photograph, a daguerrotype, of the solar corona is made during the total phase of the eclipse by Berkowski at Koenigsberg Observatory in Prussia. Astronomers Robert Grant and William Swan (of the United Kingdom) and Karl Ludwig von Littrow (of Austria) observe this eclipse and determine that solar prominences are part of the Sun because the Moon is seen to cover and uncover them as it moves in front.
* October 24 – Ariel and Umbriel, moons of Uranus, were discovered by William Lassell.
* The William Brydone Jack Observatory is completed at Fredericton, New Brunswick.

==Chemistry==
* March – English sculptor Frederick Scott Archer makes public the wet plate collodion photographic process.
* Julius Pintsch produces Pintsch gas.
* Charles-Adolphe Wurtz produces compound ureas.

==History of science and technology==
* George Wilson publishes &quot;The Life of the Hon. Henry Cavendish&quot;.

==Mathematics==
* Eugène Prouhet first applies the Thue–Morse sequence to number theory.
* Bernhard Riemann provides a proof of Green&#x27;s theorem in his inaugural dissertation.

==Medicine==
* The Royal Marsden is established as the Free Cancer Hospital by surgeon William Marsden in London, the world&#x27;s first specialist cancer hospital.
* The Keratometer is invented by the German physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz.

==Physics==
* Hippolyte Fizeau carries out the Fizeau experiment to measure the relative speeds of light in moving water.

==Technology==
* November 13 – First protected submarine telegraph cable laid, across the English Channel.
* William Armstrong introduces the weight-loaded hydraulic accumulator.

==Awards==
* Copley Medal: Richard Owen
* Wollaston Medal for geology: Adam Sedgwick

==Births==
* January 19 – Jacobus Kapteyn (died 1922), Dutch astronomer.
* February 15 – Spiru Haret (died 1912), Romanian mathematician, astronomer and politician.
* March 16 – Martinus Beijerinck (died 1931), Dutch microbiologist and botanist.
* April 12 – E. Walter Maunder (died 1928), English astronomer.
* July 8 – Arthur Evans (died 1941), English archaeologist.
* July 20 – Arnold Pick (died 1924), Jewish Czech neurologist.
* August 3 – George FitzGerald (died 1901), Irish mathematician.
* September 21 – Fanny Searls (died 1939), American doctor and botanist.

==Deaths==
* January 27 – John James Audubon (born 1785), naturalist and illustrator.
* February 18 – Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi (born 1804), mathematician.
* March 9 – Hans Christian Ørsted (born 1777), physicist.
* July 6 – Thomas Davenport (born 1802), electrical engineer.
* July 17 – John Farey (born 1791), mechanical engineer and technical writer.
* September 2 – William Nicol (born 1770), geologist.

<text>A fire marshal, in the United States and Canada, is often a member of a state, provincial or territorial government, but may be part of a building department or a separate department altogether. Fire marshals&#x27; duties vary but usually include fire code enforcement or investigating fires for origin and cause. Fire marshals may be sworn law enforcement officers and are often experienced firefighters. In larger cities with substantially developed fire departments the local fire departments are sometimes delegated some of the duties of the fire marshal. 
A fire marshal&#x27;s duties vary by location. Fire marshals may carry a weapon, wear a badge, wear a uniform or plain clothes, can drive marked or unmarked cars, and make arrests pertaining to arson and related offenses, or, in other localities, may have duties entirely separate from law enforcement, including building- and fire-code-related inspections. In many areas, the fire marshal is responsible for enforcing laws concerning flammable materials.

== Canada ==
In Ontario, the Office of the Fire Marshal (OFM), part of the Ministry of the Solicitor General (Ontario), provides support to municipal fire departments, sets training requirements for firefighters, and advises the government on legislation. The Fire Marshal is responsible for investigating the origins of fires.

== United States ==

=== Arizona fire marshals ===

In Arizona, fire marshals are employed at the municipal, county, and state levels of government, and possess law enforcement powers where they relate to arson investigation. At the state level, the Office of the State Fire Marshal (SFM) is led by the State Fire Marshal and employs paid deputy fire marshals and unpaid assistant fire inspectors. Deputy Fire Marshals are full time employees of the SFM, while assistant fire inspectors are appointed from local Fire chiefs or those recommended by them. Both deputies and inspectors attend fire inspector training, have fire prevention and fire protection and possess law enforcement powers where they relate to their duties. Duties of fire marshals in Arizona include:

*Assisting in the enforcement of state, county, and local fire laws
*Investigating the causes, origins, and circumstances of fires, including those suspected of arson
*Collecting evidence
*Operating a fire safety inspection program for public buildings and schools
*Inspecting residential complexes
*Maintaining and propagating fire-related laws
*Operating an arson detection reward fund
*Providing and coordinating firefighting and fire protection training

=== California fire marshals ===

Like most states, Californian fire marshals are typically associated with a city or region&#x27;s local fire department. Yet, California has two additional authorities that hold the official designations of fire marshal. One is the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). It is tasked with the building code enforcement of all structures and occupancies within the state. They have the authority to issue building permits, conduct building inspections and investigate code violations. California Fire marshals are designated peace officers. The person heading this office is officially designated as the State Fire Marshal.

The second authority designated as fire marshals is the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) who is the state building official for all California hospitals. They are tasked with the structural, electrical and fire/life safety reliability of all hospital construction in the state. This responsibility is paramount in California due to the frequency and intensity of earthquake seismic activity it experiences.

=== Florida Fire Marshal ===
The Florida Division of State Fire Marshal (SFM) is located within the Department of Financial Services, where the Chief Financial Officer of Florida (CFO) also serves as Florida&#x27;s State Fire Marshal.

The SFM office serves local fire departments who request assistance with conducting fire investigations and provides fire training colleges throughout the state. It is headquartered in Tallahassee, with numerous field offices located across the state.

The investigators working for the SFM office are sworn law enforcement officers, with powers to make arrests, conduct searches and seizures, serve summonses, and carry firearms. These law enforcement officers conduct complex investigations and have the ability to make arrests statewide. Investigators conduct thousands of fire-related investigations each year, with approximately 45% being determined to be arson in 2009. Florida SFM investigators make arrest in 18% of the arson fires investigated, which is above the national average of 16%. Fire investigations are complex and potentially dangerous.

The Florida SFM Forensic Laboratory receives and examines over 10,000 evidence submissions every year. These submissions come from fire departments, police departments, sheriff&#x27;s offices and SFM investigators. The crime laboratory offers a wide variety of services to include examination of fire debris, explosives analysis, image reproduction and forensic video analysis. The forensic experts in the laboratory conduct consultations with investigators, prosecutors, and other attorneys on analyses and general aspects of forensic science. These consultations are often in preparation for expert witness testimony in criminal court.

The Florida SFM office issues over 3,000 basic firefighter certifications every year. There are thirty-five certified training centers located across the state and the Florida State Fire College. The State Fire College trains over six thousand students per year in a wide variety of certification and professional development programs to include Pump Operator, Fire Officer, Fire Investigator, HAZMAT, etc.

The Florida SFM is responsible for inspecting over 14,000 state-owned buildings every year. SFM code enforcement and inspection activities also reach over 16,000 public and private buildings; to include prisons, universities, public schools, thousands of fuel-fired boiler systems, hundreds of construction mining sites and explosive storage locations each year.

The Florida Fire Incident Reporting Section collects over 1,800,000 fire and emergency reports per year. These local fire department and fire service reports are combined with the other states reports in the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) for use by the fire services in analysis and trends. The Florida reports are also used to form the basis for the SFM Annual Report &quot;Florida Fires&quot;.

The SFM has authority to implement rules that conform to the standards of fire safety and the need to protect Floridians from fire hazards. Additionally, the SFM shall adopt and administer rules prescribing standards for the safety and health of occupants of educational and ancillary facilities pursuant to ss. 633.022, 1013.12, 1013.37, and 1013.371.

In any county that does not employ or appoint a local fire official, the State Fire Marshal shall assume the duties of the local fire official with respect to fire safety inspections of educational property required under s. 1013.12(2)(b), and the State Fire Marshal may take necessary corrective action as authorized under s. 1013.12(5).

=== New York City Fire Marshals ===

New York City&#x27;s Bureau of Fire Investigation, a division of the FDNY, currently employs about 140 Fire Marshals, 30 Supervising Fire Marshals (equal in rank to Captain) as well as several Commanders (equal in rank to Deputy Chief), an Assistant Chief Fire Marshal and a Chief Fire Marshal. The position of fire marshal is a promotional civil service title and all officers have served several years as active firefighters. Unlike many other jurisdictions, the New York City fire marshals are armed police officers with full powers of arrest who generally work in pairs and investigate serious fires with the New York City Police Department. New York City Fire Marshals undergo comprehensive police training to include annual weapons qualification at Camp Smith. Investigations are conducted in cooperation with the New York City Police Department, with whom they have a close relationship. In a typical year they are assigned about 4,000 fires within the five boroughs of the city. New York Fire Marshals often receive special training at the FBI academy in Quantico, Virginia, as well as attending investigative classes conducted by the NYPD and explosives training classes sponsored by the federal government in Socorro, New Mexico. Under New York State Consolidated Laws Article 35.00 section 35.20 &quot;deadly physical force may be used in order to terminate or prevent commission of arson.&quot;

The city&#x27;s first fire marshal, George H. Sheldon, was appointed in 1873, eight years after the reorganization of the fire department into a career department in 1865. Robert O. Lowery became the first African-American fire marshal in 1946. Lowery would ultimately rise to the top of the department, being appointed the city&#x27;s fire commissioner in 1965.

Fire marshals have conducted a number of significant investigations, including the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911. They investigate insurance fraud involving arson, and more recently, potential terrorism. They also function as expert witnesses in arson cases. At times New York fire marshals work undercover and conduct surveillance operations. They also coordinate with federal, state and local law enforcement because arsonists are frequently involved in other criminal activity as well, and some investigations, like the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, require multiple agencies&#x27; skills.

The first line of duty NYC fire marshal death was from the September 11, 2001, attacks when Marshal Ronald Paul Bucca, disregarding the danger, rushed into the World Trade Center to assist in the rescue of civilians trapped within the towers. Bucca, badge 317, a decorated Vietnam War combat veteran, reached the 78th floor of the South Tower along with Battalion Chief Orio Palmer, before the South Tower collapsed. The pair had worked on the 1993 investigation at the same site.

Professional training outside the state at the FBI Academy at Quantico, Virginia, and other locations for New York City marshals was made possible through federal counter-terror grants, subsequent to 9/11, actively supported by Mayor Mike Bloomberg.

New York State Executive Law, article 6c, sec 159, created an arson control board that mandated every jurisdiction prepare an arson control plan and a strong coordinated arson control program to include certification of investigators in compliance with NFPA 921 and NFPA 1033. A state standard of level I and level II fire investigator certification was developed. New York City Fire Marshal&#x27;s training exceeds the requirements of level II.

=== Pennsylvania fire marshals ===

There are two levels of fire marshals in Pennsylvania, the state police fire marshal and the local fire marshal. The State Fire Marshal had been an independent office until powers and duties were transferred to the state police in 1919. In 1927, the state (Commonwealth) created the local fire marshal position underneath the state police, via an act of April 27, 1927 (P.L. 450, No. 291).

The Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) fire marshals are usually considered the final investigative authority for fires deemed exceptionally costly (over $1,000,000) or where a death has occurred. PSP fire marshals are notified by the local fire marshal when their involvement is necessary. State law authorizes and identifies the local fire marshal as an &quot;Assistant to the State Police Fire Marshal&quot;. Local fire marshals are selected for their positions by the local fire chief or municipality. The State Police Commissioner (Colonel) then appoints them to the PSP office.

Local fire marshals are authorized to investigate fires, obtain and execute search documents, take evidence, and detain and question in the process of establishing origin and cause. This process may or may not result in affecting an arrest or prosecution. Both levels of Fire Marshals often testify in civil and criminal court proceedings, and respond and collaborate with insurance investigators. Along with state law, many municipalities have assigned local law enforcement officer (LEO) status to their respective fire marshals due to the nature of the service, requirements to detain, question or arrest, enforce fire safety-related laws, and to protect themselves during potential high-risk investigations. (Some of the largest methamphetamine labs in the U.S. have been found in Pennsylvania during local fire marshal&#x27;s investigations.)

All municipalities and fire districts require fundamental fire training and substantial fire fighting experience, followed by progressive continuing fire investigation education supplied by the Pennsylvania State Police. Municipalities who have granted specific LEO status usually require either PA Act 120 or PA Act 235 training in addition.

=== Virginia Fire Marshals ===
The Virginia State Fire Marshal&#x27;s Office is part of the Virginia Department of Fire Programs; the current marshal is Charles E. Altizer, P.E. The mission of the office is to provide safety to life and property from fire for the citizens of the Commonwealth. To do this, the Office:
* Utilizes inspectors and engineers to complete fire safety inspections in localities that do not have their own fire code official;
* Conducts building plan reviews for fire safety measures;
* Conducts construction inspections for fire safety systems in state buildings;
* Provides assistance to local building and fire code officials; and
* Responds to complaints and questions from private citizens.

Many of Virginia&#x27;s larger urban localities have their own local fire official. For example, Fairfax County&#x27;s Office of the Fire Marshal has over 100 employees who are trained and certified to enforce a variety of fire prevention regulations including portions of the Uniform Statewide Building Code. The Office, which is the Fire Prevention Division of the Fire &amp; Rescue Department&#x27;s Business Services Bureau, functions under the command of a Deputy Fire Chief, who is responsible for oversight of all aspects of the Office&#x27;s mission, including supervision of the Fire Prevention Services (FPS) and Hazardous Materials &amp; Investigative Services (HMIS) sections, each commanded by a Battalion Fire Chief. The mission is to prevent the inception or recurrence of fire and hazardous conditions by providing fire prevention and hazardous materials-related educational, enforcement, inspection, investigative, plans review, and technical services to the businesses, industries, residents, and visitors of Fairfax County and the towns of Clifton, Herndon, and Vienna.

=== Washington Fire Marshals ===

The Washington State Fire Marshal&#x27;s Office is a bureau within the Washington State Patrol. The Office of the State Fire Marshal provides services including incident reporting, data collection, code review, construction plan fire safety, fireworks and supervision of sprinkler installation.

== United Kingdom ==

The American definition of a fire marshal should not be confused with that used in the United Kingdom. Fire marshals (sometimes known as &quot;fire wardens&quot;) are civilians trained to assist in fire evacuation procedures at businesses and other organizations, usually employees.

There is no direct equivalent to a US fire marshal in the United Kingdom. The enforcement and investigation role are carried out by two separate professionals known as fire investigators and fire inspectors.

Fire investigators are highly trained and experienced firefighters or fire officers, who investigate cases of arson and other fire incidents where the cause of the fire is unclear or disputed. Fire investigations can also be carried out by police scenes of crime officers. Fire investigators do not fulfill a direct law enforcement role but instead act as expert witnesses in any prosecutions brought forward by the police or fire service.

The enforcement of fire safety legislation is undertaken by fire safety inspectors, or fire safety officers as they are sometimes known.

UK fire officers do not have powers of arrest but can place suspects under caution and prosecute anyone who has failed to comply with fire safety law. They also have the authority to close unsafe premises and investigate any actual perceived fire safety offence. They have substantial powers of entry. Most fire inspectors are experienced firefighters / fire officers, but there are also several civilian fire inspectors.

== Australia ==

Australia uses similar terminology to the United Kingdom, with Fire Warden (or increasingly &quot;Emergency Warden&quot; or simply &quot;Warden&quot;) being the preferred term used for civilians designated by a facility as responsible for managing fire and other emergencies in buildings.

The closest equivalent of the US Fire Marshal in New South Wales is the powers granted under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 for Fire Brigade officers to inspect the fire safety of a building if requested by the owner or occupier of a building, when requested by the responsible council authority or if the fire brigade has received a written complaint about the fire safety of the building.

<text>The year 1725 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events.

==Astronomy==
* James Bradley first observes stellar aberration.
* John Flamsteed&#x27;s &quot;Historia Coelestis Britannica&quot; is published posthumously in a version containing Flamsteed&#x27;s revisions, thanks largely to the efforts of his widow, Margaret, and former assistants Abraham Sharp and Joseph Crosthwaite.

==History of science==
* John Freind (physician) begins publication of &quot;The History of Physick, from the time of Galen to the beginning of the 16th century, chiefly with regard to practice&quot;, the first comprehensive history of medicine in English.

==Mathematics==
* The binary numeral system is invented by Basile Bouchon.
* The construction of a 4x4 Graeco-Latin square is published as a puzzle involving playing cards by Jacques Ozanam in &quot;Recreation mathematiques et physiques&quot;, vol. IV.
* Pierre Varignon&#x27;s &quot;Nouvelle Méchanique ou Statique&quot;, published posthumously in Paris, includes recognizable planar dual graphs.

==Technology==
* Stereotype printing, a copying process, is developed by Scottish goldsmith William Ged. The concept later generates the word &quot;stereotyping&quot;.
* The ocular Harpsichord, or &quot;clavecin oculaire&quot;, comprising a 6-foot square frame above a normal harpsichord, is invented by the Jesuit mathematician and physicist Father Louis-Bertrand Castel. No illustrations of it remain.

==Births==
* February 4 – Dru Drury, English entomologist (died 1804)
* May 10 – John Hope, Scottish physician and botanist (died 1786)
* May 23 – Robert Bakewell, English agriculturalist and geneticist (died 1795)
* September 16 – Nicolas Desmarest, French naturalist (died 1815)

<doc id="438860" wikidata="Q7400" url="?curid=438860" title="Emperor Jianwen of Jin">
<text>Emperor Jianwen of Jin (; 320 – September 12, 372), personal name Sima Yu (), courtesy name Daowan (), was an emperor of the Eastern Jin dynasty in China. He was the younger brother of Emperor Ming and installed by military leader Huan Wen. Prior to taking the throne, he had served in important roles in the administrations of his grandnephews Emperor Mu, Emperor Ai, and Emperor Fei. Both in his service to his grandnephews and in his own reign as emperor, he is generally viewed as a weak-willed figure who showed enough wisdom to continue to survive and extend Jin rule, but whose effectiveness was also compromised by his over-dedication to philosophical discussions of Taoism and other related philosophies.

==Early life==
Sima Yu was born in 320, as the youngest son of Emperor Yuan, by his favorite concubine Consort Zheng Achun (). As Emperor Yuan&#x27;s wife Yu Mengmu () had died years earlier (in 312), and the mother of his oldest son Sima Shao the Crown Prince (later Emperor Ming), Lady Xun, had been forced to leave the palace due to Princess Yu&#x27;s jealousy while she was still alive, Consort Zheng was effectively the mistress of the palace, although she never carried the title of empress. On 14 March 322, Emperor Yuan created him the Prince of Langya—the same title that Emperor Yuan had earlier, which was therefore considered a special honor.

In January 323, Emperor Yuan died; in October 325, Yu&#x27;s half-brother Emperor Ming also died. In 326, Consort Zheng died, and because, as Prince of Langya, Sima Yu was not permitted by law to mourn his mother, he, at age six, requested another title by which he could. His nephew Emperor Cheng (Emperor Ming&#x27;s son), himself then a young child, permitted it, and created him the Prince of Kuaiji. As he grew in age, he was given a progression of higher and higher posts, although without actual power.

==During Emperor Mu&#x27;s reign==
In November 344, another nephew of Sima Yu, Emperor Kang (Emperor Cheng&#x27;s younger brother), died, and was succeeded by his infant son Emperor Mu. Emperor Mu&#x27;s mother Empress Dowager Chu became regent, but she largely followed the advice of prime minister He Chong (). As it was customary, at this point of Jin history, for there to be two prime ministers, He Chong recommended Empress Dowager Chu&#x27;s father Chu Pou (), who declined and recommended Sima Yu instead. He Chong and Sima Yu thus shared the prime minister responsibilities until He Chong&#x27;s death in 346. He Chong was replaced by Cai Mo.

In 347, after the ambitious general Huan Wen, without the imperial government&#x27;s approval, carried out a campaign against and destroyed Cheng Han, annexing Cheng Han territory to Jin, the imperial government became apprehensive that Huan would use this opportunity to take over. Sima Yu thus invited the official Yin Hao, who was considered able, to join him and Cai in making important decisions, to counter Huan&#x27;s influence. In 350, after Cai had repeatedly declined greater honor conferred him by the emperor, Yin accused Cai of disrespecting imperial authority and had him removed, seizing more power than he had before.

In 348, Sima Yu&#x27;s heir apparent Sima Daosheng (), who was described as careless and frivolous, was accused of unspecified crimes, and he was deposed and imprisoned, and died in imprisonment. Sima Yu&#x27;s wife and Sima Daosheng&#x27;s mother, Princess Wang Jianji (), also died in distress. (She might have also been imprisoned prior to her death) His other sons, one by Princess Wang and three by various concubines, died early, and he was left without an heir, and his concubines were not conceiving any more. He retained a magician to look at his concubines to see which one could conceive an heir, and the magician looked at all of them and opined that none was destined to give him an heir—but then he saw a dark-skinned maid who was working with textiles, who was derogatorily referred to as a Malay, named Li Lingrong, and he, in surprised, yelled out, &quot;She is the one!&quot; Sima Yu therefore took her as a concubine, and they had two sons: Sima Yao in 352 and Sima Daozi in 353. Sima Yao was subsequently named heir apparent.

Around the new year 352, Huan, impatient after his requests to advance north in light of Later Zhao&#x27;s collapse were being rebuffed by Sima Yu and Yin, who were concerned about his expanding power, and mobilized his troops and gestured as if he were about to attack the capital. Yin was shocked, and initially considered either resigning or send the imperial banner of peace (Zouyu Fan, 騶虞幡) to order Huan to stop. After advice from Wang Biaozhi (), however, he instead asked Sima Yu to write a carefully worded letter to Huan, persuading Huan to stop.

After Yin himself launched unsuccessful northern campaigns in 352 and 353—the latter at great loss of life and property—Huan submitted a petition accusing Yin of crimes. The imperial government, led by Sima Yu, felt compelled to depose Yin in 354. From that point on, Sima Yu became the sole prime minister, although he was often forced to submit to Huan&#x27;s wishes on important matters. Later in 354, Huan himself launched a campaign north against Former Qin, one of the successor states to Later Zhao, but after initial successes, he was forced to withdraw as he hesitated at attacking Former Qin&#x27;s capital Chang&#x27;an and ran out of food supplies.

In 358, Sima Yu offered to resign and return all authority to Emperor Mu. Emperor Mu declined.

In 361, Emperor Mu died without a son, and by order of Empress Dowager Chu, his cousin Sima Pi the Prince of Langya ascended the throne as Emperor Ai. Sima Yu continued in his post as prime minister.

==During Emperor Ai&#x27;s reign==
In 363, when Emperor Ai&#x27;s mother Princess Dowager Zhou died, Sima Yu served as regent for the three-month mourning period.

In 364, Emperor Ai, who was obsessed with immortality, was poisoned by pills given him by magicians, and he could not handle important affairs of state. Empress Dowager Chu again served as regent, but important decisions were made by Sima Yu and Huan Wen. In 365, with the Former Yan regent Murong Ke besieging the important city Luoyang, Sima Yu and Huan discussed launching a counterattack to relieve Luoyang, but when Emperor Ai died in spring 365, the plans were cancelled. Emperor Ai was succeeded by his brother Sima Yi the Prince of Langya, who took the throne as Emperor Fei. Sima Yu continued in his role as prime minister.

==During Emperor Fei&#x27;s reign==
In late 365, Emperor Fei offered the title Prince of Langya to Sima Yu and further created his heir apparent Sima Yao the Prince of Kuaiji. Sima Yu declined on his son&#x27;s behalf and further himself declined the title of Prince of Langya, continuing to refer to himself as the Prince of Kuaiji, and Emperor Fei did not insist on his taking the greater title.

In 369, after Huan Wen launched a major attack against Former Yan but suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of Murong Chui, he considered another way to showcase his power. He decided to depose Emperor Fei, and he spread false rumors that Emperor Fei was impotent and that his sons were actually sons of men that he favored (implying a homosexual relationship between him and those men). In winter 371, Huan forced Empress Dowager Chu to issue an edict deposing Emperor Fei and replacing him with Sima Yu, who took the throne with trepidation but felt he had no choice.

==Reign==
An immediate issue that Emperor Jianwen had to deal with upon taking the throne was Huan&#x27;s suspicions toward his older brother Sima Xi () the Prince of Wuling, whose interest in military matters made Huan concerned that he would oppose Huan. Huan therefore falsely accused him of plotting treason, and Emperor Jianwen agreed to remove Sima Xi from his posts. Subsequently, however, Huan manufactured evidence against Sima Xi and petitioned that he be put to death. Emperor Jianwen wrote to Huan, stating that he did not want to kill his brother—and that if he was forced to, he would instead yield the throne. Huan, not willing to risk a confrontation, settled for having Sima Xi and his sons demoted to commoner status and exiled.

In summer 372, Emperor Jianwen grew ill, and repeatedly tried to summon Huan to the capital—perhaps to offer him the throne—but Huan, concerned that it was a trap, continuously declined. Emperor Jianwen soon died, and was succeeded by his 10-year-old son Sima Yao, whom he created crown prince right before his death. As Huan himself died in early 373, the threats of a Huan usurpation dissipated, and Jin continued for several decades longer.

<text>The year 1890 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events, listed below.

==Biology==
* September 25 – Sequoia National Park created in the United States.
* October 1 – Yosemite National Park created in the United States.
* Walter Heape successfully breeds rabbits from fertilised ova transferred from the biological mother to the uterus of an animal of a different breed.
* Francis Galton announces a statistical demonstration of the uniqueness and classifiability of individual human fingerprints.
* Jacques Loeb publishes his first major work on tropism, &quot;Der Heliotropismus der Thiere und seine Uebereinstimmung mit dem Heliotropismus der Pflanzen&quot;.

* August 6 – At Auburn Prison in New York, William Kemmler becomes the first person to be executed in the AC electric chair.
* October 9 – The first brief flight of Clément Ader&#x27;s steam-powered fixed-wing aircraft &quot;Eole&quot; takes place in Satory, France. It flies uncontrolled approximately at a height of 20 cm, the first take-off of a powered airplane solely under its own power.
* Approximate date – British civil engineer Ernest William Moir invents the airlock while working in New York.
* Scottish American chemist William Morrison produces the first successful practical electric road vehicle in the United States.

<doc id="438868" wikidata="Q3338278" url="?curid=438868" title="Nephilim (role-playing game)">
<text>Nephilim is a role-playing game about powerful elemental entities reincarnating into human beings. The players take the roles of these beings as they adapt to their newly symbiotic existence and learn the secrets hidden behind veils of obscurity and mysticism, seeking the path toward enlightenment, Agartha. The game contains much symbolism, primarily related to the Hermetic tradition.

==History==

 was originally published in 1992 by the French company Multisim . The first edition used Chaosium Basic Role-Playing, and in 1994 was translated into English by Chaosium as well, with some additional research and writings by Kenneth Hite.

Since then, &quot;Nephilim&quot; had three other editions (all three in French, from Multisim/) - the second edition was still akin to the BRP system while the third edition, &quot;Nephilim : La Révélation&quot; (The Revelation) uses a radically different, descriptor-based, system. It also introduces Ar-Kaïm and intuitive magic in the style of &quot;&quot; (although based on elements and words instead of spheres). The fourth edition has its own unique system as well, using a scale ranging from 1 to 25 and difficulty multipliers to obtain percentages. Its core book as for the first two editions is centered on Nephilim. The fifth edition, called Nephilim Légende (Nephilim Legend) was released in 2019 by Mnémos following a crowdfunding campaign on the Ulule platform. It brings a new system, based on a scale from 1 to 10, that is then multiplied by 10 to obtain a percentage. This new edition update the settings to the context of the late 2010s, re-published after update some older and unavailable sourcebooks as well as adding some new materials, like the Golden fleece campaign.

==Setting==

&quot;Nephilim&quot; is a game based on the idea that since ancient times there have been spirits without bodies who, given the right circumstances, can take over the body of a human and use it until it dies, then try to find another body. These spirits are the Nephilim.

Players get to choose one of five types of Nephilim. Within each of these types are different species of Nephilim. Each type of element or &quot;Ka&quot; has different strong points. Fire Nephilim (Pyrim) tend to be aggressive, Earth Nephilim (Faërim) are caretakers and healers, Air Nephilim (Éolim) are intellectuals, Water Nephilim (Hydrim) relate to change and movement and Moon Nephilim (Onirim) are secretive and manipulative. They are also defined by the major Arcana they choose to follow.

The spirit of the Nephilim takes over the body of a human and tries to gain the skills and knowledge the human has, while avoiding the Immortals&#x27; enemies. The Nephilim&#x27;s ultimate goal is to attain Agartha, a form of spiritual illumination. Other races have a similar goal.

&quot;Nephilim&quot; can be set in any times from ancient Egypt to present day or the future.

Besides the Nephilim, the players can play Selenim (&quot;Vampires&quot; of the Dark Moon, an element created by an ancient race that is unstable and corrupts Nephilim) or Ar-Kaïm (Astrological unstable mutants, introduced in the Third Edition).

Several human secret organizations know of the existence of the Nephilim. Most of these organizations oppose or hunt the Nephilim, but some are sympathetic to their cause. The Knights Templar is one of the primary sources of antagonists for Nephilim, who along with the Rosicrucians supply the most organized opposition. The Order of the Black Star possess many magical secrets, but are fewer in numbers and less likely to team up against Nephilim.

==Game mechanics==

The English language edition of &quot;Nephilim&quot; uses the Basic Role-Playing system used in many other Chaosium products, such as &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot;, &quot;Pendragon&quot; and &quot;RuneQuest&quot;. It is expanded to suit the setting, amongst other things each nephilim has a set of elemental attributes influencing the body in which it resides.

==Published books==

==Reception==
Steve Perrin reviewed &quot;Nephilim&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #46 (Aug., 1994), rating it a 3.5 out of 5 and stated that &quot;&quot;Nephilim&quot; offers a whole other world of dread secrets tied into real occultism and elitism, as opposed to Lovecraft&#x27;s creation. The two games will probably cross-fertilize each other.&quot;

In Issue 13 of &quot;Arcane&quot;, Andy Butcher noted that &quot;Nephilim&quot; gamemasters have to work very hard to prepare the game for play since the original rulebook did not contain a lot of information about running adventures. In reviewing the &quot;Nephilim Gamemaster&#x27;s Companion&quot;, Butcher gave it a rating of 7 out of 10, calling it &quot;a handy book for any struggling Nephilim referee, although you can&#x27;t help thinking that some of this material would have been better off in the main rulebook.&quot;

<text>Invergordon Football Club are a senior football club from Invergordon in the Scottish Highlands. They compete in the North Caledonian Football League and play at the Recreation Grounds.

== Origins ==
Although the exact year the club was formed is unknown, the first mentions of an Invergordon Football Club are made in local newspapers around 1870. Invergordon were founder members of the Ross-shire Junior FA in 1894 and first competed for silverware for the Ross-shire Junior Cup in 1895.

They remained regular competitors in the Ross-shire Junior ranks either side of the First World War.

== Post-War History ==
Invergordon joined the North of Scotland Junior FA (later renamed to the North Caledonian League) immediately after the Second World War, winning the league championship in their first season. By the 1950s, they had attained full membership and have remained members of the league (with the exception of a handful of seasons) since that time.

In June 2022, following their North Caledonian League victory, it was announced that they would be making their debut appearance in the Scottish Cup preliminary round, being the first North Caledonian League side other than Golspie Sutherland to get the chance to participate in the trophy, losing 5–1 at the Global Energy Stadium to Newtongrange Star.

== Ground ==
The club&#x27;s original ground was the old &quot;Blackpark&quot; (now part of Invergordon Distillery), before they moved to their current playing field at the town&#x27;s Recreation Grounds.

In January 2025, the club applied for planning permission to upgrade the ground, including building a stand, floodlights, dugouts and a fence.

== Club colours ==
Invergordon were originally known as the &quot;Maroons&quot; with their first kit donated by Plymouth Argyle. Their colours have been changed on several occasions before settling on yellow and royal blue for a number of years. In 2016, the club adopted new club colours of white and blue.

== Scottish Cup record ==
Following the conclusion of the 2020–21 season, it was decided that the winners of the North Caledonian League would earn the ability to play in the Scottish Cup regardless of SFA Licencing starting in season 2021–22. Invergordon were the first to achieve this feat, having narrowly beaten Loch Ness to the title, they again achieved this feat in the 2023–24 season, again, narrowly beating Loch Ness.

<doc id="438891" wikidata="Q385970" url="?curid=438891" title="Apache Ant">
<text>Apache Ant is a software tool for automating software build processes for Java applications which originated from the Apache Tomcat project in early 2000 as a replacement for the Make build tool of Unix. It is similar to Make, but is implemented using the Java language and requires the Java platform. Unlike Make, which uses the Makefile format, Ant uses XML to describe the code build process and its dependencies.

Released under an Apache License by the Apache Software Foundation, Ant is an open-source project.

==History==
Ant (&quot;Another Neat Tool&quot;) was conceived by James Duncan Davidson while preparing Sun Microsystems&#x27;s reference JSP and Servlet engine, later Apache Tomcat, for release as open-source. A proprietary version of Make was used to build it on the Solaris platform, but in the open-source world, there was no way of controlling which platform was used to build Tomcat; so Ant was created as a simple platform-independent tool to build Tomcat from directives in an XML &quot;build file&quot;. Ant (version 1.1) was officially released as a stand-alone product on July 19, 2000.

Several proposals for an Ant version 2 have been made, such as AntEater by James Duncan Davidson, Myrmidon by Peter Donald and Mutant by Conor MacNeill, none of which were able to find large acceptance with the developer community.

At one time (2002), Ant was the build tool used by most Java development projects. For example, most open source Java developers included codice_1 files with their distribution. Because Ant made it trivial to integrate JUnit tests with the build process, Ant allowed developers to adopt test-driven development and extreme programming.

In 2004 Apache created a new tool with a similar purpose called Maven. 

Gradle, which is similar software, was created in 2008, which in contrary uses Groovy (and a few other languages) code instead of XML.

==Extensions==
WOProject-Ant is just one of many examples of a task extension written for Ant. These extensions are installed by copying their codice_2 files into ant&#x27;s codice_3 directory. Once this is done, these task extensions can be invoked directly in the typical codice_1 file. The WOProject extensions allow WebObjects developers to use ant in building their frameworks and apps, instead of using Apple&#x27;s Xcode suite.

codice_5 provides a collection of tasks such as conditional statements and operations on properties as well as other useful tasks.

codice_6 implements tasks and types for networking, Swing user interfaces, JSON processing and other.

Other task extensions exist for Perforce, .NET Framework, EJB, and filesystem manipulations.

==Example==
A sample codice_1 file is listed below for a simple Java &quot;Hello, world&quot; application. It defines four targets - codice_8, codice_9, codice_10 and codice_11 , each of which has an associated description. The codice_11 target lists the codice_10 target as a dependency. This tells Ant that before it can start the codice_11 target it must first complete the codice_10 target.
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;project name=&quot;Hello&quot; default=&quot;compile&quot;&gt;
 &lt;target name=&quot;clean&quot; description=&quot;remove intermediate files&quot;&gt;
 &lt;delete dir=&quot;classes&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;
 &lt;target name=&quot;clobber&quot; depends=&quot;clean&quot; description=&quot;remove all artifact files&quot;&gt;
 &lt;delete file=&quot;hello.jar&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;
 &lt;target name=&quot;compile&quot; description=&quot;compile the Java source code to class files&quot;&gt;
 &lt;mkdir dir=&quot;classes&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;javac srcdir=&quot;.&quot; destdir=&quot;classes&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;
 &lt;target name=&quot;jar&quot; depends=&quot;compile&quot; description=&quot;create a Jar file for the application&quot;&gt;
 &lt;jar destfile=&quot;hello.jar&quot;&gt;
 &lt;fileset dir=&quot;classes&quot; includes=&quot;**/*.class&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;manifest&gt;
 &lt;attribute name=&quot;Main-Class&quot; value=&quot;HelloProgram&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/manifest&gt;
 &lt;/jar&gt;
 &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
Within each target are the actions that Ant must take to build that target; these are performed using built-in tasks. For example, to build the codice_16 target Ant must first create a directory called codice_17 (which Ant will do only if it does not already exist) and then invoke the Java compiler. Therefore, the tasks used are codice_18 and codice_19. These perform a similar task to the command-line utilities of the same name.

Another task used in this example is named codice_11:
&lt;jar destfile=&quot;hello.jar&quot;&gt;
This Ant task has the same name as the common Java command-line utility, JAR, but is really a call to the Ant program&#x27;s built-in JAR/ZIP file support. This detail is not relevant to most end users, who just get the JAR they wanted, with the files they asked for.

Many Ant tasks delegate their work to external programs, either native or Java. They use Ant&#x27;s own and tasks to set up the command lines, and handle all the details of mapping from information in the build file to the program&#x27;s arguments and interpreting the return value. Users can see which tasks do this (e.g. , , , ), by trying to execute the task on a system without the underlying program on the path, or without a full Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

==Portability==
Ant is intended to work with all systems for which Java runtimes are available. It is most commonly used with Windows, Linux, macOS and other Unix operating systems but has also been used on other platforms such as OS/2, OpenVMS, Solaris, HP-UX.

Ant was designed to be more portable than Make. Compared to Make, Ant uses less platform-specific shell commands. Ant provides built-in functionality that is designed to behave the same on all platforms. For example, in the sample codice_1 file above, the &quot;clean&quot; target deletes the codice_17 directory and everything in it. In a Makefile this would typically be done with the command:
 rm -rf classes/
codice_23 is a Unix-specific command unavailable in some other environments. Microsoft Windows, for example, would use:
 rmdir /S /Q classes
In an Ant build file the same goal would be accomplished using a built-in command:

 &lt;delete dir=&quot;classes&quot;/&gt;
Additionally, Ant does not differentiate between forward slash or backslash for directories and semicolon or colon for path separators. It converts each to the symbol appropriate to the platform on which it executes.

==Limitations==
*Ant build files, which are written in XML, can be complex and verbose, as they are hierarchical, partly ordered, and pervasively cross-linked. This complexity can be a barrier to learning. The build files of large or complex projects can become unmanageably large. Good design and modularization of build files can improve readability but not necessarily reduce size. 
*Many of the older tasks, such as , and —use default values for options that are not consistent with more recent versions of the tasks. Changing those defaults would break existing Ant scripts.
*When expanding properties in a string or text element, undefined properties are not raised as an error, but left as an unexpanded reference (e.g. codice_24).
*Ant has limited fault handling rules.
*Lazy property evaluation is not supported. For instance, when working within an Antcontrib loop, a property cannot be re-evaluated for a sub-value which may be part of the iteration. (Some third-party extensions facilitate a workaround; AntXtras flow-control tasksets do provide for cursor redefinition for loops.)
*In makefiles, any rule to create one file type from another can be written inline within the makefile. For example, one may transform a document into some other format by using rules to execute another tool. Creating a similar task in Ant is more complex: a separate task must be written in Java and included with the Ant build file in order to handle the same type of functionality. However, this separation can enhance the readability of the Ant script by hiding some of the details of how a task is executed on different platforms.

There exist third-party Ant extensions (called &quot;antlibs&quot;) that provide much of the missing functionality. Also, the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) can build and execute Ant scripts, while the NetBeans IDE uses Ant for its internal build system. As both these IDEs are very popular development platforms, they can simplify Ant use significantly. (As a bonus, Ant scripts generated by NetBeans can be used outside that IDE as standalone scripts.)

<text>Seiyun (also transliterated as &quot;Saywun&quot;, &quot;Sayoun&quot; or &quot;Say&#x27;un&quot;;   , ) is a city in the region and Governorate of Hadhramaut in Yemen. It is located in the middle of the Hadhramaut Valley, about from Mukalla, the capital of Mukalla District and the largest city in the area, via western route. It is from Shibam and from Tarim, the other large cities in the valley.

It is said that the origin of the city was a resting point for travellers. There was a café with a woman named Seiyun there, and the area was named after her in her honor. Since then, the city has become the largest area of Hadhramaut valley. Prominent villages surrounding the city include Madurah, Mérida, Burr, Hazkir, and Houta Sultana.

It is served by Seiyun Airport. It is also well known for the Seiyun Palace of the Sultan of Kathiri built in the 1920s with mud and stones. It oversees the marketplace for merchants coming from outside.

==History==
Seiyun is first mentioned in the beginning of the 4th century, during the reign of King Dhamar who ruled the area around Hadhramaut Valley at the time and was known for destroying 60,000 columns in the area. Destruction of the columns confirms that the Hadhramaut region was undergoing an economic prosperity owing to the spread of grape cultivation in large areas under the climatic conditions different from the current ones.

Seiyun during the Islamic period emerged as a village in the era of the Rashidun Caliphate. It was administratively part of the city of Tarim. This was the case during the Umayyad period as well. In 708, it became administratively affiliated with the city of Shibam. The son of Haritha led the revolution in 1179 but it gained its autonomy only in the year 1501 when it became the capital of the valley in the era of Badr Abu Tuwairq (1501-1556), where an administrative unit consisting of a sultanate that extended from Ain Ba to the west of the city of Dhofar was founded. In the 18th-century, Yafa conquered the cities of Hadhramaut and took over many parts of Seiyun, where the state was established. In 1852, it became the capital of the State of Kathiri (Aden-Kathiri) which was within the British Aden Protectorate (1869 - 1963). Its fortified fortress, the Sultan&#x27;s Palace, was the seat of Sultan al-Kathiri. Postage stamps from the Sultanate were sometimes inscribed &quot;Kathiri State of Seiyun.&quot; After the independence from British colonialism, Seiyun became the capital of the Southern district in the fifth province of Hadhramaut.

== Geography ==
Sayun District covers an area of approximately 804 square kilometers. It is located in the central part of Hadramaut Governorate and Wadi Hadramaut, at a latitude of 15.57° North and a longitude of 48.46° East. It is bordered by the districts of Tarim and Sah, to the south, Tarim and Al-Quf to the north, Tarim to the east, and Shibam to the west. Sayun is situated 320 kilometers from the governorate&#x27;s capital, Al Mukalla.

The terrain consists of a relatively flat plain, part of the Wadi Hadramaut, surrounded by mountain ranges on the northern and southern sides, leading to the northern and southern plateaus. Several sub-valleys of Wadi Hadramaut pass through these mountain ranges, including Wadi Shuhuh, Wadi Jathmah, and Wadi Bin Salman in Tarim, and Wadi Mudar in Bur.

==Climate==
The climate is tropical with a high temperature in the summer (26 - 42 °C) and a mild temperature in the winter (6 - 28 °C). Rain is rare and usually falls from mid-spring until autumn.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2004 census projections, the population of Sayun District was approximately 111,728 people. The population density was estimated at around 139 people per square kilometer. The residential areas are concentrated in the city and its suburbs, as well as in areas like Taribah, Taris, Al-Gharfah, Wadi Bur, and Mudawwarah. Urban areas constitute approximately 47.4% of the population, while rural areas constitute 52.6%. Sayun District accounts for 10.9% of the total population of the governorate and 14.3% of the population in Wadi Hadramaut and the Desert.

== Architecture ==

As for its architectural development, it can be summarized as follows: In the 7th century AH, it was a small village located within the district of Shaharah - Al-Sahil. It then developed to include other buildings, and a wall was built around it during the reign of Sultan Badr Abi Tuwairq in the year 922 AH. This wall remained until the year 1347 AH.

Regarding the buildings, in the 7th century AH, they were confined to Shaharah - Al-Sahil until the 8th century AH. The cemetery of the city was established in the 7th century outside the city in the eastern direction. Taha ibn Umar later acquired a piece of land far from the city and built a mosque (Taha Mosque), but there were no other architectural features. In the 10th century AH, the urbanization expanded due to its status as the capital of the Kathiri Sultanate during the reign of Sultan Badr Abi Tuwairq (922-977 AH). In the year 1120 AH, Ali ibn Abdullah Al-Sqaf obtained a piece of desert land in the tribal district and built a mosque on it. The urbanization continued in the 14th century when Abu Bakr bin Salim Al-Saban acquired a piece of desert land in Wadi Jatham and built a mosque on it. The Seiyun Mosque was built in the 9th century AH to accommodate this development. In the 14th century, the mosque was rebuilt as a Friday mosque, and there are four mosques in Seiyun where Friday prayers are held: Al-Jami Mosque, Taha Mosque, Al-Qarn Mosque, and Basalam Mosque. The oldest of them is the Al-Jami Mosque in Seiyun, which was the only mosque where Friday prayers were held.

== City Landmarks ==
There are many ancient landmarks in Seiyun, the most prominent of which are:

=== Seiyun Museum Palace ===
The Kathiri Palace, also known as the &quot;Dawil Palace,&quot; is located in the center of Seiyun, making it one of the most prominent landmarks in the city and all of Hadhramaut. It is considered one of the most magnificent mud-brick architectural masterpieces.

This palace was initially established as the residence of the Sultan during the reign of Sultan Badr bin Abdullah bin Jafar Al Kathiri, famously known as &quot;Abu Tuwairq&quot; (922-977 AH). This indicates that the palace existed before the reign of Sultan Abu Tuwairq, who made it his official residence and added a mosque to it. He also renovated the palace and expanded it. The Sultan Abu Tuwairq, who emerged during a period of bloody conflicts that engulfed most of the territories of Hadhramaut, managed to occupy most of these territories, including Shahr.

In the year 1125 AH, Omar bin Jafar Al Kathiri renewed the construction of the palace. In 1272 AH, Ghalib bin Muhsin Al Kathiri arrived in Seiyun and made it the capital of his rule. He used the Dawil Palace as his ruling headquarters and renovated it. Later, his son Mansour bin Ghalib bin Muhsin Al Kathiri continued the construction of the palace in the period between 1355-1357 AH, adding adornments and making expansions, including the construction of the Al-Aqra, which is the entrance leading to the palace, and building a large hall in the façade and its surroundings. The palace remains in the same state until now.

Recently, part of the palace has been utilized as a museum, which was inaugurated in 1983. The museum houses ancient artifacts collected from various sites in Wadi Hadhramaut, including those excavated from the Ribat site. It also features sections dedicated to folk heritage and historical documents, including those related to the Kathiri Sultanate when Seiyun served as its capital. Additionally, part of the palace has been designated as an administration office for the Ministry of Culture. A theater was also built on the southeast side of the palace in 1982, accommodating over 5000 spectators.

=== Seiyun Olympic Stadium ===
Seiyun Olympic Stadium is one of the largest stadiums in Yemen and the largest in Hadhramaut, capable of accommodating over 35,000 spectators.

=== Qarat Al-Ar ===
Qarat Al-Ar houses an ancient fortress mentioned in the year 616 AH when it was cited by historians as the place where Sultan Abdullah bin Rashid Al Qahtani was imprisoned and killed. Later, the fortress was renewed in 855 AH during the reign of Sultan Badr bin Abdullah bin Ali Al Kathiri, who used it as a prison for sultans.

=== Hisn Al-Fals ===
Hisn Al-Fals is an ancient fortress mentioned initially by historians in the year 603 AH. Its age is estimated to be around 400 years, as it was built during the reign of Sultan Badr Bintuwaireq or the period that followed. It is situated on a hill in the center of Al-Qarn neighborhood in Seiyun and served as an advanced military fortress, with its edges meeting the extensions of the historical wall of Seiyun.
