<text>David Julian Winnick (born 26 June 1933) is a British Labour Party politician who served 42 years as a Member of Parliament (MP), for Walsall North between 1979 and 2017, he was also the MP for Croydon South from 1966 to 1970.

==Early life==
Born into a British Jewish family, Winnick was an advertising manager and a branch chairman of the Clerical and Administrative Workers Union.
He was a councillor from 1959 on Willesden Borough Council, then on the London Borough of Brent.

==Parliamentary career==
After unsuccessfully fighting Harwich in 1964, Winnick was elected in 1966 as the MP for Croydon South (now the area covered roughly by Croydon Central constituency), defeating incumbent Richard Thompson. He lost the seat to Thompson in 1970. After completing a diploma in social administration at the London School of Economics, he stood again unsuccessfully in Croydon Central in October 1974 and was returned for Walsall North in 1979.

Winnick is generally regarded as being on the left of the Labour Party and has a strong commitment to human rights. That commitment made him a strong voice in the House of Commons against both the Taliban and Saddam Hussein and he supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

He was a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary body from its formation in 1990, and British co-chair, 1997–2005.

On 9 November 2005, Winnick&#x27;s amendment to a government bill on detention of terrorist suspects without trial, proposing that the maximum period of detention should be 28 days rather than 90, passed in the House of Commons by 323 votes to 290, shortly after the government&#x27;s 90-day proposal was defeated by 322 to 291. This was Tony Blair&#x27;s first defeat in the House of Commons on a whipped vote, after serving nearly nine years as Prime Minister.

In January 2009, he urged the Communities Minister to deplore the fact that Richard Williamson, a British-born bishop and Holocaust denier, had been brought back into the fold by the Vatican.

Winnick played a prominent role in the campaign to force the resignation of the Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin. This followed controversy from May 2009 concerning MPs&#x27; disclosure of expenses.

At the 2010 general election, Walsall North was one of the most closely contested seats at the election, with Winnick being re-elected with a significantly reduced majority of 990 votes, compared to 6,640 votes at the previous election five years earlier. In 2015, however, Winnick gained a comfortable majority of 1,937, despite the Labour Party incurring a net loss of seats. In his victory speech, he criticised the way in which his Conservative opponent had conducted their election campaign.

In 2017 (again against the national trend) he was defeated by Conservative Party candidate Eddie Hughes by 2,601 votes.

==Personal life==
He married Bengisu Rona (having met when a student in London, later working at SOAS University of London from the 1980s) on 23 September 1968, in Istanbul. Later divorced.

<doc id="434988" wikidata="Q262573" url="?curid=434988" title="Dorothy Hamill">
<text>Dorothy Stuart Hamill (born July 26, 1956) is a retired American figure skater. She is the 1976 Olympic champion and 1976 World champion in ladies&#x27; singles.

==Early life==
Hamill was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Chalmers and Carol Hamill. Her father was a mechanical engineer. Shortly after her birth, her family moved to the Riverside neighborhood of Greenwich, Connecticut, where Hamill spent the rest of her childhood. She has two older siblings, a brother, Sandy, and a sister, Marcia.

Hamill started skating in early 1965 at the age of 8, taking weekly group lessons. She became more serious about the sport the next season, taking regular private lessons and passing her preliminary and first figure test before the seasonal rink closed in March. She would wake early in the morning to go to the rink for practice at 4:30 am. Hamill was first coached by Otto Gold and Gustave Lussi. Ice time was limited in her area, so she eventually began training at Sky Rink in New York City, staying overnight in the city with friends when possible. In the summers, Hamill trained in Lake Placid, New York, and later in Toronto with her coach at the time, Sonya Dunfield. During her career, her father would spend up to $20,000 a year on her skating expenses, including skating lessons, travel, living expenses, and costumes.

Until the spring of 1970, Hamill attended public schools in Riverside, but at that point she switched to a small school with flexible tutoring to accommodate her skating schedule. She attended and graduated from Colorado Academy high school.

==Career==
Hamill&#x27;s first national success came in 1969, when she won the novice ladies&#x27; title at the U.S. Championships at the age of 12. Later that spring, Hamill was invited to perform in Madison Square Garden with the exhibition tour (in later years known as Champions on Ice) that followed the 1969 World Figure Skating Championships. She placed second at the junior level at the 1970 Championships, and made her senior debut in 1971. The U.S. Figure Skating Association arranged for her to be coached by Carlo Fassi when she began to compete internationally.

Hamill was U.S. champion from 1974 to 1976. At the 1974 World Championships in Munich, Germany, she was in 3rd place after the compulsory figures and the short program. She was set to skate directly after the West German skater Gerti Schanderl, whose marks were booed while Hamill was already on the ice. Visibly upset, Hamill left the ice and burst into tears. After the crowd settled down, she returned to the ice and won the silver medal behind Christine Errath of East Germany.

Hamill competed with an injured right leg at the 1975 U.S. Championships. She said her leg was fine after receiving treatment for a pulled hamstring (earlier believed to be pulled ligaments) while training in Denver during the month before the 1975 World Championships. She won silver at Worlds in Colorado Springs, Colorado, behind Dianne de Leeuw of the Netherlands and ahead of Errath.

Hamill was disappointed by her performance at the 1976 U.S. Championships, admitting that she was outskated by Linda Fratianne because she had not trained properly. Immediately after the national championships, her coach Carlo Fassi left the U.S. to accompany his other star pupil, John Curry, to the European Championships, leaving Hamill coachless with the Olympics only a few weeks away. She began training with Peter Burrows instead. She was pleased with their work together and wanted to bring him to the Olympics as her coach of record. However, the USFSA refused her request, and she was reunited with Fassi for a brief period of training in Germany before the Olympics.

At the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, Hamill came in second in the figures and then won the short and long programs, taking the gold medal. She was the last single skater to win the Olympics without a triple jump. Hamill also won the 1976 World Championships, and then turned professional.

Hamill is credited with developing a new skating move, a camel spin that turns into a sit spin, which became known as the &quot;Hamill camel.&quot; The bobbed hairstyle that she wore during her Olympic performance was created by stylist Yusuke Suga and started a fad, known as the &quot;short and sassy&quot; look. Her eyeglasses with oversized frames also started a trend in the 1970s. The media dubbed her &quot;America&#x27;s sweetheart.&quot; Her skating style was considered &quot;athletic&quot; and was compared to the more artistic skating style of fellow skaters Peggy Fleming and Janet Lynn, although she was also praised for her elegant lines and carriage. According to figure skating writing and historian Ellyn Kestnbaum, Hamill, along with Lynn, &quot;evoked associations with natural, outdoorsy wholesomeness&quot;, due to their athleticism, speed, freedom of movement, and appearance, which Kestnbaum states were &quot;images that resonated with both conservative and feminist ideologies during the 1970s&quot;.

Hamill became the face of Clairol&#x27;s Short &amp; Sassy shampoo and conditioner. After her performance in the 1976 Olympics, which was viewed by millions globally, her iconic wedge haircut became a trend among women and girls. Ads for Short &amp; Sassy, both on TV and in print, highlighted Hamill&#x27;s lustrous dark hair as she gracefully glided on the ice.

Hamill was an Ice Capades headliner from 1977 to 1984. She was asked to join Ice Capades by Donna Atwood, who had been its star for years and who had eventually acquired financial control of the Ice Capades. Hamill was asked to be Atwood&#x27;s successor as its new star. After Ice Capades folded due to competition and changing tastes, Hamill and her husband bought the financially strapped company&#x27;s assets in 1993 in an effort to revive its earlier success, but they declared bankruptcy in 1994. It was sold to Pat Robertson&#x27;s International Family Entertainment, Inc. in 1995.

In 1993, the Associated Press released results of a national sports study showing that Hamill was statistically tied for first place with fellow Olympian Mary Lou Retton as the most popular athlete in America, ranking far ahead of other major sports stars such as Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Troy Aikman, Dan Marino, Wayne Gretzky, Joe Montana, Nolan Ryan, and 800 other athletes.

At 40, Hamill experienced debilitating chronic pain and was later diagnosed with osteoarthritis. Her condition responded well to medication and she was able to return to skating professionally.

Hamill has continued to skate in shows, including a regular principal role with Broadway on Ice. She was a special guest in the Brian Boitano–Barry Manilow skating extravaganza at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco in 2007.

In February 2013, it was revealed that Hamill would take part in the sixteenth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, partnering with Tristan MacManus. After only two dances, on March 26, 2013, she was forced to withdraw from the competition upon advice from her spine surgeon due to a severe strain on her lower back sustained during practice.

On March 3, 2017, Hamill was announced as one of 16 celebrities taking part in a cooking competition on the Food Network TV series &quot;Chopped&quot;. She was featured in the &quot;Star Power: Culinary Muscle&quot; episode, alongside former NFL player LaMarr Woodley, Olympic medalist fencer Mariel Zagunis, and UFC fighter Paige VanZant. Hamill was the third and last contestant to be eliminated, narrowly missing out on advancing to the final heat, losing to Paige VanZant in the final round.

==Personal life==
Hamill wrote an autobiography titled &quot;On and Off the Ice&quot;. She was married and divorced twice: to Dean Paul Martin (1982–1984), and then to Kenneth Forsythe (1987–1995), with whom she had a daughter named Alexandra. Hamill married her third husband, John MacColl, in 2009. Her second autobiography &quot;A Skating Life: My Story&quot;, was published in 2007.

For much of her adult life, Hamill has experienced chronic depression, which is controlled through medication and therapy. Her daughter also suffers from the condition. In 2008, Hamill announced that she was being treated for breast cancer.

Hamill was a mentor to 2010 U.S. national champion Rachael Flatt. Flatt, like Hamill, trained in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

<text>Philip James Woolas (born 11 December 1959) is a British environmental consultant, political lobbyist and former television producer and politician who served as Minister of State for Borders and Immigration from 2008 to 2010. A member of the Labour Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Oldham East and Saddleworth from 1997 to 2010.

Prior to being elected at the 1997 general election, Woolas was president of the National Union of Students (NUS), a producer for BBC programme &quot;Newsnight&quot; and a trade unionist at the GMB trade union. In November 2010, he was found to have breached the Representation of the People Act 1983 in the course of the 2010 general election. As a result, his victory of 103 votes at the election was declared void, he lost his seat in the House of Commons and he was barred from standing again at the subsequent by-election. He was also suspended from the Labour Party until January 2011, when his suspension was lifted.

==Early life==
Woolas was born in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, on 11 December 1959. He went to Nelson Grammar School and, after O levels, Nelson and Colne College. He received a BA in philosophy from the Victoria University of Manchester.

Woolas joined the Labour Party at the age of 16, and became involved in student politics through the Anti-Nazi League. Before becoming an MP, he was president of the National Union of Students from 1984 to 1986, a television producer for the BBC on &quot;Newsnight&quot; from 1988 to 1990 (where he became firm friends with fellow Manchester United supporter Michael Crick), producer at ITN&#x27;s &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; from 1990 to 1991 and head of communications at the GMB trade union from 1991 to 1997.

==Parliamentary career==
He first won his seat for Labour in the 1997 general election, having contested the predecessor Littleborough and Saddleworth seat at a by-election in 1995, which was marked by Labour&#x27;s particularly vicious and personal campaign, attacking the Liberal Democrat candidate, Chris Davies, as &quot;high on tax and soft on drugs&quot;. Peter Mandelson admitted in his autobiography that they had gone &quot;on the attack&quot;, writing &quot;After the campaign was over, not only our opponents but some in Labour would denounce our &#x27;negative&#x27; tactics in highlighting Lib Dem front-runner Chris Davies&#x27; support for higher taxes and a Royal Commission to liberalise drugs laws. For tactical reasons, I felt we had had little choice&quot;.

In 1999, Woolas became parliamentary private secretary to Lord Macdonald of Tradeston, a Transport Minister, and was made a whip in 2001.

In June 2003, he was appointed Deputy Leader of the House of Commons under the Government&#x27;s newly appointed Leader of the Commons, Peter Hain. During the May 2005 ministerial reshuffle, he also served briefly under Hain&#x27;s successor, Geoff Hoon.

Between the same reshuffle and June 2007, Woolas was Minister of State for Local Government at the Deputy Prime Minister&#x27;s Office and then the Department for Communities and Local Government, the 2006 successor to the DPMO. During 2005, Woolas was accused of evading parliamentary questions with regard to public calls for reform of the Local Government Ombudsman in 2005.

On 28 June 2007, he became Minister for the Environment at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (in the Brown ministry). He had responsibility for climate change, energy and sustainable development.

In October 2006, Woolas was involved in the United Kingdom debate over veils, particularly the case of Aishah Azmi, a Muslim teaching assistant who wore an Islamic veil in class.
In February 2008, he raised the question of inter-cousin marriage as a cause of the high incidence of disability within predominantly Pakistani culture. The debate was welcomed by Ann Cryer MP who cited incidences in her own constituency. This debate was still continuing in 2011.

Following the cabinet re-shuffle of 3 October 2008, Woolas was made Minister of State for Borders and Immigration at both the Home Office and HM Treasury.

In the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal of 2009, Phil Woolas reportedly claimed expenses for items not allowed under the rules. Woolas said the items were on a receipt he submitted under food claims, but were not claimed themselves, and threatened a newspaper with legal action. The Legge enquiry into MPs&#x27; expenses cleared Woolas.

In November 2008, Woolas attacked lawyers and charities working on behalf of asylum seekers, accusing them of undermining the law and &quot;playing the system&quot; by taking legal action.

In February 2010, following the accusations of bullying made against Gordon Brown and other members of the UK cabinet, Woolas was quoted as referring to the head of the National Bullying Helpline, Christine Pratt, as &quot;this prat of a woman&quot; in a radio interview.

===Gurkha veterans&#x27; resettlement rights===
In spring 2009, Woolas was involved in a controversy regarding the rights for Gurkhas to settle in the United Kingdom. On 24 April 2009, Woolas proposed a new settlement for Gurkhas who were discharged before 1997. According to &quot;The Economist&quot;:Veterans would be allowed to settle only if they met one or more conditions based on length of service, gallantry or related illness. Many of the requirements seemed designed to frustrate: for example, one way to qualify automatically was by soldiering for at least 20 years, though most rank-and-file Gurkhas serve for only 15. Another was to prove that a long-term medical condition was caused or worsened by active service; a tall order for those whose injuries were sustained decades ago.

These proposals later were denounced in a vote at the House of Commons, with many Labour MPs voting across party lines. Woolas was later confronted at the BBC Westminster studios by the actress Joanna Lumley, the face of the Gurkha Justice Campaign. After Ms Lumley pursued him around the studio, the pair held an impromptu press conference in which she pressured him into agreeing to further talks over the settlement rights of Gurkhas. On 21 May, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced that all Gurkha veterans who had served four years or more in the British Army before 1997 would be allowed to settle in Britain. Gurkhas serving after 1997 had been given UK settlement rights in 2004.

Woolas stated that cost was a prime consideration: &quot;Our estimate is £1.4 billion, and I remind the House that that would come from the defence budget.&quot; However, according to a Freedom of Information request, the only impact on the Defence budget has been £20,000 per year to set up and run the settlement office in Kathmandu.

===2010 Labour leadership election===
Woolas was re-elected in the 2010 general election, although the result would later be overturned by an election court. He gave his backing to close political ally David Miliband in the Labour leadership election and represented him at events throughout the country. &quot;The Times&quot; described Woolas as &quot;a campaign fixer for Mr Miliband&quot;. However, Woolas officially nominated Diane Abbott, at the request of Miliband. Woolas said, &quot;I nominated her as an act of pluralism. We thought it would send a strong signal that David will be an inclusive leader.&quot;

==2010 re-election and election court case==
In his 2010 re-election campaign, Woolas&#x27;s campaigning methods were heavily criticised by his Liberal Democrat opponents and the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK (MPACUK). Critics accused him, among other things, of &quot;inflaming racial tensions&quot; in an area that has already known race riots. Trevor Phillips, head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission and former Labour politician, described some of the language used in the party&#x27;s leaflets as &quot;not helpful.&quot;

Woolas and his agent, Joe Fitzpatrick, were also responsible for photo manipulation of images in his election addresses. In one case they manipulated an image to show his Liberal Democrat opponent Elwyn Watkins in front of armed police, allegedly to imply Watkins had been arrested. This was a composite image, consisting of a portrait of Watkins and a photograph of armed police patrolling London. The Metropolitan Police insignia was also airbrushed from a female officer&#x27;s jacket.

Woolas won the election and was returned to Parliament with a majority of 103 votes – down from 3,590.

Following the election of Ed Miliband as the Labour Party Leader, Woolas was reappointed to the immigration brief on the shadow front bench team. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; said it was a &quot;bizarre decision&quot; as Woolas had &quot;run one of the most disgraceful election campaigns in recent history&quot;.

===Election court case===

On 28 May 2010, Woolas&#x27;s Liberal Democrat opponent, Elwyn Watkins, issued an election petition against the result under section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which makes it illegal to make false statements of fact about a candidate. Watkins claimed that leaflets issued by Woolas falsely portrayed Watkins as taking unlawful foreign donations, and linked him to Islamist extremists.

During the court case, held in public at Saddleworth Civic Hall, a number of emails between Woolas and his campaign team emerged. In one, Woolas&#x27;s agent and former Labour councillor Joseph Fitzpatrick emailed Woolas and Steven Green, the MP&#x27;s campaign adviser, to say: &quot;Things are not going as well as I had hoped ... we need to think about our first attack leaflet.&quot; A reply from Fitzpatrick said: &quot;If we don’t get the white vote angry he&#x27;s gone.&quot;

During the course of the court case, both Woolas and Fitzpatrick were cautioned by the presiding judge in respect of possible criminal charges relating to election offences. The court hearing finished in September 2010. On 5 November 2010, the court ruled that Woolas breached section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, and ordered a fresh election for the seat to be held.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian 5/11&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement released through his lawyer, Woolas stated that &quot;this election petition raised fundamental issues about the freedom to question and criticise politicians&quot; and that it &quot;will inevitably chill political speech&quot;.

Woolas applied for a judicial review into the ruling, but as the Labour Party withdrew its support he had to finance it himself, and he started to ask for donations. The High Court rejected his request for a judicial review. Woolas launched a second judicial review, technically a renewed application for permission to seek judicial review, and was heard in person at the High Court on 16 November 2010. The judges&#x27; decision took longer than expected, with them saying that there were &quot;difficult questions to resolve&quot;.

Following the initial court result, Woolas received goodwill messages from former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown and from Cherie Blair, wife of former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair. Labour MP Graham Stringer (Blackley and Broughton) was vocally supportive and criticised Harman and the party for suspending Woolas.

A decision on this second request was published on 3 December 2010. Woolas was accompanied to court by the Labour Shadow Health Secretary John Healey. The court granted Woolas permission to bring judicial review and that review overturned one of the three breaches of the section 106 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 found by the Election Court. The other two breaches stood: &quot;this does not affect the certificate as the findings of an illegal practice in relation to the other two matters cannot be impugned&quot;. On leaving court, Woolas said, &quot;It is the end of the road – I am out.&quot; He lost his seat in the House of Commons A by-election to elect a new MP for his former seat was held on 13 January 2011, in which the new Labour candidate, Debbie Abrahams, defeated Elwyn Watkins.

After the review ruling, a Labour spokesman said, &quot;The Labour Party administratively suspended Phil Woolas after the original judgment of the election court. Following the conclusion of this judicial review, the Labour Party will consider this issue in detail and whether further action is appropriate.&quot; Although the verdict of the election court indicated a &quot;prima facie&quot; breach of criminal law, in March 2011 the Crown Prosecution Service announced that it would not bring criminal charges against Woolas as the finding of the Election Court already disqualified him from holding elected office and they felt that this was sufficient punishment. The CPS also declined to prosecute Joseph Fitzpatrick, although as election agent he was responsible for the items deemed to have broken the law; he later stood unsuccessfully in Oldham as a council candidate for UKIP.

==After Parliament==
Woolas is a director of two organisations – Boothwood Partners, an environmental consultancy, and Wellington Street Partners, a political lobbying partnership originally formed with former MPs Paul Keetch (Liberal Democrat) and Sir Sydney Chapman (Conservative).

==Personal life==
Woolas is married to events organiser and ex-lobbyist Tracey Jane Allen, former co-director of lobbying firm Morgan Allen Moore.

<doc id="434992" wikidata="Q6242279" url="?curid=434992" title="John Wilkinson (British politician)">
<text>John Arbuthnot Du Cane Wilkinson (23 September 1940 – 1 March 2014) was a British Conservative politician. He was the MP for Bradford West from 1970 to 1974, and for Ruislip-Northwood from 1979 to 2005.

==Early life==
Wilkinson was born in Slough on 23 September 1940. He was educated at Eton College, the Royal Air Force College Cranwell, and Churchill College, Cambridge.

==Electoral history==
He was the member of parliament (MP) for Bradford West from 1970 until February 1974, when he was defeated by the Labour candidate Edward Lyons. He failed to regain the seat against Lyons in the following general election that same year.

In the 1979 general election he was elected as MP for Ruislip-Northwood, succeeding Petre Crowder, where he was re-elected in the successive general elections in 1983, 1987, 1992, 1997 and 2001.

Wilkinson did not stand in the May 2005 general election, and the succeeding MP for Ruislip-Northwood was fellow Conservative, Nick Hurd. By the time of his retirement, Wilkinson was one of the longest-serving Conservative MPs, having served 30 years in Parliament.

==Parliamentary career==
Wilkinson remained on the backbenches for most of his parliamentary career, apart from two brief periods as a Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS): to the Minister of State for Industry from 1979 to 1980 and to the Secretary of State for Defence from 1981 to 1982.

A former member of the Royal Air Force (RAF), he spoke frequently in debates on defence and from 1979 to 1990 he was a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of The Western European Union (WEU). He also served as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

Wilkinson was one of the Maastricht Rebels, from whom the Conservative whip was withdrawn when they voted against legislation to ratify the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. Wilkinson and the other rebels continued to oppose the European policy of Conservative Prime Minister John Major for much of the 1992–97 parliament.

Wilkinson maintained an interest in Ukraine dating back to his tenure as MP for Bradford West, which at the time had a large Ukrainian diaspora community, and he was a longtime advocate for Ukrainian independence and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In the 1983 book &quot;Alternative Approaches to British Defence Policy&quot; he argued for greater strengthening of British forces to respond to potential threats by the Eastern Bloc. He was president of the European Freedom Council, a group associated with the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations, and co-founded the British-Ukrainian All-Party Parliamentary Group following the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine. He publicly expressed support for the Orange Revolution and Ukraine&#x27;s accession to the European Union.

Wilkinson was additionally a supporter of Kosovar independence, and supported British involvement in the Kosovo War, although he criticised the government of Tony Blair for displaying &quot;weakness&quot; against the government of Yugoslavia in the conflict. He opposed the relocation of Kosovar refugees from the war to Ruislip, saying in May 1999 that the area already had a &quot;very substantial burden&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1969, Wilkinson married Paula Adey, with whom he had daughter; they divorced in 1987. Later that year, he married Cecilia &quot;Ceci&quot; Cienfuegos, who was from Chile; they had a son.

Wilkinson died on the Isle of Man on 1 March 2014.

<text>William Anthony Worthington (born 11 October 1941), known as Tony Worthington, is a retired politician in the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
He was brought up in Lincoln, attending the City School (a boys&#x27; grammar school) on Monks Road in Lincoln. He gained a BA in Sociology and Social Policy from the London School of Economics and a MEd from the University of Glasgow. From the University of York, he gained a PGCE, and then an Advanced PGCE from Durham University.

From 1962 to 1966 he was a lecturer in Social Policy and Sociology at HM Borstal, Dover, then at Monkwearmouth College of Further of Education (merged with Wearside College in 1996 to form the City of Sunderland College) from 1967 to 1971, then from 1971 to 1987 at Jordanhill College of Further Education in Glasgow. He was a councillor on Strathclyde council from 1974 to 1987.

==Parliamentary career==
In 1979, he tried to win the Labour nomination for the Strathclyde West seat in the European Parliament, but he came third at the selection meeting, behind Valerie Friel and John Carty.

He was Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) for Clydebank and Milngavie from 1987 until his retirement from Parliament in 2005.

In 2003, he voted against the Iraq War.

He was not replaced as the MP for Clydebank and Milngavie because constituency boundaries in Scotland were redrawn before the 2005 election. This was to bring the number of MPs per head of population in line with the ratio in England (Scotland had previously been over-represented).

He was awarded an honorary DSc by the University of Greenwich in July 2009.

==Personal life==
He married Angela May Oliver in 1966, and now has a son (Robert Worthington) and a daughter (Jennifer Warner, née Worthington). As a recent addition to his family, he now has three grandchildren: John Warner, Elizabeth Warner and Nicole Worthington.

<doc id="435000" wikidata="Q337556" url="?curid=435000" title="Tony Wright (Great Yarmouth MP)">
<text>Anthony David Wright (born 12 August 1954) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Great Yarmouth from 1997 until losing his seat at the 2010 election.

==Early life==
Wright attended to St George&#x27;s Infant School, Priory Junior School, and Hospital Secondary Modern School.

From 1970 to 1974, he was an engineering apprentice, then a mechanical engineer from 1974 to 1983. He worked originally with ErieElectronics, and then was subsequently employed at Brown and Root and Probe Oil Tools.

It was through his work as an engineer that he became involved in a trade union and entered politics.

==Political career==

In his political career, Tony Wright first stood for a Council seat in 1979 and missed out losing by 86 votes. He was subsequently voted in 1980 until 1982 when he lost by 15 votes. Tony Wright was then re-elected in 1986 and remained a Councillor until 1998.

In total he served fourteen years for Great Yarmouth Borough Council and was chairman of various committees, Deputy Leader for four years and Leader of the council for over two years from 1995 until 1997.

In addition, in 1983 Tony Wright was employed by Great Yarmouth Labour Party as full-time organiser up until the 1997 general election when he was elected as Member of Parliament for Great Yarmouth and retained his seat at both the 2001 and 2005 elections.

He is a member of Amicus and the GMB Union.

During his time in Parliament, Tony Wright sat on several committees including the Public Administration Committee and Trade and Industry Select Committee. He was active within many All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG&#x27;s), including chairing the APPG for Sea Cadets and acting as treasurer for the United Kingdom Parliamentary Football Club, which is itself attributed to a great deal of charity work.

Tony Wright lists among his main accomplishments during his parliamentary career as including the securing of Objective 2 status for Great Yarmouth, securing Assisted Area status helping to attract new investment to the area, the increase in funding to Great Yarmouth&#x27;s schools, police force and hospital and the introduction of SureStart services.

At the 2010 General Election. he lost his parliamentary seat to Conservative candidate Brandon Lewis with a swing over 9% against him.

After his defeat he has since stood for Norfolk County Council in the Gorleston-on-Sea St Andrews wards in both 2013, 2017, as well as at a 2015 by election finishing second each time.

In 2018 he was reelected to Great Yarmouth Borough Council in Nelson ward and was subsequently re-elected in 2019 and 2023.

==Controversy==

Wright found himself landed in controversy in June 2009 during the British MPs&#x27; expenses scandal when it emerged that he had accepted a £10,000 sweetener from the new owners of a rented accommodation in Dolphin Square, London SW1 on the understanding he accepted a £1,000 a month rent increase at the tax payers expense. He justified keeping the money by claiming &quot;he took a financial hit from having to work in London when he was first elected in 1997&quot; and highlighting how the money actually saved the tax payer £10,000 as it was not from the public purse.

Shortly after on 1 June, Wright issued a statement on this issue on his personal website:When I was first elected I decided not to purchase a property in London but to rent instead as it was not my priority to get into the &#x27;housing market&#x27; in order to make a potential &#x27;profit&#x27;. It was necessary however to have somewhere to stay in London whilst I was carrying out my parliamentary duties and for this reason, I rented. In the first few years the rent and other costs exceeded the allowance at that time but I met these extra costs personally. The lease ownership of this rented flat changed and as a result of this I received a payment from the new owners.

Wright was not asked to repay anything in the results of the Legg Report but later had to repay a duplicated claim of £3,050.

==Personal life==
Wright married Barbara “Babs” Marley on 13 August 1988 in Great Yarmouth. They have a son and daughter, and a step daughter. He supports Norwich City F.C.

<text>Birdsville is a rural town and locality in the Shire of Diamantina, Queensland, Australia. The locality is on the Queensland border with both the Northern Territory and South Australia. The town is situated north of the South Australian border. In the , the locality of Birdsville had a population of 110 people.

It is a popular tourist destination with many people using it as a starting point across the Simpson Desert.

Betoota is a ghost town to the east of the town of Birdsville within the bounds of the locality.().

== Geography ==

Birdsville is west of the state capital, Brisbane, from Charleville and south of the city of Mount Isa. Birdsville is on the edge of the Simpson Desert, approximately east of Poeppel Corner.

Birdsville is located about north-east of the Diamantina River in the Channel Country in the Lake Eyre drainage basin. Thundahpurty Waterhole is on the river in the east of the locality ().

The Birdsville Track extends from Marree in South Australia before ending at Birdsville; the road continues north as the Eyre Developmental Road to Bedourie. The Birdsville Developmental Road travels east from the town towards Windorah. A popular route across the Simpson Desert goes from Birdsville to Mt Dare via the French Line. The Line is an unsealed track built in the early 1960s by French Petroleum for oil exploration purposes.

Birdsville Airport is immediately north-west of the town (). It is operated by the Diamantina Shire Council.

Almost all the buildings in the town are of local sandstone, there being no local timber available. Distance and the lack of good access roads or a railway create prohibitively high transportation costs, so imported building materials are kept to a minimum.

Birdsville has the following mountains:

* Carloowattie Hill ()
* Grahams Bluff ()
* Louies Hill () 
* Mount Hal () 
* Mount Leonard ()
* Mount Lewis () 
* Mount Oakes () 
* One Tree Hill ()
* Pig Hill () 
* Square Hill () 
* Squaretop Hill () 

== History ==
Birdsville is located on land in the Channel Country of Central West Queensland, Australia. Before Birdsville was established by British settlers, the whole region was inhabited by indigenous Australians, speakers of the Wangkangurru language (also known as Arabana/Wangkangurru, Wangganguru, Wanggangurru or Wongkangurru), whose home range stretched from Birdsville south towards Innamincka and Lake Eyre, including the modern local government areas of the Shire of Diamantina as well as the Outback Communities Authority of South Australia&quot;.&quot;

Although British explorers had passed through the Diamantina district in the 1840s and early 1860s, pastoralists did not occupy this semi-arid region until the mid-1870s. Brothers Hector and Norman Wilson formed &quot;The Bluff&quot; property around the present site of Birdsville in 1875 as an outpost of their massive Coongy station across the border in South Australia. The Bluff property was also known as Salmonville. Nearby pastoral stations of Annandale, Pandie Pandie, Glengyle and Roseberth were taken up in 1876; and Carcoory in 1877.

Conflict in the region during this time included several large massacres of the resident Aboriginal people being perpetrated. For instance in 1879, Sub-Inspectors Henry Kaye and Henry Gough of the Native Police, together with troopers and stockmen from The Bluff and other properties, conducted a sweeping patrol for the perpetrators of the murder of a stockman. They came across two camps of Aboriginal people and dispersed them. A pastoralist on the nearby Warburton Creek reported to the Police Commissioner in Adelaide that 67 people were killed in these raids and that survivors from the violence had fled to his property.

There are a number of different theories as to the origin of the name &quot;Birdsville&quot;. One is that the name was suggested by Robert Frew, owner of Pandie Pandie Station, who also had a store and shop at the Diamantina Crossing, in reference to the prolific bird life in the district. The other is that a store was established by Percy Bird and George Field and they called it &quot;Birdfield&quot;. However, in 1882, G. and R. Wills, of Adelaide, misaddressed a consignment of goods as going to &quot;Birdsville&quot; and that name stuck. Another is that a man named Burt established a store and called it &quot;Burtsville&quot; which corrupted to &quot;Birdsville&quot;. Whatever its origin, by 1882, the name &quot;Birdsville&quot; was in common use. The name was adopted in the 1885 survey and was formalised at the proclamation of town in 1887.

In 1881, Hector and Norman Wilson, sold The Bluff (Salmonville) property for £19,000. Outside of their pastoral business, the brothers resided in Melbourne where they were the driving force behind the establishment of the Melbourne Racing Club, the Coongy Cup and the Caulfield Cup.

In the early 1880s the towns of Birdsville and Bedourie were established to service the newly taken up pastoral holdings of the Diamantina. Reputedly, a merchant named Matthew Flynn, who carried stores for the stations, built a rough depot in the late 1870s at the site of the present town of Birdsville, then known as the Diamantina Crossing, on the stock route from Boulia south to Adelaide. By mid-1885, when the township of Birdsville was officially surveyed, a number of buildings had been erected at the Diamantina Crossing, including a police lock-up (1883), Groth&#x27;s Royal Hotel (), William Blair&#x27;s Birdsville Hotel (), Curtain&#x27;s Tattersalls Hotel, and at least 3 stores and 1 shop.

When it was proclaimed, the town had three hotels, two stores, a customs house for interstate trade, a police station and a large collection of commercial buildings.

Diamantina Shire was established in 1883, and its headquarters were at Birdsville until moved to Bedourie in 1953. Birdsville Post Office opened on 1 January 1883.

Birdsville, over west of Brisbane and north of the Queensland-South Australian border, developed as an administrative centre for police and border customs. Birdsville is located at the border of South Australia and Queensland to collect tolls from the droves of cattle being moved interstate. Nearly all the trade of the town was with Adelaide, and it became an important marshalling point for cattle being driven south to markets in South Australia. By 1889 the population of Birdsville was 110, and the town had 2 general stores, 3 hotels, a police station, school, 2 blacksmith shops, 2 bakers, a cordial manufacturer, bootmaker, saddler, auctioneer &amp; commission agent, and a number of residences. The population peaked in 1895 at 220.

Birdsville State School opened on 14 August 1899. The school closed in 1948 and has subsequently reopened.

Circa 1900, Birdsville had a population of over 300. It had three hotels, a cordial factory, blacksmith store, market gardens, police and customs facilities but after Federation in 1901, the tolls were abolished and the town fell into decline to about 50 people throughout the 1950s. Livestock trade kept the region alive and since then tourism has joined cattle as the major industry in the area.

Tom Kruse operated the Birdsville Track mail run from 1936 to 1957, driving his Leyland Badger truck. He delivered mail and other supplies including general stores, fuel and medicine to remote stations from Marree in north-west South Australia to Birdsville, some away. Each trip would take two weeks and Kruse regularly had to manage break-downs, flooding creeks and rivers, and getting bogged in desert dunes.

In 2007, there was just one hotel serving canned or bottled beer, a library, a visitor information centre, a museum and a hospital.

Water is extracted from bore drilled in 1961 on the Great Artesian Basin at and is used to heat the operating fluid isopentane in a Rankine Cycle engine. The geothermal plant produces around one third of the town&#x27;s electricity. The water (once cooled) is also the source of the town&#x27;s drinking water. A plan by Ergon Energy to expand the 80 kW power plant to completely meet Birdsville&#x27;s electricity requirements was shelved, in favour of increasing the use of solar power and battery storage.

Birdsville has recorded the highest confirmed temperature in the state of Queensland, with having been recorded on 24 December 1972.
== Birdsville disease ==
Birdsville disease is an illness observed in horses, caused by eating the native plant Birdsville indigo (&quot;Indigofera linnaei&quot;) which contains natural toxins including the neurotoxin 3 nitropropionic acid (3-NPA). The affected horses exhibit weakness and lack of coordination; it can be fatal. It does not appear to affect cattle. Although it is not unique to Birdsville, the condition was first observed in the Birdsville district in May 1886. While there were many theories about the cause of the disease including plants, worms and sunstroke, it was not until 1950 that researchers identified the precise cause. Mildly affected horses can recover with a regimen of drenching with gelatine and feeding a diet high in arginine but euthanasia is recommended for severely affected horses. As there is no cure, preventing horses from grazing on indigo is recommended.

<doc id="435009" wikidata="Q65122099" url="?curid=435009" title="Tiger eye">
<text>Tiger eye or goat eye is a gene causing diluted eye color in horses. There are two variants, Tiger-eye 1 (TE1) and Tiger-eye 2 (TE2), which are both recessive. Horses displaying tiger eye typically have a yellow, orange, or amber iris. Tiger eye has only been found in Puerto Rican Paso Fino horses. Horses of related breeds were tested (90 Colombian Pasos, 20 Mangalargas, 44 Lusitanos, and 42 Andalusian horses), and none were found to have either tiger eye allele. No obvious link between eye shade and coat color was seen, making this the first studied gene in horses to affect eye color but not coat color. Tiger eye does not appear to affect vision, and there were no signs of reduced pigment on the retina or retinal pigment epithelium.

==Genotypes==
* TE1/TE1 or TE1/TE2: Yellow, amber, or bright orange eyes.
* TE2/TE2: Blue eyes when in combination with cream. It is not known what this looks like without cream. Only one horse has been tested to carry this genotype.
* TE1/n, TE2/n, or n/n: Dark eyes.

==Molecular genetics==
The gene involved codes for SLC24A5, a solute carrier known to be involved in pigmentation in other species. &quot;SLC24A5&quot; is found on equine chromosome 1 base pairs 141,657,837–141,678,329 and the protein is a potassium-dependent sodium–calcium ion exchanger involved in melanocyte maturation. The protein is believed to be located in the &quot;trans&quot;-golgi network of melanocytes. Tiger-eye 1 is a missense mutation (c.272A&gt;T and p.Phe91Tyr) in which a single adenine is replaced with a thymine in exon 2, changing a phenylalanine to a tyrosine in the resulting protein. Tiger-eye 2 is a deletion (c.875-340_1081+82del) in which the entirety of exon 7, and a bit of the introns on either side, are removed, resulting in a protein that is 69 amino acids shorter. Both mutations are predicted to be deleterious to protein function.

Another mutation at this same gene is associated with the shade of black horses. One variant is mainly found in jet black horses, while the other variant is mainly found in fading black horses. However, the association is not perfect and there are probably other mutations that can also cause the fading black appearance.

==In other species==
SLC24A5 is involved in pigmentation in humans, mice, and zebrafish. In mice a targeted mutation was found which diluted the eye color without visibly affecting coat color, though a closer examination found that the melanosomes were smaller and paler than the wild type. Unlike tiger eye in horses, the mice showed reduced pigment in the retinal pigment epithelium. In humans a widespread mutation to the homologous gene plays a large role in the light skin color of European humans, and another mutation can cause oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) type 6 (OCA6), which impairs vision. No vision impairment is seen in horses, and the coat color is not visibly affected.

<text>The Iowa caucuses are quadrennial electoral events for the Democratic and Republican parties in the U.S. state of Iowa. Unlike primary elections, where registered voters cast ballots at polling places on election day, Iowa caucuses are meetings where voters gather to discuss and select candidates for their registered party. Political parties hold the caucuses, in contrast to most state-run primaries. Both presidential and midterm elections in Iowa use caucuses. The caucuses are also held to select delegates to county conventions and party committees, among other party activities.

The Iowa caucuses are noteworthy as the first major contest of the United States presidential primary season. Although caucus-goers have been unrepresentative of the nation&#x27;s overall demographic, caucuses are still seen by some as a strong indicator of how a presidential candidate will do in later contests. Candidates who do poorly in the Iowa caucus frequently drop out in the following days.

The 2020 Iowa Republican caucuses and the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses 
took place on February 3, 2020. The Democratic caucus proved controversial after difficulties and errors in the reporting of the final vote totals. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price resigned on February 12, 2020, over the chaos resulting from the caucus.

On February 4, 2023, the Democratic National Committee approved a new calendar for the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries, moving the South Carolina Democratic primary to be held first on February 3, and pushing the Iowa Democratic caucuses later to March. The Republican National Committee still announced plans to hold the Iowa Republican caucuses first in the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries. By October 6, the Democratic National Committee reached a compromise in which the in-person Iowa Democratic caucuses focusing on party business could still be held in January, but voting on presidential candidates would be done via mail-in ballots until Super Tuesday, March 5.

==Background==
Political parties in Iowa have used caucuses to select party leaders and candidates for office since the 1800s. Before 1907, parties selected all candidates for political office through the caucus system. Iowa held a presidential primary in 1916, but returned to the caucus system in 1917 due to high costs and low participation.

After the 1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity, Democratic Party leaders decided to make changes to their presidential nomination process by spreading out the schedule in each state. Because Iowa had a complex process of precinct caucuses, county conventions, district conventions, and a state convention, they chose to start early. In 1972, Iowa was the first state to hold its Democratic caucus, and it had the first Republican caucus four years later.

Under Iowa law, political parties are required to hold caucuses every two years to select delegates to county conventions and party committees.

For Republicans, the Iowa caucus used to follow the Iowa Straw Poll in August of the preceding year. The Iowa Straw Poll was held six times, beginning in 1979, but only three Straw Poll winners went on to win the caucus the following year. The Straw Poll was discontinued in June 2015.

With an emphasis on retail politics, candidates have often pursued the &quot;full Grassley&quot; or Iowa 99, as they visit all of the counties of the state.

==Process==

The Iowa caucuses operate differently from the primary election used by most other states (see U.S. presidential primary). The caucuses are generally defined as &quot;gatherings of neighbors&quot;. Rather than going to polls and casting ballots, Iowans gather at a set location in each of Iowa&#x27;s precincts. Typically, these meetings occur in schools, churches, public libraries, or even individuals&#x27; houses. Caucuses are held every two years, during both the presidential and midterm election seasons, but those that receive national attention are the presidential preference caucuses, held every four years. The rules of the caucus process to determine delegates to national conventions are determined by the party and differ substantially between the Democratic and Republican parties.

In addition to the voting and the presidential preference choices, caucus-goers begin the process of writing their parties&#x27; platforms by introducing resolutions.

===Criticisms===
Public focus has been increasingly drawn to the Iowa caucus procedure. Public confidence in the integrity of the caucus system was heavily undermined after the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucus in which numerous irregularities were revealed, including disputed caucus totals following the use of a new smartphone app developed for the caucus, and a failure to publish official results for nearly a week.

Many political figures have also echoed concerns. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL): &quot;I think the Democratic caucus in Iowa is a quirky, quaint tradition which should come to an end. As we try to make voting easier for people across America, the Iowa caucus is the most painful situation we currently face for voting.&quot; Former presidential candidate Julián Castro, who has long been critical of the Iowa caucuses, blasted the process: &quot;It&#x27;s a mess. What we saw out there and heard about are, consistently, errors in the way that this process was done, whether in the initial phase or the realignment. Inconsistencies in how it was done across precinct sites, caucus sites. It is a total mess.&quot;

===Democratic Party===
Each precinct divides its delegate seats among the candidates in proportion to caucus goers&#x27; votes. Participants indicate their support for a particular candidate by standing in a designated area of the caucus site (forming a preference group). An area may also be designated for an &quot;uncommitted&quot; group. Participants may try to convince their neighbors to support their candidates. Each preference group might informally deputize a few members to recruit supporters from the other groups and, in particular, from among those undecided. Undecided participants might visit each preference group to ask its members about their candidate.

After some time, the electioneering is temporarily halted, and the supporters for each candidate (and for &quot;uncommitted&quot;) are counted. At this point, the caucus officials determine which candidates or groups are viable, potentially including the &quot;uncommitted&quot; group. Depending on the number of county delegates to be elected, the viability threshold is no less than 15% of attendees. &quot;(For four or more delegates, the threshold is 15%. For three delegates, the threshold is the total number of voters, divided by 6, roughly 16.66%. For two delegates, the threshold is 25%. For one delegate, there is no threshold, and the delegate is elected by a majority vote of eligible voters in attendance, following the first round of alignment.)&quot; For a candidate (or the &quot;uncommitted&quot; group) to earn any delegates from a particular precinct, the candidate or group must have the support of at least the percentage of participants required by the viability threshold. Once viability is determined, participants have an opportunity to realign: although supporters of viable candidates or groups are locked into their choice, the supporters of nonviable candidates or groups may find a viable candidate or group to support, join with supporters of another nonviable candidate or group to secure a delegate for one of the two, or abstain. This realignment is a distinction of caucuses in that (unlike in most primaries) a voter&#x27;s second choice can help a candidate.

When the voting is closed, a final headcount is conducted, and each precinct apportions delegates to the county convention. These numbers are reported to the state party, which counts the total number of delegates for each candidate (and delegates who are &quot;uncommitted&quot;) and reports the results to the media. Most of the participants go home, leaving a few to finish the business of the caucus: each preference group elects its delegates, and then the groups reconvene to elect local party officers and discuss the platform. The delegates are chosen by the precinct then go to a later caucus, the county convention, to choose delegates to the district convention and state convention. Most of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are selected at the district convention, with the remaining ones selected at the state convention. Delegates to each level of convention are initially bound to support their chosen candidate but can later switch in a process very similar to what occurs at the precinct level; however, as major shifts in delegate support are rare, the media declares the candidate with the most delegates on the precinct caucus night the winner and relatively little attention is paid to the later caucuses.

In 2014, the Iowa Democratic Party introduced changes to the caucus system to allow members of the military to participate in a statewide caucus and establish satellite caucuses for voters with disabilities and others who have trouble making it to the physical location of the caucuses. They will also work for the passage of a new law that requires employers to allow employees to take time off for the caucuses.

In 2016, the Iowa Democratic Party held the first-ever tele-caucus for members of the military serving outside Iowa and their families; Iowans in the Peace Corps and Diplomatic Corps; and students and Iowans living abroad. In addition, it held satellite caucuses in 2020, in an attempt to improve accessibility and participation in the Iowa caucuses. Starting in 2020, 10% of state convention delegates will be assigned through tele-caucuses.

Beginning with the 2020 caucus, the Iowa Democratic Party publishes not only &quot;State Delegate Equivalents&quot;, based on a calculation of likely delegate results after the state caucus is held, but also a statewide raw vote count after the first alignment round (including results for all non-viable candidates) and a statewide raw vote count for all viable candidates after the second alignment round.

===Republican Party===
The process of selecting Iowa delegates to the Republican National Convention prior to the 2016 election cycle started with the selection of delegates to the county conventions, which in turn affected the delegates elected to district conventions who also served as delegates to the state convention where delegates were chosen for the national convention.

This process rewarded candidate organizers who not only got supporters to the caucus sites but also got supporters willing to serve as delegates to county conventions and willing to vote for other delegates who supported a specific candidate. In 2012, this process resulted in Ron Paul supporters dominating the Iowa delegation to the Republican National Convention, having 22 of the 28 Iowa delegates, with Mitt Romney getting the other six delegates.

Because the delegates elected at the caucuses are not required to declare a candidate preference, the media does not always have a purely objective way to determine the success of individual candidates at the caucuses. The media focused on the secret ballot polling conducted at the caucus sites and have generally referred to this non-binding poll as the caucus. There were irregularities in the 2012 caucus site polling results, including the fact that eight precinct results went missing and were never counted.

Because of the irregularities in the process and the fact that the totals reported to the media were unrelated to the delegate selection process, there have been changes in both how the caucus site secret ballot polling is sent to state party headquarters and in how Iowa delegates to the national convention are required to vote.

Beginning with the 2012 presidential election, Iowa switched from the old winner-take-all allocation to proportional allocation. The change was made to prolong the race, giving lesser-known candidates a chance and making it harder for a frontrunner to secure the majority early. It was also hoped that this change in the election system would energize the base of the party.

Starting in 2016, caucus results have become binding when selecting delegates. Acting in accordance with a mandate from the Republican National Committee, the delegates are bound on the first ballot to vote for candidates in proportion to the votes cast for each candidate at the caucus sites.

==History==
Since 1972, the Iowa caucuses have had a 55% success rate at predicting which Democrat, and a 43% success rate at predicting which Republican, will go on to win the nomination of their political party for president at that party&#x27;s national convention.

=== 2004 ===

Since Republican President George W. Bush did not face any opposition in 2004, only Democratic caucuses were held. The meetings ran from 6:30 p.m. until approximately 7:00 p.m. on January 19, 2004, with a turnout of about 124,000 caucus-goers. The county convention occurred on March 13, the district convention on April 24, and the state convention on June 26. Delegates could and did change their votes based on further developments in the race; for instance, in 2004 the delegates pledged to Dick Gephardt, who left the race after the precinct caucuses, chose a different candidate to support at the county, district, and state level.

The number of delegates each candidate receives eventually determines how many state delegates from Iowa that candidate will have at the Democratic National Convention. Iowa sends 56 delegates to the DNC out of a total of 4,366.

Of the 45 delegates that were chosen through the caucus system, 29 were chosen at the district level. Ten delegates were at-large delegates, and six were &quot;party leader and elected official&quot; (PLEO) delegates; these were assigned at the state convention. There were also 11 other delegates, eight of whom were appointed from local Democratic National Committee members; two were PLEO delegates and one was elected at the state Democratic convention. John Kerry won the Iowa caucuses with 38% of the vote, John Edwards coming second.

===2008===


The 2008 Iowa Democratic caucuses and 2008 Iowa Republican caucuses took place January 3 at 7 p.m. CT. Candidates spent tens of millions of dollars on local television advertisements and hundreds of paid staff in dozens of field offices. Barack Obama (D) and Mike Huckabee (R) were the eventual winners.

===2012===

The 2012 Iowa caucuses took place on Tuesday, January 3, starting at 7 p.m. CST. Incumbent president Barack Obama only faced minor opposition in the Democratic caucus and received 98% of the vote, but the Republican caucus was heavily contested between several challengers. Initial results reported that Mitt Romney beat out Rick Santorum by just 8 votes, but when the final results came out two weeks later Rick Santorum secured the victory over Romney by a margin of 34 votes with Ron Paul in a strong 3rd. Results were certified by the Caucus, but not by the Republican party, who declared it a split decision due to missing reports from 8 precincts, but who later certified the caucus as a win for Santorum.
The caucus winner changed yet again when the Iowa delegate totals were finally determined giving Ron Paul the win along with several other states that same weekend.

===2016===

The 2016 Iowa caucuses took place on Monday, February 1. The counting started at 7 p.m. CST and lasted one hour, after the caucus discussions. For the first time, results were electronically sent to both Democratic and Republican headquarters.

In the Democratic caucus, Hillary Clinton received 45% of the vote and 23 pledged delegates, defeating Bernie Sanders, with 41% and 21 delegates. The Republican caucus awarded delegates to nine candidates: 8 to Ted Cruz, with 28% of the vote; 7 each to Donald Trump and Marco Rubio, with 24% and 23% respectively; 3 to Ben Carson, with 9%; and 1 delegate each to five other candidates.

===2020===
The 2020 Iowa caucuses occurred on Monday, February 3. The results of the 2020 Iowa Democratic caucus were delayed due to &quot;inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results,&quot; according to Mandy McClure, the party&#x27;s communications director. &quot;In addition to the tech systems being used to tabulate results, we are also using photos of results and a paper trail to validate that all results match and ensure that we have confidence and accuracy in the numbers we report. This is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion. The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.&quot;

Delays in reporting were attributed to the failure of a new reporting app for the Iowa Democratic Party presidential caucus, including an inability to download or launch the app as well as an inability for the app to function well once launched; the failure of the backup phone number system after too many people attempted to call the phone number due to the failing app; and confusion over the correct way to count and calculate the initial and final popular votes as well as state delegate equivalent values.

A complete official count of the first alignment popular vote, the second alignment popular vote, and state delegate equivalents was released on February 6, 3 days after Iowa Democrats voted. However, various outlets including &quot;The New York Times&quot; and NBC News reported logical inconsistencies in certain precincts (such as state delegate equivalents being awarded to the wrong candidates and more people voting for the second alignment than the first alignment). This led the Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez to request the state Democratic Party (which runs the caucuses) to &quot;recanvass&quot; or recalculate the results including state delegate equivalents.

The app in question was provided by a 5-month-old company, Shadow Inc., which failed to develop and test the product adequately. The CEO and founder, Tara McGowan, also founded the ACRONYM corporation in 2017 and Courier Newsroom in 2019. Her husband, Michael Halle, is a senior strategist to the campaign of Pete Buttigieg. Multiple unverified claims of the Buttigieg campaign funding the organization, having investment interests in, and even sharing partial ownership in either company have been made. However, the only verified transactions between the Buttigieg campaign and either entity is a contract for text and messages services. The Joe Biden campaign had also contracted with Shadow, Inc for the same services, as well as former candidate Kirsten Gillibrand. After the app failure, McGowan distanced herself and ACRONYM from Shadow Inc., stating that it was an &quot;independent&quot; entity. Both companies are founded and directed by McGowan and Halle, and they share the same registered address. While the corporation&#x27;s official website doesn&#x27;t officially name its members, data gathered from LinkedIn reveals that its top executives were all involved in one way or another with Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2016 election campaign. James Hickey (Shadow, Inc.&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer) and Krista Davis (its Chief Software Architect) were both vital to the digital aspect of her campaign.

===2024===

The 2024 Iowa Republican presidential caucuses were held on January 15, 2024, with 40 delegates to the 2024 Republican National Convention allocated on a proportional basis. The winner was Donald Trump, followed by Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley.

Iowa&#x27;s Democratic presidential caucuses had in-person gatherings on January 15 focusing only on party business. Voting on candidates will be done exclusively via mail-in ballots from January 12 until Super Tuesday, March 5, 2024. This was the result of a compromise between the Iowa Democratic Party and the Democratic National Committee. Iowa traditionally holds its race first during the presidential primary and caucuses season, but the DNC originally wanted South Carolina to instead hold its race first on February 3. 46 delegates to the Democratic National Convention will be allocated to presidential candidates.

<doc id="435015" wikidata="Q4007947" url="?curid=435015" title="The Blithedale Romance">
<text>The Blithedale Romance is a novel by American author Nathaniel Hawthorne published in 1852. It is the third major &quot;romance&quot;, as he called the form. Its setting is a utopian socialist farming commune based on Brook Farm, of which Hawthorne was a founding member and where he lived in 1841. The novel dramatizes the conflict between the commune&#x27;s ideals and the members&#x27; private desires and romantic rivalries.

==Plot summary==
Before moving to the communist community of Blithedale in the mid-1800s, Miles Coverdale is approached by Moodie (an apparent beggar) who asks for a favor. Though willing, Moodie eventually decides he will ask an older, more experienced man and departs. Miles leaves for Blithedale without his acquaintance Hollingsworth, who arrives later with Priscilla, a frail girl. They are welcomed by Mr. and Mrs. Silas Foster (a gruff, experienced farmer) and Zenobia, a charming woman who enchants Coverdale, Hollingsworth and Priscilla.

Coverdale becomes severely ill and is bedridden. During his sickness, he develops a closeness with Hollingsworth, who cares for him. Meanwhile, Hollingsworth also becomes close with Zenobia, and they plan to build a cottage together. Moodie approaches Coverdale in the fields one day and asks about Priscilla and Zenobia, but declines to see them when he hears they are good friends. During a walk, Coverdale encounters Westervelt, a man whom he immediately dislikes. He asks to see Zenobia, but only in a private way. Coverdale gives him some instruction but wonders about his motives. Coverdale later sees Westervelt walking with Zenobia and assumes them to be arguing about some past encounter.

Later, Zenobia theorizes that Priscilla, whose background is a mystery, may, in fact, be the Veiled Lady: a popular clairvoyant who recently stopped doing public shows. Afterwards, Coverdale, Hollingsworth, Zenobia and Priscilla meet at Eliot&#x27;s Pulpit, a rock they habitually visit. There they discuss women&#x27;s rights, and Zenobia sides with Hollingsworth (and against Coverdale) on a misogynistic point of view of women&#x27;s roles. As they leave the Pulpit, Coverdale witnesses a moment of affection between Zenobia and Hollingsworth. 

Coverdale and Hollingsworth&#x27;s disagreements intensify the next day when they discuss their hopes for the future of Blithedale - Hollingsworth, who devoted himself to criminal rehabilitation and hopes to establish a facility for that purpose on the farm. When Hollingsworth indicates that Coverdale is either &quot;with him or against him&quot; in this effort, Coverdale refuses to assist him and ends their friendship. Coverdale decides to seek respite from the tumultuous relationships at the farm and leaves for the city.

In the city, Coverdale looks out from his hotel window into a boarding house and thinks he sees Priscilla; in another room, he sees Zenobia and Westervelt. They see him, so he goes to visit. Zenobia confirms that Priscilla is there, but Westervelt indicates that they must leave, and take Priscilla with them. Suspicious, Coverdale seeks out Moodie. Moodie explains that his name used to be Fauntleroy, and he was a wealthy man. His first daughter was Zenobia. He fell into financial ruin and left her to be raised by his still-wealthy uncle (who died, leaving her considerable wealth). Later, he remarries a pauper woman, and fathers Priscilla. Her unusual ways gain the attention of a &quot;wizard,&quot; who has an odd relationship with her. He gets a message to Zenobia and entreats her to look out for Priscilla, but does not reveal that they are related.

Coverdale is shocked, proceeds to a show of the Veiled Lady, and recognizes Westervelt as the &quot;wizard.&quot; Hollingsworth is also in the audience. When Coverdale asks Hollingsworth where Priscilla is, he goes up on stage, removes the veil and takes her away. The three return to Blithedale immediately; Coverdale returns later. Upon his return, he dreads seeing the three and takes a circuitous path through the trees. There he witnesses the community dressed as witches, fairies and other creatures; when he laughs, they chase him and he runs toward Eliot&#x27;s Pulpit. There he finds his three companions; Zenobia indicates that he missed a &quot;trial&quot; conducted by Hollingsworth. She proceeds to accuse him of selfishness and heartlessness, and he angrily leaves with Priscilla, who follows him. Zenobia begins to weep.

When she recovers, she tells Coverdale that she will eventually get over it but will leave Blithedale. She says she will become a nun and asks Coverdale to tell Hollingsworth he &quot;murdered&quot; her. She leaves and Coverdale falls asleep under the rock. When he awakes at midnight, he proceeds to Hollingsworth&#x27;s cottage and asks for his help; Silas Foster also wakes up and is asked to help. Leading them to a familiar spot by the river and reflecting on her words, Coverdale reveals he believes Zenobia drowned herself. Hollingsworth hooks her body with a pole; Silas Foster observes that he left a physical wound near her heart.

Years later, Coverdale has become listless in life. He visits Hollingsworth, who is a broken man and has not accomplished anything in the way of his dreams of rehabilitation. Priscilla remains by his side, and Coverdale realizes the weight of Zenobia&#x27;s death ruined him. Coverdale had fallen in love with Priscilla and feels similarly hopeless.

==Major characters==
Miles Coverdale: The story&#x27;s protagonist and narrator, Coverdale is a simple observer of the activities of the Blithedale farm. However, his narrative occasionally exaggerates or becomes dreamlike and is not entirely trustworthy. At points in the novel, Coverdale seems to practice mild voyeurism. He is a professed supporter of women&#x27;s equality, as evidenced in an argument with Hollingsworth, although he also views Zenobia&#x27;s feminism as a symptom of romantic disillusionment. He is typically mild-mannered, though often strange and illogical. He is consistently curious about his surroundings, leading to his voyeurism and mostly unsupported speculations on his fellow residents. Though he seems to fancy Zenobia and certainly regards her as beautiful, in the last line of the story he confesses that he is truly in love with Priscilla. However, critics often identify a strongly homoerotic relationship between Coverdale and Hollingsworth.

Old Moodie: Though introduced as Old Moodie, he was formerly known as Fauntleroy, a wealthy but immoral man who loses his riches in a financial scandal. He is separated from his beautiful wife and daughter and disowned by the rest of his family. Years later, poorer and wiser, he remarries and has a second daughter. Coverdale uses him to discover the backgrounds of Zenobia and Priscilla, who are his two daughters.

The Veiled Lady: She is a mystical character, first introduced as a public curiosity, who suddenly disappears from the public&#x27;s eye. Her story is developed in a type of ghost story narrated by Zenobia in a segment titled The Silvery Veil. She is said to have been held captive by the curse of the veil, a symbol that in Hawthorne&#x27;s literature typically represents secret sin. She is controlled by the magician Westervelt and is eventually revealed to be Priscilla herself when Hollingsworth removes the veil.

Hollingsworth: A philanthropist overly concerned with his own ideals, he comes to the farm with Priscilla having been told she has a place there. He becomes good friends with Coverdale during the other&#x27;s sickness, but his attempts to recruit the other to his cause eventually cause enough tension for a split in the friendship. He believes in the reform of all sinners and attempts to use Blithedale and its residents to achieve these ends, instead of those supported by the group. He is rumored to have a relationship with Zenobia partway through the novel, and they plan on building a cottage together. However, he falls for Priscilla, saving her from the fate of the Veiled Lady, and breaks up with Zenobia, which causes her to commit suicide.

Silas Foster: Coverdale describes him as &quot;lank, stalwart, uncouth, and grizzly-bearded.&quot; He is the only resident that seems to be truly experienced in the art of farming. He is level-headed and sensible and is the first to suggest Priscilla stay upon her arrival. He is one of the three men to search for and find Zenobia&#x27;s body and, while displaying proper sadness and emotion, also accepts her death with the most ease.

Mrs. Foster: Wife of Silas Foster.

Zenobia: Beautiful and wealthy, she wears a different tropical flower in her hair every day. She is admired by both Hollingsworth and Coverdale, though both eventually fall for her sister Priscilla instead. Priscilla herself is also quite taken with the older woman and follows her around the farm. Zenobia&#x27;s main vice is pride, and she has an unusual and unexplained prior relationship with Professor Westervelt. By the end of the story, she is revealed to be (presumably) complicit in Westervelt&#x27;s pseudo-slavery of Priscilla as the Veiled Lady, a scheme she uses to perpetuate her wealthy lifestyle, and a potential reason Hollingsworth leaves her. She is the daughter of Old Moodie&#x27;s first, prosperous marriage when he was still referred to as Fauntleroy. She often is thought to be analogous to the author Margaret Fuller, who although not a resident of Brook Farm was a frequent visitor there.

Priscilla: A fragile, mysterious girl brought to the farm by Hollingsworth. She makes intricate purses that Coverdale considers a &quot;symbol of her mystery.&quot; She is known to frequently pause as if responding to a call, though no other characters hear it. She becomes progressively more open and less frail throughout the novel and develops a strong attachment to Hollingsworth on top of her sisterly affection for Zenobia. She is eventually revealed to be the second daughter of Old Moodie, as well as the alter ego of the Veiled Lady. Hollingsworth frees her from the curse of the veil, and at the book&#x27;s close, she remains attached to him.

Professor Westervelt: Stumbles into the plot looking for Priscilla and Zenobia. Coverdale takes an immediate distaste for him and describes him with such language as one would describe the devil. In fact, much of the imagery Coverdale uses, such as the flames on Westervelt&#x27;s pin and the serpent-headed staff he carries are direct references to Satan. He presumably has a former, possibly romantic, relationship with Zenobia. He is revealed to be the magician controlling Priscilla near the end of the book, and his last appearance is at Zenobia&#x27;s funeral where he criticizes her foolish suicide.

== Narrative style ==
The novel is written from a first-person limited point of view and the narrator is Miles Coverdale. Coverdale&#x27;s narrative style is erratic and dreamlike, bringing a strange form of syntax to the novel that is more Coverdale&#x27;s than Hawthorne&#x27;s. In a final chapter added after the original manuscript was completed but before publishing, Coverdale breaks the fourth wall and reveals that the writing takes place significantly after leaving Blithedale. He reveals the fates of the other characters from a still limited viewpoint.

==Symbolism==
*Flower: Zenobia wears a new exotic flower every day. It represents vitality, and all the other characters are focused on destroying it. Coverdale is always probing and investigating her life. Hollingsworth uses her in his conspiracy to create an ideal society. Priscilla betrays her when she chooses Hollingsworth over her. Lastly, Westervelt blackmails her. She ultimately destroys herself through suicide. The exotic flower is a symbol of her pride, life and vitality all of which the characters in the &quot;Blithedale Romance&quot; are set on destroying. Zenobia&#x27;s main vice is pride; however, it is why she is admired by all. Its physical representation is demonstrated through her exotic flower.

*Veil: The veil represents withdrawal and concealment. Priscilla, as the Veiled Lady, is private and hidden. The image of the veil appears with almost every character. Old Moodie with his alias and eye patch illustrates his use of concealment. Westervelt&#x27;s gold teeth, and Hollingsworth&#x27;s philanthropic project are also examples of a withdrawal. Additionally, the whole community is withdrawn from society, as it is a secluded Utopian community. The veil is a constantly recurring theme throughout the novel. Concealment and withdrawal continually surface through all the characters.

*Spring/Fall: The novel starts in spring and ends in fall. Upon moving to Blithedale, Coverdale proclaims his own rebirth. Spring is full of warmth and hope, while fall is full of dark imagery. In spring, Coverdale recovers from his illness. In the fall, it concludes with the mutilated, marbled, rigid corpse of Zenobia.

*Sickness: At the beginning of the novel, Coverdale becomes deathly ill and is bedridden. Hollingsworth cares for him and he returns to health. Priscilla is also sick and gradually regains her health as time elapses and she adjusts to Blithedale. As Roy R. Male Jr. wrote, &quot;This sickness is what the book is about.&quot; Coverdale&#x27;s mental state also changes throughout the novel. Upon his return, he emphasizes that there is a &quot;Sickness of the spirits [which] kept alternating with my flights of causeless buoyancy.&quot;

*Dreams: The dream of building a Utopian Society is just one of the dreams in the novel. As Daniel Hoffman wrote, &quot;Whether Miles Coverdale is reporting what he has actually seen and heard, or what he has dreamed. Parts of the book indeed seem to rely on, to create, a stream-of-consciousness narration&quot; Coverdale&#x27;s dreams reveal his discovery and continued repression of his sexual desire of Zenobia. There are dreams created in his imagination and memory, as well as the dreams in his sleep. All of which include the veil and mask imagery that recur in the novel.

==Development and publication history==

&quot;The Blithedale Romance&quot; is a work of fiction based on Hawthorne&#x27;s recollections of Brook Farm, a short-lived agricultural and educational commune where Hawthorne lived from April to November 1841. The commune, an attempt at an intellectual utopian society, interested many famous Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Margaret Fuller, though few of the Transcendentalists actually lived there. In the novel&#x27;s preface, Hawthorne describes his memories of this temporary home as &quot;essentially a daydream, and yet a fact&quot; which he employs as &quot;an available foothold between fiction and reality.&quot; His feelings of affectionate scepticism toward the commune are reflected not only in the novel but also in his journal entries and in the numerous letters he wrote from Brook Farm to Sophia Peabody, his future wife.

Hawthorne&#x27;s claim that the novel&#x27;s characters are &quot;entirely fictitious&quot; has been widely questioned. The character of Zenobia, for example, is said to have been modelled upon Margaret Fuller, an acquaintance of Hawthorne and a frequent guest at Brook Farm. The circumstances of Zenobia&#x27;s death, however, were not inspired by the shipwreck that ended Fuller&#x27;s life but by the suicide of a certain Miss Martha Hunt, a refined but melancholy young woman who drowned herself in a river on the morning of July 9, 1845. Hawthorne helped to search for the body that night and later recorded the incident at considerable length in his journal. Suggested prototypes for Hollingsworth include Amos Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Horace Mann, while the narrator is often supposed to be Hawthorne himself.

==Literary significance and reception==
Following its publication, &quot;The Blithedale Romance&quot; was received with little enthusiasm by contemporary critics. As one reviewer claims, the preface which is merely a disclaimer of sorts, &quot;is by no means the least important part of it&quot;. In fact, too many reviews this simple, non-fictional disclaimer seems to be the most important part of the book. Many reviews refer to the preface of the novel and express skepticism in regard to Hawthorne&#x27;s plea contained therein for the reader not to take the characters and occurrences of the novel as representative of real-life people and events. They claim that there is simply too much correlation between fiction and nonfiction. One reviewer states &quot;So vividly does [Hawthorne] present to us the scheme at Brook Farm, to which some of our acquaintance were parties, so sharply and accurately does he portray some incidents of life there, that we are irresistibly impelled to fix the real names of men and women to the characters of his book&quot;. As such they read into what Hawthorne writes about characters that have associated real-life figures.

However, other reviews, while stating that there is a correlation between the fiction of the novel and reality, but these correlations should not lead to an association of fiction and non-fiction. One review states &quot;We can recognize in the personages of his Romance individual traits of several real characters who were [at Brook Farm], but no one has his or her whole counterpart in one who was actually a member of the community. There was no actual Zenobia, Hollingsworth, or Priscilla there, and no such catastrophe as described ever occurred there&quot;.

In &quot;Hawthorne&quot; (1879), Henry James called it &quot;the lightest, the brightest, the liveliest&quot; of Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;unhumorous fictions&quot;, while literary critic Richard Brodhead has described it as &quot;the darkest of Hawthorne&#x27;s novels.&quot;

A lot of modern criticism centers around the relationship between fiction and non-fiction as well. Critics believe that when viewed as representative of Hawthorne&#x27;s own life and beliefs, &quot;The Blithedale Romance&quot; provides insight into the mind of the author. According to critics, the novel can be seen as a reflection of the religious conflict Hawthorne faced throughout his life. Irving Howe summarizes this religious conflict, stating, &quot;Throughout his life, Hawthorne was caught up in what we would call a crisis of religious belief. His acute moral sense had been largely detached from the traditional context of the orthodox faith, but it had found little else in which to thrive&quot;. Although Hawthorne did not agree with Puritan dogmas, Transcendentalists often associated morality with the observance of these dogmas. The novel presents an ironic contradiction between the perception of morality and actual morality, such as the &quot;Utopian&quot; Blithedale filled with sin and far less than &quot;moral&quot; individuals. Critics claim, therefore that Blithedale is an attempt by Hawthorne to represent morality as independent from faith.

In a broader sense, critics have long argued that the majority of the people, places, and events of &quot;The Blithedale Romance&quot; can be traced back to Hawthorne&#x27;s observations and experiences over his lifetime. The most obvious of these correlations between fiction and reality is the similarity between Blithedale and Brook Farm, an actual experimental community in the 19th century of which Hawthorne was a part. In addition, the character of Coverdale is often associated with Hawthorne himself. However, according to critics, this self-portrait is &quot;a highly and mocking self-portrait, as if Hawthorne were trying to isolate and thereby exorcise everything within him that impedes full participation in life&quot;. Critics have also argued for less obvious connections such as the connection between Zenobia and Margaret Fuller, a contemporary of Hawthorne.

<text>Koreatown (, ) is a neighborhood in central Los Angeles, California, centered near Eighth and Irolo streets.

Koreans began immigrating in larger numbers in the 1960s and found housing in the Mid-Wilshire area. Many opened businesses as they found rent and tolerance toward the growing Korean population. Many of the historic Art Deco buildings with terra cotta façades have been preserved because the buildings remained economically viable for the new businesses.

Despite the name evoking a traditional ethnic enclave, the community is complex and has an impact on areas outside the traditional boundaries. While the neighborhood culture was historically oriented to the Korean immigrant population, Korean business owners are creating stronger ties to the Latino community in Koreatown. The community is highly diverse ethnically, with half the residents being Latino and a third being Asian. Two-thirds of the residents were born outside of the United States, a high figure compared to the rest of the city.

==History==
=== 1900s–1980s ===
In 1882, the United States and Korea established the United States-Korea Treaty of 1882, which ended Korea&#x27;s self-imposed isolation. The establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and Korea paved the way for Korean immigration to Hawaii in the late 1880s. In the early 1900s, Korean immigrants began making their way to Los Angeles, where they created communities based around ethnic churches. As the number of Koreans increased to the hundreds, their residential and commercial activities spread to the southwestern corner of the Los Angeles business district, putting them within walking distance of Little Tokyo and Chinatown.

By the 1930s, approximately 650 Koreans resided in Los Angeles. They established churches, restaurants, and community organizations, as well as businesses that primarily focused on vegetable and fruit distribution. In 1936, the Korean National Association, one of the largest Korean immigrant political organizations, moved its central headquarters from San Francisco to Los Angeles to continue promoting political, cultural, educational, and religious activities. However, racial covenant laws and economic constraints limited Korean residents to an area bounded by Adams Boulevard to the north, Slauson Avenue to the south, Western Avenue to the west, and Vermont Avenue to the east. The 1930s also saw the height of the area&#x27;s association with Hollywood. The Ambassador Hotel hosted the Academy Awards ceremony in 1930, 1931, 1932, and 1934. As the entertainment industry grew in the surrounding Koreatown area, Koreans remained segregated into low-income districts because of discriminatory housing policies. After the 1948 &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; Supreme Court case prohibited racially restrictive housing policies, Koreans began to move north of Olympic Boulevard to establish new homes and businesses.

In the late 1960s, the surrounding neighborhood began to enter a steep economic decline. The once-glamorous mid-Wilshire area became filled with vacant commercial and office space that attracted wealthier South Korean immigrants. They found inexpensive housing and many opened businesses in Koreatown. Many of the area&#x27;s Art Deco buildings with terracotta facades were preserved because they remained economically viable with the new commercial activity that occupied them. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 removed restrictions on Asian migration and helped further the growth of the immigrant community in Koreatown.

By the late 1970s, most businesses in the Olympic Boulevard and 8th Street areas were owned by Koreans. This economic boom led to the creation of Korean media outlets and community organizations, which played a key role in developing a sense of communal identity in the neighborhood. The ethnic enclave was able to establish itself as the primary hub of the Korean community in Southern California, and the residents successfully lobbied for the installation of the first Koreatown sign in 1982.

=== 1992 Los Angeles riots ===
During the time of the riots, there was racial strife between Black and Korean Americans. In many predominantly Black neighborhoods, Korean citizens owned the majority of businesses. When White residents left the area, Koreans purchased their businesses from them for little money. Rapper Ice Cube spoke of this, along with Asian suspicion of Black residents in his 1991 album &quot;Death Certificate&quot; during the song &quot;Black Korea&quot;.

On March 16, 1991, a Korean store owner, Soon Ja Du, shot and killed a 15-year-old Black customer, Latasha Harlins. Du accused Harlins of stealing orange juice, and after watching her put down the jug and turn to leave, shot her in the head. Some historians view Du&#x27;s posting bail as the breaking point in tensions.

The 1992 Los Angeles riots stimulated a new wave of political activism among Korean-Americans, but also split them into two camps. The liberals sought to unite with other minorities in Los Angeles to fight against racial oppression and scapegoating. The conservatives emphasized law and order and generally favored the economic and social policies of the Republican Party. The conservatives also tended to emphasize the political differences between Koreans and other minorities, specifically Blacks and Hispanics. Despite this divide within the Korean American community, the 1992 riots also inspired further efforts to build coalitions. The 1992 Koreatown Peace Rally was a record-setting demonstration with over 30,000 attendees representing intergenerational and interethnic solidarity.

The week-long rioting and looting destroyed much of Koreatown. There was $50 million worth of damage done, half of which was on Korean-owned businesses. During the riots, roads between Koreatown and safer neighborhoods were blocked off. Some Korean-Americans speculated that they were being trapped in the danger. One resident said, &quot;It was containment. The police cut off traffic out of Koreatown, while we were trapped on the other side without help. Those roads are a gateway to a richer neighborhood. It can&#x27;t be denied.&quot; Some Korean Americans who survived the riot have said that people of minority races and ethnicities were not served fairly by the current social system.

An 18-year-old Korean American, Edward Song Lee, and his three friends went to protect a Korean-owned pizza shop, along with other store owners and volunteers who would constitute the rooftop Koreans. Lee was accidentally shot to death by Korean shopkeepers who mistook him and his friends for looters. Hyungwon Kang captured a photograph of Lee&#x27;s body in the street.

The 1992 unrest had a significant impact on the community, solidifying the importance of community-based nonprofit organizations, such as the Koreatown Youth and Community Center (KYCC) and Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance (KIWA) (see Community Organizations section). These organizations advocated for reparations and protections for Korean Americans, who received little support from government authorities as a result of their low social status and language barrier.

=== 2000s–present ===
In late 2008, the City of Los Angeles designated Koreatown a special graphics district (along with Hollywood and the downtown neighborhood of South Park/LA Live). The designation allows for digital signage and electronic billboards, not permitted by city code, to be installed on building facades. The designation allowed Times Square and Shibuya District-inspired buildings lined with LCD jumbotrons. The 300-square block graphics district is bordered by 6th Street and Olympic Boulevard on the north and south respectively, and St. Andrews Place and Shatto Place on the west and east respectively.

The construction of the Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools at the former site of the Ambassador Hotel highlighted the challenge of balancing resource expansion with business development and historic preservation. The schools were constructed with the intention of increasing educational opportunities for low-income Latina/Latino and Korean students, but the $578 million construction cost made the complex the most expensive public school in United States history. By 2020, Koreatown was &quot;known for having one of the largest concentrations of nightclubs and 24-hour businesses and restaurants in the country. Other developments, such as the opening of new metro stations, shopping centers, and strip malls, have made Koreatown a popular tourist destination while also increasing economic inequality for locals. Protests against and in favor of building a homeless shelter took place in 2020.

Since Koreatown has a Latino majority, it is not unusual to find Latino employees in restaurants and grocery stores speaking Korean with customers or Korean store owners engaging Latino customers in Spanish. An example of a cultural interchange between Koreans and Latinos in Koreatown is the popularity of Korean-inspired taco trucks in Los Angeles that feature classic Mexican food infused with Korean ingredients.
==Geography==
The neighborhood lies west of downtown, southeast of Hollywood, east of Santa Monica Beach and northeast of Los Angeles International Airport. It is generally flat, with an average elevation of .

The boundaries of Koreatown are blurry; The most familiar thoroughfare is Wilshire Boulevard, from Vermont to Western avenues. But the area extends south as Olympic Boulevard and north to Beverly Blvd, with spillover into adjacent Westlake and Hancock Park.

=== The beginnings of Koreatown ===
In the early 1900s, Koreans clustered around the downtown Los Angeles Bunker Hill area. This housing segregation was due to racial covenant laws that restricted them to mixed-race, low-income districts. By the 1930s, Koreans began to move to Jefferson Boulevard between Western and Vermont Avenue.

The next major shift began in the 1960s. As the African American population increased in southern Los Angeles, middle-class White Americans began to move out of the mid-Wilshire district. The area north of Olympic Boulevard transitioned from a predominantly white suburb to a home for Asian residents. The area has become the mainstay of the Korean American community, although varying sources have established different boundaries for Koreatown.

In 1980, the neighborhood of Koreatown was officially designated by Los Angeles.

===City of Los Angeles boundaries===

The city of Los Angeles has set the official boundaries for Koreatown as Vermont Avenue on the east, Western Avenue on the west, Third Street on the north, and Olympic Boulevard on the south. A business corridor running about 3/4 of a mile along Western Avenue to Rosewood Avenue is also included as part of Koreatown.

In 2010, the City of Los Angeles considered expanding Koreatown further west to include Wilshire Park and Park Mile. The request was rejected, and the committee reiterated that the western boundary for Koreatown was at Western Avenue.

The Koreatown Regional Commercial Center runs along Olympic Boulevard and is &quot;generally bounded by Eighth Street on the north, Twelfth Street on the south, Western Avenue on the west, and continues east towards Vermont Avenue&quot;, according to the Wilshire Community Plan of the City of Los Angeles.

===Google Maps===

Google Maps draws the following boundaries for Koreatown: Vermont Avenue on the east, Western Avenue on the west, Third Street on the north and Olympic Boulevard on the south.

===Mapping L.A. boundaries===

According to the Mapping L.A. project of the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; Koreatown has the following boundaries:

Beverly Boulevard on the north, Virgil Avenue, Wilshire Place and Westmoreland Avenue on the east, Olympic Boulevard on the south and Crenshaw Boulevard and Wilton Place on the west. The neighborhood is flanked by East Hollywood to the north, Westlake to the east, Pico-Union, Harvard Heights and Arlington Heights to the south, Mid-Wilshire and Windsor Square to the west and Larchmont to the northwest.

This version of Koreatown includes the neighborhoods of Wilshire Center, Wilshire Park and part of Park Mile.

==Demographics==
Koreatown is one of the densest neighborhoods in the United States.
The 2000 U.S. census counted 115,070 residents in the 2.7-square-mile neighborhood—an average of 42,611 people per square mile, the highest density of any community in Los Angeles County. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 124,281. The median age for residents was 30, an average age for both the city and Los Angeles County.

Koreatown is considered &quot;highly diverse&quot; ethnically. The breakdown is Latinos, 53.5%; Asians, 32.2%; whites, 7.4%; blacks, 4.8%, and others, 2%. Korea (28.6%) and Mexico (23.9%) were the most common places of birth for the 68% of the residents who were born abroad, a figure that is considered high compared to the city as a whole.

The median annual household income in 2008 dollars was $30,558, a low figure for Los Angeles, and the percentage of households that earned less than $20,000 was high. The average household size of 2.7 people was about the same as the rest of the city. Renters occupied 93% of the housing units, and house- or apartment owners the rest.

The percentages of never-married men and women, 44.6% and 36.2%, respectively, were among the county&#x27;s highest. There were 2,833 military veterans in 2000, or 3.3%, a low figure for Los Angeles.

===Homeless population===

In 2022, there were 435 homeless individuals in Koreatown.

==Economy==
Olympic Boulevard has blocks dominated by Korean-language signs and new blue-tile-roofed shopping centers. This initial Korean business area has spread to an area bounded by Olympic Boulevard, Vermont Avenue, 8th Street and Western Avenue. The Korean business area also sprawls to the north and south along Western and Vermont for three miles, and to the east and west along Olympic for two miles. South Korean investment has been a large contributor to the neighborhood economy since the 1960s. Since the early 2000s, that investment has increased greatly, ballooning to an estimated $1 billion in new construction investment. Jamison Services, Inc is Koreatown&#x27;s biggest landlord and most prolific residential builder. The area also has a vibrant nightlife with many lively restaurants and clubs, especially Korean barbeque restaurants and karaoke bars.

Local lines include the 207 Western, 14 Beverly, 16 3rd Street, 18 6th Street, 20 Wilshire/Westwood, 66 8th Street, 28 Olympic, 204 Vermont, 206 Normandie, and 210 Crenshaw. Many MTA bus lines in Koreatown offer 24-hour service.

The LADOT operates three district-to-district DASH routes, one Commuter Express line and Cityride. Koreatown is served by DASH Hollywood/Wilshire line and Dash Koreatown. The DASH lines are meant for local neighborhood transportation; their routes are shorter than MTA lines. DASH service ends at 7pm weekdays and only Dash Koreatown operates on weekends, ending service at 6pm. DASH fares are 50 cents. Commuter Express line 534 Century City provides weekday service while Cityride offers door to door dial-a-ride service for the elderly and disabled.

<text>Coventry City Football Club is a professional football club based in Coventry, West Midlands, England. The club plays in the EFL Championship, the second tier of English football. The club is nicknamed after the sky blue colours that were part of the club&#x27;s early years, before making a return in 1962.

Coventry City formed as Singers F.C. in 1883 following a general meeting of the Singer Gentleman&#x27;s club. They adopted their current name in 1898 and joined the Southern League in 1908, before being selected into the Football League in 1919. Relegated in 1925, they returned to the Second Division as champions of the Third Division South and Third Division South Cup winners in 1935–36. Relegated in 1952, they won promotion in the inaugural Fourth Division season in 1958–59. Coventry reached the First Division after winning the Third Division title in 1963–64 and the Second Division title in 1966– 67 under the management of Jimmy Hill. In the 1970–71 season, the team competed in the European Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, reaching the second round. Despite beating Bayern Munich 2–1 in the home leg, they had lost 6–1 in the first leg in Germany, and thus were eliminated.

Coventry&#x27;s only period in the top division to date lasted 34 consecutive years between 1967 and 2001, and the club were inaugural members of the Premier League in 1992. They won the FA Cup in 1987, the club&#x27;s only major trophy, when they beat Tottenham Hotspur 3–2. They experienced further relegations in 2012 and 2017, though did manage to win the EFL Trophy in 2017.

Coventry returned to Wembley in 2018, beating Exeter City in the League Two play-off final. Manager Mark Robins built on this success guiding the Sky Blues to eighth in League One the next season and then led the club to promotion back to the EFL Championship as League One champions in 2020. In the 2022–23 season, Coventry secured a play-off place in the Championship, before losing the play-off final to Luton Town on penalties.
For 106 years, from 1899 to 2005, Coventry City played at Highfield Road. The 32,609-capacity Coventry Arena was opened in August 2005 to replace Highfield Road, but the club has struggled with the new stadium lease since moving.

==History==

=== Early years (1883–1919) ===
Coventry City was founded in 1883 as Singers F.C., following a meeting between William Stanley and seven colleagues from the Singer Cycle Company at the Lord Aylesford Inn in Hillfields. It was one of several 19th century clubs linked to Coventry&#x27;s bicycle factories, and the company founder George Singer was its first president. Singers joined the Birmingham County Football Association in 1884 and played around forty games in their first four years at Dowells Field in the Stoke area. In early seasons they lacked a regular playing staff and sometimes lacked equipment such as goal nets. In 1887, the club moved to the larger Stoke Road Ground, which had rudimentary stands, and they charged an entrance fee for the first time. The following five seasons were very successful, culminating in back-to-back Birmingham Junior Cup titles in 1891 and 1892.

Singers turned professional in 1892 and joined the Birmingham &amp; District League in 1894, competing against strong reserve sides from established regional teams such as Aston Villa. Coventry residents not connected to the cycle company began supporting the club, and it was renamed Coventry City in 1898. Highfield Road opened in 1899, but its construction caused a financial crisis and subsequent salary disputes with the players. The club endured several poor seasons on the field, having to re-apply for membership of the league three times in the space of five years. In 1901, Coventry suffered their worst ever defeat with an 11–2 loss against Worcester-based Berwick Rangers in the qualifying round of the FA Cup. The club became a limited company in July 1907 and the team was more successful the following season, reaching the first round proper of the FA Cup for the first time before being eliminated by Crystal Palace.

In 1908, Coventry joined the Southern League, at the time the third-strongest English division. In their second season, Coventry reached the FA Cup quarter-final, beating top-flight teams Preston and Nottingham Forest before losing to Everton. Another two successful seasons followed but in 1914 the club was relegated, amid renewed financial problems. Its economic health worsened as attendances dropped sharply, and the club was in danger of dissolution. It was saved in part by the abandonment of competitive football in mid-1915 due to World War I. The club&#x27;s debts were then paid off by benefactor David Cooke in 1917. During the war, they played some friendly matches against local clubs and joined a temporary wartime division for 1918–19.

=== League football and the &quot;Old Five&quot; (1919–1945) ===
In 1919, Coventry submitted a successful application to join the Football League and were placed into the Second Division for the 1919–20 season, the first played after the war. In preparation for league football, the club invested in new players and increased Highfield Road&#x27;s capacity to 40,000. They avoided finishing last in 1919–20 when they won their final game against Bury, but this result was later found to be rigged, the club receiving a heavy fine in 1923. In 1924–25, after their sixth successive relegation battle, Coventry finished bottom of the table and dropped into the Third Division North. A year later they were asked by the League to switch to the Third Division South, to keep the sizes of the divisions even. Their poor form continued, and in 1927–28 they narrowly avoided having to seek re-election. Supporters rioted after the final game that season, some calling for the club to be wound up and a phoenix club established in its place. In 1928, the club&#x27;s worst ever attendance was recorded with a gate of 2,059 for a match against Crystal Palace.

In addition to poor form on the field, the club ran into financial difficulties by the end of the 1920s, having to rely on fundraisers by supporters and a cash injection by Cooke, who had become club president. A committee of enquiry in 1928 concluded that the club was being mismanaged, leading to resignation of chairman W. Carpenter and his replacement by Walter Brandish. The club&#x27;s form began to improve under the new board, and the appointment of Harry Storer as manager in 1931 brought in an era of success at the club. Coventry scored a total of 108 goals in the 1931–32 season, gaining the nickname &quot;The Old Five&quot; as a result of scoring five or more in many games. New signing Clarrie Bourton&#x27;s individual tally of 49 goals was the Football League record for that season, and his overall total of 50 remains the club record. Two further 100-goal seasons followed, the first time in the league that a team had achieved three in a row, and Coventry recorded their largest ever league victory in April 1934, 9–0 against Bristol City. Despite scoring heavily, Coventry missed out on promotion every season until 1935–36, when they finished as Third Division North champions.

The club continued their good form in the second tier, finishing eighth, fourth and fourth again between 1936 and 1939. They also constructed a new main stand and purchased the freehold of Highfield Road, utilising a loan of £20,000 from local motor-industry entrepreneur John Siddeley. In 1937–38 they met with Midlands rivals Aston Villa the first time in league football, securing with a win and a draw in the two meetings as well as a higher-placed finish than the Birmingham club. In September 1939, the league season was aborted after three games due to the start of World War II. Many supporters at the time blamed the war for robbing the team of a probable imminent promotion to the First Division, although several top players including Bourton had been sold by 1939, and attendances had begun to fall. Coventry continued playing some friendly games until November 1940, when the Coventry Blitz damaged the stadium and brought all football in the city to a halt. Friendly matches resumed again in 1942, as parts of Highfield Road had been rebuilt, and the team joined the Midland Regional League.

=== Rise to the First Division, Europe, and FA Cup victory (1945–1987) ===
Storer left Coventry for Birmingham City after the war, and many of the 1939 squad had retired by 1945. New manager Dick Bayliss assembled a squad with a mixture of pre-war players and newcomers, but his tenure was cut short when he died after being stranded in a snow storm in 1947. Replacement Billy Frith was dismissed following a poor start to 1948–49 and the club persuaded Storer to return from Birmingham. In 1950–51, Coventry led the Second Division table at Christmas, but a poor run ended their promotion hopes and the following season they were relegated. They spent the next six seasons in the Third Division South, with seven different managers, but were never in contention for promotion. The average attendance at Highfield Road dropped sharply during this period, and several top players had to be sold amid financial difficulties. In 1958, the north and south divisions were replaced by a single nationwide third and a new fourth. Coventry were placed in the latter as a result of a bottom-half finish in 1957–58. Three games into 1958–59, the club occupied its lowest ever overall league position, 91st, but recovered to secure promotion back into the third tier.

The appointment of Derrick Robins as chairman in 1958 and Jimmy Hill as manager in 1961, marked the start of the &quot;Sky Blue revolution&quot; at the club. Hill changed the club&#x27;s kit colour and nickname, introduced the Sky Blue Song, and added pre-match entertainment. Backed by an injection of cash from Robins, Hill led Coventry to the Third and Second Division championships in 1964 and 1967 respectively, taking them to the top division for the first time. Coventry&#x27;s record attendance was set in 1967, against fellow title-chasers Wolverhampton Wanderers; the official gate was 51,455 although the club estimated that the figure was higher. In 1969–70, under Hill&#x27;s successor Noel Cantwell, the club finished sixth in the First Division, which remains their highest ever position. The top-six finish earned them a place in the 1970–71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, which ended in the second round with a 7–3 aggregate defeat against Bayern Munich. In the mid-1970s, the club faced renewed financial difficulty and sold several top players. A relegation battle followed in 1976–77, which culminated in a controversial 2–2 draw with Bristol City that saw both sides survive at the expense of Sunderland, playing out the final minutes without any attempt to score further goals. A season of success followed in 1977–78, as Coventry finished seventh, narrowly missing a European place. In 1980–81, Coventry reached their first major semi-final, losing to West Ham United in the League Cup.

Hill returned to the club as managing director in 1975, and was elevated to chairman in 1980. He initiated several transformations at the club, including the conversion of Highfield Road to England&#x27;s first all-seat stadium in 1981, and the opening of a sports centre and training ground in Ryton-on-Dunsmore. Hill attempted to rename the club &quot;Coventry Talbot&quot;, after their sponsors, but this was rejected by the Football Association. To pay for the developments, the club sold top players including popular striker Tommy Hutchison, and results suffered. Hill was forced out of the club in 1983 and terraces reintroduced two years later. Despite surviving relegation battles for four successive seasons, with three changes of manager, by 1986 the club had assembled a strong squad. Under duo George Curtis and John Sillett, they spent most of the following season in the top eight, and advanced to the 1987 FA Cup final. In a match later described by Steven Pye of &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27; as a &quot;classic final&quot;, Coventry beat Tottenham Hotspur 3–2 at Wembley which, , is the club&#x27;s only major trophy to date.

=== Recent history (1987–present) ===
Coventry&#x27;s FA Cup defence ended with a fourth-round defeat to Watford, followed a season later by one of the biggest upsets in FA Cup history when they lost 2–1 to non-league Sutton United in the third round. They finished seventh in the league that season, however, their highest finish since 1978. A last-day escape in 1991–92 earned Coventry a place in the newly-formed Premier League. Bryan Richardson took over as club chairman in summer 1993, making large sums of money available for players over subsequent years. With Ron Atkinson and then Gordon Strachan as manager, Coventry signed several high-profile players such as Dion Dublin, Moustapha Hadji, Peter Ndlovu and Robbie Keane, but did not finish higher than 11th place for the remainder of their Premier League tenure.

In 1997, Richardson revealed the initial proposals for a new stadium in the north of Coventry, at the time envisaged as having 40,000 seats and included in England&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for the 2006 World Cup. The project was backed by Coventry City Council and gained planning permission in 1998, but involved high costs, inducing the board to sell Highfield Road to a property developer and lease it back, before construction had started. On the field, Coventry were forced by the rising debts to sell their top players without replacement, and were finally relegated in 2000–01, ending 34 years of continuous tenure in the top flight.

In their first season back in the second tier, Coventry occupied 4th place with seven games remaining, but ultimately finished 11th, outside the play-off places. The new stadium opened in 2005, having been reduced in size and delayed several times; the club had previously sold its 50% share to the Alan Higgs charity to repay debts. The club&#x27;s financial situation remained poor, and by 2007 they faced the possibility of being forced out of business; this was averted when the club was bought by hedge fund owner Sisu Capital. Led by chairman Ray Ranson, Coventry signed several promising youngsters in the early Sisu years, but they failed to achieve on-field success. Sisu began reducing investment from 2009 as debts mounted, leading eventually to Ranson&#x27;s resignation in 2011. They were relegated to League One in 2012, and were forced to groundshare with Northampton Town for more than a year from 2013, following a rent dispute with the Ricoh Arena owners. Coventry City Football Club Ltd was dissolved, but the team were allowed to continue playing in League One under Sisu Company Otium.

In 2016–17, Coventry were relegated to League Two, but also won the EFL Trophy in the same season, their first trophy for 30 years. The following season, their first in the fourth tier since 1959, they were promoted straight back, finishing sixth and beating Exeter City in the play-off final. Two seasons later, they were promoted again, being awarded the League One championship via a points-per-game system after the season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of curtailment in March 2020, they led the table with 67 points from 34 games. They were exiled from the Ricoh Arena again from 2019 to 2021, playing their home games at St Andrew&#x27;s in Birmingham, amid ongoing legal action by Sisu over the 2014 purchase of the stadium by rugby club Wasps, which concluded only in 2022 when the European Commission declined to hear an appeal.

The Sisu era at Coventry City ended in 2023, when local businessman Doug King purchased the club. King had also attempted to acquire the CBS Arena, after both Wasps and the stadium holding company had fallen into administration, but his bid came too late and the stadium was eventually sold to Mike Ashley. Coventry finished fifth in the Championship and then progressed to the play-off final at Wembley, missing out on promotion to the Premier League in a penalty shoot-out defeat against Luton Town. The following season, the club reached the FA Cup semi-final for the first time since 1987, facing Manchester United at Wembley. After going 3–0 down, Coventry levelled the match in stoppage time but went on to lose on penalties. Later in 2024, Coventry sacked long-time manager Mark Robins following a run of poor results, replacing him with Frank Lampard.

==Playing kit==
===Colours===

Coventry&#x27;s home shirts are either completely or predominantly sky blue. However, in past seasons, different &#x27;home colours&#x27; were worn. For example, in 1889, the then Singers FC wore pink and blue halved shirts (mirroring the corporate colours of Singers Motors). Furthermore, in the 1890s, black and red were the club&#x27;s colours. In the early 1920s, the club wore red and green (to reflect the colours of the city crest). Sky blue was first used by Coventry in 1898 and the theme was used until 1922. Variations of blue and white were then used until the 1960s and the beginning of the &#x27;sky blue revolution&#x27;. The colour made its return in 1962 thanks to the then manager, Jimmy Hill. To mark the 125th year of the club, Coventry wore a special brown shirt in the last home game of the 2008–09 season against Watford, having first worn a chocolate brown away kit in 1978. This kit has been cited by some as the worst in English football history, but also has an iconic status with some fans.

In 2012, in the Third round FA Cup tie versus Southampton, the team wore a commemorative blue and white striped kit, marking the 25th anniversary of the club winning the FA Cup in 1987. The strip was worn again in January 2013 for Coventry&#x27;s 3rd round FA Cup fixture with Tottenham Hotspur, whom they beat in the 1987 final. In 2019, Coventry City announced a new third kit in black and white honouring the city&#x27;s connection with 2 Tone Records on the 40th anniversary of the record label.

===Kit makers and sponsorship===
Since the 2019–20 season, the kit is made by Hummel. The home, away and third kit is sponsored by Monzo as the main club sponsor across the front of the shirt and King of Shaves on the reverse.

The first official kit manufacture deal came in 1974 when Umbro signed a deal with the club. Coventry also had the first kit sponsorship deal in the football league, when Jimmy Hill, then chairman of the club, negotiated a deal with Talbot, who manufactured cars in the city.

==Stadium==
===Early grounds===
Coventry&#x27;s first ground was at Dowells Field, where they played as Singers F.C. from their founding in 1883 until 1887. It was located in the Stoke area south of Binley Road close to a landmark called Robinsons Pit, in an area of fields which belonged at the time to a landowner named Samuel Dowell. The site was later the location of the Gosford Park Hotel and the Coventry loop line railway, and much of the former pitch is now occupied by housing.

The club&#x27;s second pitch was at Stoke Road, to which Singers moved in 1887. It was located between Paynes Lane and Swan Lane, immediately to the south of the eventual Highfield Road stadium. The move coincided with the appointment of J.G. Morgan as club secretary, who transformed the club&#x27;s operations and was the first to hold a manager role. Unlike Dowells Field, Stoke Ground was fully enclosed by hedges and trees and featured a small stand and entrances close to the White Lion and Binley Oak pubs. An admission fee of two pence was charged for attendance at games. Singers&#x27; biggest rivals during the Stoke Road years were the Rudge Cycle Company team, with games between the two clubs attracted crowds as high as 4,000 by the end of the 1880s.

===Highfield Road ===
In 1899, shortly after Singers became Coventry City, they were forced to vacate Stoke Road due to an extension of King Richard Street and a housing development to accommodate Coventry&#x27;s rising population. The club acquired a site previously owned by the Craven Cricket Club and built the new stadium there. It was named Highfield Road after the road to the north of the ground, at the time the only access route from the city centre, which was in turn named after a Highfield Farm that had stood on the site earlier. Construction cost £100, a large amount for the club at the time, and on opening the ground featured a single stand on the southern side of the field. The first game at the ground was a 1–0 win against Stoke City with an attendance of 3,000, but the club went on to finish bottom of the Birmingham &amp; District League in the opening season.

A run to the FA Cup quarter finals in 1910 saw a then-record 18,995 attendance at Highfield Road, and the club spent the revenue generated by the cup run on the construction of a new stand on the northern side. A new terrace at the east of the ground, known as the Spion Kop, was opened in 1922, and in 1927 a roof was added over part of the western terrace, taken from Twickenham Stadium and funded by the supporters&#x27; club. In 1936, a new main stand was built and in the club also bought the freehold of the ground from the Mercers&#x27; Company, following a £20,000 loan by automotive entrepreneur John Siddeley. The stadium was bombed in the Coventry Blitz in 1941, damaging the pitch and the main stand, writer Nemo in the &quot;Coventry Telegraph&quot; said that Adolf Hitler had &quot;done a spot of ploughing&quot;. The first floodlights were installed at the ground in 1953, and were upgraded in 1957, using money raised by the supporters&#x27; club.

The &quot;Sky Blue revolution&quot; of Derrick Robins and Jimmy Hill in the 1960s saw large-scale development at Highfield Road, including construction of the new Sky Blue Stand on the north side of the ground. Hill also oversaw the ground&#x27;s conversion to all-seater as Chairman in 1981, but this was deeply unpopular with fans as well as Hill&#x27;s successor John Poynton, and a report in early 1985 concluded that it was not achieving its desired effect of combatting hooliganism at Highfield Road. The Spion Kop was reconfigured and converted back to a standing terrace later that year. The Taylor Report of 1990 led to a requirement that all top-flight teams should switch to all-seater. This led to what proved to be the final major development at Highfield Road, the construction of the new East Stand. The stadium hosted its last league game in a 6–2 Coventry win over Derby County in 2005 and was subsequently demolished to make way for a new housing development.

===Coventry Building Society Arena===
In 1997, Coventry City published plans for a 40,000-seat stadium on the site of a former gasworks in the Foleshill area of Coventry. Backed by a 50% stake from Coventry City Council, the stadium gained planning permission in 1998, and in 2000 was included in England&#x27;s bid for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The failure of this bid and relegation in 2001 forced Coventry City to sell their share of the stadium to the Alan Higgs charity to repay debts. After several delays, decontamination work on the site, and reductions in the scope of the project, the stadium hosted its first game in 2005 when Coventry defeated Queen&#x27;s Park Rangers 3–0. Electronics manufacturer Ricoh were the initial sponsor of the stadium and it was named the Ricoh Arena. In addition to the stadium, the venue features an exhibition hall, hotel and casino and is adjacent to a retail complex and superstore. Coventry Arena railway station was opened next to the site in 2016. It became the Coventry Building Society Arena in 2021 following a deal with Coventry Building Society.

In 2012, the club defaulted on its rent amid a dispute with the stadium&#x27;s owners, Arena Coventry Limited (ACL) - a company owned jointly by the city council and the Higgs charity. The two sides could not agree on a revised deal and Coventry played its home games at Sixfields Stadium for the 2013–14 season while also announcing plans to build a new stadium elsewhere in Coventry. The move was met with strong opposition and protests by Coventry fans, many of whom boycotted games at the stadium, gathering instead on an area close to Sixfields which they dubbed &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Hill&quot;. Coventry City returned to the Ricoh Arena in August 2014 after reaching a deal with ACL. Wasps purchased the stadium in late 2014, relocating to Coventry from Adams Park in High Wycombe. Coventry City were exiled from the stadium again from 2019 to 2021, playing their home games at St Andrew&#x27;s and later announcing a partnership with the University of Warwick with the goal of acquiring land for a new stadium. They returned to the Ricoh Arena following an agreement with Wasps in 2021, also maintaining the longer-term goal of constructing a new stadium. When Ashley took over the stadium in 2022, the club for a while faced the threat of eviction but a deal was eventually reached for the club to continue playing there until at least 2028.

==Supporters==

===Former Players&#x27; Association===
In February 2007 a Former Players&#x27; Association was launched. Set up by club historian and statistician Jim Brown, former 1980s player Kirk Stephens and a committee of volunteers, its aim was to bring former players of the club together and cherish their memories. To qualify for membership players have to have made at least one first-team competitive appearance for the club or been a manager.

Around 50 former stars of the club attended the launch including Coventry City legends George Hudson, Cyrille Regis, Charlie Timmins and Bill Glazier. The association&#x27;s first newsletter was published in autumn 2007 and a website launched. The launch of 2007 was followed by subsequent Legends&#x27; Days. The 2009 event, held at the home game against Doncaster Rovers was attended by 43 former players including the first visit to Coventry for many years of Roy Barry and Dave Clements. In March 2012 the membership had increased past the 200 mark with former captain Terry Yorath inducted as the 200th member at the 2012 Legends&#x27; Day.

Legends’ Day has become an almost permanent fixture amongst Coventry supporters. Legends’ Day has been held almost every year since the Inaugural Event. The only exceptions being in 2014 when the club were exiled playing home games in Northampton and in 2020 and 2021 after fans were shut out of stadiums as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Identity

The club&#x27;s support is collectively known as The Sky Blue Army. In Coventry and Warwickshire the use of the term ‘Going Up The City’ is a term used to say you are going to watch a Coventry City match.

The club&#x27;s support massively dropped off in the years of the SISU ownership, with the decline in average attendances falling in line with the club&#x27;s slide down the league pyramid. The exit from The Ricoh Arena in 2013 led to many supporters protesting against SISU&#x27;s ownership of the club and a section of the support enforce a ‘Not One Penny More’ policy in which its backers vowed not to give any more money to the club as long as SISU remained in charge.

In the 2013–14 season, in which the club was exiled at Northampton Town&#x27;s Sixfields Stadium the average attendance dropped to just over 2,000.

The Sky Blue Trust is the largest member-based supporters club and in its peak was fighting to gain a stake in the club and to get fan representation on the board of directors. As of 2022 The Sky Blue Trust are less vocal and are viewed as obsolete by many supporters.

===Sky Blue anthem===
The words to the club&#x27;s song were written in 1962 by Team Manager Jimmy Hill and Director John Camkin; The words being set to the tune of the Eton Boating Song. It was launched at the home game with Colchester on 22 December 1962 (a match abandoned at half-time because of fog) with the words printed in the programme. It quickly became popular with supporters during the epic FA Cup run in 1963 when the then Third Division team reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup before losing to eventual winners Manchester United:
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Original Words:&quot;
Let&#x27;s all sing together
Play up, Sky Blues
While we sing together
We will never lose
Proud, Posh or Cobblers
Oysters or anyone
They shan&#x27;t defeat us
We&#x27;ll fight till the game is won!
City! City! City!&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Current Words:&quot;
Let&#x27;s all sing together
Play up, Sky Blues
While we sing together
We will never lose
Tottenham or Chelsea
United or anyone
They shan&#x27;t defeat us
We&#x27;ll fight till the game is won!
City! City! City!&lt;/poem&gt;
Famous Supporters

The club has a number of famous supporters, Television Broadcaster Richard Keys was born in the city and is a lifelong supporter of the club. Fellow broadcaster Jon Gaunt is also a City fan.

The principal of the Red Bull Formula 1 team Christian Horner was outed as a supporter of the club when he jokingly claimed in an interview with Sky F1 he was trying to convince Kevin De Bruyne to join the club.

Haas F1 Team principal Ayao Komatsu revealed in an interview with Sky Sports F1 that he is a fan of the club. Komatusu&#x27;s support stems from being introduced to the club whilst he was studying at Loughborough University.

Comedian Josh Pugh grew up in nearby Atherstone and currently lives in Coventry and supports the Sky Blues.

From the world of music, Musician Neville Staple of The Specials is also a keen supporter of the club and in 2019, appeared in a kit launch for the clubs new ‘Two Tone’ themed Third Kit. Tom Clarke, Andy Hopkins and Liam Watts who formed local rock band The Enemy are all big City supporters.

Singer/Songwriter Tom Grennan is also a fan of the club owing to his manager and agent being a Sky Blues fan.

The actor Graeme Hawley who is best known for playing the role of John Stape in the ITV soap opera Coronation Street is a season ticket holder at the club.

Other famous fans include professional Darts players Steve Beaton and Steve Hine, Formula 1 mogul Eddie Jordan and Westlife member Brian McFadden.

Malcolm In The Middle actor Frankie Muniz is reportedly a Coventry City fan, apparently owing to a producer he made friends with on the set of the film Agent Cody Banks 2.

Politician Geoffrey Robinson is a fan of the club and once served as chairman.

==Rivalries==

Aston Villa are Coventry&#x27;s main rival. Historically, Aston Villa were Coventry&#x27;s main rivals, however many Coventry supporters also view the rivalry with Leicester City as significant. This rivalry is more reciprocated due to Villa&#x27;s stronger rivalry with Birmingham City.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s and to the turn of the millennium, Aston Villa were considered Coventry&#x27;s main rivals as they continually competed against each other in the First Division and then the Premier League. The two clubs however have not met since Coventry&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League in 2001. Leicester and Coventry compete the M69 Derby. However, largely due to the clubs&#x27; differing fortunes meetings between the two have been rare in recent years; the two clubs had not played each other between 2012 and 2023. The derby returned for the first time in eleven years in the 2023–24 EFL Championship season, following Leicester&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League. A small section of The Sky Blues&#x27; support were widely condemned in the build up to an M69 Derby in January 2024, after offensive banners mocking the death of former Foxes owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha were displayed across the City of Coventry

In the 1960s and 1970s there was intense rivalry with Wolverhampton Wanderers which started in 1965 after Wolves were relegated from Division One and the two clubs met in Division Two. The two sides were promoted together in 1967 and there were fierce battles in both city centres when the clubs met during the period. There was also rivalries with West Bromwich Albion and Walsall but these are much less fierce than the ones with Leicester, Wolves and Villa. A local rivalry also exists with Birmingham City, however the ground share agreement at St Andrew&#x27;s between 2019 and 2021 – which effectively spared Coventry from being expelled from the EFL – has led to friendlier relations between the two clubs’ supporters.

The club has an unusual long-distance rivalry with North-East side Sunderland, which stems back to the end of the 1976–77 season, when Coventry, Sunderland and Bristol City were all battling against relegation from Division One on the final day of the season. With Coventry and Bristol City facing each other at Highfield Road, the referee, on the advice of the police, delayed the kick-off of the match by 15 minutes as many Bristol fans were still trying to enter the ground and there was a risk of serious trouble. Sunderland, who were playing away to Everton at the same time, lost 2–0, and the result was displayed on the Highfield Road scoreboard. There were still 15 minutes left to play and Coventry and Bristol City effectively stopped playing knowing that a 2–2 draw would keep both teams up and send Sunderland down. There was an inquiry but the result was allowed to stand and Sunderland were relegated. Some Sunderland fans have held a grudge, believing that then-Coventry chairman Jimmy Hill used his influence to delay the game and give his side an advantage, and there has been some rivalry more recently as the two clubs competed for promotion from League One together in 2018–19 and 2019–20. In 2018–19 crowd trouble marred the meetings between the two at The Ricoh Arena and The Stadium of Light leading to numerous arrests among both sets of fans.

<doc id="435023" wikidata="Q1531596" url="?curid=435023" title="Global Consciousness Project">
<text>The Global Consciousness Project (GCP, also called the EGG Project) is a parapsychology experiment begun in 1998 as an attempt to detect possible interactions of &quot;global consciousness&quot; with physical systems. The project monitors a geographically distributed network of hardware random number generators in a bid to identify anomalous outputs that correlate with widespread emotional responses to sets of world events, or periods of focused attention by large numbers of people. The GCP is privately funded through the Institute of Noetic Sciences and describes itself as an international collaboration of about 100 research scientists and engineers.

Skeptics such as Robert T. Carroll, Claus Larsen, and others have questioned the methodology of the Global Consciousness Project, particularly how the data are selected and interpreted, saying the data anomalies reported by the project are the result of &quot;pattern matching&quot; and selection bias which ultimately fail to support a belief in psi or global consciousness. But in analyzing the data for 11 September 2001, May et al. concluded that the statistically significant result given by the published GCP hypothesis was fortuitous, and found that as far as this particular event was concerned an alternative method of analysis gave only chance deviations throughout.

==Background==
Roger D. Nelson developed the project as an extrapolation of two decades of experiments from the controversial Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR).

Nelson began using random event generator (REG) technology in the field to study effects of special states of group consciousness.

In an extension of the laboratory research utilizing hardware Random Event Generators (REG) called FieldREG, investigators examined the outputs of REGs in the field before, during and after highly focused or coherent group events. The group events studied included psychotherapy sessions, theater presentations, religious rituals, sports competitions such as the Football World Cup, and television broadcasts such as the Academy Awards.

FieldREG was extended to global dimensions in studies looking at data from 12 independent REGs in the US and Europe during a web-promoted &quot;Gaiamind Meditation&quot; in January 1997, and then again in September 1997 after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. The project claimed the results suggested it would be worthwhile to build a permanent network of continuously-running REGs. This became the EGG project or Global Consciousness Project.

Comparing the GCP to PEAR, Nelson, referring to the &quot;field&quot; studies with REGs done by PEAR, said the GCP used &quot;exactly the same procedure... applied on a broader scale.&quot;

==Methodology==
The GCP&#x27;s methodology is based on the hypothesis that events which elicit widespread emotion or draw the simultaneous attention of large numbers of people may affect the output of hardware random number generators in a statistically significant way. The GCP maintains a network of hardware random number generators which are interfaced to computers at 70 locations around the world. Custom software reads the output of the random number generators and records a trial (sum of 200 bits) once every second. The data are sent to a server in Princeton, creating a database of synchronized parallel sequences of random numbers. The GCP is run as a replication experiment, essentially combining the results of many distinct tests of the hypothesis. The hypothesis is tested by calculating the extent of data fluctuations at the time of events. The procedure is specified by a three-step experimental protocol. In the first step, the event duration and the calculation algorithm are pre-specified and entered into a formal registry. In the second step, the event data are extracted from the database and a Z score, which indicates the degree of deviation from the null hypothesis, is calculated from the pre-specified algorithm. In the third step, the event Z-score is combined with the Z-scores from previous events to yield an overall result for the experiment.

The remote devices have been dubbed &quot;Princeton Eggs&quot;, a reference to the coinage &quot;electrogaiagram&quot; (EGG), a portmanteau of electroencephalogram and Gaia. Supporters and skeptics have referred to the aim of the GCP as being analogous to detecting &quot;a great disturbance in the Force.&quot;

==Claims and criticism of effects from the September 11 terrorist attacks==
The GCP has suggested that changes in the level of randomness may have occurred during the September 11, 2001 attacks when the planes first impacted, as well as in the two days following the attacks.

Independent scientists Edwin May and James Spottiswoode conducted an analysis of the data around the September 11 attacks and concluded there was no statistically significant change in the randomness of the GCP data during the attacks and the apparent significant deviation reported by Nelson and Radin existed only in their chosen time window. Spikes and fluctuations are to be expected in any random distribution of data, and there is no set time frame for how close a spike has to be to a given event for the GCP to say they have found a correlation. 
Wolcotte Smith said &quot;A couple of additional statistical adjustments would have to be made to determine if there really was a spike in the numbers,&quot; referencing the data related to September 11, 2001. Similarly, Jeffrey D. Scargle believes unless both Bayesian and classical p-value analysis agree and both show the same anomalous effects, the kind of result GCP proposes will not be generally accepted.

In 2003, a &quot;New York Times&quot; article concluded &quot;All things considered at this point, the stock market seems a more reliable gauge of the national—if not the global—emotional resonance.&quot;

In 2007, &quot;The Age&quot; reported that &quot;[Nelson] concedes the data, so far, is not solid enough for global consciousness to be said to exist at all. It is not possible, for example, to look at the data and predict with any accuracy what (if anything) the eggs may be responding to.&quot;

Robert Matthews said that while it was &quot;the most sophisticated attempt yet&quot; to prove psychokinesis existed, the unreliability of significant events to cause statistically significant spikes meant that &quot;the only conclusion to emerge from the Global Consciousness Project so far is that data without a theory is as meaningless as words without a narrative&quot;.

Peter Bancel reviews the data in a 2017 article and &quot;finds that the data do not support the global consciousness proposal&quot; and rather &quot;All of the tests favor the interpretation of a goal-oriented effect.&quot;

==Roger D. Nelson==
Roger D. Nelson is an American parapsychologist and researcher and the director of the GCP. From 1980 to 2002, he was Coordinator of Research at the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) laboratory at Princeton University. His professional focus was the study of consciousness and intention and the role of the mind in the physical world. His work integrates science and spirituality , including research that is directly focused on numinous communal experiences.

Nelson&#x27;s professional degrees are in experimental cognitive psychology. Until his retirement in 2002, he served as the coordinator of experimental work in the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab (PEAR), directed by Robert Jahn in the department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, School of Engineering/Applied Science, Princeton University.

<text>Millwall Football Club () is a professional football club in Bermondsey, South East London, England. They compete in the EFL Championship, the second level of English football. Founded as Millwall Rovers in 1885, the club has retained its name despite having last played in the Millwall area of the Isle of Dogs in 1910. From then until 1993, the club played at what is now called The Old Den in New Cross, before moving to its current home stadium nearby, called The Den. The traditional club crest is a rampant lion, referred to in the team&#x27;s nickname &quot;The Lions&quot;. Millwall&#x27;s traditional kit consists of dark blue shirts, white shorts, and blue socks.

Millwall was one of the founding members of the Southern League in 1894. They competed in it for 22 seasons until 1920, claiming the title twice in 1895 and 1896. Since joining the Football League in the 1920–21 season, the club have been promoted 11 times (five times as champions in 1928, 1938, 1962, 1988, and 2001) and relegated nine times. They have spent 91 of their 98 seasons in the Football League yo-yoing between the second and third tiers. The club had a brief spell in the top flight between 1988 and 1990, in which they achieved their highest ever league finish of tenth place in the Football League First Division in 1988–89. Millwall reached the 2004 FA Cup Final and qualified for UEFA competitions for the first time in their history, playing in the UEFA Cup. The club have also won two League One play-off finals in 2010 and 2017, the Football League Group Cup in 1983, and were Football League Trophy finalists in 1999.

Millwall&#x27;s supporters have often been associated with hooliganism, with numerous films made fictionalising their notoriety. The fans are renowned for their terrace chant &quot;No one likes us, we don&#x27;t care&quot;. Millwall have a long-standing rivalry with Premier League side West Ham United. The local derby between the two sides has been contested almost 100 times since 1899. Millwall also share a rivalry with Leeds United, and contest the South London derby which can also sometimes be referred to as the South East London derby for geographical reasons with local rivals in the district Crystal Palace and Charlton Athletic.

==History==


===Beginnings, Southern League and relocation: 1885–1920===
The club was founded as Millwall Rovers by the workers of J.T. Morton&#x27;s canning and preserve factory in the Millwall area of the Isle of Dogs in London&#x27;s East End in 1885. J.T. Morton was founded in Aberdeen in 1849 to supply sailing ships with food, the company opened their first English cannery and food processing plant at Millwall dock in 1872 and attracted a workforce from across the country, including the east coast of Scotland, primarily Dundee. The club secretary was 17-year-old Jasper Sexton, the son of the landlord of The Islander pub in Tooke Street where Millwall held their club meetings. Millwall Rovers&#x27; first game was an away fixture held on 3 October 1885 against Fillebrook, a team that played in Leytonstone. The newly formed team were beaten 5–0. Millwall&#x27;s first home game was on a piece of waste ground on Glengall Road against St Luke&#x27;s, on 24 October 1885, which they won 2–1.

Rovers found a better playing surface for the 1886–87 season, at the rear of the Lord Nelson pub and it became known as the Lord Nelson Ground. In November 1886, the East End Football Association was formed, along with the Senior Cup Competition. Millwall made it to the final against London Caledonians, which was played at Leyton Cricket Ground. The match finished 2–2 and the teams shared the cup for six months each. Millwall won the East London Senior Cup at the first attempt. The club also won the cup in the following two years, and the trophy became their property.

In April 1889, a resolution was passed for Millwall to drop &quot;Rovers&quot; from their name, and they began playing under the name Millwall Athletic, inspired by their move to their new home The Athletic Grounds. They were founding members of the Southern Football League which they won for the first two years of its existence, and were runners-up in its third. During this period the club was invited to join the Second Division of the Football League but the committee turned down the opportunity, partly due to the expected increase in travel expenses but also to stay loyal to the Southern League. They were forced to move to a new ground North Greenwich in 1901, as the Millwall Dock Company wanted to use their land as a timberyard. Millwall Athletic reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1900 and 1903, and were also champions of the Western Football League in 1908 and 1909. On 10 October 1910, Millwall played their last game as an East London club against Woolwich Arsenal in the London Challenge Cup. Millwall won the game 1–0 in front of a crowd of 3000.

Millwall moved to a new stadium, named The Den, in New Cross, South East London in 1910. The club had previously occupied four different grounds in the 25 years since their formation in East London; limited expansion space on the Isle of Dogs meant The Lions had to move to boost support and attendances. The estimated cost of The Den was £10,000. The first match played at the new ground was on 22 October 1910 against reigning Southern League champions Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, who won 1–0.

===Entering the Football League: 1920–1940===
Millwall, who had now also dropped &quot;Athletic&quot; from their name, were invited to join the Football League in 1920 for the 1920–21 season, along with 22 other clubs, through the creation of the new Football League Third Division. The Southern League was shorn of its status, with almost all its clubs deciding to leave—Millwall followed suit. Millwall&#x27;s first Football League match was on 28 August 1920 at The Den, and they were 2–0 winners against Bristol Rovers.

In the 1925–26 season Millwall had 11 consecutive clean sheets, a Football League record, which they hold jointly with York City and Reading. Millwall became known as a hard-fighting Cup team and competed in various memorable matches, notably defeating three-time league winners and reigning champions Huddersfield Town 3–1 in the third round of the 1926–27 FA Cup. In the 1927–28 season Millwall won the Third Division South title and scored 87 goals at home in the league, an English record which still stands. Matches against Sunderland and Derby County saw packed crowds of 48,000-plus in the 1930s and 1940s. Their 1937 FA Cup run saw Millwall reach the semi-finals for the third time, and a fifth-round game against Derby still stands as Millwall&#x27;s record attendance of 48,762. Millwall were the 11th best supported team in England in 1939, despite being in the Second Division. Millwall were one of the most financially wealthy clubs in England. The club proposed plans to improve the Den and signed international players. Winger Reg &#x27;JR&#x27; Smith was capped twice, scoring two goals for England in 1938. The Lions were pushing for promotion to the First Division toward the end of the decade, but one week into the 1939–40 season, World War II broke out and Millwall were robbed of their aim.

===Wartime doldrums and relegation to fourth tier: 1940–1965===
On 7 April 1945, Millwall appeared in a Football League War Cup final at Wembley Stadium against Chelsea, but because it was a wartime cup final it is not acknowledged in the record books. With the war in Europe in its last days, the number of spectators allowed to attend games was relaxed. The attendance was 90,000, the largest crowd Millwall have ever played in front of, which included King George VI, whom the team were introduced to before kick-off.

The loss of so many young men during the Second World War made it difficult for clubs to retain their former status. This was especially true for Millwall, who appeared to suffer more than most. The Den sustained severe bomb damage on 19 April 1943, and one week later a fire, determined to have been caused by a discarded cigarette, also destroyed an entire stand. The club accepted offers from neighbours Charlton Athletic, Crystal Palace and West Ham United to stage games at their grounds. On 24 February 1944, Millwall returned to The Den, to play in an all-standing stadium. This was achieved with considerable volunteer labour by Lions fans.

Millwall&#x27;s fortunes fluctuated in the immediate post war years, they were relegated to Division Three South in 1948 and had to apply for re-election to the league in 1950 after finishing in the bottom two. An upswing in fortunes saw Millwall finish 5th, 4th, and then runners up in Division Three South in 1952–53 season; but with only the Champions being promoted, Millwall found themselves stuck in the third tier despite averaging crowds of over 20,000. Millwall then suffered a down swing in fortunes with a number of bottom-half finishes. One highlight of the period was one of the biggest giant-killing upsets in the Fourth Round of the 1956–57 FA Cup on 26 January 1957, when Millwall beat Newcastle United 2–1 in front of a crowd of 45,646. Millwall suffered the ill fortune of becoming a founding member of Division Four in 1958. While initially suffering from this reorganisation, the de-regionalisation of Third Division North and Third Division South opened up the way for promotion via the runner up spots. Millwall won the Division Four Title in 1962 with the help of 23 Goals from Peter Burridge and 22 from Dave Jones. They were relegated again in the 1963–64 season, but were to bounce back by winning back-to-back promotions as runner up. This is the last time Millwall played in the fourth tier.

===Unbeaten home record and the class of &#x27;71: 1965–1987===
Later in the decade, Millwall established a record of 59 home games without defeat (43 wins and 16 draws) from 22 August 1964 to 14 January 1967. During this spell, Millwall played 55 different teams, kept 35 clean sheets, scored 112 goals and conceded 33. This was thanks largely to managers Billy Gray, who laid the foundations, and Benny Fenton, a former player who continued to build on Gray&#x27;s side. All the players, which included winger Barry Rowan, goalkeeper Alex Stepney, defender Tom Wilson and strikers Hugh Curran and Len Julians, were presented with a commemorative gold cigarette lighter by the Football Association. The record was eventually broken by Liverpool, who were unbeaten for 63 games at home between 1978 and 1981. This era was also notable for the appearance of Frank Peterson on 30 November 1968 in an away game at Portsmouth, Peterson was the first Black player to represent the club.

In the early 1970s, the Millwall team included many notable and memorable players, now remembered by some fans as &quot;The Class of &#x27;71&quot;. This was a team that included; goalkeeper Bryan King, defender Harry Cripps, goalscoring midfielder Derek Possee, Millwall&#x27;s most capped international player to date, Eamon Dunphy and the club&#x27;s longest serving player, Barry Kitchener. They missed out on promotion to Division One by one point. By remaining unbeaten at home in Division Two for the 1971–72 season, Millwall became the only club to go through an entire season without losing a match at home in four different divisions 1927–28 Division Three South, 1964–65 Division Four, 1965–66 Division Three and 1971–72 Division Two. In 1974, Millwall hosted the first game to be played on a Sunday against Fulham. The Lions reached the quarter-finals of the League Cup in 1974, and again in 1977.

George Graham managed Millwall from 1983 to 1986, and during that time he guided the club to a Football League Group Cup win, beating Lincoln City 3–2 in the final in the 1982–83 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;82/83&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 1984–85 season was particularly successful, Millwall reached the FA Cup quarter-finals and gained promotion to the Second Division, going unbeaten at home again in Division Three, winning 18 games and drawing five.&lt;ref name=&quot;84/85&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the FA Cup they were beaten 1–0 by First Division Luton Town at Kenilworth Road. The match is remembered for all the wrong reasons, after hooligans rioted at the game. 81 people (including 31 police officers) were injured in the disturbances.

===Promotion to top tier, new stadium, and administration: 1987–2000===
Graham&#x27;s replacement was Glaswegian John Docherty. In his second season as manager, Millwall won the Second Division championship and gained promotion to the top flight of English football for the first time in the club&#x27;s history.&lt;ref name=&quot;1987/88 Season&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Starting the 1988–89 season strongly, Millwall topped the league on 1 October 1988 having played six games (winning four and drawing two) and rarely slipped out of the top five before Christmas. This was mainly due to Tony Cascarino and Teddy Sheringham, who scored 99 goals between them in three seasons playing together. Millwall&#x27;s first top division season ended with a tenth-place finish, which was the lowest place occupied by the club all season. The following season, they briefly led the league for one night in September 1989 after beating Coventry City 4–1, but won only two more games all season and were relegated in 20th place at the end of the 1989–90 season.

Just before relegation was confirmed, Docherty was sacked and replaced by ex-Middlesbrough manager Bruce Rioch. Striker Teddy Sheringham, who later played for England and was the highest-scoring player throughout the Football League in the 1990–91 season, was sold to Nottingham Forest for £2 million after Millwall&#x27;s 6–2 defeat to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in the Second Division play-offs. Rioch left Millwall in 1992 to be succeeded by Irish defender Mick McCarthy. McCarthy guided Millwall to third place in the new Division One at the end of the 1993–94 season. This was their first season at a new ground, at first known as The New Den (to distinguish it from its predecessor) but now called simply The Den, which was opened by the Labour party leader John Smith on 4 August 1993. The new ground was the first all-seater stadium to be built in England after the Taylor report on the Hillsborough disaster. The Lions knocked Arsenal out of the 1994–95 FA Cup in a third-round replay, beating them 2–0 at Highbury. They also reached the quarter-finals of the League Cup in 1995. Millwall lost 5–1 on aggregate to Derby County in the play-off semi-finals that same 1994–95 season, in a tie blighted by crowd trouble. McCarthy resigned to take charge of the Republic of Ireland national team on 5 February 1996, shortly after Millwall had been knocked off the top of the Division One table by Sunderland, following a 6–0 defeat.

Jimmy Nicholl of Raith Rovers was appointed as McCarthy&#x27;s replacement, but could not reverse the slump in form which saw Millwall relegated at the end of the 1995–96 season in 22nd place. Just five months earlier they had been top of Division One, but now Millwall found themselves in the third tier for the 1996–97 season. The club experienced severe financial difficulties that resulted in them being placed in financial administration for a short time. Nicholl was relieved of his duties and John Docherty returned on a short-term basis to stabilise the club.

Millwall came out of administration, and new chairman Theo Paphitis appointed ex-West Ham United manager Billy Bonds as manager. The 1997–98 season was not a successful one, with the club hovering close to relegation to the fourth tier. Bonds was sacked and replaced by Keith &quot;Rhino&quot; Stevens, with Alan McLeary as his assistant. McLeary was later promoted to the role of joint-manager alongside Stevens. Stevens and McLeary led Millwall to their first ever official appearance at Wembley Stadium. The Lions reached the 1999 Football League Trophy Final with a golden goal win against Gillingham in the semi-finals, and a 2–1 aggregate victory over Walsall in the regional final. They faced Wigan Athletic in the final but, while playing in front of 49,000 of their own fans, lost 1–0 to an injury-time goal. Millwall finished 5th and lost 1–0 on aggregate to Wigan in the Second Division play-off semi-finals of the 1999–2000 season, their third play-off semi-final loss.

===Champions, FA Cup Final, and European football: 2000–2007===
Mark McGhee was named as Millwall&#x27;s new manager for the 2000–01 season in September 2000, and eight months later the club won promotion as Division Two champions. They finished with 93 points, a club record, with striker Neil Harris winning the golden boot with 27 league goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Millwall 00/01 Season&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Winning the first match of the 2001–02 season 4–0 at home to Norwich City set the team up well for a good year, in which Millwall finished 4th and qualified for the Division One play-offs, but lost to eventual winners Birmingham City 2–1 in the semi-finals. Millwall finished 9th in the 2002–03 season, but McGhee left Millwall by &quot;mutual consent&quot; in October.

In October 2003, Dennis Wise, ex-Chelsea and England player, became caretaker, and subsequently permanent player-manager, of the club for the 2003-04 season. In his first season in charge Wise led the team to finish four points off of the play-offs, and to the first FA Cup Final in their history. Millwall played Sunderland in the semi-final at Old Trafford, with Tim Cahill, who finished the season as Millwall&#x27;s top scorer, scoring the winning goal, to set up a final against Manchester United. When Millwall took to the field at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on 22 May 2004 they were only the second team from outside the top flight to play in the Cup final since 1982, and were the first team from outside the Premier League to reach the final since the foundation of the top tier in 1992. The club was missing 16 players from their squad due to suspension or injury, but kept the score at 0-0 until 1 minute before half-time when Gary Neville&#x27;s cross was headed in by Cristiano Ronaldo. Millwall eventually lost the 2004 FA Cup Final 3–0. As United had already qualified for the UEFA Champions League, Millwall were assured of playing in the UEFA Cup. Midfielder Curtis Weston, substituted for Wise with one minute of normal time remaining, became the youngest Cup final player in history at 17 years 119 days, beating the 125-year-old record of James F. M. Prinsep. In the 2004–05 UEFA Cup, Millwall lost 4–2 on aggregate in the first round proper to Hungarian champions Ferencváros, with Wise scoring both Millwall&#x27;s goals.

In 2005, Theo Paphitis announced that he was stepping down as chairman of the club with Jeff Burnige to replace him from May 2005. At the end of the 2004–05 season, manager Dennis Wise announced that he was leaving as he was unable to form a working relationship with the new chairman. Former Millwall striker Steve Claridge was announced as the new player-manager of Millwall. However, when Burnige then stepped down just two months after taking up the post, it was announced on 27 July that Claridge had been sacked after just 36 days, without ever taking charge of the team in a competitive match. Former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Colin Lee replaced him but lasted only five months in charge of the club.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee/Claridge&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December, with the club bottom of the Championship, he became the club&#x27;s Director of Football and was replaced as manager by 32-year-old player Dave Tuttle, on a short-term contract until the end of the 2005–06 season. Millwall experienced a tough season, having had four managers. Their 13 goals scored at home was the second worst in Football League history. Their relegation to League One was confirmed on 17 April 2006 with a 2–0 loss against Southampton. In the closed season Nigel Spackman was appointed as the new manager, but he lasted only four months after a string of bad results. In September 2006, Theo Paphitis (chairman from 1997 to 2005) ended his nine-year association with the club after a year-long spell as a non-executive director. On 19 March 2007, Willie Donachie signed a two-year contract following some progress in the latter half of 2006-07 which had seen the club climb to 11th place in the league. Before Donachie took charge, Millwall had taken only six points from their first ten games. In the 2007–08 season Millwall sat bottom of the table at the beginning of October. Donachie was sacked on 8 October, with Richard Shaw and Colin West becoming caretaker managers.

===New owner, stability, and first play-off success: 2007–2014===
In March 2007, Chestnut Hill Ventures, led by American and future chairman John Berylson, invested £5 million into the club. Millwall appointed Kenny Jackett as new manager on 6 November 2007. Over the course of the next two seasons, Jackett led Millwall to two top six finishes in League One, in fifth and third place respectively. He won the League One Manager of the Month award three times while in charge of the club. On 13 January 2009, Harris broke Teddy Sheringham&#x27;s all-time goal scoring record for Millwall during the 3–2 away win against Crewe Alexandra with his 112th goal for the club. After a play-off final defeat in the 2008–09 season against Scunthorpe United and losing out on automatic promotion on the last day of the 2009–10 season to Leeds United by one point, Millwall made it back to Wembley, finally breaking the play-off hoodoo run of five successive failures in 1991, 1994, 2000, 2002 and 2009, with a 1–0 win in the 2010 League One play-off final against Swindon Town, securing a return to the Football League Championship after a four-year absence.

Millwall&#x27;s first game back in the Championship was a 3–0 away win at Bristol City. The game had been much hyped due to City&#x27;s signing of then-England goalkeeper David James. Only days after the defeat, Steve Coppell resigned as City manager. The Lions celebrated the 125th anniversary of the club on 2 October 2010, which was the closest home game date to the first fixture Millwall ever played against Fillebrook on 3 October 1885. Millwall drew 1–1 with Burnley and wore a special one-off kit for the game, made by manufacturers Macron, which bore the names of every footballer who had played for the club. Prior to the start of the 2011-12 season, Neil Harris left the club for the second time, departing as Millwall&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer with 138 goals

Kenny Jackett celebrated five years in charge of the club in November 2012, with a 4–1 victory away at Nottingham Forest. After a strong start to the 2012–13 season, including a 13-game unbeaten run and flirting with the play-offs, Millwall finished poorly, with only five wins in the last 23 games, narrowly avoiding relegation on the last day of the season. Their poor league form coincided with reaching the semi-final of the FA Cup for the fifth time in their history. They played Wigan Athletic at Wembley Stadium on 14 April 2013, losing 2–0 to the eventual cup winners. Kenny Jackett resigned on 7 May 2013. He was Millwall&#x27;s fourth-longest serving manager having managed 306 games. After a month of searching, Millwall appointed St Johnstone boss Steve Lomas as their new manager on 6 June 2013. His appointment provoked mixed emotions among some supporters, due to him being a former captain of West Ham United, their biggest rival. Club record goalscorer Neil Harris returned to Millwall for a third time as a coach on 23 June 2013 after retiring as a player through injury. Millwall sacked Lomas on 26 December 2013, after winning only five of his first 22 games in charge. Harris and youth team coach Scott Fitzgerald took over as joint caretaker-managers.

===Harris&#x27; return, play-offs, and FA Cup giant-killers: 2014–2019===
The club appointed Ian Holloway as their new manager on 6 January 2014, with the club sitting 21st in the Championship table. He was given the priority of maintaining their Football League Championship status, which he achieved. Millwall went unbeaten in the last eight games of the 2013–14 season and finished in 19th place, four points above the relegation zone. The following season, Holloway was sacked on 10 March 2015 with the team second from bottom in the Championship, and Neil Harris was reinstated as caretaker manager until the end of the season. He was unable to ensure survival, however, as Millwall&#x27;s relegation to League One was confirmed on 28 April with one game of the 2014–15 season still to play. Harris was confirmed as Millwall&#x27;s permanent manager the next day. In his first full season in charge, Harris led Millwall to a fourth-place finish in League One and a play-off final at Wembley, which the Lions lost 3–1 to Barnsley.

In the 2016–17 FA Cup, Millwall reached the Quarter-finals for the tenth time in their history, knocking out Premier League opposition in three consecutive rounds: Bournemouth in the third round, Watford in the fourth round, and reigning Premier League champions Leicester City in the fifth round. On 28 February 2017, Millwall beat Peterborough United 1–0, increasing their unbeaten run to 16 games in all competitions, and going nine games without conceding a goal for the first time since the 1925–26 season. Millwall made it to the League One play-off final at Wembley for the second successive year, after beating Scunthorpe United 3–2 in the semi-final. They were promoted back to the Championship following a 1–0 playoff final victory over Bradford City, thanks to an 85th-minute winner from Steve Morison, his 86th goal for the club.

In Millwall&#x27;s return to the Championship in the 2017–18 season the team went on a club record 17-game unbeaten run; their longest streak in the second tier, which surpassed a record of 15 set in 1971. During the undefeated run they won six consecutive away games, equalling a club record set in the 2008–09 season. In the 2018–19 FA Cup, Millwall reached the Quarter-finals for an 11th time in their history, losing to Premier League side Brighton on penalties. In the previous round they knocked out Premier League side Everton, to equal Southampton&#x27;s FA Cup &#x27;Giant-killings&#x27; record, having knocked out 25 top-flight teams when not in the top flight themselves. This season Millwall broke their club transfer fee record twice, firstly buying Tom Bradshaw from Barnsley for £1.25 million, and then a week later buying midfielder Ryan Leonard from Sheffield United for £1.5 million. They also broke their record received for a player, selling George Saville to Middlesbrough for £8 million.

On 3 October 2019, Neil Harris resigned as Millwall manager with the club sitting in 18th place with two wins from their first ten Championship games. Harris led Millwall to Wembley twice, with one promotion, and to two FA Cup quarter-finals during his tenure. He was the Lions fifth longest-serving manager, having spent four and a half years at the club, managing 248 games.

===Rowett era, death of chairman and instability: 2019–2024===
On 21 October 2019, Harris was replaced by former Stoke City boss Gary Rowett. Rowett inspired a dramatic upturn in form; losing only two matches of his first 15 league games, which saw the 2019–20 season end in an 8th-placed finish, just two points off the play-offs. Rowett guided the club to a mid-table 11th place in his second season in charge. This season marked the first time in Millwall&#x27;s history that they played more seasons in the second tier (44) than the third tier (43). The following 2021–22 season saw an improved 9th-place finish, missing out on the play-offs on the final day of the season. Millwall went close again in 2022–23. Millwall required a win on the final day of the season to secure a play-off spot but gave up a 3–1 lead, losing 4–3 to Blackburn Rovers and eventually finishing 8th.

On 4 July 2023, the club announced the death of owner and chairman John Berylson, who died in a car accident. The 70-year-old was driving in Falmouth, Massachusetts, lost control of his Range Rover and hit a tree. He died at the scene. A club statement remarked &quot;Under John&#x27;s passionate leadership and guidance, Millwall Football Club has enjoyed tremendous success and stability. Since first becoming involved in the club in 2006, he has presided over some of the greatest moments in Millwall&#x27;s history, and his influence in providing the platform for those was immeasurable...any success moving forward will be in his memory and honour. It will be his legacy.&quot; His son, James, was named as his replacement as chairman. On 18 October 2023, the club announced it had mutually agreed to part company with first team manager Gary Rowett with assistant manager Adam Barrett taking over as interim manager. On 6 November 2023, Millwall confirmed England under-20s manager Joe Edwards as their new Head Coach. In his debut game, Edwards led Millwall to a 4–0 win at Sheffield Wednesday, the Lions&#x27; largest away win in the second tier for 22 years. After a 2–0 home defeat by Sheffield Wednesday, and just four wins in 19 games, Edwards was sacked by Millwall on 21 February 2024. He was replaced by former player and record club goalscorer Neil Harris, his third spell in charge of the Lions. Under Harris, the club gained 26 points from 13 games to finish 13th, ending the season with a 1–0 away victory at Swansea City - part of a five-game winning streak.

On 15 June 2024, the club&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper Matija Sarkic died while on international duty with Montenegro.

On 10 December 2024, with Millwall 11th in the Championship, Harris said he would be leaving the club following the side&#x27;s match at Middlesbrough on 14 December. David Livermore served as caretaker manager for three games until Alex Neil was appointed Harris&#x27;s successor on 30 December 2024. Neil lost his first game in charge as Millwall were defeated 1–0 by an Oxford United side managed by former Lions manager Gary Rowett.
==Colours, crest and nickname==
===Kit===

Millwall&#x27;s traditional kit has predominantly consisted of blue shirts, white shorts and blue socks throughout their 125-year history. For the first 50 years, up until 1936, they played in a traditional navy blue, similar to the colours of Scotland national team. This colour was chosen because it paid homage to the Scottish roots of the club, with the nucleus of the first Millwall Rovers squad being from Dundee. In 1936, newly appointed Millwall manager Charlie Hewitt opted to change the kit colour from navy blue to a lighter royal blue, and the team played in this colour for the best part of 74 years, with the exception of 1968–75 and 1999–2001, in which the team played in an all-white strip. Their kit for the 2010–11 season celebrated the 125th anniversary of the club, with Millwall adopting the darker navy blue of their first strip. The club has retained this colour since. As for change colours, white shirts and blue shorts or yellow shirts and black shorts have been the Lions primary away colours. They have also played in red and black stripes, all grey, all orange, all red, and green and white stripes. Millwall wore a special one-off camouflage kit to commemorate the centenary of the First World War against Brentford on 8 November 2014. It went on sale to fans, with proceeds going to Headley Court, a rehabilitation centre for injured members of the British Armed Forces.

===Badge===
The club crest has been a rampant lion since 1936, which was also introduced by Charlie Hewitt. There have been many variations of the lion; the first was a single red lion, often mistakenly said to be chosen because of the club&#x27;s Scottish roots. The lion bore a striking resemblance to signs used by pubs named The Red Lion. From 1956 to 1974 Millwall&#x27;s crest was two leaping red lions facing each other. Former chairman Theo Paphitis brought back the badge in 1999, where it was used for a further eight years. The current crest is a leaping lion, which first appeared on a Millwall kit in 1979. It remained until 1999 and was re-introduced again in 2007. The club mascot is a giant lion called Zampa, named after Zampa Road, the road The Den is located on.

===The Lions===
The team nickname is The Lions, previously The Dockers. The original Dockers name arose from the job of many of the club&#x27;s supporters in the early 1900s. The club did not like the nickname and changed it after press headlined Millwall as &#x27;Lions of the South&#x27;, after knocking Football League leaders Aston Villa out of the 1899–1900 FA Cup. Millwall, then a Southern League side, went on to reach the semi-final. The club adopted the motto: &quot;We Fear No Foe Where E&#x27;er We Go&quot;. In the 2000s the club started to recognise its unique link with London docks by introducing Dockers&#x27; Days, and archiving the club&#x27;s dock roots in the Millwall FC Museum. Dockers&#x27; Days bring together past successful Millwall teams who parade on the pitch at half-time. Supporters who were dockers are allowed to attend the game without charge. In 2011, Millwall officially named the east stand of The Den as the &#x27;Dockers Stand&#x27; in honour of the club&#x27;s former nickname.

===Kit sponsors and manufacturers===
For the 2013–14 season, Millwall chose the charity Prostate Cancer UK to sponsor their shirt for free.


==Stadiums==
===History===

Millwall began life on the Isle of Dogs and inhabited four different grounds in the club&#x27;s first 25 years. Their first home was a piece of waste ground called Glengall Road, where they only stayed for one year. From 1886 to 1890 they played behind The Lord Nelson pub on East Ferry Road, which was known as the Lord Nelson Ground, before being forced to leave by the landlady, who received a better offer for its use.

They moved to their third home, The Athletic Grounds, on 6 September 1890. This was their first purpose-built ground, with a grandstand that seated 600 people and an overall capacity of between 10,000 and 15,000. The club was forced to move on again though, this time by the Millwall Dock Company who wanted to use it as a timberyard. They relocated in 1901 to a location near their second home, which became known as North Greenwich. They remained an east London club for a further nine years, with the last game played on the Isle of Dogs on 8 October 1910 against Portsmouth, which Millwall won 3–1.

On 22 October 1910, Millwall crossed the river to South East London, moving to Cold Blow Lane in New Cross. The fifth ground was called The Den, built at a cost of £10,000 by noted football ground architect Archibald Leitch. The first game played there was against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, which Brighton won 1–0. Millwall remained there for 83 years, until moving to their sixth and current ground, at first known as The New Den but now called simply The Den, on 4 August 1993. The ground has an all-seated capacity of 20,146. A Sporting CP team, managed by Bobby Robson helped open the ground by playing a friendly, which The Lions lost 2–1.

===Bermondsey redevelopment controversy and the Den&#x27;s future===
In September 2016 Lewisham Council approved a compulsory purchase order (CPO) of land surrounding The Den rented by Millwall, as part of a major redevelopment of the &quot;New Bermondsey&quot; area. The plans were controversial because the developer, Renewal, is controlled by offshore companies with unclear ownership, and is seen by the club and local community to be profiteering by demolishing existing homes and businesses as well as Millwall&#x27;s car-park and the Millwall Community Trust facility to build up to 2,400 new private homes, with no social housing. The club contemplated the possibility of having to relocate to Kent. Millwall had submitted their own plans for regeneration centred around the club itself, but the council voted in favour of Renewal&#x27;s plans. In December 2016 &quot;Private Eye&quot; reported how Renewal had been founded by a former Lewisham Council leader and senior officer, suggesting potential bias, and that the decision to approve Renewal&#x27;s plans may have been made as far back as 2013 despite the fact that no due diligence had been able to be carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers due to &quot;poor&quot; and &quot;limited&quot; access to information and management at Renewal, which is controlled from the Isle of Man and British Virgin Islands. In the face of mounting community opposition and media scrutiny, the Council said in January 2017 it will not proceed with the CPO. However, it was later reported to be taking legal advice regarding other avenues of securing the CPO, and Council cabinet members will decide how to proceed after a &quot;review&quot;. &quot;Private Eye&quot; reported that Millwall are continuing to explore relocation options in Kent.

On 9 May 2024, Millwall secured a 999-year lease for The Den from the council, after approval from the Mayor of Lewisham. The new lease secured the clubs future in London and removed restrictions on developing the area surrounding the stadium, also giving Millwall development rights to build new homes, leisure and community spaces in New Bermondsey.

==Traditional songs==
A tradition at The Den is the playing of the official club song &quot;Let &#x27;em Come&quot;, by Roy Green, as Millwall and the opposing team walk onto the pitch. It was specifically written for the club and the lyrics represent old London culture, such as eating jellied eels and having a glass of beer before going to the game. The song ends with all home fans standing, arms raised (usually in the direction of the travelling fans singing the last line, &quot;Let &#x27;em all... come down... to The Den!&quot; A television drama about a Millwall supporter and ex-docker, starring David Jason, featured a lyric from the song in its title, &quot;Come Rain Come Shine&quot;. The song was played on repeat at Wembley Stadium after Millwall gained promotion to the Championship in 2010. The song &quot;Shoeshine Boy&quot; by the Mills Blue Rhythm Band was played as the entrance song before &quot;Let &#x27;em Come&quot;.

Other songs that have been regularly played at The Den over the years in the build-up to a game include &quot;London Calling&quot; by The Clash, &quot;No Surrender&quot; by Bruce Springsteen, &quot;Town Called Malice&quot; by The Jam and &quot;House of Fun&quot; by Madness, which features the lyric &quot;welcome to the lion&#x27;s den...&quot;. Status Quo&#x27;s cover version of &quot;Rockin&#x27; All Over the World&quot; is played after every home win.

==Rivalries==
Millwall were listed eighth out of a list of 92 Football League clubs with the most rivals, with West Ham United, Leeds United, Crystal Palace, and Charlton Athletic considering them a major rival. Portsmouth, Everton and Gillingham also share minor rivalries with Millwall, with hooliganism between their fans dating back to the 1970s.

===Major rivalry with West Ham United===

Millwall&#x27;s fiercest rival is West Ham United. It is one of the most passionately contested local derbies in football. The two clubs have rarely met in recent years due to them playing in different leagues; the majority of their meetings happened before the First World War, with some 60 meetings between 1899 and 1915. The clubs have played 99 times since the first contest in 1899. Millwall have won 38, drawn 27 and lost 34. Despite violence between the two sets of supporters and calls for future games between the clubs to be played behind closed doors, they last met in the Football League Championship in 2011–12 with no outright ban on either set of fans, and no repeat of crowd trouble. The rivalry between the sides, specifically the clubs&#x27; two hooligan firms has been depicted on the big screen several times, in films such as &quot;Green Street&quot;.

===Rivalry with Leeds United===

Millwall share a fierce rivalry with Leeds United. The rivalry between the teams is intensified by both clubs&#x27; passionate fans and association with football hooliganism. The clubs&#x27; two hooligan firms, the Leeds United Service Crew and the Millwall Bushwackers, were notorious in the 1970s and 80s for their violence, being called &quot;dirty Leeds&quot; and &quot;the scourge of football&quot; respectively. From 1920 to 2003 the sides met just 12 times; competing in different tiers for the majority of their histories, and neither considering the other a rival on the pitch. Since Leeds were relegated from the Premier League in 2004, the teams have met 28 times in 16 years. The rivalry began in League One during the 2007–08 season, with disorder and violent clashes between both sets of fans and the police at Elland Road. It continued into the 2008–09 season; where the teams were vying for promotion to the Championship, culminating in Millwall knocking Leeds out of the League One playoffs at the semi-final stage. In 43 games between the two clubs since 1931, Millwall and Leeds are tied with 19 wins each, with five drawn.

===South East London derbies===

Millwall are closest in proximity to Charlton Athletic, with The Den and The Valley being less than four miles () apart. They last met in July 2020, a 1–0 win for Millwall at the Valley. Since their first competitive game in 1921, Millwall have won 37, drawn 26 and lost 12. The Lions are unbeaten in their last twelve games against Charlton, spanning 24 years, where they have won seven and drawn five. The Addicks last win came in March 1996 at The Valley. The Lions last played against fellow South East London club Crystal Palace in the 2021–22 season in an FA Cup tie at The Den, which resulted in a 2–1 loss. In almost 100 competitive games between the two clubs since 1906, Millwall have won 39, drawn 29 and lost 29.

Bob Hunter is Millwall&#x27;s longest serving manager, having stayed at the helm for 15 years. Prior to becoming manager, he was the club&#x27;s trainer for 21 years. He died in office in 1933, having served at the club for a total of 36 years. Steve Claridge holds the shortest tenure at the club, having been in charge for a period of 36 days without ever taking charge of a first-team game.

==Records and statistics==

Barry Kitchener holds the record for Millwall appearances, having played 596 matches between 1966 and 1982. The goalscoring record is held by former manager Neil Harris, with 138 in all competitions. He broke the previous record of 111 goals, held by Teddy Sheringham on 13 January 2009, during a 3–2 away win at Crewe Alexandra. The club&#x27;s widest victory margin in the league is 9–1, a scoreline which they achieved twice in their Football League Third Division South championship-winning year of 1927. They beat both Torquay United and Coventry City by this score at The Den. Millwall&#x27;s heaviest league defeat was 8–1 away to Plymouth Argyle in 1932. The club&#x27;s heaviest loss in all competitions was a 9–1 defeat at Aston Villa in an FA Cup fourth-round second-leg in 1946. Millwall&#x27;s largest Cup win was 7–0 over Gateshead in 1936. Their highest scoring aggregate game was a 12-goal thriller at home to Preston North End in 1930 when Millwall lost 7–5.

==Millwall in European football==

On 22 May 2004 Millwall played Manchester United in the FA Cup Final, losing 3–0. As United had already qualified for the UEFA Champions League, Millwall were assured of playing in the UEFA Cup. Millwall played in the first round proper and lost 4–2 on aggregate to Ferencváros.

===European record===
==Supporters and hooliganism==


Millwall have averaged a gate close to 12,000 per home game over their 93 seasons in the Football League, while the club have spent the majority of that time yo-yoing back and forth between the second and third tiers of English football. Originally based in the East End of London, the club moved across the River Thames in 1910 to south east London and support is drawn from the surrounding areas. The club and fans have a historic association with football hooliganism, which came to prevalence in the 1970s and 1980s with a firm known originally as F-Troop, eventually becoming more widely known as the Millwall Bushwackers, who were one of the most notorious hooligan gangs in England. On five occasions The Den was closed by The FA and the club has received numerous fines for crowd disorder. The BBC documentary &quot;Panorama&quot; was invited into the club by Millwall in 1977 to show the hooligan reputation was a myth and being blown out of proportion by reporting. Instead the BBC portrayed hooliganism as being deeply rooted in Millwall, and linked them to the far-right political party National Front. The show was extremely damaging for the club. Former club chairman Reg Burr once commented: &quot;Millwall are a convenient coat peg for football to hang its social ills on&quot;, an example being the reporting of convicted murderer Gavin Grant. Although he had played for eight different clubs, playing his fewest games (four) for Millwall, and was signed to Bradford City at the time, the BBC used the headline, &quot;Former Millwall striker Gavin Grant guilty of murder&quot;.

The stigma of violence attached to Millwall can be traced back over 100 years. Millwall played local rivals West Ham United away at Upton Park on 17 September 1906 in a Western League game. Both sets of supporters were primarily made up of dockers, who lived and worked in the same locality in east London. Many were rivals working for opposing firms and vying for the same business. A local newspaper, &quot;East Ham Echo&quot;, reported that, &quot;From the very first kick of the ball it was seen likely to be some trouble, but the storm burst when Dean and Jarvis came into collision (Millwall had two players sent off during the match). This aroused considerable excitement among the spectators. The crowds on the bank having caught the fever, free fights were plentiful.&quot; In the 1920s Millwall&#x27;s ground was closed for two weeks after a Newport County goalkeeper, who had been struck by missiles, jumped into the crowd to confront some of the home supporters and was knocked unconscious. The ground was again closed for two weeks in 1934 following crowd disturbances after the visit of Bradford Park Avenue. Pitch invasions resulted in another closure in 1947 and in 1950 the club was fined after a referee and linesman were ambushed outside the ground.

In the 1960s, hooliganism in England became more widely reported. On 6 November 1965 Millwall beat west London club Brentford 2–1 away at Griffin Park and during the game a hand grenade was thrown onto the pitch from the Millwall end. Brentford&#x27;s goalkeeper Chic Brodie picked it up, inspected it and threw it into his goal. It was later retrieved by police and determined to be a harmless dummy. There was fighting inside and outside the ground during the game between both sets of supporters, with one Millwall fan sustaining a broken jaw. &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper ran the sensationalist grenade-related headline &quot;Soccer Marches to War!&quot; Trouble was reported at Loftus Road on 26 March 1966 during a match between Queens Park Rangers and Millwall, at a time when both sides were near the top of the league table pushing for promotion to Division Two, but the London derby was won 6–1 by the west London based team, QPR. In the second-half, a coin was thrown from the terraces, which struck Millwall player Len Julians on the head, drawing blood. The stadium announcer warned that the game would be abandoned if there were any more disturbances from the crowd, prompting some Millwall fans to invade the pitch in an unsuccessful attempt to get the game abandoned. When Millwall&#x27;s unbeaten home record of 59 games came to an end against Plymouth Argyle in 1967, the windows of the away team&#x27;s coach were smashed. In the same year, a referee was attacked and the FA ordered the club to erect fences around The Den&#x27;s terracing. On 11 March 1978 a riot broke out at The Den during an FA Cup quarter-final between Millwall and Ipswich Town, with the home team losing 6–1. Fighting began on the terraces and spilled onto the pitch; dozens of fans were injured, with some hooligans turning on their own team&#x27;s supporters leaving some innocent fans bloodied. Bobby Robson, then manager of Ipswich, said of Millwall fans afterward, &quot;They [the police] should have turned the flamethrowers on them&quot;. In 1982 Millwall club chairman Alan Thorne threatened to close the club because of violence sparked by losing in the FA Cup to non-league side Slough Town.

The 1985 Kenilworth Road riot, after an FA Cup sixth-round match between Luton Town and Millwall on 13 March 1985, became one of the worst and widely reported incidents of football hooliganism to date. On that night, approximately 20,000 people packed into a ground that usually only held half that number to watch Luton beat Millwall 1–0. Numerous pitch invasions, fighting in the stands and missile-throwing occurred, of which one such object hit Luton&#x27;s goalkeeper Les Sealey. It led to a ban on away supporters by Luton from their Kenilworth Road ground for four years. Luton were asked by Millwall to make the Wednesday night match all-ticket, but this was ignored. As a result, rival hooligan firms gained access to the stadium. As well as the Millwall hooligans and those belonging to Luton&#x27;s firm the MIGs, many of the 31 fans arrested after the violence were identified as being from Chelsea&#x27;s Headhunters firm and West Ham United&#x27;s Inter City Firm. The FA commissioned an inquiry which concluded that it was &quot;not satisfied that Millwall F.C. took all reasonable precautions in accordance with the requirements of FA Rule 31(A)(II).&quot; A£7,500 fine was levied against Millwall, though this was later withdrawn on appeal. The penalty that Millwall faced was perhaps that the club&#x27;s name was now &quot;synonymous with everything that was bad in football and society&quot;.

In May 2002, hundreds of hooligans attaching themselves to Millwall were involved in disorder around the ground, after the team lost a play-off game to Birmingham City. It was described by the BBC as one of the worst cases of civil disorder seen in Great Britain in recent times. A police spokeswoman said that 47 police officers and 24 police horses were injured, and the Metropolitan Police considered suing the club after the events. The then chairman Theo Paphitis responded that Millwall could not be blamed for the actions of a mindless minority who attach themselves to the club. &quot;The problem of mob violence is not solely a Millwall problem, it is not a football problem, it is a problem which plagues the whole of our society&quot;, he said. Paphitis later introduced a membership scheme whereby only fans who would be prepared to join and carry membership cards would be allowed into The Den. Scotland Yard withdrew its threat to sue, stating: &quot;In light of the efforts made and a donation to a charity helping injured police officers, the Metropolitan Police Service has decided not to pursue legal action against Millwall F.C. in relation to the disorder&quot;. Some legal experts said it would have been difficult to hold a football club responsible for something that occurred away from its ground and involved people who did not attend the match. The scheme introduced by Paphitis now only applies to perceived high-risk away games. Many fans blame the scheme for diminishing Millwall&#x27;s away support, such as at Leeds United where fans are issued with vouchers which are then exchanged for tickets at a designated point of West Yorkshire Police&#x27;s choosing on the day of the game. Also, early kick-off times arranged by the police often result in only a few hundred fans making the trip.

In January 2009, hundreds of Millwall fans perceived as &quot;high risk&quot; individuals gained access to an FA Cup fourth-round match away at Hull City. The game, won 2–0 by Hull, was overshadowed when seats, coins and plastic bottles were thrown by some away supporters. There were conflicting reports in the media as to whether missiles were initially thrown by Hull supporters following chanting and jeering by Millwall fans of Jimmy Bullard (an ex-West Ham player) just prior to the fixture. On 25 August 2009, Millwall played away at West Ham United in the Football League Cup, losing 3–1 after extra time. One Millwall supporter was stabbed during clashes between the two sets of fans outside the ground. The game saw hundreds of West Ham fans invade the pitch on three occasions, forcing the game to be temporarily suspended once. The police later said the violence, because of its scale, was organised beforehand. In the aftermath of the disorder, Millwall were handed three charges by the FA and later cleared of all of them; West Ham received four charges and were found guilty on two counts: violent, threatening, obscene and provocative behaviour, and entering the field of play. West Ham were fined £115,000, an amount seen as an insult by Millwall, which staunchly defended the actions of its own fans and the club&#x27;s inability to do any more than it had for a match at a rival&#x27;s ground.

After a game against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road in September 2010, manager Kenny Jackett said Millwall&#x27;s hooligan problems are to a certain extent exaggerated by media sensationalism. &quot;I see it as unjust. We are an easy club to criticise and in my time [at the club], the way we have been reported is unfair&quot;, he said. Other examples of this include archive footage of their hooligan element&#x27;s past bad behaviour being shown, when disorder has occurred at other grounds, not involving them. During a game between Millwall and Huddersfield Town, &quot;The Observer&quot; reported that a Huddersfield Town fan had thrown a coin at a linesman, and that some Millwall fans had intervened, and handed the culprit over to police. The &quot;News of the World&quot;, however, bore the headline: &quot;Millwall Thugs Deck Linesman With Concrete&quot;. This has led to a siege mentality among supporters of the club, which gave rise to the Millwall fans&#x27; famous terrace chant, No one likes us, we don&#x27;t care, being sung in defiant defence of themselves and their team. In April 2013, Millwall met Wigan Athletic in a semi-final of the FA Cup. Millwall lost the game 2–0. Towards the end of the match, violence broke out in part of the stand allocated to Millwall, with individuals fighting amongst themselves and then against police, resulting in 14 arrests, of which two were Wigan supporters. In January 2014, a Millwall fan ripped a linesman&#x27;s flag after a corner was not given to his side during a game against Leicester City; Millwall lost 1–3. On 29 May 2016, Millwall played in the Football League One play-off final against Barnsley at Wembley Stadium, but towards the end of the match, with Barnsley winning 3–1, a group of Millwall supporters broke through a security barrier and attacked Barnsley supporters, some of whom were forced to leave the stadium to avoid the violence. Also there were objects thrown towards the Barnsley players and Barnsley supporters during the game. The fighting and violence was condemned by the Football Association. On 26 January 2019, Millwall beat Everton 3–2 and knocked them out of the FA Cup. The two teams supporters clashed away from The Den before the game, with an Everton fan being slashed across the face with a knife. A senior Metropolitan Police officer said, it was &quot;some of the most shocking football violence seen for some time&quot;. The game was also blighted by allegations of racist chanting.

On 5 December 2020, Millwall played against Derby County in the first game back at the Den for fans in ten months due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Some of the 2,000 fans present booed the players who took a knee and raised a fist before the game in support of anti discrimination as outlined in a letter written by the Milwall players before the match. The booing was condemned by The FA, EFL, Kick it Out, and mainstream media. Cabinet minister George Eustice refused to condemn Millwall fans, stating the Black Lives Matter political movement was against what most British people believed in though said the players should be free to express their views. The leader of the Brexit Party Nigel Farage called BLM a Marxist Party who had been &quot;sussed out&quot; by Millwall fans and called for kneeling to stop. In the next game at the Den against QPR on 8 December 2020, Millwall fans applauded as QPR and Millwall players raised aloft an anti-racism banner about inequality in football. The 2,000 Millwall fans also cheered the QPR players who took the knee. No Millwall player kneeled. Before the game, every fan was given a letter from the club saying, &quot;The eyes of the world are on this football club tonight – your club – and they want us to fail. Together as one, we will not let that happen.&quot; Some Millwall supporters had said their boos at the Derby game did not have racist intent, but were instead directed specifically at the Black Lives Matter movement, which had become increasingly unpopular with fans.

==Notable supporters==


==In the community==
In 1985, the club founded the Millwall Community Trust (MCT), which offers sporting, educational and charitable projects. The Trust is based next door to The Den, in the Lions Centre. Working with local people from the surrounding boroughs of Lewisham, Southwark and the wider Millwall Community. The Trust offers sports and fitness programmes, educational workshops, disability activities and soccer schools. The club helps promote anti-knife and anti-gun crime. In a match against Charlton Athletic in 2009, both teams wore special kits for the match in honour of murdered local teenagers and supporters Jimmy Mizen and Rob Knox. The logos of both clubs&#x27; shirt sponsors were replaced by the text, &quot;Street violence ruins lives&quot;. The club has also helped raise over £10,000 for the charity Help for Heroes.

==In popular culture==
Millwall have been depicted in films several times, specifically highlighting the club&#x27;s hooliganism firm the Bushwackers and the rivalry with West Ham United. Often glorifying football violence in the beginning, each film typically ends in loss of life, showing the futility of hooliganism.
* &quot;The Firm&quot; (1989) – Real life Millwall supporter Gary Oldman plays Bex, leader of football firm the Inter City Crew, a fictional representation of West Ham&#x27;s Inter City Firm and their violent exploits. Millwall&#x27;s Bushwackers firm are called The Buccaneers in the film.
* &quot;Arrivederci Millwall&quot; (1990) – A group of Millwall supporters travel to the 1982 World Cup in Spain, just after the Falklands War breaks out, intent on avenging a personal loss.
* &quot;Black Books&quot; (2000) – In the first episode &quot;Cooking the Books&quot;, Bernard Black (Dylan Moran) attempts to antagonise some Millwall hooligans into injuring him severely enough so that he may avoid doing his taxes. Upon remarking, &quot;&quot;How does the song go? Millwall, Millwall, we&#x27;re really dreadful and all of our girlfriends are unfulfilled and alienated,&quot; &quot;he succeeds.
* &quot;The Football Factory&quot; (2004) – Primarily about the Chelsea Headhunters, who fight numerous other firms on away days, culminating in a big fight against Millwall&#x27;s Bushwackers.
* &quot;Green Street&quot; (2005) – Elijah Wood plays an American student who gets involved with West Ham&#x27;s firm. The film builds up to a big clash with Millwall&#x27;s firm at the climax, after the two teams are drawn against each other in the Cup, foreshadowing similarities to the 2009 Upton Park riot.
* &quot;Rise of the Footsoldier&quot; (2007) – The rise of a football hooligan is chronicled from his beginnings on the terraces to becoming a member of a notorious gang of criminals. The rivalry between West Ham and Millwall is portrayed during the opening scenes of the film.
* &quot;Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal&quot; (2007) – The main protagonist Sunny Bhasin (John Abraham) initially agrees to leave Southhall United Football Club and signs a lucrative offer to play for Millwall F.C. He later decides not to play for Millwall though.
* &quot;Green Street 2: Stand Your Ground&quot; (2009) – A direct-to-video sequel to Green Street. It follows on directly from the original&#x27;s climax, with several members of West Ham&#x27;s and Millwall&#x27;s firms ending up in prison together and arranging a football match.
* &quot;The Firm&quot; (2009) – A remake by Nick Love, director of The Football Factory and himself a Millwall supporter. Set in the 1980s, the film focuses on the music, fashion and culture surrounding football at the time. It was generally well received by critics. In October 2009, the Metropolitan Police released still photos from the film in relation to a search for hooligans from the Upton Park riot. The mistake led to an apology from Scotland Yard.
* &quot;St George&#x27;s Day&quot; (2012) – A British gangster film which featured cameos from Millwall players Liam Trotter, Alan Dunne, David Forde, Darren Ward and Scott Barron. The film also included several Millwall references such as &#x27;No One Likes Us&#x27; and &#x27;We Fear No Foe&#x27;.

The club&#x27;s ground The Den doubled as The Dragons Lair, home ground of fictional team Harchester United in the television series &quot;Dream Team&quot;. It also appeared in episodes of the shows &quot;The Bill&quot; and &quot;Primeval&quot;. In literature, books such as &quot;No One Likes Us, We Don&#x27;t Care: True Stories from Millwall, Britain&#x27;s Most Notorious Football Hooligans&quot; by Andrew Woods focuses on the hooligan element of Millwall. &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; columnist Michael Calvin spent the 2009–10 season covering Millwall, writing the book &quot;Family: Life, Death and Football&quot;. The book looks at the rivalry with West Ham United, the stabbing of a Millwall supporter and the Lions play-off success and promotion to The Championship under Kenny Jackett.

<doc id="435025" wikidata="Q653957" url="?curid=435025" title="The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking">
<text>The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking is the debut solo studio album by Roger Waters, bassist/songwriter and co-founder of English rock band Pink Floyd; it was released in 1984. The album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1995.

==Concept history and production==
The concept was originally envisioned by Waters in 1977 and refined in the early 1980s. In its completed form, it rotates around a man&#x27;s scattered thoughts during his midlife crisis. These are explored on a dream journey during which he takes a road trip through California, commits adultery with a hitchhiker he picks up along the way, attempts to reconcile with his wife by moving to the wilderness, and finally ends up alone but with greater insight into a common human compassion. Along the way he also faces other fears and paranoia.

The entire story is framed in real time as a fitful dream taking place in the early morning hours of 4:30:18 am to 5:12:32 am on an unspecified day. At the end of the dream, the man wakes up lonely and contrite and turns to his real wife for comfort, presumably having processed his crisis.

In July 1978, Waters presented the concepts and played demos of &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot; as well as what was then titled &quot;Bricks in the Wall&quot;, which became &quot;The Wall&quot;, to his bandmates in Pink Floyd, asking them to decide which should be a group album, and which should be his solo album. After a long debate, they decided that they preferred the concept of &quot;Bricks in the Wall&quot;, even though their manager at the time, Steve O&#x27;Rourke, thought that &quot;Pros and Cons&quot; was a better-sounding concept, and David Gilmour deemed &quot;Pros and Cons&quot; stronger musically.

Waters declared:
&quot;Bricks in the Wall&quot;, retitled &quot;The Wall&quot;, became the next Pink Floyd album in 1979, and Waters shelved &quot;Pros and Cons&quot;. In early 1983, Waters undertook the shelved project himself. It was recorded in three London studios between February and December 1983: Olympic Studios, Eel Pie Studios and Waters&#x27; own Billiard Room, where his demos were constructed. The album features conductor Michael Kamen, actor Jack Palance, saxophonist David Sanborn and guitarist Eric Clapton. Guitar player Tim Renwick said:

Track 7, &quot;4.50 AM (Go Fishing),&quot; includes the same refrain as &quot;The Fletcher Memorial Home&quot; from Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Final Cut&quot;: &quot;The Fletcher Memorial Home for incurable tyrants and kings&quot;. This song also includes one of the car sounds, and the slightly changed chorus melody, from that album&#x27;s &quot;Your Possible Pasts&quot;.

&quot;I played through some of the songs from the &quot;Pros and Cons&quot; album,&quot; Waters remarked in 1992, &quot;and I was struck by how good they sounded. Looking back, that record dragged a little but, individually, some of the material was excellent.&quot;

=== Notes on real time ===
The original album was released in 1984 on the traditional two-sided vinyl LP and cassette formats. In keeping with Waters&#x27; concept, there are five seconds missing between sides one and two to allow the listener to flip the record (or turn the cassette) in order to keep the second half starting at exactly 4:50 AM as planned.

An unintended consequence of the album&#x27;s release on CD a few years later was that this gap was lost due to continuous play, which moves the start of the second half, &quot;4:50AM (Go Fishing),&quot; back to 4:49:55AM, and the start of the final track, &quot;5:11AM (The Moment of Clarity),&quot; back to 5:10:59AM.

Further to this, Track 6 on the first side, &quot;4:47 AM (The Remains of Our Love),&quot; actually begins at 4:46:46AM.

==Packaging==

Gerald Scarfe, who had created the album artwork and some animation for Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot; album, created all the graphics and animation for the &quot;Pros and Cons&quot; album. Its cover prompted controversy for featuring a rear-view nude photograph of model and softcore porn actress Linzi Drew. Although it was originally released with the nudity intact, subsequent editions distributed by Columbia Records censored Drew&#x27;s buttocks with a black box.

==Possible film==
A film based on the concept was proposed, and in 1987 a press release for the &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot; album claimed a film adaptation of &quot;Pros and Cons...&quot; had been completed, though nothing has been heard of it since. The screenplay was written by BBC/Radio Times Drama Award winner Pete Ward, who used excerpts from Waters&#x27; songs/lyrics from 1967 to 1987 as background to his award-winning play, &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Triumph&quot;, exploring the 20-year relationship of two close friends – one who attempts to fake mental illness to be with the other, who is an institutionalized &quot;catastrophic schizophrenic&quot;. Ward was commissioned to expand the plot and characters in &quot;The Pros and Cons&quot; around the album&#x27;s 42-minute real-time dream sequence based on Waters&#x27; own dreams.

A film was made in 1984 and 1985 which combined Gerald Scarfe&#x27;s animations and Nicolas Roeg&#x27;s live-action footage with slit-scan photography created by Peter Truckel at The Moving Picture Company. Also directed by Nicolas Roeg the film was projected on a backdrop behind the stage as the band played. Three promotional videos were also directed by Roeg. &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot; features snippets of the live action material from the screen films interspersed with footage of &quot;Shane&quot; and other cowboy films. &quot;Sexual Revolution&quot; also featured screen film material interspersed with footage Waters singing the song and playing his bass. &quot;Every Stranger&#x27;s Eyes&quot; is identical to the screen projection, except for the fact that footage of Waters is also interspersed here.

<text>The ghetto uprisings during World War II were a series of armed revolts against the regime of Nazi Germany between 1941 and 1943 in the newly established Jewish ghettos across Nazi-occupied Europe. Following the German and Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, Polish Jews were targeted from the outset. Within months inside occupied Poland, the Germans created hundreds of ghettos in which they forced the Jews to live. The new ghettos were part of the German official policy of removing Jews from public life with the aim of economic exploitation. The combination of excess numbers of inmates, unsanitary conditions and lack of food resulted in a high death rate among them.&lt;ref name=&quot;edelman/upenn&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In most cities the Jewish underground resistance movements developed almost instantly, although ghettoization had severely limited their access to resources.

The ghetto fighters took up arms during the most deadly phase of the Holocaust known as Operation Reinhard (launched in 1942), against the Nazi plans to deport all prisoners – men, women and children – to camps, with the aim of their mass extermination.

==History==
Armed resistance was offered in over 100 locations on either side of Polish-Soviet border of 1939, overwhelmingly in eastern Poland. Some of these uprisings were more massive and organized, while others were small and spontaneous. The best known and the biggest of all Jewish uprisings during the Holocaust took place in the Warsaw Ghetto between 19 April and 16 May 1943, and in Białystok in August. In the course of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 56,065 Jews were either killed on the spot or captured and transported aboard Holocaust trains to extermination camps before the Ghetto was razed to the ground. At the Białystok Ghetto, following deportations in which 10,000 Jews were led to the Holocaust trains, and another 2,000 were murdered locally, the ghetto underground staged an uprising, resulting in a blockade of the ghetto which lasted for a full month. There were other such struggles, leading to the wholesale burning of the ghettos such as in Kołomyja (now Kolomyia, Ukraine), and mass shootings of women and children as in Mizocz.

==Selected ghetto uprisings during the Holocaust==

The uprisings erupted in five major cities, 45 provincial towns, 5 major concentration and extermination camps, as well as in at least 18 forced labor camps. Notable ghetto uprisings included:
* Slonim Ghetto revolt of 29 June 1942 
* Łachwa (Lakhva) Ghetto Uprising of 3 September 1942
* Mizoch Ghetto Uprising of 14 October 1942
* Mińsk Mazowiecki Ghetto prisoner revolt of 10 January 1943
* Warsaw Ghetto Uprising 19 April – 16 May 1943, organised by the ŻOB and ŻZW
* Częstochowa Ghetto Uprising of 25–30 June 1943
* Będzin Ghetto Uprising also known as the Będzin-Sosnowiec Ghetto Uprising of 3 August 1943
* Białystok Ghetto Uprising 16–17 August 1943, organized by the Antyfaszystowska Organizacja Bojowa

To some extent, the final liquidation of other ghettos was also met with armed struggle:
* Kraków Ghetto
* Łódź Ghetto
* Lwów Ghetto
* Lutsk Ghetto
* Marcinkonys Ghetto
* Minsk Ghetto
* Pińsk Ghetto
* Riga Ghetto

<text>North Hollywood is a neighbourhood and district of the greater Hollywood neighborhood, located in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, California. The neighborhood contains the NoHo Arts District, El Portal Theater, several art galleries, and the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences. The North Hollywood Metro Rail station is the northern terminus of the B Line subway on the Los Angeles Metro.

North Hollywood was established by the Lankershim Ranch Land and Water Company in 1887. It was first named &quot;Toluca&quot; before being renamed &quot;Lankershim&quot; in 1896 and finally &quot;North Hollywood&quot; in 1927.

==History==
===Before annexation===

North Hollywood was once part of the vast landholdings of the Mission San Fernando Rey de España, which was confiscated by the government during the Mexican period of rule.

A group of investors assembled as the San Fernando Farm Homestead Association purchased the southern half of the Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando. The leading investor was Isaac Lankershim, a Northern California stockman and grain farmer, who was impressed by the Valley&#x27;s wild oats and proposed to raise sheep on the property. In 1873, Isaac Lankershim&#x27;s son and future son-in-law, James Boon Lankershim and Isaac Newton Van Nuys, moved to the San Fernando Valley and took over management of the property. Van Nuys thought the property could profitably grow wheat using the dryland farming technique developed on the Great Plains and leased land from the Association to test his theories. In time, the Lankershim property, under its third name, the Los Angeles Farming and Milling Company, would become the world&#x27;s largest wheat-growing empire.

In October 1887, J.B. Lankershim and eight other developers organized the Lankershim Ranch Land and Water Company, purchasing north of the Cahuenga Pass from the Lankershim Farming and Milling Company. Lankershim established a townsite which the residents named Toluca along the old road from Cahuenga Pass to San Fernando. On April 1, 1888, they offered ready-made small farms for sale, already planted with deep-rooted deciduous fruit and nut trees—mostly peaches, pears, apricots, and walnuts—that could survive the rainless summers of the Valley by relying on the high water table along the Tujunga Wash rather than surface irrigation.


The land boom of the 1880s went bust by the 1890s, but despite another brutal drought cycle in the late 1890s, the fruit and nut farmers remained solvent. The Toluca Fruit Growers Association was formed in 1894. The next year the Southern Pacific opened a branch line slanting northwest across the Valley to Chatsworth. The Chatsworth Limited made one freight stop a day at Toluca, though the depot bore the new name of Lankershim. With the post office across the street being called Toluca, controversy over the town&#x27;s name continued, and the local ranchers used to quip, &quot;Ship the merchandise to Lankershim, but bill it to Toluca.&quot; In 1896, under pressure from Lankershim, the post office at Toluca was renamed &quot;Lankershim&quot; after his father, although the new name of the town would not be officially recognized until 1905.

By 1903, the area was known as &quot;The Home of the Peach&quot;. In 1912, the area&#x27;s major employer, the Bonner Fruit Company, was canning over a million tons of peaches, apricots, and other fruits. When the Los Angeles Aqueduct opened in 1913, Valley farmers offered to buy the surplus water, but the federal legislation that enabled the construction of the aqueduct prohibited Los Angeles from selling the water outside of the city limits.

At first, resistance to the real-estate development and downtown business interests of Los Angeles remained strong enough to keep the small farmers unified in opposition to annexation. However, the fruit packing company interests were taken over by the Los Angeles interests. The two conspired to decrease prices and mitigate the farmers&#x27; profit margins, making their continued existence tenuous. When droughts hit the valley again, rather than face foreclosure, the most vulnerable farmers agreed to mortgage their holdings to the fruit packing company and banks in Los Angeles for the immediate future and vote on annexation.

===Annexation to Los Angeles===
West Lankershim agreed to be annexed to the City of Los Angeles in 1919. Lankershim proper and non-proper joined in 1923. Much of the promised water delivery was withheld, and many of the ranchers one by one had their holding foreclosed or transferred to the packing companies. In turn, these were bought up by the real-estate developers and by the late 1920s a massive effort was underway to market the area to prospective home owners throughout the country. As part of this effort, in 1927, in an effort to capitalize on the glamour and proximity of Hollywood, Lankershim was renamed &quot;North Hollywood&quot;. The result was a massive development of housing which transformed the area into a suburban development of Los Angeles.

===Retail hub===
Lankershim Boulevard around Magnolia Boulevard was the heart of the town of Lankershim, and of North Hollywood and until the mid-1950s boasted the largest concentration of retail stores, banks, restaurants, and entertainment. In 1953, for example, the shopping strip included three full-line department stores: J.C. Penney at 5261 Lankershim, Yeakel &amp; Goss department store at 5272, and the upscale single-location Rathbun&#x27;s department store at nos. 5311 (5307–15), opened in 1921. There were also branches of the large Harris &amp; Frank clothing chain at 5236 Lankershim that opened in 1950, J. J. Newberry five and dime at 5321, and Safeway at 5356.

In the late 1940s and 1950s the area saw the first department-store-anchored, auto-oriented shopping center in the Valley: Valley Plaza, covering both a development at Laurel Canyon at Victory boulevards but also a loose collection of other retail stores south along Laurel Canyon to Oxnard, including a branch of the May Co., the second-largest suburban department store branch in the U.S. at the time. In the mid-1950s Valley Plaza claimed to be the largest shopping center on the West Coast of the United States and the third-largest in the country. It was difficult for the Lankershim retail district to compete and by 1980, most stores had closed including Rathbun&#x27;s. The May Co. at the south end of the Valley Plaza shopping district built its own attached, enclosed mall, Laurel Plaza, opening in 1968. The last department of Valley Plaza&#x27;s anchors, Sears, closed in 2019 as department store-anchored shopping centers lost favor. As of 2020, much of the Valley Plaza retail space is either empty, portion is now a middle school, and the Laurel Plaza site is under construction to become the NoHo West mixed-use development, which includes retail.
===1950s–present===
By the late 1950s, many of the original owners were aging, and their children were moving to other areas. School integration in the subsequent years, blockbusting, and subsequent ethnic turmoil encouraged many remaining families to move out, who in turn were replaced with black and Hispanic families moving from Central and South Los Angeles. By the 1990s, the demographic changes had almost completely transformed the region.

The North Hollywood shootout occurred in 1997, leaving 12 Los Angeles Police Department officers and eight civilians injured and the two armed robbers dead.

===21st century===

The opening of North Hollywood station in 2000, establishment and success of the NoHo Arts District in the old &quot;downtown&quot;, and repurposing of disused lots such as Laurel Plaza into NoHo West, has revitalized the heart of North Hollywood.

Since 2000, the community has been developing and undergoing many changes, thanks in large part to the formation of the 743-acre North Hollywood Development District and the subsequent NoHo Commons projects.

In 2015, Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood was part of the first San Fernando Valley CicLAvia, an event sponsored by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority in which major roads are temporarily closed to motorized vehicle traffic and used for recreational human-powered transport.

==Geography==
North Hollywood is bordered on the north by Sun Valley and on the northeast and east by Burbank. Toluca Lake borders North Hollywood on the southeast and south, and Studio City abuts it on the southwest. It is bordered by Valley Village and Valley Glen on the west.

North Hollywood is not bordered by the neighborhood of Hollywood, as North Hollywood is approximately north of Hollywood.

North Hollywood has a hot summer Mediterranean Climate (Köppen climate classification Csa).

==Demographics==
The 2000 U.S. census counted 77,848 residents in the 5.87-square-mile North Hollywood neighborhood—or 13,264 people per square mile, about an average population density for the city but among the highest for the county. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 87,241. In 2000, the median age for residents was 30, considered an average age for city and county neighborhoods; the percentage of residents aged 19 to 34 was among the county&#x27;s highest.

The neighborhood was considered &quot;moderately diverse&quot; ethnically within Los Angeles. The breakdown was 57.7% Latino, 27% Non-Hispanic White, 5.7% Asian, 5.6% black, and 4% from other groups. Foreign-born residents made up 46.4% of residents, a high percentage for Los Angeles; Mexico (43.2%) and El Salvador (16%) were the most common places of birth for this portion of the population. The percentages of never-married men and never-married women were among the county&#x27;s highest.

The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $42,791, considered average for the city but low for the county. The percentages of households that earned $40,000 or less were high for the county. Renters occupied 75.4% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment-owners held 24.6%.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission approved the construction of the subway connecting North Hollywood to Hollywood, East Hollywood, Koreatown, Westlake and downtown Los Angeles along the Metro Rail Red Line in 1990. The decision followed the Los Angeles City Council unanimously endorsing North Hollywood as the northern terminal of the Red Line with the final route having termini at Union Station and North Hollywood. The North Hollywood Metro Subway station opened in June 2000. Close to half a million people took advantage of free rides on the Red Line subway in its first weekend in operation. The station is the starting point for the B Line of the Metro subway, which cost $4.5 billion to build.

Instead of a further B Line extension further into the Valley, Metro built the Metro G Line bus rapid transit. Its terminus is located across the street from the subway station. This expanded the station area into a transit hub, and many local and rapid buses now stop at the station. Proposals have been made to extend the B Line northeasterly to Bob Hope Airport in Burbank and the Downtown Burbank Metrolink station in downtown Burbank, or to extend it in a northwesterly direction along Lankershim Boulevard and eventually to Sylmar. Neither project is currently funded nor is included in Metro&#x27;s Long Term Transportation Plan. The North Hollywood to Pasadena Transit Corridor was approved by the Metro board April 28, 2022, and is expected to be completed by 2024. It has promised to provide faster bus service to Glendale and Pasadena.

<text>: &quot;Certain members of the unrelated snout moths (Pyralidae) are also known as &quot;ermine moths.&quot; Spilosoma lubricipeda is an unrelated moth with the common name &quot;white ermine.&quot;&quot;

The family Yponomeutidae are known as the ermine [[moth|moths]], with several hundred species, most of them in the tropics. The larvae tend to form communal webs, and some are minor pests in agriculture, forestry, and horticulture. Adult moths are minor pollinators.

==Taxonomy==

The traditional morphology based taxonomy of Kyrki (1990) divided Yponomeutidae into six subfamilies, but this circumscription is not found to be monophyletic in molecular phylogenetic analyses. van Nieukerken et al (2011) split off Praydidae, Attevidae and Argyresthiidae as separate families, and Sohn (2013) elevated Scythropiinae to family to contain &quot;Scythropia&quot;.

The two remaining subfamilies are:
* Saridoscelinae
* Yponomeutinae

The following genera have not been assigned subfamilies:

* &quot;Abacistis&quot;
* &quot;Acrataula&quot;
* &quot;Aemylurgis&quot;
* &quot;Aictis&quot;
* &quot;Amalthina&quot;

* &quot;Calamotis&quot;
* &quot;Callithrinca&quot;
* &quot;Caminophantis&quot;
* &quot;Chionaemopsis&quot;
* &quot;Citrinarchis&quot;
* &quot;Conchiophora&quot;
* &quot;Coptoproctis&quot;
* &quot;Cymonympha&quot;
* &quot;Dascia&quot;
* &quot;Diaphragmistis&quot;
* &quot;Entrichiria&quot;
* &quot;Epactosaris&quot;
* &quot;Epichthonodes&quot;
* &quot;Eriopyrrha&quot;

* &quot;Typhogenes&quot;
==Characteristics==
Ermine moths are small to medium-sized moths varying in wingspan from . The heads mostly have smooth scales, the haustellum is naked and the labial palps are curved upwards. The maxillary palps usually consist of one or two segments. The wings are long, often with fringes on the trailing edges of the hindwings. The colour is usually white, pale grey or drab, often with many dark speckles.

Adult ermine moths are mostly nocturnal.

The larvae are leaf-webbers, leaf skeletonizers, leafminers or needleminers and are found on a variety of host plants. Some cause economic damage to crops and trees.

==Species (selection)==
Better-known species include:
* Spindle ermine, &quot;Yponomeuta cagnagella&quot;
* Bird-cherry ermine, &quot;Yponomeuta evonymella&quot;
* Orchard ermine, &quot;Yponomeuta padella&quot;
* &quot;Yponomeuta plumbella&quot;
* &quot;Acmosara polyxena&quot;
* Apple ermine &quot;Yponomeuta malinellus&quot;
* Ailanthus webworm

== Etymology ==

The word Yponomeutidae comes from the Ancient Greek (&#x27;) meaning under and (&#x27;) meaning food or dwelling, thus &quot;feeding secretly, or burrow&quot;.

<text>William James &quot;Bill&quot; Rexford (March 14, 1927 – April 18, 1994) was a stock car driver in the early 1950s. He is best remembered for winning the 1950 NASCAR Grand National Series championship at only 23 years old. Rexford currently holds the distinction as NASCAR&#x27;s youngest Cup Champion.

==Biography==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
Born in Conewango Valley, New York to Kermit and Edith Rexford, Rexford made his name driving stock cars in Western New York. He got his introduction at a young age as his father owned a Chevrolet dealership in the village. At age 16, he made his racing debut at a nearby track in Leon, New York. After he turned 18, he stopped his racing career to join the United States Navy during World War II, during that time, he was stationed in Newport, Rhode Island. After his discharge, he went back home to New York and started racing at bullrings in Buffalo, Rochester, and everywhere in between. When NASCAR introduced its &quot;Strictly Stock&quot; series in 1949, Rexford made three starts, with his best finish being a 3rd at Heidelberg Raceway. He went into full-time competition in the newly renamed Grand National Series in 1950. He and teammate Lloyd Moore became the first Northern-born drivers to go full time on the circuit. He competed in 17 of the 19 races that season, driving Oldsmobiles, Fords, and Mercuries owned by nearby Jamestown, New York resident Julian Buesink. He scored his first and only win in the fifth race of the year at Canfield Speedway.

Rexford was consistent and battled for the points lead for most of the year. His two biggest competitors were legends Curtis Turner and then-rookie Fireball Roberts. A third contender, Lee Petty, had been stripped of 809 points earlier in the season for competing in non-NASCAR sanctioned races and was essentially robbed of a realistic shot at the title. Late in the year, Rexford was able to take the points lead as both Roberts and Turner suffered from inconsistency.

In the final race of the year at Occoneechee Speedway, Rexford was locked in a tight battle with Fireball for the championship, holding the points lead by a slim margin. Rexford&#x27;s engine expired early, and his championship hopes nearly went up in smoke. All Roberts needed to do now was finish in the top five, but trademark desire to win led him to push his car and his engine gave out with less than 50 laps to go, giving Rexford a dramatic, and controversial championship.

1950 proved to be Rexford&#x27;s lone full-time campaign in NASCAR&#x27;s highest division. He moved back to the Northeast and remained a part-time competitor in the Grand National ranks until 1953, when he ran his last race in Rochester, New York. He finished 5th, driving the #60 Chevrolet for long-time car owner Julian Buesink. After 1953, Rexford joined the Midwest Association for Race Car (MERC) in 1954 (now known as ARCA). As a result, Bill France banned Rexford from racing and fined him $1,000 in the process, which Rexford refused to do. He raced until 1956 when he retired from racing at the age of 29. After he moved to Arizona and started a trucking company for 25 years. After that, he sold the company and retired to California where he died after a long illness.

73 years after his lone Cup championship, Rexford is still the youngest driver to win a championship in what has become the NASCAR Cup Series, doing so at age 23. He remained the only driver from the Northeast to win a championship until 2017 when New Jersey’s Martin Truex Jr. won, and was the only non-Southerner to win a title until 1989 when Missouri&#x27;s Rusty Wallace won, a feat which has been matched many times since. Rexford was the only series champion that was not included among NASCAR&#x27;s 50 Greatest Drivers in 1998 and is the only champion from 1949 to 2003 not to be inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, as well as the only Cup Series champion who has since retired not to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. He is the only Cup champion to have just one career win and the first of four drivers to win the title with just one win on the season, being followed by Ned Jarrett in 1961, Benny Parsons in 1973, and Matt Kenseth in 2003.

<doc id="435043" wikidata="Q137173" url="?curid=435043" title="Glucoside">
<text>A glucoside is a glycoside that is chemically derived from glucose. Glucosides are common in plants, but rare in animals. Glucose is produced when a glucoside is hydrolysed by purely chemical means, or decomposed by fermentation or enzymes.

The name was originally given to plant products of this nature, in which the other part of the molecule was, in the greater number of cases, an aromatic aldehydic or phenolic compound (exceptions are Jinigrin and Jalapin or Scammonin). It has now been extended to include synthetic ethers, such as those obtained by acting on alcoholic glucose solutions with hydrochloric acid, and also the polysaccharoses, e.g. cane sugar, which appear to be ethers also. Although glucose is the most common sugar present in glucosides, many are known which yield rhamnose or iso-dulcite; these may be termed pentosides. Much attention has been given to the non-sugar parts (aglycone) of the molecules; the constitutions of many have been determined, and the compounds synthesized; and in some cases the preparation of the synthetic glucoside effected.

The simplest glucosides are the alkyl ethers which have been obtained by reacting hydrochloric acid on alcoholic glucose solutions. A better method of preparation is to dissolve solid anhydrous glucose in methanol containing hydrochloric acid. A mixture of alpha- and beta-methylglucoside results.

The classification of glucosides is a matter of some intricacy. One method based on the chemical constitution of the non-glucose part of the molecules has been proposed that posits four groups: (1) alkyl derivatives, (2) benzene derivatives, (3) styrolene derivatives, and (4) anthracene derivatives. A group may also be constructed to include the cyanogenic glucosides, i.e. those containing prussic acid. Alternate classifications follow a botanical classification, which has several advantages; in particular, plants of allied genera contain similar compounds. This article follows the chemical classification and discusses only the more important compounds.

== Ethylene derivatives ==
These are generally mustard oils, which are characterized by a burning taste; their principal occurrence is in mustard and &quot;Tropaeolum&quot; seeds. Sinigrin, or the potassium salt of inyronic acid not only occurs in mustard seed, but also in black pepper and in horseradish root. Hydrolysis with barium hydroxide, or decomposition by the ferment myrosin, gives glucose, allyl mustard oil and potassium hydroxide. Sinalbin occurs in white pepper; it decomposes to the mustard oil, glucose and sinapin, a compound of choline and sinapic acid. Jalapin or Scammonin occurs in scammony; it hydrolyses to glucose and jalapinolic acid.

== Benzene derivatives ==
These are generally oxy and oxyaldehydic compounds.

; Benzoic acid derivatives
The benzoyl derivative cellotropin has been used for tuberculosis. Populin, which occurs in the leaves and bark of &quot;Populus tremula&quot;, is benzoyl salicin. Benzoyl-beta-D-glucoside is a compound found in the fern &quot;Pteris ensiformis&quot;.

;Phenol derivatives
There are a number of glucosides found in natural phenols and polyphenols, as, for example, in the flavonoids chemical family. Arbutin, which occurs in bearberry along with methyl arbutin, hydrolyses to hydroquinone and glucose. Pharmacologically it acts as a urinary antiseptic and diuretic; Salicin, also termed Saligenin and glucose occurs in the willow. The enzymes ptyalin and emulsin convert it into glucose and saligenin, ortho-oxybenzylalcohol. Oxidation gives the aldehyde helicin.

== Styrene derivatives ==
This group contains a benzene and also an ethylene group, being derived from styrene. Coniferin (C16H22O8) occurs in the cambium of conifer wood. Emulsin converts it into glucose and coniferyl alcohol. Oxidation of coniferin gives glucovanillin, which yields upon treatment with emulsin glucose and vanillin. Syringin, which occurs in the bark of &quot;Syringa vulgaris&quot;, is a methoxyconiferin. Phloridzin occurs in the root-bark of various fruit trees; it hydrolyses to glucose and phloretin, which is the phloroglucin ester of paraoxyhydratropic acid. It is related to the pentosides naringin (C27H32O14), which hydrolyzes to rhamnose and naringenin, the phloroglucin ester of &quot;p&quot;-coumaric acid, and hesperidin, which hydrolyzes to rhamnose and hesperetin, the phloroglucin ester of isoferulic acid (C10H10O4).

* Aesculin (C21H24O13), occurring in horse-chestnut and California buckeye, and daphnin, occurring in &quot;Daphne alpina&quot;, are isomeric; the former hydrolyzes to glucose and aesculetin (C9H6O4 — 6,7-dihydroxycoumarin), the latter to glucose and daphnetin (7,8-dihydroxycoumarin).
* Fraxin, occurring in &quot;Fraxinus excelsior&quot;, hydrolyzes to glucose and fraxetin (also known as 7,8-dihydroxy-6-methoxycoumarin)
* Flavone or benzo-7-pyrone derivatives are numerous; in many cases they (or the non-sugar part of the molecule) are vegetable dyes.
* Rhamnetin, a splitting product of the glucosides of &quot;Rhamnus&quot;, is monomethyl quercetin; fisetin, from &quot;Rhus cotinus&quot;, is monoxyquercetin; chrysin is phenyl-dihydroxybenzopyrone.
* Saponarin, a glucoside found in &quot;Saponaria officinalis&quot;, is a related compound.
* Strophanthin is the name given to two different compounds, g-strophanthin (ouabain) obtained from &quot;Strophanthus gratus&quot; and k-strophanthin from &quot;Stroph. kombé&quot;.

== Anthracene derivatives ==

These are generally substituted anthraquinones; many have medicinal applications, being used as purgatives, while one, ruberythric acid, yields the valuable dyestuff madder, the base of which is alizarin. Chrysophanic acid, a dioxymethylanthraquinone, occurs in rhubarb, which also contains emodin, a trioxymethylanthraquinone; this substance occurs in combination with rhamnose in &quot;Frangula&quot; bark.

Arguably the most important cyanogenic glucoside is amygdalin, which occurs in bitter almonds. The enzyme maltase decomposes it into glucose and mandelic nitrile glucoside; the latter is broken down by emulsin into glucose, benzaldehyde and prussic acid. Emulsin also decomposes amygdalin directly into these compounds without the intermediate formation of mandelic nitrile glucoside.

Several other glucosides of this nature have been isolated. The saponins are a group of substances characterized by forming a lather with water; they occur in soap-bark. Mention may also be made of indican, the glucoside of the indigo plant; this is hydrolysed by the indigo ferment, indimulsiri, to indoxyl and indiglucin.

<text>Walter Alvarez (born October 3, 1940) is a professor in the Earth and Planetary Science department at the University of California, Berkeley. He and his father, Nobel Prize–winning physicist Luis Alvarez, developed the theory that dinosaurs were killed by an asteroid impact.

==Biography==
Born in Berkeley, California, Alvarez is the son of Luis Walter Alvarez, a Nobel Prize-winner in physics, and Geraldine Smithwick. His grandfather was physician Walter C. Alvarez and his great-grandfather, Spanish-born Luis F. Alvarez, worked as a doctor in Hawaii and developed a method for the better diagnosis of macular leprosy. His great-aunt Mabel Alvarez was an artist and oil painter from California.

Alvarez earned his B.A. in geology in 1962 from Carleton College in Minnesota and Ph.D. in geology from Princeton University in 1967. He worked for American Overseas Petroleum Limited in the Netherlands, and in Libya at the time of Colonel Gaddafi&#x27;s revolution. Having developed a side interest in archaeological geology, he left the oil company and spent some time in Italy, studying the Roman volcanics and their influence on patterns of settlement in early Roman times.

Alvarez then moved to Lamont–Doherty Geological Observatory of Columbia University, and began studying the Mediterranean tectonics in the light of the new theory of plate tectonics. His work on tectonic paleomagnetism in Italy led to a study of the geomagnetic reversals recorded in Italian deep-sea limestones. Alvarez and his colleagues were able to date the reversals for an interval of more than 100 million years of the Earth&#x27;s history by using Foraminifera biostratigraphy.

==Impact theory==


Alvarez and his father Luis W. Alvarez, together with Frank Asaro and Helen Michel, discovered that a clay layer occurring right at the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary was highly enriched in the element iridium. Since iridium enrichment is common in asteroids, but very uncommon on the Earth, they postulated that the layer had been created by the impact of a large asteroid with the Earth, and that this impact was the likely cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which occurred 66 million years ago and was responsible for the elimination of 75% of all then-existent species, including all non-avian dinosaurs.

This iridium enrichment has now been observed in many other sites around the world. In addition, the Chicxulub crater off the northeast coast of the Yucatan Peninsula was identified and is now regarded as the definitive evidence of a large impact. Consequently, a majority of scientists now accept an impact scenario as the most likely cause for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction. Alvarez&#x27;s 1997 book, &quot;T. rex and the Crater of Doom&quot;, details the discovery of the event.

In addition to his interest in extinction events and impacts, Alvarez has contributed to the understanding of Mediterranean tectonics, Roman geology and archeology, and the establishment of magnetostratigraphic correlations.

==Big History==
Alvarez began teaching a course in Big History at UC Berkeley in 2006 under the title &quot;Big History: Cosmos, Earth, Life, Humanity.&quot; He last taught the course in 2011 where it was videotaped and made freely available online. According to Alvarez, Big History is the &quot;attempt to understand, in a unified and interdisciplinary way, the history of the Cosmos, Earth, Life and Humanity.&quot; This definition was later adopted by the International Big History Association (IBHA). Alvarez&#x27;s course is open to all majors and grade levels and seeks to provide a broad understanding of the past, present and future.

Alvarez helped organize a meeting of Big Historians at the Geological Observatory at Coldigioco in Italy in 2010 which resulted in the establishment of the International Big History Association. In 2011, the IBHA is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization.

Alvarez was one of the founding members of the IBHA, and served on the advisory board until August 7, 2014 when he stepped down at the 2014 IBHA conference held at Dominican University of California.

===ChronoZoom===
In partnership with Microsoft Research, Alvarez developed a zoomable timeline called ChronoZoom, which is a computer-graphical approach to visualizing and understanding time scales, and presenting vast quantities of historical information in a useful way. ChronoZoom was introduced at the 97th Annual Faculty Research Lecture at UC Berkeley.

==Awards and honors==

Alvarez was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1983, and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1991. He was awarded the 2006 Nevada Medal, the 2008 Vetlesen Prize, and the Penrose Medal from the Geological Society of America. In 2005, he received the doctorate &quot;Honoris Causa&quot; in Geological Sciences from the University of Siena, Italy.

Minor planet 3581 Alvarez is named after him and his father, Luis Walter Alvarez.

<doc id="435047" wikidata="Q781123" url="?curid=435047" title="Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia">
<text>&quot;Catholicos-Patriarch&quot; has been the title of the heads of the Georgian Orthodox Church since 1010. The first Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia was Melkisedek I (1010–1033). In the 15th century the Georgian Orthodox Church was divided into the East and the West parts and accordingly they were ruled by the &quot;Catholicos-Patriarch of East Georgia&quot; and the &quot;Catholicos-Patriarch of West Georgia&quot;. 

In 1801, the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti (Eastern Georgia) was occupied and annexed by the Tsarist Russian Empire. In 1811, the autocephalous status (independence) of the Georgian Church was abolished by Russia and the Russian Orthodox Church took over its administration.

In 1917, the autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church was restored. The first &quot;Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia&quot; since the restoration of autocephaly was Kyrion II Sadzaglishvili (1917–1918).

To this date there have been 82 Catholicos-Patriarchs, of this 7 have been formally glorified by the Georgian Orthodox Church.

The incumbent Catholicos-Patriarch of the church is Patriarch Ilia II since 1977.

<text>&quot;Immortal Memory&quot; is an album by Dead Can Dance member Lisa Gerrard and Irish classical composer Patrick Cassidy, released in 2004. It was Gerrard&#x27;s first studio release since 1998&#x27;s &quot;Duality&quot; with Pieter Bourke.

==Overview==

Gerrard first met Cassidy in 2000 in Los Angeles (where he lives), when she came to work on the &quot;Gladiator&quot; soundtrack, and they planned to work together one day. When they eventually found a shared two-month break, they joined at Gerrard&#x27;s Australian studio for this record.

The W. B. Yeats poem &quot;Sailing to Byzantium&quot; inspired the track of the same name.

The lyrics utilise three ancient languages:

* Gaelic (ancient Irish) in &quot;The Song of Amergin&quot; (based on the first song supposedly sung by a mortal on Irish soil).
* Aramaic in &quot;Maranatha&quot; (meaning &quot;come lord, come teacher&quot;), and &quot;Abwoon&quot; (meaning &quot;our father&quot;, a rendition of the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Prayer&quot; in the language of Jesus).
* Latin in &quot;Psallit in Aure Dei&quot; (meaning &quot;singing in the ear of God&quot;, a dirge for Patrick Cassidy&#x27;s late father).

==Track listing==

<doc id="435051" wikidata="Q2000555" url="?curid=435051" title="Category of topological spaces">
<text>In mathematics, the category of topological spaces, often denoted Top, is the category whose objects are topological spaces and whose morphisms are continuous maps. This is a category because the composition of two continuous maps is again continuous, and the identity function is continuous. The study of Top and of properties of topological spaces using the techniques of category theory is known as categorical topology.

N.B. Some authors use the name Top for the categories with topological manifolds, with 
compactly generated spaces as objects and continuous maps as morphisms or with the category of compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces.

==As a concrete category==

Like many categories, the category Top is a concrete category, meaning its objects are sets with additional structure (i.e. topologies) and its morphisms are functions preserving this structure. There is a natural forgetful functor

to the category of sets which assigns to each topological space the underlying set and to each continuous map the underlying function.

The forgetful functor &quot;U&quot; has both a left adjoint

which equips a given set with the discrete topology, and a right adjoint

which equips a given set with the indiscrete topology. Both of these functors are, in fact, right inverses to &quot;U&quot; (meaning that &quot;UD&quot; and &quot;UI&quot; are equal to the identity functor on Set). Moreover, since any function between discrete or between indiscrete spaces is continuous, both of these functors give full embeddings of Set into Top.

Top is also &quot;fiber-complete&quot; meaning that the category of all topologies on a given set &quot;X&quot; (called the &quot;fiber&quot; of &quot;U&quot; above &quot;X&quot;) forms a complete lattice when ordered by inclusion. The greatest element in this fiber is the discrete topology on &quot;X&quot;, while the least element is the indiscrete topology.

Top is the model of what is called a topological category. These categories are characterized by the fact that every structured source formula_1 has a unique initial lift formula_2. In Top the initial lift is obtained by placing the initial topology on the source. Topological categories have many properties in common with Top (such as fiber-completeness, discrete and indiscrete functors, and unique lifting of limits).

==Limits and colimits==

The category Top is both complete and cocomplete, which means that all small limits and colimits exist in Top. In fact, the forgetful functor &quot;U&quot; : Top → Set uniquely lifts both limits and colimits and preserves them as well. Therefore, (co)limits in Top are given by placing topologies on the corresponding (co)limits in Set.

Specifically, if &quot;F&quot; is a diagram in Top and (&quot;L&quot;, &quot;φ&quot; : &quot;L&quot; → &quot;F&quot;) is a limit of &quot;UF&quot; in Set, the corresponding limit of &quot;F&quot; in Top is obtained by placing the initial topology on (&quot;L&quot;, &quot;φ&quot; : &quot;L&quot; → &quot;F&quot;). Dually, colimits in Top are obtained by placing the final topology on the corresponding colimits in Set.

Unlike many &quot;algebraic&quot; categories, the forgetful functor &quot;U&quot; : Top → Set does not create or reflect limits since there will typically be non-universal cones in Top covering universal cones in Set.

Examples of limits and colimits in Top include:

*The empty set (considered as a topological space) is the initial object of Top; any singleton topological space is a terminal object. There are thus no zero objects in Top.
*The product in Top is given by the product topology on the Cartesian product. The coproduct is given by the disjoint union of topological spaces.
*The equalizer of a pair of morphisms is given by placing the subspace topology on the set-theoretic equalizer. Dually, the coequalizer is given by placing the quotient topology on the set-theoretic coequalizer.
*Direct limits and inverse limits are the set-theoretic limits with the final topology and initial topology respectively.
*Adjunction spaces are an example of pushouts in Top.

==Other properties==
*The monomorphisms in Top are the injective continuous maps, the epimorphisms are the surjective continuous maps, and the isomorphisms are the homeomorphisms.
*The extremal monomorphisms are (up to isomorphism) the subspace embeddings. In fact, in Top all extremal monomorphisms happen to satisfy the stronger property of being regular.
*The extremal epimorphisms are (essentially) the quotient maps. Every extremal epimorphism is regular.
*The split monomorphisms are (essentially) the inclusions of retracts into their ambient space.
*The split epimorphisms are (up to isomorphism) the continuous surjective maps of a space onto one of its retracts.
*There are no zero morphisms in Top, and in particular the category is not preadditive.
*Top is not cartesian closed (and therefore also not a topos) since it does not have exponential objects for all spaces. When this feature is desired, one often restricts to the full subcategory of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces CGHaus or the category of compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces. However, Top is contained in the exponential category of pseudotopologies, which is itself a subcategory of the (also exponential) category of convergence spaces.

==Relationships to other categories==

*The category of pointed topological spaces Top• is a coslice category over Top. 
* The homotopy category hTop has topological spaces for objects and homotopy equivalence classes of continuous maps for morphisms. This is a quotient category of Top. One can likewise form the pointed homotopy category hTop•.
*Top contains the important category Haus of Hausdorff spaces as a full subcategory. The added structure of this subcategory allows for more epimorphisms: in fact, the epimorphisms in this subcategory are precisely those morphisms with dense images in their codomains, so that epimorphisms need not be surjective.
*Top contains the full subcategory CGHaus of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces, which has the important property of being a Cartesian closed category while still containing all of the typical spaces of interest. This makes CGHaus a particularly &quot;convenient category of topological spaces&quot; that is often used in place of Top.
* The forgetful functor to Set has both a left and a right adjoint, as described above in the concrete category section.
* There is a functor to the category of locales Loc sending a topological space to its locale of open sets. This functor has a right adjoint that sends each locale to its topological space of points. This adjunction restricts to an equivalence between the category of sober spaces and spatial locales.
*The homotopy hypothesis relates Top with ∞Grpd, the category of ∞-groupoids. The conjecture states that ∞-groupoids are equivalent to topological spaces modulo weak homotopy equivalence.

<text>In the United States, trolley parks, which started in the 19th century, were picnic and recreation areas along or at the ends of streetcar lines in most of the larger cities. These were precursors to amusement parks. Trolley parks were often created by the streetcar companies to give people a reason to use their services on weekends.

The parks originally consisted of picnic groves and pavilions, and often held events such as dances, concerts and fireworks. Many eventually added features such as swimming pools, carousels, Ferris wheels, roller coasters, sports fields, boats rides, restaurants and other resort facilities to become amusement parks. Various sources report the existence of between 1,500 and 2,000 amusement parks in the United States by 1919.

==Coney Island==

One such location was Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York City, where a horse-drawn streetcar line brought pleasure seekers to the beach beginning in 1829. In 1875, a million passengers rode the railroad to Coney Island, and in 1876 two million reached Coney Island. Hotels and amusements were built to accommodate both the upper-classes and the working-class. The first carousel was installed in the 1870s, the first Switchback Railway in 1881. It wasn&#x27;t until 1895 that the first permanent amusement park in North America opened: Sea Lion Park at Coney Island. This park was one of the first to charge admission for entrance to the park in addition to selling tickets for rides within the park.

In 1897, it was joined by Steeplechase Park, the first of three major amusement parks that would open in the area. George Tilyou designed the park to provide thrills and sweep away the restraints of the Victorian crowds. The combination of the nearby population center of New York City and the ease of access to the area made Coney Island the embodiment of the American amusement park. In addition there was Luna Park (opened in 1903) and Dreamland (opened in 1904). Coney Island was a huge success, and by 1910 attendance on a Sunday could reach a million people.

==Trolley parks decline==

By the early 20th century, there were hundreds of amusement parks, many of them starting as trolley parks, in operation around the U.S. Every major city boasted one or more parks, often based on (or named after) Coney Island, Luna Park, or Dreamland. This began the era of the “golden age” of amusement parks that reigned until the late 1920s. This was an era when the number of hours worked was reduced, while the amount of disposable income rose. The amusement parks reflected the mechanization and efficiency of industrialization, while serving as a source of fantasy and escape from real life.

With the increasing number of automobiles in use, attendance at urban trolley parks gradually declined, due to lack of parking and changing demographics in the urban areas. Although the automobile provided people with more options for satisfying their entertainment needs, amusement parks that were accessible by car continued to be successful and new parks were developed. By the end of the 1920s, amusement parks were to suffer steep declines for various reasons, particularly the Great Depression.

<text>The ailanthus webworm (Atteva aurea) is an ermine moth now found commonly in the United States. It was formerly known under the scientific name &quot;Atteva punctella&quot; (see Taxonomy section). This small, very colorful moth resembles a true bug or beetle when not in flight, but in flight it resembles a wasp.

==Host plants==
The ailanthus webworm is thought to be native to South Florida and the American tropics (south to Costa Rica), which were the habitat of its original larval host plants: the paradise tree (&quot;Simarouba glauca&quot;) and &quot;Simarouba amara&quot;.

Another tree called tree-of-heaven, (&quot;Ailanthus altissima&quot;), originally from China, has been widely introduced into landscapes and invaded into natural areas where &quot;Atteva aurea&quot; has been able to adapt to this new host plant, giving rise to its common name.

&quot;Ailanthus altissima&quot; is considered an invasive species, although it is still sold by nurseries as a yard plant, mainly because it is one of the few species that will grow in highly polluted or otherwise difficult places. &quot;Atteva aurea&quot; can be a minor pest in nurseries, although it rarely does serious damage.
==Climate==
This tropical moth is commonly seen in summer throughout the continental US, and occasionally eastern Canada (its northern limit is eastern Ontario and south-western Quebec beyond the host range). This species appears to be either adapting to colder areas, or staying further north due to changing climates.

==Life cycle==
Larvae produce nests on the host plant by pulling two or more leaflets around a network of loose webbing. Then they consume the leaflets and bark. The caterpillars have a wide, light greenish-brown stripe down their backs and several thin, alternating white and olive-green stripes along their sides. The range of colors is from light brown to dark black. The adult moth visits flowers, is diurnal, and is a pollinator. The life cycle from egg to egg can happen in four weeks. Due to this being a species from warmer areas, it lacks a diapause stage. Larvae can be found from mid-spring to a hard freeze. There may be many generations each summer with eggs being laid on the webs of other larvae. This can result in a communal web that has multiple generations - from eggs to various larva stages to pupae. Mating happens in the mornings with egg-laying apparently happening in the evening. Eggs are found individually, not in clusters, even though each web may contain many separate eggs.

==Taxonomy==

Wilson et al. (2010) discovered that morphologically similar Attevid moths were assigned two different names, &quot;Atteva ergatica&quot; in Costa Rica and &quot;Atteva punctella&quot; in North America, but had identical DNA barcodes.

<doc id="435062" wikidata="Q724349" url="?curid=435062" title="Melon-headed whale">
<text>The melon-headed whale (Peponocephala electra), also known less commonly as the electra dolphin, little killer whale, or many-toothed blackfish, is a toothed whale of the oceanic dolphin family (Delphinidae). The common name is derived from the head shape. Melon-headed whales are widely distributed throughout deep tropical and subtropical waters worldwide, but they are rarely encountered at sea. They are found near shore mostly around oceanic islands, such as Hawaii, French Polynesia, and the Philippines.

==Taxonomy==
The melon-headed whale is the only member of the genus &quot;Peponocephala&quot;. First recorded from a specimen collected in Hawaiʻi in 1841, the species was originally described as a member of the dolphin family and named &quot;Lagenorhynchus electra&quot; by John Edward Gray in 1846. The melon-headed whale was later determined to be sufficiently distinct from other &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot; species to be accorded its own genus. A member of the subfamily Globicephalinae, melon-headed whales are closely related to long-finned and short-finned pilot whales (&quot;Globicephala melas&quot; and &quot;G. macrorhynchus&quot;, respectively) and the pygmy killer whale (&quot;Feresa attenuata&quot;). Collectively, these species (including killer whales &quot;Orcinus orca&quot;, and false killer whales &quot;Pseudorca crassidens&quot;) are known by the common name ‘blackfish’. Melon-headed whales are one of the smallest species of cetacean (after pygmy killer whales) to have the word ‘whale’ in their common name.

==Description==
Melon-headed whales have a robust, dolphin-like body, a tapering, conical head (head shape triangular when viewed from above) with no discernible beak and a relatively tall, falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsal fin located near the middle of the back. Body coloration is charcoal-gray to dark-gray body. A dark face ‘mask’ extends from around the eye to the front of the melon and larger animals have whitish lips. Melon-headed whales have a dark colored dorsal cape that starts narrowly at the front of the head and dips down at a steep angle below the dorsal fin. The boundary between the darker cape and coloration on the flanks is often faint or diffuse. Both the mask and dorsal cape are often only visible in good lighting conditions. Compared to females, adult males have more rounded heads, longer flippers, taller dorsal fins, broader tail flukes and some have a pronounced ventral keel posterior to the anus.

Melon-headed whales grow up to in length, and weigh up to , adult males being slightly larger than females. Length at birth is approximately . Melon-headed whales are physically mature at 13–15 years and live up to 45 years.

===Similar species===
At-sea, melon-headed whales can be confused with pygmy killer whales, which are very similar in appearance and share almost identical habitat and range. The shape of the head, flippers and dorsal cape can be useful diagnostic features. Melon-headed whales have flippers with sharply pointed tips whereas pygmy killer whales have rounded flipper tips, and viewed from above, the head shape is more triangular than the rounded head of the pygmy killer whale. The dorsal cape of melon-headed whales is rounded and dips much lower below the dorsal fin than that of pygmy killer whales, which dips at a relatively shallow angle and is more sharply demarcated in color between the dark cape and lighter flanks. While both species have white around the mouth, in adult pygmy killer whales this can extend onto the face.

Many of these traits are difficult to distinguish in challenging sea and/or lighting conditions, and behavior is often a useful aid to identification. Pygmy killer whales are slower moving (although melon-headed whales often log motionless at the surface), and are usually found in much smaller groups than melon-headed whales. Large groups (more than 100) are more likely to be melon-headed whales. From a distance melon-headed whales could also be confused with false killer whales (&quot;Pseudorca crassidens&quot;), but the much larger size– adult length–long slender body shape and relatively smaller dorsal fin of false killer whales should distinguish them from melon-headed whales.

Stranded/post-mortem individuals can be easily identified by tooth number: melon-headed whales have 20 – 25 pairs of slender teeth (more similar to the teeth of smaller dolphins than other blackfish) in both the upper and lower jaws compared to 8–13 pairs of robust teeth in both the upper and lower jaws for pygmy killer whales.

==Geographic range and distribution==

Melon-headed whales occur in deep tropical/subtropical oceanic waters, between 40°N and 35°S. Although considered an offshore pelagic species, in some regions there are island-associated populations (e.g., Hawaiʻi) and they can be found close to shore associated with oceanic islands and archipelagoes, such as Palmyra and the Philippines. Sightings or strandings at the extremes of their range are likely associated with extensions of warm currents. Melon-headed whales are not known to be migratory.

==Behavior==
===Foraging===
Melon-headed whales feed primarily on pelagic and mesopelagic squid and small fish. Crustaceans (shrimp) have also been reported from stomach contents. Mesopelagic squid and fish species exhibit diel vertical migration behavior, inhabiting greater depths during the day and moving hundreds of meters to shallower depths after dusk to feed on plankton. Melon-headed whales feed at night, when their prey is within the upper of the water column. In the Hawaiian Islands, individuals fitted with depth-transmitting satellite tags made night-time foraging dives that had an average range of , with a maximum dive depth of recorded.

===Social===
Melon-headed whales are a highly social species and usually travel in large groups of 100 – 500 individuals, with occasional sightings of herds as large as 1000–2000. Large herds appear to consist of smaller subgroups that aggregate into larger groups. Data from mass strandings in Japan suggest melon-headed whales may have a matrilineal social structure (i.e., related through female kin/groups organized around an older female and their relatives); the biased sex ratio (higher number of females) of the stranding groups suggesting mature males may move between groups. While melon-headed whales associate in large groups (a common trait amongst the oceanic dolphins, in contrast to the smaller group sizes of other blackfish species) their social structure may be more stable and intermediate between the larger blackfish (pilot whales, killer whales and false killer whales) and smaller oceanic dolphins. However, genetic studies of melon-headed whales across the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic Ocean basins suggest that there is relatively high level of connectivity (inter-breeding) between populations. This indicates that melon-headed whales may not show strong fidelity to their natal group (the group into which the individual was born) and that there are higher rates of movement of individuals between populations than in other blackfish species. Larger group sizes may increase competition for prey resources, requiring large home ranges and broad-scale foraging movements.

Observations of daily activity patterns of melon-headed whales near oceanic islands suggest they spend the mornings resting or logging in near-surface waters after foraging at night. Surface activity (such as tail slapping and spyhopping) and vocalizations associated with socializing (communication whistles, rather than echolocation clicks used for foraging) increase during the afternoons. The daily pattern of behavior observed in island-associated populations, combined with the larger group sizes of melon-headed whales (compared to that typically seen in other blackfish species) is more similar to the fission-fusion social structure of spinner dolphins (&quot;Stenella longirostris&quot;). These behavioral traits may relate to predation avoidance (bigger groups offer some protection from large oceanic sharks) and foraging habits (both species are nocturnal predators that prey on predictable, relatively abundant mesopelagic squid and fish that make diel vertical migrations from the deep-sea to the surface).

Melon-headed whales frequently associate with Fraser&#x27;s dolphins (&quot;Lagenodelphis hosei&quot;), and are also sighted, although less commonly, in mixed herds with other dolphin species such as spinner dolphins, common bottlenose dolphins (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;), rough-toothed dolphins (&quot;Steno bredanensis&quot;), short-finned pilot whales and pantropical spotted dolphins (&quot;Stenella attenuata&quot;).

A unique case of inter-species adoption between (presumably) an orphaned melon-headed whale calf and a common bottlenose dolphin mother was recorded in French Polynesia. The calf was first observed in 2014 at less than one month of age, swimming with the bottlenose dolphin female and her own biological offspring. The melon-headed whale calf was observed suckling from the bottlenose dolphin female, and was repeatedly sighted with its adoptive/foster mother until 2018.

In August 2017 off the island of Kauaʻi, Hawaiʻi, a hybrid between a melon-headed whale and rough-toothed dolphin was observed travelling with a melon-headed whale amongst a group of rough-toothed dolphins. The hybrid superficially resembled a melon-headed whale, but closer observation revealed it had features of both species and some features intermediate between the two species, particularly in head shape. Genetic testing of a skin biopsy sample confirmed that the individual was a hybrid between a female melon-headed whale and a rough-toothed dolphin male.

===Predators===
Melon-headed whales may be preyed upon by large sharks and killer whales. Scars and wounds from non-lethal bites of cookie cutter sharks (&quot;Isitius brasiliensis&quot;) have been observed on free-ranging and stranded animals.

===Breeding===
Little is known about the reproductive behavior of melon-headed whales. The most information comes from analyses of large stranding groups in Japanese waters, where sexual maturity for females is reached at 7 years of age. Females give birth to a single calf every 3–4 years after a gestation of approximately 12 months. Off Japan, the calving season appears to be long (from April to October) without an obvious peak. In Hawaiian waters newborn melon-headed whales have been observed in all months except December, suggesting births occur year-round, but sightings of newborns peak between March and June. Newborn melon-headed whales have been observed in April and June in the Philippines. In the Southern Hemisphere calving also appears to occur over an extended period, from August to December.

===Strandings===
Melon-headed whales are known to mass strand, often in groups numbering in the hundreds, indicative of the strong social bonds within herds of this species. Mass strandings of melon-headed whales have been reported in Hawaiʻi, eastern Japan, the Philippines, northern Australia, Madagascar, Brazil and the Cape Verde Islands. Two of these mass stranding events have been linked to anthropogenic sonar, associated with naval activities in Hawaiʻi and high frequency multi-beam sonar used for oil and gas exploration in Madagascar. The mass stranding at Hanalei Bay, Kauaʻi, Hawaiʻi is more precisely described as a ‘near’ mass stranding event, as the group of &gt;150 melon-headed whales was prevented from stranding by human intervention. The animals occupied the shallow waters of a confined bay for over 28 hours before being herded back into deeper waters by stranding response staff and volunteers, community members, state and federal authorities. Only a single calf is known to have died on this occasion. The frequency of mass strandings of melon-headed whales appears to have increased over the past 30+ years.

===Movement===

Melon-headed whales are fast swimmers; they travel in large, tightly packed groups and can create a lot of spray when surfacing, often porpoising (repeatedly leaping clear of the water surface at a shallow angle) when travelling at speed, and are known to spyhop and also may jump clear out of the water. Melon-headed whales can be wary of boats, but in some regions will approach boats and bow-ride.

==Population status==
The world population is unknown, but abundance estimates for large regions are approximately 45,000 in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean, 2,235 in northern Gulf of Mexico and in the Philippines 920 in the eastern Sulu Sea and 1,380 in Tañon Strait between Cebu and Negros Islands. There are two known populations in Hawaiʻi: a population of approximately 450 individuals resident to shallower waters of the northwest side of Hawaiʻi Island (the ‘Kohola resident population’) and a much larger population of approximately 8,000 individuals that moves among the main Hawaiian Islands in deeper waters.

Because the Hawaiʻi Island resident population has a restricted range (sightings have only been recorded off the northwest side of Hawaiʻi Island), and at times most of, or the entire resident population can be together in a single group, there is some concern that this population may be at risk from fisheries interactions, and exposure to anthropogenic noise, particularly in light of U.S. Navy activities in the region, given the potential link between sonar and mass stranding events.

==Interactions with humans==
===Fisheries bycatch===
Small cetaceans such as melon-headed whales are vulnerable to fisheries bycatch and may be injured or killed through interactions with fisheries or entanglement in lost or discarded netting. Small numbers of melon-headed whales have been caught incidentally in the longline fishery targeting tuna and swordfish off Mayotte, and in driftnet fisheries in the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Ghana and India. In the eastern tropical Pacific purse-seine tuna fisheries, melon-headed whales have been rarely taken as bycatch. and have not been recorded in the southwest Indian Ocean purse-seine fishery Individual melon-headed whales exhibit injuries such as body scars and dorsal fin disfigurements likely due to interactions with fisheries in Hawaiʻi and near Mayotte in the Mozambique Channel Islands. The small numbers of injured individuals observed near Mayotte suggests that either interactions with the pelagic longline fishery in this region are rare for this species, or that individuals are more often killed rather than injured. Mortalities are also likely in other countries where gill- or driftnet fisheries occur, however data on bycatch in many regions are sparse. Animals caught as bycatch are sometimes used as bait in fisheries.

===Hunting===
Individuals are taken for bait or human consumption in small cetacean subsistence and harpoon fisheries in several regions, including Sri Lanka, the Caribbean, the Philippines and Indonesia. At Dixcove port in Ghana, melon-headed whales are the third highest cetacean species caught for ‘marine bushmeat’ by artisanal fishermen, through both bycatch from drift gillnets and occasional directed catch. The Japanese drive fishery has taken herds of melon-headed whales occasionally in the past. In the early 2020s, between 67 and 230 melon-headed whales were hunted annually in the Taiji dolphin drive hunt.

===Pollution===
Environmental contaminants stemming from plastic debris, oil spills and dumping of industrial wastes at-sea, in addition to agricultural run-off from terrestrial sources, can lead to bioaccumulation in marine ecosystems and pose a threat to melon-headed whales (as with all marine mammals and long-lived, high trophic level consumers). Persistent organic pollutants (POPs)–include environmental contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides e.g. dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and organobromine compounds such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)–are lipophilic (fat-soluble) and can accumulate in the blubber of marine mammals. In high concentrations these pollutants can interfere with overall health, hormone levels and affect both the immune and reproductive systems. Females with high contaminant levels can pass contaminant loads across the placenta or via lactation from mother to calf, leading to calf mortality. Blubber samples from melon-headed whales stranded in Japan and Hawaiʻi were found to have PCB concentrations above thresholds considered toxic. Off Japan the levels of PBDE and chlordane related compounds (CHL) in blubber increased during 1980–2000.

===Noise===
Melon-headed whales may be vulnerable to impacts from anthropogenic (human generated) noise, such as those associated with military sonar activities, seismic surveys and high power multi-beam echosounder operations. Based on previous stranding events linking mass strandings with sonar, melon-headed whales appear to be one of the more sensitive species to mid-frequency active sonar (1 to 10 kHz) used in military operations and other types of sonar. For island-associated populations, such as those in the Hawaiian archipelago, Palmyra Atoll and the Marquesas Islands, exposure to anthropogenic noise could result in displacement from important habitat.

===Whale watching===
Regions in which melon-headed whales can be reliably sighted are few, however Hawai’i, the Maldives, the Philippines, and in the eastern Caribbean, especially around Dominica, are the best places to see them. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) has guidelines for whale watching to ensure minimum disturbance to wildlife, but not every operator adheres to them.

==Conservation status==
The melon-headed whale is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. There is little information available on current levels of bycatch and commercial hunting, therefore the potential effects on melon-headed whale populations are undetermined. The current population trend is unknown.

The species is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The melon-headed whale is included in the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU). As with all other marine mammal species, the melon-headed whale is protected in United States waters under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).

<text>&quot;The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information&quot; is one of the most highly cited papers in psychology. It was written by the cognitive psychologist George A. Miller of Harvard University&#x27;s Department of Psychology and published in 1956 in &quot;Psychological Review&quot;. It is often interpreted to argue that the number of objects an average human can hold in short-term memory is 7 ± 2. This has occasionally been referred to as &quot;Miller&#x27;s law&quot;.

== Miller&#x27;s article ==
In his article, Miller discussed a coincidence between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and the limits of short-term memory. In a one-dimensional absolute-judgment task, a person is presented with a number of stimuli that vary on one dimension (e.g., 10 different tones varying only in pitch) and responds to each stimulus with a corresponding response (learned before). Performance is nearly perfect up to five or six different stimuli but declines as the number of different stimuli increases. The task can be described as one of information transmission: The input consists of one out of &quot;n&quot; possible stimuli, and the output consists of one out of &quot;n&quot; responses. The information contained in the input can be determined by the number of binary decisions that need to be made to arrive at the selected stimulus, and the same holds for the response. Therefore, people&#x27;s maximum performance on a one-dimensional absolute judgment can be characterized as an information channel capacity with approximately 2 to 3 bits of information, which corresponds to the ability to distinguish between four and eight alternatives.

The second cognitive limitation Miller discusses is memory span. Memory span refers to the longest list of items (e.g., digits, letters, words) that a person can repeat back in the correct order on 50% of trials immediately after the presentation. Miller observed that the memory span of young adults is approximately seven items. He noticed that memory span is approximately the same for stimuli with vastly different amounts of information—for instance, binary digits have 1 bit each; decimal digits have 3.32 bits each; words have about 10 bits each. Miller concluded that memory span is not limited in terms of bits but rather in terms of chunks. A chunk is the largest meaningful unit in the presented material that the person recognizes—thus, what counts as a chunk depends on the knowledge of the person being tested. For instance, a word is a single chunk for a speaker of the language but is many chunks for someone who is totally unfamiliar with the language and sees the word as a collection of phonetic segments.

Miller recognized that the correspondence between the limits of one-dimensional absolute judgment and of short-term memory span was only a coincidence, because only the first limit, not the second, can be characterized in information-theoretic terms (i.e., as a roughly constant number of bits). Therefore, there is nothing &quot;magical&quot; about the number seven, and Miller used the expression only rhetorically. Nevertheless, the idea of a &quot;magical number 7&quot; inspired much theorizing, rigorous and less rigorous, about the capacity limits of human cognition. The number seven constitutes a useful heuristic, reminding us that lists that are much longer than that become significantly harder to remember and process simultaneously.

== The &quot;magical number 7&quot; and working memory capacity ==
Later research on short-term memory and working memory revealed that memory span is not a constant even when measured in a number of chunks. The number of chunks a human can recall immediately after presentation depends on the category of chunks used (e.g., span is around seven for digits, around six for letters, and around five for words), and even on features of the chunks within a category. Chunking is used by the brain&#x27;s short-term memory as a method for keeping groups of information accessible for easy recall. It functions and works best as labels that one is already familiar with—the incorporation of new information into a label that is already well rehearsed into one&#x27;s long-term memory. These chunks must store the information in such a way that they can be disassembled into the necessary data. 

The storage capacity is dependent on the information being stored. For instance, span is lower for long words than it is for short words. In general, memory span for verbal contents (digits, letters, words, etc.) strongly depends on the time it takes to speak the contents aloud. Some researchers have therefore proposed that the limited capacity of short-term memory for verbal material is not a &quot;magic number&quot; but rather a &quot;magic spell,&quot; i.e. a period of time. Baddeley used this finding to postulate that one component of his model of working memory, the phonological loop, is capable of holding around 2 seconds of sound. However, the limit of short-term memory cannot easily be characterized as a constant &quot;magic spell&quot; either, because memory span also depends on other factors besides speaking duration. For instance, span depends on the lexical status of the contents (i.e., whether the contents are words known to the person or not). Several other factors also affect a person&#x27;s measured span, and therefore it is difficult to pin down the capacity of short-term or working memory to a number of chunks. Nonetheless, Cowan has proposed that working memory has a capacity of about four chunks in young adults (and less in children and older adults).

Tarnow finds that in a classic experiment typically argued as supporting a 4 item buffer by Murdock, there is in fact no evidence for such and thus the &quot;magical number&quot;, at least in the Murdock experiment, is 1. Other prominent theories of short-term memory capacity argue against measuring capacity in terms of a fixed number of elements.

== Other cognitive numeric limits ==
Cowan also noted a number of other limits of cognition that point to a &quot;magical number four&quot;, and different from Miller, he argued that this correspondence is no coincidence. One other process that seems to be limited at about four elements is subitizing, the rapid enumeration of small numbers of objects. When a number of objects are flashed briefly, their number can be determined very quickly, at a glance, when the number does not exceed the subitizing limit, which is about four objects. Larger numbers of objects must be counted, which is a slower process. 

The film 1988 &quot;Rain Man&quot; portrayed an autistic savant, who was able to rapidly determine the number of toothpicks from an entire box spilled on the floor, apparently subitizing a much larger number than four objects. A similar feat was informally observed by neuropsychologist Oliver Sacks and reported in his book 1985 &quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot;. Therefore, one might suppose that this limit is an arbitrary limit imposed by our cognition rather than necessarily being a physical limit. Autism expert Daniel Tammet has suggested, however, that the children Sacks observed may have pre-counted the matches in the box. There is also evidence that even four chunks is a high estimate: Gobet and Clarkson at Brunel University London conducted an experiment and found that over half of the memory recall conditions yielded only about two chunks. Research also shows that the size, rather than the number, of chunks that are stored in short-term memory is what allows for enhanced memory in individuals.

<text>In the United Kingdom, representative peers were those peers elected by the members of the Peerage of Scotland and the Peerage of Ireland to sit in the British House of Lords. Until 1999, all members of the Peerage of England held the right to sit in the House of Lords; they did not elect a limited group of representatives. All peers who were created after 1707 as Peers of Great Britain and after 1801 as Peers of the United Kingdom held the same right to sit in the House of Lords.

Representative peers were introduced in 1707, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland were united into the Kingdom of Great Britain. At the time there were 168 English and 154 Scottish peers. The English peers feared that the House of Lords would be swamped by the Scottish element, and consequently the election of a small number of representative peers to represent Scotland was negotiated. A similar arrangement was adopted when the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland merged into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in January 1801.

Scotland was allowed to elect sixteen representative peers, while Ireland could elect twenty-eight. Those chosen by Scotland sat for the life of one Parliament, and following each dissolution new Scottish peers were elected. In contrast, Irish representative peers sat for life. Elections for Irish peers ceased when the Irish Free State came into existence as a dominion in December 1922. However, already-elected Irish peers continued to be entitled to sit until their death. Elections for Scottish peers ended in 1963, when all Scottish peers obtained the right to sit in the House of Lords.

Under the House of Lords Act 1999, a new form of representative peer was introduced to allow some hereditary peers to stay in the House of Lords.

==Scotland==


Under articles XXII and XXIII of the Act of Union 1707, Scottish peers were entitled to elect sixteen representative peers to the House of Lords. Each served for one Parliament or a maximum of seven years, but could be re-elected during future Parliaments. Upon the summons of a new Parliament, the Sovereign would issue a proclamation summoning Scottish peers to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The elections were held in the Great Gallery, a large room decorated by eighty-nine of Jacob de Wet&#x27;s portraits of Scottish monarchs, from Fergus Mór to Charles II. The Lord Clerk Register would read out the Peerage Roll as indicates his presence when called. The Roll was then re–read, with each peer responding by publicly announcing his votes and the return being sent to the clerk of the crown at London. The same procedure was used whenever a vacancy arose.

The block voting system was used, with each peer casting as many votes as there were seats to be filled. The system permitted the party with the greatest number of peers, normally the Conservatives, to procure a disproportionate number of seats, with opposing parties sometimes being left entirely unrepresented. The Lord Clerk Register was responsible for tallying the votes. The return issued by the Lord Clerk Register was sufficient evidence to admit the representative peers to Parliament; unlike other peers, Scottish representatives did not receive writs of summons.
The position and rights of Scottish peers in relation to the House of Lords remained unclear during most of the eighteenth century. In 1711, The 4th Duke of Hamilton, a peer of Scotland, was made Duke of Brandon in the Peerage of Great Britain. When he sought to sit in the House of Lords, he was denied admittance, the Lords ruling that a peer of Scotland could not sit in the House of Lords unless he was a representative peer, even if he also held a British peerage dignity. They reasoned that the Act of Union 1707 had established the number of Scots peers in the House of Lords at no more and no less than sixteen. In 1782, however, the House of Lords reversed the decision, holding that the Crown could admit anyone it pleases to the House of Lords, whether a Scottish peer or not, subject only to qualifications such as being of full age.

Under the Peerage Act 1963, all Scottish peers procured the right to sit in the House of Lords, and the system of electing representative peers was abolished. Scottish as well as British and English hereditary peers lost their automatic right to sit in the Upper House with the passage of the House of Lords Act 1999. During the debate on the House of Lords Bill, a question arose as to whether the proposal would violate the Treaty of Union. In suggesting that the Bill did indeed violate the Articles of Union, it was submitted that, prior to Union, the Estates of Parliament, Scotland&#x27;s old, pre-Union parliament, was entitled to impose conditions, and that one fundamental condition was a guarantee of representation of Scotland in both Houses of Parliament at Westminster. It was implied, furthermore, that the Peerage Act 1963 did not violate the requirement of Scottish representation, set out in the Article XXII of the Treaty of Union, by allowing all Scottish peers to sit in the House of Lords: as long as a minimum of sixteen seats were reserved for Scotland, the principles of the Article would be upheld. It was further argued that the only way to rescind the requirement of Article XXII would be to dissolve the Union between England and Scotland, which the House of Lords Bill did not seek to do.

Counsel for the Government held a different view. It was noted that the Peerage Act 1963 explicitly repealed the portions of the Articles of Union relating to elections of representative peers, and that no parliamentary commentators had raised doubts as to the validity of those repeals. As Article XXII had been, at least purportedly, repealed, there was nothing specific in the Treaty that the bill transgressed. It was further asserted by the Government that Article XXII could be repealed because it had not been entrenched. Examples of entrenched provisions are numerous: England and Scotland were united &quot;forever&quot;, the Court of Session was to remain &quot;in all time coming within Scotland as it is now constituted&quot;, and the establishment of the Church of Scotland was &quot;effectually and unalterably secured&quot;. Article XXII, however, did not include any words of entrenchment that would have made it &quot;fundamental or unalterable in all time coming&quot;.

Further, the Government pointed out that, even if the election of Scottish peers were entrenched, Parliament could amend the provision under the doctrine of Parliamentary sovereignty. Though the position of the Church of Scotland was &quot;unalterably&quot; secured, the Universities (Scotland) Act 1853 repealed the requirement that professors declare their faith before assuming a position. In Ireland, the Church of Ireland was entirely disestablished in 1869, though the Articles of Union with Ireland had clearly entrenched the establishment of that body. In December 1922, the Union with most of Ireland was dissolved upon the creation of the Irish Free State, though Great Britain and all of Ireland were supposedly united &quot;forever.&quot; It was therefore suggested that Parliament could, if it pleased, repeal an Article of Union as well amend as any underlying principle.

The Privileges Committee unanimously found that the Articles of Union would not be breached by the House of Lords Bill if it were enacted. The bill did receive Royal Assent, and from 1999, hereditary peers have not had the automatic right to sit in Parliament.

==Ireland==

Irish representation in the Westminster parliament was outlined by articles IV and VIII of the agreement embodied in the Acts of Union 1800, which also required the Irish Parliament to pass an act before the union providing details for implementation.

Irish peers were allowed to elect twenty-eight representative peers as Lords Temporal, each of whom could serve for life. The Chamber of the Irish House of Lords, located in Parliament House on College Green in central Dublin, housed the first election, attended by the peers or their proxies. The government mistakenly circulated a list of the successful candidates before the vote. The Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper in Ireland was responsible for electoral arrangements; each peer voted by an open and public ballot. After the Union, new elections were held by postal vote within 52 days of a vacancy. Vacancies arose through death or, in the case of Baron Ashtown in 1915, bankruptcy. No vacancy was created where a representative peer acquired a UK peerage, as when Lord Curzon was made Earl Curzon of Kedleston in 1911.

The Lord Chancellor of Great Britain—the presiding officer of the House of Lords—certified the vacancy, while the Lord Chancellor of Ireland directed the Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper to issue ballots to Irish peers, receive the completed ballots, determine the victor, and announce the result, which was then published in both &quot;The Dublin Gazette&quot; and &quot;The London Gazette&quot;. Roman Catholic peers could not vote or stand for election until the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. The process of being recognised by the Westminster Committee of Privileges as an elector was more cumbersome and expensive than being recognised as a (British or Irish) peer, until the orders drawn up in 1800 were amended in 1857. Successive governments tried to prevent the election of absentee landlords. An exception was Lord Curzon, who won election as a representative peer in 1908, despite never having claimed the right to be an elector; he had been refused a peerage of the United Kingdom by the Liberal government of the day.

The Acts of Union united the Church of England and Church of Ireland, whose bishops and archbishops had previously sat as Lords Spiritual in their respective Houses of Lords. In the united Parliament, there were at first four Irish prelates at any one time, one archbishop and three diocesan bishops, who sat for a session before ceding their seats to colleagues on a fixed rotation of dioceses. The rotation passed over any bishop already serving as an elected representative peer, as when Charles Agar sat as Viscount Somerton rather than as Archbishop of Dublin. The rotation was changed by the Church Temporalities Act 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. 37), which merged many dioceses and degraded the archbishoprics of Tuam and Cashel to bishoprics. No Irish bishops sat in Westminster as Lords Spiritual after the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871, brought about by the Irish Church Act 1869, although Robin Eames was made a life peer in 1995 while Archbishop of Armagh.

===Abolition and attempts to reintroduce===
Following the establishment of the Irish Free State in December 1922, Irish peers ceased to elect representatives, although those already elected continued to have the right to serve for life; the last of the temporal peers, Francis Needham, 4th Earl of Kilmorey, by chance a peer from an Ulster family, died in 1961. Disputes had arisen long before as to whether Irish representative peers could still be elected. The main Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922 was silent on the matter, to some seeming to mean that the right had not been abolished, but the ancillary Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922 had abolished the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland, whose involvement was required in the election process. The Irish Free State abolished the office of Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper in 1926, the last holder becoming Master of the High Court. After 1922 various Irish peers petitioned the House of Lords for a restoration of their right to elect representatives. In 1962, the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform again rejected such requests. In the next year, when the Peerage Act 1963 (which, among other things, gave all peers in the Peerage of Scotland the right to sit in the House of Lords) was being considered, an amendment similarly to allow Irish peers all to be summoned was defeated, by ninety votes to eight. Instead, the new Act confirmed the right of all Irish peers to stand for election to the House of Commons and to vote at parliamentary elections, which were rights they had always had.

In 1965, the 8th Earl of Antrim, another peer from Ulster, and other Irish peers, petitioned the House of Lords, arguing that the right to elect representative peers had never been formally abolished. The House of Lords ruled against them. Lord Reid, a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, based his ruling on the Act of Union, which stated that representative peers sat &quot;on the part of Ireland.&quot; He reasoned that, since the island had been divided into the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland, there was no such political entity called &quot;Ireland&quot; which the representative peers could be said to represent. Lord Reid wrote, &quot;A statutory provision is impliedly repealed if a later enactment brings to an end a state of things the continuance of which is essential for its operation.&quot; In contrast, Lord Wilberforce, another Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, disagreed that a major enactment such as the Act of Union could be repealed by implication. He argued instead that since the posts of Lord Chancellor of Ireland and Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper had been abolished, there was no mechanism by which Irish peers could be elected. Here too, the petitioners lost.

The petitioners failed to raise the status of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. Charles Lysaght suggests that if this fact had been foremost, Lord Wilberforce&#x27;s arguments relating to the removal of the electoral mechanism for the election could be rebutted, as the Lord Chancellor of Ireland and the Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper did have successors in Northern Ireland. The reason for excluding the arguments relating to Northern Ireland from the petition &quot;was that leading counsel for the petitioning Irish peers was convinced that the members of the Committee for Privileges were with him on what he considered was his best argument and did not want to alienate them by introducing another point.&quot; To prevent further appeals on the matter, Parliament repealed, as a part of the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1971, the sections of the Acts of Union relating to the election of Irish representative peers.

==House of Commons==
After the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, Scottish peers, including those who did not sit as representative peers, were excluded from the House of Commons. Irish peers were not subject to the same restrictions. Irish members not nominated as representative peers were allowed to serve in Parliament as representatives of constituencies in Great Britain, although not in Ireland, provided they gave up their privileges as a peer. Lord Curzon, for example, specifically requested an Irish peerage when made Viceroy of India, so that he would not be debarred from sitting in the House of Commons on his return.

The Peerage Act 1963 allowed all Scottish peers to sit in the House of Lords; it also permitted all Irish peers to sit in the House of Commons for any constituency in the United Kingdom, as well as to vote in parliamentary elections, without being deprived of the remaining privileges of peerage.

==Hereditary &quot;representative peers&quot;==

During the passage of the House of Lords Bill in 1999, controversy surrounding House of Lords reform remained, and the Bill was conceived as a first stage of Lords reform. The &quot;Weatherill&quot; amendment—so called since it was proposed by former House of Commons Speaker Bernard Weatherill—provided for a number of hereditary peers to remain as members of the House of Lords, during the first stage of Lords reform. It could then be reviewed during the next stage of the reform, when the system of appointed life peerages came under examination. In exchange for the House not delaying the passage of the Bill into law, the Government agreed to this amendment, and it then became part of the House of Lords Act 1999, and 92 hereditary peers were allowed to remain.

The ninety-two peers are made up of three separate groups. Fifteen &#x27;office-holders&#x27; comprise deputy speakers and deputy chairmen, and are elected by the house, while seventy-five party and Crossbench members are elected by their own party or group. In addition, there are two royal appointments: the Lord Great Chamberlain, currently Lord Carrington, is appointed as the King&#x27;s representative in Parliament, while the post of Earl Marshal remains purely hereditary; the office has been held since 1672 by the Dukes of Norfolk and is responsible for ceremonies such as the State Opening of Parliament.

<text>Mark Wing-Davey (born 30 November 1948) is a British actor and director. He portrayed Zaphod Beeblebrox in the radio and television versions of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;.

==Early life==
The son of actor Peter Davey and actress Anna Wing, Wing-Davey attended Woolverstone Hall School in Suffolk before studying English at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was a member of the Footlights between 1967 and 1970.

==Career==
He had a featured role in the 1976 miniseries &quot;The Glittering Prizes&quot;. This role was later cited by Geoffrey Perkins as the likely reason for his being cast in arguably his most memorable role, that of the two-headed Galactic President, Zaphod Beeblebrox, in the radio and TV versions of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, written by Douglas Adams. He played a barrister in some episodes of the ITV television series &quot;Crown Court&quot;, King Henry V in Episode 3 of James Burke&#x27;s &quot;Connections&quot;, a record company executive in the film &quot;Breaking Glass&quot; (1980) and an accountant in &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;.

In the 1983 television production of Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot;, Wing-Davey played Prince Hamlet in the re-enactment of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre&#x27;s 1958 tour of &quot;Hamlet&quot; to Moscow. His theatre credits include James Stock&#x27;s &quot;Star-Gazy Pie and Sauerkraut&quot; (Royal Court Theatre, 1995) and Caryl Churchill&#x27;s &quot;Mad Forest&quot;, for which he won an Obie award. He was the first Artistic Director of The Actors Centre, London.

In 2003, he returned to the role of Zaphod Beeblebrox for the Above the Title production of the Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide Tertiary to Quintessential Phase radio dramas for BBC Radio 4. More recently he has provided the voice of Judge Ghis in the English version of &quot;Final Fantasy XII&quot;. Wing-Davey directed the off-Broadway production of &quot;Unconditional&quot; by Brett C. Leonard at The Public Theater. It was put up by Philip Seymour Hoffman&#x27;s theater group, LAByrinth Theater Company, of which he is a member. It opened in February 2008.

In May 2008, New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts announced that Wing-Davey had been named Chairman of, and arts professor in, the School&#x27;s Graduate Acting Program. He reprised the role of Zaphod Beeblebrox in 2012 for a live tour of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. Also in 2012, Wing-Davey directed the world premiere of Brett C. Leonard&#x27;s &quot;Ninth and Joanie&quot; in a LAByrinth Theater Company production. In 2013, he directed William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot; at Berkeley Repertory Theatre.

==Personal life==
In 1973, while working as a theatre company member in Sheffield, he met actress Anita Carey. The two began living together the following year after they appeared in a production together. They got married in 2002. The pair had two children together. Carey died in 2023.

<doc id="435078" wikidata="Q155511" url="?curid=435078" title="Plant nursery">
<text>A nursery is a place where plants are propagated and grown to a desired size. Mostly the plants concerned are for gardening, forestry, or conservation biology, rather than agriculture. They include retail nurseries, which sell to the general public; wholesale nurseries, which sell only to businesses such as other nurseries and commercial gardeners; and private nurseries, which supply the needs of institutions or private estates. Some will also work in plant breeding.

A &quot;nurseryman&quot; is a person who owns or works in a nursery.

Some nurseries specialize in certain areas, which may include: propagation and the selling of small or bare root plants to other nurseries; growing out plant materials to a saleable size, or retail sales. Nurseries may also specialize in one type of plant, e.g., groundcovers, shade plants, or rock garden plants. Some produce bulk stock, whether seedlings or grafted trees, of particular varieties for purposes such as fruit trees for orchards or timber trees for forestry. Some producers produce stock seasonally, ready in the spring for export to colder regions where propagation could not have been started so early or to regions where seasonal pests prevent profitable growing early in the season.

==Nurseries==
There are a number of different types of nurseries, broadly grouped as wholesale or retail nurseries, with some overlap depending on the specific operation. Wholesale nurseries produce plants in large quantities which are sold to retail nurseries

Wholesale nurseries may be small operations that produce a specific type of plant using a small area of land, or very larger operations covering many acres. They propagate plant material or buy plants from other nurseries which may include rooted or unrooted cuttings, or small rooted plants called plugs, or field ~grown bare root plants, which are planted and grown to a desired size. Some wholesale nurseries produce plants on contract for others which place an order for a specific number and size of plant, while others produce a wide range of plants that are offered for sale to other nurseries and landscapers and sold as first come first served. Retail nurseries sell plants ready to be placed in the landscape or used in homes and businesses.

==Methods==
Propagation nurseries produce new plants from seeds, cuttings, tissue culture, grafting, or division. The plants are then grown out to a salable size and either sold to other nurseries that may continue to grow the plants out in larger containers or field grow them to desired size. Propagation nurseries may also sell plant material large enough for retail sales and thus sale directly to retail nurseries or garden centers (which rarely propagated their own plants).

Nurseries may produce plants for reforestation, zoos, parks, and cities. Tree nurseries in the U.S. produce around 1.3 billion seedlings per year for reforestation projects.
Nurseries grow plants in open fields, on container fields, in tunnels or greenhouses. In open fields, nurseries grow decorative trees, shrubs and herbaceous perennials. On a containerfield nurseries grow small trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants, usually destined for sales in garden centers. These have proper ventilation, sunlight etc. Plants may be grown by seeds, but the most common method is by planting cuttings, which can be taken from shoot tips or roots.

==Conditioning==

With the objective of fitting planting stock more able to withstand stresses after outplanting, various nursery treatments have been attempted or developed and applied to nursery stock. Buse and Day (1989), for instance, studied the effect of conditioning of white spruce and black spruce transplants on their morphology, physiology, and subsequent performance after outplanting. Root pruning, wrenching, and fertilization with potassium at 375 kg/ha were the treatments applied. Root pruning and wrenching modified stock in the nursery by decreasing height, root collar diameter, shoot:root ratio, and bud size, but did not improve survival or growth after planting. Fertilization reduced root growth in black spruce but not of white spruce.

== Important factors for nursery production ==
For a nursery to produce healthy crops, they must manage many factors, a few of them being irrigation, landscape topography, and soil conditions of the site.

Irrigation

Plants need water to grow. Water needs will vary depending on plant species, weather, and soil. An example is in Ontario, irrigation water is used most in late spring and in summer, when plants need water most, and based on climate patterns in Ontario, this time is also when there is the least amount of rainfall. Some nurseries will create water sources by building a dam, or changing a watercourse. or building manmade ponds. The water source and water pumps should to be close to fields In this situation, water will need testing for pH, and testing for chemicals in the water to ensure an acceptable water quality.  Two common types of irrigation systems are drip irrigation, and overhead irrigation.

Landscape Topography

A good slope for a plant nursery is 1–2 degrees. Any more than 5 degrees will make the nursery susceptible to soil erosion. The nursery stock should be planted in rows running across the slopes. If the landscape of the nursery has sections of land where erosion could occur, the nursery needs to come up with a solution such as by using erosion prevention structures like rip rap. Topography impacts nursery design and layout and it is a factor in strategizing what direction to plant rows. It also impacts where windbreaks should be planted. If an area has a flat slope and is open, it will need a windbreak.

Soil Conditions

For a nursery to produce healthy crops, it will need to have healthy soil. The soil should have good drainage and nutrient holding capacity. Soil testing will help a nursery find out its pH levels, and also the amounts of nutrients in the soil. To test soil drainage, one method is to dig an 18&quot; deep hole that is at least 4&quot; in diameter. Fill the hole with water, and leave it for an hour. This will allow the soil to saturate. Next, fill the hole with water again but leave the top 2&quot; of soil in the hole without water. Wait an hour then return to the hole with a measurement tool like a ruler to find out how much water has drained from the hole. The corresponding measurements will allow the tester to decide what type of drainage capacity their soil has. If the water level drops 1/2&quot; or less it is poor draining. If water drops 1/2&quot; to 1&quot;, it drains at a medium rate. 1&quot;&lt; means that the soil drains quickly.

===Hardening off, frost hardiness===
Seedlings vary in their susceptibility to injury from frost. Damage can be catastrophic if &quot;unhardened&quot; seedlings are exposed to frost. Frost hardiness may be defined as the minimum temperature at which a certain percentage of a random seedling population will survive or will sustain a given level of damage (Siminovitch 1963, Timmis and Worrall 1975). The term LT50 (lethal temperature for 50% of a population) is commonly used. Determination of frost hardiness in Ontario is based on electrolyte leakage from mainstem terminal tips 2 cm to 3 cm long in weekly samplings (Colombo and Hickie 1987). The tips are frozen then thawed, immersed in distilled water, the electrical conductivity of which depends on the degree to which cell membranes have been ruptured by freezing releasing electrolyte. A −15 °C frost hardiness level has been used to determine the readiness of container stock to be moved outside from the greenhouse, and −40 °C has been the level determining readiness for frozen storage (Colombo 1997).

In an earlier technique, potted seedlings were placed in a freezer chest and cooled to some level for some specific duration; a few days after removal, seedlings were assessed for damage using various criteria, including odour, general visual appearance, and examination of cambial tissue (Ritchie 1982).

Stock for fall planting must be properly hardened-off. Conifer seedlings are considered to be hardened off when the terminal buds have formed and the stem and root tissues have ceased growth. Other characteristics that in some species indicate dormancy are color and stiffness of the needles, but these are not apparent in white spruce.

==Forest tree nurseries==

Whether in the forest or in the nursery, seedling growth is fundamentally influenced by soil fertility, but nursery soil fertility is readily amenable to amelioration, much more so than is forest soil.

Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are regularly supplied as fertilizers, and calcium and magnesium are supplied occasionally. Applications of fertilizer nitrogen do not build up in the soil to develop any appreciable storehouse of available nitrogen for future crops. Phosphorus and potassium, however, can be accumulated as a storehouse available for extended periods.

Fertilization permits seedling growth to continue longer through the growing season than unfertilized stock; fertilized white spruce attained twice the height of unfertilized. High fertility in the rooting medium favours shoot growth over root growth, and can produce top-heavy seedlings ill-suited to the rigors of the outplant site. Nutrients in oversupply can reduce growth or the uptake of other nutrients. As well, an excess of nutrient ions can prolong or weaken growth to interfere with the necessary development of dormancy and hardening of tissues in time to withstand winter weather.

===Stock types, sizes and lots===

Nursery stock size typically follows the normal curve when lifted for planting stock. The runts at the lower end of the scale are usually culled to an arbitrary limit, but, especially among bareroot stock, the range in size is commonly considerable. Dobbs (1976) and McMinn (1985a) examined how the performance of 2+0 bareroot white spruce related to differences in initial size of planting stock. The stock was regraded into large, medium, and small fractions according to fresh weight. The small fraction (20% of the original stock) had barely one-quarter of the dry matter mass of the large fraction at the time of outplanting. Ten years later, in the blade-scarified site, seedlings of the large fraction had almost 50% greater stem volume than had seedlings of the small fraction. Without site preparation, large stock were more than twice the size of small stock after 10 years.

Similar results were obtained with regraded 2+1 transplants sampled to determine root growth capacity. The large stock had higher RGC as well as greater mass than the small stock fraction.

The value of large size at the time of planting is especially apparent when outplants face strong competition from other vegetation, although high initial mass does not guarantee success. That the growth potential of planting stock depends on much more than size seems clear from the indifferent success of the transplanting of small 2+0 seedlings for use as 2+1 &quot;reclaim&quot; transplants. The size of bareroot white spruce seedlings and transplants also had a major influence on field performance.

The field performance among various stock types in Ontario plantations was examined by Paterson and Hutchison (1989): the white spruce stock types were 2+0, 1.5+0.5, 1.5+1.5, and 3+0. The nursery stock was grown at Midhurst Forest Tree Nursery, and carefully handled through lifting on 3 lift dates, packing, and hot-planting into cultivated weed-free loam. After 7 years, overall survival was 97%, with no significant differences in survival among stock types. The 1.5+1.5 stock with a mean height of 234 cm was significantly taller by 18% to 25% than the other stock types. The 1.5+1.5 stock also had significantly greater dbh than the other stock types by 30–43%. The best stock type was 57 cm taller and 1 cm greater in dbh than the poorest. Lifting date had no significant effect on growth or survival.

High elevation sites in British Columbia&#x27;s southern mountains are characterized by a short growing season, low air and soil temperatures, severe winters, and deep snow. The survival and growth of Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir outplanted in 3 silvicultural trials on such sites in gaps of various sizes were compared by Lajzerowicz et al. (2006). Survival after 5 or 6 years decreased with smaller gaps. Height and diameter also decreased with decreasing size of gap; mean heights were 50 cm to 78 cm after 6 years, in line with height expectations for Engelmann spruce in a high-elevation planting study in southeastern British Columbia. In the larger gaps (≥1.0 ha), height increment by year 6 was ranging from 10 cm to 20 cm. Lajzerrowicz et al. Concluded that plantings of conifers in clearcuts at high elevations in the southern mountains of British Columbia are likely to be successful, even close to timberline; and group selection silvicultural systems based on gaps 0.1 ha or larger are also likely to succeed. Gaps smaller than 0.1 ha do not provide suitable conditions for obtaining adequate survival or for growth of outplanted conifers.

===Planting stock===

Planting stock, &quot;seedlings, transplants, cuttings, and occasionally wildings, for use in planting out,&quot; is nursery stock that has been made ready for outplanting. The amount of seed used in white spruce seedling production and direct seeding varies with method.

A working definition of planting stock quality was accepted at the 1979 IUFRO &quot;Workshop on Techniques for Evaluating Planting Stock Quality&quot; in New Zealand: &quot;The quality of planting stock is the degree to which that stock realizes the objectives of management (to the end of the rotation or achievement of specified sought benefits) at minimum cost. Quality is fitness for purpose.&quot; Clear expression of objectives is therefore prerequisite to any determination of planting stock quality. Not only does performance have to be determined, but performance has to be rated against the objectives of management. Planting stock is produced in order to give effect to the forest policy of the organization.

A distinction needs to be made between &quot;planting stock quality&quot; and &quot;planting stock performance potential&quot; (PSPP). The actual performance of any given batch of outplanted planting stock is determined only in part by the kind and condition, i.e., the intrinsic PSPP, of the planting stock.

The PSPP is impossible to estimate reliably by eye because outward appearance, especially of stock withdrawn from refrigerated storage, can deceive even experienced foresters, who would be offended if their ability were questioned to recognize good planting stock when they saw it. Prior to Wakeley&#x27;s (1954) demonstration of the importance of the physiological state of planting stock in determining the ability of the stock to perform after outplanting, and to a considerable extent even afterwards, morphological appearance has generally served as the basis for estimating the quality of planting stock. Gradually, however, a realization developed that more was involved. Tucker et al. (1968), for instance, after assessing 10-year survival data from several experimental white spruce plantations in Manitoba noted that &quot;Perhaps the most important point revealed here is that certain lots of transplants performed better than others&quot;, even though all transplants were handled and planted with care. The intuitive &quot;stock that looks good must be good&quot; is a persuasive, but potentially dangerous maxim. That greatest of teachers, Bitter Experience, has often enough demonstrated the fallibility of such assessment, even though the corollary &quot;stock that looks bad must be bad&quot; is likely to be well founded. The physiological qualities of planting stock are hidden from the eye and must be revealed by testing. The potential for survival and growth of a batch of planting stock may be estimated from various features, morphological and physiological, of the stock or a sample thereof.

The size and shape and general appearance of a seedling can nevertheless give useful indications of PSPP. In low-stress outplanting situations, and with a minimized handling and lifting-planting cycle, a system based on specification for nursery stock and minimum morphological standards for acceptable seedlings works tolerably well. In certain circumstances, benefits often accrue from the use of large planting stock of highly ranked morphological grades. Length of leading shoot, diameter of stem, volume of root system, shoot:root ratios, and height:diameter ratios have been correlated with performance under specific site and planting conditions. However, the concept that larger is better negates the underlying complexities. Schmidt-Vogt (1980), for instance, found that whereas mortality among large outplants is greater than among small in the year of planting, mortality in subsequent growing seasons is higher among small outplants than among large. Much of the literature on comparative seedling performance is clouded by uncertainty as to whether the stocks being compared share the same physiological condition; differences invalidate such comparisons.

Height and root-collar diameter are generally accepted as the most useful morphological criteria and are often the only ones used in specifying standards. Quantification of root system morphology is difficult but can be done, e.g. by using the photometric rhizometer to determine intercept area, or volume by displacement or gravimetric methods.

Planting stock is always subject to a variety of conditions that are never optimal &quot;in toto&quot;. The effect of sub-optimal conditions is to induce stress in the plants. The nursery manager aims, and is normally able to avoid stresses greater than moderate, i.e., restricting stresses to levels that can be tolerated by the plants without incurring serious damage. The adoption of nursery regimes to equip planting stock with characteristics conferring increased ability to withstand outplanting stresses, by managing stress levels in the nursery to &quot;condition&quot; planting stock to increase tolerance to various post-planting environmental stresses, has become widespread, particularly with containerized stock.

Outplanted stock that is unable to tolerate high temperatures occurring at soil surfaces will fail to establish on many forest sites, even in the far north. Factors affecting heat tolerance were investigated by Colombo et al. (1995); the production and roles of heat shock proteins (HSPs) are important in this regard. HSPs, present constitutively in black spruce and many other, perhaps most, higher plants are important both for normal cell functioning and in a stress response mechanism following exposure to high, non-lethal temperature. In black spruce at least, there is an association between HSPs and increased levels of heat tolerance. Investigation of the diurnal variability in heat tolerance of roots and shoots in black spruce seedlings 14 to 16 weeks old found in all 4 trials that shoot heat tolerance was significantly greater in the afternoon than in the morning. The trend in root heat tolerance was similar to that found in the shoots; root systems exposed to 47 °C for 15 minutes in the afternoon averaged 75 new roots after a 2-week growth period, whereas only 28 new roots developed in root systems similarly exposed in the morning. HSP73 was detected in black spruce nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal, and soluble protein fractions, while HSP72 was observed only in the soluble protein fraction. Seedlings exhibited constitutive synthesis of HSP73 at 26 °C in all except the nuclear membrane fraction in the morning; HSP levels at 26 °C in the afternoon were higher than in the morning in the mitochondrial and microsomal protein factions. Heat shock affected the abundance of HSPs depending on protein fraction and time of day. Without heat shock, nuclear membrane-bound HSP73 was absent from plants in the morning and only weakly present in the afternoon, and heat shock increased the abundance of nuclear membrane. Heat shock also affected the abundance of HSP73 in the afternoon, and caused HSP73 to appear in the morning. In the mitochondrial and microsomal protein fractions, an afternoon heat shock reduced HSP73, whereas a morning heat shock increased HSP73 in the mitochondrial but decreased it in the microsomal fraction. Heat shock increased soluble HSP72/73 levels in both the morning and afternoon. In all instances, shoot and root heat tolerances were significantly greater in the afternoon than in the morning.

Planting stock continues to respire during storage even if frozen. Temperature is the major factor controlling the rate, and care must be taken to avoid overheating. Navratil (1982) found that closed containers in cold storage averaged internal temperatures 1.5 °C to 2.0 °C above the nominal storage temperature. Depletion of reserves can be estimated from the decrease in dry weight. Cold-stored 3+0 white spruce nursery stock in northern Ontario had lost 9% to 16% of dry weight after 40 days of storage. Carbohydrates can also be determined directly.

The propensity of a root system to develop new roots or extend existing roots cannot be determined by eye, yet it is the factor that makes or breaks the outcome of an outplanting operation. The post-planting development of roots or root systems of coniferous planting stock is determined by many factors, some physiological, some environmental. Unsatisfactory rates of post-planting survival unrelated to the morphology of the stock, led to attempts to test the physiological condition of planting stock, particularly to quantify the propensity to produce new root growth. New root growth can be assumed to be necessary for successful establishment of stock after planting, but although the thesis that RGC is positively related to field performance would seem to be reasonable, supporting evidence has been meager.

The physiological condition of seedlings is reflected by changes in root activity. This is helpful in determining the readiness of stock for lifting and storing and also for outplanting after storage. Navratil (1982) reported a virtually perfect (R² = 0.99) linear relationship in the frequency of 3+0 white spruce white root tips longer than 10 mm with time in the fall at Pine Ridge Forest Nursery, Alberta, decreasing during a 3-week period to zero on October 13 in 1982.Root regenerating research with white spruce in Canada (Hambly 1973, Day and MacGillivray 1975, Day and Breunig 1997) followed similar lines to that of Stone&#x27;s (1955) pioneering work in California.

Simpson and Ritchie (1997) debated the proposition that root growth potential of planting stock predicts field performance; their conclusion was that root growth potential, as a surrogate for seedling vigor, can predict field performance, but only under such situations as site conditions permit. Survival after planting is only partly a function of an outplant&#x27;s ability to initiate roots in test conditions; root growth capacity is not the sole predictor of plantation performance.

Some major problems militate against greater use of RGC in forestry, including: unstandardized techniques; unstandardized quantification; uncertain correlation between quantified RGC and field performance; variability within given, nominally identical, kinds of planting stock; and the irrelevance of RGC test values determined on a sub-sample of a parent population that subsequently, before it is planted, undergoes any substantive physiological or physical change. In its present form, RGC testing is silviculturally useful chiefly as a means of detecting planting stock that, while visually unimpaired, is moribund.

Seedling moisture content can be increased or decreased in storage, depending on various factors including especially the type of container and the kind and amount of moisture-retaining material present. When seedlings exceed 20 bars PMS in storage, survival after outplanting becomes problematical. The Relative Moisture Content of stock lifted during dry conditions can be increased gradually when stored in appropriate conditions. White spruce (3+0) packed in Kraft bags in northern Ontario increased RMC by 20% to 36% within 40 days.

Bareroot 1.5+1.5 white spruce were taken from cold storage and planted early in May on a clear-felled boreal forest site in northeastern Ontario. Similar plants were potted and kept in a greenhouse. In outplanted trees, maximum stomatal conductances (g) were initially low (&lt;0.01 cm/s), and initial base xylem pressure potentials (PSIb) were -2.0 MPa. During the growing season, g increased to about 0.20 cm/s and PSIb to -1.0 MPa. Minimum xylem pressure potential (PSIm) was initially -2.5 MPa, increasing to -2.0 MPa on day 40, and about -1.6 MPa by day 110. During the first half of the growing season, PSIm was below turgor loss point. The osmotic potential at turgor loss point decreased after planting to -2.3 MPa 28 days later. In the greenhouse, minimum values of PSIT were -2.5 MPa (in the first day after planting. the maximum bulk modulus of elasticity was greater in white spruce than in similarly treated jack pine and showed greater seasonal changes. Relative water content (RWC) at turgor loss was 80–87%. Available turgor (TA), defined as the integral of turgor over the range of RWC between PSIb and xylem pressure potential at the turgor loss point) was 4.0% for white spruce at the beginning of the season compared with 7.9% for jack pine, but for the rest of the season TA for jack pine was only 2%, to 3% that of white spruce. Diurnal turgor (Td), the integral of turgor over the range of RWC between PSIb and PSIm, as a percentage of TA was higher in field-planted white spruce than jack pine until the end of the season.

The stomata of both white and black spruce were more sensitive to atmospheric evaporative demands and plant moisture stress during the first growing season after outplanting on 2 boreal sites in northern Ontario than were jack pine stomata, physiological differences that favoured growth and establishment being more in jack pine than in the spruces.

With black spruce and jack pine, but not with white spruce, Grossnickle and Blake&#x27;s (1987) findings warrant mention in relation to the bareroot-containerized debate. During the first growing season after outplanting, containerized seedlings of both species had greater needle conductance than bareroot seedlings over a range of absolute humidity deficits. Needle conductance of containerized seedlings of both species remained high during periods of high absolute humidity deficits and increasing plant moisture stress. Bareroot outplants of both species had a greater early season resistance to water-flow through the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC) than had containerized outplants. Resistance to water flow through the SPAC decreased in bareroot stock of both species as the season progressed, and was comparable to containerized seedlings 9 to 14 weeks after planting. Bareroot black spruce had greater new-root development than containerized stock throughout the growing season.

The greater efficiency of water use in newly transplanted 3-year-old white spruce seedlings under low levels of absolute humidity difference in water-stressed plants immediately after planting helps explain the commonly observed favourable response of young outplants to the nursing effect of a partial canopy. Silvicultural treatments promoting higher humidity levels at the planting microsite should improve white spruce seedling photosynthesis immediately after planting.

===Stock types (Seedling nomenclature)===

Planting stock is grown under many diverse nursery culture regimes, in facilities ranging from sophisticated computerized greenhouses to open compounds. Types of stock include bareroot seedlings and transplants, and various kinds of containerized stock. For simplicity, both container-grown and bareroot stock are generally referred to as seedlings, and transplants are nursery stock that have been lifted and transplanted into another nursery bed, usually at wider spacing. The size and physiological character of stock vary with the length of growing period and with growing conditions. Until the technology of raising containerized nursery stock bourgeoned in the second half of the twentieth- century, bareroot planting stock classified by its age in years was the norm.

===Classification by age===

The number of years spent in the nursery seedbed by any particular lot of planting stock is indicated by the 1st of a series of numbers. The 2nd number indicates the years subsequently spent in the transplant line, and a zero is shown if indeed there has been no transplanting. A 3rd number, if any, would indicate the years subsequently spent after a second lifting and transplanting. The numbers are sometimes separated by dashes, but separation by plus sign is more logical inasmuch as the sum of the individual numbers gives the age of the planting stock. Thus 2+0 is 2-year-old seedling planting stock that has not been transplanted, and Candy&#x27;s (1929) white spruce 2+2+3 stock had spent 2 years in the seedbed, 2 years in transplant lines, and another 3 years in transplant lines after a second transplanting. Variations have included such self-explanatory combinations, such as 1½+1½, etc.

The class of planting stock to use on a particular site is generally selected on the basis of historical record of survival, growth, and total cost of surviving trees. In the Lake States, Kittredge concluded that good stock of 2+1 white spruce was the smallest size likely to succeed and was better than larger and more expensive stock when judged by final cost of surviving trees.

===Classification by seedling description code===

Because age alone is an inadequate descriptor of planting stock, various codes have been developed to describe such components of stock characteristics as height, stem diameter, and shoot:root ratio. A description code may include an indication of the intended planting season.

===Physiological characteristics===

Neither age classification nor seedling description code indicate the physiological condition of planting stock, though rigid adherence to a given cultural regime together with observation of performance over a number of years of planting can produce stock suitable for performing on a &quot;same again&quot; basis.

=== Classification by Production System ===
Nursery plant material is sold using a variety of systems. The most common systems for woody plants are bare root, containers, and ball &amp; burlap. There are manuals specifically for the production of bare root and containerized crops In North America, the American Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z.60.1) and the Canadian nursery stock standard set specifications that determine what category of size a nursery plant material belongs. The categories relate to size of the plant, plant calliper and` height ratio, and the size of the root ball.

If plant stock is grown in a pot of any size or material, it is considered container grown plant stock. the benefits of using the system of container grown plant stock include the convenience of being able to maintain and transport the plant stock. However, container grown plant stock will develop poor root structure when the roots hit the side of the container and begin to circle. When the roots circle the pot, the plant is considered root bound. Container grown plant stock may be grown to size in the field and transplanted into a container, or grown in a container until marketable size if grown in container rather than a field, continual upsizing of pots will be important for preventing the plant becoming root bound. Some ways to prevent a crop from becoming root bound is by using air-pruning containers, which have spaces around the pot that expose growing media and roots to air. The air will stop the root tip from growing and circling the pot. Nurseries will also mechanically prune roots with &quot;U&quot; shaped or linear blades that are connected to tractors. Container production can be used for any plant species.

If a nursery plant is sold as &quot;bare root&quot;, it means that soil has been removed from the roots, the product being sold is just the plant. Plants sold as bare root are marketed in the winter, to sell to customers in spring. Plants sold as bare root include herbaceous and woody perennial plants. Bare root plants are grown in the field during the growing season until they become a harvestable bare root crop. During dormancy, bare root plants are dug up, bundled, stored in a cool warehouse with roots in a moist media, they will be sold, transplanted back into the field in spring, or disposed of if there is not enough space in the field. The issue of being root bound is non existent for bare root plants because there is no container for the roots to circle around, bare root nursery stock has the standard of being free of root deformities, and being free of pests.

If a plant is ball and burlapped, it means the nursery dug around the plant with its soil while it&#x27;s in the field and wrapped it in burlap which they tie down with rope. Nurseries may also use wire baskets to support the ball and burlap trees if needed. Ball and burlap trees loose close to 90% of their root systems when dug The size of the root ball of a ball and burlap tree depends on the calliper of the tree, and the species of the tree. Root balls must have the depth to keep most of the plant root system and also be deep enough to keep plant root ball intact while the plant is being moved or planted.

There are terms used to identify the stage that the nursery plants are at. Liners are young plants that are one or two years old. They may be sold as bare root or in containers. A whip is a tree with just a trunk and little to no branches. Whips can be grown from hardwood cuttings, seedlings, or propagated by budding, which is a method of grafting propagation where a single bud of a desired cultivar is grafted onto a rootstock plant. In the case of budding, the rootstock will be older than the crown.

<doc id="435079" wikidata="Q935716" url="?curid=435079" title="Lenition">
<text>In linguistics, lenition is a sound change that alters consonants, making them &quot;weaker&quot; in some way. The word &quot;lenition&quot; itself means &quot;softening&quot; or &quot;weakening&quot; (from Latin &#x27;weak&#x27;). Lenition can happen both synchronically (within a language at a particular point in time) and diachronically (as a language changes over time). Lenition can involve such changes as voicing a voiceless consonant, causing a consonant to relax occlusion, to lose its place of articulation (a phenomenon called &quot;debuccalization&quot;, which turns a consonant into a glottal consonant like or ), or even causing a consonant to disappear entirely.

An example of synchronic lenition is found in most varieties of American English, in the form of tapping: the of a word like &quot;wait&quot; is pronounced as the more sonorous in the related form &quot;waiting&quot; . Some varieties of Spanish show debuccalization of to at the end of a syllable, so that a word like &quot;we are&quot; is pronounced . An example of diachronic lenition can be found in the Romance languages, where the of Latin (&quot;father&quot;, accusative) has become in Italian (an irregular change; compare &quot;silk&quot; &gt; ) and Spanish (the latter weakened synchronically → ), while in Catalan , French and Portuguese historical has disappeared completely.

In some languages, lenition has been grammaticalized into a consonant mutation, which means it is no longer triggered by its phonological environment but is now governed by its syntactic or morphological environment. For example, in Welsh, the word &quot;cat&quot; begins with the sound , but after the definite article , the changes to : &quot;the cat&quot; in Welsh is . This was historically due to intervocalic lenition, but in the plural, lenition does not happen, so &quot;the cats&quot; is , not *. The change of to in is thus caused by the syntax of the phrase, not by the modern phonological position of the consonant .

The opposite of lenition, fortition, a sound change that makes a consonant &quot;stronger&quot;, is less common, but Breton and Cornish have &quot;hard mutation&quot; forms which represent fortition.

==Types==
Lenition involves changes in manner of articulation, sometimes accompanied by small changes in place of articulation. There are two main lenition pathways: opening and sonorization. In both cases, a stronger sound becomes a weaker one. Lenition can be seen as a movement on the sonority hierarchy from less sonorous to more sonorous, or on a strength hierarchy from stronger to weaker.

In examples below, a greater-than sign indicates that one sound changes to another. The notation &gt; means that changes to .

The sound change of palatalization sometimes involves lenition.

Lenition includes the loss of a feature, such as deglottalization, in which glottalization or ejective articulation is lost: or &gt; .

The tables below show common sound changes involved in lenition. In some cases, lenition may skip one of the sound changes. The change voiceless stop &gt; fricative is more common than the series of changes voiceless stop &gt; affricate &gt; fricative.

===Opening===
In the opening type of lenition, the articulation becomes more open with each step. Opening lenition involves several sound changes: shortening of double consonants, affrication of stops, spirantization or assibilation of stops or affricates, debuccalization, and finally elision.
* or &gt; (shortening, example in Greek)
* &gt; (affrication, for example to )
* or &gt; (spirantization, example in Gilbertese language)
* &gt; ; &gt; (debuccalization, example in English or Spanish)
* , , , , &gt; ∅ (elision)

===Sonorization===
The sonorization type involves voicing. Sonorizing lenition involves several sound changes: voicing, approximation, and vocalization.
* &gt; (voicing, example in Korean)
* &gt; (approximation, example in Spanish)
* &gt; (vocalization)

Sonorizing lenition occurs especially often intervocalically (between vowels). In this position, lenition can be seen as a type of assimilation of the consonant to the surrounding vowels, in which features of the consonant that are not present in the surrounding vowels (e.g. obstruction, voicelessness) are gradually eliminated.

Some of the sounds generated by lenition are often subsequently &quot;normalized&quot; into related but cross-linguistically more common sounds. An example would be the changes → → and → → . Such normalizations correspond to diagonal movements down and to the right in the above table. In other cases, sounds are lenited and normalized at the same time; examples would be direct changes → or → .

====Vocalization====
&quot;L&quot;-vocalization is a subtype of the sonorization type of lenition. It has two possible results: a velar approximant or back vowel, or a palatal approximant or front vowel. In French, &quot;l&quot;-vocalization of the sequence resulted in the diphthong , which was monophthongized, yielding the monophthong in Modern French.

===Mixed===
Sometimes a particular example of lenition mixes the opening and sonorization pathways. For example, may spirantize or open to , then voice or sonorize to .

Lenition can be seen in Canadian and American English, where and soften to a tap (flapping) when not in initial position and followed by an unstressed vowel. For example, both &quot;rate&quot; and &quot;raid&quot; plus the suffix &quot;-er&quot; are pronounced . The Italian of Central and Southern Italy has a number of lenitions, the most widespread of which is the deaffrication of to between vowels: post-pausal &#x27;dinner&#x27; but post-vocalic &#x27;the dinner&#x27;; the name , although structurally , is normally pronounced . In Tuscany, likewise is realized between vowels, and in typical speech of Central Tuscany, the voiceless stops in the same position are pronounced respectively , as in → &#x27;the house&#x27;, → &#x27;hole&#x27;.

==Effects==
===Diachronic===
Diachronic lenition is found, for example, in the change from Latin into Spanish, in which the voiceless stops first changed into their voiced counterparts , and later into the approximants or fricatives : &gt; , &gt; , &gt; , &gt; . One stage in these changes goes beyond phonetic to have become a phonological restructuring, e.g. &gt; (compare in Italian, with no change in the phonological status of ). The subsequent further weakening of the series to phonetic , as in is diachronic in the sense that the developments took place over time and displaced as the normal pronunciations between vowels. It is also synchronic in an analysis of as allophonic realizations of : illustrating with , &#x27;wine&#x27; is pronounced after pause, but with intervocalically, as in &#x27;of wine&#x27;; likewise, → .

A similar development occurred in the Celtic languages, where non-geminate intervocalic consonants were converted into their corresponding weaker counterparts through lenition (usually stops into fricatives but also laterals and trills into weaker laterals and taps), and voiceless stops became voiced. For example, Indo-European intervocalic * in &quot;*&quot; &quot;people&quot; resulted in Proto-Celtic , Primitive Irish &quot;*&quot;, Old Irish and ultimately debuccalisation in most Irish and some Scottish dialects to , shift in Central Southern Irish to , and complete deletion in some Modern Irish and most Modern Scots Gaelic dialects, thus .

An example of historical lenition in the Germanic languages is evidenced by Latin-English cognates such as , , vs. &quot;father&quot;, &quot;thin&quot;, &quot;horn&quot;. The Latin words preserved the original stops, which became fricatives in old Germanic by Grimm&#x27;s law. A few centuries later, the High German consonant shift led to a second series of lenitions in Old High German, chiefly of post-vocalic stops, as evidenced in the English-German cognates &quot;ripe&quot;, &quot;water&quot;, &quot;make&quot; vs. , , .

Although actually a much more profound change encompassing syllable restructuring, simplification of geminate consonants as in the passage from Latin to Spanish such as cuppa &gt; &#x27;cup&#x27; is often viewed as a type of lenition (compare geminate-preserving Italian ).

===Synchronic===

====Allophonic====
All varieties of Sardinian, with the sole exception of Nuorese, offer an example of sandhi in which the rule of intervocalic lenition applying to the voiced series /b d g/ extends across word boundaries. Since it is a fully active synchronic rule, lenition is not normally indicated in the standard orthographies.

A series of synchronic lenitions involving opening, or loss of occlusion, rather than voicing is found for post-vocalic in many Tuscan dialects of Central Italy. Stereotypical Florentine, for example, has the of as &#x27;house&#x27; in a post-pause realization, &#x27;in (the) house&#x27; post-consonant, but &#x27;the house&#x27; intervocalically. Word-internally, the normal realization is also : &#x27;hole&#x27; → .

====Grammatical====
In the Celtic languages, the phenomenon of intervocalic lenition historically extended across word boundaries. This explains the rise of grammaticalised initial consonant mutations in modern Celtic languages through the loss of endings. A Scottish Gaelic example would be the lack of lenition in (&quot;the man&quot;) and lenition in (&quot;the woman&quot;). The following examples show the development of a phrase consisting of a definite article plus a masculine noun (taking the ending ) compared with a feminine noun taking the ending . The historic development of lenition in those two cases can be reconstructed as follows:

:Proto-Celtic IPA: → Old Irish → Middle Irish → Classical Gaelic → Modern Gaelic 

:Proto-Celtic IPA: → Old Irish → Middle Irish → Classical Gaelic → Modern Gaelic 

Synchronic lenition in Scottish Gaelic affects almost all consonants (except , which has lost its lenited counterpart in most areas). Changes such as to involve the loss of secondary articulation; in addition, → involves the reduction of a trill to a tap. The spirantization of Gaelic nasal to is unusual among forms of lenition, but it is triggered by the same environment as more prototypical lenition. (It may also leave a residue of nasalization in adjacent vowels.) The orthography shows that by inserting an (except after ).

=== Blocked lenition ===
Some languages which have lenition have in addition complex rules affecting situations where lenition might be expected to occur but does not, often those involving homorganic consonants. This is colloquially known as &#x27;blocked lenition&#x27;, or more technically as &#x27;homorganic inhibition&#x27; or &#x27;homorganic blocking&#x27;. In Scottish Gaelic, for example, there are three homorganic groups:
* d n t l s (usually called the dental group in spite of the non-dental nature of the palatals)
* c g (usually called the velar group)
* b f m p (usually called the labial group)
In a position where lenition is expected due to the grammatical environment, lenition tends to be blocked if there are two adjacent homorganic consonants across the word boundary. For example:
* &#x27;one&#x27; (which causes lenition) → &#x27;one leg&#x27; vs &#x27;one house&#x27; (not )
* &#x27;on the&#x27; (which causes lenition) → &#x27;on the big leg&#x27; vs &quot;on the brown house&quot; (not )
In modern Scottish Gaelic this rule is only productive in the case of dentals but not the other two groups for the vast majority of speakers. It also does not affect all environments any more. For example, while still invokes the rules of blocked lenition, a noun followed by an adjective generally no longer does so. Hence:
* &quot;hat&quot; (a feminine noun causing lenition) → &quot;a brown hat&quot; (although some highly conservative speakers retain )
* &quot;girl&quot; (a feminine noun causing lenition) → &quot;a smart girl&quot; (not )
There is a significant number of frozen forms involving the other two groups (labials and velars) and environments as well, especially in surnames and place names:
* &#x27;Montgomery&#x27; ( + ) vs &#x27;MacDonald ( + )
* &#x27;Campbell&#x27; ( &#x27;crooked&#x27; + &#x27;mouth&#x27;) vs &#x27;Cameron&#x27; ( + &#x27;nose&#x27;)
* &#x27;Sgian-dubh&#x27; ( &#x27;knife&#x27; + &#x27;1 black 2 hidden&#x27;; as a feminine noun today would normally cause lenition on a following adjective) vs &quot;a black knife&quot; (i.e., a common knife which just happens to be black)
Though rare, in some instances the rules of blocked lenition can be invoked by lost historical consonants, for example, in the case of the past-tense copula , which in Common Celtic had a final -t. In terms of blocked lenition, it continues to behave as a dental-final particle invoking blocked lenition rules:
* &quot;bad was the food&quot; versus &#x27;great was the pity

In Brythonic languages, only fossilized vestiges of lenition blocking occur, for example in Welsh &#x27;good night&#x27; lenition is blocked ( as a feminine noun normally causes lenition of a following modifier, for example &#x27;Friday&#x27; yields &#x27;Friday night&#x27;). Within Celtic, blocked lenition phenomena also occur in Irish (for example &#x27;one door&#x27;, &#x27;the first person&#x27;) and Manx (for example &#x27;one door&#x27;, &#x27;the first man&#x27;) however.

Outside Celtic, in Spanish orthographic b d g are retained as following nasals rather than their normal lenited forms .

==Orthography==

In the modern Celtic languages, lenition of the &quot;fricating&quot; type is usually denoted by adding an &quot;h&quot; to the lenited letter. In Welsh, for example, , , and change into , , as a result of the so-called &quot;aspirate mutation&quot; (, &quot;stone&quot; → &quot;her stone&quot;). An exception is Manx orthography, which tends to be more phonetic, but in some cases, etymological principles are applied. In the Gaelic script, fricating lenition (usually called simply &quot;lenition&quot;) is indicated by a dot above the affected consonant, and in the Roman script, the convention is to suffix the letter to the consonant, to signify that it is lenited. Thus, is equivalent to . In Middle Irish manuscripts, lenition of and was indicated by the dot above, and lenition of , , and was indicated by the postposed ; lenition of other letters was not indicated consistently in the orthography.

Voicing lenition is represented by a simple letter switch in the Brythonic languages, for instance , &quot;stone&quot; → , &quot;the stone&quot; in Welsh. In Irish orthography, it is shown by writing the &quot;weak&quot; consonant alongside the (silent) &quot;strong&quot; one: , &quot;pen&quot; → &quot;our pen&quot;, , &quot;head&quot; → &quot;our head&quot; (sonorization is traditionally called &quot;eclipsis&quot; in Irish grammar).

Although nasalization as a feature also occurs in most Scottish Gaelic dialects, it is not shown in the orthography on the whole, as it is synchronic (the result of certain types of nasals affecting a following sound), rather than the diachronic Irish type sonorization (after historic nasals). For example &quot;house&quot; → &quot;the house&quot;.

==Consonant gradation==

The phenomenon of consonant gradation in Finnic languages is also a form of lenition.

An example with geminate consonants comes from Finnish, where geminates become simple consonants while retaining voicing or voicelessness (e.g. → , → ). It is also possible for entire consonant clusters to undergo lenition, as in Votic, where voiceless clusters become voiced, e.g. &quot;to cry&quot; → .

If a language has no obstruents other than voiceless stops, other sounds are encountered, as in Finnish, where the lenited grade is represented by chronemes, approximants, taps or even trills. For example, Finnish used to have a complete set of spirantization reflexes for , though these have been lost in favour of similar-sounding phonemes. In the Southern Ostrobothnian, Tavastian and southwestern dialects of Finnish, mostly changed into , thus the dialects have a synchronic lenition of an alveolar stop into an alveolar trill . Furthermore, the same phoneme undergoes assibilation → before the vowel , e.g. root &quot;water&quot; → and . Here, is the stem, is its nominative, and is the same stem under consonant gradation.

==Fortition==

Fortition is the opposite of lenition: a consonant mutation in which a consonant changes from one considered weak to one considered strong. Fortition is less frequent than lenition in the languages of the world, but word-initial and word-final fortition is fairly frequent.

Italian, for example, presents numerous regular examples of word-initial fortition both historically (Lat. with initial &gt; , with ) and synchronically (e.g., &quot;house, home&quot; → but &quot;at home&quot; → ).

Catalan is among numerous Romance languages with diachronic word-final devoicing ( &gt; &gt; . Fortition also occurs in Catalan for in consonant clusters with a lateral consonant (Lat. &gt; or .

Word-medially, is subject to fortition in numerous Romance languages, ranging from or in many speech types on Italian soil to in some varieties of Spanish.

<doc id="435080" wikidata="Q2932733" url="?curid=435080" title="Verb framing">
<text>In linguistics, verb-framing and satellite-framing are typological descriptions of a way that verb phrases in a language can describe the &quot;path&quot; of motion or the &quot;manner&quot; of motion, respectively. Some languages make this distinction and others do not.

== Manner and path ==
The &quot;manner&quot; of motion refers to a type of distinct motion described by a particular verb, such as running, tumbling, sliding, walking, crawling, etc. The &quot;path&quot; of motion refers to the direction of the movement, such as movement into, out of, across, etc. The two concepts can be encoded in the verb as part of its root meaning, or encoded in a separate particle associated with the verb (a &quot;satellite&quot;). Manner or path may also not be expressed at all.

Languages are considered &quot;verb-framed&quot; or &quot;satellite-framed&quot; based on how the motion path is typically encoded. English verbs use particles to show the path of motion (&quot;run into&quot;, &quot;go out&quot;, &quot;fall down&quot;), and its verbs usually show manner of motion; thus, English is a satellite-framed language. English verbs that are exceptions are mostly derived from Latin, such as &quot;exit&quot;, &quot;ascend&quot;, or &quot;enter&quot;.

All Germanic languages are satellite-framed languages. Accordingly, &quot;to go out&quot; is &quot;hinausgehen&quot; in German, &quot;uitgaan&quot; in Dutch and &quot;gå ut&quot; in Swedish, wherein &quot;gehen&quot; / &quot;gaan&quot; / &quot;gå&quot; are equivalents of &quot;to go&quot;, and &quot;hinaus&quot; / &quot;uit&quot; / &quot;ut&quot; are equivalents of &quot;out&quot;. In this manner, Germanic languages can form all kinds of compounds, even less manifest ones like (German) &quot;hinaustanzen&quot; &quot;to dance out&quot; and so on.

On the other hand, all Romance languages are verb-framed. Spanish, for example, makes heavy use of verbs of motion like &quot;entrar&quot;, &quot;salir&quot;, &quot;subir&quot;, &quot;bajar&quot; (&quot;go in&quot;, &quot;go out&quot;, &quot;go up&quot;, &quot;go down&quot;), which directly encode motion path, and may leave out the manner of motion or express it in a complement of manner (typically a participle): &quot;entró corriendo&quot; &quot;he ran in&quot;, literally &quot;he entered running&quot;; &quot;salió flotando&quot; &quot;it floated out&quot;, literally &quot;it exited floating&quot;. 

The terms verb framing and satellite framing are not restricted to Romance and Germanic languages, respectively. Many languages can be assigned to one of the two systems. For example, verb framing is used in Turkish, Hebrew and Arabic. (In the last, &quot;dakhala rākiḍan&quot; means &quot;he entered running&quot;, with the perfect form &quot;dakhala&quot; meaning &quot;he entered&quot; and the participle &quot;rākiḍan&quot; meaning &quot;running&quot;.) Satellite framing is common in Greek. Some languages use both strategies. For example, Persian is chiefly verb-framed, but also has such compounds as &quot;dar-āmadan&quot; (, &quot;to come in&quot;) from &quot;dar&quot; (&quot;in&quot;) and &quot;āmadan&quot; (&quot;to come&quot;).

==Examples from English and French==

Romance languages, such as French, are normally verb-framed, and Germanic languages, such as English, are satellite-framed. This means that when expressing motion events, English speakers typically express manner in the verb, and French speakers (like Italian, Portuguese and Spanish speakers) typically express path in the verb, and either leave out the manner of motion completely or express it in a complement of manner. Thus for example, &quot;He ran into the room&quot; is routinely translated as &quot;Il est entré dans la pièce&quot;; only sometimes will it be &quot;Il est entré dans la pièce en courant&quot; (&quot;he entered the room running&quot;). This means, first, that the verb itself normally does not express manner in French, as opposed to what is generally the case in English; and if manner is expressed, it is expressed in a complement (or, more precisely, an adjunct) of manner: &quot;en courant&quot; (&quot;running&quot;).

The question, then, remains of whether to express manner or not. It is not always easy to know, but manner is generally left unexpressed when it can be considered to be self-evident and can be inferred from the context; expressing the manner then tends to sound unnatural. Thus, &quot;He ran into the room&quot; can be translated as &quot;Il est entré dans la pièce en courant&quot; because it is slightly unusual to run into a room and so manner should be mentioned, but translating &quot;He walked into the room&quot; as &quot;Il est entré dans la pièce à pied&quot; (&quot;on foot&quot;) or &quot;en marchant&quot; (&quot;walking&quot;) is distinctly odd because it calls unintended attention to the usual way in which one enters a room. It is akin to saying in English &quot;he entered the room walking&quot;. Only in a case where walking would be considered unusual or notable – for example, when talking about a crippled person – can the fact that he &quot;walked&quot; into the room be considered to be relevant. Likewise, saying &quot;I&#x27;m flying to London&quot; when on a plane is normal in English, but saying &quot;Je vole&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m flying&quot;) in French for the same situation is odd: first, because the verb is not where one should normally express manner in the first place, and also because flying is a common way of travelling to London from France.

This means that the choice of complement and in particular the choice of the preposition can also be affected: in English, the &quot;particle&quot; or the &quot;prepositional phrase&quot; (the &quot;satellite&quot;) is where the path is expressed, with the use of a dynamic preposition: &quot;(walk) into (the room)&quot;, &quot;(fly) to (London)&quot;, whereas in French, it is the &quot;verb&quot; that normally expresses the path. A preposition like &quot;à&quot; (&quot;to, at, in&quot;) is ambiguous between a static reading (&quot;Je suis à Paris&quot;/&quot;I&#x27;m in Paris&quot;) and a dynamic reading (&quot;Je vais à Paris&quot;/&quot;I&#x27;m going to Paris&quot;). If the verb is dynamic and expresses directed motion (motion with an intrinsic direction), &quot;à&quot; can express movement (&quot;Je vais à Paris&quot;). If not, as is the case for instance with &quot;voler&quot; (&quot;to fly&quot;), which expresses manner of motion but not directed motion, &quot;à&quot; tends to receive a static and not a dynamic, interpretation: &quot;je vole à Paris&quot; would mean something like &quot;I&#x27;m flying IN Paris&quot;, and not &quot;I&#x27;m flying TO Paris&quot;. Using the same structure in French as directly translated from English can be doubly misleading, as the verb and the preposition are both unusual; &quot;Je vais à&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m going to&quot;) or &quot;Je suis en route&quot; (&quot;I am on my way&quot;) &quot;vers&quot;/&quot;pour Paris&quot; (&quot;towards/for Paris&quot;) are much clearer in meaning.

==Opposition and its limitations==

Although languages can generally be classified as &quot;verb-framed&quot;/&quot;satellite-framed&quot;, this is not a mutually exclusive classification. Languages can use both strategies, as is the case in English with the Latinate verbs such as &quot;enter&quot;, &quot;ascend&quot; and &quot;exit&quot;. The existence of equipollently-framed languages in which &quot;both&quot; manner and path are expressed in verbs has been pointed out (Slobin 2004). It could be true of Chinese, for instance.

Many Amerindian languages, such as the extinct Atsugewi, do not select verbs of motion based on path or manner. Instead, verbs of motion are specific to the &quot;kind&quot; of object that is moving or being moved.

<text>Pharnavaz I (; ) was a king (&quot;mepe&quot;) of Kartli, an ancient Georgian kingdom known as Iberia in classical antiquity. &quot;The Georgian Chronicles&quot; credits him with being the first monarch founding the kingship of Kartli and the Pharnavazid dynasty, while other independent chronicles, such as &quot;The Conversion of Kartli&quot; make him the second Georgian monarch. Based on the medieval evidence, most scholars locate Pharnavaz&#x27;s rule in the 3rd century BC: 302–237 BC according to Prince Vakhushti of Kartli, 299–234 BC according to Cyril Toumanoff and 284–219 BC according to Pavle Ingoroqva. Pharnavaz&#x27;s rise, advent and imperial expansion of the Iberian monarchy was directly tied to the victory of Alexander the Great over the Achaemenid Empire. Pharnavaz ruled under the suzerainty of the Seleucid Empire.

==Life==
According to the &quot;Georgian royal annals&quot;, Pharnavaz descended from Uplos, son of Mtskhetos, son of Kartlos, who was one of the powerful and famous eight brothers, who from their part were descendants of Targamos, son of Tarsi, the grandson of Japheth, son of the Biblical Noah. He is not directly attested in non-Georgian sources and there is no definite contemporary indication that he was indeed the first of the Georgian kings. His story is saturated with legendary imagery and symbols, and it seems feasible that, as the memory of the historical facts faded, the real Pharnavaz &quot;accumulated a legendary façade&quot; and emerged as the model pre-Christian monarch in the Georgian annals.

According to the chronicle &quot;The Life of Kings&quot;, Pharnavaz had a distinguished genealogy, tracing back to Kartlos, the mythical ethnarch of Kartli. His paternal uncle, Samara, held the position of &quot;mamasakhlisi&quot; (&quot;father of the house&quot;) of the Georgian tribes around Mtskheta. Pharnavaz&#x27;s mother is claimed to have been a Persian woman from Gabai, whom Prince Teimuraz of Georgia and Patriarch Anton I of Georgia identify with a daughter of King Darius III. The entire story of Pharnavaz, although written by a Christian chronicler, abounds in ancient Iranian-like imagery and mystic allusions, a reflection of the archaeologically confirmed cultural and presumably political ties between Iran and Kartli of that time. The name &quot;Pharnavaz&quot; is also an illustrative example with its root &quot;par&quot;- being based upon the Persian &quot;farnah&quot;, the divine radiance believed by the ancient Iranians to mark a legitimate dynast (cf. &quot;khvarenah&quot;). The dynastic tag Parnavaziani (&quot;of/from/named for Pharnavaz&quot;) is also preserved in the early Armenian histories as P&#x27;arnawazean (&quot;Faustus of Byzantium&quot; 5.15; fifth century) and P&#x27;arazean (&quot;History of Armenia&quot; 14; probably the early fifth century), an acknowledgment that a king named Pharnavaz was understood to have been the founder of a Georgian dynasty. Pharnavaz is also mentioned in the Stele of Serapit.

Perhaps the most artistically rounded section of the Georgian annals, the narrative follows Pharnavaz&#x27;s life from birth to burial. Aged 3, small Pharnavaz&#x27;s family is destroyed, and his heritage is usurped by Azon installed by Alexander the Great during his campaign in Kartli. Alexander&#x27;s invasion of Iberia, remembered not only by the Georgian historical tradition, but also by Pliny the Elder (4.10.39) and Gaius Julius Solinus (9.19), appears to be memory of some Macedonian interference in Iberia, which must have taken place in connection with the expedition mentioned by Strabo (11.14.9) sent by Alexander in 323 BC to the confines of Iberia, in search of gold mines.

Pharnavaz is brought up fatherless, but a magic dream, in which he anoints himself with the essence of the Sun, heralds the peripeteia. He is persuaded by this vision to &quot;devote [himself] to noble deeds&quot;. He then sets off and goes hunting. In a pursuit of a deer, he encounters a mass of treasure stored in a hidden cave. Pharnavaz retrieves the treasure and exploits it to mount a loyal army against the tyrannical Azon. He is aided by Kuji of Colchis, who eventually marries Pharnavaz&#x27;s sister. The rebels are also joined by 1,000 soldiers from Azon&#x27;s camp; they are anachronistically referred to by the author as Romans, and claimed to have been entitled by the victorious Pharnavaz as &quot;aznauri&quot; (i.e., nobles) after Azon (this etymology is false, however).

The main threads of Pharnavaz&#x27;s story - a fatherless boy hidden and raised in a remote mountains, a forgotten lineage, his dreams, sacral kingship, solar imagery, the hunt, discovery of cave-concealed treasure etc. are reminiscent of legends about Iran&#x27;s founding kings, like Cyrus the Great and Ardashir I. Pharnavaz&#x27;s self-anointment may have been a later Sasanian inspiration, as some early &quot;Shahanshahs&quot; crowned themselves.

==Reign==

In the ensuing battle, Azon is defeated and killed, and Pharnavaz becomes the king of Kartli at the age of 27. He is reported to have acknowledged the suzerainty of the Seleucids, the Hellenistic successors of Alexander in the Middle East, who are afforded by the Georgian chronicles the generic name of Antiochus.

Pharnavaz is also said to have patterned his administration upon an &quot;Iranian&quot; model.

Pharnavaz had introduced a military-administrative organization based on a network of regional governors or &quot;eristavi&quot;. The insignia of the eristavi, received from the king, constituted a sceptre, a special signet ring, belt and armament. Iberia had in total seven eristavis, in Colchis, Kakheti, Khunani (modern-day northern Azerbaijan), Samshvilde (Kvemo Kartli), Tsunda (included Javakheti, Kola and Artaani), Odzrkhe and Klarjeti. The kingdom had one spaspet who was under the direct control of the royal power based in Inner Kartli. Eristavates mimicked aspects of Achaemenid &quot;satrapies&quot; and Seleucid &quot;strategoi&quot;. The major motive of later historian of the chronicles was to convince posterity that the basic political structure of Kartli was created by the very first Georgian monarch in the wake of Wars of Alexander the Great; was of Achaemenid administrative system and had remained stable throughout Hellenistic, Parthian and Sasanian times. In this way, the long-term viability and stability of the Georgian realm are established.

The hierarchic structure created by Pharnavaz was the following: king; commander-in-chief (spaspet) of the royal army; eristavis; middle commanders (&quot;atasistavis tsikhistavis&quot;) of the garrisons stationed in the royal strongholds; junior commanders (&quot;asistavis&quot;) who were the younger sons of the aristocratic families; mercenary professional warriors from the neighboring countries and all the soldiers organized around the entire kingdom.

It is evident that the division of Iberia by Pharnavaz into saeristavos served first and foremost a military aim, namely the organization of people for the purpose of defence. This organization was not so much directed against other countries. Back then the total population of the kingdom would have been, including foreign captives and the population of the tributary areas, about 600,000, which could raise a fairly big army not less than 100,000. According to Strabo the Iberian army numbered 70–80,000 so it appears that each saeristavo had 10,000 soldiers.

While Georgian and Classical evidence makes the contemporaneous Kartlian links with the Seleucids plausible (Toumanoff has even implied that the kings of Kartli might have aided the Seleucids in holding the resurgent Orontids of Armenia in check), Pharnavaz&#x27;s alleged reform of the eristavi fiefdoms is most likely a back-projection of the medieval pattern of subdivision to the remote past.

Pharnavaz is then reported to have embarked on social and cultural projects; he supervised two building projects: the raising of the idol Armazi – reputedly named after him – on a mountain ledge and the construction of a similarly named fortress.

Pharnavaz made alliances with various North Caucasian peoples during his reign, to whom he called upon for help against both Macedonia and internal foes. He took a Durdzuk woman in marriage, in order to consolidate the alliance of Iberia with the Durdzuks, who helped him consolidate his reign against his unruly vassals. Similarly he married his sister to a Sarmatian chief.

According to the &quot;Georgian royal annals&quot; he also created the Georgian script and made the Georgian language an official language of the kingdom:

The chronicles report Pharnavaz&#x27;s lengthy reign of 65 years.

Upon his death, he was buried in front of the idol Armazi and worshipped. His son Sauromaces I succeeded him to the throne.

Pharnavaz&#x27;s grave is undisclosed so far. One of the last monarchs who visited his grave to adorn it and pay his respects was King Mirian III. Pharnavaz&#x27;s very burial in front of idol Armazi suggests a Hellenistic deification of the early monarchs of Iberia.

==Pharnavaz and Arrian&#x27;s Pharasmanes==
Several modern scholars have been tempted to make identification between the Pharnavaz of the medieval Georgian tradition and the Pharasmanes of the Greco-Roman historian Arrian, a 2nd-century AD author of &quot;The Anabasis of Alexander&quot;. Arrian recounts that &quot;Pharasmanes (Фαρασμάνης), king of the Chorasmians&quot;, visited Alexander the Great with 1500 horseman, and pledged his support should Alexander desire to campaign to the Euxine lands and subdue Colchians, whom Pharasmanes names as his neighbors. Apart from the similarity of the names of Pharasmanes and Pharnavaz (both names are apparently based on the same root, the Iranian &quot;farnah&quot;), the king of Chorasmia in Central Asia reports Colchis (today&#x27;s western Georgia, i.e., the western neighbor of ancient Kartli/Iberia) to be a neighboring country. Some Georgian scholars have suggested that the Greek copyists of Arrian might have confused Chorasmia with Cholarzene (Chorzene), a Classical rendering of the southwest Georgian marchlands (the medieval Tao-Klarjeti), which indeed bordered with Colchis and Pontus.

According to Arrian:

==Legacy==

The Bagrationi dynasty claimed descent directly from Pharnavaz. During the continuity of monarchy in Georgia, the Georgian kings presented themselves as heirs to the Kingdom of Iberia founded by King Pharnavaz.

In Tbilisi there is a King Pharnavaz Street, Avenue, and also a statue of Pharnavaz. Also, there are streets named after Pharnavaz in Batumi, Kutaisi, Khashuri, Gori, Gurjaani, Sachkhere, Zestaponi and others. Some buildings, including schools and hotels, also bear his name, as well as about five hundred Georgians.

<doc id="435084" wikidata="Q36938" url="?curid=435084" title="Urn problem">
<text>In probability and statistics, an urn problem is an idealized mental exercise in which some objects of real interest (such as atoms, people, cars, etc.) are represented as colored balls in an urn or other container. One pretends to remove one or more balls from the urn; the goal is to determine the probability of drawing one color or another, 
or some other properties. A number of important variations are described below.

An urn model is either a set of probabilities that describe events within an urn problem, or it is a probability distribution, or a family of such distributions, of random variables associated with urn problems.

==History==

In &quot;Ars Conjectandi&quot; (1713), Jacob Bernoulli considered the problem of determining, given a number of pebbles drawn from an urn, the proportions of different colored pebbles within the urn. This problem was known as the &quot;inverse probability&quot; problem, and was a topic of research in the eighteenth century, attracting the attention of Abraham de Moivre and Thomas Bayes.

Bernoulli used the Latin word &quot;&quot;, which primarily means a clay vessel, but is also the term used in ancient Rome for a vessel of any kind for collecting ballots or lots; the present-day Italian or Spanish word for ballot box is still &quot;&quot;. Bernoulli&#x27;s inspiration may have been lotteries, elections, or games of chance which involved drawing balls from a container, and it has been asserted that elections in medieval and renaissance Venice, including that of the doge, often included the choice of electors by lot, using balls of different colors drawn from an urn.

== Basic urn model ==

In this basic urn model in probability theory, the urn contains &quot;x&quot; white and &quot;y&quot; black balls, well-mixed together. One ball is drawn randomly from the urn and its color observed; it is then placed back in the urn (or not), and the selection process is repeated.

Possible questions that can be answered in this model are:
* Can I infer the proportion of white and black balls from &quot;n&quot; observations? With what degree of confidence?
* Knowing &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, what is the probability of drawing a specific sequence (e.g. one white followed by one black)?
* If I only observe &quot;n&quot; balls, how sure can I be that there are no black balls? (A variation both on the first and the second question)

==Examples of urn problems==

* beta-binomial distribution: as above, except that every time a ball is observed, an additional ball of the same color is added to the urn. Hence, the number of total balls in the urn grows. See Pólya urn model.
* binomial distribution: the distribution of the number of successful draws (trials), i.e. extraction of white balls, given &quot;n&quot; draws with replacement in an urn with black and white balls.
* Hoppe urn: a Pólya urn with an additional ball called the mutator. When the mutator is drawn it is replaced along with an additional ball of an entirely new colour.
* hypergeometric distribution: the balls are not returned to the urn once extracted. Hence, the number of total marbles in the urn decreases. This is referred to as &quot;drawing without replacement&quot;, by opposition to &quot;drawing with replacement&quot;.
* multivariate hypergeometric distribution: the balls are not returned to the urn once extracted, but with balls of more than two colors.
* geometric distribution: number of draws before the first successful (correctly colored) draw.
* Mixed replacement/non-replacement: the urn contains &quot;x&quot; white and &quot;y&quot; black balls. While black balls are set aside after a draw (non-replacement), white balls are returned to the urn after a draw (replacement). The probability &quot;P(m,k)&quot; that &quot;k&quot; black balls will be drawn after &quot;m&quot; draws can be calculated recursively using the formula formula_1.
* multinomial distribution: there are balls of more than two colors. Each time a ball is extracted, it is returned before drawing another ball. This is also known as &#x27;Balls into bins&#x27;.
* negative binomial distribution: number of draws before a certain number of failures (incorrectly colored draws) occurs.
* Occupancy problem: the distribution of the number of occupied urns after the random assignment of &quot;k&quot; balls into &quot;n&quot; urns, related to the coupon collector&#x27;s problem and birthday problem.
* Pólya urn: each time a ball of a particular colour is drawn, it is replaced along with an additional ball of the same colour.
* Statistical physics: derivation of energy and velocity distributions.
* The Ellsberg paradox.

<doc id="435086" wikidata="Q887952" url="?curid=435086" title="Bob Goodlatte">
<text>Robert William Goodlatte (; born September 22, 1952) is an American politician, attorney, and lobbyist who served in the United States House of Representatives representing for 13 terms. A Republican, he was also the Chair of the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over legislation affecting the federal courts, administrative agencies, and federal law enforcement entities. Goodlatte&#x27;s district covered Roanoke and also included Lexington, Lynchburg, Harrisonburg, and Staunton.

In 2017, Goodlatte presided over a GOP effort, conducted in a secret session, to weaken the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, a move widely criticized by House leaders and the opposition party. The proposal passed by a 119 to 74 vote, but it was withdrawn the following day after widespread public criticism. On November 9, 2017, Goodlatte announced that he would not seek reelection in 2018. In February 2020, Goodlatte registered as a lobbyist representing the Project for Privacy &amp; Surveillance Accountability, a nonprofit.

==Early life and education==
Goodlatte was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, the son of Doris B. (née Mentzendorff) and Robert Swan Goodlatte. His paternal ancestry includes English and Irish and his maternal grandfather was a Baltic German from Riga. Goodlatte grew up in Springfield, Massachusetts. Goodlatte received a B.A. in political science from Bates College in Lewiston, Maine in 1974. He also holds a Juris Doctor from Washington and Lee University School of Law in Lexington, Virginia, received in 1977.

==Political and legal career==
In his early professional career he served as a staff aide for 6th District U.S. Congressman M. Caldwell Butler from 1977 to 1979. Goodlatte went on to work as a lawyer in private practice from 1980 to 1993.

===U.S House of Representatives ===


Bob Goodlatte received the Republican nomination at the Republican District convention after Democratic Party candidate Jim Olin opted not to run for reelection in 1992. In the 1992 November general election, Goodlatte defeated Democratic candidate Stephen Musselwhite, who had defeated Olin&#x27;s preferred choice at the district Democratic convention, with 60% of the vote. Goodlatte has been reelected ten times, often running unopposed. His most substantive Democratic opposition was in 1996, when he faced Jeff Grey, and again in 1998, when Roanoke mayor David Bowers challenged him. In an overwhelmingly conservative district, Goodlatte turned back these challenges, with 67% and 69% of the vote, respectively. In 2008, he was challenged by Democratic candidate Sam Rasoul of Roanoke. Goodlatte garnered 62% of the vote. In 2010, Goodlatte was challenged by Independent Jeffrey Vanke and Libertarian Stuart Bain. Goodlatte won with 76.26% of the vote.

In 2009, Goodlatte was appointed to serve as the co-lead impeachment manager (prosecutor) alongside Adam Schiff for the impeachment trial of Judge Samuel B. Kent. The following year, Goodlatte was appointed and served as a House co-lead impeachment manager in the impeachment trial of Thomas Porteous, again alongside Schiff.

==== 2012 election ====

In 2011, Republican Karen Kwiatkowski of Mount Jackson, Virginia, announced that she would challenge Goodlatte in the Republican primary set for June 12, 2012. This was Bob Goodlatte&#x27;s first contested Republican primary. Kwiatkowski earned 34% of the Republican primary vote, with Goodlatte winning 66%. He faced Democratic nominee Andy Schmookler in the general election and defeated him with 66% of the vote.

===Policy views===

The American Conservative Union gave him a 94% evaluation.

====Office of Congressional Ethics====
During a secret meeting on the night before the start of the 115th Congress, Goodlatte led an attempt by House Republicans to reduce the reach of the independent Office of Congressional Ethics. The Office was created in 2008 after numerous infractions involving Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff, resulting in the imprisonment of House member Bob Ney. The proposed amendment to House Rules, spearheaded by Goodlatte, gave the House Ethics Committee - made up of partisan elected officials - oversight of what would be the renamed Office and power to stop inquiries that had the potential to lead to criminal charges. It would have also blocked the Office&#x27;s staff from speaking with reporters and other news media members.

The amendment passed during the secret meeting, but its fortunes were reversed once news of the measure leaked out. The proposed changes immediately drew strong criticism from prominent figures on both sides of the aisle, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, President-elect Donald Trump, and even Abramoff himself. Additionally, social media catalyzed a swift reaction from constituents, with Google reporting that searches for &quot;Who is my representative&quot; surged in the hours following the public unveiling of the mooted changes to the Office. Representatives received thousands of calls demanding they cease their support for the amendment. In less than 24 hours, Goodlatte and his fellow Republicans scrapped the proposal.

====Budget====
One of Goodlatte&#x27;s legislative initiatives was his constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal budget. Goodlatte wrote and put forward both the &quot;clean&quot; Balanced Budget Amendment which had a higher chance of actually passing the House and the Senate as well as a version that makes it harder to increase taxes by requiring a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers to raise taxes. However, Representatives Paul Ryan, Justin Amash, David Dreier and Louie Gohmert voted against the &quot;clean&quot; amendment because it could have allowed taxes to be raised on Americans. Ryan released a statement after the vote, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m concerned that this version will lead to a much bigger government fueled by more taxes. Spending is the problem, yet this version of the Balanced Budget Amendment makes it more likely taxes will be raised, government will grow, and economic freedom will be diminished. Without a limit on government spending, I cannot support this Amendment.&quot;

====National security====

Goodlatte supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. He stated that &quot;The primary duty of the federal government is to keep Americans safe. Today, President Trump has begun to fulfill this responsibility by taking a number of critical steps within his authority to strengthen national security and the integrity of our nation&#x27;s immigration system.&quot;

====Technology====
Goodlatte is the co-chairman of the bipartisan Congressional Internet Caucus, Chairman of the House Republican High-Technology Working Group, and Co-Chairman of the Congressional International Anti-Piracy Caucus.

In 1997 he sponsored the No Electronic Theft Act which criminalized several kinds of non-commercial copyright infringement, in response to the decision for the court case &quot;United States v. LaMacchia&quot; (1994).

Goodlatte is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online gambling. In 2006, he sponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. In September 2006, working with then Iowa Congressman Jim Leach, Goodlatte was a major House supporter of the Unlawful Internet gambling Enforcement Act of 2006. The Act was passed at midnight the day Congress adjourned before the 2006 elections. Prior to it being added to the bill, the gambling provisions had not been debated by any Congressional committee. The bill was made sure to exclude online gambling. They claimed moral reasons for pushing for a ban on Internet gambling, but critics charge that it was due to campaign contributions from Microsoft and Steam.

==== Russia probe ====
Goodlatte invoked surveillance abuse against Martin Luther King Jr. in the context of alleged surveillance abuses against Trump 2016 campaign advisor Carter Page.

==== Savanna&#x27;s Act ====
His last act as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee before leaving in December 2018 was to block Savanna&#x27;s Act, a bill introduced by Heidi Heitkamp and which had passed without opposition in the Senate. The bill, previously known as S.1942, was nicknamed after Fargo, North Dakota resident Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind was brutally murdered in August 2017 as an example of the horrific statistics regarding abuse and homicide of Native American women.

<text>USS &quot;Albacore&quot; has been the name of more than one United States Navy ship, and may refer to:

*, a patrol vessel in commission from 1917 to 1919
*, a fleet submarine commissioned in 1942 and sunk in 1944
*, an experimental test platform submarine in commission from 1953 to 1972</text><links>

<doc id="435088" wikidata="Q1347169" url="?curid=435088" title="USS Albacore (SS-218)">
<text>USS &quot;Albacore&quot; (SS-218) was a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine which served in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II, winning the Presidential Unit Citation and nine battle stars for her service. During the war, she was credited with sinking 13 Japanese ships (including two destroyers, the light cruiser and the aircraft carrier ) and damaging another five; not all of these credits were confirmed by postwar Joint Army–Navy Assessment Committee (JANAC) accounting. She also holds the distinction of sinking the highest warship tonnage of any U.S. submarine. She was lost in 1944, probably sunk by a mine off northern Hokkaidō on 7 November.

&quot;Albacore&quot; was the second vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the albacore.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Albacore&quot;′s keel was laid on 21 April 1941 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 17 February 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Elise Riles Cutts, and commissioned on 1 June 1942.

==Service history==

===World War II===

====1942====

Following shakedown, the submarine proceeded via the Panama Canal to Pearl Harbor and, from that base on 28 August 1942, began her first war patrol, to waters of the north and northeast pass through the coral reef which surrounds Truk. On 13 September, &quot;Albacore&quot; sighted two cargo vessels in column and prepared for her first combat action. She made a submerged approach and fired three torpedoes at the leading ship and two at the second. One or two torpedoes hit on the first ship; none struck the second. &quot;Albacore&quot; claimed to have damaged the leading vessel.

Her next enemy contact came on 1 October when she made a night surface attack on a Japanese tanker. She expended seven torpedoes and scored two hits. Although the tanker appeared to be low in the water, she was still able to leave the scene under her own power. On 9 October, &quot;Albacore&quot; spotted a &quot;Shōkaku&quot;-class aircraft carrier escorted by a heavy cruiser and a destroyer, but the submarine was depth charged by the escorts and forced to break off her pursuit. The next day, she attacked a freighter. One torpedo hit the mark, and 12 minutes after firing, the sound of two heavy explosions caused the submarine&#x27;s crew to presume they had downed the vessel.

Beginning on the mid-morning of 11 October, &quot;Albacore&quot; was depth charged numerous times. At 1548, the conning officer finally spotted the Japanese attackers, two submarine chasers and an airplane. A third ship equipped with sound gear joined the group and continued the hunt. The ships crisscrossed over &quot;Albacore&quot;, close enough for propeller noise to reverberate throughout her hull and compelled her to proceed at silent running, with her ventilator fans shut down. After a chase of nearly seven hours, the Japanese ships disappeared astern, and &quot;Albacore&quot; then surfaced to clear the immediate area. The next day, &quot;Albacore&quot; headed for Midway Island. Although she had had several opportunities to score during the patrol, &quot;Albacore&quot; was not credited with any damage to Japanese shipping. The submarine arrived at Midway Island on 20 October and commenced a refit.

With her refurbishing completed and a new Oerlikon 20 mm cannon installed, &quot;Albacore&quot; sailed on 11 November for her second patrol. Her assigned areas were the St. George&#x27;s Channel, New Britain, along the east coast of New Guinea to Vitiaz Strait, and the Dallman Pass off Madang harbor. On 24 November, the submarine spotted a convoy of two cargo vessels. &quot;Albacore&quot; maneuvered into position and fired two stern tubes, but neither torpedo found its target. Two days later, on 26 November, &quot;Albacore&quot; herself became the quarry. Two Japanese destroyers depth charged her and the explosions caused numerous small leaks around the cable packing glands in the pressure hull. After a two-hour chase, the Japanese retired, and &quot;Albacore&quot; shifted her patrol area to Vitiaz Strait. Another golden opportunity arose on 13 December, when &quot;Albacore&quot; found three Japanese destroyers. She released a three-torpedo spread but again was unsuccessful. On 18 December, &quot;Albacore&quot; was stationed off Madang. The submarine discovered what seemed to be a transport and a destroyer.

&quot;Albacore&quot; torpedoed the &quot;transport,&quot; and it exploded in a mass of flames and sank. &quot;Albacore&quot; had in fact downed the light cruiser , the second Japanese cruiser sunk by an American submarine in World War II. &quot;Albacore&quot; put into port at Brisbane, Australia, on 30 December.

====1943====

After an overhaul of her engines, &quot;Albacore&quot; got underway on 20 January 1943 to begin her third patrol. Off the north coast of New Guinea, she spotted 11 targets in as many days. The first group, encountered on 20 February, consisted of a destroyer and a frigate escorting a minelayer. &quot;Albacore&quot; fired ten torpedoes and believed she had sunk the destroyer, &quot;Oshio&quot; and damaged the frigate. In the following days, &quot;Albacore&quot; attacked one tanker, several freighters, and another destroyer. Of eight torpedoes expended during these actions, all missed their targets. When &quot;Albacore&quot; ended her patrol at Brisbane on 11 March, she was credited with sinking one destroyer and a frigate for a total of 2,250 tons.

&quot;Albacore&quot; was briefly dry-docked for repairs and underwent refresher training before sailing for a fourth patrol on 6 April. This time, her area was around the Solomon Islands and Bismarck Islands and off the north coast of New Guinea. While she sighted several convoys, she recorded no hits. &quot;Albacore&quot; returned to Brisbane on 26 May. While &quot;Albacore&quot; was being refitted at that port, Lieutenant Commander Oscar Hagberg took command of the submarine.

On 16 June, &quot;Albacore&quot; was underway for her fifth patrol in waters surrounding the Bismarcks and the Solomons. During this patrol, she sighted three separate convoys and attacked two. &quot;Albacore&quot; claimed to have damaged a transport on 19 July but the submarine failed to sink any vessels. &quot;Albacore&quot; arrived back at Brisbane and began a refit alongside .

On 23 August, &quot;Albacore&quot; left to patrol roughly the same area as on her previous assignment. She spotted a Japanese submarine on 31 August but was unable to press home an attack. On 4 September, she encountered a two-ship convoy protected by two escorts and sank one of the ships, the auxiliary gunboat &quot;Heijo Maru&quot;, with three torpedo hits made shortly after the initial contact. The submarine then pursued the other vessel for the next two days but was able to inflict only minor hull damage on her target. She terminated her patrol at Brisbane on 26 September.

&quot;Albacore&quot;″s seventh patrol began on 12 October 1943. She fired six torpedoes at a large merchant ship on 25 October but recorded no hits. On 6 November, she received a report of a convoy which had been spotted by , and began to search for it. On 8 November, the submarine found the convoy and started to track it. However, a plane from the United States Army Air Forces Fifth Air Force bombed and strafed her north-northwest of Mussau Island at and caused her to lose contact with the Japanese ships. Four bombs landed close alongside &quot;Albacore&quot; as she submerged to escape the attack, but she sustained no damage.

&quot;Albacore&quot; was again bombed by an American Fifth Air Force aircraft on 10 November in the northeastern portion of the St. George&#x27;s Channel southwest of Kavieng, New Ireland at . This time, a four-engine bomber dropped a string of bombs which straddled &quot;Albacore&quot;, and the submarine suffered considerable damage. All auxiliary power was knocked out, and the submarine was plunged into total darkness. The main induction valve went under water before it was shut, and it began filling up with water. &quot;Albacore&quot; plunged to a depth of before her dive was checked. For the next two and one-half hours, she bounced between and while at various attitudes. She finally managed to return to the surface with her trim almost restored. The submarine re-submerged, and it was decided to continue the patrol while simultaneously making necessary repairs.

Following this ordeal, &quot;Albacore&quot; received orders to locate and attack the light cruiser , which had been hit and damaged by the submarine . &quot;Albacore&quot; found &quot;Agano&quot; on 12 November and tried to attack, but Japanese destroyers subjected the submarine to a four-hour depth-charge barrage.

On 25 November, &quot;Albacore&quot; sank the Japanese army transport &quot;Kenzan Maru&quot;.

On her return to Brisbane on 5 December, Lieutenant Commander James W. Blanchard replaced Hagberg in command.

&quot;Albacore&quot; departed Australia on 26 December to patrol north of the Bismarck Islands. On 12 January 1944, she sank &quot;Choko Maru&quot; with two separate torpedo attacks. Two days later, in company with and , she blew up (flushed by &quot;Guardfish&quot;) with four torpedoes from her stern tubes. Another destroyer attacked &quot;Albacore&quot; with fifty-nine depth charges, leaving &quot;Scamp&quot; and &quot;Guardfish&quot; free to pursue the three tankers; they succeeded in sinking one each. Following more than a fortnight of uneventful patrolling, the submarine headed home. She made brief fuel stops at Tulagi and Midway Island before reaching Pearl Harbor on 22 February. After three days of repairs to get her ready for the voyage, &quot;Albacore&quot; continued on to the Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California for overhaul.

====1944====

&quot;Albacore&quot; left Mare Island on 5 May 1944 and held training exercises with USS &quot;Shad&quot; &quot;en route&quot; to Hawaii. &quot;Albacore&quot; reached Pearl Harbor on 13 May and spent the next two weeks on final repairs and training. &quot;Albacore&quot; began her ninth patrol on 29 May, and was assigned waters west of the Mariana Islands and around the Palau Islands. In the next few days, she made only one contact, a Japanese convoy on 11 June. Before the submarine could maneuver into attack position, a Japanese aircraft forced her to dive and lose contact.

====Sinking of &quot;Taihō&quot;====
On the morning of 18 June, two days after American forces began landing on Saipan, &quot;Albacore&quot; shifted from her position west of the Mariana Islands to further south. Admiral Charles A. Lockwood (ComSubPac) ordered this move in the hope of enabling the submarine to intercept a Japanese task force (under command of Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa) reportedly steaming from Tawi Tawi toward Saipan. At about 0800 the next morning, &quot;Albacore&quot; raised her periscope and found herself in the midst of Ozawa&#x27;s main carrier group. Blanchard allowed one Japanese carrier to pass by and selected a second one for his target. Once inside , the submarine&#x27;s Torpedo Data Computer started giving false information. To maximize the odds of a hit, Blanchard fired all six bow tubes. The carrier was in the process of launching an air strike, and one of the pilots (Sakio Komatsu) intentionally dove his plane into a torpedo, setting it off early. Three Japanese destroyers immediately charged &quot;Albacore&quot;. While the submarine was diving to escape, her crew heard one solid torpedo explosion. About that same time, 25 depth charges began raining down on the submarine. Then Blanchard heard &quot;a distant and persistent explosion of great force&quot; followed by another.

No one on &quot;Albacore&quot; thought &quot;Taihō&quot; had sunk, and her skipper was angry for &quot;missing a golden opportunity.&quot; After this action, &quot;Albacore&quot; was assigned lifeguard duty for planes striking Yap and Ulithi. On 2 July, &quot;Albacore&quot; shifted over to intercept traffic between Yap and the Palau Islands. The submarine spotted a wooden inter-island steamer loaded with Japanese civilians. &quot;Albacore&quot; decided to stage a surface gun attack. After ensuring the ship was afire, &quot;Albacore&quot; dived to avoid an airplane. The submarine surfaced soon thereafter and picked up five survivors. The sunken vessel was the &quot;Taimei Maru&quot; from Yap to Palau.

&quot;Albacore&quot; put into Majuro on 15 July. She was praised for an aggressive patrol and received credit for damaging a &quot;Shōkaku&quot;-class carrier. American codebreakers had lost track of &quot;Taihō&quot; after the Battle of the Philippine Sea and, while puzzled, did not realize she had gone down. Only months later did a prisoner of war reveal her sinking.

After a refit alongside , the submarine began her tenth patrol on 8 August. Her assignment was the Bungo Suido-Kii Suido area. During this period, &quot;Albacore&quot; was credited with sinking two Japanese vessels, an 880-ton cargo ship &quot;Shingetau Maru&quot; on 5 September and the 170-ton &quot;Submarine Chaser #165&quot; on 11 September. The patrol ended at Pearl Harbor on 25 September.

====Loss====
&quot;Albacore&quot; left Pearl Harbor on 24 October 1944, topped up her fuel tanks at Midway Island on 28 October, and was never heard from again. On 21 December, &quot;Albacore&quot; was presumed lost with all hands. Her name was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 March 1945.

According to Japanese records obtained after the war, a submarine (presumed to be &quot;Albacore&quot;) struck a naval mine very close to the shore off northeastern Hokkaidō on 7 November 1944. A Japanese patrol boat witnessed the explosion of a submerged submarine and saw a great deal of heavy oil, cork, bedding, and food supplies rise to the surface.

==Discovery of wreck==
On 25 May 2022, a Japanese team led by Dr. Tamaki Ura of the University of Tokyo began a search for the wreck of &quot;Albacore&quot; off Hokkaidō in waters about east of Hakodate. During the day, the team&#x27;s sonar detected what appeared to be a submarine hull in length on the seabed at a depth of . On 26 May 2022, the team used a remotely operated underwater vehicle to photograph the wreck, capturing an image of what appeared to be the bridge and periscope of a submarine. The team concluded that the wreck very likely was that of &quot;Albacore&quot;, based on its position and the shape of its hull. The team planned to conduct a more detailed survey of the wreck in August 2022. On 16 February 2023, the Naval History and Heritage Command confirmed the identity of the wreck as &quot;Albacore&quot;, based on documented modifications made to her prior to her last patrol.

<doc id="435089" wikidata="Q898452" url="?curid=435089" title="Noble gas compound">
<text>In chemistry, noble gas compounds are chemical compounds that include an element from the noble gases, group 8 or 18 of the periodic table. Although the noble gases are generally unreactive elements, many such compounds have been observed, particularly involving the element xenon.

From the standpoint of chemistry, the noble gases may be divided into two groups: the relatively reactive krypton (ionisation energy 14.0 eV), xenon (12.1 eV), and radon (10.7 eV) on one side, and the very unreactive argon (15.8 eV), neon (21.6 eV), and helium (24.6 eV) on the other. Consistent with this classification, Kr, Xe, and Rn form compounds that can be isolated in bulk at or near standard temperature and pressure, whereas He, Ne, Ar have been observed to form true chemical bonds using spectroscopic techniques, but only when frozen into a noble gas matrix at temperatures of or lower, in supersonic jets of noble gas, or under extremely high pressures with metals.

The heavier noble gases have more electron shells than the lighter ones. Hence, the outermost electrons are subject to a shielding effect from the inner electrons that makes them more easily ionized, since they are less strongly attracted to the positively-charged nucleus. This results in an ionization energy low enough to form stable compounds with the most electronegative elements, fluorine and oxygen, and even with less electronegative elements such as nitrogen and carbon under certain circumstances.

==History and background==

When the family of noble gases was first identified at the end of the nineteenth century, none of them were observed to form any compounds and so it was initially believed that they were all &quot;inert gases&quot; (as they were then known) which could not form compounds. With the development of atomic theory in the early twentieth century, their inertness was ascribed to a full valence shell of electrons which render them very chemically stable and nonreactive. All noble gases have full &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; outer electron shells (except helium, which has no &quot;p&quot; sublevel), and so do not form chemical compounds easily. Their high ionization energy and almost zero electron affinity explain their non-reactivity.

In 1933, Linus Pauling predicted that the heavier noble gases would be able to form compounds with fluorine and oxygen. Specifically, he predicted the existence of krypton hexafluoride () and xenon hexafluoride (), speculated that might exist as an unstable compound, and suggested that xenic acid would form perxenate salts. These predictions proved quite accurate, although subsequent predictions for indicated that it would be not only thermodynamically unstable, but kinetically unstable. As of 2022, has not been made, although the octafluoroxenate(VI) anion () has been observed.

By 1960, no compound with a covalently bound noble gas atom had yet been synthesized. The first published report, in June 1962, of a noble gas compound was by Neil Bartlett, who noticed that the highly oxidising compound platinum hexafluoride ionised  to . As the ionisation energy of to (1165 kJ mol−1) is nearly equal to the ionisation energy of Xe to (1170 kJ mol−1), he tried the reaction of Xe with . This yielded a crystalline product, xenon hexafluoroplatinate, whose formula was proposed to be .
It was later shown that the compound is actually more complex, containing both and . Nonetheless, this was the first real compound of any noble gas.

The first binary noble gas compounds were reported later in 1962. Bartlett synthesized xenon tetrafluoride () by subjecting a mixture of xenon and fluorine to high temperature. Rudolf Hoppe, among other groups, synthesized xenon difluoride () by the reaction of the elements.

Following the first successful synthesis of xenon compounds, synthesis of krypton difluoride () was reported in 1963.

==True noble gas compounds==

In this section, the non-radioactive noble gases are considered in decreasing order of atomic weight, which generally reflects the priority of their discovery, and the breadth of available information for these compounds. The radioactive elements radon and oganesson are harder to study and are considered at the end of the section.

===Xenon compounds===

After the initial 1962 studies on  and , xenon compounds that have been synthesized include other fluorides (), oxyfluorides (, , , , ) and oxides (,  and ). Xenon fluorides react with several other fluorides to form fluoroxenates, such as sodium octafluoroxenate(VI) (), and fluoroxenonium salts, such as trifluoroxenonium hexafluoroantimonate ().

In terms of other halide reactivity, short-lived excimers of noble gas halides such as  or XeCl are prepared in situ, and are used in the function of excimer lasers.

Recently, xenon has been shown to produce a wide variety of compounds of the type where &quot;n&quot; is 1, 2 or 3 and X is any electronegative group, such as , , , , , , etc.; the range of compounds is impressive, similar to that seen with the neighbouring element iodine, running into the thousands and involving bonds between xenon and oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, boron and even gold, as well as perxenic acid, several halides, and complex ions.

The compound contains a Xe–Xe bond, which is the longest element-element bond known (308.71 pm = 3.0871 Å). Short-lived excimers of are reported to exist as a part of the function of excimer lasers.

===Krypton compounds===

Krypton gas reacts with fluorine gas under extreme forcing conditions, forming  according to the following equation:
 reacts with strong Lewis acids to form salts of the and cations. The preparation of reported by Grosse in 1963, using the Claasen method, was subsequently shown to be a mistaken identification.

Krypton compounds with other than Kr–F bonds (compounds with atoms other than fluorine) have also been described. reacts with to produce the unstable compound, , with a krypton-oxygen bond. A krypton-nitrogen bond is found in the cation , produced by the reaction of with below −50 °C.

===Argon compounds===
The discovery of HArF was announced in 2000. The compound can exist in low temperature argon matrices for experimental studies, and it has also been studied computationally. Argon hydride ion was obtained in the 1970s.
This molecular ion has also been identified in the Crab nebula, based on the frequency of its light emissions.

There is a possibility that a solid salt of could be prepared with  or  anions.

===Neon and helium compounds===
The ions, , , , and are known from optical and mass spectrometric studies. Neon also forms an unstable hydrate. There is some empirical and theoretical evidence for a few metastable helium compounds which may exist at very low temperatures or extreme pressures. The stable cation  was reported in 1925, but was not considered a true compound since it is not neutral and cannot be isolated. In 2016 scientists created the helium compound disodium helide () which was the first helium compound discovered.

===Radon and oganesson compounds===
Radon is not chemically inert, but its short half-life (3.8 days for 222Rn) and the high energy of its radioactivity make it difficult to investigate its only fluoride (), its reported oxide (), and their reaction products.

All known oganesson isotopes have even shorter half-lives in the millisecond range and no compounds are known yet, although some have been predicted theoretically. It is expected to be even more reactive than radon, more like a normal element than a noble gas in its chemistry.

==Reports prior to xenon hexafluoroplatinate and xenon tetrafluoride ==

===Clathrates===
Prior to 1962, the only isolated compounds of noble gases were clathrates (including clathrate hydrates); other compounds such as coordination compounds were observed only by spectroscopic means. Clathrates (also known as cage compounds) are compounds of noble gases in which they are trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. Ar, Kr, Xe and Ne can form clathrates with crystalline hydroquinone. Kr and Xe can appear as guests in crystals of melanophlogite.

Helium-nitrogen () crystals have been grown at room temperature at pressures ca. 10 GPa in a diamond anvil cell. Solid argon-hydrogen clathrate () has the same crystal structure as the Laves phase. It forms at pressures between 4.3 and 220 GPa, though Raman measurements suggest that the molecules in dissociate above 175 GPa. A similar solid forms at pressures above 5 GPa. It has a face-centered cubic structure where krypton octahedra are surrounded by randomly oriented hydrogen molecules. Meanwhile, in solid xenon atoms form dimers inside solid hydrogen.

===Coordination compounds===
Coordination compounds such as have been postulated to exist at low temperatures, but have never been confirmed.

Xenon is known to function as a metal ligand. In addition to the charged [AuXe4]2+, xenon, krypton, and argon all reversibly bind to gaseous M(CO)5, where M=Cr, Mo, or W. &quot;P&quot;-block metals also bind noble gases: XeBeO has been observed spectroscopically and both XeBeS and FXeBO are predicted stable.

Also, compounds such as and were reported to have been formed by electron bombardment, but recent research has shown that these are probably the result of He being adsorbed on the surface of the metal; therefore, these compounds cannot truly be considered chemical compounds.

===Hydrates===
Hydrates are formed by compressing noble gases in water, where it is believed that the water molecule, a strong dipole, induces a weak dipole in the noble gas atoms, resulting in dipole-dipole interaction. Heavier atoms are more influenced than smaller ones, hence was reported to have been the most stable hydrate; it has a melting point of 24 °C. The deuterated version of this hydrate has also been produced.

==Fullerene adducts==

 Noble gases can also form endohedral fullerene compounds where the noble gas atom is trapped inside a fullerene molecule. In 1993, it was discovered that when is exposed to a pressure of around 3 bar of He or Ne, the complexes and are formed. Under these conditions, only about one out of every 650,000 cages was doped with a helium atom; with higher pressures (3000 bar), it is possible to achieve a yield of up to 0.1%. Endohedral complexes with argon, krypton and xenon have also been obtained, as well as numerous adducts of .

==Applications==
Most applications of noble gas compounds are either as oxidising agents or as a means to store noble gases in a dense form. Xenic acid is a valuable oxidising agent because it has no potential for introducing impurities—xenon is simply liberated as a gas—and so is rivalled only by ozone in this regard. The perxenates are even more powerful oxidizing agents. Xenon-based oxidants have also been used for synthesizing carbocations stable at room temperature, in  solution.

Stable salts of xenon containing very high proportions of fluorine by weight (such as tetrafluoroammonium heptafluoroxenate(VI), , and the related tetrafluoroammonium octafluoroxenate(VI) ), have been developed as highly energetic oxidisers for use as propellants in rocketry. 

Xenon fluorides are good fluorinating agents.

Clathrates have been used for separation of He and Ne from Ar, Kr, and Xe, and also for the transportation of Ar, Kr, and Xe. (For instance, radioactive isotopes of krypton and xenon are difficult to store and dispose, and compounds of these elements may be more easily handled than the gaseous forms.) In addition, clathrates of radioisotopes may provide suitable formulations for experiments requiring sources of particular types of radiation; hence. 85Kr clathrate provides a safe source of beta particles, while 133Xe clathrate provides a useful source of gamma rays.

<text>Carlos Eduardo Lyra Barbosa (11 May 1933 – 16 December 2023) was a Brazilian singer, and composer of numerous bossa nova and Música popular brasileira classics. He has also worked as a writer, with notable contributions to musical films such as Para Viver um Grande Amor and Intimidade. He and Antônio Carlos Jobim were the first two music composers, together with lyricists Vinicius de Moraes and Ronaldo Boscoli, to be recorded by João Gilberto on his first LP entitled &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot; (1959), which was called the first generation of Bossa Nova. 

==Career==
His first song to be recorded was &quot;Menina&quot; (1954), issued as a single by Sylvia Telles in 1955, with &quot;Foi a noite&quot; by Antônio Carlos Jobim on the other side of the record. The writers first met because of this single, when Jobim called Lyra &quot;the other side of the record&quot;. At that time, both were writing their own music and lyrics creating a colloquial and completely new style. They wrote about their own experiences and feelings. A completely different lyrical style from most songs written at that time.

His first compositions (music and lyrics), from 1954 to 1956 included: &quot;Quando chegares&quot;; &quot;Menina&quot;; &quot;Barquinho de Papel&quot;; &quot;Ciúme&quot;; &quot;Criticando&quot; and &quot;Maria Ninguém&quot;. In 1957 he started to compose together with the lyricist Ronaldo Bôscoli, songs such as &quot;Lobo bobo&quot;, &quot;Saudade fez um samba&quot; and&quot; Se é tarde me perdoa&quot;. In 1958 he wrote &quot;Aruanda&quot; and &quot;Quem quiser encontrar o amor&quot;, with Geraldo Vandré. In 1960 he started to compose together with Vinicius de Moraes, songs such as &quot;Você e eu&quot;; &quot;Coisa mais linda&quot;, Sabe você?&quot;, &quot;Samba do Carioca&quot;; &quot;Maria Moita&quot; and many others. They wrote together a musical play, in 1962, called &quot;Pobre Menina Rica&quot; (Poor little rich girl blue).

In 1961 he was one of the five founders of CPC (Center of Popular Culture) where he started to write songs for cinema and theater. He also wrote the song &quot;Influência do Jazz&quot;, one of the songs he sang at the Bossa Nova Concert at Carnegie Hall, in 1962. This performance introduced bossa nova to American audiences, alongside other notable Brazilian artists like João Gilberto, Antônio Carlos Jobim, Sérgio Mendes, and Milton Banana. 

Many of Bossa Nova&#x27;s leading lights were either writers or performers; Lyra was one of the few who did both. Charismatic on stage, with a rich baritone voice, he captivated audiences throughout Brazil and, in the mid-1960s, in the United States, where he spent two years touring with saxophonist Stan Getz, the premier American exponent of bossa nova.

Lyra distinguished himself from his fellow bossa nova musicians by also engaging with politics. He was an outspoken leftist who joined the Communist Party and helped establish the People&#x27;s Center for Culture, a space in Rio de Janeiro for progressive students and artists. He wrote songs about social and political issues, frequently coding his messages after the 1964 military coup in Brazil, which forced him into exile twice, first in Mexico City and then in Los Angeles.

== Personal life and death ==
Carlos Eduardo Lyra Barbosa was born May 11, 1933, in Rio de Janeiro. His mother, Helena (Lyra) Barbosa, was a homemaker, while his father, José Domingos Barbosa, was an officer in the Brazilian Navy. Lyra was musically gifted and grew up in a family full of amateur artists and musicians. He learned classical guitar from Moacir Santos, an influential composer and music teacher, and began writing songs in his teens.

Lyra was musically gifted and grew up in a family full of amateur artists and musicians. He learned classical guitar from Moacir Santos, an influential composer and music teacher, and began writing songs in his teens.

Lyra left Brazil after the 1964 coup and settled in Mexico City, where he met many other self-exiled Brazilian artists. He met and married Katherine Riddell, a Brazilian actress known by her stage name Kate Lyra. They eventually divorced. Along with his daughter, Mr. Lyra moved with his second wife, Magda Pereira Botafogo; his sister, Maria Helena Lyra Fialho; and his brother, Sérgio.

He returned to Brazil in the early 1970s before going into travels again in 1974, this time in Los Angeles. There, he received primal scream therapy from Arthur Janov and befriended another famous participant, John Lennon. Two years later, he returned to Brazil permanently, settling in Rio de Janeiro.

Carlos Lyra died in Rio de Janeiro on 16 December 2023, at the age of 90. THis daughter, Kay Lyra, stated that he died of sepsis. Among the many celebrations surrounding his 90th birthday was the release of the album &quot;Afeto: Homenagem Carlos Lyra (90 Anos),&quot; which featured his songs performed by some of Brazil&#x27;s most prominent musicians, including Gilberto Gil, Joyce Moreno, and Mônica Salmaso.

<text>In probability theory, the conditional expectation, conditional expected value, or conditional mean of a random variable is its expected value evaluated with respect to the conditional probability distribution. If the random variable can take on only a finite number of values, the &quot;conditions&quot; are that the variable can only take on a subset of those values. More formally, in the case when the random variable is defined over a discrete probability space, the &quot;conditions&quot; are a partition of this probability space.

Depending on the context, the conditional expectation can be either a random variable or a function. The random variable is denoted formula_1 analogously to conditional probability. The function form is either denoted formula_2 or a separate function symbol such as formula_3 is introduced with the meaning formula_4.

==Examples==

=== Example 1: Dice rolling ===
Consider the roll of a fair die and let &quot;A&quot; = 1 if the number is even (i.e., 2, 4, or 6) and &quot;A&quot; = 0 otherwise. Furthermore, let &quot;B&quot; = 1 if the number is prime (i.e., 2, 3, or 5) and &quot;B&quot; = 0 otherwise.
The unconditional expectation of A is formula_5, but the expectation of A &quot;conditional&quot; on &quot;B&quot; = 1 (i.e., conditional on the die roll being 2, 3, or 5) is formula_6, and the expectation of A conditional on &quot;B&quot; = 0 (i.e., conditional on the die roll being 1, 4, or 6) is formula_7. Likewise, the expectation of B conditional on A = 1 is formula_8, and the expectation of &quot;B&quot; conditional on &quot;A&quot; = 0 is formula_9.

=== Example 2: Rainfall data ===
Suppose we have daily rainfall data (mm of rain each day) collected by a weather station on every day of the ten-year (3652-day) period from January 1, 1990, to December 31, 1999. The unconditional expectation of rainfall for an unspecified day is the average of the rainfall amounts for those 3652 days. The &quot;conditional&quot; expectation of rainfall for an otherwise unspecified day known to be (conditional on being) in the month of March, is the average of daily rainfall over all 310 days of the ten–year period that fall in March. Similarly, the conditional expectation of rainfall conditional on days dated March 2 is the average of the rainfall amounts that occurred on the ten days with that specific date.

== History ==
The related concept of conditional probability dates back at least to Laplace, who calculated conditional distributions. It was Andrey Kolmogorov who, in 1933, formalized it using the Radon–Nikodym theorem. In works of Paul Halmos and Joseph L. Doob from 1953, conditional expectation was generalized to its modern definition using sub-&quot;σ&quot;-algebras.

== Definitions ==

=== Conditioning on an event ===
If is an event in formula_10 with nonzero probability,
and is a discrete random variable, the conditional expectation
of given is
:formula_11
where the sum is taken over all possible outcomes of .

If formula_12, the conditional expectation is undefined due to the division by zero.

=== Discrete random variables ===
If and are discrete random variables,
the conditional expectation of given is
:formula_13
where formula_14 is the joint probability mass function of and . The sum is taken over all possible outcomes of . 

Remark that as above the expression is undefined if formula_15.

Conditioning on a discrete random variable is the same as conditioning on the corresponding event:
:formula_16 
where is the set formula_17.

=== Continuous random variables ===
Let formula_18 and formula_19 be continuous random variables with joint density
formula_20
formula_19&#x27;s density
formula_22
and conditional density formula_23 of formula_18 given the event formula_25
The conditional expectation of formula_18 given formula_27 is
:formula_28
When the denominator is zero, the expression is undefined.

Conditioning on a continuous random variable is not the same as conditioning on the event formula_17 as it was in the discrete case. For a discussion, see Conditioning on an event of probability zero. Not respecting this distinction can lead to contradictory conclusions as illustrated by the Borel-Kolmogorov paradox.

=== L2 random variables ===
All random variables in this section are assumed to be in formula_30, that is square integrable.
In its full generality, conditional expectation is developed without this assumption, see below under Conditional expectation with respect to a sub-&quot;σ&quot;-algebra. The formula_30 theory is, however, considered more intuitive and admits important generalizations.
In the context of formula_30 random variables, conditional expectation is also called regression.
In what follows let formula_33 be a probability space, and formula_34 in 
formula_30 with mean formula_36 and variance formula_37.
The expectation formula_36 minimizes the mean squared error:
:formula_39

The conditional expectation of is defined analogously, except instead of a single number 
formula_36, the result will be a function formula_41. Let formula_42 be a random vector. The conditional expectation formula_43 is a measurable function such that
:formula_44

Note that unlike formula_36, the conditional expectation formula_46 is not generally unique: there may be multiple minimizers of the mean squared error.

==== Uniqueness ====

Example 1: Consider the case where is the constant random variable that is always 1.
Then the mean squared error is minimized by any function of the form
:formula_47

Example 2: Consider the case where is the 2-dimensional random vector formula_48. Then clearly
:formula_49
but in terms of functions it can be expressed as formula_50 or formula_51 or infinitely many other ways. In the context of linear regression, this lack of uniqueness is called multicollinearity.

Conditional expectation is unique up to a set of measure zero in formula_52. The measure used is the pushforward measure induced by .

In the first example, the pushforward measure is a Dirac distribution at 1. In the second it is concentrated on the &quot;diagonal&quot; formula_53, so that any set not intersecting it has measure 0.

==== Existence ====

The existence of a minimizer for formula_54 is non-trivial. It can be shown that
:formula_55
is a closed subspace of the Hilbert space formula_56.
By the Hilbert projection theorem, the necessary and sufficient condition for
formula_46 to be a minimizer is that for all formula_58 in we have
:formula_59
In words, this equation says that the residual formula_60 is orthogonal to the space of all functions of .
This orthogonality condition, applied to the indicator functions formula_61,
is used below to extend conditional expectation to the case that and are not necessarily in formula_30.

==== Connections to regression ====

The conditional expectation is often approximated in applied mathematics and statistics due to the difficulties in analytically calculating it, and for interpolation.

The Hilbert subspace
:formula_63 
defined above is replaced with subsets thereof by restricting the functional form of , rather than allowing any measurable function. Examples of this are decision tree regression when is required to be a simple function, linear regression when is required to be affine, etc.

These generalizations of conditional expectation come at the cost of many of its properties no longer holding.
For example, let 
be the space of all linear functions of and let formula_64 denote this generalized conditional expectation/formula_30 projection. If formula_66 does not contain the constant functions, the tower property 
formula_67
will not hold.

An important special case is when and are jointly normally distributed. In this case
it can be shown that the conditional expectation is equivalent to linear regression:
:formula_68
for coefficients formula_69 described in Multivariate normal distribution#Conditional distributions.

=== Conditional expectation with respect to a sub-&quot;σ&quot;-algebra ===
Consider the following:
* formula_33 is a probability space.
* formula_71 is a random variable on that probability space with finite expectation.
* formula_72 is a sub-&quot;σ&quot;-algebra of formula_10.

Since formula_74 is a sub formula_75-algebra of formula_10, the function formula_71 is usually not formula_74-measurable, thus the existence of the integrals of the form formula_79, where formula_80 and formula_81 is the restriction of formula_82 to formula_74, cannot be stated in general. However, the local averages formula_84 can be recovered in formula_85 with the help of the conditional expectation. 

A conditional expectation of &quot;X&quot; given formula_74, denoted as formula_87, is any formula_74-measurable function formula_89 which satisfies:

:formula_90

for each formula_91.

As noted in the formula_30 discussion, this condition is equivalent to saying that the residual formula_93 is orthogonal to the indicator functions formula_94:
:formula_95

==== Existence ====

The existence of formula_87 can be established by noting that formula_97 for formula_98 is a finite measure on formula_99 that is absolutely continuous with respect to formula_82. If formula_101 is the natural injection from formula_74 to formula_10, then formula_104 is the restriction of formula_105 to formula_74 and formula_107 is the restriction of formula_82 to formula_74. Furthermore, formula_110 is absolutely continuous with respect to formula_111, because the condition
:formula_112
implies
:formula_113

Thus, we have 
:formula_114
where the derivatives are Radon–Nikodym derivatives of measures.

==== Conditional expectation with respect to a random variable ====
Consider, in addition to the above,
* A measurable space formula_115, and
* A random variable formula_116.

The conditional expectation of given is defined by applying the above construction on the &quot;σ&quot;-algebra generated by :
:formula_117

By the Doob–Dynkin lemma, there exists a function formula_118 such that
:formula_119

==== Discussion ====

* This is not a constructive definition; we are merely given the required property that a conditional expectation must satisfy.
** The definition of formula_120 may resemble that of formula_121 for an event formula_122 but these are very different objects. The former is a formula_74-measurable function formula_89, while the latter is an element of formula_52 and formula_126 for formula_80.
** Uniqueness can be shown to be almost sure: that is, versions of the same conditional expectation will only differ on a set of probability zero.
* The &quot;σ&quot;-algebra formula_74 controls the &quot;granularity&quot; of the conditioning. A conditional expectation formula_129 over a finer (larger) &quot;σ&quot;-algebra formula_74 retains information about the probabilities of a larger class of events. A conditional expectation over a coarser (smaller) &quot;σ&quot;-algebra averages over more events.

==== Conditional probability ====

For a Borel subset in formula_131, one can consider the collection of random variables
:formula_132
It can be shown that they form a Markov kernel, that is, for almost all formula_133,
formula_134 is a probability measure.

The Law of the unconscious statistician is then
:formula_135
This shows that conditional expectations are, like their unconditional counterparts, integrations,
against a conditional measure.

=== General Definition ===
In full generality, consider:
* A probability space formula_136.
* A Banach space formula_137.
* A Bochner integrable random variable formula_138.
* A sub-&quot;σ&quot;-algebra formula_139.

The conditional expectation of formula_18 given formula_74 is the up to a formula_82-nullset unique and integrable formula_143-valued formula_74-measurable random variable formula_120 satisfying
:formula_146
for all formula_91. 

In this setting the conditional expectation is sometimes also denoted in operator notation as formula_148.

== Basic properties ==
All the following formulas are to be understood in an almost sure sense. The &quot;σ&quot;-algebra formula_74 could be replaced by a random variable formula_150, i.e. formula_151.

* Pulling out independent factors:
** If formula_18 is independent of formula_74, then formula_154.

Let formula_155. Then formula_18 is independent of formula_157, so we get that
:formula_158
Thus the definition of conditional expectation is satisfied by the constant random variable formula_159, as desired. formula_160

** If formula_18 is independent of formula_162, then formula_163. Note that this is not necessarily the case if formula_18 is only independent of formula_74 and of formula_19.
** If formula_167 are independent, formula_168 are independent, formula_18 is independent of formula_74 and formula_19 is independent of formula_172, then formula_173.
* Stability:
** If formula_18 is formula_74-measurable, then formula_176.

For each formula_177 we have formula_178, or equivalently
:formula_179
Since this is true for each formula_91, and both formula_129 and formula_18 are formula_74-measurable (the former property holds by definition; the latter property is key here), from this one can show
:formula_184
And this implies formula_185 almost everywhere. formula_160

** In particular, for sub-&quot;σ&quot;-algebras formula_187 we have formula_188. (Note this is different from the tower property below.)
** If &quot;Z&quot; is a random variable, then formula_189. In its simplest form, this says formula_190.
* Pulling out known factors:
** If formula_18 is formula_74-measurable, then formula_193.
All random variables here are assumed without loss of generality to be non-negative. The general case can be treated with formula_194.

Fix formula_195 and let formula_196. Then for any formula_91
:formula_198
Hence formula_199 almost everywhere. 

Any simple function is a finite linear combination of indicator functions. By linearity the above property holds for simple functions: if formula_200 is a simple function then formula_201.

Now let formula_18 be formula_74-measurable. Then there exists a sequence of simple functions formula_204 converging monotonically (here meaning formula_205) and pointwise to formula_18. Consequently, for formula_207, the sequence formula_208 converges monotonically and pointwise to formula_209. 

Also, since formula_210, the sequence formula_211 converges monotonically and pointwise to formula_212

Combining the special case proved for simple functions, the definition of conditional expectation, and deploying the monotone convergence theorem:
:formula_213

This holds for all formula_177, whence formula_215 almost everywhere. formula_160

** If &quot;Z&quot; is a random variable, then formula_217.
* Law of total expectation: formula_218.
* Tower property:
** For sub-&quot;σ&quot;-algebras formula_187 we have formula_220.
*** A special case formula_221 recovers the Law of total expectation: formula_222.
*** A special case is when &quot;Z&quot; is a formula_74-measurable random variable. Then formula_224 and thus formula_225.
*** Doob martingale property: the above with formula_226 (which is formula_74-measurable), and using also formula_190, gives formula_229.
** For random variables formula_167 we have formula_231.
** For random variables formula_232 we have formula_233.
* Linearity: we have formula_234 and formula_235 for formula_236.
* Positivity: If formula_237 then formula_238.
* Monotonicity: If formula_239 then formula_240.
* Monotone convergence: If formula_241 then formula_242.
* Dominated convergence: If formula_243 and formula_244 with formula_245, then formula_246.
* Fatou&#x27;s lemma: If formula_247 then formula_248.
* Jensen&#x27;s inequality: If formula_249 is a convex function, then formula_250.
* Conditional variance: Using the conditional expectation we can define, by analogy with the definition of the variance as the mean square deviation from the average, the conditional variance
** Definition: formula_251
**Algebraic formula for the variance: formula_252
** Law of total variance: formula_253.
* Martingale convergence: For a random variable formula_18, that has finite expectation, we have formula_255, if either formula_256 is an increasing series of sub-&quot;σ&quot;-algebras and formula_257 or if formula_258 is a decreasing series of sub-&quot;σ&quot;-algebras and formula_259.
* Conditional expectation as formula_30-projection: If formula_167 are in the Hilbert space of square-integrable real random variables (real random variables with finite second moment) then
** for formula_74-measurable formula_19, we have formula_264, i.e. the conditional expectation formula_129 is in the sense of the &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;P&quot;) scalar product the orthogonal projection from formula_18 to the linear subspace of formula_74-measurable functions. (This allows to define and prove the existence of the conditional expectation based on the Hilbert projection theorem.)
** the mapping formula_268 is self-adjoint: formula_269
* Conditioning is a contractive projection of &quot;L&quot;p spaces formula_270. I.e., formula_271 for any &quot;p&quot; ≥ 1.
* Doob&#x27;s conditional independence property: If formula_167 are conditionally independent given formula_150, then formula_274 (equivalently, formula_275).

<text>The 100 Classrooms program was a joint project by Deutsche Welle and Cap Anamur to build and restore classrooms in Afghanistan after the U.S. invasion of 2001. Beginning June 13, 2003, the program helped to build nearly 300 classrooms and 32 schools.

Schools were built in Novobad, Jamchi, Yanqiqala, Laclacond, Sardcomar and Baharak. Classrooms were approximately 40 square meters, meant to accommodate 30 to 40 students. Local leaders were required to agree that the schools be open to both boys and girls, that recreation areas would be co-ed, and that teachers would be paid by the local communities.

The project was funded by donations from around the world, totaling more than €380,000.

<doc id="435103" wikidata="Q319038" url="?curid=435103" title="Hoshea">
<text>Hoshea (, &quot;Hōšēaʿ&quot;, &quot;salvation&quot;; &quot;A&#x27;úsiʾ&quot; [&quot;a-ú-si-ʾ&quot;]; ) was the nineteenth and last king of the northern Kingdom of Israel (or a puppet king) and son of Elah (not the Israelite king Elah). William F. Albright dated his reign to , while E. R. Thiele offered the dates 732–723 BCE. 

Hoshea, a trusted advisor and companion to King Pekah of Israel, seized power during a time of great turmoil. As the Assyrian Empire invaded Israel&#x27;s eastern territories, Pekah&#x27;s grip on the throne began to slip.

Sensing an opportunity, Hoshea conspired against his master. In the 20th year of Pekah&#x27;s reign, Hoshea struck, assassinating the king during a battle against the Assyrians and the children of the east.

The Assyrian king, Tiglath-Pileser III, took advantage of Israel&#x27;s weakened state and installed Hoshea as the new king. However, Hoshea&#x27;s reign was short-lived, and he soon found himself at the mercy of the Assyrians.

Despite paying tribute to the Assyrian Empire, Hoshea eventually stopped making payments, hoping to assert his independence. This decision proved disastrous. The Assyrian king, Shalmaneser V, laid siege to Samaria, the capital of Israel, and after a three-year siege, the city fell in 722 BCE.

The Assyrians then deported many of the Israelites to other parts of their empire, marking the end of the Kingdom of Israel. Hoshea&#x27;s rebellion had ultimately led to the downfall of his kingdom.

==Reign==
===Accession===
Assyrian records confirm the Biblical account of how he became king. Under Ahaz, Judah had rendered allegiance to Tiglath-Pileser III of Assyria, when the Northern Kingdom under Pekah, in league with Rezin of Aram-Damascus, had attempted to coerce the Judean king into joint action against Assyria. Hoshea, a captain in Pekah&#x27;s own army, placed himself at the head of the Assyrian party in Samaria; he then removed Pekah by assassination; Tiglath-pileser rewarded Hoshea by making him king over Ephraim (a name used here for the entire northern kingdom), which had been reduced to smaller dimensions. An undated inscription of Tiglath-Pileser III boasts of making Hoshea king after his predecessor had been overthrown:
The amount of tribute exacted from Hoshea is not stated in Scripture, but Menahem, about ten years previously (743 or 742 BCE) was required to pay 1,000 talents of silver to Tiglath-Pileser in order to &quot;strengthen his hold on the kingdom&quot; (), apparently against Menahem&#x27;s rival Pekah. 

So long as Tiglath-pileser was on the throne Hoshea remained loyal; but when Shalmaneser V succeeded, Hoshea made an effort to regain his independence and entered into negotiations with So, King of Egypt. Probably misled by favorable promises on the part of Egypt, Hoshea discontinued paying tribute. Winckler contends that in this anti-Assyrian movement, in which Tyre also had a share, a last effort was made on the part of the Arabic commercial states to shut out Assyria from the Arabo-Indian commerce, for which possession of the Mediterranean ports was of vital importance. 

Shalmaneser soon interpreted this as rebellious, and directed his armies against Samaria. The Assyrian Eponym Canon shows that Shalmaneser campaigned &quot;against&quot; (somewhere, name missing) in the years 727, 726, and 725 BCE, and it is presumed that the missing name was Samaria. The Babylonian Chronicle states that Shalmaneser ravaged the city of Sha-ma-ra-in (Samaria). Additional evidence that it was Shalmaneser, not Sargon II who initially captured Samaria, despite the latter&#x27;s claim, late in his reign, that he was its conqueror, was presented by Tadmor, who showed that Sargon had no campaigns in the west in his first two years of reign (722 and 721 BCE). Therefore 722 is the last possible date for the fall of Samaria, after a siege of 3 years the Bible gives (), and 724 is the earliest date.

===End of reign===
It is likely that Hoshea, disappointed by the lack of Egyptian support, endeavored to avert the calamity by resuming the payment of tribute, but that, distrusted, he was forced to fight and was taken prisoner in battle. Though deprived of its ruler, the capital mounted an effective defense. However, the Assyrians captured Samaria after a siege of three years. Shalmaneser V died shortly after the city fell, and the Assyrian army was recalled to assure the succession of Sargon II. The land of Israel—which had resisted the Assyrians for years without a king—again revolted. Sargon II returned with the Assyrian army in 720 BCE and conquered the kingdom, deporting its citizens beyond the Euphrates (some 27,290 according to the inscription of Sargon II), and settling people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath and Sepharvaim in their place (2 Kings 17:6, 24). According to the &quot;Books of Kings&quot;, this destruction occurred &quot;because the children of Israel sinned against the Lord&quot; (). What happened to Hoshea following the end of the Kingdom of Israel, and when or where he died after his capture by Sargon II, is unknown. The Rabbis explain the description of Hoshea &quot;And he did what was evil in the eyes of the L‑rd, though not like the kings of Israel who had preceded him.&quot; because he had removed the blockade which had stood for hundreds of years on the road to Jerusalem, finally giving the Israelites the choice of either serving G‑d in the Holy Temple or continuing to practice idolatry; Nevertheless, although the sentries were removed, the Jews continued in their idolatrous ways and did not go up to the Holy Temple in Jerusalem; this happened three years before Samaria fell.

==Seal of Hoshea&#x27;s servant==
In the mid-1990s, an unprovenanced bulla appeared on the antiquities market. The seal has been dated by André Lemaire to the second half of the 8th century BCE on paleographic grounds, and its inscription reads &quot;Belonging to Abdi, servant of Hoshea&quot;. If authentic, it is perhaps the only archaeological attestation of Hoshea in an Israelite inscription found to date.

<text>Interstate 295 (I-295), an auxiliary route of I-95, is a beltway around central Jacksonville, Florida, United States. The beltway consists of two segments, the West Beltway (formerly signed as simply I-295) and the East Beltway (formerly signed as State Road 9A SR 9A]), with I-95 serving as the dividing line between the two. The entire highway carries a hidden designation as SR 9A by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). The West Beltway was constructed in the 1970s, with the East Beltway being built from the 1980s to the 2000s.

==Route description==

Beginning at the I-95 interchange in southeastern Duval as the West Beltway, the beltway travels west, passes through the Mandarin area with interchanges at Old St. Augustine Road, and SR 13 (San Jose Boulevard). It then travels along the Buckman Bridge crossing the St. Johns River immediately south of Naval Air Station Jacksonville (NASJAX) and serves as a major connection in the southern part of Jacksonville. At the western end of the river, I-295 continues west, serving as the border between Clay and Duval counties running just north of the town of Orange Park with interchanges at US Route 17 (US 17)/SR 15 (Roosevelt Boulevard) and SR 21 (Blanding Boulevard), serving NASJAX and Clay County. Before turning north through the Westside of Duval County, the freeway also has a full interchange at east–west connector Collins Road to serve the Argyle and Oak Leaf areas in addition to NASJAX. Continuing north, with full interchanges at SR 134 (103rd Street), SR 208 (Wilson Boulevard), and SR 228 (Normandy Boulevard), I-295, the west half of Jacksonville&#x27;s Beltway reaches its interchange with I-10 approximately west of Downtown, then crosses over US 90 (Beaver Street), a railroad, and a creek, and then continues into Northern Duval.

North of the I-10 interchange, the western beltway loops around the northwest side of Jacksonville with full interchanges located at both Commonwealth Avenue and Pritchard Road, before curving northeast to an interchange at US 1/US 23 (New Kings Road). The road then crosses the Trout River before crossing SR 104 (Dunn Avenue), where this northern portion of the loop turns east, with interchanges at SR 115 (Lem Turner Road), SR 243 (International Airport Boulevard)/Duval Road, and I-95, all just south of Jacksonville International Airport, where the East Beltway begins.
East of the I-95 interchange near the airport, I-295 continues east as the East Beltway, with the next interchange being US 17 (North Main Street). I-295 starts to curve to the southeast, with interchanges at Pulaski Road and Alta Drive/Yellowbluff Road. Before orienting itself southward at the SR 105 (Zoo Parkway/Heckscher Drive) area, the freeway crosses the Dames Point Bridge over the St. Johns River into the Fort Caroline area. Just south of the bridge, a partial interchange with SR 113 (Southside Connector) in the Regency area is followed by full interchanges with Merrill and Monument roads, providing access through Arlington between Jacksonville University and Naval Station Mayport. Continuing south, it has full interchanges with SR 10 (Atlantic Boulevard), St. Johns Bluff Road, US 90/SR 212 (Beach Boulevard) and Town Center Parkway/University of North Florida Drive access to the University of North Florida. The next interchange, SR 202 (J. Turner Butler Boulevard), is a freeway to freeway turbine interchange, finished in 2008. After interchanges with Gate Parkway and SR 152 (Baymeadows Road) and a partial interchange with SR 9B (future I-795), I-295 curves to the west, it crosses US 1 (Philips Highway) before completing the loop at I-95 in south Jacksonville.

The northern part of the I-295 loop, from Commonwealth Avenue just north of I-10 in the west to Town Center Parkway just north of J. Turner Butler Boulevard (SR 202) in the east consists of two general purpose lanes in each direction (with the exception of the Dames Point bridge which contains three lanes in each direction). The southern part of the loop consists of three general purpose lanes (except for the Buckman bridge which contains four lanes in each direction), plus two express toll lanes in each direction between I-95 and the Buckman bridge as well as between J. Turner Butler Boulevard (SR 202) and I-795/SR 9B. The Blanding Boulevard/Collins Road interchange complex also includes a collector–distributor system.

==History==

The current version of I-295 appeared on maps in 1967, as a loop around central Jacksonville, with the first section between I-95 in south Duval County to SR 134 (exit 16) in 1970, and the section from SR 134 to I-10 opened in 1973. The section from I-10 to Commonwealth Avenue (exit 22) opened in 1975, followed by the extension to I-95 in north Jacksonville in 1977, completing the western section of the loop.
The eastern section, formerly signed as SR 9A, had its first section open from I-95 in north Jacksonville to US 17 (exit 36) in 1983. The eastern half of the loop was constructed initially as a super-two highway with traffic lights in the late 1980s and was not up to Interstate Highway standards. The Dames Point Bridge was signed as I-295 in 1990, but this designation was removed in 1993 and replaced by SR 9A. The final sections of SR 9A were completed in 2006, creating a complete loop around central Jacksonville. Several sections not under Interstate compliance were upgraded, and the route was considered interstate ready in 2009.

The I-295 East Beltway (formerly signed as SR 9A) was designated the &quot;Ronald Reagan Memorial Highway&quot; in an FDOT ceremony on August 27, 2009. After the Federal Highway Administration accepted the road as the eastern loop of I-295 in 2010, the state was no longer able to name the highway.

Improvements to the I-95 interchange north close by the airport were under construction, new lanes and a flyover ramp were constructed to help improve the interchange. This was completed in late September 2010.

On December 4, 2011, the two halves of the Jacksonville beltway changed over to their current designations: the West Beltway (formerly the whole of I-295) and the East Beltway (formerly SR 9A). The East Beltway was officially given the I-295 designation, making the entire beltway I-295, and SR 9A remained the hidden designation for the entire beltway for FDOT purposes.

In February 2011, construction began for a new interchange at Collins Road, just west of the congested Blanding Boulevard exit. The $63.4-million (equivalent to $ in ) project was completed in December 2013, earlier than the originally projected 2014 date.

On May 18, 2019, two express toll lanes in each direction stretching from the Buckman Bridge near exit 5 at San Jose Boulevard (SR 13) to I-95 (exit 61) at the southern end of Jacksonville opened after several years of construction.

On April 9, 2022, two express lanes in each direction stretching from I-795/SR 9B (exit 58) to J. Turner Butler Boulevard (SR 202, exit 53) at the southeastern end of Jacksonville opened to traffic.

=== Interstate 795 (SR 9B) ===

Extending from the southeast corner of the loop is I-795, currently signed as SR 9B, an approximately expressway connecting to I-95 and proceeding southward into St. Johns County. In May 2008, the SR 9B project was originally suspended by FDOT. The project was reinstated in 2009, and construction of Phase 1 began in June 2010 and opened on September 19, 2013. Construction of Phase 2, which extends SR 9B from US 1 to I-95, started in May 2013 and opened on June 13, 2016. Construction of Phase 3 extending south of I-95 to County Road 2209 (CR 2209) and Race Track Road via a connector road in St. Johns County began on September 8, 2015, and completed on August 8, 2018. I-795 signage along the route has yet to occur.

===1992 attacks===
In 1992, a series of sniper shootings and concrete block- and brick-throwing attacks occurred on the West Beltway. Of the 36 confirmed attacks, &quot;5 [were] shootings from moving vehicles, 15 shootings from overpasses or the side of the road, 15 cases in which concrete, bricks or rocks were thrown at vehicles and 1 instance in which shooting and concrete-throwing were combined&quot;. At least one motorist, William Klinedinst, died after a concrete block landed on the hood of his moving car, causing it to crash; his body was not identified for several weeks. Another motorist, Debra Lewis, received a bullet wound to the face, and several other injuries occurred. The incidents spurred Governor Lawton Chiles to dispatch the Florida National Guard to patrol the roadway and the American Automobile Association (AAA) to issue a rare travel warning for the Interstate and direct its customers to avoid its use. A taskforce was set up by the Jacksonville Sheriff&#x27;s Office to investigate the incidents, and, though charges were filed, they were eventually dropped. The taskforce was disbanded at the end of 1992, and the incidents remained unsolved to this day.

==Future==
, FDOT is conducting a study on widening the section between the Dames Point Bridge and J. Turner Butler Boulevard (SR 202).

<text>Mtskheta ( ) is a city in the region of Mtskheta-Mtianeti, Georgia. It is one of the oldest cities in Georgia as well as one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It is located approximately north of Tbilisi, at the confluence of the Kura and Aragvi rivers. Currently a small provincial capital, for nearly a millennium until the 5th century AD, Mtskheta was a large fortified city and a significant economic and political center of the Kingdom of Iberia.

Due to the historical significance of the town and its several outstanding churches and cultural monuments, the &quot;Historical Monuments of Mtskheta&quot; became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. As the birthplace and one of the most vibrant centers of Christianity in Georgia, Mtskheta was declared the &quot;Holy City&quot; by the Georgian Orthodox Church in 2014.

In 2016, the Historical Monuments of Mtskheta were placed by UNESCO under Enhanced Protection, a mechanism established by the 1999 Second Protocol to the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.

==Geography==
Mtskheta is set on a lowland, surrounded by mountains, at the confluence of the two rivers, Kura and Aragvi. The city is approached from the north by the Greater Caucasus and from the south by the Lesser Caucasus mountains.

==History==


===Foundation===
Archeological evidences trace human settlement in the area of Mtskheta from 2nd millennium BC to early 1st millennium AD. Numerous burials of the Bronze Age (beginning of the 1st millennium BC) prove that Mtskheta already was a significant settlement at that period.

According to &quot;The Georgian Chronicles&quot;, Mtskheta was founded by Mtskhetos, the son of Kartlos, eponymous ancestor of the Georgians. The wall around the city was built by Nimrod&#x27;s ancestor Ardam. By another version, more accepted by historians, Mtskheta was founded by the ancient Meschian tribes in the 5th century BC.

===Capital of the Kingdom of Iberia===
Mtskheta was the capital of the early Georgian Kingdom of Iberia from the 3rd century BC to the 5th century AD. The chronicles mention that the Kingdom of Iberia and its capital were conquered by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BC, but certain historians do not accept this. Eventually, the ruler appointed by Alexander ruined the walls of Mtskheta and left only four fortresses, one of them known today as Armazi.

Ancient sources of the 4th-3rd centuries BC mention that Mtskheta had a number of neighborhoods. Among them, Armazis-tsikhe, Tzitzamuri, Jvari and others. Like other Georgian towns it was divided into the city proper and the citadel.

Both the excavations and The Georgian Chronicles tell about considerable construction in the Hellenistic period: residential houses, palaces and fortifications. A new wall around Mtskheta was built by the first Georgian king, Parnavaz, in the beginning of the 3rd century BC, and later strengthened by his son Saurmag in the late 3rd - early 2nd century BC. In late 2nd - early 1st century BC, king Parnajom strengthened his relations with Persians and invited Zoroastrian priests to settle in Mtskheta. This probably led to construction of Zoroastrian temples in the city. Meanwhile, no such archeological evidence exists. Again the walls of Mtskheta were improved during the reign of Bartom in the 1st century BC, and later also by Aderki, often identified with Pharasmanes I. The latter king is associated with the appearance of the first Christian communities in Kartli and the arrival of the Holy Tunic to Mtskheta, brought from Jerusalem by local Jews.

The city was strongly fortified at that period. Walls lined both sides of the Mtkvari River, and three forts protected it. The main citadel, Armazi, on Mount Bagineti controlled the entrance from the south and east, Tsitsamuri, at the base of Mount Jvari from the north, and Sarkine from the west.

Mtskheta was a site of early Christian activity resulting in the Christianization of Iberia, where Christianity was proclaimed the state religion in 337. It remains the headquarters of the Georgian Orthodox Church. Around that period Mtskheta was a culturally developed city. A gravestone dated between the late 4th and early 5th centuries, found in Samtavro necropolis, contains an epitaph in Greek, telling about the main architect and archizograph (artist) of Mtskheta Aurelius Acholis.

In the first years after the conversion of Georgia into Christianity, a small wooden church was built in the center of the city, later to become Svetitskhoveli Cathedral. Archeological excavations revealed the remnants of the wooden church within the cathedral. 
By the 5th century AD the small church was no longer satisfying the growing community of the city, and Vakhtang Gorgasali built a large basilica, the greatest church in Georgia dedicated to the Dormition of the Mother of God, Svetitskhoveli, which survived until the 11th century. The first katolikos was elected in the 5th century, and his residence was in Svetotskhoveli, in Mtskheta. By the 11th century, the earlier basilica of Svetitskhoveli was again too small, and Katolikos Melchizedek I built a new church on top of it.

===Middle Ages===
King Dachi of Iberia (early 6th century AD), who was the successor of Vakhtang I of Iberia, moved the capital from Mtskheta to the more easily defensible Tbilisi according to the will left by his father. Afterwards the importance of Mtskheta began to decline, while that of Tbilisi grew. However, Mtskheta continued as the coronation and burial place for most kings of Georgia until the end of the kingdom in the 19th century. Mtskheta suffered tremendous damage during the Umayyad Caliphate&#x27;s defeat of the Khazars between 736 and 739, and again when Timur conquered the area in the 15th century. These attacks reduced the size of the city, and by the time Georgia became part of Russia in 1801, it was little more than a village. However, industrialization improved the economic situation of the city.

===Modern times===
The old city lies at the confluence of the rivers Mtkvari and Aragvi.

In recognition of its role in the Georgian Christian history, Mtskheta was granted the status of a &quot;Holy City&quot; by Catholicos-Patriarch Ilia II of Georgia in accordance with the written testament of his 11th-century predecessor Melchizedek I of Georgia.

==Monuments==

Svetitskhoveli Cathedral (11th century), Samtavro Monastery (4th century) and Jvari Monastery (6th century) in Mtskheta are amongst the most significant monuments of Georgian Christian architecture, and are historically significant in the development of medieval architecture throughout the Caucasus. Of special significance are early inscriptions, which form a valuable reference in the study of the origins of the early Georgian alphabet.. Samtavro necropolis, a burial place north of the monastery, is dated between the middle of the 3rd millennium BC and the 10th century.

In the outskirts of Mtskheta are the ruins of Armaztsikhe fortress (3rd century BC), the Armaztsikhe acropolis (dating to the late 1st century BC), remains of a &quot;Pompey&#x27;s bridge&quot; (according to legends built by Roman legionnaires of Pompey the Great in the 1st century BC), the fragmentary remains of a royal palace (1st–3rd century AD), a nearby tomb of the 1st century AD, and the fortress of Bebris tsikhe (14th century). The Institute of Archaeology, and the garden of Mikheil Mamulashvili are also worthy of note. There is also a monument to sculptor Elena Machabeli.
A mausoleum of rich woman from 1st century AD was recovered near Mtskheta train station. The structure imitates a house with well-processed quadrats and a fronton. The roof was covered with tile. Among the findings inside the mausoleum was a small bronze statue of young man playing flute.

==Threats==
The Historical Monuments of Mtskheta were on UNESCO&#x27;s List of World Heritage in Danger, citing &quot;serious deterioration of the stonework and frescoes&quot; as the main threat to the site&#x27;s long-term preservation. They were removed from the list in 2016.

<text>The Dames Point Bridge (officially the [[Napoleon B. Broward|Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]] Bridge) is a cable-stayed bridge over the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, Florida, United States on the Interstate 295 East Beltway. Construction began in 1985 and was completed in 1989. The main span is , and is high. The bridge was designed by HNTB Corporation and RS&amp;H, Inc. The Massman Construction Company built the bridge.

==Design==
The bridge&#x27;s cables are arranged on multiple vertical planes in a slight modification to the harp (parallel) stay arrangement. Main span cables are paired to anchor into the tower in a vertical plane while side span cables pair up to anchor in a horizontal plane such that four cables anchor in each tower at approximately the same elevation.

==Superlatives==
Until the 2003 completion of the Sidney Lanier Bridge in Brunswick, Georgia, the Dames Point Bridge was the only bridge in the United States to feature the harp stay arrangement.

It remains one of the largest cable-stayed bridges in the United States, with of cable.

==Accident==
On May 15, 1989, while inspectors were checking the bridge for cracks and fissures, the boom arm holding a bucket snapped, leaving the bucket tilted on its side. One worker fell into the river below and the others were at risk of plummeting 145 feet down. The man in the river suffered a dislocated shoulder but was able to swim to safety. Rescuers rappelled down the side of the bridge to the other three workers and successfully brought them all to safety. The story of this rescue effort was aired on &quot;Rescue 911&quot; on September 12 of the same year.

<doc id="435126" wikidata="Q210586" url="?curid=435126" title="String Quartet No. 2 (Beethoven)">
<text>The String Quartet No. 2 in G major, Op. 18, No. 2 (actually his third), was written by Ludwig van Beethoven between 1798 and 1800 and published in 1801, dedicated to Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz.

It consists of four movements:

# Allegro (G major)
# Adagio cantabile – Allegro – Tempo I (C major)
# Scherzo: Allegro (G major) - Trio in C major 
# Allegro molto, quasi presto (G major)

Of the Op. 18 string quartets, this one is the most grounded in 18th-century musical tradition. According to Michael Steinberg, &quot;In German-speaking countries, the graceful curve of the first violin&#x27;s opening phrase has earned the work the nickname of , which might be translated as &#x27;quartet of bows and curtseys&#x27;.&quot;

The nickname may have originated from one of Haydn&#x27;s last string quartets written about the same time (Op. 77, No. 1, Hob. III:81; 1799), which was also known as the &quot;Komplimentier-Quartett&quot;. Haydn was Beethoven&#x27;s teacher at the time, and there are similarities in style between the two quartets. They are also both in the key of G major.

After he finished the quartet, Beethoven was not satisfied with the second movement and wrote a replacement. Sketches of the original slow movement survive and a complete version has been reconstructed by musicologist Barry Cooper. It was performed publicly, possibly for the first time, by the Danel Quartet in the Cosmo Rodewald Concert Hall at the Martin Harris Centre, University of Manchester, on 30 September 2011.

<text>A home birth is a birth that takes place in a residence rather than in a hospital or a birthing center. They may be attended by a midwife, or lay attendant with experience in managing home births. Home birth was, until the advent of modern medicine, the de facto method of delivery. The term was coined in the middle of the 19th century as births began to take place in hospitals.

Multiple studies have been performed concerning the safety of home births for both the child and the mother. Standard practices, licensing requirements and access to emergency hospital care differ between regions making it difficult to compare studies across national borders. A 2014 US survey of medical studies found that perinatal mortality rates were triple that of hospital births, and a US nationwide study of over 13 million births on a 3-year span (2007–2010) found that births at home were roughly 10 times as likely to be stillborn (14 times in first-born babies) and almost four times as likely to have neonatal seizures or serious neurological dysfunction when compared to babies born in hospitals. Alternatively, there is research coming out that suggests that there is actually no significant difference in perinatal mortality rates between home and hospital birth and some even suggest that there are benefits such as less complications and fewer interventions. Higher maternal and infant mortality rates are associated with the inability to offer timely assistance to mothers with emergency procedures in case of complications during labour, as well as with widely varying licensing and training standards for birth attendants between different states and countries.

==Etymology==
The word combination &quot;home birth&quot; arose some time in the middle of the 19th century and coincided with the rise of births that took place in lying-in hospitals. Since women around the world left homes to give birth in clinics and hospitals as the 20th century progressed, the term &quot;home birth&quot; came to refer to giving birth, intentionally or otherwise, in a residence as opposed to a hospital.

==History and philosophy==
Although the fact humans give birth is universal, the social nature of birth is not. Where, with whom, how, and when someone gives birth is socially and culturally determined. Historically, birth has been a social event. For the most of humankind history of birth is equivalent to history of home birth. The hypothesis exists that birth was transformed from a solitary to social event early in human evolution. Traditionally and historically, other women assisted women in childbirth. A special term evolved in the English language around 1300 to name women who made assistance in childbirth their vocation – &quot;&quot;, literally meaning &quot;with woman&quot;. However, midwife was a description of a social role of a woman who was &quot;with woman&quot; in childbirth to mediate social arrangements for woman&#x27;s bodily experience of birth.

== Birthing on country ==
Birthing on country is a traditional birthing practice that constitutes giving birth on the land where the mother was born as well as her ancestors. It is a culturally appropriate practice that coincides with spiritual tradition. It offers support to women and their families by continuing the birthing process in the community among the women and children. It is largely practiced by aboriginal women, in countries such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. The belief is that if a child is not born on country they lose their connection to the land and their community.

Birthing on country can happen in rural areas as well as birthing in cities.

=== In the United States ===
There was an increase in the percentage of home births from 2004 to 2009. Since 2009, Montana had the largest increase when it comes to home births with a percentage of 2.55 percent. Oregon and Vermont was close together when it comes to home births with percentages of 1.96 percent and 1.91 percent. The other five additional states which are Idaho, Pennsylvania, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin, they all had an increase of home births with a percent of 1.50 and above.

When it comes to the Southeastern states which are Texas, North Carolina, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and West Virginia, they all experienced a lower percentage of home births with only a percentage of 0.50 percent.

Since the percentage of home birth increased from 2004 to 2009, it went to widespread which involved states regions, and countries. While two areas saw significant decreases, 31 states saw rapid increases when it comes to home births. 
=== In Australia ===
In the Northern Territory of Australia, the prescribed steps advocated by the government is that, in rural areas, a woman at 37 weeks gestation must leave &quot;country&quot; and fly to the nearest city. If an adult, she flies alone with no family members. She will wait in accommodations until she goes into labour. After birth she and the baby are flown back to &quot;country&quot;.

==Types==
Home births are either attended or unattended, planned or unplanned. Women are attended when they are assisted through labor and birth by a professional, usually a midwife, and rarely a general practitioner. Women who are unassisted or only attended by a lay person, perhaps a doula, their spouse, family, friend, or a non-professional birth attendant, are sometimes called freebirths. A &quot;planned&quot; home birth is a birth that occurs at home by intention. An &quot;unplanned&quot; home birth is one that occurs at home by necessity but not with intention. Reasons for unplanned home births include inability to travel to the hospital or birthing center due to conditions outside the control of the mother such as weather or road blockages or speed of birth progression.

===Factors===
Many women choose home birth because delivering a baby in familiar surroundings is important to them. Others choose home birth because they dislike a hospital or birthing center environment, do not like a medically centered birthing experience, are concerned about exposing the infant to hospital-borne pathogens, or dislike the presence of strangers at the birth. Others prefer home birth because they feel it is more natural and less stressful. In a study published in the &quot;Journal of Midwifery and Women&#x27;s Health&quot;, women were asked why they chose a home birth; the top five reasons given were safety, avoidance of unnecessary medical interventions common in hospital births, previous negative hospital experiences, more control, and a comfortable and familiar environment. One study found that women experience pain inherent in birth differently, and less negatively, in a home setting.

Cost is also a factor. The estimated average cost of a home birth in the United States in 2021 was $4,650, compared with $13,562 for a vaginal hospital birth. In developing countries, where women may not be able to afford medical care or it may not be accessible to them, a home birth may be the only option available, and the woman may or may not be assisted by a professional attendant of any kind.

Some women may not be able to have a safe birth at home, even with highly trained midwives. There are some medical conditions that can prevent a woman from qualifying for a home birth. These often include heart disease, renal disease, diabetes, preeclampsia, placenta previa, placenta abruption, antepartum hemorrhage after 20 weeks gestation, and active genital herpes. Prior caesarean deliveries can sometimes prevent a woman from qualifying for a home birth, though not always. It is important that a woman and her health care provider discuss the individual health risks prior to planning a home birth.

==Trends==
Home birth was, until the advent of modern medicine, the &quot;de facto&quot; method of delivery. In many developed countries, home birth declined rapidly over the 20th century. In the United States there was a large shift towards hospital births beginning around 1900, when close to 100% of births were at home. Rates of home births fell to 50% in 1938 and to fewer than 1% in 1955. However, between 2004 and 2009, the number of home births in the United States rose by 41%. In the United Kingdom a similar but slower trend happened with approximately 80% of births occurring at home in the 1920s and only 1% in 1991. In Japan the change in birth location happened much later, but much faster: home birth was at 95% in 1950, but only 1.2% in 1975. In countries such as the Netherlands, where home births have been a regular part of the maternity system, the rate for home births is 20% in 2014. Over a similar time period, maternal mortality during childbirth fell during 1900 to 1997 from 6–9 deaths per thousand to 0.077 deaths per thousand, while the infant mortality rate dropped between 1915 and 1997 from around 100 deaths per thousand births to 7.2 deaths per thousand.

One doctor described birth in a working-class home in the 1920s:

This experience is contrasted with a 1920s hospital birth by Adolf Weber:

Midwifery, the practice supporting a natural approach to birth, enjoyed a revival in the United States during the 1970s. Ina May Gaskin, for example, sometimes called &quot;the mother of authentic midwifery&quot; helped open The Farm Midwifery Center in Summertown, Tennessee, in 1971, which is still in operation. A movement termed &#x27;pushing for midwives&#x27; intensified during the 1990s and early 2000s in the United States, when the public organized to request legislation that would formally legalize midwifery a consumable service. However, although there was a steep increase in midwife-attended births between 1975 and 2002 (from less than 1.0% to 8.1%), most of these births occurred in the hospital. The US rate of out-of-hospital birth has remained steady at 1% of all births since 1989, with data from 2007 showing that 27.3% of the home births since 1989 took place in a free-standing birth center and 65.4% in a residence. Hence, the actual rate of home birth in the United States remained low (0.65%) over the twenty years prior to 2007.

Home birth in the United Kingdom has also received some press since 2000. There was a movement, most notably in Wales, to increase home birth rates to 10% by 2007. Between 2005 and 2006, there was an increase of 16% of home birth rates in Wales, but by 2007 the total home birth rate was still 3% even in Wales (double the national rate). A 2001 report noted that there was a wide range of home birth rates in the UK, with some regions around 1% and others over 20%. In Australia, birth at home has fallen steadily over the years and was 0.3% as of 2008, ranging from nearly 1% in the Northern Territory to 0.1% in Queensland. In 2004, the New Zealand rate for births at home was nearly three times Australia&#x27;s with a rate of 2.5% and increasing.

In the Netherlands, the trend has been somewhat different from other industrialized countries: while in 1965, two-thirds of Dutch births took place at home, that figure has dropped to about 20% in 2013, which is still more than in other industrialized countries. Less than 1% of South Korean infants are born at home.

== Research on safety ==

In 2019, a meta-analysis examined perinatal and neonatal mortality of planned home birth among low-risk women in well-resourced countries, with research eligible for inclusion encompassing approximately 500,000 intended home births. The study concluded that the risk of perinatal or neonatal mortality was not different when birth was intended at home or in hospital.

In 2014, a comprehensive review in the &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot; of 12 previously published studies encompassing 500,000 planned home births in low-risk women found that neonatal mortality rates for home births were triple those of hospital births. This finding echoes that of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Due to a greater risk of perinatal death, the college advises women who are postterm (greater than 42 weeks gestation), carrying twins, or have a breech presentation not to attempt home birth. The &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot; review additionally found that several studies concluded that home births had a higher risk of failing Apgar scores in newborns, as well as a delay in diagnosing hypoxia, acidosis and asphyxia. This contradicts a 2007 UK review study by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), a British governmental organization devoted to creating guidelines for coverage throughout the UK, which expressed concern for the lack of quality evidence in studies comparing the potential risks and benefits of home and hospital birthing environments in the UK. Their report noted that intrapartum-related perinatal mortality was low in all settings in the UK, but that in cases of unanticipated obstetric complications, the mortality rate was higher for home births due to the time needed to transfer the mother to an obstetric unit.

A 2002 study of planned home births in the state of Washington found that home births had shorter labors than hospital births. In North America, a 2005 study found that about 12 percent of women intending to give birth at home needed to be transferred to the hospital for reasons such as a difficult labor or pain relief. A 2014 survey of American home births between 2004 and 2010 found the percent of women transferred to a hospital from a planned home birth after beginning labor to be 10.9%.

Both the &quot;Journal of Medical Ethics&quot; and NICE report noted that usage of caesarean sections were lower for women who give birth at home, and both noted a prior study that determined that women who had a planned home birth had greater satisfaction from the experience when compared with women who had a planned birth in a hospital.

In 2009 a study of 500,000 low-risk planned home and hospital births in the Netherlands, where midwives have a strong licensing requirement, was reported in the &quot;British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology&quot;. The study concluded that for low-risk women there was no increase in perinatal mortality, provided that the midwives were well-trained and there was easy and quick access to hospitals. Further, the study noted there was evidence that &quot;low risk women with a planned home birth are less likely to experience referral to secondary care and subsequent obstetric interventions than those with a planned hospital birth.&quot; The study has been criticised on several grounds, including that some data might be missing and that the findings may not be representative of other populations.

In 2012, Oregon performed a study of all births in the state during the year as a part of discussing a bill regarding licensing requirements for midwives in the state. They found that the rate of intrapartum infant mortality was 0.6 deaths per thousand births for planned hospital births, and 4.8 deaths per thousand for planned home births. They further found that the death rate for planned home births attended by direct-entry midwives was 5.6 per thousand. The study noted that the statistics for Oregon were different for other areas, such as British Columbia, which had different licensing requirements. Oregon was noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as having the second-highest rate of home births in the nation in 2009, at 1.96% compared to the national average of 0.72%. A 2014 survey of nearly 17,000 voluntarily reported home births in the United States between 2004 and 2010 found an intrapartum infant mortality rate of 1.30 per thousand; early neonatal and late neonatal mortality rates were a further 0.41 and 0.35 per thousand. The survey excluded congenital anomaly-related deaths, as well as births where the mother was transferred to a hospital prior to beginning labor.

In October 2013 the largest study of this kind was published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology and included data on more than 13 million births in the United States, assessing deliveries by physicians and midwives in and out of the hospital from 2007 to 2010. The study indicated that babies born at home are roughly 10 times as likely to have an Apgar score of 0 after 5 minutes and almost four times as likely to have neonatal seizures or serious neurological dysfunction when compared to babies born in hospitals. The study findings showed that the risk of Apgar scores of 0 is even greater in first-born babies—14 times the risk of hospital births. The study results were confirmed by analyzing birth certificate files from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Center for Health Statistics. Given the study&#x27;s findings, Dr. Amos Grunebaum, professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Weill Cornell Medical College and lead author of the study, stated that the magnitude of risk associated with home delivery is so alarming that necessitates the need for the parents-to-be to know the risk factors. Another author, Dr. Frank Chervenak, added that the study underplayed the risks of home births, as the data used counted home births where the mother was transferred to a hospital during labor as a hospital birth.

A 2022 study, which examined the introduction of maternity wards in Sweden, found that the wards substantially reduced home deliveries and early neonatal mortality, as well as positive long-term effects on labour income, unemployment, health-related disability and schooling for individuals born in maternity wards.

===Study design===
Randomized controlled trials are the &quot;gold standard&quot; of research methodology with respect to applying findings to populations; however, such a study design is not feasible or ethical for location of birth. The studies that do exist, therefore, are cohort studies conducted retrospectively by selecting hospital records and midwife records. by matched pairs (by pairing study participants based on their background characteristics), In February 2011 the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists identified several factors that make quality research on home birth difficult. These include &quot;lack of randomization; reliance on birth certificate data with inherent ascertainment problems; ascertainment of relying on voluntary submission of data or self-reporting; a limited ability to distinguish between planned and unplanned birth; variation in the skill, training, and certification of the birth attendant; and an inability to account for and accurately attribute adverse outcomes associated with transfers&quot;. Quality studies, therefore, need to take steps in their design to mitigate these problems in order to produce meaningful results.

The data available on the safety of home birth in developed countries is often difficult to interpret due to issues such as differing home-birth standards between different countries, and difficult to compare with other studies because of varying definitions of perinatal mortality. Additionally, it is difficult to compare home and hospital births because only the risk profiles are different between the two groups, according to the CDC: people who choose to give birth at home are more likely to be healthy and at low risk for complications. There are also unquantifiable differences in home birth patients, such as maternal attitudes towards medical involvement in birth.

== Methods of scientific inquiry ==
Modern scientific inquiry into home birth takes place in the fields of anthropology, epistemology, ethnology, history, jurisprudence, medicine, midwifery, public health, sociology, and women&#x27;s studies. Research of home birth is complicated by ancient and modern biases about the nature of women and birth, manifested in the language and ideas that are used to refer to women, women&#x27;s bodies, and what women do. It has been demonstrated that reports of research of physiological phenomena, such as conception, transmit deep-seated biased cultural notions of women and women&#x27;s bodies. Most 20th- and 21st-century researchers of home birth view the phenomenon through two broad perspectives that are closely tied to the ideas and perceptions of birth itself – social and biomedical.

==Insurance and licensing issues==

While a woman in developed countries may choose to deliver her child at home, in a birthing center, or at hospital, health coverage and legal issues influence available options.

===Australia===

In April 2007, the Western Australian Government expanded coverage for birth at home across the State. Other state governments in Australia, including the Northern Territory, New South Wales and South Australia, also provide government funding for independent, private home birth.

The 2009 Federal Budget provided additional funds to Medicare to allow more midwives to work as private practitioners, allow midwives to prescribe medication under the Medicare Benefits Schedule, and assist them with medical indemnity insurance. However, this plan only covers hospital births. There are no current plans to extend Medicare and PBS funding to home birth services in Australia.

, all health professionals must show proof of liability insurance.

In March 2016, the Coroners Court of Victoria found against midwife Gaye Demanuel in the case of the death of Caroline Lovell. &quot;Coroner White also called for a review of the regulation of midwives caring for women during home births, and for the government and health authorities to consider an offence banning unregistered health practitioners from taking money for attending home births.&quot;

===Canada===

Public health coverage of home birth services varies in Canada from province to province, as does the availability of doctors and midwives providing home birth services. The Provinces of Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alberta, and Quebec currently cover home birth services.

===United Kingdom===

There are few legal issues with a home birth in the UK. Woman cannot be forced to go to a hospital. The support of the various Health Authorities of the National Health Service may vary, but in general the NHS will cover home births – the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health, Lord Hunt of King&#x27;s Heath has stated that &quot;As I understand it, although the NHS has a legal duty to provide a maternity service, there is not a similar legal duty to provide a home birth service to every woman who requests one. However, I certainly hope that when a woman wants a home birth, and it is clinically appropriate, the NHS will do all it can to support that woman in her choice of a home birth.&quot;

===United States===
27 states license or regulate in some manner direct-entry midwife, or certified professional midwife (CPM). In the other 23 states there are no licensing laws, and practicing midwives can be arrested for practicing medicine without a license. It is legal in all 50 states to hire a certified nurse midwife, or CNM, who are trained nurses, though most CNMs work in hospitals.

<text>The String Quartet No. 3 in D major, Op. 18, No. 3, was written by Ludwig van Beethoven between 1798 and 1800 and published in 1801, dedicated to Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz. Although it is numbered third, it was the first quartet Beethoven composed.

== Analysis ==
It consists of four movements:

# Allegro (D major)
# Andante con motor (B-flat major)
# Scherzo Allegro (D major) - Trio (D minor)
# Presto (D major)

According to Michael Steinberg, this is &quot;the gentlest, most consistently lyrical work [within Beethoven&#x27;s Op. 18]&quot;, except for the fourth movement, in which &quot;Beethoven first explores the idea of shifting the centre of gravity toward the end of a multimovement work&quot;.

The first movement starts with a gentle and unassuming theme:
However, its return at the start of the recapitulation shows the theme in an entirely different light. Philip Radcliffe describes this moment as “beautifully contrived”. Burstein describes the dramatic and unusual harmonic progression at the end of the development section as “breathtaking”.
“The sudden reinterpretation of the C creates a type of tonal crisis which has deep structural ramifications for the entire movement. Beethoven&#x27;s brilliant manner of dealing with the implications of this unusual strategy indicates a debt to his teacher, Haydn, and also reveals much about Beethoven&#x27;s own craft and artistic vision.” The final movement contains a theme that resembles the Mexican hat dance.

<text>Ludwig van Beethoven composed his String Quartet No. 4 in C minor, Op. 18, No. 4, between 1798 and 1800 in Vienna and published in 1801. The Op. 18 collection is dedicated to Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz.

== Overview ==
The Op. 18 collection is sometimes difficult to study historically because the manuscripts no longer exist and much about them is conjecture or guesses. The fourth quartet is unique in the set in that there is no evidence that sketches or drafts of this quartet can be found. He would often draw upon earlier works when looking for inspiration, keeping journals of sketches and notes. For this reason, it may have been the last to have been composed. The piece is also monothematic. The key of the piece, C minor, is the only minor key in the set. This key used in other composition of Beethoven&#x27;s such as Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13 &quot;Sonata Pathetique&quot; and Symphony No. 5 in C Minor, Op. 67. These pieces are similar in their level of intensity and stormy mood, a character which seems to be a partial product of Beethoven&#x27;s use of C minor in compositions.

== Movements ==
As with all of the Op. 18 quartets, the String Quartet No. 4 follows the four-movement format. The second movement is a fugal scherzo rather than the more typical slow movement.

=== I. Allegro ma non tanto (C minor) ===
The movement is in sonata form. It begins softly, but urgently, with ostinato eighth notes in the cello, while the first violin climbs ever higher through a series of leaps. This first subject culminates as the transition takes over in m. 13 with alternating tonic and dominant chords between the first violin and the other three instruments. The second subject is delayed, but enters at m. 33. It expands on the same rhythmic figure present in mm. 5-7. The development starts at m. 76. The recapitulation is from mm. 136-202 followed by a coda starting in m. 202. The first movement contains one clear relationship to another piece by Beethoven, his &quot; for viola and cello.

=== II. Andante scherzoso quasi allegretto (C major) ===
This movement replaces what would normally be slow movement in traditional classical movement structure with a scherzo fugue. Like the first movement, it is in sonata form. In the beginning of the movement the second violin begins the piece, followed by the viola in m. 6, the first violin in m. 10, and the cello in m. 13. The first subject is from mm. 1-42, but is divided into two sections. In m. 33, a transition takes place until m. 42, where the second subject begins. M. 83 marks the beginning of the development section which begins with more fugal motives before transitioning into a chordal, then a fugal chordal section, and finally a recapitulation is reached at m. 147. This movement showcases Beethoven composition skills through the use of counterpoint and polyphony.

=== III. Menuetto: Allegretto (C minor) - Trio (E-flat major) ===
This movement is a minuet trio. In contrast with more delicate minuets of the era, this one is more serious in nature. The sforzandos placed on the 16th note of the dotted figure gives the open an almost unbalanced or off-kilter feeling. The trio is distinctive for its reversing of primary voices. The first violin plays a more accompanimental role of constant triplet eighth notes while the second violin and viola trade the melody in a call-and-response motive.

=== IV. Allegro – Prestissimo (C minor) ===
This movement is in rondo form. The principal subject lasts through the first 16 measures. There is a fermata in m. 12 preceded by a leap approached in contrary motion by the first violin and viola that presents itself as a question-like gesture that is then answered with a phrase similar to the opening consequent, ending on a unison C by means of a cadence. This resolution, with its absence of a third leads to slight ambiguity in key, which is taken advantage of later in the piece. The attempted modulation from C minor to C major is a constant source of development, only reaching its full climax in the prestissimo coda from m. 163 to the end.

<text>The Timex Sinclair 1000 (or T/S 1000) was the first computer produced by Timex Sinclair, a joint venture between Timex Corporation and Sinclair Research. It was launched in July 1982, with a US sales price of US$99.95, making it the cheapest home computer at the time; it was advertised as &quot;the first computer under $100&quot;. The computer was aimed at regular home users. As purchased, the T/S 1000 was fully assembled and ready to be plugged into home televisions, which served as a video monitor. The T/S 1000 was a slightly modified version of the Sinclair ZX81 with an NTSC RF modulator, for use with North American TVs, instead of PAL for European TVs. The T/S 1000 doubled the onboard RAM from 1 KB to 2 KB; further expandable by 16 KB through the cartridge port. The T/S 1000&#x27;s casing had slightly more internal shielding but remained the same as Sinclair&#x27;s, including the membrane keyboard, which had modified nomenclature to suit American tastes (e.g. &quot;DELETE&quot; instead of &quot;RUBOUT&quot;) Just like the ZX81, the T/S 1000 had black-and-white graphics and no sound.

It was followed in 1983 by an improved version, the Timex Sinclair 1500 (or T/S 1500) which incorporated the 16 KB RAM expansion and featured a lower price (US$80). However, the T/S 1500 did not achieve market success, given that by this time the marketplace was dominated by Commodore, Radio Shack, Atari and Apple.

==History==
Timex claimed to have sold 600,000 T/S 1000s in the US by early 1983, and other companies imported localized versions of British software. It sold for in the US when it debuted, making it the cheapest home computer at the time; it was advertised as &quot;the first computer under $100&quot;. This pricing initiated a price war with Commodore International, who quickly reduced the price of its VIC-20 to match and later announced a trade-in program offering $100 for any competing computer toward the purchase of a Commodore 64. Since the T/S 1000 was selling for $49 by this time, many customers bought them for the sole purpose of trading them in for a Commodore 64.

Like the Sinclair ZX81, the T/S 1000 used &quot;8K BASIC&quot;, a version of Sinclair BASIC (a BASIC dialect), as its primary interface and programming language. To make the membrane keyboard-less cumbersome for program entry, the T/S 1000 used a shortcut system of one-letter &quot;keywords&quot; for most commands (e.g., pressing while the cursor was in &quot;keyword mode&quot; would generate the keyword codice_1). Some keywords required a short sequence of keystrokes (e.g., + would generate the keyword codice_2). One notable thing about this version of BASIC was that, unlike other versions where it&#x27;s optional in a program, the codice_3 command was used extensively for data.

The T/S 1000 was normally plugged into a regular TV that served as a computer monitor. The computer produced a black-and-white display that consisted of 32 columns and 24 lines. Of those lines, 22 were accessible for display, with two reserved for data entry and error messages. The limited graphics were based on geometric shapes contained within the operating system&#x27;s non-ASCII character set. The only form of long-term storage was Compact Cassette. The 16 KB memory expansion module sold for $49.95. A shortage of the memory expansion modules coupled with a lack of software that would run within 2 KB meant that the system had little use for anything other than as an introduction to programming. Home computer magazines of the era such as &quot;Compute!&quot; showed enthusiasts how to interface the computer with various kinds of equipment. These tutorials provided an opportunity to learn about early speech synthesis technology through a Speak &amp; Spell, robotics control through the memory port, and scrolling text displays for advertising.

Over time, the T/S 1000 spawned a cottage industry of third-party add-ons designed to help remedy its limitations and provide more functions. Full-size keyboards, speech synthesizers, sound generators, disk drives, and memory expansions (up to 64 KB) were a few of the options available. Languages such as Forth and Pascal, as well as BASIC compilers and assemblers, augmented the T/S 1000&#x27;s programming possibilities. Computer enthusiast magazines from the early 1980s included articles that contained programming instructions for simple games and other programs that could be used with the device. &quot;Microcomputing&quot; magazine published an article in April 1983, criticizing the membrane keyboard (&quot;The designers of the Timex-Sinclair 1000 ... reduced this important programming tool to a fraction of the required size&quot;) and describing how to connect external full-size keyboards.

Magazines dedicated to Timex Sinclair machines were published in the US, like SYNC (from 1981 to 1984) and &quot;Timex Sinclair User&quot; (1983), and dozens of fanzines and group newsletters also existed.

==Peripherals==
Timex Computer Corporation produced a cartridge interface for the T/S 1000, the Timex Sinclair 1510 Command Cartridge Player. Only four cartridge titles were ever released:

* 07-9001 Supermath
* 07-9002 States and Capitals
* 07-9003 Chess
* 07-9004 Flight Simulator (Required the 16K RAM pack) The program took 12 minutes to load.

The TS1510 can be used with a T/S 1000 and a 16 KB RAM pack (an additional RAM pack). Users could also load programs using a tape recorder and compact cassettes.

Timex released a thermal printer for use with the T/S 1000. The printer retailed for $100.00.

==Timex Sinclair 1500 ==
The T/S 1500 was an upgraded T/S 1000 with a better keyboard and 16 KB RAM, introduced in 1983. Timex Sinclair (TMX Portugal) designed the T/S 1500 and offered it to the Timex Corporation. The design utilized the T/S 2000 prototype (ZX Spectrum-like) silver cases that weren&#x27;t previously used because of the launch of the T/S 2068. 

The machine was sold in the United States, Canada and Portugal. It replaced the earlier machine&#x27;s ZX81-like case with a silver ZX Spectrum-like case, the same ZX Spectrum rubber keyboard, and a custom ULA. 

The T/S 1500 did not incorporate the Ferranti ULA. The T/S 1500 used a standard television for its display, &quot;broadcasting&quot; on either channel 2 or 3. It defaulted to TV channel 2, but if was pressed on the keyboard within a few seconds of turning the computer on, it changed to channel 3 instead. 

Although the T/S 1500 came with 16 KB internal RAM, an external 16 KB RAM pack could be added for a total of 32 KB RAM. A few keyboard commands (codice_4) were required for the system to recognize the additional memory space (the RAM pack is multiplexed to the start of the RAM).

The T/S 1500 sold for $80 and was not a commercial success because of its late launch long after the success of the T/S 1000. The T/S 1000&#x27;s successor, the T/S 2068, was already available.
===Bugs===
There are two little-known software differences between the T/S 1000 and T/S 1500.

On the T/S 1000 and ZX81, the command:

 LPRINT 0.00001

results in the Timex printer outputting codice_5. This well-known fault was corrected on the T/S 1500.

The T/S 1000 runs the following loop correctly, but the T/S 1500 does not; it makes one fewer iteration than it should.

10 FOR I=0 TO 1 STEP 0.25
20 PRINT I
30 NEXT I

<text>The String Quartet No. 6 in B-flat major, Op. 18, No. 6, was written between 1798 and 1800 by Ludwig van Beethoven and published in 1801, and dedicated to Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz.

==Movements==

The quartet is in four movements:

#Allegro con brio
#Adagio ma non troppo (E-flat major)
#Scherzo: Allegro - Trio
#&quot;La Malinconia&quot;: Adagio – Allegretto quasi Allegro - Adagio - Allegretto - Un Poco adagio - prestissimo
This work begins with a sonata form. The first theme starts in B♭ with a conversation between the first violin and the cello. After a little bit of back and forth, the second violin takes over the conversation from the cello. Then the piece modulates to the dominant of F major and then F minor for the second theme. After a repeat of the first and second themes, the development section starts in F major. It then shifts to D major and on to G minor and eventually returns to F major before shifting to B♭ for the recapitulation. This time around the second theme stays in B♭.
The second movement is in E major and starts with the first violin playing a lyrical melody in time. The mood shifts with the move to a minor key and unexpected accents and silences. The viola and cello interject with an odd motif marked &quot;queste note ben marcato&quot;.

The Scherzo returns to B major and is a &quot;tour de force of syncopation&quot; and &quot;an explosion of rhythmic eccentricity&quot;. &quot;It depends on rhythmic effects of 3 x 2 as against 2 x 3 within the 6 eight-notes to the bar in a moderate 3/4 meter.&quot;

The fourth movement is the crux of the piece and possibly the highlight of Op. 18. It is marked &quot;Questo pezzo si deve trattare colla più gran delicatezza&quot; (&quot;This piece is to be played with the greatest delicacy&quot;.). The first section, in time is marked Adagio and on one reading matches the &quot;Melancholy&quot; of the title. The second section marked &quot;Allegretto quasi allegro&quot; is in time and is more sanguine. It is a fast and simple evocation of a Viennese ballroom or German country dance. This proceeds in contrast to the first section but eventually grinds to a halt on a fortissimo diminished chord. There follows a brief return of section 1 (10 bars) followed by a briefer return of section 2 (5 bars) (in a minor) followed by an ever briefer return of section 1 (only 2 bars). This is followed by section 3, which is really a lengthier return of section 2, which starts in G and moves back to B. A similar procedure can be found in Beethoven&#x27;s piano concerto Op. 19 in the same key. In the last movement, the A section returns in G major rather than B and modulates back to B via the same chord progression as in this quartet. Also, the main themes of the movements share the same initial pulse (short note on the first beat followed by a longer accentuated note on the second beat in a triple metre).
