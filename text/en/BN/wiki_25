<text>Dae Mu-ye, also known as King Mu () (r. 719–737), was the second king of the Balhae. He is noted for the military expansion of his domain.

== Background ==
Dae Mu-ye was the eldest son of Dae Jo-yeong, the founder of the ancient kingdom of Balhae, He ascended to the throne after the death in 719 of his father. He was given the title of &quot;King of the Gyeru Province&quot; by Tang Emperor Xuanzong. He gave the posthumous title King Go to his father, Dae Jo-yeong. Since then, He declared the era name &quot;In-an&quot;, an act of independence from China&#x27;s Tang dynasty. On the other hand, he frequently sent embassies to the Tang, including his sons and brothers.

== Reign ==
Balhae&#x27;s aggressive expansion triggered frictions with Tang China, Silla of southern Korea, the Khitans, the Xi, the Göktürks, and several Mohe tribes. When the Heishui Mohe in the north of Balhae came under the direct control of the Tang in 727, he attacked the Heishui Mohe fearing a pincer attack.

732, King Mu ordered a punitive expedition against Tang in present-day Shandong, sending the Balhae navy at the command of Jang Mun-hyu. In the same year, he led troops to Madushan (馬都山) in the vicinity of Shanhaiguan and occupied nearby towns. In 733, Chinese Emperor Xuanzong ordered Dae Mun-ye to attack Balhae, along with forces from Silla, but the attack was unsuccessful and they were repelled.

In 727, Balhae began to dispatch embassies to Japan to avoid international isolation. The king sent an official document to Japan indicating that Balhae recovered the terrain of Goguryeo and succeeded to the culture of Buyeo. Japan, whose relationship with Silla was strained, welcomed them as a revival of Goguryeo.

In 732, He made an assault on Tang empire&#x27;s Dengzhou. During the assault, the local governor of Dengzhou Wei Jun was killed. The assault was mostly an act of piracy and did not elevate to an international conflict until Wei&#x27;s death. Later, Tang, allied with Silla, invaded Balhae but the advance of the allied troops was deterred by heavy snow.

Dae Muye was succeeded by his son Dae Heummu in 737.

<text>The zucchini (; : &quot;zucchini&quot; or &quot;zucchinis&quot;), courgette () or baby marrow (&quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot;) is a summer squash, a vining herbaceous plant whose fruit are harvested when their immature seeds and epicarp (rind) are still soft and edible. It is closely related, but not identical, to the marrow; its fruit may be called &quot;marrow&quot; when mature.

Ordinary zucchini fruit are any shade of green, though the golden zucchini is a deep yellow or orange. At maturity, they can grow to nearly in length, but they are normally harvested at about .

In botany, the zucchini&#x27;s fruit is a pepo, a berry (the swollen ovary of the zucchini flower) with a hardened epicarp. In cookery, it is treated as a vegetable, usually cooked and eaten as an accompaniment or savory dish, though occasionally used in sweeter cooking.

Zucchini occasionally contain toxic cucurbitacins, making them extremely bitter, and causing severe gastero-enteric upsets. Causes include stressed growing conditions, and cross pollination with ornamental squashes.

Zucchini descends from squashes first domesticated in Mesoamerica over 7,000 years ago, but the zucchini itself was bred in Milan in the late 19th century.

==Naming and etymology==

The plant has three names in English, all of them meaning &#x27;small marrow&#x27;: (an Italian loanword), usually used in the plural form even when only one &quot;zucchino&quot; is meant, (a French loanword), and (South African English). &quot;Zucchini&quot; and &quot;courgette&quot; are doublets, both descending from the Latin .

=== Zucchini ===
The name &quot;zucchini&quot; is used in American, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand English. It is loaned from Italian, where is the plural masculine diminutive of ().

In Italian, the masculine (plural: ) is attested earlier and hence preferred by the Accademia della Crusca, the Italian language regulator. The feminine (plural: ) is also found, and preferred by the Italian-language encyclopedia &quot;Treccani&quot;, which considers to be a Tuscan dialect word.

&quot;Zucchini&quot; is also used in Canadian French, Danish, German, and Swedish.

=== Courgette ===
The name &quot;&quot; is used in British, Hiberno-, Malaysian, New Zealand, and South African English. It is loaned from French, where () is a diminutive of .

&quot;Courgette&quot; is also used in Dutch.

=== Baby marrow ===
The name &quot;baby marrow&quot; is used interchangeably in South Africa with &quot;courgette&quot;.

==Flower==
The female flower is a golden blossom on the end of each emergent zucchini. The male flower grows directly on the stem of the zucchini plant in the leaf axils (where leaf petiole meets stem), on a long stalk, and is slightly smaller than the female. Both flowers are edible and are often used to dress a meal or to garnish the cooked fruit.

Firm and fresh blossoms that are only slightly open are cooked to be eaten, with pistils removed from female flowers, and stamens removed from male flowers. The stems on the flowers can be retained as a way of giving the cook something to hold onto during cooking, rather than injuring the delicate petals, or they can be removed prior to cooking, or prior to serving. There are a variety of recipes in which the flowers may be deep fried as fritters or tempura (after dipping in a light tempura batter), stuffed, sautéed, baked, or used in soups.

==History==
Zucchini, like all squash, has its ancestry in the Americas, specifically Mesoamerica. The varieties of green, cylindrical squash harvested immature and typically called &quot;zucchini&quot; were cultivated in northern Italy, as much as three centuries after the introduction of cucurbits from the Americas. It appears that this occurred in the second half of the 19th century, although the first description of the variety under the name &quot;zucchini&quot; occurs in a work published in Milan in 1901. Early varieties usually appended the names of nearby cities in their names.

The first records of zucchini in the United States date to the early 1920s. It was almost certainly taken to America by Italian immigrants and probably was first cultivated in the United States in California. A 1928 report on vegetables grown in New York State treats &#x27;Zucchini&#x27; as one among 60 cultivated varieties of &quot;C. pepo&quot;.

==Culinary uses==


When used for food, zucchini are usually picked when under in length, when the seeds are still soft and immature. Mature zucchini can be long or more. These larger ones often have mature seeds and hard skins, requiring peeling and seeding. A zucchini with the flowers attached is a sign of a truly fresh and immature fruit, and it is especially sought after for its sweeter flavor.

Zucchini is usually served cooked. It can be prepared using a variety of cooking techniques, including steamed, boiled, grilled, stuffed and baked, barbecued, fried, or incorporated in other recipes such as soufflés. Raw grated zucchini can also be combined with flour and spices in a zucchini bread, similar to banana bread, or incorporated into a cake mix to make zucchini cake, similar to carrot cake. Its flowers can be eaten stuffed and are a delicacy when deep-fat-fried (e.g., tempura).

Zucchini has a delicate flavor and can be found simply cooked with butter or olive oil and herbs, or in more complex dishes. The skin is usually left in place. When frying zucchini, it is recommended to pat down cut sections to make them drier, similarly to what may be done with eggplant, in order to keep the slices&#x27; shape while cooking. Zucchini can also be eaten raw, sliced or shredded, in a cold salad, as well as lightly cooked in hot salads, as in Thai or Vietnamese recipes. Mature (larger-sized) zucchini are well-suited for cooking in breads.

Zucchinis can be cut with a spiralizer into noodle-like spirals and used as a low-carbohydrate substitute for pasta or noodles, often referred to as &#x27;zoodles&#x27;.

In Australia, a popular dish is a frittata-like dish called zucchini slice.

In Bulgaria, zucchini may be fried and then served with a dip, made from yogurt, garlic, and dill. Another popular dish is oven-baked zucchini—sliced or grated—covered with a mixture of eggs, yogurt, flour, and dill.

In Egypt, zucchini may be cooked with tomato sauce, garlic, and onions.

In France, zucchini is a key ingredient in ratatouille, a stew of summer vegetable-fruits and vegetables prepared in olive oil and cooked for an extended time over low heat. The dish, originating near present-day Nice, is served as a side dish or on its own at lunch with bread. Zucchini may be stuffed with meat or with other fruits such as tomatoes or bell peppers in a dish called &quot;courgette farcie&quot; (stuffed zucchini).

In Greece, zucchini is usually fried, stewed or boiled with other fruits (often green chili peppers and eggplants). It is served as an &quot;hors d&#x27;œuvre&quot; or as a main dish, especially during fasting seasons. Zucchini is also stuffed with minced meat, rice, and herbs and served with &quot;avgolemono&quot; sauce. In several parts of Greece, the flowers of the plant are stuffed with white cheese, usually feta or mizithra, or with a mixture of rice, herbs, and occasionally minced meat. They are then deep-fried or baked in the oven with tomato sauce.

In Italy, zucchini is served in a variety of ways: fried, baked, boiled, or deep fried, alone or in combination with other ingredients. At home and in some restaurants, it is possible to eat the flowers, as well, deep-fried, known as &quot;fiori di zucca&quot; (cf. pumpkin flower fritter).

In the cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire, zucchini is often stuffed and called &quot;dolma&quot;. It is also used in various stews, both with and without meat, including &quot;ladera&quot;.

In Sephardic Jewish cuisine, &quot;medias&quot; (from Judeo-Spanish, meaning &quot;halves&quot;) is a dish of halved zucchinis stuffed with meat and a mixture of ingredients, and cooked in a sour lemon sauce.

In Mexico, the flower (known as &quot;flor de calabaza&quot;) is often cooked in soups or used as a filling for quesadillas. The fruit is used in stews, soups (i.e. &quot;caldo de res&quot;, &quot;de pollo&quot;, or &quot;de pescado&quot;, &quot;mole de olla&quot;, etc.) and other preparations. The flower, as well as the fruit, is eaten often throughout Latin America.

In Russia, Ukraine and other CIS countries, zucchini usually is coated in flour or semolina and then fried or baked in vegetable oil, served with sour cream. Another popular recipe is &quot;zucchini caviar&quot;, a squash spread made from thermically processed zucchini, carrots, onions and tomato paste, produced either at home or industrially as a vegetable preserve.

In Turkey, zucchini is the main ingredient in the popular dish mücver, or &quot;zucchini pancakes&quot;, made from shredded zucchini, flour, and eggs, lightly fried in olive oil and eaten with yogurt. They are also often used in kebabs along with various meats. The flowers are also used in a cold dish, where they are stuffed with a rice mix with various spices and nuts and stewed.

In the United States, fried zucchini was invented in Pittsburgh.

In 2005, a poll of 2,000 people revealed it to be Britain&#x27;s 10th favorite culinary vegetable.

Stuffed zucchini is found in many cuisines. As an example, in Lebanon, zucchini can be used to create Kousa Mahshi, which translates to &quot;stuffed zucchini&quot; in Arabic. The dish is made by coring the squash and then stuffing it with rice and spiced ground beef. Vegetables and other protein substitutes such as lamb may also be used. The contents of the zucchini are cooked by first boiling it and then reducing the heat of the zucchini&#x27;s pot or container before letting it simmer for an hour. There&#x27;s also Lebanese Zucchini Stew, or Mnazelah, a stew consisting of zucchini, potatoes, tomatoes, meat, and varied spices. Typical stuffings in the Middle Eastern family of dolma include rice, onions, tomato, and sometimes meat.

==Nutrition==


Zucchini are low in food energy (approximately per fresh zucchini) and contain good amounts of folate (24 μg/100 g), potassium (261 mg/100 g), provitamin A (200 IU [10 RAE]/100 g) and vitamin C (12.9 mg/100 g) .

==Toxicology==
Members of the plant family Cucurbitaceae, which includes zucchini / marrows, pumpkins and cucumbers, can contain toxins called cucurbitacins. These are steroids which defend the plants from predators, and have a bitter taste to humans. Cultivated cucurbitaceae are bred for low levels of the toxin and are safe to eat. However, ornamental pumpkins can have high levels of cucurbitacins, and such ornamental plants can cross-fertilize edible cucurbitaceae—any such cross-fertilized seeds used by the gardener for growing food in the following season can therefore potentially produce bitter and toxic fruit. Dry weather or irregular watering can also favor the production of the toxin, which is not destroyed by cooking. Humans with an impaired sense of taste (particularly the elderly) should therefore ask another person to taste the zucchini for them. This toxin has caused at least one death of an elderly person, in 2015. Investigators warned that gardeners should not save their own seeds, as reversion to forms containing more poisonous cucurbitacin might occur.

Zucchini can also be responsible for allergy caused by the presence of a protein: profilin. The sap released when peeling young zucchini also contains a viscous substance which when drying on the hands gives the impression of super-glue and dry hands.

==Cultivation==

 Zucchini is very easy to cultivate in temperate climates. As such, it has a reputation among home gardeners for overwhelming production. The part harvested as &quot;zucchini&quot; is the immature fruit, although the flowers, mature fruit, and leaves are eaten, as well. One good way to control overabundance is to harvest the flowers, which are an expensive delicacy in markets because of the difficulty in storing and transporting them. The male flower is borne on the end of a stalk and is longer-lived.

While easy to grow, zucchini, like all squash, requires plentiful bees for pollination. In areas of pollinator decline or high pesticide use, such as mosquito-spray districts, gardeners often experience fruit abortion, where the fruit begins to grow, then dries or rots. This is due to an insufficient number of pollen grains delivered to the female flower. It can be corrected by hand pollination or by increasing the bee population.

Closely related to zucchini are Lebanese summer squash or &quot;kusa&quot; (not to be confused with cushaw), but they often are lighter green or even white. Some seed catalogs do not distinguish them. Various varieties of round zucchinis are grown in different countries under different names, such as &quot;Tondo di Piacenza&quot; in Italy, &quot;Qarabaghli&quot; in Malta and &quot;Ronde de Nice&quot; in France. In the late 1990s, American producers in California cultivated and began marketing round yellow and green zucchini known as &quot;8-ball&quot; squash (the yellow ones are sometimes known as &quot;1-ball&quot; or &quot;gold ball&quot;). White zucchini (summer squash) is sometimes seen as a mutation and can appear on the same plant as its green counterpart.

<text>Dae Insu, also known as King Seon (r. 818–830) was the 10th king of the kingdom of Balhae. He restored national strength, and is remembered today as the last of the great Balhae rulers before its fall.

== Background ==
Dae Insu was a 4th-generation descendant of Dae Joyeong&#x27;s younger brother, Dae Ya-bal. In spite being from the collateral branch, he succeeded to the throne during the years of 817 and 818. He reestablished royal authority, and strengthened the military tremendously.

== Reign ==

King Seon concentrated heavily on the empire&#x27;s territorial expansion, and led campaigns that resulted in the absorption of many northern Malgal tribes including Heishui Mohe. Southwest Little Goguryeo in Liaodong was absorbed into Balhae, and also he ordered southward expansion towards Silla.

During his 12-year reign, he dispatched embassies five times to Japan, which was aimed at establishing diplomatic relations as well as increasing trade between the two kingdoms. Balhae emissaries were treated favorably even though Japan wanted Balhae to restrict the size of the embassies due to the costs associated with hosting them. The trade routes established across the Sea of Japan led to Balhae becoming one of Japan&#x27;s most important trading partners.

He died in 830 and his grandson Dae Ijin succeeded to the throne.

<doc id="431011" wikidata="Q989437" url="?curid=431011" title="Emmaus (charity)">
<text>Emmaus (, ) is an international solidarity movement founded in Paris in 1949 by Catholic priest and Capuchin friar Abbé Pierre to combat poverty and homelessness. Since 1971 regional and national initiatives have been grouped under a parent organization, Emmaus International, now run by Jean Rousseau, representing 350 groups in 37 countries, offering a range of charitable services.

Emmaus is a secular organisation, but communities around the world have kept the name because of its symbolism. The biblical story, found in the Gospel of Luke, describes how two men saw the resurrected Jesus on the road to the town of Emmaus, and so regained hope. The organization&#x27;s guiding principle can be found in the Universal Manifesto of Emmaus International:
==History==
The first Emmaus Community was founded by Father Henri-Antoine Groues (known as Abbé Pierre) in Paris in 1949 following the Second World War. The former Resistance member was also an MP who fought to provide accommodation for the homeless people of Paris. He was assisted by another former Resistance member, Lucie Coutaz.

As Paris faced poor living conditions and a lack of housing, father Pierre opened up his house to a group of those in need. He only set one condition: for them to help others. In 1947, Pierre rented a dilapidated home in Neuilly-Plaisance, 14km east from Paris. He rebuilt the house and opened an international youth centre, which he named &quot;Emaús&quot;, as a symbol of renovated hope. In 1949, he invited Georges Legay to become the first Emmaús Companion. Georges, a former convict who had attempted suicide in the Seine, helped to build temporary homes for those in need (initially in the priest&#x27;s own garden), and then on any land they could obtain.

While Emaús was created by a catholic priest, the intention behind it was to be a movement open to those of all nationalities and ethnic origins, without any distinction to separate individuals, ignoring any political convictions, spiritual or religious of those seeking help. 

Initially, Emaús was sustained with Abbé Pierre&#x27;s own salary. In 1951, lacking money, Abbé Pierre began to ask for money in the streets of Paris. Other members of the group then proposed that they should search the trash of Paris, to obtain and sell all that they could obtain. 

From Parliament in 1951, Abbé Pierre dedicated himself to the homeless cause. He struggled to pay Georges and the first 18 members of the Emmaus Community. The priest was rebuffed by his Church for begging at restaurants and so organised &#x27;rag pickers&#x27; to collect unwanted items for resale. This formed the basis of Emmaus Communities raising funds and using profits to help others.

When the harsh french winter of 1954 hit, many homeless people died in the streets. As a result, Abbé Pierre launched a campaign for donations on &quot;Radio Luxembourg:&quot; &quot;Friends, this is a call for help. A woman has just frozen to death tonight, near boulevard Sebastopol, in her hands, an eviction note&quot;. In the following days, more than 2000 tonnes of donations were seen.

== International movement ==
During the 1950s, in many countries, communities imitating Abbé Pierre&#x27;s actions emerged, following his practices as a model. In 1969, in Bern, Switzerland, 60 groups of people from 20 countries adopted the &quot;Universal Manifesto of the Emaús movement,&quot; deciding to create a general international secretary. 

In 1971, the Emaús movement became the International Emaús. The preamble of the organisation&#x27;s manifesto states: Our name, Emaús, is one of a Palestinian city where those who were desperate found hope ahain. This name evokes in all, whether believers or not, our common conviction in which only love can unite us and help us move forward together. The objective of this movement is &quot;to act for every human, every society, every nation, so they can live and share&quot;.

By 2017 there were 400 Emmaus organisations in 44 countries.

==Emmaus in the UK==
The first British Emmaus Community appeared in Cambridge in 1992. It was set up by Selwyn Image, who had been a student volunteer at an Emmaus Community in Paris. The charity provides formerly homeless people with a home and work, usually collecting, sorting and reselling donated furniture and household goods. &#x27;Emmaus UK acts as a central resource to local Emmaus Communities across the UK. As of September 2016, there are 28 Emmaus Communities operating in the UK, with others under development. These communities provide accommodation and meaningful work for formerly homeless people.

<text>Big Fish is a 2003 American fantasy drama film directed by Tim Burton. It is based on the 1998 novel &quot;Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions&quot; by Daniel Wallace. The film stars Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter, Alison Lohman, Robert Guillaume, Marion Cotillard, Steve Buscemi, and Danny DeVito. It tells the story of a frustrated son who tries to distinguish fact from fiction in the life of his father, a teller of tall tales.

The screenwriter John August read a manuscript of the novel six months before it was published and convinced Columbia Pictures to acquire the rights. He began adapting the novel as a screenplay while producers negotiated with Steven Spielberg about directing the film. Spielberg eventually left the project to focus on &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (2002). Tim Burton and Richard D. Zanuck took over after completing &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (2001), and brought McGregor and Finney on board.

The film&#x27;s theme of reconciliation between a dying father and his son had special significance for Burton, whose father had died in 2000. &quot;Big Fish&quot; was shot on location in Alabama in a series of fairy tale vignettes with a Southern Gothic aesthetic. The film premiered on December 4, 2003, at the Hammerstein Ballroom and was released in limited capacity on December 10, followed by a wide release on January 9, 2004. It received various award nominations, including seven BAFTA nominations, four Golden Globe nominations and two Saturn Award nominations. It also received an Academy Award nomination and a Grammy Award nomination for Danny Elfman&#x27;s original score. A musical adaptation of &quot;Big Fish&quot; premiered in Chicago in April 2013.

==Plot==

At William Bloom&#x27;s wedding party, his father Edward recalls the day Will was born, claiming he caught an enormous catfish using his wedding ring as bait. Will has heard his father&#x27;s fanciful tales many times, and believes they are lies. Fed up by the stories, Will has a falling out with his father. Three years later, Edward is diagnosed with cancer, prompting Will and his pregnant wife Joséphine to spend time with him in Alabama.

Edward&#x27;s life is chronicled through flashbacks, beginning with his boyhood encounter with a witch. She shows Edward how he will die, which does not faze him. As he reaches adulthood, he finds his home too confining, and sets out into the world. He meets a giant named Karl, and they begin traveling together. When they find a fork in the road, they take separate paths. Edward traverses a swamp and discovers the hidden town of Spectre, where he befriends the poet Norther Winslow and the mayor&#x27;s daughter, Jenny. Not ready to settle down, Edward leaves Spectre, but makes a promise to Jenny that he will return.

At Joséphine&#x27;s request, the bed-ridden Edward tells her how he met his wife, Sandra. In more flashbacks, Edward and Karl visit the Calloway Circus, where Edward falls in love with a beautiful woman. Edward and Karl get jobs in the circus, and the ringmaster Amos Calloway reveals to Edward one detail about the woman each month. Three years later, Edward discovers that Amos is a werewolf, but shows no ill will towards him. In gratitude, Amos reveals the woman&#x27;s name as Sandra Templeton. Edward confesses his love to Sandra, but she rebuffs him despite his romantic gestures. Sandra&#x27;s fiancé Don Price beats Edward up, which prompts Sandra to break off their engagement and marry Edward instead.

Shortly after, Edward is conscripted into the army and fights in the Korean War. He parachutes into the middle of a North Korean military show, steals important documents, and persuades the twins Ping and Jing to help him escape in exchange for making them celebrities. Upon returning home, Edward becomes a traveling salesman. In the present, Will investigates the truth behind his father&#x27;s tales. He meets an older Jenny, who explains that Edward rescued Spectre from bankruptcy and rebuilt it with help from his circus friends. Jenny reveals that although she loved Edward, he remained loyal to Sandra.

Edward has a stroke and Will visits him at the hospital. Unable to speak much, he asks Will to narrate how his life ends. Will tells his father a fantastical tale of their daring escape from the hospital. They travel to a lake, where everyone from Edward&#x27;s past is there to see him off. Will carries his father into the river, where he transforms into a giant catfish and swims away. Satisfied by Will&#x27;s story, Edward dies peacefully. At the funeral, Will and Joséphine are surprised to see all the people from Edward&#x27;s stories, although they appear slightly less fantastical. Later, Will passes on Edward&#x27;s stories to his son.

==Production==

=== Development ===
About six months before it was published, the screenwriter John August read a manuscript of the 1998 novel &quot;Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions&quot; by Daniel Wallace. In September 1998, August convinced Columbia Pictures to acquire the film rights on his behalf. He worked hard to turn the episodic book into a cohesive screenplay, which he decided needed multiple narrators. In August 2000, the producers Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks began discussions for Steven Spielberg to direct the film. Spielberg planned to have DreamWorks co-finance and distribute &quot;Big Fish&quot; with Columbia, and intended to start filming in late 2001, after completing &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002).

Spielberg courted Jack Nicholson for the role of the older Edward Bloom. He felt that the script did not give Nicholson enough to do, so he asked August to write new sequences. Spielberg eventually left &quot;Big Fish&quot; when he became involved with &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (2002), and DreamWorks also backed out of the project. With Spielberg no longer involved, August and the producers restored the script to its previous version. Spielberg later admitted that he made a mistake by asking August to alter the screenplay. August took his favorite elements from the previous drafts and came up with what he called &quot;a best-of &quot;Big Fish&quot; script&quot;. August, Jinks and Cohen considered Stephen Daldry as a potential director before deciding to approach Tim Burton. At this point, August felt the script was the best it had ever been.

Burton had just finished directing the big-budget film &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (2001), and was ready for a smaller-scale project. He liked the &quot;Big Fish&quot; screenplay, feeling that it was the first unique story he had been offered since &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; (1988). The script&#x27;s combination of an emotional drama with exaggerated tall tales allowed him to tell multiple stories of different genres, which he enjoyed. Burton&#x27;s father had died recently, and he found that he could process emotions related to his father&#x27;s death by making the film. He signed on to direct in April 2002, which prompted Richard D. Zanuck, who worked with Burton on &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, to join &quot;Big Fish&quot; as a producer.

===Casting===

For the role of Edward Bloom, Burton spoke with Jack Nicholson, Spielberg&#x27;s initial choice for the role. Burton had previously worked with Nicholson on &quot;Batman&quot; (1989) and &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; (1996). In order to depict Nicholson as the young Edward, Burton intended to use a combination of computer-generated imagery and prosthetic makeup. Jinks and Cohen, who were working with Ewan McGregor on &quot;Down with Love&quot; (2003) at the time, suggested that Burton cast both McGregor and Albert Finney for Edward. After viewing Finney&#x27;s performance in &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963), Burton observed similarities between him and McGregor, and coincidentally found a &quot;People&quot; magazine article comparing the two. The Scottish McGregor found it easier to perform Edward&#x27;s Southern American accent than a standard American accent. He said of the Southern accent: &quot;[Y]ou can really hear it. You can get your teeth into it. Standard American is much harder.&quot;

The same dual casting applied to the role of Edward&#x27;s wife, Sandra, who would be played by Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman. Both Burton and Zanuck had been impressed with Lohman&#x27;s performance in &quot;White Oleander&quot; (2002), and felt she was the ideal candidate for the role. Burton&#x27;s girlfriend, Helena Bonham Carter, was cast in two roles: Jenny and the Witch. Her prosthetic makeup for the Witch took five hours to apply. She was pregnant during filming and experienced morning sickness, which was exacerbated by the fumes from the make-up.

Burton personalized the film with several cameos. While filming in Alabama, the crew tracked down Billy Redden, one of the banjo players from &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1972). Redden was a co-owner of a restaurant in Clayton, Georgia, and he agreed to appear in the Spectre sequence. As Edward first enters the town, Redden can be seen on a porch plucking a few notes from &quot;Dueling Banjos&quot;. Daniel Wallace makes a brief appearance as Sandra&#x27;s economics teacher.

===Filming===

Principal photography began on January 13, 2003. &quot;Big Fish&quot; was shot entirely in Alabama except for one week of filming in Paris in May. Most of the Alabama scenes were shot in Wetumpka and Montgomery. Some filming also took place in Tallassee and on the campus of Huntingdon College. Scenes in the town of Spectre were filmed on a custom-built set on Jackson Lake Island. Principal photography continued until the first week of April and is estimated to have generated as much as $25 million for the local economy. The Spectre set can still be found at its original location.

Burton filmed all the hospital scenes and most of Finney&#x27;s scenes first, before moving on to McGregor&#x27;s scenes. Scenes with Karl the Giant were created using forced perspective filmmaking. Helena Bonham Carter&#x27;s prosthetic makeup was designed by Stan Winston Studios, which also created animatronics for the production. Flooding on the set interrupted filming of the circus scenes for several weeks, but Burton managed to deliver the film on budget and on schedule.

===Post-production===

Although Burton limited the use of digital effects in &quot;Big Fish&quot;, he employed color grading to achieve a Southern Gothic aesthetic. The film&#x27;s musical score was composed by Burton&#x27;s frequent collaborator Danny Elfman, and Burton approached Pearl Jam to request an original song for the closing credits. After viewing an early print of the film, the group&#x27;s vocalist Eddie Vedder wrote the song &quot;Man of the Hour&quot;. He completed a demo within a day, and the band recorded the song four days later. Pearl Jam&#x27;s guitarist Mike McCready stated, &quot;We were so blown away by the movie ... Eddie and I were standing around talking about it afterwards and were teary-eyed. We were so emotionally charged and moved by the imagination and humanity.&quot;

==Release==
The world premiere of &quot;Big Fish&quot; took place on December 4, 2003, at the Hammerstein Ballroom in Manhattan. Columbia Pictures had initially planned a November wide release for the film in the United States, but ultimately decided on a December 10 limited release. The US wide release occurred on January 9, 2004, with the film appearing in 2,406 theaters and earning $13.8 million in its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $66.8 million in the United States and $56.1 million in other countries, for a total of $122.9 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
In his review of the film, Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called &quot;Big Fish&quot; &quot;a wide-eyed Southern Gothic picaresque in which each lunatic twist of a development is more enchanting than the last.&quot; Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised Burton&#x27;s directing and described the film as a touching father-son drama and a celebration of the art of storytelling. Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; applauded the casting choices. He called the evolution of Alison Lohman&#x27;s character into an older woman &quot;delightful&quot; and &quot;a metamorphosis to equal any in screen history.&quot; Gleiberman, Travers and Clark all compared &quot;Big Fish&quot; to &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994).

James Berardinelli found the film&#x27;s fairy tale approach reminiscent of &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987) and the films of Terry Gilliam. He called the film &quot;a clever, smart fantasy that targets the child inside every adult, without insulting the intelligence of either.&quot; In a mixed review, Roger Ebert wrote, &quot;[T]here is no denying that Will has a point: The old man is a blowhard. There is a point at which his stories stop working as entertainment and segue into sadism.&quot; Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine was disappointed, finding the father-son reconciliation storyline to be cliché. Referencing the fable &quot;The Boy Who Cried Wolf&quot;, Corliss called Edward Bloom &quot;the man who cried fish.&quot; Slant Magazine ranked &quot;Big Fish&quot; as the 85th best film of the decade 2000–2010.

On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 75% of critics have positively reviewed &quot;Big Fish&quot;, giving it an average score of 7.2/10. Metacritic calculates an average score of 58/100 based on 42 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

==Thematic analysis==
The reconciliation between father and son has been called the central theme in &quot;Big Fish&quot;. Daniel Wallace&#x27;s interest in the theme began with his own family. He described Edward as similar to his own father, who used charm to keep his distance from people. In the film, Will believes his father has never been honest with him, using extravagant myths about his past to hide himself. Wallace said that Edward and Will each undertake their own quest in the film. Edward&#x27;s quest is &quot;to be a big fish in a big pond&quot; while Will&#x27;s quest is to see through his father&#x27;s tall tales.&quot;

John August identified with Will&#x27;s character and modeled it after himself. Like Will, August had attempted to get to know his father before his death, but found it difficult. Both Will and August were 28 years old and had studied journalism. In the film, Will says &quot;I didn&#x27;t see anything of myself in my father, and I don&#x27;t think he saw anything of himself in me. We were like strangers who knew each other very well.&quot; Will&#x27;s description of his relationship with Edward closely resembled August&#x27;s relationship with his own father. Burton also used the film to explore his emotions about the death of his father. He said, &quot;My father had been ill for a while ... I tried to get in touch with him, to have, like in this film, some sort of resolution, but it was impossible.&quot;

The film scholar Kent L. Brintnall claimed that the father-son relationship resolves itself at the end of &quot;Big Fish&quot;. He suggested that as Edward dies, Will lets go of his anger and begins to understand his father for the first time. Brintnall called Will&#x27;s willingness to finish his father&#x27;s story a &quot;gesture of love and comprehension&quot; and an &quot;act of communion and care&quot;. Brintnall asserted that Will comes to understand that Edward&#x27;s stories &quot;gave him a reality and substance ... that was as real, genuine, and deep as the day-to-day experiences that Will sought out&quot;.

<doc id="431026" wikidata="Q4596252" url="?curid=431026" title="1st Canadian Armoured Brigade">
<text>The 1st Canadian Army Tank Brigade, later known as 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade, was an armoured brigade of the Canadian Army, raised during the Second World War. The brigade was composed of the 11th, 12th and 14th Canadian Armoured regiments and saw service in the Italian campaign and later in north-west Europe. It was one of only two independent Canadian armoured brigades in combat, the other being 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade.

==History==
The 1st Canadian Tank Brigade was formed on 4 February 1941. The Ontario Regiment and The Three Rivers Regiment were transferred from the incomplete 1st Canadian Armoured Division to provide the nucleus of the 1st Canadian Tank Brigade in February 1941. In March, The Calgary Regiment joined the new brigade from 2nd Division. The Fort Garry Horse were also originally part of the brigade, but transferred to the 5th Canadian (Armoured) Division in May 1941.

The 1st Tank Brigade moved to the United Kingdom in the summer of 1941; personnel arrived in the Clyde on 30 June and were promptly moved to the Salisbury Plain Training Area where they were issued sufficient Churchill tanks for training. The Calgary Regiment participated in the disastrous Dieppe landing in 1942. Issued brand new M4 &quot;Sherman&quot; tanks, the entire brigade moved to the Mediterranean, with The Three Rivers Regiment participating in the assault landing at Pachino. The remainder of the brigade landed with the follow-up convoy of 13 July and served alongside the Three Rivers Regiment for the final weeks of the Allied invasion of Sicily. The 1st Tank Brigade&#x27;s role in the latter operations was largely one of fire support, the rugged terrain limiting the role of the armoured corps. The fight for Sicily ended with 1st Tank in reserve. Preparing for Operation Baytown, the Allied invasion of Italy, it was redesignated 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade in August 1943. Although reorganized as an armoured brigade, no motor battalion served under command. Having established a reputation for both courage and skill, the Canadian tankers were in constant demand by senior British commanders.

The brigade took part in the landings of the Eighth Army on the toe of Italy in Operation Baytown in September 1943. Its regiments participated in the Battles of Potenza, Termoli, Ortona. During the fourth and final Battle of Monte Cassino in May 1944, the brigade helped break the Winter Line (Gustav Line), crossing the Gari River in support of the 8th Indian Division. Its regiments helped the 1st Canadian Division and the 78th Division in breaking the Hitler Line. It cooperated with the XIII Corps in the Battle of Lake Trasimeno. It was active in the crossing of the Arno River and later fought on the Gothic Line.

Combined with the 1st Canadian Infantry Division and 5th Canadian Armoured Division as part of I Canadian Corps, the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade was moved from the Italian Front and joined the First Canadian Army in Northern Europe at the beginning of 1945. Here it participated in the crossing of the IJssel River. In its two incarnations as 1st Tank and 1st Armoured, the brigade&#x27;s service at Dieppe, France, in Sicily, Italy and Northwest Europe earned it the distinction of the longest and widest service of any brigade of the Canadian Army during the Second World War.

==Organization==
The battle order starting 4 February 1941:
* 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade Headquarters Squadron (The Prince Edward Island Light Horse)

<text>Karl Joseph Wirth (; 6 September 1879 – 3 January 1956) was a German politician of the Catholic Centre Party who was chancellor of Germany from May 1921 to November 1922, during the early years of the Weimar Republic. He was also minister of four government departments between 1920 and 1931 (Foreign Affairs, Finance, Interior, and Occupied Territories). Wirth was strongly influenced by Christian social teaching throughout his political career. 

He was named chancellor in May 1921 when Germany was facing difficult negotiations with the Allies of World War I over German war reparations. Wirth accepted the Allies&#x27; conditions and began a policy of fulfilment – an attempt to show that Germany was unable to afford the reparations payments by making the effort to meet them. He resigned after less than six months in protest against the partition of Upper Silesia by the League of Nations and formed a second, minority cabinet a few days later. Following the assassination of Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau by members of a right-wing terrorist group in April 1922, his government attempted to confront political violence with the Law for the Protection of the Republic. Wirth&#x27;s second government resigned after just over a year when it was unable to expand its political base.

After his two terms as chancellor, Wirth continued to fight right-wing political forces as a Reichstag member and government minister. During the Nazi era he went into exile and worked with several anti-Nazi groups. Following the end of World War II, he opposed Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s policy of integration with the West. Although he lived in West Germany, he had contacts with the Soviet Union and East Germany, the latter of which awarded him two prestigious honours. He died in his hometown of Freiburg in 1956.

==Early life==
Karl Joseph Wirth was born on 6 September 1879 in Freiburg im Breisgau in what was then the Grand Duchy of Baden, a federal state of the German Empire. He was the son of Karl Wirth, a master machinist at a printing company, and his wife Agathe (née Zeller). The involvement of his parents, who were Catholic, in Christian and social causes had a strong influence on him throughout his life.

From 1899 to 1906, he studied mathematics, natural sciences and economics at the University of Freiburg. He obtained his doctorate in mathematics in 1906 with the thesis &quot;On the elementary divisors of a linear homogeneous substitution&quot;. From 1906 to 1913, he taught mathematics at a (secondary school) in Freiburg. In 1909, he was a co-founder and first president of the (Society of Saint Vincent de Paul), a charity run by laymen for the poor. Social issues were consistently his main concern after he entered politics.

=== Start of political career ===
In 1911 Wirth was elected to the Freiburg city council for the Catholic Centre Party. From 1913 to 1921, he was a member of the Baden , the lower house of parliament of the Grand Duchy (after 1918 the Republic) of Baden. In 1914 he became a member of the Imperial Reichstag following a difficult campaign against a National Liberal candidate who was in part responsible for Wirth&#x27;s life-long dislike of the &quot;parties of property and education&quot;. 

At the start of World War I, Wirth volunteered for military service but for health reasons was deemed unfit. He then volunteered with the Red Cross and served on both the Western and Eastern Fronts until 1917, when he left after contracting pneumonia.

Wirth voted for the July 1917 Reichstag Peace Resolution, which was sponsored by Matthias Erzberger, also of the Centre Party, and called for a negotiated peace without annexations. In the final year of the war, Wirth increasingly often criticized the policies of the imperial government and pushed for internal reforms.

==Revolution and Weimar Republic==
In the first days of the German revolution of 1918–1919, after Baden&#x27;s provisional government had replaced the Grand Duke&#x27;s ministers, Wirth became Finance minister of Baden. The peaceful course of the revolution there made it possible for the Centre Party to work with the moderate Majority Social Democratic Party (MSPD). Wirth engaged with Catholic workers to keep them from becoming radicalised and spoke in favour of a leading role for the Centre Party in building a democratic Germany. His position reflected his beliefs in Catholicism&#x27;s social teaching and in Christian democracy.

In January 1919, Wirth was elected to both the Baden Constituent Assembly and the Weimar National Assembly, which wrote the new constitutions for the Republic of Baden and the Weimar Republic. After the Kapp Putsch of March 1920, when Chancellor Gustav Bauer of the MSPD resigned and was replaced by Hermann Müller (MSPD), Wirth became Germany&#x27;s minister of Finance. He continued to hold the portfolio in the subsequent cabinet of Constantin Fehrenbach (Centre Party).

As Finance minister, Wirth continued the policies of his predecessor, Matthias Erzberger (Centre). They included the centralisation at the national level of the authority to tax and spend and the redistribution of taxes to lighten the burden on those with low to moderate incomes. Through ties with military leadership, he also saw that funds were provided to help begin secretly rearming Germany in contravention of the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles.

== Chancellorships ==
The Fehrenbach cabinet resigned on 4 May when it was unable to reach a decision on whether to accept the London Schedule of Payments, which set German war reparations at 132 billion gold marks. The London ultimatum issued on 5 May threatened an Allied occupation of the Ruhr if Germany did not accept the terms within six days. The Centre and SPD were in favour of accepting the London Schedule in spite of the anger it had aroused in the German public. Since Wirth was the only candidate for chancellor whom the SPD would accept, and no government could be built without them, Wirth and the Centre Party formed a coalition on 10 May with the SPD and the German Democratic Party (DDP). Wirth remained Finance minister in his new cabinet.

=== First term ===
The Reichstag ratified the London Schedule the following day, 11 May, and Wirth began his &quot;fulfilment policy&quot; (). By attempting to comply with the Allied demands – and thus prevent them from occupying the Ruhr – Wirth wanted to show that the annual payments of three billion gold marks were beyond Germany&#x27;s means. On 31 August 1921, after considerable effort, Germany was able to pay the first half-yearly instalment. During the period of relaxed diplomatic relations that surrounded the payment, the U.S.–German Peace Treaty was signed, and Walther Rathenau, then minister of Reconstruction, concluded a comprehensive agreement with France for paying reparations in kind for the reconstruction of the devastated regions of the country. The fulfilment policy was quickly broken off due to the problems of financing it. In December 1921 Germany had to request a postponement of the next payment. The extreme Right reacted to Wirth&#x27;s reparations policy by calling for his assassination.

Two members of the right-wing terrorist group Organisation Consul assassinated Matthias Erzberger on 26 August 1921 for his role in signing the Armistice of 11 November. At about the same time, the conflict between the Berlin government and the Bavarian government of Gustav Ritter von Kahr came to a head when President Friedrich Ebert placed Bavaria under a state of emergency. The Reich government was then able to disarm the paramilitary Bavarian Citizens&#x27; Defense groups (), and Kahr, without their armed support, stepped down as Bavarian minister president.

The strife which arose out of the crisis in Bavaria had only just abated when in mid-October the League of Nations&#x27; announcement of the partition of Upper Silesia between Germany and Poland aroused considerable anger throughout Germany. Almost sixty percent of the vote in the March 1921 plebiscite in ethnically mixed Upper Silesia was in favour of staying part of Germany, but the heavily industrialised eastern part of the region was nevertheless awarded to Poland. Wirth believed that its severance from Germany would fatally affect Germany&#x27;s capacity to pay its reparations.

On 22 October 1921, he resigned in protest over the partition. Three days later, President Friedrich Ebert once again asked him to form a government, which Wirth did on 26 October with the second Wirth cabinet. Because the DDP and German People&#x27;s Party (DVP) had refused to accept the partition of Silesia or join any coalition that agreed to it, the SPD and Centre Party formed a minority government. On 26 October, Wirth gave a government statement in which he presented his new cabinet as a combination of trusted individuals, not as members of a coalition.

=== Second term ===

On 16 April 1922, Wirth and Walther Rathenau signed the Treaty of Rapallo, under which Germany and Soviet Russia renounced all war-related territorial and financial claims against each other and opened friendly diplomatic relations, a move which ended Germany&#x27;s post-war foreign policy isolation. After Rathenau was assassinated by far-right extremists of the Organisation Consul on 24 June 1922, Wirth gave a speech in front of the Reichstag in which he warned that &quot;we are experiencing in Germany a political brutalisation&quot; that was characterized by &quot;an atmosphere of murder, of rancour, of poison,&quot; and famously proclaimed:There stands the enemy, who drips his poison into the wounds of a people. There stands the enemy, and about it there is no doubt: the enemy is on the Right!On 21 July 1922, the Reichstag passed the Law for the Protection of the Republic on the initiative of the Wirth government. It increased the penalties for political assassinations and banned organisations opposed to the &quot;constitutional republican form of government&quot; along with their printed matter and meetings. 

Wirth tried to extend his government&#x27;s minority coalition to the right to include the DVP, but even his own Centre Party was becoming increasingly unhappy at having to work with the SPD, which had reunited with the more radical Independent Social Democrats (USPD) in September 1922. After the government lost a key vote on the grain levy in November, the government resigned. On 22 November, Wilhelm Cuno, a political independent, replaced Wirth as chancellor.

== Post-chancellorship ==
In 1924 Wirth joined the &quot;Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold&quot;, a paramilitary organization formed by the SPD, Centre and DDP for the non-violent protection of the Republic from the enemies of democracy. Wirth used its rallies to speak in opposition to the Centre Party&#x27;s drift to the right. When it joined the government of the independent Hans Luther in January 1925, Wirth criticized it for working with the nationalist German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP) in the Luther cabinet. He left the Centre&#x27;s Reichstag contingent in protest against the party&#x27;s social policies In August 1925 but returned in July 1926. In August of that year, Wirth, Paul Löbe of the SPD and Ludwig Haas of the Baden DDP formed a Republican Union as a way to maintain cooperation between representatives of the working class and those of the progressive middle class. The Centre Party then removed Wirth&#x27;s name from the list of candidates for the 1928 Reichstag election. Wirth had to submit to a number of conditions before his name was restored.

In April 1929, Wirth became minister for the Occupied Territories (the Rhineland region occupied by the Allies) in the second Müller cabinet. After the government&#x27;s resignation in late March 1930, Wirth became minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Heinrich Brüning, the first of the presidential cabinets. Wirth&#x27;s main task at the Interior Ministry was to try to hold back the growing power of the Nazis. He was highly popular with the Social Democrats and acted as mediator between them and the new government. In October 1931, he was pushed out of office and replaced by Wilhelm Groener on the personal initiative of President Paul von Hindenburg, who regarded Wirth as a leftist.

=== Nazi era ===
In March 1933, two months after Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor by Hindenburg, Wirth spoke passionately in the Reichstag against the Nazi-sponsored Enabling Act, which gave Hitler dictatorial powers. Bowing to the pressure of party unity, he nevertheless voted in favour of the Act with the rest of the Centre parliamentary contingent on 24 March. After its passage, Wirth emigrated to Switzerland, settling in Lucerne and purchasing a villa there. He communicated with leading statesmen in Britain and France about the dangers of Nazism and travelled to the US, where he met with the exiled former chancellor Heinrich Brüning and gave lectures on the Nazi regime at Harvard University and Princeton University. Wirth lived in Paris from 1935 to 1939, after which he returned to Lucerne. In the early days of World War II, he worked with the British government and an anti-Nazi group around Admiral Wilhelm Canaris on a possible coup and peace settlement, but the talks ended when Germany invaded France in 1940. Subsequently, he made efforts to inform the Vatican about the threat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s anti-Jewish policies, and during World War II, he secretly kept in touch with anti-Nazi Solf Circle and Kreisau Circle in Germany. He was also one of the founders of &quot;Democratic Germany&quot; (), a working group with SPD members in exile. It drew up guidelines for the re-establishment of a democratic Germany that they hoped would avoid the mistakes that had brought down the Weimar Republic.
=== Later life ===
Wirth returned from exile to Freiburg in 1948. He opposed Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s policy of integration with the West for fear of making the division of Germany permanent. Together with , he founded the neutralist &quot;Alliance of Germans, Party for Unity, Peace and Freedom&quot; (BdD) in 1953. The party was supported by the SED, the ruling communist party in East Germany. Although Wirth did not approve of Stalin&#x27;s policies, he believed in a compromise with Soviet Russia in line with the Rapallo Treaty. In 1951, Wirth visited Moscow for political talks.

Unlike West Germany, East Germany paid Wirth a small amount of financial aid. In 1954 he was awarded the East German &quot;Peace Medal&quot; and received the Stalin Peace Prize in 1955. The CIA file &quot;The background of Joseph Wirth&quot; states that Wirth was a Soviet agent. According to a CIA document, Wirth claimed that he met with Lavrentiy Beria, chief of the Soviet secret police, in Berlin in December 1952. Wirth said Beria asked him to join the East German government.

Wirth died of heart failure in 1956, aged 76, in his hometown of Freiburg and was buried in the city&#x27;s main cemetery.

<text>HMS &quot;Victorious&quot; was the third after &quot;Illustrious&quot; and &quot;Formidable&quot;. Ordered under the 1936 Naval Programme, she was laid down at the Vickers-Armstrong shipyard at Newcastle upon Tyne in 1937 and launched two years later in 1939. Her commissioning was delayed until 1941 due to the greater need for escort vessels for service in the Battle of the Atlantic.

Her service in 1941 and 1942 included famous actions against the battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, several Arctic convoys, and Operation Pedestal. She was loaned to the United States Navy in 1943 and served in the south west Pacific as part of the Third Fleet. In 1944 &quot;Victorious&quot; contributed to several attacks on the &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. The elimination of the German naval threat allowed her redeployment first to the Eastern Fleet at Colombo and then to the Pacific for the final actions of the war against Japan.

After the war, her service was broken by periods in reserve and, between 1950 and 1958, the most complete reconstruction of any Royal Navy carrier. This involved the construction of new superstructure above the hangar deck level, a new angled flight deck, new boilers and the fitting of Type 984 radar and data links and heavy shipboard computers, able to track 50 targets and assess their priority for interrogation and interception. The reduction of Britain&#x27;s naval commitment in 1967, the end of the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, and a fire while under refit, prompted her final withdrawal from service, three to five years early, and she was scrapped in 1969.

==Construction==
&quot;Victorious&quot; was one of two &quot;Illustrious&quot;-class aircraft carriers ordered from Vickers-Armstrong under the 1936 Construction Programme for the Royal Navy. The cost of the new carriers was estimated to be £2,395,000 each. &quot;Victorious&quot; was laid down at Vickers&#x27; Walker Naval Yard, Newcastle-upon-Tyne on 4 May 1937 as Admiralty Job Number J4035 and Yard number 11. Construction was slowed by the unavailability of armour plate, with &quot;Victorious&quot; launched on 14 September 1939, with Augusta Inskip, wife of Thomas Inskip, the Lord Chancellor, as sponsor. The carrier was commissioned at the shipyard on 29 March 1941, leaving Walker for Sea trials and passage to Rosyth dockyard on 16 April 1941.
==World War II==

===&quot;Bismarck&quot; episode===
The first task given to the newly commissioned aircraft carrier was to ferry Hawker Hurricane fighters to Malta. 48 crated Hurricanes were loaded aboard &quot;Victorious&quot; at Rosyth on 14 May 1941, and on 15 May she sailed for Scapa Flow to join Convoy WS 8B to the Middle East. Following the sortie of the and cruiser , &quot;Victorious&quot;, despite not being worked up and having an understrength air wing (consisting of the nine biplane Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 825 Naval Air Squadron and a flight of Fairey Fulmar fighters), was ordered to take part in the hunt for &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, sailing from Scapa Flow with the battleship , the battlecruiser and 4 light cruisers on the evening of 22 May.
Late on 24 May 1941, &quot;Victorious&quot; launched nine of her Swordfishes, followed by three Fulmars to track the German battleship, with two more Fulmar later launched to relieve the first three Fulmars. The Swordfish, under the command of Eugene Esmonde, flew through foul weather and attacked &quot;Bismarck&quot; in the face of tremendous fire from anti-aircraft guns, scoring a hit to the 320 mm armoured belt with a torpedo. No aircraft were shot down during the attack, but two Fulmars ditched after they could not find the carrier in the dark because a rain squall had moved in and the carrier&#x27;s homing beacon had failed. &quot;Victorious&quot; took no further part in the chase; aircraft from disabled &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s steering gear, thus contributing to her sinking three days later. Esmonde received a DSO for his part in the action.

===Convoy and other Arctic duties===
On 31 May 1941, &quot;Victorious&quot; set out in another attempt to deliver the Hurricanes, sailing with troop convoy WS 8X. On 4 June 1941 a Swordfish of 825 Squadron from &quot;Victorious&quot; spotted the German supply ship &quot;Gonzenheim&quot; north of the Azores. &quot;Gonzenheim&quot; had been intended to support the &quot;Bismarck&quot; but was subsequently scuttled when approached by the battleship and cruiser . On 5 June, &quot;Victorious&quot; was detached to Gibraltar, where the Hurricanes were uncrated by &quot;Victorious&quot;″s crew, with 20 Hurricanes transferred to &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. The two carriers left Gibraltar on 13 June to carry out Operation Tracer to deliver the Hurricanes to Malta, with 47 aircraft being launched on 14 June from a position south of the Balearic Islands. 43 Hurricanes landed safely on Malta. &quot;Victorious&quot; returned to the naval base at Scapa Flow on 19 June with 63 captured crewmen from &quot;Gonzenheim&quot;.

&quot;Victorious&quot; embarked a new air wing in early July, consisting of the Fulmar-equipped 809 Naval Air Squadron (NAS) and two squadrons (827 NAS and 828 NAS) equipped with the Fairey Albacore torpedo bomber. To provide support to the Soviet Union following the Operation Barbarossa the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the carriers &quot;Victorious&quot; and were ordered to conduct Operation EF (1941) attacks on the ports of Kirkenes and Petsamo in the far north of Norway and Finland respectively. On 26 July a task force including the two carriers set out from Seyðisfjörður in Iceland. For the first part of the operation, the task force escorted the minelayer , on passage to Archangelsk with a cargo including mines, before leaving &quot;Adventure&quot; on 30 July. On 31 July the carriers launched their airstrikes, with &quot;Victorious&quot; launching 20 Albacores escorted by 12 Fulmars against Kirkenes, while &quot;Furious&quot; launched nine Sorwdfish and nine Albacores escorted by 6 Fulmars against Petsamo (now Pechanga, Russia). The attack against Kirkenes encountered heavy air opposition, with 11 Albacores and 2 Fulmars being shot down, while the attack on Petsamo lost another Albacore and two Fulmars.

During August, &quot;Victorious&quot; embarked 817 and 832 Squadrons, both equipped with Albacores to replace 827 and 828 Squadrons. From 24 to 30 August 1941, &quot;Victorious&quot; formed part of the distant escort force for the eight merchant ships of Operation Dervish, the first Arctic convoy of the war as they sailed from Iceland to Arkhangelsk, and then covered the aircraft carrier which was delivering Hurricanes to Murmansk (Operation Strength). On the return journey, &quot;Victorious&quot; launched attacks on 12 September against shipping in Vestfjorden, claiming two merchant ships sunk, including the Norwegian Hurtigruten coastal steamer &quot;Barøy&quot;, and against the Glomfjord hydro-electric power plant, an aluminium factory and a radio station. No opposition was encountered. On 8 October, &quot;Victorious&quot; carried out another attack against shipping off Norway, with her Albacores damaging two merchant ships with bombs.

In November 1941, decrypted German Enigma signals indicated a break-out into the Atlantic by the German warships &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; and &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. &quot;Victorious&quot; was deployed to Iceland with the battleships in response, working with the American battleships and , and cruisers and to patrol the Denmark Strait in order to intercept any breakout. While Adolf Hitler cancelled the planned sortie on 17 November, &quot;Victorious&quot; continued patrols with the Home Fleet to stop any breakout, often in very poor weather, until the end of 1941.

On 19 February 1942, &quot;Victorious&quot; left Scapa Flow in company with the battleship , the cruiser and seven destroyers to attack shipping in the Tromsø region, but on 21 February an RAF Coastal Command aircraft spotted the German cruisers &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; on passage to Norway, and the British force was diverted to try and intercept the German ships, which turned back towards Germany on being sighted. On the night of 22/23 February &quot;Victorious&quot; launched two forces of 10 and 7 Albacores to search for and attack &quot;Scheer&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; but they failed to locate their targets in conditions of poor visibility. Three of the Albacores were lost during the operation. The German force was not unscathed, as &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; was torpedoed by the British submarine , sustaining damage that took months to repair. 

In March 1942, the threat posed by &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, now based in Northern Norway, resulted in the Home Fleet providing a strong covering force, including &quot;Victorious&quot;, for the concurrent Arctic convoys PQ 12 (out-bound) and QP 8 (return). On 6 March 1942, &quot;Tirpitz&quot; and three destroyers sortied from Trondheim to attack the two convoys in Operation Sportpalast. On 7 March 1942, the German destroyer &quot;Friedrich Ihn&quot; encountered the Soviet freighter &quot; Izhora&quot;, a straggler from QP 8. The freighter managed to report by radio that she was under attack by a surface ship before being sunk, informing the British that a German force was at sea and near the convoys. When signals intelligence indicated that &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was heading back to Norway, &quot;Victorious&quot; was ordered to search for and attack the German battleship. Six Albacores were flown off &quot;Victorious&quot; on 0640 hr on 9 March to search for &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, followed by a strike force of 12 torpedo-armed Albacores at 0732 hr. One of the search aircraft spotted &quot;Tirpitz&quot; and directed the strike force to its target, but when the Albacores attacked, the attack was unsuccessful, with all torpedoes missing and two Albacores being shot down. In the last week of March 1942, &quot;Victorious&quot; formed part of the covering force for convoy PQ 13 and QP 9. The carrier received significant weather damage from a force 9 gale with waves buckling the ship&#x27;s bow plating and forward bulkheads and requiring a short refit at Rosyth to repair the damage. &quot;Victorious&quot; continued to provide cover for Arctic Convoys for the rest April 1942, helping to provide cover for convoys PQ 14, and QP 10. From the end of April, until June, Anglo-American forces (including the US ships &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot;, and &quot;Wichita&quot;) covered convoys PQ 16, QP 12, PQ 17, and QP 13, after which &quot;Victorious&quot; returned to Scapa Flow.

The Arctic convoys had been suspended temporarily after the heavy losses suffered by Convoy PQ 17 when twenty-three out of thirty-six ships were sunk. This was after the convoy had been scattered in the belief that an attack was imminent by the German warships &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;, &quot;Lützow&quot;, &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot;, and &quot;Tirpitz&quot;.

===Pedestal===

The suspension of the Arctic convoys released &quot;Victorious&quot; to take part in a &quot;last chance&quot; attempt to resupply Malta – Operation Pedestal. Malta-bound Convoy WS 21S departed Britain on 3 August 1942 escorted by &quot;Victorious&quot; with and cruisers , &quot;Kenya&quot; and &quot;Manchester&quot;. Exercises (Operation Berserk) were performed with aircraft carriers , &quot;Furious&quot;, &quot;Eagle&quot; and &quot;Argus&quot; to improve operational techniques.

&quot;Pedestal&quot; began on 10 August 1942 and involved a great array of ships in several coordinated groups; two battleships, four aircraft carriers, seven cruisers and thirty two destroyers. Some of the carriers were transporting aircraft for Malta&#x27;s defence and fourteen merchant ships carried supplies. On 12 August 1942 &quot;Victorious&quot; was slightly damaged by an attack from Italian bombers. &quot;Eagle&quot; was less fortunate, being torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat on her return journey to Gibraltar. Ultimately &quot;Pedestal&quot; was a success for the allies: supplies, including oil and reinforcing Supermarine Spitfires allowed Malta to hold out, albeit at the cost of the loss of nine merchant ships, one aircraft carrier, two cruisers, and a destroyer.

In September 1942, &quot;Victorious&quot; was taken in hand for a refit that included the installation of an aircraft direction room. After trials, she was ready to participate in the North African landings.

===Operation Torch===

In November 1942, &quot;Victorious&quot; took part in the North African landings. Operation Torch, which involved 196 ships of the Royal Navy and 105 of the United States Navy, landed about 107,000 Allied soldiers. Ultimately successful, Operation Torch was the precursor to the later invasions of Sicily, Italy and France. &quot;Victorious&quot; provided air cover during the landings and made air attacks at Algiers and Fort Duree. Four of her Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters landed at Blida airfield to accept its surrender.

She left for Scapa Flow on 18 November and, while en route, Fairey Albacores of 817 Squadron depth charged off Cape Finisterre. The submarine&#x27;s structure was badly damaged and she was scuttled; surviving crew were rescued by HMS &quot;Opportune&quot;.

===Service with the US Navy===
 was sunk and was badly damaged at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, leaving the United States Navy with only one fleet carrier, , operational in the Pacific. In late December 1942, &quot;Victorious&quot; was loaned to the US Navy after an American plea for carrier reinforcement. Whilst in US service she was assigned the radio call sign &quot;Robin&quot; and was informally known as &quot;USS Robin&quot; tongue-in-cheek. After crossing the Atlantic from Greenock, via the Royal Naval Dockyard on the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda, to refit in the United States at the Norfolk Navy Yard during January, 1943. Her Fairey Albacore torpedo-bombers were replaced with Grumman Avengers, requiring the arrestor wires to be strengthened. A new &quot;7 wire&quot; was added on an extension to the aft-end of the flight deck, which increased deck space. &quot;Victorious&quot; was also equipped with the US Navy YB-type aircraft-homing system, TBS (Talk Between Ships) system, surface- and air-search radars, a vertical plotting board, and American cypher machines. Additional 20mm and 40mm anti-aircraft guns were fitted, along with American Mark 51 fire-control directors. A control station was added to the hangar deck, and a new fire-suppression system for the crew spaces. &quot;Victorious&quot; passed through the Panama Canal on 14 February to operate with United States forces in the Pacific. Her crew suffered an outbreak of diphtheria and medical supplies were dropped to her by air on 21 February.

&quot;Victorious&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor in March 1943 and was fitted with heavier arrester wires as RN wires had proved too light for the Grumman Avenger aircraft. Additional AA guns were also fitted. She sailed for the south-west Pacific, arriving at Nouméa, New Caledonia, on 17 May to form Carrier Division 1 with USS &quot;Saratoga&quot;. She sortied immediately for a week with Task Force 14, including &quot;Saratoga&quot; and battleships &quot;North Carolina&quot;, &quot;Massachusetts&quot;, and &quot;Indiana&quot;, sweeping against reported Japanese fleet activity, but without contact. Six aircraft were lost to accidents. Rear Admiral DeWitt Ramsey, commanding the division, carried out evaluation exercises and patrol sweeps in June and determined that &quot;Victorious&quot; had superior fighter control but handled Avenger aircraft poorly because of their weight. Accordingly, he transferred 832 Squadron FAA to the &quot;Saratoga&quot; and US Carrier Air Group 3 to the &quot;Victorious&quot;. Thereafter, &quot;Victorious&quot;″s primary role was fighter cover and &quot;Saratoga&quot; mainly handled strikes. 

On 27 June, TF14 was redesignated Task Group 36.3 and sailed to provide cover for the invasion of New Georgia (part of Operation Cartwheel). &quot;Victorious&quot; spent the next 28 days continuously in combat operations at sea, a record for a British carrier, steaming 12,223 miles at an average speed over and launching 614 sorties. Returning to Nouméa on 25 July, &quot;Victorious&quot; was recalled home. Though the Japanese had four carriers to Ramsey&#x27;s two, it seemed clear that they were not intending to press their advantage and the first two carriers of the new &quot;Essex&quot; class had arrived at Pearl Harbor well ahead of schedule. &quot;Victorious&quot; left for Pearl Harbor on 31 July, leaving behind her Avengers as replacements for &quot;Saratoga&quot;, sailing in company with battleship &quot;Indiana&quot; and launching 165 anti submarine sweeps en route. She also carried US pilots finishing their tours as well as two Japanese POWs. After a brief stop in San Diego, &quot;Victorious&quot; passed through the Panama Canal on 26 August and arrived at Norfolk Navy Yard 1 September, where specialized US equipment was removed. Returning home, she arrived at Greenock on the Clyde on 26 September 1943 where aircraft and stores were discharged awaiting refit.

===Attack on &quot;Tirpitz&quot;===
From December 1943 until March 1944, &quot;Victorious&quot; was under refit at Liverpool, where new radar was fitted. At the end of March, &quot;Victorious&quot; with &quot;Anson&quot; and &quot;Duke of York&quot; formed Force 1, covering the passage of Convoy JW 58. On 2 April 1944, Force 1 joined with Force 2, composed of the aging carrier and the escort carriers , , , and as well as numerous cruisers and destroyers. The combined force launched an attack (Operation Tungsten) on the in Altafjord, Norway. This involved Barracudas in two waves, hitting the battleship fourteen times and strafing the ship&#x27;s defences. Although near-misses caused flooding and there was serious damage to the superstructure, the ship&#x27;s armour was not penetrated. Nonetheless, the attack put &quot;Tirpitz&quot; out of action for some months. The Task Force returned to Scapa Flow three days later.

&quot;Victorious&quot; was to participate in three further attacks on &quot;Tirpitz&quot;, in April and May (Operations Planet, Brawn, and Tiger Claw), but these were cancelled due to bad weather and anti-shipping strikes were substituted. On 30 May, an acoustic torpedo attack by against &quot;Victorious&quot; failed and subsequently she made more shipping attacks off Norway (Operation Lombard).

===Eastern Fleet===

In June 1944, &quot;Victorious&quot;, in company with HMS &quot;Indomitable&quot;, left British waters to join the Eastern Fleet at Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), where she arrived on 5 July. The Eastern Fleet, after a quiet period of trade protection and relative vulnerability, was now being reinforced with ships released from the Atlantic and Mediterranean, in preparation for offensive action against the Japanese.

After a short preparatory period, &quot;Victorious&quot; took part in a sequence of air attacks against Japanese installations. The first was Operation Crimson on 25 July, a joint attack with HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; on airfields near Sabang in Sumatra. In late August, she provided air cover for Eastern Fleet ships that were providing air-sea rescue facilities for US Army aircraft during air attacks on Sumatra (Operation Boomerang). On 29 August, in company with HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; and escorted by HMS &quot;Howe&quot;, &quot;Victorious&quot; made air strikes on Padang, Indaroeng and Emmahaven (Operation Banquet). After a short pause, on 18 September, &quot;Victorious&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; attacked railway yards at Sigli in Sumatra followed by photo-reconnaissance of the Nicobar Islands (Operation Light). During &quot;Light&quot;, there was a &quot;friendly fire&quot; attack on HMS &quot;Spirit&quot;, fortunately without causing any casualties.

At the end of September, &quot;Victorious&quot; had a short interval at Bombay for repairs to her steering gear to remedy problems that had arisen during Operation Light. She rejoined the Eastern Fleet on 6 October. The next operation, &quot;Millet&quot;, was her last with the Eastern Fleet. On 17 October, she launched attacks on the Nicobar Islands and Nancowry harbour, with HMS &quot;Indomitable&quot; and escorted by HMS &quot;Renown&quot;. Enemy air attacks destroyed four aircraft and damaged five more. During early November, &quot;Victorious&quot; returned to Bombay for more work on her steering as more problems had arisen during &quot;Millet&quot;.

===British Pacific Fleet===

====Sumatra====
The British Pacific Fleet (BPF) was formed at Trincomalee on 22 November 1944 from elements of the Eastern Fleet and &quot;Victorious&quot; was transferred to the new fleet. From November 1944 until January 1945 the BPF stayed in the Indian Ocean, training and gaining experience that they would need when working with the United States Navy. &quot;Victorious&quot;, however, remained under repair at Bombay until January 1945 and missed raids on oil refineries at Pangkalan Brandan (Operation Robson).

In early January 1945, she was available for Operation Lentil, a repeat raid on the oil refineries at Pangkalan Brandan with HM Ships &quot;Indomitable&quot; and &quot;Implacable&quot;. Further raids on Japanese oil and port installations in Sumatra were made on 16 January. By late January, the BPF had finally quit Ceylon and was en route to its new home base in Sydney. The voyage was interrupted on 24 January for another series of raids, this time on Pladjoe and Manna in south west Sumatra (Operation Meridian) during which there was little opposition from Japanese aircraft. This was followed on 29 January by unsuccessful attacks on oil installations at Soengi-Gerong. This time, the Japanese attempted air attacks on the British fleet but these were beaten off. Total aircraft losses by all carriers were 16 aircraft in action and another 25 lost by ditching or on landing. Nine Fleet Air Arm pilots captured by the Japanese were executed in April 1945.

====Okinawa====

In early February, &quot;Victorious&quot; joined Task Force 113 (TF113) at Sydney to prepare for service with the US 5th Fleet. At the end of the month, TF113 left Sydney for their forward base at Manus Island, north of New Guinea, and then continued, joining the 5th US Fleet at Ulithi on 25 March as Task Force 57 (TF57), supporting the American assault on Okinawa. The task allocated to the British force was to neutralise airfields in the Sakishima Gunto. From late March until 25 May, the British carriers &quot;Victorious&quot;, &quot;Illustrious&quot; (later replaced by &quot;Formidable&quot;), &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; formed the 1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Philip Vian and they were in action against airfields on the Sakishima Islands (Operations Iceberg I and Iceberg II) and Formosa (Operation Iceberg Oolong).

The British carriers were attacked by &quot;kamikaze&quot; suicide aircraft and &quot;Victorious&quot; was hit on 4 and 9 May and near-missed on 1 April, but her armoured flight deck resisted the worst of the impacts. She remained on station and was back in operation within hours on each occasion, despite damage to an aircraft lift and steam piping in her superstructure. Three men were killed and 19 of the ship&#x27;s company were injured.
====Japan====
After May 1945 the British Pacific Fleet withdrew to Sydney and Manus for refits and, in the cases of &quot;Victorious&quot;, &quot;Formidable&quot; and &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, for repairs to battle damage. The British fleet rendezvoused with the US 3rd Fleet on 16 July and became effectively absorbed into the American structure as a part of TF38 for the &quot;softening up&quot; of Japanese resistance within their home islands.

During the second half of July, aircraft from &quot;Victorious&quot; took part in a series of attacks on Japanese shipping, transport and airbases on Honshu and around the Inland Sea. In one notable attack in July, aircraft of 849 Squadron from &quot;Victorious&quot; located the Japanese escort carrier &quot;Kaiyo&quot; at Beppu Bay in Kyūshū and attacked her, inflicting serious damage that kept the ship out of the remainder of the war. In the main, however, British aircraft were excluded from the actions against the major Japanese naval bases; the Americans, for political reasons, preferred to reserve these targets for themselves.

====War&#x27;s end====
&quot;Victorious&quot; was scheduled to leave for Manus Island with Task Force 37 (TF37) on 10 August 1945 to prepare for the anticipated invasion of Japan (Operation Olympic), and actually left on August 12, then proceeding to Sydney. The surrender of Japan on 15 August rendered the invasion moot. The British Pacific Fleet (BPF) commander had agreed to stay for one more day&#x27;s operations, but the British arrangements could not stretch to a further delay and fuel shortages were insurmountable. The steering faults that had hampered &quot;Victorious&quot; in the Indian Ocean in late 1944 are believed to have continued.

On 31 August, &quot;Victorious&quot;″s ship&#x27;s company took part in the Victory Parade in Sydney.

==Post-war==

&quot;Victorious&quot; left Australia in September 1945, arrived back in Britain on 27 October and undertook three trips to collect servicemen and war brides of British servicemen from Australia and the Far East. In the winter of 1946–47, the first deck trials with the Hawker Sea Fury (Mark 10) took place aboard &quot;Victorious&quot;, leading to its approval for carrier operations in early 1947.

&quot;Victorious&quot; was reduced to the reserve at Devonport on 15 January 1947, on completion of her trooping duties. From June that year she was modified at Portsmouth Dockyard with additional accommodation and classrooms and on 1 October 1947, joined the Home Fleet Training Squadron, replacing the battleship . In July 1948, &quot;Victorious&quot; was deployed to Portland Harbour in support of the sailing events at the 1948 London Olympic Games. In 1949 she was refitted at Rosyth and took part in several training cruises and Home Fleet exercises.

The ship was extensively reconstructed and modernised at Portsmouth Dockyard between 1950 and 1958. This took over eight years because of frequent design changes to allow for new technologies. The cost of the reconstruction increased from 5 million pounds to 30 million pounds creating what was in many respects a new ship. Her hull was widened, deepened, and lengthened; her machinery was replaced with Foster-Wheeler boilers; her hangar height was increased; new armament of 3 inch (76 mm) guns was installed; a fully angled flight deck (of 8 degrees) and steam catapults were added. Her radar equipment was extensively altered to include up to date equipment, and included the first type 984 3-D radar system to be installed on a ship. While it was hoped she could operate a full air group of 50 aircraft, the rapid increase in size of the jets coming into service limited her to operating no more than 28 aircraft (including helicopters).
On 25 September 1958 Commander J. D. Russell drowned in his Supermarine Scimitar after a failed attempt to land on &quot;Victorious&quot; for the first time after her refit. Although the landing hook engaged the arrestor wire, the wire itself snapped due to improper rigging and the aircraft then rolled slowly over the side. It sank very slowly, but the plane-guard helicopter crew couldn&#x27;t release the pilot, and it was seen that Cdr Russell had opened his canopy and then closed it again, possibly an effect of gravity on the heavy frame. The other seven Scimitars in the stream diverted away to Yeovilton.

In 1960, after recommissioning into the Home Fleet on 14 January 1958, with work-ups and deployments in the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, she portrayed both herself and HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; during the filming of the British film &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot;. This was despite post-war modifications significantly altering her appearance – the addition of an angled deck and a Type 984 &quot;searchlight&quot; radar. The actor Kenneth More who had served aboard &quot;Victorious&quot; as a junior officer, played a fictitious Admiralty Director of Operations. He is shown giving the order to detach &quot;Victorious&quot; from Convoy WS 8B, which was forming in the River Clyde in order to move almost 20,000 troops to the Middle East.

&quot;Victorious&quot; took part in Operation Vantage in support of Kuwait in July 1961. Later in 1961 she would sail to join the Far East Fleet. In 1964, she provided support for the newly independent state of Malaysia against territorial expansion by its neighbour, Indonesia. Her passage through the Sunda Strait caused the Sunda Straits Crisis between August and September 1964, which was settled peacefully when Indonesia agreed to allow &quot;Victorious&quot; to return through the Lombok Strait. In April 1966 she departed again to serve with the Far East Fleet for a year, during which she proved capable of landing and then launching a US Navy Phantom F-4 from , returning to the UK for a refit period from June 1967.

General characteristics of &quot;Victorious&quot; after reconstruction.
=== Decommissioning ===

On 11 November 1967, after the completion of the 1967 refit and shortly before the start of what was intended as the ship&#x27;s final commission, there was a relatively small fire, which was rapidly extinguished, in the chief petty officers&#x27; mess (resulting in one death and two hospitalisations). Although damage was relatively minor, the fire coincided with a reduction of the defence budget and a manpower shortage for the Royal Navy. Together with the 1966 decision to phase out fixed-wing naval aviation, it was decided at very short notice not to recommission &quot;Victorious&quot;. Her captain was told of this just one day before the scheduled recommissioning ceremony. The ceremony was held by the ship&#x27;s crew anyway as a &quot;wake&quot; for the ship. She was paid off in 1968 and placed on the Disposal List in 1969. She was sold later that year to British Shipbreakers and towed on 13 July 1969 to Faslane Naval Base, where she was broken up.

<text>Wilhelm Carl Josef Cuno (2 July 1876 – 3 January 1933) was a German businessman and politician who was the chancellor of Germany from 1922 to 1923 for a total of 264 days. His tenure included the beginning of the occupation of the Ruhr by French and Belgian troops and the period in which inflation in Germany accelerated towards hyperinflation. 

After beginning his career in the civil service, Cuno helped organize Germany&#x27;s food supply during the early years of World War I before he went to work for the Hamburg America shipping company in 1917. Because of his economic expertise, he was involved in a number of important post-war negotiations with the victorious Allies. When he was appointed chancellor of Germany in November 1922, he formed a &quot;business ministry&quot; made up primarily of men who were, like himself, political independents. His plans to handle the war reparations issue and stabilise the currency were derailed by the French and Belgian occupation of the Ruhr in January 1923. Cuno instituted a policy of passive resistance and provided financial assistance to the workers and firms affected by it. The payments, made possible primarily by printing money, began the runup to the German hyperinflation of 1923. 

After his government resigned in August 1923, Cuno returned to the Hamburg America Line.

==Early life==
Wilhelm Cuno was born on 2 July 1876 in Suhl, in what was then Prussian Saxony and is now in Thuringia. He was the son of the administrative civil servant August George Wilhelm Cuno (1848–1915) and his wife Catherina Elisabeth Theresia, née Daske (1852–1878). He studied law in Berlin and Heidelberg and was awarded a Juris Doctor. He was a member of K.D.St.V. Arminia Heidelberg, a Catholic student fraternity that is a member of the Union of Catholic German Student Fraternities.

In 1906, Cuno, a Roman Catholic, married Martha Berta Wirtz (born 1879), daughter of Hamburg merchant Hugo Wirtz. They had three sons and two daughters.

==Early career==
Cuno was employed by the federal Treasury Department in 1907, initially as , was promoted in 1910 to and then in 1912 to . His tasks mainly involved preparing parliamentary bills and presenting them to the Reichstag.

During World War I, Cuno was involved in organizing food supplies for all of Germany, first directing the Imperial Grain Agency from its inception in early 1915 until July 1916. It was responsible for the collection and distribution of grain and flour throughout Germany. He then was attached to State Secretary (i.e. Minister) Adolf Tortilowicz von Batocki-Friebe to help organize the War Office of Food (&quot;Kriegsernährungsamt&quot;). In late 1916, Cuno was put in charge of the department of war-related economic issues at the Treasury Department.

At the request of Albert Ballin, general director of the Hamburg America Line (HAPAG), Cuno quit the civil service to join the shipping company as a director in November 1917. After Ballin committed suicide in November 1918 in despair over Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I, Cuno was promoted to HAPAG&#x27;s general director in December.

As an economic expert, Cuno participated in the post-war negotiations on the armistice, reparations and peace terms and in other international conferences, including the Genoa Economic and Financial Conference. He left it in protest after Germany signed the Treaty of Rapallo, which normalised relations with the Soviet Union. In 1921 and 1922, Cuno was an important negotiator in talks between German shipping firms and the government regarding compensation for the merchant ships delivered to the Allies under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.

In 1920, Cuno led HAPAG into an alliance with United American Lines, helping to re-establish HAPAG as a passenger line. He also unofficially represented Germany&#x27;s foreign policy interests during his travels abroad.

==Chancellor==

Cuno rejected several proposals to assume the post of foreign minister in the autumn of 1922 and minister of finance after Matthias Erzberger&#x27;s resignation in 1920, but he agreed to form a cabinet after the resignation of Joseph Wirth&#x27;s second cabinet. Cuno was appointed chancellor on 22 November 1922 by presidential decree and without a vote in the Reichstag. He was the first chancellor in the Weimar Republic who was not a member of a party. Politically, he was quite far from the president, Social Democrat Friedrich Ebert, who selected him as chancellor. Cuno had a somewhat aloof position towards the Republic and its parliamentary system. He held the Reichstag in fairly low esteem and felt the bickering between the parties to be distasteful. Cuno formed a government composed of six non-party economists plus two members each of the German People&#x27;s Party, German Democratic Party and Centre Party, and one from the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party. The government was referred to alternatively as a &quot;business ministry&quot;, an &quot;economic government&quot; or &quot;cabinet of personalities&quot;, emphasizing that it was not the result of a coalition between the parliamentary parties.

Hopes were high that a government of experts, led by a man with excellent connections abroad, would make headway in the difficult talks with the Allies. They were, however, disappointed. Cuno&#x27;s plan to settle the reparations issue and to stabilise the German mark in the foreign exchange market was rejected by the Allies at the urging of French prime minister and foreign minister Raymond Poincaré. When Germany defaulted on its shipments of wood and coal (made as reparations in lieu of the gold currency that it lacked), the French declared it to be a deliberate breach of the agreements and on 11 January 1923 ordered its troops (later joined by Belgians) to occupy the Ruhr. The move, widely seen as illegal even outside Germany, caused the outraged Cuno government to call for passive resistance. Reparation shipments to France and Belgium were stopped, the mines were told not to make any more deliveries to the countries, and civil servants and railroad personnel were instructed to disobey orders by the occupation authorities.

The Ruhr economy, the industrial heartland of Germany, came almost to a complete stop. Financial support payments by the German government to the Ruhr businesses and to the inhabitants of the occupied zone affected by firm closures, deportations and arrests quickly added up to vast sums, mostly financed by printing money. This caused inflation to increase rapidly and the mark to go into free fall.

Attempts by the government to resume talks about reparations in May and June 1923 failed as Poincaré refused to negotiate unless passive resistance was ended first. A wave of strikes against the government began in August 1923. On 12 August 1923, Cuno and his cabinet resigned in the face of a vote of no-confidence initiated by the Social Democratic Party (SPD).

In social policy, Cuno&#x27;s time as chancellor witnessed the passage in June 1923 of a law that established an insurance system for laborers and employees (as noted by one study) “that are engaged exclusively or principally in mining or allied industries.” 

==Later life==
Cuno retired from politics and returned to serve as a director at HAPAG. In 1926 he once again became its director general. He was involved in negotiations about the release of German property impounded in the U.S. during the war and in working towards the merger with the Norddeutsche Lloyd shipping company, which took place in 1930.

During the 1925 German presidential election, Cuno was outspoken in his support for Paul von Hindenburg, rather than the candidate of the Centre Party, Wilhelm Marx.

In 1932, Cuno joined the industrialist Wilhelm Keppler to advise Adolf Hitler economically.

Cuno died suddenly on 3 January 1933 at Aumühle near Hamburg.

<text>Wilhelm Marx (15 January 1863 – 5 August 1946) was a German judge, politician and member of the Catholic Centre Party. During the Weimar Republic he was the chancellor of Germany twice, from 1923 to 1925 and from 1926 to 1928, and served briefly as the minister president of Prussia in 1925. With a total of 3 years and 73 days, he was the longest-serving chancellor during the Weimar Republic.

After being a member of the Reichstag of the German Empire for ten years, Marx was elected in 1919 to the Weimar National Assembly that drafted Germany&#x27;s new constitution and then in 1920 to the Republic&#x27;s Reichstag where he served until not long before the Nazi takeover. As chancellor he helped steer Germany through the crisis year of 1923 with its hyperinflation and rebellious state governments. The following year his government worked to end the immediate crisis over Germany&#x27;s war reparations and then in 1927 successfully brought Germany into the League of Nations. His terms in office saw a number of progressive pieces of legislation pass, including family allowances for state employees and comprehensive unemployment insurance.

After resigning from the Reichstag in 1932, Marx worked with various civic organizations. He remained in Germany through the Nazi era and died in Bonn in 1946.

==Early life==
Marx was born in 1863 in Cologne to the Catholic school rector Johann Marx (1822–1882) and his wife, Gertrude (1826–1909). He had a sister, Barbara, who later headed the Cologne Ursulines.

Marx was awarded his secondary school certificate (Abitur) at the Marzellengymnasium in 1881. He then studied jurisprudence at the University of Bonn from 1881 to 1884. As a student he became a member of Catholic Student Association Arminia of Bonn.

Marx married Johanna Verkoyen (1871–1946) in 1891. They had three sons and a daughter. One of the sons was killed in World War I.

==Legal career==
In 1888 he passed the second state exam for the Prussian civil service and began working as an assessor in Cologne and Waldbröl and later at the land registry in Simmern. In 1894 he became a judge at Elberfeld, in 1904 state court judge (&quot;)&quot; at Cologne, in 1907 superior state court judge (&quot;)&quot; at Düsseldorf, in January 1921 state court president (&quot;)&quot; in Limburg an der Lahn and on 27 September 1921 senate president of the superior state court (&quot;Kammergericht)&quot; Berlin on the same day that he was elected president of the Reichstag parliamentary group of the Centre Party.

Prior to 1919, under the German Empire that was dominated by Protestant Prussia, his religion and political activities were a handicap for his career as a judge.

==Early political career==
Marx started his political activities in Elberfeld, where he became active in the Centre Party. From 1899 to 1918, he was a member of the Prussian House of Representatives, the lower chamber of the state parliament (). From 1899 to 1904 he was the head of the Elberfeld Centre Party and from 1906 to 1919 deputy head of the party in the Prussian Rhine Province. In 1907 he became the chairman of the Düsseldorf Centre Party and in 1910 presided over the Augsburg Catholics Day. From 1910 to 1918 he was a member of the Reichstag for Cologne district six. In 1911 he founded a Catholic school organization in Düsseldorf to fight against the secularisation of the German school system.

Marx supported the Reichstag Peace Resolution of 1917 that called for a negotiated peace without the territorial gains that were popular among Rhineland Centre Party members. Following the end of World War I and the collapse of the German Empire, Marx was elected in 1919 to the Weimar National Assembly that drew up the Weimar Constitution. He was then a member of the Weimar Reichstag from 1920 until 1932. Marx condemned the German Revolution that overthrew the Hohenzollern monarchy but supported the new Weimar Republic. The Weimar Constitution explicitly made the exercise of civil rights independent of one&#x27;s religious beliefs, unlike the imperial constitution, which did not mention religion at all. Marx opposed separatism in the Rhineland and argued against the creation of a Rhineland Republic in December 1918. In the summer of 1919, Marx was one of the few Centre Party members to support German acceptance of the Treaty of Versailles, since he feared that failure to do so would result in French annexation of the occupied Rhineland.

After the assassination of Matthias Erzberger by the right-wing terrorist group Organisation Consul in 1921, Marx became the head of the Centre Party&#x27;s Reichstag parliamentary group on 27 September 1921 and, on 17 January 1922, party chairman. He supported Centre Party Chancellor Joseph Wirth in his &quot;fulfillment policy&quot; () which attempted to comply as far as possible with the Treaty of Versailles, notably the reparation demands of the Allies, in order to show that it would be impossible to meet them. Independent Chancellor Wilhelm Cuno received Marx&#x27;s help in mobilizing civil disobedience against the Occupation of the Ruhr by France and Belgium. Marx then helped replace Cuno&#x27;s cabinet with the grand coalition headed by Gustav Stresemann of the German People&#x27;s Party (DVP). When Stresemann&#x27;s government fell in November 1923, Reich President Friedrich Ebert requested that Marx form a government.

==Chancellor==
=== First term, 1923–1925 ===
On 30 November 1923, Marx formed his minority first cabinet based on the Centre Party, the right-liberal German People&#x27;s Party (DVP), the conservative Catholic Bavarian People&#x27;s Party (BVP) and the center-left liberal German Democratic Party (DDP). The financial and economic situation of the Reich at the time was dire – Germany&#x27;s hyperinflation peaked in late 1923 – and the central government&#x27;s authority was challenged by right- and left-wing state governments as well as by separatism in the Rhineland. Marx pushed through the Enabling Act of December 1923 that gave his government the authority &quot;to take such measures as it deems necessary and urgent in view of the plight of the people and the Reich&quot;. The government&#x27;s achievements included stabilizing the currency following the introduction of the Rentenmark, fiscal consolidation, the resolution of the conflict between the Reich and Bavaria&#x27;s right-wing government and de-escalation of tensions in the occupied Rhineland territories. In January 1924 the Emminger Reform replaced the system of trial by jury in Germany with a mixed system of career and lay judges that still exists today. 

In social policy, Marx&#x27;s government presided over the introduction of family allowances for state employees and the issuing of the Federal Social Welfare Decree on February the 13th 1924. This was aimed at tackling the causes of destitution and helping all those in need. Poor law residence was replaced by usual residence, and the federal statutes (as noted by one study) “established the principle that persons who could not provide minimum subsistence for themselves and their dependents, and who did not receive help from others, were entitled to proper maintenance including food, clothing, housing, medical aid in case of sickness, and the aid required in order to recover working capacity.&quot; Apart from the basic relief rate for destitute persons in general, there were higher rates for certain groups including social insurance pensioners, war invalids and survivors, and victims of inflation. 

Following the May 1924 election, the second Marx cabinet was formed on 3 June. It was once again a minority government made up this time of the Centre Party, DVP and DDP; it lasted until December 1924. Its focus was on relations with the Allies and on regaining control of the occupied territories in the west. In August the government signed up to the Dawes Plan which settled the diplomatic crisis over Germany&#x27;s war reparations. After the December 1924 Reichstag elections, Marx was unable to form a cabinet and resigned on 15 December. He remained in office as caretaker until 15 January 1925 when the independent Hans Luther took over as chancellor.

=== Between chancellorships, 1925–1926 ===
In February 1925 Marx became Minister President of Prussia following a call by the Centre Party in the state parliament. On 18 March his party nominated him for the presidential election following the death of Reich President Friedrich Ebert. In the first round of voting, Marx was the candidate of the Centre Party and, in the second round, of the entire Weimar Coalition (Centre, DDP and Social Democrats). Marx received close to 4 million votes in the first round but in the runoff was defeated by Paul von Hindenburg. His loss was attributed to the fact that the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party, a sister party of the Centre, endorsed Hindenburg as a protest against the Marx&#x27;s cooperation with the Social Democrats. 

Some also attributed Marx&#x27;s loss to the candidature of Ernst Thälmann of the Communist Party of Germany, who did not drop out in the second round. However, historian Peter Fritzsche rejected this view, calling the claim &quot;far-fetched&quot; and arguing that &quot;given the explicit enmity of this party toward the Weimar &quot;capitalist state,&quot; it would have been completely unrealistic to expect the KPD to support the candidate of the Weimar system&quot;. Fritsche instead found that the BVP&#x27;s endorsement of Hindenburg was crucial to Marx&#x27;s defeat.

Marx lost by 13.7 million to Hindenburg&#x27;s 14.6 million votes. In April Otto Braun replaced Marx as Prussian Minister President. Marx had resigned after he was unable to form a working cabinet.

=== Second term, 1926–1928 ===

Marx considered leaving politics, but on 26 January 1926 he accepted an appointment as Minister of Justice and Minister for the Occupied Territories in the second cabinet of Hans Luther. After Luther&#x27;s government fell, Gustav Stresemann suggested Marx as chancellor, and Hindenburg appointed him on 17 May 1926. His cabinet was formed from the Centre Party, DVP, DDP and BVP.

Even though Luther&#x27;s government had fallen because of his decree allowing the old imperial flag to be flown alongside the Republic&#x27;s in certain locations, Marx did not rescind it. In June 1926 a referendum to expropriate the assets of the former ruling houses of Germany without compensation failed to reach the fifty percent needed to pass. Marx&#x27;s cabinet survived the referendum&#x27;s failure and shortly afterwards succeeded in bringing Germany into the League of Nations. He resigned as chancellor on 17 December 1926 when he lost an SPD-initiated vote of no confidence on the issue of the recently uncovered clandestine military relations between the Reichswehr and the Soviet Union.

In January 1927 Marx formed a new government with the same parties as before but with the addition of the right-wing German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP). The fourth and final Marx cabinet extended the 1922 Law for the Protection of the Republic, although in order to gain the DNVP&#x27;s support the extension was limited to two years. It also passed a law on working hours (14 April 1927) as well as the Law on Employment Services and Unemployment Insurance (&quot;)&quot; of 16 July 1927 which established a comprehensive unemployment insurance system. The government sought to standardize locally administered poor relief payments by fixing them in line with the prices of essential goods, and Germany became the first major industrial nation to sign the Washington Agreement for extended maternity leave.

Although the coalition broke up over the issue of the School Law () and the blame was put on the DVP, it was mostly internal opposition within the Centre Party, notably by Joseph Wirth, Adam Stegerwald and Theodor von Guérard that resulted in the cabinet&#x27;s fall. Marx resigned on 12 June. After putting into action an emergency program, he was dismissed as chancellor by Hindenburg on 29 June 1928. In total, his four terms in office made him the longest-serving Reich chancellor of the Weimar Republic.

==Later life==
After the Centre Party&#x27;s poor performance at the polls in May 1928, Marx resigned as party chairman on 8 December 1928. He then focused on work for numerous associations and civil organizations. In 1932 he resigned his seat in the Reichstag and retired.

In 1933, under Nazi Germany, Marx was charged in the trial of the People&#x27;s Association for Catholic Germany, an organization which he had chaired, but the charge against him was dropped in 1935. After the end of World War II, he continued to live in Bonn, where he died in 1946. Marx is buried at the Melaten cemetery in Cologne.

<text>Hans Luther () (10 March 1879 – 11 May 1962) was a German politician and Chancellor of Germany for 482 days in 1925 to 1926. As Minister of Finance he helped stabilize the Mark during the hyperinflation of 1923. From 1930 to 1933, Luther was head of the Reichsbank and from 1933 to 1937 he served as German Ambassador to the United States.

==Early life==
Hans Luther was born in Berlin on 10 March 1879 into a Lutheran family as the son of Otto (1848–1912), a well-off merchant, and Wilhelmine Luther (née Hübner).

After attaining the &quot;Abitur&quot; at the Leibniz-Gymnasium/Berlin, Luther studied law at Geneva, Kiel and Berlin from 1897 to 1901. His teachers included Otto von Gierke, Franz von Liszt, Heinrich Brunner, Gustav von Schmoller and Hugo Preuss. In 1904, Luther was awarded a Dr.jur. for his dissertation &quot;Die Zuständigkeit des Bundesrats zur Entscheidung von Thronstreitigkeiten innerhalb des Deutschen Reiches&quot;. He passed the &quot;Assessor&quot; exam in 1906 and worked in the Prussian administration, in 1906/07 at the city council of Charlottenburg, now a part of Berlin.

Luther was married twice. From 1907–1924 to Gertrud (née Schmidt, 1880–1924) and from 1953 to Gertrud Sioli (née Mautz). He had three daughters from his first marriage.

==Political career==

===German Empire and local politics===
In 1907, Luther was elected to the Magdeburg city council where he increased the area assigned to Schreber garden tenfold and litigated against the regional potash industry for polluting the drinking water. From February 1913 to the summer of 1918, Luther was a member of the board of the &quot;Preußischer Städtetag&quot; (later Deutscher Städtetag). In the summer of 1918, he became &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot; (mayor) of Essen. During the Revolution he managed to convince the revolutionary workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; councils to cooperate with the city administration and to accept the mayor&#x27;s leading role. Ex-officio, as mayor of Essen, he was a member of the &quot;Vorläufiger Reichswirtschaftsrat&quot; from 1920.

===Weimar Republic and Reich politics===
During the creation of the cabinet of Wilhelm Cuno in November 1922, Luther was offered the &quot;Reichswirtschaftsministerium&quot; (Economic Affairs) and the &quot;Reichsinnenministerium&quot; (Interior) but he refused both. However, on 1 December 1922 he took over the &quot;Reichsministerium für Ernährung und Landwirtschaft&quot; (food and agriculture). His predecessor, Karl Müller had been forced to resign after only three days in office due to allegations about connections to Rhenish separatists. Luther remained in this office in the cabinet of Gustav Stresemann, focussing on ensuring food supplies for those groups of the population hardest hit by inflation.

When Streseman reshuffled his cabinet on 6 October 1923, Luther took over the Ministry of Finance and kept that portfolio in the two cabinets led by Wilhelm Marx which followed. Luther thus was in charge of the currency reform which ended the hyperinflation and introduced a new stable Mark. By 15 October, Luther presented a plan that combined elements of a reform by economist Karl Helfferich with ideas of Luther&#x27;s predecessor Rudolf Hilferding. With the help of the emergency law (&quot;Ermächtigungsgesetz&quot;) of 13 October 1923 which gave the government the power to issue decrees on financial and economic matters, the plan was implemented that same day, 15 October 1923. The restrictive monetary policy by Hjalmar Schacht at the Reichsbank helped to stabilize the currency, as did steps taken by Luther to close the budget deficit. On the revenue side, he pushed through three emergency tax hikes, brought forward due dates for taxes, increased prepayments of assessed taxes, raised the sales tax, taxed inflation gains and reorganized the financial burden sharing between Reich and Länder. On the spending side, Luther managed a drastic cut in personnel costs – by reducing the number of Reich employees by almost 25% over four months, a freeze on promotions and fixing public salaries at a level lower than that of 1913.

Having successfully stabilized the currency, Luther then was a member of the German delegation at the London conference of 1924 in July and August 1924, where he was in charge of trade policy and financial policy issues. On 30 August 1924, the Rentenmark was replaced as legal tender by the &quot;Reichsmark&quot;, a new gold-backed currency.

===Chancellor===

After the Reichstag elections of December 1924 the parties supporting the minority Marx cabinet were unable to agree on whether the coalition should be extended to include those on the left (SPD) or those on the right (DNVP), president Friedrich Ebert on 9 January 1925 asked the independent Luther to form a government. On 16 January, Luther presented his cabinet that combined features of a party-based government with one made up of experts/technocrats. Each of the coalition parties (Zentrum, BVP, DVP, DNVP) had one representative in the cabinet, the other positions were filled with civil servants who were either members of one of the parties or were politically close to it. Although the DDP was not a member of the coalition, Luther was able to keep Otto Gessler at the &quot;Reichswehrministerium&quot;.

When Ebert died on 28 February, Luther temporarily assumed the role of acting head of state pending the election of a successor. The following presidential election put some strains on the coalition supporting the cabinet. Luther tried to convince Walter Simons, president of the Reichsgericht, to ask the two candidates for the second round of voting to step aside and accept Simons as a compromise of the center. However, Simons refused and Paul von Hindenburg was elected.

During his relatively short period in office, Luther and his cabinet managed to accomplish the passage of several important laws and international treaties. In foreign trade, the one-sided most-favoured-nation clause that had governed trade between the Allies and Germany lapsed on 10 January 1925, thus reestablishing Germany&#x27;s sovereignty in trade policy. The tariff law came into force on 12 August 1925, setting up tariffs for industry and agriculture that were based on the tariff rates of the pre-war years. Trade treaties were negotiated with the UK, the Soviet Union, France, Spain and Italy. In domestic tax policy, a tax reform brought relief as taxes on income, capital and land transfer as well as bill stamp duty and sales tax were all lowered. In foreign policy, the cabinet negotiated the Treaty of Locarno with the UK, Belgium, France and Italy (October 1925), which paved the way for Germany&#x27;s membership in the League of Nations (September 1926). The ministers of the DNVP left the cabinet in protest over Locarno, forcing Luther to set up a new government that took office in January 1926. This government negotiated the &quot;Freundschafts- und Neutralitätsvertrag&quot; with the Soviet Union.

In social policy, a number of reforms to social insurance were carried out during Luther&#x27;s time as Chancellor. A decree promulgated by the Reich Minister of Labour in May 1925 extended accident insurance coverage to include eleven occupational diseases, a law of July 1925 extended workmen&#x27;s compensation coverage to all accidents from and to places of work, and vocational care was introduced that same month. In addition, a decree of May 1925 established compensation for occupational diseases.

Luther voluntarily decided to resign after a Reichstag majority censured him on 12 May 1926 after he had asked Hindenburg to issue the presidential &quot;Flaggen-Verordnung&quot; (5 May 1926), which ordered German embassies and consulates to display not just the official black-red-gold &quot;Reichsflagge&quot; but also the black-white-red &quot;Handelsflagge&quot; (trade flag). His successor was Wilhelm Marx.

===Further career===
Luther was elected to the supervisory board of the &quot;Reichsbahn&quot; in the summer of 1926. At the end of 1928 he left, to make room for a representative of the Free State of Prussia. In March 1929, he became a member of the board of directors of the &quot;Gemeinschaftsgruppe deutscher Hypothekenbanken&quot; (association of German mortgage banks). He also joined the DVP. In 1928/29, Luther was also active in the &quot;&quot; and became its founding president in January 1928. The institution worked on a reform of the federal structure of the Reich, notably the problem of the dominant position of Prussia compared to the other &quot;Länder&quot;.

On 11 March 1930, Luther was appointed as Hjalmar Schacht&#x27;s successor as president of the Reichsbank. To ensure his independence, he gave up all other offices and also left the DVP. Luther supported Heinrich Brüning&#x27;s deflation policy out of loyalty and conviction. During the crisis in German banking in June/July 1931, he stretched the envelope—both legally and in terms of the Reichsbank&#x27;s financial means—to help the banks repay the short-term loans called in by foreign creditors. Criticism by the banks including the demand for his resignation were without foundation and served mainly to hide the banks&#x27; responsibility for their own situation. On the evening of April 9, 1932 Hans Luther was shot at on the platform of the Potsdam station. He was injured at the shoulder. The assailants had written a letter before in which they criticized Luther&#x27;s monetary policy.

After the Nazis seized power in 1933, Luther acceded to a demand by Hitler and resigned his post on 16 March 1933. He was, however, offered the post of German ambassador to Washington which he accepted.

In 1933, Luther lectured at the Columbia University campus. Luther&#x27;s speech stressed Hitler&#x27;s &quot;peaceful intentions&quot; toward his European neighbors. Nicholas Murray Butler, Columbia&#x27;s president, rejected student appeals to cancel the invitation, calling the request &quot;illiberal&quot; and citing the need for academic freedom.

In 1937, he retired from active public service (&quot;im einstweiligen Ruhestand&quot;) and in 1942 retired fully.

Post-World War II, Luther was trustee of Merck Finck &amp; Co., a private bank in Munich, in 1948/49. He also served as a member of the supervisory board of the &quot;Bayerischen Hypotheken und Wechselbank&quot;. In 1952, the Munich &quot;Hochschule für politische Wissenschaften&quot; awarded him an honorary professorship. In 1952–1955, Luther was the chairman of the committee of experts on the territorial restructuring of the Federal Republic of Germany (&quot;Sachverständigen-Ausschuß für die Neugliederung des Bundesgebiets&quot;). In 1958, he became president of the reestablished &quot;Verein für das Deutschtum im Ausland&quot;.

He died in Düsseldorf on 11 May 1962.

<doc id="431040" wikidata="Q2815836" url="?curid=431040" title="2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade">
<text>The 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade was an armoured brigade of the Canadian Army that saw active service during World War II. The brigade was composed of the 6th, 10th and 27th Canadian Armoured regiments and saw service in northwest Europe, landing in Normandy on D-Day and remaining in combat up to Victory in Europe Day.
Soon after the 3rd Canadian Tank Brigade assumed the designation in summer 1943 of the original 2nd Canadian Tank Brigade, the new 2nd Tank was redesignated and reorganized as 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade. Although reorganized as an armoured brigade, no motor battalion served under its command. The brigade was assigned to the British 2nd Army in January 1944 to train for the upcoming amphibious assault in Normandy.

This formation rarely fought as an entity. Its primary role was infantry support and thus its regiments were usually individually tasked out to infantry units to participate in particular operations. One of the occasions when the Brigade did undertake an operation on its own, the Battle of Le Mesnil-Patry on 11 June 1944, ended with only a partial success and severe losses to the Canadians.

Following the landing in Normandy, the brigade fought at Caen, advanced across France and Belgium, and took part in operations in the Netherlands and Germany while supporting operations of the Canadian 1st Army and the British 2nd Army.

== Formation ==
* 6th Armoured Regiment (1st Hussars)
* 10th Armoured Regiment (The Fort Garry Horse)
* 27th Armoured Regiment (The Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment)
* &quot;C&quot; Squadron, 25th Armoured Delivery Regiment (The Elgin Regiment)

Formed as the 2nd Canadian Army Tank Brigade on 26 January 1942, this formation consisted of the 24th Army Tank Battalion (Les Voltigeurs de Québec) (replaced in June 1942 by the 20th Army Tank Regiment (16/22 Saskatchewan Horse)), 23rd Army Tank Battalion (The Halifax Rifles), and the 26th Army Tank Battalion (The Grey and Simcoe Foresters). Equipped with Ram II tanks, in the autumn of 1942 the brigade trained at the newly opened Meaford AFV range on Georgian Bay where the Halifax Rifles had the honour of conducting the first field exercise.

== European deployments ==
=== United Kingdom ===
In June 1943 the brigade was dispatched to the United Kingdom. The following month came an intensive inspection of the units of this brigade and of the 3rd Canadian Army Tank Brigade by Lieutenant-General Harry Crerar, the commander of I Canadian Corps. The purpose of the inspection was to determine which of the two brigades would remain on the order of battle since there was only room for one such formation. The brigade chosen was the 3rd with its component units of the 1st Hussars, Fort Garry Horse, and Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment.

The 3rd Canadian Army Tank Brigade was raised on 1 January 1943 following a reorganization of the Canadian Armoured Corps in Britain. It adopted the designation 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade (2 CAB) after it was selected by Lieutenant-General Crerar to remain on the order of battle. In August 1943 it was selected to be part of the D-Day invasion force in support of the units of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division.

=== D-Day ===
The brigade&#x27;s three regiments landed in Normandy on D-Day, 6 June 1944. Unlike their peers in the 4th Canadian Armoured Brigade, who were usually paired with their division&#x27;s 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade, the 2nd was paired with any infantry who needed armour support.

On 31 July 1944, following a series of battles with heavy infantry losses, Canadian Lieutenant General Guy Simonds ordered the creation of an armoured carrier regiment and the modification of underused American-made M7 Priest self-propelled guns. The 1st Canadian Armoured Carrier Squadron was formed, and administered as a squadron of 25th Armoured Delivery Regiment until October 19, 1944, when the squadron was converted to a regiment.

This formation rarely fought as an entity. Its primary role was infantry support and thus its regiments were usually individually tasked out to infantry units to participate in particular operations. One of the occasions when the brigade did undertake an operation on its own, Le Mesnil-Patry / Rots on 11 June 1944, ended with only a partial success and severe losses to the Canadians. 2 CAB fought in the North West Europe Campaign, longer than any other armoured formation, from D-Day to V-E Day, suffering 435 fatal casualties in total. Two of the brigade&#x27;s tanks, &quot;Holy Roller&quot; of the 1st Hussars, and &quot;Bomb&quot; of the Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment, fought continuously from D-Day to the end of the war, the only Canadian tanks to fight unscathed across Northwest Europe. &quot;Holy Roller&quot; remains the memorial of the Hussars in London, Ontario, and &quot;Bomb&quot; is preserved today at the William Street Armoury of the Sherbrooke Hussars in Sherbrooke, Quebec.

<text>In algebraic topology, singular homology refers to the study of a certain set of algebraic invariants of a topological space formula_1, the so-called homology groups formula_2 Intuitively, singular homology counts, for each dimension formula_3, the formula_3-dimensional holes of a space. Singular homology is a particular example of a homology theory, which has now grown to be a rather broad collection of theories. Of the various theories, it is perhaps one of the simpler ones to understand, being built on fairly concrete constructions (see also the related theory simplicial homology).

In brief, singular homology is constructed by taking maps of the standard -simplex to a topological space, and composing them into formal sums, called singular chains. The boundary operation – mapping each formula_3-dimensional simplex to its formula_6-dimensional boundary – induces the singular chain complex. The singular homology is then the homology of the chain complex. The resulting homology groups are the same for all homotopy equivalent spaces, which is the reason for their study. These constructions can be applied to all topological spaces, and so singular homology is expressible as a functor from the category of topological spaces to the category of graded abelian groups.

== Singular simplices ==
A singular -simplex in a topological space formula_1 is a continuous function (also called a map) formula_8 from the standard formula_3-simplex formula_10 to formula_1, written formula_12 This map need not be injective, and there can be non-equivalent singular simplices with the same image in formula_1.

The boundary of formula_14 denoted as formula_15 is defined to be the formal sum of the singular formula_6-simplices represented by the restriction of formula_8 to the faces of the standard formula_3-simplex, with an alternating sign to take orientation into account. (A formal sum is an element of the free abelian group on the simplices. The basis for the group is the infinite set of all possible singular simplices. The group operation is &quot;addition&quot; and the sum of simplex formula_19 with simplex formula_20 is usually simply designated formula_21, but formula_22 and so on. Every simplex formula_19 has a negative formula_24.) Thus, if we designate formula_8 by its vertices

:formula_26

corresponding to the vertices formula_27 of the standard formula_3-simplex formula_10 (which of course does not fully specify the singular simplex produced by formula_8), then

:formula_31

is a formal sum of the faces of the simplex image designated in a specific way. (That is, a particular face has to be the restriction of formula_8 to a face of formula_10 which depends on the order that its vertices are listed.) Thus, for example, the boundary of formula_34 (a curve going from formula_35 to formula_36) is the formal sum (or &quot;formal difference&quot;) formula_37.

== Singular chain complex ==
The usual construction of singular homology proceeds by defining formal sums of simplices, which may be understood to be elements of a free abelian group, and then showing that we can define a certain group, the homology group of the topological space, involving the boundary operator.

Consider first the set of all possible singular formula_3-simplices formula_39 on a topological space formula_1. This set may be used as the basis of a free abelian group, so that each singular formula_3-simplex is a generator of the group. This set of generators is of course usually infinite, frequently uncountable, as there are many ways of mapping a simplex into a typical topological space. The free abelian group generated by this basis is commonly denoted as formula_42. Elements of formula_42 are called singular -chains; they are formal sums of singular simplices with integer coefficients.

The boundary formula_44 is readily extended to act on singular formula_3-chains. The extension, called the boundary operator, written as

:formula_46

is a homomorphism of groups. The boundary operator, together with the formula_47, form a chain complex of abelian groups, called the singular complex. It is often denoted as formula_48 or more simply formula_49.

The kernel of the boundary operator is formula_50, and is called the group of singular -cycles. The image of the boundary operator is formula_51, and is called the group of singular -boundaries.

It can also be shown that formula_52, implying formula_53. The formula_3-th homology group of formula_1 is then defined as the factor group

:formula_56

The elements of formula_57 are called homology classes.

== Homotopy invariance ==

If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are two topological spaces with the same homotopy type (i.e. are homotopy equivalent), then

:formula_58

for all &quot;n&quot; ≥ 0. This means homology groups are homotopy invariants, and therefore topological invariants.

In particular, if &quot;X&quot; is a connected contractible space, then all its homology groups are 0, except formula_59.

A proof for the homotopy invariance of singular homology groups can be sketched as follows. A continuous map &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; induces a homomorphism

:formula_60

It can be verified immediately that

:formula_61

i.e. &quot;f&quot;# is a chain map, which descends to homomorphisms on homology

:formula_62

We now show that if &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are homotopically equivalent, then &quot;f&quot;* = &quot;g&quot;*. From this follows that if &quot;f&quot; is a homotopy equivalence, then &quot;f&quot;* is an isomorphism.

Let &quot;F&quot; : &quot;X&quot; × [0, 1] → &quot;Y&quot; be a homotopy that takes &quot;f&quot; to &quot;g&quot;. On the level of chains, define a homomorphism

:formula_63

that, geometrically speaking, takes a basis element σ: Δ&quot;n&quot; → &quot;X&quot; of &quot;Cn&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) to the &quot;prism&quot; &quot;P&quot;(σ): Δ&quot;n&quot; × &quot;I&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;. The boundary of &quot;P&quot;(σ) can be expressed as

:formula_64

So if &quot;α&quot; in &quot;Cn&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is an &quot;n&quot;-cycle, then &quot;f&quot;#(&quot;α&quot;) and &quot;g&quot;#(&quot;α&quot;) differ by a boundary:

:formula_65

i.e. they are homologous. This proves the claim.

== Homology groups of common spaces ==
The table below shows the k-th homology groups formula_66 of n-dimensional real projective spaces RP&quot;n&quot;, complex projective spaces, CP&quot;n&quot;, a point, spheres &quot;S&quot;n(formula_67), and a 3-torus &quot;T&quot;3 with integer coefficients.
==Functoriality==
The construction above can be defined for any topological space, and is preserved by the action of continuous maps. This generality implies that singular homology theory can be recast in the language of category theory. In particular, the homology group can be understood to be a functor from the category of topological spaces Top to the category of abelian groups Ab.

Consider first that formula_68 is a map from topological spaces to free abelian groups. This suggests that formula_42 might be taken to be a functor, provided one can understand its action on the morphisms of Top. Now, the morphisms of Top are continuous functions, so if formula_70 is a continuous map of topological spaces, it can be extended to a homomorphism of groups

:formula_71

by defining

:formula_72

where formula_73 is a singular simplex, and formula_74 is a singular &quot;n&quot;-chain, that is, an element of formula_42. This shows that formula_47 is a functor

:formula_77

from the category of topological spaces to the category of abelian groups.

The boundary operator commutes with continuous maps, so that formula_78. This allows the entire chain complex to be treated as a functor. In particular, this shows that the map formula_79 is a functor

:formula_80

from the category of topological spaces to the category of abelian groups. By the homotopy axiom, one has that formula_81 is also a functor, called the homology functor, acting on hTop, the quotient homotopy category:

:formula_82

This distinguishes singular homology from other homology theories, wherein formula_81 is still a functor, but is not necessarily defined on all of Top. In some sense, singular homology is the &quot;largest&quot; homology theory, in that every homology theory on a subcategory of Top agrees with singular homology on that subcategory. On the other hand, the singular homology does not have the cleanest categorical properties; such a cleanup motivates the development of other homology theories such as cellular homology.

More generally, the homology functor is defined axiomatically, as a functor on an abelian category, or, alternately, as a functor on chain complexes, satisfying axioms that require a boundary morphism that turns short exact sequences into long exact sequences. In the case of singular homology, the homology functor may be factored into two pieces, a topological piece and an algebraic piece. The topological piece is given by

:formula_84

which maps topological spaces as formula_85 and continuous functions as formula_86. Here, then, formula_87 is understood to be the singular chain functor, which maps topological spaces to the category of chain complexes Comp (or Kom). The category of chain complexes has chain complexes as its objects, and chain maps as its morphisms.

The second, algebraic part is the homology functor

:formula_88

which maps

:formula_89

and takes chain maps to maps of abelian groups. It is this homology functor that may be defined axiomatically, so that it stands on its own as a functor on the category of chain complexes.

Homotopy maps re-enter the picture by defining homotopically equivalent chain maps. Thus, one may define the quotient category hComp or K, the homotopy category of chain complexes.

== Coefficients in &quot;R&quot; ==
Given any unital ring &quot;R&quot;, the set of singular &quot;n&quot;-simplices on a topological space can be taken to be the generators of a free &quot;R&quot;-module. That is, rather than performing the above constructions from the starting point of free abelian groups, one instead uses free &quot;R&quot;-modules in their place. All of the constructions go through with little or no change. The result of this is

:formula_90

which is now an &quot;R&quot;-module. Of course, it is usually &quot;not&quot; a free module. The usual homology group is regained by noting that

:formula_91

when one takes the ring to be the ring of integers. The notation &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;; &quot;R&quot;) should not be confused with the nearly identical notation &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;A&quot;), which denotes the relative homology (below).

The universal coefficient theorem provides a mechanism to calculate the homology with &quot;R&quot; coefficients in terms of homology with usual integer coefficients using the short exact sequence

:formula_92

where &quot;Tor&quot; is the Tor functor.
Of note, if &quot;R&quot; is torsion-free, then formula_93 for any &quot;G&quot;, so the above short exact sequence reduces to an isomorphism between formula_94 and formula_95

==Relative homology==

For a subspace formula_96, the relative homology &quot;H&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;A&quot;) is understood to be the homology of the quotient of the chain complexes, that is,

:formula_97

where the quotient of chain complexes is given by the short exact sequence

:formula_98

==Reduced homology==

The reduced homology of a space &quot;X&quot;, annotated as formula_99 is a minor modification to the usual homology which simplifies expressions of some relationships and fulfils the intuition that all homology groups of a point should be zero.

For the usual homology defined on a chain complex:
:formula_100

To define the reduced homology, we augment the chain complex with an additional formula_101 between formula_102 and zero:

formula_103

where formula_104. This can be justified by interpreting the empty set as &quot;(-1)-simplex&quot;, which means that formula_105. 

The &quot;reduced&quot; homology groups are now defined by formula_106 for positive &quot;n&quot; and formula_107. 

For n &gt; 0, formula_108, while for n = 0, formula_109

== Cohomology ==

By dualizing the homology chain complex (i.e. applying the functor Hom(-, &quot;R&quot;), &quot;R&quot; being any ring) we obtain a cochain complex with coboundary map formula_110. The cohomology groups of &quot;X&quot; are defined as the homology groups of this complex; in a quip, &quot;cohomology is the homology of the co [the dual complex]&quot;.

The cohomology groups have a richer, or at least more familiar, algebraic structure than the homology groups. Firstly, they form a differential graded algebra as follows:
* the graded set of groups form a graded &quot;R&quot;-module;
* this can be given the structure of a graded &quot;R&quot;-algebra using the cup product;
* the Bockstein homomorphism &quot;β&quot; gives a differential.
There are additional cohomology operations, and the cohomology algebra has addition structure mod &quot;p&quot; (as before, the mod &quot;p&quot; cohomology is the cohomology of the mod &quot;p&quot; cochain complex, not the mod &quot;p&quot; reduction of the cohomology), notably the Steenrod algebra structure.

==Betti homology and cohomology==

Since the number of homology theories has become large (see :Category:Homology theory), the terms Betti homology and Betti cohomology are sometimes applied (particularly by authors writing on algebraic geometry) to the singular theory, as giving rise to the Betti numbers of the most familiar spaces such as simplicial complexes and closed manifolds.

==Extraordinary homology==

If one defines a homology theory axiomatically (via the Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms), and then relaxes one of the axioms (the &quot;dimension axiom&quot;), one obtains a generalized theory, called an extraordinary homology theory. These originally arose in the form of extraordinary cohomology theories, namely K-theory and cobordism theory. In this context, singular homology is referred to as ordinary homology.

<text>Paul Hirsch (17 November 1868 – 1 August 1940) was a German politician and a member of the Social Democratic Party who served as Prime Minister of Prussia from 1918 to 1920.

==Life==
Hirsch was born in Prenzlau, Brandenburg. He attended the Evangelisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster in Berlin and went on to study medicine, social sciences and economics at the Frederick William University. From 1892 he worked as a professional writer and journalist. He joined the Social Democratic Party and in 1899 was elected municipal councillor in the then independent town of Charlottenburg. From 1908 he was one of the first Social Democratic members of the Prussian House of Representatives and served as head of the SPD parliamentary group.

During the German Revolution of 1918–19, Hirsch together with the USPD politician Heinrich Ströbel became chairman of the provisional government of the Free State of Prussia (&quot;Rat der Volksbeauftragten&quot;) and also served as Interior Minister. On 4 January 1919 he dismissed the USPD chief of police Emil Eichhorn, which sparked the Spartacist uprising.

Hirsch supported the Greater Berlin Act of 1920. He resigned from his post after the Kapp Putsch, but remained a member of the Prussian Landtag until 1932. He served as a borough councillor in Charlottenburg and from 1925 as mayor in Dortmund. Forced to retire after the Nazi &quot;Machtergreifung&quot; in 1933, Hirsch moved back to Berlin where he died in poverty in 1940.

He was mentioned by name as one of the Jewish politicians who undermined the Weimar Republic in the 1940 Nazi propaganda film &quot;Der Ewige Jude&quot; produced by Fritz Hippler.

<doc id="431045" wikidata="Q454589" url="?curid=431045" title="Jacques de Vaucanson">
<text>Jacques de Vaucanson (; February 24, 1709 – November 21, 1782) was a French inventor and artist who built the first all-metal lathe. This invention was crucial for the Industrial Revolution. The lathe is known as the mother of machine tools, as it was the first machine tool that led to the invention of other machine tools. He was responsible for the creation of impressive and innovative automata. He also was the first person to design an automatic loom.

==Early life==

De Vaucanson was born in Grenoble, France in 1709 as Jacques Vaucanson (the nobiliary particle &quot;de&quot; was later added to his name by the Académie des Sciences.) The tenth child of a glove-maker, he grew up poor, and in his youth he reportedly aspired to become a clockmaker. He studied under the Jesuits and later joined the Order of the Minims in Lyon. It was his intention at the time to follow a course of religious studies, but he regained his interest in mechanical devices after meeting the surgeon Claude-Nicolas Le Cat, from whom he would learn the details of anatomy. This new knowledge allowed him to develop his first mechanical devices that mimicked biological vital functions such as circulation, respiration, and digestion.

== Automaton inventor ==

At just 18 years of age, Vaucanson was given his own workshop in Lyon, and a grant from a nobleman to construct a set of machines. In that same year of 1727, there was a visit from one of the governing heads of Les Minimes. Vaucanson decided to make some androids. The automata would serve dinner and clear the tables for the visiting politicians. However, one government official declared that he thought Vaucanson&#x27;s tendencies &quot;profane&quot;, and ordered that his workshop be destroyed.

In 1737, Vaucanson built &quot;The Flute Player&quot;, a life-size figure of a shepherd that played the tabor and the pipe and had a repertoire of twelve songs. The figure&#x27;s fingers were not pliable enough to play the flute correctly, so Vaucanson had to glove the creation in skin. The following year, in early 1738, he presented his creation to the Académie des Sciences.

Johann Joachim Quantz, court musician and long-time flute instructor to Frederick II of Prussia, discussed the shortcomings of Vaucanson&#x27;s mechanical flute player. In particular its inability to sufficiently move the lips resulted in the necessity of increasing the wind pressure for the upper octaves. Quantz discouraged this method as producing a shrill, unpleasant tone.

At the time, mechanical creatures were somewhat a fad in Europe, but most could be classified as toys, and de Vaucanson&#x27;s creations were recognized as being revolutionary in their mechanical lifelike sophistication.

Later that year, he created two additional automata, &quot;The Tambourine Player&quot; and &quot;The Digesting Duck&quot;, which is considered his masterpiece. The duck had over 400 moving parts in each wing alone, and could flap its wings, drink water, seemingly digest grain, and seemingly defecate. Although Vaucanson&#x27;s duck supposedly demonstrated digestion accurately, his duck actually contained a hidden compartment of &quot;digested food&quot;, so that what the duck defecated was not the same as what it ate; the duck would eat a mixture of water and seed and excrete a mixture of bread crumbs and green dye that appeared to the onlooker indistinguishable from real excrement. Although such frauds were sometimes controversial, they were common enough because such scientific demonstrations needed to entertain the wealthy and powerful to attract their patronage. Vaucanson is credited as having invented the world&#x27;s first flexible rubber tube while in the process of building the duck&#x27;s intestines. Despite the revolutionary nature of his automata, he is said to have tired quickly of his creations and sold them in 1743.

His inventions brought him to the attention of Frederick II of Prussia, who sought to bring him to his court. Vaucanson refused, however, wishing to serve his own country.

== Government service ==

In 1741 de Vaucanson was appointed by Cardinal Fleury, chief minister of Louis XV, as inspector of the manufacture of silk in France. He was charged with undertaking reforms of the silk manufacturing process. At the time, the French weaving industry had fallen behind that of England and Scotland. During this time, Vaucanson promoted wide-ranging changes for automation of the weaving process. In 1745, he created the world&#x27;s first completely automated loom, drawing on the work of Basile Bouchon and Jean Falcon. Vaucanson was trying to automate the French textile industry with punch cards – a technology that, as refined by Joseph-Marie Jacquard more than a half-century later, would revolutionize weaving and, in the twentieth century, would be used to input data into computers and store information in binary form. His proposals were not well received by weavers, however, who pelted him with stones in the street and many of his revolutionary ideas were largely ignored.

In 1746, he was made a member of the Académie des Sciences.

===Lathe===
In 1760 he invented the first industrial metal cutting slide rest lathe. Others place his invention in 1751. The lathe was described in the Encyclopédie and is exhibited at Musée des Arts et Métiers in France. It was designed to produce precision cylindrical rollers for crushing patterns into silk cloth. These were of copper rather than steel, so far easier to turn on a lathe, which may account for Vaucanson&#x27;s omission from such works as Derry &amp; Williams, who place this invention around 1768.

==Legacy==

Jacques de Vaucanson died in Paris in 1782. Vaucanson left a collection of his work as a bequest to Louis XVI. The collection would become the foundation of the
Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers in Paris. His original automata have all been lost. The flute player and the tambourine player were reportedly destroyed in the Revolution. Some had been sold to a glovemaker called Pierre Dumoulin (d. 1781), who exhibited them throughout Europe with great success. Dumoulin’s shows with Vaucanson’s automata in Saint Petersburg started the fashion of automata in Russia. In 1783, it was reported that the automata once exhibited by Dumoulin were still stored in Russia, but Dumoulin had manipulated them so that they would not work after his death.

Vaucanson’s proposals for the automation of the weaving process, although ignored during his lifetime, were later perfected and implemented by Joseph Marie Jacquard, the creator of the Jacquard loom.

Lycee Vaucanson in Grenoble is named in his honor, and trains students for careers in engineering and technical fields.

Vaucanson is a somewhat major character in Lawrence Norfolk&#x27;s debut novel &quot;Lemprière&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;. In this novel, Vaucanson is said to be a member of the secretive Cabbala and performs various primitive technological augmentations on living flesh (such as making the assassin Bahadur sent by the Nawab of the Carnatic into a husk or making the hounds of the Viscount Casterleigh into vicious bloodthirsty killers).

<doc id="431047" wikidata="Q947781" url="?curid=431047" title="USS Golet">
<text>USS &quot;Golet&quot; (SS-361), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the golet, a California trout.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Golet&quot; initially was ordered as a unit of the &quot;Balao&quot; class, but her builder, the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company, did not receive the drawings for the &quot;Balao&quot; class from the Electric Boat Company in time to build &quot;Golet&quot; or the submarines , , and to the new design, so they were built as &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarines. Thus, in some references, these four submarines are listed as units of the &quot;Balao&quot;-class.

War bond purchases by the people of Shreveport, Louisiana, and Cadddo Parish, Louisiana, funded &quot;Golet&quot;′s construction. Her keel was laid down by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company of Manitowoc, Wisconsin. She was launched on 1 August 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Wiley, wife of United States Senator Alexander Wiley of Wisconsin, and commissioned on 30 November 1943.

==Operational history==

&quot;Golet&quot; departed Manitowoc 19 December 1943 via the Mississippi River for New Orleans, Louisiana, arriving 28 December. After shakedown training at Panama and final battle practice in Hawaiian waters Golet departed Pearl Harbor on 18 March 1944 for her maiden war patrol.

=== First Patrol: 18 March 1944 ===
Golet departed Pearl Harbor on 18 March 1944 for her maiden war patrol off the Kurile Islands chain, Southern Hokkaidō and Eastern Honshū, Japan. Severe combinations of fog, rain, and ice were encountered and only one ship worth a torpedo came into view. This enemy proved too fast for &quot;Golet&quot; to close to torpedo range; she returned to Midway Island on 3 May 1944.

=== Second Patrol: 28 May 1944 ===
Lieutenant Commander James S. Clark took command of &quot;Golet&quot;, departed Midway Island on 28 May 1944 to patrol off northern Honshū, Japan, and was never heard from again.

&quot;Golet&quot; had been scheduled to depart her area on 5 July and was expected at Midway Island about 12 July or 13 July. She failed to acknowledge a message sent her on 9 July and was presumed lost 26 July 1944.

=== Fate: 14 June 1944 ===
Japanese antisubmarine records available after the war revealed that &quot;Golet&quot; was the probable victim of a Japanese antisubmarine attack made 14 June 1944. These records mention that the attack brought up cork, rafts, and other debris and a heavy pool of oil, all evidence of the sinking of a submarine.

==Commemoration==

=== Commissioning Crew: 30 November 1943 ===

A plaque at the Wisconsin Maritime Museum in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, lists the members of &quot;Golet&quot;′s commissioning crew on 30 November 1943 and provides a brief history of &quot;Golet&quot;′s career.

=== Memorial: 9 March 2013===
A memorial to &quot;Golet&quot; and her crew is located in Metairie, Louisiana. Its inscription reads:

U.S.S. Golet SS-361 A submarine built by Manitowoc shipbuilding Co of Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Funds for this boat were raised by the citizens of Caddo Parish Louisiana. Launched one August 1943, her second patrol under the command of LCDR. James S. Clark was sunk by enemy depth charges on 14 June 1944. All hands were lost – 82 men. May God rest their souls.

The memorial also lists her crew at the time of her sinking, all of whom were lost.

<text>In music, the mystic chord or Prometheus chord is a six-note synthetic chord and its associated scale, or pitch collection; which loosely serves as the harmonic and melodic basis for some of the later pieces by Russian composer Alexander Scriabin. Scriabin, however, did not use the chord directly but rather derived material from its transpositions.

When rooted in C, the mystic chord consists of the pitch classes: C, F, B, E, A, D.

This is often interpreted as a quartal hexachord consisting of an augmented fourth, diminished fourth, augmented fourth, and two perfect fourths. The chord is related to other pitch collections, such as being a hexatonic subset of the overtone scale, also known in jazz circles as the Lydian dominant scale, lacking the perfect fifth.

==Nomenclature==
The term &quot;mystic chord&quot; appears to derive from Alexander Scriabin&#x27;s intense interest in Theosophy, and the chord is imagined to reflect this mysticism. It was coined by Arthur Eaglefield Hull in 1916.

It is also known as the &quot;Prometheus chord&quot;, after its extensive use in his work &quot;&quot;, Op. 60. The term was invented by Leonid Sabaneyev.

Scriabin himself called it the &quot;chord of the pleroma&quot; (аккорд плеромы &quot;akkord pleromy&quot;), which &quot;was designed to afford instant apprehension of -that is, to &quot;reveal&quot;- what was in essence beyond the mind of man to conceptualize. Its preternatural stillness was a gnostic intimation of a hidden otherness.&quot;

==Qualities==
Jim Samson points out that it fits in well with Scriabin&#x27;s mainly dominant quality sonorities and harmony, as it may take on a dominant quality on C or F. This tritone relationship between possible resolutions is important to Scriabin&#x27;s harmonic language, and it is a property shared by the French sixth (also prominent in his work) of which the synthetic chord can be seen as an extension. The example below shows the mystic chord rewritten as a French sixth with notes A and D as extensions:

The pitch collection is related to the octatonic scale, the whole tone scale, and the French sixth, all of which are capable of a different number of transpositions. For example, the chord is a whole tone scale with one note raised a semitone (the &quot;almost whole-tone&quot; hexachord, sometimes identified as &quot;whole tone-plus&quot;), and this alteration allows for a greater variety of resources through transposition.

Leonid Sabaneev interpreted the Prometheus chord as harmonics 8 through 14, without 12 (1, 9, 5, 11, 13, 7 = C, D, E, F, A, B), but the 11th harmonic is 48.68 cents away from the tritone (F), the 13th harmonic is 59.47 cents away from a major sixth (A).

However, to quote Carl Dahlhaus, &quot;the interval-distance of the natural-tone-row [overtones] [...], counting up to 20, includes everything from the octave to the quarter tone, (and) useful and useless musical tones. The natural-tone-row [harmonic series] justifies everything, that means, nothing.&quot; Elliott Antokoletz says the &quot;so-called &#x27;mystic chord&#x27;&quot; approximates harmonics 7 through 13 (7, 8, 9, 10, (11,) 12, 13 = C, D, E, F, (G,) A, B). 

The notes of the chord also conform to a Lydian dominant quality, the fourth mode of the melodic minor scale.

==Use by Scriabin==
Some sources suggest that much of Scriabin&#x27;s music is entirely based on the chord to the extent that whole passages are little more than long sequences of this chord, unaltered, at different pitches; but this is rarely the case. More often than not, the notes are reordered so as to supply a variety of harmonic or melodic material. Certain of Scriabin&#x27;s late pieces are based on other synthetic chords or scales that do not rely on the mystic chord.

In in his 2023-2024 essay &quot;Scriabin&#x27;s Compositional Methods: Analysis and Review,&quot; Reise updated his position noting that Scriabin&#x27;s close colleague and biographer Leonid Sabaneyev wrote that &quot;Scriabin often said his music was based on his &#x27;synthetic harmony.&#x27;&quot; Since this is how the composer himself described his famous chord, Reise has adopted the term in place of “mystic chord” (a term Scriabin never used) throughout his essay. Reise further points out (as have others) that in many of the late pieces, Scriabin extends the synthetic harmony by adding the note G - the next ascending P4. Reise posits that this expanded harmony, which contains all the notes of the acoustic scale, might be reasonably called the synthetic harmony+. 


The synthetic harmony(+) is the referential element for the orthography, the procedures governing the voice leading of the whole tone and octatonic scales, the registral distribution of the harmony, and the derivation of the complete octatonic scale. According to Reise, all scales (including the 9-note scale of the Poème Op. 71 No. 1) either resolve or impliy resolution to the octatonic or whole scales.
Matthew Bengtson writes, “...the mystic chord acts as a kind of mediator, a convenient means of transit, hovering, as in mid-air, between the whole-tone and octatonic harmonic worlds.&quot;
Other sources suggest that Scriabin&#x27;s method of pitch organization is based on ordered scales that feature scale degrees. Since the mystic chord is a synthetic chord, the scale from which it derives, sometimes called the &quot;Prometheus scale&quot;, is an example of a synthetic scale.

For example, a group of piano miniatures (Op. 58, Op. 59/2, Op. 61, Op. 63, Op. 67/1 and Op. 69/1) are governed by the acoustic and/or the octatonic scales.

Contrary to many textbook descriptions of the chord, which present the sonority as a series of superposed fourths, Scriabin most often manipulated the voicings to produce a variety of melodic and harmonic intervals. A rare example of purely quartal spacing can be found in the Fifth Piano Sonata (mm. 264 and 268). Measures 263–264 are shown below.

Incomplete versions of the chord spaced entirely in fourths are considerably more common, for example, in Deux Morceaux, Op. 57.

According to George Perle, Scriabin used this chord in what he calls a pre-serial manner, producing harmonies, chords, and melodies. However, unlike the twelve tone technique to which Perle refers, Scriabin, like Perle, did not use his Mystic chord as an ordered set and did not worry about repeating or omitting notes or aggregate combinatoriality.

==Use by other composers==

With the increasing use of more dissonant sonorities, some composers of the 20th and 21st centuries have used this chord in various ways..

In jazz music, on the other hand, such chords are extremely common, and in this setting the mystic chord can be viewed simply as a C1311 chord with the fifth omitted. In the score to the right is an example of a Duke Ellington composition that uses a different voicing of this chord at the end of the second bar, played on E (E1311).

<text>Adam Stegerwald (14 December 1874 – 3 December 1945) was a German politician and union leader who served as chairman of the German Trade Union Federation (DGB), the Catholic trade union association, during the Weimar Republic. He was also a prominent member of the Catholic Centre Party and served briefly as Minister-President of Prussia in 1921. After the Second World War, he was a co-founder of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria.

==Early life and Imperial period==
Stegerwald was born the son of a farmer in Greußenheim in Lower Franconia and attended primary school there between 1881 and 1888 before completing an apprenticeship as a carpenter in Würzburg. From 1900 to 1902, Stegerwald studied economics under Lujo Brentano at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. He began his engagement with the labour movement in 1893, when he joined the Catholic &quot;Gesellenverein&quot;, a non-union Catholic labour society, in Günzburg. From 1896, he was part of the workers&#x27; electoral association of the Centre Party in Munich, where he was committed to building the burgeoning Catholic trade union movement. He advanced quickly, becoming honorary chairman of the Central Union of Christian Woodworkers in 1899 and, in 1903, general-secretary of the General Association of German Christian Trade Unions, a position he retained until 1929.

In his political role, he steered a conservative course, supporting the Empire and its colonial ambitions. He attempted to unify the non-socialist unions, such as the Protestant DHV and the Catholic &quot;Gesellvereine&quot;, into a unified organisation to create a counterweight to the socialist free trade unions, though he was unsuccessful. He supported the German war effort in the First World War and served on the board of the Wartime Food Office from 1916 to 1919, as well as in the Prussian House of Lords during the final year of the war.

==Weimar Republic==
===Union leader===
In the aftermath of the November Revolution, Stegerwald represented the Catholic trade unions in co-signing the 15 November working agreement between the unions and employers&#x27; associations. The working agreement set out a common understanding between labour and capital, acknowledging unions as the legitimate representatives of the workers and setting out the basis for collective bargaining agreements and the eight-hour day.

Throughout the following year Stegerwald called for the end to the workers&#x27; council movement which was popular among many radical workers, mostly in the socialist unions. In 1919, he became head of the German Trade Union Federation (DGB), the reorganised Christian trade union federation. Initially, it bore a close resemblance to Stegerwald&#x27;s prewar proposal of a broad non-socialist union federation, including the Catholic unions as well as the liberal and the Protestant white-collar associations. However, the more secular Hirsch-Duncker unions departed in November, leaving the DGB largely dominated by the Catholic unions with a deeply conservative Protestant minority in the German National Association of Commercial Employees (DHV).

As leader of the DGB, Stegerwald struggled to maintain the unity of the federation&#x27;s conflicting parts. Left-wing elements such as the Catholic miners&#x27; and industrial unions resented Stegerwald&#x27;s conservative orientation and his continuous attempts to find common cause with conservative Protestants rather than seek better conditions for workers. At the same time, he sought constantly to appease the ultraconservative white-collar DHV. In 1927, he sided with the DGB&#x27;s industrial unions in opposing a widely-agreed wage increase for civil servants. This effort failed and alienated him from the white-collar elements of the DGB, to whom he had previously been a stalwart ally.

After becoming chair of the Centre&#x27;s Reichstag delegation in January 1929, he resigned from his union positions. He was succeeded as chair of the DGB by Heinrich Imbusch, leader of the miners&#x27; union.

===National politics===
Stegerwald was elected to both the national and Prussian constituent assembles early in 1919, and became minister for public welfare in Prussia under Social Democratic minister-president Paul Hirsch. At the DGB congress in 1920, Stegerwald proposed the formation of an inter-denominational &quot;People&#x27;s Party&quot;, through which he hoped to unite both Catholics and Protestants in a conservative project opposed to socialism, liberalism, and materialism. The idea was roundly rejected: the right-wing of the Centre opposed abandoning their Catholic orientation while the left-wing feared the conservative, anti-labour orientation of such a party. Nonetheless, Stegerwald remained a convinced advocate of a pan-Christian party for the rest of his life.

During the government impasse following the 1921 Prussian state election, the state Centre Party drafted Stegerwald to serve as interim Minister-President. He was tasked with putting together a cabinet including Social Democrats, the Centre, the left-liberal Democrats, and the conservative German People&#x27;s Party. He was invested by the Landtag with a large majority in April, but soon came to blows with the Social Democrats, who withdrew their support. His cabinet consisted of a minority government of the Centre and Democrats, and negotiations to expand it stalled out toward the end of the year. It finally collapsed in October when the Democrats quit in protest against Stegerwald&#x27;s proposal to hand the interior ministry to the Social Democrats. He resigned, and in short order a new centre-left government was formed under Social Democrat Otto Braun. This proved to be the end of Stegerwald&#x27;s involvement in Prussian state politics.

Stegerwald strongly advocated for the Centre to form part of a conservative government in the Reich under Hans Luther, using his role as head of the DGB to claim widespread union support. For this he received a cold reception at the October 1924 congress of the DGB&#x27;s industrial unions and was attacked by Heinrich Imbusch, head of the miners&#x27; union. Ultimately the unions passed a resolution declaring neutrality in political affairs and Stegerwald was forced to walk back his previous statements. When the first Luther cabinet was invested the following January, the majority of the labour representatives among the Centre&#x27;s Reichstag delegation did not support it. At the Centre Party congress in November 1925 Stegerwald was heckled by Joseph Wirth, outspoken leader of the Centre left, who accused him of giving a pass to nationalist extremism.

After the collapse of the Luther cabinet the following year, Stegerwald&#x27;s perspective on cooperation with the conservative right changed. He no longer considered the German National People&#x27;s Party &quot;worthy of carrying Christian spirit in public life&quot;, finding the party both anti-Catholic and uninterested in serious advocacy for the Protestant churches or Christian values.

In December 1928, the Centre Party congress was tasked with electing a new party chairman. The executive unanimously recommended Stegerwald. This choice was intended to be a fig leaf to the unions and facilitate Stegerwald&#x27;s movement out of the DGB leadership into full-time politics, which he had long sought. However, the party national committee rejected Stegerwald: this was at least in part due to the predominance of civil servants on the committee, whose interests Stegerwald had unexpectedly opposed the previous year. He was also opposed for reasons of personality as well as his opposition to church interference in the party. The party hierarchy considered several alternatives and ultimately put forward three names to a floor vote: Stegerwald, his rival in the unions Joseph Joos, and prelate Ludwig Kaas. Stegerwald received 42 votes, Joos 92, and Kaas 182.

Despite this defeat, in January 1929, Stegerwald was elected head of the Centre Reichstag faction. He resigned his position as head of the DGB and in the unions, finally completing his move to full-time politics. In April he became Minister for Transport in the new Great Coalition under Hermann Müller. When the government fell in March 1930, Stegerwald was promoted to Labour Minister by new Chancellor Heinrich Brüning, who had been Stegerwald&#x27;s assistant and protege earlier in the 1920s.

In this role he was both tasked with implementing the government&#x27;s harsh austerity response to the Great Depression, which entailed reductions in wages and rolling back labour rights, while also seeking to maintain the welfare state for the millions of unemployed despite harsh cutbacks. It was also in this time that he achieved the long-sought for cooperation with the moderate and religious elements of the Protestant right following the secession from the DNVP of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party and CSVD, who collaborated in the Brüning government. Stegerwald remained Labour Minister until the cabinet&#x27;s dismissal in May 1932.

==Nazi Regime==
Following Hitler&#x27;s appointment as Chancellor in January 1933, Stegerwald was attacked by SA storm troopers at an election rally in Krefeld on 21 February. Police declined to interfere. The following month, he helped lead negotiations with the Nazi Party to secure the Centre&#x27;s support for the Enabling Act of 1933 which handed &quot;de facto&quot; dictatorial power to Hitler.

From 1933 to 1934 he was indicted, along with Wilhelm Marx and Heinrich Brauns, in the trial of the Cologne &quot;Volksverein Verlag&quot; in his capacity as board member of the National Association for Catholic Germany. He was on the list of politicians to be purged during the Night of the Long Knives, but received warning and disappeared into exile for three months. He retired to Franconia during the regime, and in letters to former colleagues urged church leaders to appease the government for fear of the churches&#x27; dissolution.

Following the 20 July plot, he was temporarily arrested under the &quot;Aktion Gitter&quot;. From August to October 1944 he was detained by the Gestapo in Würzburg prison before being released.

==Post-war==
Following the end of the Second World War, the American occupation authority appointed the 71-year-old Stegerwald administrator of the Lower Franconia district. He became leader of the &quot;Würzburg group&quot; which proved instrumental in the foundation of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria in the late summer and autumn of 1945. In Stegerwald&#x27;s speeches and writing it was clear he considered the new party the fulfillment of his &quot;People&#x27;s Party&quot; concept of 1920, serving as a &quot;bridge&quot; between denominations, classes, and generations; he coined the name &quot;Christian Social Union&quot;. Despite the desire of some Catholic labour leaders to found a united labour party with the socialist unions, and of other Catholic leaders to re-found the Centre Party, Stegerwald&#x27;s model was ultimately taken up nationwide in the form of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany.

Adam Stegerwald died of pneumonia in December 1945. He has been honoured extensively, with streets named after him in numerous towns and cities across Germany. Two political education foundations, the Adam Stegerwald Circle and Stegerwald Foundation, are named in his honour. A neighbourhood in Cologne, &quot;Stegerwaldsiedlung&quot;, is also named for him. Two buildings in Würzburg are named &quot;Adam-Stegerwald-Haus&quot;: the office of the regional CSU branch as well as a student accommodation building. Another building in Königswinter, originally acquired by Jakob Kaiser and used by Catholic welfare and political associations in the Weimar period, was renamed &quot;Adam-Stegerwald-Haus&quot; in 1948 after its acquisition by the new German Trade Union Confederation. After housing a number of different organisations over the decades, the building was sold in 2015 and converted into a nursing home, retaining its name.

<doc id="431058" wikidata="Q1277359" url="?curid=431058" title="Earl of Mar">
<text>There are currently two earldoms of Mar in the Peerage of Scotland, and the title has been created seven times. The first creation of the earldom is currently held by Margaret of Mar, 31st Countess of Mar, who is also clan chief of Clan Mar. The seventh creation is currently held by James Erskine, 14th Earl of Mar and 16th Earl of Kellie, who is also clan chief of Clan Erskine.

The earldom is an ancient one. The first named earl is Ruadrí, who is known to have been alive in 1128, though an unnamed earl is mentioned as being present at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. In 1435 the earldom was seized by King James II (16 October 1430 – 3 August 1460), and was then granted to several royal children, who produced no heirs. The sixth creation was for James Stewart, illegitimate son of King James V (10 April 1512 – 14 December 1542), who was stripped of the title after a rebellion in 1565.

The title was granted to John Erskine, a descendant of the original earls. In 1866, the previous Earl died childless, and it was unclear whether the earldom should pass to his heir male, or heir general. This led to the two decisions by the House of Lords, which created the two earldoms. In 1875, the House ruled that the earldom given to John Erskine in 1565 was the seventh creation, not a continuation of the first, and that it should pass to heirs male. In 1885, however, the House passed and Parliament enacted the &quot;Earldom of Mar Restitution Act&quot;, which declared that the first creation of the earldom still existed, and was held by the heir general of the original earls.

Several earls of Mar have been prominent in Scottish history. In particular, John Erskine (d. 1572) served as Regent of Scotland after the abdication of Mary, Queen of Scots, and John Erskine (1675–1732) was a Jacobite commander who fled to France. Lionel Erskine-Young, 29th Earl of Mar (1891–1965) was a co-founder of the Royal Stuart Society to continue support for the Jacobite succession.

== History ==
The earldom takes its name from Mar, an ancient province of Scotland running west from Aberdeen along the River Dee beyond Braemar (&quot;upper Mar&quot;) to the Mar Lodge Estate. Mar expanded north past the River Don to become the region of Marr, which merged with Buchan to form the county of Aberdeenshire.

=== 9th–14th centuries ===
The first Mormaer of Mar is usually regarded as Ruadrí (fl. 1131), mentioned in the Book of Deer. Some modern sources give earlier mormaers, i.e. &quot;Muirchertach&quot; (Latinized as &quot;Martachus&quot;) and &quot;Gartnait&quot; (sometimes &quot;Gratnach&quot;), mentioned respectively in charters of the reigns of king Máel Coluim III (relating to the Céli Dé establishment of Loch Leven) and king Alexander I (relating to the monastic establishment of Scone), though in these cases certain identification with a particular province is difficult. The accounts of the Battle of Clontarf in some of the Irish annals name Domnall mac Eimín meic Cainnig, Mormaer of Mar, as among those killed in 1014 alongside Brian Boru.

The Mormaerdom comprised the larger portion of modern Aberdeenshire, extending from north of the River Don southward to the Mounth hills. Its principal seats were Migvie and Doune of Invernochty. The Mormaerdom may initially have alternated between two kin-groups, represented respectively by Morggán, and by Gille Críst. Gilchrist succeeded Morgund, but was himself succeeded by Donnchadh (Duncan), son of Morgund. On the other hand, we do not know Gilchrist&#x27;s parentage, and chronologically he could have been an elder brother of Donnchadh.

No definite succession of earls appears till the 13th century, and from the middle of the 13th century the earls were recognized as among &quot;the seven earls of Scotland&quot;. There was a settlement in around 1230 between Donnchadh and Thomas Durward, grandson, apparently, of Gilchrist, by which Durward had, it is said, £300 of land, a very large amount, which was scattered around the earldom, particularly at Fichlie, near Kildrummy, and Lumphanan in the lowland area. He also had Urquhart, but that probably had nothing to do with the earldom. Donnchadh got the title of Mormaer and the wealthier and militarily more useful upland parts of Mar. Earl Thomas died childless in 1374, but the earldom passed via Donnchadh&#x27;s daughter Margaret to her husband William, Earl of Douglas.

=== 15th century ===
 While the eleventh (by some counts) holder of the title, William and Margaret&#x27;s daughter Isabel Douglas, Countess of Mar, was alone at Kildrummy Castle, Alexander Stewart, following in the steps of his father the &quot;Wolf of Badenoch&quot; and his uncle Robert, Duke of Albany, murdered Sir Malcolm Drummond, Earl of Mar, captured Kildrummy Castle and forced Mar&#x27;s widow Isabel Douglas, to marry him. He also forced her to sign a charter on 12 August 1404 yielding the earldom to him and his heirs. She revoked the charter later that year, but on marrying him, she gave him the earldom for life with remainder to &quot;her&quot; heirs. The King confirmed her last action the next year.

In 1426, Stewart resigned the title so that he could be granted a new one by the King, the new title being more &quot;legitimate&quot;. The King did so, but specified that the earldom and associated lands would revert to the Crown upon the death of the Earl. In 1435, the Earl died, and Robert, Lord Erskine claimed the title, but the King claimed its lands under the specifications of reversion made in the patent. The issue remained unresolved until 1457, when James II obtained a court order declaring the lands as crown possessions. Thereafter, he bestowed the title on his son John, who died without heirs in 1479. It was next granted to James&#x27; other son, Alexander, Duke of Albany, but the title was then declared forfeit because of Alexander&#x27;s alliances with the English. James III created his son John Earl of Mar in 1486, upon whose death in 1503 the title became extinct again.

=== 16th–18th centuries ===
The title was once again created in 1562, for James, Earl of Moray, son of James V, but he, too, could not produce a qualified heir. Moray rebelled in 1565 (see Chaseabout Raid) in protest at the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, and Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. Consequently, Queen Mary restored (or created) the earldom of Mar for John, Lord Erskine, heir to the Lord Erskine, heir of the ancient Earls through a cousin of Isabel, who quarrelled with James II about the Earldom. His son, also named John, recovered the Mar estates, alienated by the Crown during the long period that his family had been out of possession. John, the 23rd (or 6th Earl counting from 1565) was attainted for rebellion in 1716 (he was also created Duke of Mar in the Jacobite Peerages of Scotland and Ireland, and Earl of Mar in the Jacobite Peerage of England), and the Earldom remained forfeit for over a century.

=== 19th century ===
In 1824, the Earldom was restored by Act of Parliament (5 Geo. 4. c. 59) to John Francis Erskine, the heir of the attainted Earl, in his 83rd year. His grandson, the ninth Earl, successfully claimed inheritance the earldom of Kellie and associated titles in 1835.

At the death of the 26th Earl of Mar and eleventh Earl of Kellie in 1866, the Earldom of Kellie and the family&#x27;s estates passed to Walter Erskine, the cousin of the late Earl, and his heir male. Meanwhile, it was assumed that the Earldom of Mar passed to John Francis Goodeve, the late Earl&#x27;s nephew, and his heir general. Goodeve changed his name to Goodeve Erskine; his claim was agreed upon by all. He even participated in the election of Scottish representative peers for the Peerage of Scotland. However, the Earl of Kellie submitted a petition to the House of Lords asking that the Earldom of Mar be declared his, dying before it could be considered. His son, the thirteenth Earl of Kellie, renewed the petition, and the Lords referred it to their Committee on Privileges. The petition made a number of claims:

*The original Earldom of Mar was a territorial title rather than a title of peerage and was therefore &quot;indivisible.&quot; (In other words, the territory could not be separated from the title.)
*Alexander Stewart obtained a new royal charter for the Earldom, rather than receiving it in right of his wife Isabel.
*After the death of Alexander Stewart, his lands were passed to the sovereign in accordance with the charter, and thereafter were disposed of by the Crown.
*As the territorial earldom was &quot;indivisible&quot;, upon the termination of the territory, the earldom must have ended also.
*Therefore, since the territorial earldom had already become non-existent, the 1565 grant was &quot;not&quot; a revival of that title. Rather, it was a totally new creation, this time in the form of a peerage title.
*Since the instrument of the 1565 grant cannot be found, the presumption ought to be that the earldom passes to heirs-male, and not to heirs-general. Thus, the Earl of Kellie is entitled to the Earldom of Mar as he is the late Earl of Mar&#x27;s heir male, while John Goodeve Erskine was an heir-general.

Goodeve Erskine had different ideas, however. He portrayed the Crown&#x27;s takeover of the territorial earldom not as pursuant to a charter, but rather as an act of tyranny. He argued:

*James I, in a tyrannical act, seized the lands of Alexander Stewart, when these should have passed to Robert, Lord Erskine.
*The &quot;true&quot; earls never agreed to terminate their claim to the earldom.
*The 1565 grant was a restitution of the old territorial earldom rather than a new creation.
*Because the title is a restoration of a territorial earldom, and because the territorial earldom could pass to heirs-general, John Goodeve Erskine was the rightful heir, being the late Earl of Mar&#x27;s heir-general.

The House of Lords Committee on Privileges ruled in 1875, to the dissatisfaction of many, that the Earldom of Mar was newly created in 1565, passed only to heirs-male, and therefore belonged to the Earl of Kellie, and not to Goodeve Erskine. The Lord Chancellor, Roundell Palmer, 1st Baron Selborne, declared it to be &quot;final, right or wrong, and not to be questioned&quot;. 
However, there was a sentiment that the Lords had decided wrongly. A bill was brought to Parliament, to allow Goodeve Erskine to assume the title, and was passed without dissent. The Earldom of Mar Restitution Act 1885 (48 &amp; 49 Vict. c. 48) declared that because of the doubts relating to the 1565 creation, it would be assumed that there are &quot;two&quot; Earldoms of Mar. The Earldom created in 1565 would be held by the Earl of Kellie. The ancient earldom, however, was declared to be still in existence, and was given to John Goodeve Erskine. For the purposes of precedence, it is assumed that the earldom held by Goodeve Erskine&#x27;s heirs was created in 1404.

<doc id="431079" wikidata="Q639000" url="?curid=431079" title="Wupatki National Monument">
<text>The Wupatki National Monument is a United States National Monument located in north-central Arizona, near Flagstaff. Rich in Native American archaeological sites, the monument is administered by the National Park Service in close conjunction with the nearby Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument. Wupatki was established as a national monument in 1924 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. The listing included three contributing buildings and 29 contributing structures on .

==History==
The many settlement sites scattered throughout the monument were built by the Ancient Pueblo People, more specifically the Cohonina, Kayenta, and Sinagua. Wupatki, which means &quot;Long Cut House&quot; in the Hopi language, is a multistory pueblo dwelling comprising over 100 rooms and a community room and the northernmost ballcourt ever discovered in North America, creating the largest building site for nearly 50 miles. Nearby secondary structures have also been uncovered, including two kiva-like structures. A major population influx began soon after the eruption of Sunset Crater in the 11th century (between 1040 and 1100), which blanketed the area with volcanic ash, improving agricultural productivity and the soil&#x27;s ability to retain water. By 1182, approximately 85 to 100 people lived at Wupatki Pueblo, but by 1225, the site was permanently abandoned. For many years, layers of ash and lava would have made habitation difficult. Based on a careful survey of archaeological sites conducted in the 1980s, an estimated 2,000 people moved into the area during the century following the eruption. Agriculture was based mainly on maize and squash raised on the arid land without irrigation. In the Wupatki site, the residents harvested rainwater due to the rarity of springs.

The dwelling&#x27;s walls were constructed from thin, flat blocks of the local Moenkopi sandstone, giving the pueblos their distinct red color. Held together with mortar, many of the walls still stand. Each settlement was constructed as a single building, sometimes with scores of rooms. The largest settlement on monument territory is the Wupatki Pueblo, built around a natural rock outcrop. With more than 100 rooms, this pueblo is believed to be the region&#x27;s tallest and largest structure for its time period. The monument also contains structures identified as a ball court, similar to those found in Mesoamerica and in the Hohokam sites of southern Arizona; this is the northernmost example of this kind of structure. This site also contains a geological blowhole, from which wind escapes from a cave system. Other major sites are Wukoki and The Citadel.

Today, Wupatki appears empty and abandoned, but it is remembered and cared for. Although it is no longer physically occupied, Hopi believe the people who lived and died here remain as spiritual guardians. Stories of Wupatki are passed on among Hopi, Navajo, Zuni, and other Native American tribes in the region. Members of the Hopi Bear, Katsina, Lizard, Rattlesnake, Sand, Snow, and Water Clans return periodically to enrich their personal understanding of their clan history.

Amidst what would seem a generally inhospitable area due to the lack of food and water sources, several artifacts have been located at the site from distant locations, implying that the people who inhabited Wupatki were involved in trade. During numerous excavations stretching back to the site&#x27; exploration in the mid-1800s, items from as far as the Pacific and the Gulf Coasts have been located at the site, such as many different varieties of pottery and seashells.

==Climate==
Wupatki has a dry climate, classified by the Köppen climate classification system as a borderline semi-arid climate and arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;/&quot;BWk&quot;). Wupatki has cold winters and hot summers.

Studies have been conducted to compare the climate of Wupatki in the 12th and 13th century, to the 20th century. The findings show that there has been very little change to the climate in the last 2,000 years.

<doc id="431080" wikidata="Q931565" url="?curid=431080" title="Podlachia">
<text>Podlachia, also known by its Polish name Podlasie (; ; ), is a historical region in north-eastern Poland. Its largest city is Białystok, whereas the historical capital is Drohiczyn.

Similarly to several other historical regions of Poland, e.g. Greater Poland, Lesser Poland, Mazovia, Pomerania, Silesia, Warmia, Podlachia possesses its own folk costumes, unique traditional architecture and cuisine. Between 1513 and 1795 it was a voivodeship with the capital in Drohiczyn. Now the part north of the Bug River is included in the modern Podlaskie Voivodeship with the capital in Białystok, whereas southern parts are located in the Masovian and Lublin Voivodeships.

==Names and etymology==
The region is called , or in Polish, in Lithuanian, &quot;Padliašša&quot; (Падляшша) in Belarusian, &quot;Podljas’e&quot; (Подлясье) in Russian, פּאָדליאַשע &quot;Podlyashe&quot; in Yiddish, and in Latin.

There are two hypotheses regarding the origin of the name of the region. According to the first one, the name is derived from the Polish word &quot;las&quot; , and means . However, this hypothesis conflicts with historical phonology; it fails to explain the vocalism and especially the &quot;-ch-&quot;/&quot;-š-&quot; in Slavic languages and the &quot;-nk-&quot; in Lithuanian.

According to the second hypothesis, the name is derived from the word &quot;liakh&quot; (or &quot;lach&quot;, , ), and means . The second hypothesis holds that the term comes from the expression &quot;pod Lachem&quot;, which may be translated literally as (see: Lechia). Some claim it to mean , though in the Middle Ages Podlachia was only partially under Polish rule, and since 1446 until 1569 the area belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. A better variant of this theory holds that the name originates from the period when the territory was within the Trakai Voivodeship of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, along the borderline with the Mazovia, primarily a fief of the Poland of the Piasts and later on part of the Kingdom of Poland of the Jagiellons. The origin of this name is apparently in East Slavic, probably Old Ruthenian &quot;ljax&quot;, as the descendants of the Proto-Slavic word &quot;&quot; are most widespread there; there is no trace of nasalisation as would be expected in a native Polish word, but instead the typically East Slavic reflex &quot;-ja-&quot;, betraying the non-Lechitic origin.

==Geography==
Podlachia is located along the middle stretch of the Bug River between Mazovia in the west, Polesia and Volhynia in the east, the Narew River in the north and the Chełm Land in the south. The borders of Podlachia changed with time and was not the same as historical Podlaskie Voivodeship. Podlachia is sometimes divided into two parts (southern and northern), which had different administrative subordination.

Traditional capital of Podlachia is Drohiczyn that lies into northern and southern parts. The former is included in the modern-day Podlaskie Voivodeship with its capital at Białystok (the historical boundary goes exactly through the city). Sometimes, Siedlce has been considered the capital of the region.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of Podlachia was introduced in 1569. It was created by combining the coats of arms of Poland (white eagle albeit without a crown) and Lithuania (mounted armoured knight holding a sword and shield with the Jagiellonian Double Cross).

==History==
Podlachia is a multicultural and multi-religious region. It is the region where people&#x27;s identity has been shaped throughout history by both the Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, and since the Reformation, also by Evangelical churches. Until today, Podlachia has been considered Poland&#x27;s most culturally diverse region. Throughout its early history, Podlachia was inhabited by various tribes of different ethnic roots. According to various sources, East Slavic tribes settled either in the 9th and 10th centuries (mostly Drevlians, with Dregoviches in the north and likely Dulebes in the south), or in the 11th and 12th centuries in the eastern and southern part. The Polish Masovians settled before the 11th century in the western part, as evidenced by Masovian-type strongholds from that period. In the 12th century, the northern part was settled by the Yotvingians, and afterwards the region was devastated by Yotvingian and Lithuanian raids. In the 13th century, the Yotvingians were driven out of Podlachia by Bolesław V the Chaste and Leszek II the Black, and the region was repopulated by Poles from Masovia, including minor nobility. Since the 13th century, Podlachia was contested by Poland and Lithuania, with varying ownership. In 1253 Pope Innocent IV recognized Polish sovereignty over Podlachia. In the 14th century, Polish King Casimir III the Great granted the southern part to Lithuania. In 1379, the Teutonic Knights ravaged the region and unsuccessfully besieged Mielnik and Brześć.

In the late 14th century the area passed to Mazovian Piast rule. In 1446, Podlachia became part of the Grand Duchy again, but from 1496 southwestern parts of Podlachia (Drohiczyn Land and Mielnik Land) and from 1501 the northern part (Bielsk Land) used Polish law instead of Lithuanian. A renewal of the Polish–Lithuanian union was concluded in Mielnik in 1501. In 1513 King Sigismund I the Old formed the Podlaskie Voivodeship (adjective of &quot;Podlasie&quot;). In 1566, the southeastern part of the Voivodeship became part of the newly formed Brest Litovsk Voivodeship as Brest Litovsk County.
In 1569, shortly before the Union of Lublin which formally united Poland and Lithuania as the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Podlasie was returned to the Kingdom of Poland by the &quot;Privilege of restoration of Podlasie land to the Polish Crown&quot;. It was the northernmost part of the Lesser Poland Province of Poland. The voivodeship was divided into three lands (): Drohiczyn, Mielnik and Bielsk. Knyszyn was the favorite residence of King Sigismund II Augustus, who died there in 1572, ending the reign of the Jagiellonian dynasty in Poland. Polish Renaissance writer Łukasz Górnicki, after his appointment as starost of Tykocin in 1572, resided and wrote many of his works in Lipniki in Podlachia.

Podlachia was subtracted by extensive royal estates, numerous small estates of the nobility (with the exception of the eastern and southern outskirts) and a dense network of small towns. Petty nobility often cultivated their land on their own, and there were many places where the nobility had no serfs, making certain parts of Podlachia, according to Polish historian, geographer and ethnographer Zygmunt Gloger, the place with the highest percentage of free agricultural population in Europe in the feudal era. Polish nobles in Podlachia became so numerous that from the 16th century some migrated to other regions, including Lesser Poland and Lithuania, where they often made significant fortunes.

In the 17th and early 18th century, the chief regional royal residence in Podlachia was Tykocin. In December 1630, King Sigismund III Vasa and his family took shelter there from an epidemic, and in 1633 Władysław IV Vasa also stopped there. In 1653, Podlachia itself was hit by an epidemic. The region was invaded by Sweden during the Deluge, but in 1657, Poles recaptured Tykocin. In 1661, renowned Polish military commander Stefan Czarniecki was granted the Tykocin starostwo with the towns of Tykocin and Białystok as a reward for his military service during the Swedish invasion of Poland of 1655–1660. Two Polish Protestant synods were held in Podlachia, a Calvinist one in Orla in 1644 and a Lutheran one in Węgrów in 1780. Tykocin was the place where the Order of the White Eagle, Poland&#x27;s oldest and highest order, was established.

During the Swedish invasion of Poland of 1701–1706, in 1702, Tykocin was the place of talks between delegates of Poland and Sweden. In 1704, Podlachia protested against the election of Stanisław Leszczyński as King of Poland. Swedish and Russian troops often passed through the region during the war.
In the 18th and 19th century the private town of Białystok became the main center of the region, thanks to the patronage of the Branicki family and the development of the textile industry. Due to the city&#x27;s palace, parks and edifices, Białystok was dubbed the &quot;Versailles of Podlachia&quot;. At that time, Polish kings traveling through Podlachia mainly resided in Białystok, i.e. Augustus II the Strong in 1726 and 1729 and Augustus III of Poland in 1744, 1752 and 1755. The School of Civil and Military Engineering, Poland&#x27;s first military technical college, and &quot;Komedialnia&quot;, one of the oldest theaters in Poland, were founded in Białystok in 1745 and 1748, respectively. Białystok was a regional brewing center with 33 breweries as of 1771, with the Podlachian Beer now listed as a protected traditional beverage by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland.

In 1733, during the War of the Polish Succession, supporters of Augustus III retreated from Warsaw to Węgrów. In 1767, Jan Klemens Branicki and Wacław Rzewuski protested against the Radom Confederation in Brańsk.

=== Partition and Napoleonic Wars ===
Following the 1795 Third Partition of Poland, Podlachia was divided between the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg monarchy (Austrian Empire from 1804), with the Bug forming the border between them. Part of Podlachia&#x27;s eastern border became the boundary between Prussia and the Russian Empire. Within Prussia the Podlachian territory was organised as part of the Białystok Department of New East Prussia, which also included parts of the former Mazovian and Trakai Voivodeships; the Habsburg portion lay mostly within the Siedlce of West Galicia (Galicia and Lodomeria from 1803).

In 1807, by the Treaties of Tilsit, Prussia ceded all of its gains in the second and third partitions, as well as part of the first. Most of this territory, including the western and northern parts of Prussian Podlachia, became part of the Duchy of Warsaw, a Polish client state of the First French Empire, while the east-central part including Białystok fell under Russian rule as the Belostok Oblast. The Podlachian territory within the Belostok Oblast corresponded with the Bielsk and Drohiczyn Uyezds (roughly &quot;counties&quot;) and the western part of Belostoksky Uyezd. The small amounts of Podlachian territory in the Duchy of Warsaw lay within the Łomża Department, itself based on the territory of the Prussian Białystok Departement after the removal of the Belostock Oblast. The Habsburg part of Podlachia became part of the Duchy of Warsaw by the 1809 Treaty of Schönbrunn, forming much of the Siedlce Department. Although Prussian and Austrian rule was brief, it has remained administratively divided by the Bug ever since.

=== Russian rule ===

At the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815, the Congress of Vienna transformed most of the Duchy of Warsaw, including the formerly Podlachian parts, into &quot;Congress Poland&quot; (formally the Kingdom of Poland) and placed it in a personal union with Russia; with that, all of Podlachia fell under Russian control. In theory this kingdom was created as an autonomous entity but in practice its separate laws and freedoms were simply ignored by the Emperors and control was steadily centralised, particularly following the November and January Uprisings (1830–31, 1863–64). Within Congress Poland the former Siedlce Department became the Podlachia Voivodeship, while the former Łomża Department became the Augustów Voivodeship; these became the Podlachian and Augustów Governorates in 1837.

In 1842 the Belostok Oblast was dissolved and merged into Grodno Governorate, and the Drohiczyn Uyezd was merged into Bielsk Uyezd. In 1844 the Podlachian Governorate was merged into the Lublin Governorate.

In the second half of the 19th century, Białystok grew into a significant center of the textile industry, the largest after Łódź in then-partitioned Poland. Białystok was the largest industrial center between Warsaw and Łódź in the west, Saint Petersburg in the north and Moscow in the east, and was nicknamed &quot;Manchester of the North&quot;.

In the 19th century the region was a stronghold of Polish resistance against Russian rule. The battles of Węgrów and Siemiatycze, both fought in Podlachia in 1863, were among the largest battles of the January Uprising. Stanisław Brzóska, the last partisan of the January Uprising, operated there until 1865. He was hanged publicly by the Russians in Sokołów Podlaski in May 1865. As a result of the uprising, in 1867 Congress Poland was formally absorbed into Russia as the Vistula Land (Privislinsky Krai), although the Kingdom still nominally existed. The Podlachian Governorate was also restored under the name Siedlce Governorate, and the Augustów Governorate was split between the Łomża and Suwałki Governorates; Augustów itself went to Suwałki Governorate while the rest of the Podlachian territory went to the Łomża Governorate.

According to the Russian Imperial Census of 1897, the most spoken languages in the Siedlce Governorate were Polish (66.13%), Yiddish (15.56%) and Ukrainian (13.95%). At the same time the most spoken languages in Bielsk Uyezd were Ukrainian (39.1%), Polish (34.9%), Yiddish (14.9%), Russian (5.9%) and Belarusian (4.9%); those in the Białystok Uyezd were Polish (33.95%), Yiddish (28.34%), Belarusian (26.13%), Russian (6.68%) and German (3.59%).

In 1912 Siedlce Governorate was once again abolished and divided between the Lublin, Łomża and Kholm Governorates, with all three gaining some parts of the former Podlachia; Kholm Governorate was also removed administratively from the Vistula Land, instead being made part of the Kiev General Governorate.

=== World War I and interbellum ===
During World War I the area was occupied by the German Empire, with most of the Vistula Land falling under the Government General of Warsaw (later the Central Powers puppet Kingdom of Poland) while the areas further east, including Białystok and the Suwałki Governorate, fell under .
In the aftermath of World War I and the Russian Revolution, parts of the region, particularly Białystok, were contested by several states but ultimately became part of the Second Polish Republic following the Polish–Soviet War. During the interwar period the northern part fell entirely within the Białystok Voivodeship while the southern part belonged to the Lublin Voivodeship; the April 1938 reforms transferred Węgrów and Sokołów from Lublin to the Warsaw Voivodeship.

=== World War II to present ===
In 1939 Poland was invaded and partitioned between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Although the border agreed upon in the Pact would have given all of Podlachia to the Soviet Union, the final border agreed upon in the German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty signed after the invasion gave the southern part to the Nazi General Government, while the northern part of Podlachia was annexed by the Soviet Union as the Belastok Region of the Byelorussian SSR. Nazi Germany would annex the Soviet part as the Bialystok District in 1941. The Polish resistance movement was active in the region, with Białystok becoming the seat of one of the six main commands of the Union of Armed Struggle in occupied Poland (alongside Warsaw, Kraków, Poznań, Toruń and Lwów).
Under German occupation, the population was subjected to mass arrests, executions and deportations to forced labour, concentration camps and Nazi ghettos, whereas under Soviet occupation the population was subjected to mass arrests, executions, deportations to forced labour in Siberia, Central Asia and the Far North. Sites of German massacres of either Polish or Jewish civilians include Mień, Olszewo (also Polish prisoners of war), Moskwin, Grabarka, Białystok, Tykocin, Rajsk, Paulinów, Krasowo-Częstki, Wnory-Wandy, Jabłoń-Dobki (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). Nowosiółki was the site of a massacre of hundreds of patients of a psychiatric hospital as part of &quot;Aktion T4&quot;. German forces also committed crimes against Italian and French POWs at subcamps of the Stalag 366 POW camp with executions and massacres of Italians and French in Międzyrzec Podlaski and Hola, respectively, with the Italians also subjected to mass starvation, epidemics, beatings and killings at Biała Podlaska. Many Poles from Podlachia were among the victims of the Soviet-perpetrated Katyn massacre.

The region once again returned to Polish control in 1945.

In 1999 the modern Podlaskie Voivodeship was established which encompasses the northern part of historic Podlachia, including Białystok and Drohiczyn, as well as surrounding areas, including Łomża and Suwałki. Its southern border lies along the Bug.

==Demographics==

===Ethnic situation===

While today Podlachia is mostly inhabited by Poles, many Belarusians live in the eastern parts. According to Polish census of 2002, in Podlaskie Voivodeship there were 46,041 Belarusians (3.9%) and 1,366 Ukrainians (0.1%). Autochthonous inhabitants have difficulties in national self-identification and identifying of their language. They often identify their nationality as &quot;tutejszy&quot; (literally &quot;locals&quot;). Based on comparison of a survey and the census, Marek Barwiński supposes that people with a low level of national identity during the census usually choose the major nationality in their region.

Orthodox autochthonous inhabitants are known as &quot;khakhly&quot; (without any negative connotations, though today in Ukraine it is known as an ethnic slur for Ukrainians). According to Mykhailo Lesiv, this name appeared after it was used to denote locals in the Russian Imperial Army. Many scientific researches prove that the orthodox population in Podlachia have Ukrainian origin (19th century censuses, historical and linguistic researches), though today the number of people with the Ukrainian identity is very small.

Until the 19th century, Podlachia was populated by the Polish-speaking yeomanry (&quot;drobna szlachta&quot;), Jews (primarily in towns), and Ruthenian Greek-Catholics speaking a dialect related to modern Ukrainian – the so-called &quot;Khakhlak&quot; (&quot;Chachlak&quot;) dialect, which derived its name from a derogatory term for Ukrainians (&quot;khakhol&quot; or &quot;khokhol&quot; being the name of the traditional haircut of Ukrainian Cossacks).

In the 19th century, the inhabitants of Podlachia were under the rule of the Russian Empire, with southern Podlachia constituting a part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. After 1831, Russian authorities forbade the Greek-Catholic faith in northern Podlachia and it disappeared from the area. In 1875, Russians forbade this rite in the southern portion as well, and all Greek-Catholic inhabitants were forced to accept the Eastern Orthodox faith. However, the resistance of the local people was surprisingly strong and Ruthenian speakers from this area rejected the separation from the Pope. In 1874, blessed Wincenty Lewoniuk and 12 companions were killed by Russian soldiers in Pratulin. In reaction to these measures, the Ruthenians of southern Podlachia began to identify themselves with the national movement of the Roman Catholic Poles. To preserve the full communion with the Pope, they changed their rite from Eastern to Latin before the compulsory conversion of Greek Catholics into Orthodox. In 1912, Russian authorities issued a tolerance edict that made it possible to change confession from Orthodox to Roman Catholic (but not to Greek-Catholic, which had been completely deleted). A majority of the inhabitants of southern Podlachia changed their faith from Orthodox to Roman Catholic. At present, very few people in this area speak Ruthenian and nearly all consider themselves Poles. Meanwhile, the eastern part of northern Podlachia is still populated by Belarusians.

Podlachia is also the cultural center of Poland&#x27;s small Tatar minority as well. After the annexation of eastern Poland into the Soviet Union following World War II, Poland was left with only two Tatar villages, Bohoniki and Kruszyniany (both outside the historical borders of Podlachia). Some Tatars from the territories annexed to the USSR have been repatriated to Poland and clustered in cities, particularly Białystok. In 1925 the Muslim Religious Union (Muzułmański Związek Religijny) was formed in Białystok. In 1992, the Union of Tatars of the Republic of Poland (Związek Tatarów Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej) with autonomous branches in Białystok and Gdańsk began operating.

===Language===
The dominant language in Podlaskie Voivodeship is Polish. Autochthonous inhabitants speak a Podlachian variety. Many linguists relate them to the Ukrainian language. Linguists have been exploring them since 19th century, when they were also known as Siedlce dialects (because of the name of Siedlce Governorate, where the dialects were mostly investigated). There is a problem if they should be considered as part of or as a separate subgroup of of the Ukrainian language. In the Northern Podlachia Podlachian subdialects are also often considered to be Belarusian dialects or sometimes Ruthenian dialects.

Since the locals are known as &quot;khakhly&quot;, the local language is also called &quot;Khakhlatska mova&quot; (, &quot;khokhols&#x27; language&quot;). S. Zhelekhov wrote in 1884 that the people call their language &quot;Polesian, but those, who were in the army (in the soldiers) call it Khakhlatska&quot;.

<text>In music, a hexachord (also hexachordon) is a six-note series, as exhibited in a scale (hexatonic or hexad) or tone row. The term was adopted in this sense during the Middle Ages and adapted in the 20th century in Milton Babbitt&#x27;s serial theory. The word is taken from the , compounded from ἕξ (&quot;hex&quot;, six) and χορδή (&quot;chordē&quot;, string [of the lyre], whence &quot;note&quot;), and was also the term used in music theory up to the 18th century for the interval of a sixth (&quot;hexachord major&quot; being the major sixth and &quot;hexachord minor&quot; the minor sixth).

==Middle Ages==

The hexachord as a mnemonic device was first described by Guido of Arezzo, in his &quot;Epistola de ignoto cantu&quot;. In each hexachord, all adjacent pitches are a whole tone apart, except for the middle two, which are separated by a semitone. These six pitches are named &quot;ut&quot;, &quot;re&quot;, &quot;mi&quot;, &quot;fa&quot;, &quot;sol&quot;, and &quot;la&quot;, with the semitone between &quot;mi&quot; and &quot;fa&quot;. These six names are derived from the first syllable of each half-verse of the first stanza of the 8th-century Vesper hymn &quot;Ut&quot; queant laxis &quot;re&quot;sonare fibris / &quot;Mi&quot;ra gestorum &quot;fa&quot;muli tuorum, etc. Melodies with a range wider than a major sixth required the device of mutation to a new hexachord. For example, the hexachord beginning on C and rising to A, named &quot;hexachordum naturale&quot;, has its only semitone between the notes E and F, and stops short of the note B or B. A melody moving a semitone higher than &quot;la&quot; (namely, from A to the B above) required changing the &quot;la&quot; to &quot;mi&quot;, so that the required B becomes &quot;fa&quot;. Because B was named by the &quot;soft&quot; or rounded letter B, the hexachord with this note in it was called the &quot;hexachordum molle&quot; (soft hexachord). Similarly, the hexachord with &quot;mi&quot; and &quot;fa&quot; expressed by the notes B and C was called the &quot;hexachordum durum&quot; (hard hexachord), because the B was represented by a squared-off, or &quot;hard&quot; B. Starting in the 14th century, these three hexachords were extended in order to accommodate the increasing use of signed accidentals on other notes.

The introduction of these new notes was principally a product of polyphony, which required the placing of a perfect fifth not only above the old note B, but also below its newly created variant, this entailing, as a result of the &quot;original sin&quot; committed by the well-meant innovation B, the introduction of the still newer respective notes F and E, with as consequences of these last C and A, and so on. The new notes, being outside the gamut of those ordinarily available, had to be &quot;imagined&quot;, or &quot;feigned&quot; (it was long forbidden to write them), and for this reason music containing them was called &quot;musica ficta&quot; or &quot;musica falsa&quot;.

==20th century==
Allen Forte in &quot;The Structure of Atonal Music&quot; redefines the term &quot;hexachord&quot; to mean what other theorists (notably Howard Hanson in his &quot;Harmonic Materials of Modern Music: Resources of the Tempered Scale&quot;) mean by the term &quot;hexad&quot;, a six-note pitch collection which is not necessarily a contiguous segment of a scale or a tone row. David Lewin used the term in this sense as early as 1959. Carlton Gamer uses both terms interchangeably.

<text>Karen Anne Carpenter (March 2, 1950 – February 4, 1983) was an American musician who was the lead vocalist and early drummer of the highly successful duo The Carpenters, formed with her older brother Richard. With a distinctive three-octave contralto range, she was praised by her peers for her vocal skills. Carpenter&#x27;s work continues to attract praise, including appearing on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2010 list of the 100 greatest singers of all time.

Carpenter was born in New Haven, Connecticut, and moved to Downey, California, in 1963 with her family. She began to study the drums in high school and joined the Long Beach State choir after graduating. After several years of touring and recording, the Carpenters were signed to A&amp;M Records in 1969, achieving enormous commercial and critical success throughout the 1970s. Initially, Carpenter was the band&#x27;s full-time drummer, but she gradually took the role of frontwoman as her drumming was reduced to a handful of live showcases or tracks on albums. 

In 1975, Carpenter started exhibiting symptoms of anorexia nervosa due to the severe pressures of fame and her complicated family dynamics. She was never able to recover and died at the age of 32 in 1983 from complications of the disease, which was little-known outside celebrity circles at the time; Carpenter&#x27;s death sparked worldwide attention and research into eating disorders and body dysmorphia. Interest in her life and death has spawned numerous documentaries and films.

==Early life==
Karen Anne Carpenter was born on March 2, 1950, at Grace New Haven Hospital (now called Yale New Haven Hospital) in New Haven, Connecticut, the daughter of Agnes Reuwer (March 5, 1915 – November 10, 1996) and Harold Bertram Carpenter (November 8, 1908 – October 15, 1988). Harold was born in Wuzhou, China, where his parents were missionaries. Before finding work in the printing business, he was educated at boarding schools in the United Kingdom.

Carpenter&#x27;s elder brother, Richard, developed an interest in music at an early age, becoming a piano prodigy. Karen&#x27;s first words were &quot;bye-bye&quot; and &quot;stop it&quot;, the latter spoken in response to Richard. She enjoyed dancing and by age four was enrolled in tap dancing and ballet classes; later on, she liked to play softball in the street.

The family moved in June 1963 to the Los Angeles suburb of Downey, after Harold was offered a job there by a former business associate. Carpenter entered Downey High School in 1964 at age 14 and was a year younger than her classmates. She joined the school marching band, initially to avoid exercising for gym classes. Bruce Gifford, the conductor (who had previously taught her brother), gave her the glockenspiel, an instrument she disliked, and after admiring the performance of her friend and classmate, drummer Frankie Chavez (who had been playing from an early age and idolized jazz drummer Buddy Rich), she asked if she could play those instead. Carpenter wanted a Ludwig drum set because it was used by her favorite drummers, Joe Morello and Ringo Starr. Chavez persuaded her family to buy her a $300 (the equivalent of $ in ) Ludwig kit, and he began to show her how to play. Her enthusiasm for drumming led to teaching herself how to play complicated lines and studying stick control, drum styles, playing technique, and grips like traditional and matched grip. She was talented, rehearsed every day and within a year, she could play in complex time signatures, such as the  in Dave Brubeck&#x27;s &quot;Take Five&quot;. Carpenter began to study drum technique with Bill Douglass, a well-respected jazz drummer with Benny Goodman and Art Tatum, and soon after she acquired a professional drum kit.

Carpenter was initially nervous about performing in public, but said she &quot;was too involved in the music to worry about it&quot;. She graduated from Downey High School in the spring of 1967, receiving the John Philip Sousa Band Award, and enrolled as a music major at Long Beach State, where she performed in the college choir with Richard. Karen subsequently became more confident in singing and began to take lessons with Frank Pooler, the choir&#x27;s director. She worked with him on developing the upper register so she would have a full three-octave range and he taught her a mixture of classical and pop singing. Pooler later said &quot;Karen was a born pop singer&quot;. By age 17, her voice &quot;was a remarkable instrument&quot;.

==Career==

=== Early years ===
The first public performance of Karen and Richard was in a local production of Frank Loesser&#x27;s musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;. Carpenter&#x27;s first band was Two Plus Two, an all-girl trio formed with friends from Downey High. They split up after one of the mothers refused to give her daughter permission to attend their first gig. In 1965, Karen, Richard, and his college friend Wes Jacobs, a bassist and tuba player, formed the Dick Carpenter Trio. The band rehearsed daily and played jazz in nightclubs. Richard later said he was impressed with his sister&#x27;s musical talent, adding that she would &quot;speedily maneuver the sticks as if she had been born in a drum factory&quot;. She did not sing at this point; instead, singer Margaret Shanor guested on some numbers. The trio signed a contract with RCA Records and recorded two instrumentals, but they were not released.

In April 1966, the Carpenters were invited to audition at a session with bassist Joe Osborn, well known for being part of the studio-musician collective the Wrecking Crew. Though she was initially expected to just be the drummer, Karen tried singing and impressed everyone there with her distinctive voice. Osborn signed a recording contract with her for his label, Magic Lamp Records; he was not particularly interested in Richard&#x27;s involvement.

In 1967, Jacobs left the trio to study at the Juilliard School, and the Carpenter siblings were keen to try out other musical styles. Along with other musicians, including Gary Sims and John Bettis, the siblings formed the group Spectrum, which focused on a harmonious vocal sound and recorded many demo tapes in Osborn&#x27;s garage studio, working out how to overdub voices onto multitrack tape. Many of those tapes were rejected by record companies. The group had difficulty attracting a live following, as their sound was too dissimilar from the hard rock and psychedelic rock then popular in clubs.

In 1968, the Dick Carpenter Trio also appeared on the TV talent show &quot;Your All American College Show&quot;, performing &quot;Dancing in the Street&quot; with Carpenter playing the drums and singing. The Trio won the finals that year.

===Carpenters===

A&amp;M Records signed the Carpenters to a recording contract in 1969. Karen started out as both the group&#x27;s drummer and co-lead singer, and she originally sang all of her vocals from behind the drum set. She sang most of the songs on the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Offering&quot; (later retitled &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;); her brother wrote ten of the album&#x27;s thirteen songs and sang on five of them. The opening and concluding tracks were sung by both siblings in unison. As well as drumming, Karen played bass guitar on two songs, &quot;All of My Life&quot; and &quot;Eve&quot;, under Osborn&#x27;s guidance. On &quot;All I Can Do&quot;, she played in 5/4 time, while &quot;Your Wonderful Parade&quot; featured multiple snare and bass drum overdubs to emulate the sound of a marching band. The track &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, a Beatles song that later became the album&#x27;s title track, was released as the Carpenters&#x27; first single; it reached No. 54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Their next album, 1970&#x27;s &quot;Close to You&quot;, featured two hit singles: &quot;(They Long to Be) Close to You&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;ve Only Just Begun&quot;. They peaked at No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, on the Hot 100.

Because she was just tall, it was difficult for people in the audience to see Karen behind her kit. After reviews complained that the group had no focal point in live shows, Richard and manager Sherwin Bash persuaded her to stand at the microphone to sing the band&#x27;s hits while another musician played the drums (former Disney Mouseketeer Cubby O&#x27;Brien served as the band&#x27;s other drummer for many years). She initially struggled in live performances singing solo, as she felt more secure behind the drum kit. After the release of &quot;Now &amp; Then&quot; in 1973, the albums tended to have Carpenter singing more and drumming less, and she did become the focal point of all records and live performances; Bash said &quot;she was the one that people watched&quot;. Starting with the Carpenters&#x27; 1976 concert tour and continuing thereafter, she would perform a showcase in which she moved around the stage playing various configurations of drums. Her studio performances benefited from close miking that captured the nuances of her voice well. Though she had a three-octave range, many of the duo&#x27;s hits prominently feature her lower contralto singing, leading her to quip, &quot;The money&#x27;s in the basement.&quot;
Carpenter always considered herself a &quot;drummer who sang&quot;. She preferred Ludwig Drums, including the Ludwig SuperSensitive snare, which she favored greatly. However, she did not drum on every Carpenters recording. She was the only featured drummer on &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; and on &quot;Now &amp; Then&quot;, except for &quot;Jambalaya&quot;. According to Hal Blaine, Karen played on many of the album cuts and he played on most of the Carpenters&#x27; studio sessions when she did not play drums herself, but Karen was informed about Blaine&#x27;s involvement and she approved on the basis that she and Richard wanted hit singles. The duo was happy for Blaine to take the role in the studio, as he was a respected session musician and it was easier to record Carpenter&#x27;s guide vocal without it spilling onto the drum mics. Blaine complemented Karen&#x27;s drumming skills, but believed her greatest strength was as a vocalist and thought himself more adept at working in a recording studio, which required a different approach from that of an onstage performance. On &quot;Made in America&quot;, Karen provided percussion on &quot;Those Good Old Dreams&quot; in tandem with Paulinho da Costa, and played drums on the song &quot;When It&#x27;s Gone (It&#x27;s Just Gone)&quot; in unison with Larrie Londin.

In the mid-1970s, Richard Carpenter developed an addiction to Quaaludes. The Carpenters frequently canceled tour dates, and stopped touring altogether after their September 4, 1978 concert at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. In 1980, Karen performed a medley of standards in a duet with Ella Fitzgerald on the Carpenters&#x27; television program &quot;Music, Music, Music&quot;. In 1981, after release of the &quot;Made in America&quot; album (which turned out to be their last), the Carpenters returned to the stage and went on some promotional tours, including an appearance for the BBC program &quot;Nationwide&quot;.

&quot;Now&quot; was the last song Carpenter recorded, in April 1982. Though Richard was concerned about her health, he still thought her voice sounded as good as ever.

===Solo===
Carpenter released her first solo record, &quot;Looking for Love&quot; / &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Yours&quot;, in 1967 on Osborn&#x27;s Magic Lamp label. Only 500 copies were pressed, and the label folded shortly afterwards. In 1979, while Richard took a year off to treat his addiction, Karen started recording in New York for a solo album with producer Phil Ramone. The sessions produced music that was different from the usual Carpenters material, tending more toward disco and up-tempo numbers, with more mature lyrics and taking full advantage of Karen&#x27;s upper vocal register.

The album met with a tepid response from Richard and A&amp;M executives in early 1980 and was shelved by A&amp;M Records co-owner Herb Alpert, in spite of attempts by producer Quincy Jones to convince him to release the solo record after a remix. A&amp;M subsequently charged Carpenter $400,000 to cover the cost of recording her unreleased album, to be paid out of the duo&#x27;s future royalties.

A portion of the solo album was commercially released in 1989, when some of its tracks as Richard&#x27;s remixes were included on the album &quot;Lovelines&quot;, the final album of previously unreleased material from the Carpenters. Not until 1996 was the complete solo album, titled &quot;Karen Carpenter&quot;, finally released as originally intended. Rob Hoerburger wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that it may not have been the album to define Carpenter&#x27;s career, &quot;but it holds up with anything that like-minded singers – Streisand, Newton-John – were recording at the time&quot;.

==Personal life==
Carpenter had a complicated relationship with her parents. The family moved to Los Angeles from Connecticut in order for Richard to enter the music business but were not aware of Karen&#x27;s musical talent. She continued to live with them until 1974. In 1976, Carpenter bought two Century City apartments that she combined into one, and the doorbell chimed the opening notes of &quot;We&#x27;ve Only Just Begun.&quot; She collected Disney memorabilia and liked to play softball and baseball. As a child, she had played baseball with other children on the street and was selected before her brother for games. She studied baseball statistics carefully and became a fan of the New York Yankees. In the early 1970s, she became the pitcher on a celebrity all-star softball team.

Carpenter&#x27;s celebrity friends included Petula Clark, Olivia Newton-John, and Dionne Warwick. While she was enjoying success as a female drummer in what was primarily an all-male occupation, Carpenter&#x27;s ideas were not in line with the women&#x27;s liberation movement, saying that she felt that a wife should cook for her husband because men were unskilled at cooking and that she planned to do so when she married.

In early interviews, Carpenter showed no interest in marriage or dating, believing that a relationship would not survive constant touring, adding &quot;as long as we&#x27;re on the road most of the time, I will never marry.&quot; In 1976, she said that the music business created difficulty in meeting people and that she refused to wed simply for the sake of being married. Carpenter admitted to Newton-John that she longed for a happy marriage and family. She later dated several notable men including Mike Curb, Tony Danza, Terry Ellis, Tom Bahler, Mark Harmon, Steve Martin, Alan Osmond, and Bill Hudson. After a whirlwind romance, she married real-estate developer Thomas James Burris on August 31, 1980, in the Crystal Room of The Beverly Hills Hotel. Burris, divorced with an 18-year-old son, was nine years her senior. A few days prior to the ceremony, Carpenter was taped singing a new song, &quot;Because We Are in Love&quot;, and the tape was played for guests during the wedding ceremony. The song, written by her brother and John Bettis, was released in 1981. The couple settled in Newport Beach.

Carpenter wanted children, but Burris had undergone a vasectomy, which he refused to reverse. The marriage did not survive this disagreement and ended after 14 months. Burris was living beyond his means, borrowing as much as $50,000 () at a time from Carpenter. According to Carpenter&#x27;s friend Karen Kamon, the marriage was &quot;the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back. It was absolutely the worst thing that could have ever happened to her.&quot;

In September 1981, Carpenter revised her will and left her marital home and its contents to Burris, but left everything else to her brother and parents, a fortune estimated at between $5 million and $10 million ($ million and $ million in ). Two months later, following an argument after a family dinner in a restaurant, Carpenter and Burris parted ways. Carpenter filed for divorce on October 28, 1982, while she was a patient at Lenox Hill Hospital.

==Health and death==
Carpenter began dieting while in high school. Under a doctor&#x27;s guidance, she began the Stillman diet, eating lean foods, drinking eight glasses of water a day and avoiding fatty foods. She reduced her weight to and stayed approximately at that weight until around 1973 when the Carpenters&#x27; career reached its peak. That year, she saw a concert photo of herself and felt that her clothing made her appear heavy. She hired a personal trainer, who advised her to change her diet. The new diet built muscle, which made her feel heavier instead of slimmer. Carpenter fired the trainer and began her own weight-loss program using exercise equipment and counting calories. She lost about and intended to lose another 5 pounds (2.3 kg). Her eating habits also changed around this time; she would try to remove food from her plate by offering tastes to others with whom she was dining.

By September 1975, Carpenter weighed . At live performances, fans reacted with gasps to her gaunt appearance, and many wrote to the pair to ask what was wrong. She refused to declare publicly that she was suffering from an eating disorder; in a 1981 &quot;Nationwide&quot; TV-interview, when asked point blank about anorexia, she simply said she was &quot;pooped&quot;. However, she and those around her knew that something was wrong. Dionne Warwick wrote that when meeting Carpenter for lunch in New York in 1981, &quot;It was shocking to see how very thin she was.&quot; In an interview after Karen&#x27;s death, Richard said that he was aware that Karen was unhealthily dieting starting around 1975 but that neither he nor their parents knew how to help her. In 1981, she told Richard that there was a problem and that she needed help with it. Carpenter spoke with Cherry Boone, who had recovered from anorexia, and contacted Boone&#x27;s doctor for help. She was hoping to find a quick solution to her problem, as she had performing and recording obligations, but the doctor told her that treatment could last from one to three years. She then chose to be treated in New York City by psychotherapist Steven Levenkron.

By late 1981, Carpenter was taking thyroid-replacement medication, which she obtained using the name of Karen Burris, to increase her metabolism. She used the medication in conjunction with increased consumption (as many as 90 tablets per night) of the laxatives upon which she had long relied, which caused food to pass quickly through her digestive tract. Despite Levenkron&#x27;s treatment, including confiscation of medications that Carpenter had misused, her condition continued to deteriorate, and she lost more weight eventually reaching an all time low of 77 pounds. She told Levenkron that she felt dizzy and that her heart was beating irregularly. In September 1982, she was admitted to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, where she was placed on intravenous parenteral nutrition. The procedure was successful, and she gained 30 pounds in a relatively short time, but this put a strain on her heart, which was already weak from years of anorexia. She maintained a relatively stable weight for the rest of her life.

Carpenter returned to California in November 1982, determined to reinvigorate her career, finalize her divorce and begin a new album with Richard. On December 17, 1982, she performed for the last time as she sang Christmas carols for her godchildren, their classmates and other friends at the Buckley School in Sherman Oaks, California. Carpenter&#x27;s last public appearance occurred on January 11, 1983, at a gathering of past Grammy Award winners who were commemorating the awards show&#x27;s 25th anniversary. She seemed somewhat frail and fatigued, but according to Warwick, Carpenter was vibrant and outgoing, exclaiming, &quot;Look at me! I&#x27;ve got an ass!&quot; She also began to write songs for the first time after returning to California and told Warwick that she had &quot;a lot of living left to do”.

On February 1, 1983, Carpenter saw her brother for the last time and discussed new plans for the group including touring. On February 4, Carpenter was scheduled to sign papers to finalize her divorce. Shortly after waking up that morning, she collapsed on the floor of a walk-in closet at her parents&#x27; home in Downey. Paramedics found her unconscious and in cardiac arrest, with her heart beating once every 10 seconds (6 bpm). She was rushed by ambulance to Downey Community Hospital, where she was pronounced dead at 9:51 a.m., at the age of 32.

Carpenter&#x27;s funeral was held on February 8, 1983, at Downey United Methodist Church. Approximately 1,000 mourners attended, including her friends Dionne Warwick, Dorothy Hamill, Olivia Newton-John, and Petula Clark. Her estranged husband, Thomas Burris, placed his wedding ring into her casket. Carpenter was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Cypress, California. In 2003, her body was moved, along with those of her parents, to a private mausoleum at the Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Memorial Park in Westlake Village, California.

An autopsy released on March 11, 1983, discounted drug overdose, attributing Carpenter&#x27;s death to &quot;emetine cardiotoxicity due to or as a consequence of anorexia nervosa.&quot; Her blood sugar level at the time of death was 1,110 milligrams per deciliter (61.6 mmol/L), more than 10 times the average. Two years later, the coroner told colleagues that Carpenter&#x27;s heart failure was caused by repeated use of ipecac syrup, an over-the-counter drug (emetic) often used to induce vomiting in cases of overdosing or poisoning. This claim was disputed by Levenkron, who said that he had never known her to use ipecac and that he had not seen evidence that she had been vomiting. Carpenter&#x27;s friends were convinced that she had abused laxatives and thyroid medication to maintain her low body weight and felt that the problem had begun after her marriage began to fail.

== Legacy and cultural impact ==
Reacting to Carpenter&#x27;s death, songwriter Burt Bacharach said that she &quot;had a sound in her voice that was very unique, that I haven&#x27;t heard before.&quot;

Carpenter&#x27;s singing has attracted critical praise and influenced several significant musicians and singers, including Madonna, Sheryl Crow, Pat Metheny, Sonic Youth&#x27;s Kim Gordon, Shania Twain, Natalie Imbruglia, and k.d. lang. Paul McCartney has said that she had &quot;the best female voice in the world: melodic, tuneful and distinctive&quot;. She has been called &quot;one of the greatest voices of our lifetime&quot; by Elton John. In the BBC documentary &quot;Only Yesterday: The Carpenters Story&quot;, her friend Nicky Chinn said that John Lennon walked up to her at a Los Angeles restaurant and told her &quot;I want to tell you, love, that you&#x27;ve got a fabulous voice.&quot; Her drumming has been praised by fellow musicians Hal Blaine, Cubby O&#x27;Brien and Buddy Rich, and by &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine. She appeared in the drummer rankings of every &quot;Playboy&quot; annual music poll from 1974 to 1980; &quot;Playboy&quot;″s readers voted her as high as tenth best drummer in 1975 and tenth best pop/rock drummer 1976.

On October 12, 1983, eight months after her death, the Carpenters received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1999, VH1 ranked Carpenter at No. 29 on its list of the 100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll. In 2010, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Carpenter No. 94 on its list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time, calling her voice &quot;impossibly lush and almost shockingly intimate&quot;, adding &quot;even the sappiest songs sound like she was staring directly into your eyes&quot;.

Carpenter&#x27;s death brought media attention to conditions such as anorexia nervosa; the condition had not been widely known beforehand. Her family started the Karen A. Carpenter Memorial Foundation, which raised money for research on anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders.

Carpenter became known to some fans as &quot;Lead Sister.&quot; This originated from a mispronunciation of &quot;lead singer&quot; by a Japanese journalist in 1974, and she later wore a T-shirt with the nickname during live shows.

== Biographies ==
A 43-minute film titled &quot;&quot;, directed by Todd Haynes, was released in 1987, and featured Barbie dolls as the characters. It was withdrawn from circulation in 1990 after Haynes lost a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by Richard Carpenter. The film&#x27;s title is derived from the Carpenters&#x27; 1971 hit song &quot;Superstar&quot;. Over the years, it has developed into a cult film and was included in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s 2003 list of the top 50 cult movies.

On January 1, 1989, the similarly titled made-for-TV movie &quot;The Karen Carpenter Story&quot; aired on CBS with Cynthia Gibb in the title role. Gibb lip-synched the songs to Carpenter&#x27;s recorded voice, with the exception of &quot;The End of the World&quot;. Both films use the song &quot;This Masquerade&quot; in the background while showing Carpenter&#x27;s marriage to Burris. The movie helped revive the Carpenters&#x27; critical standing and increased their music&#x27;s popularity.

Richard Carpenter helped in the production of the documentaries &quot;Close to You: Remembering The Carpenters&quot; (1997) and &quot;Only Yesterday: The Carpenters Story&quot; (2007).

Randy Schmidt wrote a biography about Carpenter entitled &quot;Little Girl Blue&quot;, published in 2010, which included a foreword by Warwick. It provides a different perspective than those of the other officially endorsed biographies, and it was based on interviews with other friends and associates. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the book was &quot;one of the saddest tales in pop.&quot;

In 2021, long-time Carpenters historian Chris May and Associated Press entertainment journalist Mike Cidoni Lennox published &quot;Carpenters: The Musical Legacy&quot;, based on interviews with Richard Carpenter. It features rare photographs and newly revealed stories behind the making of the albums. &quot;Goldmine&quot; said the book &quot;provided a candid and detailed look at much of what went into the Carpenters&#x27; sound as well as Richard&#x27;s personal thoughts on the music business today.&quot;

<text>A scram or SCRAM is an emergency shutdown of a nuclear reactor effected by immediately terminating the fission reaction. It is also the name that is given to the manually operated kill switch that initiates the shutdown. In commercial reactor operations, this type of shutdown is often referred to as a &quot;scram&quot; at boiling water reactors, a &quot;reactor &quot;trip&quot;&quot; at pressurized water reactors and &quot;EPIS&quot; at a CANDU reactor. In many cases, a scram is part of the routine shutdown procedure which serves to test the emergency shutdown system.

==Etymology==
There is no definitive origin for the term. United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission historian Tom Wellock notes that &quot;&quot; is English-language slang for leaving quickly and urgently (as in scrambling to get away), and he cites this as the original and most likely accurate basis for the use of &quot;scram&quot; in the technical context.

Scram is sometimes cited as being an acronym for safety control rod axe man or safety cut rope axe man. This was supposedly coined by Enrico Fermi when he oversaw the construction of the world&#x27;s first nuclear reactor. The core, which was built under the spectator seating at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Stagg Field, had an actual control rod tied to a rope with a man with an axe standing next to it; cutting the rope would mean the rods would fall by gravity into the reactor core, shutting the reactor down. The axe man at the first chain reaction was Norman Hilberry. In a letter to Raymond Murray (January 21, 1981), Hilberry wrote:

When I showed up on the balcony on that December 2, 1942 afternoon, I was ushered to the balcony rail, handed a well sharpened fireman&#x27;s axe and told, &quot;If the safety rods fail to operate, cut that manila rope.&quot; The safety rods, needless to say, worked, the rope was not cut... I don&#x27;t believe I have ever felt quite as foolish as I did then. ...I did not get the SCRAM [Safety Control Rod Axe Man] story until many years after the fact. Then one day one of my fellows who had been on Zinn&#x27;s construction crew called me Mr. Scram. I asked him, &quot;How come?&quot; And then the story.

Leona Marshall Libby, who was present that day at the Chicago Pile, recalled that the term was coined by Volney Wilson who led the team that designed the control rod circuitry:

The safety rods were coated with cadmium foil, and this metal absorbed so many neutrons that the chain reaction was stopped. Volney Wilson called these &quot;scram&quot; rods. He said that the pile had &quot;scrammed,&quot; the rods had &quot;scrammed&quot; into the pile.

 Other witnesses that day agreed with Libby&#x27;s crediting &quot;scram&quot; to Wilson. Wellock wrote that Warren Nyer, a student who worked on assembling the pile, also attributed the word to Wilson: &quot;The word arose in a discussion Dr. Wilson, who was head of the instrumentation and controls group, was having with several members of his group,&quot; Nyer wrote. &quot;The group had decided to have a big button to push to drive in both the control rods and the safety rod. What to label it? &#x27;What do we do after we punch the button?,&#x27; someone asked. &#x27;Scram out of here!,&#x27; Wilson said. Bill Overbeck, another member of that group said, &#x27;OK I&#x27;ll label it SCRAM.

The earliest references to &quot;scram&quot; among the Chicago Pile team were also associated with Wilson&#x27;s shutdown circuitry and not Hilberry. In a 1952 U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) report by Fermi, the AEC declassified information on the Chicago Pile. The report includes a section written by Wilson&#x27;s team shortly after the Chicago Pile achieved a self-sustaining chain reaction on December 2, 1942. It includes a wiring schematic of the rod control circuitry with a clearly labeled &quot;SCRAM&quot; line (see image on the right and pages 37 and 48).

The Russian name, AZ-5 (, in Cyrillic), is an abbreviation for (), which translates to &quot;emergency protection of the 5th category&quot; in English.

==Mechanisms==

In any reactor, a scram is achieved by inserting large amounts of negative reactivity mass into the midst of the fissile material, to immediately terminate the fission reaction. In light-water reactors, this is achieved by inserting neutron-absorbing control rods into the core, although the mechanism by which rods are inserted depends on the type of reactor. In pressurized water reactors the control rods are held above a reactor&#x27;s core by electric motors against both their own weight and a powerful spring. A scram is designed to release the control rods from those motors and allows their weight and the spring to drive them into the reactor core, rapidly halting the nuclear reaction by absorbing liberated neutrons. Another design uses electromagnets to hold the rods suspended, with any cut to the electric current resulting in an immediate and automatic control rod insertion.

In boiling water reactors, the control rods are inserted up from underneath the reactor vessel. In this case a hydraulic control unit with a pressurized storage tank provides the force to rapidly insert the control rods upon any interruption of the electric current. In both the PWR and the BWR there are secondary systems (and often even tertiary systems) that will insert control rods in the event that primary rapid insertion does not promptly and fully actuate.
Liquid neutron absorbers (neutron poisons) are also used in rapid shutdown systems for heavy and light water reactors. Following a scram, if the reactor (or section(s) thereof) are not below the shutdown margin (that is, they could return to a critical state due to insertion of positive reactivity from cooling, poison decay, or other uncontrolled conditions), the operators can inject solutions containing neutron poisons directly into the reactor coolant.

Neutron poison solutions are water-based solutions that contain chemicals that absorb neutrons, such as common household borax, sodium polyborate, boric acid, or gadolinium nitrate, causing a decrease in neutron multiplication, and thus shutting down the reactor without use of the control rods. In the PWR, these neutron absorbing solutions are stored in pressurized tanks (called accumulators) that are attached to the primary coolant system via valves. A varying level of neutron absorbent is kept within the primary coolant at all times, and is increased using the accumulators in the event of a failure of all of the control rods to insert, which will promptly bring the reactor below the shutdown margin.

In the BWR, soluble neutron absorbers are found within the standby liquid control system, which uses redundant battery-operated injection pumps, or, in the latest models, high pressure nitrogen gas to inject the neutron absorber solution into the reactor vessel against any pressure within. Because they may delay the restart of a reactor, these systems are only used to shut down the reactor if control rod insertion fails. This concern is especially significant in a BWR, where injection of liquid boron would cause precipitation of solid boron compounds on fuel cladding, which would prevent the reactor from restarting until the boron deposits were removed.

In most reactor designs, the routine shutdown procedure also uses a scram to insert the control rods, as it is the most reliable method of completely inserting the control rods, and prevents the possibility of accidentally withdrawing them during or after the shutdown.

==Reactor response==
Most neutrons in a reactor are prompt neutrons; that is, neutrons produced directly by a fission reaction. These neutrons move at a high velocity, so they are likely to escape into the moderator before being captured. On average, it takes about 13 μs for the neutrons to be slowed by the moderator enough to facilitate a sustained reaction, which allows the insertion of neutron absorbers to affect the reactor quickly.

As a result, once the reactor has been scrammed, the reactor power will drop significantly almost instantaneously. A small fraction (about 0.65%) of neutrons in a typical power reactor comes from the radioactive decay of a fission product. These &quot;delayed neutrons&quot;, which are emitted at lower velocities, will limit the rate at which a nuclear reactor will shut down.

Due to flaws in its original control rod design, scramming an RBMK reactor could raise reactivity to dangerous levels before lowering it. This was noticed when it caused a power surge at the startup of Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant Unit number 1, in 1983. On April 26, 1986, the Chernobyl disaster happened due to a fatally flawed shutdown system, after the AZ-5 shutdown system was initiated after a core overheat. RBMK reactors were subsequently either retrofitted to account for the flaw, or decommissioned.

===Decay heat===

Not all of the heat in a nuclear reactor is generated by the chain reaction that a scram is designed to stop. For a reactor that is scrammed after holding a constant power level for an extended period (greater than 100 hrs), about 7% of the steady-state power will remain after initial shutdown due to fission product decay that cannot be stopped. For a reactor that has not had a constant power history, the exact percentage is determined by the concentrations and half-lives of the individual fission products in the core at the time of the scram.

The power produced by decay heat decreases as the fission products decay, but it is large enough that failure to remove decay heat may cause the reactor core temperature to rise to dangerous levels and has caused nuclear accidents, including the nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island and Fukushima I.

<doc id="431102" wikidata="Q898087" url="?curid=431102" title="1st Czechoslovak Independent Armoured Brigade">
<text>The 1st Czechoslovak Independent Armoured Brigade Group () was an armoured unit of expatriate Czechoslovaks organised and equipped by the United Kingdom during the Second World War in 1943.

The brigade landed in Normandy in August 1944 and was given the mission of containing the German-held port of Dunkirk for the rest of the war in Europe. In May 1945, the brigade moved to Czechoslovakia and was absorbed into the Czechoslovak Army.

==Formation==
The 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade was created on 1 September 1943, when the 1st Czechoslovak Independent Brigade (itself originally formed as 1st Czechoslovak Mixed Brigade in July 1940 from remnants of the 1st Czechoslovak Division serving in the French Army) converted to armour and was renamed the 1st Czechoslovak Independent Armoured Brigade Group (this was often simplified to 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade or abbreviated 1st CIABG). The brigade was under the command of Major General Alois Liška. The motorised infantry battalion of the brigade traced its lineage back to Czechoslovak units that had fought in Libya and Lebanon, notably the 11th Infantry Battalion which took part in the defence of Tobruk.

==Siege of Dunkirk==

The formation continued to train in the UK until the summer of 1944 when, with some 4,000 troops under command, it moved to Normandy, joining 21st Army Group at Falaise on 30 August. On 6 October, the brigade advanced to Dunkirk, northern France, and relieved the 154 (Highland) Infantry Brigade on the eastern side of fortress Dunkirk. The brigade was subordinated to the First Canadian Army, which was responsible for the conduct of the siege.

The brigade&#x27;s tank units were primarily equipped with the Cromwell tank and a number of 17-pounder Sherman tanks (Sherman Firefly), Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger tanks and M5 Stuart light tanks. Crusader AA tanks were dispatched with the brigade but believed not to have been used. They were supported by a Motor Battalion in M5 Half-tracks and Universal Carriers, an anti-tank battery of 12 Ordnance QF 17-pounder anti-tank guns and a Field Artillery Regiment of two batteries of Ordnance QF 25 pounder gun-howitzers. The unit was supported by a Reconnaissance Squadron that used Humber Light Reconnaissance Cars, M5 Stuarts, Humber scout cars and Cromwell tanks.

1st Brigade spent the remainder of the war at Dunkirk, alternately attacking and being attacked by the energetic German garrison, including a successful major raid on German positions on 28 October 1944, Czechoslovak Independence Day. During that time, the brigade was reinforced by French units formed from local French Forces of the Interior (FFI) troops; on 15 October, these were amalgamated into the 110th FFI Infantry Regiment with two battalions allocated for the Siege of Dunkirk. On 24 January 1945, the 110th FFI Regiment was disbanded, with two its battalions and two other FFI battalions used to re-form the French 51st Infantry Regiment, a unit of the regular army. Various British and Canadian formations also supported the siege at one time or another.

In November, the brigade passed from the First Canadian Army to the 21st Army Group. In the spring of 1945, the 1st Armoured Brigade Group was expanded to 5,900 Czechoslovak officers and men, some of whom came from nationals recruited in liberated France and a significant group of a tank battalion, an artillery regiment, a motor transport company and a company of engineers from Czechs and Slovaks forced to serve in the Wehrmacht and who were captured by the Allies in Normandy.

==Return to Czechoslovakia==

On 23 April, a symbolic 140-men strong unit detached from the troops besieging Dunkirk, led by Major Sítek, joined with the 3rd US Army and raised the Czechoslovak flag on its homeland border crossing on 1 May 1945 at Cheb.

The Dunkirk garrison did not surrender until after the surrender of Germany, 9 May 1945, when 15,500 German troops and three U-boats were captured by the Czechoslovaks. The brigade then marched to Prague, reaching the city on 18 May 1945, eight days after the arrival of Soviet-sponsored Czechoslovak troops commanded by Ludvík Svoboda.

During the siege of Dunkirk, the Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade suffered 668 casualties; 167 dead, 461 wounded, and 40 missing.

<text>During the Second World War, the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade, later known as the Princess Irene Brigade () was a Dutch military unit initially formed from approximately 1,500 troops, including a small group guarding German prisoners-of-war, who arrived in the United Kingdom in May 1940 following the collapse of the Netherlands. Elements of this force became the nucleus of what was originally called the &quot;Dutch Legion.&quot;

Veterans of the Princess Irene Brigade who were members of the Dutch Army stationed at Wrottesley Park, Wolverhampton during World War II were given the Freedom of the City of Wolverhampton on 19 August 2006.

==History==
===Formation===
Although augmented by conscription from overseas citizens from Canada, the United States, the Middle East, the Dutch West Indies (Netherlands Antilles and Suriname), South Africa and Argentina; the Dutch force grew very slowly as troops were detached for other duties i.e. the Commandos, the Navy etc. The unit never totalled more than about 2,000 men at one time with a total of around 3,000 serving, less than the 3,000 to 4,000 personnel normally associated with a brigade.

While some 500 Surinamese volunteered for service in the brigade, they were rejected by the Dutch government, on the grounds that their racial background might cause offense to volunteers and conscripts from South Africa. Despite this some Surinamese did serve in the Brigade and fight during WW2. Some Dutch West Indian personnel nevertheless later saw action with the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army in the Pacific theatre.

The brigade would be trained first in Guelph, then Stratford, Ontario alongside British units.

On 11 February 1941, by approval of Queen Wilhelmina, the Dutch Legion gained a new name, the Prinses Irene Brigade (P.I.B.).

On 6 August 1944, the first troops of the P.I.B landed at Graye-sur-Mer Normandy, in northern France. Later, the main force landed and the P.I.B. served under the First Canadian Army until it moved forward with the British Second Army. Heavy fighting took place around the Chateau St Come (&quot;Hellfire Corner&quot;) and the brigade liberated Pont Audemer in the progress.
In mid-September, the P.I.B. became involved in fighting with German forces at the town of Beringen.

===Operation Market Garden===
It first re-entered Dutch territory at Borkel en Schaft on 20 September 1944, as part of Operation Market Garden — the operation to simultaneously capture nine bridges between the Bocholt-Herentals Canal and the Rhine (at Arnhem). At around this time, the brigade was also involved in combat against the Dutch Waffen-SS volunteer formation &quot;Landstorm Nederland&quot;, German SS, and paratroopers. From 26 September, the P.I.B guarded the then unnamed bridge spanning the River Maas at Grave. (The bridge known later as &quot;John S. Thompsonbrug&quot;, was the longest to attack and defend during the operation.)

On 24 October, the brigade was ordered to move south-west to Tilburg to attack the town from the south during Operation Pheasant while the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division attacked from the east. The P.I.B. was unable to get to Tilburg and was stranded at Broekhoven, where fighting took place and four soldiers were killed.

The Prinses Irene Brigade spent the winter of 1944/45 in the region of Walcheren and Noord-Beveland (Zeeland), losing several soldiers. From Zeeland, the P.I.B. went back to North Brabant.

On 31 March 1945, the commander of the P.I.B., Colonel De Ruyter van Steveninck, said goodbye to the three platoons of Marines; the latter subsequently formed II Independent Company and were sent to the USA to join the Royal Netherlands Marines Brigade, who had originally assigned these troops to the P.I.B. so the brigade would have enough troops participating in the liberation of Europe, as requested by the British government. The gap left by the Dutch Marines was filled with replacements from the volunteers from the liberated parts of the Netherlands, who had been trained at Bergen Op Zoom under the command of Frank Looringh van Beeck, a South African officer.

On 2 March 1945, the P.I.B. was put under the command of the Netherlands District, under Major General A Galloway, based at the HQ in the city of Tilburg.

===Operation &quot;Orange&quot;===
The P.I.B. was involved in heavy fighting in the town of Hedel, north of Den Bosch, on the River Maas in April 1945. The P.I.B. was supposed to link up with the 30 Royal Marines, of the 116th Infantry Brigade Royal Marines, at Kerkdriel in an attempt to liberate the Bommelerwaard. However, the Royal Marines gave up due to German opposition in the town of Kerkdriel, leaving the P.I.B. stranded at the bridgehead of Hedel. The Prinses Irene Brigade was under command of the 116th Infantry Brigade Royal Marines at this time. Still, they fought the Germans with great gallantry, and were able to hold the town for three days. In these fights, the P.I.B. lost twelve men; around thirty were wounded. Several gallantry medals were later awarded for actions in Hedel. At 11:15 hours on 25 April the order to withdraw from the bridgehead, in Hedel, came from 116th Infantry Brigade Royal Marines. At 23:30 hours III Independent Company withdrew from the town as the last unit to the south side of the river Maas. This effort was completed at 00:30 hours on 26 April.

The Princess Irene Brigade entered The Hague on 9 May 1945 as liberators. After the war, the traditions of the brigade were perpetuated by the Garderegiment Fuseliers Prinses Irene.

<text>Petrified wood (from Ancient Greek meaning &#x27;rock&#x27; or &#x27;stone&#x27;; literally &#x27;wood turned into stone&#x27;), is the name given to a special type of &quot;fossilized wood&quot;, the fossilized remains of terrestrial vegetation. &quot;Petrifaction&quot; is the result of a tree or tree-like plants having been replaced by stone via a mineralization process that often includes permineralization and replacement. The organic materials making up cell walls have been replicated with minerals (mostly silica in the form of opal, chalcedony, or quartz). In some instances, the original structure of the stem tissue may be partially retained. Unlike other plant fossils, which are typically impressions or compressions, petrified wood is a three-dimensional representation of the original organic material.

The petrifaction process occurs underground, when wood becomes buried in water or volcanic ash. The presence of water reduces the availability of oxygen which inhibits aerobic decomposition by bacteria and fungi. Mineral-laden water flowing through the sediments may lead to permineralization, which occurs when minerals precipitate out of solution filling the interiors of cells and other empty spaces. During replacement, the plant&#x27;s cell walls act as a template for mineralization. There needs to be a balance between the decay of cellulose and lignin and mineral templating for cellular detail to be preserved with fidelity. Most of the organic matter often decomposes, however some of the lignin may remain. Silica in the form of opal-A, can encrust and permeate wood relatively quickly in hot spring environments. However, petrified wood is most commonly associated with trees that were buried in fine grained sediments of deltas and floodplains or volcanic lahars and ash beds. A forest where such material has petrified becomes known as a petrified forest.

==Formation==

Petrified wood forms when woody stems of plants are buried in wet sediments saturated with dissolved minerals. The lack of oxygen slows decay of the wood, allowing minerals to replace cell walls and to fill void spaces in the wood.

Wood is composed mostly of holocellulose (cellulose and hemicellulose) and lignin. Together, these substances make up 95% of the dry composition of wood. Almost half of this is cellulose, which gives wood much of its strength. Cellulose is composed of long chains of polymerized glucose arranged into microfibrils that reinforce the cell walls in the wood. Hemicellulose, a branched polymer of various simple sugars, makes up the majority of the remaining composition of hardwood while lignin, which is a polymer of phenylpropanes, is more abundant in softwood. The hemicellulose and lignin encrust and reinforce the cellulose microfibrils.

Dead wood is normally rapidly decomposed by microorganisms, beginning with the holocellulose. The lignin is hydrophobic (water-repelling) and much slower to decay. The rate of decay is affected by temperature and moisture content, but exclusion of oxygen is the most important factor preserving wood tissue: Organisms that decompose lignin must have oxygen for their life processes. As a result, fossil wood older than Eocene (about 56 million years old or older) has lost almost all its holocellulose, and only lignin remains. In addition to microbial decomposition, wood buried in an alkaline environment is rapidly broken down by inorganic reactions with the alkali.

Wood is preserved from decomposition by rapid entombment in mud, particularly mud formed from volcanic ash. The wood is then mineralized to transform it to stone. Non-mineralized wood has been recovered from Paleozoic formations, particularly &quot;Callixylon&quot; from Berea Sandstone, but this is very unusual. The petrified wood is later exposed by erosion of surrounding sediments. Non-mineralized fossil wood is rapidly destroyed when exposed by erosion, but petrified wood is quite durable.

Some 40 minerals have been identified in petrified wood, but silica minerals are by far the most important. Calcite and pyrite are much less common, and others are quite rare. Silica binds to the cellulose in cell walls via hydrogen bonding and forms a kind of template. Additional silica then replaces the cellulose as it decomposes, so that cell walls are often preserved in great detail. Thus silicification begins within the cell walls, and the spaces within and between cells are filled with silica more gradually. Over time, almost all the original organic material is lost; only around 10% remains in the petrified wood. The remaining material is nearly pure silica, with only iron, aluminum, and alkali and alkaline earth elements present in more than trace amounts. Iron, calcium, aluminum are the most common, and one or more of these elements may make up more than 1% of the composition.

Just what form the silica initially takes is still a topic of research. There is evidence of initial deposition as opal, which then crystallizes to quartz over long time periods. On the other hand, there is some evidence that silica is deposited directly as quartz.

Wood can become silicified very rapidly in silica-rich hot springs. While wood petrified in this setting is only a minor part of the geologic record, hot spring deposits are important to paleontologists because such deposits sometimes preserve more delicate plant parts in exquisite detail. These Lagerstätte deposits include the Paleozoic Rhynie Chert and East Kirkton Limestone beds, which record early stages in the evolution of land plants.

Most of the color in petrified wood comes from trace metals. Of these, iron is the most important, and it can produce a range of hues depending on its oxidation state. Chromium produces bright green petrified wood. Variations in color likely reflect different episodes of mineralization. In some cases, variations may come from chromatographic separation of trace metals.

Wood can also be petrified by calcite, as occurs in concretions in coal beds. Wood petrified by calcite tends to retain more of its original organic material. Petrification begins with deposition of goethite in the cell walls, followed by deposition of calcite in the void spaces. Carbonized wood is resistant to silicification and is usually petrified by other minerals. Wood petrified by minerals other than silica minerals tends to accumulate heavy metals, such as uranium, selenium, and germanium, with uranium most common in wood high in lignin and germanium most common in wood preserved in coal beds. Boron, zinc, and phosphorus are anomalously low in fossil wood, suggesting they are leached away or scavenged by microorganisms.

Less commonly, the replacement minerals in petrified wood are chalcocite or other sulfide minerals. These have been mined as copper ore at locations such as the Nacimiento Mine near Cuba, New Mexico.

===Simulated petrified wood===
Scientists have attempted to duplicate the process of petrification of wood, both to better understand the natural petrification process and for its possible use as a ceramic material. Early attempts used sodium metasilicate as a source of silica, but tetraethyl orthosilicate has proven more promising.

==Uses==


Petrified wood has limited use in jewelry, but is mostly used for decorative pieces such as book ends, table tops, clock faces, or other ornamental objects. A number of Ancestral Puebloan structures near Petrified Forest National Park were constructed of petrified wood, including the Agate House Pueblo. Petrified wood is also used in New Age healing.

==Occurrences==
Petrified wood is found worldwide in sedimentary beds ranging in age from the Devonian (about 390 million years ago), when woody plants first appeared on dry land, to nearly the present. Petrified &quot;forests&quot; tend to be either entire ecosystems buried by volcanic eruptions, in which trunks often remain in their growth positions, or accumulations of drift wood in fluvial environments. Amethyst Ridge at Yellowstone National Park shows 27 successive forest ecosystems buried by eruptions, while Petrified Forest National Park is a particularly fine example of fluvial accumulations of driftwood.

Volcanic ash is particularly suitable for preservation of wood, because large quantities of silica are released as the ash weathers. The presence of petrified wood in a sedimentary bed is often an indication of the presence of weathered volcanic ash. Petrified wood can also form in arkosic sediments, rich in feldspar and other minerals that release silica as they break down. The warm super monsoon climates of the Carboniferous through Permian periods seem to have favored this process. Preservation of petrified forests in volcanic ash beds is less affected by climate and preserves a greater diversity of species.

<text>Eduardo Alonso Nájera Pérez () (born July 11, 1976) is a Mexican former professional basketball player who is currently a scout for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is also a pregame and postgame analyst on Mavericks Live on Fox Sports Southwest, where he is identified as Eddie Avila. Before being promoted to a scout with the Mavs, he was head coach of the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League. He is regarded as the greatest Mexican basketball player ever.

==Personal information==
Nájera was only the second Mexican-born NBA player (Horacio Llamas was the first) and was the first Mexican player to be drafted. He is the son of Servando Nájera and Rosa Irene Pérez.

==College basketball==
Nájera played college basketball at the University of Oklahoma, in Norman, Oklahoma, United States, from 1997 to 2000, becoming a major star there. He helped the team to four consecutive NCAA tournament appearances during his college career, as well as finishing in the school&#x27;s all-time top ten in nine statistical categories. Before being drafted into the NBA in 2000, Nájera received rave reviews from scouts, who boasted on Nájera&#x27;s quick first step and extraordinary rebounding ability. He is only the second Mexican-born player to join the NBA. He was the first Mexican player to be drafted into the NBA (Horacio Llamas being undrafted).

Nájera played for the Mexican team in the 1997 World University Games and helped them achieve a fourth-place finish in the 1999 World University Games.

== Professional career ==

=== Dallas Mavericks (2000–2004) ===
He saw significant action as a member of the Dallas Mavericks in 2000–01 and 2001–02, but recurrent knee injuries limited his action in his last two years in Dallas.

He coached at the first-ever Basketball Without Borders Americas tournament in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the 2004 NBA Summer of Goodwill.

=== Golden State Warriors (2004–2005) ===
On August 24, 2004, Nájera was traded along with Luis Flores, Christian Laettner, Mladen Sekularac, cash, a 2007 first round draft pick, and another future first round draft pick to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Erick Dampier, Dan Dickau, Evan Eschmeyer, and Steve Logan. In Golden State, Najera again put in modest minutes and was a solid contributor.

=== Denver Nuggets (2005–2008) ===

On February 24, 2005, Nájera was then sent to the Denver Nuggets along with Luis Flores and a future first-round pick in exchange for Nikoloz Tskitishvili and Rodney White, where he would have some of his most productive seasons as an NBA player.

Also in 2006, an exhibition match was played in Monterrey, Mexico, between the Golden State Warriors and the Denver Nuggets.

On April 27, 2006, Nájera started his first playoff game for the Nuggets in Game 3 of their first round series facing the Los Angeles Clippers. He replaced Kenyon Martin who was suspended indefinitely for &quot;conduct detrimental to the team&quot;.

He was partly involved in the December 2006 Knicks–Nuggets brawl. While not involved in the actual fighting, he did try to separate the players. He was ejected from the game for leaving the bench.

=== New Jersey Nets (2008–2010) ===
On July 11, 2008, Nájera signed a contract with the New Jersey Nets for 4 years $12 million. He stated that he would make it a point to turn the Nets&#x27; young forwards Yi Jianlian and Ryan Anderson and center Brook Lopez into stronger, tougher players. Nájera turned down more money and a chance to return to his college state, Oklahoma City Thunder. He also turned down an offer from the New Orleans Hornets in order to take a chance to lead a young and talented New Orleans team.

=== Return to Dallas (2010) ===
On January 11, 2010, Nájera was traded to the Dallas Mavericks for Kris Humphries and Shawne Williams.

=== Charlotte Bobcats (2010–2012) ===
On July 13, 2010, Nájera was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats along with Erick Dampier and Matt Carroll in exchange for Tyson Chandler and Alexis Ajinça. Nájera&#x27;s final NBA game ever was played on April 6, 2012, in a 90–95 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks where he only played for two minutes and recorded no stats, suffering a career-ending facial injury.

==Coaching career==
In 2012, after he retired as a player, Nájera became head coach of the NBA D-League&#x27;s Texas Legends. Prior to the 2015–16 season, Texas replaced him with his assistant coach, Nick Van Exel.

==Off the court==
In 2000, Eduardo Nájera was named Third Team All-American by both the Associated Press and the National Association of Basketball Coaches, being the first Mexican-born to be named so.

In 2000, Nájera graduated from the University of Oklahoma with a degree in sociology.

In the same year, he received the Chip Hilton Player of the Year Award from the Basketball Hall of Fame, an award given to a player who has demonstrated personal character both on and off the court.

In 2001, Nájera served as the United Nations Drug Control Programme Goodwill Ambassador for Sports Against Drugs. In 2004, he established the &quot;Eduardo Najera Foundation for Latino Achievement&quot;, which provides college scholarships for outstanding Latino students facing barriers to their educations, and in 2006, he received the Chopper Travaglini Award for demonstrating outstanding charity work in the Denver community.

<doc id="431119" wikidata="Q958761" url="?curid=431119" title="Secret of Evermore">
<text>Secret of Evermore is an action role-playing game developed and published by Square for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in North America on October 17, 1995, in Australia in February 1996, and in Europe in March 1996. A Japanese release was planned to follow the North American release by a few months but was ultimately cancelled.

The story of &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot; follows a boy and his shapeshifting pet dog as they are inadvertently transported to the fantasy world of Evermore. The player guides both characters through Evermore, a world composed of separate realms, each resembling a different period of real-world history: &quot;Prehistoria&quot; (prehistory), &quot;Antiqua&quot; (classical antiquity), &quot;Gothica&quot; (the Middle Ages), and &quot;Omnitopia&quot; (an imaginative future world). The gameplay shares many similarities with &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, such as real-time battles, a ring-shaped menu system, and the ability to switch control between the two characters. Despite similar game mechanics and a similar title, it is not an entry in the &quot;Mana&quot; series.

&quot;Secret of Evermore&quot; is unique in that it is the only game developed by Square designers in North America. The game received positive reviews upon its release for its graphics and gameplay but was criticized for not being up to the expectations many reviewers had based upon the developer&#x27;s previous Japanese role-playing games. The game&#x27;s North American development, &quot;Mana&quot;-like game mechanics, and ambient music have since helped it to develop a cult following.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Secret of Evermore&quot; takes many of its interface and gameplay aspects from &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;. The game consists mostly of an aerial view setting, where the boy and his dog negotiate the terrain and fend off hostile creatures. The player may choose to control either the boy or the dog, with the other being controlled by the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence. Both characters can find refuge in caves or a town, where they can regain their hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, either character can increase in level with improved stats such as strength and evasion. Options including changing equipment or casting alchemy spells; checking status can be performed quickly by rotating through the game&#x27;s Action Ring system. Combat takes place in real-time. Located below the player&#x27;s hit points is a percentage gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy, as well as how far the player can run. Swinging a weapon or running causes the gauge to fall to 0%. It then quickly recharges, allowing the character to attack at full strength or to run at full sprint once it is full. The gauge may also fill up to allowing the player to use charged attacks with equipped weapons.

The protagonist wields four different styles of weapons throughout the game: sword, spear, axe, and toward the end of the game, bazooka. Repeated use of them can increase their skill levels to a maximum of three, unlocking a new charged attack and increased range and power with each level; for instance, spears at a high enough level may be thrown at an enemy across the screen, while the swords and axes can cut swathes of destruction around the boy&#x27;s vicinity. The sword, axe, and spear get replaced with a more powerful variant in each realm, resetting their skill levels. Most swords, axes, and spears can cut through vegetation, while some weapons are required to break rocks and other barriers.

In the four worlds of &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot;, the in-game currency changes. The shopkeepers in Prehistoria exchange talons; in Antiqua, gemstones; in Gothica, gold coins; in Omnitopia, credits. There are individuals in each region who offer to convert the player&#x27;s money to the local currency. In either of the game&#x27;s two marketplaces (in Antiqua and Gothica, respectively), the storekeepers offer to trade in goods instead of money. Certain goods, such as rice, spices, and tapestries, can be bought using the local currency, but others must be exchanged for other goods. Most vendors only specialize in one type of good, and some rare items require an extensive amount of trading to obtain.

===Alchemy===
A unique element of &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot; is its magic system. To cast magic, the boy must be given an &quot;Alchemic Formula&quot; by one of the many non-playable characters called &quot;Alchemists&quot;. Some Alchemists make their home in out-of-the-way areas and will dispense rare formulas if the player manages to seek them out. Unlike some role-playing games, there are no magic points needed to cast spells. Alchemy Formulas require pairs of ingredients to be used; some are available throughout the game, and others are only native to certain environments. In the primitive realms, ingredients appear such as wax, limestone, clay, and ash. In the advanced realms, however, the ingredients become more complex, for example ethanol and dry ice.

A secondary function of the dog is to &quot;sniff out&quot; ingredients by putting his nose to the ground and smelling for items. The player can command the dog to search the ground at any time, including in huts and cities. If all goes well, the dog will lead his human companion to a certain spot on the map where the player can uncover the unseen ingredients. With repeated use, Alchemy Formulas will increase in level, enhancing their curative, offensive, or support effectiveness. Although there are dozens of Formulas available to be found within the game, only nine can be equipped at a time. To overcome this, there are several Alchemists scattered throughout the game who offer to manage the boy&#x27;s current Alchemy list; any formula that has already been learned can be stored by the Alchemist for later use.

==Plot==
===Setting===
The plot revolves around a teenage boy and his dog whom the player must name. Most of the game takes place in the fictional world of Evermore. The player explores four main areas within this world, corresponding to different historical eras: Prehistoria contains cavemen and dinosaurs; Antiqua boasts a colosseum and pyramid theme; Gothica contains medieval castles and is populated by dragons; Omnitopia is a futuristic space station.

Throughout their travels the boy, in the company of his dog, often quotes or mentions fictional B movies that relate to their current situation. For example, he compares himself to &quot;Dandy&quot; Don Carlisle in the film &quot;Sink, Boat, Sink&quot; after washing ashore at Crustacia. In addition, the dog&#x27;s body transforms based on the theme of the area that players are in: in the world of Prehistoria, the dog is transformed into a feral wolf; in the Antiqua region, he becomes a greyhound; in Gothica, he takes the form of a fancy poodle; and in Omnitopia, he becomes a robotic dog that resembles a toaster and is capable of shooting laser beams.

===Plot===
The story of &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot; begins with a black and white flashback to 1965, in a small town called Podunk, USA. In a laboratory situated on the roof of a mansion, a malfunction occurs which causes the area to flood with a white flash of light. Thirty years later, the game&#x27;s young protagonist is leaving a theater when his pet dog chases after a cat on the street. The boy hurriedly follows him, eventually reaching a large, abandoned mansion. He discovers the hidden laboratory with a large machine built in the center. When the dog begins to chew on some wires, the pair find themselves transported to the surreal world of Evermore, beginning in the space station Omnitopia. A butler dressed in a white tailcoat greets the boy when he appears, only to lock him in a room with several attack robots. The boy manages to escape in a shuttle pod, where he finds his dog holed up in the cockpit.

The shuttle crashlanded in a dense jungle on top of a plateau. When the boy emerges, he finds a ferocious-looking wolf has replaced his dog. He decides to perform a test to see if the wolf is really his pet dog. He tosses a stick for the wolf to fetch, but the wolf retrieves a giant bone instead. The boy shrugs this off and assumes the wolf is his dog.

In each realm, the boy encounters a citizen of Podunk involved in an original experiment gone awry 30 years before. Professor Sidney Ruffleberg and his three companions were transported to Evermore but are unable to leave. The boy quickly learns the regions are manifestations of those citizens&#x27; personal utopias. Each of the three companions acts as the ruler of his or her world: Elizabeth, the Professor&#x27;s niece, is the tribal chief of Prehistoria; Horace Highwater, curator of the Podunk Museum, oversees Antiqua; Camellia Bluegarden, a portly librarian, is the Queen of Gothica; Professor Ruffleberg monitors everything from Omnitopia, with his android butler, Carltron, alongside him. Within Prehistoria, Antiqua, and Gothica, the boy and his canine companion aid Elizabeth, Horace, and Camellia in thwarting attempts by Podunk citizens&#x27; robotic clones from ruling their respective areas.

The duo finally returns to Omnitopia and finds Ruffleberg, who explains everything. He and his butler Carltron once engaged in chess matches. Ruffleberg outfitted him with an intelligence chip to make him a more challenging opponent, but the upgrade backfired making Carltron more malevolent. He sabotaged the transporter to Evermore and designed the hostile beasts roaming the game. With Ruffleberg&#x27;s help, the boy and his canine companion break into Carltron&#x27;s room. The area is guarded by android clones of the boy and his dog, along with a giant mecha version of Carltron. At the last moment, Ruffleberg appears and deactivates Carltron, who promptly freezes in place.

With Carltron&#x27;s defeat, the monsters plaguing Evermore disappear, but the world itself grows unstable. The boy returns to each world to collect Ruffleberg&#x27;s companions, taking them back to the real world. In doing so, Evermore&#x27;s destruction is averted, and it continues to exist without them. After the credits roll, a final scene shows Professor Ruffleberg returning Carltron to his old task of cleaning the lab. Carltron grins and rubs his hands together, implying he is not as docile as the professor believes.

==Development==

In early 1994, the development of &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot; began at SquareSoft, the Redmond, Washington, office of the Japanese parent company Square. The concept of an &quot;American-flavored Secret-of-Mana-like&quot; game was dictated from overseas. Square Soft began work on the detailed storyline focused on a boy traveling with his dog through a world based on cheesy B movies. This led to popular culture references and dialog that are distinctly American for a mainstream console RPG. The game&#x27;s associate producer and writer, George Sinfield, decided they would be familiar to American players. The game&#x27;s working title was &quot;Vexx and the Mezmers&quot;. Producer Alan Weiss&#x27;s original concept had a group of magic users who &quot;could tell dream stories and transport the listeners into the experience, virtually&quot;. During a storytelling session, Vexx is trapped and starts to corrupt the dreams. The game was to have the player find Vexx and defeat him. Sinfield asked for its name to be changed. The studio had a naming competition which resulted in &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot;; composer Jeremy Soule claims to have been the team member who submitted the name &quot;Evermore&quot;.

Many elements of &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot; were copied from &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; because they had proven to be effective. The size of the game was an early issue. It was decided that it would be single-player to preserve memory—it was originally planned to be only 12-megabits. However, the game doubled to 24-megabits near the end of development. Daniel Dociu designed various pieces of concept art. Using computer software, including Alias 3D modeling software running on SGI workstations, the game&#x27;s artwork and design were mapped out by three animators, four background artists, and a 3D rendering artist. It was put together using the company&#x27;s SAGE (Square&#x27;s Amazing Graphical Editor) program, led by programmer Brian Fehdrau. Rather than having to hand off their work to the programmers, the artists and designers were able to test their ideas directly using the SAGE program. The final product of &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot; was produced using another company program, SIGIL (Square Interpreted Game Intelligence Language). One of the worlds that was cut was called Romancia &quot;where &#x27;everything is all flowers and sweet stuff, excessively so&#x27;. It was pink and purple&quot;.

There is a persistent misconception that the game is, or was released in lieu of, a follow-up to &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;. Other Square titles such as &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; and &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; were being localized simultaneously with the production of &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot;. Fehdrau explained in an interview that &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot; was not created in place of &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; and that the team that developed &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot; was assembled from newly hired staff and would otherwise never have been assembled. Several of the team members later joined Humongous Entertainment, which spawned Cavedog Entertainment, while the rest of the team spread to other Seattle-area game studios like Electronic Arts, Boss Game Studios, Microsoft Game Studios, and Gas Powered Games, among others.

&quot;Secret of Evermore&quot; was released on October 17, 1995, in North America. In 1996, it was translated into German, French and Spanish for the non-English-speaking market in some PAL territories, including Australia and New Zealand. Some PAL versions were packaged in a large box and included a strategy guide.

===Music===
Jeremy Soule composed and produced the score for &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot;, his first video game project. In high school Soule was a big fan of video games, but he felt most of their scores &quot;lacked drama and intensity&quot;. After completing high school, Soule created an experimental demo showcasing what he felt video game scores should sound like. Soule was hired by Square Soft after they had reviewed the demo to score &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot;. Soule describes it as a mix of ambient sounds and low-key music. The soundtrack was released on a CD containing 29 tracks, the first eight of which are arranged versions of the original sound. The disc was published by Square and was only available initially to those who pre-ordered &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Secret of Evermore&quot; received positive reviews from most media outlets. They praised its graphics. Scary Larry of &quot;GamePro&quot;, however, found the spell animations weak compared to those of other Square games, and said the bosses are large but strangely unimpressive. A highlight for some critics was gameplay, particularly the unique alchemy system and aspects also found in &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; such as the ring menu. Others found the mechanics needlessly hard to get used to. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; praised the game for its graphics, sound, play control, story, and variety but criticized it for its awkward battle system and simple A.I. Although the quality of the musical compositions and sound effects were praised, Scary Larry complained of the player character&#x27;s dog barking &quot;constantly&quot;.

&quot;Super Play&quot; and &quot;GamePro&quot; both felt the game was not up to the standards of other Square games. Victor Lucas of &quot;Electric Playground&quot; praised the game saying that while it did not reach the heights of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; or &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;, it was still a highly enjoyable experience. &quot;Mega Fun&quot; argued it was on par with those games, with graphics that were nearly as good. Others argued that &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot; was a decent first attempt by the American team. &quot;Game Players&quot; anticipated another game from the same development team, and a critic for &quot;Next Generation&quot; said that while the game suffered from a number of amateur mistakes, &quot;as a debut title for a new team of designers, it points to a rosy future&quot;. &quot;Video Games&quot; praised Squaresoft USA&#x27;s very first title, noting that while the menu and control schemes were taken from previous Square games, its mood, story, and setting were enough to set it apart from the earlier titles.

In a retrospective review, Allgame editor Scott Alan Marriott described the game as &quot;a good, solid RPG, but those expecting memorable characters or a dramatic, involving story will most likely be disappointed&quot;.

Three reviewers from &quot;GameFan&quot; praised the game. Two were skeptical that an American made role playing game could match Square&#x27;s internally produced titles such as &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, but they were impressed with the game. One reviewer, however, noted that he missed the Japanese-style art found in other Square games and although the art in &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot; was good, it was aimed at an American audience. In 2018, Complex rated &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot; 41st in their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Times&quot; list.

<doc id="431120" wikidata="Q163400" url="?curid=431120" title="1st Armoured Division (Poland)">
<text>The Polish 1st Armoured Division (Polish &quot;1 Dywizja Pancerna, Pierwsza Dywizja Pancerna&quot;) was an armoured division of the Polish Armed Forces in the West during World War II. Created in February 1942 at Duns in Scotland, it was commanded by Major General Stanisław Maczek and at its peak numbered approximately 18,000 soldiers. The division served in the final phases of the Battle of Normandy in August 1944 during Operation Totalize and the Battle of Chambois and then continued to fight throughout the campaign in Northern Europe, mainly as part of the First Canadian Army.

==History==


After the fall of Poland and then France in 1940, many of the remaining Poles that had fought in both campaigns retreated with the British Army to the United Kingdom.

===Formation===
Stationed in Scotland, the Polish 1st Armoured Division was formed as part of the Polish I Corps under Wladyslaw Sikorski, which guarded approximately 200 kilometres of British coast in 1940-1941. The commander of the Division, General Stanislaw Maczek, was Poland’s premier mechanized commander, and many of his subordinate officers from the unit he commanded in 1939, the 10th Mechanized Brigade, had made their way to Britain with him. They were organized on the British Armoured Division model, equipped with British uniforms, weapons and tanks. They were initially equipped and trained on Crusader tanks but in late 1943 and early 1944 these were replaced with Sherman tanks and Cromwell tanks. They then participated in war games together with the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division.

===Normandy===
By the end of July 1944, the 1st Armoured had been transferred to Normandy, its final elements arriving on 1 August on Arromanches, Grayes and Courseulles sur mer where a memorial has been erected. The unit was attached to the First Canadian Army as part of the 21st Army Group. This may have been done to help in communication, as the vast majority of Poles did not speak English when they arrived in United Kingdom from 1940 onwards. The Division joined combat on 8 August during Operation Totalize. It twice suffered serious casualties as a result of &quot;friendly fire&quot; from Allied aircraft, but achieved a victory against the Wehrmacht in the battles for Mont Ormel, and the town of Chambois. This series of offensive and defensive operations came to be known as the Battle of Falaise, in which a large number of German Army and SS divisions were trapped in the Falaise Pocket and subsequently destroyed. 

Maczek&#x27;s division had the crucial role of closing the pocket at the escape route of the trapped German divisions, hence the fighting was desperate and the 2nd Polish Armoured Regiment, 24th Polish Lancers and 10th Dragoons, supported by the 8th and 9th Infantry Battalions, took the brunt of German attacks by units attempting to break free from the pocket. Surrounded and running out of ammunition, they withstood incessant attacks from multiple fleeing panzer divisions for 48 hours until they were relieved. The total losses of the division from August 7 when it entered combat until the end of the battle of Falaise on August 22 were 446 killed, 1,501 wounded, and 150 missing, or 2,097 soldiers in total during about two weeks of fighting.

===Belgium and the Netherlands===
After the Allied armies broke out from Normandy, the Polish 1st Armoured Division pursued the Germans along the coast of the English Channel. It liberated, among others, the towns of Saint-Omer, Ypres, Oostnieuwkerke, Roeselare, Tielt, Ruislede, and Ghent. During Operation Pheasant a successful outflanking manoeuvre planned and performed by General Maczek allowed the liberation of the city of Breda without any civilian casualties (29 October 1944). The Division spent the winter of 1944-1945 on the south bank of the river Rhine, guarding a sector around Moerdijk, Netherlands. In early 1945, it was transferred to the province of Overijssel and started to push with the Allies along the Dutch-German border, liberating the eastern parts of the provinces of Drenthe and Groningen including the towns of Emmen, Coevorden and Stadskanaal.
===Germany===
In April 1945, the 1st Armoured entered Germany in the area of Emsland. On 6 May, the Division seized the Kriegsmarine naval base in Wilhelmshaven, where General Maczek accepted the capitulation of the fortress, naval base, East Frisian Fleet and more than 10 infantry divisions. There the Division ended the war and, joined by the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, undertook occupation duties until it was disbanded in 1947; it, together with the many Polish displaced persons in the Western occupied territories, formed a Polish enclave at Haren in Germany, which was for a while known as &quot;Maczków&quot;. The majority of its soldiers opted not to return to Poland, which fell under Soviet occupation, preferring instead to remain in exile. Many artefacts and memorabilia belonging to Maczek and the 1st Polish Armoured Division are on display in the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum in London.

<doc id="431125" wikidata="Q346036" url="?curid=431125" title="Keith Whitley">
<text>Jackie Keith Whitley (July 1, 1954 – May 9, 1989) was an American country music and bluegrass singer and songwriter. During his career, he released only two albums but charted 12 singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts, and 7 more after his death.

Born in Ashland, Kentucky, Whitley grew up in nearby Sandy Hook, Kentucky. He began his career there in 1970, performing in Ralph Stanley&#x27;s band. Establishing himself as a lead singer in bluegrass music, Whitley moved to Nashville in 1983 and began his recording career there. His first Top 20 Country Hit single, &quot;Miami, My Amy&quot;, was released in 1986. In 1988, his first three singles from his studio album &quot;Don&#x27;t Close Your Eyes&quot;, the title song, &quot;When You Say Nothing at All&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m No Stranger to the Rain&quot; were number one hits. Years of alcoholism severely compromised his health and he died of alcohol intoxication in 1989 at his Goodlettsville home at the age of 34. His later singles, &quot;I Wonder Do You Think of Me&quot;, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m Over You&quot;, were released after his death.

In 2022, Whitley was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Whitley was born to Faye Ferguson (editor of &quot;The Elliott County News&quot;) and Elmer Whitley (an electrician) in Ashland, Kentucky, but was raised 46 miles away in Sandy Hook, and attended Sandy Hook High School. He had two brothers, Randy and Dwight, and a sister, Mary. The Whitley family is of English and Scots-Irish descent and has lived in the Elliott County area since the 1840s.

While Whitley was a teenager in Sandy Hook, he and his friends would pass the time drinking bootleg bourbon and racing their cars down mountain roads at dangerous speeds. Whitley was once in a car whose driver attempted to round a curve at . The car wrecked, killing his friend and almost breaking Whitley&#x27;s neck. In another incident, he drove his car off a cliff into a frozen river, escaping with only a broken collar bone.

Whitley&#x27;s older brother Randy was killed in an October 1983 motorcycle accident.

== Musical style and influences ==
Keith Whitley&#x27;s musical style was rooted in Kentucky bluegrass in his early career as a member of Ralph Stanley&#x27;s Clinch Mountain Boys but Whitley later shifted towards neotraditional country and honky-tonk during the peak and end of his career. Whitley&#x27;s influences ranged from Appalachian bluegrass performers such as Ralph Stanley to traditional country and honky-tonk musicians such as Hank Williams, George Jones, Merle Haggard, and Lefty Frizzell.

==Musical career==
In 1969, he performed in a musical contest in Ezel, Kentucky, with brother Dwight on five-string banjo. Ricky Skaggs was also in the contest. Skaggs and Whitley instantly bonded and subsequently became close friends.

Whitley and Skaggs, both sixteen years old, were discovered in Ft. Gay, West Virginia, by Ralph Stanley, who was 45 minutes late for a gig due to a flat tire. Stanley opened the door of the club and heard what he thought was the Stanley Brothers playing on a jukebox. However, it was Whitley and Skaggs, who &quot;sounded just like me and Carter in the early days&quot;. The two soon joined Stanley&#x27;s band. Whitley became lead singer for Stanley in 1974. Whitley also played with J.D. Crowe &amp; the New South in the mid-1970s. During this period, he established himself as one of the most versatile and talented lead singers in bluegrass. His singing was heavily influenced by Carter Stanley and Lefty Frizzell. He moved to Nashville in 1983 to pursue a country music career and soon signed a record deal with RCA Records.

Whitley&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;A Hard Act to Follow&quot;, was released in 1984, and featured a more mainstream country style. While Whitley was working hard to achieve his own style, the songs he produced were inconsistent. Critics regarded the album as too erratic. Whitley honed his sound within the next few years for his next album, &quot;L.A. to Miami&quot;.

&quot;L.A. to Miami&quot;, released in 1985, would give him his first Top 20 country hit single, &quot;Miami, My Amy&quot;. The song was followed by three more hit songs: &quot;Ten Feet Away&quot;, &quot;Homecoming &#x27;63&quot;, and &quot;Hard Livin&#x27;&quot;, The album also included &quot;On the Other Hand&quot; and &quot;Nobody in His Right Mind Would&#x27;ve Left Her&quot;. &quot;On the Other Hand&quot; was pitched to Whitley before Randy Travis released the song as a single and when Whitley&#x27;s version wasn&#x27;t released as a single, Travis released his in 1986, as did George Strait with &quot;Nobody in His Right Mind Would&#x27;ve Left Her&quot;.

During his tour to promote &quot;L.A. to Miami&quot;, he met and began a romantic relationship with country singer Lorrie Morgan. They were married in November 1986 and had their only child, a son, Jesse Keith Whitley in June 1987. Whitley also adopted Lorrie&#x27;s daughter, Morgan, from her first marriage.

During the new recording sessions in 1987, Whitley began feeling that the songs chosen were not up to his standards, so he approached RCA and asked if the project of 15 songs could be shelved. He also asked if he could take a major role in creating the songs and in production. The new album, titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Close Your Eyes&quot;, was released in 1988, and the album sold extremely well. The album contained one of the many songs that Whitley had a hand in writing in his years at Tree Publishing, &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot;. On the album was a remake of Lefty Frizzell&#x27;s classic standard &quot;I Never Go Around Mirrors,&quot; and the song became a huge hit at Whitley&#x27;s concerts. The first three singles from the album—&quot;When You Say Nothing at All,&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m No Stranger to the Rain,&quot; and the title cut—all reached No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s country charts during the autumn of 1988 and the winter of 1989, with the title track &quot;Don&#x27;t Close Your Eyes&quot; being ranked as &quot;Billboard&quot;’s No. 1 Country song of 1988. Shortly thereafter, &quot;I&#x27;m No Stranger to the Rain&quot; also earned Whitley his first and only Country Music Association award as a solo artist and a Grammy nomination for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male.

In early 1989, Whitley approached RCA chairman Joe Galante with the intention of releasing &quot;I Never Go Around Mirrors&quot; as a single. Galante approved of the musical flexibility that Whitley achieved with the song; however, he suggested that Whitley record something new and more upbeat. The result was a song Whitley had optioned for his previous album called &quot;I Wonder Do You Think of Me&quot;, and was to result in his next album release.

Whitley was scheduled to be invited to join the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; in late May 1989. He was posthumously inducted as a former member on October 14, 2023, in a tribute concert held during that night&#x27;s &quot;Opry&quot; broadcast.

==Death==
On May 9, 1989, Whitley had a brief phone call with his mother and was later visited by his brother-in-law, Lane Palmer. The two had coffee and were planning a day of golf and lunch, after which Whitley planned to start writing songs for him and Lorrie Morgan to record when she returned from her concert tour. Palmer left at approximately , asking Whitley to be ready to leave within an hour. Upon returning, Palmer found Whitley unresponsive on his bed and called an ambulance. Whitley was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. He was 34.

The official cause of death was acute ethanolism (alcohol poisoning). Davidson County Medical Examiner Charles Harlan stated that Whitley&#x27;s blood alcohol level was 0.47 (the equivalent of 20 one-ounce shots of 100-proof whiskey). He was born in 1954 per his birth certificate and passport, but RCA and his grave marker erroneously recorded his birth year as 1955.

The day after his death, Music Row was lined with black ribbons in memory of Whitley. He is buried in the Spring Hill Cemetery outside Nashville. His gravestone reads, &quot;Forever yours faithfully&quot; (part one) and &quot;His being was my reason&quot; (part two).

==Posthumous releases==
At the time of his death, Whitley had just finished work on his third and final studio album, &quot;I Wonder Do You Think of Me&quot;. The album was released three months after his death, on August 1, 1989. The album produced two more No. 1 hits, with the title track and &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Nothin&#x27;.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Over You&quot; also was in the Top 5 in early 1990, reaching No. 3.

Two new songs were added to &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;: The first, &quot;Tell Lorrie I Love Her&quot; was written and recorded at home by Whitley for Morgan, originally intended as a work tape for Whitley&#x27;s friend Curtis &#x27;Mr. Harmony&#x27; Young to sing at Whitley&#x27;s wedding. The second was &quot;&#x27;Til a Tear Becomes a Rose&quot;, a 1987 demo taken from Tree that originally featured harmony vocals by childhood friend Ricky Skaggs. Lorrie Morgan, with creative control and license to Whitley&#x27;s namesake, recorded her voice alongside Whitley&#x27;s, and released it as a single, which rose to No. 13 and won them 1990&#x27;s CMA award for Best Vocal Collaboration as well as a Grammy nomination for Best Country Vocal Collaboration.

RCA also released a compilation of performance clips (from his days in the Ralph Stanley-Fronted Clinch Mountain Boys), interviews, and some previously unreleased material under the title &quot;Kentucky Bluebird&quot;. The album produced hits for Whitley as well, including a duet with Earl Thomas Conley, named &quot;Brotherly Love,&quot; which peaked at No. 2 in late 1991 and gave Whitley his second consecutive posthumous Grammy nomination for Best Country Vocal Collaboration.

In 1994, Whitley&#x27;s widow, Lorrie Morgan, organized several of Whitley&#x27;s friends in bluegrass and some of the big names in country at the time to record a tribute album to Whitley. The album, &quot;Keith Whitley: A Tribute Album&quot;, was released in September 1994 via BNA. It included covers of Whitley&#x27;s songs from artists such as Alan Jackson, Diamond Rio, and Ricky Skaggs. The album also included four previously unreleased tracks recorded by Whitley in 1987, one of which had Morgan dubbed in as a duet partner. The album also included two original songs: &quot;Little Boy Lost&quot;, co-written and sung by Daron Norwood, and &quot;A Voice Still Rings True&quot;, a multi-artist song. Alison Krauss&#x27;s rendition of &quot;When You Say Nothing at All&quot; was released as a single from the album, reaching number 3 on the country charts in 1995.

In 1995, the album &quot;Wherever You Are Tonight&quot; was released, produced by Lorrie Morgan, featuring restored demos of 1986–1988, with crisper 1990s recording techniques and a full orchestra. The album and single of the same name both did very well on the Billboard and R&amp;R charts and &quot;Super Hits&quot; and &quot;The Essential Keith Whitley&quot; followed in 1996. &quot;The Essential&quot; contained the remastered and long since unavailable LP and Whitley&#x27;s debut, the 6-Track &quot;A Hard Act to Follow&quot;, and a scrapped song from 1986&#x27;s &quot;LA to Miami&quot;, &quot;I Wonder Where You Are Tonight&quot;.

==Legacy==
Several film projects depicting Whitley&#x27;s life were slated, but none have come to fruition. One idea was a film version of the George Vescey-Lorrie Morgan-penned &quot;Forever Yours, Faithfully&quot;. While Morgan&#x27;s book was a benchmark in piecing together Whitley&#x27;s final moments, perhaps the most research went into a project titled &quot;Kentucky Bluebird&quot;, which was to star writer/actor/director David Keith. 

Despite his brief moment in the spotlight, Whitley&#x27;s legacy remains. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2022; prior to that, he was the subject of an exhibit detailing his life and legacy. Whitley retains a persistent influence on country artists, including Tim McGraw, Ronnie Dunn, and Dierks Bentley. He is also the progenitor of newer artists like Morgan Wallen; a song named after Whitley features on Wallen&#x27;s 2023 double album, &quot;One Thing at a Time&quot;, which won the approval of Whitley&#x27;s widow and son.

Whitley is the only person to be posthumously recognized as a former member of the Grand Ole Opry, without ever being an active member. Management had scheduled Whitley for an appearance in late May 1989, where he was to be invited to join, but his death on May 9 interrupted those plans. As the Opry has a policy only inducting living artists as members, Whitley&#x27;s induction was scrapped. During a Keith Whitley tribute show at the Opry on October 14, 2023, Garth Brooks and Lorrie Morgan announced that Whitley&#x27;s name would be engraved on a plaque and included in the Opry&#x27;s Member Gallery backstage, alongside every act who has held Opry membership at some point in the show&#x27;s history, dating to 1925.

<doc id="431129" wikidata="Q1889215" url="?curid=431129" title="Phalloplasty">
<text>Phalloplasty (also called penoplasty) is the construction or reconstruction of a penis or the artificial modification of the penis by surgery. The term is also occasionally used to refer to penis enlargement.

==History==
Russian surgeon Nikolaj Bogoraz performed the first reconstruction of a total penis using rib cartilage in a reconstructed phallus made from a tubed abdominal flap in 1936.
The first gender-affirming surgery for a trans man was performed in 1946 by Sir Harold Gillies on fellow physician Michael Dillon, documented in Pagan Kennedy&#x27;s book &quot;The First Man-Made Man&quot;. Gillies&#x27; technique remained the standard one for decades. Later improvements in microsurgery made more techniques available.

==Indications==
A complete construction or reconstruction of a penis can be performed on patients who:
* Have congenital anomalies such as micropenis, epispadias, and hypospadias
* Have lost their penis
* Desire gender-affirming surgery as part of their gender transition.

==Techniques and related procedures==

There are different techniques for phalloplasty. Construction of a new penis (sometimes called a neophallus or neopenis) typically involves taking a tissue flap from a donor site (such as the forearm). Extending the urethra through the length of the neophallus is another goal of phalloplasty.

Temporary lengthening can also be gained by a procedure that releases the suspensory ligament where it is attached to the pubic bone, thereby allowing the penis to be advanced toward the outside of the body. The procedure is performed through a discreet horizontal incision located in the pubic region where the pubic hair will help conceal the incision site. However, scar formation can cause the penis to retract. Therefore, the American Urological Association &quot;considers the division of the suspensory ligament of the penis for increasing penile length in adults to be a procedure which has not been shown to be safe or efficacious.&quot;

== Penile implants ==
Phalloplasty requires an implanted penile prosthesis to achieve an erection. Penile prostheses are implanted devices intended to restore the erectile rigidity in cisgender men and to build a neophallus (new penis) in transgender men. Penile implants have been used in phalloplasty surgeries both in cisgender and transgender patients since 1970s.

There are two main types of penile implants – malleable (also known as non-inflatable or semi-rigid) and inflatable implants. Both types have a pair of cylinders implanted into the penis, replacing the non-erectile tissue in cisgender men and serving as the core for the neophallus in the phalloplasty procedure. The cylinder of the inflatable implant is filled with sterile saline solution. Pumping saline into the chambers of this cylinder produces an erection. The glans of the penis, however, remains unaffected.

In sex reassignment surgeries, a new penis is formed with the use of a penile implant surrounded with a tissue flap.

The pump unit of inflatable penile implants resembles a human testicle and can serve as an artificial testicle for concomitant scrotoplasty. 

Initially, standard penile implants were used in phalloplasty procedures. However, since there is no corpus cavernosum in the penis undergoing phalloplasty, and the fact that standard penile implants were designed to be implanted in corpus cavernosum, there were many adverse outcomes. Since 2015, Zephyr Surgical Implants proposes malleable and inflatable penile implants particularly designed for phalloplasty surgeries. Implantation procedures are usually done in a separate surgery to allow time for proper healing.

==Explanation of techniques==
===Flap from the arm===
 Sensation is retained through the clitoral tissue at the base of the neophallus. Nerves from the flap and the tissue it has been attached to may eventually connect. 

===Flap from the side of the chest===
The disadvantages include:
* Uses a motor nerve so erogenous sensation cannot be achieved, only tactile sensation.
* It can pull the nipple to the side causing it to be off the usual location.
===Flap from the leg===

=== Pubic area flap ===
=== Latissimus dorsi phalloplasty ===
This phalloplasty method is from latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap.

===Gillies technique===
===Abdominal muscle===
===Subcutaneous soft silicone implant===
This phalloplasty procedure involves the insertion of a subcutaneous soft silicone implant under the penile skin.

===No-touch surgical technique===
The no-touch surgical technique for penile prosthesis implantation is a surgical procedure developed by J. Francois Eid for the implantation of a penile implant. Implantation through the use of the &quot;No-Touch&quot; technique minimizes the risk of infection.

As advancements in the design and manufacturing process of the IPP improved its mechanical survival, infection has emerged as the leading cause of implant failure. Although relatively infrequent (varying from .06% to 8.9%) infection of a penile prosthesis results in serious medical consequences for patients, requiring complete removal of the device and permanent loss of penile size and anatomy. Bacterial contamination of the device can occur during the surgery, and is caused by allowing direct or indirect contact of the prosthesis with the patient&#x27;s skin. Over 70% of infections occur due to the skin microbiome&#x27;s microorganisms including &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus&quot; and &quot;Candida albicans&quot;.

Traditional strategies to combat infections aim at decreasing skin colony count such as scrubbing skin preparation with alcohol and chlorhexidine or kill bacteria once the implant is contaminated by skin flora such as intravenous antibiotics, antibiotic irrigation and antibiotic-coated implants. The &quot;No-Touch&quot; technique is unique in that it aims to prevent bacterial contamination of the prosthesis by completely eliminating contact of the device with the skin.

Paired with the antibiotic-coated implant, the &quot;No Touch&quot; technique decreases infection to a rate of 0.46%, opposing the traditional method which has an infection rate of 5%. The use of an antibiotic-coated implant and a no-touch surgical technique with skin preparation measures and peri-operative antibiotic use has been found to be of high importance in the prevention of infection among penile implants. Eid developed the technique in 2006 on the hypothesis that eliminating any contact between the prosthesis and the skin, either directly or indirectly via surgical instruments or gloves, should reduce the incidence of contamination of the device with skin flora responsible for infection.

====Procedure====

Three days prior to the procedure, a patient is placed on oral fluoroquinolones, a grouping of antibacterial drugs. During this time, the patient scrubs the lower abdomen and genitals daily with chlorhexidine soap. On the day of the surgery, vancomycin and gentamicin are administered intravenously one to two hours prior to the procedure. The lower abdomen and genitals are shaved, scrubbed for five minutes with a chlorhexidine sponge and prepped with chorhexidine/alcohol applicator. The area is then draped with a surgical drape and a Vi Drape over the genitalia. Before the incision is made, a Foley catheter is inserted in the bladder through the urethra.

A scrotal incision is made on the penoscrotal raphe and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue to the Buck&#x27;s fascia. A Scott retractor, a flexible device that holds open the skin of the surgical site, is applied to the area.

Up until this stage of the surgery, the process has been consistent with the sanitary practices associated with standard surgical sterility. At this stage of the &quot;No-Touch&quot; technique, after the incision has been made, all instruments, including surgical gloves, that have touched skin are discarded. A loose drape is then deployed over the entire surgical field and secured at the periphery with adhesive strips. A small opening in the drape is then made overlying the incision and yellow hooks utilized to secure the edges of the opening to the edges of the incision, completely covering and isolating the patient&#x27;s skin. At this point, new instruments and equipment are replaced and the entire prosthesis is inserted through the small opening of the loose drape. The loose drape allows for manipulation of the penis and scrotum required for this procedure without touching the skin.

Implantation of the device continues with an incision and dilation of corpora, sizing and placing the penile cylinders, and placement of the pump in the scrotum and the reservoir in the retropubic space. Saline is used throughout the implantation for irrigation. Once the corporotomies are closed and all of the tubing and components of the prosthesis covered with a layer of Buck&#x27;s fascia, subcutaneous tissues are closed and the &quot;No-Touch&quot; drape is removed and the skin closed.

===Future===
Penis transplantation could also become a standardized method.

<doc id="431130" wikidata="Q866103" url="?curid=431130" title="Royal Air Maroc">
<text>Royal Air Maroc (RAM, ; ; ) is the Moroccan national carrier, as well as the country largest airline, ranking among the largest in Africa.

RAM is wholly owned by the Moroccan Government, and has its headquarters on the grounds of Casablanca-Anfa Airport. It joined the Oneworld alliance in 2020.

From its base at Mohammed V International Airport, the carrier operates a domestic network in Morocco, scheduled international flights to Africa, Asia, Europe, and North and South America, and occasional charter flights that include Hajj services. As of November 2023, the airline serves 45 countries and 134 routes.

== History ==

=== Formation ===

&quot;Royal Air MarocCompagnie Nationale de Transports Aériens&quot; was formed in July 1953 as a result of the merger of &quot;Compagnie Chérifienne de&#x27;l Air (Air Atlas)&quot; — set up in 1946 with Junkers Ju 52s — and &quot;Compagnie Chérifienne de Transports Aériens Air Maroc&quot;, that was founded in 1947 and commenced scheduled operations in 1949.

The fleet of the newly formed airline included six Bretagnes, four Commandos, five DC-3s and two Languedocs. These aircraft worked on routes previously served by the predecessor companies, and added the cities of Frankfurt, Geneva and Paris.

=== Early years ===
The name &quot;Royal Air Maroc (RAM)&quot; was adopted on 28 June 1957, with the government of Morocco having a 67.73% stake. Hajj flights commenced in 1957.

The carrier&#x27;s fleet comprised 16 aircraft by April 1958, including four DC-4s, three DC-3s, seven Bretagnes and two C-46s. In May 1958, the airline ordered two Caravelles. In July, a number of long-haul routes were launched using four Lockheed L-749 Constellations leased from Air France, and the coastal Oran–Oujda run — which had been suspended in May — was reopened. Also in 1958, the carrier started flying to Gibraltar. The arrival of the Constellations enabled the airline to withdraw the DC-4s from service.

A single Caravelle was part of the fleet of four L-749 Constellations, four DC-4s and three DC-3s by April 1960, making the Caravelle the first jet aircraft operated by the company; another Caravelle was yet to be delivered. The type began serving the Rabat–Bamako route in July 1961. By 1964, there were three Caravelles in the fleet. A fourth was ordered in late 1964.

In April 1965, the company had 758 employees and chairmanship was held by Mohammed Al Fassi. The route network included services within North Africa, and also linked North Africa with France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland; the Casablanca–Dakar and Casablanca–Las Palmas sectors were also flown. Shareholding at the time was split between the government of Morocco (64%), Air France (21%), Compagnie Generale Transatlantique (7.6%), Aviacion y Comercio (5%) and others (2.4%). An order for a fifth Caravelle was placed in early 1968. By 1969, all routes to Europe and North Africa were flown using solely these aircraft.

=== 1970s ===
In 1969, the carrier placed its first order with Boeing. Royal Air Maroc took delivery of the first Boeing aircraft, a Boeing 727-200, in 1970, with the carrier deploying it on revenue service on 15 May.

Subsidiary airline &quot;Royal Air Inter&quot; was formed early in 1970 to undertake domestic routes using Fokker F-27 Friendship equipment; this sister company started operations on 2 April 1970, and by May 1971, it was serving Agadir, Al Hoceima, Casablanca, Fez, Marrakesh, Oujda, Rabat, Tangier and Tetouan. The RAM&#x27;s fleet at May 1971 comprised two Boeing 727-200s, along with four Caravelles and two SIAI Marchetti SF.260s. At a cost of  million, a third Boeing 727-200 was ordered in 1972. In 1974, the carrier ordered a single Boeing 727-200 Advanced, followed by an order for a fourth Boeing 727-200. Also that year, negotiations with Air France for the lease of a Boeing 707-320B started. By March 1975, the Boeing 707 was part of an 11-strong fleet, along with four Boeing 727-200s, four Caravelles, and two SIAI Marchetti SF.260s. RAM flew the leased Boeing 707 to New York for the first time in April 1975, becoming the first Arab airline in serving this destination. During the year, the company acquired three Boeing 737-200s to replace the Caravelles. Also in 1975, a weekly non-stop service to Rio de Janeiro was started. An order for three more Boeing 727-200s was placed in early 1976. That year, the four Caravelles were withdrawn from service and sold. A Boeing 747-200B entered the fleet in September 1978.

=== 1980s ===
By July 1980, Royal Air Maroc had 3,583 employees. At this time, the carrier fleet consisted of a single Boeing 747-200B, two Boeing 707-320Cs, one Boeing 707-320, seven Boeing 727-200s and three Boeing 737-200s. Another Boeing 727-200, ordered in January that year, was still pending delivery. At a cost of , an additional Boeing 737-200 was ordered in 1981, with the US Export-Import Bank arranging a  million loan to secure the delivery, and RAM and private financers funding the balance. Delivery was slated for March 1982. During 1982, two Boeing 737-200Cs were ordered for  million; deliveries were arranged for March and June 1983. Late that year, the airline joined the International Air Transport Association.

In July 1986, RAM was the first African airline to put the Boeing 757 in service. The first of these aircraft that was delivered to the company set a record for the type when it flew the distance separating Seattle from Casablanca, , non-stop.

=== 1990s ===
In the early days of the decade, the last of the Boeing 707s was removed from the fleet. Meanwhile, newer, more efficient, Classic 400 and 500 Series Boeing 737s were introduced to increase the frequency of European routes. By the middle of the decade all 727s had disappeared. To consolidate its North American operations, Royal Air Maroc purchased a single Boeing 747-400. As the decade progressed, new routes to previously under-served African airports were opened.

=== 2000-present ===
With the increasing number of passengers and newly opened routes as well as increasing oil prices, there was a need to buy new aircraft. In 2000 an order for 20 Next-Generation Boeing 737 aircraft and 4 Airbus A321s was placed. Meanwhile, more routes to the west and central African cities were opened.
RAM was now changing, from providing flights to meet the demands of foreign tourists and Moroccan expatriates, to providing connections between European cities and African cities via the Casablanca hub. In 2002, the company leased two 767s to replace the single 747 in North American routes.

Morocco and the EU signed an open skies agreement in late 2006. This means that Royal Air Maroc will have to face tough competition from low-cost carriers eager to exploit profitable routes between Western Europe and Morocco. A further challenge arises from the high cost of kerosene and the fact that the company may have to drop some of its unprofitable domestic and international routes.

Royal Air Maroc became Oneworld&#x27;s 14th member on 1 April 2020.

In June 2023, the airline announced a substantial expansion plan with the goal of doubling the size of its fleet over the next decade and adding international connections with new routes to Europe. This plan was revealed by the RAM&#x27;s chief executive officer (CEO), Abdelhamid Addou. In October, the airline announced plans to purchase 200 planes within a decade through a tender, aiming to meet the demand driven by the 2030 FIFA World Cup and strengthen its presence in the growing African market.

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership and subsidiaries===
, the airline is owned by the Moroccan government; 53.94% of shares are owned directly by the state, an additional 44.10% are held via the Hassan II Fund for Economic and Social Development. The remaining 2% are owned by private investors including Air France and Iberia.

The government has considered the privatisation of the company for about 20 years; the latest plan, dating from late 2012, reportedly included selling up to 44% of the stakes to a Gulf airline.

, &quot;The Group Royal Air Maroc&quot; had the following subsidiaries:

* Royal Air Maroc
* RAM Cargo
* Royal Air Maroc Express
* Atlas Aérotechnic Industries
* RAM Academy
Former RAM subsidiaries include:

*&quot;Air Sénégal International&quot;, created in 2000, had its maiden flight in 2001; the government of Senegal was the stockholder of 49% of the company and RAM held the balance at the time it ceased operations in April 2009.
*&quot;Amadeus Morocco&quot;
*&quot;Atlas Blue&quot;: RAM&#x27;s fully owned low-cost subsidiary. It was created on 28 May 2004, and started operations in July the same year. Based in Marrakech, it initially operated a single Boeing 737-400 that was transferred from its parent company and deployed on charter routes to France. Operations were integrated into RAM in 2009, while the fleets of both carriers officially merged on 10 February 2011.
* &quot;Atlas Catering Airlines Services&quot;
* &quot;Atlas Hospitality Morocco&quot;, a chain of hotels

===Business trends===
The carrier achieved the best result in ten years for the fiscal year 2012; cost-cutting measures had included the reduction in the number of employees by 1,974 between June 2011 and October 2012 and a fleet renewal program, and the net loss for the same period was reduced to MAD43 million. Following restructuring, which included the removal of medium-haul aircraft, the staff-to-aircraft ratio decreased from 110:1 to 58:1, whereas the ratio of passengers transported per employee increased from 1,054:1 to 2,329:1. In 2019 Royal Air Maroc made a net profit of US$51.9 million.

===Recent developments===


, Royal Air Maroc (RAM) operated an all-Boeing fleet. RAM placed an order for nine Boeing 737 Next Generation in October 1996; the first of these aircraft the airline took possession of, in July 1998, was a Boeing 737-800, making the carrier the first scheduled one outside the United States to take delivery of this model. RAM received its first Boeing 737-700 in April 1999. In March 2001, RAM placed orders for 20 new Boeing 737 NGs plus two wide-bodied Boeing 767-300ERs in a deal worth about  billion. That same year, RAM became a new Airbus customer when it bought four Airbus A321s. In January 2002, the airline took delivery of its first Boeing 767-300ER.

After the carrier&#x27;s Board of Directors agreed to buy a number of Boeing 787s on 29 July 2005, a memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of these aircraft was signed with Boeing on 31 Jul the same year. The deal, worth  million and including five Dreamliners, was confirmed in early November that year, with initial delivery slated for October 2008. The purchase contract was signed in December 2005, and also included an aircraft of the type on option. Following an over- million-worth contract that was signed in February 2006, these aircraft will be powered with General Electric GEnx engines. Boeing delivered RAM first Dreamliner in December 2014.

RAM was the launch customer for the ATR 72-600, when it took delivery of two of these aircraft, on behalf of its regional subsidiary RAM Express, in August 2011. The carrier had placed an order for four aircraft of the type in March 2009, along with two ATR 42-600s.

In September 2018, RAM retired its sole Boeing 747-400. In December 2018, RAM took delivery of its first Boeing 737 MAX 8 and Boeing 787-9.

In August 2023, RAM signed a $300 million long-term lease contract with Air Lease Corporation for five Boeing 737 aircraft, including four new Boeing 737 MAX 8s and one Boeing 737-800 which are expected to be delivered in 2024.

===Future plans===
In June 2013, RAM&#x27;s CEO indicated that the airline was seeking new generation aircraft as a replacement for its ageing fleet, adding that the carrier will need some 20 to 30 new aircraft by 2020, and that the Boeing 787 was being considered for long-haul routes, whereas the Airbus A220, the Airbus A320neo, the Boeing 737 MAX, and Embraer E-Jet E2 families were all being considered for medium-haul flights. A contract for the lease of Four Embraer E-190s was signed in mid-2014; the carrier took delivery of the first of these aircraft in November the same year.

As of 2023, the airline Royal Air Maroc is preparing to launch a call for tenders for new single-aisle and wide-body aircraft, in order to respond to the increase in tourism and strengthen the role of Casablanca as a hub for Sub-Saharan Africa. The CEO of the Moroccan national airline Abdelhamid Addou declared on June 13, 2023, to the Bloomberg agency that RAM is “putting the final touches” to a call for tenders for the purchase of new long and medium-haul aircraft, and plans to raise debt to help finance these acquisitions.

<text>Commonwealth Day is the annual celebration of the Commonwealth of Nations, held on the second Monday in March. While the date holds some official status in select member states of the Commonwealth, observances of the date are not uniform across the Commonwealth, and the date is not celebrated as a public holiday in most Commonwealth countries.

The event traces its origins to Empire Day, an event initially conceived to celebrate the British Empire. It was originally observed on Queen Victoria&#x27;s birthdate, May 24th, or the last weekday before it. In the latter half of the 20th century, the celebration&#x27;s focus shifted towards emphasising the modern Commonwealth of Nations, with the event being renamed &quot;Commonwealth Day&quot; in 1958, and its date moved to the second Monday in March in 1977. 

Commonwealth Day is typically marked by a Commonwealth Day message made by the Head of the Commonwealth, as well as additional statements from the Commonwealth Secretary-General. Inter-denominational observances are also held in cities across the Commonwealth, including one led by the Head of the Commonwealth at Westminster Abbey in London and attended by the Commonwealth Secretary-General. 

Flag-raising ceremonies for the flag of the Commonwealth of Nations are also held in Commonwealth countries. The flags of Commonwealth member states are flown at select locations in the United Kingdom, while the Royal Union Flag is flown at federal installations in Canada.

==History==
The idea of observing one day each year as a public holiday throughout the British Empire was first suggested in 1894 and 1895 by Thomas Robinson, the honorary secretary for the Royal Colonial Institute based in Winnipeg . Taking up Robinson&#x27;s suggestion, the Royal Colonial Institute&#x27;s London council petitioned Queen Victoria in July 1894, arguing that while other nations had annual national celebrations, the British Empire lacked one. They proposed designating the Queen&#x27;s birthday for this purpose. In a reply the British prime minister, Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, stated that it was a matter not for the government but for the community and pointed out that government departments already observed the Queen&#x27;s birthday as a holiday. However, the idea quickly gained support from organizations such as the British Empire League in the 1890s. 

The idea to hold an &quot;Empire Day&quot; as a day that would &quot;remind children that they formed part of the British Empire&quot; also gained support among educations during the 1890s. Championed by Clementina Trenholme, Empire Day was first observed in Ontario schools in 1898 and scheduled for the last school day before May 24, Queen Victoria&#x27;s birthday. By the end of the 19th century, Empire Day was also celebrated in Cape Colony before the Second Boer War and thereafter throughout the Union of South Africa. Empire Day was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1904 by Reginald Brabazon, 12th Earl of Meath, &#x27;to nurture a sense of collective identity and imperial responsibility among young empire citizens&#x27;. 

After the death of Queen Victoria on 22 January 1901, her birthday, 24 May, was celebrated from 1902 as &quot;Empire Day&quot;, though not officially recognised as an annual event until 1916. In schools, morning lessons were devoted to &quot;exercises calculated to remind (the children) of their mighty heritage&quot;. The centrepiece of the day was an organised and ritualistic veneration of the Union flag. Schoolchildren were given the afternoon off, and further events were usually held in their local community. 

After the First World War, the jingoism was toned down in favour of sombre commemoration in the festival. In 1925, 90,000 people attended an Empire Day thanksgiving service held at Wembley Stadium as part of the British Empire Exhibition. However, Empire Day became more of a sombre commemoration in the aftermath of World War I, and politically partisan in the United Kingdom as the Labour Party passed a resolution in 1926 to prevent the further celebration of Empire Day.

===Change in name and date===
After World War II, the event fell into rapid decline. On 18 December 1958, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan announced in Parliament that the name of Empire Day would be changed to Commonwealth Day.

In 1973, the National Council in Canada of the Royal Commonwealth Society submitted a proposal to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau that Commonwealth Day should be observed simultaneously throughout the Commonwealth of Nations. The proposal was included in the Canadian items for inclusion in the agenda for the 1975 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. After the meeting, it was agreed that the Commonwealth Secretariat would select a date with no historical connotations so that the entire Commonwealth could use it as a date to celebrate Commonwealth Day. At a meeting in Canberra in May 1976, senior Commonwealth officials agreed on a new fixed date for Commonwealth Day, the second Monday in March. The second Monday of March was selected by Commonwealth leaders as it was a day when most schools would be in session, facilitating student participation in several Commonwealth-related activities, including mini-Commonwealth Games, simulated Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, and studies and celebrations on the geography, ecology, products or societies of other Commonwealth countries.

==Observance==

Commonwealth Day is held on the second Monday in March. However, there is not a uniform observance of the day worldwide.

On the day, the Head of the Commonwealth broadcasts a message throughout the entire Commonwealth of Nations. The broadcast is addressed to the people of the Commonwealth, and not to specific governments. Past Commonwealth Day messages by Queen Elizabeth II are themed after an issue of importance to the Commonwealth which she thinks people can have an impact on. In some member states of the Commonwealth, the message is sometimes augmented by an address from a member country&#x27;s president, prime minister, or another senior minister. The Commonwealth Secretary-General also issues a statement on the day, which is read on the radio or published in some Commonwealth countries.

Several cities throughout the Commonwealth host multi-cultural and inter-denominational services to mark the day. Flag-raising ceremonies for the flag of the Commonwealth of Nations are also held in several Commonwealth countries.

===United Kingdom===
On Commonwealth Day, flags of the member states of the Commonwealth of Nations are flown in Parliament Square and at Marlborough House. The flag of the United Kingdom is flown from UK public buildings on the second Monday in March to mark Commonwealth Day. Flag flying guidelines for the Scottish Government and its related agencies also advises the flying of the flags of the Commonwealth of Nations and Scotland on the date, only if the building has two or more flagpoles.

In London, an inter-denominational service is led by the Head of the Commonwealth at Westminster Abbey. During the service, representatives of Commonwealth countries offer the flags of member states for blessing. A reception hosted by the Commonwealth Secretary-General is held after the service. A wreath-laying ceremony to commemorate the sacrifice of Commonwealth soldiers at London&#x27;s Commonwealth Memorial Gates is attended by the Commonwealth Secretary-General, and is held before the service at Westminster Abbey. 

Several other events, such as the Commonwealth Africa Summit, also take place around the United Kingdom on Commonwealth Day.

====British Overseas Territories====
Commonwealth Day was formerly celebrated as a public holiday in several British Overseas Territories. The day was observed as a school holiday in British Hong Kong before the handover of the territory from the United Kingdom to China in 1997. The date was also formerly observed as a public holiday in Gibraltar. In 2021, the holiday was moved to February instead of March. In 2022, Commonwealth Day was no longer listed as a public holiday in Gibraltar, with the February public holiday replaced by the Winter Midterm Bank Holiday. Although the event is no longer a public holiday, the Government of Gibraltar continues to mark Commonwealth Day through various events.

=== Australia ===

Commonwealth Day is observed by Australian state governors and the governor-general. The Commonwealth Day Council of New South Wales holds an annual lunch in the presence of its patron, the governor, at Parliament House, Sydney.

===Bahamas===
In The Bahamas, Commonwealth Day school assemblies involving flag-raising ceremonies are held.

===Belize===

In Belize, Commonwealth Day was also known as Sovereign&#x27;s Day and was formerly celebrated as a public holiday in May. The holiday was originally celebrated in honour of Queen Victoria&#x27;s birthday, although it was later set aside to recognise and celebrate the importance of being part of the Commonwealth of Nations. In 2021, Sovereign&#x27;s Day was removed from the government&#x27;s official list of public and bank holidays.

===Canada===

In Canada, a federal government stipulation that the Royal Union Flag be flown alongside the flag of Canada at federal installations nationwide where at least two flag poles are present. The requirement to fly the Royal Union Flag on certain days, including Commonwealth Day, stems from a 1964 parliamentary resolution following the adoption of flag of Canada, which retained the Royal Union Flag as an official symbol of the country&#x27;s Commonwealth membership and allegiance to the Crown.

From 1898 to 1976, Empire Day/Commonwealth Day was observed on an ad hoc basis in conjunction with Victoria Day, a federal statutory holiday in May that also serves as the sovereign&#x27;s official birthday in Canada. Empire Day/Commonwealth Day was held on the weekday before Victoria Day and was not intended to be a general holiday in itself, but a day to provide schools and civic institutions the opportunity to implement activities and lessons on Canada and the British Empire. In 1977, Commonwealth Day was moved to the second Monday in March, in line with the rest of the Commonwealth of Nations.

===Tuvalu===
Commonwealth Day is observed as a public holiday in Tuvalu, as legislated in the country&#x27;s &quot;Public Holidays Act&quot;.

<text>Bradford City Association Football Club is an English professional football club in Bradford, West Yorkshire. The team competes in League Two, the fourth tier of the English football league system, and is managed by Graham Alexander.

The club was founded in 1903 and immediately elected into the Football League Second Division. Promotion to the top tier followed as they won the 1907–08 Second Division title and then they went on to win the 1911 FA Cup final, which remains the club&#x27;s only major honour. They were relegated in 1922 and again in 1927, before winning the Third Division North title in 1928–29. Another relegation in 1937 did allow the club to go on to win the Third Division North Cup in 1939, however a further relegation followed in 1962 to leave the club in the newly created Fourth Division. They secured promotions back into the third tier in 1969 and 1977, but were relegated in 1972 and 1978. They found success in the 1980s under the stewardship of first Roy McFarland and then Trevor Cherry, winning promotion in 1981–82 and following this up with the Third Division title in 1984–85, though they were relegated out of the Second Division in 1990.

Bradford were promoted back into the second tier via the play-offs in 1996, before securing another promotion in 1998–99 to reach the Premier League, marking a return to the top-flight after a 77-year absence. They entered Europe and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2000–01 but ended the campaign with relegation from the Premier League. A succession of financial crises followed as the club entered administration twice in two years and further relegations followed in 2004 and 2007 to leave the club back in the fourth tier. They found success under the management of Phil Parkinson by reaching the 2013 League Cup final and then going on to win that year&#x27;s League Two play-off final but were relegated from League One in 2019.

The club&#x27;s home ground is the 24,840-capacity Valley Parade, which was the site of the Bradford City stadium fire on 11 May 1985, which took the lives of 56 supporters. They are the only professional football club in England to wear claret and amber, and have worn these colours throughout their history. They have though been known by various nicknames, with the &quot;Bantams&quot; being the most commonly used nickname as it appears on the current club crest. Supporters hold West Yorkshire derby rivalries with Huddersfield Town and Leeds United, as well as a historic Bradford derby rivalry with the now non-league side Bradford (Park Avenue).

==History==

Bradford City were formed in 1903 as a result of a series of meetings called by James Whyte, a sub-editor of the &quot;Bradford Observer&quot;, with Football Association representatives and officials at Manningham F.C., a rugby league side. The Football League saw the invitation as a chance to promote association football in the rugby league-dominated county of the West Riding of Yorkshire. It duly elected the new club into the Second Division, in place of Doncaster Rovers. Four days later, at the 23rd annual meeting of Manningham FC, the committee decided to change codes from rugby league to association football. Bradford City Association Football Club were formed without having played a game, taking over Manningham&#x27;s colours of claret and amber, and their Valley Parade ground.

Robert Campbell was appointed the club&#x27;s first manager and with the help of the new committee, he assembled a playing squad at the cost of £917 10s 0d. City&#x27;s first game was a 2–0 defeat at Grimsby Town on 1 September 1903, six days before their first home game attracted 11,000 fans. The club finished 10th in their first season. Peter O&#x27;Rourke took over as manager in November 1905, and he led City to the Second Division title in 1907–08 and with it promotion to the First Division. Having narrowly avoided relegation in their first season in the top flight, City recorded their highest finish of 5th in 1910–11. The same season they won the FA Cup, when a goal from captain Jimmy Speirs won the final replay against Newcastle United. City&#x27;s defence of the cup, which included the first Bradford derby against Bradford Park Avenue, was stopped by Barnsley after a run of 12 consecutive clean sheets.
City remained in the top flight in the period up to the First World War and for three seasons afterwards, but were relegated in 1921–22 along with Manchester United. Back in the Second Division, attendances dropped and City struggled for form, with five consecutive finishes in the bottom half of the table. They suffered a second relegation to the Third Division (North) in 1926–27. Two seasons later, O&#x27;Rourke, who had initially retired in 1921 following the death of his son, returned and guided City to promotion with a record haul of 128 goals. O&#x27;Rourke left for a second time after one more season, and although City spent a total of eight seasons back in the Second Division, they rarely looked like earning promotion back to the top flight. Instead in 1936–37, the club were relegated back to the Third Division (North). City won their third piece of silverware two seasons later, when they lifted the Third Division North Challenge Cup, but they were unable to defend the trophy because competitive football was suspended for the Second World War.

After the war, City went through two managers in the first two seasons, and were consistently in the bottom half of the Third Division (North) table until 1955–56. After three successive top half finishes, City were placed in the new national Third Division in 1958–59. Bradford spent just three seasons in the Third Division, but during their relegation season in 1960–61, they upset First Division side Manchester United in the inaugural season of the League Cup. With 34 goals from David Layne, City nearly earned promotion the following season 1961–62, but did also suffer a record 9–1 defeat to Colchester United. Layne left for Sheffield Wednesday, and without him City finished second from bottom of the league and had to apply for re-election. Bradford City just failed to win promotion in 1963–64, winning more games than any other team in the division that season, twenty five, with Rodney Green top scoring with 29 league goals. There followed three difficult seasons during which time manager Grenville Hair died following a heart attack in training, City returned to the Third Division after getting promoted in 1968–69. City&#x27;s stay in the Third Division lasted just three years, when they finished bottom in 1971–72. Promotion via fourth spot was won again in 1976–77 but it was instantly followed by a relegation season.
City failed to win promotion for three successive seasons, until the board appointed former England centre back Roy McFarland as manager in May 1981. McFarland won promotion in his first season, but was poached by his former club Derby County just six months later. City won compensation from Derby and installed another England international Trevor Cherry as McFarland&#x27;s replacement. Cherry, with former teammate Terry Yorath as his assistant manager, failed to win for two months, but eventually the pair guided City to safety from relegation. During the summer, however, the club chairman Bob Martin had to call in the official receivers. The club was saved by former chairman Stafford Heginbotham and former board member Jack Tordoff, but to ensure the club could start the new season, prize asset, striker Bobby Campbell was sold to Derby. City struggled but so did Campbell, and when he returned, the club went on a record run of ten successive victories. Although they missed out on promotion, City won the league the following season 1984–85, to return to the second tier of the Football League. However, City&#x27;s triumph was overshadowed when the main stand at Valley Parade caught fire during the final game of the season, killing 56 people.

City played games away from Valley Parade for 19 months. But just ten days after the new £2.6 million ground was opened, Cherry was sacked. His replacement, Terry Dolan, steered City away from possible relegation, before he mounted a promotion challenge the following season. City went top of the table in September 1987, but fell away during Christmas and missed out on promotion on the final day of the season. Instead, they entered the play-offs but were defeated in the semi-finals by Middlesbrough. Two years later City were relegated back to the Third Division. For three seasons, City finished mid-table in the third tier, which was renamed Division Two following the formation of the Premier League in 1992.
In January 1994, Geoffrey Richmond came from Scarborough to take over as chairman, and promised to guide City to the Premier League within five years. He cleared the debts and after four months sacked manager Frank Stapleton to appoint his own manager, Lennie Lawrence. Lawrence left after little more than a year to join Luton Town but his successor, Chris Kamara, took City to the play-offs and their first game at Wembley Stadium. They defeated Notts County 2–0 in the final to earn promotion to Division One. City avoided relegation the following season by winning their last two league games, 1–0 against Charlton Athletic and then beating Queens Park Rangers 3–0 on the final day of the season, but Kamara was sacked in January 1998. Paul Jewell took over, initially on a temporary basis, before he was given a permanent contract. He bought the club&#x27;s first £1 million signings and guided the club to the Premier League — the first time they had been in the top flight for 77 years — with a second-place finish. The following season, Jewell continued to defy the critics, who labelled his team &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, by avoiding relegation again on the last day with a 1–0 victory over Liverpool, with a goal from David Wetherall.

However, Jewell left shortly afterwards. His assistant Chris Hutchings was promoted to the manager&#x27;s position, and despite a series of new expensive signings, he was sacked by November 2000, with City second from bottom of the league. Jim Jefferies took over but could not save the club from relegation. At the end of the first season back in Division One, City were placed in administration with debts of nearly £13 million. Two years later, the club suffered a second spell in administration and a second relegation. Two top-half finishes followed, but the club were relegated for a third time in seven seasons in 2006–07 meaning the following season would be their first in the bottom tier for 26 seasons. Former player Stuart McCall was appointed the new manager, and although he said anything less than promotion would be a failure, he finally led the team to a 10th-place finish. McCall eventually left Bradford City on 8 February 2010 following a board meeting after a run of poor results.

In September 2011, the club became linked with American amateur side SC United Bantams.

In January 2013, City became the first club from the fourth tier of English football since Rochdale in 1962 to reach the League Cup final, and the first fourth tier club ever to reach a major Wembley Cup final. They defeated three Premier League sides en route to the final – Wigan Athletic 4–2 on penalties in the fourth round, Arsenal 3–2 on penalties in the quarter-finals and Aston Villa 4–3 on aggregate over the two legs of the semi-final. They met Premier League side Swansea City in the final at Wembley but lost 5–0.
The run to the final is thought to have been worth at least £1.3 million to the club, with joint chairman Mark Lawn stating that the final itself could be worth an additional £1 million, taking the club&#x27;s total earnings to £2.3 million during their cup campaign. On 18 May 2013, the club returned to Wembley where they defeated Northampton Town 3–0 in the League Two play-off final to secure a place in League One for 2013–14.

On 24 January 2015, Bradford City caused an upset by beating Premiership leaders Chelsea 4–2 away in the FA Cup. The victory sent Bradford through to the fifth round for the first time in eighteen years. They beat Sunderland, another Premier League club, 2–0 at home in the next round on 15 February 2015. In the quarter-finals, the Bantams faced Reading at home, in a game that ended in a goalless draw. The replay was played on 16 March 2015 at the Madejski Stadium, where Reading won 3–0.

The club was relegated to League Two at the end of the 2018–19 season.

In December 2021, the club was approached by American investors known as WAGMI United (who use cryptocurrency and NFTs) about a possible buyout. The offer was rejected.

On 24 February 2022, Mark Hughes was appointed manager of the club on a contract until the summer of 2024. He was sacked on 4 October 2023, with player Kevin McDonald becoming player-caretaker manager. Later that month, assistant manager Mark Trueman replaced McDonald as caretaker manager.

==Colours and club crest==
Bradford City is the only professional football club in England to wear claret and amber. The club colours were inherited from Manningham FC, when the club converted to football upon Bradford City&#x27;s foundation in 1903. However, whereas Manningham played in hoops, the new football club adopted claret and amber stripes. Manningham RFC adopted the colours in 1884 before the move to Valley Parade in 1886. Having originally worn black shirts with white shorts, the club&#x27;s first game in claret and amber was against Hull on 20 September 1884, at Carlisle Road.

The reason Manningham chose claret and amber is not documented but the colours were the same as those of The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own West Yorkshire Regiment, which was based at Belle Vue Barracks on nearby Manningham Lane. Both Manningham, from 1886, and Bradford City, from 1903 to 1908, used the barracks as changing and club rooms.

Bradford City has worn claret and amber, with either white or black, since it was founded. Since the fire in 1985, the club has used black on the kit as a memorial to the 56 supporters who died. The club&#x27;s away shirt has traditionally been white and to a lesser extent also blue, but there has been a profusion of other colours and designs particularly in more recent years. The away kit for the 2008–09 season was all white. For the 2009–10 season, the away kit was all black with a thin claret and amber stripe down the centre-left.

City scarves have also sold in large numbers in recent years to fans of &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, because the colours are the same as Harry&#x27;s house scarf at Hogwarts School.

A number of other clubs across the world wear claret and amber. They include Scottish club Motherwell, who originally wore blue and white until they wore claret and amber for the first time on 23 August 1913, against Celtic. It is erroneously believed that Motherwell chose the claret and amber colours because they were the racing colours of Lord Hamilton; it is more likely that Motherwell were influenced by Bradford City&#x27;s English FA cup win in 1911.

The club&#x27;s crest combines a series of logos from over the years. In 1974, City adopted a contemporary style crest incorporating the club&#x27;s initials, with a B-C logo. At the time, the new logo maintained the previous nickname of the Paraders. By December 1981, the club relaunched the Bantams as the official identity with a bantam on the new crest. The crest maintains the club colours and also includes the words The Bantams.

==Nickname==
Bradford City have had a number of nicknames during their history. In their early years, they were referred to as the &quot;Robins&quot; or &quot;Wasps&quot;, taking over the nickname of Manningham FC, as a result of Manningham&#x27;s claret and amber hoops. Other nicknames have been the &quot;Citizens&quot; or &quot;Paraders&quot;, but the club is better known as the &quot;Bantams&quot;.

The &quot;Bantams&quot; nickname is thought to have become popular during the First World War, when the club&#x27;s stadium Valley Parade was used as a recruiting station for the West Yorkshire Regiment which was raising Pals Battalions, with some of them called &quot;Bantams Battalions&quot; due to the short height of many of the recruits being, between 5ft (1.5m) tall and no more than 5ft 3in (1.6m).

==Stadium==

Valley Parade was the site of a quarry on the hillside below Manningham, Bradford, owned by Midland Railway Company, in 1886, when Manningham RFC bought one-third of the land and leased the remainder, because they had been forced to find a new home. They spent £1,400 erecting a ground with a capacity of 20,000, club facilities and levelling the land. When Bradford City were formed in 1903, they took over the ground at Valley Parade, which was also at this time the headquarters of The 2nd West Riding Brigade Royal Field Artillery (Territorial Force), playing their first home game on 5 September 1903 against Gainsborough Trinity, drawing a crowd of 11,000. Five years later, the club won promotion to the First Division, and so commissioned football architect Archibald Leitch to redevelop the ground. The capacity was increased to 40,000 by December 1908 with a 5,300-seater main stand, a terraced paddock in front, a Spion Kop, and an 8,000-capacity Midland Road stand. Its first game against Bristol City on Christmas Day attracted a crowd of 36,000. On 11 March 1911, Valley Parade attracted its highest attendance 39,146, for an FA Cup game between Bradford City and Burnley during Bradford&#x27;s FA Cup winning run.

Until 1952, by which time Bradford City had bought the remaining two-thirds of the ground to own it outright, the ground remained virtually unchanged. However, twice during the next decade, the club&#x27;s Midland Road stand had to be demolished. Club officials first closed part of the stand in 1952, as a result of the Burnden Park disaster six years earlier. Its frame was sold to Berwick Rangers and a replacement stand built in 1954. Six years later, the new stand was itself demolished, and Valley Parade remained a three-sided ground until 1966, when the pitch was moved, and a new stand built.
On 11 May 1985, Valley Parade was the scene of a fatal fire, during which 56 supporters were killed and at least 265 were injured. The game was the final match of the 1984–85 season, before which City were presented with the Third Division championship trophy. The fire destroyed the wooden main stand in just nine minutes. The club played its home games at Odsal Stadium, a rugby league ground in Bradford, Elland Road, Leeds, and Leeds Road, the former home of Huddersfield Town, until December 1986, while Valley Parade was redeveloped. The club spent £2.6 million building a new main stand and improving the Kop and reopened the new ground on 14 December 1986 for an exhibition match against an England international XI.

In 1991, the Bradford end of the ground was the next to be redeveloped and was converted into a two-tier stand with a scoreboard. In 1996, following City&#x27;s promotion to Division One, club chairman Geoffrey Richmond announced the construction of a 4,500 seater stand on the Midland Road side. Ahead of promotion to the Premiership in 1999, Richmond spent another £6.5 million to convert the Kop into a two-tier 7,500-seat capacity stand. A corner stand between the Kop and main stand was opened in December 2000, taking the capacity to 20,000 for the first time since 1970. The following summer, the main stand was also converted into a two-tier stand, taking the capacity to 24,840. Further projects were planned until the club went into administration in May 2002 so none have taken place. The following year, Valley Parade was sold to Gibb&#x27;s pension fund for £5 million, with the club&#x27;s offices, the shop and car park sold to London-based Development Securities for £2.5 million, but these (club offices, shop and car park) were bought back by the club&#x27;s joint chairmen in the summer of 2011. The club&#x27;s annual rent and maintenance costs to Gibb&#x27;s pension fund is £1.2m, and so as of February 2009, the club is considering a return to Odsal. The club and Bradford Bulls would share the new £50m complex, which would also feature cricket, cycling and athletics facilities. Valley Parade has had several other names under sponsorship naming deals. In July 2016 it became the Northern Commercials Stadium, and in July 2019 it became the Utilita Energy Stadium. This partnership came to an end in July 2022. The University of Bradford subsequently became title sponsor of Valley Parade.

==Supporters==
The club spearheaded an initiative in 2007 to slash the price of watching professional football for the 2007–08 season. As a result, season tickets to watch Bradford City were the cheapest in England at £138, the equivalent of £6 per match. When the offer finished, the club confirmed the amount of season tickets sold was 12,019. The scheme enabled the club to top the average league attendances for Football League Two during the 2007–08 season, attracting more than three times more than any other club. The club won the Perform Best Fan Marketing campaign category in The Football League Awards for the scheme and earned them an invitation to the Houses of Parliament. The club aimed to attract 20,000 fans for the 2008–09 by offering a free season ticket to anyone buying a season ticket as long as 9,000 adults sign up, but they fell 704 short of the target. Joint-chairman Mark Lawn announced in November 2008 that season tickets in the Bradford End for the 2009–10 season would be available for just £99 and £138 for the rest of the ground if bought in December 2008.

For the 2015–16 season, the club announced its latest season ticket scheme aimed at continuing to make football affordable for fans. Season ticket prices were set at £149 for adults, senior citizens and students, while admission for under-11s was free when purchased with an adult ticket. An initial campaign target of 15,000 was set. On 6 July, the club announced a record-breaking 18,000 tickets had been sold following a successful campaign. The campaign was repeated for the 2016–17 season, where the club sold in excess of 17,000 tickets.

Bradford City have one official mascot, Billy Bantam.

Bradford City announced &#x27;Own The Moment&#x27; 2022–23 season ticket sales of 14,190 in September 2022. The figure was a League Two record for the club. It surpassed the previous fourth-tier season-ticket sales record of 13,614 in 2019–20.

On 4 March 2023, Bradford City set a new attendance record for Football League Two at a 2–0 victory against Colchester United, with an attendance of 20,383, including 345 away fans. The Bantams then broke this record again in a home fixture on 8 May 2023 against Leyton Orient, with 22,576 supporters in attendance, including 1,902 Leyton Orient fans.

==Rivalry==

Bradford City have participated in the Bradford derby with city rivals Bradford Park Avenue. The West Yorkshire derby is held between City and local rivals Leeds United and Huddersfield Town. A &quot;friendly&quot; rivalry also existed with now-defunct club Halifax Town.

According to a survey conducted in August 2019, Bradford City fans also see Burnley, Barnsley and Oldham Athletic as rivals.

==European football==
Bradford City&#x27;s only participation in European football to date came in the 2000 UEFA Intertoto Cup.

<text>Spondylus is a genus of bivalve molluscs, the only genus in the family Spondylidae. They are known in English as spiny oysters or thorny oysters (although they are not, in fact, true oysters, but are related to scallops).

== Description ==

The many species of &quot;Spondylus&quot; vary considerably in appearance. They are grouped in the same superfamily as the scallops.

They are not closely related to true oysters (family Ostreidae); however, they do share some habits such as cementing themselves to rocks rather than attaching themselves by a byssus. The two halves of their shells are joined with a ball-and-socket type of hinge, rather than with a toothed hinge as is more common in other bivalves. They also still retain vestigial anterior and posterior &quot;auricles&quot; (&quot;ears&quot;, triangular shell flaps) along the hinge line, a characteristic feature of scallops, although not of oysters.

As is the case in all scallops, &quot;Spondylus&quot; spp. have multiple eyes around the edges of their mantle, and they have relatively well-developed nervous systems. Their nervous ganglia are concentrated in the visceral region, with recognisable optic lobes connected to the eyes.

== Evolutionary history ==
The genus &quot;Spondylus&quot; appeared in the Mesozoic era, and is known in the fossil records from the Triassic Cassian beds in Italy (235 to 232 million years ago) onward. Approximately 40 extinct species are known.
Fossils of these molluscs may be found in fossiliferous marine strata all over the world. For example, they are present in Cretaceaous rocks in the Fort Worth Formation of Texas, and in the Trent River Formation of Vancouver Island, as well as in other parts of North America.

== Distribution ==
Spiny oysters are found in all subtropical and (especially) tropical seas, usually close to the coasts.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Spondylus&quot; are filter feeders. The adults live cemented to hard substrates, a characteristic they share, by convergent evolution, with true oysters and jewel boxes. Like the latter, they are protected by spines and a layer of epibionts and, like the former, they can produce pearls. The type of substrate they use depends on the species: many only attach to coral, and the largest diversity of species is found in tropical coral reefs; others, (particularly S. spinosus) however, easily adapt to manufactured structures such as boats, pipes, and docks thereby becoming significant invasive species. Often other species are found attached to the shells of other species, perhaps the most common being found attached to the genus Malleus.

== Uses ==
Archaeological evidence indicates that people in Neolithic Europe were trading the shells of &quot;S. gaederopus&quot; to make bangles and other ornaments throughout much of the Neolithic period. The main period of Neolithic use appears to have been from around 5350 to 4200 BC. The shells were harvested from the Aegean Sea, but were transported far into the center of the continent. In the LBK and Lengyel cultures, &quot;Spondylus&quot; shells from the Aegean Sea were worked into bracelets and belt buckles. Over time styles changed with the middle Neolithic favouring generally larger barrel-shaped beads and the late Neolithic smaller favoring flatter and disk-shaped beads. Significant finds of jewelry made from &quot;Spondylus&quot; shells were made at the Varna Necropolis. During the late Neolithic the use of &quot;Spondylus&quot; in grave goods appears to have been limited to women and children.

&quot;S. crassisquama&quot; is found off the coast of Colombia and Ecuador and has been important to Andean peoples since pre-Columbian times, serving as both an offering to the fertility goddess Pachamama and as currency. In fact, much like in Europe, the trade in &quot;Spondylus&quot; shells also reached far and wide, as pre-Hispanic Ecuadorian peoples traded them with peoples as far north as present-day Mexico and as far south as the central Andes. The Moche people of ancient Peru regarded the sea and animals as sacred; they used &quot;Spondylus&quot; shells in their art and depicted &quot;Spondylus&quot; in effigy pots. Spondylus also were harvested from the Gulf of California and traded to tribes throughout Mexico and the American Southwest.

&quot;Spondylus&quot; shells were the driving factor of trade within the Central Andes and were used in a similar manner to gold nuggets, copper hatches, coca, salt, red pepper, and cotton cloth.

The use of &quot;Spondylus&quot; shells is what led to an economy of sorts in the Central Andes and led to the development of a merchant class, &quot;mercardes&quot;, in different cultures within the Central Andes. This caused the development of different styles of trade that went through evolutionary changes throughout pre-Columbian times. These are reciprocity (home based), reciprocity (boundary), down-the-line trade, central place redistribution, central place market exchange, emissary trading, and port of trade. These modes of trade dictate the way that the &quot;Spondylus&quot; shells are traded, as well as who is benefiting the most from the trades. Modes such as central place redistribution require the entity that is the central place to be the one that gains the most benefit from the trade, and modes such as emissary trading and port of trade are the modes that started the &quot;mercardes&quot; class within the Central Andes.

The value of &quot;Spondylus shells&quot; in the Central Andes stems from supply and demand. There was a great demand for &quot;Spondylus&quot; shells due to the &quot;fetishistic needs to the south&quot;.

Even today, there are collectors of &quot;Spondylus&quot; shells, and a commercial market exists for them. Additionally, some species (especially &quot;S. americanus&quot;) sometimes are found in the saltwater aquariums.

&quot;S. limbatus&quot; was commonly ground for mortar in Central America, giving raise to its junior synonym, &quot;S. calcifer&quot;.

&quot;Spondylus&quot; is fished primarily for its adductor muscle, or &quot;callus&quot;, which is a high-value foodstuff. Some Mediterranean species are edible and are commonly consumed, with &quot;S. gaederopus&quot; in particular being popular in Sardinia. Tropical species, however, tend to bioaccumulate saxitoxin.
The Romans ate Spondylus species. Macrobius in Saturnalia III.13 describes a dinner party in 63 BCE in which there were two courses of &quot;Spondylus&quot;.

=== Aztec culture ===
In addition to its significance in the pre-Columbian times, &quot;Spondylus crassiquama&quot; was also an important part of Aztec culture. &quot;Spondylus&quot; uses amongst Aztecs included: art, jewelry, statues, religious motifs, and at times, as currency. One example of &quot;Spondylus&quot; used in art is the double-headed serpent that may be seen amongst images on the right of the page. 

As stated above, &quot;Spondylus&quot; held immense religious value amongst Aztec culture pre-columbian times and is also a great representation of the relationship between the Aztec empire and nature. To Aztec groups and peoples’, &quot;Spondylus&quot; was a gift from the deities to be celebrated. Certain &quot;Spondylus&quot; groups were formed as a result of when and where they may be found seasonally and tend to connect a particular group of &quot;Spondylus&quot; to specific religious symbols such as the Fertility goddess, the Moon goddess, the Sun god, and the mountain spirits. This led to certain groups of &quot;Spondylus&quot; being associated with seasonal weather events such as heavy rains or increases in sea temperature along the coast, as those events were closely associated with particular deities or spirits in Aztec culture .
&quot;Spondylus&quot; had several key uses in pre-Columbian Aztec history, most predominantly its importance in jewelry, art, and sculpture. Another use of &quot;Spondylus&quot;, that had to be executed with extreme detail and precision, was to create breathtaking masks, vests, and other items individuals would use to express how important or wealthy they were in life and death. Having the most beautiful &quot;Spondylus&quot; pieces, meant that individual had immense power within the community.

== Species ==
Spondylidae taxonomy has undergone many revisions, mostly due to the fact that identification is traditionally based on the shell alone, and this is highly variable. To add to this, while some shallow-water species are extremely common, at least two deep-water species are known from a single specimen, while a third (S. gravis) was only identified in the late 1900s. At least another common species (S. regius) has a different shell when it grows in deep water.

<text>Charnwood Forest is a hilly tract in north-western Leicestershire, England, bounded by Leicester, Loughborough and Coalville. The area is undulating, rocky and picturesque, with barren areas. It also has some extensive tracts of woodland, and significant Precambrian geology. Its elevation is generally and upwards, the area exceeding this height being about . The highest point, Bardon Hill, is . On its western flank lies an abandoned coalfield, with Coalville and other former mining villages, now being regenerated and replanted as part of the National Forest. The M1 motorway, between junctions 22 and 23, cuts through Charnwood Forest.

The hard stone of Charnwood Forest has been quarried for centuries, and was a source of whetstones and quern-stones. The granite quarries at Bardon Hill, Buddon Hill and Whitwick supply crushed aggregate to a wide area of southern Britain.

The forest is an important recreational area with woodland walks, noted for their displays of bluebells in the early spring, rock climbing and hillwalking. Popular places with public access include Bardon Hill, Beacon Hill, Bradgate Park, Swithland Wood, the Outwoods and Stoneywell cottage (National Trust).

==Extent==
The area of hills and open land known as Charnwood Forest has no jurisdictional boundary (the Borough of Charnwood covers roughly two thirds of Charnwood Forest, and the eastern half of the borough is not part of the forest). Furthermore, despite its name, Charnwood was never a royal forest, and was never subject to forest law. So although it is an ancient and well-established locality, it has only recently been officially defined, by the Natural England National Character Area (NCA) process, which takes a somewhat wider definition than many previous attempts to define the area.

==Geology==
Many of the craggy rocks of Charnwood Forest are of volcanic origin and are very old, dating back through 600 million years to Precambrian times. It was the site of the first-ever recorded discovery of &quot;Charnia masoni&quot;, the earliest-known large, complex fossilised species on record, recovered from a quarry near the Charnwood village of Woodhouse Eaves. It was discovered separately in 1956 &amp; 1957 by local schoolchildren Tina Negus and Roger Mason, although it was Mason who received the credit (thus &quot;masoni&quot;). Since this find in Charnwood Forest, Precambrian fossils have been discovered across the world.

Along the western edge of Charnwood Forest the rocks are mainly Precambrian igneous diorites. These formed from molten lava deep within the sedimentary rocks, cooling slowly to produce hard, blocky rock with large crystals. This is extensively quarried for roadstone around Groby, Markfield and Whitwick, and is known as granite (formerly also called Markfieldite).

The central area of the forest has older rocks still. These are sedimentary and are very variable in character, They were formed by material from volcanoes, settling in deep water, and it is in these beds that the fossils are found. Uplifting, tilting and erosion have produced the distinctive jagged exposures found across the highest parts of Charnwood. On the eastern side, a much more recent series of rocks are found. Again igneous diorites, that formed deep underground, but these are Ordovician, from a mere 450 million years ago. These are extensively quarried in the areas near Mountsorrel.

==History==
The earliest form of the name Charnwood is probably derived from &quot;cerne woda&quot;, from the Celtic &quot;carn&quot;, meaning cairn, and the Old English &quot;wudu&quot;, meaning wood. Some sources give &quot;cwern&quot; as the derivation, meaning a tool used to grind grain and other materials by hand. The area was a source of stone for these tools, called quern-stones.

Archeological evidence has shown that the area was inhabited as far back as the Neolithic period, approximately 4,000–2,000 BC. Beacon Hill is the site of a Bronze Age hill fort, dating from between 600 BC and 43 AD. This forms one of the last surviving visible features in the landscape known to the Coritani, the tribe who occupied most of the East Midlands area at the time of the Roman Conquest.

According to Domesday Book, there was only one settlement in Charnwood Forest in 1086, at Charley whose name would appear to come from the same root, with the suffix &quot;-ley&quot; denoting open land, rather than forest.

In the 200 years after the Norman conquest, newly created settlements took major areas of land out of the forest for use in agriculture. Quorn was established between 1086 and 1153, and all the land up to Woodhouse had been deforested by 1228.

There were comparatively few major changes in land use in the post Medieval period, until the demand for timber and charcoal for the early Industrial Revolution contributed to a further loss of woodland. By the end of the 18th century, most of the woodland had disappeared leaving large areas of moorland and pasture.

In 1957, Charnwood Forest was considered for designation as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), but the designation was not made due to the construction of the M1 motorway through the area. 

==In literature==
The area was the inspiration for &quot;Charnwood Poems&quot;, a collection of poems by the author, playwright and poet Albert Francis Cross (1863–1940). It is also the setting for the speculative fiction novel &quot;Some Kind of Fairy Tale&quot; by Graham Joyce (2012), in which it is depicted as a possible portal to the realm of fairies.

==Wildlife and geological sites==

Charnwood Forest covers approx of Leicestershire, split over three local government districts: Charnwood Borough, North West Leicestershire District and Hinckley and Bosworth District. It includes a national nature reserve (NNR), 19 SSSIs (Some subdivided in the list of sites below), 4 Geological Conservation Review (GCR) sites of international geological importance plus a further 6 GCR sites, 13 regionally important geological sites (RIGS), five local nature reserves (LNRs), seven Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust (LRWT) nature reserves, and one Woodland Trust woodland. Seventeen sites have open access to the public. Footpaths and bridleways give views and limited access to the other sites listed, and to the rest of the Charnwood Forest landscape. Over half of Charnwood Forest is included within the English National Forest. It is also crossed by two waymarked long distance walking routes—the Leicestershire Round and the Ivanhoe Way. The 45 sites listed here include sites with statutory wildlife or geological designations, plus other sites included in published lists of notable sites. On both the map and table, green denotes a site open to the public, amber denotes a site with limited access or restricted by permit or membership. Red denotes a site with no public access except by special arrangement with the owners.

Plants found within the woods include &quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot;, &quot;Dactylorhiza fuchsii&quot;, &quot;Sorbus torminalis&quot; and &quot;Vaccinium myrtilus&quot;.
Abbreviations used in the table:

<text>is a Japanese video game developer, best known as the primary developer and co-owners of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series of role-playing video games.

==History==
Predating the video game company, &quot;Game Freak&quot; was a self-published video game magazine created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori in the 1980s. The first issue was published in 1983 by Tajiri. Sugimori would join the magazine at a later date as an illustrator after finding the magazine in a shop and liking it. Tajiri also used &quot;Game Freak&quot; as his pen name when he wrote as a freelance writer to publications such as &quot;Family Computer Magazine&quot; and &quot;Famicom Tsūshin&quot;.

On April 26, 1989, Tajiri, Sugimori and Junichi Masuda started a video game development company with the same name. One of Game Freak&#x27;s first games was the Nintendo Entertainment System action and puzzle game &quot;Quinty&quot;, which was released in North America as &quot;Mendel Palace&quot;. Its most popular series, &quot;Pokémon&quot;—the romanized portmanteau of the Japanese brand —is published and distributed respectively by The Pokémon Company and Nintendo worldwide.

In October 2015, Game Freak acquired Koa Games, a mobile development company. The company was subsequently merged into Game Freak on December 1, 2015.

In May 2019, Game Freak director Masayuki Onoue revealed that Game Freak is increasingly prioritizing original game creation, in order to grow the experience of its staff. The company&#x27;s Gear Project initiative, which encourages creators to pitch original game ideas during quiet periods, has so far resulted in original games &quot;HarmoKnight&quot;, &quot;Pocket Card Jockey&quot;, &quot;Tembo the Badass Elephant&quot; and &quot;Giga Wrecker&quot;.

In February 2020, Game Freak relocated their headquarters to Kanda Square, an office building in Nishikichō shared with Nintendo&#x27;s Tokyo branch.

In October 2024, nearly a terabyte of data from Game Freak&#x27;s servers was stolen. Development builds, source code, and test sprites either planned or released for past &quot;Pokémon&quot; games were found, as well as code names for upcoming &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, and prototypes of unreleased remakes of &quot;Quinty&quot; and &quot;Yoshi&quot;. Shortly afterwards, Game Freak addressed the incident, stating that the leak was due to &quot;unauthorized access to our servers by a third party&quot;, which had taken place in August 2024. They also stated that many employees&#x27; personal information had been leaked. Various non-canon &quot;Pokémon&quot; stories were also discovered.

<text>In economics, the economics of location is the study of strategies used by firms and retails in a monopolistically competitive environment in determining where to locate. Unlike a product differentiation strategy, where firms make their products different in order to attract customers, an &quot;economics of location&quot; strategy is consistent with firms producing similar or identical products.

The economics of location refers to the study of the factors that influence the location of economic activity and the spatial distribution of economic phenomena. This includes the study of how businesses and industries choose where to locate, how the location of economic activity affects the local economy and society, and how government policies and other factors can influence the location of economic activity.

One important factor that influences the location of economic activity is access to inputs such as labor, capital, and raw materials. Businesses and industries tend to locate in areas where these inputs are abundant and inexpensive, as this can help to reduce production costs and increase profits. For example, a manufacturing company may choose to locate near a large pool of skilled labor, or a resource-based industry such as mining or forestry may choose to locate near sources of raw materials.

Another important factor is access to markets. Businesses and industries tend to locate in areas where they can easily sell their products or services to consumers or other businesses. This may include locating near large population centers, or in areas with good transportation infrastructure.

<text>[[Sepsis|Septicemic]] plague is one of the three forms of plague, and is caused by &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;, a gram-negative species of bacterium. Septicemic plague is a systemic disease involving infection of the blood and is most commonly spread by bites from infected fleas. Septicemic plague can cause disseminated intravascular coagulation and is always fatal when untreated. The other varieties of the plague are bubonic plague and pneumonic plague.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The usual symptoms are:
* Abdominal pain
* Bleeding under the skin due to blood clotting problems
* Bleeding from mouth, nose or rectum
* Gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, which can be with blood, and diarrhea
* Fever
* Chills
* Low blood pressure
* Organ failure
* Shock
* Death of tissue (gangrene) in extremities, mostly fingers, nose, and toes
* Difficulty breathing
*Death 

These symptoms are common to many human illnesses and are not considered, in and of themselves, to signify infection with any form of plague.

It is important to note that septicemic plague may be asymptomatic and may cause death absent of any symptoms.

==Cause==
=== Transmission ===

Human &quot;Yersinia&quot; infections most commonly result from the bite of an infected flea or occasionally an infected mammal. 

Rats specifically were a mammal that played a huge part in the spread of the disease. When rats that carried the plague died of the disease, then the fleas that were using those rodents as a food source must quickly seek a different blood stream, making things very problematic for any human nearby. 

After a flea consumes the blood of an infected rat, they are unable to get blood to their stomachs as masses form due to the &quot;Yersinia&quot; bacteria that is now in the flea. These masses don&#x27;t allow for blood to be processed properly, leaving the flea feeling constant hunger, and this results in more bites on humans. The exposure to a flea bite from an infected flea may cause bubonic plague in humans that could develop into the septicemic plague. 

Cats and dogs were also susceptible to bites from infected fleas. These cats and dogs could then expose humans to the plague when the animal brings those infected fleas around people. 

However, like most bacterial systemic diseases, the disease may also be transmitted through an opening in the skin or by inhaling infectious droplets of moisture from sneezes or coughs. In both cases septicemic plague need not be the result, and in particular, not the initial result, but it occasionally happens that bubonic plague for example leads to infection of the blood, and septicemic plague results. If the bacteria happen to enter the bloodstream rather than the lymph or lungs, they multiply in the blood, causing bacteremia and severe sepsis. In septicemic plague, bacterial endotoxins cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), where tiny blood clots form throughout the body, commonly resulting in localised ischemic necrosis, tissue death from lack of circulation and perfusion.

DIC results in depletion of the body&#x27;s clotting resources, so that it can no longer control bleeding. Consequently, the unclotted blood bleeds into the skin and other organs, leading to a red or black patchy rash and to hematemesis (vomiting blood) or hemoptysis (coughing up blood). The rash may cause bumps on the skin that look somewhat like insect bites, usually red, sometimes white in the centre.

Septicemic plague is caused by horizontal and direct transmission. Horizontal transmission is the transmitting of a disease from one individual to another regardless of blood relation. Direct transmission occurs from close physical contact with individuals, through common air usage, or from direct bite from a flea or an infected rodent. Most common rodents may carry the bacteria and so may Leporidae such as rabbits.

The bacteria are cosmopolitan, mainly in rodents on all continents except Australia and Antarctica. The greatest frequency of human plague infections occurs in Africa. The bacteria most commonly appear in rural areas and wherever there is poor sanitation, overcrowding, and high rodent populations in urban areas. Outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, or hunting where plague-infected animals may be found, increase the risk of contracting septicemic plague, and so do certain occupations such as veterinary or other animal-related work.

==Diagnosis==

A doctor or veterinarian will perform a physical exam which includes asking about the medical history and possible sources of exposure. The following possible test could include:
* Blood samples (detecting antibodies)
* Culture samples of body fluids (check for the bacteria &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;)
* Kidney and liver testing
* Checking lymphatic system for signs of infection
* Examining body fluids for abnormal signs
* Checking for swelling
* Checking for signs of dehydration
* Checking for fever
* Checking for lung infection

== Prevention ==

The following steps and precautions should be used to avoid infection of the septicemic plague:
* Caregivers of infected patients should wear masks, gloves, goggles and gowns
* Take antibiotics if close contact with the infected patient has occurred
* Use insecticides throughout the house
* Avoid contact with dead rodents or sick cats
* Set traps if mice or rats are present around the house
* Do not allow family pets to roam in areas where plague is common
* Flea control and treatment for animals (especially rodents)

==Treatment==

Starting antibiotics early is the first step in treating septicemic plague in humans. One of the following antibiotics may be used:
* Streptomycin
* Gentamicin
* Tetracycline or Doxycycline
* Chloramphenicol
* Ciprofloxacin

Lymph nodes may require draining and the patient will need close monitoring.

In animals, antibiotics such as tetracycline or doxycycline can be used. Intravenous drip may be used to assist in dehydration scenarios. Flea treatment can also be used. In some cases, euthanasia may be the best option for treatment and to prevent further spreading.

== Prognosis ==
Untreated septicemic plague is almost always fatal. Early treatment with antibiotics reduces the mortality rate to between 4 and 15 per cent. Death is almost inevitable if treatment is delayed more than about 24 hours, and some people may even die on the same day they with the disease.

== Epidemiology ==

In 2015, Taylor Gaes, a 16-year-old in Larimer County in northern Colorado, contracted septicemic plague and subsequently died after being bitten by a flea that had bitten a rodent on his family&#x27;s rural property. Only three people in Colorado had contracted the bacteria in the previous thirty years.

== History ==

The septicemic plague was the least common of the three plague varieties that occurred during the Black Death from 1348 to 1350 (the other two being bubonic plague and pneumonic plague). Like the others, septicemic plague spread from East Asia through trade routes on the Black Sea and down to the Mediterranean Sea.

Major port cities and trade centres such as Venice and Florence were hit the hardest. The massive loss of the working population in Europe following the Black Death, resulting in the increased economic bargaining power of the serf labour force, was a major precipitating factor for the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381.

== Other animals ==

Septicemic plague is a zoonosis, a disease that generally is acquired by humans from animals, such as rodents and carnivores. Goats, sheep and camels also may carry the bacteria. Cats rarely develop clinical signs but can be infected and exhibit symptoms such as vomiting or diarrhea. Areas west of the Great Plains of North America are one region where plague-infected animals commonly occur. Plague-infested animals are found in many other countries as well, especially in developing countries where health controls are not effective.

Animals that commonly carry plague bacteria are large rodents and Leporidae, but carnivores sometimes also become infected by their prey. Prey animals are not immune to the disease, and outbreaks of various strains of plague, such as sylvatic plague, have on occasion devastated populations of black-tailed prairie dogs and black-footed ferrets.

Plague has been active in black-tailed prairie dog populations since the 1960s. In the United States outbreaks only occur in the western States and they are devastating, with mortality rates near 100% because the animals have no immunity to the plague. Survivors are the ones that happened not to become infected and colonies that recover from a plague outbreak remain at risk.

Because black-footed ferrets prey on black-tailed prairie dogs, wild ferret populations also fall victim to sylvatic plague. An outbreak can kill nearly 100% of ferrets in a population, and surviving ferrets commonly face starvation because prairie dogs are their main prey. Spray-and-vaccinate campaigns have aimed at preventing the spread of the plague among these animals.

Similar septicemic problems occur in many countries across the world, especially in developing countries where spending on health systems is very low and health controls are not effective.

<doc id="431187" wikidata="Q7315432" url="?curid=431187" title="Resident commissioner">
<text>Resident commissioner was or is an official title of several different types of commissioners, who were or are representatives of any level of government. Historically, they were appointed by the British Crown in overseas protectorates (such as Bechuanaland), or colonies (such as South Australia), and some still exist in this capacity. The United States of America once had a resident commissioner in the Philippines and the Puerto Rico resident commissioner resides in Washington DC. State governments of today&#x27;s Republic of India have a resident commissioner to represent them in New Delhi.

==British Empire and the Commonwealth of Nations==

Resident commissioners appointed by the British Crown typically reside in the territorial unit of which they are in charge. This also the case with most otherwise styled commissioners.

In certain complex colonial units within the British Empire, the high commissioner to whom was given the highest &quot;regional&quot; supervision (either residing in one of the constitutive territories, e.g. in the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT), first by the governor on Fiji, then from 1952 onward on the Solomon Islands; or even in a neighbouring colony, e.g. the Governor of the Straits Settlements as High Commissioner for the Federated Malay States) would commonly be represented in territories not comprising his residence by a resident commissioner, though in some places (including some of the Federated Malay States) similar officials were formally styled as residents, a more diplomatic title; otherwise another type of official was also possible (e.g. the British Consul in the protected state of Tonga, a Polynesian kingdom; an administrator on Nauru; a mere chief magistrate on tiny Pitcairn). In some cases his task was comparable to the lieutenant-governor of a minor colony, especially as the high commissioner could be a British colonial governor doubling as such.

===South Australia===

South Australia was the only Colony in Australia authorised by an Act of Parliament, the &quot;South Australia Act 1834&quot;, which set out the requirement for a Governor, representing the Crown, and a Resident Commissioner, reporting to Colonisation Commissioners. The survey and sale of land, as well as migration arrangements and funding, were responsibilities of the Resident Commissioner. The first Resident Commissioner to be appointed was James Hurtle Fisher on 14 July 1836, but when George Gawler was appointed Governor in 1838 to replace John Hindmarsh, he was given the role of Resident Commissioner as well, effective in October 1838.

===Western Pacific Territories===

The following territories had resident commissioners:
*The British Solomon Islands from 1893 until they got a governor (who also became the high commissioner) in 1952
* The Gilbert and Ellice Islands were administered as a British protectorate by a resident commissioner from 1892 to 1916 as part of the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT), and from 1916 to 1972 as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony; from 1972, the colony had an own governor until the independence of Tuvalu (1978) and Kiribati (1979);
* The Union Group protectorate from 1916 (later a separate state called Tokelau)
*The Cook Islands, since the 11 June 1901 incorporation into New Zealand (previously there was a British resident).
*Niue since 1901 (later under a high commissioner) soon annexed to the dominion of New Zealand (1901-1904 as part of the Cook Islands); see List of resident commissioners of Niue.
*A special case were the New Hebrides, for these were an Anglo-French colonial condominium, so he had a French colleague styled &quot;résident&quot;, subordinate to France&#x27;s &quot;haut commissaire&quot; (high commissioner) in the Pacific Ocean (from 22 March 1907 the Governor of New Caledonia); both were abolished at the independence of the Republic of Vanuatu in 1980.

===Southern Africa===

While the post of High Commissioner for Southern Africa (HCSA) was held 27 January 1847 - 31 May 1910 by the governors of the Cape Colony, then until 6 April 1931 by the governors-general of the Union of South Africa, after that date filled separately until 1963, there have been resident representatives in the constituent territories:

*In Bechuanaland Protectorate, after a few deputy and special commissioners, there were resident commissioners since it was made dependent on the HCSA on 9 May 1891; in 1892-1923 there were also two assistant commissioners, for the north and the south respectively.
*In the British Swaziland protectorate, since it was dependent on the HCSA in 1902 (before administered through Transvaal, under an administrator); afterward both got a separate commissioner.
*From 18 March 1884 Basutoland became a separate colony, as one of the High Commission Territories, it got its resident commissioner, instead of a Cape government agent (since it became a British protectorate in 1868).

==India==

In India, a resident commissioner is the representative of the state government with an office in New Delhi, who is also supposed to manage the reception of state government functionaries who visit New Delhi. He coordinates with various ministries of the central government, central PSUs, multi-lateral and bilateral agencies and various other organisations on behalf of the state government. They are from Indian Administrative Service.

==United States==
*The Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico does not reside there but represents the U.S. commonwealth in the continental United States, particularly in the capital of Washington, D.C.. The resident commissioner represents Puerto Rico in the United States House of Representatives, where they have a status equivalent to a territorial delegate, as well as before executive departments.
*In most other U.S. overseas (and historically pre-state) territories, a similar representative position is styled &quot;delegate&quot;.
*The Resident Commissioner of the Philippines held a similar position when the Philippines was a United States territory and then commonwealth. The position was originally created by the Philippine Organic Act of 1902 with the first commissioners serving from 1905. The position ended with Philippine Independence in 1946.

<text>Pokémon Stadium, known in Japan as Pokémon Stadium 2 (Japanese: ポケモンスタジアム２&quot;Pokemon Sutajiamu 2&quot;) is a 1999 strategy video game video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. The gameplay revolves around a 3D turn-based battling system using the 151 Pokémon from the Game Boy games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot;, with several in-game challenges for players to overcome. The game includes four &quot;Cups&quot;, each of which is a series of three-on-three Pokémon battles against an ordered lineup of opponents. The &quot;Gym Leader Castle&quot; mode involves battles against several boss opponents who appeared in the Game Boy games. &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; also features mini-games and numerous features available through its compatibility with &quot;Pokémon Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot;. Using the Transfer Pak accessory that was bundled with the game, players are able to view, organize, store, trade, and battle using Pokémon uploaded from &quot;Pokémon Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot;.

It was the first &quot;Stadium&quot; title released in Western regions, succeeding the Japan-only 1998 Nintendo 64 release &quot;Pocket Monsters Stadium. Pokémon Stadium&quot; was released in Japan in 1999, before being released in Australia, Europe and North America in 2000. &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; became one of the best-selling Nintendo 64 titles, selling one million copies before the end of the year. Critics praised the game&#x27;s visuals and the connectivity with the Game Boy games but criticized the games&#x27; audio quality and repetitive gameplay. A sequel, &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot;, released in 2000, supporting connectivity with the games &quot;Pokémon Gold, Silver&quot;, and &quot;Crystal&quot;. &quot;Stadium&quot; was re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on April 12, 2023.

==Gameplay==


Unlike the previous games in the series, &quot;Pokémon Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; does not have a storyline or a well-defined world or story. &quot;Stadium&quot; takes a more battle-focused approach with its gameplay, which functions similarly to &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow.&quot; Players select teams of six Pokémon to battle. These are either Pokémon collected from &quot;Pokemon Red, Blue, Yellow&quot; usable via the Nintendo 64 Transfer Pak, or Pokémon with pre-determined movesets included in &quot;Pokemon Stadium&quot;. Six Pokémon are chosen as the party. Only three of them can be chosen for individual battles. Pokémon are depicted in 3D and have unique animations in-battle. The game also features an announcer, who says voice lines in response to actions that occur in battle.

The game challenges the player to succeed in trainer battles at the Stadium, a tournament consisting of four in-game tournaments that last eighty battles in total, with each tournament having its own rules and restrictions. Another mode, the Gym Leader Castle, has the player battle the eight Kanto Gym Leaders, the Kanto Elite Four, and the Champion, who previously appeared in the Game Boy games. Defeating the mode allows players to obtain rare species of Pokémon. When all Cups have been won and the Gym Leader Castle is completed, a six-on-one battle against Mewtwo is unlocked. Defeating Mewtwo unlocks another round of Stadium, Gym Leader Castle, and the Mewtwo battle, but with higher difficulty.

===Other features===

&quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; features other game-modes. The Pokémon Lab feature allows players to connect with &quot;Pokémon&quot; Game Boy game cartridges via the Nintendo 64 Transfer Pak. A player&#x27;s stored Game Boy Pokémon can be organized and traded in the Lab, and players can view Pokedex information and models for particular species. Players can store Pokémon and items from the Game Boy games in &quot;Stadium&quot;, and allows players to transfer Pokémon stored on &quot;Pokémon Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot; Game Boy cartridges to &quot;Stadium,&quot; where they can be used in &quot;Stadium&#x27;s&quot; battle modes. Players can play the Game Boy games through &quot;Stadium&quot; via the connection. The Lab also allows players to receive Pokémon species as gifts, with the species available being species obtainable only as part of a one-time choice in the Game Boy games, allowing for players to more easily complete their Pokedex in the Game Boy games.

The Kids Club feature allows players to play mini-games, which deviate from standard gameplay to &quot;Mario Party&quot;-styled mini-games. Nine mini-games are included in &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot;, and each game allows up to four players, who all play as Pokémon. If any of the four player slots are not taken, the CPU takes over the excess slots. There are a large variety of games, such as a game based on Simon Says featuring Clefairy, and a game based on ring toss featuring Ekans.

==Development==
&quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; was developed by Nintendo EAD. Producer Shigeru Miyamoto explained in 1997 that Nintendo EAD was then a group of 20 to 30 staff each devoted to every title. Within EAD, a programming group called SRD involved a separate company of about 200 people working exclusively for Nintendo. Nintendo EAD had previously produced &quot;Pocket Monsters Stadium,&quot; the prior entry in the series&quot;.&quot; &quot;Pocket Monsters Stadium&quot; was initially set for release on the cancelled 64DD console and was planned to feature every Pokémon from the Game Boy games. This number was reduced to 40 during development and eventually released on cartridge for the Nintendo 64.

&quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; was initially released in Japan as &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2,&quot; acting as a sequel and expansion to the Japan-exclusive &quot;Pocket Monsters Stadium&quot;. Unlike the prior release, &quot;Stadium&quot; allowed the usage of all 151 species of Pokémon instead of the limited pool of 40 used prior, and greatly expanded on various different gameplay features that were in the prior game. For the US releases of &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot;, the Gallery mode was included, Pikachu&#x27;s voice was changed, and changes were made to the tournaments used in the game. In the international releases of the game, the in-game announcer is portrayed by Ted Lewis, while Pikachu is portrayed by Ikue Ōtani.

==Release and promotion==

===Japan===
&quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; was announced in the December 1998 issue of the Japanese magazine &quot;The 64Dream&quot;. In March and April, Nintendo held a tournament involving the game as part of the &quot;Pokemon Festival &#x27;99&quot;, an event to promote &quot;Stadium&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; (1999) and &quot;Pokémon Pinball&quot; (1999).

&quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; was released to retail on April 30, 1999, for the Nintendo 64. &quot;Nintendo Official Magazine&quot; reported in July 1999 that &quot;Pokemon Stadium&quot; was the number one best-selling game in Japan, followed by &quot;Pokemon Pinball&quot; in second place. The magazine commented that it had been &quot;a long time since Nintendo featured so well in Japanese charts. That&#x27;s the power of Pokémon.&quot; It was the 10th best-selling video game of the year in Japan by August 1999. Nintendo reported to have sold 1,370,000 copies of the game by December 1999 in the region.

===International===

Sales for the Nintendo 64 console fell 12.5% in the United States in the year prior to the release of &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot;, with Enrique Rivero of &quot;Video Business&quot; describing sales as being &quot;softer-than-expected&quot;. The report stated that this was largely due to consumers purchasing &quot;Pokémon&quot; games for the Game Boy instead. Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise was at a high point of popularity in the United States by late 1999, with the franchise having a high-selling VHS tape, top-viewed kids television show, and over seven million &quot;Pokémon&quot; game cartridges sold.

On March 6, 2000, Nintendo launched a $7 million &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; advertising campaign on television, print, and online media as part of a wider $30 million &quot;Pokémon&quot; promotion. Nintendo released a promotional &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; bundle featuring a Nintendo 64 console, two differently colored Nintendo 64 controllers, a poster, a journal, and a &quot;Cool Porygon&quot; promo card for the trading card game.

Nintendo of America promoted the game through a national tour between March 11 and April 9 titled the &quot;Pokémon 2000 Stadium Tour&quot;, allowing them play &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot;. Nintendo embarked on its first online marketing push for the franchise specifically for the United Kingdom, launching an official &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; website specifically for a UK audience.

In celebration of the game&#x27;s North American release, Nintendo and Blockbuster partnered for a promotion in which the first &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; game cartridges delivered to Blockbuster contained a coupon for a limited-edition &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; sticker poster and a free &quot;Pokémon Smart Card,&quot; which could be used to redeem up to sixteen stickers at Blockbuster locations. The Smart Cards were previously available in Blockbuster&#x27;s 1999 promotion for &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;.

The game was released in the United States on March 6 and in Europe on April 7, 2000. It sold over 100,000 in the United Kingdom. By April, Nintendo of America announced that &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; sold over 1 million copies. It became the best-selling console game in the region during the year 2000. Anne Sherber of &quot;Supermarket News&quot; wrote that Nintendo had the biggest share of the American console video game market in 2000, with sales of the Nintendo 64 being driven by the release of &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot;. &quot;Games&quot; magazine reporting that 12% of video games sold in 2000 were &quot;Pokemon&quot;-related titles. A Nintendo represented posited that the sales were due to their new series of N64 featuring translucent case colors, while Quang Hong of &quot;Gamasutra&quot; inferred sale may have been due to &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; release.

Nintendo of America announced that it would be released as a Player&#x27;s Choice title, a well-selling game with a lower suggested retail price, on December 26, 2000. At least more than 3.97 million copies have been sold, including 3.16 million in the United States, 710,765 in Japan, and more than 100,000 in the United Kingdom. The book &quot;Pikachu&#x27;s Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokemon&quot; stated that the while the game&#x27;s innovative features helped elevate it to a level of success, &quot;Stadium&quot; was unable to replicate the success of the Game Boy games before it.

==Reception==
&quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics, attaining a score of 78.60% on review aggregator GameRankings based on 26 reviews. &quot;GameSpot&quot; contributor Jeff Gerstmann highlighted the Pokémon&#x27;s visual appearances and battling, but stated that the lack of a story and the &quot;generic&quot; battling may be off-putting for players. &quot;IGN&quot; Peer Schneider praised the game&#x27;s connectivity with the Game Boy games and the game&#x27;s difficult battles, as well as the visual appearances for the Pokémon. He criticized the game&#x27;s repetitive gameplay and the game&#x27;s sound design. &quot;Famitsu&quot; praised the game, highlighting its focus on strategy and the animations of the individual Pokémon.

&quot;GameRevolution&quot; praised the game&#x27;s expressive Pokémon models and animations, and highlighted the degree of strategy needed to succeed in battle compared to the Game Boy releases. They criticized the repetitiveness of the gameplay and the game&#x27;s announcer. Regarding the game&#x27;s announcer, a frequent complaint among critics, &quot;RPGamer&quot;&#x27;s Ben Martin praised the game&#x27;s interactions with the Game Boy and accessibility, but criticized the game&#x27;s lack of features for players who didn&#x27;t have access to the Game Boy games, as well as for the lack of content available to returning players. He also criticized the game&#x27;s lack of striking musical score and the game&#x27;s announcer. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; praised the game, highlighting its graphics, but criticized the game&#x27;s music and announcer.

David Grossman, writing for &quot;Inverse&quot;, praised the game&#x27;s Game Boy compatibility and novelty factor as a result, but criticized the Nintendo Switch port for not maintaining that novelty. Arjun Joshi, writing for &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;, praised the game&#x27;s 3D graphics, gameplay options, and music, but criticized the game&#x27;s lack of content for players without access to the Game Boy&#x27;s compatibility features.

During the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot; received a nomination for the &quot;Console Family&quot; award by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences.

==Sequel and legacy==
Months after its debut, a follow-up to &quot;Pokémon Stadium&quot;, tentatively titled &quot;Pokémon Stadium Gold/Silver&quot;, was announced by Nintendo. The game was released in 2000 as &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot;, featuring every Pokémon from the first two generations, including those released in &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;. Transfer Pak compatibility is included for &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot;, &quot;Silver&quot;, and &quot;Crystal&quot; as well as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot;.

Following the release of &quot;Stadium 2&quot;, several games with similar gameplay to the &quot;Stadium&quot; series were released, but no official continuation to it was. According to Game Freak employees Shigeru Ohmori and Junichi Masuda, the &quot;Stadium&quot; series&#x27; main feature of allowing for Pokémon battles in 3D was not considered as &quot;impressive&quot; as it was before, primarily due to the release of &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, the first mainline &quot;Pokémon&quot; games to feature entirely 3D graphics. They stated it would require &quot;some sort of new invention&quot; to justify the series&#x27; return.

The game was re-released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on April 12, 2023. The re-release functions identically to the original game, but transfer and connectivity capabilities with the Game Boy are not available. Online features were additionally implemented, allowing players to play the Kids Club mini-games with players through Nintendo Switch Online. The game was later updated to patch out a bug that would consider in-game rental Pokémon&#x27;s movesets to be hacked.

<text>Trac is an open-source, web-based project management and bug tracking system. It has been adopted by a variety of organizations for use as a bug tracking system for both free and open-source software and proprietary projects and products. Trac integrates with major version control systems including (&quot;out of the box&quot;) Subversion and Git. Trac is used, among others, by Django, FFmpeg, WebKit, 0 A.D., and WordPress.

Trac is available on all major operating systems including Windows via Installer or Bitnami, OS X via MacPorts or pkgsrc, Debian, Ubuntu, Arch Linux or FreeBSD, as well as on various cloud hosting services.

== History ==
Inspired by CVSTrac, Jonas Borgström and Daniel Lundin from Edgewall Software started writing &quot;svntrac&quot; in August 2003 using SQLite and Subversion. In December 2003 they renamed it to &quot;Trac&quot;. In February 2004 the Trac version was changed first from 0.0.1 to 0.1 and then directly from 0.1 to 0.5. That release was followed in March 2004 by 0.6 and 0.7, and 0.8 in November 2004.

Edgewall Software is an umbrella organization for hosting edgewall.org for the community to collaborate on developing open source Python software. It used to offer software development, consulting and support services. Some of the earliest community members to collaborate in the open source development of Trac were Rocky Burt in March 2004, Christopher Lenz and Francois Harvey in May 2004, Christian Boos and Otavio Salvador in December 2004 and Mark Rowe March 2005.

In August 2005 the license was changed from GPL-2.0-or-later to BSD-3-Clause. The first release under this final license was Trac 0.9 in October 2005, which among other features introduced PostgreSQL database support.

Trac 0.10, released in September 2006, was an important release that first introduced the component system that to this day allows plugins to extend and add features to Trac&#x27;s core. Trac itself since this point consists mainly of optional plugin components that can be disabled or replaced entirely. MySQL database support is added as one such core component. This release added support for version control systems other than Subversion by external plugins. Mercurial support was provided through a separate plugin due to its GPL license restrictions. Trac 0.11, released in June 2008, changed the HTML template system from ClearSilver to Genshi, breaking compatibility with many of the older plugins.

Trac 0.12 was released in June 2010 and became a stable long term release with the latest point release 0.12.7 from July 2015. It added internationalization and localization support using &quot;Babel&quot;, and allows using multiple version control repositories at once.

Trac 1.0 was released in September 2012, the previous stable long term supported version with the latest point release 1.0.13 from September 2016. It included the previously external plugin for Git version control support.

Trac 1.1.1 from February 2013 through 1.1.6 from July 2015 are releases without long-term support and compatibility guarantees, that turned into Trac 1.2 from November 2016.

Trac 1.4 from August 2019 was the last stable release running on Python 2.7. It uses the Jinja template system.

Trac 1.6 from September 2023 is the current stable release and works exclusively on Python3. Many of the plugins have also been rewritten to work on Python3 as well as Jinja.

== Core features ==
Trac offers a no-frills approach to project management by deeply integrating ticket tracking, version control (for which multiple repositories per environment are supported), and wiki. It allows hyperlinking information between these systems, include wiki content directly in a ticket or list tickets automatically on wiki pages.

The ticket system can be used for tracking bugs, tasks, issues, incidents or any other kind of ticket. Customized reports can be generated from parametric stored SQL queries or using an interactive ticket query system. There is also an integrated search engine and a fine-grained permission system.

Additional project management features include grouping tickets into milestones and a roadmap where the milestones and their progress are listed and visualized. The recent activity is shown on a timeline page, and users are notified by email or can subscribe to RSS or iCalendar feeds.

== Additional features ==

Trac has a plugin system to add additional features and to integrate with external tools. Besides the core SVN and Git support, Trac can connect via plugins to many other version control systems, including Bazaar, CVS, Darcs, Mercurial, Monotone, and Perforce.
Features provided by plugins include Continuous integration, account management, tags, spam filtering, blogs and discussion fora, and connectors for XML-RPC and Pastebin.

== Apache Bloodhound ==

Apache Bloodhound is a web-based project management and bug tracking system built on top of Trac. 
The Bloodhound project was initially submitted to the Apache Incubator by WANdisco.
Bloodhound became a top-level Apache project in 2013. Bloodhound added multi-project support to Trac.
According to the Bloodhound webpage, this project has been retired (August 2024).

<doc id="431202" wikidata="Q10967" url="?curid=431202" title="Oonopidae">
<text>Oonopidae, also known as goblin spiders, is a family of spiders consisting of over 1,600 described species in about 113 genera worldwide, with total species diversity estimated at 2000 to 2500 species. The type genus of the family is &quot;Oonops&quot; .

Goblin spiders are generally tiny, measuring about 1 to 3 millimeters. Some have scuta, hardened plates on their abdomens. Oonopids usually have six eyes, the anterior median eyes having been lost. However, four-eyed (&quot;Opopaea viamao&quot;), two-eyed (e.g. &quot;Coxapopha&quot;, &quot;Diblemma&quot;) and even completely eyeless species (e.g. &quot;Cousinea&quot;, the cave-dwelling &quot;Blanioonops&quot;) are also known. The family is permeated with unusual morphological traits, many of which are limited to males. Examples include heavily modified mouthparts (e.g. &quot;Coxapopha&quot;, &quot;Xyccarph&quot;), sternal pouches (sometimes alternatively called holsters; e.g. &quot;Grymeus&quot;) and extensions of the carapace (e.g. &quot;Ferchestina&quot;, &quot;Unicorn&quot;). The male pedipalps are also often highly modified. The genus &quot;Opopaea&quot;, for example, exhibits an expanded palpal patella while male &quot;Ischnothyreus&quot; are characterized by completely sclerotized, pitch-black pedipalps. Members of the genus &quot;Orchestina&quot; are believed to be able to jump, as both sexes have greatly enlarged femora on the fourth leg pair.

Oonopidae are seldom seen by people as they are too small to be easily noticed. They are generally found in the leaf litter layer and under rocks, but they also constitute a significant component of the spider fauna living in the canopy of tropical rainforest. Three blind Afrotropical genera (&quot;Anophthalmoonops&quot;, &quot;Caecoonops&quot;, &quot;Termitoonops&quot;) are exclusively found in termite nests. A few species, such as the pantropical &quot;Heteroonops spinimanus&quot; and &quot;Triaeris stenaspis&quot;, are thought to be parthenogenetic as no males have yet been collected.

== Fossil record ==
Oonopidae are frequently encountered as subfossils preserved in copals and as fossils preserved in amber. Oonopids even occur in more amber deposits than any other spider family, which may be accounted for by their widespread distribution, small size, and wandering behaviour, as amber appears to be biased towards trapping such spiders. In contrast, sedimentary fossils of Oonopidae are unknown.

Most fossil oonopids described from amber are assigned to the extant genus &quot;Orchestina&quot;. This genus was already widespread by the end of the Cretaceous, as indicated by specimens found in amber dating back over 100 million years.

<text>The Bayonne Bridge is an arch bridge that spans the Kill Van Kull between Staten Island, New York, and Bayonne, New Jersey, United States. It carries New York State Route 440 and New Jersey Route 440, with the two roads connecting at the state border at the river’s center. It has the sixth-longest steel arch mainspan in the world, the longest in the world at the time of its completion. The bridge is also one of four connecting New Jersey with Staten Island; the other two roadway bridges are the Goethals Bridge in Elizabeth and Outerbridge Crossing (which also carries Route 440) in Perth Amboy, and the rail-only span is the Arthur Kill Vertical Lift Bridge, all of which cross the Arthur Kill.

The original four-lane roadway was designed for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey by Swiss master bridge-builder Othmar Ammann and architect Cass Gilbert. Completed in 1931, it included a walkway, and offered of vertical clearance above the water.

A Port Authority project to provide increased clearance required to accommodate New Panamax ships began in 2013, raising it approximately to by June 8, 2017. The new roadways opened on May 24, 2019, with each carrying two lanes of unidirectional motor traffic plus shoulders for disabled vehicles, in addition to a separate path for pedestrians and bicyclists.

== Design ==
Bayonne Bridge was designed by Swiss master bridge-builder Othmar Ammann and architect Cass Gilbert. It spans the Kill Van Kull between Port Richmond in Staten Island, New York, and Bayonne in Hudson County, New Jersey. The bridge was constructed at a 58-degree angle to the Kill Van Kull, parallel to the street networks of both Bayonne and Port Richmond, Staten Island, requiring a longer span than if the bridge had been built perpendicular to the straight. The total length of the bridge is .

=== Roadbed ===
As built, the Bayonne Bridge contained a roadbed long without intermediary piers. The main span was connected to viaducts at either end. The Port Richmond viaduct was long and the Bayonne viaduct was long, supported by piers that ranged from tall. The bridge originally featured a mid-span clearance above the water of , adequate for the United States Navy&#x27;s tallest ships at the time. The roadway was wide.

Between 2013 and 2019, the bridge&#x27;s clearance was raised approximately , from . A new roadway was constructed above the existing roadway within the current arch structure. This new clearance was to accommodate Post-Panamax ships.

=== Arch ===
The Bayonne Bridge&#x27;s steel parabolic arch is made up of 40 linear segments. Its lower chord rises above the Kill Van Kull, while the upper is above the waterway. The arch is influenced by the Hell Gate Bridge in New York City, designed by Ammann&#x27;s mentor Gustav Lindenthal. Gilbert had specified an ornamental granite sheathing over the steelwork as part of the original proposal, but as in the case of the George Washington Bridge, the stone was eliminated in order to lower the cost of the bridge during the Great Depression. It was the first bridge to employ manganese steel for the main arch ribs and rivets.

When completed in 1931, the Bayonne Bridge was the longest through arch bridge in the world. It surpassed the Sydney Harbour Bridge, its more massive-arched &quot;sister bridge&quot; in Australia, by and took the distinction from the Hell Gate Bridge. The Bayonne Bridge has a lightweight design, weighing only , compared to the Sydney Harbour Bridge&#x27;s . The Bayonne Bridge is also half as wide and longer overall than its sister bridge.

==History==
===Early history and construction===
====Conceptualization and background====

In 1921, the Port of New York Authority (now the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey) was created to oversee transportation in the Port of New York and New Jersey. At the time, bridges in New York City were being built at a brisk pace. The Port Authority opened its first two bridges between New Jersey and Staten Island in 1928: the Goethals Bridge and the Outerbridge Crossing. A third crossing was being planned between Port Richmond and Bayonne. All three bridges were built to complement the traffic from a future fourth bridge or a tunnel from Staten Island to Brooklyn. Initially, the third crossing was proposed to be a tunnel. However, the Port Authority ultimately decided to construct a bridge, to be designed by Ammann and Gilbert. Ammann, who was chief architect of the Port Authority, chose the steel arch design after rejecting a cantilever and suspension design as expensive and impractical for the site, given a requirement by the Port Authority that the bridge must be able to accommodate the future addition of rapid transit tracks.

====Construction====
Construction on the bridge began in 1928. At the time, it was supposed to be open in early 1932 and was supposed to cost $16 million (), but it ended up costing only $13 million to build (). The bridge had to be built without blocking shipping traffic on the Kill Van Kull. To do this, engineers used hydraulic jacks to support the two sides of the arch while the two pieces, consisting of prefabricated truss segments that were made up of high-strength alloy steel, were being built toward a point in a middle. Afterward, prefabricated pieces of the roadway&#x27;s support structure were hung from cables connected to the arch.

===Opening and 20th century===
====1930s to 1960s====

The Bayonne Bridge opened on November 15, 1931, after dedication ceremonies were held the previous day. On opening day, about 7,000 pedestrians and 17,000 vehicles crossed the bridge. The new crossing was expected to reduce Staten Islanders&#x27; average commutes by 18 to 20 minutes, reducing the need to use the Goethals Bridge or Outerbridge Crossing. The Bayonne Bridge&#x27;s dedication ceremony was attended by David M. Dow, the Secretary for Australia in the United States, and the same pair of golden shears used to cut the ribbon was sent to Australia for the ribbon-cutting of the Sydney Harbour Bridge four months later. After the ceremony in Sydney, the scissor blades were separated and one was sent back to the Port Authority. &quot;Time&quot; referred to the symmetric detail of the bridge as &quot;impressive and haunting&quot;, while the commune of Bayonne in France sent a congratulatory telegram. The American Institute for Steel Construction selected the Bayonne Bridge as the &quot;Most Beautiful Steel Bridge&quot; in 1931, choosing it over the George Washington Bridge. The bridge was designed with space for railroad tracks, but these were never built.

Pedestrians were originally required to pay a toll. This practice was eliminated in 1940, at which point the operator booths for collecting it were demolished. The Bergen Point Ferry, which paralleled the bridge, stayed in service until 1961.

Between 1939 and 1942, during World War II, the space under the Bayonne Bridge&#x27;s Staten Island approach became the Archer Daniels Midland Manhattan Project Storage Site, utilized for storing uranium. The material was used in the nuclear weapons developed during the Manhattan Project, and about 2,007 barrels weighing were stored under the bridge. Due to the long half-life and high radioactivity of unrefined uranium ore, the site became highly polluted and was later designated a federal Superfund site. Cleanup by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was scheduled for completion by the end of 2023.

The tollbooth was re-landscaped in a beautification project conducted in 1951 by the Port Authority and the City of Bayonne. In 1956, some land under the New Jersey approach viaduct was set aside to create the Juliette Street Playground. A new toll plaza in Staten Island was created in 1964. Additionally, the bridge deck was widened. In 1966, the Staten Island toll plaza was altered significantly, replacing the original toll booths with six modern toll booths along with and widening the viaduct near the toll plaza. The project also made electrical modifications and installed new lighting.
====1970s to 1990s====
The toll plaza stopped collecting tolls from New Jersey-bound drivers in 1970, with three of the toll booths being demolished. From this point on, tolls would only be collected from vehicles entering Staten Island and leaving Bayonne. To save energy during the 1973 oil crisis, the decorative lighting across the arch span was shut off temporarily that year. The bridge became a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1985.

On October 2, 1990, heavy truck traffic was temporarily banned after a crane being towed by a tugboat struck the center span. The bridge reopened two days later, with traffic reduced to one lane to allow the bridge to undergo emergency repairs. On October 12, 1991, the bridge was closed for inspection and repair after a container ships loading boom damaged five of the arches&#x27; stringer beams.

In 1995, a CCTV security system with 24/7 cameras were installed along the walkway to monitor and prevent self harm. Additionally. new lighting was installed on the plazas and approaches, and improvements were made to the Morningstar Road off-ramp under a separate contract. The bridge began accepting E-ZPass in June 1997, making it the first PANYNJ bridge to start accepting the system. In 1999, the bridge was extensively rehabilitated. The roadway pavement was removed, the concrete deck, expansion joints and scuppers of both approaches were replaced, the concrete deck, joints and scuppers of the central span were repaired and a latex modified concrete pavement was laid on the roadway. The superstructure steel members and concrete piers of the entire bridge were also repaired. Later that same year, permanent maintenance and construction platforms were built beneath the roadway and the approaches to allow for easier inspection.

=== 21st century ===
In 2001, various improvements were made to the CCTV system, and new navigational lights and aviation lights were installed. Additionally, most of the street lamps were replaced, and the structurally deficient New Jersey abutment was extensively rehabilitated.

====Late 2000s and early 2010s: Plans for roadbed raising====

In the late 2000s, the Port Authority began to plan a project to allow larger container ships to use the Kill Van Kull. The expansion of the Panama Canal was announced to allow new contemporary ships coming from Asia to reach the East Coast, but the bridge was too low for these larger ships to pass under it on the way to and from Newark Bay. Its clearance of between above the Kill Van Kull depending on the tide already meant that some contemporary ships, which could reach above the waterline, had to fold down antenna masts, take on ballast, or wait for low tide to pass through. New, larger New Panamax ships made things worse. If the problem were not fixed, the Port of New York and New Jersey could have lost significant shipping business to other ports such as Charleston, South Carolina. In August 2009, the Port Authority started a planning analysis to determine how to fix the air draft problem. Final construction in the raise the road project was completed in May 2019 with the opening of the new higher pedestrian and bicycle path. Additionally, the New Jersey abutment was structurally deficient, and the bridge was functionally obsolete.

The Port Authority commissioned the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) to conduct a study of the question, which was completed in 2009, and authorized up to $10 million for planning and engineering services to develop options to deal with the bridge&#x27;s low clearance. The CoE study looked at three options for the bridge, besides the no-build option. The quickest option they identified, and the one ultimately chosen, was a $1.7 billion project to raise the bridge&#x27;s roadway to increase its height by 40 percent, which could be accomplished by 2019 at the earliest. It would need a clearance of to handle the new ships. Another option presented was to build a new cable-stayed bridge, which would have cost $2.15 billion and taken until 2022. The most expensive option would be to get rid of the bridge altogether and replace it with either a bored tunnel or an immersed tunnel through which traffic would traverse under the Kill Van Kull. This option would have taken the longest, being complete in 2024 and costing $2.2 to $3 billion. In initial planning documents, a vertical-lift bridge was also considered, but this was not investigated further in the CoE study.

Another study, an environmental review by the U.S. Coast Guard, was commissioned in 2009. The review was required because the project would take place over a navigable waterway. The study cost over $2 million, took four years, and resulted in 5,000 pages of reviews. Despite its duration and cost, which precluded the start of construction until 2013, it was one of the Coast Guard&#x27;s quickest environmental reviews for such a major project. In March 2012, the Port Authority submitted a request to the federal government for an expedited environmental review process, which was approved in July 2012 even though some residents in Newark and Staten Island said they wanted the Coast Guard to conduct a full environmental review.


According to the Port Authority, the &quot;Raise the Roadway&quot; project would have many benefits, the first being that it would allow larger, more environmentally friendly ships to pass through the port. As a result of the project, the proportion of the arc above the roadway would be reduced, with only 22 cables suspending the new roadway below the arch as opposed to 30 cables holding up the old roadway. As for the roadway itself, the single roadway would be replaced by two new roadway decks with new supporting piers and approach roads. Route 440 would be widened from one roadway with no shoulders and four lanes, to two roadways with two lanes each, a median divider, and shoulders. There would also be a bikeway and walkway the entire length of the bridge, with access ramps to replace stairs. The design also allows for future transit service such as light rail. Extending the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail line to Staten Island over the bridge has been proposed, though final design plans do not include a rapid transit component. Finally, the project would support nearly 2,800 jobs and $240–380 million in wages throughout the construction industry, as well as $1.6 billion of economic activity.

The CoE estimated that raising the Bayonne Bridge would produce a $3.3 billion national benefit, noting that 12% of all US international containers pass under the bridge, that the port indirectly creates 269,900 jobs, and that port activity generates $11 billion in annual national wages. The project would allow 12,000-container ships to pass under the bridge, increasing capacity; before the project, the largest ships allowed to pass under the bridge were 9,000-container ships. Congressmen from both New York and New Jersey pressed the Port Authority to act quickly, despite lowered revenues from reduced traffic at the Port Authority&#x27;s six crossings. The Port Authority announced its official plan in 2011. The Coast Guard held two public meetings about the bridge in 2012. Improvements at Port Jersey on the Upper New York Bay were also underway.

====Mid-2010s: Construction of new roadbed====

The Port Authority believed that it was possible to build the new roadway without interrupting traffic flow between Staten Island and Bayonne. In July 2012, the Port Authority announced construction would begin in the middle of 2013, to be completed by 2017. In this timeline, removal of the existing roadway would be completed by late 2015, in time for the opening of the widened Panama Canal. The project would cost $1.7 billion and last five years.

One of the challenges faced by the project was the tight confines of the construction area: residential homes lay less than from the work site, though none of them were in the path of the construction itself. In 2014, Staten Islanders living near the Port Richmond work site filed a lawsuit, alleging that the construction work violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by exposing predominately-minority communities in Port Richmond to toxins. In 2015, some Bayonne residents lodged complaints due to excessive noise, vibrations, dust over their neighborhood, and construction debris falling off the bridge (such as paint chips), though the Port Authority later settled those complaints. The project would also necessitate the temporary closure of a park in Bayonne. Additionally, the Bayonne Bridge would remain open to vehicle traffic throughout the construction.

On April 24, 2013, the Port Authority&#x27;s Board of Commissioners awarded a $743.3 million contract to a joint venture of Skanska Koch and Kiewit Infrastructure Company. The construction involved building support columns first, then adding prefabricated road segments using a gantry crane that rolled on top of the arch. The gantry crane would construct one rope-supported section of the new roadway at a time, using a temporary beam to support the existing roadway while each rope was replaced. The existing roadway would then be removed. Temporary bridge closures allowed new floor beams to be attached to the arch&#x27;s ropes in order to support steel stringers that would hold up the new roadway. This work was expedited by Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential administration due to the importance of the project to national commerce, being one of the first applicants to Obama&#x27;s &quot;We Can&#x27;t Wait&quot; initiative of important infrastructure projects. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie also considered the project a high priority for his state.

The pedestrian walkway, cantilevered from the western side of the roadway, was temporarily closed on August 5, 2013, for reconstruction. It was to be moved to the eastern side of the bridge. The walkway was scheduled to reopen in 2017. In 2015, the completion date was delayed to 2019, due to unfavorable weather conditions in the winter of 2014–2015. This also delayed the desired navigational clearance to late 2017. The delays in the project meant that, with the expansion of the Panama Canal being completed in mid-2016, larger ships would not be able to serve Newark, thus possibly negatively affecting traffic to other ports on the United States&#x27; East Coast. The Port Authority revised its timeline, expecting traffic to be shifted to the new roadway in early 2017, the old roadway to be removed by late 2017, and the project to be completed in mid-2019 with the completion of the roadway for southbound traffic. In November 2016, the future northbound span, intended temporarily for both directions of travel, was completed.
On February 20, 2017, the completed eastern (future northbound) roadway opened for traffic, with one lane in each direction, and the old lower roadway was permanently closed. The western (future southbound) roadway was scheduled to be completed in 2019, at which time there would be two lanes in each direction and a pedestrian walkway. Also on February 20, the Bayonne Bridge became the first Port Authority crossing to use a fully automated and cashless electronic toll collection system. All vehicles proceed without stopping at the toll plaza. Those with E-ZPass are billed in the usual way, while cameras record the license plate numbers of those without an E-ZPass tag and their registered owners soon receive a toll bill by mail. The desired navigational clearance was achieved June 8, 2017. Two years after the opening of the northbound roadway, on February 11, 2019, the new southbound roadway was completed, and the traffic flow of the bridge was restored to two lanes in each direction. The pedestrian and bike path opened May 24, 2019. The overall project received the 2020 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement award from the American Society of Civil Engineers, citing the &quot;first-of-its-kind construction sequence, ... keeping both road and sea traffic open.&quot;

====2020s to present====
Suicide prevention call boxes were installed on the pedestrian walkway in March 2023. After they were implemented on the George Washington Bridge in December 2023, the 11 K1 call boxes on the pedestrian path were upgraded to utilize the Knightscope Emergency Management System (KEMS) in March 2024. A study is being commenced to potentially upgrade existing suicide equipment, as well as adding equipment to the northbound roadway. Upgrades include adding netting to the fences of the pedestrian path, and upgrading call boxes to have increased communication capabilities with the Port Authority Police.

==Traffic==

From January to November 2016, the Bayonne Bridge carried about 4,500 vehicles per day. The E-ZPass automatic collection system was used by 91% of drivers for toll payment. In 2011, it carried an average of 19,378 vehicles per day, which dropped to a daily average of 15,221 vehicles in 2014 after construction started, and further to 10,840 in 2015. The Bayonne Bridge is more lightly trafficked than any other Port Authority crossing.

In September 2007, MTA Regional Bus Operations began a limited-stop bus route (the S89) that crosses the bridge. The route&#x27;s termini are the Hylan Boulevard bus terminal in Eltingville, Staten Island and the 34th Street Hudson-Bergen Light Rail Station in Bayonne. This is the first interstate bus service offered by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

==Tolls==
, the tolls-by-mail rate going from New Jersey to New York City is $18.31 for cars and motorcycles; there is no toll for passenger vehicles going from New York City to New Jersey. New Jersey and New York–issued E-ZPass users are charged $14.06 for cars and $13.06 for motorcycles during off-peak hours, and $16.06 for cars and $15.06 for motorcycles during peak hours. Users with E-ZPass issued from agencies outside of New Jersey and New York are charged the tolls-by-mail rate. Frequent users traveling more than three trips per month can receive discounts under the &quot;Staten Island Bridges Plan&quot; ($8.03 per trip for cars at all times).

Tolls are collected only for southbound traffic. Originally, tolls were collected in both directions. In August 1970, the toll was abolished for northbound drivers, and at the same time, southbound drivers saw their tolls doubled. The tolls of eleven other New York–New Jersey and Hudson River crossings along a stretch, from the Outerbridge Crossing in the south to the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in the north, were changed to eastbound-only at that time.

Open-road cashless tolling began on February 20, 2017. The tollbooths were dismantled, and drivers were no longer able to pay cash at the bridge. Instead, there are cameras mounted onto new overhead gantries located on the Staten Island side. A vehicle without E-ZPass has a picture taken of its license plate and a bill for the toll is mailed to its owner. For E-ZPass users, sensors detect their transponders wirelessly.

==In popular culture==
The Bayonne Bridge appears in the 2005 science fiction film &quot;War of the Worlds&quot;, being shown in the background several times in the scenes set in the lead character&#x27;s Bayonne home; it is then destroyed in an attack by aliens. The bridge and surrounding Bayonne community was also featured in the 2001 film &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; and the HBO prison drama &quot;Oz&quot;.

<doc id="431206" wikidata="Q517495" url="?curid=431206" title="Ghillie suit">
<text>A ghillie suit is a type of camouflage clothing designed to resemble the background environmentsuch as foliage. Typically, it is a net or cloth garment covered in loose strips of burlap (hessian), cloth, twine, or jute sometimes made to look like leaves and twigs, and optionally augmented with foliage from the area.

Military personnel, police, hunters, and nature photographers may wear a ghillie suit to blend into their surroundings and to conceal themselves from enemies or targets. The suit gives the wearer&#x27;s outline a three-dimensional breakup, rather than a linear one. When manufactured correctly, the suit will move in the wind in the same way as surrounding foliage. Some ghillie suits are made with light and breathable material that allows a person to wear a shirt underneath.

Hunters and soldiers may use ghillie suits with designs named for rural folk-spirits: the kikimora of the swamps or the leshy of the forests.

== History ==
The English word &quot;ghillie&quot; is derived from the Scots Gaelic , meaning a young man or older boy who works as an outdoor servant, and is most familiar in reference to those employed to assist sportsmen with recreational shooting or fishing in the Highlands. The term &quot;ghillie suit&quot; may be a reference to the , an earth spirit clothed in leaves and moss in Scottish mythology.

The Lovat Scouts, a Scottish Highland regiment formed by Simon Fraser, 14th Lord Lovat during the Second Boer War, is the first known military unit to use ghillie suits and in 1916 went on to become the British Army&#x27;s first sniper unit. The Lovat Scouts were initially recruited from Scottish Highland estate workers, especially professional stalkers and gamekeepers.

Similar sniper outfits in the Australian Army are nicknamed &quot;yowie suit&quot;, named for their resemblance to the yowie, a mythical hominid similar to the yeti and bigfoot which is said to live in the Australian wilderness.

==Technical and safety considerations==
Although highly effective, conventional ghillie suits (made in fabric or 3D leafsuits) are impractical for many situations where camouflage is useful. They tend to be very heavy and hot. Even in moderate climates, the temperature inside the ghillie suit can reach over . The burlap is also flammable, unless treated with fire retardant, so the wearer may be at increased risk from ignition sources such as smoke grenades or white phosphorus. Moreover, conventional ghillie suits and 3D leafsuits are made using fabric, so they retain water, and this dramatically increases weight. Conventional ghillie suits are not designed to camouflage in the IR spectrum. Fabric strips, especially of coarse material like burlap, readily snag on thorns, twigs, and barbed wire.

To enhance safety, the US Army Soldier Systems Center has developed an inherently fire-resistant, self extinguishing fabric to replace jute or burlap. This material was field tested in late 2007 at the Sniper School at Fort Benning and has been standard issue since June 2008.

Ghillie suits also have disadvantages in cold environments, as they can get soaked, risking hypothermia.

== Criminal use ==
Civilians have, on rare occasions, purchased ghillie suits to commit violent crimes (other than unlawful hunting). Police arrested an Australian man after they found that he had assaulted girls while wearing such a suit.

<text>Gregor Strasser (also , see ß; 31 May 1892 – 30 June 1934) was a German politician and early leader of the Nazi Party. Along with his younger brother Otto, he was a leading member of the party&#x27;s left-wing faction, which brought them into conflict with the dominant faction led by Adolf Hitler, resulting in his murder in 1934. The brothers&#x27; strand of the Nazi ideology is known as Strasserism.

Born in Bavaria, Strasser served in an Imperial German Army artillery regiment during World War I, rising to the rank of first lieutenant and winning the Iron Cross of both classes for bravery. After the war, he and his brother became members of Franz Ritter von Epp&#x27;s &quot;Freikorps&quot;. He joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1920 and quickly became an influential and important figure in the fledgling party. In 1923, Strasser took part in the abortive Beer Hall Putsch in Munich and was imprisoned. After securing an early release following his election to the &quot;Reichstag&quot;, he joined a revived NSDAP in 1925 and once again established himself as a powerful and dominant member. A highly skilled organiser and effective public speaker, Strasser oversaw a major increase in the party&#x27;s membership and reputation in northern Germany, transforming the NSDAP from a marginal southern party to a nationwide political force. By mid-1932, Strasser was in charge of the party&#x27;s national organizational work.

A strong advocate of the Nazi Party&#x27;s radical wing, Strasser&#x27;s anti-capitalist, revolutionary nationalist programme had led Hitler to repudiate him at the 1926 Bamberg Conference. The two later reconciled but their peace was increasingly untenable from 1930 on. In December 1932, Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher offered Strasser the post of Vice-Chancellor, creating a potential split within the Nazi Party. In response, Hitler isolated Strasser in the party and forced him to resign from all party offices. Strasser then renounced his &quot;Reichstag&quot; seat and retired from active politics, returning to his old profession as a pharmacist. On 30 June 1934, in a purge that became known as the Night of the Long Knives, Strasser was arrested by the Gestapo and subsequently executed.

==Early life==
Gregor Strasser was born on 31 May 1892 into the family of a Catholic judicial officer who lived in the Upper Bavarian market town of Geisenfeld. He grew up alongside his younger brother Otto, who was considered the more intellectual of the two. He attended the local Gymnasium and after his final examinations, served an apprenticeship as a pharmacist in the Lower Bavarian village of Frontenhausen from 1910 until 1914.

===World War I===
When war broke out in Europe in 1914, Strasser suspended his studies at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich to enlist as a volunteer in the German Imperial Army. He served in the 1st Bavarian Field Artillery Regiment, rising to the rank of Oberleutnant and winning the Iron Cross of both classes for bravery. In 1918, he resumed his studies at Friedrich-Alexander-University, Erlangen-Nuremberg. He passed his state examination in 1919 and in 1920, he started work as a pharmacist in Landshut.

===Paramilitary career===
In 1919, Strasser and his brother joined the right-wing &quot;Freikorps&quot; led by Franz Ritter von Epp. The aim of the group was to suppress communism in Bavaria. He established and commanded the &quot;Sturmbataillon Niederbayern&quot; (&quot;Storm Battalion Lower Bavaria&quot;), with the young Heinrich Himmler employed as his adjutant. Strasser was known for his enormous stature, commanding personality, and boundless organizational energy. By March 1920, Strasser&#x27;s Freikorps was ready to participate in the failed Kapp Putsch, whereas his brother Otto had turned to the left of the political spectrum and helped combat this right-wing &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;.

The Strasser brothers advocated an anti-capitalist and social revolutionary course for the NSDAP, which at the same time was also firmly antisemitic and anti-Marxist.

==Political career==
===Nazi Party activities===
By 1920, Strasser, and his paramilitary group had joined forces with Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Party (NSDAP), another far-right political party seated in Munich. During the autumn of 1922, Strasser officially became a member of the NSDAP and the SA. Strasser&#x27;s leadership qualities were soon recognized, and he was appointed as regional head of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (&quot;Storm Detachment&quot;; SA) in Lower Bavaria. In November 1923, he took an active part in the unsuccessful Beer Hall Putsch, a coup attempt by Hitler and Ludendorff against the Weimar Republic. He was tried with other putschists shortly after Hitler&#x27;s trial, convicted of aiding and abetting high treason—his actual arrest was for attempting to recruit soldiers for the NSDAP, which had been outlawed—on 12 May and sentenced to 15 months&#x27; imprisonment and a small fine.

After a few weeks Strasser was released because he had been elected a member of the Bavarian Landtag for the NSDAP-associated &quot;Völkischer Block&quot; on 6 April and 4 May (in the Palatinate) 1924, respectively. In December 1924 Strasser won a seat for the &quot;völkisch&quot; National Socialist Freedom Movement in the Reichstag. He represented the constituency Westphalia North.

After the restoration of the NSDAP by Adolf Hitler on 26 February 1925, Strasser became the first &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Lower Bavaria. Because Strasser led up to 2,000 men in Landshut and was overworked, he began looking for an assistant. Heinrich Himmler, who obtained the job, was tasked with expanding the organization in Lower Bavaria. In December 1926, Strasser&#x27;s &quot;Gau&quot; merged with that of the Upper Palatinate and Strasser headed the enlarged &quot;Gau&quot;. After a subsequent partition on 1 October 1928, the Upper Palatinate was taken over by Adolf Wagner while Strasser continued as &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Lower Bavaria until 1 March 1929.

===Role in the Nazi Party&#x27;s national organisation===
After 1925, Strasser&#x27;s organizational skills helped transform the Nazi Party from a marginal south-German splinter party into a nationwide party with mass appeal. Due to the public-speaking ban issued against Hitler, Strasser had been deputized (by Hitler) to represent the party in the north and speak. Through much of 1925, Strasser took full advantage of his liberties as a member of the Reichstag; using his free railroad passes, he traveled extensively throughout northern and western Germany appointing Gauleiters, setting up party branches, and delivering numerous public speeches. Lacking Hitler&#x27;s oratorical gifts to move the masses, Strasser&#x27;s personality alone was nonetheless sufficient to influence an audience. His concerted efforts helped the northern party so much that before the end of 1925, there were some 272 local NSDAP chapters compared to the 71 that existed before the failed putsch. Strasser&#x27;s brand of socialism is discernible from a speech he made to the Reichstag in November 1925:

Strasser established the Party in northern and western Germany as a strong political association, one which attained a larger membership than Hitler&#x27;s southern party section. The party&#x27;s own foreign organization was also formed on Strasser&#x27;s initiative. He also founded the National Socialist Working Association on 10 September 1925. This was a short-lived group of about a dozen northern and western German &quot;Gauleiter&quot;, who supported the more &quot;socialist&quot; wing of the Party and sought to increase its appeal to the working class in Germany&#x27;s large industrial cities. Together with his brother Otto, Strasser founded the Berlin &quot;Kampf-Verlag&quot; (&quot;Combat Publishing&quot;) in March 1926, which went on to publish the weekly newspaper the &quot;Berliner Arbeiterzeitung&quot; (&quot;Berlin Workers Newspaper&quot;), which represented the more &quot;socialist&quot; wing of the Party. Strasser appointed the young university-educated political agitator from the Rhineland, Joseph Goebbels as the managing editor of the &quot;Kampfverlag&quot;, a man who was drawn to the NSDAP political message and to Strasser himself. The two men drafted a revised version of the NSDAP political program during the winter of 1925–1926, one which leaned much further to the left and incensed Hitler. To deal with these proposed changes head-on, Hitler called for a meeting in the northern Bavarian city of Bamberg on 14 February 1926. Goebbels and Strasser traveled there hoping to convince Hitler of the new message. During the speech at the Bamberg Conference, Hitler lambasted the extreme ideas in the new draft, ideas which he conflated more with Bolshevism, a development which profoundly shocked and disappointed Strasser and Goebbels. Strasser&#x27;s follow-on speech was bumbled and ineffectual, the result of Hitler&#x27;s powerful oration; Hitler&#x27;s refutation of Strasser&#x27;s policy suggestions at Bamberg demonstrated that the party had officially become Hitler&#x27;s and the NSDAP centered around him.

Placating the northern German NSDAP branches in the wake of Bamberg, Hitler assigned leadership of the SA, which was temporarily vacated by Ernst Roehm, to one of Strasser&#x27;s own key members, Franz Pfeffer von Salomon. More importantly perhaps, Hitler began a personal campaign to lure away Strasser&#x27;s chief lieutenant, Goebbels, into his personal fold—a move which proved immediately successful. The future Führer also struck a deal with Strasser to disband the National Socialist Working Association and asked him to assume responsibility for the party propaganda department. Strasser accepted this position, but a car accident in March 1926 proved a setback: he was bedridden as a result. Upon recovery, he was welcomed back into this position. Thus, in addition to his Gauleiter responsibilities, from 16 September 1926 until 2 January 1928, he was the NSDAP&#x27;s national leader for propaganda (&quot;Reichspropagandaleiter&quot;). Strasser left his propaganda post to take up new responsibilities as Chairman of the NSDAP Organizational Committee, later, the Organizational Department &quot;(Organisationsableitung)&quot;.
Between 1928 and 1932, Hitler turned over the NSDAP&#x27;s national organizational work to Strasser, whose skills were better suited to the task, as Hitler was uninterested in organizational matters and preferred to give his attention to ideological concerns. On 18 December 1931, Hitler granted Strasser the rank of SA-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; and, in 1932, Strasser also became the editor of several biweekly and monthly Nazi news sheets. By June 1932, Strasser was named &quot;Reichsorganisationsleiter&quot;, and had further centralized the Party&#x27;s organizational structure under his command. During the course of the reorganizations, Strasser refashioned the NSDAP district boundaries to more closely align with those of the Reichstag and increased the authority of &quot;Gauleiters&quot;. Strasser reorganized both the party&#x27;s regional structure and its vertical management hierarchy. The party became a more centralized organization with extensive propaganda mechanisms. In the 1928 General Election on 20 May, Strasser was elected from electoral constituency 26 (Franconia) as one of the first 12 Nazi deputies to the Reichstag. While the NSDAP only received 2.6 percent of the national vote that year, it became the second largest party in the Reichstag by September 1930, securing 18.3 percent of the vote. Strasser&#x27;s organizational strengthening contributed to this success and the Nazis became the largest party in July 1932 with 37.3%.

===Conflicts with Hitler===
The Great Depression greatly affected Germany and by 1930 there was a dramatic increase in unemployment. During this time, the Strasser brothers started publishing a new regional daily newspaper in Berlin, the &quot;Nationaler Sozialist&quot;. Like their other publications, it conveyed the brothers&#x27; own brand of Nazism, including nationalism, anti-capitalism, social reform, and anti-Westernism. Goebbels complained vehemently about the rival Strasser newspapers to Hitler and admitted that their success was causing his own Berlin newspapers to be &quot;pushed to the wall&quot;. In late April 1930, Hitler publicly and firmly announced his opposition to Gregor Strasser&#x27;s socialist ideas and appointed Goebbels as Reich leader of NSDAP propaganda. When Hitler visited Goebbels on 2 May 1930, Goebbels banned the evening edition of the &quot;Nationaler Sozialist&quot;. Gregor Strasser distanced himself from his brother and relinquished his position as publisher of the &quot;Nationaler Sozialist&quot; by the end of June, while Otto left the Party at the beginning of July.

In August 1932, Hitler was offered the job of Vice-Chancellor of Germany by then Chancellor Franz von Papen at the behest of President Paul von Hindenburg, but he refused. Strasser urged him to enter a coalition government, but Hitler saw the offer as placing him in a position of &quot;playing second fiddle&quot;. While many in his inner circle, like Goebbels, saw his resistance as heroic, Strasser was frustrated and believed Hitler was wrong to hold out for the Chancellorship. The ideological and personal rivalry with Hitler grew when the successor Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher had discussions with Strasser as to becoming Vice-Chancellor in December 1932. Schleicher hoped to split the NSDAP with Strasser&#x27;s help, pulling the left wing of the NSDAP to his &quot;national conservative&quot; side to stop Hitler. Hitler was furious and demanded that Strasser refuse Schleicher&#x27;s offer. At a meeting of Nazi Reichstag members Hitler confronted the 30-40 that supported Strasser, forcing them to publicly support the former and denounce the latter. Strasser resigned from his party offices on 8 December 1932, just seven weeks before the NSDAP obtained political power. Hitler temporarily took over the post of &quot;Reichsorganisationsleiter&quot;, eventually turning it over to Robert Ley. On 16 January 1933, Hitler &quot;publicly repudiated Strasser&quot; for his interactions with Schleicher. In March 1933, Strasser officially exited politics by renouncing his Reichstag seat.

==Later life==

===Life after politics===
Having renounced his seat in the Reichstag, Strasser sought to return to his pre-politics profession as a pharmacist. Through his own connections and with Hitler&#x27;s consent he was provided with the opportunity to take up a directorship of Schering-Kahlbaum, a chemical-pharmaceutical company that was the Berlin subsidiary of IG Farben, so long as he promised to cease all political activity, which he did. He detached himself from politics, refusing to meet former political associates and, contrary to some reports, had no contact with his brother Otto&#x27;s Black Front organisation.

===Death===
Having achieved national power in January 1933, Hitler and the NSDAP began eliminating all forms of opposition in Germany. In what became known as the Night of the Long Knives, the entire SA leadership was purged, which took place from 30June to 2July 1934. Hitler, along with other top Nazis such as Hermann Göring and Himmler, targeted Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who, along with some of Hitler&#x27;s political adversaries, were rounded up, arrested, and shot by members of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) and Gestapo. Among them was Strasser. Historian Richard J. Evans surmises that Strasser was most likely killed for having been allegedly offered a position by the predecessor conservative Weimar government, a tie which made him a potential political enemy, due to the personal enmity of Himmler and Göring, both of whom Strasser had been critical of during his role in the party&#x27;s leadership. Whether Strasser was killed on Hitler&#x27;s personal orders is not known. He was shot once in the main artery from behind in his cell but did not die immediately. On the orders of SS general Reinhard Heydrich, Strasser was left to bleed to death, which took almost an hour. His brother Otto had emigrated in 1933.

<doc id="431208" wikidata="Q2034158" url="?curid=431208" title="Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington">
<text>William Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington, (12 April 1856 – 19 April 1937), known between 1895 and 1931 as Sir Martin Conway, was an English art critic, politician, cartographer and mountaineer, who made expeditions in Europe as well as in South America and Asia.

Conway occupied several university positions and from 1918 to 1931 was a representative of the Combined English Universities as a conservative member of the House of Commons.

In 1872 he took up mountain climbing and went on expeditions to Spitsbergen from 1896 to 1897 and the Andes of Bolivia in 1898. He is an author of books on art and exploration, which include &quot;Mountain Memories&quot; (1920), &quot;Art Treasures of Soviet Russia&quot; (1925), and &quot;Giorgione as a Landscape Painter&quot; (1929).

==Background and education==
Conway was born at Rochester, England, on 12 April 1856, the son of Reverend William Conway, who later became rector of St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster. He was the youngest of three children, having two older sisters, Elizabeth Ann (1852–1916) and Martha (1854–1938). He was educated at Repton and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics and became a close friend of Karl Pearson. It is also at Cambridge that he met Henry Bradshaw, then a librarian, and John Ruskin, who introduced Conway to art and the Alps. He became interested in woodcuts, engraving and early printed books; his &quot;History of the Woodcutters of the Netherlands in the Fifteenth Century&quot; was published in 1884.

==Mountaineering==
Conway was a member of the Alpine Club, of which he was president from 1902 to 1904.

In 1892, in the course of an exploring and mountaineering expedition undertaken under the auspices of the Royal Society, the Royal Geographical Society and the British Association, he made an ascent of a subsidiary summit of Baltoro Kangri, claiming a world altitude record with a height of 23,000 ft (7,010 m). However, subsequent measurements have revised his height to 22,322 ft (6,804 m). 

In 1896–97, accompanied by J. W. Gregory and others, he explored the interior of Spitsbergen, the first expedition to cross the mainland of the island. The following year he explored and surveyed the Bolivian Andes, climbing &quot;Sorata&quot; (known today as Ancohuma, 21,086 ft / 6,427 m) and Illimani (21,122 ft / 6,438 m). He also attempted Aconcagua (22,831 ft / 6,959 m), stopping short of the summit by 50 feet; and explored Tierra del Fuego, attempting Sarmiento. At the Paris Exhibition of 1900, he received the gold medal for mountain surveys, and in 1905 won a Founder&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society for his Spitsbergen exploration.

He served as president of the Alpine Club from 1902 to 1904, and became the first president of The Alpine Ski Club at its inaugural meeting in 1908, serving until 1911. Conway Island is named for him.

In 1924, Conway evaluated evidence from the 1924 British Mountaineering Expedition and believed George Mallory and Andrew Irvine had summitted Mt. Everest.

==Academic career==

From 1884 to 1887 Conway was a Professor of Art at University College, Liverpool; and from 1901 to 1904 he was Slade Professor of Fine Art at Cambridge University. He was knighted in 1895 for his efforts in mapping 5,180 square km of the Karakoram Range in the Himalayas three years earlier.

In 1889 he published a book concerning his research on Albrecht Dürer. He was assisted in this by the polymath Lina Eckenstein who was the sister of a fellow mountaineer.

During the early 1900s, he was active within the Society of Antiquaries of London. He gave many presentations at meetings and served multiple terms on its council, once in , and again from as a vice president of the society.

He also stood as president of the Kent Archaeological Society for some time in the 1920s and 1930s. He became president of the society in 1923, and announced in 1930 his wish to step down, citing declining health, although he continued as president after a request by the council. He again announced his retirement and stepped down in 1936, though agreed to continue as a vice president.

Conway was an art collector; he began collecting in 1887. Conway was the first Director-General of the Imperial War Museum and a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery from 1922 to 1937. His photograph collection formed the basis of the Conway Library at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London. He was also responsible for the restoration of Allington Castle in Kent.

==Political career==
Conway had been involved in politics for some time, consorting with both major parties allegedly in pursuit of a knighthood and a barony; he received both. He was mentioned as a possible Liberal candidate for Wolverhampton South in early 1900, but withdrew his candidature &#x27;owing to domestic circumstances&#x27;. In 1902 Conway was involved in a deal with Bolivian president José Manuel Pando regarding a tract of land named the Caupolican concession, which was rich in rubber. The concession was divided between Conway and American investors that were interested in the Acre region. In 1907, Conway became a director of The Inambari Para-Rubber Estates Limited, which exported latex products from the Inambari River in Peru. He was elected Unionist Member of Parliament for the Combined English Universities in 1918, serving until 1931, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Conway of Allington, of Allington in the County of Kent, in the Dissolution Honours.

He died in London on 19 April 1937. The title became extinct on his death.

Group members included Guy Villari on lead; Sal Cuomo, first tenor-lead on &quot;Laura&quot; &amp; “I&#x27;m So Lonely&quot;; Chuck Fassert, second tenor; Don Jacobucci (who co-wrote &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; B-side &quot;I’m So Lonely&quot; with Cuomo) sax player/baritone; Tony Gravagna on bass; Ron Hunerberg on drums.

An earlier version of the group from 1957 was called The Monterays, and included Villari, Cuomo, Fassert and Ernie Maresca (who later had a hit with &quot;Shout! Shout! (Knock Yourself Out)&quot;, and also wrote songs such as the Regents&#x27; &quot;Runaround&quot; and &quot;The Wanderer&quot; recorded by Dion).

The group recorded demos at Bell Sound, Associated, and Regent Sound studios. They were signed to Seville Records as The Desires, however, none of the songs they recorded were released, until the group had success three years later as The Regents. The Regents&#x27; name came from a combination of recording a demo at Regent Sound studio, and the fact that Villari smoked Regents cigarettes.

In 1958 the group recorded Cuomo&#x27;s &quot;A Teenager&#x27;s Love&quot;. At the same recording session they waxed &quot;Barbara-Ann&quot; in three takes. Shortly afterwards, Tony Gravagna was installed into the group. Unable to secure a recording contract, they disbanded about a year later.

Eddie Jacobucci revived the Regents by accident. His group, the Consorts, lacked original songs for an audition, so they recorded a version of &quot;Barbara-Ann&quot;. The owner of Cousins Records heard the track and decided to release the original version by the Regents. The original group reunited, and Cousins released &quot;Barbara-Ann&quot; in March 1961. It became a No. 1 record in New York; the demand was such that Cousins leased it to Roulette/Gee for worldwide distribution, and it reached in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Their follow-up release, &quot;Runaround&quot;, written by Maresca, went to on the pop chart and R&amp;B. They released two more records for Gee, but after a royalties dispute with the record label, the group broke up.

They reformed in 1970 with Villari the only remaining original member. Joining Villari was Ron Lapinsky (aka Ron Anthony) and Bob Falcone, both of whom performed with the original Regents group post recording and in various offshoots (eg The Runarounds). They were soon joined by guitarist and vocalist Jamie Bannon who remained with group throughout its lifetime as musical director. The group enjoyed success in personal appearances and toured extensively across the United States. They also made many television appearances. In 1988 they were selected as one of only four &quot;oldies&quot; groups to appear on the Grammy Awards Show. 

In 1995, &quot;Guy Villari and the Regents&quot; was formed, which included Tony Valitutto, Frank Civatillo and Tony Cacace making up the vocals, while Richard Rogers, Joel DeRuggiero and Sal DiCicco provided the instrumentation. Concurrently, Lapinsky, Falcone and Bannon and the long running Regents band continued as &quot;The Regents&quot; into the 21st century. This version of the group along with original member Chuck Fassert appeared on the TJ Lubinski PBS music series in 2007. Villari died in 2017. Ron Anthony Lapinsky died in 2021.

==Namesakes==
A group called The Regents released a gatefold album in 1964 (unusual for rock groups at the time). It was recorded live in Hollywood, California and titled &quot;Live at the AM/PM Discotheque&quot; (Capitol SKAO 2153).

Another band by the name of The Regents recorded the song &quot;7 Teen&quot; in 1979. It reached on the UK Singles Chart.

There was another band with the same name (1963–67) from Tacoma, Washington. They were part of the Pacific North West sound of the early 1960s.

And there was another 9th grade students band call Regents from Dearborn Township Michigan 1962 - They went on to change their name to &quot;Bobby Dayton and The Daytona&#x27;s&#x27; and played for the next two years in south east Michigan area - they were pretty popular - They played and was booked by all the DJ&#x27;s from CKLW and WKNR Keener Radio and their secret manager was Gary Steven&#x27;s number 1 DJ at WKNR.

<text>The National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA) is a private non-profit organization in the United States founded in 1979. Originally it was a fictional US government organization in the novels of author Clive Cussler. Cussler later created and, until his death in 2020, led the actual organization Yee which is dedicated to &quot;preserving our maritime heritage through the discovery, archaeological survey and conservation of shipwreck artifacts.” Additionally &quot;NUMA does not actively seek private funding. Most of the financial support for the projects comes from the royalties from Clive Cussler’s books.&quot;

==History==
Clive Cussler founded NUMA as a private non-profit organization in 1979, naming it after a fictional government agency in his series of Dirk Pitt novels. NUMA is involved in underwater archeology and survey.

=== NUMA expeditions ===
NUMA&#x27;s expeditions tend to focus on ships of American origin from the early 19th century to the early 20th century, especially on Union and Confederate ships of the American Civil War. NUMA has located or attempted to locate the following vessels and historical artifacts:

== The fictional NUMA ==
In the Dirk Pitt series of adventure novels by Clive Cussler that debuted in 1973 with &quot;The Mediterranean Caper&quot; novel, NUMA is a government organization. The fictional NUMA is devoted to oceanic exploration and investigation, and is the agency employing the main characters in the series of books. Its headquarters is a 30-story building located on the east bank of the Potomac River, overlooking the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. The agency comprises over five thousand employees and scientists that often work around the clock on expeditions. It is often referred to as a marine version of NASA or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an American scientific agency focused on the conditions of the oceans and the atmosphere, and has research vessels that conduct many missions that are similar to the actual NUMA. 
The fictional NUMA is headed by the character Admiral James Sandecker, with Rudi Gunn as second in command, although Dirk Pitt is eventually asked to take over when Sandecker pursues the vice-presidency.

Housed inside this headquarters is one of the world&#x27;s most advanced computer systems which contains almost every known piece of information, both current and ancient, about the sea. The computer center takes up the entire 10th floor but is in an &quot;open&quot; setting with a raised circular platform that uses a hologram to display an artificial intelligence designed by Hiram Yeager, named Max, at its center. There are no cubicles. Hiram Yeager designed, runs, and maintains the computer lab.

== &quot;The Sea Hunters&quot; ==
Cussler and NUMA have helped produce a television series on underwater exploration called &quot;The Sea Hunters&quot;, which chronicles the discovery and subsequent removal and conservation of the CSS &quot;H. L. Hunley&quot; in 1995. The show also features a number of other shipwrecks in various international locations, and on occasion the failure to find anything at all, such as their attempts to find the &quot;Holland III&quot; submarine.

The show features Cussler and James Delgado, who is also an author and executive director of the Vancouver Maritime Museum. The show gives an in-depth explanation of the story of the shipwreck NUMA is exploring, including information about the ship&#x27;s history and how it sank.

Two books titled &quot;The Sea Hunters&quot; were authored by Clive Cussler about NUMA&#x27;s explorations.

<doc id="431221" wikidata="Q1234157" url="?curid=431221" title="Robigalia">
<text>The Robigalia was a festival in ancient Roman religion held April 25, named for the god Robigus. Its main ritual was a dog sacrifice to protect grain fields from disease. Games (&quot;ludi&quot;) in the form of &quot;major and minor&quot; races were held. The Robigalia was one of several agricultural festivals in April to celebrate and vitalize the growing season, but the darker sacrificial elements of these occasions are also fraught with anxiety about crop failure and the dependence on divine favor to avert it.

==Description==
The Robigalia was held at the boundary of the Ager Romanus. Verrius Flaccus sites it in a grove (&quot;lucus&quot;) at the fifth milestone from Rome along the Via Claudia. The celebration included games (&quot;ludi&quot;) and a sacrificial offering of the blood and entrails of an unweaned puppy (&quot;catulus&quot;). Most animal sacrifice in the public religion of ancient Rome resulted in a communal meal and thus involved domestic animals whose flesh was a normal part of the Roman diet; the dog occurs as a victim most often in magic and private rites for Hecate and other chthonic deities, but was offered publicly at the Lupercalia and two other sacrifices pertaining to grain crops.

==Origin==

Like many other aspects of Roman law and religion, the institution of the Robigalia was attributed to the Sabine Numa Pompilius, in the eleventh year of his reign as the second king of Rome. The combined presence of Numa and the flamen Quirinalis, the high priest of Quirinus, the Sabine god of war who become identified with Mars, may suggest a Sabine origin.

The late Republican scholar Varro says that the Robigalia was named for the god Robigus, who as the numen or personification of agricultural disease could also prevent it. He was thus a potentially malignant deity to be propitiated, as Aulus Gellius notes. But the gender of this deity is elusive. The agricultural writer Columella gives the name in the feminine as Robigo, like the word used for a form of the disease of wheat rust, which has a reddish or reddish-brown color. Both &quot;Robigus&quot; and &quot;robigo&quot; are also found as &quot;Rubig-&quot; which, following the etymology-by-association of antiquity, was thought to be connected to the color red (&quot;ruber&quot;) as a form of or sympathetic magic. The color is thematic: the disease was red, the requisite puppies (or sometimes bitches) had a red coat, the red of blood recalls the distinctively Roman incarnation of Mars as both a god of agriculture and bloodshed.

William Warde Fowler, whose work on Roman festivals remains a standard reference, entertained the idea that Robigus is an &quot;indigitation&quot; of Mars, that is, a name to be used in a prayer formulary to fix the local action of the invoked god. In support of this idea, the priest who presided was the flamen Quirinalis, and the &quot;ludi&quot; were held for both Mars and Robigo. The flamen recited a prayer that Ovid quotes at length in the &quot;Fasti&quot;, his six-book calendar poem on Roman holidays which provides the most extended, though problematic, description of the day.

==Other observances==
Chariot races &quot;(ludi cursoribus)&quot; were held in honor of Mars and Robigo on this day. The races had two classes, &quot;major and minor,&quot; which may represent junior and senior divisions. In chariot racing, younger drivers seem to have gained experience with a two-horse chariot &quot;(biga)&quot; before graduating to a four-horse team &quot;(quadriga)&quot;.

Other horse and chariot races in honor of Mars occurred at the Equirria and before the sacrifice of the October Horse.

==Calendar context==

The &quot;Fasti Praenestini&quot; also record that on the same day the festival celebrated a particular class of sex workers: &quot;pimped-out boys,&quot; following the previous day&#x27;s recognition of &quot;meretrices&quot;, female prostitutes regarded as professionals of some standing.

Other April festivals related to farming were the Cerealia, or festival of Ceres, lasting for several days in mid-month; the Fordicidia on April 15, when a pregnant cow was sacrificed; the Parilia on April 21 to ensure healthy flocks; and the Vinalia, a wine festival on April 23. Varro considered these and the Robigalia, along with the Great Mother&#x27;s Megalensia late in the month, the &quot;original&quot; Roman holidays in April.

The Robigalia has been connected to the Christian feast of Rogation, which was concerned with purifying and blessing the parish and fields and which took the place of the Robigalia on April 25 of the Christian calendar. The Church Father Tertullian mocks the goddess Robigo as &quot;made up,&quot; a fiction.

<text>USS &quot;Runner&quot; (SS-275) was a , the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the runner, an amberfish inhabiting subtropical waters, so called for its rapid leaps from the water.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Runner&quot;″s keel was laid down on 8 December 1941 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 30 May 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Elise Curry Newton, wife of Admiral John H. Newton, then Commander, Cruisers, Scouting Force, and commissioned on 30 July 1942.

==Service history==
Following shakedown from New London, Connecticut, &quot;Runner&quot; departed the United States East Coast in late 1942, transited the Panama Canal, and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on 10 January 1943. She set out on her first war patrol on 18 January 1943, bound for a patrol area in the Pacific Ocean between Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and the Palau Islands. She claimed five Japanese cargo ships torpedoed during the patrol, but none was confirmed as being sunk. On 19 February 1943, she suffered damage from a near-miss by a bomb dropped from a Japanese patrol bomber while she was making the last attack of her patrol, on a cargo ship off Peleliu. The concussion knocked out her sound gear and the power supply for both periscope hoists. &quot;Runner&quot; made her escape by a deep dive, her crew made emergency repairs, and she returned to Pearl Harbor on 7 March 1943 for overhaul. For this patrol, Fenno received his third award of the Navy Cross.

&quot;Runner&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 1 April 1943 to begin her second patrol, 1 April to 6 May, Her primary mission was to lay a minefield off Pedro Blanco Rock. Successful in this mission, &quot;Runner&quot; proceeded to Hainan Strait off China. She torpedoed one cargo ship, and her crew heard the sound of a ship breaking up over her sound gear, but could not confirm a kill. It later was determined that in fact &quot;Runner&quot; had torpedoed and damaged the Imperial Japanese Army hospital ship &quot;Buenos Aires Maru&quot; on 24 April 1943. She concluded the patrol with her arrival at Midway Atoll on 6 May 1943.

On 27 May 1943 &quot;Runner&quot; departed Midway for her third war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the Kuril Islands chain and the waters off northern Japan. She was never heard from again.

&quot;Runner&quot; was declared overdue and presumed lost in July 1943. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 October 1943.

Captured Japanese records examined after World War II indicated that she sank the cargo ship &quot;Seinan Maru&quot; on 11 June 1943 in Tsugaru Strait off Hokkaidō and on 22 June 1943 was attacked and apparently damaged by Imperial Japanese Navy forces. She also was credited postwar with sinking the passenger-cargo ship &quot;Shinryu Maru&quot; on 26 June 1943 off the Kuril Islands, although the explosion that sank &quot;Shinryu Maru&quot; also has been dated as occurring on 29 June 1943 and attributed to unknown causes.

== Awards ==
&quot;Runner&quot; was awarded one battle star for World War II service.
