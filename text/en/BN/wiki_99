<text>Prunus spinosa, called blackthorn or sloe, is an Old World species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It is locally naturalized in parts of the New World.

The fruits are used to make sloe gin in Britain and patxaran in Basque Country. The wood is used to make walking sticks, including the Irish shillelagh.

==Description==

&quot;Prunus spinosa&quot; is a large deciduous shrub or small tree growing to tall, with blackish bark and dense, stiff, spiny branches. The leaves are oval, long and broad, with a serrated margin. The flowers are about in diameter, with five creamy-white petals; they are produced shortly before the leaves in early spring, and are hermaphroditic, and insect-pollinated. The fruit, called a &quot;sloe&quot;, is a drupe in diameter, black with a purple-blue waxy bloom, ripening in autumn and traditionally harvested – at least in the UK – in October or November, after the first frosts. Sloes are thin-fleshed, with a very strongly astringent flavour when fresh.

Blackthorn usually grows as a bush but can grow to become a tree to a height of 6 m. Its branches usually grow forming a tangle.

&quot;Prunus spinosa&quot; is frequently confused with the related &quot;P. cerasifera&quot; (cherry plum), particularly in early spring when the latter starts flowering somewhat earlier than &quot;P. spinosa&quot;. They can be distinguished by flower colour, pure white in &quot;P. spinosa&quot;, creamy white in &quot;P. cerasifera&quot;. In addition, the sepals are bent backwards in &quot;P. cerasifera&quot;, but not in &quot;P. spinosa&quot;. They can be distinguished in winter by the shrubbier habit with stiffer, wider-angled branches of &quot;P. spinosa&quot;; in summer by the relatively narrower leaves of &quot;P. spinosa&quot;, more than twice as long as broad; and in autumn by the colour of the fruit skin purplish black in &quot;P. spinosa&quot; and yellow or red in &quot;P. cerasifera&quot;.

&quot;Prunus spinosa&quot; has a tetraploid (2&quot;n&quot;=4&quot;x&quot;=32) set of chromosomes.

Like many other fruits with pits, the pit of the sloe contains trace amounts of hydrogen cyanide.

==Etymology==

The specific name &quot; is a Latin term indicating the pointed and thornlike spur shoots characteristic of this species. The common name &quot; is due to the thorny nature of the shrub, and possibly its very dark bark: it has a much darker bark than the white-thorn (hawthorn), to which it is contrasted.

The word commonly used for the fruit, &quot;&quot;, comes from Old English &#x27;, cognate with Old High German &#x27;, &#x27;, and Modern German &#x27;. Other cognate forms are Frisian and Middle Low German &#x27;, Middle Dutch &#x27;; Modern Dutch &#x27;; Modern Low German &#x27;/&#x27;, &#x27;; Danish &quot;&quot;.

The names related to &#x27;sloe&#x27; come from the common Germanic root &#x27;. Compare Old Slavic, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Ukrainian and Russian (&quot;sliva&quot;, Ukr. &quot;slyva&quot;), West Slavic / Polish &#x27;; plum of any species, including sloe &#x27;—root present in other Slavic languages, e.g. Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian &#x27; / .

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is native to Europe, western Asia, and locally in northwest Africa. It is also locally naturalized in Tasmania and eastern North America.

==Ecology==
The foliage is sometimes eaten by the larvae of Lepidoptera, including the small eggar moth, emperor moth, willow beauty, white-pinion spotted, common emerald, November moth, pale November moth, mottled pug, green pug, brimstone moth, feathered thorn, brown-tail, yellow-tail, short-cloaked moth, lesser yellow underwing, lesser broad-bordered yellow underwing, double square-spot, black hairstreak, brown hairstreak, hawthorn moth (&quot;Scythropia crataegella&quot;) and the case-bearer moth &quot;Coleophora anatipennella&quot;. Dead blackthorn wood provides food for the caterpillars of the concealer moth &quot;Esperia oliviella&quot;.

== Uses ==
The shrub, with its long, sharp thorns, is traditionally used in Britain and other parts of northern Europe to make a cattle-proof hedge.

The fruit is similar to a small damson or plum, suitable for preserves, but rather and for eating fresh unless it is picked after the first few days of autumn frost. This effect can be reproduced by freezing harvested sloes.

Since the plant is hardy, and grows in a wide range of conditions, it is used as a rootstock for many other species of plum, as well as some other fruit species.

=== Flavoring ===
The juice is used in the manufacture of fake port wine, and it was used as an adulterant to impart roughness to genuine port, into the 20th century. In rural Britain a liqueur, sloe gin, is made by infusing gin with sloes and sugar; vodka can also be infused with sloes. Similarly, in Northern Greece, they make a blackthorn liqueur by infusing tsipouro with the fruit and adding sugar.

In Navarre, Spain, a popular liqueur called &quot;&quot; is made with sloes. In France a liqueur called &quot;troussepinette&quot;, or just or &quot;épinette&quot;, is made from the young shoots in spring (rather than from fruits in autumn). (&quot;Vin d&#x27;épine&quot;, likewise, is an infusion of early shoots of blackthorn macerated with sugar in wine.) In Italy, the infusion of spirit with the fruits and sugar produces a liqueur called &quot;bargnolino&quot; (sometimes &quot;prunella&quot;). In France, &quot;eau de vie de prunelle[s]&quot; is distilled from fermented sloes in regions such as the Alsace. Wine made from fermented sloes is made in Britain, and in Germany and other central European countries. It is also sometimes used in the brewing of lambic beer in Belgium.

=== Culinary ===
Sloes can also be made into jam, chutney, and used in fruit pies. Sloes preserved in vinegar are similar in taste to Japanese &quot;umeboshi&quot;. The juice of the fruits dyes linen a reddish colour that washes out to a durable pale blue.

The leaves resemble tea leaves, and were used as an adulterant of tea.

The fruit stones have been found in Swiss lake dwellings. Early human use of sloes as food is evidenced in the case of a 5,300-year-old human mummy (nick-named Ötzi), discovered in the Ötztal Alps along the Austrian-Italian border in 1991: a sloe was found near the remains; evidently the man intended to eat it before he died.

=== Wood ===
Blackthorn makes an excellent fire wood that burns slowly with a good heat and little smoke. The wood takes a fine polish and is used for tool handles and canes. Straight blackthorn stems have traditionally been made into walking sticks or clubs (known in Ireland as a shillelagh). In the British Army, blackthorn sticks are carried by commissioned officers of the Royal Irish Regiment; this is a tradition also in Irish regiments in some Commonwealth countries.

=== Inks ===
Rashi, a Talmudist and Tanakh commentator of the High Middle Ages, writes that the sap (or gum) of &quot;P. spinosa&quot; (which he refers to as the ) was used as an ingredient in the making of some inks used for manuscripts.

A &quot;sloe-thorn worm&quot; used as fishing bait is mentioned in the 15th-century work, &quot;The Treatyse of Fishing with an Angle&quot;.

== In culture ==
In Middle English, &quot;slō&quot; has been used to denote something of trifling value.

The expression &quot;sloe-black eyes&quot; for a person with dark eyes comes from the fruit, is first attested in William Somervile&#x27;s 1735 poem &quot;The Chace&quot;. &quot;,&quot; meanwhile, is first attested in A. J. Wilson&#x27;s 1867 novel &quot;Vashti&quot;.

The flowering of the blackthorn may have been associated with the ancient Celtic celebration of Imbolc, traditionally celebrated on February 1 in Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man.

The name of the dark-coloured cloth prunella was derived from the French word , meaning sloe.

<doc id="445920" wikidata="Q643585" url="?curid=445920" title="Earl of Dundonald">
<text>Earl of Dundonald is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1669 for the Scottish soldier and politician William Cochrane, 1st Lord Cochrane of Dundonald, along with the subsidiary title of Lord Cochrane of Paisley and Ochiltree, with remainder to his heirs male, failing which to his heirs female without division who should bear or assume the name of Cochrane, and in failure thereof to his heirs general. In 1647, he had already been created Lord Cochrane of Dundonald in the Peerage of Scotland, with remainder to the heirs male of his body.

==History==
The first Earl was succeeded by his grandson John Cochrane, the second Earl (died 1690). He was the son of William Cochrane, Lord Cochrane (died 1679), eldest son of the 1st Earl. The 2nd Earl was a member of the Scottish Privy Council. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son William Cochrane, the third Earl (died 1705). He died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother John Cochrane, the fourth Earl (died 1720). He sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1713 to 1715. When he died the titles passed to his son William Cochrane, the fifth Earl (died 1725). He died unmarried at the age of sixteen.

On his death the line of the 2nd Earl failed and the titles passed to his first cousin once removed, Thomas Cochrane, the sixth Earl (died 1737). He was the son of William Cochrane (died 1717), second son of the aforementioned William Cochrane, Lord Cochrane (died 1679), eldest son of the 1st Earl. He was succeeded by his son William Cochrane, the seventh Earl (died 1758). He fought in the Seven Years&#x27; War and was killed at the Battle of Louisbourg on 9 July 1758.

On the death of the 7th Earl this line of the family also failed and the titles were inherited by his second cousin once removed, Thomas Cochrane, the eighth Earl (died 1778). He was the grandson of Colonel Sir John Cochrane (died 1707), second son of the 1st Earl. Before he became the 8th Earl, he sat as Member of Parliament (Whig) for Renfrewshire between 1722 and 1727. After his death, the titles passed to his son Archibald Cochrane, the ninth Earl (died 1831).

The 9th Earl was a scientist and inventor; among his inventions was the first industrial technique for extracting coal tar. Besides the direct applications of coal tar, the gaseous byproducts of Earl Dundonald&#x27;s tar works were later used by engineer William Murdoch to invent gas lighting in the 1790s. However, none of the Earl&#x27;s inventions brought him much money—for instance, the Navy, the most likely customer for the coal tar, had put off buying it in quantity until after the patent on it had expired—and having lost the family estates (he had used them as collateral for the tar works), he died deep in debt in a slum in Paris in 1831. The titles then passed to his son Thomas Cochrane, the tenth Earl (died 1860).

The 10th Earl was a noted naval commander and fought in the Napoleonic Wars. Before inheriting the peerage titles, he also sat as a Member of Parliament. However, he was later imprisoned on a false charge of fraud and expelled from the Navy and Parliament. After release he went abroad and commanded the Chilean, Peruvian, Brazilian and Greek navies with distinction. In 1824, the 10th Earl was created Marquess of Maranhão (&quot;Marquês do Maranhão&quot;) in the Peerage of Brazil, by Emperor Pedro I. He was also awarded the accompanying coat of arms. The titles of nobility in Brazil were not hereditary. In 1832 he was reinstated in the Royal Navy and received a royal pardon.He was succeeded by his son Thomas Cochrane, the eleventh Earl (died 1885).

The 11th Earl sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer from 1879 to 1885. On his death the titles passed to his eldest son Douglas Cochrane, the twelfth Earl (died 1935). He was commissioned in the Life Guards, a Lieutenant-General in the British Army, a Scottish Representative Peer from 1886 to 1922, and a General Officer Commanding the Canadian Forces, whence he left us with the admonition:

He married Winifred Bamford-Hesketh. When he died the titles passed to his son Thomas Hesketh Cochrane, the thirteenth Earl (died 1958).

He was a Scottish Representative Peer in the House of Lords from 1941 to 1955. He never married and was succeeded by his nephew Iain Douglas Cochrane, the fourteenth Earl (died 1986). He was the son of Douglas Robert Hesketh Roger Cochrane, second son of the twelfth Earl. The 14th Earl was a major in the Black Watch. the titles are held by his only son Ian Alexander Cochrane, the fifteenth Earl, who succeeded in 1986.

Several other members of the Cochrane family have also gained distinction: Sir Alexander Cochrane, sixth son of the 8th Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. His son Sir Thomas John Cochrane was also a naval commander and served as Governor of Newfoundland. His son Alexander Cochrane-Baillie was a Conservative politician and was created Baron Lamington in 1880 (see this title for more information). William Francis Dundonald Cochrane (1847–1927), a brigadier-general in the Army, was the son of William Marshall Cochrane, a colonel in the Army, son of Major the William Erskine Cochrane, third son of the ninth Earl. Archibald Cochrane, fourth son of the 9th Earl, was a captain in the Royal Navy. His grandson Basil Edward Cochrane was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy. He was the father of Archibald Cochrane (1847–1952) and Sir Edward Owen Cochrane (1881–1972), both rear-admirals in the Royal Navy. John Dundas Cochrane, another younger son of the ninth Earl, was a traveller and explorer. Thomas Cochrane, second son of the 11th Earl, was a politician and was created Baron Cochrane of Cults in 1919 (see this title for more information).

The earldom is named after Dundonald, South Ayrshire (see Dundonald Castle).

The Earl of Dundonald is the Scottish clan chief of Clan Cochrane.

The family seats are Lochnell Castle, near Oban, Argyll and Bute, and Beacon Hall, near Cranbrook, Kent.

<text>The National Anthem of Pakistan, also known by its incipit &quot;The Sacred Land&quot;, is the national anthem of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and formerly the Dominion of Pakistan. First composed by Ahmad G. Chagla in 1949, lyrics in Persified Urdu were later written by Hafeez Jalandhari in 1952. It was broadcast publicly for the first time on Radio Pakistan on 13 August 1954, sung by Jalandhari himself and officially adopted on 16 August 1954 by the Interior Ministry of the Government of Pakistan.

After officially being adopted, it was recorded in the same year by eleven major singers of Pakistan including Ahmad Rushdi, Kaukab Jahan, Rasheeda Begum, Najam Ara, Naseema Shaheen, Zawar Hussain, Akhtar Abbas, Ghulam Dastagir, Anwar Zaheer, and Akhtar Wasi Ali.

==History==

In early 1948, A. R. Ghani, a Muslim from South Africa&#x27;s Transvaal, offered two prizes of five thousand rupees each for the poet and composer of a new national anthem for the newly independent state of Pakistan. The prizes were announced through a government press advertisement published in June 1948. In December 1948, the Government of Pakistan established the National Anthem Committee (NAC) with the task of coming up with the composition and lyrics for the official national anthem of Pakistan. The NAC was initially chaired by the Information Secretary, Sheikh Muhammad Ikram, and its members included several politicians, poets and musicians, including Abdur Rab Nishtar, Ahmad G. Chagla and Hafeez Jalandhari. The NAC encountered early difficulties in finding suitable music and lyrics.

When President Sukarno of Indonesia became the first foreign head of state to visit Pakistan on 30 January 1950, there was no Pakistani national anthem to be played. In 1950, the impending state visit of the Shah of Iran added urgency to the matter and resulted in the government of Pakistan asking the NAC to submit a state anthem without further delay. The NAC chairman, then Federal Minister for Education, Fazlur Rahman, asked several poets and composers to write lyrics but none of the submitted works were deemed suitable. The NAC also examined several different tunes and eventually selected the one presented by Ahmed G. Chagla and submitted it for formal approval. On 21 August 1950, the Government of Pakistan adopted Chagla&#x27;s tune for the national anthem.

The national anthem, without lyrics, was performed for the first time for a foreign head of state on the state visit of the Shah of Iran to Pakistan in Karachi on 1 March 1950 by a Pakistan Navy band.

It was later played for Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan during his official visit to the United States on 3 May 1950. It was played before the NAC on 10 August 1950. Official recognition to the national anthem, however, was not given until August 1954. The NAC distributed records of the composed tune amongst prominent poets, who responded by writing and submitting several hundred songs for evaluation by the NAC. Eventually, the lyrics written by Hafeez Jalandhari were approved and the new national anthem was broadcast publicly for the first time on Radio Pakistan on 13 August 1954, sung by Hafeez Jalandhari himself. Official approval was announced by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on 16 August 1954. The composer, Ahmed G. Chagla, died in 1953, before the new national anthem was officially adopted. In 1955, there was a performance of the national anthem involving 11 major singers of Pakistan, including Ahmad Rushdi, Kaukab Jahan, Rasheeda Begum, Najam Ara, Naseema Shaheen, Zawar Hussain, Akhtar Abbas, Ghulam Dastagir, Anwar Zaheer and Akhtar Wasi Ali.

In 2021, then Interior Minister Fawad Chaudhry announced that the national anthem will be re-recorded with better quality. The project was completed in 2022 during Shehbaz Sharif’s tenure. 155 singers, 48 musicians and 6 bandmasters participated in the re-recording, it was released on 14 August, 2022.

==Music==
The national anthem is a rendering of a three-stanza composition with a tune based on eastern music but arranged in such a manner that it can be easily played by foreign bands.

The music, composed by the Pakistani musician and composer Ahmad G. Chagla in 1949, reflects his background in both eastern and western music. Typically twenty-one musical instruments and thirty-eight different tones are used to play the national anthem, the duration of which is usually around 80 seconds.

==Lyrics==
The lyrics are in classical Urdu, written by the Pakistani Urdu-language poet Hafeez Jalandhari in 1952. No verse in the three stanzas is repeated. The lyrics have heavy Persian poetic vocabulary, and the only words derived from Sanskrit are &quot;ka&quot; ( &#x27;of&#x27;), and &quot;tu&quot; ( &#x27;thou&#x27;).

<text>Acumen Nation was an American industrial rock/metal band from Chicago, Illinois.

==History==
===Early career===
Formed in 1988 as Acumen by Jason Novak and Ethan Novak, the band released several cassette demos before self-releasing the CD demo &quot;Transmissions from Eville&quot; in 1994. Along with bassist Greg Lopez, they put the record out themselves under the name Robot Records. During shows for this period, the band added Jamie Duffy as a guitarist/engineer, and shortly afterwards the four-piece band was noticed by independent industrial label Fifth Colvmn Records, who signed the band and reissued &quot;Transmissions from Eville&quot; worldwide.

The band subsequently embarked on national tours with The Clay People and 16 Volt, before heading back to Chicago Trax Studios to record their follow-up, entitled &quot;Territory=Universe&quot;, with a denser multi-layered sound than the previous record. Acumen was invited to join another national tour with industrial rock pioneers Chemlab, as well as shorter stints supporting industrial rock veterans KMFDM and Monster Voodoo Machine.

Although the peak of the Industrial rock scene in Chicago had passed by the time Acumen emerged as a national act, Acumen were able to establish themselves on the circuit through continuous touring and work on a number of different projects. The Iron Lung Corp. was a band composed of Acumen and The Clay People from Albany, New York. Their first record &quot;Big Shiny Spears&quot; (1996) featured covers of Nitzer Ebb&#x27;s hits &quot;Join in the Chant&quot; and &quot;Murderous&quot;.

===Name dispute===
In 1997, the band were forced to change their name due to a legal dispute with a preexisting progressive rock band also called Acumen. The band split their project into two halves—the drum and bass influenced DJ? Acucrack, and the more traditional rock format of Acumen Nation. Tours for both projects followed. In 1998, Greg Lopez left the band to pursue other interests, and was replaced by Eric Alvarez. The four recorded 2000&#x27;s Strike 4. Alvarez left the band before the record was released and was replaced by Eliot Engelman.

===Later career===
In 2000, Jason Novak and Jamie Duffy launched their own record label, CrackNation Records, through which all future Acumen-related material would be released. In 2005, the label released Cyanotic&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Transhuman&quot;.

The end of 2001 saw the release of &quot;Live Farewell 2001&quot;, which was to signal a hiatus for the band, as the recording was the final performance featuring Ethan Novak, who left to form the band Cordy. He was replaced in the lineup by Dan Brill.

Eliot Engelman left following the release of &quot;Anticore&quot; in 2006 and the subsequent tour with Front Line Assembly in mid-2007, although the band maintained for some time that he had not left, before they finally admitted it. Ethan Novak returned to play guitar during the &quot;PsychoTransHumanoid&quot; 2007 and 2008 tours of the east and west coasts with Cyanotic, promoting the simultaneous release of Acumen Nation&#x27;s &quot;Psycho the Rapist&quot;, DJ? Acucrack&#x27;s &quot;Humanoids from the Deep&quot;, and Cyanotic&#x27;s &quot;Transhuman 2.0&quot;.

On June 21, 2012, Acumen Nation guitarist Jamie Duffy died due to an overdose of sleeping pills, which was made public via his personal Twitter account early that morning. The tweet &quot;this is how the end begins...&quot; along with a link to a photo of a plate with three white bottles of sleeping pills and a plate full of the bright blue pills themselves. The photo was later removed, but the tweet remained.

===Cold Waves: The Jamie Duffy Memorial Concert===
On July 6, 2012, a memorial concert was announced entitled &quot;Cold Waves: The Jamie Duffy Memorial Concert&quot;, to be held at Chicago&#x27;s Bottom Lounge on September 7, 2012. Artists appearing at the event included Paul Barker, Chris Connelly, Jared Louche, Martin Atkins, Steven Seibold, Jim Marcus, Jason Novak, and Eric Powell, performing tracks by Revco/Revolting Cocks, Chemlab, 16volt, Acumen Nation, Damage Manual, Hate Dept, The Clay People, and Go Fight!/Die Warzau. Additional artists to perform were Czar, Cyanotic, , and The Final Cut, with DJ sets by Zoltar, host of the satellite radio show &quot;Subterranean&quot; and a former Q101 Chicago and WXRT Chicago radio host. 

The concert also noted that Duffy had worked at many Chicago venues including The House of Blues, The Cubby Bear, The Abbey Pub and The Cabaret Metro/Metro Chicago as stage manager and sound engineer, provided engineering and technical support at Chicago Trax recording studios, and had contributed to releases on many different larger and independent record labels including 21st Circuitry, Bit Riot Records, BMG/RCA/D-Tribe Records, Cargo Music/Re-constriction Records, Conscience Records, Cracknation Records, Crash Music Inc., E-Magine Records, Failure To Communicate Records/FTC Records, Fifth Colvmn Records, Glitch Mode Recordings, Underground, Inc., Island/Def Jam Records, Katharsis Records, Metropolis Records, MOGworld Records, Tinman Records, TVT Records, Warner Bros.

<doc id="445926" wikidata="Q1277262" url="?curid=445926" title="Earl of Dunmore">
<text>Earl of Dunmore is a title in the Peerage of Scotland.

The title Earl of Dunmore was created in 1686 for Lord Charles Murray, son of John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl. The title passed down through generations, with various earls serving in the House of Lords as Scottish Representative Peers and holding other political positions. The 4th Earl was a colonial governor in New York, Virginia, and the Bahamas, while the 5th Earl bought the Estate of Harris in 1834. The 7th Earl served under Benjamin Disraeli and was the Lord Lieutenant of Stirlingshire. The 8th Earl received the Victoria Cross and held political office as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms. The barony of Dunmore became extinct after the 9th Earl&#x27;s death in 1980, but the other titles passed to his distant relatives in Tasmania, Australia. The family seat was located at Amhuinnsuidhe Castle on the Isle of Harris and Dunmore Tower near Falkirk.

==History==
The title was created in 1686 for Lord Charles Murray, second son of John Murray, 1st Marquess of Atholl. He was made Lord Murray of Blair, Moulin and Tillimet (or Tullimet) and Viscount of Fincastle at the same time, also in the Peerage of Scotland. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was a General in the Army and sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1713 to 1715 and from 1727 to 1752. His younger brother, William Murray, later to become the third Earl, was involved in the Jacobite rising of 1745 and was tried for high treason in 1746. Murray pleaded guilty but received a pardon from King George II and succeeded to the peerages when his brother died unmarried six years later.

The third Earl was succeeded by his son. The fourth Earl was a Scottish Representative Peer in the House of Lords from 1761 to 1774 and from 1776 to 1790 and served as colonial governor of New York, Virginia and the Bahamas. His tenure as governor of the New York and Virginia colonies was to end with the start of the American Revolution. Lord Dunmore&#x27;s eldest son, the fifth Earl, briefly represented Liskeard in the House of Commons. In 1831 he was created Baron Dunmore, of Dunmore in the Forest of Athole in the County of Perth, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him and his descendants a permanent seat in the House of Lords.

George Murray, 5th Earl of Dunmore, bought the Estate of Harris from Alexander Norman Macleod for £60,000 in 1834. In 1839, the people of South Harris were ejected from their homes by armed soldiers and a posse of Glasgow policemen acting on orders from the government, at the behest of the Earl of Dunmore. The 6th Earl of Dunmore, Alexander Edward Murray, had inherited Harris upon the death of his father on 11 November 1836 and would in turn be succeeded by his son, Charles Adolphus, following the 6th Earl&#x27;s death on 14 July 1845. Thus the 6th Earl was about halfway through his proprietorship of the island when he was providing a pound per person for those electing to leave.

The seventh Earl of Dunmore served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) in the second Conservative administration of Benjamin Disraeli and was also Lord Lieutenant of Stirlingshire. The 7th Earl relinquished ownership of the North Harris Estate to his bankers, in particular the Scott family. He was succeeded by his son, the eighth Earl. He was a soldier and was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1897. Lord Dunmore later held political office as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms (government chief whip in the House of Lords). On the death in 1980 of his grandson, the ninth Earl, the line of the fifth Earl failed and the barony of Dunmore became extinct.

The late Earl was succeeded by his distant relative (his fourth cousin once removed), the tenth Earl. He was the great-great-grandson of the Hon. Alexander Murray, second son of the fourth Earl, and lived in Tasmania, Australia. the titles are held by his nephew, the twelfth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1995. He also lives in Tasmania, Australia and is a well respected Freemason.

As a male-line descendant of the first Marquess of Atholl he is also in remainder to this peerage and its subsidiary titles and by special remainder to the Dukedom, which are now held by his kinsman Bruce Murray, 12th Duke of Atholl.

The family seat was Amhuinnsuidhe Castle, on the Isle of Harris and Dunmore Tower, near Airth, Falkirk.

<doc id="445928" wikidata="Q386359" url="?curid=445928" title="Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples">
<text>The Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (CEP; ) was a congregation of the Roman Curia of the Catholic Church in Rome, responsible for missionary work and related activities. It is also known by its former title, the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (), or simply the Propaganda Fide. On 5 June 2022, it was merged with the Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization into the Dicastery for Evangelization.

It was responsible for Latin Church pre-diocesan missionary jurisdictions: missions sui iuris, apostolic prefectures (neither entitled to a titular bishop) and apostolic vicariates. Eastern Catholic equivalents like apostolic exarchate are the responsibility of the Dicastery for the Eastern Churches. However many former missionary jurisdictions - mainly in the Third World - remain, after promotion to diocese of (Metropolitan) Archdiocese, under the Propaganda Fide instead of the normally competent Congregation for Bishops, notably in countries/regions where the Catholic church is too poor/small (as in most African countries) to aspire self-sufficiency and/or local authorities hostile to Catholic/Christian/any (organized) faith.

It was founded by Pope Gregory XV in 1622 to arrange missionary work on behalf of the various religious institutions, and in 1627 Pope Urban VIII established within it a training college for missionaries, the Pontificio Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide. When Pope Paul VI reorganized and adjusted the tasks of the Roman Curia with the publication of &quot;Regimini Ecclesiae Universae&quot; 15 August 1967, the name of the congregation was changed to the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples.

The early congregation was established in the Palazzo Ferratini, donated by Spanish cleric Juan Bautista Vives, to the south of the Piazza di Spagna. Two of the foremost artistic figures of Baroque Rome were involved in the development of the architectural complex; the sculptor and architect Gianlorenzo Bernini and the architect Francesco Borromini.

The last Prefect of the Congregation was Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle from December 2019 until June 2022. The secretary was Archbishop Protase Rugambwa. The adjunct secretary and President of the Pontifical Mission Societies was Archbishop Giampietro Del Toso The under-secretary was Father Ryszard Szmydki, O.M.I.

== History ==
Founded in 1622 by Pope Gregory XV with the bull &quot;Inscrutabili Divinae&quot;, the body was charged with fostering the spread of Catholicism and with the regulation of Catholic ecclesiastical affairs in non-Catholic countries. The intrinsic importance of its duties and the extraordinary extent of its authority and of the territory under its jurisdiction caused the Cardinal Prefect of Propaganda to be known as the &quot;red pope&quot;.

There had already been a less formally instituted committee of cardinals concerned with &quot;propaganda fide&quot; since the time of Pope Gregory XIII (1572–1585). They were especially charged with promoting the union with Rome of the long-established Eastern Christian communities: Slavs, Greeks, Syrians, Egyptians, and Abyssinians. This was the traditional direction for the evangelization efforts of the Catholic Church. Catechisms were printed in many languages and seminarians sent to places as far as Malabar. The most concrete result was the union with Rome of the Ruthenian Catholic communion, most concentrated in modern-day Ukraine and Belarus; the union was formalized at Brest in 1596.

The death of Pope Gregory XV the following year did not interrupt the organization, because Cardinal Barberini, one of the original thirteen members of the congregation, became the next pope as Urban VIII (1623–1644). Under Urban VIII, a central seminary, the &quot;Collegium Urbanum&quot;, was established to train missionaries. The Congregation also operated &quot;Polyglotta&quot;, a printing press in Rome, printing catechisms in many languages. Their procurators were especially active in China from 1705, moving between Macau and Canton before finally settling in Hong Kong in 1842.

In strongly Protestant areas, the Congregation&#x27;s activities were considered subversive: the first missionary to be killed was in Grisons, Switzerland, in April 1622, before the papal bull authorizing its creation had been disseminated. In Ireland after Catholic emancipation (1829) while the established church was still the Anglican Church of Ireland, the Catholic Church in Ireland came under the control of the Congregation in 1833, and soon reformed itself with a devotional revolution under Cardinal Cullen. 

These &quot;Cardinals in General Congregation&quot; met weekly, keeping their records in Latin until 1657, then in Italian. The minutes are available in microfilm (filling 84 reels) at large libraries. In the course of their work, the &quot;Propaganda fide&quot; missionaries accumulated the objects now in the Vatican Museum&#x27;s Ethnological Missionary Museum.

The Holy See removed the United States from the jurisdiction of Propaganda Fide as mission territory in 1908, along with England, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Canada.

With the publication of Pope Paul VI&#x27;s &quot;Regimini Ecclesiae Universae&quot; on 15 August 1967, the Roman Curia was reorganized and the name of the congregation was changed to the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples.

In 2014 Sr. Luzia Premoli, superior general of the Combonian Missionary Sisters, was appointed a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, the first woman to be appointed a member of a Roman curial congregation.

== Purposes ==
The Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith was established in 1622 due to the realization that the governmental structure of the episcopal structure and the decretal law was not possible. Episcopal structure and the Decretal law was government as described in the New Testament. In this new structure, missionaries would be given orders from Rome, and administrative power would be traded over to those who were titled bishops. The Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith was left in charge to give faculties to the aforementioned bishops in addition to perfects, who were similar to bishops without the notoriety.

;A congregation for the propagation of the faith

On January 6, 1622 Gregory XV erected the Congregation de Propaganda Fide as central and supreme organ for the propagation of the faith to aim at the union of the Orthodox and Protestant Churches and to promote and organize the mission among non-Christians. The goal of this was to regulate missionary work through structural accountability. According to Fernando Cardinal Filoni, &quot;The Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples has jurisdiction over 186 archdioceses, 785 dioceses, 82 vicariates apostolic, 39 prefectures apostolic, 4 apostolic administrations, 6 missiones sui iuris, 1 territorial abbacy, and 6 military ordinariates,&quot; in today&#x27;s modern organization. The Congregation has jurisdiction over missions in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and North America. The church overall has many statues and regulations in place for the overseen congregations so that they may determine the appropriate way to hold mass, perform the sacraments and spread the gospel in difficult or challenging settings.

;Procurement of financial support

During Clement VIII&#x27;s reign, in the sixteenth century, the second purpose for the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (CPF) was for the organization to procure financial support for their missions – both in domestic and international territory. Each territory would have procurators, where these individuals would ensure that mail, funds, and merchandise could be sent via any route, and Swedish, Danish, and English ships were preferred for their reliability. Most of CPF missions were run and funded by religious orders which were affiliated with this organization, but they were financially independent, like the French MEP and Italian Barnabites; and on the other hand, other income came from land properties, real estate, and commercial rentals in Rome and the Pontifical States, and also inheritance and donations from benefactors – from within Italy and abroad. Currently, these efforts are the ways in which CPF obtains funds for the mission, however, the World Mission Sunday is the main resource of collection for financial support for this organization.

;The establishment of a seminary for the training of missionaries

The Pontificio Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide (Pontifical Urban College for the Propagation of the Faith) was established in 1627 by Pope Urban VIII for the purpose of training missionaries. It was located at the former Palazzo Ferratini at the Piazza di Spagna. The college prepared students for holy orders, after which they were to return to their homelands as missionaries. In 1641 Urban VIII placed it directly under the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith.

In 1931 the new Pontifical Urban University opened on the Janiculum. The Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide relocated from the Palazzo di Propaganda Fide to the renovated former hospital of Santa Maria della Pietà, also on the Janiculum, and serves as a residence for seminarians studying at the Urbania. 

;The establishment of a printing press to provide literature for missions
The congregation needed to mass-produce literature for their missions so they established their own printing press four years after their founding in 1626 (New Catholic Encyclopedia 11, 751). The press contributed it literature to the Collegium Urbanum as well as to missionaries traveling cross-country to territories that the Vatican entrusted them. The press was originally called Polyglotta, and was intended to print Catholic literature in the various native languages that CPF missionaries would encounter. The press faced significant challenges when most of the equipment and machinery they used to print books was stolen and destroyed during the invasion of Rome in the Napoleonic Wars, 1809 (New Catholic Encyclopedia 11, 751). Later in 1926, the Polyglotta Press was absorbed by the Vatican Printing Press under the leadership of Pope Pius X.

==Palazzo di Propaganda Fide==

The Congregation was originally housed in a small palace, the Palazzo Ferratini, donated by the Spanish priest Vives. The building is located in the Rione Colonna, at the southern end of Piazza di Spagna. The architectural complex of the Propaganda Fide was developed in the triangular urban block between the Via Due Macelli and the Via del Collegio di Propaganda Fide, two streets which diverged from the piazza.

In 1634 a small oval chapel was built according to designs by Bernini. In 1642, Father Valerio, with Bernini, redesigned the façade to the Piazza di Spagna, and the development was continued along the Via Due Macelli by Gaspare de&#x27;Vecchio from 1639–1645.

In 1648, Borromini took over and made various proposals that included demolishing Bernini&#x27;s chapel, which must have been particularly galling for the latter as he could see the building from his house on Via Mercede. The Re Magi chapel, dedicated to the Three Kings, has a plan with four side chapels and galleries above. The wall pilasters are continued in the vault as ribs that criss-cross and unite the space, unlike his design at the Oratory of Philip Neri &quot;Oratorio dei Filippini&quot; where the ribs are interrupted by the oval fresco at the centre of the vault. The criss-cross arrangement in the Re Magi Chapel is such that an octagon is formed at the centre, embellished with a Dove of the Holy Spirit bathed in golden rays.

The central door leads into the courtyard where Borromini intended a curved arcade but this was not built. Only the left hand side of the façade relates to the chapel and the right to the stair and entrance to the College.

Other parts of the College have further minor works by Borromini.

<doc id="445933" wikidata="Q1964398" url="?curid=445933" title="Misuse of Drugs Act 1971">
<text>The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (c. 38) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It represents action in line with treaty commitments under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.

Offences under the act include:
* Possession of a controlled drug unlawfully
* Possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply it
* Supplying or offering to supply a controlled drug (even where no charge is made for the drug)
* Allowing premises you occupy or manage to be used unlawfully for the purpose of producing or supplying controlled drugs

The act establishes the Home Secretary as the principal authority in a drug licensing system. Therefore, for example, various opiates are available legally as prescription-only medicines, and cannabis (hemp) may be grown under licence for &#x27;industrial purposes&#x27;. The  (SI 2001/3998), created under the 1971 Act, are about licensing of production, possession and supply of substances classified under the act.

The act creates three classes of controlled substances, A, B, and C, and ranges of penalties for illegal or unlicensed possession and possession with intent to supply are graded differently within each class. The lists of substances within each class can be amended by Order in Council, so the Home Secretary can list new drugs and upgrade, downgrade or delist previously controlled drugs with less of the bureaucracy and delay associated with passing an act through both Houses of Parliament.

Critics of the act such as David Nutt say that its classification is not based on how harmful or addictive the substances are, and that it is unscientific to omit substances like tobacco and alcohol.

==Provisions==

===Section 37 – Interpretation===
Section 37(5) became spent on the repeal of sections 8 to 10 of the Pharmacy and Poisons Act 1933. It was repealed by Group 7 of Part 17 of Schedule 1 to the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 2004.

== List of controlled drugs ==
These drugs are known in the UK as &quot;controlled drug&quot;, because this is the term by which the act itself refers to them. In more general terms, however, many of these drugs are also controlled by the Medicines Act 1968, there are many other drugs which are controlled by the Medicines Act but not by the Misuse of Drugs Act, and some other drugs (alcohol, for example) are controlled by other laws. 

The act sets out four separate categories: Class A, Class B, Class C and temporary class drugs. Substances may be removed and added to different parts of the schedule by statutory instrument, provided a report of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs has been commissioned and has reached a conclusion, although the Secretary of State is not bound by the council&#x27;s findings.

*Class A includes cocaine, heroin, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, MDMA (&quot;ecstasy&quot;), methamphetamine, LSD, DMT, mescaline extract, and psilocybin/psilocin (magic mushrooms).
*Class B includes cannabis, ketamine, amphetamine, codeine, methcathinone, barbiturates, mephedrone, methaqualone, methylphenidate, GHB, GBL, and cathinone. Any class B drug that is prepared for injections becomes a class A substance.
*Class C includes benzodiazepines, pregabalin, and most other non-barbiturate tranquillisers; tramadol gabapentin; anabolic steroids, nitrous oxide, and khat
*All other psychoactive drugs except alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco (or other nicotine preparations) are controlled under the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 and Medicines Act 1968.

In reality the potential harm has little bearing on the class, which has led to dissatisfaction with drug laws.

Substances may be removed and added to different parts of the schedule by statutory instrument, provided a report of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs has been commissioned and has reached a conclusion, although the Secretary of State is not bound by the council&#x27;s findings. This list has in practice been modified a great number of times, sometimes removing substances, but more commonly adding some; for example, many benzodiazepines became Class C drugs in 1985, and many cathinones became Class B drugs in 2010.

=== Derivatives and analogues ===
The act contains several references to &quot;derivatives&quot; of compounds but the extent of this term is not fully clarified. Where unspecified it is thought to indicate derivatives which can be made from the specified compound in a single synthetic step, although such a definition would indicate that alkyllysergamide analogues would be uncontrolled. Where the derivatives are specified to be &quot;structural derivatives&quot; there is precedent that the statute applies whenever the structure could be converted to the &quot;specified&quot; derivatives in any number of synthetic steps.

== Penalties ==
The penalties for drug offences depend on the class of drug involved. These penalties are enforced against those who do not have a valid prescription or licence to possess the drug in question. Thus, it is not illegal for someone to possess heroin, a Class A drug, so long as it was administered to them legally (by prescription).

Class A drugs attract the highest penalty, and imprisonment is both &quot;proper and expedient&quot;. The maximum penalties possible are as follows:

== International cooperation ==

The act makes it a crime to assist in, incite, or induce, the commission of an offence, outside the UK, against another nation&#x27;s corresponding law on drugs. A corresponding law is defined as another country&#x27;s law &quot;providing for the control and regulation in that country of the production, supply, use, export and import of drugs and other substances in accordance with the provisions of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs&quot; or another drug control treaty to which the UK and the other country are parties. An example might be lending money to a United States drug dealer for the purpose of violating that country&#x27;s Controlled Substances Act.

== History ==
The Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act 1964 controlled amphetamines in the United Kingdom in advance of international agreements and was later used to control LSD.

Before 1971, the UK had a relatively liberal drugs policy and it was not until United Nations influence had been brought to bear that controlling incidental drug activities was employed to effectively criminalise drugs use. It is noted that bar the smoking of opium and cannabis; Section 8, part d, under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 was not an offence (relating to the prosecution of the owner of a premises/building inside of which controlled drugs were being used). Section 8 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 was amended by Regulation 13 of Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1985 (SI 1985/2066) and Section 38 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. 
These amendments were however repealed in 2005 by Schedule 1 (part 6) of the Drugs Act 2005.

The Current Section 8 covers:
people knowingly allowing premises they own, manage, or have responsibility for, to be used by any other person for:

* administration or use of any controlled drug
* supply of any controlled drug
* the production or cultivation of controlled drugs, (such as growing cannabis, making crystal meth, preparing magic mushrooms).

== Criticism and controversy ==
Notable criticism of the act includes:
* &quot;Drug classification: making a hash of it?&quot;, Fifth Report of Session 2005–06, House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, which said that the present system of drug classification is based on historical assumptions, not scientific assessment.
* &quot;Development of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse&quot;, David Nutt, Leslie A. King, William Saulsbury, Colin Blakemore, &quot;The Lancet&quot;, 24 March 2007, said the act is &quot;not fit for purpose&quot; and &quot;the exclusion of alcohol and tobacco from the Misuse of Drugs Act is, from a scientific perspective, arbitrary.&quot;

The Transform Drug Policy Foundation offers rational criticism of the harms caused by the Government&#x27;s current prohibitionist drug policy. The Drug Equality Alliance (DEA) has launched legal actions against the UK Government&#x27;s partial and unequal administration of the Act&#x27;s discretionary powers, making particular reference to the arbitrary exclusion of alcohol and tobacco on the subjective grounds of historical and cultural precedents contrary to the Act&#x27;s policy and objects.

Following the release of the Cambridge Two – Ruth Wyner and John Brock – who had been convicted under Section 8 of the Act in 1999, a campaign calling for an overhaul of the Act was backed by Michael Winner, Julie Christie, and Tom Stoppard in response to the original conviction.

Classification of cannabis has become especially controversial. In 2004, cannabis was reclassified from class B to class C, in accordance with advice from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). In 2009, it was returned to class B, against ACMD advice.

In February 2009 the UK government was accused by its most senior expert drugs adviser Professor David Nutt of making a political decisions with regard to drug classification in rejecting the scientific advice to downgrade ecstasy from a class A drug. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) report on ecstasy, based on a 12-month study of 4,000 academic papers, concluded that it is nowhere near as dangerous as other class A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine, and should be downgraded to class B. The advice was not followed. Jacqui Smith, then Home Secretary, was also widely criticised by the scientific community for bullying Professor David Nutt into apologising for his comments that, in the course of a normal year, more people died from falling off horses than died from taking ecstasy. Professor Nutt was later sacked by Alan Johnson (Jacqui Smith&#x27;s successor as Home Secretary); Johnson saying &quot;It is important that the government&#x27;s messages on drugs are clear and as an advisor you do nothing to undermine public understanding of them. I cannot have public confusion between scientific advice and policy and have therefore lost confidence in your ability to advise me as Chair of the ACMD.&quot;

In May 2011, a report named Taking Drugs Seriously was released by Demos. It discusses several issues with the current system, since its enactment in 1971. It states that the constant presence of new drugs will make it difficult for the government to keep up with the latest situation - over 600 drugs are now classified under the act. Comparison levels of harm previously demonstrated by David Nutt show that alcohol and tobacco were among the most lethal, while some class A drugs, such as MDMA, LSD, and magic mushrooms, were among the least harmful.

== Use of controlled substances for research ==
A common misunderstanding amongst researchers is that most national laws (including the Misuse for Drugs Act) allows the use of small amounts of a controlled substance for non-clinical / non-in vivo research without licences. A typical use case might be having a few milligrams or microlitres of a controlled substance within larger chemical collections (often tens of thousands of chemicals) for in vitro screening. Researchers often believe that there is some form of &quot;research exemption&quot; for such small amounts. This incorrect view may be further re-enforced by R&amp;D chemical suppliers often stating and asking scientists to confirm that anything bought is for research use only.

A further misconception is that the Misuse of Drugs Act simply lists a few hundred substances (e.g. MDMA, Fentanyl, Amphetamine, etc.) and compliance can be achieved via checking a CAS number, chemical name or similar identifier. However, the reality is that in most cases all ethers, esters, salts and stereo isomers are also controlled and it is impossible to simply list all of these. The act contains several &quot;generic statements&quot; or &quot;chemical space&quot; laws, which aim to control all chemicals similar to the &quot;named&quot; substance, these provide detailed descriptions similar to Markushes, a good example of a few of these are found in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (amendment) order 2013.

Due to this complexity in legislation the identification of controlled chemicals in research is often carried out computationally, either by in house systems maintained a company&#x27;s sample logistics department or by the use commercial software solutions. Automated systems are often required as many research operations can often have chemical collections running into 10Ks of molecules at the 1–5 mg scale, which are likely to include controlled substances, especially within medicinal chemistry research, even if the core research of the company is not narcotic or psychotropic drugs. These may not have been controlled when created, but they have subsequently been declared controlled, or fall within chemical space close to known controlled substances.

There are no specific research exemptions in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. However, the associated Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/3998) does exempt products containing less than 1 mg of a controlled substance (1 μg for lysergide and derivatives) so long as a number of requirements are met, including that it cannot be recovered by readily applicable means, does not pose a risk to human health and is not meant for administration to a human or animal.

Although this does at first seem to allow research use, in most circumstances the sample, by definition, is &quot;recoverable&quot; - in order to prepare it for use the sample is &quot;recovered&quot; into an assay buffer or solvent such as DMSO or water. In 2017 the Home Office also confirmed that the 1 mg limit applies to the total of all preparations across the entire container in the case of sample microtitre plates. Given this, most companies and researchers choose not to rely on this exemption.

However according to Home Office licensing, &quot;University research departments generally do not require licences to possess and supply drugs in schedules 2, 3, 4 part I, 4 part II and schedule 5, but they do require licences to produce any of those drugs and to produce, possess and/or supply drugs in schedule 1&quot;.

<text>The Leghorn, or Livornese, is a breed of chicken originating in Tuscany, in central Italy. Birds were first exported to North America in 1828 from the Tuscan port city of Livorno, on the western coast of Italy. They were initially called &quot;Italians&quot;, but by 1865 the breed was known as &quot;Leghorn&quot;, the traditional anglicisation of &quot;Livorno&quot;. The breed was introduced to Britain from the United States in 1870. White Leghorns are commonly used as layer chickens in many countries of the world. Other Leghorn varieties are less common.

== History ==

The origins of the Leghorn are not clear; it appears to derive from light breeds originating in rural Tuscany. The name comes from Leghorn, the traditional anglicisation of Livorno, the Tuscan port from which the first birds were exported to North America. The date of the first exports is variously reported as 1828, &quot;about 1830&quot; and 1852. They were initially known as &quot;Italians&quot;; they were first referred to as &quot;Leghorns&quot; in 1865, in Worcester, Massachusetts.

The Leghorn was included in the American Standard of Perfection in 1874, with three colours: black, white and brown (light and dark). Rose comb light and dark brown were added in 1883, and rose comb white in 1886. Single comb buff and silver followed in 1894, and red, black-tailed red, and Columbian in 1929. In 1981 rose comb black, buff, silver, and golden duckwing were added.

The breed was first introduced to Britain from the United States in 1870, and from there re-exported to Italy. White Leghorns that had won first prize at the 1868 New York Show were imported to Britain in 1870, and brown Leghorns from 1872. These birds were small, not exceeding in weight; weight was increased by cross-breeding with Minorca and Malay stock. Pyle Leghorns were first bred in Britain in the 1880s; gold and silver duckwings originated there a few years later, from crosses with Phoenix or Japanese Yokohama birds. Buff Leghorns were first seen in Denmark in 1885, and in England in 1888.

== Characteristics ==
In Italy, where the Livorno breed standard is recent, ten colour varieties are recognised. There is a separate Italian standard for the German Leghorn variety, the Italiana (German: Italiener). The Fédération française des volailles (the French poultry federation) divides the breed into four types: the American white, the English white, the old type (golden-salmon) and the modern type, for which seventeen colour variants are listed for full-size birds, and fourteen for bantams; it also recognises an autosexing variety, the Cream Legbar. Both the American Poultry Association and the American Bantam Association recognize a number of Leghorn varieties including white, red, black-tailed red, light brown, dark brown, black, buff, Columbian, buff Columbian, barred, and silver. In Britain, the Leghorn Club recognises eighteen colours: golden duckwing, silver duckwing, partridge, brown, buff, exchequer, Columbian, pyle, white, black, blue, mottled, cuckoo, blue-red, lavender, red, crele, and buff Columbian. Most Leghorns have single combs; a rose comb is permitted in some countries, but not in Italy. The legs are bright yellow, and the ear-lobes white.

The Italian standard gives a weight range of for cocks, for hens. According to the British standard, fully grown Leghorn cocks weigh , hens ; cockerels weigh and pullets ; for bantams the maximum weight is for cocks and for hens. Ring size is for cocks, for hens.

== Use ==

Leghorns are good layers of white eggs, laying an average of 280 per year and sometimes reaching 300–320, with a weight of at least . White Leghorns have been much used to create highly productive egg-laying hybrids for commercial and industrial operations.

<text>Shall and will are two of the English modal verbs. They have various uses, including the expression of propositions about the future, in what is usually referred to as the future tense of English.

Historically, prescriptive grammar stated that, when expressing pure futurity (without any additional meaning such as desire or command), &quot;shall&quot; was to be used when the subject was in the first person, and &quot;will&quot; in other cases (e.g., &quot;On Sunday, we shall go to church, and the preacher will read the Bible.&quot;) This rule is no longer commonly adhered to by any group of English speakers, and &quot;will&quot; has essentially replaced &quot;shall&quot; in nearly all contexts.

&quot;Shall&quot; is, however, still widely used in bureaucratic documents, especially documents written by lawyers. Owing its use in varying legal contexts, its meaning can be ambiguous; the United States government&#x27;s Plain Language group advises writers not to use the word at all. Other legal drafting experts, including Plain Language advocates, argue that while &quot;shall&quot; can be ambiguous in statutes (which most of the cited litigation on the word&#x27;s interpretation involves), court rules, and consumer contracts, that reasoning does not apply to the language of business contracts. These experts recommend using &quot;shall&quot; but only to impose an obligation on a contractual party that is the subject of the sentence, i.e., to convey the meaning &quot;hereby has a duty to&quot;.

==Etymology==

The verb &quot;shall&quot; derives from Old English &quot;sceal&quot;. Its cognates in other Germanic languages include Old Norse &quot;skal&quot;, German &quot;soll&quot;, and Dutch &quot;zal&quot;; these all represent *&quot;skol-&quot;, the o-grade of Indo-European *&quot;skel&quot;-. All of these verbs function as auxiliaries, representing either simple futurity, or necessity or obligation.

The verb &quot;will&quot; derives from Old English &quot;willan&quot;, meaning to want or wish. Cognates include Old Norse &quot;vilja&quot;, German &quot;wollen&quot; (&quot;ich/er/sie will,&quot; meaning &quot;I/he/she want/s to&quot;), Dutch &quot;willen&quot;, Gothic &quot;wiljan&quot;. It also has relatives in non-Germanic languages, such as Latin &quot;velle&quot; (&quot;wish for&quot;) and &quot;voluptas&quot; (&quot;pleasure&quot;), and Polish &quot;woleć&quot; (&quot;prefer&quot;). All of these forms derive from the e-grade or o-grade of Indo-European *&quot;wel-&quot;, meaning to wish for or desire. Within English, the modal verb &quot;will&quot; is also related to the noun &quot;will&quot; and the regular lexical verb &quot;will&quot; (as in &quot;She willed him on&quot;).

Early Germanic did not inherit any Proto-Indo-European forms to express the future tense, and so the Germanic languages have innovated by using auxiliary verbs to express the future (this is evidenced in Gothic and in the earliest recorded Germanic expressions). In English, &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot; are the auxiliaries that came to be used for this purpose. (Another auxiliary used as such in Old English was &quot;mun&quot;, which is related to Scots &quot;maun&quot;, Modern English &quot;must&quot; and Dutch &quot;moet.&quot;)
==Derived forms and pronunciation==
Both &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot; come from verbs that had the preterite-present conjugation in Old English (and generally in Germanic), meaning that they were conjugated using the strong preterite form (i.e., the usual past tense form) as the present tense. Because of this, like the other modal verbs, they do not take the usual &quot;-s&quot; in Modern English&#x27;s third-person singular present; we say &quot;she shall&quot; and &quot;he will&quot; – not *&quot;she shalls&quot;, and not *&quot;he wills&quot; (except in the sense of &quot;to will&quot; being a synonym of &quot;to want&quot; or &quot;to write into a will&quot;). Archaically, there were, however, the variants &quot;shalt&quot; and &quot;wilt&quot;, which were used with &quot;thou&quot;.

Both verbs also have their own preterite (past) forms, namely &quot;should&quot; and &quot;would&quot;, which derive from the actual preterites of the Old English verbs (made using the dental suffix that forms the preterites of weak verbs). These forms have developed a range of meanings, frequently independent of those of &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot; (as described in the section on &quot;should&quot; and &quot;would&quot; below). Aside from this, though, &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot; (like the other modals) are defective verbs – they do not have other grammatical forms such as infinitives, imperatives or participles. (For instance, &quot;I want to will eat something&quot; or &quot;He&#x27;s go to sleep&quot; do not exist.)

Both &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot; may be contracted to &quot;-&#x27;ll&quot;, most commonly in affirmative statements where they follow a subject pronoun. Their negations, &quot;shall not&quot; and &quot;will not&quot;, also have contracted forms: &quot;shan&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;won&#x27;t&quot; (although &quot;shan&#x27;t&quot; is rarely used in North America, and is becoming rarer elsewhere too). 

The pronunciation of &quot;will&quot; is , and that of &quot;won&#x27;t&quot; is . However &quot;shall&quot; has distinct weak and strong pronunciations: when unstressed, and when stressed. &quot;Shan&#x27;t&quot; is pronounced in England, New Zealand, South Africa etc.; in North America (if used) it is pronounced , and both forms are acceptable in Australia (due to the unique course of the trap–bath split).

==Specific uses of &quot;shall&quot; or &quot;will&quot;==
The modal verbs &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot; have been used in the past, and continue to be used, in a variety of meanings. Although when used purely as future markers they are largely interchangeable (as will be discussed in the following sections), each of the two verbs also has certain specific uses in which it cannot be replaced by the other without change of meaning.

The most common specific use of &quot;shall&quot; in everyday English is in questions that serve as offers or suggestions: &quot;Shall I ...?&quot; or &quot;Shall we ...?&quot; These are discussed under below.

In statements, &quot;shall&quot; has the specific use of expressing an order or instruction, normally in elevated or formal register. This use can blend with the usage of &quot;shall&quot; to express futurity, and is therefore discussed in detail below under .

&quot;Will&quot; (but not &quot;shall&quot;) is used to express habitual action, often (but not exclusively) action that the speaker finds annoying:
*He will bite his nails, whatever I say.
*He will often stand on his head.

Similarly, &quot;will&quot; is used to express something that can be expected to happen in a general case, or something that is highly likely at the present time:
*A coat will last two years when properly cared for.
*That will be Mo at the door.

The other main specific implication of &quot;will&quot; is to express willingness, desire or intention. This blends with its usage in expressing futurity, and is discussed under . For its use in questions about the future, see .

==Uses of &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot; in expressing futurity==

Both &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot; can be used to mark a circumstance as occurring in future time; this construction is often referred to as the future tense of English. For example: 
* Will they be here tomorrow?
* I shall grow old some day.
* Shall we go for dinner?
When &quot;will&quot; or &quot;shall&quot; directly governs the infinitive of the main verb, as in the above examples, the construction is called the simple future. Future marking can also be combined with aspectual marking to produce constructions known as future progressive (&quot;He will be working&quot;), future perfect (&quot;He will have worked&quot;) and future perfect progressive (&quot;He will have been working&quot;). English also has other ways of referring to future circumstances, including the &quot;going to&quot; construction, and in many cases the ordinary present tense – details of these can be found in the article on the &quot;going-to&quot; future.

The verbs &quot;will&quot; and &quot;shall&quot;, when used as future markers, are largely interchangeable with regard to literal meaning. Generally, however, &quot;will&quot; is far more common than &quot;shall&quot;. Use of &quot;shall&quot; is normally a marked usage, typically indicating formality or seriousness and (if not used with a first person subject) expressing a colored meaning as described below. In most dialects of English, the use of &quot;shall&quot; as a future marker is viewed as archaic.

&quot;Will&quot; is ambiguous in first-person statements, and &quot;shall&quot; is ambiguous in second- and third-person statements. A rule of prescriptive grammar was created to remove these ambiguities, but it requires that the hearer or reader understand the rule followed by the speaker or writer, which is usually not the case. According to this rule, when expressing futurity and nothing more, the auxiliary &quot;shall&quot; is to be used with first person subjects (&quot;I&quot; and &quot;we&quot;), and &quot;will&quot; is to be used in other instances. Using &quot;will&quot; with the first person or &quot;shall&quot; with the second or third person is asserted to indicate some additional meaning in addition to plain futurity. In practice, however, this rule is not observed – the two auxiliaries are used interchangeably, with &quot;will&quot; being far more common than &quot;shall&quot;. This is discussed in more detail in the following sections.

===Prescriptivist distinction===

According to &quot;Merriam Webster&#x27;s Dictionary of English Usage&quot;, the distinction between &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot; as future markers arose from the practice of Latin teaching in English schools in the 14th century. It was customary to use &quot;will&quot; to translate the Latin &quot;velle&quot; (meaning to wish, want or intend); this left &quot;shall&quot; (which had no other equivalent in Latin) to translate the Latin future tense. This practice kept &quot;shall&quot; alive in the role of future marker; it is used consistently as such in the Middle English Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible. However, in the common language it was &quot;will&quot; that was becoming predominant in that role. Chaucer normally uses &quot;will&quot; to indicate the future, regardless of grammatical person.

An influential proponent of the prescriptive rule that &quot;shall&quot; is to be used as the usual future marker in the first person was John Wallis. In &quot;Grammatica Linguae Anglicanae&quot; (1653) he wrote: &quot;The rule is [...] to express a future event without emotional overtones, one should say I shall, we shall, but you/he/she/they will; conversely, for emphasis, willfulness, or insistence, one should say I/we will, but you/he/she/they shall&quot;.

Henry Watson Fowler wrote in his book &quot;The King&#x27;s English&quot; (1906), regarding the rules for using &quot;shall&quot; vs. &quot;will&quot;, the comment &quot;the idiomatic use, while it comes by nature to southern Englishmen ... is so complicated that those who are not to the manner born can hardly acquire it&quot;. The &quot;Pocket Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot;, OUP, 2002, says of the rule for the use of &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot;: &quot;it is unlikely that this rule has ever had any consistent basis of authority in actual usage, and many examples of [British] English in print disregard it&quot;.

Nonetheless, even among speakers (the majority) who do not follow the rule about using &quot;shall&quot; as the unmarked form in the first person, there is still a tendency to use &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot; to express different shades of meaning (reflecting aspects of their original Old English senses). Thus &quot;shall&quot; is used with the meaning of obligation, and &quot;will&quot; with the meaning of desire or intention.

An illustration of the supposed contrast between &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot; (when the prescriptive rule is adhered to) appeared in the 19th century, and has been repeated in the 20th century and in the 21st:
* I shall drown; no one will save me! (expresses the expectation of drowning, simple expression of future occurrence)
* I will drown; no one shall save me! (expresses suicidal intent: first-person &quot;will&quot; for desire, third-person &quot;shall&quot; for command)
An example of this distinction in writing occurs in Henry James&#x27;s 1893 short story &quot;The Middle Years&quot;:
:&quot;Don&#x27;t you know?—I want to what they call &#x27;live.&#x27;&quot;
:The young man, for good-by, had taken his hand, which closed with a certain force. They looked at each other hard a moment. &quot;You &quot;will&quot; live,&quot; said Dr. Hugh.
:&quot;Don&#x27;t be superficial. It&#x27;s too serious!&quot;
:&quot;You &quot;shall&quot; live!&quot; Dencombe&#x27;s visitor declared, turning pale.
:&quot;Ah, that&#x27;s better!&quot; And as he retired the invalid, with a troubled laugh, sank gratefully back.

A more popular illustration of the use of &quot;shall&quot; with the second person to express determination occurs in the oft-quoted words the fairy godmother traditionally says to Cinderella in British versions of the well-known fairy tale: &quot;You &quot;shall&quot; go to the ball, Cinderella!&quot;

Another popular illustration is in the dramatic scene from &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; when Gandalf checks the Balrog&#x27;s advance with magisterial censure, &quot;You shall not pass!&quot;

The use of &quot;shall&quot; as the usual future marker in the first person nevertheless persists in some more formal or elevated registers of English. An example is provided by the famous speech of Winston Churchill: &quot;We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.&#x27;&quot;

===Colored uses===
Whether or not the above-mentioned prescriptive rule (&quot;shall&quot; for the unmarked future in the first person) is adhered to, there are certain meanings in which either &quot;will&quot; or &quot;shall&quot; tends to be used rather than the other. Some of these have already been mentioned (see the Specific uses section). However, there are also cases in which the meaning being expressed combines plain futurity with some additional implication; these can be referred to as &quot;colored&quot; uses of the future markers.

Thus &quot;shall&quot; may be used (particularly in the second and third persons) to imply a command, promise or threat made by the speaker (i.e., that the future event denoted represents the will of the speaker rather than that of the subject). For example:
*You shall regret it before long. (speaker&#x27;s threat)
*You shall not pass! (speaker&#x27;s command)
*You &quot;shall&quot; go to the ball. (speaker&#x27;s promise) 

In the above sentences, &quot;shall&quot; might be replaced by &quot;will&quot; without change of intended meaning, although the form with &quot;will&quot; could also be interpreted as a plain statement about the expected future. The use of &quot;shall&quot; is often associated with formality and/or seriousness, in addition to the coloring of the meaning. For some specific cases of its formal use, see the sections below on and .

(Another, generally archaic, use of &quot;shall&quot; is in certain dependent clauses with future reference, as in &quot;The prize is to be given to whoever shall have done the best.&quot; More normal here in modern English is the simple present tense: &quot;whoever does the best&quot;; see .)

On the other hand, &quot;will&quot; can be used (in the first person) to emphasize the willingness, desire or intention of the speaker:
*I will lend you £10,000 at 5% (the speaker is willing to make the loan, but it will not necessarily be made)
*I will have my way.
Most speakers have &quot;will&quot; as the future marker in any case, but when the meaning is as above, even those who follow or are influenced by the prescriptive rule would tend to use &quot;will&quot; (rather than the &quot;shall&quot; that they would use with a first person subject for the uncolored future).

The division of uses of &quot;will&quot; and &quot;shall&quot; is somewhat different in questions than in statements; see the following section for details.

== Questions ==
In questions, the traditional prescriptive usage is that the auxiliary used should be the one expected in the answer. Hence in enquiring factually about the future, one could ask: &quot;Shall you accompany me?&quot; (to accord with the expected answer &quot;I shall&quot;, since the rule prescribes &quot;shall&quot; as the uncolored future marker in the first person). To use &quot;will&quot; instead would turn the question into a request. In practice, however, &quot;shall&quot; is almost never used in questions of this type. To mark a factual question as distinct from a request, the &quot;going-to&quot; future (or just the present tense) can be used: &quot;Are you going to accompany me?&quot; (or &quot;Are you accompanying me?&quot;).

The chief use of &quot;shall&quot; in questions is with a first person subject (&quot;I&quot; or &quot;we&quot;), to make offers and suggestions, or request suggestions or instructions:
* Shall I open a window?
* Shall we dance?
* Where shall we go today?
* What shall I do next?
This is common in the UK and other parts of the English-speaking world; it is also found in the United States, but there &quot;should&quot; is often a less marked alternative. Normally the use of &quot;will&quot; in such questions would change the meaning to a simple request for information: &quot;Shall I play goalkeeper?&quot; is an offer or suggestion, while &quot;Will I play goalkeeper?&quot; is just a question about the expected future situation.

The above meaning of &quot;shall&quot; is generally confined to direct questions with a first person subject. In the case of a reported question (even if not reported in the past tense), &quot;shall&quot; is likely to be replaced by &quot;should&quot; or another modal verb such as &quot;might&quot;: &quot;She is asking if she should open a window&quot;; &quot;He asked if they might dance.&quot;

The auxiliary &quot;will&quot; can therefore be used in questions either simply to enquire about what is expected to occur in the future, or (especially with the second person subject &quot;you&quot;) to make a request:
* Where will tomorrow&#x27;s match be played? (factual enquiry)
* Will the new director do a good job? (enquiry for opinion)
* Will I put on the radio? (enquiry for confirmation to act)
* Will you marry me? (request)

== Legal and technical use ==
=== US legal system ===
Bryan Garner and Justice Scalia in &quot;Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts&quot; describe that some legal drafting has sloppy use of the word &quot;shall&quot;. Nevertheless, Garner and Scalia conclude that when the word &quot;shall&quot; can reasonably be understood as mandatory, it ought to be taken that way. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court said (&quot;The word &#x27;shall&#x27; generally indicates a command that admits of no discretion on the part of the person instructed to carry out the directive&quot;); Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary 1375 (6th ed. 1990) (&quot;As used in statutes ... this word is generally imperative or mandatory&quot;).

Legislative acts and contracts sometimes use &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;shall not&quot; to express mandatory action and prohibition. However, it is sometimes used to mean &quot;may&quot; or &quot;can&quot;. The most famous example of both of these uses of the word &quot;shall&quot; is the . Claims that &quot;shall&quot; is used to denote a fact, or is not used with the above different meanings, have caused discussions and have significant consequences for interpreting the text&#x27;s intended meaning. Lawsuits over the word&#x27;s meaning are also common.

=== Technical contexts ===
In many requirement specifications, particularly involving software, the words &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot; have special meanings. Most requirement specifications use the word &quot;shall&quot; to denote something that is required, while reserving the &quot;will&quot; for simple statement about the future (especially since &quot;going to&quot; is typically seen as too informal for legal contexts). However, some documents deviate from this convention and use the words &quot;shall&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, and &quot;should&quot; to denote the strength of the requirement. Some requirement specifications will define the terms at the beginning of the document.

Shall and will are distinguished by NASA and Wikiversity as follows:
*&quot;Shall&quot; is usually used to state a device or system&#x27;s requirements. For example: &quot;The selected generator shall provide a minimum of 80 Kilowatts.&quot;
*&quot;Will&quot; is generally used to state a device or system&#x27;s purpose. For example, &quot;The new generator will be used to power the operations tent.&quot;

On standards published by International Organization for Standardization (ISO), IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission), ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials), IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), requirements with &quot;shall&quot; are the mandatory requirements, meaning, &quot;must&quot;, or &quot;have to&quot;. The IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) defines &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;must&quot; as synonymous terms denoting absolute requirements, and &quot;should&quot; as denoting a somewhat flexible requirement, in RFC documents.

On specifications and standards published by the United States Department of Defense (DoD), requirements with &quot;shall&quot; are the mandatory requirements. (&quot;Must&quot; shall not be used to express mandatory provisions. Use the term &quot;shall&quot;.) &quot;Will&quot; declares intent or simple futurity, and &quot;should&quot; and &quot;may&quot; express nonmandatory provisions.

Outside DoD, other parts of the U.S. government advise against using the word &quot;shall&quot; for three reasons: it lacks a single clear meaning, it causes litigation, and it is nearly absent from ordinary speech. The legal reference &quot;Words and Phrases&quot; dedicates 76 pages to summarizing hundreds of lawsuits that centered around the meaning of the word shall. When referencing a legal or technical requirement, &quot;Words and Phrases&quot; instead favors &quot;must&quot; while reserving &quot;should&quot; for recommendations.

==&quot;Should&quot; and &quot;would&quot;==

As noted above, &quot;should&quot; and &quot;would&quot; originated as the preterite (past tense) forms of &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot;. In some of their uses they can still be identified as past (or conditional) forms of those verbs, but they have also developed some specific meanings of their own.

===Independent uses===
The main use of &quot;should&quot; in modern English is as a synonym of &quot;ought to&quot;, expressing quasi-obligation, appropriateness, or expectation (it cannot be replaced by &quot;would&quot; in these meanings). Examples:
* You should not say such things. (it is wrong to do so)
* He should move his pawn. (it is optimal to do so) 
* Why should you suspect me? (for what reason is it proper to suspect me?)
* You should have enough time to finish the work. (a prediction)
* I should be able to come. (a prediction, implies some uncertainty)
* There should be some cheese in the kitchen. (expectation)

Other specific uses of &quot;should&quot; involve the expression of irrealis mood:
* in condition clauses (protasis), e.g., &quot;If it should rain&quot; or &quot;Should it rain&quot;; see English conditional sentences
* as an alternative to the subjunctive, e.g., &quot;It is important that he (should) leave&quot;; see English subjunctive

The main use of &quot;would&quot; is in conditional clauses (described in detail in the article on English conditional sentences):
*I would not be here if you hadn&#x27;t summoned me.
In this use, &quot;would&quot; is sometimes (though rarely) replaced by &quot;should&quot; when the subject is in the first person (by virtue of the same prescriptive rule that demands &quot;shall&quot; rather than &quot;will&quot; as the normal future marker for that person). This &quot;should&quot; is found in stock phrases such as &quot;I should think&quot; and &quot;I should expect&quot;. However its use in more general cases is old-fashioned or highly formal, and can give rise to ambiguity with the more common use of &quot;should&quot; to mean &quot;ought to&quot;. This is illustrated by the following sentences: 
* You would apologize if you saw him. (pure conditional, stating what would happen)
* You should apologize if you see him. (states what would be proper)
* I would apologize if I saw him. (pure conditional)
* I should apologize if I saw him. (possibly a formal variant of the above, but may be understood to be stating what is proper)

In archaic usage &quot;would&quot; has been used to indicate present time desire. &quot;Would that I were dead&quot; means &quot;I wish I were dead&quot;. &quot;I would fain&quot; means &quot;I would gladly&quot;.

More details of the usage of &quot;should&quot;, &quot;would&quot; and other related auxiliaries can be found in the article on English modal verbs.

===As past of &quot;shall&quot; and &quot;will&quot;===
When &quot;would&quot; and &quot;should&quot; function as past tenses of &quot;will&quot; and &quot;shall&quot;, their usage tends to correspond to that of the latter verbs (&quot;would&quot; is used analogously to &quot;will&quot;, and &quot;should&quot; to &quot;shall&quot;).

Thus &quot;would&quot; and &quot;should&quot; can be used with &quot;future-in-the-past&quot; meaning, to express what was expected to happen, or what in fact did happen, after some past time of reference. The use of &quot;should&quot; here (like that of &quot;shall&quot; as a plain future marker) is much less common and is generally confined to the first person. Examples:
*He left Bath in 1890, and would never return. (in fact he never returned after that)
*It seemed that it would rain. (rain was expected)
*Little did I know that I would (&quot;rarer:&quot; should) see her again the very next day.

&quot;Would&quot; can also be used as the past equivalent of &quot;will&quot; in its other specific uses, such as in expressing habitual actions (see English markers of habitual aspect#Would):
* Last summer we would go fishing a lot. (i.e., we used to go fishing a lot)

In particular, &quot;would&quot; and &quot;should&quot; are used as the past equivalents of &quot;will&quot; and &quot;shall&quot; in indirect speech reported in the past tense:
*The ladder will fall. → He said that the ladder would fall.
*You shall obey me! → He said that I should obey him.
*I shall go swimming this afternoon. → I said that I should go swimming in the afternoon.
As with the conditional use referred to above, the use of &quot;should&quot; in such instances can lead to ambiguity; in the last example it is not clear whether the original statement was &quot;shall&quot; (expressing plain future) or &quot;should&quot; (meaning &quot;ought to&quot;). Similarly &quot;The archbishop said that we &quot;should&quot; all sin from time to time&quot; is intended to report the pronouncement that &quot;We &quot;shall&quot; all sin from time to time&quot; (where &quot;shall&quot; denotes simple futurity), but instead gives the highly misleading impression that the original word was &quot;should&quot; (meaning &quot;ought to&quot;).

<text>Lost Horizon is a 1973 musical fantasy adventure film directed by Charles Jarrott and starring Peter Finch, Liv Ullmann, Sally Kellerman, George Kennedy, Michael York, Olivia Hussey, Bobby Van, James Shigeta, Charles Boyer and John Gielgud. It was also the final film produced by Ross Hunter. The film is a remake of Frank Capra&#x27;s 1937 film of the same name, with a screenplay by Larry Kramer. Both stories were adapted from James Hilton&#x27;s 1933 novel &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;.

&quot;Lost Horizon&quot; was lambasted by critics at the time of its 1973 release, but since then it has developed a strong cult following. The film was chosen for a Command Performance before Queen Elizabeth. The first American film in seventeen years to receive this honor. It was selected for inclusion in the book &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot;, co-written by critic Michael Medved, and is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made. The film was a box office disappointment in America, but was financially successful in its overseas market.

==Plot==
The DC3 of a group of travellers is hijacked while fleeing a bloody revolution. The aeroplane crash-lands in an unexplored area of the Himalayas, where the party is rescued and taken to the lamasery of Shangri-La. Miraculously, Shangri-La, sheltered by mountains on all sides, is a temperate paradise amid the land of snows. Perfect health is the norm, and inhabitants live to very old age while maintaining a youthful appearance.

The newcomers quickly adjust, especially group leader and United Nations Peace Negotiator, Richard Conway. He falls in love with Catherine, a schoolteacher whose parents perished while hiking with her in the mountains. Drug addict photographer Sally Hughes is initially suicidal, but begins counseling with lamas Chang and To Len, eventually finding inner peace. Industrialist Sam Cornelius discovers gold in the local river, but Sally convinces him to use his engineering skills to bring better irrigation to the farmers of Shangri-La instead of smuggling the gold. Harry Lovett is a third-rate comic and song and dance man who has a flair for working with the children of Shangri-La.

Everyone is content to stay except Conway&#x27;s younger brother, George. Shangri-La, despite its utopian allure, has certain expectations of its citizens. Specifically following the mantra of moderation in all things, simplicity and communal existence, as explained by Chang. George has also fallen in love with Maria, a dancer, and wants to take her along when he leaves. Chang warns Richard that Maria came to Shangri-La over 80 years ago, at the age of 20. If she were to leave the valley, she would revert to her actual age.

Richard is summoned to meet the High Lama, who informs him that the plane was hijacked on purpose and that he was brought there for a reason, to succeed him as the leader of the community. The High Lama has been following Richard&#x27;s actions in the United Nations for years. However, on the night that the High Lama dies, George and Maria insist to Richard that everything the High Lama and Chang have said is a lie. They convince him to leave immediately.

Still in shock from the High Lama&#x27;s death, Richard leaves without even saying goodbye to Catherine. Not long after their departure, the trio is struggling to keep up with the local guides. As a blizzard starts, an avalanche erupts and kills the party of guides and they are stranded in the storm. Maria suddenly ages and dies, and George, running wildly in grief over the death of his partner, falls to his death down an icy ravine. Richard struggles on alone, ending up in a hospital bed in the Himalayan foothills. The United Nations discovers he has survived and sends a party to take him back to the Western world. However, he runs away, goes back to the mountains, and finds the portal to Shangri-La once more.

==Cast==
==Musical numbers==
Unusually for a musical film, songs do not feature throughout. As generally released, the film runs for around two hours and fifteen minutes: the first song sung by a cast member, &quot;Share the Joy&quot;, appears over 40 minutes in, and the final number, &quot;I Come to You&quot;, ends with half an hour running time still left. This led to some critics, notably Judith Crist in &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; observing that the (largely non-musical) cast fared better when they were not involved in musical numbers.
Large parts of the score were deleted after the film&#x27;s roadshow release. The dance sections of &quot;Living Together, Growing Together&quot; were cut, and &quot;If I Could Go Back&quot;, &quot;Where Knowledge Ends (Faith Begins)&quot; and &quot;I Come to You&quot; were removed, but restored for the laserdisc release. All songs appear on the soundtrack LP and CD. According to the laserdisc notes, Kellerman and Kennedy had a reprise of &quot;Living Together, Growing Together&quot; that was also lost.

Hunter wanted to follow up with another musical, set in 1930s Hollywood, titled &quot;Hollywood Hollywood&quot;. It was never made.

===Soundtrack===
In his 2013 autobiography, Bacharach cites &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; as very nearly ending his musical career. He stated that the songs worked when taken in isolation, but not in the context of the film. The Bacharach-David partnership, which had been long and both critically and financially successful, was effectively terminated by their experiences working on the score. Bacharach felt that the producers were sanctioning weakened versions of his music, and he attempted to exert greater influence over what was being developed. However, this led to his being banned from the editing suite at Todd-AO. Bacharach felt that he had been left to defend his position alone, and that Hal David had been inadequately supportive. This led to an exchange of lawsuits, destroying their professional relationship. Bacharach&#x27;s own versions of several of the songs appeared on his album &quot;Living Together&quot; (1974).

Of the lead actors, only Kellerman, Van and Shigeta perform their own singing. Kennedy was coached by Bacharach but was not used as a vocalist in the finished film. Hussey, Finch and Ullmann were dubbed by Andra Willis, Jerry Whitman and Diana Lee respectively. Some of the children who provided the singing voices of the Shangri-La children were Alison Freebairn-Smith, Pamelyn Ferdin (a popular child actress of the 1960s and 1970s, who was the original voice of Lucy Van Pelt in the &quot;Peanuts&quot; animated specials), Harry Blackstone III, David Joyce, and Jennifer Hicklin.

The soundtrack was more successful than the film, peaking at No. 56 on the &quot;Billboard 200.&quot; Commercially successful singles were issued of both the title song, performed by Shawn Phillips, and &quot;Living Together, Growing Together&quot; by The 5th Dimension, the latter being the band&#x27;s last top 40 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop charts. The song &quot;Things I Will Not Miss&quot; was covered by Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye during recording sessions for the 1973 album &quot;Diana and Marvin&quot;. Tony Bennett recorded &quot;Living Together, Growing Together&quot; and &quot;If I Could Go Back&quot; for MGM/Verve. Richard Harris sang &quot;If I Could Go Back&quot; to the original musical arrangement made for the movie in the 1973 TV special &quot;Burt Bacharach in Shangri-La&quot;. Herb Alpert recorded an instrumental cover of &quot;I Might Frighten Her Away&quot; on his album &quot;You Smile – The Song Begins.&quot;

Ross Hunter made his name producing remakes at Universal, including &quot;Magnificent Obsession&quot; and &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;. &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; had previously been adapted onstage as &quot;Shangri-La&quot; in 1956.

In April 1971, after 20 years of association, Hunter departed Universal and set up operations at Columbia where his first film was to be &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;. In 1971, Hunter said, 

===Development===
Hunter called the film &quot;a picture of hope, of faith with a spiritual quality. We all need that with the pressures of the world... Everyone&#x27;s looking for a place that has peace and security.&quot; Hunter had a role written for Helen Hayes. Julie Andrews was considered for the role of Catherine.

In December 1971, Charles Jarrott signed to direct, with Peter Finch cast in February 1972. March 1972 saw the hiring of Hermes Pan as choreographer.

===Cast and crew reactions===
Finch later stated that he enjoyed his time on the film.

Scribe Larry Kramer publicly acknowledged that he is not particularly proud of his workmanlike job adapting the original film&#x27;s script. However, the deal he engineered for his work on the film—hot on the heels of his Oscar nomination for the screenplay for &quot;Women in Love&quot;—combined with skilled investments, made it possible for him to live the rest of his creative life free of financial worries. In that sense, this film enabled Kramer to devote himself to the gay community activism and the writings (e.g., his AIDS play &quot;The Normal Heart&quot;) which came later.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Lost Horizon&quot; is considered one of the last of several box-office musical failures of the late 1960s and early 1970s as well as the last musical film to be given the roadshow release, which came in the wake of the success of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. Attempts to update the idea of Shangri-La with its racial inequalities intact, coupled with old-fashioned songs, effectively sealed its fate, according to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; film critic Pauline Kael. She noted that Shangri-La was depicted as:

a middle-class geriatric utopia [where]...you can live indefinitely, lounging and puttering about for hundreds of years...the Orientals are kept in their places, and no blacks...are among the residents. There&#x27;s probably no way to rethink this material without throwing it all away.

Julian Fox of &quot;Films and Filming&quot; raved about the film. &quot;I have to say it, this really is a marvelous film. It&#x27;s entertaining, the sets really do evoke the spirit of a benevolent Buddha whereas the Capra film gave us an odd mixture of Mandarin and Frank Lloyd Wright...The Himalayan scenes are awe-inspiring-ant-like men plodding in single file across a breathtaking snowscape-the sheer excitement of the uprising in Baskul, the stunning aerial photography and incredible moment the passengers of the crashed aircraft are confronted by the escort party from Shangri-La, moving slowly towards them in the midst of the blizzard is a genuine cinematic feast.&quot;

Arthur Knight of &quot;Saturday Review&quot; acknowledge that &quot;For a new generation, however, imbued with the ideals of peace and love, this LOST HORIZON may prove very satisfying. Its main set, the lamasery, is a distinct improvement over the original, which looked like a Pasadena art museum. Its cast attractive, if not always distinguished. The music is well crafted, if not memorable.&quot;

Alan R. Howard of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; also liked it. &quot;What&#x27;s most impressive about Hunter&#x27;s movie is its technical discipline. Even though the movie is a gigantic production, it has a modest feeling and look. Director Jarrott explores each scene carefully, there&#x27;s certainly nothing lazy about his work...The Bacharach score is best in light breezy songs...Robert Surtee&#x27;s photography is never soupy soft-focus. Instead, it is clean, sharp and efficient, free of the cliches of recent musicals&quot;.

&quot;Boxoffice Magazine&quot; reviewed &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; in its issue of March 19, stating in part: &quot;...As G-rated entertainment with a screenful of stars, lavish sets and song and dance numbers galore, the new film should please a large portion of the population. Critics are apt to turn a scornful eye at the Larry Kramer screenplay, as directed by Charles Jarrott, but this is an audience film in the purest sense. No time is wasted in getting the story under way, producer Hunter having assumed that everyone is familiar with the plot. Peter Finch is an excellent choice for the part of Conway and there are some gems in the casting, most especially Sally Kellerman singing and dancing as the neurotic ex-idealist who finds salvation in Shangri-La and Charles Boyer as the High Lama.&quot; 

Pauline Kael gave the film a negative review but also acknowledged that &quot;It&#x27;s entirely possible that to the nostalgic viewers Ross Hunter is aiming at, this torpor will be soothing&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film one star out of four and wrote that &quot;it sinks altogether during a series of the most incompetent and clumsy dance numbers I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded one star out of four and wrote that &quot;Nothing works. Not the lyrics, not the sets, not the dancing, not the script, and—with all that going against them—not the actors.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a big, stale marshamallow&quot; that was &quot;surprisingly tacky in appearance&quot; despite its large budget. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film looked &quot;tacky and uncomfortable&quot; and described the songs as &quot;mechanical and uninteresting.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the score &quot;leaves almost no impression and certainly nothing resembling a joyful impression&quot;, adding &quot;Even if the songs did make you dance with joy, you&#x27;d be dancing alone. With the exception of Bobby Van, a kind of poor man&#x27;s Donald O&#x27;Connor, the cast has no aptitude for singing and dancing.&quot;

After derided preview screenings Columbia Pictures attempted to re-cut, but to no avail. Critic John Simon remarked that it &quot;must have arrived in garbage rather than in film cans.&quot; &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; was such a box-office failure that the film gained the nickname &quot;Lost Investment&quot;. Bette Midler alluded to it as &quot;Lost Her-Reason&quot; and famously quipped &quot;I never miss a Liv Ullmann musical&quot;. 

The film was selected for inclusion in the book &quot;The Fifty Worst Films of All Time&quot;, co-written by critic Michael Medved. The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John J. B. Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; holds a 14% rating based on seven reviews.

==Box Office==
The film was one of the most popular movies at the British box office in 1973.

==Home media==
On October 11, 2011, Columbia Classics, the manufacturing-on-demand unit of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, released a fully restored DVD, which reinstated all of the elements cut after the roadshow release. The DVD also contains supplemental features, including promos featuring producer Hunter as well as the original song demos played and sung by composer Bacharach. Some of these demos contain different lyrics from those in the final versions utilized in the film.

On December 11, 2012, Screen Archives Entertainment (Twilight Time) issued an exclusive Blu-ray, with a 5.1 lossless soundtrack and an isolated film score.

<doc id="445938" wikidata="Q5004647" url="?curid=445938" title="Bytown">
<text>Bytown is the former name of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It was founded on September 26, 1826, incorporated as a town on January 1, 1850, and superseded by the incorporation of the City of Ottawa on January 1, 1855. The founding was marked by a sod turning, and a letter from Governor General Dalhousie which authorized Lieutenant Colonel John By to divide up the town into lots. Bytown came about as a result of the construction of the Rideau Canal and grew largely due to the Ottawa River timber trade. Bytown&#x27;s first mayor was John Scott, elected in 1847.

==Overview==

Bytown was located where the Rideau Canal meets the Ottawa River and consisted of two parts centered around the canal, Upper Town and Lower Town. Upper Town, situated to the west of the canal, was situated in the area of the current downtown and Parliament Hill. Lower Town was on the east side of the canal where today&#x27;s Byward Market and general area of Lower Town still exists. The two areas of town were connected over the Rideau Canal by the Sappers Bridge, constructed in 1827.

The town took its name from John By who, as a lieutenant colonel in the British Royal Engineers, was instrumental in the construction of the canal. The name &quot;Bytown&quot; came about, somewhat as a &quot;jocular reference&quot; during a small dinner party of some officers, and it appears on official correspondence dated 1828.

Joseph Bouchette in the summer of 1828 wrote:
Colonel By laid out the streets of Bytown, a pattern that mostly exists today. Wellington Street, Rideau Street, Sussex and Sparks Street were some of the earliest streets in use. Sappers Bridge actually connected Sparks Street to Rideau Street at that time. Nicholas Sparks owned Bytown&#x27;s land west of the canal, except for the lands north of Wellington, which were considered &quot;Ordnance&quot; lands. The area east of Bank Street to the canal was acquired by the military and not used for houses for around two decades, after which it was returned to him.

The Ottawa River timber trade spurred the growth of Bytown, and it saw an influx of immigrants, and later entrepreneurs hoping to profit from the squared timber that would be floated down the Ottawa River to Quebec. Bytown had seen some trouble in the early days, first with the Shiners&#x27; War in 1835 to 1845, and the Stony Monday Riot in 1849.

Some early buildings that still stand had been erected in Bytown. In 1826, Thomas McKay was contracted to build the commissariat building, now the Bytown Museum. McKay also built Rideau Hall (which has since been expanded), and parts of the Union Bridge connecting LeBreton Flats to Hull. Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica was also built early on in the developing town. The University of Ottawa had its 1846 origins as a college, and it received its present location in 1856.

Though administration of Bytown had been conducted by civil authorities since 1828, the town did not become incorporated until much later. Various attempts at incorporation had been initiated since 1845. The Ordnance Department had held lands in the town&#x27;s core (dividing Upper Town from Lower Town), lands which had been the property of Nicholas Sparks. These lands were considered by many to be blocking economic progress as well as being held for speculative reasons only. When Ordnance eventually returned the lands to Sparks through the Vesting Act, the major obstacle to incorporation was removed. Bytown was initially incorporated on July 28, 1847, and sanctioned by both the Legislative Assembly and the governor, but eventually this was disallowed by the Queen, possibly due to the perceived threat to Ordnance. An act of the Legislative Assembly further facilitated the incorporation of municipalities, and on January 1, 1850, Bytown was incorporated.

==Richmond Landing==

Richmond Landing was a small settlement started in 1809 with Jehiel Collins&#x27; store, which preceded Bytown in present-day Ottawa. It was located just south of Victoria Island east of the present-day Portage Bridge in present-day Lebreton Flats. Wright&#x27;s Town (Hull, Quebec), just across the Ottawa River, also near the Chaudiere Falls, had already been founded by this time.

Collins built a log cabin and store on the south shore of the Ottawa River, near the Chaudière Falls area. Later the property was acquired by Caleb T. Bellows, an assistant in the store. Collins is credited as the first settler of what would become Bytown. And by 1819, the little settlement at the landing got its first tavern operated by the Firths.

The settlement was named Bellows Landing until the fall of 1818, when a group of settlers responsible for the creation of a new road to Richmond, Ontario stayed there. The road became Richmond Road and Richmond Landing acquired its name. Sergeant Hill, had directed the creation of Richmond Road, Ottawa&#x27;s first thoroughfare, a road which contained tree stumps, whose origin likely began at a portage trail bypassing the Chaudière Falls.

Richmond Landing was an area where those heading to and from Richmond could dock and receive correspondence and supplies from the outside world. A tavern constructed in 1819, whose existence had been shown since Bytown&#x27;s earliest maps, was excavated prior to the construction of the Canadian War Museum whose east side currently covers it. Early maps also show the locations of buildings, and a Governmental store, constructed later. A buildings had been requested by early settlers to hold items that had previously been left near or on the dock by boats providing items for the settlements.

==Corktown==

Corktown, not a town at all, was a series of shanties along the &quot;Deep Cut&quot; section of the Rideau Canal in Ottawa which existed during its construction and were erected by some of its Irish labourers. Many of the workers came penniless from County Cork in Ireland, giving it its name. The settlement along both sides of the canal was allowed by Colonel By due to their desperate poverty and inability to pay rent. These men, separated from the others, had done some of the hard labour required of the canal&#x27;s construction. They built turf or log shanties along the muddy bank, and possibly without sanction extended the settlement as far as through the Lower Town swamp and the banks of the Rideau River. Eventually women and children moved to the area living among the approximately 150 houses built by 1829. Corktown disappeared shortly after the completion of the canal, which was under construction between 1826 and 1832.

==Legacy==

*Bytown remains a nickname for Ottawa.
*There is a Bytown Museum in Ottawa in the oldest stone building in the city, built by Thomas McKay, containing artifacts dating back to the Bytown era.
*The name Bytown survives in the name of Bytownite, a calcium-rich plagioclase feldspar mineral, named from its occurrence near Ottawa.
*The ByTowne Cinema, one of Ottawa&#x27;s oldest movie theatres, was originally named the Nelson Cinema, but later renamed to honour the city&#x27;s original name.
*The Rideau Canal remains, a lot of it looks very much like it originally did, and it is a heritage site.
*The Corktown Footbridge was opened on September 21, 2006, in honour of the sacrifices made by the Irish settlers in constructing the Rideau Canal.
*Colonel By&#x27;s house was located in Majors Hill Park; today a monument stands at its location. At the location, unmarked, are two large chunks of the Sappers Bridge.

<doc id="445939" wikidata="Q858434" url="?curid=445939" title="Carcano">
<text>Carcano is the frequently used name for a series of Italian bolt-action, internal box magazine fed, repeating military rifles and carbines. Introduced in 1891, the rifle was chambered for the rimless 6.5×52mm Carcano round (&quot;Cartuccia Modello 1895&quot;). It was developed by the chief technician Salvatore Carcano at the Turin Army Arsenal in 1890, and was originally called the Modello (model) 91 or simply M91. Successively replacing the previous Vetterli-Vitali rifles and carbines in 10.35×47mmR, it was produced from 1891 to 1945. The M91 was used in both rifle (&quot;fucile&quot;) and shorter-barreled carbine (&quot;moschetto&quot;) form by most Italian troops during World War I and by Italian and some German forces during World War II. The rifle was also used during the Winter War by Finland, and again by regular and irregular forces in Syria, Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria during various postwar conflicts in those countries.

The Type I Carcano rifle was produced by Italy for the Japanese Empire prior to World War II. After the invasion of China, all Arisaka production was required for use of the Imperial Army, so the Imperial Navy contracted with Italy for this weapon in 1937. The Type I is based on the Type 38 rifle and retains the Carcano action, but uses the Arisaka/Mauser-type 5-round internal box magazine. The Type I was used primarily by Japanese Imperial Naval Forces and was chambered for the Japanese 6.5×50mm Arisaka cartridge. Approximately 60,000 Type I rifles were produced by Italian arsenals for the Japanese military.

A Carcano M38 was used by Lee Harvey Oswald to assassinate United States President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas.

==History==
Although this rifle is often called &quot;Mannlicher–Carcano&quot;, especially in American parlance, it was officially the 6.5×52mm Mod. 91 rifle. The &quot;Mannlicher&quot; title came from the en bloc loading clips, having nothing to do with the action itself, which was a modified Gewehr 1888 action (which itself was a combination of the action from the Mauser Model 1871 with the Mannlicher en bloc loading); in Italy the rifle was commonly known as the &quot;Mauser-Parravicino&quot;, after General Gustavo Parravicino of the Infantry Shooting School and head of the commission that recommended the Mod. 91 adoption, while Italian soldiers simply called the rifle as the &quot;il novantuno&quot; (the ninety-one).

Until 1938, all M91 rifles and carbines were chambered for the rimless 6.5×52mm Modello 1895 cartridge, using a round-nose metal case bullet of 160 grains weight at approximately 2,000–2,400 ft/s muzzle velocity, depending upon barrel length. At least one small arms authority noted inconsistencies in powder types in arsenal-loaded 6.5×52mm military ammunition, often with different powder types and ammunition lots intermixed within a single clip of ammunition. The practice of intermixing powder types and ammunition lots in clipped rifle ammunition was generally avoided by arsenals of other nations, as it frequently resulted in varying bullet velocities and excessive bullet dispersion on the target.

After reports of inadequate performance at both short and long ranges during the campaigns in Italian North Africa (1924–1934), and the Second Italo-Abyssinian War (1935-1936), the Italian army introduced a new short rifle in 1938, the Modello 1938, together with a new cartridge in 7.35×51mm caliber. In addition to the slightly larger caliber, Italian ordnance designers introduced a spitzer-type bullet for the new cartridge, with the tip filled with aluminum to produce an unstable (tumbling) projectile upon impact in soft tissue (a design most likely copied from the .303 British Mk VII bullet).

However, the Italian government was unable to successfully mass-produce the new arms in adequate quantities before the onset of war, and in 1940, all rifle and ammunition production reverted to 6.5 mm, but no 7.35 mm Mod. 38 rifles nor carbines were ever re-barrelled to the old 6.5×52mm caliber. Some Italian troops serving on the Russian front were armed with 7.35 mm Mod. 1938 rifles, but exchanged them in 1942 for 6.5×52 mm arms.

Approximately 94,500 7.35mm Modello 1938 rifles were shipped to Finland, where they were known as &quot;Terni&quot; carbines (from the Terni stamp with the royal crown, the logo or seal of the &quot;Regia fabbrica d’armi di Terni&quot; arsenal where they were manufactured). They were primarily used by security and line-of-communications troops during the Winter War of 1939–1940, though some frontline troops were issued the weapon. According to reports, the Finns disliked the rifle. With its non-standard 7.35 mm caliber, it was problematic to keep frontline troops supplied with good quality, or any ammunition at all, and its non-adjustable rear sight (fixed for 200 m) made it ill-suited for use in precision shooting at the varied ranges encountered by Finnish soldiers during the conflict. Despite this, it&#x27;s worth noticing that the Finns themselves modified the fixed optics on the rifle to operate from a range of 200 m to only 150 m. Whenever possible, Finnish soldiers discarded the weapon in favor of rifles acquired on the battlefield, including standard models of captured Soviet-made Mosin–Nagant rifles. The latter had the advantage of using commonly available 7.62×54mmR ammunition. By the outbreak of the Continuation War, the remaining Mod. 1938 7.35 mm rifles were issued to the Finnish Navy, as well as anti-aircraft, coastal defense, and other second-line (home front) troops.

In 1941, the Italian military returned to a long-barrelled infantry rifle once again (slightly shorter than the original M91), the Carcano M91/41. True sniper versions never existed, but in World War I a few rifles were fitted with telescopic lenses and issued for service use (World War II scoped rifles were strictly prototypes).

Several lots of Moschetti M91/38 TS (special troops&#x27; carbines) were chambered for the German 7.92×57mm Mauser sS heavy ball round. This modification entered service in 1943, just before the Italian capitulation. According to Rottman, some were converted in 1941, possibly to make use of German ammunition stocks in North Africa, and another batch in 1945, the latter were done so under German orders since some Italian forces continued to fight alongside the Germans after Italy surrendered to the Allies, though it is reported that neither batches ever saw combat, despite unconfirmed claims that some of these conversions were issued to the German Volkssturm (&quot;People&#x27;s Militia&quot;). Rottman also notes that the 7.92 mm caliber pushed the pressure limits the Carcano could handle and users complained about excessive recoil. These conversions don&#x27;t require an en bloc clip, but are loaded with the standard German five-round stripper clips. 

German forces captured large quantities of Carcanos after Italy&#x27;s capitulation in September 1943. It was the most commonly issued rifle to Volkssturm units in late 1944 and 1945.

After World War II, Italy replaced its Carcano rifles first with British Lee–Enfields and then with the U.S. .30 caliber (7.62 mm) M1 Garand semi-automatic rifle, which the Italians labeled the &quot;&#x27;Model 1952 (M52)&quot;. Finland sold all of its approximately 74,000 remaining 7.35 mm M91/38 Carcano rifles on the surplus market. As a consequence, large quantities of surplus Carcanos were sold in the United States and Canada beginning in the 1950s. In Italy, the Polizia di Stato and the Carabinieri retained the &quot;Moschetto 38&quot; TS, retiring it from service in 1981. Captured 6.5mm Carcano rifles were used by Greek forces post-war, with ammunition supplied by U.S. Western Cartridge Co. Some were also converted to 6.5×54mm Mannlicher–Schönauer, one of the standard cartridges of the Greek military at the time.

During the Libyan Civil War in 2011, many rebels went into battle with their personally-owned weapons, including old bolt-action rifles and shotguns. Of these, Carcano-style rifles and carbines have been the most frequently observed style of bolt-action rifle. They were predominantly used by rebels in the Nafusa Mountains. These old weapons saw combat once again due to the rebels&#x27; limited access to modern firearms. Additionally, some Libyan rebels preferred to use their familiar hunting weapons over the more modern, yet unfamiliar, assault rifles available. According to Al-Fitouri Muftah, a member of the rebel military council overseeing the western mountain front, as many as 1 in 10 rebels in the region were armed with World War II-era weapons.

==Variants==
All variants used the same Carcano bolt action, fed by an en-bloc clip; the rifles and carbines had different barrel lengths and differences in stocks and sights depending on barrel length. As noted in the introduction, the word &quot;moschetto&quot; means literally &quot;musket&quot; but was used generally by Italian arms makers as a descriptor of Italian 20th century rifles, often shorter-barrelled rifles in the carbine style meant for other than regular infantry uses. Regular length infantry rifles are named as &quot;fucile&quot; models.

*&quot;Fucile Modello 1891&quot; (Rifle Model 1891), 6.5×52 mm with detachable knife bayonet, barrel, these were adopted on 29 March 1892 as per Ministerial Act No. 57.

* &quot;Moschetto Modello 1891&quot; (Musketoon Model 1891) 6.5×52mm with integral folding bayonet, barrel, these were adopted on 9 June 1893 and under Act No. 116 dated of 15 July 1893 is when the nomenclature became official. These have been referenced as ‘for Cavalry’ &quot;(per Cavalleria)&quot; carbines in both English and Italian lingo however, it is incorrect and no such name has ever been used that called them as such. These were initially made to be issued to Cavalry Troops but were however issued to other troops as well such as the Carabinieri Reali, Bersaglieri Ciclisti, and later to the Paratroopers and the MVSN Troops. Initially these models did not have handguards on them but were added to them as per Circular No.400 dated June 30, 1916. They modified or manufactured new made nose caps for these with a little tab on the top of them to fit the handguard into. As part of this modification process they also had to modify the rear sight assembly on the back where the handguard fit into it. These were made from 1893 well up to 1944, the easiest way to say these are such models is they all have the adjustable rear sight, no matter by which manufacturer made them or what year they were manufactured. 10,000 were made with a PS prefix for police use.
*&quot;Moschetto per Truppe Speciali Modello 1891&quot; (Musketoon for Special Troops Model 1891), 6.5×52 mm with side mounted type (transverse) bayonet, barrel, on 6 January 1900 under Act No.6 these firearms were officially called as such models even though production of these were started in 1898. These were issued to machine gun, mortar and motorcycle crews. These had slings swivels on the bottom of the buttstock and on the nose cap. There two types of handguards and nose caps used on the models, the first was the type where the handguard was not retained by a little tab on the nose cap on the top of them but it was found that these could come off so as per Circular No.124 dated February 25, 1916, they decided to add the little tab to keep them in place.
*&quot;Moschetto Modello 1891 / 1924&quot; (Musketoon Model 1891 / 1924), 6.5×52 mm, barrel, In 1925 they started conversion of the Fuclie Modello 1891 to be shortened as per Circular No. 59 dated January 29, 1925, which specifically says the nomenclature of this firearm shall be &#x27;moschetto mod. 91/24&#x27;. The easiest way to tell this model is that it has the longer adjustable rear sight of the rifle on it, these did not have the smaller shorter adjustable rear sights.
*&quot;Moschetto per Truppe Speciali Modello 1891 Modificato&quot; (Musketoon for Special Troops Model 1891 Modified), 6.5×52 mm, barrel, There were several changes in different years of these in the sling configurations and bayonet mount on the nose cap. They either kept the original sling configuration, got rid of the one the buttstock and filled it in with wood and the one on the nose cap was also removed. They added a sling bar to the left side on the buttstock and on the left side of the stock. They also later decided to use both type of sling configurations on them. The nose caps for these were configured to use the standard 1891 rifle bayonet instead of the side mounted type and in some cases the original nose cap was replaced with the type used on the 1891 / 1924 and using a barrel band they utilized. These have been called as 91/28 models, in no such way, shape or form were these ever called as 91/28&#x27;s, there was a Moschetto Modello 1891 / 1928 model but it was specifically used as the nomenclature of the rifle that was designed to use the Tromblonico grenade launcher. They specifically in the different circulars they wrote on the modification of these firearms, use the word modificato or T.S. modificato, nowhere are they referred to as 91/28&#x27;s.
* &quot;Moschetto per Truppe Speciali con Tromboncino&quot; (&quot;con Tromboncino&quot;, with grenade launcher) Mod. 91/28 (modified 91/28 coupled with a 38.5 mm grenade launcher) barrel.

* &quot;Fucile di Fanteria&quot; Mod. 1938 (&quot;infantry rifle&quot; Model 1938, adopted in 1938 in 7.35×51mm caliber, fixed sights, detachable folding knife bayonet) barrel.

* &quot;Moschetto&quot;s (carbines) Mod. 1938 (folding bayonet) and Mod. 1938 TS (detachable bayonet) carbine versions of Model 1938 short rifle in 7.35×51mm, later reverted to 6.5x52mm, barrel.
* &quot;Fucile di Fanteria&quot; Mod. 91/38 (Model 1938 &quot;infantry rifle&quot; chambered in 6.5×52mm caliber since 1940). The barrel is the barrel of the earlier 7.35 mm caliber, but now changed to 6.5 mm. Unlike the slightly shorter and lighter TS Moschetto, it also has both sling swivels on the left side of the stock, not visible from the right side of the rifle, identifying it as a &quot;Fucile di Fanteria&quot; type. This is the model (stamped &quot;1940&quot; to show manufacture date) owned by Lee Harvey Oswald and determined to be the John F. Kennedy assassination rifle. From 1940, the &quot;Moschetto&quot; Mod. 1938 and Mod. 1938 TS were also made in 6.5×52mm.
* &quot;Fucile di Fanteria&quot; Mod. 91/41 (6.5×52mm &quot;infantry rifle&quot; adopted in 1941, adjustable sights), barrel.
* &quot;Type I Rifle&quot; (6.5×50mm infantry rifle, produced as export for the Imperial Japanese Navy, and had adjustable sights)

==Kennedy assassination rifle==
In March 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald purchased a &quot;6.5 [mm] Italian carbine&quot;, later improperly called a Mannlicher–Carcano (although it uses a Mannlicher-style en bloc clip system), through mail order, for $19.95 (equivalent to $183.90 in 2022.) The advertisement only specified a &quot;6.5 Italian Carbine&quot; and actually shows a Carcano model M91 TS, which was the Carcano carbine model sold through the ad when it was originally placed. However, from a time 11 months before Oswald placed his order, the Chicago sporting goods store from which he purchased it had been shipping the slightly longer Model 91/38 under the same ad, and this is the weapon Oswald received.

On 22 November 1963, Oswald used this weapon to assassinate U.S. President John F. Kennedy. The rifle, made in the Terni arsenal in 1940 and bearing the serial number C2766, was equipped for an extra $7 with a new 4x18 Japanese telescopic sight, on a sheet metal side mount. It was later scrutinized by local police, the FBI, the U.S. Army and two federal commissions. Shooting tests, conducted by those groups and others using the original rifle or similar models, addressed questions about the speed and accuracy with which the Carcano could be fired. Following lawsuits over its ownership, the rifle ended up in storage at the National Archives. The assassination was one of the factors leading to passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968, which banned mail order sales of firearms.

<doc id="445940" wikidata="Q2074025" url="?curid=445940" title="Ishtadevata">
<text>Ishtadeva or ishtadevata (Sanskrit: इष्ट देव(ता), , literally &quot;cherished divinity&quot; from &quot;iṣṭa&quot;, &quot;personal, liked, cherished, preferred&quot; and &quot;devatā&quot;, &quot;godhead, divinity, tutelary deity&quot; or &quot;deva&quot;, &quot;deity&quot;), is a term used in Hinduism denoting a worshipper&#x27;s favourite deity.

It is especially significant to both the Smarta and Bhakti schools, wherein practitioners choose to worship the form of God that inspires them. Within Smartism, one of five chief deities is selected. Even in denominations that focus on a singular concept of God, such as Vaishnavism, the ishta-deva concept exists. For example, in Vaishnavism, special focus is given to a particular form of Vishnu or one of his avataras (i.e. Krishna or Rama). Similarly within Shaktism, focus is given to a particular form of the Goddess such as Parvati or Lakshmi. The Swaminarayan sect of Vaishnavism has a similar concept, but notably holds that Vishnu and Shiva are different aspects of the same God.

==Smarta worship==
The &quot;worship of the five forms&quot; () system, which was popularized by Adi Shankara among orthodox Brahmins of the Smārta tradition, invokes the five deities Ganesha, Vishnu, Shiva, Shakti, and Sūrya. This system was instituted by Adi Shankara primarily to unite the principal deities of the five major sects () on an equal status. The monistic philosophy preached by Adi Shankara made it possible to choose one of these as a preferred principal deity and at the same time worship the other four deities as different forms of the same all-pervading Brahman.

==Worship forms==
Typically a practitioner worships their Ishta-Deva through the form of a murti. This worship may involve offering items to their chosen divinity such as incense or flowers, reciting mantras, singing their names and offering prayers.

Remembering the deity and internally building a relationship with (or through) them is considered essential to the practise. Within the Advaita schools it is believed that the human mind needs a concrete form to understand the divine that ultimately can never be defined. Just as one can understand the abstract concept of a color only after one has seen a concrete form, one can only realize the deity through a form of murti. In contrast, the Dvaita schools believe the Supreme Being to possess a divine form, and offer worship to their Ishta-Deva as either a representation or direct expansion of the Supreme Person. For example, Vaishnava schools offer worship exclusively to murtis of Vishnu, or his associated avatars such as Krishna or Rama.

Shaivites worship Shiva, either figuratively, or through his Lingam murti. As Shaivism contains both monistic and dualistic traditions either (or both) of the above approaches may be applicable.

<doc id="445941" wikidata="Q1118983" url="?curid=445941" title="White Wilderness (film)">
<text>White Wilderness is a 1958 nature documentary film produced by Walt Disney Productions as part of its &quot;True-Life Adventure&quot; series. It is noted for its propagation of the myth of lemming mass suicide.

The film was directed by James Algar and narrated by Winston Hibler. It was filmed on location in Canada over the course of three years. It won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and the Golden Bear for Best Documentary at the 1959 Berlin Film Festival.

== Reception ==
Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Mr. Disney has assembled a fine, often fascinating color documentary on animal life in the North American Arctic&quot;. Geoffrey Warren of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated: &quot;Walt Disney has turned again to Nature for adventure and profit. With &quot;White Wilderness&quot; the master of unusual entertainment has struck pure gold, for this is probably the best of his many true-to-life films&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a fascinating screen experience. Filmed in awesome detail in the icy wastes of the Arctic, where struggle for existence is savage and cruel, this feature is one of the most spectacular of Walt Disney&#x27;s &#x27;True-Life Adventure&#x27; series, and as such can expect handsome returns from its particular market&quot;. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; declared: &quot;From the opening to the closing scenes, one is held enthralled by the truly remarkable shots of polar region wild life, both large and small, made all the more interesting by the fine Technicolor photography, the clever editing and the appropriate background music, which heighten both the comic and dramatic aspects of the different scenes&quot;. &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;The familiar music score, production tricks, anthropomorphic humours and human-angle narration are again in evidence. The basic material, however, remains enthralling; in the case of lemmings and wolverines possibly unique&quot;.

== Controversy ==
&quot;White Wilderness&quot; contains a now-infamous scene that supposedly depicts a mass lemming migration, ending with hundreds leaping into the Arctic Ocean. The narrator of the film states that the lemmings are likely not committing suicide, but rather are in the course of migrating, and upon encountering a body of water are attempting to cross it. If the body of water the lemmings encounter is too wide, they can suffer exhaustion and drown as a result.

In 1982, the CBC Television news magazine program &quot;The Fifth Estate&quot; broadcast a documentary about animal cruelty in Hollywood called &quot;Cruel Camera&quot;, focusing on &quot;White Wilderness&quot; as well as the television program &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot;. The host of the CBC program, Bob McKeown, discovered that the lemming scene was actually filmed at the Bow River near Canmore, Alberta, and further that the same small group of lemmings was transported to the location, jostled on turntables, and repeatedly shoved off a cliff to imply mass suicide. According to a lemming expert, the particular species of lemming is not known to migrate, much less commit mass suicide. Additionally, McKeown revealed that footage of a polar bear cub falling down an Arctic ice slope was really filmed in a Calgary film studio. 

Wildlife photographer and filmmaker James R. Simon – who worked freelance for Disney on numerous &quot;True-Life Adventure&quot; films – is credited as being the person responsible for staging the lemming sequence. The Walt Disney Family Museum maintains that Simon committed the act of cruelty without the knowledge or approval of Walt Disney or anyone else at the Disney studio.

<doc id="445942" wikidata="Q5674582" url="?curid=445942" title="Hartford circus fire">
<text>The Hartford circus fire, which occurred on July 6, 1944, in Hartford, Connecticut, was one of the worst fire disasters in United States history. The fire occurred during an afternoon performance of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus that was attended by 6,000 to 8,000 people. The fire killed at least 167 people, and more than 700 were injured. It was the deadliest disaster ever recorded in Connecticut.

==Background==
In mid-20th century United States, a typical circus traveled from town to town by train, performing under a huge canvas tent commonly called a &quot;big top&quot;. The Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus was no exception, but stood out as the largest circus in the country.

The circus had been experiencing shortages of personnel and equipment as a result of the United States&#x27; involvement in World War II. Delays and malfunctions in the ordinarily smooth order of the circus had become commonplace; on August 4, 1942, a fire had broken out in the menagerie, killing a number of animals. When the circus arrived in Hartford, Connecticut, on July 5, 1944, the trains were so late that one of the two shows scheduled for that day had been canceled. In circus superstition, missing a show is considered extremely bad luck, and although the July 5, 1944, evening show ran as planned, many circus employees may have been on their guard, half-expecting an emergency or catastrophe.

The next day was a Thursday; the crowd at the 2:15 afternoon performance was dominated by women and children. The size of the audience that day has never been established with certainty, but the best estimate is about 7,000.

=== Big top layout ===
The big top could seat 9,000 spectators around its three rings and measured 200 feet wide by 450 feet long. It had 15-foot-high sidewalls and its roof was 48 feet high. The tent&#x27;s canvas had been coated with of paraffin wax dissolved in of gasoline, a common waterproofing method of the time; like all hydrocarbons, both substances are hydrophobic but also highly flammable. The big top had been erected over freshly mowed grass and exposed dirt that had been watered down and then covered with hay and wood shavings. Inside the tent there were three rings and two stages with a 25-foot wide oval shaped track separating the performance area and seating, which could be either bleacher or un-secured folding chairs. One could exit the tent by either a main entrance or eight other smaller exits; however, during the fire many of the alternative exits were blocked by circus wagons or other items.

==The fire==
The fire began as a small flame after the lions performed, on the southwest sidewall of the tent, while The Flying Wallendas were performing. Circus bandleader Merle Evans was said to have been the first to spot the flames and immediately directed the band to play &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot; by John Phillips Sousa, a march that traditionally signaled distress to all circus personnel. Ringmaster Fred Bradna urged the audience not to panic and to leave in an orderly fashion, but the fire had shorted out the power and he could not be heard. Bradna and the ushers unsuccessfully tried to maintain some order as the panicked crowd tried to flee the big top. The ushers also worked to attempt to douse the fire with water jugs that had been stationed in the big top and to pull down the canvas sections that were on fire; after realizing their attempts were futile they began to help evacuate the crowds.

The only animals in the big top at the time were the big cats trained by May Kovar and Joseph Walsh that had just finished performing when the fire started. The big cats were herded through the chutes leading from the performing cages to several cage wagons and were unharmed except for a few minor burns. Though most spectators were able to escape the fire, many people were caught up in the hysteria. Witnesses said some simply ran around in circles trying to find their loved ones rather than try to escape from the burning tent. Some escaped but ran back inside to look for family members. Others stayed in their seats until it was too late, assuming that the fire would be put out promptly. Because at least two of the exits were blocked by the chutes used to bring the show&#x27;s big cats in and out of the tent, people trying to escape could not bypass them.

Survivor Maureen Krekian was 11 at the time of the fire and lived on the same road on which the circus was held. On the day of the event, she was supposed to go to the circus with a neighbor and her daughter. When she went to their house, she found that they had already left without her. She decided to go to the circus on her own, where she seated herself in the bleachers.

I remember somebody yelling and seeing a big ball of fire near the top of the tent. And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down — I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and pulled me out.

As she was being pulled out, Krekian grabbed another little girl&#x27;s arm and pulled her out as well. Frieda Pushnik, who performed with the circus as the &quot;Armless and Legless Wonder&quot;, was rescued by a minstrel show performer who rushed on stage, picked up Pushnik&#x27;s chair and carried her to safety. Pushnik continued to perform with the circus until 1955. Others, such as Judith Shapiro [Cohen], who was about seven years old, were taken higher up into the stands and instructed to jump off the bleachers. Being afraid to do so, Judith refused to jump and instead was pushed off, landing on a chair underneath.

Because of the paraffin wax waterproofing of the tent, the flames spread rapidly, helped by the wind. The waterproofing indeed protected the tent from the rain, but as mentioned before, it rendered the tent highly flammable. Many people were badly burned by melting paraffin raining down from the roof. The fiery tent collapsed in about eight minutes according to eyewitness survivors, trapping hundreds of spectators beneath it. Because of a picture that appeared in several newspapers of sad tramp clown Emmett Kelly holding a water bucket, the event became known as &quot;the day the clowns cried&quot;.

== Victims ==
While many people burned to death, others died as a result of the ensuing chaos. Sources and investigators differ on how many people were killed and injured. Various people and organizations say it was 167, 168, or 169 persons (the 168 figure is usually based on official tallies that included a collection of body parts that were listed as a &quot;victim&quot;) with official treated injury estimates running over 700 people. The number of actual injuries is believed to be higher than those figures, since many people were seen that day heading home in shock without seeking treatment in the city. It is commonly believed that the number of fatalities is higher than the estimates given, due to poorly kept residency records in rural towns, and the fact that some smaller remains were never identified or claimed. Additionally, free tickets had been handed out that day to many people in and around the city, some of whom appeared to eyewitnesses and circus employees to be drifters who would never have been reported missing.

Some died from injuries sustained after leaping from the tops of the bleachers in hopes they could escape under the sides of the tent, though that method of escape ended up killing more than it saved. Others died after being trampled by other spectators, with some asphyxiating underneath the piles of people who fell over each other. Most of the dead were found in piles, some three bodies deep, at the most congested exits. A small number of people were found alive at the bottoms of these piles, protected by the bodies on top of them when the burning big top ultimately fell down.

Notable survivors included; Eunice Groark (first female lieutenant governor of Connecticut), The Flying Wallendas, Charles Nelson Reilly (actor, comedian, and director), actress Jan Miner, (best known for portraying &quot;Madge the Manicurist&quot; in advertising for Palmolive dishwashing detergent), drummer Hal Blaine and Emmett Kelly (renowned circus clown). Those who survived carried the trauma for decades. Seventy years after the fire, Carol Tillman Parrish, who was six at the time, said that &quot;until this day, I can smell the stench of human flesh&quot; as the blaze consumed its victims.

===Little Miss 1565===

The best-known victim of the circus fire was a young blond girl wearing a white dress. She is known only as &quot;Little Miss 1565&quot;, named after the number assigned to her body at the city&#x27;s makeshift morgue. Oddly well preserved even after her death, her face has arguably become the most familiar image of the fire. Her true identity has been a topic of debate and frustration in the Hartford area since the fire occurred. She was buried without a name in Hartford&#x27;s Northwood Cemetery, where a victims&#x27; memorial also stands. Two police investigators, Sgts. Thomas Barber and Edward Lowe, photographed her and took fingerprints, footprints and dental charts. Despite massive publicity and repeated displays of the famous photograph in nationwide magazines, she was never claimed. Barber and Lowe spent the rest of their lives trying to identify her. They decorated her grave with flowers each Christmas, Memorial Day and July 4. After their deaths, a local flower company continued to decorate the grave.

====Proposed identifications====
In 1981, Lowe&#x27;s widow announced that Lowe had identified the child and contacted her family, but they had requested no publicity. In 1987, someone left a note on the 1565 gravestone reading &quot;Sarah Graham is her Name! 7-6-38 DOB, 6 years, Twin.&quot; Notes on nearby gravestones indicated that her twin brother and other relatives were buried close by.

In 1991, arson investigator Rick Davey (along with co-writer Don Massey) published &quot;A Matter of Degree: The Hartford Circus Fire and Mystery of Little Miss 1565&quot;, in which he claims the girl was Eleanor Emily Cook and from Massachusetts. Davey also contends that there was a conspiracy within the judicial system to convict the Ringling defendants, and that Segee was the arsonist. Before writing the book, Davey spent six years researching the case and conducting his own experiments as to how the fire really may have started. He described the original investigation as both &quot;flawed and primitive&quot;, though he did not work on the original case. Eleanor Cook&#x27;s brother Donald Cook had contacted authorities in 1955 insisting that the girl was his sister, but nothing came of it, and Donald later worked with Davey to establish her identity. Donald believes that family members were shown the wrong body in the confusion at the morgue. In 1991, the body was declared to be that of 8-year-old Eleanor Emily Cook, though Cook&#x27;s aunt and uncle had examined the body and it did not fit the description they provided. The Connecticut State Police forensics unit compared hair samples and determined they were probably from the same person. The body was exhumed in 1991 and buried next to her brother, Edward, who had also died in the fire.

====Ongoing questions====
Various assertions put forth in &quot;A Matter of Degree&quot; have been fiercely disputed by investigators who worked on the case, as well as by other writers, most notably Stewart O&#x27;Nan, who published &quot;The Circus Fire: A True Story of an American Tragedy&quot; in 2001. O&#x27;Nan points to the fact that Little Miss 1565 had blond hair while Eleanor Cook was a brunette. The shape of Little Miss 1565&#x27;s face and that of Eleanor Cook are dissimilar, and the heights and ages of the two girls do not match. Perhaps most significantly, when shown a photograph of Little Miss 1565, Eleanor&#x27;s mother Mildred Corintha Parsons Cook immediately stated that it was not that of her daughter. She firmly maintained that stance until her death in 1997, age 91. Badly injured in the fire, Mrs. Cook had been unable to claim her two dead children and was too emotionally traumatized to pursue it later. She had been told that Eleanor was not in any of the locations where bodies were kept for identification. She believed that Eleanor was one of two children who had been burned beyond recognition and remained unidentified. O&#x27;Nan thinks that Eleanor Cook may be body number 1503. He further points to the differences in the dental records of Eleanor Cook and the records made of Little Miss 1565 after her death.

As O&#x27;Nan and others have pointed out, the most likely scenario is that a family claiming a body early on mistakenly identified Eleanor Cook as their own child and that she is buried under that child&#x27;s name. Even when Little Miss 1565&#x27;s picture ran in the papers, the family failed to recognize her as their own because they wished to put the traumatic event behind them. While DNA analysis could end this debate definitively, the logistics of exhuming all of the likely candidates for this potential mix-up make such an undertaking unlikely.

With the true identity of Little Miss 1565 still unresolved for many, the body was exhumed after the release of &quot;A Matter of Degree&quot; and buried in Southampton, Massachusetts, next to the body of Edward Cook, the brother of Eleanor Cook and a victim of the circus fire himself. In 1992, her death certificate was officially changed from the previous identification of &quot;1565&quot;. Since then, the Cook family has raised questions about whether the body is indeed that of Eleanor Cook, and some investigators have come to believe that Eleanor&#x27;s body may have been among the fire&#x27;s unclaimed bodies and was not that of Little Miss 1565.

==Investigation==
The cause of the fire remains unsolved. Investigators at the time believed it was caused by a carelessly flicked cigarette; however, others suspected an arsonist. In 1950, while being investigated on other arson charges, Robert Dale Segee (1929–1997), who was an adolescent at the time of the fire, confessed to starting the blaze. He was never tried for the crime and later recanted his confession.

Although the circus accepted full responsibility for the financial damages, it did not accept responsibility for the disaster itself. The five men charged were brought to trial in late 1944, and four were convicted. Although the four were given prison terms, they were allowed to continue with the circus to its next stop, Sarasota, Florida, to help the company set itself up again after the disaster. Shortly after their convictions, they were pardoned entirely. One of the men, James A. Haley, went on to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives for 24 years.

===Segee&#x27;s confession===
In 1950, Robert Dale Segee of Circleville, Ohio, claimed during a police interview that he was responsible for setting the fire. Following the interview, Segee signed a statement admitting to setting the circus fire, a series of other fires, and several murders since his youth. Segee, a 16-year-old roustabout for the show from June 30 to July 14, 1944, claimed that he had a nightmare in which an American Indian riding on a &quot;flaming horse&quot; told him to set fires. According to police authorities, Segee further stated that after this nightmare his mind went blank, and by the time it cleared the circus fire had been set. Some of Segee&#x27;s hand-drawn images of his bizarre dreams, and images depicting his claimed murders, appeared in &quot;Life&quot; on July 17, 1950.

In November 1950, Segee was convicted in Ohio of unrelated arson charges and sentenced to 44 years of prison time. However, Hartford investigators raised doubts over his confession, as he had a history of mental illness and it could not be proven that he was in Connecticut when the fire occurred. Connecticut officials were also not allowed to question Segee, even though his alleged crime had occurred in their state. Segee, who died in 1997, denied setting the fire as late as 1994 during an interview. Because of this, many investigators, historians and victims believe that the true arsonist—if it had indeed been arson—was never found.

== Legal ==
On July 7, 1944, charges of involuntary manslaughter were filed against five officials and employees of Ringling Bros. Within the ensuing days, the circus reached an agreement with Hartford officials to accept full financial responsibility and pay whatever amount the city requested in damages. The circus paid almost $5,000,000 to the 600 victims and families who had filed claims against them by 1954. All circus profits from the time of the fire until then had been set aside to pay off these claims.

==Aftermath==

In 2002, the Hartford Circus Fire Memorial Foundation was established to erect a permanent memorial to the people killed in the fire. Ground was broken for the monument on July 6, 2004, at the site where the fire occurred.

Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey visited Hartford during its final tour, putting on its final performance there on April 30, 2017.

<text>Cooperative education (or co-operative education) is a structured method of combining classroom-based education with practical work experience.

A cooperative education experience, commonly known as a &quot;co-op&quot; or work-study program, provides academic credit for structured work experiences, helping young people in school-to-work transition.

It falls under the umbrella of work-integrated learning (alongside internships, service learning, and clinical placements) but is distinct, as it alternates a school term with a work term, reflecting a partnership between the academic institution and the employer, intended to advance the education of the student.

Co-op jobs are more in-depth and last a longer period than a traditional internship, making it more valuable to students in the workforce. They allow for more networking opportunities, better income, stronger resume, and an overall unique learning experience.

The University of Waterloo operates the largest post-secondary co-op program in the world, with nearly 20,000 co-op students enrolled over three semesters in more than 120 programs.

== Schneider&#x27;s Foundations ==
While at Lehigh University at the beginning of the 20th century, Herman Schneider (1872–1939), an engineer, architect, and educator, concluded that the traditional learning space or classroom was insufficient for technical students . Schneider observed that several more successful Lehigh graduates had worked to earn money before graduation. Gathering data through interviews with employers and graduates, he devised the framework for cooperative education (1901). About that time, Carnegie Technical Schools, now Carnegie Mellon University, opened and thereby minimized the need for Schneider&#x27;s co-op plan in the region around Lehigh University. However, in 1903 the University of Cincinnati appointed Schneider to their faculty. In 1905 the UC Board of Trustees allowed Schneider to &quot;try this cooperative idea of education for one year only, for the failure of which they would not be held responsible&quot;. The cooperative education program was launched in 1906, and became an immediate success, and the program was kept beyond the one-year allotted. The University of Cincinnati returned to the matter in its September 2005 board meeting, declaring the 100-year trial period of one hundred years of Cooperative Education officially ended, for the success of which the Board resumed full responsibility.

Schneider, beginning from the rank of assistant professor, would rise through the rank of Dean of Engineering (1906–1928) to become interim president (1929–32) of the University of Cincinnati, based largely upon the strength of the co-op program. Throughout his career, he was an advocate for the co-op framework. His thirty years of service to the University of Cincinnati are partly credited for that institution&#x27;s worldwide fame. In 2006, the University of Cincinnati unveiled a statue of Dean Schneider outside the window of his former office in Baldwin Hall.

In 1965, The Cooperative Education and Internship Association (CEIA) created &quot;The Dean Herman Schneider Award&quot; in honor of the contributions made by Dean Schneider to cooperative education. The award is given annually to an outstanding educator from the faculty or administration. In 2006, the University of Cincinnati established the Cooperative Education Hall of Honor &quot;to give a permanent place of honor to individuals and organizations that have made a significant qualitative difference in the advancement of Cooperative Education for the benefit of students.&quot;

In 1909, recognizing the potential of co-op education, Northeastern University began implementing co-op in their engineering program, becoming the second institution in America to do so. By 1921, Antioch College had adapted co-op practices to their liberal arts curricula, leading many to refer to co-op as the &quot;Antioch Plan.&quot; In 1919, the General Motors Institute (GMI) was opened, following this model to train new General Motors hires. This school was later renamed Kettering University.

The Drexel University four-year co-op program launched in the College of Engineering in 1919, with the participation of just three academic majors. This initiative stemmed from the belief of the university founder, Anthony J. Drexel, that Drexel University should prepare its students for successful careers through an education that balanced classroom theory with real-world practice. In 1925, the five-year co-op program took hold in the chemical engineering department, forming the foundation of Drexel&#x27;s cooperative education program. Today, the cooperative education program supports students in more than 75 different disciplines, making it one of the largest programs in the US.

In 1922, Northeastern University emphasized its commitment to co-op by extending it to the College of Business Administration. As new colleges opened at Northeastern, such as the College of Liberal Arts (1935) and the College of Education (1953), they became co-op schools as well. By the 1980s, Northeastern was the acknowledged leader in co-op education worldwide.

In 1926, Dean Schneider invited those interested in forming an Association of Co-operative Colleges (ACC) to the University of Cincinnati for the first convention. The idea took hold and was followed by three more annual conventions. In 1929, the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education, now called the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), formed the Division of Cooperative Engineering Education, incorporating the membership of the ACC .

In 1957, the first Canadian cooperative education program began at the University of Waterloo with an inaugural class of 75. Initially viewed skeptically, this program quickly became a model for other co-op programs across Canada. These programs were based on both the sandwich education model popularized in Britain and the new American co-op programs. Canadian co-op programs generally follow a four-month school system interspersed with four-month work terms. This common system allows employers to hire students from multiple institutions with common timelines and training programs.

In 1961, the Ford and Edison Foundations commissioned a study of cooperative education, published as &quot;Work-study college programs; appraisal and report of the study of cooperative education,&quot; (James Warner Wilson and Edward H Lyons, New York: Harper). This study led to the formation of the National Commission for Cooperative Education (NCCE). NCCE remains today to promote and lobby for cooperative education in the United States. Its membership comprises sponsoring corporations and organizations (not individuals) from academia and business.

Within Canada, the need for connections between co-op programs became clear by 1973. The Canadian Association for Co-operative Education (CAFCE) began with 29 educators from 15 institutions. In its initial form, it did not include any employers or industry representatives. The institutions felt that they should decide on an integrative plan for co-op education prior to admitting employers as members. In 1977, employers, HR representatives, and recruiters began to join CAFCE.

By 1962, about 150 academic institutions used co-op education, in one form or another. Many were outside of engineering. The need for professional support of non-engineering programs became obvious, and the membership of ASEE, in 1963, began the Cooperative Education Association. To reflect its membership more accurately, it was eventually (sometime in the 1990s or early 2000s) renamed the Cooperative Education and Internship Association. It remains today as the professional association for cooperative education outside of ASEE.

Much of those early efforts of NCCE focused on lobbying and promoting cooperative education. In 1965, the federal Higher Education Act provided support specifically for cooperative education. Funding continued from the federal government through 1992 when Congress ended its support of cooperative education. In total, over $220 million was appropriated by the federal government toward cooperative education.

In Canada, regulation of cooperative education programs is overseen by CAFCE. Programs can apply for accreditation after the first class of co-op students has graduated. To be accredited, 30% of the time spent in the program must be devoted to work experience, and each experience must last at least 12 weeks.

In 1979, educators from Australia, Britain, Canada, and the United States (Northeastern&#x27;s President, Kenneth Ryder), met to discuss work-related programs in their respective countries. In 1981 and 1982, this group, headed by President Ryder, convened an international conference on cooperative education. In 1983, several college and university presidents, educational specialists, and employers from around the world (including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, the Philippines, the United States, and the United Kingdom) formed the World Council and Assembly on Cooperative Education to foster cooperative education worldwide. In 1991, it renamed itself the World Association for Cooperative Education (WACE). By 2005, that Association had a membership of over 1,000 individuals from 43 different countries.

== In Australia ==
Cooperative education is common in most Australian high schools and has been integrated into many university courses as a part of making up final grades. Australian institutions often refer to cooperative education as Work Placement, VET, or Prac. All of these involve students going into their chosen field and joining that field for a set number of weeks in unpaid work. This unpaid work goes towards credits for graduation in both schools and universities Australia-wide. The Australian government has been funding this program due to the success of highly regarded applicants who have come from doing work placements. Many companies in Australia are more inclined to hire an individual who has had proper training within their specific field than those who have not, creating many more successful applicants and jobs within Australia.

== In Germany ==
Cooperative education has helped to address social issues.
In Germany, the significance of cooperative education has increased in the last few years. Cooperative education programs now have an important profile in the education system.

In 2013, the importance was underlined in a paper by the Economic Council of the CDU, including a definition of the dual study program.

The council defined two main characteristics:
* Duality: Two learning facilities must be provided: academic studies and vocational training. There should be duality between these facilities with agreements and cooperation in adjusting educational content and goals.
* The academic part is organized by a university of cooperative education and has to meet the criteria defined by the standing conference of education ministers of the 16 German states to be approved as equivalent to education at other state-recognized academic institutions, namely traditional universities and universities of applied sciences.
The goal is to enable dual qualification of academic and skilled worker knowledge with a focus on high academic standards.

=== Delimitation to Vocational Training ===
A cooperative study program is a combination of academic study at a university or vocational college and vocational education. The programs typically lead to a bachelor&#x27;s degree. There are also a few Master&#x27;s programs. Vocational training focuses on practical education. Trade schools focus on educating skilled workers.

=== Development ===
The first cooperative education programs, in terms of studies with integrated practical phases, started in 1970. The next step was the foundation of a new tertiary education institution, a vocational university. That enabled the establishment of a cooperative study program, originally founded in Baden-Württemberg. More people had been graduating from high school with the highest school certificate: &quot;Abitur&quot;. This had led to an increase in the number of students attending university and a decrease in the number of trainees and apprentices in vocational training. On one hand, companies were apprehensive about a lack of skilled workers. On the other hand, there was a need for more experienced workers which were not provided by vocational training, while universities could not provide skilled worker qualifications.

In 1995, the standing conference of education ministers of the 16 German states declared vocational universities as equivalent to universities of applied sciences.

In 1996, the science council recommended an increased focus on cooperative education. There were 45 cooperative programs in 1995, and the number increased to 100 by the year 2000.

In 2004, the conference of education ministers declared vocational universities&#x27; degrees as equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree from a traditional university.

Baden-Württemberg&#x27;s vocational universities were merged as DHBW, cooperative state university Baden-Württemberg in 2009. Other vocational universities were also approved as state universities. From 2004 to 2014, the number of students has increased from 40,982 to 100,739. There were 47,458 companies providing cooperative study programs in 2016, compared to 18,168 in 2004. Small, medium, and large companies have established programs in different departments. Large companies who annually employ many students include Aldi, Bayer, Daimler, Deutsche Bank, Henkel, Hochtief, Lufthansa, Peek &amp; Cloppenburg, SAP, Siemens, and Volkswagen.

There are different dual curriculum programs. The number of courses grew from 512 in 2014 to 1,592 in 2016. They can be summarized in the following areas of study: 38% Engineering, 34% economic sciences, 12% computer sciences, 10% social services, education, healthcare, nursing, 6% others.

=== Perspectives ===
There is a contract between the three participating parties (employee, employer, and university of cooperative education) over the time of the study. Mostly, the employer provides payment which is slightly above the payment for a vocational training. Some companies also pay student fees. Since most universities are public in Germany, there are no student fees, just dues, which are around $400 per semester. There are usually agreements including a guaranteed employment after the program. Therefore, some contracts include terms where students commit to stay with the company for at least two years after the program. Even without guaranteed employment, chances of getting a job are high anyway. Around 72% of students stay with the sponsoring company after studies for at least two to five years. A common issue is that many students want to do their masters afterwards. Not all companies are willing to support a master program, since they argue that the result is sometimes not worth the additional investment.

== In Canada ==
=== Governing Bodies ===
Since 1973, Canada has had a national body representing cooperative education and work integrated learning. This national body used to be called CAFCE (Canadian Association for Co-op Education) and was renamed CEWIL Canada (Cooperative Education and Work Integrated Learning Canada) in 2017. This organization has representatives from Canadian post-secondary institutions and employers who work together to develop resources to promote the highest quality of post-secondary work-integrated learning programs. CEWIL Canada works to establish national standards for WIL programs. The organization also allows for delivery of training opportunities and best practice sharing. CEWIL maintains a national database on WIL with data from more than fifty post-secondary member institutions. CEWIL reports that over 75,000 students are participating in co-operative education programs across the country. Canadian students who work in cooperative education can earn close to $20 per hour and represent a wide range of disciplines and programs, ranging from science, engineering, business, arts and technology.

=== Canadian Terminology ===
Work Integrated Learning (WIL) is the commonly accepted term for a wide range of experiential learning opportunities in Canada. Work Integrated Learning (WIL) is considered to be inclusive of educational  programs  that  incorporate  a workplace-based component that has connections to the classroom through various learning goals designated in the students&#x27; program or curriculum. It is widely accepted that WIL opportunities have value and produce benefit for students and employers, including  employment  readiness  (such  as  gaining  job-related  skills  and  knowing  what  kind  of  job opportunity  a  student would want  to  have after  graduation). Students participating in WIL can experience new environments, tasks, colleagues for typically a shorter period of time. Work Integrated Learning includes Cooperative Education which is typically a paid work experience of three, four, eight, twelve or sixteen months. When surveyed by Miriam Kramer in a study in 2011, 92% of students Agreed or Strongly Agreed that their co-op work term had a positive impact on critical &amp; analytical thinking, problem solving and decision-making skills. In Canada, another grouping of industry and education professionals came together to create The Business Higher Education Roundtable (BHER). The BHER was established by the Business Council of Canada in 2015 and works on two goals: 1. Helping young Canadians transition from higher education to workplaces through collaborative partnerships and post-secondary institutions and 2. Strengthen research and innovation partnerships between Canadian companies and post-secondary institutions. The BHER reports that about half of all Canadian university students take part in some form of WIL and 65-70% of Canadian college students takes part in WIL programs.

=== Cooperative education benefits ===
For the Canadian Post-Secondary Student, it is considered to be a benefit to add a co-operative work term to an undergraduate degree.

==== Studies at the University of Ottawa ====
Jeela Jones completed a qualitative study on students&#x27; co-operative work experience. She states that bringing theoretical concepts out of the classroom and into a related vocational workplace can produce educational benefits. She researched the concept of Connected Learning in co-operative work terms, which is a learning approach where learners gain knowledge through connecting with people and things, while feeling safe in their environments, they can develop themselves. Jones explained the results of her study emphasizing the importance of relationships with supervisors as mentors, who pushed learners beyond their comfort zones. Many students interviewed for this study commented that despite many challenges that were faced in their co-op experience, that it was a worthwhile experience that allowed them to build new skills, meet new industry connections and become increasingly motivated, self-confident and career-oriented.

==== Studies at the University of Toronto ====
A study carried out by Tsang and others examined the effects of cooperative learning in a science class teaching quantitative reasoning skills. The researchers suggest carefully designing tasks to prevent one student from overly relying on another team member. The study found that cooperative learning enables freshmen and sophomores to better apply the quantitative skills they have to new problems. Additionally, students express a preference for the cooperative setting over the individual setting.

==Co-op models==
From its beginnings in Cincinnati in 1906, cooperative education has evolved into a program offered at the secondary and post-secondary levels in two predominant models . In one model, students alternate a semester of academic coursework with an equal amount of time working, repeating this cycle several times until graduation. The parallel method splits the day between school and work, typically structured to accommodate the student&#x27;s class schedule. Thus, like school-to-work (STW), the co-op model includes school-based and work-based learning and, in the best programs, &quot;connecting activities&quot; such as seminars and teacher-coordinator work site visits. These activities help students explicitly connect work and learning.

Other models, such as the sandwich model and the American-style semester model, instead have students work a 40-hour work week for a set amount of time, typically between 12 weeks and six months. After this period is over, students return to the classroom for an academic semester after which they may have another work term. This cycle often repeats multiple times, adding a year or more to the students&#x27; university career. In this model, students&#x27; do not receive a summer break from school but instead are either working or in school for 12 months of the year. Before or during this work experience students may complete activities designed to maximize their learning on the job, such as online workplace conduct courses or reflective activities.

Co-op&#x27;s proponents identify benefits for students (including motivation, career clarity, enhanced employability, and vocational maturity) and employers (labor force flexibility, recruitment/retention of trained workers, and input into curricula) as well as educational institutions and society (ibid.). Beyond informal and anecdotal evidence, however, a familiar refrain in the literature is the lack of well-done research that empirically demonstrates these benefits (; ). identifies some of the research problems for secondary co-op as follows: federal data collection on high school co-op enrollments and completions ceased in the 1980s; some studies use data in which co-op was not isolated from other work experience programs. describe other problems: due to lack of a clear or consistent definition of cooperative education, researchers cannot accurately identify variables and findings cannot be compared; theory is not well developed; theory, research, and practice are not integrated; and co-op research does not adhere to established standards.

Another set of problems involves perceptions of the field and its marginalization. Because of its &quot;vocational&quot; association, co-op is not regarded as academically legitimate; rather, it is viewed as taking time away from the classroom . Experiential activities are necessarily rewarded in post-secondary promotion and tenure systems (except in certain extenuating situations), and co-op faculty may be isolated from other faculty (; ). Despite the current emphasis on contextual learning, work is not recognized as a vehicle for learning . and agree that the field places too much emphasis on placements rather than learning. also decry the focus on administration, logistics, placements, and procedures.

Some institutions are fully dedicated to the co-op ideal (such as Northeastern University, Drexel University, Georgia Institute of Technology, RIT, Kettering University, LaGuardia Community College, and Purdue University). In others, the co-op program may be viewed as an add-on and therefore is vulnerable to cost cutting . Even where co-op programs are strong they can be threatened, as at Cincinnati Technical College when it became a comprehensive community college or LaGuardia during a budget crisis . For students, costs and time to degree completion may be deterrents to co-op participation . Other deterrents may include financial barriers, aversion to moving frequently due to family obligations, or other pressures as well as difficulty managing the job search during a school semester.

==New approaches==
Despite these problems, there is optimism about the future of co-op education; &quot;Social, economic, and historic forces are making cooperative education more relevant than ever&quot; , including emphasis on university-industry-government cooperation, a fluid and demanding workplace, new technology, the need for continuous on-the-job learning, globalization, and demands for accountability . Federal investments in school-to-work and community service have resulted in a number of initiatives designed to provide &quot;learning opportunities beyond the classroom walls&quot; . Because this has always been a principle of co-op, the field is in a position to capitalize on its strengths and the ways it complements other experiential methods in the effort to provide meaningful learning opportunities for students. To do this, however, cooperative education must be redesigned.

For , a new vision involves conceiving, defining, and presenting co-op &quot;as a curriculum model that links work and academics – a model that is based on sound learning theory&quot; (p. 158). suggests affirming the work-based learning principles upon which co-op is based. These principles assert that cooperative education fosters self-directed learning, reflective practice, and transformative learning; and integrates school and work learning experiences that are grounded in adult learning theories.

Fleming (2013) suggests that a new practical and research focus should be on the relationship between educational institutions and employers – institutions should take more initiative when it comes to training supervisors to be effective mentors. This would maximize the success of the work term and the amount the student learns, while also increasing the quality and quantity of the students&#x27; work. Drewery and Pretti (2015) echo this as they call for greater attention on the relationship between the student and the supervisor, explaining that this relationship can greatly impact the students&#x27; satisfaction with the co-op term and the benefits they gain from it.

 also focuses on learning, seeing a need for a paradigm shift from content learning to greater understanding of learning processes, including reflection and critical thinking. Co-op is an experiential method, but learning from experience is not automatic. Therefore, recommends strengthening the reflective component that is already a part of some co-op models. &quot;If co-op is only a vehicle for experience to gain information about the workplace and to link technical knowledge with workplace application, then its effectiveness is not fully developed&quot; . A Higher Education Council of Ontario paper reviewing the University of Waterloo&#x27;s PD programs states that the reflective element of the program is one of the main strengths, as it encourages students to review their own experiences and learn from their work terms. Maureen Drysdale suggests in a 2012 paper that the reflective elements of co-op allow students to increase their career and personal clarity relative to non-co-op students. 

The Bergen County Academies, a public magnet high school in New Jersey, utilizes co-op education in a program called Senior Experience. This program allows all 12th grade students to participate in cooperative education or an internship opportunity for the full business day each Wednesday. Students explore a wide range of career possibilities. This new approach was recognized as an educational best practice and has been adopted as a state educational initiative for 12th grade students.

Wilfrid Laurier University offers a wide variety of Community Service Learning (CSL) courses under the umbrella of Experiential Learning programs. Community Service Learning provides academic credit for participation in a placement within a community service organization. CSL course examples include psychology, human rights and human diversity, youth and children&#x27;s studies, business, kinesiology, global studies, history, health studies, and geography. Completing a CSL placement allows students to blend hands-on learning, community service and classroom learning in one experience. Many learning outcomes can be achieved through Community Service Learning. Examples of learning outcomes include: social responsibility, intellectual growth, leadership development, appreciating diversity, collaboration, career and educational goals, self-awareness and clarified values. CSL placements at Wilfrid Laurier University last approximately 10 weeks and typically involve attending a community organization for two hours/week.

== Negative implications ==
Although there are many benefits to the cooperative education programme, there are some downsides. The negative implications do not fully compromise the number of students undertaking the study, but rather how the programme will affect the government&#x27;s future funding for education. A huge burden that cooperative education brings to the education institution is financial struggles. The financial struggles come from the schools and universities who put pressure on the departments of education for funding to keep the programme going.

Implications directly to the students who participate in cooperative education is mainly based on direct learning at their institution, whether it is school or university. The cooperative education programme takes students away from school or university. As a student misses a consecutive number of school days, they can start to fall behind in school work and will eventually be unable to cope with their workload. For students who attend school and also participate in the cooperative education programme, commonly called Work Placement or VET courses, they are no longer eligible to be granted direct entry into university. This then gives the student an option of TAFE entry, a university certified bridging course or go on to full-time work after completion of graduation.

==Integrating experiential methods==
School-to-work and service learning have also been promoted as ways to link theory and practice through meaningful experiential learning experiences. outlines the similarities between school-to-work and service learning. Although school-to-work, service learning, and co-op have different goals, each of his points also applies to cooperative education:
*Based on the philosophy that learners learn best through active engagement in meaningful activities
*View of students as active learners and producers of knowledge
*Use of such instructional strategies as contextual learning and application of knowledge to real situations
*Requirement for schools to establish formal partnerships with outside entities
*Concern for integrating school experiences and external experiences

The Community Service Scholarship Program at California State University-Fresno combines cooperative education with service learning. Students receive co-op/internship credit and scholarships for completing a placement at a community service site . As in traditional co-op work placements, students get real-world training, opportunities to explore career options, and enhanced employability skills such as communication, problem solving, and leadership as well as awareness of community and social problems. Combining co-op and service learning thus prepares students for roles as workers and citizens.

Research on highly successful co-op programs in Cincinnati and at LaGuardia Community College shows that they share the basic philosophy and fundamental characteristics of the educational strategy of school-to-work. The reconceptualization of co-op should recognize and build upon this connection. At the same time, lessons from successful co-op programs can benefit the broader STW movement.

There is a need for broader definition of acceptable models for integrating work and learning. and identify a variety of work-based learning activities taking different names: co-op, internships, externships, apprenticeship, career academies, etc. Work-based learning programs should look for connections and develop collaborative relationships. The alternating and parallel co-op models may not meet the needs of returning adult students and dislocated workers needing retraining . Alternatives such as extended-day programs emphasizing mentoring should be considered.

Connecting activities to integrate school- and work-based learning are an essential part of STW. At LaGuardia, the required co-op seminar helps students make connections by giving them a structure within which to reinforce employability skills, examine larger issues about work and society, and undertake the crucial activities of critical reflection .

 and found that the value of cooperative education is embedded in the culture of the institution (LaGuardia) and the region (Cincinnati). In this supportive culture, employer support does not have to be repeatedly obtained and there are clearly understood long-term expectations on all sides (schools, employers, students). This &quot;informal culture of expectations around work-based learning may be more powerful in the long run than a complex set of regulations and bureaucratic requirements&quot; .

However, even LaGuardia has found it difficult to sustain co-op culture over time . &quot;The only way in which STW programs can find a permanent place in schools and colleges is for the work-based component to become so central to the educational purposes of the institutions that it becomes as unthinkable to give it up as it would be to abandon math, English, or science&quot; .

 believes that the answer lies in going beyond reconceiving co-op as an &quot;educational strategy, pedagogy, model, methodology, or curriculum&quot; . She asserts that it is time for cooperative education to develop and define its body of knowledge, investigate its unique phenomena-e.g., the concept of learning from experience, and clarify and strengthen the qualifications of co-op practitioners. For , cooperative education is inherently committed to improving the economy, people&#x27;s working lives, and lifelong learning abilities. It can thus position itself to serve the experiential learning needs of students into the 21st century.

Cates and Cedercreutz (2008) demonstrate that the assessment of student work performance as pursued by co-op employers, can be used for continuous improvement of curricula. The methodology, funded by the Fund for Postsecondary Education (FIPSE) has been developed to a level allowing institutionalization. The methodology could, when implemented over a larger front, provide a substantial competitive advantage for the entire field.

==Examples==


*Work-study (federally subsidized campus employment) in the later twentieth century became a formal and major component of Student financial aid in the United States.
*The University of Waterloo has a cooperative education program with more than 19,000 students enrolled in co-op programs and more than 5,200 active co-op employers. Their five-year co-op program includes twenty four months of work experience. Enrolling in the co-op program at the University of Waterloo does not guarantee co-op employment. The school requires students to have a minimum of sixteen to twenty months of valid work experience (depending on the program of study) to successfully complete their academic program. Despite a high percentage of employment via the coop program, many students obtain employment by other methods, including a student&#x27;s personal networks and unpaid full-time volunteering positions.
*Since its inception in 1975, the cooperative education program at Simon Fraser University (SFU) has grown to more than 8,400 students seeking paid work experiences across the globe. SFU&#x27;s co-op programs span the faculties of Applied Sciences, Arts &amp; Social Sciences, Business, Communication, Art &amp; Technology, Education, Environment, Health Sciences, and Science. The university has worked with over 6,000 employers worldwide. An SFU student has won the Canada-wide title &quot;Co-op Student of the Year&quot; four times.
*Wilfrid Laurier University and the Lazaridis School of Business &amp; Economics provide a co-op business program with a competitive entry limited to about one-third of the students who start the BBA program in their first-year. It offers three four-month work terms. Additionally, the school offers a co-op MBA program for high calibre students with less than two years of work experience.
* The University of British Columbia&#x27;s cooperative education program includes over three thousand students from the faculties of Arts, Commerce, Engineering, Forestry, Kinesiology, and Science. 
* The University of Victoria (UVic)&#x27;s cooperative education program offers hands-on learning for close to half of UVic students, with the number growing each year. Optional or mandatory co-op is available in almost every academic discipline. All UVic co-op students complete a professional practice course prior to their first work term, including intercultural training to help them contribute positively to diverse workplaces. Students also reflect on each work term experience using a competency-based framework. UVic&#x27;s Co-op Program includes dedicated support for Indigenous and international students, and has developed unique international co-op exchange partnerships with employers and post-secondaries around the globe. The program launched in 1976. 
*All Antioch College students participate in the college&#x27;s Co-Op Program as part of their academic requirements for graduation. Under the program, students spend a total of four twelve-week terms, distributed throughout their undergraduate years, working as paid, full-time employees in local, national, or international settings. The program at Antioch, which is located in Yellow Springs, Ohio, began in 1921.
* The University of New South Wales (NSW) in Sydney provides an industry linked Co-op Scholarship. Students receive a scholarship of A$17,000 per annum for each year of their degree and current offerings span twenty four areas in business, engineering, science, and the built environment. Along with industry experience, the Co-op Program incorporates leadership and professional development in addition to networking and mentoring opportunities.
* The Florida Institute of Technology has a condensed cooperative education program allowing students to graduate in four years with three-semester work terms. This program is only followed by engineering students and requires students to take online coursework while they are working full-time as a cooperative education student.
*Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania has one of the nation&#x27;s oldest, largest, and best-known cooperative education programs. 91% of undergraduate students in over 75 majors participate in the co-op program. During their time at Drexel, students experience up to three different co-ops and gain up to 18 months of working experience. With over 1,700 employers in its network, Drexel&#x27;s cooperative education program connects students with industry leaders across 35 states and 45 countries. Drexel&#x27;s cooperative education program allows students to not only explore future careers, but also bring their cooperative education experiences back to the classroom. As a result of cooperative education, Drexel students graduate having already built a professional network, and they typically receive higher starting salaries than their counterparts from other schools. Students may also elect to participate in a Research Co-op to prepare them for a career in research or graduate school or an Entrepreneurship Co-op that will, in collaboration with the Close School of Entrepreneurship, assist them in establishing their own ongoing business. Specialized co-op experiences are also offered at the graduate level.
*Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts has a cooperative education program started in 1909. The program places about five thousand students annually with more than 2,500 co-op employers in Boston, across the United States, and around the globe. A student graduating from Northeastern with a five-year bachelor&#x27;s degree has a total of eighteen months of internship experience with up to three different companies. 
* Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) began cooperative education in 1912. 
* Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) started cooperative education in 1912. 
*Kettering University in Flint, Michigan, enrolls students in cooperative education from their first year on campus, specializing in engineering, science, and management degree programs.
* Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW) (Germany) has a cooperative education program with more than 34,000 students (2016) enrolled and more than 9,000 co-op employers. The three-year co-op undergraduate programs include one and a half year of compulsory internships. DHBW offers job integrated learning (JIL) programs only. In JIL, every DHBW student has to be employed by a single company during the complete duration of the study program. Lectures and compulsory internships are geared to maximize applied learning. Founded on March 1, 2009, DHBW traces its roots back to the Berufsakademie Baden-Wuerttemberg (founded 1974).
*Steinbeis Center of Management and Technology of Steinbeis University Berlin offers an international masters program (Master of Business Engineering) for graduates and young professionals which integrates practical and theoretical learning, along with on the job training by managing projects for a sponsoring company.
* Wentworth Institute of Technology has a two-semester cooperative education program with an optional third semester in the sophomore summer. Every student in the institute is required to do two co-ops. Cooperative education has been active since 1975 with over one thousand students in a co-op each year.
*EPUSP - Escola Politecnica da Universidade de São Paulo offers cooperative education in São Paulo, Brazil.
*TOBB University of Economics and Technology offers cooperative education in Ankara, Turkey.
*Purdue University has a top ten-ranked cooperative education program that was established in 1964. Originally exclusive to students in the College of Engineering, the co-op program is now available to students in 48 different disciplines in 8 of the academic colleges on campus. Purdue offers 5-session and 3-session co-op programs but differs from most universities in that students spend all 5 or 3 work sessions with the same employer, earning raises and gaining progressive responsibilities for each subsequent work rotation, for a total of 12–16 months of work experience. Both programs are 5-year academic programs, though students only pay tuition while studying on campus and pay a small administrative fee during each co-op work rotation. As of July 2014, there were over 600 students enrolled in co-op programs and over 500 qualified employers with locations around the nation and across the globe.
*To complete a bachelor of education at any Australian university, the individual must complete a minimum of 36 weeks of Practicum in a school faced environment doing work placement in their desired field, which includes helping the teacher to teaching a fully planned out class. 
*For Australian high school students who are not completing ATAR courses, work placement is highly encouraged to gain necessary credits to complete graduation

<doc id="445947" wikidata="Q7010252" url="?curid=445947" title="New Mexico State Penitentiary riot">
<text>The New Mexico State Penitentiary riot, which took place on February 2 and 3, 1980, at the Penitentiary of New Mexico (PNM) south of Santa Fe, was the most violent prison riot in U.S. history. Inmates took complete control of the prison and twelve officers were taken hostage. Several inmates were killed by other prisoners, with some being tortured and mutilated because they had previously acted as informants for prison authorities. Police regained control of PNM 36 hours after the riots had begun. By then, thirty-three inmates had died and more than two hundred were treated for injuries. None of the twelve officers taken hostage were killed, but seven suffered serious injuries caused by beatings and rapes.

There had been riots at PNM before it moved in 1956, the first occurring on July 19, 1922, and the second on June 15, 1953.

==Causes==
The causes of the riot are well documented. Author Roger Morris wrote that &quot;the riot was a predictable incident based on an assessment of prison conditions.&quot; Prison overcrowding and inferior prison services, common problems in many correctional facilities, were major causes of the disturbance. On the night of the riot, there were 1,156 inmates in a prison that had beds for fewer than 963. First-time non-violent prisoners were not adequately separated from repeat violent prisoners. Many were housed in crowded, unsanitary dormitories. PNM&#x27;s food was of poor quality, a problem which was exacerbated by the prevalence of cockroaches and mice. Intestinal diseases were common. A visiting warden reported PNM as the filthiest institution he had ever seen.

Another cause was the cancellation of educational, recreational and other rehabilitative programs. When the educational and recreational programs were stopped in 1975, prisoners had to be locked down for long periods. These conditions created strong feelings of deprivation and discontent in the inmate population that would increasingly lead to violence and disorder.

Inconsistent policies and poor communications meant relations between officers and inmates were increasingly in decline. These patterns have been described as paralleling trends in other U.S. prisons as populations started to grow in the 1970s. The Attica prison riot was organized with solidarity among prisoners, demonstrated by their lack of interest in attacking one another, whereas the &quot;snitch system&quot; in the New Mexico Penitentiary pitted inmate against inmate, resulting in the distrust among inmates unless identified with a group.

Following a change in prison leadership in 1975, the penitentiary experienced a shortage of trained correctional staff. A subsequent investigation by the state attorney general&#x27;s office found that prison officials began coercing prisoners to become informants in a strategy known as &quot;the snitch game&quot;. The report said that retribution for snitching led to an increased incidence of inmate-on-inmate violence at the prison in the late 1970s.

There had been several disturbances at the prison prior to the riot. In 1976, a work strike was organized by inmates as a response to the prison&#x27;s poor conditions. In an attempt to subdue the protestors, Deputy Warden Robert Montoya authorized the use of tear gas against the striking prisoners. As they exited the dormitory coughing from the gas, “they were stripped naked and run nearly a hundred yards down the central corridor through a gauntlet of officials who beat them with ubiquitous ax handles. Called &#x27;the night of the ax handles&#x27;, the incident was corroborated by several eyewitnesses, including some officials themselves, and resulted in serious injuries as well as a federal lawsuit, still pending in 1982, naming deputy warden [Montoya] and a senior guard captain among the assailants&quot;. After this violent response to prisoners&#x27; concerns, one inmate, Dwight Duran, was prompted to draft a 99-page handwritten civil rights complaint to the US District Court of New Mexico called Duran v Apodaca, later to become the Duran Consent Decree. There was ample evidence from over ten grand jury investigations (between 1977 through 1979) about the conditions at the penitentiary, but the PNM administration resisted the changes and the legislature refused to allocate the necessary funds to make changes. The last time the US District Court grand jury ordered improvements was in November 1979, two months before the riot.

There have been conflicting reports about the inmate population at the time of the riot and the official capacity of the prison that weekend. According to the Report of the Attorney General on the February 2 and 3, 1980, Riot at the Penitentiary of New Mexico (PART I: The Penitentiary, the Riot, the Aftermath - Appendix C1) published the June after the riot, the design capacity of the penitentiary was 1,058, based on the Phase II Technical Report: Facilities Inventory of the 1977 New Mexico Corrections Master Plan. However, that number included the 60 beds in Cell Block 5, which was closed for renovations. It also included the 24 beds in the Annex and the 32 beds in the Modular Unit, both outside of the main facility. The official number of beds available, therefore, on the night of the riot was actually 974, but even that number is hardly fair as it includes the 11 solitary confinement cells in the basement of Cell Block 3. The official population of the prison the night of the riot was determined to be 1,156.

==Hostages taken==
The riot began with many of the prisoners intoxicated from homemade liquor they brewed inside the prison. Inmate Gary Nelson, assigned to E2 bunk 2, heard the plan to jump the guards if they did not lock the door to the dorm during the 1:00 a.m. count.

The routine for the count began with two officers entering the dormitory. A third officer was given all the other officers&#x27; keys and locked the door to the dorm until the officers were ready to come out. The dayroom was 60 feet all the way down to the far side of the dorm. The TV needed to be turned off and the dayroom locked. Because of overcrowding, the two officers went down two sides of a center aisle consisting of single beds the length of the dorm. As one officer looked down to the right between the rows of bunk beds, the other officer looked down to the left between the rows of bunks. At the last second, the shift commander entered E2 to help with the count. After he was let in, the officer outside the door did not latch it. The prisoners on the bunks by the door had to keep the door open, otherwise all they would accomplish was the taking of three officers locked in their own dorm.

On Saturday morning at 1:40 a.m., February 2, 1980, on cue, two prisoners in southside Dormitory E2 overpowered the officer before he closed the door. Including the officer manning the door, this meant the prisoners took four officers hostage. They also had escaped E2 dorm. They rushed out and overpowered the other officers engaged in shutting down the Cell Blocks at the south end of the prison. At this point the riot might have been contained if the grille to the south wing had been closed and locked. Officers Larry Mendoza and Antonio Vigil, who were eating breakfast in the officers&#x27; mess hall, heard men&#x27;s voices in the main corridor. A prisoner in an officer&#x27;s uniform was standing by the open grille, apparently guarding it. Approaching the grille marching north was a hallway filled with prisoners. The officers soon realized the vulnerability of the grille being open as this meant the path lay wide open for the inmates to attack the control center. They both ran to the control center and warned the officer of the situation. The north grille beside the control center had also routinely been left open most nights. The two officers took refuge in the north wing of the prison. The control center closed and locked the north grille behind them.

By 2:05 a.m. the inmates had gained complete control of the prison by smashing the supposedly bulletproof plate glass window of the control center with a heavy brass fire extinguisher. This gave them access to lock and door controls. However, since they did not know how to open the cell doors automatically from the control center, Cell Houses 1, 2, and 6 had to be opened manually.

==Violence ensues==
Events spiraled out of control within the cell blocks in large part due to the actions of two gangs. The first were the Chicanos, who protected each other and dished out targeted retribution for specific grudges. The other gang was loosely labeled the Aryan Brotherhood and was led by some of the most dangerous inmates (who by this time had been released from segregation in Cell Block 3). They decided to break into Cell Block 4, which held prisoners labeled as informers. Cell Block 4 also housed inmates who were mentally ill, convicted of sex crimes, or otherwise vulnerable, and held a total of 96 prisoners. Initially, after taking over the control center, the call was to immediately take revenge on the snitches at the far north of the prison. However, to get there, they had to pass the Psychology Wing. Multiple prisoners broke in to find stores of drugs purchased in bulk. The drugs were not only consumed but emptied into shoe boxes to distribute to the other prisoners. Then they set a fire in the psychology office in order to destroy the psychology records that had been used to keep some prisoners from obtaining parole.

The first to arrive at Cell Block 4 found they did not have the keys to enter the cellblock. The rioters found blowtorches in nearby Cell Block 5, which had been brought into the prison for construction purposes. They used the blowtorches to cut through the security grilles into Cell Block 4 over the next five hours. It was going to take hours to cut through the bars to enter the cell block, so several inmates left to raid the records office to look for files that would identify who the informers were. Before sunrise Friday, rioters with walkie-talkies began detailing their plans to harm those in Cell Block 4 to prison officials over the radio, but no action was taken. One official stated, &quot;It&#x27;s their ass,&quot; when overheard speaking about the men in the segregation facility. Locked in their cells, the segregated prisoners called to the State Police outside just beyond the fence, pleading for them to save them. Waiting officers did nothing despite there being a back door to Cell Block 4, which would have offered a way to free them. As the door was intended only for emergency use and therefore never opened, the keys were not readily available. State Police agreed with the prison negotiators not to enter the prison as long as the officers being held hostage were kept alive.

As dawn broke, an &#x27;execution squad&#x27; finally cut through the grille and entered the rows of cells. The security panel controlling the cell doors just inside the grille was burned off, meaning each cell would have to be opened with blowtorches one at a time. When opened, victims were pulled from their cells to be tortured, dismembered, hanged, or burned alive. By 10:00 am 12 of the 96 prisoners in Cell Block 4 had been identified as “snitches” and brutally murdered. In total, sixteen inmates were killed in Cell Block 4, with most of the violence committed by noon that day.

During an edition of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Timewatch&quot; program, an eyewitness described the carnage in Cell Block 4. They saw an inmate held up in front of a window; he was being tortured by using a blowtorch on his face and eyes until his head exploded. Another story was about Mario Urioste, who was jailed for shoplifting. He was originally placed by officers in a violent unit where he was gang-raped by seven inmates. Mario had filed a lawsuit against his rapists, so prison officials had housed him in Cell Block 4 for his own protection. Urioste was one of the targets for revenge. His body was found hanged, with his throat cut and his dismembered genitals stuffed into his mouth. In all, 16 inmates died in Cell Block 4.

Men were killed with piping, work tools, and crude homemade knives called shanks. One man was partially decapitated after being thrown over the second-tier balcony with a noose around his neck. The corpse was then dragged down and hacked up. A fire had been set in the gymnasium to burn a pile of corpses, but it had got out of control and burned through the roof. Besides the fire that had been set in the Psychology Wing, a fire was also set in the Protestant Chapel. The Protestant Chaplain had been nicknamed &quot;Ax Handle&quot; for his participation in the Night of the Ax Handles four years earlier. The Catholic Chapel next door was left untouched. Situated across the hall from the main control center, the prison library also was only touched by smoke. A third fire had been set in the records office, burning all records that could have been used as evidence related to the prisoners&#x27; civil rights claims in the Duran Consent Decree.

==Negotiations begin==
When the riot broke out, prisoners had taken the officers&#x27; two-way radios as well as their keys. At 1:57 am the control room heard the first recorded radio transmission by an inmate with a radio, “We got the shift commander hostage. There had better be a meeting with the governor, the news media and (Deputy Secretary of Corrections and former warden Felix) Rodriguez.” &quot;…the future course of the uprising will frequently be aimless and wild, with shifting and uncertain leadership, and often politics will be an apparent afterthought. Yet this clipped ultimatum will be testimony that the larger cause is always there. The inmate on the radio knows well…it is King and Rodriguez who will decide the fate of any reform, and they will be held accountable - if at all – by the media.” About thirty minutes after the riot began, Warden Jerry Griffin joined Deputy Warden Robert Montoya and Superintendent of Correctional Security Emanuel Koroneos at the gatehouse beneath Tower 1. Griffin, Montoya and Koroneos decided to attempt to negotiate the release of the hostages. Montoya contacted inmates at about 2:30 a.m. to initiate negotiations, first using a two-way radio in his car, then a hand set from the gate house. Montoya&#x27;s earliest contact was with an inmate who had been involved with the initial takeover in Dorm E2 and apparently had control of the shift captain throughout the riot. This inmate identified himself as &quot;Chopper One&quot;. As Montoya established contact with one inmate, other inmates transmitted conflicting messages, contradicted other inmate &quot;spokesmen&quot;, or argued among themselves over the airwaves. Only the radio communications were recorded.

Deputy Warden Robert Montoya had recently taken a course in San Francisco on crisis intervention and a defiant Warden Jerry Griffin deferred to the aggressive deputy warden to negotiate with the inmates by radio for the time being until Rodriguez could be found. Griffin phoned Governor Bruce King at 3:00 a.m. that negotiations were under way and the governor agreed that they should talk rather than retake. He, too, had no choice. A little after 4:00 a.m. a Corrections Department aide finally reached Rodriguez on the telephone. The acting secretary arrived at the penitentiary about 5:00 a.m. and immediately took command.

Saturday morning, between six and seven o&#x27;clock, the radio negotiators jockeyed. Inmates asked for a doctor to treat injured guards. Montoya refused and instead asked for the release of wounded hostages. He also denied demands for a media parley and for his resignation. At 8:30 a.m. a field phone was installed to relieve the confusion of multiple walkie-talkies being used by unknown voices. This caused confusion identifying an inmate spokesman. Roger Morris on page 125 identified Don Stout as providing the first written demands. &quot;The first document of the negotiation is clear: &#x27;reduce overcrowding...comply with all court orders...no charges to be filed against inmates...due process in classification procedures...&quot; By Saturday afternoon, four inmates were identified as inmate spokesmen. One of them was Lonnie Duran, who had been in solitary when the riot broke out. He had been one of the inmates (with Dwight Duran, no relation) who worked on the Duran Consent Decree since it was filed in New Mexico US District Court in 1977 outlining a raft of prison grievances.

When Lonnie Duran was accepted by Rodriguez as one of the four inmate spokesmen, the inmates repeated eleven demands from the Duran Consent Decree concerned with basic prison conditions including overcrowding, use of solitary confinement, protesting the loss of educational services, and elimination of programs. The prisoners then demanded to speak with independent federal officials and members of the news media.

Some of the officers held hostage were protected and fed by inmates. Two officers, disguised as inmates, were escorted out of the prison by sympathetic inmates. Two officers who had been brutally beaten and raped were carried out on blanket stretchers because the prisoners did not want an officer to die while in their custody. Seven officers suffered severe injuries. &quot;One was tied to a chair. Another lay naked on a stretcher, blood pouring from a head wound.&quot;

Negotiations broke off Saturday evening and resumed in the early hours of Sunday morning. The negotiations were not recorded. The government negotiators&#x27; strategy was to win control of the prison by stalling.

==Order restored==
By mid-afternoon, Sunday, 36 hours after the riot had begun, heavily armed State Police officers accompanied by officers from the Santa Fe Police Department entered the charred remains of the prison.

Official sources state that at least 33 inmates died. Some overdosed on drugs, while others were murdered. Twelve of the victims had been housed in the Protective Custody Unit. More than two hundred inmates were treated for injuries. An investigation by a citizens&#x27; panel concluded that the riot was initiated by a small number of inmates. Ray Powell of Albuquerque chaired a panel named by Governor Bruce King and Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico Attorney General, to assist in the investigation. He concluded that the majority of the inmates were trying to flee from the riot. Powell said the report was based on hundreds of interviews with those involved in the riot and added, &quot;There is one point that comes through time and again, and that is that the riot was started and conducted by a small number of inmates.&quot;

After the surrender, it took days before order was maintained enough to ensure that inmates could reoccupy the prison.

==Deaths==
The official death toll included 33 people. Of them, 24 were Hispanic, 7 were white, 1 was an African American, and 1 was Indigenous. In comparison, the inmate population at the Penitentiary of New Mexico during this time was 49% Hispanic, 38% White, 10% Black, and 3% Indigenous.
Author Roger Morris suggests the death toll may have been higher, as a number of bodies were incinerated or dismembered during the course of the mayhem. Several inmates died of drug overdoses after having raided the prison pharmacy.

==Legacy==
A few inmates were prosecuted for crimes committed during the uprising, but according to author Roger Morris, most crimes went unpunished. The longest additional sentence given to any convict was nine years. Nationally known criminal lawyer William L. Summers led the defense team in defending dozens of inmates charged in the aftermath. In 1982, Summers received the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers Robert C. Heeney award for his work in defending the inmates prosecuted with regard to the riot.

Before and after the riots, Governor King&#x27;s administration resisted attempts to reform the prison. One federal lawsuit that had been filed was handwritten by inmate Dwight Duran. He lost an inmate friend he had known since childhood after being beaten by guards four years before the riot. Even though his case was supported by the U.S. District Court, actual reforms were held up by negotiations for almost two decades. Actions were not settled until the administration of Governor Toney Anaya (former District Attorney) seven years later. Much of the evidence was lost or destroyed during and after the riot. However, systemic reforms after the riot were undertaken following the &quot;Duran v. King&quot; consent decree, which included implementation of the Bureau Classification System under Cabinet Secretary Joe Williams. The prison reform work from the Duran case developed the modern correctional system in New Mexico.

In 1989, the Bay Area thrash band Exodus memorialized the riot in &quot;The Last Act of Defiance&quot;, the lead-off track of the album &quot;Fabulous Disaster&quot;.

The 2001 documentary &quot;Behind Bars: Riot in New Mexico&quot; covers the incident.

By 2013 the state began conducting tours of the old prison.

<text>T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents is a fictional team of superheroes that appeared in comic books originally published by Tower Comics in the 1960s. They were an arm of the United Nations and were notable for their depiction of the heroes as everyday people whose heroic careers were merely their day jobs. The series was also notable for featuring some of the better artists of the day, such as Wallace Wood and Gil Kane. The team first appeared in &quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot; #1 (cover-dated Nov. 1965). The team name is an acronym for The Higher United Nations Defense Enforcement Reserves. The team has appeared in several versions via several publishers since the early 1980s.

==Publication history==
===Tower Comics===
&quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot; was a bimonthly comic book published by Tower Comics. It ran for 20 issues (Nov. 1965 – Nov. 1969), plus two short-lived spin-off series starring the most popular super agents (Dynamo and No-Man). To launch the project, Wallace Wood huddled with scripter Len Brown (and possibly Larry Ivie) on a superhero concept Brown had described to Wood a year earlier. Brown recalled: &quot;Wally had remembered my concept and asked me to write a 12-page origin story. I submitted a Captain Thunderbolt story in which he fought a villain named Dynamo&quot;. With a few changes by Wood and a title obviously inspired by the success of the spy-fi television series &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; and the then-current James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot;, the series got underway. Tower Comics went out of business in 1969, and the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents went into limbo.

===JC Comics===
In 1981 the rights to &quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot; were bought by John Carbonaro, who published two issues of a new series in the early 1980s under his JC Comics line, the storyline of which concluded in &quot;Blue Ribbon Comics&quot; #12, published by Archie Comics&#x27; Red Circle Comics line.

===L. Miller &amp; Son, Ltd.===
Meanwhile, in the UK, L. Miller &amp; Son, Ltd., and some of its successors published large monthly compendiums of uncolored American superhero comics up until the 1980s, often reproducing &quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot; material.

===Texas Comics===
In 1983, the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents appeared in Texas Comics&#x27; &quot;Justice Machine Annual&quot; #1, written by William Messner-Loebs, with art by Bill Reinhold, Jeff Dee, and Bill Anderson.

===Deluxe Comics===
In 1984, David M. Singer&#x27;s Deluxe Comics began publishing a new series, &quot;Wally Wood&#x27;s T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot;, featuring some of the best artists of the era, including George Pérez, Dave Cockrum, Keith Giffen, Murphy Anderson, Steve Ditko, Rich Buckler, and Jerry Ordway. Singer claimed that the group was in the public domain. A lawsuit by Carbonaro claimed otherwise. The lawsuit was eventually decided in U.S. District Court in favor of Carbonaro, with Singer acknowledging Carbonaro&#x27;s registered copyrights and trademark. Under the decision, Carbonaro also received, among other things, an assignment of all rights to &quot;Wally Wood&#x27;s T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot;, and an undisclosed sum of money. Deluxe Comics closed its doors in 1986 when several major distributors failed to pay sizeable past-due invoices.

===Solson Publications===
In 1987, Solson Publications produced one issue of &quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R.&quot;, a planned four-issue miniseries which was never completed. A second issue was almost finished. This series was not quite set in the same universe as the original series and took the characters in a different direction.

===1990s===
In the early 1990s, Rob Liefeld stated that he had the rights to publish &quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot;, and advanced Dave Cockrum money to illustrate the series through Liefeld&#x27;s Extreme Studios. Ads for a &quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot; series appeared in Extreme Studios and Maximum Press books cover-dated February 1996, indicating that the series would feature &quot;stories by Rob Liefeld, Jim Valentino, Stephen Platt, Chap Yaep and Dan Fraga&quot;.

Another revival was attempted by John Carbonaro in Penthouse Comix&#x27;s &quot;Omni Comix&quot; #3 (1995).

===21st century===

In the early 2000s, DC Comics planned to release a new &quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot; series under license from Carbonaro. Work for about two issues of a new series was completed, but Carbonaro put a stop to it as it made radical alterations to the characters. DC failed to create a series in line with the original series and tone, but began publishing reprints of the original Tower series in their hardcover &quot;DC Archive Editions&quot; format in a total of six volumes. After Carbonaro died in early 2009, DC acquired the rights from his estate the same year. At that point, &quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot; was planned to be brought into the DC Universe, as DC had recently done with the Milestone Media and MLJ Comics heroes.

A new series began publishing in November 2010 with a creative team of writer Nick Spencer and artist CAFU. The team consists of the original NoMan and a team of new heroes wearing the classic T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents costumes. In a departure from the classic series, the new Lightning is African. The series lasted 10 issues. In late 2011, DC published a six-issue miniseries.

In 2012, the rights to T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents were transferred to IDW Publishing. This publication lasted eight issues.

==Fictional team history==
The first issue introduced the first three T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents: Dynamo, No-Man and Menthor. United Nations soldiers storm a mountain laboratory of a UN scientist, Professor Emil Jennings, driving off the forces of the Warlord. The scientist dies, but leaves behind several inventions — super weapons to combat the Warlord&#x27;s worldwide attacks. Leonard Brown is given the Thunder Belt, which makes him super strong and invulnerable for a short amount of time, and is code-named Dynamo. Dying scientist Anthony Dunn transfers his mind into an android body of his own design. With a wide number of identical bodies, he can transfer his mind to any of them should something happen to his current one. He is given an invisibility cloak and becomes No-Man. John Janus gains mental powers from the Menthor Helmet. He is a double agent for the Warlord, but when he wears the helmet, he turns good. Joining these super agents is the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Squad, a special team of agents who fight the Warlord. This team included Virgil &quot;Guy&quot; Gilbert, Dynamite (Daniel John Adkins), William &quot;Weed&quot; Wylie, Kathryn &quot;Kitten&quot; Kane, and James &quot;Egghead&quot; Andor.

In subsequent issues, additional agents were added. Gilbert of the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Squad is given the Lightning Suit and becomes a super agent in issue #4. In issue #2, the Warlord is revealed as a Subterranean, and his forces are humanoids who live under the surface and have engaged in a war to reclaim the surface world from humans. Also in this issue, &quot;Egghead&quot; is killed in action but later reappears as a villain in an issue of &quot;Wally Wood&#x27;s T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot;. In issue #7, Menthor is killed. In issue #8, Craig Lawson is given an experimental rocket pack and becomes the Raven, and the Subterraneans are defeated. Later post-Tower additions included sonic-powered agent Vulcan (Travis F. Riley), two different Undersea Agents (Lt. David &quot;Davy&quot; Jones and his daughter, Theresa) and two later versions of &quot;new&quot; agents who wore the Menthor helmet.

With the threat of the Subterraneans ended, new villains appeared in the original series. Issue #9 introduced S.P.I.D.E.R. (Secret People&#x27;s International Directorate for Extralegal Revenue), the main villains for the rest of the series. Other menaces included the Iron Maiden, an armored mastermind (introduced in issue #1 as a possible love interest for Dynamo) who worked for the Subterraneans; Andor, a fast-healing telekinetic superhuman created by the Subterraneans who was introduced in &quot;Dynamo&quot; #1; along with Red Star (a Communist menace) and others.

In the 2010 DC Comics series, S.P.I.D.E.R. kidnaps the Raven and kills Dynamo and Lightning. New versions of Lightning and Dynamo are recruited, and the original No-Man, who had left the team because he was losing his humanity, was replaced. By this time, a number of people had been behind the costume of each T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agent, since the devices that gave them their powers are eventually fatal.

Also introduced are T.H.U.N.D.E.R.&#x27;s recruiters, field agent Colleen Franklin and salesman Toby Heston. In the assault on S.P.I.D.E.R. to rescue the Raven, Toby is revealed as the brother of S.P.I.D.E.R.&#x27;s new leader, given a false personality to infiltrate T.H.U.N.D.E.R. When he attempts to use the Menthor helmet to gain the Raven&#x27;s secrets however, he regains the &quot;Toby&quot; personality, similar to the effect that it had on Janus.

Colleen is revealed to be the daughter of Len Brown, the original Dynamo and the Iron Maiden. They live quietly in Sydney, Australia, but the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Squad raid their home and capture the family. Brown wears the Dynamo belt one last time in exchange for his daughter and the Iron Maiden&#x27;s life and apparently dies during the mission. The Iron Maiden escapes T.H.U.N.D.E.R.&#x27;s custody, leaving Colleen to be raised by T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Years later, Colleen tracks down the Iron Maiden and after extracting information from her with the help of Toby Heston, leaves her to be killed by the daughter of one of her former victims.

Soon the Subterraneans, who were defeated back in the early 1970s, start an uprising led by Demo. It was the existence of the Subterraneans that led to the establishment of the Higher United Nations and T.H.U.N.D.E.R. The new Dynamo is killed and a new Raven is introduced. In a backup series, a new UNDERSEA Agent is introduced.

== Members ==
=== Agents ===

* Dynamo – Leonard Brown wears the Thunder Belt, which makes him super-strong and invulnerable for 30 minutes. Going past the time limit puts a great strain on his body. Due to this, a safety measure was implemented in the belt that causes it to automatically turn off after 30 minutes.
* Menthor – John Janus gains mental powers from the Menthor Helmet. Actually a double agent for the Warlord, when he wears the helmet, he turns good. After Janus dies in issue #7, two later agents wear the Menthor Helmet.
* No-Man – dying scientist Anthony Dunn transfers his mind into an android body of his own design. With a wide number of these identical bodies, he can transfer his mind to any of them should something happen to the one that he is in. The addition of an Invisibility Cloak completes the transformation into No-Man. However, he can only use the cloak for 10 minutes, as it drains his body&#x27;s batteries.
* Lightning – Virgil &quot;Guy&quot; Gilbert wears the Lightning Suit, which gives him super-speed but also ages him at an accelerated rate.
* Raven – Craig Lawson wears an experimental rocket pack, and possesses superhuman vision and hearing.
* Undersea Agent – Lt. David &quot;Davy&quot; Jones and his daughter Theresa both wear the suit.
* Vulcan – Travis F. Riley is a sonic-powered agent.

=== The T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Squad ===
* James &quot;Egghead&quot; Andor – a brilliant strategist. Andor dies in issue #2, reappearing as a villain in later issues.
* Dynamite – Daniel John Adkins is the &quot;weapons man&quot;.
* Kathryn &quot;Kitten&quot; Kane – technical device expert.
* William &quot;Weed&quot; Wylie – locksmith and safecracker.
* Colleen Franklin – T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agent recruiter, later revealed to be the daughter of Len Brown (a.k.a. Dynamo).
* Toby Heston – salesman and T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agent recruiter, he is actually the brother of S.P.I.D.E.R.&#x27;s new leader.

==Film adaptation==
In 2015, the film adaptation was announced to be produced by China&#x27;s Huayi Brothers Media, with Batman producer Michael Uslan to launch a franchise based on the comic book series.

<doc id="445950" wikidata="Q1666554" url="?curid=445950" title="International Film Festival Rotterdam">
<text>International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR) is an annual film festival held at the end of January in various locations in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, focused on independent and experimental films. The inaugural festival took place in June 1972, led by founder Huub Bals. IFFR also hosts CineMart and BoostNL, for film producers to seek funding.

== History ==
The first festival, then called Film International, was organized in June 1972 under the leadership of Huub Bals. The festival profiled itself as a promoter of alternative, innovative, and non-commercial films, with an emphasis on the Far East and developing countries. Around 1983, the festival founded CineMart to serve as a &quot;regular film market&quot;, and later modified the business model to serve instead as a &quot;co-production market&quot;, which helps a selected number of film producers connect with possible co-producers and funders for their film projects.

After the festival founder&#x27;s sudden death in 1988, a fund was initiated and named after him (Hubert Bals Fund), used for supporting filmmakers from developing countries.

The non-competitive character of the festival changed in 1995, when the &quot;VPRO Tiger Awards&quot; were introduced—three yearly prizes for young filmmakers making their first or second film. 

===Directors===
In 1996 Simon Field, formerly cinema director at the London Institute of Contemporary Arts, became director of the festival. In 2004 Sandra den Hamer took over as director of the festival, and from 2007 to 2015 the director was Rutger Wolfson. Film producer Bero Beyer was the next director.

In 2020, Vanja Kaludjercic was appointed as the new director.

==Description==

Since its foundation in 1972, it has maintained a focus on independent and experimental filmmaking by showcasing emerging talents and established auteurs. The festival also places a focus on presenting cutting edge media art and arthouse film, with most of the participants in the short film program identified as artists or experimental filmmakers. IFFR also hosts CineMart and BoostNL, for film producers to seek funding. 

, Vanja Kaludjercic is director of the festival.

The IFFR logo is a stylized image of a tiger that is loosely based on Leo, the lion in the MGM logo.

== Festival screening locations ==
The IFFR screens films at multiple locations, including the Pathé cinema at Schouwburgplein, De Doelen, Cinerama, WORM, Oude Luxor Theater, Rotterdamse Schouwburg, KINO, and LantarenVenster.

== Tiger Award winners ==
The Tiger Award has had various sponsors over the years. In the years leading up to and including 2010 it was sponsored by the VPRO. In 2011 the award was presented by the Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds and since 2012 by Hivos.

== Tiger Short Award Winners ==
The short films have their own competition at IFFR. What differentiates it from the Tiger Competition for feature-length films is the fact that it&#x27;s not just for young and upcoming talents; all filmmakers have a chance at winning. Since 2005, The Tiger Short Competition has had various sponsors over the years including Ammodo, an institution in the Netherlands that supports the development of arts, architecture and science. In 2023, 24 shorts competed for three equal Tiger Short Awards, each worth €5,000.

<doc id="445952" wikidata="Q7834111" url="?curid=445952" title="Transformative learning">
<text>Transformative learning, as a theory, says that the process of &quot;perspective transformation&quot; has three dimensions: psychological (changes in understanding of the self), convictional (revision of belief systems), and behavioral (changes in lifestyle).

Perspective transformation, leading to transformative learning, occurs infrequently. Jack Mezirow believes that it usually results from a &quot;disorienting dilemma&quot; which is triggered by a life crisis or major life transition—although it may also result from an accumulation of transformations in meaning schemes over a period of time. Less dramatic predicaments, such as those created by a teacher for pedagogical effect, also promote transformation.

An important part of transformative learning is for individuals to change their frames of reference by critically reflecting on their assumptions and beliefs and consciously making and implementing plans that bring about new ways of defining their worlds. This process is fundamentally rational and analytical.

==Jack Mezirow==
Jack Mezirow developed transformative learning theory starting in 1978. Since then, the theory has evolved &quot;into a comprehensive and complex description of how learners construe, validate, and reformulate the meaning of their experience.&quot; For learners to change their meaning schemes (specific beliefs, attitudes, and emotional reactions), &quot;they must engage in critical reflection on their experiences, which in turn leads to a perspective transformation.&quot; The meaning schemes that make up meaning structures may change as an individual adds to or integrates ideas within an existing scheme and, in fact, this transformation of meaning schemes occurs routinely through learning.

A perspective transformation leading to transformative learning, however, occurs much less frequently. Mezirow believes that this less frequent transformation usually results from a &quot;disorienting dilemma&quot;, which is triggered by a life crisis or major life transition, although it may also result from an accumulation of transformations in meaning schemes over a period of time.

The perspective transformation is explained by Mezirow as follows:
# Disorienting dilemma
# Self-examination
# Sense of alienation
# Relating discontent to others
# Explaining options of new behavior
# Building confidence in new ways
# Planning a course of action
# Knowledge to implement plans
# Experimenting with new roles
# Reintegration.

A number of critical responses to Mezirow&#x27;s theory of transformative learning have emerged over the years. One criticism of Mezirow&#x27;s theory is its emphasis upon rationality. Some studies support Mezirow. Others conclude that Mezirow grants rational critical reflection too much importance.

Edward W. Taylor has since suggested neurobiological research as a promising area that may offer some explanation about the role emotions play, closing the gap between rationality and emotion in the transformative learning process. Taylor implies that, with available modern technology such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), these once obscure factors can now be examined through determining which neurological brain systems are at work during disorienting dilemmas and the journey of recovery that follows. This neurobiological research also stresses the importance of the role of implicit memory, from which emerge habits, attitudes and preferences that are related to unconscious thoughts and actions.

While the learning process is certainly rational on some levels, it is also a profound experience that can be described as a spiritual or emotional transformation as well. The experience of undoing racist, sexist, and other oppressive attitudes can be painful and emotional, as these attitudes have often been developed as ways to cope with and make sense of the world. This type of learning requires taking risks, and a willingness to be vulnerable and have one&#x27;s attitudes and assumptions challenged.

Other theorists have proposed a view of transformative learning as an intuitive and emotional process. John M. Dirkx, Robert D. Boyd, J. Gordon Myers, and Rosemary R. Ruether link Mezirow&#x27;s rational, cognitive and analytical approach to a more intuitive, creative and holistic view of transformative learning. This view of transformative learning is based primarily on the work of Robert Boyd, who has developed a theory of transformative education based on analytical (or depth) psychology.

For Boyd, transformation is a &quot;fundamental change in one&#x27;s personality involving [together] the resolution of a personal dilemma and the expansion of consciousness resulting in greater personality integration&quot;. This calls upon extra-rational sources such as symbols, images, and archetypes to assist in creating a personal vision or meaning of what it means to be human.

First, an individual must be receptive or open to receiving &quot;alternative expressions of meaning&quot;, and then recognize that the message is authentic. Grieving, considered by Boyd to be the most critical phase of the discernment process, takes place when an individual realizes that old patterns or ways of perceiving are no longer relevant, moves to adopt or establish new ways, and finally integrates old and new patterns. More recent research has specifically explored the process of transformative learning as it occurs in bereaved elders, maintaining that the &quot;disorienting dilemma&quot; deemed necessary by Mezirow is present in the loss of a loved one, with an additional devastating factor being the isolation that the elderly in particular are likely to face. Another study considers transformative learning in the context of suicide bereavement. In these cases the dilemma is compounded by the questioning of conceptions or misconceptions that were held about the relationship with the deceased, and the resolving of the meaning of that relationship during the grieving process.

Unlike Mezirow, who sees the ego as playing a central role in the process of perspective transformation, Boyd and Myers use a framework that moves beyond the ego and the emphasis on reason and logic to a definition of transformative learning that is more psychosocial in nature.

Another definition of transformative learning was put forward by Edmund O&#x27;Sullivan:

Positing that understanding transformative learning may have been hindered by perspectives of rational thought and Western traditions, Kathleen P. King provides an alternate model grounded in a meta-analysis of research, the &quot;Transformative Learning Opportunities Model&quot;.

Recent considerations of these varying perspectives seem to indicate that one perspective does not need to exclude the other. For example, Mezirow and Dirkx discussed their views on transformative learning at a 2005 International Transformative Learning Conference. This dialogue, facilitated by Patricia Cranton, continued via email after the conference and the overview was published in the &quot;Journal of Transformative Education&quot;. Dirkx focuses on subjectivity, in the power of the inner world in one&#x27;s shift in view of the outer world. Mezirow emphasizes critical assessment of assumptions. Although their approaches are different, they agree that their perspectives are similar in several aspects. This includes transforming frames of reference that have lost meaning or have become dysfunctional, and fostering enhanced awareness and consciousness of one&#x27;s being in the world. Both perspectives are required to deepen understanding and to incorporate these ways of learning into transformative education.

One of the difficulties in defining transformative learning is that it bleeds into the boundaries of concepts such as &quot;meaning making&quot; or &quot;critical thinking&quot;.

The term &quot;meaning making&quot; (i.e., constructing meaning) is found most frequently in constructivist approaches to education, based on the work of educators such as John Dewey, Maria Montessori, Jean Piaget, Jerome Bruner, and Lev Vygotsky. In the constructivist view, meaning is constructed from knowledge.

John Dirkx views transformational learning as a meaning-making process within adult education, aimed at promoting a democratic vision of society and self-actualization of individuals. Learning &quot;is&quot; life—not a preparation for it. Therefore, transformational learning requires authenticity, a commitment to focus on the here and now, and awareness of feelings and emotions within the learning setting. The relationship between the individual and the broader world is discussed in terms of the critical role it plays in learning. Dirkx describes our emotions and feelings as a kind of language for helping us learn about ourselves, our relationships with others and how we makes sense of all aspects of our experiences, both objective and subjective. Our sense of who we are and what our relationship is to the world must naturally be drawn into the learning process, leading to deeper engagements with ourselves and the world.

Mezirow posits that all learning is change but not all change is transformation. There is a difference between transmissional, transactional and transformational education. In the first, knowledge is transmitted from teacher to student. In transactional education, it is recognized that the student has valuable experiences, and learns best through experience, inquiry, critical thinking and interaction with other learners. It could be argued that some of the research regarding transformative learning has been in the realm of transactional education, and that what is seen as transformative by some authors is in fact still within the realm of transactional learning.

According to Stephen D. Brookfield, learning can only be considered transformative if it involves a fundamental questioning or reordering of how one thinks or acts; a challenge to hegemonic implications. In other words, reflection alone does not result in transformative learning unless the process involves a critical reflection, a recognition and analysis of taken-for-granted assumptions.

==In practice==
On the surface, the two views of transformative learning presented here are contradictory. One advocates a rational approach that depends primarily on critical reflection whereas the other relies more on intuition and emotion. However, the differences in the two views may best be seen as a matter of emphasis. Both utilize rational processes and incorporate imagination as a part of a creative process. The two different views of transformative learning described here as well as examples of how it occurs in practice suggest that no single model of transformative learning exists.

When transformative learning is the goal of adult education, fostering a learning environment in which it can occur should consider the following:

===The role of the educator===
Transformative learning cannot be guaranteed. Teachers can only provide an opportunity to transformatively learn. In order to foster transformative learning, the educator&#x27;s role is to assist learners in becoming aware and critical of assumptions. This includes their own assumptions that lead to their interpretations, beliefs, habits of mind, or points of view, as well as the assumptions of others. Educators must provide learners practice in recognizing frames of reference. By doing so, educators encourage practice in redefining problems from different perspectives. The goal is to create a community of learners who are &quot;united in a shared experience of trying to make meaning of their life experience&quot;.

Educators need to provide learners with opportunities to effectively participate in discourse. Discourse involves assessing beliefs, feelings, and values. This dialogue has the goal of assessing reasons behind competing interpretations through critical examination of evidence, arguments, and alternate points of view. Learners are able to validate how and what they understand, as well as develop well-informed judgments regarding a belief. Educators can encourage critical reflection and experience with discourse through the implementation of methods including metaphor analysis, concept mapping, consciousness raising, life histories, repertory grids, and participation in social action.

The educator must encourage equal participation among students in discourse. One strategy is to encourage procedures that require group members to take on the roles of monitoring the direction of dialogue and ensuring equal participation. Educators can also encourage dialogue from different perspectives through controversial statements or readings from opposing points of view. It is necessary that the educator avoids shaping the discussion.

The role of educators is also to set objectives that include autonomous thinking. By fostering learners&#x27; critical reflection and experience in discourse, autonomous thinking is possible. The foundations to thinking autonomously begin in childhood and continue in adulthood. The educator assists adult learners in becoming more critical in assessing assumptions, better at recognizing frames of references and alternate perspectives, as well as effective at collaborating with others to assess and arrive at judgments in regards to beliefs.

It is the role of the educator to promote discovery learning through the implementation of classroom methods such as learning contracts, group projects, role play, case studies, and simulations. These methods facilitate transformative learning by helping learners examine concepts in the context of their lives and analyze the justification of new knowledge.

The educator&#x27;s role in establishing an environment that builds trust and care and facilitates the development of sensitive relationships among learners is a fundamental principle of fostering transformative learning. The educator also serves as a role model by demonstrating a willingness to learn and change. Teachers should provide the environment to allow students to reflect on their transformative learning experiences, but to also allow them to reflect on their own. As a result, professional development is important to assist educators in becoming authentic and critically reflective.

Mezirow outlines three ways in which experience is interpreted through reflection:

* Content reflection is the investigation of the content. A question that we might ask ourselves is “what did I do that led to the outcome?
* Process reflection includes checking on the problem-solving strategies that are used in the classroom. For example, “do I understand the needs of my students?”
* Premise reflection is the question of the problem itself. A question might be &quot;“why do I feel responsible for this situation”.

===The role of professional development for the educator===
Transformative learning about teaching occurs when educators critically examine their practice and develop alternative perspectives of understanding their practice. It is essential that fostering this critical examination become the role of professional development. The role of professional development is to assist educators in gaining awareness of their habits of mind regarding teaching. As this professional development occurs, educators critically examine the assumptions that underlie their practice, the consequences to their assumptions, and develop alternative perspectives on their practice.

Teachers need education and professional development that will help them to question, challenge and experience critical discussions on school improvement. Transforming teachers so they see themselves as agents of social change can be a challenge within education.

==== Strategies for transformative professional development ====
Strategies for transformative professional development include action plans, reflective activities, case studies, curriculum development, and critical-theory discussions. Action plans and reflective activities provide the practice and modelling of critical reflection on the profession of education, and provide guidance for the teaching and learning experience. Through the use of real-life examples, case studies provide the opportunity to analyze assumptions, as well as the consequences of choices and actions. The use of case studies focuses on practice, and on the philosophical and practical aspects of educators&#x27; practice. Curriculum development creates the opportunity to connect theory and practice. In addition to introducing new teaching techniques, educators can test and compare new concepts and practices with previous techniques. This testing and comparison moves away from uncritically accepting new teaching methods. Critical-theory discussions can be implemented to guide educators in questioning the meaning and purpose of information, encouraging educators to question the selection of the information they provide to their students.

====Examples in educator professional development====
Mentoring is another strategy for transformative professional, personal and organizational development. By creating a supportive culture, mentoring can provide the environment for transformative learning to occur. Through this experience mentoring becomes a transformative relationship in which individuals reconstruct possible selves. As a two-way process, mentoring is a learning tool for both the mentor as well as the person being mentored.

In a recent study, Karen Weller Swanson, applying theories of critical reflection, incorporating a critical incident model, and positing a learning partnership, designed a program for practicing teachers, for the purpose of transformative teacher development. Experiences were created to get teachers to reflect on their assumptions, asking them to consider alternative perspectives and to develop a language for making connections between theory and practice. Over the studies&#x27; two-year period, teachers were able to develop ownership of theory and transfer this knowledge into their practice. To be effective, transformative teacher development must value what teachers bring from their personal and professional experience, and acknowledge that learning is both an individual and a social experience. The process involved: achieving transparency through negotiation of curriculum, finding a common language through discussion of individual assumptions, getting continuous feedback through critical-incident questions, and testing by teacher application of the program within their classrooms. Autobiography and journaling were additional techniques used within this learning partnership. Both teachers and faculty participating in the program were transformed as beliefs were challenged and knowledge was co-constructed throughout the experience.

New teachers often find expectations ambiguous, and they lack the self-awareness and understanding to navigate the educational environment. A transformative learning framework was used in a Foundations course, for participants to build on individual and collective analysis of teaching experiences, and to help them re-frame their practice. Giedre Kligyte investigated &quot;transformation narratives&quot; that emerged from written reflection of participants&#x27; teaching practice, based on individual reflection and group discussion. By using Mezirow&#x27;s work, along with Robert Kegan&#x27;s constructive developmental theory, Kligyte found the following themes: a move from non-reflective habitual action to a more conscious practice; a change in perspective to a more sophisticated view of teaching; an increased sense of agency, including the concept that academic practice is an object which can be controlled and shaped, rather than something externally imposed; increased confidence to take risks and experiment; and a more multifaceted idea of what it means to be an academic. The conducive environment allowed for transformative experiences to occur. Through creation of a safe social context where &quot;disorienting dilemmas&quot; can be examined, questioned, and explored, participants were able to develop a new &quot;frame of reference&quot; and reintegrate learning into practice. Kligyte cautions that there are limitations to the framework, such as the possibility that participants will conform to expectations in their reflections. She notes that the &quot;transformation narratives&quot; examined are not a single, final narrative of the self, but a snapshot for further exploration. Kligyte&#x27;s findings are similar to S. Fletcher&#x27;s: that transformative learning helps to make sense of a complex and often ambiguous work environment, which requires multiple selves.

===The role of the learner===
The educator becomes a facilitator when the goal of learning is for learners to construct knowledge about themselves, others, and social norms. As a result, learners play an important role in the learning environment and process. Learners must create norms within the classroom that include civility, respect, and responsibility for helping one another learn. Learners must welcome diversity within the learning environment and aim for peer collaboration.

Learners must become critical of their own assumptions in order to transform their unquestioned frame of reference. Through communicative learning, learners must work towards critically reflecting on assumptions that underlie intentions, values, beliefs, and feelings. Learners are involved in objective re-framing of their frames of reference when they critically reflect on the assumptions of others. In contrast, subjective re-framing occurs when learners critically assess their own assumptions.

The role of the learner involves actively participating in discourse. Through discourse, learners are able to validate what is being communicated to them. This dialogue provides the opportunity to critically examine evidence, arguments, and alternate points of view, which fosters collaborative learning.

===The role of the rational and the affective===
Transformative learning has two components that at times seem to be in conflict: the cognitive, rational, and objective and the intuitive, imaginative, and subjective. Both the rational and the affective play a role in transformative learning. Although the emphasis has been on transformative learning as a rational process, teachers need to consider how they can help students use feelings and emotions both in critical reflection and as a means of reflection.

There are a number of educational and research institutions that are based on the principles of transformative learning. Some examples include the Transformative Studies Institute and The Transformative Learning Centre at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) of the University of Toronto.

Evidence is emerging on the applicability of transformative theory in new educational programmes, in business and industry education, health professional education, community education such as courses offered by YMCA, and informal settings such as self-help groups. Phil Bamber and Les Hankin describe how students in a service-learning section experienced perspective transformation and shifts of their world-view when their training was influenced by transformative learning theory.

Susan Imel states that transformative learning may not always be a goal of education, but its importance should not be overlooked. Educators should strive to understand it, even if they choose not to foster it.

<doc id="445954" wikidata="Q42417046" url="?curid=445954" title="Direct rule (Northern Ireland)">
<text>In Northern Irish politics, direct rule () is the administration of Northern Ireland directly by the Government of the United Kingdom. It was practised for 26 consecutive years between 1972 and 1998 during the Troubles, and has since then been temporarily applied during suspensions. The most recent period of direct rule came to an end on 8 May 2007 when power was restored to the Northern Ireland Assembly following elections in April and a power-sharing agreement among major parties.

Although everyday matters under direct rule were handled by government departments within Northern Ireland itself, major policy was determined by the British Government&#x27;s Northern Ireland Office, under the direction of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland; and legislation was introduced, amended, or repealed by means of Order in Council. Direct rule did not mean that the people of Northern Ireland had no democratic say in how they were governed; like other parts of the United Kingdom, they elected (and still elect) members of parliament to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, to which the Northern Ireland Office is responsible. But it did result in the existence of an administration specific to Northern Ireland which did not have a specifically Northern Irish mandate.

==History==
The system of direct rule was originally introduced on 28 March 1972 under the terms of the UK&#x27;s Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972, which also suspended the Parliament of Northern Ireland (&quot;Stormont&quot;).

The Northern Irish administration under Brian Faulkner had refused to allow control of security in the province to be transferred to London. As a consequence, the British government under Edward Heath announced on 24 March 1972 that devolved government in Northern Ireland would be suspended.

Responsibility for Northern Ireland within the Cabinet had until then rested with the Home Secretary, but was now transferred to the new post of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, heading the Northern Ireland Office. Several new junior government ministers were created to politically head the NI government departments.

The British Government sought to establish a Northern Ireland Assembly in 1973 (under the Sunningdale Agreement; this was brought down by Unionist action), in 1982 (this time boycotted by Nationalists), and more recently under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Each time, the intention in principle was that the Assembly would take over the political governance of Northern Ireland, and that direct rule would thus come to an end. The results of the Good Friday Agreement were the most successful at achieving this; however, the Assembly was nevertheless suspended (and direct rule re-imposed) for over three months starting in February 2000, twice briefly in August and September of 2001, and again from October 2002 until the spring of 2007.

Since the St Andrews Agreement in 2006, Westminster no longer has the power to suspend the Assembly without the enactment of further primary legislation.

===Instances of direct rule following the Good Friday Agreement===
The assembly has been suspended five times since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in accordance with the Northern Ireland Act 2000. The periods of suspension were:
*11 February – 30 May 2000
*10 August 2001 (24-hour suspension)
*22 September 2001 (24-hour suspension)
*14 October 2002 – 7 May 2007

In computer science, polylogarithmic functions occur as the order of time for some data structure operations. Additionally, the exponential function of a polylogarithmic function produces a function with quasi-polynomial growth, and algorithms with this as their time complexity are said to take quasi-polynomial time.

All polylogarithmic functions of are for every exponent (for the meaning of this symbol, see small o notation), that is, a polylogarithmic function grows more slowly than any positive exponent. This observation is the basis for the soft O notation .

<doc id="445959" wikidata="Q196305" url="?curid=445959" title="File Explorer">
<text>File Explorer, previously known as Windows Explorer, is a file manager application and default desktop environment that is included with releases of the Microsoft Windows operating system from Windows 95 onwards. It provides a graphical user interface for accessing the file systems, as well as user interface elements such as the taskbar and desktop. 

The application was renamed from &quot;Windows Explorer&quot; to &quot;File Explorer&quot; in Windows 8; however, the old name of &quot;Windows Explorer&quot; can still be seen in the Windows Task Manager.

==Overview==
Windows Explorer was first included with Windows 95 as a replacement for File Manager, which came with all versions of Windows 3.x operating systems. Explorer could be accessed by double-clicking the new My Computer desktop icon or launched from the new Start Menu that replaced the earlier Program Manager. There is also a shortcut key combination: . Successive versions of Windows (and in some cases, Internet Explorer) introduced new features and capabilities, removed other features, and generally progressed from being a simple file system navigation tool into a task-based file management system.

While &quot;Windows Explorer&quot; or &quot;File Explorer&quot; is a term most commonly used to describe the file management aspect of the operating system, the Explorer also houses the operating system&#x27;s search functionality and File Type associations (based on filename extensions), and is responsible for displaying the desktop icons, the Start Menu, the Taskbar, and the Control Panel. Collectively, these features are known as the Windows shell.

File Explorer is the default user interface for accessing and managing the file systems, but it &quot;is&quot; possible to perform such tasks on Windows without File Explorer. For example, the menu option in Task Manager on Windows NT or later functions independently of File Explorer, as do commands run within a command prompt window.

After a user logs in, the explorer process is created by the userinit process. Userinit performs some initialization of the user environment (such as running the login script and applying group policies) and then looks in the registry at the Shell value and creates a process to run the system-defined shell – by default, Explorer.exe. Then Userinit exits. This is why Explorer.exe is shown by various process explorers with no parent – its parent has exited.

==History==
In 1995, Microsoft first released test versions of a shell refresh, named the Shell Technology Preview, and often referred to informally as &quot;NewShell&quot;. The update was designed to replace the Windows 3.x Program Manager/File Manager based shell with Windows Explorer. The release provided capabilities quite similar to that of the Windows &quot;Chicago&quot; (codename for Windows 95) shell during its late beta phases, however was intended to be nothing more than a test release. There were two public releases of the Shell Technology Preview, made available to MSDN and CompuServe users: May 26, 1995, and August 8, 1995. Both held Windows Explorer builds of 3.51.1053.1. The Shell Technology Preview program never saw a final release under NT 3.51. The entire program was moved across to the Cairo development group who finally integrated the new shell design into the NT code with the release of NT 4.0 in July 1996.

===Windows 98 and Windows Desktop Update===
With the release of the Windows Desktop Update (packaged with Internet Explorer 4 as an optional component, and included in Windows 98), Windows Explorer became &quot;integrated&quot; with Internet Explorer, most notably with the addition of navigation arrows (back and forward) for moving between recently visited directories, as well as Internet Explorer&#x27;s Favorites menu.

An address bar was also added to Windows Explorer, which a user could type in directory paths directly, and be taken to that folder.

Another feature that was based on Internet Explorer technology was customized folders. Such folders contained a hidden web page that controlled the way the Windows Explorer displayed the contents of the folder.

===Windows ME and Windows 2000===

The &quot;Web-style&quot; folders view, with the left Explorer pane displaying details for the object currently selected, is turned on by default. For certain file types, such as pictures and media files, a preview is also displayed in the left pane. The Windows 2000 Explorer featured an interactive media player as the previewer for sound and video files. However, such a previewer can be enabled in Windows ME through the use of folder customization templates. Windows Explorer in Windows 2000 and Windows ME allows for custom thumbnail previewers and tooltip handlers. The default file tooltip displays file title, author, subject and comments; this metadata may be read from a special NTFS stream, if the file is on an NTFS volume, or from a COM Structured Storage stream, if the file is a structured storage document. All Microsoft Office documents since Office 95 make use of structured storage, so their metadata is displayable in the Windows 2000 Explorer default tooltip. File shortcuts can also store comments which are displayed as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the shortcut.

The right-hand pane, which usually just lists files and folders, can also be customized. For example, the contents of the system folders aren&#x27;t displayed by default, instead showing in the right pane a warning to the user that modifying the contents of the system folders could harm their computer. It&#x27;s possible to define additional Explorer panes by using DIV elements in folder template files. This feature was abused by computer viruses that employed malicious scripts, Java applets, or ActiveX controls in folder template files as their infection vector. Two such viruses are VBS/Roor-C&lt;ref name=&quot;VBS/Roor-C&quot;&gt;Sophos, VBS/Roor-C threat analysis . Accessed August 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and VBS.Redlof.a.

Other Explorer UI elements that can be customized include columns in &quot;Details&quot; view, icon overlays, and search providers: the new DHTML-based search pane is integrated into Windows 2000 Explorer, unlike the separate search dialog found in all previous Explorer versions.

Search capabilities were added, offering full-text searches of documents, with options to filter by date (including arbitrary ranges like &quot;modified within the last week&quot;), size, and file type. The Indexing Service has also been integrated into the operating system and the search pane built into Explorer allows searching files indexed by its database. The ability to customize the standard buttons was also added.

===Windows XP and Windows Server 2003===

There were significant changes made to Windows Explorer in Windows XP, both visually and functionally. Microsoft focused especially on making Explorer more discoverable and task-based, as well as adding several new features to reflect the growing use of a computer as a digital hub.

Windows Explorer in Windows Server 2003 contains all the same features as Windows XP, but the task panes and search companion are disabled by default.

====Task pane====
The task pane is displayed on the left-hand side of the window instead of the traditional folder tree view. It presents the user with a list of common actions and destinations that are relevant to the current directory or file(s) selected. For instance, when in a directory containing mostly pictures, a set of &quot;Picture tasks&quot; is shown, offering the options to display these pictures as a slide show, to print them out, or to go online to order prints. Conversely, a folder containing music files would offer options to play those files in a media player or to go online to purchase music. Windows XP had a Media bar but it was removed with SP1. The Media Bar was only available with Windows XP RTM.

Every folder also has &quot;File and Folder Tasks&quot;, offering options to create new folders, share a folder on the local network, publish files or folders to a website, and other common tasks like copying, renaming, moving, and deleting files or folders. File types that have identified themselves as being printable also have an option listed to print the file.

Underneath &quot;Other Places&quot; is a &quot;Details&quot; pane which gives additional information – typically file size and date, but depending on the file type, a thumbnail preview, author, image dimensions, or other details.

The &quot;Folders&quot; button on the Windows Explorer toolbar toggles between the traditional tree view of folders, and the task pane. Users can get rid of the task pane or restore it using the sequence: Tools – Folder Options – General – Show Common Tasks/Use Windows Classic Folders.

====Search companion====

Microsoft introduced animated &quot;Search Companions&quot; in an attempt to make searching more engaging and friendly; the default character is a puppy named Rover (previously used in Microsoft Bob), with three other characters (Merlin the magician, Earl the surfer, and Courtney) also available. These search companions use the same technology as Microsoft Office&#x27;s Office Assistants, even incorporating &quot;tricks&quot; and sound effects, and they can be used as Office Assistants if their files are copied into the C:\Windows\msagent\chars folder.

The search capability itself is fairly similar to Windows ME and Windows 2000, with one major addition: Search can also be instructed to search only files that are categorical &quot;Documents&quot; or &quot;Pictures, music and video&quot;; this feature is noteworthy largely because of how Windows determines what types of files can be classified under these categories. In order to maintain a relevant list of file types, Windows Explorer connects to Microsoft and downloads a set of XML files that define what these file types are. The Search Companion can be disabled in favor of the classic search pane used in Windows 2000 by using the Tweak UI applet from Microsoft&#x27;s PowerToys for Windows XP, or by manually editing the registry.

====Image handling====

Windows XP improves image preview in Explorer by offering a Filmstrip view. &quot;Back&quot; and &quot;Previous&quot; buttons facilitate navigation through the pictures, and a pair of &quot;Rotate&quot; buttons offer 90-degree clockwise and counter-clockwise (lossy) rotation of images. Aside from the Filmstrip view mode, there is a &#x27;Thumbnails&#x27; mode, which displays thumbnail-sized images in the folder. A Folder containing images will also show thumbnails of four of the images from that folder overlaid on top of a large folder icon.

====Web publishing====
Web sites that offer image hosting services can be plugged into Windows Explorer, which the user can use to select images on their computer, and have them uploaded correctly without dealing with comparatively complex solutions involving FTP or web interfaces.

====Other changes====
* Explorer gained the ability to understand the metadata of a number of types of files. For example, with images from a digital camera, the Exif information can be viewed, both in the Properties pages for the photo itself, as well as via optional additional Details View columns.
* A Tile view mode was added, which displays the file&#x27;s icon in a larger size (48 × 48), and places the file name, descriptive type, and additional information (typically the file size for data files, and the publisher name for applications) to the right.
* The Details view also presented an additional option called &quot;Show in Groups&quot; which allows the Explorer to separate its contents by headings based on the field which is used to sort the items.
* The taskbar can be locked to prevent it from accidentally being moved.
* Windows Explorer also gained the ability to burn CDs and DVD-RAM discs in Windows XP.
* Ability to create and open ZIP files, called &quot;compressed folders&quot;, which is a file containing other files.
* Ability to open Cabinet (.cab) files, another type of file that contains other files.
* If a codice_1 or codice_2 file is copied or moved, the accompanying codice_3 suffix folder is copied or moved among it automatically.

ZIP and CAB files are integrated into the user interface so they can be browsed as if they were ordinary folders. Given that files contained inside ZIP files can not be opened directly, they are automatically extracted to a temporary location and launched with the associated program from the temporary location when opened, to make the appearance that the ZIP file is a real directory.

====Removed and changed features====
* The sort order has changed compared to the one in Windows 2000. For file names containing numbers Windows Explorer now tries to sort based on numerical value rather than just comparing each number digit by digit.

===Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008===
====Search, organizing and metadata====
Windows Explorer includes significant changes from previous versions of Windows such as improved filtering, sorting, grouping and stacking. Combined with integrated desktop search, Windows Explorer allows users to find and organize their files in new ways, such as stacks. The new Stacks viewing mode groups files according to the criterion specified by the user. Stacks can be clicked to filter the files shown in Windows Explorer. There is also the ability to save searches as virtual folders or search folders. A search folder is simply an XML file, which stores the query in a form that can be used by the Windows search subsystem. When accessed, the search is executed and the results are aggregated and presented as a virtual folder. Windows Vista includes six search folders by default: recent documents, recent e-mail, recent music, recent pictures and videos, recent changed, and &quot;Shared by Me&quot;. Additionally, search operators for properties were introduced, such as codice_4. Since at least Windows 7, comparison operators &quot;greater than&quot; and &quot;less than&quot; are supported to search for any supported attribute such as date ranges and file sizes, like codice_5 to search for all files that are greater than 100 MB. Attributes sortable and searchable in Windows Explorer include pictures&#x27; dimensions, Exif data such as aperture and exposure, video duration and framerate and width.

When sorting items, the sort order no longer remains consistently Ascending or Descending. Each property has a preferred sort direction. For example, sort by date defaults to descending order, as does size. But name and type default to ascending order.

Searching for files containing a given text string became problematic with Vista unless the files had been indexed. An alternative is to use the findstr command-line function. After right-clicking on a folder one can open a command-line prompt in that folder.

Windows Explorer also contains modifications in the visualization of files on a computer. A new addition to Windows Explorer in Vista and Server 2008 is the details pane, which displays metadata and information relating to the currently selected file or folder. The details pane will also display a thumbnail of the file or an icon of the filetype if the file does not contain visual information. Furthermore, different imagery is overlaid on thumbnails to give more information about the file, such as a picture frame around the thumbnail of an image file, or a filmstrip on a video file.

The details pane also allows for the change of some textual metadata such as author and title in files that support them within Windows Explorer. A new type of metadata called tags allows users to add descriptive terms to documents for easier categorization and retrieval. Some files support open metadata, allowing users to define new types of metadata for their files. Out-of-the-box, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 supports Microsoft Office documents and most audio and video files. Support for other file types can however be added by writing specialized software to retrieve the metadata at the shell&#x27;s request. Metadata stored in a file&#x27;s alternate data stream only on NTFS volumes cannot be viewed and edited through the summary tab of the file&#x27;s properties anymore. Instead, all metadata is stored inside the file, so that it will always travel with the file and not be dependent on the file system.

====Layout and icons====
Windows Explorer in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 also introduces a new layout. The task panes from Windows XP are replaced with a toolbar on top and a navigation pane on the left. The navigation pane contains commonly accessed folders and preconfigured search folders. Eight different views are available to view files and folders, including extra large, large, medium, small, list, details, tiles, and content. In addition, column headers now appear in all icon viewing modes, unlike Windows XP where they only appear in the details icon viewing mode. File and folder actions such as cut, copy, paste, undo, redo, delete, rename and properties are built into a dropdown menu which appears when the Organize button is clicked. It is also possible to change the layout of the Explorer window by using the Organize button. Users can select whether to display classic menus, a search pane, a preview pane, a reading pane, and the navigation pane. The preview pane enables users to preview files (e.g., documents or media files) without opening them. If an application, such as Office 2007, installs preview handlers for file types, then these files can also be edited within the preview pane itself.

Windows Vista saw the introduction of the breadcrumb bar for easier navigation. As opposed to the prior address bar which displayed the current folder in a simple editable combobox, this new style structures the path into clickable levels of folder hierarchy (though falls back to the classic edit mode when a blank area is clicked), enabling the user to skip as many levels as desired in one click rather than repeatedly clicking &quot;Up&quot;. It is also possible to navigate to any subfolder of the current folder using the arrow to the right of the last item. The menu bar is now hidden by default but reappears temporarily when the user presses Alt.

Check boxes in Windows Explorer allow the selection of multiple files. Free and used space on all drives is shown in horizontal indicator bars. Icons of various sizes are supported: 16 x 16, 24 x 24, 32 x 32, 48 x 48, 64 x 64, 96 x 96, 128 x 128 and 256 x 256. Windows Explorer can zoom the icons in and out using a slider or by holding down the Ctrl key and using the mouse scrollwheel. Live icons can display the content of folders and files themselves rather than generic icons.

====Other changes====
With the release of Windows Vista and Server 2008 and Windows Internet Explorer 7 for Windows XP, Internet Explorer is no longer integrated with Windows Explorer. In Windows Vista and Server 2008 (and in Windows XP as well if IE7 or 8 is installed), Windows Explorer no longer displays web pages, and IE7 does not support use as a file manager, although one will separately launch the other as necessary.

When moving or copying files from one folder to another, if two files have the same name, an option is now available to rename the file; in previous versions of Windows, the user was prompted to choose either a replacement or cancel moving the file. Also, when renaming a file, Explorer only highlights the filename without selecting the extension. Renaming multiple files is quicker as pressing Tab automatically renames the existing file or folder and opens the file name text field for the next file for renaming. Shift+Tab allows renaming in the same manner upwards.

Support for burning data on DVDs (DVD±R, DVD±R DL, DVD±R RW) in addition to CDs and DVD-RAM using version 2.0 of the Image Mastering API, as well as Live File System support was added.

If a file is in use by another application, Windows Explorer tells users to close the application and retry the file operation. Also, a new interface IFileIsInUse is introduced into the API which developers can use to let other applications switch to the main window of the application that has the file open or simply close the file from the &quot;File in Use&quot; dialog. If the running application exposes these operations by means of the IFileIsInUse interface, Windows Explorer, upon encountering a locked file, allows the user to close the file or switch to the application from the dialog box itself.

Windows Vista introduced pre-included support for the Media Transfer Protocol.

====Removed and changed features====

The ability to customize the layout and buttons on the toolbars has been removed in Windows Vista&#x27;s Explorer, as has the ability to add a password to a zip file (compressed folder). The Toolbar button in Explorer to go up one folder from the current folder has been removed (the function still exists however, one can move up a folder by pressing + ). Although still fully available from the menus and keyboard shortcuts, toolbar buttons for Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Delete, Properties and some others are no longer available. The Menu Bar is also hidden by default but is still available by pressing the Alt key or changing its visibility in the layout options. Several other features are removed such as showing the size on the status bar without selecting items, storing metadata in NTFS alternate data streams, the IColumnProvider interface which allowed addition of custom columns to Explorer and folder background customization using desktop.ini.

The ability to right-click a folder and hit &quot;Search&quot; was removed in Windows Vista Service Pack 1. Users must open the folder they wish to search in and enter their keywords in the search field located on the top right corner of the window. Alternatively, users can specify other search parameters through the &quot;Advanced Search&quot; UI, which can be accessed by clicking on the Organize Bar and selecting Search Pane under the Layout submenu. Pressing F3 also opens the &quot;Advanced Search&quot; interface.

===Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2===
====Libraries====
Windows Explorer in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 supports libraries, virtual folders described in a codice_6 file that aggregates content from various locations – including shared folders on networked systems if the shared folder has been indexed by the host system – and present them in a unified view. Searching in a library automatically federates the query to the remote systems, in addition to searching on the local system, so that files on the remote systems are also searched. Unlike search folders, Libraries are backed by a physical location which allows files to be saved in the libraries. Such files are transparently saved in the backing physical folder. The default save location for a library may be configured by the user, as can the default view layout for each library. Libraries are generally stored in the libraries special folder, which allows them to be displayed on the navigation pane.

By default, a new user account in Windows 7 contains four libraries, for different file types: Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos. They are configured to include the user&#x27;s profile folders for these respective file types, as well as the computer&#x27;s corresponding Public folders.

In addition to aggregating multiple storage locations, Libraries enable Arrangement Views and Search Filter Suggestions. Arrangement Views allow users to pivot their views of the library&#x27;s contents based on metadata. For example, selecting the &quot;By Month&quot; view in the Pictures library will display photos in stacks, where each stack represents a month of photos based on the date they were taken. In the Music library, the &quot;By Artist&quot; view will display stacks of albums from the artists in their collections, and browsing into an artist stack will then display the relevant albums.

Search Filter Suggestions are a new feature of the Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 Explorer&#x27;s search box. When the user clicks in the search box, a menu shows up below it showing recent searches as well as suggested Advanced Query Syntax filters that the user can type. When one is selected (or typed in manually), the menu will update to show the possible values to filter by for that property, and this list is based on the current location and other parts of the query already typed. For example, selecting the &quot;tags&quot; filter or typing &quot;tags:&quot; into the search box will display the list of possible tag values which will return search results.

The metadata written within the file, implemented in Vista, is also utilized in Windows 7. This can sometimes lead to long wait times displaying the contents of a folder. For example, if a folder contains many large video files totaling hundreds of gigabytes, and the Window Explorer pane is in Details view mode showing a property contained within the metadata (for example Date, Length, Frame Height), Windows Explorer might have to search the contents of the whole file for the meta data. Some damaged files can cause a prolonged delay as well. This is due to metadata information being able to be placed anywhere within the file, beginning, middle, or end, necessitating a search of the whole file. Lengthy delays also occur when displaying the contents of a folder with many different types of program icons. The icon is contained in the metadata. Some programs cause the activation of a virus scan when retrieving the icon information from the metadata, hence producing a lengthy delay.

Arrangement Views and Search Filter Suggestions are database-backed features that require that all locations in the Library be indexed by the Windows Search service. Local disk locations must be indexed by the local indexer, and Windows Explorer will automatically add locations to the indexing scope when they are included in a library. Remote locations can be indexed by the indexer on another Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 machine, on a Windows machine running Windows Search 4 (such as Windows Vista or Windows Home Server), or on another device that implements the MS-WSP remote query protocol.

====Federated search====
Windows Explorer also supports federating search to external data sources, such as custom databases or web services, that are exposed over the web and described via an OpenSearch definition. The federated location description (called a Search Connector) is provided as a codice_7 file. Once installed, the data source becomes queryable directly from Windows Explorer. Windows Explorer features, such as previews and thumbnails, work with the results of a federated search as well.

====Other changes====
* Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 support showing icons in the context menu and creating cascaded context menus with static verbs in submenus using the Registry instead of a shell extension.
* The search box in the Explorer window and the address bar can be resized.
* Certain folders in the navigation pane can be hidden to reduce clutter.
* Progress bars and overlay icons on an application&#x27;s button on the taskbar.
* Content view which shows thumbnails and metadata.
* Buttons to toggle the preview pane and create a new folder.

====Removed or changed features====

In Windows 7, several features have been removed from Windows Explorer, including the collapsible folder pane, overlay icon for shared items, remembering individual folder window sizes and positions, free disk space on the status bar, icons on the command bar, ability to disable Auto Arrange and Align to Grid, sortable column headings in other views except details view, ability to disable full row selection in details view, automatic horizontal scrolling and scrollbar in the navigation pane and maintaining selection when sorting from the Edit menu.

===Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012===

The file manager on Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 is renamed File Explorer and introduces new features such as a redesigned interface incorporating a ribbon toolbar, and a redesigned file operation dialog that displays more detailed progress and allows for file operations to be paused and resumed. The details pane from Windows Vista and 7 was removed and replaced with a narrower pane with no icons and fewer detail columns. But other details are displayed by hovering over the file&#x27;s name.

=== Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 ===
File Explorer&#x27;s icons were redesigned to fit with the more flat and simplified theming of Windows 10 as a whole. The window border padding is thinner than previous versions. Windows 10 Creators Update and later versions come with a new Universal File Explorer (also known as the UWP File Explorer). Although hidden, it can be opened by creating a shortcut pointing to &quot;explorer shell:AppsFolder\c5e2524a-ea46-4f67-841f-6a9465d9d515_cw5n1h2txyewy!App&quot; A Dark mode was added to the software in 2018, to match similar themes available for other inbuilt Windows applications.

=== Windows 10, version 1809 and Windows Server 2019 ===
A &quot;dark mode&quot; has been added to File Explorer in Windows 10, version 1809 and Windows Server 2019. The Universal File Explorer also includes new features.

=== Windows 10, version 1909 ===
Windows Search and OneDrive have been integrated into File Explorer&#x27;s search feature in Windows 10, version 1909.

=== Windows 11 ===
In Windows 11, File Explorer had undergone significant UI changes, with the Ribbon Interface dating back to Windows 7 having been reworked into a command bar. Translucency, shadows, and rounded geometry have also been added, following the Microsoft&#x27;s new Fluent Design System. In March 2022, Microsoft introduced adverts into File Explorer, but later stated that these were &quot;not intended to be published externally&quot; after significant negative media coverage.

=== Windows 11 2022 Update ===
On April 5, 2022, Microsoft announced that it would be adding tabs, favorites, and a new homepage to File Explorer. These features were eventually introduced via an update to the Windows 11 2022 Update on October 18, 2022.

===Windows 11 2023 Update===
On 21 September, 2023, Microsoft announced that it would be adding a modern home page, address bar, search experience, and details pane, along with an update gallery pane. This update was released to most Windows 11 users via an enablement package to Windows 11, 22H2. The full release is slated to come out with the full release of Windows 11 23H2. The new File Explorer is now based on XAML technology, instead of the former Win32 technology.

==Extensibility==
File Explorer can be extended to support non-default functionality by means of Windows shell extensions, which are COM objects that plug the extended functionality into Windows Explorer. Shell extensions can be in the form of shell extension handlers, toolbars or even namespace extensions that allow certain folders (or even non-filesystem objects such as the images scanned by a scanner) to be presented as a special folder. File Explorer also allows metadata for files to be added as NTFS alternate data streams, separate from the data stream for the file.

Shell extension handlers are queried by the shell beforehand for modifying the action the shell takes. They can be associated on a per file type – where they will show up only when a particular action takes place on a particular file type – or on a global basis – which are always available. The shell supports the following extension handlers:

Namespace extensions are used by Explorer and Common Dialogs to either display some data – which are not necessarily persisted as files – in a folder-like view or to present data in a way that is different from their organization on the file system. This feature can be exploited by a any hierarchical data source that can be represented as a file system like the Windows one, including Cloud-based implementation. Special folders, such as My Computer and Network Places in Windows Explorer are implemented this way, as are Explorer views that let items in a mobile phone or digital camera be explored. Source-control systems that use Explorer to browse source repositories also use Namespace extensions to allow Explorer to browse the revisions. To implement a namespace extension, the codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11 and codice_12 interfaces need to be implemented and registered. The implementation needs to provide the logic for navigating the data store as well as describing the presentation. Windows Explorer will instantiate the COM objects as required.

While Windows Explorer natively exposes the extensibility points as COM interfaces, .NET Framework can also be used to write some types of extensions, using the COM Interop functionality of .NET Framework. While Microsoft itself makes available extensions – such as the photo info tool – which are authored using .NET Framework, they currently recommend against writing managed shell extensions, as only one instance of the CLR (prior to version 4.0) can be loaded per-process. This behavior will cause conflicts if multiple managed add-ins, targeting different versions of the CLR, are attempted to be run simultaneously.

<doc id="445961" wikidata="Q5326374" url="?curid=445961" title="Earl of Stair">
<text>Earl of Stair is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1703 for the lawyer and statesman John Dalrymple, 2nd Viscount of Stair.

Dalrymple&#x27;s father, James Dalrymple, had been a prominent lawyer; having served as Lord President of the Court of Session, he was created a baronet, of Stair in the County of Ayr, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in 1664, and in 1690 he was raised to the Peerage of Scotland as Lord Glenluce and Stranraer and Viscount of Stair.

The son, John Dalrymple, actively supported William of Orange&#x27;s claim to the throne and served as Secretary of State. However, he was forced to resign after he authorised the massacre of Glencoe of 1692. He was made Lord Newliston, Glenluce and Stranraer and Viscount of Dalrymple, at the same time as he was given the earldom, also in the Peerage of Scotland. All three titles were created with remainder, in default of male issue of his own, to the heirs male of his father.

The first Earl of Stair was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was a prominent soldier and served as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces. In 1707 Lord Stair surrendered all his honours to the Crown, and obtained a new charter empowering him to name as his successor any male descendant of the first Viscount of Stair. In 1747, shortly before his death, he nominated his nephew John Dalrymple (d. 1789), second son of his third brother George Dalrymple (d. 1745). This was mostly because his second brother Colonel the Hon. William Dalrymple (d. 1744) (heir presumptive to the peerages from 1707 to 1744) had married Penelope Crichton, 4th Countess of Dumfries, a peeress in her own right. This nomination was contested and the House of Lords decided in favour of James Dalrymple (d. 1760), the second son of the aforementioned Colonel the Hon. William Dalrymple by his wife the Countess of Dumfries. The House of Lords decided in 1748 in this case that the power of nomination could not be validly exercised after the Union. On his uncle&#x27;s death in 1747 James succeeded as third Earl of Stair.

He was childless and was succeeded by his elder brother, the fourth Earl, who had already succeeded his mother as fifth Earl of Dumfries. He was also childless and on his death in 1768 the two earldoms separated. He was succeeded in the earldom of Dumfries by his nephew Patrick McDouall(-Crichton) (see the Earl of Dumfries for later history of this title). The earldom of Stair and its subsidiary titles were passed on to his cousin, the aforementioned John Dalrymple, the fifth Earl, who in 1747 had been nominated for the earldom by his uncle the second Earl. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Earl. He sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1793 to 1807 and from 1820 to 1821 and also served as Ambassador to Prussia.
He died childless and was succeeded by his cousin, the seventh Earl. He was the son of General William Dalrymple. He also died without issue and was succeeded by his distant relative Sir John Hamilton Dalrymple, 5th Baronet, of Killock, who became the eighth Earl of Stair (see below for earlier history of the baronetcy). Lord Stair was a General in the Army and also sat as Member of Parliament for Edinburgh. In 1841 he was created Baron Oxenfoord, of Cousland in the County of Edinburgh, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, with remainder to his brother. This peerage gave the Earls an automatic seat in the House of Lords. The Oxenfoord title was in honour of his property Oxenfoord Castle, and the title held by his wife&#x27;s family, the Viscounts of Oxfuird (or Oxenfoord). He was succeeded by his younger brother (in the barony of Oxenfoord according to the special remainder), the ninth Earl.

His son, the tenth Earl, represented Wigtownshire in the House of Commons as a Conservative and served as Lord Lieutenant of Ayrshire and Wigtownshire. His grandson, the twelfth Earl, also sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Wigtownshire and served as Lord Lieutenant of Wigtownshire. On his death the titles passed to his son, the thirteenth Earl. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Wigtownshire. As of 2007 the titles are held by his eldest son, the fourteenth Earl, who succeeded in 1996. In May 2008 the fourteenth Earl was elected to sit as a Hereditary Cross-Bench Peer in the House of Lords following the death of Baroness Darcy de Knayth.

The Dalrymple Baronetcy, of Killock, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in 1698 for James Dalrymple, second son of the first Viscount of Stair. His great-grandson, the fourth Baronet, was a Baron of the Court of Exchequer in Scotland. He married his cousin Elizabeth Macgill, the heir and representative of the Viscounts of Oxfuird (or Oxenfoord). Their son, the aforementioned fifth Baronet, succeeded his kinsman as Earl of Stair in 1840. See above for further history of the baronetcy.

Another member of the Dalrymple family was Hew Dalrymple, third son of the first Viscount of Stair. He served as Lord President of the Session under the judicial title Lord North Berwick. In 1697 he was created a baronet, of North Berwick in the County of Haddington, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. His second son Hew Dalrymple was the great-grandfather of Robert Dalrymple-Horn-Elphinstone, who was created a baronet, of Horn, and Logie Elphinstone in the County of Aberdeen, in 1828. See Dalrymple baronets for more information on these branches of the family.

The title of the earldom comes from the hamlet of Stair, the ancestral home of the Dalrymple family who settled there in the 12th century. To facilitate the original title, in 1653 James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount Stair, had a portion of Ochiltree severed so as to create the Parish of Stair.

The family seat is Lochinch Castle near Stranraer, Wigtownshire and Oxenfoord Castle, near Pathhead, Midlothian.

<text>Rysy (; ; , ) is a mountain in the crest of the High Tatras, eastern part of the Tatra Mountains, lying on the border between Poland and Slovakia. Rysy has three summits: the middle at ; the north-western at ; and the south-eastern at . The north-western summit is the highest point of Poland and belongs to the Crown of Polish Mountains; the other two summits are on the Slovak side of the border.

==Name==
Experts assume that the Polish and Slovak name &quot;Rysy&quot;, meaning &quot;scratches&quot; or &quot;crevices&quot;, refers to a series of couloirs, either those on the western slopes of Żabie Ridge or the very prominent high couloir and numerous smaller on the northern side. A folk explanation on the Slovak side says that the name comes from the plural word &quot;rysy&quot; meaning &quot;lynxes&quot;, although the habitat of the lynx does not extend above the timberline.

The Hungarian name &quot;Tengerszem-csúcs&quot; and the German name &quot;Meeraugspitze&quot; mean &quot;eye-of-the-sea peak&quot;, from the glacial lake at the northern foot of the mountain, called &quot;eye of the sea&quot; (&quot;Morskie Oko&quot; in Polish).

==History==
The first known ascent was made in 1840, by Ede Blásy and his guide Ján Ruman-Driečny Sr. The first winter ascent was completed in 1884, by Theodor Wundt and Jakob Harvey.

==Hiking the peak==

It is possible to reach the peak from the Slovak side, starting at Štrbské pleso and passing &quot;Chata pod Rysmi&quot;, a mountain chalet at an altitude of . Between November 1 and June 15, the trail and chalet on the Slovak side are closed.

The mountain can also be ascended from the Polish side coming from the Morskie Oko lake, which is a more spectacular route, but at the same brings more difficulties and exposure. The trail leads from Morskie Oko to Czarny Staw, and from there first along the northern slope and then the west wall. Due to its location, the trail might have snow cover until the second half of June and winter equipment might be required for the ascent then.

The winter ascent from the Polish side is a serious climb requiring the right equipment (crampons, ice axe) and skills, often with a large avalanche threat. There have been serious avalanche events, including fatal ones. The average slope of the slope above the Czarny Staw is around 30 degrees. In the Rysa couloir, about 40 degrees to its half. In the upper part, the incline reaches up to 44 degrees.

Since the accession of Poland and Slovakia to the Schengen Agreement in 2007, the border between the two countries may be easily crossed at this point like at any other.

<doc id="445964" wikidata="Q11681570" url="?curid=445964" title="Escape to Witch Mountain">
<text>Escape to Witch Mountain is a science fiction novel written by Alexander Key in 1968. It was adapted for film by Disney as &quot;Escape to Witch Mountain&quot; in 1975 which spawned the &quot;Witch Mountain&quot; franchise. The novel was illustrated by Leon B. Wisdom, Jr. and originally published in 1968 by the Westminster Press in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

== Plot ==
Tony and Tia are orphaned teenagers who have paranormal abilities. Tony possesses the ability of telekinesis, which he can access most readily through playing music, particularly his harmonica. Tia&#x27;s strengths include the ability to unlock any door by touch and communication with animals. Both siblings can communicate via ultrasonic speech audible only to each other, but Tia cannot speak normally and is regarded as strange because of this. It is later revealed that Tia is not unusual in this respect, but Tony is; few of their kind have the ability to speak out loud. After their foster guardian, Mrs. Malone, dies, they are placed by social services in a juvenile detention home under grim, unwholesome conditions, where Tia befriends a black cat, Winkie.

Both have suppressed memories of their past, but discover a clue in an old road map hidden along with a cache of money in Tia&#x27;s &quot;star box&quot;, a leather purse-like box with a double-star design on it. In a chance encounter with a nun who is an art teacher, the nun reveals that she once received a letter on stationery with an identical design. The writer, a Blue Ridge Mountains resident with &quot;a name like Caroway, or Garroway, or Hideaway&quot; sought information on students who had &quot;unusual aptitudes&quot;. When a man named Lucas Deranian, claiming to be the brother of their deceased father, shows up at the detention center to take custody of them, they instinctively know he is not their uncle and has ulterior motives. However, when they attempt to reach the nun, they find that she has died.

With the assistance of an inner-city Roman Catholic priest, Father O&#x27;Day, the pair run away, following the map&#x27;s route leading towards the Blue Ridge Mountains. As their memories begin to return, they realize that they are actually of extraterrestrial origin, their people having come to Earth because their own planet was drifting towards one of its two suns. Their flying saucer was shot down over Hungary, resulting in the deaths of all but Tony, Tia, and Uncle Bené – a non-relative, but one of their own people, who rescued the children from Soviet captivity. The book ties this event to the Hungarian Uprising in 1956.

Through a series of hardships, Tony and Tia find their way to their own people, who adopted the name Castaway. When the teenagers&#x27; would-be captor, Deranian (whom O&#x27;Day earlier in the novel had likened to the devil), attempts to interrogate Father O&#x27;Day, the priest speaks to the effect that God is capable of creating many worlds and many peoples; that there are &quot;mysteries far beyond [Deranian&#x27;s] narrow dreaming&quot;.

As with most of Alexander Key&#x27;s stories, the embattled protagonists find that most of the people they meet are untrustworthy, greedy, and hateful — making the decency of the few all the more poignant. O&#x27;Day puts himself in danger in order to help Tony and Tia, but he does so willingly, because their battle presents O&#x27;Day with an opportunity to fight the agents of evil, which is what he knows is his purpose in life and will deliver meaning to his life.

<text>The Battle of Lobositz or Lovosice also Lowositz on 1 October 1756 was the opening land battle of the Third Silesian War and the wider Seven Years&#x27; War. Frederick the Great&#x27;s 28,000 Prussians were prevented by 33,000 Austrians under Maximilian Ulysses Count von Browne from continuing their invasion into the rich Bohemian plain, forcing Frederick to ultimately fall back north into Saxony for the winter.

==Prelude==
Being a believer in the pre-emptive strike, on 29 August 1756 Frederick invaded Saxony with the bulk of the Prussian army, against the advice of his British allies. Neither the Saxon nor the Austrian army was ready for war. The Saxon army took up a strong defensive position near Pirna, and Frederick had no option but to isolate and try to starve them into surrendering. Meanwhile, realizing that the siege would take some time, he was compelled to leave a covering force around Pirna and head south through the rough Mittel-Gebirge of northern Bohemia to establish a winter base in the rich Bohemian plain.

An Austrian army under Field Marshal von Browne had prepared a fortified base at Budin to block any Prussian moves out of the Mittel-Gebirge. Browne had been in secret communication with the Saxon prime minister, Heinrich Count Bruhl, and had planned a rescue mission up the right bank of the Elbe to Königstein, near Pirna, to help the Saxon army escape across the river and join its allies. On the 28th, Browne received an enthusiastic agreement from Bruhl on his proposal; the date of the rendezvous of the two forces was to be the night of 11/12 September.

Meanwhile, Frederick and his 28,000 men were making their way through the Mittel-Gebirge toward the Bohemian plain. Browne&#x27;s intelligence told him that the Prussians would exit from the mountains at Lobositz, modern day Lovosice in the Czech Republic a few miles northwest of his fortified base at Budin. He recalled his small relief force up the Elbe and raced with 33,000 men up to Lobositz on the 28th to lay an ambush for Frederick as he debouched from the narrow passes of the mountains.

==Battle==

The Austrian army took up defensive positions on an extinct volcano above Lobositz, the Lobosch, deploying their battalions from Croatia among the walled vineyards that covered the lower flanks of that hill. These, in turn, were supported by 7,800 regular infantry under Franz Moritz von Lacy, hidden from view on the eastern side of the mountain. In front of the town Browne set up a relatively small force of cavalry and grenadier battalions as bait. Behind these, and hidden by a sunken road, he positioned more irregulars and grenadiers in ambush, and behind these he positioned a reserve brigade of cuirassiers. On the south Browne hid the bulk of his army on the other side of a marsh defined by the Morellenbach. He had his battalions lie down in the tall grass and hid his heavy cavalry squadrons behind the woods of a game preserve next to the village of Sullowitz. In this village he also placed some battalions of infantry and artillery. Most of his army was hidden from Prussian view by morning mist and terrain.

On the morning of 1 October, in heavy fog, Frederick&#x27;s Prussians approached Lobositz in column of route. They were completely unaware that they were walking into a trap. The Austrians irregulars on the Lobosch began to fire at them and Frederick dispatched Duke of Brunswick-Bevern with seven battalions of infantry to brush them off. The center of the Prussian position between the two mountains, the Lobosch to the north and the Ovcin to the south, was dominated by a low spur called the Homolka. The few irregulars defending this were chased away and the Prussians unlimbered a battery of heavy artillery on it. From the Homolka, in the slowly dissolving fog and squinting into the sunrise, it looked to Frederick and his staff as though the plain below them was occupied by only a few cavalry. Their consensus was that Browne was in retreat and had just left this small rear guard.

The Prussian battery on the Homolka began to fire on the scurrying cavalry below them, who had been repeatedly shuffled around by their commanders to make them moving targets. These were composed of a regiment of the Kaiser Franz Dragoons, some combined cavalry of elite companies, and two small regiments of hussars (Hadik and Baranyay).

In the meantime, Frederick&#x27;s main force of infantry began to deploy into line between the Homolka mound and the Lobosch. They were, in turn, backed by several lines of the main Prussian cavalry force, over 10,000 in all, in the narrow valley behind them; the steep, vine-covered flanks not suitable for the normal 18th century deployment of cavalry on the army&#x27;s wings.

As the mist lifted, a heretofore hidden battery of Austrian heavy guns in front of Lobositz (12 pounders and howitzers) began to fire on the exposed Prussian infantry. Frederick&#x27;s artillery commander, Karl Friedrich von Moller, brought up the rest of his own heavy guns and howitzers on the Prussian left to answer this new threat. But for the next few hours, the Prussian infantry (who, apparently and unlike the Austrians, remained standing in close ranks) took heavy casualties.

Anxious to end this and brush away what he thought was an annoying rear guard, Frederick took his staff&#x27;s advice and ordered a limited cavalry charge down the hill to chase the few Austrians away. Led by Lt. Gen. Kyau, some 1,200 Prussian cuirassiers charged the Austrian horse and drove them back toward the Elbe. Continuing on, however, the Prussian squadrons came upon the unexpected sunken road between Lobositz and the Morellenbach, in which were hidden several hundred irregulars and Austrian grenadiers. The Prussian cuirassiers were also surprised by considerable fire from their right flank by massed batteries of artillery and infantry hidden in the village of Sullowitz. As the surviving Prussian cavalry made their way forward in disorder across the sunken road, assailed on the right and left by the ambush laid for them, they were finally counterattacked by a hidden brigade of 1,300 fresh Austrian cuirassiers (the Cordua and Stampach Regiments under Karel Adam Felix von Lobkowitz) and thrown back. The Prussian troopers retreated with heavy casualties back up the Homolka.

It was suddenly apparent from this surprising setback that Frederick was not facing any mere rear guard but the entire Austrian army, deployed in a strong, flanking position. Moreover, the action on the Prussian left up on the Lobosch mountain was also proving to be much more strongly held than anticipated. Bevern was having no luck in &quot;brushing aside&quot; the irregulars from the vineyards, who had themselves, all morning, been heavily reinforced by Lacy&#x27;s infantry. But even worse was to come.

Seeing his fellow cavalrymen humiliated and repulsed, General Gessler, Frederick&#x27;s chief of cavalry, took it upon himself to order a general charge with all his remaining squadrons. Gessler had evidently been stung by a reprimand on his courage by the Prussian King a few days before and was anxious to amend the insult. He was also merely obeying Frederick&#x27;s standing order to all of his cavalry to never let a check go unanswered, but to always attack on its own initiative. So filtering all of his 7,200 troopers through the Prussian infantry, Gessler led a massive charge down into the floodplain. As he watched this charge unfold, Frederick was said to have exclaimed, &quot;My God, what is my cavalry doing! They&#x27;re attacking a second time, and nobody gave the order!&quot;

The results were the same as the first charge, but on a larger scale. The Prussian squadrons were raked on their flanks by the hidden Austrian guns and infantry, and counterattacked by the now-reinforced Austrian cavalry. A few Prussian cuirassiers attempted to struggle across the muddy Morellenbach to get at the main Austrian guns but their horses were so blown that they couldn&#x27;t climb the bank on the far side and were mowed down by the Austrian battalions (now standing up) at the top. In the end, all of Frederick&#x27;s cavalry were spent and forced to retreat.

As in another of his first battles, Mollwitz, Frederick was convinced at this point that he had lost this one and abandoned the field. In that other battle, too, fifteen years before, it was his cavalry that had let him down. This time he withdrew to the village of Wchinitz behind his front line and left command of the battle to Bevern and Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick.

For his part, Bevern was not so discouraged. His original seven battalions on Lobositz had shot away all of their ammunition without dislodging the irregulars from the vineyards. He grabbed more battalions from the Prussian center and threw them into the fight on the hill. When told by his men, unused to this kind of broken country fighting, that they had run out of ammunition, he was reported to have sneered, &quot;What! Haven&#x27;t you got bayonets? Skewer the dogs dead!&quot; and led a charge across the slopes. The Austrians and irregulars on Lobosch, too, had run out of ammunition themselves and had also been fighting all day. They started to slowly fall back into the town, defending the gates tenaciously. But the Prussian artillery commander, von Moller, ordered his howitzers to set fire to the town and drive the defenders out. Hundreds of Austrian wounded and even captured Prussian wounded in Lobositz were burned alive in the fire before they could all be gotten out.

It was now about sunset (17:42 at this time of year at this latitude) and both sides, after having fought all day long, stopped firing. Browne brought all of his surviving right wing safely through Lobositz and over the Morellenbach. Both armies went into bivouac for the night. Browne had lost about 2,900 men during the battle. The Prussians, themselves having lost about the same number, had fully expected to have to resume fighting the next day, this time attacking across the formidable marsh of the Morellen. But during the night Browne, having accomplished his immediate objective of stopping Frederick&#x27;s momentum, ordered his army to fall back to the prepared lines of Budin.

It wasn&#x27;t until late that night that the rattled Frederick was convinced by Bevern and Brunswick that he hadn&#x27;t lost this, his first battle of the war. And when, the next morning, he saw that Browne had pulled out during the night, he was greatly relieved. There was a saying going around the army, comparing these enemies to those they had so easily beaten during the previous war, &quot;These are no longer the same old Austrians.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Both sides lost about the same number of men each, about 2,900, which was more severe for the initially smaller Prussian army Frederick, still shaken in the following days, decided his only political option was to proclaim Lobositz as a victory by 18th century rules of combat (since Browne had left the field of battle). However, Browne had done exactly what he had set out to do: stop Frederick at Lobositz and cover his own crossing of the Elbe further upstream to go and rescue the Saxon army at Pirna. Indeed, Frederick, though he sat on the &quot;field of victory&quot;, never advanced beyond Lobositz and within two weeks had ordered a general retreat back into Saxony. So, strategically, with his army intact, Bohemia safe, and his way north to the Saxons unhindered, Browne could be thought of as having won a strategic victory at Lobositz.

In the aftermath, Browne did lead his rescue mission north, with a picked force of 8,000 men, down the right (eastern) bank of the Elbe. Though suffering from tuberculosis himself and coughing up blood, Browne drove himself and his men through rain and mountain passes to arrive at his rendezvous point, Königstein, at precisely the date he promised the Saxons, October 11. However, the Saxons had not lived up to their own promise to cross the Elbe at Königstein on that date, and procrastinated. The dissembling Count Bruhl was negotiating with the Prussians for a better deal and kept sending disingenuous pleas for patience to Browne. By the 14th, the Prussians, finally alerted to the presence of the Austrians waiting on the right bank opposite Königstein, had crossed with a blocking force themselves. By then Bruhl and the Saxon King Augustus III, as well as the senior Saxon general staff, surrendered the entire Saxon army to Frederick, and had negotiated some fairly lucrative compensation arrangements for themselves. The Saxon regiments were all incorporated whole into the Prussian army (as IRs 50-59). However, this political-military coup proved short-lived for most of the infantry regiments defected within a year. And the Saxon cavalry regiments took it upon themselves (including Count Bruhl&#x27;s own chevauleger regiment) to escape and fight intact for the Austrians.

Browne brought his rescue party safely back to his base at Budin, having failed in his mission, but through no fault of his own. By the end of October, the entire Prussian army had retreated out of Bohemia and back across the Elbe to winter in Saxony. So the end of 1756, the first year of the Seven Years&#x27; War, ended in a stalemate, but with Austria in a good strategic position for 1757.

<doc id="445974" wikidata="Q17275264" url="?curid=445974" title="Callitropsis nootkatensis">
<text>Callitropsis nootkatensis, formerly known as Cupressus nootkatensis (syn. &quot;Xanthocyparis nootkatensis, Chamaecyparis nootkatensis&quot;), is a species of tree in the cypress family native to the coastal regions of northwestern North America. This species goes by many common names including: Nootka cypress, yellow cypress, Alaska cypress, Nootka cedar, yellow cedar, Alaska cedar, and Alaska yellow cedar. The specific epithet &quot;nootkatensis&quot; is derived from the species being from the area of Nootka Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island, Canada. Both locations are named for the older European name Nootka, given the Nuu-chah-nulth First Nation.

== Description ==
&quot;Callitropsis nootkatensis&quot; is an evergreen conifer growing up to tall, exceptionally , with diameters up to . The bark is thin, smooth and purplish when young, turning flaky and gray. The branches are commonly pendulous, with foliage in flat sprays and dark green scale-leaves measuring long. The cones, maturing biannually, have 4 (occasionally 6) scales, and resemble the cones of &quot;Cupressus lusitanica&quot; (another species which can show foliage in flat sprays), except being somewhat smaller, typically in diameter; each scale has a pointed triangular bract about 1.5–2 mm long, again similar to other &quot;Cupressus&quot; and unlike the crescent-shaped, non-pointed bract on the scales of &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot; cones. The winged seeds are small, thus dispersing at a close range; additionally, only a small percentage is viable.

The Caren Range on the west coast of British Columbia is home to the oldest Nootka cypress specimens in the world, with one specimen found to be 1,834 years old; some specimens may be over 3,000 years old.

&quot;Callitropsis nootkatensis&quot; is one of the parents of the hybrid Leyland cypress; the other parent, Monterey cypress (&quot;Hesperocyparis macrocarpa)&quot;, was also considered to be in the genus &quot;Cupressus&quot;, but in the North American &quot;Hesperocyparis&quot; clade, which has generally been found to be phylogenetically closer to &quot;C. nootkatensis&quot; than the Old World clade &quot;Cupressus&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==
First described in the genus &quot;Cupressus&quot; as &quot;Cupressus nootkatensis&quot; in 1824 based on a specimen collected &quot;ad Sinum Nootka dictum&quot;, which translates to &quot;said Bay of Nootka&quot;. It was transferred to &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot; in 1841 on the basis of its foliage being in flattened sprays, as in other &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot;, but unlike most (though not all) other &quot;Cupressus&quot; species. However, this placement does not fit with the morphology and phenology of the cones, which are far more like &quot;Cupressus&quot;, maturing in two years rather than one. Genetic evidence, published by Gadek et al., strongly supported its return to &quot;Cupressus&quot; and exclusion from &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot;.

Farjon &quot;et al.&quot; (2002) transferred it to a new genus &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot;, together with the newly discovered Vietnamese golden cypress (&quot;Xanthocyparis vietnamensis)&quot;; this species is remarkably similar to Nootka cypress and the treatment has many arguments in its favour, as while they are not related to &quot;Chamaecyparis&quot;, neither do they fit fully in &quot;Cupressus&quot; despite the many similarities.
Little et al. confirmed this relationship with further evidence and pointed out that an earlier nomenclatural combination in the genus &quot;Callitropsis&quot; existed, as &quot;Callitropsis nootkatensis&quot; (D.Don) Oerst., published in 1864 but overlooked or ignored by other subsequent authors. Little et al. therefore synonymised &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot; with &quot;Callitropsis&quot;, the correct name for these species under the ICBN when treated in a distinct genus. The name &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot; has now been proposed for conservation, and the 2011 International Botanical Congress followed that recommendation.

In 2010, Mao et al. performed a more detailed molecular analysis and placed Nootka cypress back in &quot;Cupressus&quot;. This was disputed, as the tree would compose a monophyletic subgenus, but the Gymnosperm Database suggested that it could comprise a monotypic genus as &quot;Callitropsis nootkatensis&quot;.
In 2021, a molecular study by Stull et al. found the species to indeed belong to the distinct genus &quot;Callitropsis&quot; and recovered this as the sister genus to &quot;Hesperocyparis&quot;. The clade comprising both was found to be sister to &quot;Xanthocyparis&quot; (containing only the Vietnamese golden cypress), and the clade containing the three genera was found to be sister to a clade containing &quot;Juniperus&quot; and &quot;Cupressus sensu stricto&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species grows in moist areas of coastal mountains of the Pacific Northwest, including those of the Cascades, from the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska to the Klamath Mountains in northernmost California. It can be found at elevations higher than those reached by &quot;Thuja plicata&quot; (western redcedar), sometimes in a &quot;krummholz&quot; form, and even occupying very rocky sites (near the California-Oregon border). It can be found at elevations of in Southeast Alaska and between from coastal British Columbia into Oregon. Isolated groves near Nelson, British Columbia, and John Day, Oregon, may be the descendants of local populations dating to the Last Glacial Period.

== Ecology ==
The tree benefits from annual precipitation exceeding , particularly in deep snow though with temperatures not often dropping below . Snow tends not to break the flexible branches. It is shade tolerant, but less so than associated mountain hemlock (&quot;Tsuga mertensiana)&quot; and Pacific silver fir (&quot;Abies amabilis)&quot;, and grows slowly. Anti-fungal chemicals within the tree aid in its longevity. It is also rarely afflicted by insects, although is susceptible to heart rot.

In Alaska, where the tree is primarily referred to as &quot;yellow cedar&quot;, extensive research has been conducted into large-scale die-offs of yellow cedar stands. These studies have concluded that the tree has depended upon heavy coastal snowpacks to insulate its shallow roots from cold Arctic winters. The impacts of climate change have resulted in thinner, less-persistent snowpacks, in turn causing increased susceptibility to freeze damage. This mortality has been observed over 7% of the species range, covering approximately 10 degrees of latitude from northern southeast Alaska to southern British Columbia. Substantial future mortality is likely due to warming temperatures and decreasing snowpacks. The U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service is reviewing whether to designate the species as threatened or endangered.

==Uses==

The Nootka cypress is used extensively by the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast, along with another cypress, &quot;Thuja plicata&quot; (western redcedar). While the wood and inner bark of western redcedar was preferred for larger projects like houses and canoes, the stronger inner bark of Nootka cypress was used for smaller vessels and utensils, including canoe paddles and baskets, as well as thread for clothing and blankets.

This species has been considered to be one of the finest timber trees in the world and has been exported to China during the last century. The wood has been used for flooring, interior finish and shipbuilding.
The tree has extreme heartwood qualities that make it one of the most desired sources of firewood on the West Coast. It burns very hot and lasts a long time as embers. A tree can still be used for firewood up to 100 years after its death.

===Construction===
The various physical properties of the wood make it an attractive material for both general construction and boatbuilding. Due to its slow growth it is hard and, like other cypress woods, it is durable; it therefore offers good dimensional stability and is resistant to weather, insects, and contact with soil. It works easily with hand or machine tools, turning and carving quite well. It can be fastened with glues, screws, and nails. Nootka cypress&#x27;s texture, uniform color, and straight grain will take a fine finish. It resists splintering and wears smoothly over time. When fresh cut it has a somewhat unpleasant bitter scent, but when seasoned it has barely any discernible odor, hence its traditional use in face masks.

Due to its expense, it is used mainly for finished carpentry. Typical uses include exterior siding, shingles, decking, exposed beams, glue-laminated beams, paneling, cabinetry, and millwork. In historic preservation it can be used as a substitute for &quot;Thuja plicata&quot; (western redcedar) and &quot;Taxodium distichum&quot; (bald cypress), due to current difficulties in obtaining quality timber of those species due to environmental concern and past over-exploitation, although this applies equally to Nootka cypress.

Other uses for Nootka cypress include saunas, and battery containers due to its resistance to acids. Traditionally, paddles, masks, dishes, and bows were made from the wood.

===Landscaping===
The drooping branchlets give the tree a graceful weeping appearance. It makes an attractive specimen tree in parks and open spaces. It can also be used as a tall hedge. It will grow in USDA plant hardiness zones 5–9, but can be difficult to grow. Best growth is in light or heavy soil, preferably well drained, and in climates with cool summers. It prefers semi-shade to full sun. It can also be used in bonsai.

Under the synonym &quot;Xanthocyparis nootkatensis&quot; the cultivar &quot;C. nootkatensis&quot; &#x27;Pendula&#x27; has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

A legend amongst the Nootka peoples of the Hesquiaht First Nation tells of the origins of the Nootka cypress. In the legend, a raven encounters three young women drying salmon on the beach. He asks the women if they are afraid of being alone, or of bears, wolves, and other animals. Each woman responded &quot;no&quot;. But when asked about owls, the women were indeed afraid of owls. Hearing this, the trickster raven hid in the forests, and made the calls of an owl. The terrified women ran up the mountains, but turned into Nootka cypress trees when they were out of breath. According to the Nootka, this is why Nootka cypress grows on the sides of mountains, and also why the bark is silky like a woman&#x27;s hair, and the young trunk is smooth like a woman&#x27;s body.

In Tlingit culture the story of Natsilane describes how a Nootka cypress was used to carve the world&#x27;s first killer whale.

<doc id="445975" wikidata="Q241830" url="?curid=445975" title="David Ervine">
<text>David Ervine (21 July 1953 – 8 January 2007) was a Northern Irish Ulster Loyalist and politician who served as leader of the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) from 2002 to 2007 and was also a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLA) for Belfast East from 1998 to 2007. During his youth Ervine was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and was imprisoned for possessing bomb-making equipment. Whilst in jail he became convinced of the benefits of a more political approach for loyalism and became involved with the PUP. As a leading PUP figure, Ervine helped to deliver the loyalist ceasefire of 1994.

== Early life ==
David Ervine was the youngest of five children born to Walter and Elizabeth Ervine. He was raised in a Protestant working-class area of east Belfast between the Albertbridge and Newtownards roads. His household was not loyalist at all: his father Walter described himself as a socialist, had no time for Ian Paisley and didn&#x27;t attend church. When Ervine joined the Orange Order aged 18, he said he was the first member of his family to ever be a member. His membership, however, did not last long. Like many in his situation, he grew up closely identifying with his community and absorbed its unionist ideals and opinions. Ervine left Orangefield High School (Orangefield Boys Secondary School) at 14 and, aged 19, joined the UVF, believing this step to be the only way to ensure the defence of the Protestant community after the events of Bloody Friday. A neighbour of Ervine&#x27;s, William Irvine, who was a member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), had died in one of the bomb blasts on that day.

Before joining the UVF Ervine had attempted to join the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), but due to a misdemeanour in his childhood involving a stolen bicycle he was refused entry.

== Arrest and imprisonment ==
Ervine was arrested in November 1974, while an active member of the UVF. He was driving a stolen car containing five pounds of commercial explosives, a detonator and fuse wire. After seven months on remand in Crumlin Road Gaol, he was found guilty of possession of explosives with intent to endanger life. He was sentenced to 11 years and imprisoned in The Maze. While in prison, Ervine came under the influence of Gusty Spence who made him question what the loyalist struggle was about. Spence&#x27;s influence unquestionably changed Ervine&#x27;s direction: after much study and self-analysis, Ervine emerged with the view that change through politics was the only option. He also became friends with Billy Hutchinson while in prison.

== Release ==
Ervine was released from prison in 1980. He owned a newsagents&#x27; in Belfast for several years before taking up full-time politics. He stood in local council elections as a Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) candidate in 1985. In 1998, he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly to represent Belfast East and was re-elected in 2003. He was also a member of Belfast City Council from 1997.

== Loyalist ceasefire ==
Ervine played a pivotal role in bringing civil disorder to the loyalist ceasefire of October 1994. He was part of a delegation to Downing Street in June 1996 that met then British Prime Minister John Major to discuss the loyalist ceasefire.

== Forum ==
In 1996 Ervine was elected to the Northern Ireland Forum from the regional list, having been an unsuccessful candidate in the East Belfast constituency.

== Progressive ==
Ervine was considered to be one of the most progressive unionists in Northern Ireland politics. He had been a strong supporter of the Good Friday Agreement and was one of the few unionist politicians actively to support the Agreement. At a Labour Party meeting in 2001, then Northern Ireland Secretary, John Reid, described him as &quot;one of the most eloquent politicians in Northern Ireland&quot;. Some of his political peers, such as John Reid, made references to him having swallowed a dictionary, in reference to coming more informative and educated. In &quot;Landscapes of Defense&quot;, Ervine was seen as one of the few politicians actively engaged with conflict resolution.

In the Northern Ireland Assembly, he was seen as a Unionist sympathetic to the short-term demands of Sinn Féin, resisting attempts by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to exclude Sinn Féin from office in July 2000 and October 2001. In April 2001, he provoked a direct political attack from the DUP over being the only unionist to vote against a motion condemning the display of lilies commemorating the 1916 Easter Rising at Parliament Buildings. Ervine also expressed support for the right of Sinn Féin members to make speeches in Irish on the floor of the Assembly. Later, editors and political commentators such as John Laverty noted how he sat next to Sinn Féin&#x27;s Martin McGuinness at the funeral of Northern Ireland football legend George Best in December 2005 as a sign of how Northern Ireland had moved on.

== Independent Monitoring Commission ==
In May 2005, the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) recommended a continuation of the financial sanctions on Ervine&#x27;s Assembly salary imposed following its report of April 2004. The IMC was of the opinion that the UVF and the PUP maintained strong links while the former was heavily involved in criminality such as drug dealing and tobacco and fuel smuggling. It further noted that the UVF was responsible for a number of acts of violence (including murder) and was actively maintaining its capacity to wage a terrorist campaign. It concluded that, 12 months after the sanctions were originally imposed, the PUP leadership was still not doing enough to address the UVF&#x27;s criminal and paramilitary activities.

Ervine appealed the IMC&#x27;s recommendation to newly appointed Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Hain on the basis that he could not be held directly responsible for the UVF&#x27;s actions and thus it was wrong to penalise him personally. Hain accepted his representations and his Assembly salary was fully restored.

The IMC again recommended financial sanctions against Ervine and the PUP. These came in a special report of September 2005 on the violent feud that had erupted between the UVF and the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) that summer, in which a number of murders and attempted murders had been committed. It argued that the PUP leadership was still in a position significantly to influence the UVF: the party could not have it both ways by associating with an active paramilitary organisation without facing political consequences.

In its final regular reports of Ervine&#x27;s life in April and October 2006, the IMC concluded that it was satisfied the PUP leadership had taken appropriate action to de-escalate UVF&#x27;s violence and criminality, and it withdrew its punitive recommendations.

== Links with Ulster Unionists ==
On 13 May 2006, it was announced that when the Northern Ireland Assembly reconvened, Ervine would join the Ulster Unionist assembly group, while remaining leader of the Progressive Unionist Party. Under the D&#x27;Hondt method used for allocating places on the Northern Ireland Executive, this would entitle the Ulster Unionists to an additional place.

The Presiding Officer (Speaker) of the Assembly, Eileen Bell MLA indicated at the first meeting of the &#x27;shadow&#x27; Assembly (15 May 2006) that she would take legal advice before ruling on whether Mr Ervine could be treated as a member of the UUP group.

On 11 September 2006 Ms Bell announced that the Ulster Unionist Party Assembly Group did not have a headquarters, at least one party leader and a scheme for financial support; thus it did not qualify as a political party. This meant that the UUPAG could not sit in the Assembly, so the alliance was deemed as invalid.

== Identity ==
Ervine was a Protestant and identified himself as both Irish and British. He once exclaimed &quot;why can&#x27;t I be an Irish citizen of the UK?&quot; and remarked: &quot;I am profoundly both British and Irish and those who have to deal with me have to take me on those terms.&quot;

== Allegations of collusion with security forces ==
Ervine dismissed allegations of collusion between loyalists and British security forces as &quot;sheer unadulterated nonsense&quot;, saying, &quot;there comes a point when the concept insults me, insomuch as that a Provo could lie in bed and with a crystal ball... could pick their targets but a Prod could only do the same if there was an SAS man driving the car&quot;.

Ervine cited his own arrest, and the number of UVF members in prison at the time, as evidence that widespread collusion did not exist:&quot;The Royal Ulster Constabulary arrested me on possession of explosives; now why did they do that if we lived in a process of collusion? When I went into jail there were 240 UVF men in three compounds, packed in like sardines, and the UVF were a relatively small organisation in comparison to some of the others, but they made up a hell of a percentage of that jail. Where’s collusion there?&quot;

== Illness and death ==
Ervine was reported as having suffered two massive heart attacks and a stroke after attending a football match between Glentoran and Armagh City at The Oval in Belfast on Saturday 6 January 2007. It was later confirmed that he had one heart attack, a stroke and brain haemorrhage. He was taken to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald and was later admitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. Ervine died on Monday 8 January 2007. RTÉ News at 9pm and its website had reported the previous evening that he had died that day. This incorrect reporting led RTÉ&#x27;s Northern Editor, Tommie Gorman, to apologise for his error.

Ervine&#x27;s body was cremated at Roselawn Crematorium after a funeral service on 12 January in East Belfast. It was attended by Mark Durkan, George Cassidy, Gerry Adams, Peter Hain, Dermot Ahern, Hugh Orde and David Trimble, among others.

=== Tributes ===
*Brian Ervine, Ervine&#x27;s elder brother: &quot;&quot;He had the guts and the courage to climb out of the traditional trenches, meet the enemy in no-man&#x27;s land and play ball with him&quot;.&quot;
*Bertie Ahern (Taoiseach): &quot;(Ervine) was a courageous politician who sought to channel the energies of loyalism in a positive political direction.&quot;
*Reg Empey MLA: &quot;Northern Ireland has today lost a unique, charismatic and uncharacteristically spin-free politician.&quot;
*Gerry Adams MLA/MP: &quot;He made a valuable and important contribution to moving our society away from conflict.&quot;
*George Mitchell (Former US Senator): &quot;His legacy is that he has led loyalism out of the Dark Ages.&quot;
*Mark Durkan MLA/MP: &quot;&quot;David emerged from a paramilitary past to pursue a peaceful future. Throughout the talks he played a positive role and worked always to keep loyalism onboard for the Good Friday Agreement.&quot; (...) &quot;He also championed a more constructive unionism and argued that we can all gain from political accommodation.&quot;
*Trevor Sargent TD: &quot;His death leaves a major vacuum in terms of the quality of political representatives in Northern Ireland. I hope that the legacy of Mr Ervine&#x27;s bravery will be taken up by others after him.&quot;
*Tony Blair (British Prime Minister): &quot;David was a man who, whatever his past, played a major part in this last 10 years in trying to bring peace to Ulster.&quot;

== Legacy ==
A memorial for David Ervine was erected on the Albertbridge Road, East Belfast.

In 2023, Robert Niblock wrote a play about David Ervine, named &quot;The Man Who Swallowed a Dictionary&quot;. Niblock said attendees ranged from republicans to ex-prisoners and politicians, all of whom had praised the play. It premiered in the Lyric Theatre in August of that year.

<text>In set theory and related branches of mathematics, the von Neumann universe, or von Neumann hierarchy of sets, denoted by V, is the class of hereditary well-founded sets. This collection, which is formalized by Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC), is often used to provide an interpretation or motivation of the axioms of ZFC. The concept is named after John von Neumann, although it was first published by Ernst Zermelo in 1930.

The rank of a well-founded set is defined inductively as the smallest ordinal number greater than the ranks of all members of the set. In particular, the rank of the empty set is zero, and every ordinal has a rank equal to itself. The sets in &quot;V&quot; are divided into the transfinite hierarchy &quot;Vα&quot;, called the cumulative hierarchy, based on their rank.

== Definition ==

The cumulative hierarchy is a collection of sets &quot;V&quot;α
indexed by the class of ordinal numbers; in particular, &quot;V&quot;α is the set of all sets having ranks less than α. Thus there is one set &quot;V&quot;α for each ordinal number α. &quot;V&quot;α may be defined by transfinite recursion as follows:

* Let &quot;V&quot;0 be the empty set:formula_1
* For any ordinal number β, let &quot;V&quot;β+1 be the power set of &quot;V&quot;β:formula_2
* For any limit ordinal λ, let &quot;V&quot;λ be the union of all the &quot;V&quot;-stages so far:formula_3
A crucial fact about this definition is that there is a single formula φ(α,&quot;x&quot;) in the language of ZFC that states &quot;the set &quot;x&quot; is in &quot;V&quot;α&quot;.

The sets &quot;V&quot;α are called stages or ranks.

The class &quot;V&quot; is defined to be the union of all the &quot;V&quot;-stages:

formula_4

===Rank of a set===

The rank of a set &quot;S&quot; is the smallest α such that formula_5 In other words, formula_6 is the set of sets with rank ≤α. The stage &quot;V&quot;α can also be characterized as the set of sets with rank strictly less than α, regardless of whether α is 0, a successor ordinal, or a limit ordinal:

formula_7

This gives an equivalent definition of &quot;V&quot;α by transfinite recursion.

Substituting the above definition of &quot;V&quot;α back into the definition of the rank of a set gives a self-contained recursive definition:

In other words,

formula_8

===Finite and low cardinality stages of the hierarchy===

The first five von Neumann stages &quot;V&quot;0 to &quot;V&quot;4 may be visualized as follows. (An empty box represents the empty set. A box containing only an empty box represents the set containing only the empty set, and so forth.)

This sequence exhibits tetrational growth. The set &quot;V&quot;5 contains 216 = 65536 elements; the set &quot;V&quot;6 contains 265536 elements, which very substantially exceeds the number of atoms in the known universe; and for any natural &quot;n&quot;, the set &quot;V&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 contains 2 ⇈ &quot;n&quot; elements using Knuth&#x27;s up-arrow notation. So the finite stages of the cumulative hierarchy cannot be written down explicitly after stage 5. The set &quot;V&quot;ω has the same cardinality as ω. The set &quot;V&quot;ω+1 has the same cardinality as the set of real numbers.

==Applications and interpretations==

===Applications of &quot;V&quot; as models for set theories===
If ω is the set of natural numbers, then &quot;V&quot;ω is the set of hereditarily finite sets, which is a model of set theory without the axiom of infinity.

&quot;V&quot;ω+ω is the universe of &quot;ordinary mathematics&quot;, and is a model of Zermelo set theory (but not a model of ZF). A simple argument in favour of the adequacy of &quot;V&quot;ω+ω is the observation that &quot;V&quot;ω+1 is adequate for the integers, while &quot;V&quot;ω+2 is adequate for the real numbers, and most other normal mathematics can be built as relations of various kinds from these sets without needing the axiom of replacement to go outside &quot;V&quot;ω+ω.

If κ is an inaccessible cardinal, then &quot;V&quot;κ is a model of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC) itself, and &quot;V&quot;κ+1 is a model of Morse–Kelley set theory. (Note that every ZFC model is also a ZF model, and every ZF model is also a Z model.)

===Interpretation of &quot;V&quot; as the &quot;set of all sets&quot;===
V is not &quot;the set of all (naive) sets&quot; for two reasons. First, it is not a set; although each individual stage &quot;V&quot;α is a set, their union &quot;V&quot; is a proper class. Second, the sets in &quot;V&quot; are only the well-founded sets. The axiom of foundation (or regularity) demands that every set be well founded and hence in &quot;V&quot;, and thus in ZFC every set is in &quot;V&quot;. But other axiom systems may omit the axiom of foundation or replace it by a strong negation (an example is Aczel&#x27;s anti-foundation axiom). These non-well-founded set theories are not commonly employed, but are still possible to study.

A third objection to the &quot;set of all sets&quot; interpretation is that not all sets are necessarily &quot;pure sets&quot;, which are constructed from the empty set using power sets and unions. Zermelo proposed in 1908 the inclusion of urelements, from which he constructed a transfinite recursive hierarchy in 1930. Such urelements are used extensively in model theory, particularly in Fraenkel-Mostowski models.

===Hilbert&#x27;s paradox===
The von Neumann universe satisfies the following two properties:

* formula_9 for every &quot;set&quot; formula_10.
* formula_11 for every &quot;subset&quot; formula_12.

Indeed, if formula_10, then formula_14 for some ordinal formula_15. Any stage is a transitive set, hence every formula_16 is already formula_17, and so every subset of formula_18 is a subset of formula_19. Therefore, formula_20 and formula_21. For unions of subsets, if formula_12, then for every formula_16, let formula_24 be the smallest ordinal for which formula_25. Because by assumption formula_18 is a set, we can form the limit formula_27. The stages are cumulative, and therefore again every formula_16 is formula_17. Then every formula_30 is also formula_31, and so formula_32 and formula_33.

Hilbert&#x27;s paradox implies that no set with the above properties exists . For suppose formula_34 was a set. Then formula_34 would be a subset of itself, and formula_36 would belong to formula_34, and so would formula_38. But more generally, if formula_39, then formula_40. Hence, formula_41, which is impossible in models of ZFC such as formula_34 itself.

Interestingly, formula_18 is a subset of formula_34 if, and only if, formula_18 is a member of formula_34. Therefore, we can consider what happens if the union condition is replaced with formula_47. In this case, there are no known contradictions, and any Grothendieck universe satisfies the new pair of properties. However, whether Grothendieck universes exist is a question beyond ZFC.

===&quot;V&quot; and the axiom of regularity===
The formula &quot;V&quot; = ⋃α&quot;V&quot;α is often considered to be a theorem, not a definition. Roitman states (without references) that the realization that the axiom of regularity is equivalent to the equality of the universe of ZF sets to the cumulative hierarchy is due to von Neumann.

===The existential status of &quot;V&quot;===

Since the class &quot;V&quot; may be considered to be the arena for most of mathematics, it is important to establish that it &quot;exists&quot; in some sense. Since existence is a difficult concept, one typically replaces the existence question with the consistency question, that is, whether the concept is free of contradictions. A major obstacle is posed by Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, which effectively imply the impossibility of proving the consistency of ZF set theory in ZF set theory itself, provided that it is in fact consistent.

The integrity of the von Neumann universe depends fundamentally on the integrity of the ordinal numbers, which act as the rank parameter in the construction, and the integrity of transfinite induction, by which both the ordinal numbers and the von Neumann universe are constructed. The integrity of the ordinal number construction may be said to rest upon von Neumann&#x27;s 1923 and 1928 papers. The integrity of the construction of &quot;V&quot; by transfinite induction may be said to have then been established in Zermelo&#x27;s 1930 paper.

==History==

The cumulative type hierarchy, also known as the von Neumann universe, is claimed by Gregory H. Moore (1982) to be inaccurately attributed to von Neumann. The first publication of the von Neumann universe was by Ernst Zermelo in 1930.

Existence and uniqueness of the general transfinite recursive definition of sets was demonstrated in 1928 by von Neumann for both Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory and von Neumann&#x27;s own set theory (which later developed into NBG set theory). In neither of these papers did he apply his transfinite recursive method to construct the universe of all sets. The presentations of the von Neumann universe by Bernays and Mendelson both give credit to von Neumann for the transfinite induction construction method, although not for its application to the construction of the universe of ordinary sets.

The notation &quot;V&quot; is not a tribute to the name of von Neumann. It was used for the universe of sets in 1889 by Peano, the letter &quot;V&quot; signifying &quot;Verum&quot;, which he used both as a logical symbol and to denote the class of all individuals. Peano&#x27;s notation &quot;V&quot; was adopted also by Whitehead and Russell for the class of all sets in 1910. The &quot;V&quot; notation (for the class of all sets) was not used by von Neumann in his 1920s papers about ordinal numbers and transfinite induction. Paul Cohen explicitly attributes his use of the letter &quot;V&quot; (for the class of all sets) to a 1940 paper by Gödel, although Gödel most likely obtained the notation from earlier sources such as Whitehead and Russell.

==Philosophical perspectives==

There are two approaches to understanding the relationship of the von Neumann universe V to ZFC (along with many variations of each approach, and shadings between them). Roughly, formalists will tend to view V as something that flows from the ZFC axioms (for example, ZFC proves that every set is in V). On the other hand, realists are more likely to see the von Neumann hierarchy as something directly accessible to the intuition, and the axioms of ZFC as propositions for whose truth in V we can give direct intuitive arguments in natural language. A possible middle position is that the mental picture of the von Neumann hierarchy provides the ZFC axioms with a motivation (so that they are not arbitrary), but does not necessarily describe objects with real existence.

<doc id="445981" wikidata="Q223622" url="?curid=445981" title="Battle of Prague (1757)">
<text>The Battle of Prague or Battle of Štěrboholy was fought on 6 May 1757, during the Third Silesian War and the broader Seven Years&#x27; War, between the Kingdom of Prussia and Habsburg Austria. Although Frederick the Great&#x27;s army of 64,000 Prussians forced 60,000 Austrians to retreat, he lost 14,300 men and decided he was not strong enough to attack Prague.

The battle is mentioned in the famous German ballad &quot;Lenore&quot; written in 1773 by Gottfried August Bürger.

==Prelude==
After Frederick had forced the surrender of Saxony in the 1756 campaign, he spent the winter devising new plans for a defence of his small kingdom. It was not in his nature, nor in his military strategy, simply to sit back and defend. He began drawing up plans for another bold strike against Austria.

In early spring the Prussian army marched in four columns over the mountain passes separating Saxony and Silesia from Bohemia. The four corps would unite at the Bohemian capital of Prague. Though risky, because it exposed the Prussian army to a defeat in detail, the plan succeeded. After Frederick&#x27;s corps united with a corps under Prince Moritz, and General Bevern joined up with Schwerin, both armies converged near Prague.

Meanwhile, the Austrians had not been idle. Though initially surprised by the early Prussian attack, the able Austrian field marshal Maximilian Ulysses Count Browne had been retreating skillfully and concentrating his armed forces towards Prague. Here he established a fortified position to the east of the town, and an additional army under Prince Charles of Lorraine arrived, swelling the Austrian numbers to 60,000. The prince now took command.

The Austrian army under von Browne had taken up a near invincible position on the Ziska- and the Tabor mountains. The town was on their left flank, with a steep gorge to the north, and to the west by a marshy slope with a brook at the bottom. The two Austrian commanders were in disagreement about the course of action: von Browne wanted to attack, but Charles decided to wait for Konigseck, who had been defeated at the Battle of Reichenberg but was known to be retreating towards Prague, and possibly even for the arrival of Daun.

On 6 May, around 5 am, the Prussian army assembled to the north on the Prosek heights, 115,000 men strong, and Frederick sent Keith with 30,000 to the west of the town to cut off any Austrian retreat. The Austrians drew up for battle facing north and east.

==Battle==

Frederick ordered an immediate assault, but Schwerin convinced him to make a reconnaissance around the Austrian right flank. He returned with the information that gradually sloping green meadows offered a better chance for attack at the Austrian rear. The Prussian army started marching around 7 am, and succeeded in staying largely out of sight till the Austrian generals noticed the movements around 10 am. Field Marshal von Browne shifted six infantry regiments to take up position to the south east.

Schwerin, accompanied by General Winterfeldt, was finally prepared to attack. The attack was led by the infantry of Winterfeldt. The Prussian infantry soon found themselves not in meadows, but in the remains of fish ponds. While they struggled through, Winterfeldt was hit by a musketball. The Prussian infantry wavered and Schwerin rallied them, leading them from the front. He was hit several times by Austrian canister. Frederick, when he heard the news, ordered the assault to continue. Field Marshal Schwerin&#x27;s death, however, had such an impact on King Frederick that eyewitness testimony, given by Count von Kalckreuth, indicates he suffered a nervous breakdown, appearing in a pitiful state before Prince Henry and Kalckreuth while lamenting the casualties suffered and barely being able to speak.

The Austrian infantry smelled the Prussian confusion and started to press the Prussians back down the slope, opening a gap between themselves and the remainder of the Austrian line still facing north. At this time von Browne was mortally wounded by Prussian infantry fire and carried into Prague.

While King Frederick and General von Zieten reorganised the Prussian infantry in the south for another attack, the generals Hautcharmoy and Bevern spotted the gap in the Austrian line and started to filter infantry into the gap. Austrian Croats had engaged Prussians to the north of the Austrian left flank, but with the gap in the Austrian line being exploited by a steady stream of Prussians he pulled back and formed a new line running south from the west end of the Tabor mountain.

The final phase of the battle started around 3 pm, with Prussians engaging the still-forming Austrian line and outflanking them from the south. Charles withdrew into the town, the retreat being covered by his cavalry.

King Frederick&#x27;s exact whereabouts throughout the battle are, however, a matter of debate. The few recorded sightings of the King indicate he spent virtually the entire battle on the southern part of the field. By King Frederick&#x27;s own account, he claimed to have fallen ill with stomach pains as a means of explaining his frequent absences and seemingly deferred to Schwerin both on matters of reconnaissance and when the field marshal urged the necessity of an expedient attack at Sterbohol, a crucial village in the immediate vicinity of Prague, at the very onset of the battle. As such, Schwerin&#x27;s leadership and the independent initiative of regimental commanders following the field marshal&#x27;s untimely demise should be hailed as chiefly contributing to the battle&#x27;s victorious conclusion.

==Aftermath==

The Prussian victory was at a high cost; Frederick lost over 14,000 men, and two of his best generals were out of action (Schwerin was killed by enemy fire and Winterfeldt was severely wounded). Prince Charles had also suffered heavily, losing 8,900 men killed or wounded and 4,500 prisoners. Given the high casualties he had suffered, Frederick decided to lay siege rather than launch a direct assault on the walls of Prague. He calculated that 40,000 soldiers, in addition to 75,000 inhabitants, would soon consume the city stores.

His calculation, however, did not take into account the relief army Austria managed to field against him at the Battle of Kolin, and he was soon forced to abandon the siege.

<text>Jakov Gotovac (; October 11, 1895October 16, 1982) was a Croatian composer and conductor of classical music. His comedic opera, &quot;Ero s onoga svijeta&quot; (&quot;Ero the Joker&quot;), Croatia&#x27;s best-known opera, was first performed in Zagreb in 1935.

== Biography ==

Gotovac was born in Split (then part of Austria-Hungary) and initially had little if any formal education in music. He was fortunate to be encouraged and supported by Josip Hatze, Cyril Metoděj Hrazdira and Antun Dobronić who instilled him with a nationalistic orientation in music. He started as a law student in Zagreb, but switched to writing music in 1920. In Vienna, he studied in the class of Joseph Marx.

Back home, in 1922 he worked with Masaryk&#x27;s Philharmonia Society Kolo founded in Šibenik by Vice Iljadica in 1899. In 1923 he moved to Zagreb, where he kept working both as conductor and composer until his death. Between 1923 and 1958, he was the opera conductor at the Croatian National Theatre (&quot;Hrvatsko narodno kazalište&quot;), and leader of an academic musical society Mladost, and of the choir Vladimir Nazor.

His best-known work is &quot;Ero s onoga svijeta&quot; (a libretto written by Milan Begović) which has been performed on all continents except Australia, and has been translated into nine languages. It has been performed in more than 80 theatres in Europe alone. He also wrote numerous other works for orchestra as well as vocal music, piano pieces, and others.

In his works, Gotovac represents the late national romanticism, with Croatian folklore being the main source of ideas and inspiration. Musically, he prefers homophonic textures and fairly simple harmonic structures in keeping with the folk idiom he admired.

Gotovac died at the age of 87 in Zagreb (then SFR Yugoslavia). He is buried at Mirogoj Cemetery.

<doc id="445985" wikidata="Q1277403" url="?curid=445985" title="Earl of Seafield">
<text>Earl of Seafield is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1701 for James Ogilvie, who in 1711 succeeded his father as 4th Earl of Findlater. The earldoms of Findlater and Seafield continued to be united until 1811, when the earldom of Findlater became dormant, while the earldom of Seafield remains extant.

==History==

The first Earl of Seafield&#x27;s branch of the Ogilvie family descended from Sir Walter Ogilvie, whose brother Sir John Ogilvy was the ancestor of the Earls of Airlie.

In 1616, the aforementioned Sir Walter Ogilvie&#x27;s descendant and namesake, Sir Walter Ogilvie, was created Lord Ogilvie of Deskford in the Peerage of Scotland. His son, the second Lord, was created Earl of Findlater in the Peerage of Scotland in 1638. Three years later, in 1641, Lord Findlater obtained a new patent with remainder to his daughter Elizabeth and her husband Sir Patrick Ogilvie. Upon his death in 1653, the first Earl of Findlater was succeeded by his son-in-law Sir Patrick while Elizabeth was granted the style and title of Countess of Findlater as though she held the title in her own right.

In the late 17th century, James Ogilvie, eldest son of the third Earl of Findlater, was a prominent statesman and served as Secretary of State for Scotland, as President of the Scottish Parliament, as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, as Lord Chancellor of Scotland, as Lord Chief Baron of the Court of the Exchequer in Scotland and as a Scottish representative peer. In 1698, thirteen years before he succeeded his father, he was raised to the Peerage of Scotland in his own right as Lord Ogilvie of Cullen and Viscount of Seafield, with remainder, failing heirs male of the body, to heirs of entail. In 1701, he was further honoured when he was created Lord Ogilvie of Deskford and Cullen, Viscount of Reidhaven and Earl of Seafield, also in the Peerage of Scotland and with the same remainder. In 1711, he succeeded his father as fourth Earl of Findlater.

The earldoms of Findlater and Seafield remained united for the next hundred years. However, on the death of his great-grandson, the seventh and fourth Earl respectively, the lordship of Ogilvie and Deskford and the earldom of Findlater became dormant. The earldom of Seafield and its subsidiary titles were inherited by the late Earl&#x27;s second cousin Sir Lewis Alexander Grant, 9th Baronet, of Colquhoun (see Colquhoun baronets for earlier history of the Grant family). He was a grandson of Lady Margaret Ogilvie, daughter of the fifth Earl of Findlater and second Earl of Seafield. On his succession to the earldom, he assumed the additional surname of &quot;Ogilvie&quot;, styling himself &quot;Grant-Ogilvie&quot;.

After the fifth Earl of Seafield&#x27;s death in 1840, his younger brother and successor, the sixth Earl, reversed the order of the surnames, styling himself &quot;Ogilvie-Grant&quot;. In 1858, the latter&#x27;s son, the seventh Earl, was created Baron Strathspey, of Strathspey in the Counties of Inverness and Moray, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The barony became extinct on the death of his son, the eighth Earl, in 1884, while the Scottish titles were passed on to the Earl&#x27;s uncle, the ninth Earl. The barony of Strathspey was revived for him only a few months after he succeeded his nephew.

On the death of the eleventh Earl of Seafield in 1915, the baronetcy and barony of Strathspey separated from the earldom. The baronetcy and barony, which only could be passed on to male heirs, were inherited by the late Earl&#x27;s younger brother, the fourth Baron (see the Baron Strathspey for later history of these titles). The earldom and the other subsidiary titles, which could be inherited by females, were passed on to the Earl&#x27;s daughter and only child, the twelfth Countess. , the titles are held by her only son, the thirteenth Earl, who succeeded in 1969.

The family seat is Cullen House, near Cullen, Moray. The family also owns estates at Strathspey. Many Earls of Seafield are buried at the mausoleum at &quot;Duthil Old Parish Church and Churchyard&quot;, which lies just outside the village of Duthil, Inverness-shire, and now serves as a Clan Grant Centre. The 11th Earl was killed in action in 1915 and is buried at Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery in Belgium.

The Seafield family possess an 84,500-acre estate, making them one of the principal landowners in Scotland.

<doc id="445988" wikidata="Q192915" url="?curid=445988" title="The Corrs">
<text>The Corrs are an Irish family band consisting of siblings Andrea (lead vocals, tin whistle, mandolin, ukulele), Sharon (violin, keyboards, vocals), Caroline (drums, percussion, piano, bodhrán, vocals) and Jim (guitar, piano, keyboards, vocals). Their music combines pop rock with traditional Irish themes. They are from Dundalk in County Louth, Ireland. 

The Corrs have released seven studio albums and numerous singles which have reached Platinum in many countries. They have sold 40 million albums worldwide. &quot;Talk on Corners&quot;, their most successful album to date, reached multi-Platinum status in Australia. In the UK it was the highest selling album of the year. The band is one of a small number of acts who have held the top two positions simultaneously in the UK album charts, with &quot;Talk on Corners&quot; at number one and &quot;Forgiven, Not Forgotten&quot; at number two. &quot;Talk on Corners&quot; was the year&#x27;s third highest selling album in Australia. The band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;In Blue&quot;, went to number one in seventeen countries.

The Corrs have received two Grammy Award nominations, one BRIT Award, and were awarded honorary MBEs in 2005 for their contributions to music and charity. They have been actively involved in philanthropic activities and have performed in numerous charity concerts, such as The Prince&#x27;s Trust event in 2004 and Live 8 in 2005.

The band was inactive for almost ten years because Jim and Caroline were raising families and Andrea and Sharon were pursuing solo careers while raising families of their own. According to Sharon, it was uncertain if or when the Corrs would reunite. Rumours of a reunion appeared in early 2015, and in a radio interview with Chris Evans in June 2015, Andrea confirmed that the Corrs were working on a new album and would play that year&#x27;s BBC Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park festival. Their sixth studio album, &quot;White Light&quot;, was released on 27 November 2015, and was accompanied by a European tour. After two years, their seventh studio album, &quot;Jupiter Calling&quot;, was released on 10 November 2017.

== History ==

=== 1990–1994: Early commercial success ===
The Corrs are from Dundalk, County Louth, in Ireland.
While Caroline and Andrea were still attending school, Jim and Sharon began playing as a duo, often at McManus&#x27;s, their aunt&#x27;s pub. In 1990, Jim and Sharon added their younger siblings, to form a quartet. Their career took off in 1991 when they auditioned for the film &quot;The Commitments&quot;. Jim, Sharon and Caroline each had small parts as musicians, while Andrea had a speaking part as Sharon Rabbitte. John Hughes noticed them when they auditioned for the film and agreed to become their manager.

In 1994, the USA ambassador to Ireland, Jean Kennedy Smith, invited them to perform at the 1994 FIFA World Cup in Boston after seeing them play a gig at Whelan&#x27;s Music Bar in Dublin. After an appearance at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States, The Corrs joined Celine Dion&#x27;s worldwide &quot;Falling into You Around the World Tour&quot; as a supporting act.

=== 1995–1999: International fame ===
Jason Flom, Atlantic Records&#x27;s head of A&amp;R, recommended that they meet David Foster, a Canadian musician, producer, composer and arranger. The Corrs played live for Foster and he agreed to sign them to Atlantic Records. They extended their stay in the US for over five months to record their debut album, &quot;Forgiven, Not Forgotten&quot;. It featured six instrumental selections among its Celtic-influenced tracks. The album sold well in Ireland, Australia, Canada, Japan, Norway and Spain. Major success in the US and the UK, however, was not immediately forthcoming. Eventually, the album reached Platinum status in the UK and Australia, and 4× Platinum in Ireland, making it one of the most successful debuts by an Irish group.

The Corrs&#x27; next album, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Talk on Corners&quot;, was produced by Glen Ballard, who was respected for his collaboration with Alanis Morissette. The Corrs also collaborated with Carole Bayer Sager, Oliver Leiber, Rick Nowels and Billy Steinberg. It was successful in Ireland and the UK and entered the Australian album charts at number 3.

After the band recorded a version of &quot;Dreams&quot; for a Fleetwood Mac tribute album, they re-released &quot;Talk on Corners&quot;, with new remixes of &quot;What Can I Do?&quot;, &quot;So Young&quot; and &quot;Runaway&quot;. The special edition topped the charts worldwide and again reached multi-Platinum status in the UK and Australia.

In June 1998, the Corrs participated in the Pavarotti and Friends for the Children of Liberia charity concert. The concert was held in Modena, Italy and was hosted by Luciano Pavarotti. The concert aimed to raise money to build the Pavarotti and Friends Liberian Children&#x27;s Village, to provide refuge for children in Liberia.

The following year, the Corrs received a BRIT Award for Best International Band. They performed live on MTV&#x27;s Unplugged on 5 October 1999 at Ardmore Studios, County Wicklow, Ireland. The resulting CD and DVD sold 2.7 million copies and featured live performances of previously released songs, plus a new song, &quot;Radio&quot;, later featured on their third album, &quot;In Blue&quot;.

=== 2000–2002: Mainstream success ===
In 2000, the Corrs returned to mainstream success with their third album. Unlike their previous albums, &quot;In Blue&quot; moved towards mainstream pop. &quot;In Blue&quot; hit number one in its first sales week in, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the UK and debuted at No. 2 in France and Norway. It climbed to the top spot during its second week in Sweden and Spain.

The Corrs worked with Alejandro Sanz on &quot;In Blue&quot;, recording &quot;Una Noche (One Night)&quot;, a duet between Sanz and Andrea Corr; Sanz played Andrea&#x27;s love interest in the music video. In return, the Corrs performed &quot;Me Iré (The Hardest Day)&quot; with him on his album, &quot;El Alma Al Aire&quot;. The Corrs collaborated with Robert Lange to produce a mainstream hit single, &quot;Breathless&quot;, which reached number 20 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number seven in Australia, number three in Ireland and New Zealand, and topped the charts in the UK, and earned the band a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards. The album went straight to number one in the Irish Albums Chart, the third highest single-week sales in the history of the charts, behind U2&#x27;s &quot;The Best of 1980–1990&quot; and Oasis&#x27; &quot;Be Here Now&quot;. &quot;In Blue&quot; achieved Platinum sales in the US, double platinum in the UK, and 4× Platinum in Australia.

During the production of the album, the Corrs&#x27; mother, Jean, died while waiting for a lung transplant. She was buried at St. Patrick&#x27;s cemetery in Dundalk. &quot;No More Cry&quot;, written by Andrea and Caroline Corr for the album, was written to help their father get over his grief.

In 2001, the Corrs released their first compilation album, &quot;Best of The Corrs&quot;. The album featured previously released songs and new tracks, such as the singles &quot;Would You Be Happier?&quot;, &quot;Make You Mine&quot; and &quot;Lifting Me&quot;. The album did not chart highly in Ireland but reached Platinum status in Australia. The Corrs collaborated with Josh Groban, recording &quot;Canto Alla Vita&quot;, for his eponymous debut album.

When the band returned to Ireland, they hosted another live concert at Ardmore Studios, where they previously performed for the MTV&#x27;s Unplugged series. Guest performers included Bono from U2 and Ronnie Wood from The Rolling Stones. During the concert, Bono joined Andrea Corr for a duet of Nancy Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Summer Wine&quot; and a performance of Ryan Adams&#x27; &quot;When the Stars Go Blue&quot;. Ronnie Wood joined the band onstage to play guitar on their version of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Little Wing&quot; and the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;. These performances were recorded and compiled on a live album, &quot;VH1 Presents: The Corrs, Live in Dublin&quot;, which was released in the UK.

=== 2003–2005: Later years ===

In 2003, Andrea Corr recorded &quot;Time Enough for Tears&quot;, written by Bono and Gavin Friday for the film &quot;In America&quot;. This track was featured on the Corrs&#x27; 2004 album, &quot;Borrowed Heaven&quot;. Recorded over an 18-month period in Dublin and Los Angeles, &quot;Borrowed Heaven&quot; was produced by Olle Romo, who previously worked with Melanie C and Kelly Clarkson. The album marked the Corrs&#x27; return to the folk rock genre with a slightly heavier emphasis on guitars. Nevertheless, the album was not as successful as their predecessors, but at least successful enough to enter at No.2 in both the UK and Germany and reach silver status in the UK as well as gold in Germany. Jason Duffy temporarily joined the band as drummer, filling in for Caroline while she was pregnant with her second child and unable to tour. &quot;Borrowed Heaven&quot; was dedicated to the band&#x27;s parents.

The band also dedicated their 2005 album &quot;Home&quot; to their late mother. It is regarded as a traditional Irish album as the band covered traditional Irish songs taken from their mother&#x27;s songbook to commemorate their 15 years as a band. The album was produced by Mitchell Froom and featured the BBC Radio 2 Orchestra. The songs on &quot;Home&quot; spanned the history of Irish music. It also included two songs in Irish, &quot;Bríd Óg Ní Mháille (Brigid O&#x27;Malley)&quot; and &quot;Buachaill Ón Éirne (Boy from Lough Erne)&quot;. &quot;Home&quot; had success in Ireland, France (reaching No. 5) and Germany (reaching No. 12) and was certified silver in the UK.

=== 2006–2014: Solo projects and retrospective releases ===
The Corrs went on an extended hiatus starting in 2006, raising their own families and pursuing solo careers.

Andrea released her first solo album, &quot;Ten Feet High&quot;, on 25 June 2007. It was produced by Nellee Hooper, who has worked with Björk, Gwen Stefani and Madonna; Bono was an executive producer. The first single released from the album was &quot;Shame on You (to Keep My Love from Me)&quot;. On 30 May 2011, Andrea released her second album, &quot;Lifelines&quot;, an album of cover songs, with The Blue Nile&#x27;s &quot;Tinseltown in the Rain&quot; as the first single. Sharon started pursuing a solo career in 2009, her single &quot;It&#x27;s Not a Dream&quot; was released on 29 August 2009. On 10 September 2010 her debut album &quot;Dream of You&quot; was released, with her cover of &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Got to Learn Sometime&quot; by The Korgis as the first single. Sharon finished writing her second album in March 2012. The album that emerged was called The Same Sun.

The Corrs released their second compilation album, &quot;&quot;, on 20 November 2006. The album consisted of several of the band&#x27;s hits, as well as tracks that had not previously been released on Corrs albums, such as &quot;I Know My Love&quot;, a collaboration with The Chieftains and &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot;, Andrea&#x27;s duet with Laurent Voulzy. The album also featured remixes of &quot;When the Stars Go Blue&quot; and &quot;Goodbye&quot;. The latter was released as a download-only single to promote the album. However, the album charted poorly, reaching number 24 in Ireland. On 25 September 2007, the Corrs released another compilation album, &quot;The Works&quot;. The album consists of three CDs that feature previously released songs. It performed worse than its predecessor, failing to chart at all.

=== 2015–2017: Return with &quot;White Light&quot; and &quot;Jupiter Calling&quot; ===
In June 2015, Andrea announced that the Corrs would perform at Live in Hyde Park on 13 November and were in the process of making a new record. On 17 September 2015, the band confirmed their sixth studio album, &quot;White Light&quot;, which was released on 27 November 2015 and was accompanied by a European tour, which took place in 2016. According to an interview, released by Jim to Music Radar, the band had already completed the recording for their seventh studio album, &quot;Jupiter Calling&quot;. Produced by T Bone Burnett, it was released on 10 November 2017, and was preceded by a concert on 19 October at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

=== 2020–present: Second return and touring Australia ===
In 2020, Taylor Swift included a cover of The Corrs&#x27; &quot;Breathless&quot; in a setlist of songs by female artists to commemorate women&#x27;s history month. She described the artists she had chosen as &quot;faraway mentors who taught me how music could make someone&#x27;s life easier and more magical&quot; and said they had guided her &quot;melodically, lyrically, spiritually and emotionally&quot;.

On 26 November 2022, the Corrs performed together for the first time since 2017, playing to a crowd of approximately 11,000 at Hope Estate Winery, in Australia&#x27;s Hunter Valley, their first concert in Australia in 21 years. The concert was a success, and the Corrs announced on 4 December 2022 that they would tour Australia and New Zealand in October and November 2023 and later added dates in Jakarta, Indonesia and Manila, Philippines.

== Musical style and influences ==
When asked to describe their genre, Caroline Corr said it was a &quot;blend of modern rhythms and technology with acoustic instruments, violin, tin whistle, drums and of course the voices, the marrying of these instruments is our sound&quot;. The Corrs&#x27; music is typically categorised as a mixture of pop rock and folk rock. This is evident in their first two albums, &quot;Forgiven, Not Forgotten&quot; and &quot;Talk on Corners&quot;, although Andrea described the genre of &quot;Talk on Corners&quot; by saying &quot;it [has] got more of an edgy feel, a little bit more guitar-orientated and also an Irish sound, which is in &quot;Forgiven, Not Forgotten&quot;.&quot;

&quot;In Blue&quot; moved towards mainstream pop, placing heavy emphasis on synthesizers. The move attracted criticism from many; one &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; critic called it &quot;a disheartening example of musical ethnic cleansing&quot;. A &quot;USA Today&quot; critic called it &quot;the best mainstream pop album you&#x27;re likely to come across&quot;.

&quot;Borrowed Heaven&quot; placed heavier emphasis on guitars, while retaining the original folk rock genre. &quot;Home&quot; is a traditional Irish album, where the band covered many traditional Irish songs. The album contained songs from different eras of Irish music, including a 1982 song written by Phil Lynott (&quot;Old Town&quot;) while the 1,000-year-old &quot;Return to Fingal&quot; featured as a bonus track on the Japanese, limited German and Spanish editions. &quot;White Light&quot; returned to a similar sound to &quot;In Blue&quot;, with much more electronic-based instrumentation, while &quot;Jupiter Calling&quot; is characterised as a more stripped back live performance with minimal overdubbing.

The Corrs&#x27; main influences were their parents, who were both musicians and encouraged them to learn instruments. They drew inspiration from musicians such as The Eagles, The Police, The Carpenters, Simon and Garfunkel and Fleetwood Mac, which Sharon said in an interview with CNN is the reason &quot;our songs are very, very melodic and [harmonious]&quot;.

== Philanthropy ==
The Corrs have been active in supporting charitable and philanthropic causes and disaster relief. In 1998, the Corrs participated in the &quot;Pavarotti and Friends for the Children of Liberia&quot; charity concert. The concert was held in Modena, Italy and was hosted by Luciano Pavarotti. Among the other participating artists were Jon Bon Jovi, Natalie Cole, Pino Daniele, Celine Dion, Florent Pagny, Eros Ramazzotti, Spice Girls, Vanessa L. Williams, Stevie Wonder, Trisha Yearwood and Zucchero. The concert raised money that was used to build the Pavarotti and Friends Liberian Children&#x27;s Village and to provide a refuge for orphans in Liberia during the civil war. The Corrs, along with Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, Van Morrison, Boyzone, U2 and Enya held a charity concert in 1998, to raise money for the victims of the Omagh bombing in Northern Ireland.

The Corrs&#x27; mother, Jean, died in Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, England. The Corrs showed their appreciation to the hospital by performing a one-off charity concert, held in 2001 at the Telewest Arena, raising more than £100,000. The money was used to extend the William Leech Centre of the hospital, which is dedicated to research into lung treatment. The city of Newcastle presented them a limited edition painting of Tyneside&#x27;s quayside in return.

The Corrs played at a 2004 charity concert for The Prince&#x27;s Trust, a UK-based charity that provides help, training, financial, and practical support to UK citizens aged between 14 and 30. They performed with The Buggles, Will Young, Blue, Avril Lavigne, Lenny Kravitz, Busted, Anastacia, Nelly Furtado, Sugababes and Natasha Bedingfield and raised more than £1 million.

They are ambassadors for the Nelson Mandela&#x27;s &quot;46664&quot; campaign, where they performed live to raise awareness towards HIV/AIDS in Africa. The concert was held on 29 November 2003 in Cape Town, South Africa. The concert aimed to &quot;[raise] awareness of HIV in South Africa and launched the 46664 campaign&quot; and the money raised was donated to the &quot;Nelson Mandela Foundation for Aids&quot;. During the Edinburgh Live 8 on 2 July 2005, the Corrs performed &quot;When the Stars Go Blue&quot; alongside Bono to promote the Make Poverty History campaign, which aimed to increase awareness and pressure governments into taking actions towards relieving extreme poverty.

In recognition of their charity work, the Corrs were made honorary Members of the Order of the British Empire in 2005 by Queen Elizabeth II.

<text>Titus Quinctius Flamininus (229 – 174 BC) was a Roman politician and general instrumental in the Roman conquest of Greece.

== Family background ==
Flamininus belonged to the minor patrician &quot;gens&quot; Quinctia. The family had a glorious place in the early history of Rome, especially the famous hero Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, but it had somewhat lost its political influence by the middle of the fourth century BC. Flamininus&#x27; great grandfather Caeso Quinctius Claudus was still consul in 271, the last time a Quinctius is recorded as holding a curule office before 209.

Lucius Quinctius, his grandfather, was &quot;flamen Dialis&quot; — the great priest of Jupiter — during the third quarter of the third century. The cognomen Flamininus borne by his descendants derives from this prestigious priesthood. Flamininus&#x27; great grandson later put an &quot;apex&quot;, the head covering of the Flamen, as a symbol of his family on a denarius he minted. Flamininus&#x27; father — also named Titus — is not known. He had two sons: the elder, Titus Flamininus, was born c.228, the younger Lucius followed soon after. At the end of the third century, the Quinctii regained a good status among the political class, as shown by Flamininus&#x27; uncle Caeso who built the Temple of Concord in 217, his younger brother who became augur in 213 at a very young age, and his distant cousin Titus Quinctius Crispinus, consul in 208.

The Quinctii were for a long time allied to the Fabii, one of the most prominent gentes of the Republic. They likely owed them the rare &quot;praenomen&quot; Caeso — a feature of the early Fabii — through marriages. Likewise, Flamininus was probably married to a Fabia, as Polybius says that Quintus Fabius Buteo, who later served under him in Greece, was his wife&#x27;s nephew. The Buteones were very influential at the time thanks to Marcus Fabius Buteo, the Princeps Senatus between 216 and 210; he was also succeeded by another Fabius, the famous Cunctator.

== Early career ==

=== Military Tribune (208 BC) ===
Flamininus&#x27; early career was peculiar, as he skipped several steps of the cursus honorum. The Second Punic War that was raging in Italy created several unusual careers, that of Scipio Africanus being the most famous example. Flamininus&#x27; career started in 208 as military tribune, a junior military position. He served under the five time consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who commanded the operations against Hannibal in Southern Italy. Marcellus died in a Carthaginian ambush near Crotone in 208.

=== Propraetor of Tarentum (205–202 BC) ===
Flamininus then became quaestor, probably in 206, although some historians have suggested a later date. He was sent to Tarentum to second his uncle Quinctius Claudus Flamininus, who was the propraetor in charge of the Roman garrison. Rome kept a strong military presence into this Greek city because it had previously defected to Hannibal.

His uncle likely died in Tarentum in 205, and it seems that Flamininus was given his command since he was already on-site. Becoming propraetor before 25 was an extraordinary achievement, but it can be explained by the fact that experienced commanders were used abroad at the end of the Second Punic War. Livy tells that he was prorogued in 204, but remains silent on the following years; he might have stayed there until the end of the war in 202. In any case, Flamininus had a good relationship with the Greek population of Tarentum. During his time there, he also became familiar with the Greek language and culture.

=== Commissions (201-200 BC) ===
Flamininus is mentioned again in 201 as the last member of a ten-men commission tasked with settling veterans of Scipio Africanus in Southern Italy (Samnium and Apulia), perhaps because he knew the area after his command at Tarentum. This commission continued its work in 200, but Flamininus was nevertheless appointed to another commission of three men to enrol settlers in Venusia. It is the only occurrence in Roman history of a man being member of two commissions simultaneously.

== Consulship and command in Greece (198–194 BC) ==

=== Consular elections (199 BC) ===
In 199, Flamininus ran for the consulship, while he was not even 30 years old. The &quot;cursus honorum&quot; had not yet been formally organised in these years, but his bid for election still broke the tradition. He was even younger than Scipio Africanus, elected consul in 205 at 31, who had for him impressive military records and prestigious family support. In contrast, Flamininus came from a smaller family and could not boast any notable achievement during the war against Hannibal. At least two tribunes of the plebs, Marcus Fulvius and Manius Curius, vetoed his candidacy, precisely on the ground that he was too young and had not held any curule office (praetor or curule aedile). However, the Senate compelled them to remove their veto and allow Flamininus to present himself in the elections.

This anomaly led modern historians to suppose that Flamininus was backed by several powerful politicians. Early prosopographers such as Friedrich Münzer and H. H. Scullard thought that he was a member of the political faction led by the Fabii. However this view has been contested, because the Fabii were in decline after the death of Buteo and the Cunctator.

Flamininus was elected consul, together with the plebeian Sextus Aelius Paetus Catus, as the consul &quot;posterior&quot;, which means the Centuriate Assembly elected him in second place, after Aelius. Plutarch tells that he owed his success to his land distributions in the commissions that made him popular among the settlers, who voted for him in return. The other consul likewise lacked any notable military achievement, and was elected thanks to his aedileship the previous year, during which he imported a lot of grain from Africa.

As the two consuls could not agree on the allocation of the provinces between them, they turned to sortition. At the time, the main prize was the conduct of the Second Macedonian War against Philip V of Macedon. Although several scholars have thought that the lottery was rigged in favour of Flamininus, it appears that he was just lucky; the known instances of rigged sortitions took place much later.

=== Campaign of 198 BC ===
After his election to the consulship he was chosen to replace Publius Sulpicius Galba who was consul with Gaius Aurelius in 200 BC, according to Livy, as general during the Second Macedonian War. He chased Philip V of Macedon out of most of Southern Greece, except for a few fortresses, defeating him at the Battle of the Aous, but as his term as consul was coming to an end he attempted to establish a peace with the Macedonian king. During the negotiations, Flamininus was made proconsul, giving him the authority to continue the war rather than finishing the negotiations. In 197 BC he defeated Philip at the Battle of Cynoscephalae in Thessaly, the Roman legions making the Macedonian phalanx obsolete in the process. Philip was forced to surrender, give up all the Greek cities he had conquered, and pay Rome 1,000 talents, but his kingdom was left intact to serve as a buffer state between Greece and Illyria. This displeased the Achaean League, Rome&#x27;s allies in Greece, who wanted Macedon to be dismantled completely.

In 198 BC he occupied Anticyra in Phocis and made it his naval yard and his main provisioning port. During the period from 197 to 194 BC, from his seat in Elateia, Flamininus directed the political affairs of the Greek states. In 196 BC Flamininus appeared at the Isthmian Games in Corinth and proclaimed the freedom of the Greek states. He was fluent in Greek and was a great admirer of Greek culture, and the Greeks hailed him as their liberator; they minted coins with his portrait, and in some cities he was deified. According to Livy, this was the act of an unselfish Philhellene. With his Greek allies, Flamininus plundered Sparta, before returning to Rome in triumph along with thousands of freed slaves, 1,200 of whom were freed from Achaea, having been taken captive in Italy and sold in Greece during the Second Punic War.

Meanwhile, Eumenes II of Pergamum appealed to Rome for help against the Seleucid king Antiochus III. Flamininus was sent to negotiate with him in 192 BC, and warned him not to interfere with the Greek states. Antiochus did not believe Flamininus had the authority to speak for the Greeks, and promised to leave Greece alone only if the Romans did the same. These negotiations came to nothing and Rome was soon at war with Antiochus. Flamininus was present at the Battle of Thermopylae in 191 BC, in which Antiochus was defeated.

In 189 BC he was elected censor along with Marcus Claudius Marcellus, defeating among others Cato the Elder.

In 183 BC he was sent to negotiate with Prusias I of Bithynia in an attempt to capture Hannibal, who had been exiled there from Carthage, but Hannibal committed suicide to avoid being taken prisoner. According to Plutarch, many senators reproached Flamininus for having cruelly caused the death of an enemy who had now become harmless. Although nothing is known of him after this, Flamininus seems to have died around 174.

<text>Exonumia are numismatic items (such as tokens, medals, or scrip) other than coins and paper money. This includes &quot;Good For&quot; tokens, badges, counterstamped coins, elongated coins, encased coins, souvenir medallions, tags, wooden nickels and other similar items. It is an aspect of numismatics and many coin collectors are also exonumists.

Besides the above strict definition, others extend it to include non-coins which may or may not be legal tenders such as cheques, credit cards and similar paper. These can also be considered notaphily or scripophily.

==Etymology==
The noun &quot;exonumia&quot; is derived from two classical roots: &quot;exo&quot;, meaning &quot;out-of&quot; in Greek, and &quot;nummus&quot;, meaning &quot;coin&quot; in Latin (from Greek νοῦμμος – &quot;noummos&quot;, &quot;coin&quot;); thus, &quot;out[side]-of-[the category]coins&quot;. The equivalent British term, , may also be used.

The words &quot;exonumist&quot; and &quot;exonumia&quot; were coined in July 1960 by Russell Rulau, a recognized authority and author on the subject, and accepted by Webster&#x27;s dictionary in 1965.

==Token coins==

Many tokens were produced and used as currency in the United States and elsewhere when there was a shortage of government-issued money. Tokens have been used for both to advertise and to facilitate commerce and may or may not have a value.

Token authority Russell Rulau offers a broad definition for exonumia in his 1040 page tome, &quot;UNITED STATES TOKENS: 1700–1900&quot; but lines between categories can be fuzzy. For example, an advertising token may also be considered a medal. Good For tokens may also advertise. Counter-stamped coins have been called &quot;little billboards.&quot; 

One way of parsing tokens is into these three general categories:
* Has a &quot;value,&quot; facilitating commerce, such as &quot;Good for (something)&quot;.
* Commemoration, remembrance, dedication, or the like, for some person, place, idea or event.
* Of a &quot;personal nature&quot;.

Typically, catalogs of tokens are organized by location, time period, and/or type of item. Historically, the need for tokens grew out of the need for currency. In America, some tokens legally circulated alongside or instead of currency. Hard Times Tokens and Civil War tokens each were the size of the contemporary cent. Afterwards, value based items, such as &quot;Good for (amount of money)&quot;, &quot;Good for One Quart of Milk&quot;, &quot;Good for One Beer&quot;, &quot;Good for One Ride…&quot; and others were specifically linked to commerce of the store or place of issue.

==Medals==
Medals are coin-like artistic objects, typically with a commemorative purpose. They may be awarded for recognition of achievement or created for sale to commemorate individuals or events. They may be souvenirs, devotional, or purely artistic. Medals are generally not used as currency or for exchange. 

==Exonumia collecting==

Exonumia collectors, like coin collectors, are attentive to condition and rarity, as well as to history, form and type. Exonumists may collect items by region, topic, type, shape or material and this affects the ways tokens are documented.

The following categories are typical. This is not all-inclusive but is a sampling of the wide variety of exonumia.

==== Germany ====
Notgeld, primarily in the form of paper banknotes, was issued in Germany and Austria during World War I and the interwar period by towns, banks and other institutions due to a shortage of money. 

==== Latin America====
Latin American coffee or plantation tokens were an important part of commerce. Many plantation owners had their own commissaries and workers used plantation tokens to pay for provisions. Many tokens were made in the United States or Europe. Plantation tokens had an array of denominations and names. The name can be the owner, their relatives or the name of the farm (or finca). Tokens had allegorical symbols to identify the owner. Tokens were used as currency when there was not enough official currency available. Workers could convert the tokens to official currency on Saturdays.

Tokens were made in all types of base metals and alloys plus plastic, celluloid and bakelite. Unique to Costa Rica were tokens made of paper (paper chits). The word &quot;boleto&quot; is used in Costa Rica for the word token whereas &quot;ficha&quot; is used in the rest of Latin America.

====United Kingdom====
Conder tokens were privately minted tokens 
from the later part of the 18th century and the early part of the 19th century in England, Anglesey and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland.

====United States====

Rulau breaks down American tokens into these general time periods:
* Early American
* Hard times tokens were made during the &quot;hard times&quot; after President Andrew Jackson shut down the Second Bank of the United States. These tokens were issued privately to circulate in the local economy as a one cent coin. They had a wide variety of subject matter, including advertising and political/satirical themes (anti-slavery, anti-Jackson).
* Civil War tokens were made between 1861 and 1864 due to the scarcity of government-issued cents during the American Civil War. Encased postage stamps were also used for this purpose.
* Merchant (including modern gas tokens, ex: Shell tokens)

* Trade tokens
* Gay 90s

<text>An open sandwich, also known as an open-face/open-faced sandwich, bread baser, bread platter or tartine, consists of a slice of bread or toast with one or more food items on top. It has half the number of slices of bread compared to a typical closed sandwich.

==History==
During the start of the Middle Ages, thin slabs of coarse bread called &quot;trenches&quot; (late 15th century English) or, in its French derivative, &quot;trenchers&quot;, were used as plates. At the end of the meal, the food-soaked trencher was eaten by the diner (from which the expression &quot;trencherman&quot; may come), or perhaps fed to a dog or saved for beggars. Trenchers were as much the harbingers of open-face sandwiches as they were of disposable crockery.

A direct precursor to the English sandwich may be found in the Netherlands of the 17th century, where the naturalist John Ray observed that in the taverns, beef hung from the rafters &quot;which they cut into thin slices and eat with bread and butter laying the slices upon the butter&quot;. These explanatory specifications reveal the Dutch &quot;belegde boterham&quot;, open-faced sandwich, was as yet unfamiliar in England.

==Terminology==

In countries like Denmark, where smørrebrød is common, smørrebrød is not considered a form of sandwich; rather, a sandwich is considered a form of smørrebrød with an extra piece of bread on top. In a US context, open sandwiches are sandwiches that are made with only a single slice of bread. It has given rise to some controversy in the philosophy of language study of meaning underdetermination after a judge had to consider whether a burrito was a sandwich for the purposes of enforcing an exclusive use clause in an American legal case. The judge followed the definition of &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;: &quot;two thin pieces of bread, usually buttered, with a thin layer (as of meat, cheese or savory mixture) spread between them.&quot; Because the burrito was &quot;typically made with a single tortilla,&quot; the judge said it was not a sandwich.

This decision led Amanda Hess to question whether an open-faced sandwich was a sandwich at all. She questioned, by extension, whether pizza, bruschetta, buttered toast or hot dogs could be considered sandwiches. She found that the United States Department of Agriculture defined a sandwich as &quot;at least 35% cooked meat and no more than 50% bread.&quot; Further, the regulatory framework suggests two disparate categories for open vs. closed sandwiches – USDA regulations apply only to open-faced sandwiches; sandwiches made with two slices of bread are covered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Responding to the controversy, Dan Pashman declared that &quot;a burrito is not a sandwich&quot;; he stated that a sandwich must be composed of a filling between two discrete items of food, and that one must be able to eat it without utensils.

==Presentation==

Open sandwiches allow for an arrangement of different types of sandwiches to be served with afternoon teas or as an accompaniment to salads. They can be cut into fancy shapes of triangles, stars, rounds and crescents, and arranged in an attractive platter for presentation. Common ingredients for open sandwiches are jam, stuffed olives, chopped herbs, cream cheese, hard-boiled eggs and pimiento. Any ingredients can be used to add flavor and color to enhance the presentation of the sandwich platter.

==In various countries==
An open sandwich is a slice of fresh bread or, e.g. in Germany, a bread roll half, with different spreads, butter, liver pâté, cheese spreads, cold cuts such as roast beef, turkey, ham, bacon, salami, beef tongue, mortadella, head cheese or sausages like beerwurst or kabanos, fish such as smoked salmon, gravadlax, herring, eel and prawns, and vegetables like bell pepper, tomato, radish, scallion and cucumber.
Open sandwiches like this are consumed in France, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Austria, Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland and Bulgaria as well as other parts of Europe, and North America as a regular breakfast and supper food item. The American tongue toast was offered as an entrée for breakfast, lunch, and supper and as an hors d&#x27;œuvre for formal parties.

In former Czechoslovakia, a popular type of open sandwich is called &quot;obložené chlebíčky&quot; (pl., sg. &quot;obložený chlebíček&quot;) - slantways cut slice of &quot;veka&quot; (long narrow white bread) spread with butter or with various combinations of mayonnaise salads and hard boiled egg, cheese, ham, salami, smoked fish (salmon or sprats or pickled herring), tomato, pickled cucumber, lettuce, raw onion or other vegetable, etc.

The open sandwich is the common, traditional sandwich type in the Nordic countries, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Belarus, Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Kazakhstan where it is typically eaten at breakfast, lunch, supper, or as a snack. In Finland the sandwich is called &quot;voileipä&quot;, and in Estonia similarly &quot;võileib&quot;, which also means &quot;butter bread&quot;.
The Scandinavian open sandwich (, , or &quot;macka&quot;) consists of one piece of buttered bread, often whole-grain rye bread (, , ), topped with, for instance, cheese, cold steak, ham, turkey, shrimps, smoked salmon, caviar, hard boiled eggs, bacon, herring, fish fillets, liver pâté (, , ), or small meatballs. This is typically complemented by some herbs and vegetables such as parsley, cold salad, thinly sliced cucumber, tomato wedges or pickled beets, etc. on the same slice of bread.

A condiment, such as mayonnaise, or mayonnaise-based dressing is also often included in some form.
An old traditional replacement for butter on a piece of bread with herring is pig fat. There are many variations associated with the smørrebrød/smørbrød/smörgås and there are even special stores, cafés and restaurants (especially in Denmark) that specialize in them.

The Dutch and Flemish &quot;Uitsmijter&quot; consists of one or more slices of bread topped with fried eggs (one per slice of bread), and can be accompanied by slices of cheese or meat (roast beef or ham). The dish is often served as a hearty breakfast. Sweet toppings are commonly used for breakfast in the Netherlands and Belgium: e.g. sprinkles, vlokken, or muisjes, next to the more widespread peanut butter, honey, jam, and chocolate spread.

In Great Britain, open sandwiches are rare outside of Scandinavian delicatessens. The open sandwiches found in Great Britain are the Welsh rarebit and other &quot;on toast&quot; dishes (e.g., cheese on toast), and the Scotch woodcock, an open sandwich served historically at the colleges of the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford and in the refreshment rooms of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom as late as 1949.

In North America, an &quot;open faced sandwich&quot; may also refer to a slice of bread topped with warm slices of roasted meat and gravy. Examples include a beef Manhattan, a hot chicken sandwich in Canada, or Welsh rarebit. This is also done in Scandinavian countries, where they also eat open faced sandwiches with fried meat and fried fish.

<text>The administrative units of Pakistan comprise four provinces, one federal territory, and two disputed territories: the provinces of Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan; the Islamabad Capital Territory; and the administrative territories of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit–Baltistan. As part of the Kashmir conflict with neighbouring India, Pakistan has also claimed sovereignty over the Indian-controlled territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh since the First Kashmir War of 1947–1948. It also has a territorial dispute with India over Junagadh, but has never exercised administrative authority over either regions. All of Pakistan&#x27;s provinces and territories are subdivided into divisions, which are further subdivided into districts, and then tehsils, which are again further subdivided into union councils.

==History==
===Post-independence===
Pakistan inherited the territory comprising its current provinces from India following the Partition of India on 14 August 1947. Two days after independence, the Muslim-majority Murshidabad district in Bengal was moved out of the Dominion of Pakistan and put within the Dominion of India due to a boundary adjustment by the Radcliffe Commission which was aimed at keeping the Hooghly River entirely within India. At its inception, Pakistan consisted of two wings, which were separated from each other by around of Indian territory. The western wing consisted of a merger of the North-West Frontier Province, West Punjab, Sind Province, and Baluchistan CCP. The eastern wing consisted of East Bengal. What later became the Princely states of Pakistan chose at first to remain independent.

In 1948, Karachi was separated from Sind Province to form the Federal Capital Territory. In 1950, the North-West Frontier Province absorbed the princely states of Amb and Phulra while West Punjab (designated &#x27;West&#x27; to distinguish it from India&#x27;s Punjab in the east) was renamed to simply Punjab. In 1952, the four princely states in the southwest formed the Baluchistan States Union.

In 1955, the &quot;One Unit&quot; policy was launched by then-Prime Minister Muhammad Ali Bogra, whereby all the provinces and princely states of the western wing were merged to form the provincial wing of West Pakistan, with Lahore serving as its provincial capital. Simultaneously, East Bengal was redesignated as East Pakistan, with Dacca serving as its provincial capital. The One Unit policy aimed to reduce expenditure and to eliminate provincial prejudices, but the military coup of 1958 brought difficulties when the first military President, Ayub Khan, abolished the office of the Chief Minister of West Pakistan in favour of Governor rule.

On 7 September 1958, after four years of negotiations (including six months of intense negotiations), Pakistan purchased the enclave of Gwadar from Oman for . Gwadar formally became a part of Pakistan on 8 December 1958, ending 174 years of Omani rule. In 1960, the federal capital was moved from Karachi to Rawalpindi and in 1961, the Federal Capital Territory was also merged into West Pakistan. In 1966, the capital was again moved to the newly constructed city of Islamabad. In 1962, Dacca was made the legislative capital of the country due to East Pakistan&#x27;s high population. Following the 1963 Sino–Pakistan Agreement, a part of the Gilgit Agency (controlled by Pakistan since the First Kashmir War) was formally relinquished by Pakistan to the People&#x27;s Republic of China (the Trans-Karakoram Tract/Shaksgam Valley in northeastern Kashmir) with the provision that the settlement was subject to the final solution of the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan.

===Since 1970===
In 1970, the second military President, Yahya Khan, abolished the political structure of West Pakistan and established four new provinces: Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan and the North-West Frontier Province. In 1971, the Bengali-majority wing of East Pakistan seceded from the Pakistani union following the Bangladesh Liberation War, consequently forming the independent People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh. In 1974, the remaining princely states of Hunza and Nagar were abolished and their territories merged into the Gilgit Agency, following which the Northern Areas were formed. In 1975, portions of the districts of Peshawar and Dera Ismail Khan were separated to form the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. In 1981, the region surrounding Islamabad was separated from Punjab province, and renamed to the Islamabad Capital Territory.

In August 2000, divisions were abolished as part of a plan to restructure local governments, followed by elections in 2001. Many of the functions previously handled at a provincial level had been transferred to individual districts and tehsils. In 2008, the government restored the former divisions and appointed commissioners.

In 2009, the Northern Areas were renamed to Gilgit-Baltistan, and retained its formal status as an autonomous territory. In 2010, the North-West Frontier Province was formally renamed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In 2018, the National Assembly of Pakistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Assembly passed the historic &quot;FATA Merger Bill&quot; with the Twenty-Fifth Constitutional Amendment. On 31 May 2018, the final step in the merger of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was completed, as then-President Mamnoon Hussain signed the 25th Constitutional Amendment Bill into law. The amendment&#x27;s signing abolished the Federally Administered Tribal Areas as a separate political entity and merged them into the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

==Tiers of governance==
The diagram below outlines the six tiers of government:





=== Division ===

The Provinces and administrative territories of Pakistan are subdivided into administrative &quot;divisions&quot;, Divisional Commissioner is the administrative head of a division. Divisional Commissioner is appointed by the government of Pakistan from Pakistan Administrative Service

=== District ===

The District Coordination Officer is the administrative head of the District Administration. They have wide-ranging responsibility for overseeing, improving and directing the approved plans of the District Government.

The Zila Nazim used to be the executive head of the District Administration until 2010 when the government gave their powers to the District Coordination Officers also. Their role is similar to district governor or prefect, with responsibility for implementing government strategy and developing initiatives arising out of it.

In order to decentralize administrative and financial authority to be accountable to Local Governments, for good governance, effective delivery of services, and transparent decision making through institutionalized participation of the people at grassroots level, elections to the local government institutions are held after every four years on none party basis by the Chief Election Commissioner of Pakistan.

=== Tehsil ===

Among the three tiers of local government, tehsil government is the second tier. It is where the functions, responsibilities, and authorities of districts government are divided into smaller units, these units are known as &quot;tehsils&quot;. The tehsils are used all over Pakistan except Sindh province where the word &quot;taluka&quot; is used instead, although the functions and authorities are the same. The head of the Tehsil government is &quot;Tehsil Nazim&quot; who is assisted by the tehsil Naib-Nazim. Every tehsil has a Tehsil Municipal Administration, consisting of a tehsil council, Tehsil Nazim, tehsil/taluka municipal officer (TMO), chief officer and other officials of the local council.

=== Union council ===

Members of the union council including Union Administrator and Vice Union Administrator are elected through direct elections based on adult franchise and on the basis of joint electorate. However, for the election to the reserved seats for women in Zila Council proportionately divided among tehsils or towns shall be all members of the union councils in a tehsil or town. It is the responsibility of the Chief Election Commissioner to organize and conduct these elections.

<text>Czesław Niemen (; born Czesław Juliusz Wydrzycki; February 16, 1939 – January 17, 2004), occasionally credited mononymously as Niemen, was one of the most important and innovative Polish singer-songwriters and rock balladeers of the 20th century, singing primarily in Polish. He possessed an unusually wide voice range and equally rich intonation. He was also an ardent composer and keyboardist.

== Biography==
===Early life===
Niemen was born in Stare Wasiliszki in the Nowogródek Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic (now in the Grodno Region of Belarus), to parents Antoni Wydrzycki (1896–1960) and Anna (&quot;née&quot; Markiewicz; 1897–1986). Niemen belonged to a community of Poles, living outside the eastern borders of contemporary Poland, on the eastern lands of the historical Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (called &#x27;Kresy&#x27; – &#x27;borderlands&#x27; – in Polish). From the age of 10, he was involved in both school and church choirs, sometimes playing organ accompaniment. Niemen briefly studied in Grodno at the State College for one year, after which he was expelled for truancy.

In 1959, at the age of 19, the family were forcibly migrated to Northwest Poland along the Baltic Sea during the second repatriation of Poles, frequently moving between various cities, including Kołobrzeg, Świebodzin and Białogard.

===1960s===

In the early 1960s, Niemen began performing in student cabarets in Gdańsk, first singing in foreign languages and later in his native Polish. Niemen found himself in the first group of Polish musicians who were identified with the burgeoning big-beat style of Eastern Europe, thanks to being among 15 winners of a festival for young performers in Szczecin in 1962. This victory allowed him to join the band Niebiesko-Czarni (The Blue-Blacks), one of the first professional pop-rock bands in Poland, with a number of leading vocalists performing one after another during concerts. He made his commercial debut in the following years, singing Polish rock and soul music.

In 1964 at Congress Hall, Warsaw, Niemen, together with his group, played as a support act to Marlene Dietrich during her concert. She heard his song &quot;Czy mnie jeszcze pamiętasz&quot; (&quot;Do you still remember me?&quot;) there. She enjoyed it so much that she soon wrote her own lyrics for the song and recorded &quot;Mutter, Hast du Mir Vergeben&quot; (&quot;Mother, have you forgiven me?&quot;).

Soon after his first successful concerts in France, he started to use the pseudonym &quot;Niemen&quot; instead of his real name, gaining wider notoriety in Poland and making it easier to pronounce by foreigners (Niemen is a Polish pronunciation of the Neman River, which flows in close proximity to his place of birth). His 1967 song &quot;Dziwny jest ten świat&quot; (&quot;Strange Is This World&quot;) is commonly acknowledged to be the most important Polish protest song of that era; an English version was also recorded in 1972. The song was influenced by the American blues tradition. He was one of the first Polish performers to wear long hair and colourful clothes and introduced the style of psychedelia to communist Poland, which displeased officials.

The first three LP album&#x27;s Niemen recorded with his band &quot;Akwarele&quot; (&quot;Watercolours&quot;). Subsequently, he recorded with his other new bands: &quot;Enigmatic&quot;, &quot;Grupa Niemen&quot; and &quot;Aerolit&quot;. In 1969 he changed his musical style to progressive rock while recording the monumental album &quot;Enigmatic&quot;. That album&#x27;s most notable song was &quot;Bema pamięci żałobny rapsod&quot; (&quot;A Mournful Rhapsody in Memory of Józef Bem&quot;), based on the 19th-century poem by Cyprian Kamil Norwid. The rest of &quot;Enigmatic&quot;&#x27;s songs were also in sung poetry form. Niemen played the Hammond organ on his records, later moving to the mellotron and the Moog synthesizer.

===1970s===
In the early 1970s, Niemen recorded three English language albums under the CBS label, two of them (and three more in Poland) with the Silesian band SBB. With SBB Niemen performed at the Rock &amp; Jazz Now! opening show for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich sharing the stage with Mahavishnu Orchestra, John McLaughlin and Charles Mingus and subsequently toured with Jack Bruce&#x27;s band. In 1972 he also performed a song he wrote in Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s film &quot;Wesele (The Wedding)&quot;. In 1974 he recorded &quot;Mourner&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot; with Jan Hammer and Rick Laird from Mahavishnu Orchestra. In the seventies, Niemen turned to jazz-rock fusion and electronic music, recording the album &quot;Katharsis&quot;. In an interview from this era, he said, &quot;One thing I know is that I&#x27;m a composer. I want to concentrate on writing music for film, for theater. I don&#x27;t know for how long I will continue singing. I am just bored by singing. This form of artistic expression seems quite exhausted for me. At least it does not excite me like it used to.&quot;

===Later years and death===

Niemen went on to compose film soundtracks and theater music, and in the 1990s he showed interest in art, painting and computer graphics.

He died after a long battle with cancerous lymphomas on January 17, 2004, in Warsaw. His remains were cremated and placed in a columbarium niche on Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw on January 30, 2004. The funeral was attended by over 3,000 people.

==Awards and recognitions==
Niemen won the Sopot International Song Festival in 1979.

===Remembrance===

A number of documentaries on the life of Niemen were filmed, including Marek Piwowski&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;Sukces&quot;, Krzysztof Rogulski&#x27;s 1976 film &quot;Niemen&quot;, Eugeniusz Szpakowski&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;Czesław Niemen&quot;, and Krzysztof Magowski&#x27;s 2014 film &quot;Sen o Warszawie&quot; (A Dream About Warsaw).

Since March 12, 2004, Czesław Niemen&#x27;s song &quot;Sen o Warszawie&quot; has been performed before each match of Legia Warsaw at the Stadion Wojska Polskiego and is considered the club fans&#x27; anthem.

In 2009, National Bank of Poland presented three coins dedicated to Niemen: issued on June 19 two silver 10-zloty coins, one of which of square shape, and issued on June 17, 2-zloty coin of Nordic Gold alloy.
On February 20, 2011, a museum devoted to Niemen and his musical legacy was opened in the artist&#x27;s birthplace in Stare Wasiliszki, present-day Belarus.

==Niemen&#x27;s support bands==
Niemen cooperated with the following bands; some of them were support musicians, while others were independent bands: &quot;Akwarele&quot; (&quot;Watercolours&quot;) (1967–1969), &quot;I Niemen&quot; (&quot;And Niemen&quot;) (1969–1970), also under the name &quot;Niemen Enigmatic&quot;), &quot;Grupa Niemen&quot; (made of the members of Silesian Blues Band), Niebiesko-Czarni, &quot;Aerolit&quot;, and female vocal band Alibabki. &quot;Aerolit&quot; accompanied Czesław Niemen in 1974–1978. Initially it was formed from young musicians of the rock band Krzak: Jacek Gazda, Jan Błędowski, Maciej Radziejewski, Piotr Dziemski. The word means &quot;aerolite&quot; in Polish.

<text>An elongated coin (also known as a pressed penny or smashed penny) is a coin that has been flattened or stretched, and embossed with a new design. Such coins are often used as commemorative or souvenir tokens, and it is common to find coin elongation machines in tourism hubs, such as museums, amusement parks, and natural or man-made landmarks.

The collecting of elongated coins is a branch of numismatics. Elongated coins are also categorized as exonumia.

== History ==

The first elongated coins in the United States were created at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, held in 1893 in Chicago, Illinois. Several designs were issued to commemorate the fair, and are available in the elongated coin collecting community today.

The earliest elongated coin designer on record is Charles Damm, who created the design for the elongated coins available at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York.

The production of elongated coins can be divided into three general classes, each of which covers a distinct period from 1893 to the present. The first of the three classes are referred to colloquially as &quot;oldies&quot;, and were produced mainly for issuance at nationwide fairs like the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exhibition and the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. This period started with the issuance of the first elongateds in 1893, and ended with an influx of private rollers around 1965. The second class of elongated coins, the &quot;Modern Elongateds&quot;, cover the years c. 1965 to c. 1985.

Around 1965, the major source of elongated coins became private rollers, individuals who designed and rolled elongated coins for sale. The major rollers of this period include Dottie Dow, the &quot;House of Elongateds&quot; (Lee Martin/Warren Bunge), Ralph Jones, Ralph W. Jobe, Elmer Anderson, Don Adams, Cee Ceven, and Angelo A. Rosato. While many private rollers still operate (notables include Raymond W. Dillard, Tyler D. Tyson, Brad Ream, and Don Adams), the vast introduction of commercial stand alone elongated machines came into the marketplace in 1988, following the introduction of the coin-operated penny press machine 1971, decreased the demand for private issues.

This event marks the beginning of the third class of elongated coins, the &quot;Contemporary Elongateds&quot; (c. 1988 – present). This class of elongated coin machines were designed and built by Randy and Earl Vaughn from Dayton, Ohio, in 1988. These mechanical coin-operated machines are still prominent in amusement parks such as Disney resorts and attractions throughout the United States, and the world.

The first known coin-operated stand-alone automated coin rolling vendor was designed by Vance Fowler and his Cimeter Group offering a &quot;I Love Oregon&quot; pressed penny which was placed in the Meier &amp; Frank Company department store, a branch of The May Company Stores, in 1979. Vance Fowler&#x27;s Cimeter Group also proposed the DN0001 prototype pressed coin as the first Disneyland Resort pressed coin in 1986. However, ultimately Centex Inc. was the first company to place a coin press machine at the Disneyland Resort, offering the DL0001 Mickey Mouse Rays pressed coin in 1987.

===Collecting===
The hobby of collecting elongated coins has expanded throughout the United States and the world. Most modern coin elongating machines can be found in museums or landmark gift shops, souvenir stores, zoos, amusement parks and other locations of this kind. Private engravers make special-issue elongated coins to commemorate historical events, personal landmarks (such as marriage or birth of a child), or other events warranting celebration. They also design elongated coins for private clubs and organizations.

Several websites and online groups exist to support collectors offering locations and articles covering topics such as rolling, preserving, cleaning, and other related topics. The Elongated Collectors is a non-profit organization that was founded in 1966. The group&#x27;s official mission is to &quot;educate, encourage and promote the study, acquisition and exhibition of elongated coins.&quot; The organization publishes a quarterly newsletter, &quot;TEC News&quot;, and periodic email updates, &quot;TEC eNews&quot;, creates elongated coins, and hosts an annual meeting in conjunction with the American Numismatic Association World&#x27;s Fair of Money.

==Locales==
It is common to find &quot;pressed penny&quot; machines in tourism hubs, such as museums, amusement parks, and natural or man-made landmarks.

==Process==
An early and common method of coin elongation was smashing pennies by leaving them on a railroad track. When a train rolls over a penny, the force is sufficient to cause plastic deformation that flattens and stretches it into an oval, showing only the faintest trace of the original design. Some early railroad flattened cents were then hand engraved with the date and location.

Modern elongated coins are created by inserting a standard, small denomination coin into a small rolling mill consisting of two steel rollers pressed against each other with sufficient force to deform the coin. One of the rollers (called the &quot;die&quot;) is engraved with a design that imprints a new image into the metal as the coin passes through it. The resulting coin is oval-shaped and shows a design corresponding to the design on the die in the mill. Some machines are hand operated, whereas others are fully automatic.

Throughout the history of the production of elongated coins, various methods have been used to engrave the design into the roller. Early elongateds were hand engraved with burin gravers, and some are still engraved using this method. More popular modern and contemporary methods include etching, pantograph engraving, and engraving using electric or air-powered rotary tools.

In the US, one-cent coins are most commonly used in these vending machines, as they are thin, easy to emboss, and are the smallest denomination of US money (most machines charge US$1.00 in addition to the cent rolled). All US cents produced after 1982 have a zinc core, and using them produces elongated coins with zinc streaks. This zinc streaking can be avoided by using coins produced before 1982. (The United States Mint produced both compositions during 1982.) Less common are machines that press designs into quarters, dimes, and nickels.

==Legality==

The process of creating elongated coins is legal in the United States, South Africa and parts of Europe. In the United States, U.S. Code Title 18, Chapter 17, Section 331 prohibits &quot;the mutilation, diminution and falsification of United States coinage.&quot; The foregoing statute, however, does not prohibit the mutilation of coins, if the mutilated coins are not used fraudulently, i.e., with the intention of creating counterfeit coinage or profiting from the base metal (the pre-1982 copper U.S. cent which, as of 2010, is worth more than one cent in the United States). Because elongated coins are made mainly as souvenirs, mutilation for this purpose is legal.

In the UK, the Coinage Act of 1971, Section 10 states: &quot;No person shall, except under the authority of a licence granted by the Treasury, melt down or break up any metal coin which is for the time being current in the United Kingdom or which, having been current there, has at any time after 16th May 1969 ceased to be so.&quot; As the process of creating elongated coins does not require them to be melted nor broken up, Section 10 does not apply and coin elongation is legal within the UK with penny press machines a common sight at tourist attractions across the nation.

In countries where such mutilation is illegal, such as Canada, planchets, slugs, or U.S. cents are occasionally used, though this law is often ignored both by the users of the machine and law enforcement.

<doc id="446029" wikidata="Q213749" url="?curid=446029" title="Huáscar">
<text>Huáscar Inca (; Quechua: &quot;Waskar Inka&quot;) also Guazcar (before 15271532) was Sapa Inca of the Inca Empire from 1527 to 1532. He succeeded his father, Huayna Capac and his brother Ninan Cuyochi, both of whom died of smallpox during the same year while campaigning near Quito.

==Biography==
The origin of his name is uncertain. One story is that Huáscar was named after a huge gold chain that was made to mark the occasion of his birth. &quot;Huasca&quot; is Quechua for &quot;chain.&quot; Because his father did not think &quot;chain&quot; was an appropriate name for a prince, he added an &quot;r&quot; to the end of the name to make &quot;Huáscar&quot;. Another story is that his name is from his birthplace, Huascarpata.

The actual events that brought about Huáscar&#x27;s succession are unclear. Conflicting factions and the fact that the Spanish chroniclers&#x27; accounts stemmed from the winners of the ensuing civil war led to conflicting versions of what actually happened. Thus, although Huayna Capac named the infant Ninan Cuyochi as his first heir, sources differ as to whether the boy died first, was unacceptable because of an unfavorable divination or even if Huayna simply forgot that he had named him when asked to confirm the nomination. In any event, a second choice was requested and again sources vary. He may have named Huáscar&#x27;s half-brother Atahualpa who then refused or named Huáscar himself or perhaps even the nobles put forward Huáscar. Whatever the truth, the result of Huáscar&#x27;s accession and the dispute over it before and after led to civil war between Huáscar (made emperor by a faction based in Cuzco) and Atahualpa (backed by leaders who were based in the north with Huayna).

The Spanish chronicler Juan de Betanzos who provided information pertaining to the Huáscar-Atahualpa civil war, outlines Huáscar&#x27;s tyranny. It is, however, a very biased account, as Betanzos&#x27; wife, on whose testimony much of his chronicle is based, was previously married to Atahualpa. Betanzos outlines how Huáscar would seize his lords&#x27; wives if they took his fancy. More importantly, he seized both the Lands of the Previous Incas and the Lands of the Sun. In Inca society, the lands of previous dead Incas remained part of their household to support their divine-like cult. Similarly lands were reserved for the worship of the Sun. Thus, Huáscar&#x27;s seizure represented his disrespect and insensitivity for Inca religion.

Huáscar then declared war on Atahualpa. The battles reported by Betanzos talk of Quizquiz (Atahualpa&#x27;s commander) leading armies of 60,000 men against armies of 60,000 men supporting Huáscar. Betanzos&#x27; account also enlightens on the bloody nature of Inca wars. Atahualpa&#x27;s punishment of the Cañaris saw him rip the hearts of their tribal chiefs and force their followers to eat them.

Huáscar was defeated in the Battle of Chimborazo and the Battle of Quipaipán. Huáscar was made prisoner and Atahualpa&#x27;s generals Quizquiz and Chalcuchímac occupied Cuzco.

The war had Atahualpa in the clear ascendancy on Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro&#x27;s arrival. However it was partly because of the ongoing civil war that Pizarro was able to triumph. Firstly, the civil war had depleted the Inca armies. Secondly, disunity can be demonstrated by Huáscar&#x27;s celebrations and in the celebrations of the province of Cuzco (loyal to Huáscar) at Atahualpa&#x27;s capture.

Furthermore, Atahualpa had Huáscar killed so that he was not in a position to offer Pizarro a larger ransom of gold than Atahualpa was offering for his own release. Atahualpa stated: &quot;How shall my brother get so much gold and silver for himself; I would give twice as much as he can, if they would kill him and leave me as lord.&quot;

<text>A musicologist is someone who studies music (see musicology). A historical musicologist studies music from a historical perspective. An ethnomusicologist studies music in its cultural and social contexts (see ethnomusicology). A systematic musicologist asks general questions about music from the perspective of relevant disciplines (psychology, sociology, acoustics, philosophy, physiology, computer science) (see systematic musicology). Systematic musicologists often identify more strongly with their non-musical discipline than with musicology.

<text>Smithson Tennant FRS (30 November 1761 – 22 February 1815) was an English chemist. He is best known for his discovery of the elements iridium and osmium, which he found in the residues from the solution of platinum ores in 1803. He also contributed to the proof of the identity of diamond and charcoal. The mineral tennantite is named after him.

==Life==
Tennant was born in Selby in Yorkshire. His father was Calvert Tennant (named after his grandmother Phyllis Calvert, a granddaughter of Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore).
His own name derives from his grandmother Rebecca Smithson, widow of Joshua Hitchling. He attended Beverley Grammar School and there is a plaque over one of the entrances to the present school commemorating his discovery of the two elements, osmium and iridium. 
He began to study medicine at Edinburgh in 1781, but after a few months moved to Cambridge, where he devoted himself to botany and chemistry. 
He graduated M.D. at Cambridge in 1796, and about the same time purchased an estate near Cheddar, where he carried out agricultural experiments. 
He was appointed professor of chemistry at Cambridge in 1813, but lived to deliver only one course of lectures, being killed near Boulogne-sur-Mer by the fall of a bridge over which he was riding.

==Legacy==
In 2006, American Elements discovered new technology allowing for the casting of seamless iridium rings for use in spacecraft and satellites. In 2016, the company utilized the same technology to introduce a line of iridium wedding bands marketed under the trademark Smithson Tennant.

<doc id="446049" wikidata="Q1258074" url="?curid=446049" title="Sindhis">
<text>Sindhis (; ; &quot;sindhī&quot;; ) are an Indo-Aryan ethnolinguistic group, originating from and native to the Sindh region of Pakistan, who share a common Sindhi culture, history and language. The historical homeland of Sindhis is bordered by southeastern Balochistan; the Bahawalpur region of Punjab; the Marwar and Jaisalmer regions of Rajasthan; and the Kutch region of Gujarat.

Sindhis are the third-largest ethnic group in Pakistan, after the Punjabis and Pashtuns. Apart from their traditional homeland, Sindh, in Pakistan; significant Sindhi population exists in exists in India, mostly partition migrants and their descendant, most of whom adhere to Hinduism.

Having been isolated throughout history, unlike its neighbours, Sindhi culture has preserved its uniqueness. After the partition of British India in 1947, many Sindhi Hindus and Sindhi Sikhs migrated to the newly independent Dominion of India and other parts of the world; some Sindhis fled and formed diasporas settling in countries such as England and the United States.

Pakistani Sindhis are predominantly Muslim, with a large Hindu minority and smaller populations of Christians and Sikhs. The latter are concentrated mostly in the eastern Sindh. Indian Sindhis are predominantly Hindu with smaller Muslim, Christian, Sikh, and Jain minorities. Despite being geographically separated, Sindhis still maintain strong ties to each other and share similar cultural values and practices.

== Etymology ==

The name Sindhi is derived from the Sanskrit &quot;Sindhu&quot;, which translates as &quot;river&quot; or &quot;sea body&quot;; the Greeks used the term &quot;Indos&quot; to refer to the Indus River and the surrounding region, which is where Sindhi is spoken.

The historical spelling &quot;Sind&quot; (from the Perso-Arabic سند) was discontinued in 1988 by an amendment passed in the Sindh Assembly, and is now spelt &quot;Sindh.&quot; Hence, the term &quot;Sindhi&quot; was also introduced to replace &quot;Sindi&quot;.

In the Balochi language, the traditional terms for Sindhis are &quot;Jadgal&quot; and &quot;Jamote&quot;. They are derived from the prefix &quot;Jatt&quot; referring to the tribe by that name, and the suffix &quot;gal&quot; meaning &quot;speech&quot;. Thus, it signifies someone who speaks the language of the Jatts, i.e. a Jatt. The term &quot;Jatt&quot; historically encompassed Sindhis and Punjabis, and was frequently used by the British for Sindhis in their census records.
== Geographic distribution ==
Sindh has been an ethnic historical region isolated from the rest of India; unlike its neighbors Sindh did not experience violent invasions. Boundaries of various Kingdoms and rulers in Sindh were defined on ethnic lines. Throughout history the geographical definition for Sindh referred to the south of Indus and its neighboring regions.

=== Pakistan ===
Besides Sindh the historical homeland of Sindhis are regions like Kacchi Plain, the Lasbela and Makran regions in Balochistan, the Bahawalpur region of Punjab, the Kutch region of Gujarat and Jaisalmer and Barmer regions of Rajasthan, India. There are many Sindhi-Hindus who migrated to India after partition in 1947.

Sindhis in Pakistan have their own province, Sindh, It also has the largest population of Hindus in Pakistan, with 93% of Pakistani Hindus residing in Sindh.

=== India ===
Sindhi Hindus were an economically prosperous community in urban Sindh before partition, but due to fear of persecution on the basis of religion and after large scale arrival of Muslim refugees from India, they migrated to India after partition. They had a hard time in India developing their economic status with no native homeland to claim, they chose to live in states that had similarity with Sindhi culture. Despite all of that they were successful in establishing themselves as one of India&#x27;s richest communities, especially through business and trade. Sindhis have distinguished themselves in India, from famous actors such as Ranveer Singh and Jimmi Harkishin to veteran politicians such as L. K. Advani, all of whom had families that came from Sindh.

In India as per 2011 census, Sindhis have an estimated population of 2,770,000. Unlike Sindhis in Pakistan, Indian Sindhis are scattered throughout India in states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan.

=== Diaspora ===
Today many Sindhis live outside Pakistan and India, particularly in Afghanistan, where there are an estimated 25,000 of them, largely engaged in merchant trade. In addition, during the crackdown on separatist groups by Pervez Musharraf an estimated 400-500 Sindhi separatists, along with Balochis, fled to Afghanistan.

Another group of Sindhis migrated to the island of Ceylon, which is the now modern day country of Sri Lanka, roughly two centuries ago to engage in business and trade. They came via migration from Hyderabad city of Sindh. However, after partition this trend increased as Sindhi Hindus left their home province. Today they are mainly concentrated around Colombo.

Rich Sindhi communities can also be found in both Hong Kong and Singapore.

==History==
Sindh was the site of one of the Cradle of civilizations, the Bronze Age Indus Valley civilisation that flourished from about 3000 BCE. The Indo-Aryan tribes of Sindh gave rise to the Iron Age vedic civilization, which lasted until 500 BCE. During this era, the Vedas were composed.

In 518 BCE, the Achaemenid empire conquered Indus valley and established Hindush satrapy in Sindh. Following Alexander the Great&#x27;s invasion, Sindh became part of the Mauryan Empire. After its decline, Indo-Greeks, Indo-Scythians and Indo-Parthians ruled in Sindh.

Sindh is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Bab-ul Islam&quot; (transl. &#x27;Gateway of Islam&#x27;), as it was one of the first regions of the Indian subcontinent to come under Islamic rule. Parts of the modern-day province were intermittently subject to raids by the Rashidun army during the early Muslim conquests, but the region did not come under Muslim rule until the Arab invasion of Sind occurred under the Umayyad Caliphate, headed by Muhammad ibn Qasim in 712 CE. Afterwards, Sindh was ruled by a series of dynasties including the Habbaris, Soomras, Sammas, Arghuns and Tarkhans.

The Mughal empire conquered Sindh in 1591 and organized it as &quot;Subah of Thatta&quot;, the first-level imperial division. Sindh again became independent under the Kalhora dynasty. The British conquered Sindh in 1843 after their victory in the Battle of Hyderabad over the Talpur dynasty. Sindh became a separate province in 1936, and after independence became part of Pakistan.

Sindh and surrounding areas contain the ruins of the Indus Valley Civilization. There are remnants of ancient cities and structures, with a notable example in Sindh being that of Mohenjo Daro. Built around 2500 BCE., it was one of the largest settlements of the ancient Indus civilisation or Harappan culture, with features such as standardized bricks, street grids, and covered sewer systems. It was one of the world&#x27;s earliest major cities, contemporaneous with the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Minoan Crete, and Caral-Supe.

Mohenjo-daro was abandoned in the 19th century BCE as the Indus Valley Civilization declined, and the site was not rediscovered until the 1920s. Significant excavation has since been conducted at the site of the city, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980. The site is currently threatened by erosion and improper restoration.

The cities of the ancient Indus were noted for their urban planning, baked brick houses, elaborate drainage systems, water supply systems, clusters of large non-residential buildings, and techniques of handicraft and metallurgy. Mohenjo-daro and Harappa very likely grew to contain between 30,000 and 60,000 individuals, and the civilisation may have contained between one and five million individuals during its florescence. A gradual drying of the region during the 3rd millennium BCE may have been the initial stimulus for its urbanisation. Eventually it also reduced the water supply enough to cause the civilisation&#x27;s demise and to disperse its population to the east.

===Historical period===
For several centuries in the first millennium BCE and in the first five centuries of the first millennium CE, the western portions of Sindh, the regions on the western flank of the Indus river, were intermittently under Persian, Greek and Kushan rule, first during the Achaemenid dynasty (500–300 BCE) during which it made up part of the easternmost satrapies, then, by Alexander the Great, followed by the Indo-Greeks and still later under the Indo-Sassanids, as well as Kushans, before the Islamic conquest between the 7th and 10th centuries CE Alexander the Great marched through Punjab and Sindh, down the Indus river, after his conquest of the Persian Empire.

The Ror dynasty was a power from the Indian subcontinent that ruled modern-day Sindh and Northwest India from 450 BCE to 489 CE.

=== Medieval period ===
Sindh was one of the earliest regions to be conquered by the Arabs and influenced by Islam after 720 CE. Before this period, it was heavily Hindu and Buddhist. After 632 CE., it was part of the Islamic empires of the Abbasids and Umayyids. Habbari, Soomra, Samma, Kalhora dynasties ruled Sindh.

After the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, the Arab expansion towards the east reached the Sindh region beyond Persia. An initial expedition in the region, launched because of the Sindhi pirate attacks on Arabs in 711–12, failed.

In 712, when Mohammed Bin Qasim invaded Sindh with 8000 cavalry while also receiving reinforcements, Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf instructed him not to spare anyone in Debal. According to the &quot;Chach Nama&quot;, after the Arabs scaled Debal&#x27;s walls, the besieged denizens opened the gates and pleaded for mercy but Qasim stated he had no orders to spare anyone. The historian al-Baladhuri stated that after conquest of Debal, Qasim kept slaughtering its inhabitants for three days. The custodians of the Buddhist stupa were killed and the temple was destroyed; 700 women taking shelter there were enslaved. Qasim gave a quarter of the city to Muslims and built a mosque there.

At Ror, 6000 fighting men were massacred with their families enslaved. The massacre at Brahamanabad has various accounts of 6,000 to 26,000 inhabitants slaughtered.
In the late 16th century, Sindh was brought into the Mughal Empire by Akbar, himself born in the Rajputana kingdom in Umerkot in Sindh. Mughal rule from their provincial capital of Thatta was to last in lower Sindh until the early 18th century, while upper Sindh was ruled by the indigenous Kalhora dynasty, consolidating their rule until the mid-18th century, when the Persian sacking of the Mughal throne in Delhi allowed them to grab the rest of Sindh. It is during this the era that the famous Sindhi Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai composed his classic Sindhi text &quot;Shah Jo Risalo&quot;
The Talpur dynasty (Sindhi: ٽالپردور‎‎) succeeded the Kalhoras in 1783 and four branches of the dynasty were established. One ruled lower Sindh from the city of Hyderabad, another ruled over upper Sindh from the city of Khairpur, a third ruled around the eastern city of Mirpur Khas, and a fourth was based in Tando Muhammad Khan. They were ethnically Baloch, and for most of their rule, they were subordinate to the Durrani Empire and were forced to pay tribute to them.

They ruled from 1783 until 1843, when they were in turn defeated by the British at the Battle of Miani and Battle of Dubbo. The northern Khairpur branch of the Talpur dynasty, however, continued to maintain a degree of sovereignty during British rule as the princely state of Khairpur, whose ruler elected to join the new Dominion of Pakistan in October 1947 as an autonomous region, before being fully amalgamated into West Pakistan in 1955.

Baloch migrations in the region between 14th and 18th centuries and many Baloch dynasties saw a high Iranic mixture into Sindhis.

=== Modern period ===
==== British rule ====
The British East India Company conquered Sindh in 1843. General Charles Napier is said to have reported victory to the Governor General with a one-word telegram, namely &quot;Peccavi&quot; – or &quot;I have sinned&quot; (Latin), which was later turned into a pun known as &quot;Forgive me for I have Sindh&quot;.

The British had two objectives in their rule of Sindh: the consolidation of British rule and the use of Sindh as a market for British products and a source of revenue and raw materials. With the appropriate infrastructure in place, the British hoped to exploit Sindh&#x27;s economic potential.

The British incorporated Sindh, some years later after annexing it, into the Bombay Presidency. The distance from the provincial capital, Bombay, led to grievances that Sindh was neglected in contrast to other parts of the Presidency. The merger of Sindh into Punjab province was considered from time to time but was turned down because of British disagreement and Sindhi opposition, both from Muslims and Hindus, to being annexed to Punjab.

==== Post-colonial era ====
In 1947, violence did not constitute a major part of the Sindhi partition experience, unlike in Punjab. This was in part due to the Sufi-influenced culture of religious tolerance and in part because Sindh was not divided and was instead made part of Pakistan in its entirety. Sindhi Hindus who left generally did so out of a fear of persecution, rather than persecution itself, because of the arrival of Muslim refugees from India. Sindhi Hindus differentiated between the local Sindhi Muslims and the migrant Muslims from India. A large number of Sindhi Hindus travelled to India by sea, to the ports of Bombay, Porbandar, Veraval and Okha.

== Demographics ==

=== Ethnicity and religion ===
The two main tribes of Sindh are the Soomro—descendants of the Soomra dynasty, who ruled Sindh during 970–1351 C.E.—and the Samma—descendants of the Samma dynasty, who ruled Sindh during 1351–1521 CE. These tribes belong to the same bloodline.

Among other Sindhi Sammat and Sindhi Rajputs are the Bhuttos, Kambohs, Bhattis, Bhanbhros, Mahendros, Buriros, Bhachos, Chohans, Lakha, Sahetas, Lohanas, Mohano, Dahars, Indhar, Chhachhar, Chachar, Dhareja, Rathores, Dakhan, Langah, Junejo, Mahars, etc. One of the oldest Sindhi tribes is the Charan. The Sindhi-Sipahi of Rajasthan and the Sandhai Muslims of Gujarat are communities of Sindhi Rajputs settled in India. Closely related to the Sindhi Rajputs are the Sindhi Jats, who are found mainly in the Indus delta region. However, tribes are of little importance in Sindh as compared to in Punjab and Balochistan. Identity in Sindh is mostly based on a common ethnicity and language.

Islam in Sindh has a long history, starting with the capture of Sindh by Muhammad Bin Qasim in 712 CE. Over time, the majority of the population in Sindh converted to Islam, especially in rural areas. Today, Muslims make up over 90% of the population, and are more dominant in urban than rural areas.

Islam in Sindh has a strong Sufi ethos with numerous Muslim saints and mystics, such as the Sufi poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, having lived in Sindh historically. One popular legend which highlights the strong Sufi presence in Sindh is that 125,000 Sufi saints and mystics are buried on Makli Hill near Thatta. The development of Sufism in Sindh was similar to the development of Sufism in other parts of the Muslim world. In the 16th century two Sufi tareeqat (orders)—Qadria and Naqshbandia—were introduced in Sindh. Sufism continues to play an important role in the daily lives of Sindhis.

Sindh also has Pakistan&#x27;s highest percentage of Hindus overall, which accounts 8.7% of the population, roughly around 4.2 million people, and 13.3% of the province&#x27;s rural population as per 2017 Pakistani census report. These numbers also include the scheduled caste population, which stands at 1.7% of the total in Sindh (or 3.1% in rural areas), and is believed to have been under-reported, with some community members instead counted under the main Hindu category. Although Pakistan Hindu Council claimed that there are 6,842,526 Hindus living in Sindh Province covering around 14.29% of the region&#x27;s population. Umerkot district in the Thar Desert is Pakistan&#x27;s only Hindu-majority district. The Shri Ramapir Temple in Tandoallahyar whose annual festival is the second largest Hindu pilgrimage in Pakistan is in Sindh. Sindh is also the only province in Pakistan to have a separate law for governing Hindu marriages.

Per community estimates, there are approximately 10,000 Sikhs in Sindh.

===Sindhi Hindus===
Hinduism along with Buddhism was the predominant religion in Sindh before the Arab Islamic conquest. The Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang, who visited the region in the years 630–644, said that Buddhism was declining in the region. While Buddhism declined and ultimately disappeared after the Arab conquest, mainly due to conversion of almost all of the Buddhist population of Sindh to Islam, Hinduism managed to survive as a significant minority through Muslim rule until before the partition of India. Derryl Maclean explains what he calls &quot;the persistence of Hinduism&quot; on the basis of &quot;the radical dissimilarity between the socio-economic bases of Hinduism and Buddhism in Sind&quot;: Buddhism in this region was mainly urban and mercantile while Hinduism was rural and non-mercantile, thus the Arabs, themselves urban and mercantile, attracted and converted the Buddhist classes, but for the rural and non-mercantile parts, only interested by the taxes, they promoted a more decentralized authority and appointed Brahmins for the task, who often just continued the roles they had in the previous Hindu rule.

According to the 2017 Census of Pakistan, Hindus constituted about 8.7% of the total population of Sindh province, roughly around 4.2 million people. Most of them live in urban areas such as Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur and Mirpur Khas. Hyderabad is currently the largest centre of Sindhi Hindus in Pakistan, with 100,000–150,000 living there. The ratio of Hindus in Sindh was higher before the Partition of India in 1947.

Prior to the Partition of India, around 73% of the population of Sindh was Muslim with almost 26% of the remaining being Hindu.

Hindus in Sindh were concentrated in the urban areas before the Partition of India in 1947, during which most migrated to modern-day India according to Ahmad Hassan Dani. In the urban centres of Sindh, Hindus formed the majority of the population before the partition. The cities and towns of Sindh were dominated by the Hindus. In 1941, Hindus were 64% of the total urban population. According to the 1941 Census of India, Hindus formed around 74% of the population of Hyderabad, 70% of Sukkur, 65% of Shikarpur and about half of Karachi. By the 1951 Census of Pakistan, all of these cities had virtually been emptied of their Hindu population as a result of the partition.

Hindus were also spread over the rural areas of Sindh province. Thari (a dialect of Sindhi) is spoken in Sindh in Pakistan and Rajasthan in India.

===Sindhi Muslims===

The connection between Sindh and Islam was established by the initial Muslim missions. According to Derryl N. Maclean, a link between Sindh and Muslims during the Caliphate of Ali can be traced to Hakim ibn Jabalah al-Abdi, a companion of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, who traveled across Sind to Makran in the year 649 CE and presented a report on the area to the Caliph. He supported Ali, and died in the Battle of the Camel alongside Sindhi Jats. He was also a poet and few couplets of his poem in praise of Ali ibn Abu Talib have survived, as reported in Chachnama:
During the reign of Ali, many Jats came under the influence of Islam. Harith ibn Murrah Al-abdi and Sayfi ibn Fil&#x27; al-Shaybani, both officers of Ali&#x27;s army, attacked Sindhi bandits and chased them to Al-Qiqan (present-day Quetta) in the year 658. Sayfi was one of the seven partisans of Ali who were beheaded alongside Hujr ibn Adi al-Kindi in 660 C.E., near Damascus.

In 712 C.E., Sindh was incorporated into the Caliphate, the Islamic Empire, and became the &quot;Arabian gateway&quot; into India (later to become known as &quot;Bab-ul-Islam&quot;, the gate of Islam).

Sindh produced many Muslim scholars early on, &quot;men whose influence extended to Iraq where the people thought highly of their learning&quot;, in particular in hadith, with the likes of poet Abu al- &#x27;Ata Sindhi (d. 159) or hadith and fiqh scholar Abu Mashar Sindhi (d. 160), among many others. Sindhi scholars also translated scientific texts from Sanskrit into Arabic, for instance, the Zij al-Sindhind in astronomy.

The majority of Muslim Sindhis follow the Sunni Hanafi fiqh with a minority being Shia Ithna &#x27;ashariyah. Sufism has left a deep impact on Sindhi Muslims and this is visible through the numerous Sufi shrines which dot the landscape of Sindh.

Sindhi Muslim culture is highly influenced by Sufi doctrines and principles. Some of the popular cultural icons are Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai, Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, Jhulelal and Sachal Sarmast.

===Tribes===
Major tribes in Sindh include Soomros, Sammas, Kalhoras, Bhuttos and Rajper, all of these tribes have significant influence in Sindh.

===Emigration===
The Sindhi diaspora is significant. Emigration from the Sindh became mainstream after the 19th century with the British conquest of Sindh. A number of Sindhi traders emigrated to the Canary Islands and Gibraltar in this period.

After the Partition of India, many Sindhi Hindus emigrated to Europe, especially to the United Kingdom, North America, and Middle Eastern states such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Some settled in Hong Kong.

=== Genetics ===

Sindhis exhibit high frequencies of allele-B cell, which shows similarities with those of Middle-East having 87% Caucasoid admixture. 
==Culture==

Sindhi culture has its roots in the Indus Valley civilization. Sindh has been shaped by the largely desert region and the natural resources it had available. The Indus or Sindhu River that passes through the land, and the Arabian Sea (that defines its borders) also supported the seafaring traditions among the local people.

The local climate also reflects why the Sindhis have the language, folklore, traditions, customs and lifestyle that are so different from the neighbouring regions. The Sindhi culture is also strongly practiced by the Sindhi diaspora.

The roots of Sindhi culture go back to the distant past. Archaeological research during 19th and 20th centuries showed the roots of social life, religion and culture of the people of the Sindh: their agricultural practices, traditional arts and crafts, customs and tradition and other parts of social life, going back to a mature Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BC. Recent researches have traced the Indus valley civilization to even earlier ancestry.

=== Language ===
Sindhi is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by about 30 million people in the Pakistani province of Sindh, where it has official institutional status and has plans to being promoted further. It is also spoken by a further 4.8 million people in India, where it is a scheduled language, without any state-level official status. Despite that there have been online methods for teaching Sindhi.

The main writing system is the Perso-Arabic script, which accounts for the majority of the Sindhi literature and is the only one currently used in Pakistan. In India, both the Perso-Arabic script and Devanagari are used.
At the occasion of &#x27;Mother Language Day&#x27; in 2023, the Sindh Assembly passed a unanimous resolution to extend and increase the status of Sindhi as the national language

Sindhi is believed to be originated from an older Indo-Aryan dialect spoken in Indus valley, Sindhi has an attested history from the 10th century CE. Sindhi was one of the first Indo-Aryan languages to encounter influence from Persian and Arabic following the Umayyad conquest in 712 CE.

A substantial body of Sindhi literature developed during the Medieval period, the most famous of which is the religious and mystic poetry of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai from the 18th century. Modern Sindhi was promoted under British rule beginning in 1843, which led to the current status of the language in independent Pakistan after 1947.

During British rule in India, a variant of the Persian alphabet was adopted for Sindhi in the 19th century. The script is used in Pakistan and India today. It has a total of 52 letters, augmenting the Persian with digraphs and eighteen new letters () for sounds particular to Sindhi and other Indo-Aryan languages. Some letters that are distinguished in Arabic or Persian are homophones in Sindhi.


The name &quot;Sindhi&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit &quot;síndhu&quot;, the original name of the Indus River, along whose delta Sindhi is spoken. Like other languages of the Indo-Aryan family, Sindhi is descended from Old Indo-Aryan (Sanskrit) via Middle Indo-Aryan (Pali, secondary Prakrits, and Apabhramsha). 20th century Western scholars such as George Abraham Grierson believed that Sindhi descended specifically from the Vrācaḍa dialect of Apabhramsha (described by Markandeya as being spoken in &quot;Sindhu-deśa&quot;, corresponding to modern Sindh) but later work has shown this to be unlikely.

In Pakistan, Sindhi is the first language of 30.26 million people, or % of the country&#x27;s population as of the 2017 census. 29.5 million of these are found in Sindh, where they account for % of the total population of the province. There are 0.56 million speakers in the province of Balochistan, especially in the Kacchi Plain that encompasses the districts of Lasbela, Hub, Kachhi, Sibi, Usta Muhammad, Jafarabad, Jhal Magsi, Nasirabad and Sohbatpur.

In India, there were a total of 1.68 million speakers according to the 2011 census. The states with the largest numbers were Maharashtra (), Rajasthan (), Gujarat (), and Madhya Pradesh ().

=== Traditional dress ===

The traditional Sindhi clothing varies from tribe to tribe but most common are Paro Cholo, Salwar Cholo and Ghagho, Abho and Jubo (different types of frocks) with Sindhi embroideries and mirror work for women and long wide veil is important. Traditional dress for men is the Sindhi version of Shalwar Qameez or Kurta and above kameez or kurta a traditional embroidered or printed koti/gidi/sadri and Ajrak or Lungi (shawls) with either Sindhi Patko or Sindhi topi. Ajrak is added to dress for allure.

=== Literature ===

Sindhi literature is very rich, and is one of the world&#x27;s oldest literatures. The earliest reference to Sindhi literature is contained in the writings of Arab historians. It is established that Sindhi was the first eastern language into which the Quran was translated, in the 8th or 9th century. There is evidence of Sindhi poets reciting their verses before the Muslim Caliphs in Baghdad. It is also recorded that treatises were written in Sindhi on astronomy, medicine and history during the 8th and 9th centuries.

Sindhi literature is the composition of oral and written scripts and texts in the Sindhi language in the form of prose: (romantic tales, and epic stories) and poetry: (Ghazal, Wai and Nazm). The Sindhi language is considered to be one of the oldest languages of Ancient India, due to the influence of the language of Indus Valley inhabitants. Sindhi literature has developed over a thousand years.

According to the historians, Nabi Bux Baloch, Rasool Bux Palijo, and GM Syed, Sindhi had a great influence on the Hindi language in pre-Islamic times. Nevertheless, after the advent of Islam in eighth century, Arabic language and Persian language influenced the inhabitants of the area and were the official language of the territory through different periods.

=== Music ===

The folk music of Sindh is generally of five genres that originated in Sindh. The first one is the &quot;Baits&quot;. The Baits style is vocal music in which Sanhoon (low voice) or Graham (high voice) is used.

Second is &quot;Waee&quot; instrumental music, which is performed in a variety of ways using a string instrument. Waee is also known as Kafi.

Other genres are Lada/Sehra/Geech, Dhammal, Doheera etc. The Sindhi folk musical instruments are Algozo, Tamburo, Chung, Yaktaro, Dholak, Khartal/Chapri/Dando, Sarangi, Surando, Benjo, Bansri, Borindo, Murli/Been, Gharo/Dilo, Tabla, Khamach/Khamachi, Narr, Kanjhyun/Talyoon, Duhl Sharnai and Muto, Nagaro, Danburo, Ravanahatha etc.

=== Dance ===

Dances of Sindh include the famous Ho Jamalo and Dhammal. Other common dances include Jhumar/Jhumir (different from the Jhumar dance of South Punjab), Kafelo, and Jhamelo. However, none of these have survived as much as Ho Jamalo. In marriages and on other occasions, a special type of song is produced; these are known as &quot;Ladas/Sehra/Geech&quot; and are sung to celebrate the occasion of marriage, birth and on other special days. They are mostly performed by women.

Some popular dances include:

* Jamalo: The notable Sindhi dance which is celebrated by Sindhis across the world.
* Jhumar/Jhumir: Performed on weddings and on special occasions.
* Dhamaal: is a mystical dance performed by Dervish.
* Chej, Although Chej has seen decline in Sindh it remains popular among Sindhi Hindus and the diaspora.
* Bhagat: is a dance performed by professionals to entertain visiting people.
* Doka/Dandio: Dance performed using sticks.
* Charuri: Performed in thar.
* Muhana Dance: A traditional dance performed by fisherfolk of Sindh.
* Rasudo: Dance of Nangarparkar.

=== Folk tales ===
Sindhi folklore folk traditions have developed in Sindh over a number of centuries. Sindh abounds with folklore, in all forms, and colours from such obvious manifestations as the traditional Watayo Faqir tales, The legend of Moriro, the epic tale of Dodo Chanesar, to the heroic character of Marui, which distinguishes it among the contemporary folklores of the region. The love story of Sassui, who pines for her lover Punhu, is known and sung in every Sindhi settlement. Examples of the folklore of Sindh include the stories of Umar Marui and Suhuni Mehar.

Sindhi folk singers and women play a vital role in transmitting Sindhi folklore. They sang the folktales of Sindh in songs with passion in every village of Sindh.

Sindhi folklore has been compiled in a series of forty volumes under Sindhi Adabi Board&#x27;s project of folklore and literature. This valuable project was accomplished by noted Sindhi scholar Nabi Bux Khan Baloch. Folk tales such as Dodo Chanesar, Sassi Punnu, Moomal Rano, and Umar Marvi are examples of Sindhi folk tales.

The most famous Sindhi folk tales are known as the &quot;Seven Heroines&quot; of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. Some notable tales include:

* Umar Marui 
* 
* 
* 

=== Festivals ===
Sindhis are very festive and like to organize festivals to commemorate their culture and heritage. Most Sindhi celebrate Sindhi Culture day, which is celebrated regardless of religion to express their love for their culture. It is observed with great zeal.

==== Muslims ====
Sindhi Muslims celebrate Islamic festivals such as Eid-ul-Adha, Eid al-Fitr and Jaatiyun wari Eid, which are celebrated with zeal and enthusiasm but they are in no way related to Sindhi culture. A festival known as Jashn-e-Larkana is also celebrated by Sindhi Muslims.

==== Hindus ====
Compared to their Muslim counterparts, Hindu festivals are numerous and largely dependent on respective caste. Many Hindus have festivals based on a certain deity; common festivals include Cheti Chand (Sindhi new-year) Teejri, Thadri, Utraan.

=== Cuisine ===
Sindhi cuisine has been influenced by Central Asian, Iranian, and Mughal food traditions. It is mostly a non-vegetarian cuisine, with even Sindhi Hindus widely accepting of meat consumption. The daily food in most Sindhi households consists of wheat-based flat-bread (mani/roti) and rice accompanied by two dishes, one gravy and one dry with curd, papad or pickle. Freshwater fish and a wide variety of vegetables are usually used in Sindhi cuisine.

Restaurants specializing in Sindhi cuisine are rare, although it is found at truck stops in rural areas of Sindh province, and in a few restaurants in urban Sindh.

The arrival of Islam within India influenced the local cuisine to a great degree. Since Muslims are forbidden to eat pork or consume alcohol and the Halal dietary guidelines are strictly observed, Muslim Sindhis focus on ingredients such as beef, lamb, chicken, fish, vegetables and traditional fruit and dairy. Hindu Sindhi cuisine is almost identical with the difference that beef is omitted. The influence of Central Asian, South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisine in Sindhi food is ubiquitous. Sindhi cuisine was also found in India, where many Sindhi Hindus migrated following the Partition of India in 1947. Before Independence, the State of Sindh was under the Bombay Presidency.

===Culture Day===

Sindhi Cultural Day () is a popular Sindhi cultural festival. It is celebrated with traditional enthusiasm to highlight the centuries-old rich culture of Sindh. The day is celebrated each year in the first week of December on the Sunday. It is widely celebrated all over Sindh, and amongst the Sindhi diaspora population around the world. Sindhis celebrate this day to demonstrate the peaceful identity of Sindhi culture and acquire the attention of the world towards their rich heritage.

On this holiday people gather in all major cities of Sindh at press clubs, and other places to arrange various activities. They engage in literary (poetic) gatherings, &quot;mach katchehri&quot; (gathering in a place and sitting round in a circle and the fire on sticks in the center), musical concerts, seminars, lecture programs and rallies. On the occasion people wearing Ajrak and Sindhi Topi, traditional block printed shawls, attend musical programs and rallies in many cities. Major hallmarks of cities and towns are decorated with Sindhi Ajrak. People across Sindh exchange gifts of Ajrak and Topi at various ceremonies. Even the children and women dress up in Ajrak, assembling at the grand gathering, where famous Sindhi singers sing Sindhi songs. The musical performances of the artists inspire the participants to dance to Sindhi tunes and the national song ‘&quot;Jeay Sindh Jeay-Sindh Wara Jean&quot;’.

All political, social and religious organizations of Sindh, besides the Sindh Culture Department and administrations of various schools, colleges and universities, organize a variety of events including seminars, debates, folk music programs, drama and theatric performances, tableaus and literary sittings to mark this annual festivity. Sindhi culture, history and heritage are highlighted at the events.

=== Poetry ===

Prominent in Sindhi culture, poetry continues an oral tradition dating back a thousand years, based on folk tales. Sindhi is one of the major oldest languages of the Indus Valley, having a particular literary colour both in poetry and prose. Sindhi poetry is very rich in thought as well as containing a variety of genres like other developed languages.

The poetry of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai and Sachal Sarmast is very famous throughout Sindh. Since the 1940s, Sindhi poetry has incorporated broader influences, including the sonnet and blank verse. Soon after the independence of Pakistan in 1947, these forms were reinforced by Triolet, Haiku, Renga and Tanka. At present, these forms continue to co-exist, albeit in a varying degree, with Azad Nazm having an edge over them all.

<text>Costco Wholesale Corporation is an American multinational corporation which operates a chain of membership-only big-box warehouse club retail stores. As of 2021, Costco is the third-largest retailer in the world. As of August 2024, Costco is the world&#x27;s largest retailer of beef, poultry, organic produce, and wine, and just under one-third of American consumers regularly shop at Costco warehouses. Costco is ranked #11 on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. Costco originally began with a wholesale business model aimed at enrolling businesses as members, then also began to enroll individual consumers and sell products intended for them, including its own private label brand.

Costco&#x27;s worldwide headquarters are in Issaquah, Washington, an eastern suburb of Seattle, although its Kirkland Signature house label bears the name of its former location in Kirkland. The company opened its first &quot;warehouse&quot; (the chain&#x27;s term for its retail outlets) in Seattle Through mergers, however, Costco&#x27;s corporate history dates back to 1976, when its former competitor Price Club was founded in San Diego, California. , Costco operates 890 warehouses worldwide: 616 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 109 in Canada, 41 in Mexico, 36 in Japan, 29 in the United Kingdom, 19 in South Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, 7 in China, 5 in Spain, 2 in France, 1 in Iceland, 1 in New Zealand, and 1 in Sweden.

==History==


===Price Club===

Costco&#x27;s earliest predecessor, Price Club, opened its first store on July 12, 1976, on Morena Boulevard in San Diego, California. It was founded three months earlier by Sol Price and his son, Robert, following a dispute with the new owners of FedMart, Price&#x27;s previous membership-only discount store. Price Club was among the first retail warehouse clubs, beginning with its Morena Boulevard store inside a series of old airplane hangars once owned by Howard Hughes. The store, known as Costco Warehouse #401, is still in operation today.

Price Club&#x27;s sales model targeted small business owners, selling items in bulk for a discounted price at no-frills outlets that were accessible only with an annual membership fee. The company launched an initial public offering in 1980 and expanded to 24 locations in the Southwest and 1.1 million members by early 1986. Price Club expanded into Canada in 1986, opening a store in Montreal, followed by a Mexico City store in 1992 as part of a joint venture with hypermarket chain Controladora Comercial Mexicana. The company also announced plans to open stores in Spain and Portugal through their Canadian subsidiary.

===Costco opens===
Jim Sinegal and Jeffrey H. Brotman opened the first Costco warehouse in Seattle on September 15, 1983. Sinegal had started in wholesale distribution by working for Sol Price at FedMart; Brotman, an attorney from an old Seattle retailing family, had also been involved in retail distribution from an early age. During this time, small businesses were given an 8% or 9% discount on inventories. Sinegal began his retail involvement as a grocery bagger. A second store opened in Portland in October, and a third in Spokane in The company went public in 1985 with 17 warehouses nationally and 1,950 employees. The company was initially headquartered at its first warehouse in Seattle but moved its headquarters to Kirkland in 1987.

===The &quot;PriceCostco&quot; merger===
In 1993, Costco and Price Club agreed to merge operations after Price declined an offer from Walmart to merge Price Club with their warehouse store chain, Sam&#x27;s Club. Costco&#x27;s business model and size were similar to those of Price Club, which made the merger more natural for both companies. The combined company took the name PriceCostco, and memberships became universal, meaning that a Price Club member could use their membership to shop at Costco and vice versa. PriceCostco boasted 206 locations generating $16billion in annual sales. PriceCostco was initially led by executives from both companies, but in 1994, the Prices left the company to form PriceSmart, a warehouse club chain in Central America and the Caribbean unrelated to the current Costco.

Costco moved its headquarters from Kirkland to Issaquah in 1996. It chose to build a new headquarters campus next to a warehouse store to allow buyers to check sales and merchandise. They had originally planned to move by December 1993 to Redmond, another Eastside city, but delays in road construction near the warehouse site caused the company to reconsider. The former Kirkland headquarters, a campus, was sold in late 1996.

The company began testing store conversions to Costco branding across the Southwestern United States in late 1996. It officially reverted to using the Costco name and stock symbol in February 1997, with all remaining Price Club locations subsequently rebranded as Costco.

In March 2020, Costco announced the acquisition of Innovel, a logistics company, for one billion dollars.

===Other company milestones===

The first Costco warehouse in Seattle was replaced with a new building on an adjacent lot to the north in March 2005; the company was able to arrange to keep the same address for the new building, which was on land acquired from Seattle Public Schools. The original building was demolished and replaced by a parking lot, gas station, and car wash—the company&#x27;s first—that opened in 2006.

In 2014, Costco was the third largest retailer in the United States. That year Costco announced plans to open an online store in China using Alibaba Group.

Costco announced the opening of 29 new locations in 2016, the most in one year since 2007. Span Construction, led by King Husein, has constructed almost all of Costco&#x27;s buildings since 1989.

Costco opened its first warehouse in China on August 27, 2019, in Shanghai. The store attracted so many customers that it had to close after only a couple of hours.

The first Costco in New Zealand was first opened at West Auckland in September 2022, delayed from mid-August due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Costco today===
In the United States, Costco&#x27;s main competitors operating membership warehouses are Sam&#x27;s Club (a subsidiary of Walmart) and BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club. Costco employs 316,000 full and part-time employees worldwide. Costco had 90.3million members in 2017. In 2020, Costco had 105.5million members. In 2021, the company had 111.6million members. , Costco had 129.5million members.

Costco was the first company to grow from $0 in sales to $3billion in sales in under six years. For the fiscal year ending on August 31, 2012, the company&#x27;s sales totaled $97.062billion, with $1.709billion net profit. , Costco is ranked #14 on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. The ACSI (The American Customer Satisfaction Index) named Costco number one in the specialty retail store industry with a score of 84 in 2014.

From December 2013, Costco&#x27;s board of directors was chaired by co-founder Jeffrey H. Brotman and included James Sinegal, co-founder and director, and two officers of the company: president/CEO W. Craig Jelinek and CFO Richard A. Galanti. On August 1, 2017, Jeffrey Brotman died. , James Sinegal and W. Craig Jelinek remained on the board. Jim Sinegal stepped down in 2018.

===Costco Business Centers===

Costco Business Centers are warehouses similar to regular Costco warehouses, and are open to all Costco members, regardless of membership type. Their merchandise caters predominantly to enterprises, with a focus on small businesses. Business Centers do not carry most consumer items like clothing, jewelry, media, and tires, while carrying larger quantities and more options for the business products they do carry. More than 70% of the items that can be acquired from a Costco Business Center cannot be found in a typical Costco store. Some locations do have a food court, a gas station, or both. They have large parking spaces for trucks and are capable of delivering goods to businesses in bulk quantities, with a delivery charge of $25 for orders that are below $250. Costco Business Center operating hours are shorter than regular warehouses (usually opening at 7:00 am on Mondays to Saturdays and closed on Sundays), while discounts and coupons for Business Centers are issued separately from regular warehouses.

The first Business Center was a converted Costco warehouse in Lynnwood, Washington that reopened in October 1996 following renovations; the change was made after a conventional Costco warehouse had opened in nearby Everett.

====Locations====
, there are 26 Costco Business Centers in the United States.

The first Costco Business Center outside the US opened in Canada in Scarborough, Ontario, in March 2017. In September 2020, the second Canadian Costco Business Centre opened in Saint-Hubert, Quebec, near Montreal. A third Canadian Business Centre opened in the Ottawa neighborhood of Gloucester in March 2021.

== Finances ==
For the fiscal year 2023, Costco reported earnings of US$6.292billion, with an annual revenue of $242.29billion.
== Ownership ==
Costco is mainly owned by institutional investors, who own over 70% of shares. The largest shareholders as of September 2024 are:

* The Vanguard Group (9.40%)
* BlackRock (7.56%)
* State Street Corporation (4.06%)
* Geode Capital Management (2.14%)
* Morgan Stanley (2.13%)
* Fidelity Investments (FMR) (2.10%)
* Bank of America (1.59%)
* Norges Bank (1.20%)
* Northern Trust (1.05%)
* BNY Mellon (1.01%)

==Business model==

Costco is a membership-only warehouse which generates a majority of its profits from membership fees and a small percentage from retail sales. Customers must buy memberships to access the warehouse and make purchases. This is executed through the direct sourcing and efficient inventory management techniques.

Costco divides its business into three segments: United States Operations, Canadian Operations, and Other International Operations. These three business segments are reported by revenue and operating income. Of the three, the United States Operations was the largest, followed by Canadian Operations.

=== Sales model ===
One company rule states that no regular item may be marked up more than 14% over cost and no Kirkland Signature item may be marked up more than 15% over cost. The company runs very lean, with overhead costs at about 10% of revenue and profit margins at 2%. For example, Costco has no public relations department and buys no outside advertising. Costco&#x27;s annual membership fees (US$65/year for Gold Star, US$130/year for Executive ) account for 80% of Costco&#x27;s gross margin and 70% of its operating income.

Costco&#x27;s sales model is to focus on limited selection over variety. Although consumer products often come in many different varieties, Costco will not carry most of those variants, but instead will carry only one or two examples of what is essentially the same product and try to sell a higher volume of units at a lower price. Thus, a typical Costco warehouse carries only 3,700 distinct products, while a typical Walmart Supercenter carries approximately 140,000 products. If Costco feels the wholesale price of any individual product is too high, they will refuse to stock the product. For example, in November 2009, Costco announced that it would stop selling Coca-Cola products because the soft-drink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices. Costco resumed selling Coca-Cola products the following month. Finally, Costco insists that manufacturers must package their products in large sizes and properly arrange them on pallets suitable for deployment to its warehouses. However, unlike most chain stores, Costco does not sell shelf space to manufacturers.

Due to its massive size and its extremely selective approach to buying products, Costco has become a powerful &quot;arbiter&quot; between manufacturers and consumers. From the perspective of small manufacturers, the reward for jumping through all these hoops to sell products to Costco is the possibility of obtaining international distribution through the company&#x27;s warehouses in other countries. If a manufacturer&#x27;s product is popular at warehouses in its home country, Costco may look into whether members in other countries might also be interested in that product.

Although the company engages in visible efforts to reduce costs, the stores themselves are expensive. In 2013, Costco spent approximately $80million on each of the new stores it opened. 

The cost is partly driven by the cost of real estate, as each new store requires enough space to support a building of approximately in size, a large parking lot, and often a gas station.

Lighting costs are reduced on sunny days because most Costco locations have several skylights. During the day, electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights. During an average sunny day, it is normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use.

Rotisserie chickens are a major driver of customer traffic and sales for Costco, which has sold them since 1994 amid the then-rising popularity of Boston Market. In response to the annual growth of per-capita chicken consumption in the United States, Costco opened a factory in Nebraska in 2019 that implemented vertical integration across all aspects of poultry production in a bid to keep their pricing intact while maintaining consistent quality control of them. In some international markets, Costco also offers sushi that is made in-house; the Issaquah warehouse became the first US store to have in-house sushi in 2023.

Costco is known for its &quot;exit greeters&quot;, who briefly compare receipts against shopping cart contents as customers exit. They are trained to quickly count cart contents and serve as a form of customer service to verify that customers were charged correctly, have redeemed any voucher-based items (e.g., tickets), and have not missed items placed in their cart&#x27;s lower racks. Costco has used exit greeters since its first store in 1983.

===Management model===

Costco is known for a strong corporate culture which encourages and rewards loyalty and promotes from within. As of 2024, Costco claims to have a retention rate over 90% for new employees who make it to one year. Many of its senior executives started out as front-line employees in its warehouses and spent many years rising through the ranks to reach their current positions. For example, Ron Vachris started in 1982 as a forklift driver at a Price Club in Arizona and became only the third chief executive officer in Costco&#x27;s history in 2024. Since 95% of the company&#x27;s workforce is in its warehouses, and so many of its executives started their careers there, the company&#x27;s culture is tightly focused on supporting the warehouse experience.

At Costco headquarters in Issaquah, all 7,000 headquarters employees sit in cubicles, including the chief executive officer. However, the CEO does get to have a slightly larger cubicle. All Costco executives are expected to get out of the office regularly and spend the majority of their time in the field visiting warehouses and solving problems. The CEO attempts to visit as many warehouses as possible around the world in a cycle every 18 to 24 months, while executives responsible for smaller geographical areas are expected to visit all the warehouses under their supervision much more often.

===Online shopping===
Costco primarily focuses on getting members to come in to a warehouse for purchases, instead of ordering products online. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Costco&#x27;s online sales increased dramatically, with more online sales growth in 2020 than the previous five years combined.

In November 1998, the company launched Costco Online, its online shopping site. The site expanded to incorporate B2B e-commerce on April 17, 2001.

Instacart offers Costco delivery in a select number of states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia.

Similarly, in March 2017, Costco initiated a partnership with Shipt, an online grocery delivery service. Unlike Instacart, Shipt charges its own membership fee, $99 a year or $14 a month, in exchange for free delivery on orders over $35. , Shipt offers Costco delivery in select Florida markets.

In October 2017, Costco launched same-day and two-day grocery delivery options for members.

In June 2023, Costco in Iceland opened up for click-and-collect alcohol sales, having previously only been open to businesses.

==Products==
Costco frequently rotates its inventory, often stocking items temporarily or seasonally. In a 2017 speech in San Diego, Sinegal explained that &quot;we have created a treasure-hunt atmosphere&quot;. Costco&#x27;s unique business model creates a &quot;sense of urgency&quot; in shoppers to impulsively buy a good deal as soon as they spot one, since it will probably not be there the next time they come back to a Costco warehouse.

Over the years, Costco has significantly expanded its range of products. While initially focusing on bulk, boxed items easily displayed in store by removing the stretch wrap from a pallet, Costco&#x27;s offerings now include a diverse array of items of all shapes and sizes. These range from art, books, caskets, and clothing, to computer software, fine wine, furniture, home appliances, electronics, hot tubs, jewelry, and various perishable goods like dairy, baked items, flowers, produce, meat, and seafood. Other items such as solar panels, tires, and vacuum cleaners have also found their way into Costco&#x27;s product lineup.

Beyond products, many Costco warehouses feature additional services including gas stations, pharmacies, hearing aid centers, optometry and eyewear departments, and tire installation garages.

=== Alcohol ===
Alcohol sales at Costco vary by location due to differing regulations. In some places, separate liquor stores exist to adhere to licensing laws, whereas in others, alcohol is available within the main warehouse alongside general merchandise. In certain states, like Texas, liquor sales must be conducted by a separate business entity with its own staff.

Costco&#x27;s desire to alter its alcohol sales structure in its home state faced a setback in 2006 when it lost its court battle against Washington State&#x27;s requirement for retailers to buy wine through the state-controlled system. The company then changed strategies. Costco spent over $22 million to support Initiative 1183, versus $11.75 million from opponents, &quot;the most expensive initiative fight&quot; in the history of Washington State. In the November 8, 2011 election, Initiative 1183 passed with 60 percent of the vote and led to the demolition of the Washington state government&#x27;s monopoly on the distribution of liquor and spirits for retail sale through state-owned and state-licensed liquor stores.

The Costco warehouses with the largest wine departments have a &quot;wine steward&quot; who roams around that department and advises Costco customers on what wines are best for their needs. As of October 2024, Costco employed about 30 wine stewards at its US warehouses.

In the 21st century, Costco has made its store openings into special events by featuring special selections of whiskey, wine, and other alcoholic beverages which are extremely rare and not normally sold at its warehouses, or extremely cheap, or both. For the October 2024 opening of Costco&#x27;s first warehouse in Napa, California, die-hard whiskey fans began camping out on the sidewalk six days in advance.

International operations must navigate regional laws as well. For example, Costco&#x27;s first store in Victoria, Australia, operates under the country&#x27;s relatively liberal alcohol licensing laws, allowing sales directly off the shelf as is common in most European countries. However, in New Zealand, Costco&#x27;s sole warehouse in West Auckland is restricted from selling alcohol due to a local monopoly on liquor retail.

===Books===

For much of its history, Costco has been a major American bookseller in its own right, in an era in which e-commerce giant Amazon and big-box bookstore chain Barnes &amp; Noble were wiping out traditional bookstores. Costco became one of the few American brick-and-mortar retail outlets where many shoppers who rarely visited bookstores could easily detour to the book section to browse hard copy books, discover books they might not have otherwise noticed, and buy them right away. When Costco chose to buy any particular book, it usually acquired tens of thousands of copies, which was important to a publishing industry where a print run of 50,000 copies is a big deal.

In the 2020s, Costco management reportedly began to consider no longer carrying books as a year-round product category because they are extremely labor-intensive products. New books must be unpacked and laid out by hand on tables when released each Tuesday, while books which failed to sell must be manually collected and returned to their publishers.

In 2022, Costco quietly closed the year-round book sections in its Alaska and Hawaii warehouses. In June 2024, several publishing executives warned that in January 2025, Costco was planning to do the same across its 600 warehouses in the contiguous United States. In other words, books would become just one more rotating inventory item for eight months each year, and would reappear as a full section only during the holiday shopping season in the last four months of each year. This was deeply alarming to a publishing industry already facing stagnating book sales. In November 2024, Costco agreed to keep year-round book sections for the time being in 100 of its 600 mainland US warehouses.

===Gold bars===
Costco began selling one-ounce, 24-karat gold bars in October 2023. While typically selling for about 2% above the spot price, Costco offers 2% cash back for executive members and another 2% for users of certain credit cards. Thus it is seen as a low-profit venture for Costco and a loss leader for increasing store memberships.

===Kirkland Signature===

Kirkland Signature is Costco&#x27;s private label brand, featured on a wide array of products sold across Costco&#x27;s warehouses and its website. Launched in 1995, the brand takes its name from the original location of Costco&#x27;s corporate headquarters in Kirkland, Washington. It accounts for nearly one-third of the company&#x27;s sales and outpaces the growth of Costco&#x27;s overall sales.

The aim of the Kirkland Signature brand was to offer products with brand name quality at discounted prices. Recognizing the typical consumer skepticism common with private labels, Costco has adopted a strategy of co-branding certain items with well-known manufacturers to bolster consumer trust. Notable co-branded products include those from Chinet, Jelly Belly, Keurig Green Mountain, Ocean Spray, Stearns &amp; Foster, and Starbucks. Additionally, while some Kirkland Signature products maintain a generic label, they are produced in partnership with recognized companies such as Duracell and Niagara Bottling. The brand often uses simple, minimalist packaging, reflecting its focus on offering high-quality products at affordable prices.

==Publications==
===&quot;Costco Connection&quot;===
&quot;Costco Connection&quot; is a magazine sent free to the Costco executive members; it can also be accessed online by anyone, free of charge. , the magazine is distributed to 15.4 million households and has 300,000 copies at warehouses. It has the third-highest magazine circulation in the United States, behind two AARP magazines.

The magazine was established in 1987 as a newsprint publication and converted to a magazine in 1997. It features articles which regularly tie into the corporation along with business, celebrity features, cooking, entertaining, health, home improvement, and social articles, as well as coupons and ads. MediaPost reports: &quot;While about 90% of the magazine&#x27;s advertising is co-op, increasingly national advertisers such as Procter &amp; Gamble are buying space, notes Roeglin -- presumably because of the pub&#x27;s gargantuan reach and the data it has on its subscribers (whose average household income is $156,000 a year). &#x27;We see about 56% of our subscribers a month buy something at one of our stores based on something they&#x27;ve read in the magazine,&#x27; says Roeglin.&quot;

==Services==

===Concierge service===
Costco offers a free &quot;concierge&quot; service to members who purchase electronics, to help answer questions regarding setup and use and avoid potential returns due to not understanding how to use the products.

===Costco Auto and Home Insurance===
Costco has an agreement with CONNECT, powered by American Family Insurance, for auto insurance, home insurance and umbrella insurance.

===Costco Optical===
Costco Optical ranks as the fifth-largest optical company in the US, . Optometrists working at Costco locations will see patients without Costco memberships, although a membership is required to fill a prescription at the optical department.

===Costco Travel===
Costco Travel is a wholly owned subsidiary of Costco Wholesale and offers leisure travel to Costco members of the United States and Canada.

The program offers vacation packages to the Caribbean, Europe, Florida, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Mexico, and the South Pacific.

===Food service===
In 1985, Costco started to sell freshly prepared food through a hot dog cart at its original Seattle warehouse. Most Costco locations now have a food court. They can be indoors or outdoors, but the menu is essentially the same: hot dog with drink (one of the most popular items), pizza, frozen yogurt/ice cream, Pepsico beverages, baked items, and sandwiches. Costco offers its signature quarter-pound 100% beef hot dog and drink (with refills) for , the same price since 1985. Some US locations also offer Polish sausage or bratwurst in addition to hot dogs, at the same $1.50 price.

The hot dog sausages were kosher and supplied by Hebrew National and Sinai Kosher until 2009, when supply issues and low profit margins led Costco to start producing them in-house under the Kirkland Signature label to maintain the $1.50 price. In Australia and New Zealand, the hot dog is made of pork and is sold with a large soda for $1.99 (AUD/NZD). In Canada, the price for a hot dog and soda with refills is C$1.50. In Mexico, the hot dog is made of 100% beef and includes a drink (with refills) for MXN$35. In the UK, the hot dog is also made from beef and customers also get a drink (with refills) for £1.50. Costco sold more than 137million quarter-pound (113 g) hot dogs in its food courts in 2017. In Taiwan and Japan, the hot dog is made of pork as well. Japan&#x27;s price for their 120-gram (4½ oz.) hot dog and refillable 600-ml (20 fl. oz.) drink is ¥180.

In a July 2024 interview, CEO Ron Vachris reiterated Costco&#x27;s commitment to the price point for the hot dog combo and promised that the price would not rise on his watch.

As of April 2024, cheese or pepperoni pizza (along with pre-ordering of full pizzas to take home), chicken bakes, ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, or twist), ice cream sundae, fruit smoothies, latte freeze (without chocolate), mocha freeze (with chocolate), and chocolate chunk cookies (replacement of twisted churros) are offered at all United States locations. Some food court items are only available in certain countries. For example, the bulgogi bake and mango boba tea are only available in Australia, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan; poutine is available in Canada and France. There are, however, temporary menu items available exclusively in several countries, like the pastor taco-topped pizzas in Mexico.

Due to slow sales, in 2009, the pretzel was replaced by the churro. In April 2013, Pepsi replaced all Coca-Cola fountain drinks at US locations because Coke had raised its prices; this helped keep the hot dog combo with soda at its original price; however, in late 2024, it was reported that Costco would be reverting to Coca-Cola products in early 2025.

Costco started selling a cheeseburger with a patty at select stores across Western Washington and Southern California in mid-2017 as a test item, with comparisons drawn to those of Shake Shack. The cheeseburger was not successful; its availability only spread to around a dozen locations before it was discontinued in 2020.

Diced onion was discontinued in March 2020 but returned as a topping in May 2023.

===Costco credit card===

On April 1, 2016, in the US, Citigroup became the exclusive issuer of Costco&#x27;s branded credit cards. Prior to that, Costco credit cards had been issued by American Express since 2001, and Costco accepted &quot;only&quot; American Express cards for credit transactions. After the switch of its co-branded cards to Citi, Costco ceased accepting AmEx and began exclusively accepting Visa. AmEx cited the reason for the split that Costco was asking for lower transaction fees than AmEx was willing to grant. In Canada, Costco ended its AmEx relationship in 2014, and starting in 2015, it partnered with Capital One Mastercard for branded credit cards. In 2020, Capital One announced it would be ending the partnership in late 2021. It was announced that beginning in March 2022, Costco will begin a partnership with CIBC Mastercard. Costco branded credit cards from both issuers also serve as alternate Costco membership cards, with a customized reverse side containing membership info.

=== Costco Audiobook App ===
In March 2021, Costco started selling audiobooks and launched a corresponding iOS and Android app to listen to purchases. The app is free; however, the books are exclusive to Costco members. The retailer sells audiobooks in bundles grouped by genre or author, with prices ranging from $5 to $50. Audiobooks are currently only available at US locations.

==Labor relations==

=== Employee rights ===

While some former Price Club locations in California and the northeastern United States are staffed by Teamsters, the majority of Costco locations are not unionized, although there was a drive in 2012 to unionize some locations in Canada. The Teamsters claim that over 15,000 Costco employees are union members. The non-union locations have revisions to their Costco Employee Agreement every three years concurrent with union contract ratifications in locations with collective bargaining agreements. The Employee Agreement sets forth such things as benefits, wages, disciplinary procedures, paid holidays, bonuses, and seniority. The Employee Agreement is subject to change by Costco at any time and offers no absolute protection to the workers. As of June 2022, non-supervisory hourly wages ranged from $17.50 to $28.45 in the US, $16.00 to $28.70 in Canada, and £9.75 to £13.90 in the United Kingdom. In the US , eighty-fivepercent of Costco&#x27;s workers had health insurance, compared with less than fifty percent at Walmart and Target. Health benefits include coverage through Aetna, remote primary care through Teladoc, second opinions and clinical navigation by Grand Rounds, varieties of health insurance agencies with Custom Benefit Consultants Inc. (CBC), and wellness coaching by Omada.

In February 2021, Costco announced that it would be raising the starting rate for its hourly store workers in the United States to $16 an hour. Costco has been actively raising their minimum wage starting with $14 during 2018, and into $15 during 2019. They further add that 20% of their hourly employees will be subject to the minimum wage change.

A location in Norfolk, Virginia, unionized with the Teamsters in 2023. The vote in Norfolk was the first successful Costco union drive in over twenty years.

In January 2025, the Teamsters union representing over 18,000 Costco employees voted to strike, demanding &quot;fair wages and benefits.&quot;

=== Contractors ===
Costco contracts exclusively with two independent companies to provide employees for product demonstrations (e.g., food samples) at Costco stores: Club Demonstration Services (CDS) and Warehouse Demo Services (WDS). Demonstration employees receive a pay and benefit package that is less than that of Costco employees. , demonstrations/samples are provided by CDS in Canada. Product demonstrations at Costco stores in the United States were halted in March 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with some Costco CDS employees shifted to cleaning tasks before all were laid off when CDS temporarily ceased operations the following month; they were rehired as Costco started resuming demonstrations at select stores in June 2020, with all US stores resuming demonstrations by June 2021.

==Discontinued concepts==

===Costco Home===
The first Costco Home warehouse opened in December 2002, in Kirkland, Washington. The warehouse&#x27;s concept was to combine the value, setting and members-only elements of Costco&#x27;s warehouse clubs with the product array one would find at an upscale home store, such as Fortunoff or Crate &amp; Barrel. The Costco Home warehouses sold furniture, housewares, kitchen products and accessories from higher-end brands such as Lexington, Ralph Lauren and Waterford in a warehouse-club setting. A second warehouse opened in 2004 in Tempe, Arizona.

On April 2, 2009, the company announced that it would be abandoning its Costco Home concept, closing the two existing stores in Kirkland, Washington and Tempe, Arizona on July 3, 2009, and abandoning plans for a third warehouse in Portland, Oregon. An appliance and furniture warehouse opened in Anchorage, Alaska, in 2024.

===Costco Fresh===

A grocery-centered format, named Costco Fresh, was announced in September 1999 for a two-story space in Manhattan, New York City. The company pulled out of an agreement to build the Manhattan store later that year after cost increases and local protests. The concept was revived in late 2002 for a store in Bellevue, Washington, near its Issaquah headquarters, at a former Kmart. The new store would primarily sell fresh produce, meats, seafood, and baked goods instead of bulk items, but would also have several features from normal Costco warehouses; it would also have a modified logo, with a fruit stem growing from the first &quot;o&quot; in the Costco name. The concept was dropped the following year, but the company retained interest in building a normal Costco store at the Bellevue site until 2008, when they abandoned the plans due to zoning regulations that would have required daylighting an underground creek.

==Controversies==
In 2010, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at Buckeye Veal Farm, a veal supplier to Costco. Immediately following the investigative release, Costco adopted a policy against purchasing veal from producers that use the crate-and-chain production method. The case prompted Ohio lawmakers to vote in favor of a veal crate phase-out in the state.

In 2012, Mercy for Animals conducted another undercover investigation of a pork supplier to major retailers such as Costco, Walmart, Safeway, Kroger, and Kmart. Before the public release of the investigation, Costco announced they would begin requiring their pork suppliers to phase out gestation crates.

In 2014, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Costco is a client of Charoen Pokphand Foods. Over six months, &quot;The Guardian&quot; traced down a supply chain from slave ships in Asian waters to leading producers and retailers. Costco has published a statement saying it has had a supplier code of conduct since 1999 which does not allow this practice, and that independent auditors check for violations regularly.

In 2014, the US Department of Justice and the United States Environmental Protection Agency said that Costco had failed to promptly repair leaks from its refrigeration equipment of the refrigerant chlorodifluoromethane at its stores. Costco paid a fine of $US335,000 and agreed to spend $US2 million over three years to fix refrigerant leaks and make improvements at 274 stores.

In 2015, the Humane Society of the United States conducted an undercover investigation at an egg supplier to Costco. An undercover worker at Hillandale Farms, a major egg supplier to Costco, filmed conditions in which egg-laying hens lived in tiny wire cages. Following the investigations, several celebrities including Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling publicly wrote to Costco to address this issue. Following efforts by animal protection nonprofits including The Humane League, Costco released an updated commitment to source exclusively cage-free eggs in its operations.

In July 2015, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission recalled the EKO Sensible Eco Living Trash Can that Costco was selling due to a black plastic protective collar in the opening on the back of the trash can that could be dislodged and expose a sharp edge. Costco was fined US$3.85 million for receiving 92 complaints about the trash can, including 60 complaints from those that sustained injuries, but did not notify the commission about the defect.

In 2016, a follow-up to Costco&#x27;s shift to cage-free eggs by animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) reported cannibalism and high mortality at a cage-free Costco egg supplier. Costco denied the allegations, but the video sparked a discussion about animal welfare problems continuing to exist at cage-free egg farms. Writing in &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, DxE co-founder Wayne Hsiung argued that the new investigation, rather than suggesting that Costco should keep birds in cages, indicated that hens should have the right not to be raised for food or kept on farms at all.

In September 2016, Costco self-disclosed conduct to the Office of Inspector General after its pharmacy in Waltham, Massachusetts improperly altered prescription drug claims to Medicare Part D and the Massachusetts Medicaid program that resulted in higher reimbursement than was appropriate. They paid a fine of US$340,157.25.

In January 2017, Costco was brought to court in the US for lax pharmacy controls in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. Allegations such as Costco &quot;filling prescriptions that were incomplete&quot;, or were for substances &quot;beyond various doctors&#x27; scope of practice&quot;. The case was settled after Costco paid .

In 2017, Costco and Acushnet Holdings sued each other over their golf balls.

In August 2017, a federal judge ordered a &quot;deceptive&quot; Costco to pay Tiffany &amp; Co. US$19.4million for misleading consumers into thinking they could buy legitimate Tiffany merchandise at warehouse club prices.

Costco was criticized in 2019 by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and SumOfUs for using virgin Canadian boreal forest to make its toilet paper. NRDC says that over the previous twenty years, 28 million acres of Canadian boreal forest had been cut down to make toilet paper.

In 2019, the Ontario Ministry of Health fined Costco $CA7.2 million after it found that Costco pharmacies were accepting advertising services from a generic drug manufacturer in Ontario, where it is illegal for a pharmacy to accept rebates, or kickbacks, from a generic drug manufacturer in exchange for promising to stock its brand of drugs. Two Costco pharmacy directors were referred to the Ontario College of Pharmacists and were fined for the misconduct.

In September 2020, CBS News reported that Costco has stopped selling Palmetto Cheese after the owner of the pimento cheese brand called Black Lives Matter a &quot;terror organization.&quot; Costco posted a note to the item in their Myrtle Beach location indicating that the item will not be reordered, and over 120 Costco&#x27;s throughout the US will no longer be carrying the item.

In October 2020, Costco dropped Chaokoh coconut milk over the allegations of forced monkey labor. PETA accused the manufacturer, Theppadungporn Coconut Co., of using forced monkey labor, finding cruelty to monkeys at their farms and facilities. Ken Kimble, Costco&#x27;s Vice President of Corporate Food and Sundries, stated Costco has launched an investigation regarding the issue and have ceased purchasing from the supplier/owner of the brand Chaokoh condemning the use of monkey labor. Kimble also stated that Costco will continue to monitor the implementation of the harvest policies and once satisfied will resume purchasing.

In December 2020, Costco announced plans to end the use of eggs from caged chickens throughout its operations worldwide. It became the first US retailer to issue a global policy on the confinement of animals in its supply chain. Josh Dahmen, Costco financial planning and investor relations director also said: &quot;We are in the process of making that transition to cage-free eggs. We will continue to increase the percentage over time, with a goal of eventually getting to 100%.&quot;

In 2023, the Kaohsiung Department of Health fined Costco numerous times for selling bags of mixed berries imported into Taiwan, that tested positive for Hepatitis A. Costco was fined a total of NT12.5 million and was temporarily barred from selling mixed berries in the country.

In June 2023, an employee named Kim Dong Ho in Hanam, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea who was assigned to organize shopping carts, died of heatstroke while at work. South Korean government guidelines state that outdoor workers be given a 10 to 15-minute break every hour during heatwave advisories; however, these guidelines were not strictly followed or enforced at the Costco store where Kim worked and he was given 15-minute breaks every 3 hours without a regular supply of drinking water. The company was later fined 30 million won by the Ministry of Employment and Labor.

In July 2023, Costco Australia paid $33,000 in penalties for mislabelling the origin of lobster products after importing lobsters from Canada, but labeling them as &quot;&quot;Kirkland Signature PREVIOUSLY FROZEN WHOLE COOKED WA LOBSTER&quot; and &quot;Australian Lobster&quot;.&quot;

In August 2023, the Environment Agency of Iceland fined Costco ISK 20 million for a diesel spill originating from a gas station in Garðabær, which contaminated the Hafnarfjörður sewage system.

<doc id="446058" wikidata="Q38873" url="?curid=446058" title="Lou Andreas-Salomé">
<text>Lou Andreas-Salomé (born either Louise von Salomé or Luíza Gustavovna Salomé or Lioulia von Salomé, ; 12 February 1861 – 5 February 1937) was a Russian-born psychoanalyst and a well-traveled author, narrator, and essayist from a French Huguenot-German family. Her diverse intellectual interests led to friendships with a broad array of distinguished thinkers, including Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Paul Rée, and Rainer Maria Rilke.

==Life==
===Early years===
Lou Salomé was born in St. Petersburg to Gustav Ludwig von Salomé (1807–1878), and Louise von Salomé (née Wilm) (1823–1913). Lou was their only daughter; they had five sons. Although she would later be attacked by the Nazis as a &quot;Finnish Jew&quot;, her parents were actually of French Huguenot and Northern German descent. The youngest of six children, she grew up in a wealthy and well-cultured household, with all children learning Russian, German, and French; Salomé was allowed to attend her brothers&#x27; classes.

Born into a strictly Protestant family, Salomé grew to resent the Reformed church and Hermann Dalton, the Orthodox Protestant pastor. She refused to be confirmed by Dalton, officially left the church at age 16, but remained interested in intellectual pursuits in the areas of philosophy, literature and religion.

In fact, she was fascinated by the sermons of the Dutch pastor Hendrik Gillot, known in St. Petersburg as an opponent of Dalton&#x27;s. Gillot, 25 years her senior, took her on as a student, engaging with her in the fields of theology, philosophy, world religions, and French and German literature. Together they studied innumerable authors, philosophers, theological and religious subjects, and all of this wide-ranging study laid the groundwork for her intellectual encounters with very well-known thinkers of her time. Gillot became so smitten with Salomé that he wanted to divorce his wife and marry his young student. Salomé refused, for she was not interested in marriage and sexual relations. Though disappointed and shocked by this development, she remained friends with Gillot.

Following her father&#x27;s death in 1879, Salomé and her mother went to Zürich so Salomé could acquire a university education as a &quot;guest student.&quot; In her one year at the University of Zurich—one of the few schools that accepted female students—Salomé attended lectures in philosophy (logic, history of philosophy, ancient philosophy, and psychology) and theology (dogmatics). During this time, Salomé&#x27;s physical health was failing due to lung disease, causing her to cough up blood. Due to this, she was instructed to heal in warmer climates, so in February 1882, Salomé and her mother went to Rome.

===Rée and Nietzsche, and later life===
Salomé&#x27;s mother took her to Rome when Salomé was 21. At a literary salon in the city, Salomé became acquainted with the author Paul Rée. Rée proposed to her, but she instead suggested that they live and study together as &#x27;brother and sister&#x27; along with another man for company, and thereby establish an academic commune. Rée accepted the idea, and suggested that they be joined by his friend Friedrich Nietzsche. The two met Nietzsche in Rome in April 1882, and Nietzsche is believed to have instantly fallen in love with Salomé, as Rée had earlier done. Nietzsche asked Rée to propose marriage to Salomé on his behalf, which she rejected, although interested in Nietzsche as a friend. Nietzsche nonetheless was content to join Rée and Salomé touring through Switzerland and Italy together, planning their commune. On 13 May, in Lucerne, when Nietzsche was alone with Salomé, he earnestly proposed marriage to her again, and she again rejected him. He was happy to continue with the plans for an academic commune. After discovering the situation, Nietzsche&#x27;s sister Elisabeth became determined to separate him from Salomé whom she described as an &quot;immoral woman&quot;. Nietzsche, Rée, and Salomé travelled with Salomé&#x27;s mother through Italy and considered where they would set up their &quot;Winterplan&quot; commune. This commune was intended to be set up in an abandoned monastery, but as no suitable location was found, the plan was abandoned.

After arriving in Leipzig in October 1882, the three spent a number of weeks together. However, the following month Rée and Salomé parted company with Nietzsche, leaving for Stibbe without any plans to meet again. Nietzsche soon fell into a period of mental anguish, although he continued to write to Rée, asking him, &quot;We shall see one another from time to time, won&#x27;t we?&quot; In later recriminations, Nietzsche would blame the failure in his attempts to woo Salomé both on Salomé, Rée, and on the intrigues of his sister (who had written letters to the families of Salomé and Rée to disrupt their plans for the commune). Nietzsche wrote of the affair in 1883 that he felt &quot;genuine hatred for [his] sister.&quot;

Salomé would later (1894) write a study, &quot;Friedrich Nietzsche in seinen Werken&quot; (&quot;Friedrich Nietzsche in his Works&quot;), of Nietzsche&#x27;s personality and philosophy.

In 1884 Salomé became acquainted with Helene von Druskowitz, the second woman to receive a philosophy doctorate in Zurich. It was also rumoured that Salomé later had a romantic relationship with Sigmund Freud.

=== Marriage and relationships ===

Salomé and Rée moved to Berlin and lived together until a few years before her celibate marriage to linguistics scholar Friedrich Carl Andreas. Despite her opposition to marriage and her open relationships with other men, Salomé and Andreas remained married from 1887 until his death in 1930.

Salomé&#x27;s co-habitation with Andreas caused the despairing Rée to fade from Salomé&#x27;s life despite her assurances. Throughout her married life, she engaged in affairs and/or correspondence with the German journalist and politician Georg Ledebour, the Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke, about whom she wrote an analytical memoir, and the psychoanalysts Sigmund Freud (whom she met personally in September 1911, on occasion of the 3rd Congress of Psychoanalysis held in Weimar) and Victor Tausk, among others. Accounts of many of these are given in her volume &quot;Lebensrückblick&quot;. An affair with the Viennese physician Friedrich Pineles ended in an abortion and a tragic renunciation of motherhood. Her relationship with Freud was still quite intellectual despite gossip about their romantic involvement. In one letter Freud commends Salomé&#x27;s deep understanding of people so much that he believed she understood people better than they understood themselves. The two often exchanged letters. Salomé was romantically involved with the handsome and melancholic Victor Tausk, member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, 18 years her junior.

According to Anna Freud, her work &quot;Friedrich Nietzsche in seinen Werken &quot; (Friedrich Nietzsche in his works) anticipated the psychoanalysis. It was the first book about the German philosopher. Anna Freud and von Salomé, who met in Vienna, had a long-time correspondence, like Sigmund Freud and von Salomé.

=== Meeting Rilke ===
In May 1897, in Munich, she met Rilke, who had been introduced to her by Jacob Wassermann. She was 36 while Rilke was only 20. She had already published with some success &quot;Im Kampf um Gott&quot; &quot;where she exposed the problem of loss of faith (which had been her own for a long time)&quot;, several articles, and the study &quot;Jesus der Jude&quot; that Rilke had read.

As Philippe Jaccottet reports, Salomé wrote in &quot;Lebensrückblick&quot;: &quot;I was your wife for years because you were the first reality, where man and body are indistinguishable from each other, an indisputable fact of life itself. I could have said literally what you told me when you confessed your love to me: Only you are real. That is how we became husband and wife even before we became friends, not by choice, but by this unfathomable marriage [...] We were brother and sister, but as in a distant past, before the marriage between brother and sister became sacrilegious.&quot;

In 1899 with her husband Friedrich-Carl, then again in 1900, Lou travelled to Russia, the second time with Rilke, whose first name she changed from René to Rainer. She taught him Russian, to read Tolstoy (whom he would later meet) and Pushkin. She introduced him to patrons and other people in the arts, remaining Rilke&#x27;s advisor, confidante, and muse throughout his adult life. The romance between the poet and Salomé lasted three years, then turned into a friendship, which would continue until Rilke&#x27;s death, as evidenced by their correspondence. In 1937, Freud said of Salomé&#x27;s relationship with Rilke: &quot;She was both the muse and the attentive mother of the great poet.&quot;

===Death===
By 1930, Salomé was increasingly weak, suffered from a heart condition and diabetes, and had to be treated several times in the hospital. Her husband visited her daily during a six-week stay after a foot operation, which was arduous for the old, rather ill man, and this made them grow very close after a forty-year marriage marked by hurtful behaviour on both sides and long periods of non-communication. Freud appreciated this from afar, writing: &quot;Only what is genuinely true proves itself so long-lasting.&quot; (&quot;&quot;) Friedrich Carl Andreas died of cancer in 1930, and Salomé herself underwent a difficult cancer operation in 1935. At the age of 74, she ceased to work as a psychoanalyst.

Salomé died of uremia in Göttingen on 5 February 1937. Her urn was laid to rest in her husband&#x27;s grave in the cemetery on the Groner Landstraße in Göttingen. She is commemorated in the city by a memorial plaque outside the property where her house stood, a street named after her (Lou-Andreas-Salomé-Weg), and the name of the Lou Andreas-Salomé Institut für Psychoanalyse und Psychotherapie. A few days before her death, the Gestapo confiscated her library (according to other sources it was an SA group who destroyed the library shortly after her death). The reasons given for this confiscation were that she had been a colleague of Sigmund Freud, had practised &quot;a Jewish science&quot;, and owned many books by Jewish authors.

==Work==
Salomé was a prolific writer who wrote fiction, criticism and essays on religion, philosophy, sexuality and psychology. A uniform edition of her works is being published in Germany by MedienEdition Welsch. She authored a &quot;Hymn to Life&quot; that so deeply impressed Nietzsche that he was moved to set it to music. Salomé&#x27;s literary and analytical studies became such a vogue in Göttingen, where she lived late in her life, that the Gestapo waited until shortly after her death to &quot;clean&quot; her library of works by Jews.

She was one of the first female psychoanalysts and one of the first women to write psychoanalytically on female sexuality, before Helene Deutsch, for instance in her essay on the anal-erotic (1916), an essay admired by Freud. However, she had written about the psychology of female sexuality before she ever met Freud, in her book &quot;Die Erotik&quot; (1911).

She wrote more than a dozen novels and novellas, including &quot;Im Kampf um Gott&quot;, &quot;Ruth&quot;, &quot;Rodinka&quot;, &quot;Ma&quot;, &quot;Fenitschka – eine Ausschweifung&quot;, as well as non-fiction studies such as &quot;Henrik Ibsens Frauengestalten&quot; (1892), a study of Ibsen&#x27;s female characters, and a book on Nietzsche, &quot;Friedrich Nietzsche in seinen Werken&quot; (1894). The first English translation of her novel &quot;Das Haus&quot; (1921) appeared in 2021 under the title &quot;Anneliese&#x27;s House&quot;, in an annotated edition by Frank Beck and Raleigh Whitinger.

Salomé edited a memoir about Rilke after his death in 1926. Among her works is also her &quot;Lebensrückblick&quot;, which she wrote during her last years based on memories of her life as a free woman. In her memoirs, first published in their original German in 1951, she goes into depth about her faith and her relationships.

Salomé is said to have remarked in her last days, &quot;I have really done nothing but work all my life, work ... why?&quot; And in her last hours, as if talking to herself, she is reported to have said, &quot;If I let my thoughts roam I find no one. The best, after all, is death.&quot;

==In fiction and film==
Fictional accounts of Salomé&#x27;s relationship with Nietzsche occur in four novels: Irvin Yalom&#x27;s &quot;When Nietzsche Wept&quot;, Lance Olsen&#x27;s &quot;Nietzsche&#x27;s Kisses&quot;, Beatriz Rivas&#x27;s &quot;La hora sin diosas&quot; (&quot;The time without goddesses&quot;), and William Bayer&#x27;s &quot;The Luzern Photograph&quot;, in which two reenactments of the famous image of her with Nietzsche and Rée impact a murder in contemporary Oakland, California.

Mexican playwright Sabina Berman includes Lou Andreas-Salomé as a character in her 2000 play &quot;Feliz nuevo siglo, Doktor Freud (Freud Skating)&quot;.
