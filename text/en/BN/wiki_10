<text>The Ostreidae, the true oysters, include most species of molluscs commonly consumed as oysters. Pearl oysters are not true oysters, and belong to the order Pteriida.

Like scallops, true oysters have a central adductor muscle, which means the shell has a characteristic central scar marking its point of attachment. The shell tends to be irregular as a result of attaching to a substrate.

Both oviparous (egg-bearing) and larviparous (larvae-bearing) species are known within Ostreidae. Both types are hermaphrodites. However, the larviparous species show a pattern of alternating sex within each individual, whereas the oviparous species are simultaneous hermaphrodites, producing either female or male gametes according to circumstances.

Members of genus &quot;Ostrea&quot; generally live continually immersed and are quite flat, with roundish shells. They differ from most bivalves by having shells completely made up of calcite, but with internal muscle scars of aragonitic composition. They fare best in somewhat oligotrophic water. They brood their fertilized eggs for various proportions of the period from fertilization to hatching.

Members of genera &quot;Saccostrea&quot;, &quot;Magallana&quot;, and &quot;Crassostrea&quot; generally live in the intertidal zone, broadcast sperm and eggs into the sea, and can thrive in eutrophic water. One of the most commonly cultivated oysters is the Pacific oyster, which is ideally suited for cultivation in seawater ponds.

<text>Ian Colin Lucas (born 18 September 1960) is a British Labour Party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Wrexham, Wales from 2001 to 2019. He was Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Business and Regulatory Reform in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills from 2009 until Labour&#x27;s defeat at the 2010 General Election.

He did not stand at the 2019 election.

==Early life==
He was born and brought up in a council house in Gateshead, the second son of Colin and Alice Lucas. His father worked as a process engineer in a local factory, apart from serving in the army from 1942 to 1947 during the Second World War. He attended Greenwell Junior High School on &quot;Beacon Lough Road &quot; in Gateshead then Newcastle Royal Grammar School, and won a place at New College, Oxford University, to study jurisprudence gaining a BA in 1982. He qualified from the College of Law in 1983 and was admitted as a solicitor in 1985.

He supports Sunderland A.F.C. in football.

==Professional career==
He became a solicitor practising in London from 1983–6, but moved to Wrexham in 1986, specialising in criminal and personal injury law for Percy Hughes and Roberts in Chester until 1987. He worked for Lees Moore and Price in Birkenhead until 1989. He then worked for Roberts Moore Nicholas Jones until 1992 in Wrexham.

In 1992, he moved the short distance to Oswestry in Shropshire working for Dr Crawford, and formed his own practice, Crawford Lucas in 1997. The move was precipitated because of disagreements with his old firm when he had organised protests against cuts in legal aid. He was a partner in Stevens Lucas from 2000–1. After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, Ian Lucas represented Trevor Rees-Jones (Diana&#x27;s bodyguard, and survivor of the crash) in a legal battle with Mohamed Fayed.

==Political career==
In 1986 he joined the Labour Party, and became chairman of the Wrexham branch. He was on Gresford Community Council in Wrexham from 1987 to 1991. He contested the traditionally conservative seat of North Shropshire in the 1997 general election, but was narrowly defeated. He has served as a school governor, and on a local hospital board.

He was later selected to stand for the UK Parliament in Wrexham, and won the seat in 2001.

He was Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Bill Rammell MP, Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education. He resigned as PPS on 6 September 2006, due to the refusal by Tony Blair to name a date for stepping down as Prime Minister. Fellow Welsh Labour MPs Wayne David and Mark Tami resigned on the same day.

Lucas was promoted by Gordon Brown in the reshuffle of October 2008, to the role of assistant government whip. He then entered Government as a minister for the first time in the June 2009 reshuffle, becoming Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Business and Regulatory Reform in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and held that post until the Labour government left office in May 2010. He was the shadow minister for the Middle East and Africa.

He has served as a member of the Environmental Audit Select Committee and the Transport Select Committee.

He has taken an interest in sustainable energy, devolution of powers in Wales, and links with Germany. He is a member of both the Labour Friends of Israel and the Labour Friends of Palestine &amp; the Middle East.

Despite his constituency voting to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum, Lucas supported a second referendum on the UK&#x27;s EU membership. He would support remaining in the European Union in the event of such a vote.

He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election.

Lucas did not stand for re-election at the 2019 general election.

== Parliamentary debate about the murder of Nicolas Churton ==
On the 11 April 2019, in a House of Commons adjournment debate he accused North Wales police, the probation service, the community rehabilitation company, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, and the Independent Office for Police Conduct of hiding mistakes about incidents that led to the murder of Nicolas Churton. He further alleged that Mark Polin, the Chief Constable for North Wales Police had misled him over it.

<doc id="428663" wikidata="Q2057532" url="?curid=428663" title="Hank Pym">
<text>Dr. Henry Jonathan Pym is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by penciller Jack Kirby, editor-plotter Stan Lee and writer Larry Lieber, Pym debuted in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #27 (January 1962). He returned several issues later as the original iteration of Ant-Man, a superhero with the power to shrink to the size of an ant. He later assumed other superhero identities, including the size-changing Giant-Man and Goliath; the insect-themed Yellowjacket; and briefly, the Wasp. He is a founding member of the Avengers superhero team, and the creator of the robotic villain Ultron. He is also the ex-husband of Janet van Dyne and the father of Nadia van Dyne, his daughter by his first wife, Maria Pym.

Since his earliest appearances in the Silver Age of Comic Books, Pym has been featured in various Marvel-endorsed products including animated films, video games, television series, and feature films. Michael Douglas plays Pym in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films &quot;Ant-Man&quot; (2015), &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp&quot; (2018), &quot;&quot; (2019), and &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot; (2023). Douglas also voiced alternate-timeline versions of Pym in the Disney+ animated series &quot;What If...?&quot; (2021–2023).

==Publication history==

Hank Pym debuted in a seven-page solo cover story, &quot;The Man in the Ant Hill&quot;, about a character who tests ing technology on himself, in the science fiction/fantasy anthology &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #27 (cover date January 1962). The story was created by editor-plotter Stan Lee, writer Larry Lieber, penciller Jack Kirby, and inker Dick Ayers. In a 2008 interview, Lee said: &quot;I did one comic book called &#x27;The Man in the Ant Hill&#x27; about a guy who shrunk down and there were ants or bees chasing him. That sold so well that I thought making him into a superhero might be fun.&quot;

As a result, Pym was revived eight issues later as the costumed superhero Ant-Man who starred in the 13-page, the three-chapter story &quot;Return of the Ant-Man/An Army of Ants/The Ant-Man&#x27;s Revenge&quot; in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #35 (September 1962). His adventures became an ongoing feature in the title. Issue #44 (June 1963) featured the debut of his socialite girlfriend and lab assistant Janet van Dyne, who adopted the costumed identity of the Wasp. She co-starred in Pym&#x27;s subsequent appearances, and was a framing-sequence host for backup stories in the series. In September 1963, Lee and Kirby created the superhero title &quot;The Avengers&quot;, and Ant-Man and Wasp were established in issue #1 as founding members of the eponymous team.

Decades later, Lee theorized as to why &quot;Ant-Man never became one of our top sellers or had his own book&quot;:

Pym began a continuous shift of superhero identities in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;, first becoming the Giant-Man in issue #49 (November 1963). Pym and van Dyne continued to costar in the title until issue #69 (July 1965), while simultaneously appearing in &quot;The Avengers&quot; until issue #15 (April 1965), after which they temporarily left the team.

Next Pym rejoined the Avengers and adopted the new identity Goliath in &quot;Avengers&quot; #28 (May 1966). Gradually falling to mental strain, he adopted the fourth superhero identity Yellowjacket in issue #59 (December 1968). He reappeared as Ant-Man in &quot;Avengers&quot; #93 (November 1971); and for issues #4–10 starred in the lead story of the first volume of &quot;Marvel Feature&quot; (July 1972July 1973). During this run, he appeared in a redesigned costume with a nail as a weapon. After appearing occasionally as Yellowjacket in the 1980s and battling mental and emotional issues, he temporarily abandoned costumed personas altogether, joining the West Coast Avengers as a scientist and inventor in &quot;West Coast Avengers&quot; vol. 2, #21 (June 1987). Writer Steve Englehart explained, &quot;I&#x27;ve been using him as he asked to be used. In the Egghead story, where he bombed out as Yellowjacket, he said that he would never be a superhero again, so I took him at his word.&quot;

Pym returned to the Avengers as Giant-Man in &quot;The Avengers&quot; vol. 3, #1 (February 1998). When the team disbanded after a series of tragedies, Pym, as Yellowjacket, took a leave of absence beginning with vol. 3, #85 (September 2004).

Following van Dyne&#x27;s death, a grieving Pym took on yet another identity as a new iteration of Wasp, in tribute to the woman he had married and divorced, in the one-shot publication &quot;Secret Invasion: Requiem&quot; (January 2009). Giant-Man appeared as a supporting character in &quot;Avengers Academy&quot; from issue #1 (August 2010) through its final issue #39 (January 2013). Pym returned as the Wasp in the mini-series &quot;Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp&quot; (January 2011) and as a regular character in the 2010-2013 &quot;Secret Avengers&quot; series from issue #22 (April 2012) through its final issue #37 (March 2013).

After &quot;Secret Avengers&quot;, Pym joined the &quot;Avengers A.I.&quot; after beating his creation Ultron. He then appeared in many comics including &quot;Daredevil&quot; (Vol. 3 and 4) and the graphic novel &quot;Rage of Ultron&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
=== 1960s ===
Biochemist Dr. Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Pym discovers an unusual set of subatomic particles he labels &quot;Pym particles&quot;. Entrapping them within two separate serums, he creates a size-altering formula and a reversal formula, testing them on himself. Reduced to the size of an insect, he becomes trapped in an anthill before he eventually escapes and uses the reversal formula to return to normal size. Deciding the serums are too dangerous, he destroys them. He later reconsiders his decision and recreates his serums. Pym&#x27;s experience in the anthill inspires him to study ants, and he builds a cybernetic helmet that lets him communicate with and control them. He designs a costume made of unstable molecules to prevent bites or scratches from the ants and reinvents himself as the superhero Ant-Man.

After several adventures, Pym is contacted by Dr. Vernon van Dyne, who asks for his help contacting alien life. Pym refuses, but is attracted to Vernon&#x27;s socialite daughter Janet van Dyne. When Vernon is killed by an alien criminal who teleports to Earth, Janet asks for Pym&#x27;s help avenging his death. Pym reveals his secret identity to Janet and uses Pym particles to graft wasp wings beneath her shoulders, which appear when Janet shrinks. She assumes the alias of the Wasp, and together they find and defeat Vernon&#x27;s killer. They become founding members of the superhero team the Avengers.

Pym eventually adopts his first alternate identity as the 12-foot-tall Giant-Man. (Three decades later, a flashback shows him adopting the identity out of feelings of inadequacy when compared to powerful teammates Iron Man and Thor.) Pym and the Wasp begin a romantic relationship, and soon take a leave of absence from the Avengers.

Returning to the Avengers, Pym adopts a new superhero identity, Goliath. A mishap traps him in giant form for several issues and affects his self-esteem. After recovering his size-shifting powers, he creates the robot Ultron that unexpectedly achieves sentience and becomes one of the Avengers&#x27;s greatest foes. During a botched experiment, Pym inhales chemicals that affect his mind, and he reappears at Avengers Mansion in the cocky new persona of Yellowjacket, claiming to have disposed of Pym. The Wasp secretly realizes he is Pym, however, and accepts his offer of marriage. At their wedding, a battle with the Circus of Crime erupts; in the ensuing conflict, the chemicals lose their effect on him and his identity is restored.

=== 1970s ===

After several adventures with the Avengers, including another encounter with Ultron, the pair take another leave of absence. The heroes re-encounter Hank Pym at the beginning of the Kree-Skrull War, and once again as the Ant-Man persona and has a series of solo adventures.

After aiding fellow superhero team known as the Defenders as Yellowjacket, Pym returns to the Avengers. He is eventually captured by an upgraded Ultron that brainwashes his creator, causing the character to regress to his original Ant-Man costume and personality — arriving at Avengers Mansion, thinking it to be the very first meeting of the team. Seeing several unfamiliar members, Pym attacks the team until stopped by the Wasp. After Ultron&#x27;s brainwashing is reversed, Pym rejoins the Avengers as Yellowjacket. Pym is forced to briefly leave the team when the roster is restructured by government liaison Henry Peter Gyrich.

Also at this time, he noticed Scott Lang&#x27;s theft of the Ant-Man suit. After Darren Cross&#x27;s defeat and aware of Lang&#x27;s use of the stolen goods, Pym let Lang keep the equipment, albeit only to uphold the law.

=== 1980s ===

Returning 14 issues later, Hank Pym participates in several missions until, after demonstrating hostile behavior toward Janet van Dyne, he attacks a foe from behind once the opponent had ceased fighting. Captain America suspends Yellowjacket from Avengers duty pending the verdict of a court-martial.

Pym suffers a mental breakdown and concocts a plan to salvage his credibility. He plans to build a robot and program it to launch an attack on the Avengers; Pym will then counter the false flag attack at a critical moment using his knowledge of the robot&#x27;s weaknesses, thereby presenting himself as the other Avengers&#x27; savior. The Wasp discovers the plan and begs Pym to stop, whereupon he strikes her.

Pym is subsequently expelled from the Avengers, and Janet divorces him.

Left penniless, Pym is manipulated by an old foe, the presumed-dead Egghead, who tricks Pym into stealing the national reserve of the metal adamantium. Pym is confronted by the Avengers and blamed for the theft, as Egghead erases all evidence of his own involvement. Pym, in turn, blames Egghead, a criminal still believed dead by the other Avengers. This is taken by Pym&#x27;s former teammates as further proof of his madness, and he is incarcerated. During Pym&#x27;s imprisonment, Janet has a brief relationship with Tony Stark. Egghead later attempts to kill Pym but is himself accidentally killed by Hawkeye. With the perpetrator of the original theft now exposed, Pym is cleared of all charges. After bidding farewell to Janet and his teammates, Pym leaves to devote himself full-time to research.

Pym reappears as a member of the West Coast Avengers, first in an advisory role, then as a full member. He answers to &quot;Doctor Pym&quot; in the field, using none of the names or costumes associated with his previous superhero identities. He begins a short relationship with teammate Tigra. After being taunted by old foe Whirlwind, Pym contemplates suicide, but is stopped by Firebird. Pym and Janet eventually resume a romantic relationship.

=== 1990s ===
The character returns to the Avengers, joining the East Coast team as Giant-Man. The pair, together with many of the other Avengers, apparently sacrifice themselves to stop the villain Onslaught, but actually exist in a pocket universe for a year before returning to the mainstream Marvel Universe.

Hank Pym returns and aids the team as Giant-Man, and makes a significant contribution by defeating criminal mastermind Imus Champion and his flawed creation Ultron, simultaneously overcoming his old issues of guilt over Ultron&#x27;s crimes.

=== 2000s ===
During the Destiny War between Kang the Conqueror and Immortus, two versions of Hank Pym are drawn in: Giant-Man of the present and Yellowjacket immediately prior to his marriage to Janet van Dyne. Yellowjacket briefly betrays the team to Immortus and the powerful Time-Keepers try to create a timeline where he will not turn back into Pym, but he rejects this decision in time to help his allies. Observing the final battle, Libra—who brought the team together by using the Destiny Force to tap into his subconscious awareness of the cosmic balance—reflects that both Pyms were necessary so that Yellowjacket&#x27;s betrayal could bring the team into the right position to attack the Time-Keepers, while Pym&#x27;s presence as Giant-Man both provided a stable support and irritated Yellowjacket to provoke his own actions.

Back in the present, an encounter with Kulan Gath results in Pym being split into his two personas of Pym and Yellowjacket, after a spell cast by Gath temporarily transforms Pym into a swashbuckler-style Yellowjacket, followed by the Yellowjacket persona manifesting a physical presence from the extradimensional bio-mass Pym uses to grow. Yellowjacket&#x27;s stability deteriorates in a confrontation with Diablo. The two personalities are restored when the Wasp helps the two halves realize they need each other. Pym is eventually able to resolve his problems and adopts his Yellowjacket persona again.

After the events of the &quot;Avengers Disassembled&quot; storyline, Pym takes a leave of absence, and in the one-shot &quot;Avengers: Finale&quot;, he and Janet leave for England to rekindle their relationship.

As Yellowjacket, Pym is a central character in the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, joining those heroes that support the Superhuman Registration Act. At the conclusion of the Civil War, Pym is named &quot;Man of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine for his role in freeing several captive anti-registration heroes. Pym becomes one of the administrators at Camp Hammond, a U.S. military base in Stamford, Connecticut, for the training of registered superheroes in the government program The Initiative. Pym and Janet&#x27;s relationship fails, and Pym again begins a romantic relationship with teammate Tigra.

Following the publication of &quot;Civil War&quot;, Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline uses flashbacks to present the then-current version of the character as an impostor who replaced the real Pym at some point in the books&#x27; fictional history prior to the events of &quot;Civil War&quot;. This impostor is an extraterrestrial of the shape-shifting Skrull race participating in a covert invasion of Earth; Pym&#x27;s experiences throughout the &quot;Civil War&quot; series and related series are retold in brief from the perspective of the impostor and its allies. The impostor is exposed and defeated by the hero Crusader. After the final battle between Earth&#x27;s heroes and the Skrulls, Pym is found with other &quot;replaced&quot; heroes in a Skrull vessel. When Janet is seemingly killed in battle, Pym takes on a new superhero persona, the Wasp, in tribute to her. He rejoins the Avengers and eventually leads the team.

The cosmic entity Eternity reveals to Pym that he is Earth&#x27;s &quot;Scientist Supreme&quot;, the scientific counterpart to Earth&#x27;s Sorcerer Supreme. The Norse trickster-god Loki later claims to have been posing as Eternity to manipulate Pym.

===2010s===
Hank Pym creates Avengers Academy, a program to help train young people with newly acquired superpowers. He returns to his Giant-Man identity, and later joins the superhero team: Secret Avengers. In the &quot;Age of Ultron&quot; storyline, Pym travels through time to destroy his robot, Ultron, who had managed to conquer the world.

In another adventure, Pym and Monica Chang, A.I. Division Chief of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., assemble a new team called the Avengers A.I. A few months later, Pym, using his Yellowjacket identity, is shown as a member of the Illuminati. At one point, Pym is presumed dead and a funeral service is held in his honor. Scott Lang receives one of Pym&#x27;s labs according to the will.

Pym resurfaces in a space adventure before rejoining the Avengers on Earth, though it becomes clear that Ultron is actually controlling Hank&#x27;s body. The Avengers defeat the hybrid robot, but both Hank and Ultron survive and continue to do battle with one another internally. Later in this period, we get introduce to Hank&#x27;s daughter, Nadia, from his ex-wife Maria Trovaya. Through Nadia, we discover that Hank has bipolar disorder, which he has been monitoring on his own to predict when and how often his mood swings may occur.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Pym sets up a base in Alaska and is forced to work through some family issues and relationship strife within the Avengers team. Pym later goes on a journey to collect all the Infinity Stones. During this storyline, a piece of Hank&#x27;s soul gets stuck in an alternate realm and eventually devoured. In another storyline, Hank is portrayed as a villain in a battle against the Silver Surfer.

In &quot;The Ultron Agenda&quot; storyline, Hank attempts to merge all robots with humans. Iron Man and Machine Man interfere with his plans and Pym attempts to take revenge. At the end of this storyline, we discover that Hank&#x27;s human side has been dead since he first merged with Ultron.

===2020s===
The &quot;Ant-Man&quot; miniseries released in 2022 depicts an early Hank Pym being pulled into the future, along with Eric O&#x27;Grady and Scott Lang, in an attempt to assist the Ant-Man of the 25th century, Dr. Zayn Asghar. Ultron is ultimately defeated and the other Ant-Men are returned to the past.

Sometime later, an old man claiming to be Hank Pym places an artificial personality in Whirlwind&#x27;s corpse called &quot;Victor Shade&quot;. It was later revealed that a fragment of Hank&#x27;s conscious had separated from All-Father Ultron when he was defeated. The fragment recreated his body which appeared older and he was still paranoid from being Ultron&#x27;s &quot;meat puppet&quot;. What he did to Whirlwind was part of an experiment involving killing and reviving villains into becoming members of his Lethal Legion with help from Black Ant. To his surprise later by the time Wasp and Moon Knight find him, the &quot;Victor Shade&quot; persona ended up being hijacked by Ultron-12 by the time Wasp learned the truth on what happened to Hank as Ultron-12 knocks him out. As Wasp remembers Ultron-12 as the &quot;good Ultron&quot;, Ultron-12 stated to Wasp that he went through a soft reboot to protect Hank as Ultron takes over the Lethal Legion. Hank regained consciousness and reunited with Nadia when Ant-Man, Mayor Luke Cage, Stinger, Valkyrie, and Vision arrived as he claims to Nadia that Ultron&#x27;s no longer in him. He gives Nadia the code for the nano-tech from the future to use while Ultron is distracted as she&#x27;s got to think big which Ultron-12 agrees with him on. After Ultron was defeated and the nanos reconstructed themselves into a new body for Ultron-12, Hank states that Ultron is not gone for good as the recovering Lethal Legion agree with him on it. Hank then leaves with the Lethal Legion to Sub-Atomica to regroup and prepare for Ultron&#x27;s return as part of Protocol S.

==Powers and abilities==

Hank Pym is a scientific genius with PhDs in biochemistry and nanotechnology and expertise in the fields of quantum physics, robotics/cybernetics, artificial intelligence, and entomology. Pym discovered the subatomic &quot;Pym particles&quot; that enable mass to be shunted or gained from an alternate dimension, thereby changing the size of himself or other beings or objects. Pym is the creator of the robot Ultron, whom he created as an experiment after examining Dragon Man, showing his knack for AI and cybernetics.

After constant experimentation with size-changing via ingested capsules and particle-filled gas, Pym is eventually able to change size at will, and mentally generate Pym particles to change the sizes of other living beings or inanimate objects. Pym retains his normal strength when &quot;ant&quot; size, and possesses greatly increased strength and stamina when in &quot;giant&quot; form, courtesy of the increased mass. Pym&#x27;s costume is synthetic stretch fabric composed of unstable molecules and automatically adapts to his shifting sizes.

Pym also uses a cybernetic helmet he created for achieving rudimentary communication with ants and other higher order insects. As Yellowjacket, then later as Wasp, Pym wears artificial wings and has bio-blasters called &quot;stingers&quot; built into his gloves. He took up the Wasp mantle in memory of Janet, who was believed to be dead at the time.

Pym also carries a variety of weaponry, provisions, and scientific instruments, which are shrunken to the size of microchips and stored in the pockets of his uniform. An experienced superhero, Pym is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter. In his first appearance, he claimed to be a master of judo, is skilled in wrestling and karate and has since been seen in combat with opponents of both his own size and radically larger than himself (as a result of his size-changing abilities).

During his stay with the West Coast Avengers, Pym constructed a one-man vehicle with artificial intelligence named Rover. Rover is able to communicate with Pym and is capable of flight and discharging energy and acid.

Back with the Avengers main team, he built a second Rover, resembling an Avengers Quinjet.

After fusing with Ultron, he now contains all of his creation&#x27;s abilities when he is in control.

==Successors==
There are a number of characters in the Marvel universe that have also used the &quot;Pym particles&quot; to effect size changing. These include Janet van Dyne, Clint Barton, Bill Foster, Scott Lang, Erik Josten, Rita DeMara, Cassandra &quot;Cassie&quot; Lang, Eric O&#x27;Grady, Tom Foster, Shang-Chi, Raz Malhotra and Nadia Pym. Although they do not use their powers for altering their size, both Wonder Man and Vision derive their powers from Pym particles.

<text>Sir Peter James Luff (born 18 February 1955) is a British former politician and previous Chair of the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the National Lottery Heritage Fund. Formerly a British Conservative Party politician, he was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Mid Worcestershire from 1997 to 2015 and for Worcester from 1992 until 1997. He was a junior Defence minister from 2010 to 2012.

==Early life==
Peter Luff was born in the town of Windsor in Berkshire and attended the local Windsor Grammar School. He studied at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, receiving a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Economics in 1976.

Before entering parliament, he worked for three years from 1977 as a research assistant to the Conservative MP Peter Walker, before managing Edward Heath&#x27;s private office for two years from 1980. He became the managing director of Good Relations Ltd, a public affairs company, in 1982.

In 1987, he became a special adviser to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, David Young. He became a senior consultant for Lowe Bell Communications (later Bell Pottinger Communications) in 1989, before again working for Good Relations from 1990.

==Parliamentary career==
He contested Holborn and St Pancras at the 1987 general election, but was comfortably beaten by the sitting Labour MP, Frank Dobson. He was first elected to Parliament for Worcester, when he succeeded his former boss, Peter Walker.

Following changes in the parliamentary constituency boundaries, he was selected for the new Mid Worcestershire constituency, comprising large areas of three former constituencies, defeating another sitting Conservative MP, Eric Forth, for the nomination. He won the safe seat comfortably and was a member of the House of Commons from 1992. In the 1997 Labour landslide, he held his seat, and retained it until standing down in 2015.

He was appointed a Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) in 1993 to the energy minister Tim Eggar, and from 1996 he served as PPS to both Ann Widdecombe the prisons minister at the Home Office and Lord Mackay, Lord Chancellor, holding these two positions until the defeat of the Conservative government at the general election of 1997.

As a backbench MP, he served on many parliamentary select committees, including chairing the Agriculture committee from 1997 to 2000, and from 2005 to 2010 he chaired what was successively known as the Trade and Industry Committee; the Business and Enterprise Select Committee; and the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee.

He was the founder member of the Parliamentary Hunting with Hounds Middle Way Group, and took a keen parliamentary interest in India. In the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition of May 2010, Luff was appointed as a junior Defence minister at the Ministry of Defence, with the post of Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology.

Prior to the general election of 2015, Luff stood down as a candidate. He was knighted in the 2014 New Year Honours for political and public service. He joined the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the National Lottery Heritage Fund as Chair of the Board of Trustees on 30 March 2015.

==Personal life==
He married Julia Jenks in 1982. They have a son and a daughter.

<doc id="428670" wikidata="Q584299" url="?curid=428670" title="Entamoeba coli">
<text>Entamoeba coli is a non-pathogenic species of &quot;Entamoeba&quot; that frequently exists as a commensal parasite in the human gastrointestinal tract. &quot;E. coli&quot; (not to be confused with the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;) is important in medicine because it can be confused during microscopic examination of stained stool specimens with the pathogenic &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;. While this differentiation is typically done by visual examination of the parasitic cysts via light microscopy, new methods using molecular biology techniques have been developed.

This amoeba does not move much by the use of its pseudopod, and creates a &quot;&quot;sur place&quot; (non-progressive) movement&quot; inside the large intestine. Usually, the amoeba is immobile, and keeps its round shape. This amoeba, in its trophozoite stage, is only visible in fresh, unfixed stool specimens. Sometimes the &quot;Entamoeba coli&quot; have parasites as well. One is the fungus &quot;Sphaerita&quot; spp. This fungus lives in the cytoplasm of the &quot;E. coli&quot;. 

The abbreviated scientific name of this amoeba, &quot;E. coli&quot;, is often mistaken for the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. Unlike the bacterium, the amoeba is mostly harmless, and does not cause as many intestinal problems as some strains of the &quot;E. coli&quot; bacterium. To make the naming of these organisms less confusing, &quot;alternate contractions&quot; are used to name the species for the purpose making the naming easier; for example, using &quot;Esch. coli&quot; and &quot;Ent. coli&quot; for the bacterium and amoeba, instead of using &quot;E. coli&quot; for both.

==Clinical significance==

The presence of &quot;E.coli&quot; is not cause in and of itself to seek treatment as it is considered harmless. However, when a person becomes infected with this benign entamoeba, other pathogenic organisms may have been introduced as well, and these other pathogens might cause infection or illness.

==Morphology==

&quot;Entamoeba&quot; species all come in monogenetic forms, or having one generation lifecycles. &quot;E. coli&quot; has &quot;three distinct morphological forms exist airing the life cycle-Trophozoite, Pre-cystic stage and Cystic stage&quot;. This lifecycle gives rise to the general way of how &quot;Entamoeba&quot; species form. This parasite has one large nucleus with a thick membrane surrounding the nucleus. There are many chromatin inside the nucleus, and one large, irregular-shaped karyosome. The chromatin is clumped, and uneven in disperse inside the nucleus. The parasite forms by binary fission like most &quot;Entamoeba&quot; spp.
The mature cyst is the infective stage, and is known to survive longer than those of &quot;E. histolytica&quot;. The cysts can survive three to four months outside the host&#x27;s body after desiccation. The cysts cause infection by consuming contaminated food and drinks like waste water. Sometimes insects and rodents carry the parasite to cause infection in the food and drinks. Excystation happens once the cysts are ingested, and travel to the large intestine.

==Diagnosis==
&quot;E. coli&quot; trophozoites can be distinguished by their wide and tapered pseudopodia. They are often mistaken for &quot;E. histolytica&quot; due to their overlap in size. The cysts are distinguished by noticing the eight nuclei found in the mature form.
To diagnose for &quot;E. coli&quot;, a stool sample is usually tested. This is the best method to check to see if the parasite is &quot;E. coli&quot; and not &quot;E. histolytica&quot;. This usually involves checking the cysts for the size, shape, and the number of nuclei. &quot;E. coli&quot; has cysts in size up to 10 to 35 micrometers, the shape is irregular, oval with a shell-like appearance that is more uniformed compared to &quot;E. histolytica&quot;, and has up to eight nuclei in the cyst compared to the four nuclei of &quot;E. histolytica&quot;. To the untrained eye of an inexperienced microbiologists, &quot;tetranucleate cysts of &quot;Entamoeba coli&quot; can be mistaken for mature cysts of &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;&quot; Often &quot; a tetranucleate &quot;Entamoeba coli&quot; cyst is larger than a mature cyst of &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;, can be variable in shape, and has nuclear peripheral chromatin and karyosome composed of irregular granules&quot; in this matter of comparison.
To make a diagnosis for any &quot;Entamoeba&quot; species, usually a wet mount is created &quot;by finding the characteristic cysts in an iodine stained, formol-ether concentration method or by detecting the characteristic trophozoites in a wet preparation or a permanent stained preparation&quot; to see what they may look like. Also, these stains of trichrome can be used to mount the cysts of any &quot;Entamoeba&quot; spp.
Other tests can be used to diagnosis for &quot;Entamoeba&quot; spp. These tests involve the use of laboratory methods. Some of these laboratory tests include: the use of light microscopy, culture methods, isoenzyme analysis, antibody detection tests, antigen detection tests, immunochromatographic assays, and DNA-based diagnostic tests. Some uses of microscopy also involve the use of transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Usually, the cysts are freeze fractured to insure that the samples are easier to look at to compare &quot;Entamoeba&quot; spp.
The DNA-based diagnostic tests include the use of DNA extraction, PCR, microarrays, and typing methods.For example, one DNA-based diagnostic test that is changing how &quot;Entamoeba&quot; spp. is being diagnosis faster and more accurate is by using the &quot;Reverse Line Hybridization Assay&quot; test. This test main purpose is to detect and different Entamoeba spp. in stool samples in order to find the causative agent of amoebic dysentery, &quot;E. histolytica&quot;. This test involves the use of gene sequencing, and seeing what different genomes each &quot;Entamoeba&quot; spp. has to help detect the deadly &quot;E. histolytica&quot;.

==Pathology==
&quot;E. coli&quot; are mostly harmless parasites, and do not cause harm to the host. However, there have been cases of internal bleeding. Usually, the cytoplasm of the &quot;E. coli&quot; &quot;does not contain red blood cells, except in the rare case of patients with intestinal hemorrhage&quot; that leads to blood in the stools of these patients. This may lead to intestinal lesions.
Other problems that &quot;E. coli&quot; causes are usually result from having too many in the large intestine. For example, large populations of &quot;E. coli&quot; may lead to &quot;dyspepsia, hyperacidity, gastritis, and indigestion&quot;; these are common problems of most intestinal parasites.

==Treatment==
There is generally no need to treat for &quot;E. coli&quot;, due to the rarity of this parasite becoming infectious. In one exceptional situation, &quot;E. coli&quot; was found to be infectious: in northern Europe, stool samples and electron microscopy revealed large populations of the amoeba within a group of patients with persistent diarrhea. Some types of treatments may need to be used due to large populations. Some arsenical compounds are shown to treat the trophozoite stage, like carbarsone. Other compounds used to treat large populations of &quot;E. coli&quot; include diloxanide furoate, and this usually is used in antiamebic therapy.

<doc id="428673" wikidata="Q806551" url="?curid=428673" title="Bangor, County Down">
<text>Bangor ( ; ) is a city in County Down, Northern Ireland, on the southern side of Belfast Lough. It is within the Belfast metropolitan area and is 13 miles (22 km) east of Belfast city centre, to which it is linked by the A2 road and the Belfast–Bangor railway line. The population was 64,596 at the 2021 census. Bangor was granted city status in 2022, becoming Northern Ireland&#x27;s sixth city.

Bangor Abbey was an important and influential monastery founded in the 6th century by Saint Comgall. Bangor grew during the 17th century Plantation of Ulster, when many Scottish settlers arrived. Today, tourism is important to the local economy, particularly in the summer months, and plans are being made for the long-delayed redevelopment of the seafront; a notable historical building in the city is Bangor Old Custom House. The largest plot of private land in the area, the Clandeboye Estate, which is a few miles from the city centre, belonged to the Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava. Bangor hosts the Royal Ulster and Ballyholme yacht clubs. Bangor Marina is one of the largest in Ireland, and holds Blue Flag status.

==Name==
The name &quot;Bangor&quot; comes from , from and . This is thought to mean &#x27;place of points&#x27; or &#x27;horned curve&#x27;, referring to the shoreline of Bangor Bay. The Old Irish tale, &quot;Táin Bó Fraích&quot;, gives a fanciful explanation for the name. It tells how the Connacht warrior Fráech and the Ulster warrior Conall Cernach were returning to Ireland from the Alps with Fráech&#x27;s cattle. When they came to shore at what is now Bangor Bay, the cattle shed their horns, thus giving rise to the name &quot;Trácht mBennchoir&quot;, &quot;the strand of the horn-casting&quot;.

Bangor Bay was originally called &quot;Inber Beg&quot; (Inver Beg), &#x27;the little inlet or rivermouth&#x27;, after the now-culverted stream which ran past the abbey. It was also recorded as &quot;Inber Bece&quot;. The area was also known as &#x27;The Vale of Angels&#x27;, as Saint Patrick is said to have once rested there and had a vision of angels.

==History==
Bangor has a long and varied history, from the Bronze Age people whose swords were discovered in 1949 or the Viking burial found on Ballyholme beach, to the Victorian pleasure seekers who travelled on the new railway from Belfast to take in the sea air. The city has been the site of a Gaelic Irish monastery renowned throughout Europe for its learning and scholarship, the victim of violent Viking raids in the 8th and 9th centuries, and the new home of Scottish and English planters during the Plantation of Ulster.

===Bangor Abbey===
The &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot; says that the monastery of Bangor was founded by Saint Comgall from Antrim in the year 555, while other annals give the year as 558. It was where the &quot;Antiphonary of Bangor&quot; (&quot;Antiphonarium Benchorense)&quot; was written, a copy of which can be seen in the town&#x27;s heritage centre. The monastery had such widespread influence that the city is one of only four places in Ireland to be named in the Hereford Mappa Mundi in 1300. The monastery, situated roughly where the Church of Ireland Bangor Abbey stands at the head of the city, became a centre of great learning and was among the most eminent of Europe&#x27;s missionary institutions in the Early Middle Ages.

At Bangor, Comgall instituted a rigid monastic rule of incessant prayer and fasting. Far from turning people away, this ascetic rule attracted thousands. When Comgall died in 602, the annals report that three thousand monks looked to him for guidance. Named &quot;Bennchor Mór&quot;, &quot;the great Bangor&quot;, to distinguish it from its British contemporaries, it became the greatest monastic school in Ulster as well as one of the three leading monasteries of Celtic Christianity. The others were Iona, the great missionary centre founded by Columba, and Bangor on the Dee, founded by Dinooth; the ancient Welsh Triads also confirm the &quot;Perpetual Harmonies&quot; at the house.

Throughout the sixth century, Bangor became famous for its choral psalmody. &quot;It was this music which was carried to the continent by the Bangor missionaries in the following century&quot;. Divine services of the seven hours of prayer were carried out throughout Bangor&#x27;s existence, however the monks went further and carried out the practice of laus perennis. In the twelfth century, Bernard of Clairvaux spoke of Comgall and Bangor, stating, &quot;the solemnization of divine offices was kept up by companies, who relieved each other in succession, so that not for one moment day and night was there an intermission of their devotions.&quot; This continuous singing was antiphonal in nature, based on the call and response reminiscent of Patrick&#x27;s vision, but also practised by St. Martin&#x27;s houses in France. Many of these psalms and hymns were later written down in the &quot;Antiphonary of Bangor&quot; which came to reside in Colombanus&#x27; monastery at Bobbio, Italy.

In 580, a Bangor monk named Mirin took Christianity to Paisley in the west of Scotland, where he died &quot;full of sanctity and miracles&quot;. In 590, the fiery Colombanus, one of Comgall&#x27;s leaders, set out from Bangor with twelve other brothers, including Saint Gall who planted monasteries throughout Switzerland. In Burgundy, Columbanus established a severe monastic rule at Luxeuil which mirrored that of Bangor. From there he went to Bobbio in Italy and established the house which became one of the largest monasteries in Europe.

Saint Malachy was elected abbot of the monastery in 1123, a year before being consecrated Bishop of Connor. His extensive travels around Europe inspired him to rejuvenate the monasteries in Ireland, and he replaced the existing wooden huts with stone buildings.

===17th and 18th centuries===

The modern city had its origins in the early 17th century when James Hamilton, a Lowland Scot, arrived in Bangor, having been granted lands in North Down by King James VI and I in 1605. In 1612, King James made Bangor a borough which permitted it to elect two MPs to the Irish Parliament in Dublin. The Old Custom House, which was completed by Hamilton in 1637 after James I granted Bangor the status of a port in 1620, is a visible reminder of the new order introduced by Hamilton and his Scots settlers.

In 1689 during the Williamite War in Ireland, Marshal Schomberg&#x27;s expedition landed at Ballyholme Bay and captured Bangor, before going on to besiege Carrickfergus. Schomberg&#x27;s force went south to Dundalk Camp and were present at the Battle of the Boyne the following year.

The city was an important source of customs revenue for the Crown and in the 1780s Colonel Robert Ward improved the harbour and promoted the cotton industries; today&#x27;s seafront was the location of several large steam-powered cotton mills, which employed a large workforce.

The end of the 18th century was a time of great political and social turmoil in Ireland. The United Irishmen, inspired by the American and French Revolutions, sought to achieve a greater degree of independence from Britain. On the morning of 10 June during the Irish Rebellion of 1798, a force of United Irishmen, mainly from Bangor, Donaghadee, Greyabbey and Ballywalter attempted to occupy the nearby town of Newtownards. They met with musket fire from the market house and were subsequently defeated.

===Victorian era===

By the middle of the 19th century, the cotton mills had declined and the city changed in character once again. The laying of the railway in 1865 meant that inexpensive travel from Belfast was possible, and working-class people could afford for the first time to holiday in the city. Bangor soon became a fashionable resort for Victorian holidaymakers, as well as a desirable home to the wealthy. Many of the houses overlooking Bangor Bay (some of which have been demolished to make way for modern flats) date from this period. The belief in the restorative powers of the sea air meant that the city became a location for sea bathing and marine sports, and the number of visitors from Great Britain increased during the Edwardian era at the beginning of the 20th century, which also saw the improvement of Ward Park.

===20th century to present===

The inter-war period of the early 20th century saw the development of the Tonic Cinema, Pickie Pool and Caproni&#x27;s ballroom. All three were among the foremost of their type in Ireland, although they no longer exist. However, there is a park which replaced Pickie Pool named Pickie Fun Park. A children&#x27;s paddling pool was created as the original Pickie Pool was demolished due to the rejuvenation of Bangor seafront in the 1980s and early 1990s. Pickie Fun Park closed in early 2011 to be refurbished and modernised. The park, which reopened in March 2012, has an 18-hole maritime themed mini golf course, children&#x27;s electric cars and splash pads (replacing the old children&#x27;s paddling pool). Also, the Pickie Puffer steam train has been given an updated route and the swans have a new lagoon.

During World War II, General Dwight D. Eisenhower addressed Allied troops in Bangor, who were departing to take part in the D-Day landings. In 2005, his granddaughter Mary-Jean Eisenhower came to the city to oversee the renaming of the marina&#x27;s North Pier to the Eisenhower Pier.

With the growing popularity of inexpensive foreign holidays from the 1960s onwards, Bangor declined as a tourist resort and was forced to rethink its future. The second half of the 20th century saw its role as a dormitory town for Belfast become more important. Its population increased dramatically; from around 14,000 in 1930 it had reached 40,000 by 1971 and 58,000 by the end of the century (the 2001 census showed the population as 76,403).

The 1970s saw the building of the Springhill Shopping Centre, an out-of-town development near the A2 road to Belfast and Northern Ireland&#x27;s first purpose-built shopping centre. It has since been demolished to facilitate a modern Tesco supermarket.

In the early 1990s, Bloomfield Shopping Centre, another out-of-town development, opened beside Bloomfield Estate. In 2007, a major renovation of the centre began, including the construction of a multistorey car park. The trend towards out-of-town shopping centres was somewhat reversed with the construction of the Flagship Centre around 1990. The Flagship Centre went into administration and was closed in January 2019, it is currently undergoing appraisal for re-development options.

The former seafront of the city is awaiting redevelopment and has been for over two decades, with a large part of the frontage already demolished, leaving a patch of derelict ground facing onto the marina. A great deal of local controversy surrounds this process and the many plans put forward by the council and developers for the land. In November 2009 it was voted by UTV viewers as Ulster&#x27;s Biggest Eyesore. A state of the art recycling centre has been built in Balloo Industrial Estate which is supposed to be one of the most advanced in Europe. It opened in the summer of 2008.

In May 2022, it was announced that, as part of the Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours, Bangor would be granted city status by Letters Patent. It received the status on 2 December 2022, becoming Northern Ireland&#x27;s sixth city, alongside Armagh, Belfast, Derry, Lisburn, and Newry.

===The Troubles===
Despite escaping much of the sectarian violence during The Troubles, Bangor was the site of some major incidents. During the Troubles there were eight murders in the city including that of the first Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) woman to be murdered on duty; 26-year-old Mildred Harrison was killed by an explosion from a UVF bomb while on foot patrol in the High Street on 16 March 1975. On 23 March 1972 the IRA detonated two large car bombs on the town&#x27;s main street.

On 30 March 1974, paramilitaries carried out a major incendiary bomb attack on the main shopping centre in Bangor. On 21 October 1992, an IRA unit from the lower Ormeau exploded a bomb in Main Street, causing large amounts of damage to nearby buildings.

Main Street sustained more damage on 7 March 1993, when the IRA exploded a car bomb. Four RUC officers were injured in the explosion; the cost of the damage was later estimated at £2 million, as there was extensive damage to retail premises and Trinity Presbyterian Church, as well as minor damage to the local Church of Ireland Parish Church and First Bangor Presbyterian Church.

==Coat of arms==
The shield is emblazoned with two ships, which feature the Red Hand of Ulster on their sails, denoting that Bangor is in the province of Ulster. The blue and white stripes on the shield show that Bangor is a seaside city. Supporting the shield are two sea-horses, signifying Bangor&#x27;s links with the sea. Each is charged with a gold roundel; the left featuring a shamrock to represent Ireland, and the right featuring a bull&#x27;s head, possibly in reference to the derivation of the city&#x27;s name. The arms are crested by a haloed St Comgall, founder of the city&#x27;s abbey, who was an important figure in the spread of Christianity. The motto reads &quot;Beannchor&quot;, the archaic form of the city&#x27;s name in Irish.

==Governance==

Bangor is administered by Ards and North Down Borough Council which is based at Bangor Castle.

==Geography==
Bangor lies on the east coast of Northern Ireland, on the south shore of the mouth of Belfast Lough, north east of central Belfast.

===Townlands===

Bangor city includes the following townlands:
*Balloo ()
*Ballycroghan ()
*Ballyholme (probably meaning &quot;townland of the river meadow&quot;)

*Ballymacormick ()
*Ballymagee ()
*Ballyree ()
*Ballyvarnet, historically &#x27;Ballyvernan&#x27; ()
*Carnalea ()
*Conlig (, referring to a standing stone on Runestone Hill)
*Rathgill or Rathgael ()

===Ballyholme Bay===

The sea area to the north east of Bangor is Ballyholme Bay, named for the township of Ballyholme in the east of the town. During World War II the bay was used as a base for American troops training for the Normandy Landings. Two ships have been named SS Ballyholme Bay. In 1903 a Viking grave was found on the shore at Ballyholme Bay: it contained two bronze brooches, a bowl, a fragment of chain and some textile material. It has been said that &quot;Ballyholme Bay is a sheltered bay and studies have suggested that it is one of the best landing places on Belfast Lough and would therefore have made a good location for a Viking base. It is possible that the burial was associated with a Viking settlement in the area.&quot; In 1689 Field Marshal Schomberg landed with 10,000 troops either at Ballyholme Bay or at Groomsport, a little further east.

==Transport==

===Rail===

The first section of Belfast and County Down Railway line from Belfast to Holywood opened in 1848 and was extended to Bangor by the Belfast, Holywood and Bangor Railway (BHBR), opening on 1 May 1865, along with Bangor railway station. It was acquired by the BCDR in 1884. and closed to goods traffic on 24 April 1950. Bangor West railway station was opened by the BCDR on 1 June 1928. Most of the BCDR&#x27;s network was shut down by its successor, the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA) in 1950, two years after nationalisation and only the branch to Bangor survived. The line received a further blow in 1965 when it was isolated from the rest of the Irish railway system by closure of the Belfast Central Railway line from Ballymacarrett Junction (east of Queen’s Quay station in Belfast) to Central Junction, just west of the former GNR(I) Great Victoria Street station. Fortunately the connection was rebuilt in 1976 to allow Bangor line services to transfer to Belfast Central (now Lanyon Place) and run directly through to the rest of the Northern Ireland railway network.

Today the Belfast–Bangor line is operated by Translink&#x27;s Northern Ireland Railways, which runs trains to either Belfast or .

<text>Frisby on the Wreake is a village and civil parish on the River Wreake about west of Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, England. The 2011 Census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 557.

The toponym &quot;Frisby&quot; was applied by Danish invaders in the 9th or 10th century. It refers to the farm or settlement of the Frisians. The &quot;on the Wreake&quot; suffix was added later to distinguish the village from another Frisby, near Billesdon, about to the southeast. &quot;Wreake&quot; refers to the River Wreake. The name of the river originates from a Danish word referring to the meandering nature of the river.

==Parish church==
The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of St Thomas of Canterbury are 12th-century. The building includes much 14th- and 15th-century work. The north aisle was rebuilt about 1820. The chancel was rebuilt when the church was restored in 1848. The church is now a Grade I listed building.

The west tower has three bells. Hugh I Watts of Leicester cast the treble bell in about 1600. William Noone of Nottingham cast the second and tenor bells in 1711.

In the 18th century the parish priest agreed to marry couples from some distance away. This was at a time when wedding ceremonies were closely controlled by the church and state. It is likely that many of the marriages of couples from elsewhere went against the consent of close relatives. The number of weddings at the parish church increased substantially compared to earlier and later times and the village earned the later nickname of the Gretna Green of the Midlands.

==Economic and social history==
When the church was founded the main road from Leicester to Melton Mowbray passed through the village, entering from Hoby with Rotherby to the south and leaving by Kirby Bellars to the north. The village was bypassed to the south when the turnpike, now the primary route A607, was built in the 18th century. The new road passes a medieval wayside cross that may have been a preaching place. The base and broken shaft of the cross survive. There is another medieval stone cross in the village centre.

Frisby Mill was on the River Wreake and was working at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086. The mill was rebuilt several times, but fell into disuse at the beginning of the 20th century. The channels to divert the river water to the mill may still be seen in the fields to the northwest of the village.
Farming was organised on an open field system. Each landholder was awarded a series of strips in the three common fields. This ensured everyone shared the best and worst land. The remains of the strips can still be seen, more than a thousand years since they were first created. When the great fields were enclosed in the late 18th century, landowners were compensated by the award of blocks of land. The poorer owners often sold their holdings, which were usually very small, and consolidation into the present farms took place. The existing farms in the outlying fields were all created at this time.

Originally the village lands were all worked from homes in the village itself. The remaining farmhouses in the village are older than those outside the village. As in many other Leicestershire villages, the new, consolidated blocks of land were planted with hawthorn hedges, Thus, most hedges between the Frisby fields are not more than 250 years old. Those by the roadside and along the parish boundary are likely to be much older, as these were the lines that marked the medieval limits of the parish and its fields.
Transport was improved by the opening of the Melton Mowbray Navigation in the 1790s and the Syston and Peterborough Railway in 1847. A condition of building the railway was that it should take over the canal. Frisby railway station served the parish until British Railways closed it in the year 1961.

<doc id="428675" wikidata="Q7715895" url="?curid=428675" title="The Battle of the Books">
<text>&quot;The Battle of the Books&quot; is a short satire written by Jonathan Swift and published as part of the prolegomena to his &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; in 1704. It depicts a literal battle between books in the King&#x27;s Library (housed in St James&#x27;s Palace at the time of the writing), as ideas and authors struggle for supremacy. Because of the satire, &quot;The Battle of the Books&quot; has become a term for the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns. It is one of Swift&#x27;s earliest well-known works.

== Ancients vs. Moderns ==
In France at the end of the seventeenth century, a minor furore arose over the question of whether contemporary learning had surpassed what was known by those in Classical Greece and Rome. The &quot;moderns&quot; (epitomised by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle) took the position that the modern age of science and reason was superior to the superstitious and limited world of Greece and Rome. In his opinion, modern man saw farther than the ancients ever could. The &quot;ancients,&quot; for their part, argued that all that was necessary to be known was to be found in Virgil, Cicero, Homer, and especially Aristotle.

This literary contest was re-enacted in miniature in England when Sir William Temple published an answer to Fontenelle entitled &quot;Of Ancient and Modern Learning&quot; in 1690. His essay introduced two metaphors to the debate that would be reused by later authors. First, he proposed that modern man was just a dwarf standing upon the &quot;shoulders of giants&quot; (that modern man saw farther because he begins with the observations and learning of the ancients). They possessed a clear view of nature, and modern man only reflected/refined their vision. These metaphors, of the dwarf/giant and the reflecting/emanative light, would show up in Swift&#x27;s satire and others. Temple&#x27;s essay was answered by Richard Bentley, the classicist and William Wotton, the critic. Temple&#x27;s friends/clients, sometimes known as the &quot;Christ Church Wits,&quot; referring to their association with Christ Church, Oxford and the guidance of Francis Atterbury, then attacked the &quot;moderns&quot; (and Wotton in particular). The debate in England lasted only for a few years.

William Temple was by that point a retired minister, the Secretary of State for Charles II who had conducted peace negotiations with France. As a minister, it was beneath his station to answer common and &quot;professional&quot; (known then as &quot;hack&quot;) authors, so most of the battle took place between Temple&#x27;s enemies and Temple&#x27;s proxies. Notably, Jonathan Swift was not among the participants, though he was working as Temple&#x27;s secretary. Therefore, it is likely that the quarrel was more of a spur to Swift&#x27;s imagination than a debate that he felt inclined to enter.

== The satire ==

Jonathan Swift worked for William Temple during the time of the controversy, and Swift&#x27;s &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot; (1703/1705) takes part in the debate. From its first publication, Swift added a short satire entitled &quot;The Battle of the Books&quot; to the &quot;Tale of a Tub.&quot; In this piece, there is an epic battle fought in a library when various books come alive and attempt to settle the arguments between moderns and ancients. In Swift&#x27;s satire, he skilfully manages to avoid saying which way victory fell. He portrays the manuscript as having been damaged in places, thus leaving the end of the battle up to the reader.

The battle is told with great detail to particular authors jousting with their replacements and critics. The battle is not just between Classical authors and modern authors, but also between authors and critics. The prose is a parody of heroic poetry along the lines of Samuel Butler&#x27;s parody of battle in &quot;Hudibras&quot;.

The combat in the &quot;Battle&quot; is interrupted by the interpolated allegory of the spider and the bee. A spider, &quot;swollen up to the first Magnitude, by the Destruction of infinite Numbers of Flies&quot; resides like a castle holder above a top shelf, and a bee, flying from the natural world and drawn by curiosity, wrecks the spider&#x27;s web. The spider curses the bee for clumsiness and for wrecking the work of one who is his better. The spider says that his web is his home, a stately manor, while the bee is a vagrant who goes anywhere in nature without any concern for reputation. The bee answers that he is doing the bidding of nature, aiding in the fields, while the spider&#x27;s castle is merely what was drawn from its own body, which has &quot;a good plentiful Store of Dirt and Poison.&quot; This allegory was already somewhat old before Swift employed it, and it is a digression within the &quot;Battle&quot; proper. However, it also illustrates the theme of the whole work. The bee is like the ancients and like authors: it gathers its materials from nature and sings its drone song in the fields. The spider is like the moderns and like critics: it kills the weak and then spins its web (books of criticism) from the taint of its own body digesting the viscera.

In one sense, the &quot;Battle of the Books&quot; illustrates one of the great themes that Swift would explore in &quot;A Tale of a Tub&quot;: the madness of pride involved in believing one&#x27;s own age to be supreme and the inferiority of derivative works. One of the attacks in the &quot;Tale&quot; was on those who believe that being &quot;readers&quot; of works makes them the equals of the &quot;creators&quot; of works. The other satire Swift affixed to the &quot;Tale&quot;, &quot;The Mechanical Operation of the Spirit,&quot; illustrates the other theme: an inversion of the figurative and literal as a part of madness.

==Reuse of the trope==
Swift&#x27;s &quot;Battle&quot; owed a great deal to Boileau&#x27;s &quot;Le Lutrin&quot;, although it was not a translation. Instead, it was an English work based on the same premise. However, John Ozell attempted to answer Swift with his translation of &quot;Le Lutrin,&quot; where the battle sees Tory authors skewered by Whigs. This prompted a satire of Ozell by Swift and by Alexander Pope. Further, other &quot;battles of the books&quot; appeared after Swift&#x27;s. Often, these were merely political attacks, as in the later &quot;Battel of the Poets&quot; (1729, by Edward Cooke), which was an attack on Alexander Pope. As a set piece or &quot;topos&quot; of 18th-century satire, the &quot;Battle of the Books&quot; was a standard shorthand for both the Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns and the era of Swift&#x27;s battle with William Wotton.

<doc id="428677" wikidata="Q185220" url="?curid=428677" title="LAN party">
<text>A LAN party is a social gathering of participants with personal computers or compatible game consoles, where a local area network (LAN) connection is established between the devices using a router or switch, primarily for the purpose of playing multiplayer video games together. LAN party events differ significantly from LAN gaming centers and Internet cafes in that LAN parties generally require participants to &quot;bring your own computer&quot; (BYOC) and are not permanent installations, often taking place in general-use venues or residences.

The size of these networks may vary from as few as two people to very large gatherings of a hundred or more. Small parties can form spontaneously and take advantage of common household networking equipment, but larger ones typically require more planning, equipment and preparation, even dedicated gaming servers. As of 2020, the world record for the size of a LAN party is 22,810 visitors, set at DreamHack, in Jönköping, Sweden.

==Small parties==

Usually, smaller LAN parties consist of people bringing their computers over to each other&#x27;s houses to host and play multiplayer games.

These are sometimes established between small groups of friends, and hosted at a central location or one that is known to all participants. Such events are often organized quickly with little planning, and some overnight events, with some stretching into days (or even weeks). Because of the small number of players, games are usually played on small levels and/or against bots.

If the venue lacks Wi-Fi, an ad hoc network may be set up, thereby eliminating the need for a wired network. Providing refreshments is often also a duty of the host, though guests are usually asked to contribute. In larger parties where participants may not all know each other personally, an entry fee may even be charged. Another tradition of some small groups is to purchase large amounts of fast food for consumption over many days. Many LAN participants will also bring food or drink to consume over the course of the party—though they can be held at any hour, many LAN parties begin late in the evening and run through the next morning, making energy drinks a popular choice.

When some of the participants cannot be present or when merging a few LAN parties together, VPN software such as Hamachi can be used to arrange computers over the Internet so they appear to be on the same LAN.

Normally, the host will host the games but sometimes at very small LAN parties (e.g. 2 or 3 people) all participants will connect to an online internet server and add a word in front of their name to tell everyone else that they are a clan or group. At bigger LANs (e.g. 5 or more people) the host or a friend of the host will use a spare PC as a game server to serve all the participants. Usually the host and/or the owner are administrators.

The group can play together in another server as well if they wish as long as they are in the same LAN.

Private LAN parties were at their peak in popularity during the late 1990s to early 2000s when broadband internet access was either unavailable or too expensive for most people at the time. Another purpose for attending private LAN parties was also the opportunity to share software, movies or music among the participants. File-sharing over LAN networks provided a convenient way to exchange content among participants, as most average internet users did not have access to the high-speed and bandwidth that a broadband Internet connection offers to accommodate large file size downloads. Since the wide availability of high-speed internet, friends can more easily remotely play their multiplayer games together, using gaming-orientated software such as TeamSpeak, Discord and Steam. Social media can also assist in online meet-ups and communication for groups of friends to be able to play their multiplayer games online together, in the comfort of their own homes rather than the inconvenience of packing and then setting up their PC&#x27;s to the LAN party host&#x27;s location.

== Console-based LAN parties ==
While traditional LAN parties have solely consisted of computer gaming, the widespread adoption of network-centric console platforms, such as Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, has led to an evolution in LAN parties. Modern consoles equipped with Ethernet ports are able to communicate with each other over standard routers or switches, much like traditional computers.

Console-LAN attendees need only their console, games, and television to garner the same local gaming experience as their computer-based counterparts. Many popular multiplayer games for the console have also been ported to the PC (e.g. &quot; and &quot;). Developers have given consumers the choice to enjoy the same multiplayer games on multiple platforms, paving way for an alternative stage in 21st-century LAN parties.

==Larger parties==


Many commercialized parties offer various tournaments, with competitions in such games as &quot;StarCraft&quot;, &quot;Warcraft III&quot;, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, &quot;Counter-Strike: Source&quot;, &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot;, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;, &quot;Fortnite&quot;, &quot;Kirby Air Ride&quot;, &quot;PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot;, &quot;Garry&#x27;s Mod&quot;, and games from the &quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty&quot;, &quot;Battlefield&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Halo&quot; series. Prizes may be awarded to winners, and can include computer hardware such as overclocking kits, cases, lights, fans, graphics cards and sometimes even complete computers (often considered humorous as typically the winner of the competition would already have (and be competing on) a custom PC far superior to the prize).

The duration of events is not standardized; organized parties often last for a weekend.

Big LAN parties often offer a quiet place to sleep, shower, and eat, as well as hired security, alternative entertainment (such as music), and a dedicated support crew, as well as a professionally managed network including a connection to the Internet. Catering might come in the form of a bar, delivered food such as pizza, or nearby shops. Some parties come fully catered in the form of regular barbecues or even employment of a catering staff running a public canteen.

Gaming clans — groups of gamers that often play in team games—often use these gatherings to meet one another, since they typically play together over the Internet between other parties with little real-world contact. Their goal is often to win tournaments. Clans are often in &quot;ladders&quot; where they move up after winning a match. As well as counting for standings in national and international gaming leagues such as the CPL there are regular events such as QuakeCon in which the very best players from around the world compete against one another, much like in popular sports. Practice matches are usually held prior to a match so competitors can get a rough idea of what they are up against.

Often case modders and overclockers attend these events to display their computers, which otherwise would be seen by few. Some come just to display their computers and look at others&#x27; computers.

Some attendees also use these parties for the purpose of file sharing. Copyright infringement via file sharing is often discouraged or forbidden by the larger parties. However, enforcement is rare and spotty due to the time involved and often a lack of desire by organizers. Some LAN parties actively support file sharing for legitimate purposes (game patches, updates, user-contributed content), and may run Direct Connect hubs or other P2P service servers. One of the main reasons for running such servers is so file sharing can be monitored/controlled while standard Windows file sharing (SMB/CIFS) can be blocked, thus preventing the spread of SMB/CIFS-based viruses. Most P2P setups used at LAN parties also have a &#x27;centralized&#x27; chat area, where all members of the LAN party can converse in an IRC-like environment.

There are also other kinds of parties not referred to as &quot;LAN parties&quot; where temporary LANs are built but are not used as the main attraction. Amongst these are demoparties such as Assembly and hacker conventions such as DEF CON.

In the traditionally active demoscene countries, such as those in Northern Europe, the LAN party culture is often heavily influenced by demoparties. This is due to the fact that many of the largest demoparties were already well established in the early 1990s and their facilities were also suitable for large-scale LAN party activity. This eventually led to gaming clans and other similar groups to attend these events and regard them merely as large LAN parties. On the other hand, it is not uncommon for &quot;pure&quot; LAN parties in Northern Europe to organize some demoscene-like competitions in areas such as computer graphics or home videos.

=== Sponsorship ===
Many computer companies, including NVIDIA, Cooler Master, Cyber Snipa, Antec, Corsair, Alienware, SteelSeries, Tesoro, and Thermaltake, offer sponsorship packages to large LAN parties, with funding, prizes, or equipment given in return for advertising. Many large-scale LAN parties seek such sponsorship, in order to reduce operating risk (often the organisers risk losing tens of thousands of dollars) and provide prizes for attendees.

==Culture==

LAN parties have their own unique culture. Enthusiasts often show off computers with extravagant aftermarket cooling systems, LED lighting effects, multi-display setups, and custom-built cases, and many other enhancements. Highly caffeinated drinks, termed energy drinks, are very popular in these events to improve concentration and stamina, since LAN parties often run into the early morning hours. Large parties can last for several days with no scheduled breaks. Most of the time, sleep is compromised to play for extended periods of time lasting from night to morning. There are also designated rooms separated from the LAN party for sleep.

<text>John Lyons (born 11 July 1949) is a Labour Party politician in the United Kingdom.

At the 2001 general election, he was elected to the House of Commons as the member of parliament for Strathkelvin and Bearsden.

Following the reduction in Scottish constituencies in the House of Commons under the Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act 2004, that constituency was abolished for the 2005 general election. Lyons stood at the new East Dunbartonshire seat, where he lost to the future Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson.

Following his defeat, he became a consultant on trade unions for FirstGroup.

Before his election to Parliament in 2001, he had worked as a UNISON official.

Lyons consistently voted against and opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

<doc id="428681" wikidata="Q280658" url="?curid=428681" title="Forward (association football)">
<text>In the sport of association football, a forward (attacker or striker) is an outfield position which primarily plays further up the pitch than midfielders and defenders. As with any attacking player, the role of the forward relies heavily on being able to create space for attack. Their advanced position and limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals on behalf of their team than other players. 

Attacking positions generally favour direct players who take on the defense of the opponent in order to create scoring chances, where they benefit from a lack of predictability in attacking play. Modern team formations normally include one to three forwards. For example, the common 4–2–3–1 includes one forward. Less conventional formations may include more than three forwards, or sometimes none.

==Centre-forward==

The traditional role of a centre-forward is to score the majority of goals on behalf of the team. If they are tall and physical players, with good heading ability, the player may also be used to get onto the end of crosses, win long balls, or receive passes and retain possession of the ball with their back to goal as teammates advance, in order to provide depth for their team or help teammates score by providing a pass (&#x27;through ball&#x27; into the box), the latter variation usually requiring quicker pace and good movement, in addition to finishing ability. Most modern centre-forwards operate in front of the second strikers or central attacking midfielders, and do the majority of the ball handling outside the box. The present role of a centre-forward is sometimes interchangeable with that of an attacking midfielder or second striker, however, especially in the 4–3–1–2 or 4–1–2–1–2 formations. The term centre-forward is taken from the earlier football playing formations, such as the 2–3–5, in which there were five &quot;forward&quot; players: two outside forwards, two inside forwards, and one centre-forward. The term &quot;target forward&quot; is often used interchangeably with that of a centre-forward, but usually describes a particular type of striker, who is usually a tall and physically strong player, who is adept at heading the ball; their main role is to win high balls in the air, hold up the ball, and create chances for other members of the team, in addition to possibly scoring many goals themselves. However, the two terms are not necessarily synonymous, with the target forward having developed into a more specialised role, while the centre-forward description is more broad, encompassing many types of forwards.

When numbers were introduced in the 1933 English FA Cup final, one of the two centre-forwards that day wore the number 9 – Everton&#x27;s Dixie Dean, a strong, powerful forward who had set the record for the most goals scored in a season in English football during the 1927–28 season. The number would then become synonymous with the centre-forward position (only worn that day because one team was numbered 1–11 whilst the other was numbered 12–22).

==Striker==

The role of a striker is rather different from that of a traditional centre-forward, although the terms centre-forward and striker are used interchangeably at times, as both play further up the field than other players, while tall, heavy and technical players, like Zlatan Ibrahimović, and Edin Džeko, have qualities which are suited to both positions. Like the centre-forward, the traditional role of a striker is to score goals; strikers are therefore known for their ability to peel off defenders and to run into space via the blind side of the defender and to receive the ball in a good goalscoring position, as typified by Ronaldo and Thierry Henry. They are typically fast players with good ball control and dribbling abilities. Shorter statured, more agile strikers like Michael Owen, Romário, Dries Mertens, Sergio Agüero, and Paulo Dybala have an advantage over taller defenders due to their short bursts of speed.

Good strikers should be able to shoot confidently with either foot, possess great power and accuracy, and have the ability to link-up with teammates and pass the ball under pressure in breakaway situations. While many strikers wear the number 9 shirt, such as Alan Shearer, an out and out striker, the position, to a lesser degree, is also associated with the number 10, which is frequently worn by more creative deep-lying forwards such as Pelé, and occasionally with numbers 7 and 11, which are often associated with wingers.

==Second striker==

Deep-lying forwards or second strikers have a long history in the game, but the terminology to describe their playing activity has varied over the years. Originally such players were termed inside forwards, creative or deep-lying centre-forwards (&quot;sub forwards&quot;). More recently, the role has occasionally been colloquially referred to as the centre-forward role, however, two more variations of this old type of player have developed: the second, or shadow, or support, or auxiliary striker and, in what is in fact a distinct position unto its own, the number 10; the former role is exemplified by players such as Dennis Bergkamp (who would play just behind the striker Thierry Henry at Arsenal), Alessandro Del Piero at Juventus, Youri Djorkaeff at Inter Milan, or Teddy Sheringham at Tottenham Hotspur. Other creative offensive players who play further back, such as Lionel Messi, Diego Maradona, Ronaldinho, Kaká, Rivaldo, Michael Laudrup, and Zinedine Zidane are often instead described as the &quot;number 10&quot;, and usually operate as an attacking midfielder or advanced playmaker.

The second striker position is a loosely defined and most often misunderstood description of a player positioned in a free role, somewhere between the out-and-out striker, whether the player is a &quot;target man&quot; or more of a &quot;poacher&quot;, and the number 10 or attacking midfielder, while possibly showing some of the characteristics of both. In fact, a term coined by French advanced playmaker Michel Platini, the &quot;nine-and-a-half&quot;, which he used to describe the playing role of his successor in the number 10 role at Juventus, Italian playmaker Roberto Baggio, has been an attempt to become a standard in defining the position. Conceivably, a number 10 can alternate as a second-striker provided that the player is also a prolific goalscorer; otherwise, a mobile forward with good technical ability (dribbling skills and ball control), acceleration, vision, passing, and link-up play, who can receive the ball and retain possession, in addition to being capable of scoring goals and creating opportunities for a less versatile centre-forward, is more suited to playing in the second striker role. This player should also be able to position themselves well in order to receive passes and subsequently either create or finish off a goalscoring opportunity. They should also be capable of finishing well with either foot as well as their head (which is less common, seeing as many second strikers are diminutive creative players), as this will lead to a good scoring percentage on attempts on goal and give their team an advantage offensively. Although they are often deployed in a free role, and given &quot;licence to roam&quot;, and either run forward, or drop further back in order to pick up the ball in deeper areas, giving them more time and space in possession, second or support strikers do not tend to get as involved in the orchestration of attacks as the number 10, nor do they bring as many other players into play, since they do not share the burden of responsibility, functioning predominantly in a supporting role as assist providers. In Italy, this role is known as a &quot;rifinitore&quot;, &quot;mezzapunta&quot;, or &quot;seconda punta&quot;, whereas in Brazil, it is known as &quot;segundo atacante&quot; or &quot;ponta-de-lança&quot;.

==Inside forward==

The position of inside forward was popularly used in the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries. The inside forwards would support the centre-forward, running and making space in the opposition defence, and, as the passing game developed, supporting him with passes. The role is broadly analogous to the &quot;&quot;hole&quot;&quot; or &quot;second striker&quot; position in the modern game, although here, there were two such players, known as inside right and inside left.
In early 2–3–5 formations the inside-forwards would flank the centre-forward on both sides. With the rise of the WM formation, the inside forwards were brought back to become attacking midfielders, supplying balls to the centre-forward and the two attacking outside forwards – known as the &quot;outside right&quot; and &quot;outside left&quot;. In Italian football jargon, the inside forward was initially occasionally known as a &quot;mezzala&quot; (literally &quot;half-winger&quot;, not to be confused with wing-half); however, the use of this particular term to describe inside forwards is now obsolete, as the &quot;mezzala&quot; label was later reapplied to describe the role of offensive-minded central midfielders in Italian football, while the inside forward role was instead labelled as &quot;interno&quot; (&quot;internal&quot;, in Italian) in Italian football in subsequent years.

In today&#x27;s game, inside forwards have been pushed up front to become either out-and-out attackers or false-9s, or out wide to wingers (in a 4–3–3 formation), or they have even been switched to a deeper position in which they are required to drop back to link-up with the midfield, while also supporting another striker playing alongside them up front (in a 4–4–2 formation). Many teams still employ one of their strikers in this latter more withdrawn role as a support forward for the main striker, in a role broadly similar to the inside forward.

==Outside forward==


An outside forward plays as the advanced forward on the right or left wing – as an outside right or outside left, typically as part of a 2–3–5 formation or one of its variants. As football tactics have largely developed, and wingers have dropped back to become midfielders, the terminology has changed and &quot;outside forward&quot; has become a historical term. Many commentators and football analysts still refer to the wing positions as &quot;outside right&quot; and &quot;outside left&quot;. Such players in the modern era have been labelled &quot;wing forwards&quot;, particularly when the two wingers play high up the pitch in a 4–3–3 or similar formation, where the front 3 attacking players have 3 central midfielders behind them. A wing forward who is known for cutting inside and shooting can have the term &quot;inverted winger&quot; used interchangeably.

The responsibilities of an outside forward include but are not limited to:
* Scoring: their first option should be to shoot, while their second option should be to find another way to create a goal opportunity for the team.
* Passing: when they run into a shooting angle that is unlikely to become a goal, they must find a way to pass the ball to the middle of the penalty box area allowing the centre-forwards to finish the job.
* Crossing: a main job of outside players, or players in the wide areas, especially forwards is their ability to cross the ball to the middle of the field in front of the goal for the central players to score from

Due to these responsibilities some of the most important attributes include:
* Good dribbling and circumventing defenders
* Speed as a necessity to produce effective counter-attacks
* Technical ability to strike a ball
* Quickness in deception to pass a defender 
* Striking technique to get on the end of crosses from wide players of the opposing side

==Winger==

A winger is an offensive player located in a wide position near the touchlines. They can be classified as forwards, considering their origin as the old &quot;outside-forward&quot; position, and continue to be termed as such in most parts of the world, especially in Latin and Dutch football cultures. However, in the British game (in which the 4–4–2 formation and its variants are most commonly used) they are usually counted as part of the midfield.

It is a winger&#x27;s duty to beat opposing full-backs, deliver cut-backs or crosses from wide positions and, to a lesser extent, to beat defenders and score from close range. They are usually some of the quickest players in the team and usually have good dribbling skills as well. In Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese usage, the defensive duties of the winger have been usually confined to pressing the opposition fullbacks when they have the ball. Otherwise, a winger will drop closer to the midfield to make themself available, should their team win back the ball.
In British and other northern European styles of football, the wide-midfielder is expected to track back all the way to their own corner flag should their full-back require help, and also to track back their marker, as well as tucking into the midfield when the more central players are trying to pressure the opposition for the ball. This is a large responsibility for attack-orientated players, and particularly those like Joaquín (winger/wide midfielder), or Ryan Giggs (winger/striker), and John Barnes (winger/central midfielder), who lack the physical attributes of a wing-back or of a more orthodox midfield player. As these players grow older and lose their natural pace, they are frequently redeployed as &quot;number 10s&quot; between the midfield and the forward line, where their well-honed ball control, technical skills, ability to create chances, and improved reading of the game in the final third can serve to improve their teams&#x27; attacking options in tight spaces. An example is Inter Milan&#x27;s use of veteran Luís Figo behind one or two other attackers, either as a second striker or in a playmaking role as an attacking midfielder.

In recent years there has been a trend of playing inverted wingers – wide players stationed on the &#x27;wrong&#x27; side of the pitch, in order to enable them to cut inside and shoot on their stronger foot and sometimes provide in-swinging crosses. This tactic was used by Frank Rijkaard, who, whilst at Barcelona, moved Lionel Messi from the left flank onto the right wing, initially against the player&#x27;s wishes. This allowed him to cut into the centre and shoot or cross with his left foot. Another example of a successful inverted winger partnership was Bayern Munich&#x27;s pairing of the left-footed Arjen Robben alongside the right-footed Franck Ribéry, on the right and left flanks respectively.

A description that has been used in the media to label a variation upon the inverted winger position is that of an &quot;attacking&quot;, &quot;false&quot;, or &quot;goalscoring winger&quot;, as exemplified by Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale&#x27;s roles on the left and right flank during their time at Real Madrid in particular. This label has been used to describe an offensive-minded inverted winger, who will seemingly operate out wide on paper, but who instead will be given the freedom to make unmarked runs into more advanced central areas inside the penalty area, in order to get on the end of passes and crosses and score goals, effectively functioning as a striker. This role is somewhat comparable to what is known as the &quot;raumdeuter&quot; role in German football jargon (literally &quot;space interpreter&quot;), as exemplified by Thomas Müller, namely an attacking-minded wide player, who will move into central areas in order to find spaces from which he can receive passes and score or assist goals.

The &quot;false winger&quot; or &quot;seven-and-a-half&quot; is instead a label which has been used to describe a type of player who normally plays centrally, but who instead is deployed out wide on paper; during the course of a match, however, they will move inside and operate in the centre of the pitch, in order to drag defenders out of position, congest the midfield and give their team a numerical advantage in this area, so that they can dominate possession in the middle of the pitch and create chances for the forwards; this position also leaves space for full-backs to make overlapping attacking runs up the flank. Samir Nasri, who has been deployed in this role, once described it as that of a &quot;non-axial playmaker&quot;.

On occasion, the role of an offensive winger can also be occupied by a different type of player. For example, certain managers have been known to use a &quot;wide target man&quot; on the wing, namely a large and physical player who usually plays as a centre-forward, and who will attempt to win aerial challenges and hold up the ball on the flank, or drag full-backs out of position. Jostein Flo epitomizes this role so much so that a tactic was named after him – Flo Pass. Egil Olsen, while managing the Norway national football team, positioned Flo, usually a centre-forward, on the right flank to exploit the opposition full-backs&#x27; lack of aerial abilities. Another example is Mario Mandžukić, a natural centre-forward, who was used on the left flank under manager Massimiliano Allegri at Juventus during the 2016–17 season, as well as the following season. Unlike wide target men of earlier eras, Mandžukić was also tasked with pressing opposing players. Romelu Lukaku has also been used in this role on occasion.

==False 9==

A &quot;false 9&quot;, similar to a more advanced attacking midfielder/playmaker role, is an unconventional lone striker or centre-forward, who drops deep into midfield. The purpose of this is that it creates a problem for opposing centre-backs who can either follow the false 9, leaving space behind them for onrushing midfielders, forwards or wingers to exploit, or leaving the false 9 to have time and space to dribble or pick out a pass. The term comes from the traditional number for centre-forwards (nine), and the fact that normally a centre-forward traditionally stayed near the line of defenders until they got an opportunity to move past them toward goal. Key attributes for a false 9 are similar to those of a deep-lying striker: dribbling ability to take advantage of space between the lines, good short passing ability to link up with the midfield and vision to play through teammates making runs from deep to goal.

The first false 9 in a World Cup was Juan Peregrino Anselmo in the Uruguay national team, although he could not play the match against Argentina in the 1930 World Cup due to injury. Matthias Sindelar was the false 9 of the &quot;Wunderteam&quot;, the Austria national team, in 1934. In South America, in 1941, River Plate&#x27;s La Máquina team started using the left winger Adolfo Pedernera as a man of reference. When Pedernera transferred to Atlanta, a young Alfredo Di Stéfano took his place. A false 9 was also utilised by Hungary at the beginning of the 1950s, with striker Nándor Hidegkuti acting in the role as a deep-lying centre forward. In 1953, English football was astounded by the Hungarian team which beat England 6–3 at Wembley Stadium. The Revie Plan was a variation on the tactics used by the Hungarians, involving Don Revie playing as a deep-lying centre-forward. Revie started attacks by coming into the centre of the field to receive the ball, drawing the opposing centre-half out of position. The role can also be compared to the false role in which Hidegkuti operated. The system was first implemented by the Manchester City reserve team, who using the system went unbeaten for the last 26 games of the 1953–54 season. Before the start of the 1954–55 season, Manchester City manager Les McDowall called his team into pre-season training two weeks early to try the new tactic. Manchester City lost their first game using the system 5–0, but as the players became more used to the system it started to become more successful. Using the system Manchester City reached the 1955 FA Cup Final, but lost to Newcastle United 3–1. The following year City again reached the final where they played Birmingham City, this time winning 3–1.

Throughout his career, Johan Cruyff was often deployed in a free role as a centre-forward with Ajax, Barcelona, and the Netherlands in the 1970s in Rinus Michels&#x27;s fluid 1–3–3–3 formation, which was a key and trademark feature of the manager&#x27;s &quot;total football&quot; system; although Cruyff was a prolific goalscorer in this position, he also frequently dropped deep to confuse his markers and orchestrate attacks, or moved out onto the wing in order to create space for other teammates&#x27; runs, which has led certain pundits to compare this role retroactively as a precursor to the modern false 9 role.

Michael Laudrup was occasionally used as a lone centre-forward in Johan Cruyff&#x27;s Barcelona &quot;Dream Team&quot;, a role which was similar to that of the modern false 9 role.

Roma under manager Luciano Spalletti used Francesco Totti, nominally an attacking midfielder or &quot;trequartista&quot;, up-front in an innovative &quot;4–6–0&quot; formation in the mid-2000s; this was met with a run of 11 consecutive victories.

At Euro 2012, Spain manager Vicente del Bosque, although sometimes deploying Fernando Torres as a traditional striker, often used Cesc Fàbregas as a false 9 in several matches, including the final. By the end of 2012, the false 9 had gone &quot;mainstream&quot; with many clubs employing a version of the system. Barcelona&#x27;s Lionel Messi has been an epitome of the false 9 position to much success in recent years, first under coach Pep Guardiola and later under his successor Tito Vilanova. Brazilian forward Roberto Firmino was later also successfully used in the false 9 position under manager Jürgen Klopp at Liverpool.

One approach to stop false 9s has been to create congestion in the midfield by bringing several players back into a more defensive role in an attempt to deny them space needed to create plays, notably in José Mourinho&#x27;s &quot;parking the bus&quot; strategy.

In Italian football jargon, this role is historically known as the &quot;centravanti di manovra&quot; (which literally translates to &quot;manoeuvring centre-forward&quot;), due to the player&#x27;s tendency to move freely and participate the build-up of attacking plays.

==Target forward==

The term &quot;target forward&quot; or &quot;target man&quot; is often used to describe a particular type of striker or centre-forward whose main role is to win high balls in the air, hold up the ball, and create chances for other members of the team in addition to scoring goals themselves. These players are usually tall and physically strong, adept at heading the ball, and capable of playing with their back to goal in the final third of the pitch. Some of the most high-profile examples of this type of players in modern football include Olivier Giroud and Fernando Llorente, both World Cup winners, with the former having played the entire tournament as a starting line-up forward tasked primarily with pressing, counter-pressing, winning high or loose balls, and providing key passes to quicker and more agile teammates, namely Antoine Griezmann or Kylian Mbappé. Another example of a striker who played in this position is Didier Drogba. However, not any tall and/or physically strong player feels comfortable in the role of a &quot;target man&quot;, despite having all the necessary features. Such forwards as Zlatan Ibrahimović, Romelu Lukaku, and Erling Haaland have all rejected the term when applied to specifically them, with Ibrahimović preferring to be described as an attacking all-rounder, while Lukaku and Haaland have said to favour poaching goals rather than physical play.

As stated above, the target forward is a player who does not run or look to make runs as compared to other forwards. Typically they are strong, tall, and physical players. Usually, the build-up play of a target forward will often consist of one of the following options: firstly, the goalkeeper will either launch a long kick or distribute the ball to a central defender or full-back. From there, the defender will play a long ball to the striker, either in the air or ground. The target forward usually has perfected their ability to provide first touches of the ball on all areas of the body. They will control the ball and provide holdup, which allows their teammates to transition forward. From here, they may create more opportunities such as passing the ball backwards and creating space by moving around defenders, making combination plays with a &quot;false 9&quot;, midfielders, or wingers, or turning and facing the goal and attempting to score by dribbling or shooting. Because of their strength and physicality, target forwards may be defended against by man-to-man marking. Sometimes the central defender of the opposing team will be of similar strength and height, which makes the matchup more evenly based. Due to this man-to-man marking, target forwards are often fouled and receive many calls from the referee.

==Striker combinations==
Strike teams consist of two or more strikers who work together. The history of football has been filled with many effective combinations. Three-man teams often operate in &quot;triangles&quot;, giving a wealth of attacking options. Four-man packages expand options even more. Strikers must also be flexible, and be able to switch roles at a moment&#x27;s notice, between the first (&quot;advanced penetrator position&quot;), second (&quot;deep-lying manoeuvre&quot;) and third (&quot;support and expansion, e.g. wings&quot;) attacker roles.

Another example was the Total Football played by the Dutch team in the 70s, where the ability of their players, and in particular Johan Cruyff, to swap positions allowed a flexible attacking approach which opposition teams found difficult to effectively mark.

In a two-player front line, it is common for two forwards who complement one another to be paired together; for example, former Italy manager Cesare Maldini often used a large, physical, and prolific player as a traditional centre-forward – such as Christian Vieri – alongside a smaller, faster, creative and more technical player as a second striker – such as Roberto Baggio or Alessandro Del Piero.
Another similar example of an effective partnership at international level was that of Alex Morgan and Abby Wambach with the United States national team, who scored a combined 55 goals in 2012, matching a 21-year-old record set in 1991 by Michelle Akers (39 goals) and Carin Jennings (16 goals) as the most goals scored by any duo in U.S. WNT history.

One of the most prolific forward combinations in the history of the game was the front three of Barcelona, Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Neymar, dubbed &quot;MSN&quot;. On average they scored a goal every 45 minutes – two goals per game from the three forwards. The trio scored a record-breaking 131 goals in one season for Barcelona during 2015–16. In 2017, Kylian Mbappé, Neymar, and Edinson Cavani scored a record-breaking number of goals for Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League group stage. The next year, the Liverpool attacking quartet of Roberto Firmino, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané and Philippe Coutinho, dubbed the &quot;Fab Four&quot; (in reference to the Beatles), contributed to a record-breaking 47 goals for a single Champions League season.

&quot;MSN&quot; is known to be one of the most successful striker combinations in the history of football. However, &quot;BBC&quot; was often compared as the same elite level of forwards. The combination consisted of Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale, and Cristiano Ronaldo. During the height of their success with Spanish team Real Madrid, they were frequently compared to &quot;MSN.&quot; The two striker combinations played on long time rivals teams Real Madrid and Barcelona, both of which are considered some of the best football clubs of all time. Of the prolific trio, Karim Benzema typically played the center forward position, while Ronaldo and Bale played as inverted or outside forwards, so they were able to cut into the center with their dominant side. Between the two trios Lionel Messi has won the most Ballon d&#x27;Or trophies, while Cristiano Ronaldo has won the second most of these trophies, at 5. BBC rivaled MSN throughout the 2010s in the La Liga, as well as the UEFA Champions League.

== Defensive capabilities ==
Although the striker is mainly an offensive position in many cases, they still play critical roles for defense that are often overlooked. Strikers can be involved in tactics such as high-pressing, cutting out passing lanes, defending set pieces, and tracking back (mostly for wingers). For high-pressure, this tactic is employed when the opposing team without the ball will defend the team all the way to their back line of defenders so that they have little area to pass or perform play buildup. Strikers will usually be at the forefront of this high-pressing movement and will attempt to direct ball movement. As part of this high-pressing technique, they can also cut out passing lanes. This means that they will position their bodies in-between an outside defender and central defender or midfielders and center defenders so that the opposing player is not able to pass the ball or make a play. By performing this method, they can effectively force the opposing team to one area of the pitch and create better opportunities for the opposing team to turn the ball over. They are heavily used in the &quot;delay, coverage, balance, and concentration principles of football&quot; through a variety of methods. According to the delay principle of defense in football is the idea that players should disturb the ball holder and block passing lanes, which is done in high-pressing and closing down. Closing down is the ability of a player to very quickly start defending the opposing player with the ball. This usually falls under the concentration principle of football, so strikers must be able to start defending the opposing team very high up in the opposing half. Although many believe strikers are not very involved in defensive strategies, they greatly help with &quot;gathering defense to protect vital zones from progression of offensive actions, direct play to less vital zones, and allow for a regain of ball possession.&quot;

<text>Mauril Adrien Jules Bélanger (June 15, 1955 – August 15, 2016) was a Canadian politician.

A member of the Liberal Party of Canada, he represented Ottawa—Vanier in the House of Commons through a by-election victory in 1995 until his death in 2016. Bélanger also served in cabinet during the premiership of Paul Martin as Minister responsible for Official Languages, Associate Minister of National Defence, Minister responsible for Democratic Reform, and Minister for Internal Trade.

He was considered a frontrunner for the position of Speaker of the House of Commons after his 8th electoral victory during the 2015 federal election, but withdrew after being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which caused his death in 2016.

== Early life ==
Bélanger was born the second of five children in Mattawa, Ontario, a small logging town in northeastern Ontario where the Mattawa and Ottawa Rivers meet. He graduated from the University of Ottawa in 1977, where he had served as President of the Student Federation. In the early 1980s, he worked for Jean-Luc Pépin, then Minister of Transport. In the mid to late 1980s, he worked as a registered investment advisor. He was then the Chief of Staff to Peter Clark (Chair of the Regional Council of Ottawa-Carleton).

== Politics ==
Bélanger was first elected to Parliament on February 13, 1995, in a by-election in the riding of Ottawa—Vanier, which has a large Francophone population. His predecessor, Jean-Robert Gauthier, was appointed to the Senate. Ottawa–Vanier is considered a solid Liberal riding, having returned a Liberal MP since its creation in 1935, usually in a landslide. Bélanger himself won by large margins in the 1997, 2000, 2004, 2006, and 2008 elections. He won re-election for a seventh term by a reduced margin with 38.2% of the vote in the May 2011 election. In the October 2015 election, Bélanger had his largest margin since the 1997 election.

=== Chrétien and Martin years ===
As member of Parliament, Bélanger served as Chair of the Standing Committee on Official Languages, member of the Standing Committee on the Library of Parliament and member of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Task Force on Urban Issues. From July 1998 to August 2000, he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage. In December 2003, he was appointed Deputy Leader of the Government in the House of Commons and Chief Government Whip.

In the government of Paul Martin, Bélanger served as Minister responsible for Official Languages, Associate Minister of National Defence, Minister responsible for Democratic Reform, and Minister for Internal Trade.

=== Opposition ===
Bélanger was re-elected in the 2006 federal election, and served as the Official Opposition critic for Canadian Heritage from February 2006 to January 2007, when he began a nine-month stint as critic for Infrastructure and Communities under new Liberal leader Stéphane Dion. From October 2007 to March 2008, Bélanger served as the Official Opposition critic for Official Languages, Canadian Heritage, and the Francophonie. After Bélanger won his seat once more in the 2008 federal election, he was appointed as Official Opposition critic for Official Languages in March 2010 by Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff. After Bélanger&#x27;s re-election in the 2011 federal election, he continued as his party&#x27;s critic on this file under interim leader Bob Rae until May 2012. After Justin Trudeau&#x27;s election as Liberal leader, Bélanger was appointed the party&#x27;s critic for Cooperatives in August 2013.

=== Return to government ===
Following his re-election in the 2015 federal election, Bélanger submitted his name for the position of Speaker of the House of Commons and was considered a front-runner for the post. However, on November 30, Bélanger announced that he was withdrawing as a candidate for speaker after he received a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite his diagnosis, Bélanger continued as MP for Ottawa—Vanier.

In December 2015, fellow Ottawa-area Liberal MP Andrew Leslie presented a motion in the house to name Bélanger honorary Speaker of the House of Commons and the right to sit in the chair for a future day. In January 2016, Bélanger became the first MP to use a voice generator in the House of Commons when he used an app on his tablet to introduce a private member&#x27;s bill to amend to lyrics of &quot;O Canada&quot; to make them gender-neutral, which he had failed to do through a similar bill in the last parliament by a 144–127 vote. On March 9, 2016, Bélanger sat in the Speaker&#x27;s chair for one day, and presided over the proceedings with the aid of an iPad app that produced a computerized voice. This honour made Bélanger the first honorary speaker of the house for a day.

On May 6, 2016, consideration of Bélanger&#x27;s bill to make the national anthem gender neutral was blocked when Conservative MPs used up the hour of debate time and refused consent to two motions backed by both the Liberals and the NDP to extend debate and allow time to hold a vote to send the bill to committee. As Bélanger&#x27;s health was deteriorating, Liberal MP Greg Fergus described the Conservative&#x27;s procedural delay tactics as an attempt to prevent Bélanger from seeing the bill passed, while Conservative MPs insisted that they were debating an important issue and had followed parliamentary procedure. Fellow Liberal MP Linda Lapointe gave up her timeslot for private member&#x27;s business on May 30 to allow Bélanger&#x27;s bill to be heard and go to a vote for it to be sent to committee the following day. In June 2016, the bill passed its third reading with a vote of 225 to 74 in the House of Commons. In July 2017, the bill was in its third, and final, reading in the Senate; the bill was passed on January 31, 2018 and received royal assent on February 7, 2018 to change &quot;in all thy sons command&quot; to &quot;in all of us command&quot;, after Bélanger had already died.

===Positions===
Bélanger earned recognition for his promotion of francophone rights. In 2012, Bélanger asked the House of Commons to create a committee to examine the role of co-ops in the Canadian economy. This motion was unanimously passed by the House of Commons. He presided over the Canadian House of Commons for one day as an honorary Speaker on March 9, 2016, a job he aspired to before his diagnosis with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Later that year, Bélanger became the National Honorary Spokesperson for the ALS Societies&#x27; Across Canada WALK for ALS.

==Honours==
He was given the title of Commandeur de Ordre de la Pléiade, a francophone order which focuses on contributions made to international friendship and cooperation, in 2005. In 2007, László Sólyom, President of Hungary, made him an Officer of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary. In April 2009, the Royal Canadian Legion recognized Bélanger for his contribution to the promotion of goodwill. In June 2016, Bélanger received the CHF Canada Award for Outstanding Contribution to Co-operative Housing for effecting positive, large scale change to the co-op housing sector. It was also published within the Canada Gazette of 30 July 2016 that he was awarded with the Grand Cross of the National Order of Honour and Merit, Silver Plaque of the Republic of Haiti.

==Death==
Bélanger died at age 61 of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis on August 15, 2016. He was survived by his wife, Catherine. He was succeeded in the by-election by Mona Fortier.

<doc id="428689" wikidata="Q1772550" url="?curid=428689" title="International Socialists (Norway)">
<text>The International Socialists () was a Trotskyist organisation in Norway founded in the early 1980s. It was part of the International Socialist Tendency led by the British Socialist Workers Party.

The roots of the IS date from the late 1970s when a revolutionary opposition began forming within Socialist Youth (SU), the youth organization of the reformist Socialist Left Party. This opposition was essentially an alliance between two distinct factions: the one influenced by the politics of the British Socialist Workers Party, the other with strong syndicalist tendencies. What united the two was their opposition to the reformist politics of the mother organization (SV), a strong orientation towards the working class, a focus on “revolutionary praksis”, and a clear rejection of the Stalinist politics of the Moscow-oriented Communist Party (Communist Party of Norway) and the Beijing-oriented Maoist party Workers&#x27; Communist Party.

By early 1980 the Socialist Youth opposition had won control of both the Oslo branch and the organization’s monthly magazine, &quot;Ungsosialisten&quot;. It also had considerable support in the local branches in Bergen, Trondheim, and Tromsø. On November 13, 1981, at the 6th Annual Conference of the Socialist Youth, the national leaderships of the Socialist Youth and the Socialist Left took action to rid themselves of the opposition by formally disbanding the youth organization and then reestablishing it the next day at a different location.

A week later the opposition constituted itself as an independent organization under the name &quot;Arbeidermaktgruppa&quot; (AMG, “Workers Power Group”) and started publication of a monthly newspaper called &quot;Arbeidermakt&quot;. Shortly thereafter, AMG was joined by small group of Trotskyists, adherents of the Fourth International.

AMG had an orientation towards activism and intervened in house occupations, strikes and other forms of protest. At the same time, considerable effort was put into theoretical discussions, in an attempt to reconcile the different positions of the three constituent tendencies. This was to no avail, however, and in February 1985, a large minority split away to form Internasjonale Sosialister (IS).

The first issue of the new group’s bimonthly magazine, &quot;Internasjonal sosialisme&quot;, published in February 1985, was unapologetically inward-looking and presented an extensive overview of IS’ theoretical foundation, with major articles by Knut Øygard, Ellisiv Rognlien, Helge Ryggvik, Øivind Østberg, and Steve Pepper on the need for a revolutionary party; the relationship between the party, the unions and the “movements”; and the theory of State Capitalism. Subsequent issues combine analysis of current events with articles about the revolutionary tradition.

Through the 1980s and into the 1990s the IS experienced a steady increase in its membership. There were branches in all the main cities in mid- and southern Norway. IS played an active part in the struggle against racism and neo-nazism, and was particularly known for its role in a wildcat strike in the transport sector in Oslo, where the workers in the end won against blacklegs, police and their bosses. &quot;Internasjonal sosialisme&quot; went from being a bimonthly magazine to a monthly and weekly newspaper, changing its name to &quot;Sosialistisk arbeideravis&quot; in the mid-90s.

In the early 2000s IS seems to have experienced difficulties, losing some members through a split in 2001 and others who disappeared when the organization put all its efforts into founding the new organisation ATTAC some years later. Unable to balance its membership between those two organisations, this seemed like an act of liquidation for the IS in Norway. In 2004 they announced that they would be abandoning production of their fortnightly paper in order to concentrate on producing a monthly magazine named &quot;Gnisten&quot;. As of April 2006, 14 issues of &quot;Gnisten&quot; had appeared and IS was planning a new event in its annual series of “Socialism from Below” seminars.

Recognizing the need for an effective parliamentary left party, IS decided at their general assembly 12–13 January 2008 to join Red.

<doc id="428690" wikidata="Q2571698" url="?curid=428690" title="World War II Online">
<text>World War II Online: Blitzkrieg is a World War II massively multiplayer online first-person shooter (MMOFPS) developed by Playnet, Inc.&#x27;s internal game studio, &quot;Cornered Rat Software&quot;, and it was originally released on June 6, 2001 for Microsoft Windows, with a Mac OS version being released in 2002. In 2005, &quot;WWII Online&quot; was re-released under the new name of WWII Online: Battleground Europe.

In the summer of 2017, &quot;WWII Online&quot; was released on Steam Early Access where it once again returned its name back to the original &quot;WWII Online&quot;.

As of June 2021 the developers were working to port WWII Online from its proprietary engine to the Unreal Engine 5 in an effort to modernize graphics and workflows.

==Gameplay==
&quot;WWII Online&quot; is set in 1940–1944 World War II in Western Europe. It is a virtual battlefield and a combined arms war simulation. A player can command or crew a variety of accurately modeled aircraft; armored fighting vehicles, anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft artillery, four naval vessels, fight as a foot-soldier with a variety of infantry weapons, or play as a paratrooper and drop from either a C-47 or Ju 52 transport aircraft. All vehicles with two or more positions may be multi-crewed by two players.

The game is played in real time alongside or against other players as either German, American, British or French forces in a persistent world. Command structures and missions provide strategic and tactical layers while ranks provide a RPG layer by demonstrating leadership roles. It uses a single, non-instanced, ½ scale map of western Europe with approximately of accurate terrain in which capturable cities, airfields and ports have been placed.

=== Players and units ===
&quot;WWII Online&quot; is team-oriented. Players play as various troops, pilots, gunners, tank commanders, naval destroyer captains, mission leaders, and high commanders, and are organized into brigades. Everyone plays in the brigade of their choice. Smaller military units of heavily themed squads are independently managed by players and can use their own tactics, but follow the brigade and strategic rules set by the high command players and cooperate with other squads and non-squad players. Being a squad member is optional but encouraged. Some squads have vigorous membership rites. Anyone that has a paid account can, however, form their own squad, solicit members and register the squad with the high command for brigade assignment.

Each player holds a title of rank, based on the military ranks of the time. Ranks are gained through a performance-based scoring system. Rank is never lost as a result of an unsuccessful mission or death.

Detailed statistics are tracked by the server, and made available through a web interface, known as &#x27;Combat Statistics and Records&#x27;, or CSR. Statistics are very detailed, recording a history of every mission the player has attempted over the campaign. Summary statistics are available to compare player performance to those of other players. Statistics include elements such as number of kills, damages, deaths, time spent on each mission, and depot captures. The top 100 players for several categories are updated regularly.

Communication between players via text is supported by a variety of communication channels for messages exchanged between players. Default channels are Target (players will communicate with others whose missions target a town and its linked facilities), Mission (all players who chose a mission created by the same person), squad (a voluntary group similar to a clan in other online games), Brigade (not commonly used), Operations (for Tactical/Strategic information and discussions) and Side (for more general and sometimes off-topic chat). There is also a Help channel which is tuned by default for new players. Numbered text channels can also be manually connected to. Each side&#x27;s Air Force and Navy have designated numbered channels. Some squads who often play together use specific channels for inter-squad communication, and a particular coordinated effort between many the side&#x27;s High Command, players, various squads and/or various military branches may decide to use a specific numbered channel, as their Target channels may be quite different. Additionally, it is common for players to communicate via the WWII Online Discord since cooperation with other players can be critical for success.

===Playable equipment and damage model===

&quot;WWII Online&quot; has a variety of playable equipment, each modeled with data from historical references. In total, there are currently 250 different playable weapons. Like in many other RPGs, more equipment becomes available as the player gains more experience. New recruits start with a limited equipment selection. As the player progresses in rank, better vehicles and more infantry classes become available.

The damage model in &quot;WWII Online&quot; is realism based, as explained in this developer demonstration video. Within the limits of modern technology, it simulates real world kinetic damage to the game world. Vehicles are modeled with their essential critical components, such as engine, fuel tanks, etc. The components interact as if they were the real machine. For example, a punctured fuel tank will cause loss of fuel which will eventually cause the engine to run out of fuel causing the engine to stop. Leaking fuel within the vehicle can be set on fire by subsequent or existing damage to other parts of the vehicle, resulting in the tank &quot;brewing up&quot; and possibly exploding. Damaged components also provide feedback into the simulation model. For example, for aircraft, damage to flight surfaces will result in increased drag and reduced performance of the vehicle. Vehicles are modeled, within reasonable technical limits, to historically accurate detail.

The ballistic model is also detailed, taking into account drag coefficient properties, muzzle velocity, and mass of each individual type of ammunition. The game engine considers the physical details of all rounds in flight and at point of impact, calculating the angle of impact and energy of the round, and the thickness and slope of the target vehicle&#x27;s armor. Rounds which manage to penetrate may go on to cause damage to components or crew members in the path of penetration. High energy rounds that do not fully penetrate may still cause spall (high velocity metal fragments) within the vehicle, if close enough to penetration. Rounds that penetrate a vehicle will usually leave a visible hole on the outside, while rounds that don&#x27;t penetrate may leave a scuff mark where the round bounced off. Small arms fire will also often leave bullet holes or scuff marks on buildings or vehicles.

===Strategic layer (High Command)===
Both sides in &quot;WWII Online&quot; have player-run groups, known as the High Command (HC), responsible for strategic management of the side&#x27;s forces. High Command players have their own avatar. When HC players broadcast on the Ops channel a small &quot;HC&quot; symbol is displayed rather than the British/French/German side&#x27;s symbol. An in-game list of all currently logged in HC players is available.

HC players have abilities that are not available to the rest of the playerbase, namely in the placing of Attack Objectives (AOs). When an AO is placed on a town, the other side gets an automatic Defence Objective (DO) on that town allowing all players to know that it is under attack. 10 minutes after an AO is first placed on a town, the town&#x27;s Depot Office building, City Office building, and Rail Road Office buildings all become capturable. These capturable buildings are collectively known as Capture Points (CPs). Entering the Flag building linked to an Office building (marked with a large flag) will show an attacker how long it will take for the building to become capturable.

To capture a building, attackers must remain inside the Flag Building until the capture bar has hit 100%. If more than one player (up to eight) are inside the flag building, the bar will move faster. Additional attackers past the eighth have no effect on the capture speed. Defenders must kill all attackers in the flag building to start liberating the facility. Any attackers who enter the building (even if it is currently being liberated) start the capture bar moving up again. Capturing a flag gives the attacking side control of the corresponding building linked to the Office. If the Office links to a Depot that has a link to a friendly town, the Depot is referred to as &quot;Spawnable&quot; and players may spawn from new missions there, making them an important objective. Players may also despawn near a friendly depot and respawn inside it, called &quot;Warping&quot;. This allows attackers to set up a Mobile Spawn Point near a non-spawnable depot and warp directly into it, avoiding any heavy defenses around the spawnable depots.

Ten minutes after an Office is captured, the town&#x27;s Army Bunkers, Airfield Bunkers, Docks and Factories become capturable. The attacking side must continuously hold one flag in the town for this to happen. It does not have to be the same flag, they may capture two, lose one, capture another, lose the first, in any combination as long as they continue to hold at least one flag for ten minutes. Once all the town&#x27;s Office buildings, Army Bunkers, Airfield Bunkers, Docks and Factories are captured, the AO and DO are lifted and the town changes ownership to the attacking side. All towns have an Army Base, some on rivers have Docks, some with large historical airfields have Airfields with a command bunker, and some important industrial towns have Factories.

AOs can also be placed on bridges. An AO on a bridge enables that side to destroy it, while a DO allows it to be repaired. Bombers and Naval Destroyers are usually tasked with blowing up bridges, while sapper (engineer) units must repair them. Bridges repair slowly if left alone.

High Command players are able to move their side&#x27;s &quot;brigades&quot; along road links between friendly towns. Each brigade can be moved once every Hour if in a frontline town, or every half an hour if in a non-frontline town. A friendly brigade in a town allows players to spawn in that town to either defend or attack. Naval and Air Force brigades are considered &quot;Self-Deployable&quot; and can move directly from any town to another with the right Docks or Air Field facilities, as long as the destination town is held by friend forces and is not cut off from the main friendly-held area.

Each army division has a headquarters (HQ) unit and three combat brigades. Two of the brigades are Infantry brigades (with a high proportion of infantry and artillery, with only light tanks) and one brigade is classified as Armoured (with a high proportion of heavy and medium tanks and fewer infantry and artillery). The HQ unit is mostly used to resupply the other three brigades, and is vulnerable when placed on the front line by itself. It is common practice to attach the armoured brigade to one of the infantry brigades and use the HQ unit to resupply both.

The game&#x27;s movement rules only allow the brigades to be moved to a friendly town that is no more than 1 town away from another brigade or the HQ in its own Division. The rule though does not apply in the case that the brigade is the only one left in its division and if this occurs it is free to move to any surrounding town. This occurs through the routing of brigades. Routing removes brigades from the game map for 6 hours and can happen in a few ways. Brigades in a division will normally &quot;fallback&quot; if the AB is captured, but only if the game&#x27;s movement rules allow it, that is, move to within 1 link of a brigade or HQ in its own division. If none of the surrounding friendly towns are within 1 link of a brigade within its own division when the AB is captured, then the brigade will be routed off the game map for 6 hours.

High Command players that are Commanding Officers (CO) of a Brigade or higher can give out side-wide messages known as dot Axis or dot Allied messages. They are named thus as the command to type one out is, &quot;.axis&quot; or &quot;.allied&quot;. These messages are seen by all players on a side and are used for a number of purposes. The usual purpose of the message is to inform players of important battles. The message will tell players what town is being attacked or defended, what brigade or brigades are involved, who the Officer in Command (OIC) of the attack or defence is and what chat and possibly Team Speak channels are being used. Most high command players liven their messages up beyond just the generic and quite humorous messages can often be seen. These messages can also be used to boost the &quot;morale&quot; of the troops by telling them how well they have been fighting and to announce future Operations that are being planned.

==History==
=== Initial release ===
The game is commonly recognized as the first MMOFPS. Following the purchase of Interactive Creations of Grapevine&#x27;s &quot;WarBirds&quot; by IEntertainment Network in 1999, several of the developers departed the company and formed new gaming companies. Some went to form Hitech Creations, while others went with John &quot;Killer&quot; MacQueen, Jonathon &quot;Hoof&quot; Hoof, Chris &quot;Mo&quot; Sherland to leverage their experience on &quot;WarBirds&quot; and &quot;Raider Wars&quot; to develop an online gaming network (G2 Network) with a massively-multiplayer first-person WWII simulation for both PC and Mac as the showpiece. After a lengthy closed beta stage, &quot;WWII Online&quot; went live on June 6, 2001 under the campaign title &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;. The release was timed to coincide with the anniversary of the D-Day.

Like most online games, &quot;WWII Online&quot; is a continual work in progress, and so has a history of updates that are frequently released to add new features, fix problems and improve existing features. Updates, or patches to the game code, were released every 6 weeks, on average, but recently have moved to a less frequent but larger content format of 3 or 4 times a year. These patches generally include a wide range of features and problem fixes. Everything from new weapons and vehicles to audits of the performances of existing weapons and vehicles are part of the patching process as well as terrain, structure, game play and performance improvements.

The initial launch had a number of technical difficulties. The game required that players download a 70 MB update before they could play online. At the time, the majority of users had 56k modems, requiring around three hours to update the game. As the developers worked feverishly behind the scenes to complete other promised features and fix the software bugs on the gold CD, even more updates became necessary. Three days prior to release, the colocation network facility had a bad fiber optic cable. This failure reduced the player capacity of the server cluster, from 10,000 players down to only 1200 players. As a temporary workaround, Playnet set up multiple copies of the game-world on different servers, distributing the network load, but at some cost in game play. This solution lasted for several months while the developers resolved the server-side issues, after which all servers were merged into a single game-world. Some features advertised on the game box were partially implemented, or missing, such as rank and high-command strategic features.

The combination of the above problems resulted in game returns, complaints from customers, and a drop-off in sales as word spread of the game&#x27;s state. Subscription fees for the first several months were waived, until the major problems with the game were resolved. This helped to retain many of the players, especially the long-term fans of the project, but it was not long before Playnet had financial problems. They filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late 2001, and cut costs, resulting in a number of lay-offs within the company. Statements from both the developer (CRS), and publisher (Strategy First), indicated that CRS wanted a longer open beta, but the game was launched anyway, due to financial reasons.

===Re-release===

&quot;WWII Online&quot; completed a third retail release in 2005 under the new campaign title &quot;Battleground Europe&quot;. This new title was chosen because of legal considerations with the old title of &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;, whose trademark was owned by another game. The Battleground Europe re-release was distributed across Europe in late 2005 and in the United States in early 2006 by the game&#x27;s new publishers GMX Media (Europe) and Matrix Games (USA). &quot;WWII Online: Battleground Europe&quot; was largely a compilation of fixes already available through patches to the original game, but compared to the initial 2001 release, the game was drastically different due to these changes.

In summer 2017, &quot;WWII Online&quot; was released on Steam Early Access.

== Guinness World Records ==
* First MMO first-person shooter (FPS) videogame
* First massively multiplayer online war game
* Largest playable area in a shooter videogame

==Reception==
The PC version received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Kevin Rice of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the game, &quot;A huge learning curve coupled with low gratification and zero organization make[s] this a title only for those with the patience of a saint.&quot;

<doc id="428691" wikidata="Q2053171" url="?curid=428691" title="International Socialists (Netherlands)">
<text>International Socialists (, abbreviated IS) is a revolutionary, Trotskyist organisation in the Netherlands. It is part of the International Socialist Tendency led by the British Socialist Workers Party.

== History ==
The International Socialists were founded in 1988 as &quot;Groep Internationale Socialisten&quot; (GIS). In the 1990s and early 2000s the organisation was mostly active in anti-fascist organising (against the Centrum Democraten, Pim Fortuyn and Geert Wilders) and anti-war protests, for instance against the Iraq War. in 2006 the group attempted to enter the Socialist Party (SP), however this project was abandoned after the SP leadership forced the IS members to choose between their SP membership or their IS membership. Eventually it was decided by the SP that dual membership of the SP and IS was prohibited.

==Ideology==
The IS believes that real change in the Netherlands can only come through revolution, although it is not opposed in principle to electoral work. It does not participate in such work at present, but believes in an activist party. The IS sees itself as standing in the tradition of people like Leon Trotsky, Vladimir Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg. It is anti-capitalist, anti-war and in general against &quot;all ideas that put people against people&quot;, like racism, sexism and homophobia. Currently, the &quot;Internationale Socialisten&quot; are largely active in the anti-war and anti-racism movements, as well as in the resistance against the austerity measures of the rightwing minority government of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy of prime-minister Mark Rutte and the Christian Democratic Appeal, which is supported by the Party for Freedom of Geert Wilders and the Reformed Political Party. 
Politically, the IS is located on the left of more mainstream leftwing parties like the Socialistische Partij and GroenLinks. It is part of the International Socialist Tendency, which also includes the British Socialist Workers Party.

==Activities==
Every year, the IS organises its own &#x27;Marxism Festival&#x27;, which is open to anybody interested, in which the more theoretical issues of socialism and activism are discussed. It also holds regular discussion meetings and is often present at political meetings organised by other groups, either invited or uninvited.

Internationally, the IS has taken part in the first two European Social Forums held in Florence and Paris, and is often active in international protests.

<doc id="428692" wikidata="Q611570" url="?curid=428692" title="Bushmills, County Antrim">
<text>Bushmills (From Irish &quot;Muileann na Buaise&quot;) is a village on the north coast of County Antrim, Northern Ireland. Bushmills had a population of 1,247 in the 2021 Census. It is located from Belfast, from Ballycastle and from Coleraine. The village owes its name to the River Bush and to a large watermill that was built there in the early 17th century. It is home to the Old Bushmills Distillery, which produces Irish whiskey, and is near the Giant&#x27;s Causeway.

==Demography==
===2021 Census===
Bushmills is labelled as Super Data Zone Causeway_C by Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency. On Census day (21 March 2021) there were 1,247 people living in Bushmills. Of these:

* 89.1% were from a &#x27;Protestant and Other Christian (including Christian related)&#x27; community background and 2.7% were from a Catholic community background.
*75.0% identified as British, 2.6% identified as Irish and 34.5% identified as Northern Irish (Respondents could choose more than one national identity).

===2011 Census===
Bushmills is classified as a village (population 1,000–2,499) by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). On Census day (27 March 2011) there were 1,295 people living in Bushmills. Of these:
* 20.39% were under 16 years old and 21.47% were aged 65 and above.
* 46.64% of the population were male and 53.36% were female.
* 92.90% were from a &#x27;Protestant and Other Christian (including Christian related)&#x27; community background and 3.47% were from a Catholic community background.

==Places of interest==
The village is best known as the location of the Old Bushmills Distillery. The distillery&#x27;s products include the Bushmills Original and Black Bush blends, as well as the 10-, 12-, 16-, and 21-year-old Bushmills Single Malts. To celebrate the 400th anniversary of distilling starting in the area the distillery released a unique whiskey called the &quot;1608&quot; which included crystal malt. The distillery draws its water, not from the River Bush itself, but from a tributary known as Saint Columbs Rill.

The Giant&#x27;s Causeway, which attracts over two million visitors per year, is located north of the town.

==Transport==
Bushmills railway station opened on 28 January 1883, but finally closed on 1 October 1949. There is a narrow-gauge steam train running in the summer from Bushmills to the Giant&#x27;s Causeway.

The Belfast-Derry railway line run by Northern Ireland Railways connects to Coleraine and along the branch line to Portrush. Local Ulsterbus provides connections to the railway stations. There is a scenic walk of 7 miles from Portrush alongside Dunluce Castle and the Giant&#x27;s Causeway and Bushmills Railway.

==Twin towns==
Bushmills is twinned with Louisville, Kentucky, in the United States.

==Education==
Schools in the area include Dunluce School and Bushmills Primary School.

==Churches==
There are a few churches in the village:

*Bushmills Presbyterian Church, Main Street, Magheraboy (1646)
*Bushmills Gospel Hall, Priestland Road, Ballaghmore
*Bushmills Free Presbyterian Church, Priestland Road, Walk Mill
*St. John The Baptist Church of Ireland, Priestland Road, Glebe (1821)
*St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Priestland Road, Ballaghmore

== Notable people ==
*Norman Parke, a Mixed Martial Artist who fights in the UFC, was born and raised in Bushmills.
*Caroline McElnay, Director of Public Health for the New Zealand Ministry of Health, was born and raised in Bushmills.

==Navigation history==
Bushmills was the location of one of the five Consol Navigation System transmitter stations in the years following the Second World War.

<doc id="428693" wikidata="Q669057" url="?curid=428693" title="Dot (diacritic)">
<text>When used as a diacritic mark, the term dot refers to the glyphs &quot;combining dot above&quot; (), and &quot;combining dot below&quot; ()
which may be combined with some letters of the extended Latin alphabets in use in 
a variety of languages. Similar marks are used with other scripts.

==Overdot==
Language scripts or transcription schemes that use the dot above a letter as a diacritical mark:

* In some forms of Arabic romanization, stands for &quot;ghayn&quot; (غ).
* The Latin orthography for Chechen includes &quot;ċ&quot;, &quot;ç̇&quot;, &quot;ġ&quot;, &quot;q̇&quot; and &quot;ẋ&quot;, corresponding to Cyrillic &quot;цӏ&quot;, &quot;чӏ&quot;, &quot;гӏ&quot;, &quot;къ&quot; and &quot;хь&quot; and representing , , , and respectively.
* Traditional Irish typography, where the dot denotes lenition, and is called a or &quot;dot of lenition&quot;: &quot;ḃ ċ ḋ ḟ ġ ṁ ṗ ṡ ṫ&quot;. Alternatively, lenition may be represented by a following letter &quot;h&quot;, thus: &quot;bh ch dh fh gh mh ph sh th&quot;. In Old Irish orthography, the dot was used only for &quot;ḟ ṡ&quot;, while the following &quot;h&quot; was used for &quot;ch ph th&quot;; lenition of other letters was not indicated. Later the two systems spread to the entire set of lenitable consonants and competed with each other. Eventually the standard practice was to use the dot when writing in Gaelic script and the following &quot;h&quot; when writing in antiqua. Thus &quot;ċ&quot; and &quot;ch&quot; represent the same phonetic element in Modern Irish.
* is pronounced as , as opposed to &quot;ę&quot;, which is pronounced a lower (formerly nasalised), or &quot;e&quot;, pronounced .
* Livonian uses &quot;ȯ&quot; as one of its eight vowels, pronounced as .
* is used for a voiceless palato-alveolar affricate, &quot;ġ&quot; for a voiced palato-alveolar affricate, and &quot;ż&quot; for a voiced alveolar sibilant.
* Old English: In modernized orthography, &quot;ċ&quot; is used for a voiceless palato-alveolar affricate , &quot;ġ&quot; for a palatal approximant (probably a voiced palatal fricative in the earliest texts), and (more rarely) &quot;sċ&quot; for a voiceless palato-alveolar fricative and &quot;cġ&quot; for a voiced palato-alveolar affricate .
* is used for a voiced retroflex sibilant .
* The Siouan languages such as Lakota, Osage, and Crow sometimes use the dot above to indicate ejective stops.
* In the Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics orthography for the Cree, Ojibwe, and Inuktitut languages, a dot above a symbol signifies that the symbol&#x27;s vowel should be a long vowel—the equivalent effect using the Roman orthography is achieved by doubling the vowel (ᒥ = mi, ᒦ = mii), placing a macron over the vowel (ᑲ = ka, ᑳ = kā), or placing a circumflex over the vowel (ᓄ = no, ᓅ = nô).
* In Turkish, the dot above lowercase &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; (and uppercase &quot;İ&quot;) is not regarded as an independent diacritic but as an integral part of the letter. It is called a tittle. I without an overdot is a separate letter.
* In the Rheinische Dokumenta phonetic writing system overdots denote a special pronunciation of &quot;r&quot;.
* The Ulithian alphabet includes &quot;ȧ&quot;, &quot;ė&quot;, and &quot;ȯ&quot;.
* The ISO 9 (1968) Romanization of Cyrillic uses &quot;ė&quot;, &quot;ḟ&quot;, and &quot;ẏ&quot;.
* In the ISO 259 Romanization of Hebrew, the overdot is used to transcribe the dagesh: ; transcribes the shuruk.
* In IAST and National Library at Calcutta romanization transcribing languages of India, &quot;ṅ&quot; is used to represent .
* UNGEGN romanization of Urdu includes ṙ.
* In the Venda language, &quot;ṅ&quot; is used to represent .
* Some countries use the overdot as a decimal mark.
* The overdot is also used in the Devanagari script, where it is called anusvara.

In mathematics and physics, when using Newton&#x27;s notation the dot denotes the time derivative as in formula_1. In addition, the overdot is one way used to indicate an infinitely repeating set of numbers in decimal notation, as in formula_2, which is equal to the fraction , and formula_3 or formula_4, which is equal to .

==Underdot==

* In a number of languages, an underdot indicates a raised or relatively high vowel, often the counterpart of a lower vowel marked with an ogonek or left unmarked.
** In Rotuman, &quot;ạ&quot; represents /ɔ/.
** In Romagnol, &quot;ẹ ọ&quot; are used to represent [e, o], e.g. part of Riminese dialect &quot;fradẹll, ọcc&quot; &quot;brothers, eyes&quot;.
** In academic notation of Old Latin, &quot;ẹ̄&quot; (&quot;e&quot; with underdot and macron) represents the long vowel, probably , that developed from the early Old Latin diphthong &quot;ei&quot;. This vowel usually became &quot;ī&quot; in Classical Latin.
** In academic transcription of Vulgar Latin, used in describing the development of the Romance languages, ẹ and ọ represent the close-mid vowels and , in contrast with the open-mid vowels and , which are represented as &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; with ogonek (ę ǫ).
** Academic transcription of Middle English uses the same conventions as Vulgar Latin above.
** In academic transcription of Serbo-Croatian dialects, &quot;ẹ ọ ạ&quot; (typically ) represent higher vowels than standard &quot;e o a&quot;, and the first two often contrast with lower vowels marked with a comma below, &quot;e̦ o̦&quot; (typically ).
* In Inari Sami, an underdot denotes a half-long voiced consonant: &quot;đ̣, j̣, ḷ, ṃ, ṇ, ṇj, ŋ̣, ṛ&quot;, and &quot;ṿ&quot;. The underdot is used in dictionaries, textbooks, and linguistic publications only.
* In IAST and National Library at Calcutta romanization, transcribing languages of India, a dot below a letter distinguishes the retroflex consonants &quot;ṭ, ḍ, ṛ, ḷ, ṇ, ṣ&quot;, while &quot;m&quot; with underdot (&quot;ṃ&quot;) signifies an &quot;anusvara&quot; and &quot;h&quot; with underdot (&quot;ḥ&quot;) signifies a &quot;visarga&quot;. Very frequently (in modern transliterations of Sanskrit) an underdot is used instead of the ring (diacritic) below the vocalic &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l&quot;.
* In romanizations of some Afroasiatic languages, particularly Semitic Languages and Berber Languages, an underdot indicates an emphatic consonant. The romanization of Arabic uses .
* In the DIN 31636 and ALA-LC Romanization of Hebrew, &quot;ṿ&quot; represents vav (ו), while &quot;v&quot; without the underdot represents beth (ב). &quot;ḳ&quot; represents qoph (ק) while &quot;k&quot; represents kaph (כ). ḥ represents chet (ח). 
* The underdot is also used in the PDA orthography for Domari to show pharyngealization—the underdotted consonants represent the emphaticized sounds .
*In Asturian, &quot;ḷḷ&quot; (underdotted double &quot;ll&quot;) represents the voiced retroflex plosive or the voiceless retroflex affricate, depending on dialect, and &quot;ḥ&quot; (underdotted &quot;h&quot;) the voiceless glottal fricative.
*In the O&#x27;odham language, &quot;Ḍ&quot; (&quot;d&quot; with underdot) represents a voiced retroflex stop.
*In Vietnamese, The &quot;nặng&quot; tone (low, glottal) is represented with a dot below the base vowel: &quot;ạ ặ ậ ẹ ệ ị ọ ộ ợ ụ ự ỵ&quot;.
* In Igbo, an underdot can be used on &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, and &quot;u&quot; to make &quot;ị&quot;, &quot;ọ&quot;, and &quot;ụ&quot;. The underdot symbolizes a reduction in the vowel height.
* In Yoruba, an underdot can be used on &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; to make &quot;ẹ&quot; and &quot;ọ&quot;, symbolizing a reduction in the vowel height, as well as on &quot;s&quot; to make &quot;ṣ&quot;, symbolizing a postalveolar articulation.
* In Americanist phonetic notation, &quot;x&quot; with underdot &quot;x̣&quot; represents a voiceless uvular fricative.
* Underdots are used in the Rheinische Dokumenta phonetic writing system to denote a voiced &quot;s&quot; and special pronunciations of &quot;r&quot; and &quot;a&quot;.
* In the Fiero-Rhodes orthography for Eastern Ojibwe and Odaawaa, in &quot;g̣&quot;, &quot;ḥ&quot;, and &quot;ḳ&quot;, underdot is used to indicate labialization when either or following them was lost in syncope.
* The Sicilian nexus &quot;ḍḍ&quot; is used to represent .
* In Kalabari, &quot;ḅ&quot; and &quot;ḍ&quot; are used.
* In Marshallese, underdots on consonants represent velarization, such as the velarized bilabial nasal &quot;ṃ&quot;.
* UNGEGN romanization of Urdu includes &quot;ḍ, g̣, ḳ, ṭ, ẉ&quot;, and &quot;ỵ&quot;. 
* In Mizo, &quot;ṭ&quot; represents .
* The underdot is also used in the Devanagari script, where it is called nukta.

==Raised dot and middle dot ==
* In Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics, in addition to the middle dot as a letter, centred dot diacritic, and dot above diacritic, there also is a two-dot diacritic in the Naskapi language representing /_w_V/ which depending on the placement on the specific Syllabic letter may resemble a colon when placed vertically, diaeresis when placed horizontally, or a combination of middle dot and dot above diacritic when placed either at an angle or enveloping a small raised letter . Additionally, in Northwestern Ojibwe, a small raised /wi/ as /w/, the middle dot is raised farther up as either or ; there also is a raised dot &quot;Final&quot; (), which represents /w/ in some Swampy Cree and /y/ in some Northwestern Ojibwe.

==Side dot==
The diacritics 〮 and 〯 , known as Bangjeom (), were used to mark pitch accents in Hangul for Middle Korean. They were written to the left of a syllable in vertical writing and above a syllable in horizontal writing.

<text>Coleraine ( ; from , &#x27;nook of the ferns&#x27;) is a town and civil parish near the mouth of the River Bann in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It is north-west of Belfast and east of Derry, both of which are linked by major roads and railway connections. It is part of Causeway Coast and Glens district. Coleraine had a population of 24,483 people in the 2021 census.

== Geography ==
Coleraine is at the lowest bridgeable point of the River Bann, where the river is wide. The town square is called &#x27;The Diamond&#x27; and is the location of Coleraine Town Hall. The three bridges in Coleraine are the Sandelford Bridge, Coleraine Bridge and the Bann Bridge.

The town has a large catchment area and is designated as a &quot;major growth area&quot; in the Northern Ireland Development Strategy.

== History ==
=== Neolithic period ===
Coleraine has some of the oldest evidence of human settlement in Ireland. Mount Sandel dates from approximately 5935 BC.

=== Early Middle Ages ===
The 9th Century hagiography, &quot;Tripartite Life of Saint Patrick,&quot; records how the town got its name. When Patrick arrived in the neighbourhood, he was received with great honour and hospitality by the local chieftain, Nadslua, who offered him a piece of ground on which to build a church. The spot was next to the river Bann and was overgrown with ferns, which were being burned by some boys to amuse themselves. This incident led to the area being called (&#x27;nook of ferns&#x27;), which was later anglicised as &quot;Colrain&quot;, &quot;Colerain&quot; and &quot;Coleraine&quot;. It was translated by Colgan into Latin as .

The town&#x27;s main Church of Ireland church, St. Patrick&#x27;s Church, is named in reference to this history. It was heavily remodelled by the architect Sir Thomas Drew in the 1880s.

=== Ulster Plantation ===
The town was one of the two urban communities developed by the London Companies in County Londonderry in the Plantation of Ulster at the start of the 17th century. In particular, The Honourable the Irish Society was made responsible for much of Coleraine and it remains so today.

The slightly skewed street pattern of Coleraine&#x27;s town centre is the legacy of that early exercise in town planning, along with traces of the lines of the ramparts that provided the Plantation town with its defences.

=== War of the Two Kings (1689–91) ===
During the War of the Two Kings (1689–91) Coleraine was a centre of Protestant resistance to the rule of James II. Richard Hamilton&#x27;s Irish Army made an attempt to seize the town but was repulsed. The Protestants were forced to abandon the town shortly afterwards and withdrew to Derry.

Later the same year, following the failed Siege of Derry, Sir Charles Carney and his Jacobite garrison fled the town on receiving news of the advance of Percy Kirke&#x27;s Enniskillen forces and the landing at Carrickfergus of Marshal Schomberg. The Williamites controlled Coleraine for the remainder of the war.

=== Industrial Era ===
With some industrialisation, the expansion of the river port, and the development of the railway, the town expanded throughout the 19th century.

The population doubled due to a number of factors: major industrial development on extensive suburban sites, including a substantial distillery producing Coleraine Whiskey; the expansion of commerce; and the development of sporting and recreational facilities.

=== World Wars &amp; the 20th Century ===
The town sent soldiers to both world wars. The town&#x27;s population then expanded significantly after the Second World War.

In 1968 the New University of Ulster opened in the town (later the &#x27;New&#x27; was dropped from the name) and became a major employer. The university also attracted students to the area.

There has been a steady expansion of the urban area from the mid-20th-century compact town of less than , to the present much more dispersed area of about . Since 1980s growth has continued but at a slightly more modest pace. In the twenty years to 2001 the town&#x27;s population increased by 22% to approximately 25,000 but the rate of increase fell from 12% in the 1980s to 8% in the 1990s.

===The Troubles===
==== Pre-1998 Belfast Agreement ====
During The Troubles a total of 11 people were killed in or near Coleraine prior to 1998.

Ten people were killed separate bomb explosions:

* On 12 June 1973, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) detonated a car bomb on Railway Road, with inadequate warning. Six Protestant civilians, all in their sixties and seventies, were killed. 
* The second most fatal incident occurred on 2 October 1975 when four members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) were killed when their own bomb went off as they travelled through Farrenlester near Coleraine. 
* Danny Cassidy, a Sinn Féin electoral worker, was shot dead by the Ulster Freedom Fighters in April 1992.

Separately, a non-fatal van bomb was detonated by the IRA on 13 November 1992 in the town centre. It resulted in extensive property damage and several major buildings were being demolished. Coleraine Town Hall required major structural work, and was not reopened until August 1995.

==== Post-1998 Belfast Agreement ====
Coleraine has continued to experience sectarianism and paramilitary activity following 1998.

* In 2001 John Henry McCormick (25), who was believed to be Catholic, was killed by loyalist paramilitaries in his home. His partner and children were in the house on the Ballysally estate.
* In 2002 a teenager with no paramilitary connections was killed by when he picked up a pipe bomb in the Heights estate in the town. 
There is reason to believe that there is still substantial sectarian violence and paramilitary activity in Coleraine.

* In 2021, the Police Service of Northern Ireland announced it had set up a special task force due to the rise in paramilitary shootings in the town.
* In 2023, A man in his 30s was shot four times after being hooded and taken out of the town in a planned attack by a gang of masked men.
* In 2024, the Police Service of Northern Ireland appealed for information after shots were fired at a house in the Ballysally estate.

== Economy ==
Northern Ireland is one of the poorest countries in Europe, with a GDP per capita lower than Bulgaria. Coleraine sits within the second poorest council areas in Northern Ireland, both in terms of relative poverty and absolute poverty.

There are widespread concerns that the high street in Coleraine has seen a steady decline in shops closing.

Historically a number of products were made in the town, such as Coleraine Cheddar and Coleraine Whiskey. However, over the years the production of these goods has moved out of the town:

* Coleraine Cheddar is now made in Portadown;
* Coleraine Whiskey, now made by Irish Distillers in Cork.

=== Night-time economy ===
Coleraine once had some 35 pubs, which has now been reduced to 5. Many of the pubs have substantial political affiliations.

=== Transport ===

Coleraine railway station opened on 4 December 1855 and shares facilities with the town&#x27;s Ulsterbus bus depot. Passenger service is delivered via the Belfast-Derry railway line along the scenic shore of Lough Foyle and the Coleraine–Portrush branch line. The Belfast–Derry railway line is to be upgraded to facilitate more frequent trains and improvements to the permanent way such as track and signalling to enable faster services.

The railway station was closed for goods traffic on 4 January 1965.

==Demography==
Coleraine has a population of approximately 25,000 people, making it a relatively small town within the official classification of a &#x27;large town&#x27; (i.e. with a population between 18,000 and 75,000 people).

According to the Causeway Coast &amp; Glens Borough Council, the area is the second poorest in Northern Ireland both in terms of relative poverty and absolute poverty. Northern Ireland itself is one of the poorest countries in Europe, therefore Coleraine being one of the poorest parts of NI means many people in the area face substantial deprivation.

Coleraine is home to one of the largest Polish communities in Northern Ireland (Approx. 2% of the Coleraine population are Polish, compared to a NI average of 1.25%).

===2021 census===
On Census day (2021) there were 24,483 people living in Coleraine. Of these:

* 18.78% were aged under 16, 63.25% were aged between 16 and 65, and 17.97% were aged 66 and over.
* 51.88% of the usually resident population were female and 48.11% were male.
* 61.72% are or were brought up Protestant (including other Christian-related denominations), 24.38% are or were brought up Catholic, 1.33% are or were brought up in an &#x27;other&#x27; religion, and 12.57% did not adhere to or weren&#x27;t brought up in any religion.
* 61.91% indicated they had a British national identity, 36.74% indicated they had a Northern Irish national identity, 11.17% indicated they had an Irish national identity, and 8.35% indicated they had an &#x27;other&#x27; national identity. (respondents could indicate more than one national identity)
* 15.65% had some knowledge of Ulster Scots and 4.44% had some knowledge of Irish (Gaeilge).

== In literature ==

The poetical illustration &quot;The Coleraine Salmon Leap&quot; by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1836, refers to an abundance of salmon in the river here in those times, and to a considerable sport derived therefrom. It accompanies an engraving of a painting of the salmon leap by Thomas Mann Baynes.

== Governance ==
Coleraine was the headquarters of the former Coleraine Borough Council In 2015 this was amalgamated under the reform of local government in NI to form the Causeway Coast and Glens District Council, which is now based in the former Coleraine Borough Council headquarters.

The town sits within the East Londonderry constituency for elections to the Westminster Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly, despite some of the borough being in County Antrim.

== Tourism ==
Coleraine is near the Causeway Coast tourist route, attracting over 2 million annual visitors. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Giant&#x27;s Causeway, is a 25-minute bus ride away. The distillery village of Bushmills is served by buses from the town and there is a narrow-gauge steam train running in the summer from Bushmills to the Giant&#x27;s Causeway. Also north of Coleraine is the scenic coastal town of Portstewart, with a sandy beach and coastal walks. Portrush is part of the Borough.

North-west of Coleraine lies the small village of Castlerock, with a beach which is essentially a continuation of the beach at Portstewart, separated by the mouth of the River Bann. Also nearby is the beach at Benone Strand and Mussenden Temple, built by Frederick Augustus Hervey, an 18th-century Anglican bishop atop a precipitate cliff and overlooking County Donegal in one direction and Scotland in another. The bishop&#x27;s residence, Downhill House, which is managed by the National Trust, fell into disrepair after the Second World War.

Coleraine during the day is busy but relatively quiet at night. Much of the nightlife in the area centres on the nearby seaside resort towns of Portrush and Portstewart, with the three towns forming a combined visitor area known as “The Triangle”.

== Climate ==

Coleraine experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and relatively mild winters. The nearest official Met Office weather station for which online records are available is at nearby Coleraine University, about north of the town centre. However, observations ceased a few years ago and the nearest current Met Office weather observing station is at Movanagher, about to the south. Rainfall at Coleraine typically peaks at over during the month of October. The driest month is May, with an average of under . On average, 173 days of the year will report at least of rain, ranging from 18 days in January to 11 days during June. The following table summarises temperature averages sampled between 1971 and 2000.

== Places of interest ==
The east side of the town is distinguished by Mountsandel Forest, which contains the Mount Sandel fort, an ancient site which has been claimed as the oldest site of human settlement in Ireland. Here wooden houses dating from about 7000 BC were uncovered. The fort can be accessed via Mountsandel forest, the closest entrance being the side near the Coleraine Courthouse. There is another fort about two miles south of Mountsandel near the small village of Loughan.

The University of Ulster campus was built in the 1960s and brought a theatrical space to the town in the form of the Riverside Theatre.

<text>Dundrum () is a village and townland in County Down, Northern Ireland. It is beside Dundrum Bay, about 4 miles outside Newcastle on the A2 road. The village is best known for its ruined Norman castle. It had a population of 1,555 people at the 2011 census.

==History==
===Norman times===
In 1177, the Normans, who had conquered great swathes of Ireland, invaded eastern Ulster and captured territories along its coast. John de Courcy, who had led the invasion, began building Dundrum Castle in the early 13th century on top of an earlier fort, &quot;Dun Rury&quot; (Rudraige), which was a seat for the remaining Ulaid tribes east of the bann river, after the collapse of the kingdom in the 4th century. The castle was to guard the land routes from Drogheda to Downpatrick. In 1203, de Courcy was expelled from Ulster by fellow Norman Hugh de Lacy, 1st Earl of Ulster. Two years later, de Courcy tried to re-take the castle but failed. It was visited by King John in 1210, who spent money for minor works to the castle and paid for a garrison there.

===15th century===
Dundrum castle was held by the Earls of Ulster until the 15th century, it was captured by the Magennises of Mourne, a Gaelic clan. In 1517, the Earl of Kildare briefly captured the castle, as did the Lord Deputy Leonard Grey, 1st Viscount Grane in 1538. The castle was surrendered to the English Crown in 1601 by Phelim Magennis, granted to Edward Lord Cromwell and sold to the Blundell family. The Magennises re-took the castle during the Irish Confederate Wars/Eleven Years&#x27; War (1641–1653) but lost it to the Parliamentarians (&quot;Roundheads&quot;) of the contenders versus the Cavaliers of King Charles I in the simultaneous English Civil War. The Blundells returned after the civil war during the Restoration of the Monarchy and built the house on the south edge of the castle.

===19th century===
In 1806, Arthur Hill, 3rd Marquess of Downshire engaged engineers to develop the area. They recommended deepening the harbour to allow larger vessels to trade. By 1825 they had completed a new pier over long.

The SS Great Britain ran aground in Dundrum Bay in 1846. There was no loss of life but it took nearly a year to refloat.

From 1866 a new iron screw steamer provided a service to Whitehaven, Cumbria and Dundrum became commercially important for both goods and passengers. It later lost trade to the deeper harbours of Warrenpoint and Belfast but Dundrum remained a commercial port until 1984.

===20th century===
In 1967, nearby Murlough became Ireland&#x27;s first nature reserve.

==Transport==
Dundrum railway station was opened by the Belfast &amp; County Down Railway on 25 March 1869 and operated until 16 January 1950.

<doc id="428706" wikidata="Q1027679" url="?curid=428706" title="Portrush">
<text>Portrush () is a small seaside resort town on the north coast of County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It neighbours the resort of Portstewart in County Londonderry. The main part of the old town, including the railway station as well as most hotels, restaurants and bars, is built on a –long peninsula, Ramore Head. It had a population of 6,150 people at the 2021 census.

The town is well known for its three sandy beaches, the West Strand, East Strand and White Rocks, as well as the Royal Portrush Golf Club, the only golf club outside Great Britain which has hosted The Open Championship – in 1951 and 2019.

==History==
A number of flint tools found during the late 19th century show that the site of Portrush was occupied during the &quot;Larnian&quot; (late Irish Mesolithic) period; recent estimates date this to around 4000 BC.

The site of Portrush, with its excellent natural defences, probably became a permanent settlement around the 12th or 13th century. A church is known to have existed on Ramore Head at this time, but no part of it now survives. From the records of the papal taxation of 1306, the Portrush church – and by extension the village – appears to have been reasonably wealthy. The promontory also held two castles, at varying periods. The first of these, Caisleán an Teenie, is believed to have been at the tip of Ramore Head, and probably destroyed in the late 16th century; the other, Portrush Castle, may have been built around the time of the Plantation of Ulster in the early 17th century. Nothing survives of either castle.

Following the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in the mid-17th century, Portrush became a small fishing town. It grew substantially in the 19th century as a tourist destination, following the opening of the Ballymena, Ballymoney, Coleraine and Portrush Junction Railway in 1855, and by the turn of the 20th century had become one of the major resort towns of Ireland, with a number of large hotels and boarding houses including the prominent Northern Counties Hotel. As well as the town&#x27;s beaches and the Royal Portrush Golf Club (opened 1888), the nearby Giant&#x27;s Causeway was a popular tourist destination, with the Giant&#x27;s Causeway Tramway – at the time, one of the world&#x27;s longest electrified railways – built in 1893 to cater to travellers coming from Portrush.

The town&#x27;s fortunes peaked in the late 19th and early 20th century, and declined after the Second World War with the growth of foreign travel. It escaped any involvement in the Troubles until 3 August 1976, when a series of bombings of properties burned out and destroyed several buildings, though with no loss of life. In a second attack in April 1987, two officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) were shot in the back by the Provisional Irish Republican Army while on foot patrol on Main Street.

==Places of interest==

* Attractions in the town include the &quot;Coastal Zone&quot; (formerly the Portrush Countryside Centre), Waterworld swimming complex, and, on the edge of town, the links of the Royal Portrush Golf Club, which hosted the 1951 British Open golf championship, and Ballyreagh Golf Course. The Open next returned to Portrush 
* For the 2019 Open, The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews invested significant funds in the region to improve the rail service and worked with the club to modify the course so it could better host a modern major championship. The 2019 championship had the largest advance ticket sales of any Open ever held.
* There are two long sandy beaches in the resort: West and East Strand. White Rocks and Curran Strand stretch on from the East Strand and are backed by dunes. The coast continues past Dunluce Castle to the Giant&#x27;s Causeway. It was once possible to travel to these attractions from Portrush on the Giant&#x27;s Causeway Tramway). “To the People of the Sea”, a high bronze sculpture on the East Strand, inspired by the sails of local traditional boats, is by Cork-based sculptor Holger Lönze.
* Portrush is home to one of Northern Ireland&#x27;s best known nightclubs. The nightclub &quot;Lush!&quot; was immortalised by CJ Agnelli of Agnelli &amp; Nelson and Col Hamilton with one of their first releases, titled &quot;Lush&quot;, and the later remixes, &quot;Lush Gold&quot;.
* Portrush is also home to Barry&#x27;s Amusements (now Curry&#x27;s Fun Park Portrush), the largest amusement park in Northern Ireland. Actor James Nesbitt once worked there. The park was put up for sale as a potential development site in May 2021, and reopened as Curry&#x27;s in May 2022.
* The Skerries, a series of small rocky islets just off the coast, are an important habitat for several species, some unique to Northern Ireland.
* Portrush Town Hall which was completed in 1872.

<text>:&quot;En lucha was also a Maoist publication by the Workers&#x27; Revolutionary Organisation.&quot;

In Struggle (Castilian: &quot;En lucha&quot;, Catalan: &quot;En Lluita&quot;) was a Spanish revolutionary socialist organisation within Trotskyist tradition. It was part of the International Socialist Tendency led by the British Socialist Workers Party It was founded in 1994 with the name &quot;Socialismo Internacional&quot;, which was changed in 1998 to &quot;Izquierda Revolucionaria&quot; and finally to &quot;En Lucha/En Lluita&quot; in 2001. For a number of years, it produced a newspaper under those names. The group was mainly based in Catalonia, especially in the city of Barcelona, but also had branches in other parts of the Spanish state, notably in Madrid and Andalusia. In 2016, In Struggle voted to dissolve.

== History ==
Towards the end of the 1990s the group was heavily involved in the campaign to close Europa, a Nazi bookshop in Barcelona. Soon after it became one of the first organisations in the Spanish state to become active in the anti-globalisation movement. It was very much involved in the European Social Forum mobilisations: Florence (2002), Paris (2003) and London (2004). It was also one of the initiators of &quot;Aturem la Guerra&quot; (Stop the War) platform, which called the huge demonstration in Barcelona on 15 February 2003.

It also participated in the movement for decent housing (2006), the mobilisation for the right of self-determination for Catalonia (2006 onwards), the student movement against the Bologna higher education reforms (2007-2010) and was involved in setting up &quot;Unitat Contra el Feixisme i el Racisme&quot; (Unity against Racism and Fascism).

&quot;En Lluita/En Lucha&quot; was very active in the anti-austerity 15-M movement (2011–15) and participated in the &quot;Anticapitalistas’&quot; candidature in the Spanish state-wide elections in 2011 as part of the &quot;Des de baix&quot; (From below) coalition. In the elections to the &quot;Generalitat&quot; of Catalonia in 2012 it was a component of the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP).

In 2013, a major internal crisis erupted in the British SWP as a result of accusations of rape against a leading member of the party. The party’s leadership was also accused of covering up these and subsequent accusations of sexual assault and harassment. This scandal led to a third of the party’s membership leaving the organisation and it also had repercussions in the IST. The Serbian group left and the Irish SWP and In Struggle passed motions which were very critical of the way the SWP leadership had handled the crisis.

At the end of October 2016, the In Struggle group voted overwhelmingly to dissolve. In a statement entitled “One step forward, two backwards” the group stated “in the definitive moments of the Catalan independence process, it’s necessary to strengthen the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP)”.

== Today ==
Some Catalan ex-members of In Struggle are active within the CUP while others have joined &quot;Anticapitalistes/Anticapitalistas&quot;, as have others in the rest of the Spanish state. A handful of ex-members in Barcelona and Andalusia have formed a Marx21 group, which is part of the International Socialist Tendency.

<text>Portstewart () is a small seaside town in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It had a population of 7,854 people in the 2021 United Kingdom census. It is a seaside resort neighbouring Coleraine and Portrush in County Antrim. Its harbour and scenic coastal paths form an Atlantic promenade leading to a two-mile beach (Portstewart Strand), popular with holidaymakers in summer and surfers year-round.

==Profile==
Portstewart was a popular holiday destination for Victorian middle-class families. Its long, crescent-shaped seafront promenade is sheltered by rocky headlands. It is a reasonably prosperous town. Most of the town is contained in the Strand electoral ward and this is one of the most affluent areas in Northern Ireland. In a deprivation index of electoral wards in Northern Ireland the Strand Ward in the town was ranked 570th out of the 582 wards.

House prices in Portstewart have been amongst the highest in Northern Ireland. According to the University of Ulster Quarterly House Price Index report produced in partnership with Bank of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive in Q4 2010, the North Coast region (Coleraine/Limavady area) had higher property prices than those of affluent south Belfast.

Portstewart is one of the most integrated towns in Northern Ireland with the religious demographics similar to the population of Northern Ireland as a whole. Community relations are generally good within the town. Dominican College, a Catholic grammar school, is one of the main schools in the area.

==History==

Portstewart was founded in 1792 by John Cromie, who named it after his maternal ancestors, the Stewarts of Ballylesse. A Lieutenant Stewart is said to have obtained a lease of land from The 5th Earl of Antrim (first creation; 1713–1775) in 1734. Prior to this, the area was formerly known in Irish as , a name related to the nearby island and townland of Benoney (an anglicisation of ). The name is still used today alongside the Gaelicised version .

Portstewart developed to a modest size seaside resort in the mid 19th century under the influence of a local landlord, John Cromie. Its development and character was influenced greatly by the Sabbatarian sensitivities of the Cromies and the consequent resistance to a railway connection in the mid 19th century.

==Places of interest==
*Portstewart has a Dominican convent (an imposing Gothic mansion) with the attached Dominican College sitting on the edge of a cliff which dominates the western end of the Promenade. The site, formally known as &quot;O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s Castle&quot; was built in 1834 and bought by the Dominican order in 1917 to be a centre of education in the north west of Ireland.
*Just west of the town stretches Portstewart Strand, a clean two-mile long blue flag beach, protected by the National Trust.
*Beneath the convent is a cliff path which stretches along the coast from the Promenade to Portstewart Strand. From here it is a popular walk to the Barmouth, where the Bann flows out into the Atlantic Ocean. The cliff path has panoramic views across the Strand and Downhill with Donegal in the background.
*Portstewart Town Hall was completed in 1934.

There was an intermediate station called &quot;Portstewart&quot; although it was about a mile from the town. The town was connected to the station by the Portstewart Tramway from 1882 to 1926. After closure of the tramway, the station saw few passengers eventually closing in 1963. It re-opened as &quot;Cromore&quot; in 1969 when the branch was upgraded but closed again in 1988.

<text>Public-access television (sometimes called community-access television) is traditionally a form of non-commercial mass media where the general public can create content television programming which is narrowcast through cable television specialty channels. Public-access television was created in the United States between 1969 and 1971 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), under Chairman Dean Burch, based on pioneering work and advocacy of George Stoney, Red Burns (Alternate Media Center), and Sidney Dean (City Club of NY).

Public-access television is often grouped with public, educational, and government access television channels, under the acronym PEG.

== Distinction from PBS ==
In the United States, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) produces public television, offering an educational television broadcasting service of professionally produced, highly curated content. It is not public-access television, and has no connection with cable-only PEG television channels. Although non-commercial educational television bears some resemblance to the E of PEG, PBS bears little resemblance to public-access television.

PBS generally does not offer local programming content. Instead, it broadcasts content produced for a national audience distributed via satellites. There is no generally accepted right of access for citizens to use broadcast studio facilities of PBS member stations, nor right of access by community content producers to the airwaves stewarded by these television stations outside of some universities or technical colleges such as Milwaukee&#x27;s Milwaukee Area Technical College, which owns the area&#x27;s two PBS member stations and offers students the limited ability (within FCC guidelines) to produce their own programs to air on a public television station for television production experience. These qualities are in stark contrast to PEG channel content, which is mostly locally produced, especially in conjunction with local origination studio facilities. And in the case of the P, public-access television, the facilities and channel capacity are uncurated free-speech zones available to anyone for free or little cost.

Since 53% to 60% of public television&#x27;s revenues come from private membership donations and grants, most stations solicit individual donations by methods including fundraising, pledge drives, or telethons which can disrupt regularly scheduled programming. PBS is also funded by the federal government of the United States.

PEG channels are generally funded by cable television companies through revenues derived from cable television franchise fees, member fees, grants and contributions.

==PEG-TV==

Public, educational, and government access television (also PEG-TV, PEG channel, PEGA, local-access television) refers to three different cable television narrowcasting and specialty channels. Public-access television was created in the United States between 1969 and 1971 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and has since been mandated under the Cable Communications Act of 1984, which is codified under 47 USC § 531. PEG channels consist of:

# Public-access televisionGenerally quite free of editorial control, a form of non-commercial mass media where ordinary people can create television programming content which is transmitted through cable TV. The channels are reserved free or at a minimal cost. The local origination television content revolves primarily around community interest, developed by individuals and nonprofit organizations.
# Educational-access televisionIs distance education, a curated form of educational television, it is a synchronous learning educational technology unique to cable television systems and transmit instructional television, on Time Warner Cable channel 21, programming within city limits. Educational-access channels are generally reserved for educational purposes and are not for government-access or public-access television. Many schools have adapted educational access channels to enhance school curriculum. Some schools have done this better than others. Although the use of television in schools can be traced to those schools serving the bedroom communities of Manhattan in the 1960s, where executives and technicians of early television lived, the creation of PEG channels expanded the value of television as a school or community resource. Students produced and aired community stories in part to serve community stakeholders and in part to engage in active learning. These schools developed school-based community television as a storytelling laboratory.
# Government-access televisionCable channel capacity for the local government bodies and other legislative entities to access the cable systems to televise public affairs and other civic meetings. Government channels are generally reserved for government purposes and not for education-access or public-access television.
# Leased accessCable television channels that are similar to commercial television where a fee is paid-for-services of reserved channel time.
# Municipal-access television and &quot;Community Access television&quot; are ambiguous terms that usually refer to a channel space assigned on a Cable TV System intended to provide the content to all or some of the above listed access channels, and may contain other &quot;access&quot; programming such as &quot;religious access&quot; or the TV programming of a local institution, such as a college or a library. These channels are usually created as cost saving measures for the Cable TV company if their franchises or governing authorities allow it.
# Hybrid Often, one channel will take on the role of another channel type on a regular basis. An example of this would be a college with a strong television production curriculum assuming the roles of educational access and public access. Beyond the typical curated educational access programming, a public access television element would be added where public access television producers would make shows using college owned (or shared) equipment and college students as crew. This can be very beneficial to both entities, as the students earn credits for the work while contributing to the public access channel. However, difficulties can arise when the programming made for public access is of a type that does not reflect the values or tastes of the supporting college, and in such situations, colleges often make the decision to downplay or abandon the public access element of the channel, depending on how much funding is earned by assuming the public access television duties.

The channel numbering, signal quality, and tier location of these channels are usually negotiated with a local authority, but often, these choices are made with the intention of one or more of the parties involved to marginalize one channel and emphasize another, such as placing Government access on channel 3 or 10, Educational access on a channel numerically near a PBS station, and Public Access in the high 90&#x27;s or higher on a digital-only service tier. Various Cable TV companies have marginalized PEG programming in other ways, such as moving some or all of them to a sub-menu on the cable box, giving subscribers limited bandwidth access (and limited picture quality) to the channel, while also separating the PEG channels from the commercial channel lineup in an effort to fulfill their franchise obligations while discouraging the channels&#x27; use, and hopefully eliminate the PEG channels that have the least political power.

== History ==
In the United States, public-access television is an alternative system of television which originated as a response to disenchantment with the commercial broadcasting system, and in order to fulfill some of the social potential of cable television.

=== Pioneers ===
The first experiments in public-access television and/or non-commercial community television began in 1968 with Dale City, Virginia&#x27;s Dale City Television (DCTV) and Bob &amp; Janeen Burrel at Stoughton, Wisconsin&#x27;s WSTO TV, and 1970 with Robert Monroe in Charlottesville, Virginia and Jefferson Cable Corporation&#x27;s Cablevision 10 and 11.

Also, at that same time in New York City, Fred Friendly, head of the Cable TV and Communications Commission, made recommendations for a leased-access channel for public use. The rent for equipment usage and studio time was opposed and later dropped. This free-access requirement was the contractual beginnings of PEG.

Filmmakers George Stoney, and Red Burns (who had served on the Canadian Film Board), along with Sidney Dean (City Club of NY), were instrumental in developing the theoretical legal basis and the practical need for public-access television, and helped to eventually obtain public-access television requirements in the franchise agreement between the city government and the cable company.

The legal basis of the local municipality regulating cable companies—which use public rights-of-way in order to make profits—to meet certain minimum standards of public service requirements, i.e., facilities and equipment, channel capacity, and funding, came out of this work of these pioneers.

=== Local origins ===
The public policy origins begin at the federal level with the concept of local origination. It was the first attempt by officials at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to create a service like PEG through regulation of the cable industry.

In 1969, in the &quot;First Report and Order&quot;, the FCC stated,

&quot;no CATV system having 3,500 or more subscribers shall carry the signal of any television broadcast station unless the system also operates to a significant extent as a local outlet by cablecasting and has available facilities for local production and presentation of programs other than automated services.&quot;

In a report filed with this regulation, the Commission said,

&quot;[We] recognize the great potential of the cable technology to further the achievement of long-established regulatory goals in the field of television broadcasting by increasing the number of outlets for community self-expression and augmenting the public&#x27;s choice of programs and types of services. . . . They also reflect our view that a multi-purpose CATV operation combining carriage of broadcast signals with program origination and common carrier services, might best exploit cable channel capacity to the advantage of the public and promote the basic purpose for which this Commission was created:&quot;

In 1971, this rule was rescinded, and replaced with a requirement for PEG facilities and channel capacity. The concept of local programming persisted, however the rules have been modified to say

Origination cablecasting. Programing (exclusive of broadcast signals) carried on a cable television system over one or more channels and &quot;subject to the exclusive control of the cable operator.&quot;

In contrast with public-access television, which is government-mandated access for programming, local programming is now usually programming of local interest produced by the cable operator or PEG organizations. The term is also generally accepted to refer to television programming that is not produced by a commercial broadcasting company or other media source for national or international distribution.

Also note that at this time, the FCC was considering CATV a common carrier which is a term that comes from the bus and shipping industries, where, in exchange for being offered a charter for their operations by the government, companies were required to give all persons passage. Thus, if CATV operators we considered common carriers, then they certainly would have to give all persons access to carriage on their cable channels. However, this was specifically rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States in the &quot;Midwest Video&quot; decision.

=== Federal mandate by the FCC ===
Hundreds of public-access television production facilities were launched in the 1970s after the Federal Communications Commission issued its &quot;Third Report and Order&quot; in 1972, which required all cable systems in the top 100 U.S. television markets to offer three access-channels, one each for public, educational, and local government use. The rule was amended in 1976 to require that cable systems in communities with 3,500 or more subscribers set aside up to 4 cable TV channels and provide access to equipment and studios for use by the public.

=== Midwest Video decisions ===
Cable companies saw this regulation as an unlawful intrusion by the federal government into their business practices, and immediately started challenging the legality of these new rules. Two important United States Supreme Court cases involved a company known as Midwest Video.

In &quot;United States v. Midwest Video Corp.&quot;, 406 U.S. 649 (1972), the Supreme Court upheld the FCC&#x27;s requirements for Local Origination facilities. However the public-access television requirement did not survive legal scrutiny seven years later.

In 1979, the U.S. Supreme Court sided against the FCC in the case &quot;FCC v. Midwest Video Corp.&quot;, 440 U.S. 689 (1979), determining that the FCC&#x27;s new requirements exceeded the agency&#x27;s statutory powers as granted to them by Congress. The Supreme Court explicitly rejected the notion that cable companies were &quot;common carriers&quot;, meaning that all persons must be provided carriage. Instead, the Supreme Court took the stance that cable companies were private persons under the law with First Amendment to the United States Constitution rights, and that the requirement for public-access television was in fact a burden on these free speech rights.

This judicial action prompted PEG advocates to begin work on what would become the Cable Communications Act of 1984.

=== 1984 Cable Act ===
Congress acted to save PEG from the result of the Supreme Court &quot;Midwest Video decision&quot;. However, the legislative imperatives of compromise between the demands of the people and the demands of the cable industry yielded a law with only small benefits for consumers and public-access television advocates.

The 1984 Cable Franchise Policy and Communications Act written by Senator Barry Goldwater, said,

&quot;A franchising authority ... &quot;may require&quot; as part of a cable operator&#x27;s proposal for a franchise renewal ... that channel capacity be designated for public, educational, or governmental use.&quot; – 47 USC § 531(a)(emph. added)

This appeared to be a law which creates new rights, allowing local communities to require PEG channels, however, it in fact had the opposite effect. Since the franchise agreement is a license between the cable operator and the municipality, the municipality could always stipulate a PEG channel requirement, and the contracts clause of the United States Constitution prevents Congress from interfering. So while the intent may have been to correct the omission which led to the Midwest Video decision, and make PEG mandatory, the result was a law which allowed the municipality to opt out of PEG requirements, and keep 100% of the cable television franchise fees for their general fund, while providing no PEG facilities or television channel capacity. Since 1984, many public-access television centers have closed around the country as more municipalities take the opt-out provision.

However, the Cable Communications Act of 1984 did contain some benefits for PEG, as it barred cable operators from exercising editorial control over content of programs carried on PEG channels, and absolved them from liability for that content.

Congress passed the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act of 1992, which gave the FCC authority to create rules requiring cable operators to prohibit certain shows. The Alliance for Community Media (ACM) and others brought suit. The U.S. Supreme Court, in &quot;Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium v. FCC&quot;, 95–124 (1996) held the law unconstitutional, in part because it required cable operators to act on behalf of the federal government to control expression based on content.

Currently the ACM and others are focusing on operational challenges after new deregulation rules in various states are directly threatening PEG access.

== Principles ==
PEG access may be mandated by local or state government to provide any combination of television production equipment, training and airtime on a local cable system to enable members of the public, accredited educational institutions, and government to produce their own shows and televise them to a mass audience.

Municipalities must take initiative and petition the cable operator to provide the funding for PEG access as laid out by law, but municipalities may also choose to take no action and will instead keep the cable television franchise fees in a general fund. A municipality may also choose to allow government-access television (GATV) but not public-access television or may replace it with governmental access television or may take away Public-access television altogether, depending on the disposition of the local government or its voters.

Municipalities have a broad spectrum of franchise agreements with cable television service providers and may not create a monopoly through these agreements. Depending on the size of the community and their contractual agreement the PEG and local origination channels may take many forms. Large communities often have a separate organization for each PEG type, smaller communities may have a single organization that manages all three. Because each organization will develop its own policies and procedures concerning the commercial content of a program, constituent services differ greatly between communities.

==Structure and programming==
PEG channels may be run by public grassroots groups, individuals, private non-profits, or government organizations. Policies and regulations are subject to their own ordinances and community standards, initially defined within the individual franchise agreements between community (government) franchise grantor and system operator. While many of these agreements are similar boilerplate, motivated individuals and groups have been able to make creative stipulations to serve an individual community&#x27;s needs.

Services available at public-access television organizations are often low cost or free of charge, with an inclusive, content neutral, first-come, first-served, free speech ideology. Monies from cable television franchise fees are paid to government for use of right-of-way use of public property, hopefully allowing other general fund monies to be used to operate the facilities, employ staff, develop curriculum, operate training workshops, schedule, maintain equipment, manage the cablecast of shows and publish promotion materials to build station viewership. Funding and operating budgets vary significantly with the municipality&#x27;s finances. Frequently it is left to the cable franchise to determine how they operate public-access television. The FCC does not mandate a cable franchise to provide any of the above services mentioned.

Users of public-access television stations may participate at most levels of this structure to make content of their choosing. Generally, anyone may have their programming aired on a public-access television channel. Users are not restricted to cable subscribers, though residency requirements may apply, depending on local franchise agreements or facility policy. Many public-access television channels try to favor locally produced programs while others also carry regionally or nationally distributed programming. Such programming—regional, national or even international—is usually aired on a channel curated by the PEG operator, which also carries programs produced by professional producers. A show that originates outside the municipality is often referred to as &quot;bicycled&quot;, &quot;dub and submit&quot;, or &quot;satellite&quot; programming.

In the event that a public-access television channel becomes filled with programming, a franchise may state that more television channels may be added to satisfy the demand.

== Educational-access television ==
Educational-access television is the institution set aside for fulfilling the needs of the educational departments and organizations within the municipality. Educational-access television channels may be associated with a specific school, school district or even private organization that is contracted to operate the educational-access television channel for the city.

Educational-access television centers usually operate a cable channel on the local cable system and often include elements and principle that echo public-access television in terms of training and resources. Many school media and video training programs are based in the educational-access television centers. Programming distributed by these centers ranges from student or parent produced media to coverage of local school functions and bodies (such as the School Council meetings or Committee). There are a number of notable educational-access television organizations that produce programming for a national audience and experiences a very broad distribution.

== Government-access television ==

Government-access television (GATV) is a resource of the city to address local municipal programming needs. Often the city or town may use the G channel to cablecast city council meetings, election programming, local emergency announcements and other events and programs as valued by the local government.

== Technologies ==
Equipment available for public-access television broadcasting is evolving quickly. At its birth, the state of the art PEG facilities were composed of racks full of analog videotape decks and an automated video switching system. Recently, the low cost of digital production and distribution equipment, such as cameras, non-linear editing systems, digital video playback servers and new Internet technologies have made digital content production the norm. The dropping cost of digital production and distribution gear has changed the way many PEG facilities operate.

== Challenges ==
PEG television has come under fire from many sources including cable TV providers, local governments and officials, producers, viewers and even corporate litigation from potential copyright infringements. Special interest groups have also frequently applied pressure on PEG operations.

PEG often struggles to balance freedom of speech with free, open access to the cable systems and as a result cable operators or PEG organizations have occasionally (rightfully or wrongfully) banned producers, discriminated between programming in their allocation of airtime, or have removed or banned programming based upon potential legal problems, the values of the PEG organization, or the values or desires of the cable TV provider.

Funding for PEG is usually managed from local governments issuing the cable television franchise agreement. This same government often receives cable television franchise fees that come from the cable companies. Negotiation for PEG television services can often be hindered by obstructive or restricting behavior from the cable company, a competing cable provider, or the government officials and staff issuing the franchise agreement.

PEG television has been challenged by cable TV operators and telephone companies, who are now expanding into the cable TV business. These companies have lobbied for significant legislation through the U.S. Congress and through various state legislatures to reduce or end PEG television.

In California, the passage of AB2987 or &quot;The Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006,&quot; has changed the laws by which cable TV companies operate and as a result many public-access television studios in the state have closed. The California Public Utilities Commission now franchises cable television. However, they do not regulate PEG television, which remains the purview of the various city and county governments.

Municipalities, local governments and even residents often confuse the difference between commercial broadcast television and PEG television. PEG television has been reported to the FCC about infractions that may apply to broadcast television, even though cable television content (including public-access television) is not subject to the same rules. Because cable television is a closed system with elective access there are fewer rules and restrictions about content.

PEG television stations and studios are sometimes poorly managed and/or poorly supported, and give rise to numerous complaints. Station complaints range from poor scheduling and playback, programming playing late or not at all, or signal strength being so weak that the program becomes unwatchable. Studio complaints usually focus on the lack of equipment or facilities, poor equipment condition, and staff indifference. Accusations are often made that these situations arose as a result of willful neglect on the part of a city, a cable company, or other third party organization, with the intention of making the public-access television facilities so inviable that interest in them will wane and facilities can be closed. Complaints may also reflect viewers&#x27; general disagreement with other people&#x27;s viewpoints. Complaints may also reflect discrimination in the resources a PEG organization applies to one type of programming vs. another.

Another challenge in maintaining public-access television facilities as a free speech forum can come from within the membership of the PEG facility itself, by the overuse of commercial video programmers whose program content contains sponsorship underwriting advertisements like the type permitted on Public Broadcasting stations. Programming could then become very similar to other cable channels and programming without such sponsorship could be deprived of fair treatment by the administrators of a public-access television facility.

== Future ==
Public-access television organizations remain in service in their municipalities. In a changing technology industry, many PEG organizations began investing in training and technology to distribute media in new ways using the Internet. In the twenty-first century, the consumer media market became flooded with blogs, vlogs, RSS syndication and aggregation, mobile-device and cell phone media, and countless new methods for distributing information and ideas. As cable television adopts new technologies, many public-access television centers adapted these new technologies in order to continue serving their missions and goals within their own constituency.

== Outside the U.S. ==
There are public-access television or community television channels in other countries, notably in Scandinavia, Western Europe, Canada and Australia. In Germany, Norway and Sweden there are &quot;open channels&quot;. In most countries public-access television channels are broadcast on cable but in Australia, Denmark and Norway Terrestrial television transmission is common (UHF or digital). All channels are for profit operations.

<text>The Anticapitalist Party () was a Trotskyist organisation in Turkey. It was part of the International Socialist Tendency led by the Socialist Workers Party (UK).

The antecedents of Antikapitalist can be traced back to 1982 when the origins of the (today&#x27;s Revolutionary Socialist Workers&#x27; Party) were formed.

After founding of the Revolutionary Socialist Workers&#x27; Party in 1997, internal problems emerged and led to a split in the new party in 1998 and a group named (Workers Democracy) (İD) left the group. The leaderships of the British and Greek SWPs supported different sides in this dispute. Some time later some members of İD left to form . Some small groups left the group; the members left in was small and unable to organize. The group was abolished in 2010.

The few last members of Antikapitalist joined the Equality and Democracy Party (, EDP).

<doc id="428722" wikidata="Q2700280" url="?curid=428722" title="Kree–Skrull War">
<text>The &quot;Kree–Skrull War&quot; is a story arc that was written by Roy Thomas, and drawn by Sal Buscema, Neal Adams, and John Buscema. The story was originally published in the Marvel Comics comic book title &quot;Avengers&quot; #89–97 (June 1971 – March 1972).

The &quot;Kree–Skrull War&quot; is notable for its cosmic scope of interstellar warfare, enormous cast of characters, use of metaphor and allegory (for instance, to Joseph McCarthy and HUAC and the Arab–Israeli War), and the introduction of the Vision–Scarlet Witch romance, which became an ongoing theme for the characters (and the Avengers) for years to come. The &quot;Kree–Skrull War&quot; is considered by critics to be a highlight of its era, and is the culmination of a string of notable Thomas–Adams collaborations from this period, which began with their run on &quot;X-Men&quot; in 1969.

== Publication history ==
Writer Thomas admits he had no &quot;master plan&quot; in writing the storyline other than that the two &quot;rapacious, galaxy-spanning races ... would be at war in the far reaches of space, and that their conflict would be threatening to spill over onto the Earth, turning our planet into the cosmic equivalent of some Pacific island during World War II&quot;. In this regard, Thomas was inspired by Raymond F. Jones&#x27; 1952 novel &quot;This Island Earth&quot;.

In 2000, almost thirty years after the &quot;Kree–Skrull War&quot;&#x27;s original publication, Marvel produced a trade paperback collection of the entire story arc.

As part of 2020&#x27;s &quot;Empyre&quot; event, a prelude one-shot called &quot;Road to Empyre: The Kree/Skrull War&quot; #1 details the origins of the millennia longstanding conflict between the two species.

==Plot==
The Kree hero Captain Marvel, arriving on Earth after an extended stay in the Negative Zone, is captured by several members of the superhero team the Avengers — Quicksilver, the Scarlet Witch, and the android hero the Vision — and Rick Jones. It is later revealed that he conceived a child with the Skrull princess Anelle during this period of time. This is necessary, as Mar-Vell has inadvertently absorbed a lethal amount of radiation from spending weeks in the Negative Zone, and it will prove fatal unless treated. With the aid of a scientist, Vision drains the excess radiation from Mar-Vell.

A flashback sequence explains that the Avengers detected an alarm from the Baxter Building, the headquarters of the Fantastic Four. They arrived at the building and found Mar-Vell using a portal to the Negative Zone in an attempt to free Rick. Annihilus attempted to escape the Negative Zone, with Mar-Vell escaping in the ensuing chaos. The flashback ends and the group are then attacked by a Kree Sentry who captures Mar-Vell and escapes. The Avengers are questioned by Mar-Vell&#x27;s former colleague, Carol Danvers.

The Avengers respond to a call from fellow member Goliath, who advises that he is answering a distress call from Avenger Janet Pym, also known as the Wasp. With husband and fellow member Hank Pym, the pair were en route via ship to a research base in the Arctic Circle, there to study the effect of oil exploration on the environment. The pair apparently found a lush island, and investigate as the Wasp and Yellowjacket. Yellowjacket guesses the truth and pushes Wasp away before reaching the island. When he disappears, the Wasp in turn summons Goliath.

The Avengers arrive and are attacked once again by the Sentry, now aided by a hypnotised Goliath. The Avengers defeat Goliath but cannot stop the Sentry, who captures all but Quicksilver. The culprit is revealed to be Ronan the Accuser, now a Kree outlaw. Ronan begins &quot;Plan Atavus&quot;, intending to devolve Earth to a prehistoric time to use as a base in the war against the Skrulls. Ronan shows the heroes how the research scientists at the base and Henry Pym have devolved into cavemen, who now lust after Janet Pym. Quicksilver arrives and attacks, and Ronan ends the battle when contacted and advised of an impending attack by the Skrulls on the Kree homeworld of Hala. Lacking purpose, the Sentry self-destructs. The Avengers and Mar-Vell recover and find that Pym and the other scientists, like the environment, have reverted to normal.

Mar-Vell&#x27;s existence is revealed when the scientists advise the authorities as to what they witnessed, and the &quot;Alien Activities Commission&quot; is formed, led by Senator H. Warren Craddock. The Avengers agree to participate in a hearing, but this is abandoned when the Avengers refuse to hand over Mar-Vell. The Avengers encourage Mar-Vell to go with Danvers to a private farm, and although pursued by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. escape. The Avengers deal with frustrated members of the public, who picket Avengers Mansion and then force their way in to vandalize the building.

Avengers Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor apparently return to the Mansion and announce that, due to the behaviour of the team, it is now disbanded. Quicksilver, the Scarlet Witch and the Vision decide to leave and check on Mar-Vell, but are attacked by Skrulls, the ancient enemies of the Kree. At the same time, Danvers has led Mar-Vell to a Skrull vessel she claims to have found, and persuades Mar-Vell to build an &quot;Omni-Wave Projector&quot;, a communications device that in the hands of non-Kree is a deadly weapon. Mar-Vell, however, sees through the deception and destroys the device, but he is captured by Danvers (now revealed to actually be the Super-Skrull) and, along with Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, is taken off Earth.

Although injured, the Vision is able to return to Avengers Mansion, where Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and Hank Pym gathered. Ant-Man reduces himself to microscopic size and enters the Vision, and is able to repair the android. Ant-Man departs and on questioning the recovering Vision, the Avengers determine it was the Skrulls – previously disguised as cows – that dissolved the team. The four Avengers find and capture the Skrulls for interrogation, and determine that the aliens are in fact three of the four members of the original exploration team that once visited Earth and battled the Fantastic Four. The Avengers are then attacked by a team of three Mandroids, sent by Senator Craddock to apprehend the heroes for failing to cooperate. Iron Man overloads their armour with an electrical discharge.

At the same time Triton of the Inhumans arrives, and unable to locate the Fantastic Four, asks the Avengers for aid in locating their ruler Black Bolt, needed as his brother Maximus has seized power in their homeland Attilan. The Avengers aid Triton and, after locating Black Bolt, accompany the Inhumans to Attilan. Maximus is revealed to have entered into an alliance with the Kree, and in exchange for rulership uses Kree technology to control the population, intending to use them as soldiers against the Skrulls. The Avengers defeat Maximus and his minions, and after restoring Black Bolt to power leave (with Goliath) for Skrull space, intent on rescuing their comrades.

Mar-Vell is taken to the heart of the Skrull Empire and, after being advised that the captive Avengers will be executed, is forced to build another Omni-Wave Projector. The Avengers arrive in Skrull space, and hold off the alien fleet while Mar-Vell is forced to use the Projector, which casts a temporarily freed Rick Jones back into the Negative Zone. Jones is rescued from the Zone by the Kree ruler the Supreme Intelligence, who unlocks hidden mental powers (the Destiny Force) in Rick himself, Rick then sends a wave of Golden Age heroes with the Avengers against the Skrulls, ending the war. The Destiny Force also reverts Senator Craddock on Earth to his true Skrull form, revealing he was the fourth Skrull from the Earth expedition, and he is subsequently killed by an angered mob. The heroes return to Earth to discover that the real Craddock has been found, and the Avengers&#x27; reputation has been restored.

The secret superhero group the Illuminati are eventually revealed to have visited both the Kree and Skrull Empires and advised the aliens that involving Earth in their war would not be tolerated.

== Sequels ==
A supplemental story appeared in &quot;New Avengers: Illuminati&quot; (vol. 2) #1 – 5 (Feb. 2007 – Jan. 2008), recounting the adventures of a team that Iron Man assembled after the war consisting of himself, Black Bolt, Mister Fantastic, Professor X, Namor, and Doctor Strange, feeling that all of them together possessed information that could have averted Earth&#x27;s involvement in the war if they had worked together. Issue #1 recounts the group&#x27;s ill-fated confrontation with the Skrull emperor Dorrek, shortly after the Kree–Skrull War. In issue #5, Iron Man brings the Elektra Skrull&#x27;s corpse to the group. Subsequently, they are attacked by a group of Super-Skrulls, including one who had been impersonating Black Bolt. This issue tied the Kree–Skrull War with the ongoing crossover storyline &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;.

===Tie-ins===
The nature of Rick&#x27;s strange power at the story&#x27;s conclusion is revealed in &quot;Avengers Forever&quot;, where it is identified as the Destiny Force, a manifestation of human potential.

During &quot;Captain America Reborn&quot;, when Captain America was sent bouncing randomly through time by a weapon devised by the Red Skull, during a brief visit to the time of the Kree–Skrull war, he took advantage of the opportunity to isolate himself and the Vision from the conflict long enough to give the Vision a message that the Vision would subsequently &#x27;delete&#x27; from his conscious memory until the time came for him to recall it, allowing Captain America to communicate with the present without changing history.

In &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #5, Spider-Man and Vision learn that a Skrull scout from the Kree–Skrull War is interfering with the Vision&#x27;s brainwaves.

==Collected editions==
The &quot;Avengers&quot; storyline was collected in a trade paperback:
* &quot;The Avengers: Kree-Skrull War&quot; (208 pages, August 2000, , May 2008, )

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Kree–Skrull War was going to be adapted in the &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; animated series prior to its cancellation.
* The Kree–Skrull War was adapted for the second season of &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot; animated series.

===Film===
&quot;Captain Marvel&quot; features the mythology of the Kree–Skrull War. In the film, the conflict is depicted as one-sided, with the Skrulls being the victims of the Kree&#x27;s genocidal war. The Kree Mar-Vell goes against her people and travels to Earth to help Skrull refugees escape from Kree forces. Carol Danvers was brainwashed by the Kree to fight the Skrulls. When she discovers the truth, she rebels against her former masters and helps the Skrulls find a new homeland.

<text>Local usage details (LUD) are a detailed record of local calls made and received from a particular phone number. These records are regularly available to police in the United States and Canada with a court order, and were traditionally subject to the same restrictions as telephone tapping.

In the United States, LUDs may be legally used by the police without first obtaining a warrant, as determined by &quot;Smith v. Maryland&quot; (1979). 

Other terms for call records include CDR (call detail records) or SMDR (station message detail recordings). These terms normally apply to &quot;raw call records&quot; before they have been processed to apply locations and rates.

<text>Platanus occidentalis, also known as American sycamore, American planetree, western plane, occidental plane, buttonwood, and water beech, is a species of &quot;Platanus&quot; native to the eastern and central United States, the mountains of northeastern Mexico, extreme southern Ontario, and extreme southern Quebec. It is usually called sycamore in North America, a name which can refer to other types of trees in other parts of the world; in the United Kingdom, for example, the name syacamore typically refers to &quot;Acer pseudoplatanus&quot;. The American sycamore is a long-lived species, typically surviving at least 200 years and likely as long as 500–600 years.

The species epithet &quot;occidentalis&quot; is Latin for &quot;western&quot;, referring to the Western Hemisphere, because at the time when it was named by Carl Linnaeus, the only other species in the genus was &quot;P. orientalis&quot; (&quot;eastern&quot;), native to the Eastern Hemisphere. Confusingly, in the United States, this species was first known in the Eastern United States, thus it is sometimes called eastern sycamore, to distinguish it from &quot;Platanus racemosa&quot; which was discovered later in the Western United States and called western sycamore.
==Description==
&quot;Platanus occidentalis&quot; can often be easily distinguished from other trees by its mottled bark which flakes off in large irregular masses, leaving the surface mottled and gray, greenish-white and brown. The bark of all trees has to yield to a growing trunk by stretching, splitting, or infilling, but sycamore bark is more rigid and less elastic than the bark of other trees, so to accommodate the growth of the wood underneath, the tree sheds it in large, brittle pieces.

A sycamore can grow to massive proportions, typically reaching up to high and in diameter when grown in deep soils. The largest of the species have been measured to , and nearly in diameter. Larger specimens were recorded in historical times. In 1744, a Shenandoah Valley settler named Joseph Hampton and two sons lived for most of the year in a hollow sycamore in what is now Clarke County, Virginia. In 1770, at Point Pleasant, Virginia (now in West Virginia), near the junction of the Kanawha and Ohio Rivers, George Washington recorded in his journal a sycamore measuring in circumference at from the ground.

The sycamore tree is often divided near the ground into several secondary trunks, very free from branches. Spreading limbs at the top make an irregular, open head. Roots are fibrous. The trunks of large trees are often hollow.

Another peculiarity is the way the leaves grow sticky, green buds. In early August, most trees will have tiny buds nestled in the axils of their leaves which will produce the leaves of the coming year. The sycamore branch apparently has no such buds. Instead there is an enlargement of the petiole which encloses the bud in a tight-fitting case at the base of the petiole.

* Bark: Dark reddish brown, broken into oblong plate-like scales; higher on the tree, it is smooth and light gray; separates freely into thin plates which peel off and leave the surface pale yellow, or white, or greenish. Branchlets at first pale green, coated with thick pale tomentum, later dark green and smooth, finally become light gray or light reddish brown.
* Wood: Light brown, tinged with red; heavy, weak, difficult to split. Largely used for furniture and interior finish of houses, butcher&#x27;s blocks. Specific gravity, 0.5678; relative density, .
* Winter buds: Large, stinky, sticky, green, and three-scaled, they form in summer within the petiole of the full-grown leaf. The inner scales enlarge with the growing shake. There is no terminal bud.
* Leaves: Alternate, palmately nerved, broadly ovate or orbicular, long, truncate or cordate or wedge-shaped at base, decurrent on the petiole. Three to five-lobed by broad shallow sinuses rounded in the bottom; lobes acuminate, toothed, or entire, or undulate. They come out of the bud plicate, pale green coated with pale tomentum; when full grown are bright yellow green above, paler beneath. In autumn they turn brown and wither before falling. Petioles long, abruptly enlarged at base and inclosing the buds. Stipules with spreading, toothed borders, conspicuous on young shoots, caducous.

* Flowers: May, with the leaves; monoecious, borne in dense heads. Staminate and pistillate heads on separate peduncles. Staminate heads dark red, on axillary peduncles; pistillate heads light green tinged with red, on longer terminal peduncles. Calyx of staminate flowers three to six tiny scale-like sepals, slightly united at the base, half as long as the pointed petals. Of pistillate flowers three to six, usually four, rounded sepals, much shorter than the acute petals. Corolla of three to six thin scale-like petals.
* Stamens: In staminate flowers as many of the divisions of the calyx and opposite to them; filaments short; anthers elongated, two-celled; cells opening by lateral slits; connectives hairy.
* Pistil: Ovary superior, one-celled, sessile, ovate-oblong, surrounded at base by long, jointed, pale hairs; styles long, incurved, red, stigmatic, ovules one or two.
* Fruit: Brown heads, solitary or rarely clustered, in diameter, hanging on slender stems three to six inches long; persistent through the winter. These heads are composed of achenes about two-thirds of an inch in length. October.

==Distribution==
In its native range, it is often found in riparian and wetland areas. The range extends from Iowa to Ontario and New Hampshire in the north, Nebraska in the west, and south to Texas and Florida. It is apparently extirpated from Maine. Closely related species (see &quot;Platanus&quot;) occur in Mexico and the southwestern states of the United States. It is sometimes grown for timber and has become naturalized in some areas outside its native range. It can be found growing successfully in Bismarck, North Dakota, and it is sold as far south as Okeechobee. The American sycamore is also well adapted to life in Argentina and Australia and is quite widespread across the Australian continent, especially in the cooler southern states such as Victoria and New South Wales.

==Ecology==
American sycamore is found most commonly in bottomland or floodplain areas, thriving in the wet environments provided by rivers, streams, or abundant groundwater, though it will die after being flooded for more than two weeks at a time. It is a fast-growing, early-mid successional hardwood tree species. Its life cycle follows the pattern of a &quot;weedy&quot; species: it grows mature enough to reproduce rather young and produces large numbers of wind-distributed seeds. The dominance of sycamore in a forest depends on the conditions where it grows; it is often a pioneer species, but in the wet sites that are most ideal for it, it persists as a subclimax to climax species, partly because of its fast growth and very long lifespan.

As one of the largest trees in the wet bottomland habitats where it dominates, it is a key component of the structure of those habitats. The heartwood of a sycamore tree decays quickly, producing large hollow cavities in the center of the trees which are used by many animals as nesting sites. The largest hollow trees can be big enough for black bear dens, but average trees create homes for bats and cavity-nesting birds like wood ducks, barred owls, screech owls, chimney swift, and great-crested flycatcher.

===As host plant===
American sycamore is the host plant of the sycamore tussock moth, a species which specializes in it, and a major host plant for the drab prominent moth. This plant is also the first host known for &quot;Plagiognathus albatus&quot;.

==Uses==

The American sycamore is able to endure a big city environment and was formerly extensively planted as a shade tree, but due to the defacing effects of anthracnose it has been largely usurped in this function by the resistant London plane.

Its wood has been used extensively for butcher&#x27;s blocks. It has been used for boxes and crates; although coarse-grained and difficult to work, it has also been used to make furniture, siding, and musical instruments.

Investigations have been made into its use as a biomass crop.

=== Use by Native Americans ===
The tree bark has traditionally been used by Native Americans to make little dishes for gathering whortleberries.

==Pests and diseases==
The American sycamore is a favored food plant of the pest sycamore leaf beetle.

American sycamore is susceptible to plane anthracnose disease (&quot;Apiognomonia veneta&quot;, syn. &quot;Gnomonia platani&quot;), an introduced fungus found naturally on the Oriental plane &quot;P. orientalis&quot;, which has evolved considerable resistance to the disease. Although rarely killed or even seriously harmed, American sycamore is commonly partially defoliated by the disease, rendering it unsightly as a specimen tree.

Sometimes mistaken for frost damage, the disease manifests in early spring, wilting new leaves and causing mature leaves to turn brown along the veins. Infected leaves typically shrivel and fall, so that by summer the tree is regrowing its foliage. Cankers form on twigs and branches near infected leaves, serving to spread the disease by spore production and also weakening the tree. Because cankers restrict the flow of nutrients, twigs and branches afflicted by cankers eventually die. Witch&#x27;s broom is a symptom reflecting the cycle of twigs dying.

As a result of the fungus&#x27; damage, American sycamore is often avoided as a landscape tree, and the more resistant London plane (&quot;P. × hispanica&quot;; hybrid &quot;P. occidentalis × P. orientalis&quot;) is planted instead.

==History==
The terms under which the New York Stock Exchange was formed are called the &quot;Buttonwood Agreement&quot;, because it was signed under a buttonwood (sycamore) tree at 68 Wall Street, New York City in 1792.

The sycamore made up a large part of the forests of Greenland and Arctic America during the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods. It once grew abundantly in central Europe, from which it has now disappeared. It was brought to Europe early in the 17th century.

<doc id="428726" wikidata="Q1338793" url="?curid=428726" title="Millencolin">
<text>Millencolin is a Swedish punk rock band that was formed on 12 October 1992 by Nikola Šarčević, Mathias Färm, and Erik Ohlsson in Örebro, Sweden. In early 1993, drummer Fredrik Larzon joined the band. The name Millencolin is derived from the skateboard trick &quot;melancholy&quot;.

==History==
The original lineup, consisting of Šarčević (vocals and bass), Ohlsson (guitar), and Färm (drums), released their first demo tape, &quot;Goofy&quot;, in early 1993. Soon afterwards, Larzon joined the band to play drums, allowing Färm to perform as the second guitarist. In the summer of 1993, they recorded a second demo tape, &quot;Melack&quot;. The band sent the tape to Burning Heart Records, a new record label formed earlier that year. They signed Millencolin to do a CD single, which culminated in the release of &quot;Use Your Nose&quot; in November 1993. Success of the single prompted Burning Heart to sign the band to release a full album. In July 1994, the band released &quot;Skauch&quot;, initially planned to be a single for their new album. However, the band decided to record four cover songs as well and released it as an EP instead. They put out their first major release, &quot;Tiny Tunes&quot;, in 1994. The recording and mixing of the album took two weeks. Legal trouble with Warner Brothers over the title and cover artwork of the album led the band to re-release it in 1998 under the name &quot;Same Old Tunes&quot;.

Millencolin continued to tour and in 1995 brought out their second full-length album, &quot;Life on a Plate&quot;. This coincided with Millencolin beginning to tour outside of Scandinavia. At the end of 1995, the US record company Epitaph wanted to release &quot;Life on a Plate&quot; in the US, and the band agreed. They then toured further afield, touring Japan, Australia, Brazil and Canada, and played as part of the 1997 Warped Tour.

===&quot;Pennybridge Pioneers&quot; and mainstream success===
Further albums &quot;For Monkeys&quot; and compilation &quot;The Melancholy Collection&quot; followed, but the band&#x27;s popularity increased in 2000 with the release of &quot;Pennybridge Pioneers&quot;, an album with more of a rock influence than the band&#x27;s previous skate punk/ska punk sound. The recording took six weeks, following which they began their first major worldwide tour with initial dates in Wellington, New Zealand and Australia. This led to an early release of the album in Australia and New Zealand. Whilst on tour, Millencolin wrote and released &quot;Home from Home&quot; in 2002. In 2003, the band received the Best Swedish Rock award from the Swedish Hit Awards.

&quot;Kingwood&quot;, released in March 2005, marked the band&#x27;s return to a faster and more traditional punk rock sound, collaborating it with their recently founded rock sound, and completed a world tour in follow-up of the album. The album debuted at No. 2 in the Swedish chart.

On 22 October 2007, the band entered the studio and started writing and recording songs for their seventh album &quot;Machine 15&quot;.

The band has hosted a skateboard contest at their own skatepark in Örebro, Sweden, named the Millencolin Open. They say they started this annual contest because skateboarding is what brought them together and now they have the chance to make something good of their town and of skateboarding.

Šarčević released his second solo album entitled &quot;Roll Roll and Flee&quot;, whilst Färm promoted his side project Franky Lee.

They wrote and released a single dedicated to their hometown football club Örebro SK titled &quot;Örebro&quot; in 2009. It was played in the clubs&#x27; stadium, Eyravallen for the first time on 11 May 2009 in the home game against Hammarby Fotboll.

Throughout 2010, they toured in Canada and South America, where they played &quot;Pennybridge Pioneers&quot; in its entirety. They also played the 2011 Soundwave Festival in Australia.

===Millencolin 20 Year Festival===

In 2012, Millencolin held their own festival to celebrate 20 years as a band. The &quot;Millencolin 20 Year Festival&quot; was a two-day open-air festival at Brunnsparken, Örebro, Sweden on the 8 and 9 June 2012. Millencolin closed both nights by doing two exclusive sets from the band&#x27;s entire 20-year long career with different songs each night. In addition to Millencolin, several other international and national bands also played on stage. A temporary festival site was built, including a huge catering tent with food and drinks. In addition, WESC presented a skate contest, which also featured several pro skaters. There was also a camp for festival-goers, five minutes away from the festival and complete with its own waterpark.

The band had announced on Facebook earlier that a limited edition &quot;yellow bird&quot; toy would be available at the festival, but due to a delay in production the sale of these items was only possible on future tours. A limited edition (500 copies only) vinyl release of &quot;Carry You&quot; single, from the compilation album &quot;The Melancholy Connection,&quot; was available for sale at the festival.

<text>The United Liberal Democrats (, ULD) was a right-wing conservative political party in South Korea, whose support mostly came from the North Chungcheong Province and South Chungcheong Province regions. The short Korean name is Jaminryeon (; ULD).

The Party was in a government coalition with Kim Dae-jung&#x27;s Democratic Party from 1998 to 2001.

In the 2004 parliamentary election, it gained only 4 seats in the National Assembly, and its president Kim Jong-pil announced his retirement from politics after his bid for the 10th term in the National Assembly failed. Subsequently, most lawmakers from the party chose to defect from the party to form a new party, People First Party.

<text>James Woodsworth (1843–1917) was a late-19th-century Superintendent of Methodist Missions in Western Canada. He fathered James Shaver Woodsworth, who was the first leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (which became the New Democratic Party).

Woodsworth was born in Toronto and son of Harold Richard Woodsworth and ordained a Methodist minister in 1868.

He married E. Josephine Shaver in 1868 and was minister in various towns in Ontario before heading west:

* 1867–1869 Vespra (Simcoe County)
* 1871 Nottawasaga, Ontario (Simcoe County)
* 1880 Chairman Bracebridge District
* 1882–1887 Portage la Prairie
* 1891 Superintendent of Methodist Missions in Manitoba and the North-West

He was very passionate about the importance of the church for the first settlers for educational, moral and religious purposes in their lives and believed that the Canadian west would some day become one of the most important places in the world from travel between Europe and Asia, and the sheer amount of grain producing power it held.

During his time in the west he travelled to First Nations communities in Northern Manitoba and Southern Alberta, and visited settlers in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and British Columbia. In his trip to Northern Manitoba he visited the community of Norway House and many more on the northern end of lake Winnipeg. He made mention of the beauty of the Spider Islands, an Icelandic farm on an island in lake Winnipeg and the general state of the church in northern Manitoba.

On his trip to the Blackfoot in Alberta he saw several graves and mentioned how they left the deceased&#x27;s belongings on his grave since he would need them where he went. He also wrote an account of a medicine wheel dance. On his first trip through settler towns in Alberta he wrote of how that in one community of First Nations between Edmonton and Calgary he saw that of 180 residents a few years ago 100 had died of disease and the 15 school age children dropped to 5 and were mostly orphans after the disease swept the village. A similar story was told to him in northern Manitoba when a man came across a whole village of dead from disease.

He made several trips to Alberta and was convinced that it would grow to be the heart of Canada, specifically the Peace River Valley, and was focused on getting as many men to preach for the communities as possible, most of the land was reliant on a handful of men for Methodism.

On his trip to British Columbia he went to Port Simpson and the communities around it, talking with both the white and indigenous residents of the town. He also visited Sitka in Alaska due to the ship he was travelling on going there on its journey before heading south again. One enigma he talked of was that some totem poles had what appeared to be writing on the top.

Once he returned to Manitoba he was very invested in methodism in Winnipeg, specifically the school for the poor children in the north end started by a young Irish woman, both his son James and Nellie McClung wrote about the school and the good it did.

Before he retired he travelled to Ireland and England several times in search of new men to come to the west, with his efforts bearing fruit with around 300 men going west. Some of the places he visited were Belfast, Leeds and Cardiff, though he visited many more.

His book was written in 1913 at the request of the methodist church for an account of expansion in the west, but wasn&#x27;t published until late 1917, a few months after he died. He book is dedicated: &quot;To My Wife and Children who though not always journeying with me have been my fellow-travelers.&quot;

Woodsworth died in 1917 in Winnipeg at his home on 60 Maryland Street, which still stands today.

He had 5 children including James Shaver Woodsworth and Joseph Francis Woodsworth.

<text>Lough Neagh ( ; ) is a freshwater lake in Northern Ireland and is the largest lake on the island of Ireland and in the British Isles. It has a surface area of and is about long and wide. According to Northern Ireland Water, it supplies 40.7% of Northern Ireland&#x27;s drinking water. Its main inflows are the Upper River Bann and Blackwater, and its main outflow is the Lower Bann. There are several small islands, including Ram&#x27;s Island, Coney Island and Derrywarragh Island. The lake bed is owned by the 12th Earl of Shaftesbury and the lake is managed by Lough Neagh Partnership. Its name comes from Irish , meaning &quot;Eachaidh&#x27;s lake&quot;.

==Geography==
With an area of , it is the British Isles&#x27; largest lake by area and is ranked 34th in the list of largest lakes of Europe. Located west of Belfast, it is about long and wide. It is very shallow around the margins and the average depth in the main body of the lake is about , although at its deepest the lough is about deep.

===Geology===
Geologically the Lough Neagh Basin is a depression, built from many tectonic events dating back as far as 400 million years ago. These tectonic events are responsible for a NE-SW bedrock structure which has controlled many subsequent events. During the Paleozoic era, the Lough Neagh Basin was a depositional graben.

===Hydrology===
Of the catchment area, around 9% lies in the Republic of Ireland and 91% in Northern Ireland; altogether 43% of the land area of Northern Ireland is drained into the lough, which itself flows out northwards to the sea via the River Bann. As one of its sources is the Upper Bann, the Lough can itself be considered as part of the Bann.
Lough Neagh is fed by many tributaries including the rivers Main (), Six Mile Water (), Upper Bann (), Blackwater (), Ballinderry () and Moyola ()

In 2023 and 2024, toxic algal blooms, mostly caused by agricultural run-off, spread across the lake.

===Islands and peninsulas===
*Coney Island
*Croaghan Island
*Derrywarragh Island
*Gartree Point
*Kinnegoe (peninsula)
*Kinturk (peninsula)
*Oxford Island (peninsula)
*Padian
*Ram&#x27;s Island
*Tolans Flat
*Traad (peninsula)

===Towns and villages===
Towns and villages near the Lough include Craigavon, Antrim, Crumlin, Randalstown, Toomebridge, Ballyronan, Ballinderry, Moortown, Ardboe, Brockagh, Maghery, Lurgan and Magherafelt.


===Counties===
Five of the six counties of Northern Ireland have shores on the Lough (only Fermanagh does not), and its area is split among them. The counties are listed clockwise:

#Antrim (eastern side and northern shore of the lake)
#Down (small part in the south-east)
#Armagh (south)
#Tyrone (west)
#Londonderry (northern part of west shore)

===Local government districts===
The area of the lake is split between four local government districts of Northern Ireland, which are listed clockwise:

* 3 Antrim and Newtownabbey, in the north-east
* 4 Lisburn and Castlereagh, in the east
* 6 Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon, in the south
* 9 Mid Ulster, in the west

== Management ==
Lough Neagh is managed by Lough Neagh Partnership Ltd, a stakeholder group made up of elected representatives, land-owners, fishermen, sand traders and local community representatives. Lough Neagh Partnership is responsible for the lough&#x27;s conservation, promotion and sustainable development together with navigation of the Lough.

==Uses==
Although the Lough is used for a variety of recreational and commercial activities, it is exposed and tends to get extremely rough very quickly in windy conditions.

===Water supply===

According to Northern Ireland Water, Lough Neagh supplies 40.7% of Northern Ireland&#x27;s drinking water. There have long been plans to increase the amount of water drawn from the lough, through a new water treatment works at Hog Park Point, but these are yet to materialise. The lough&#x27;s ownership by the 12th Earl of Shaftesbury has implications for planned changes to state-run domestic water services in Northern Ireland, as the lough is also used as a sewage outfall, and this arrangement is only permissible through Crown immunity.

===Navigation===
Traditional working boats on Lough Neagh include wide-beamed clinker-built, sprit-rigged working boats and smaller flat-bottomed &quot;cots&quot; and &quot;flats&quot;. Barges, here called &quot;lighters&quot;, were used until the 1940s to transport coal over the lough and adjacent canals. Until the 17th century, log boats (&quot;coití&quot;) were the main means of transport. Few traditional boats are left now, but a community-based group on the southern shore of the lough is rebuilding a series of working boats.

In the 19th century, three canals were constructed, using the lough to link various ports and cities: the Lagan Navigation provided a link from the city of Belfast, the Newry Canal linked to the port of Newry, and the Ulster Canal led to the Lough Erne navigations, providing a navigable inland route via the River Shannon to Limerick, Dublin and Waterford. The Lower Bann was also navigable to Coleraine and the Antrim coast, and the short Coalisland Canal provided a route for coal transportation. Of these waterways, only the Lower Bann remains open today, although a restoration plan for the Ulster Canal is currently in progress.

Lough Neagh Rescue provides a search and rescue service 24 hours a day and has 3 stations, situated around the lough. These are at Antrim, Ardboe and Kinnego Marinas, Kinnego being its headquarters and founding station. It is a voluntary service funded by the district councils bordering the Lough. Its members are highly trained and are a declared facility for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency which co-ordinates rescues on Lough Neagh.

===Bird watching===
Lough Neagh attracts birdwatchers from many nations due to the number and variety of birds which winter and summer in the boglands and shores around the lough.

===Flora===
The flora of the north-east of Northern Ireland includes the algae: &quot;Chara aspera&quot;, &quot;Chara globularis&quot; var. &quot;globularis&quot;, &quot;Chara globularis&quot; var. &quot;virgate&quot;, &quot;Chara vulgaris&quot; var. &quot;vulgaris&quot;, &quot;Chara vulgaris&quot; var. &quot;papillata&quot;, &quot;Tolypella&quot; &quot;nidifica&quot; var. &quot;glomerata&quot;. Records of Angiospermae include: &quot;Ranunculus flammula&quot; var. &quot;pseudoreptans&quot;, &quot;Ranunculus auricomus&quot;, &quot;Ranunculatus sceleratus&quot;, &quot;Ranunculatus circinatus&quot;, &quot;Ranunculatus peltatus&quot;, &quot;Thalictrum flavum&quot;, &quot;Thalictrum minus&quot; subsp. &quot;minus&quot;, &quot;Nymphaea alba&quot;, &quot;Ceratophyllum demersum&quot;, &quot;Subularia aquatic&quot;, &quot;Erophila verna&quot; sub. &quot;verna&quot;, &quot;Cardamine pratensis&quot;, &quot;Cardamine impatiens&quot;, &quot;Cardamine flexuosa&quot;, &quot;Rorippa palustris&quot;, &quot;Rorippa amphibia&quot;, &quot;Reseda luteola&quot;, &quot;Viola odorata&quot;, &quot;Viola reichenbachiana&quot;, &quot;Viola tricolor&quot; ssp. &quot;Violoa tricolor&quot; ssp. &quot;curtissi&quot;, &quot;Hypericum androsaemum&quot;, &quot;Hypericum maculatum&quot;, &quot;Elatine hydropiper&quot;, &quot;Silene vulgaris&quot;, &quot;Silene dioica&quot;, &quot;Saponaria officinalis&quot;, &quot;Cerastium arvense&quot;, &quot;Cerastium semidecandrum&quot;, &quot;Cerastium diffusum&quot;, &quot;Sagina nodosa&quot;, &quot;Spergularia rubra&quot;, &quot;Spergulaia rupicola&quot;, &quot;Chenopodium bonus-henricus&quot;, &quot;Chenopodium polyspermum&quot;.

===Fishing===
Eel fishing has been a major industry in Lough Neagh for centuries. These European eels make their way from the Sargasso Sea in the Atlantic Ocean, some along the Gulf Stream to the mouth of the River Bann, and then make their way into the lough. They remain there for some 10 to 15 years, maturing, before returning to the Sargasso to spawn. Today Lough Neagh eel fisheries export their eels to restaurants all over the world, and the Lough Neagh Eel has been granted Protected Geographical Status under European Union law.

Nobel laureate Seamus Heaney produced a collection of poems &quot;A Lough Neagh Sequence&quot; celebrating the eel-fishermen&#x27;s traditional techniques and the natural history of their catch.

Other fish species in the lake include dollaghan —a variety of brown trout native to the lake, salmon, trout, perch and pollan; bream, gudgeon, pike and rudd are also found, but are less common.

==Human history==
===Name===
The lough&#x27;s English name derives . At the start of the Plantation of Ulster, the English attempted to rename the lake &#x27;Lough Sydney&#x27; and &#x27;Lough Chichester&#x27;, in honour of the Lord Deputies, but these did not supplant the older name.

===Mythology and folklore===
In the Irish mythical tale &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; (&quot;the Battle of Moytura&quot;), Lough Neagh is called one of the twelve chief loughs of Ireland. The origin of the lake and its name is explained in an Irish tale that was written down in the Middle Ages, but is likely pre-Christian. According to the tale, the lake is named after Echaid (modern spelling: Eochaidh or Eachaidh), who was the son of Mairid (Mairidh), a king of Munster. Echaid falls in love with his stepmother, a young woman named Ébliu (Ébhlinne). They try to elope, accompanied by many of their retainers, but someone kills their horses. In some versions, the horses are killed by Midir (Midhir), which may be another name for Ébliu&#x27;s husband Mairid. Óengus (Aonghus) then appears and gives them an enormous horse that can carry all their belongings. Óengus warns that they must not let the horse rest or it will be their doom. However, after reaching Ulster the horse stops and urinates, and a spring rises from the spot. Echaid builds a house there and covers the spring with a capstone to stop its overflowing. One night, the capstone is not replaced and the spring overflows, drowning Echaid and most of his family, and creating &quot;Loch n-Echach&quot; (&quot;Loch nEachach&quot;, the lake of Eachaidh).

The character Echaid refers to the Dagda, a god of the ancient Irish who was also known as Echaid Ollathair (meaning &quot;horseman, father of all&quot;). Ébliu, Midir and Óengus were also names of deities. Dáithí Ó hÓgáin writes that the idea of a supernatural being creating the landscape with its own body is an ancient one common to many pre-Christian cultures. A Gaelic sept called the Uí Echach (&quot;descendants of Echaid&quot;) dwelt in the area and it is likely their name comes from the cult of the god. They gave their name to the territory of Iveagh.

Another tale tells how the lake was formed when Ireland&#x27;s legendary giant Fionn mac Cumhaill (Finn McCool) scooped up a chunk of earth and tossed it at a Scottish rival. It fell into the Irish Sea, forming the Isle of Man, while the crater left behind filled with water to form Lough Neagh.

===History===

In 839, a group of Vikings based a fleet on Lough Neagh, where they wintered during the winter of 840. Prior to the Tudor conquest of Ireland, the lough had been largely unclaimed by local Gaelic nobles, such as the O&#x27;Neill and O&#x27;Donnell dynasties. During the reign of Elizabeth I, an Englishman, Sir Hugh Clotworthy, settled near Antrim as part of the Plantation of Ulster and was granted the office of &quot;Captain of Lough Neagh&quot; by the Dublin Castle administration, being paid a stipend in return for maintaining boats on the lough to enforce the Crown&#x27;s authority. Clotworthy was succeeded in the office by the 1st Viscount Massereene and, subsequently, the 2nd Viscount Massereene. In 1660, Charles II of England gave the 1st Viscount Massereene the rights to the fish and bed of the lough. 

During the early seventeenth century, Sir Arthur Chichester (later created the 1st Baron Chichester) gradually laid claim to Lough Neagh during the Stuart conquest of Ulster, taking advantage of the Flight of the Earls. He first laid claim to the lough&#x27;s infrastructure, then to its boats, then the shores and finally the lough in its entirety, including all relevant fishing rights. It is possible he did this without approval from James VI and I. The lough was later inherited by Edward, 1st Viscount Chichester, Sir Arthur&#x27;s younger brother; Edward&#x27;s descendants later married into the Shaftesbury family. In 2012, it was reported that the 12th Earl of Shaftesbury was considering transferring ownership of the lough to the Northern Ireland Assembly. 

In October 2023, Lord Shaftesbury stated in an interview with BBC Northern Ireland that while he was open to selling Lough Neagh to the Northern Irish public, he would not give it away for free. He stated in the interview that &quot;the sale is one that&#x27;s borne out of an understanding that my ownership has always been very divisive and quite political and I always get blamed for things that are completely outside of my control. I feel it&#x27;s often used as an excuse for political inaction and I always want to do the right thing by the people living here and what&#x27;s in the best interest of the lough.&quot;

In February 2024 concerns were raised at the sudden collapse in insect numbers on the Lough and the likely effects this will have on biodiversity in the area.

== Algal Bloom Crises ==
Lough Neagh underwent catastrophic cyanobacteria or blue green algae bloom events in the summer of 2023 and 2024 which reached international news channels. This has led to numerous local community and environmental organization responses, such as a mock &quot;wake&quot; for the lake being held in protest and calls for drastic action to solve the problem. The size of these algal blooms in Lough Neagh has allowed them to be visible from space.

These algal blooms have the potential to have significant impacts on the lakes ecology due to the toxins they produce posing a serious risk to wildlife, including birds and fish, risking declines in populations and disrupting the food web. In addition, the growth of the algal blooms depletes oxygen in the water which can cause fish kills. There are also threats to human health from toxins and pathogens detected in the algal mats found in the lake.

These harmful algal blooms have a number factors contributing to their occurrence in Lough Neagh. The foremost contributory factor is the eutrophication of the lake with nutrients like phosphorus and nitrates which have provided suitable conditions for the algae to thrive. The lake has been classified as one of the world&#x27;s most hyper-eutrophic water-bodies due to chronic eutrophication occurring over many years. Key drivers of this eutrophication are increases in nitrates and phosphates in the lake which are generally attributed to runoff from agriculture in the form of animal slurry residue of chemical fertilizer in addition to human sewage. Research has indicated that 62% of the phosphorus inputs are from agricultural origins, 24% are from wastewater treatment works and 12% are from septic tanks.

A number of other environmental factors have contributed to the occurrence of the harmful algal blooms. Climate change has contributed to increasing summer temperatures of, and sunlight intensity on, the lake, creating more suitable conditions for rapid growth of harmful algal blooms. As the lake is relatively shallow with an average depth of 9m, its temperature can increase more rapidly than other deeper lakes, making it more susceptible to algal blooms. The invasive Zebra mussel mollusc species which has invaded the lake has resulted in the lake water having greater clarity and so penetration of light. The increase in light intensity deeper in the water column has increased the chance of harmful algal blooms occurring. The zebra mussel which is a filter feeder on phytoplankton in the lake, will selectively feed on existing existing phytoplankton species but not on the blue green algae, creating a lower ecological competition scenario for these algae.

<text>Platanus racemosa is a species of plane tree known by several common names, including California sycamore, western sycamore, California plane tree, and in North American Spanish . &quot;Platanus racemosa&quot; is native to California and Baja California, where it grows in riparian areas, canyons, floodplains, at springs and seeps, and along streams and rivers in several types of habitats. It can be found as far north as Tehama and Humboldt counties.

==Description==

This large tree grows to in height with a trunk diameter of up to one meter (three feet). The height of these trees ranges from . A specimen on the campus of Stanford University has a trunk girth (circumference) of . The trunk generally divides into two or more large trunks splitting into many branches. The bark is an attractive patchwork of white, tawny beige, pinkish gray, and pale brown. Both older bark and twigs on this plane sycamore become darker with time. The twigs and bark range from a light brownish gray to a shade resembling the color sepia.

&quot;Platanus racemosa&quot; is the dominant species in the globally and state endangered sycamore-alluvial woodland habitat.

The large palmately lobed leaves may be up to centimeters wide and have three or five pointed lobes. New leaves are a bright translucent green and somewhat woolly. The deciduous tree drops copious amounts of dry golden to orangish red leaves in the fall. The inflorescence is made up of a few spherical flower heads each around a centimeter wide. The female flower heads develop into spherical fruit clusters each made up of many hairy, maroon-red-woolly achenes. Depending on the sex, the inflorescence can either be red, if female, or chartreuse, if male. After the female clusters fertilize, the achenes bear a fruit that breaks apart and scatters just as the tree&#x27;s pollen does.

The tough and coarse-grained wood is difficult to split and work. It has various uses, including acting as a meat preparation block for butchers. Many small birds feed on its fruit, and several mammals eat its twigs and bark. The pollen resulting from the hairs on the leaves and flowers of Western sycamores can be allergens for some people. New leaves are susceptible to anthracnose canker, which, when it causes a side bud to become the new leader, can create picturesque angling trunks and branches on older specimens.

==Cultivation==
It is also widely planted horticulturally as a landscape tree in public landscapes and private gardens. While it requires some water, and can be grown in lawns, once established it is drought tolerant. New appreciation for how it shades sun in summer and lets sun through in winter has led to its use in green architecture and sustainable design.

== Uses ==
California sycamore wood is extremely hard and difficult to work, but can still be employed to create a variety of items such as buttons, tobacco boxes, furniture, wooden utensils, and barrels. The form and wide canopy of the species make it an effective shade tree. This western sycamore&#x27;s shade cools the surrounding bodies of water while simultaneously offering a home for some animals in the humid environment in which it flourishes.

== Ecology ==
Increased human interference has made the &quot;P. racemosa&quot; more susceptible to cross-breeding with other Platanus trees. This hybridization with other species like the &quot;P. x acerifolia&quot; offers the &quot;P. racemosa&quot; the advantage of resisting fungal diseases, namely the sycamore anthracnose. Interbred California sycamores are less vulnerable to this disease than the original &quot;P. racemosa&quot; as it harms their wood. However, sycamore anthracnose produces deadwood which creates a habitat for animals like wood ducks. The lack of non-hybridized &quot;P. racemosa&quot; thus harms the riparian woodlands in which they thrive.

Another disease that the &quot;P. racemosa&quot; is particularly receptive to is the &quot;Fusarium dieback&quot; which is carried and passed on through two kinds of invasive ambrosia beetles. Removing the tree itself is one way to prevent the significant harms of &quot;Fusarium dieback&quot; from spreading but a mixture of fungicides such as metconazole combined with an insecticide can additionally reduce the number of ambrosia beetles that transmit this disease. Close monitoring is required in order to prevent a substantial beetle infestation from occurring as that would damage the tree to the point of needing removal.

Further hybridization between the &quot;P. racemosa&quot; and &quot;P. x hispanica&quot; are a threat to the genetic diversity and identity of the former. The disease combatant advantage that the hybrid provides can bring about a decline in the native tree. The ensuing decline and genetic disintegration could not only harm the tree itself, but nesting birds, monarch butterflies, and numerous other small animals that reside or find shelter within the California sycamore&#x27;s shade. D. Whitlock&#x27;s study on the RNA of the &quot;Platanus&quot; trees near the Sacramento River reveals that &quot;P. racemosa&quot; contains genes from &quot;P. x hispanica,&quot; which consequently demonstrates the increased erasure of the former.

<text>City of Illusions is a 1967 science fiction novel by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin. It is set on Earth in the distant future, and is part of her Hainish Cycle. &quot;City of Illusions&quot; lays the foundation for the Hainish cycle which is a fictional universe in which the majority of Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s science fiction novels take place.

==Plot introduction==
&quot;City of Illusions&quot; takes place on Earth, also known as Terra, in the future, twelve hundred years after an enemy named the Shing has broken up the defunct League of All Worlds and taken up residence on Earth. The indigenous inhabitants of Earth have been reduced to small communities that are widely separated, living in highly independent rural communes, or in nomadic tribes. The Shing control the human population by using various strategies of indirect manipulation, which include divide and rule, as well as deceptive telepathic mental projection, known as mind-lying. In contrast, innately truthful telepathy, which is the only form of telepathy available to human beings, is known as mindspeech. The ability to lie during mindspeech is unique to the Shing.

Prior to the opening scene, the main character, who is a descendant of the protagonists in &quot;Planet of Exile&quot;, has been involved in a ship crash, and since the Shing do not believe in killing, has had his memory erased and been abandoned in the forest; this leaves his mind as a blank slate or &quot;tabula rasa&quot;. As the story begins he must develop a new self-identity &quot;ex nihilo&quot;.

==Plot summary==

=== The man without a memory ===
The story starts as a man is found by a small community (housed in one building) in a forest area in eastern North America. He is naked except for a gold ring on one finger, has no memory except of motor skills at a level equivalent to that of a one-year-old and has bizarre, amber, cat-like eyes. The villagers choose to welcome and nurture him, naming him Falk (Yellow). They teach him to speak, educate him about the Earth, and teach him from a book they consider holy, which is Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;long-translated&quot; version of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;. Also they teach him about the nature of the never-seen Shing.

===The journey===
After six years, Falk is told by the leader of the community that he needs to understand his origins, and therefore sets off alone for &quot;Es Toch&quot;, the city of the Shing in the mountains of western North America. He encounters many obstacles to learning the truth about himself and about the Shing, along with evidence of the barbarism of current human society. Along the way, it is sometimes put to him that the image he holds of the Shing is a distorted one; that they respect the idea of &#x27;reverence for life&#x27; and are essentially benevolent and non-alien rulers. This suggestion comes from Estrel, a young woman whom Falk meets after being captured by the &quot;Basnasska&quot; tribe in the great plains. Falk escapes this violent community with Estrel, to reach the city under her guidance. In the course of his journey Falk also encounters Shing-bred talking birds and animals who plead reverence for life in self-defense.

===The Shing===
Originally from an unknown, distant region of the galaxy, the Shing infiltrated and destroyed the League of All Worlds twelve hundred years before &quot;City of Illusions&quot; begins. The League had received prior warning of alien conquerors subduing distant worlds, and for generations had prepared defensive alliances and weaponry. However, when the Shing finally arrived, they were able to speedily subdue the 80 planets in the League, without encountering effective opposition.

The main weapon enabling this rapid and confused occupation is the Shing&#x27;s ability to lie in mindspeech. The Shing closely resemble humans though they seem to be unable to interbreed with them. Coming to Earth as invaders from a distant world the Shing, who are apparently not very many, establish themselves in a single fantastical city Es Toch. Under their rule the remainder of Earth declined into a thinly populated collection of backward and often mutually hostile tribal societies.

When Falk reaches Es Toch, Estrel betrays him into the hands of the Shing and laughs as she does so. He is told that he is part of the crew of a starship of alien / human hybrids from a planet called &quot;Werel&quot;. He meets a young man, Orry, who came with him in the ship. At this point it becomes clear that Estrel is a human collaborator working for the Shing, and that she had been sent to retrieve him from the wilds of the so-called &quot;Continent 1&quot;.

The Shing tell Falk that
* they are in fact humans;
* the conflict between the League and an alien invader never occurred: On the contrary, the League self-destructed through civil war and exploitation;
* the &quot;enemy&quot; is an invention of the Shing rulers themselves to try to ensure, through fear, that world peace endures under their benevolent, if misunderstood, governance;
* Falk&#x27;s expedition was attacked by rebels who then erased Falk&#x27;s memory of his previous self; and
* the Shing, who managed to save only Orry from the rebel attack, now want to restore Falk&#x27;s previous identity.
Falk however believes that the Shing are non-human liars and that their true intent is to determine for their own purposes the location of his home planet. Ruling through &quot;toolmen&quot; – human collaborators who are either computer-controlled or who have been raised to accept the Shing as benign human overlords, the only principle that the Shing seem to adhere to is their law of Reverence for Life. They appear as pathological liars, though Falk, concludes that &quot;the essence of their lying was a profound, irremediable lack of understanding&quot; of the peoples that they have conquered. Shing character, culture, architecture, and even clothing, are deliberately ambiguous and illusory.

The Shing also appear to keep vegan lifestyle. Their &quot;elaborately disguised foods were all vegetable&quot; and their law of Reverence for Life is often expressed by the animals it is meant to protect. Throughout his journey to Es Toch, the City of Illusions, Falk encounters animals who instinctively repeat the spoken / telepathic admonition &quot;Wrong to kill. Wrong to kill.&quot; Falk, however, suspects that this reverence is nothing more than a disguise for the Shing&#x27;s own extreme fear of death.

===Restored Memories===
Seeing no other way forward, Falk consents to have his memory tampered with.

The mind of the original Werelian, Agad Ramarren, is restored and the Falk personality is ostensibly destroyed. He emerges as a new person with pre-Falk memories and vastly greater scientific knowledge.

Having prepared a memory-restoring mnemonic trigger, that Falk had left for himself (an instruction, through young Orry, to read the beginning of the book he travels with, his translation of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;), the Falk personality is revived. After some instability Falk&#x27;s and Ramarren&#x27;s minds come to coexist. By comparing the knowledge given to them before and after Ramarren&#x27;s re-emergence, the joint minds are able to detect the essential dishonesty of the Shing&#x27;s rule and the fact that the alien conquerors can lie telepathically. It was this power that had enabled the not-very-numerous Shing, &quot;exiles or pirates or empire-builders from some distant star&quot;, to overthrow the League of All Worlds twelve centuries before.

The Werelians&#x27; mental powers are significantly greater than those of their human ancestors; they are able to recognize the Shing mindlie, and cannot be subverted as the member-worlds in the League were. The Shing&#x27;s cultural inhibition against killing and their dread of being killed leaves them with no effective defense against any armed and cautious expedition that arrived forewarned. Still ignorant of the survival of the Falk persona, the Shing hope to send Ramarren back to his home-world of Werel to present their idyllic story of Earth as a happy garden-planet prospering under their benign guidance, and in no need of outside help. Falk / Ramarren, now fully aware of the brutalized and misruled reality, pretends to accept this, postponing the return journey.

Eventually, while on a pleasure trip to view another part of the Earth, his Shing escort (Ken Kenyek) takes telepathic control of Ramarren but is then overcome by Falk, operating as a separate person. Now controlling Ken Kenyek, Falk / Ramarren makes his escape, manipulating his prisoner to find a light-speed ship that can take him home, and how to program it. Falk / Ramarren leaves for his planet of origin, taking Orry and the captive Ken Kenyek with him so that each can present their perception of Shing rule over Earth.

The military culture and recently restored advanced technology of the Werelians mean that Earth can probably be liberated &quot;at a blow&quot;. However the light-years of travel required mean that Falk&#x27;s forest friends will be long dead when he returns.

===Epilogue embedded in &quot;Left Hand of Darkness&quot;===
While &quot;City of Illusions&quot; concludes at this point, Falk / Ramarren&#x27;s mission apparently succeeds in bringing freedom to the Earth. In &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;, the Terran diplomat Genly Ai refers to the &quot;Age of the Enemy&quot; as something dreadful that is now past. He also knows of the Werelians, now called Alterrans. The fate of the Shing is not mentioned, either there or in any later book.

==Characters==
;Falk / Ramarren: The protagonist of the story, an enigmatic and initially unnamed character, is given the name Falk after stumbling into a rural community as a full grown man, suffering from amnesia. As Falk, he lives for more than a half decade, developing a new personna and deep connections with the peaceful, technologically limited Forest People, into whose presence he had stumbled. Falk departs from them on a long, hazardous, trans-continental quest to learn his identity and history. The narrative then reveals his past as Ramarren, navigator of an expedition to Earth from the distant planet Werel, that had somehow been stripped of his memories. When those are restored, Ramarren / Falk comes to possess the skills, knowledge, and character of both his original self, and of the person he had become in is sojourn on Earth.

;All-Alonio: A solitary, likewise enigmatic, and profound man Falk meets on his westward quest, who shelters Falk at a critical time, and gives him a &quot;slider,&quot; a type of hovercraft or flying machine. He provides Falk with oblique but pertinent guidance, most notably that the Shing are few in number and rule through lies and illusion.
;Estrel: Portrayed as Falk&#x27;s ally and lover, Estrel is later shown to be a human agent of the Shing tasked with bringing him to Es Toch convinced of the beneficial nature of their rule. She wears a necklace which appears to have religious significance, but is actually a communication device. Estrel eventually suffers a psychotic break-down,[4] attempts to kill Falk, and suffers an unknown fate at the hands of the Shing.
;Har Orry: A youth raised and largely brain-washed by the Shing. Other than Falk he is the only known survivor of the Werel expedition, two of whom were his parents. Like Estrel he is used by the Shing to convince Falk of their benign purposes. Passive and easily dominated he still shows traces of his childhood in a disciplined and hierarchical society.
;Ken Kenyek: A Shing mindhandler and scientist that Falk who together with fellow Shing Lords Abundibot and Kradgy, attempt to deceive and manipulate Falk. These are the only characters in the book identified as being Shing. Ken Kenyek appears as a detached and analytical figure, lacking the more sinister traits of his two fellow aliens.
;Parth: A young human woman of the Forest People, who helps re-educate Falk writing again on the &quot;tabula rasa&quot; that is Falk&#x27;s narrative-opening psyche. After becoming his lover she is forced to bid him farewell, hearing his promise of return but sensing that he will not return in her lifetime.
;Prince of Kansas: An elderly man who leads a sophisticated enclave of approximately 200 people living in the wilderness. He is in possession of luxuries such as a great library, domesticated dogs (otherwise extinct in this era), and a complex patterning frame that he uses to foretell Falk&#x27;s future. His miniature society appears benign but quixotic – setting off fire-crackers to repulse occasional Shing &quot;air-cars&quot; as they fly uncaringly overhead.
;Zove: The father-figure of the clan of Forest People that Falk stumbles upon before his quest, who helps Falk arrive at the conclusion that he must go on his quest, a figure that engages Falk in teaching-by-paradox (a method associated by a Le Guin scholar as resembling the sage Laozi).

==Publication history==
&quot;City of Illusions&quot; was Le Guin&#x27;s first novel that appeared as an independent paperback, unlike her earlier novels which appeared in the tête-bêche format. &quot;City of Illusions&quot; was initially published with no introduction, but Le Guin wrote an introduction for Harper &amp; Row&#x27;s 1978 hardcover edition. &quot;City of Illusions&quot; was re‑issued along with &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Planet of Exile&quot; in a 1978 omnibus volume titled &quot;Three Hainish Novels&quot;, and again in 1996 with the same novels in &quot;Worlds of Exile and Illusion&quot;.

== Literary significance and criticism ==

===Reception===
&quot;City of Illusions&quot;, like its two preceding Hainish novels, received little critical attention when it was published. Subsequently, it has not received as much critical attention as many of Le Guin&#x27;s other works.

In terms of its place in the development of the canon of science fiction, it has been noted that &quot;City of Illusions&quot; combines the sensibility of traditional British Science Fiction, images from American genre Science Fiction and anthropological ideas.

Wood (1986), regarding the initial Hainish trilogy as a whole, notes that &quot;innovative and entertaining fictions develop on the solid conceptual basis of human values affirmed&quot; She goes on to point out that philosophical speculation is the most important element of the novel. Bain (1986) points out that &quot;City of Illusions&quot;, like Le Guin&#x27;s novels &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot; and &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;, is permeated with a &quot;Taoist mythos&quot;.

One science fiction scholar points out that &quot;City of Illusions,&quot; along with &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Planet of Exile&quot; exhibits Le Guin&#x27;s struggle as an emerging writer to arrive at a plausible, uniquely memorable and straightforward locale for her stories.

The author herself makes several comments about &quot;City of Illusions&quot; in her introduction to the 1978 hardback edition. Le Guin was excited to use her own translation of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;. She was also interested in using physical and mental forests in the novel, and in imagining a less populated world, while still holding some type of civilization as a worthwhile, lofty ideal. Specifically she regrets the improbable and flawed depiction of the villains, the Shing, as not convincingly evil.

===Themes===
Defining and questioning the truth is the central issue of &quot;City of Illusions&quot;, which holds its roots in the always-truthful &quot;mindspeech&quot; introduced in &quot;Planet of Exile&quot; and the Shing&#x27;s ambiguous variation on it, called the &quot;mindlie&quot;.

Correspondingly, themes of illusion and ambiguity are central to the novel. The story is as much a post industrial-collapse science fiction tale as it is a mystery tale. It starts with a man with no memory, and with eyes whose appearance suggests he is not human, raising questions as to his true nature: Is he human or alien, and is he a tool or a victim of the alien enemy, the Shing? The Shing&#x27;s nature itself eventually comes into question through his journey. The theme of illusion and ambiguity is present throughout the book – both in terms of behavior (the main female character is initially a friend, then a betrayer, and ultimately maybe both) and even physical environment (the city Es Toch is a shimmering façade of visual deceptions).

Barbour (1986) points out that light / dark imagery is in an important and common thread that runs through Le Guin&#x27;s initial Hainish trilogy, tying in closely with Taoism in the &quot;Tao-te Ching&quot;, a book that has special meaning to the main character. Specifically in &quot;City of Illusions&quot; the main character&#x27;s story begins and ends in darkness, and among many other similar images, the city of Es Toch is described as a place of awful darkness and bright lights.

Although Le Guin based the location of Es Toch on the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, Bittner (1986) points out that the city, like many of Le Guin&#x27;s imaginary landscapes, is both an image and a symbol with underlying psychological value and meaning, in this case an underlying chasm. Wood (1986) furthers this notion pointing out the city is &quot;built across a chasm in the ground, a hollow place.&quot;

Spivack (1984) points out that &quot;City of Illusions&quot; includes Le Guin&#x27;s focus on the concept of contrasts, in particular the need for reconciliation of opposites, a concept related to Taoism, that must take place in Falk&#x27;s divided mind.

One notable theme of &quot;City of Illusions&quot; is that of isolation and separation, with the story focusing heavily on one character who does not connect well with other characters.

A minor theme of exploring an oppressive male-dominated culture is present, represented by the misogynistic Bee-Keepers.

It has been suggested that the novel also explores theme of anarchism in the original village and its neighbors, which display communal living.

===Objects===
The patterning frame, a device which Falk encounters twice, is notable. He first sees a simple one at Zove&#x27;s house and then later a more complex one that belongs to the Prince of Kansas. The device uses moveable stones on crossing wires as a representation of the physical world; its use as a fortune-telling device, computer, toy, or mystical implement is vague. Scholars have noted that it is a foreshadowing device and used to attain a coexistence of the past, present and future, a notable aspect of Taoism.

It has been suggested that the book &quot;The Old Canon&quot;, the book of the Way, the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;, has talismanic properties in the narrative. As a mere object it is an inspiring book; Falk is given a luxurious copy by Zove before he sets out on his travels. After Falk loses this copy, the Prince of Kansas gives him a replacement from his vast library.

Its first page is the mnemonic trigger that Falk uses to restore his memories and personality to his and Ramarren&#x27;s shared mind after it is erased by the Shing (see above).

<text>The Tamil United Liberation Front (, ) is a political party in Sri Lanka.

==Formation==
On 4 May 1972, several Tamil political groups, including the Federal Party (ITAK), Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC), and All Ceylon Tamil Congress formed the Tamil United Front (TUF) under the joint leadership of S.J.V. Selvanayagam, S. Thondaman, and G.G. Ponnambalam. The TUF changed its name to Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) and adopted the demand for an independent state to be known as the &quot;secular, socialist state of Tamil Eelam&quot;. The CWC declined to support the newly formed TULF.

==1977 Parliamentary General Election==
In the first general election contested by the TULF, the 1977 Sri Lankan parliamentary election, in which the UNP won by a landslide, the TULF won 6.40% of the popular vote and 18 out of 168 seats in the Sri Lankan parliament, including all 14 seats in the Northern Province.

Votes and seats won by the TULF by electoral district
The TULF became the official opposition as a result of the rout of the SLFP. The TULF&#x27;s success would lead to riots in which hundreds of Tamils were murdered by Sinhalese mobs.

Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, the TULF was frequently blamed by nationalist Sinhalese politicians for acts of violence committed by militant groups such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). In fact, the TULF represented an older, more moderate generation of Tamils that felt independence could be achieved without violence, unlike the LTTE, who believed in armed conflict.

In October 1983, all the TULF legislators, numbering sixteen at the time, forfeited their seats in Parliament for refusing to swear an oath unconditionally renouncing support for a separate state in accordance with the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

During the 1980s, the LTTE began to see the TULF as a rival in its desire to be considered the sole representative of the Tamils of the north and east. Over the next two decades, the LTTE assassinated several TULF leaders, including A. Amirthalingam and Neelan Thiruchelvam.

==1989 Parliamentary General Election==
The TULF formed an alliance with the three Indian-backed paramilitary groups, Eelam National Democratic Liberation Front (ENDLF), Eelam People&#x27;s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF), and Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), to contest the 1989 Sri Lankan parliamentary election. The alliance won 3.40% of the popular vote and 10 out of 225 seats in the Sri Lankan parliament.

==1994 Parliamentary General Election==
In the 1994 Sri Lankan parliamentary election, in which the People&#x27;s Alliance, led by Chandrika Kumaratunga, came to power after seventeen years of UNP rule, the TULF won 1.60% of the popular vote and 5 out of 225 seats in the Sri Lankan parliament.

==2000 Parliamentary General Election==
In the 2000 Sri Lankan parliamentary election, in which the People&#x27;s Alliance, led by Ratnasiri Wickremanayake, retained power, the TULF won 1.23% of the popular vote and 5 out of 225 seats in the Sri Lankan parliament.

==2001 Parliamentary General Election==
==Split==
TULF President V. Anandasangaree, a critic of the Tamil Tigers, left the Tamil National Alliance when it took a pro-Tamil Tigers stance in the 2004 general election. Anandasangaree gained control of the TULF after a legal battle, forcing the TULF members who wanted to remain in the TNA to resurrect the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi, which is now a constituent party of the TNA.

==2004 Parliamentary General Election==
The legal battle over the control of the TULF meant that the party, led by V. Anandasangaree, contested as an independent group and only in one electoral district in the 2004 Sri Lankan parliamentary election, winning 0.06% of the popular vote and no seats in the Sri Lankan parliament.

==2010 Parliamentary General Election==
In the 2010 Sri Lankan parliamentary election, in which the United People&#x27;s Freedom Alliance, led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, retained power, the TULF led, by V. Anandasangaree, won 0.11% of the popular vote and no seats in the Sri Lankan parliament.

<doc id="428741" wikidata="Q4971539" url="?curid=428741" title="Britt Cobb">
<text>W. Britt Cobb, Jr. is a former North Carolina government official. His last position was as chief of staff for North Carolina Governor Beverly Perdue until she left office in January 2013. Previously, he had served as her Secretary of Administration (a member of Governor&#x27;s Cabinet). Cobb was also Commissioner of Agriculture for the state of North Carolina between June 2003 and February 2005. He was appointed to the post in June 2003 following the resignation of Agriculture Commissioner Meg Scott Phipps and lost a hotly disputed race for the seat in 2004 to Republican Steve Troxler.

==Early life, education and career==
Cobb was born in Elm City, North Carolina, and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in business administration from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Cobb began working for the North Carolina Department of Agriculture shortly after his graduation as a food-distribution representative, and was the first agriculture director at North Carolina&#x27;s European Office in West Germany during the late 1970s.

In 1991, Cobb was named assistant director of marketing for the Agriculture department, and he was appointed to the post of interim agriculture commissioner in June 2003 following the resignation of Meg Scott Phipps.

==Agriculture Commissioner==
Cobb&#x27;s appointment by Governor Mike Easley as North Carolina Commissioner of Agriculture was made official in December 2003; that same month, he announced his candidacy for the post in the 2004 statewide general elections. Cobb faced Republican Steve Troxler and finished only about 2,000 votes behind his opponent; however, 4,000 lost votes in Carteret County led to an extended legal dispute, in which Cobb and his attorneys pressed for a new statewide election for the race. On February 4, 2005, Cobb conceded the race and Troxler was sworn in as Agriculture Commissioner on February 8.

==Secretary of Administration==
In 2005, Cobb became a Deputy Secretary in the North Carolina Department of Administration, and in January 2006, Governor Easley appointed him Secretary for the Department, succeeding Secretary Gwynn Swinson. In 2009, newly elected Governor Beverly Perdue chose to keep Cobb in her cabinet.

<doc id="428742" wikidata="Q1324820" url="?curid=428742" title="Elaine Marshall">
<text>Elaine Folk Marshall (born November 18, 1945) is an American attorney and politician who has served as the North Carolina Secretary of State since 1997. A member of the Democratic Party, she is the first woman to be elected to statewide office in North Carolina. Marshall was also the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for the United States Senate seat then held by Republican Richard Burr in the 2010 election. In 2020, Marshall was re-elected to a seventh term as North Carolina Secretary of State. In 2024, she was reelected to an eighth term winning with 51 percent of the vote.

==Early life, education, and career==
Marshall was born on November 18, 1945, in Lineboro, Maryland. Her father was a farmer who, for many years, served as a volunteer fire fighter and community leader, and her mother was the organist in the family&#x27;s small rural church for more than 60 years. She attended public schools as a child and became the first person in her family to graduate college. She studied textiles at the University of Maryland from 1964 to 1968, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Textiles and Clothing. While at Maryland, she became a member of Alpha Gamma Delta. During her undergraduate years, she spent her summers working as a camping director for the Maryland 4-H Foundation, an organization she has continued to support.

After graduation, Marshall taught in the public schools of Lenoir County, North Carolina, and then ran a book and gift store. She later returned to the field of education as an instructor at Lenoir Community College and Johnston Technical Community College.

Marshall returned to school to study law at the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law at Campbell University and earned her Juris Doctor degree in 1981, where she was accepted into the &quot;Who&#x27;s Who Among American Universities and Colleges&quot; honors program. She has been admitted to practice before all North Carolina courts, the U.S. District courts in the Eastern and Middle Districts of North Carolina, the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the United States Supreme Court. She is a member of the NC State Bar, the NC Bar Association, the NC Association of Women Attorneys, and the Delta Theta Phi legal fraternity. She also holds multiple honorary degrees from Campbell University, Meredith College, Lees–McRae College and Testemitanu State University. She was a partner in Lillington, North Carolina law firms Bain &amp; Marshall (1985–1992) and Marshall &amp; Marshall (1993–1997).

==Political career==
From the early 1970s, she was active in the Young Democrats organization and eventually became National Secretary of the Young Democrats of America. In Harnett County, where she practiced law, Marshall served in 1983–1987 as President of Democratic Women and in 1991–1992 served as chair of the Harnett County Democratic Party.

===State senator===
Marshall was first elected to public office in 1992 as a member of the North Carolina Senate representing the 15th Senate District, serving from 1993 to 1995.

===Secretary of State===

In 1996, she ran for the post of North Carolina Secretary of State against Republican challenger and former stock car racer Richard Petty. She won the election by a margin of 53% to 45%, becoming the first woman elected to a statewide executive office in North Carolina history. Marshall has won re-election six times and in 2008 received the second highest vote total of any candidate in the state. Elaine Marshall is only the third elected Secretary of State of North Carolina since 1936, as office-holders have commonly been re-elected many times. Marshall has been credited with bringing the office into the technological age by introducing e-commerce and providing online registration for lobbyists and businesses. Marshall&#x27;s work has been recognized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Notary Association and Campbell University. In 2007, Marshall served as president of the National Electronic Commerce Coordinating Council, &quot;an organization of public and private sector leaders aimed at identifying best technology practices that make government agencies more efficient and modernize their services&quot;.

===U.S. Senate campaigns===
====2002====
In 2002, Marshall ran for United States Senate in the race to replace retiring Sen. Jesse Helms. However, she was defeated in the Democratic primary by Erskine Bowles, who served as White House Chief of Staff under President Bill Clinton.

====2010====

In 2009, Marshall decided to enter the 2010 Senate race against incumbent Republican Richard Burr. She faced Cal Cunningham, Ken Lewis, and other lesser-known candidates in the May 2010 primary, and won the endorsement of &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;. After failing to garner above 40% of the vote in the May 4 primary election, Marshall had to face Cunningham in a runoff in June.

On June 22, 2010, Marshall defeated Cunningham (with approximately 60 percent of the vote) to secure the Democratic nomination. For the general election, she was again endorsed by &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;, the state&#x27;s largest newspaper. On election day Marshall lost to incumbent Richard Burr, who had received 55% of the vote.

==Personal life==
Marshall has five stepchildren and seven grandchildren. She is Methodist.

Marshall married attorney Bill Holdford in 2001. Holdford had two daughters from a previous relationship. He died in 2009 from cancer. Marshall married J. Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Bunn in 2017 which they remained married until his death in 2023.

<doc id="428745" wikidata="Q2992593" url="?curid=428745" title="Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship">
<text>The Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship was a Rosicrucian group founded by George Alexander Sullivan in about 1924. It may have existed under the name The Order of Twelve from 1911 to 1914 and again from 1920. The ROCF operated first from the Liverpool area of England and then after the mid-1930s from the Christchurch area. Its members studied esoteric subjects from lectures, plays and correspondence material prepared by George Alexander Sullivan.

In 1930, a group of members of the order local to the Christchurch area began to meet regularly at a pub in Christchurch, and at about the same time the annual &#x27;conclave&#x27; was held in nearby Bournemouth. Some time later the group decided that a more permanent venue was required.

The group&#x27;s headquarters near Christchurch was a wooden building named the &quot;Ashrama Hall&quot;, completed in 1936 in the garden of a house owned by Catherine Emily Chalk, who probably also started the original meetings in the pub. In 1938, on the same land, the group built the &quot;Christchurch Garden Theatre&quot;, which called itself &#x27;The First Rosicrucian Theatre in England&#x27;. From June–September 1938 it presented mystically themed plays, written by Sullivan under his journalistic pen-name Alex Matthews.

Sabina Magliocco, in her examination of the influences of the study of folklore on the development of Wicca, considers it possible that by the late 1930s some members of the Crotona Fellowship were performing Wicca-like rituals based on Co-Masonry, and that this was the group referred to by Gerald Gardner as the &#x27;New Forest Coven&#x27;.

The numbers attending Rosicrucian Order Crotona Fellowship events always were small, and the group is best known today for its association with Gerald Gardner and Peter Caddy. Following the death of George Alexander Sullivan in 1942, the group&#x27;s activities and membership diminished. By the early 1950s their focus had moved to Southampton. Correspondence between former members suggests the Order &#x27;existed in memory only&#x27; by the early 1970s. The Order&#x27;s library was deposited at the University of Southampton in 1977.

A significant minority among students of Alice Bailey&#x27;s Arcane School were members of the Crotona Fellowship.

<text>Meg Scott Phipps is an American former politician and convicted felon who served as the Commissioner of Agriculture for the state of North Carolina from 2001 to 2003.

==Early life and education==
From Mebane, North Carolina, she is the daughter of former North Carolina governor Bob Scott and Jessie Rae Scott, as well as the granddaughter of former U.S. Senator and North Carolina Governor W. Kerr Scott. Phipps is a 1978 graduate of Wake Forest University and a 1981 graduate of the Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law at Campbell University. She also received her Masters in Law in Agricultural Law from the University of Arkansas School of Law. 

==Career==
A Democrat, she was elected to the position of Agriculture Commissioner in November 2000. Controversy erupted less than a month into her term when she selected a new midway vendor for the North Carolina State Fair, replacing a longtime vendor, who immediately filed suit against the state.

In May 2001, allegations emerged of inappropriate use of campaign funds from her 2000 campaign.

===Resignation and criminal charges===
After two campaign aides were indicted and one pleaded guilty to federal fraud and extortion charges, North Carolina Governor Mike Easley asked Phipps to resign her position. On June 6, 2003, she resigned and was replaced by interim commissioner Britt Cobb.

In October 2003, Phipps was tried and found guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice charges; soon afterwards, she pleaded guilty to five of the original 30 federal charges against her, including fraud, conspiracy, and witness tampering. In March 2004, she was sentenced to four years in federal prison and served her sentence at Alderson Federal Prison Camp in West Virginia.

While in prison, Phipps became friends with Martha Stewart, who was also incarcerated there. While serving her sentence, Phipps taught English and other courses to her fellow inmates. She was briefly allowed out to attend her brother Kerr&#x27;s funeral.

== Later life ==
On April 23, 2007, Phipps was released from prison. Hawfields Presbyterian Church hired her as its director of Christian education. Monitored by an ankle bracelet for six months, she could only leave her house to tend to work-related affairs. After three years she was hired by Alamance Community College to teach women&#x27;s studies and undertook further education at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, earning a Master of Arts degree. She later worked as an administrator for assisted living facilities in Mebane and Chapel Hill before retiring and moving with her husband to Lake Lure in 2017.

<doc id="428748" wikidata="Q5024016" url="?curid=428748" title="Caltron 6 in 1">
<text>Caltron 6 in 1 is a multicart developed and published in 1992 for the NES in North America by Caltron Industries, Inc. (credited as Caltron Ind. Inc.), a Taiwan-based video game company which was either closely related to, or simply a pseudonym for, NTDEC. In Australia, it was published under the title &quot;Real Player‘s Pak&quot; by HES. Dynacom released the cartridge as &quot;Multi Ação 6-in-1&quot; for the Brazilian market. All the featured games, except Porter, were released as single game cartridges in Spain by Gluk Video.

As its title suggests, &quot;6 in 1&quot; consists of six different games in various genres, which mostly are popular clones of the era. It is composed of: &quot;Cosmos Cop&quot;, &quot;Adam &amp; Eve&quot;, &quot;Magic Carpet 1001&quot;, &quot;Balloon Monster&quot;, &quot;Porter&quot;, and &quot;Bookyman&quot;. These titles were all previously released as stand-alone Famicom format by NTDEC, often under their U.S. brand Mega Soft.

The compilation has received poor reviews, with one reviewer claiming that all six games on the multicart are &quot;uniformly awful [and] barely first-generation NES quality&quot;, even though they are more playable and are of &quot;much higher quality&quot; than other unlicensed video game compilations, specifically citing Active Enterprises&#x27; infamous &quot;Action 52&quot; as the comparative example.

==Games==
* Cosmos Cop is a pseudo-3D into-the-screen shoot &#x27;em up similar to Sega&#x27;s &quot;Space Harrier&quot;. However, the game experiences a lot of image breakup on the screen due to the NES&#x27;s limited capability of handling first-person scaling.
* Magic Carpet 1001 is a horizontal scrolling shooter that was later released on pirate cartridges as &quot;Aladdin III&quot;, and with some graphical and sound modifications as &quot;Super Harry Potter&quot;. Besides being the only original title on the cartridge, it has been criticized for its steep difficulty curve.
* Balloon Monster is a clone of Mitchell&#x27;s arcade game &quot;Pang&quot; (&quot;Buster Bros.&quot; in North America).
* Adam &amp; Eve is a single-screen platform game similar to &quot;Balloon Fight&quot; by Nintendo (itself based on &quot;Joust&quot; by Williams Electronics), in which the player has to kill snakes by bursting the balloons attached to their heads. It also received criticism in that had very little relevance to the homonym biblical story.
* Porter is a puzzle video game similar to Thinking Rabbit&#x27;s &quot;Sokoban&quot; and &quot;Boxxle&quot; (the first was created by Hiroyuki Imabayashi), where the player has to move boxes into specifically–marked places. Criticized for its controls; boxes can only be moved while holding down the A button, and if the B button is accidentally pressed, the level automatically restarts without any warning to the player.
* Bookyman is a direct &quot;Brush Roller&quot; hack, the clone of another arcade game: Alpha Denshi&#x27;s &quot;Crush Roller&quot; (&quot;Make Trax&quot; in North America and Europe), programmed by Hwang Shinwei in 1990. Both were considered inferior to their arcade counterpart.

==Myriad version==

When Caltron Industries, Inc. was going out of business, a company based in Kingwood, Texas named Myriad Games, Inc., bought all of their existing inventory of tan cartridges. Myriad then took the carts and added a very generic (no graphic art) label. They were then packaged in custom boxes with a folded manual. Each Myriad cart and box were numbered individually.

Myriad&#x27;s only change to Caltron&#x27;s product was to replace the label with their own. In fact, the edges of the Caltron label are still visible, as the Myriad label is slightly too small to cover it. No programming changes were done, hence the game is exactly the same, including the title screen which still reads &quot;Caltron&quot;. The six games on the cart are identical to Caltron&#x27;s release.

Shortly after the release of &quot;6 in 1&quot;, Myriad went out of business for unknown reasons. The game has become one of the rarest unlicensed games made for the NES. Collectors speculate that fewer than 100 copies of this game still exist, and even fewer are complete. The most valuable copies of the game are those with the box, instructions and cartridge with matching serial numbers. The lowest known serial number is 000003 and the highest is 000888. At least two sealed versions are known to exist.

<doc id="428749" wikidata="Q3160645" url="?curid=428749" title="Jake Sisko">
<text>Jake Sisko is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. He appears in the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (&quot;DS9&quot;) and is portrayed by actor Cirroc Lofton. He is the son of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; commanding officer, Benjamin Sisko. The character also appears in various other &quot;Star Trek&quot; books, comics, and video games.

==Storyline==
Jake Sisko first appeared in the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; series premiere. Jake is introduced as an adolescent, played by Thomas Hobson, who moves to the Deep Space Nine station three years after the death of his mother aboard USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; in the Battle of Wolf 359. In the season two episode &quot;Shadowplay&quot;, Jake&#x27;s age is stated as 15. This puts him at about 20 by the end of the series.

On the station, Jake becomes friends with a Ferengi named Nog, the son of Rom, despite the disapproval of both of their fathers. When Rom pulls Nog out of Keiko O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s school, Jake secretly tutors him.

Jake aspires to be a writer, although he declined a scholarship to the Pennington School (New Zealand) in 2371. He briefly dated a Bajoran dabo girl named Mardah against his father&#x27;s wishes, who embarrasses Jake by revealing his penchant for dom-jot hustling and poetry. In 2372, Jake wrote a draft of his first novel, &quot;Anslem&quot;, under the influence of Onaya, an alluring alien woman who feeds on creative neural energy by tactile absorption through the cranium (&quot;The Muse&quot;).

As Jake became a young adult, he felt the need for independence and moved out of his father&#x27;s quarters to become roommates with Nog, now a Starfleet Academy cadet on &quot;DS9&quot; for field study. Jake&#x27;s slovenliness and Nog&#x27;s new-found neatness initially strain their friendship, until Benjamin Sisko, Nog&#x27;s commander and Jake&#x27;s father, orders them to settle their differences.

In an alternate timeline (&quot;The Visitor&quot;), Benjamin Sisko is thrust into an odd sub-space dimension after being struck by an errant energy bolt in the USS &quot;Defiant&quot; engine room. After the accident, Sisko is presumed dead, but he later appears to Jake several times throughout his life. After a short but successful career as a novelist (including the publication of &quot;Anslem&quot;), Jake spent the rest of his life trying to understand and reverse the accident. Jake learned that since his father and he were in close proximity when the accident occurred, a strange side effect has been causing Jake to act as a sort of anchor to his father in sub-space throughout the years, occasionally pulling Benjamin Sisko into the real world. Jake determined that if he takes his own life during one of these visits, the connection will be severed and Ben will return to the time of the accident. When he is dying (of natural causes, as an old man) Jake released his father during a final &quot;visit&quot; and his father returned to the past, dodges the energy bolt, and prevents this timeline from occurring (Jake as an older man is portrayed in this episode by Tony Todd).

Jake introduces his father to freighter captain Kasidy Yates, with whom Benjamin becomes romantically involved and marries in the final months of the Dominion War. During the Dominion occupation of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, Jake remains there and serves as a reporter for the Federation News Service, though most of his work is suppressed by Weyoun and the Dominion authorities. Nevertheless, he is able to secretly send messages to his father through Morn.

Jake Sisko does not have a counterpart in the Mirror Universe. Mirror counterparts of Benjamin and Jennifer exist there, but they separate without having a child.

In the series finale, his father joins the Prophets, leaving Jake and Kasidy at &quot;DS9&quot; for the final scene of the series. It is not clear if they remain there.

<doc id="428755" wikidata="Q43465" url="?curid=428755" title="Britannia Beach">
<text>Britannia Beach (Sḵwx̱wú7mesh: Shisháyu7áy, ) is a small unincorporated community in the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District located approximately 55 kilometres north of Vancouver, British Columbia on the Sea-to-Sky Highway on Howe Sound. It has a population of about 300. It includes the nearby Britannia Creek, a small to mid-sized stream that flows into Howe Sound that was historically one of North America&#x27;s most polluted waterways.

The community first developed between 1900 and 1904 as the residential area for the staff of the Britannia Mining and Smelting Company. The residential areas and the mining operation were physically interrelated, resulting in coincidental mining and community disasters through its history.

Today, the town is host to the Britannia Mine Museum, formerly known as the British Columbia Museum of Mining, on the grounds of the old Britannia Mines. The mine&#x27;s old Concentrator facilities, used to separate copper ore from its containing rock, are a National Historic Site of Canada.

==History==
The first settler/European person to sail the South Western inlet of what is now British Columbia was George Vancouver in 1792. When surveying the waters, George Vancouver gave name to the area, Howe Sound, in honour of Admiral Richard Howe. Britannia Beach took its name from the nearby Britannia Range of mountains, which form the east wall of the mountainous shore of Howe Sound south of Britannia Beach. About 1859 Royal Navy hydrographer Captain Richards of HMS &quot;Plumper&quot; named the range of mountains for HMS &quot;Britannia&quot;, the third of a series of vessels to bear that name. The &quot;Britannia&quot; was never in these waters.
===Copper mine (1888-1974)===

A copper discovery on Britannia Mountain by Dr. A. A. Forbes in 1888 led to the development of the Britannia Mine. 10 years after Dr. A. A. Forbes discovered copper, Oliver Furry made 5 claims in the surrounding area. In 1899, a mining engineer named George Robinson was able to convince financial backers that the property had great potential. For several years, companies were formed, merged and dissolved in efforts to raise capital. Large scale mining began in 1903 with the completion of a concentrator that had a 200 ton capacity which was funded by Grant B. Schley. The Britannia Mining and Smelting Company, a branch of the Howe Sound Company, finally commenced mining in the early 1900s, and owned the site for the next sixty years. The first ore was shipped to the Crofton Smelter on Vancouver Island in 1904, and the mine achieved full production in 1905.

A town had grown up around the mine and a post office opened on January 1, 1907 where it was named after the nearby mine.

In 1912 John Wedderburn Dunbar Moodie was authorized to upgrade the operation and increase production from the mine. Improvements in the mineral separation processes stimulated plans for a new mill (No. 2), which was completed in 1916 and was capable of producing 2000 tons of ore per day. The onset of World War I increased the demand for copper and the price rose sharply.

On March 21, 1915 an avalanche destroyed the Jane Camp. Sixty men, women and children were killed and it was a terrible blow to the tiny community. Construction began immediately on a new, safer town at the level above the Britannia Beach site. This portion of the community became known as the &quot;Town site&quot; or &quot;Mount Sheer&quot;.

In March 1921 during a brief period when the mine was shut down, mill No. 2 burnt to the ground.

On October 28, 1921 after a full day of torrential rain, a massive flood destroyed much of that portion of the community and mine operations that existed on the lower beach area. 50 of 110 homes were destroyed and thirty-seven men, women and children lost their lives. The flood was caused because the mining company had dammed up a portion of the Creek during the construction of a railway, and when this dam gave way the town below was flooded. Carleton Perkins Browning directed the reconstruction of this portion of the community and the new No. 3 mill, which stands today.

Being an isolated, close knit community which could only be accessed by boat, life in both of Britannia&#x27;s towns was never dull. The Britannia Mining and Smelting Company tried to minimize turnover by providing amenities and implementing family-friendly policies. Facilities included libraries, club rooms, billiard rooms, swimming pools, tennis courts and even bowling. A thriving social calendar saw sporting events, theatrical productions, dances, movies and parties held throughout the year.

The mine boomed in the late 1920s and early 1930s, becoming the largest producer of copper in the British Commonwealth by 1929, under the management of the mine manager C.P. Browning.

In the 1940s there were talks to build an artist village in Britannia&#x27;s hills, but that plan did not proceed.

Miners unionized in 1946 and suffered through their first strike. Low copper prices saw the Britannia Mine Company reduced to seven employees, and in 1959 it went into liquidation.

In 1963 the Anaconda Mining Company bought the property and production continued for the next eleven years. 300 employees managed to produce 60,000 tons of concentrate each year. Ferries services stopped around May 1965 after the highway and railway connections had been constructed. The connections made it easier to transport the copper, but high operating costs and taxes eventually forced the mine to close on November 1, 1974. The company did not attempt to clean up the mine and chemical wastes that it produced, since environmental protection laws had not yet been enacted and enforcement of the Fisheries Act was never applied. A newly elected labour government presented higher anticipated union costs and the ore vein had already been &#x27;highgraded&#x27;. With the closure of the mine, the economy of the town diminished rapidly, and the railway station shut down soon after. Residents responded to the closure of the mine with a museum plan, preserving the copper concentrator and other historic buildings as part of the British Columbia Mining Museum [now Britannia Mine Museum].

== Population (1888-1974) ==
Though the early settlers of Britannia Beach were primarily single white men, the company town was considered quite diverse. According to the Britannia Mine Museum:

&quot;Workers at the Britannia Mine came from far and wide. It was recorded that people from 50 nationalities came to work here. Most of those came from Canada and Europe - for example in 1948, 48% of workers were Canadian, 47% were European, 2% were classed as &#x27;Oriental&#x27;, and 1% was American.&quot;

Though there was a minor Asian population in Britannia Beach, they played a prominent role in the town. Since Bill No. 47 was passed in 1900 by the Canadian Government, Japanese and Chinese workers were not permitted to work underground, but were able to take jobs above the ground.

==Britannia Creek pollution==

Prior to the reclamation work undertaken by the University of British Columbia and the Provincial Government, the clear and transparent water in Britannia Creek suggested a pristine environment, however the clear water was actually an indication that no living creatures could survive in it. The water could not be consumed by humans either.

Although mining at Britannia Creek stopped in 1974, runoff and rainwater that flow through the mine&#x27;s abandoned tunnels combine with oxygen and the high sulfide content of the waste rock to create a condition called acid rock drainage (ARD). As a result of ARD, Britannia Creek became severely polluted. And, for close to a century prior to December, 2001, polluted run-off was being deposited directly into Howe Sound via Jane Creek and Britannia Creek; as much as 450 kilograms (close to one thousand pounds) of copper was entering Howe Sound daily.
A strip of coastal waters along Britannia Beach was seriously polluted, affecting 4.5 million juvenile chum salmon from the Squamish Estuary. A federal fisheries report revealed that spring salmon held in cages off Britannia Creek died in less than 48 hours because of the toxic metals in the water, whereas fish held off Porteau Cove to the south, had a 100% survival rate.

In the summer of 2001, the Province of British Columbia formally announced that a large-scale treatment plant would be built to neutralize the run-off coming from the old mine site. Although the treatment plant did not become fully operational until 2006, its construction marked a pivotal turning point for Howe Sound and the community of Britannia Beach. The plant, now operated by EPCOR Utilities, treats an average of 4.2 billion liters of run-off annually, removing an average of 226,000 kilograms of heavy metal contaminants.
Engineers from the Centre for Environmental Research in Minerals, Metals, and Materials at The University of British Columbia also installed a concrete plug in the Level adit in December 2001 as the initial step in constructing a more substantial &quot;Millennium Plug&quot;. The idea for the installation was to create a laboratory to study ways to seal mine adits using bulk materials. At the same time the installation would immediately stop all pollution from the 2200 Level into Jane Creek, a tributary of Britannia Creek. Field monitoring done in 2003, using intertidal algae and mussels as ecological indicators, showed that the recovery of coastal biological communities was actually minimal. However, recovery of Britannia Creek was significant and the amount of copper and zinc in the total discharge waters declined by about 20%.

As part of the reclamation work undertaken by the Provincial government, since 2004 they are undertaking an environmental monitoring program the recovery of Britannia Creek and Howe Sound. Initial assessments show significant recovery, however, the Provincial government has not yet completed its comprehensive environmental impact assessment to confirm this conclusion. Following completion of the Water Treatment Plant it was estimated that 90% of the pollution to Howe Sound had been stopped. Optimization of the groundwater management system by 2008, further increased the reduction to 98-99%.

In 2011, pink salmon returned to Britannia Creek for the first time in over a century. Other species that have returned to Howe Sound include killer whales and Pacific white-sided dolphins are now regularly seen near the creek&#x27;s outlet.

== Events and Activities ==
During its successful years, Britannia Beach had many events for people to enjoy. The first of these being Miners Day. This was a day of celebration to honour those who kept the town going, the miners. Many events took place during Miners day which included drilling, mucking, diving (aquatic), running, and bicycle decorating competitions. The second major event was the Copper Queen pageant which was held from 1926 to 1966 during Victoria Day celebrations in May. The school children voted who should be named as Britannia Beach&#x27;s Copper Queen and with each new Queen came a different variation of the crown she was presented, making each year unique to their own. Being Copper Queen had some responsibilities too as they had to attend local events and holiday festivities during their reign. Although Britannia Beach was essentially remote until the 1950s, there were plenty of recreational activities for everyone. In an interview with the Vancouver Sun, former resident Frances McKilligan stated that &quot;Sports clubs, amateur theatre, hobby clubs and annual community celebrations took place throughout the year. Dances, parties, movies and picnics were held and there were ample areas for hiking, swimming and fishing with the beautiful Howe Sound as a backdrop.&quot;

==In the media==
The 2010 episode of the US TV show Psych, Dual Spires, was filmed almost entirely in Britannia Beach. In 2017, many scenes for The Crossing (TV series) were filmed in and around the village. In the same year, scenes for Travelers (TV series) were also shot in Britannia Beach. Parts of the second season of the HBO show The Last of Us were filmed in Brittania Beach.

<doc id="428761" wikidata="Q57952" url="?curid=428761" title="Manfred Rommel">
<text>Manfred Rommel (24 December 1928 – 7 November 2013) was a German politician belonging to the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), who served as mayor of Stuttgart from 1974 until 1996. Rommel&#x27;s policies were described as tolerant and liberal, and he was one of the most popular municipal politicians in Germany. He was the recipient of numerous foreign honours. He was the only son of Wehrmacht Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and his wife Lucia Maria Mollin (1894–1971), and contributed to the establishment of museums in his father&#x27;s honour. He was also known for his friendship with George Patton IV and David Montgomery, the sons of his father&#x27;s two principal military adversaries.

== Background and family ==
Rommel was born in Stuttgart and entered service as a Luftwaffenhelfer (air force assistant) in 1943 at age 14, serving in an anti-aircraft battery. He considered joining the Waffen SS, but his father opposed it. On 14 October 1944, he was present at his parents&#x27; house when his father was led off to be forced to commit suicide for his alleged complicity in the 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, which was publicly portrayed by the Nazi leadership as a death resulting from a war injury. In February 1945, Rommel was dismissed from air force service and in March was conscripted into the paramilitary Reichsarbeitsdienst service. Stationed in Riedlingen at the end of April, he deserted just before the French First Army entered the town. He was taken prisoner of war, was interrogated by (among others) general Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, and disclosed the truth about his father&#x27;s death.

== Post-war life and career ==
In 1947, he took his Abitur while studying in Biberach an der Riß and went on to study law at the University of Tübingen. He married Liselotte in 1954 and had a daughter named Catherine. After a stint working as a lawyer, in 1956, Rommel entered the civil service and later became state secretary in the state government of Baden-Württemberg.

In 1974, Rommel succeeded Arnulf Klett as Oberbürgermeister (equivalent to Mayor) of Stuttgart by winning 58.5% of the votes in the second round of elections, defeating Peter Conradi of the Social Democratic Party. He was re-elected after the first round of elections in 1982 with 69.8% and in 1990 with 71.7% of the votes. As the mayor of Stuttgart, he was also known for his effort to give the Red Army Faction terrorists who had committed suicide at the Stuttgart-Stammheim prison a proper burial, despite the concern that the graves would become a pilgrimage point for radical leftists. In defending his decision against criticism from within his own party, Rommel said: &quot;All enmity must end at some point and I think in this case it ends with [their] death.&quot;

While Oberbürgermeister of Stuttgart, Rommel began a much-publicised friendship with U.S. Army Major General George Patton IV, the son of his father&#x27;s World War II adversary, General George S. Patton, who was assigned to the VII Corps headquarters near the city. Additionally, he was also friends with David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, the son of his father&#x27;s other great adversary, Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, a friendship viewed by some as a symbol of Anglo-German reconciliation following the War and West Germany&#x27;s admission into NATO.

In a 1996 celebration at the Württemberg State Theatre, Manfred Rommel received the highest German civil distinction, the Bundesverdienstkreuz. In his speech, Helmut Kohl put particular emphasis on the good relations that were kept and built upon between France and Germany during Rommel&#x27;s tenure as Oberbürgermeister of Stuttgart. A few days after this distinction was given to Rommel, the city of Stuttgart offered him the Honorary Citizen Award. He risked his popularity when he stood out for the fair treatment of foreign immigrants, who were being drawn to Stuttgart by its booming economy. As mayor, Rommel also exerted &quot;tight control over the city&#x27;s finances, reducing its debt and enabling a radical makeover of the local infrastructure, especially roads and public transport [while working]...to foster Franco-German relations.&quot;

Rommel&#x27;s political position was described as tolerant and liberal.

== Outside politics ==
Having retired from politics in 1996, Rommel was still in demand as an author and stirring speaker, despite suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He wrote various political and humorous books. He was known for his down-to-earth and often funny sayings and quotations. Occasionally, he wrote articles for the &quot;Stuttgarter Zeitung&quot;.

Rommel collaborated with Basil Liddell-Hart in the publication of &quot;The Rommel Papers&quot;, a collection of diaries, letters and notes that his father wrote during and after his military campaigns. He was awarded several foreign awards including the Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), the French Légion d&#x27;honneur, the US Medal of Freedom and the highest grade of the German federal order of merit. He died on 7 November 2013, survived by his wife Lieselotte and his daughter Catherine.

== Movies ==
In the following movies about his father during the Second World War, Manfred Rommel was played by the following actors:
* 1951: &quot;The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel&quot; (German: Rommel, der Wüstenfuchs) (Director: Henry Hathaway), William Reynolds as Manfred Rommel
* 1962: &quot;The Longest Day&quot; (German: der längste Tag) (Director(s): Annakin/Marton/Wicki/Oswald/Zanuck), Michael Hinz as Manfred Rommel. Hinz&#x27;s father Werner Hinz played Field Marshal Rommel in the film
* 1989: &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (TV-Series), Matthias Hinze as Manfred Rommel
* 2012: &quot;Rommel&quot; (Director: Niki Stein), Patrick Mölleken as Manfred Rommel

Additionally, interviews with Manfred concerning his father are featured in the 2021 documentary Rommel: The Soldier, The Son, and Hitler narrated by Greg Kinnear.

== Honours ==
Manfred Rommel once wrote about his many honours: &quot;Die Zahl der Titel will nicht enden. Am Grabstein stehet: bitte wenden!&quot; which translates as: &quot;The number of honours seems to be endless. The inscription on my gravestone will read: Please turn over!&quot;

<text>Peter John Ucko FRAI FSA (27 July 1938 – 14 June 2007) was an influential English archaeologist. He served as Director of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London (UCL), and was a Fellow of both the Royal Anthropological Institute and the Society of Antiquaries. A controversial and divisive figure within archaeology, his life&#x27;s work focused on eroding western dominance by broadening archaeological participation to developing countries and indigenous communities.

Born in London to middle class German Jewish parents, Ucko attained his BA and PhD in the anthropology department of UCL, where he proceeded to work from 1962 to 1972, also publishing a number of significant books on archaeology. From 1972 to 1981 he worked as Principal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies in Canberra, Australia, instituting measures to increase the participation of Indigenous Australian communities in their heritage. Returning to England in 1981 to teach archaeology at the University of Southampton, he became national secretary of the International Union of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences (IUPPS) and was responsible for organising their eleventh congress in 1986; disagreements over whether to abide by the academic boycott of South Africa resulted in Ucko denouncing the IUPPS and founding the World Archaeological Congress (WAC), which focused on recognising current socio-political dimensions to archaeology.

In 1996 he was controversially appointed director of the UCL Institute of Archaeology, overseeing largescale expansion to create the world&#x27;s largest archaeology department. Also teaching there, he initiated reforms to the syllabus and forged links with the archaeological community in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, co-founding the International Centre for Chinese Heritage and Archaeology. Retiring in 2005, he continued developing connections between the UK and China until his death from diabetes.

==Life==

===Early life: 1938–1972===
Peter Ucko was born in Buckinghamshire on 27 July 1938 to German Jewish parents. His father was a professor of endocrinology who took a great interest in music, conducting orchestras and organising operas, while his mother was a child psychologist. He formed an &#x27;unwavering obsession&#x27; with Egyptology at the age of eleven. He was sent to boarding school at Bryanston in Dorset, which he despised and left after displeasing the school authorities by refusing to play in a tennis doubles match with a local girls&#x27; school.

Studying for a year at North West London Polytechnic, he completed his A-levels and met a number of students from developing countries, developing his staunch anti-racist views. From 1956 to 1959, he studied for an undergraduate degree in anthropology from University College London (UCL), opting for courses that focused on archaeology. Remaining at UCL, in the Institute of Archaeology, he proceeded to study for a PhD in the anthropomorphic figurines of the ancient Near East, under the supervision of John Evans, completing it in 1962. Having placed a particular emphasis on Ancient Egypt, he came to be seen as an Egyptologist.

Ucko worked in the UCL Department of Anthropology for the next decade, founding the School of Material Culture Studies. He organised two academic conferences there, which subsequently led to two edited volumes: &quot;The Domestication of Plants and Animals&quot; and &quot;Man, Settlement and Urbanism&quot;, both of which became &quot;standard texts.&quot; In 1967 he published &quot;Palaeolithic Cave Art&quot;, a book co-written with his girlfriend Andrée Rosenfeld, while the following year he published his doctoral research as a monograph titled &quot;Anthropomorphic Figurines of Predynastic Egypt and Neolithic Crete&quot;, which critiqued the claims regarding mother goddesses that had been popularised by Marija Gimbutas.

===World archaeology: 1972–1996===
In 1972, he was appointed Principal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies in Canberra, Australia, negatively characterising it as an institution where white people were paid by white people to study black people. Overseeing a rapid expansion, he sought to involve Indigenous Australians in the project, hiring them in the council and its committees and launching a project known as &quot;Before It Is Too Late&quot; to preserve indigenous culture and language. He left in 1980, largely because of his dislike of fundraising, which was a major part of his role, insisting that his position be taken up by an Indigenous individual. Ucko was succeeded in the position by Eric Willmot, an eminent indigenous academic and engineer hailing from Cribb Island, Queensland.

In May 1981, following a spell of consultancy work for the Zimbabwean government, he was appointed Professor of Archaeology at the University of Southampton in England; he took up the position, left vacant by Colin Renfrew, in January 1982. Pioneering new teaching methods, from 1993 to 1996 he was appointed Dean of Arts at Southampton, allowing him greater space to institute reform.

Becoming national secretary of the International Union of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences (UISPP), Ucko was charged with organising the organisation&#x27;s eleventh congress, which was due to take place at Southampton University in 1986. Beginning preparations in 1984, he decided to abide by the international academic boycott of South Africa and Namibia, which had been implemented to protest the apartheid system in those countries; this meant that South African and Namibian delegates would be prevented from attending the congress. The decision caused controversy in the international archaeological community and raised questions of academic freedom. Senior figures in the UISPP argued that the congress must be open to all archaeologists &quot;with no distinction of race, country or political persuasion&quot;, a position supported by the Society for American Archaeology. After UISPP disavowed the conference, Ucko continued to stage it under a new banner as the World Archaeological Congress (WAC), thus developing a new international organisation committed to &quot;the explicit recognition of the historical and social role, and the political context, of archaeological enquiry&quot;.

===Directorship of the UCL Institute of Archaeology: 1996–2005===

In 1996 he was appointed Director of the UCL Institute of Archaeology in central London, also taking on the role of Professor of Comparative Archaeology. His appointment to the former was not universally popular. His later successor as director, Stephen Shennan, would comment that Ucko went about his job &quot;with characteristic forcefulness, making new appointments, overturning existing structures and overhauling the syllabus at all levels.&quot; Ucko immediately implemented changes to the manner in which undergraduate courses were taught, based on his experiences at Southampton. Bringing in compulsory core courses for second and third years on such subjects as archaeological theory and public archaeology, he focused on generalisation at the undergraduate level, reserving specialisation for those students who went on to study at a master&#x27;s degree level, expanding the number of master&#x27;s degrees on offer.

Taking a particular interest in the fields of public archaeology and cultural heritage studies, he appointed new staff members to teach courses in such topics, and was involved in founding the &quot;Public Archaeology&quot; journal, initially edited by honorary lecturer Neal Ascherson. Keen on increasing the IoA&#x27;s publishing output, he oversaw the creation of &quot;Archaeology International&quot;, a journal that first appeared in 1998, combining the roles of the former &quot;Bulletin of the Institute of Archaeology&quot; and the &quot;Annual Report&quot;, edited by David R. Harris. After Cavendish Press, publishers of the UCL Press imprint, were bought out by Taylor and Francis, Ucko initiated successful talks with Left Coast Press for the IoA to publish future works through them. He also emphasised the importance of the artefact collections owned by UCL and IoA, believing that they had great potential as teaching aids and for public outreach.

Having developed a keen interest in Chinese archaeology, he helped to forge greater links with archaeological departments in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and in conjunction with the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) created two joint teaching positions in Chinese archaeology. In co-operation with the School of Archaeology and Museology at Peking University, he helped UCL found the International Centre for Chinese Heritage and Archaeology (ICCHA), an institution devoted to promoting the exchange of archaeologists between Europe and China. Appointed director of ICCHA, it soon yielded several collaborative projects in training and research, and resulted in a number of scholarships for Chinese students to be trained in archaeology at UCL.
Ucko retired from the position of director in 2005, at which time the UCL-IoA had become the world&#x27;s largest archaeology department, with over 70 academic staff and 600 students from 40 countries.

===Retirement: 2005–2007===
Following his retirement, Ucko focused his attention on continuing dialogue between archaeological communities in the UK and PRC. In 2006 he travelled to ten Chinese cities with colleague Wang Tao, interviewing academic archaeologists about how they taught the subject; he planned to produce a book on this topic, but had not done so by the time of his death. A festschrift titled &quot;A Future for Archaeology&quot;, edited by Robert Layton, Stephen Shennan and Peter Stone, was produced in Ucko&#x27;s honour in 2006. Ucko had chronic diabetes, a condition that contributed to his death on 14 June 2007.

==Personal life==
His obituary for &quot;The Telegraph&quot; described Ucko as a &quot;combative, nervy man&quot; who had a tendency to become aggressive under pressure and who viewed the world &quot;in terms of friends and enemies&quot;. It furthermore noted that he was &quot;genial and unpretentious&quot; in the company of others, who often developed &quot;strong affection&quot; for him.
Shennan opined that Ucko was a charismatic and dedicated figure who led by example, remarking that his actions inspired many archaeologists, including those who had fallen out with him. Shennan also considered him to have been extremely generous, exhibiting a &quot;massive fund of human warmth.&quot;

His partner of 27 years was Jane Hubert, who supported him both emotionally and physically, sacrificing her own professional and personal interests to do so.

==The Peter Ucko Archaeological Trust==
The Peter Ucko Archaeological Trust was established in 2007, and focuses particularly on providing financial assistance for indigenous and economically disadvantaged people to gain education and training in archaeology, heritage management and associated disciplines, and supports activities that address inequalities and cultural conflict in the areas of archaeological heritage and cultural property. The Trust is administered by the UCL Institute of Archaeology.

==The Ucko Collection==
The Ucko Collection consists of archaeological objects originally collected by Peter Ucko. On his death, ownership passed to his partner Jane Hubert, who later approached members of the Institute of Archaeology&#x27;s staff with a desire to donate the collection to a public institution, an act which inspired the &quot;Transitional Objects&quot; project (UCL, 2014–2016).

<doc id="428770" wikidata="Q641980" url="?curid=428770" title="Roosevelt Island Tramway">
<text>The Roosevelt Island Tramway is an aerial tramway that crosses the East River in New York City, connecting Roosevelt Island to the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The tramway is the first commuter aerial tramway in the U.S., having opened on May 17, 1976, to serve residential developments on Roosevelt Island. The tram is operated by Leitner-Poma on behalf of the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation of the State of New York.

Before the tramway opened, Roosevelt Island had been accessed via the Roosevelt Island Bridge from Queens, which had opened in 1955. Starting in the late 1960s, the 63rd Street subway line was built to connect new developments on the island to Manhattan. Due to delays in the subway&#x27;s construction, the tramway was proposed in 1971 and approved in 1973, initially as a temporary mode of transport. The tramway carried 1.25 million riders in its first year and remained popular thereafter, despite intermittent closures. Ridership declined sharply after the subway opened in 1989, though the tramway remained in operation. Following two major breakdowns in the mid-2000s, the tramway was rebuilt from March to November 2010. The stations were renovated in the late 2010s.

Originally, the tram used two 125-person cabins that were hauled by the same cable. After the 2010 renovation, the cabins were replaced with 110-person vehicles that could operate independently. The cabins travel between an at-grade terminal on Roosevelt Island and an elevated terminal on Manhattan Island. The route operates at all times except late nights, with headways of 7.5 to 15 minutes. The tramway uses the same fare structure as the city&#x27;s bus and subway systems, and fares are paid with either MetroCard or OMNY. Over the years, the Roosevelt Island Tramway has been the subject of commentary and praised as an icon of New York City, and it has been depicted in several works of media.

== History ==

=== Background ===
What is now Roosevelt Island was, until the mid-20th century, known as Blackwell&#x27;s Island or Welfare Island; it was largely occupied by hospitals and asylums. The Queensboro Bridge, which connected the island with Queens and Manhattan, opened in 1909. A trolley (streetcar) line ran across the bridge when it opened, stopping in the middle of the bridge at an elevator that took passengers down to the island. The trolley remained in service until April 7, 1957, as the last trolley line in New York state; a bridge to Queens had been completed two years earlier.

After the state government leased Welfare Island from the city in 1969, several large housing developments were built there in the early 1970s, necessitating the construction of a public transit connection. Welfare Island was renamed Roosevelt Island in 1973, and residents began moving onto the island in mid-1975. The Roosevelt Island subway station on the 63rd Street Line was being developed to serve the new community, but the entire line was delayed significantly by the mid-1970s. The first residents of Roosevelt Island had to travel through Queens to leave the island, making it difficult to travel to and from Manhattan via car.

=== Development ===

==== Planning ====
Because of the delays in building the subway line, an alternative mode of transportation between Manhattan and Roosevelt Island had to be devised. At a meeting of Manhattan Community Board 8 in September 1971, the Welfare Island Development Corporation proposed an aerial tramway, which the board narrowly approved the next month. The tram was to run between the Motorgate parking garage on Welfare Island and 72nd Street on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, with two 120-passenger cabins that ascended above the East River. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; wrote that the tramway &quot;ought to be the classiest transportation buy in New York City&quot;. Although the 72nd Street location had been selected because it was far from the subway, wealthy Manhattan residents objected to the tramway&#x27;s terminal being placed there.

The Urban Development Corporation (UDC), a New York state agency, had studied the feasibility of a ferry, a bus, and an aerial tramway by 1972. Ferry routes to 34th, 63rd, and 71st Streets were studied but were ruled out due to high operating costs, lack of mass-transit connections, and lack of union support. Other alternatives under consideration included an elevator extending directly from the Queensboro Bridge. UDC architect William Chafee proposed an aerial tramway, which was ultimately selected because it was cheap, direct, and fit into Roosevelt Island&#x27;s quiet character. By early 1973, the UDC was finalizing plans for a tramway, which was to be the first commuter aerial tramway in the U.S. The tramway was to be the main means of travel between Roosevelt Island and Manhattan, and it was intended as a temporary mode of transit until the subway was completed. The plans called for two 125-passenger cabins that would travel across the East River&#x27;s western channel, just south of the Queensboro Bridge. Officials hoped the tramway would help the UDC&#x27;s sales campaigns for the island.

Residents of Sutton Place, a street facing the East River in Manhattan, opposed the tramway plan because they felt the tramway would cause urban blight. The United States Coast Guard also needed to approve the project because it crossed a navigable waterway. In September 1973, the route was changed to the north side of the Queensboro Bridge after property owners protested; UDC president Ed Logue said that &quot;no prominent people lived&quot; near the bridge&#x27;s north side. The next month, the New York City Board of Estimate approved the aerial tramway. The state government was given a franchise for the tramway in December 1973, allowing construction to begin.

==== Construction ====
Swiss firm Von Roll was selected to supply and erect the tram and its equipment, in part because, according to the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, Von Roll made the &quot;Cadillac of tramways&quot;. VSL, a subsidiary of Von Roll, installed the equipment. The United States Army Corps of Engineers solicited public comments on the tramway plan in January 1974. The footpath on the Queensboro Bridge was shuttered that July in preparation for the tramway&#x27;s opening, and a pair of lampposts at the Manhattan end of the Queensboro Bridge were removed to make way for the tramway. On the Roosevelt Island side, work was delayed because of the need to relocate the island&#x27;s municipal laundry building.

Work on the route began the first week of October 1974. Construction, initially scheduled to be completed by around September 1975, was delayed due to the UDC&#x27;s financial issues. An interim commuter bus to Manhattan via Queens was launched in March 1975; the bus route took up to an hour to reach Manhattan, whereas the tramway was expected to take five minutes. The tramway&#x27;s engineer, David Ozerkis, predicted the next month that construction would be complete within the year. By that April, two of three tramway towers were finished.

The towers for the tram route were erected by July 1975, when completion was projected for that December. The first cables for the tramway were installed the next month. Construction was delayed various times, in part due to strikes and inclement weather. The delays prompted numerous unfounded rumors about the route, including conjecture that the cabins were involved in collisions or were being secretly run at night. During an initial test of the route in February 1976, a tram hit a light pole, forcing the removal of the pole. By March of that year, the route was complete, and it only needed additional testing and state government approval before it could open to the public. The tramway had cost $6.25 million or $6.8 million to build (equivalent to $– million in ) It was funded by bonds that had been issued to fund the development of Roosevelt Island. The equipment and vehicles had cost at least $2 million (equivalent to $ million in ), while the support towers and stations cost another $4.25 million (equivalent to $ million in ).

=== Opening and early operations ===

==== 1970s ====
The tramway route opened on May 17, 1976. As built, there was one elevator at the Manhattan terminal; the Roosevelt Island terminal was at ground level. The first staff members included an unemployed firefighter who, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said that his knowledge of &quot;rescue procedures&quot; had gotten him the job. The city&#x27;s franchise to the UDC mandated that the tram&#x27;s fare be at least 25 cents more expensive than the subway&#x27;s fare, preventing the tram from drawing away subway riders. The route was free on its opening day, but rides were 50 cents () thereafter. Following Roosevelt Island residents&#x27; complaints, the UDC stopped selling fares in Manhattan, gave &quot;priority passes&quot; to Roosevelt Island residents, limited the capacity of each tram, and prohibited several activities onboard. Bicycles were allowed in the cabins, but the UDC gave priority to passengers.

Paul Goldberger of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Roosevelt Island&#x27;s popularity rose significantly after the tramway opened, while a writer for the Gannett News Service said the tramway had become both a tourist attraction in itself and an icon of the island. After the UDC fired the original operator, ITT Inc., it hired VSL International to run the tram in January 1977; there was no bidding process before VSL received the contract. VSL&#x27;s staff of 20 tram operators (who also worked as station attendants), six mechanics, and four console operators worked three shifts of eight hours each. The UDC received a $2 million annual subsidy from the state government (equivalent to $ million in ) for the tramway and other projects on Roosevelt Island.

In 1977—its first full year of operation—the tramway recorded an $800,000 deficit (). The tramway&#x27;s liability insurance policy cost $900,000 per year (), almost equal to its revenue from fares; such an expensive insurance cost was necessitated by the fact that there were no other aerial commuter tramways in the U.S. In addition, operating expenses amounted to $1 million a year (equivalent to $ million in ), and the state government was essentially paying a 95-cent subsidy for every rider. Despite the lack of any major accidents, the tramway continued to have high insurance costs in 1978. This prompted governor Hugh Carey to ask his aides to study the feasibility of having the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) take over the line. The tramway was shuttered in mid-November 1978 so workers could replace the haul cable, which was beyond the end of its service life. The cable replacement project cost $75,000 and took two weeks. Afterward, the tramway had to be closed every two years so workers could replace the haul cable.

==== 1980s ====
A plaza around the tram&#x27;s Manhattan terminal was established in 1980. After the tram was closed in November 1980 for haul cable replacement, the new cable fell twice in one month, prompting investigations by the state government. The months-long closure caused overcrowding on Queens bus routes and did not end until March 1981. The extended closure of the tramway had also prompted proposals for a year-round ferry to Roosevelt Island, but interest in the ferry disappeared after the tram reopened. Further haul-cable replacements occurred in November 1983 and August 1985. Although both cabins were originally red, one of the cabins was repainted blue in 1984, prompting complaints from some residents. State officials warned in late 1985 that tram passengers could have to wait as long as 45 minutes if the subway line to Roosevelt Island were not completed within three years. The Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation (RIOC), a state agency created in 1984 to manage Roosevelt Island, took over the tram service when it was created.

The tramway&#x27;s insurance cost $677,000 a year () when the liability insurance policy expired in early 1986; at the time, the tram served 150,000 people a month. After the insurance expired, the New York State Senate failed to pass a bill that allowed the state to self-insure the tramway; the New York State Assembly, the state&#x27;s other legislative body, had already approved the bill. This was in part due to objections from upstate politicians who wanted liability insurance for their communities as well. The route stopped running in February 1986. After the State Senate initially rejected the self-insurance bill again, it ultimately allowed the state government to pay $8 million a year in insurance (equivalent to $ million in ), and the route reopened after two weeks. The State Senate failed to pass a separate bill that would formalize the state government&#x27;s involvement in paying insurance. By mid-1986, the tramway was operating at full capacity. The tramway closed for a week in August 1986 due to an electrical issue, and the blue cabin was repainted red.

In mid-1989, mayor Ed Koch indicated that the tram might be closed after the subway opened. One local resident stated at the time: &quot;For many Islanders, this could be a day that will live in infamy: When the subway finally comes, the cherished tram may go.&quot; The line was again temporarily closed that July, after nine riders were injured when a cabin crashed into the Manhattan terminal. Under an agreement with the city government, fares on the tramway were raised by 25 cents after the 63rd Street subway opened in October 1989. RIOC estimated that the tram would lose $1 million in a year (equivalent to $ million in ) because of competition from the subway. When the subway opened, RIOC fired staff members and installed token machines in an effort to cut costs. &quot;New York&quot; magazine wrote that some residents opposed the tramway&#x27;s closure because it provided a wheelchair-accessible connection to more bus routes in Manhattan than the subway did. Two thousand people signed a petition in support of saving the tramway, and RIOC said it had no plans to close the tram.

==== 1990s ====
Following decreases in rush-hour ridership of up to 45 percent, New York City Council member Robert Dryfoos sponsored legislation in April 1990 that would allow the city and state to continue operating the tram. Dryfoos&#x27;s bill called for the city to stop charging the tramway a $136,000 annual franchise fee (); remove a requirement that a tram ride be more expensive than a subway ride; and allow students to ride the tram for free. The Board of Estimate agreed to provide discounted senior fares and free student fares; while the Office of Management and Budget agreed to fund the senior fares, the Department of Education would not pay for the student fares. RIOC also wanted the city government to attract tourists to the tram. In late 1990, NYNEX received permission to build a phone substation and an observation deck directly beneath the tramway, next to one of the support towers. Ultimately, the tramway remained as a permanent transit link. The tram was closed in October 1993 due to electrical issues and was repaired over the next three months. It reopened in February 1994 but closed again that July for a $2.1 million renovation (equivalent to $ million in ).

During the 1990s, RIOC promoted various programs and events to increase its revenue and the tramway&#x27;s ridership. To promote museums in Long Island City and Astoria, Queens, RIOC started selling &quot;Tram Artlink&quot; passes in 1994, which included tram tickets, connecting bus service, and museum admission. By 1995, further financial troubles forced RIOC to propose reducing service by four hours on weekdays and five hours on weekends. RIOC&#x27;s agreement with the city government expired in 1995. Governor George Pataki announced in early 1996 that he wanted to eliminate all subsidies for RIOC, including subsidies for the tramway; at the time, the tram was operating at a $1 million annual loss (equivalent to $ million in ). Despite protests from residents, the state stopped subsidizing the tramway the same year. With the elimination of the state subsidy, Roosevelt Island residents feared that the tram could not be repaired in an emergency, since many parts for the tram were manufactured in Switzerland and imported at a high cost. Residents also expressed concerns over decreases in service.

The tramway was again temporarily shuttered in January 1998 when a crane hit a cabin and injured 11 passengers; after the damaged cabin was repaired, the tramway reopened one week later. The tram was still losing $700,000 a year (), and twice as many people used the Roosevelt Island subway station as the tramway. Roosevelt Island&#x27;s chief operating officer, Jerome Blue, wanted to reduce operating hours to save money, but many of the island&#x27;s residents objected. In particular, disabled and senior residents preferred using the tram over the subway. The elevators to the subway station were often out of service, and the island&#x27;s wheelchair-accessible buses traveled only to Queens. Blue also wanted to eliminate free fares for students, but this was unsuccessful, as was his attempt to cut back operating hours. By the late 1990s, tramway riders were advocating for free transfers to the bus and subway systems; at the time, riders had to pay another fare if they wanted to transfer.

=== 21st century ===
==== 2000s: Increasing unreliability ====
By 2001, there were plans to halt all service from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. due to low ridership. Each nighttime trip effectively received a $6.45 subsidy from the RIOC (equivalent to $ in ), more than double the subsidy for each daytime trip, and the line was losing $1.7 million annually (equivalent to $ million in ). The tramway was temporarily closed for cable replacement in November 2001. Although the closure was supposed to last one month, the tramway did not reopen until March 2002 because the original replacement cable was too short. During the closure, the cabins were also restored. The RIOC&#x27;s chief operating officer Robert Ryan proposed running advertisements on the tram cabins in mid-2002 to reduce the line&#x27;s operating deficit, though New York City Council speaker Gifford Miller said such advertisements were illegal. Ultimately, RIOC ran advertisements on the cabins despite not having received permission from the city.

The subway stopped accepting tokens as fare payment in May 2003, followed by the city&#x27;s bus system that December, but the Roosevelt Island Tramway continued to use tokens exclusively. RIOC bought 7,000 tokens from the MTA so passengers could continue to pay fares. RIOC announced in January 2004 that the tramway&#x27;s turnstiles would begin accepting MetroCards. The tramway switched to using MetroCards on March 1, 2004, allowing tram passengers to transfer to the subway or bus for free.

On September 2, 2005, more than 80 people were trapped on the tram for over 90 minutes, and an engineer had to be transported from his suburban home via helicopter to turn on a backup generator. After that incident, state inspectors issued two violations against the tramway and ordered RIOC to install a diesel backup or motor-generator system. On April 18, 2006, at about 5:22 p.m. EDT, the two trams stalled over the East River, trapping 69 people for up to eleven hours; they had to be rescued using a crane, as well as via a cage that traveled from one terminal to the stranded cabin. Both the primary and secondary power systems were not operational, and the backup system was in California for repairs. The tramway was closed indefinitely, and the cabins stalled twice more the same month while RIOC officials test-ran the tramway to ascertain the cause of the breakdown. In the meantime, RIOC spent $500,000 upgrading the power systems. By May 2006, the primary electrical system had been replaced, and officials wanted to reopen the tramway within three months. The tram&#x27;s backup electrical systems were refurbished, and each cabin was equipped with emergency supplies.

The tramway resumed operations on September 1, 2006. Following the breakdown, officials announced that they would spend $15 million (equivalent to $ million in ) on a major overhaul of the tramway in two or three years. The Manhattan terminal&#x27;s plaza was renovated in 2007. By mid-2008, the renovation had increased to $25 million (equivalent to $ million in ) and was to begin the following year. Local residents were concerned about the closure because the tram was one of three ways off the island, along with the subway and the Roosevelt Island Bridge.

==== 2010s to present ====

On March 1, 2010, the tramway was closed for what was supposed to be a six-month renovation. French company Poma was hired for the project, which included replacing all components except for the three tower bases. The improvements included a new &quot;dual haul&quot; system that allowed the cabins to travel independently of each other; previously, the cabins had to be run simultaneously. The old cabins were to be preserved on Roosevelt Island, in a museum, or both. Work was delayed because of challenges in bringing a large crane to the island. The cabins were attached to the cables in October 2010, and test runs began in mid-November. The tramway reopened November 30, 2010, two months later than originally planned. The late opening was also attributed to delays in obtaining permits for construction, as well as inclement weather.

In the early 2010s, the Cornell Tech educational campus was planned on Roosevelt Island, and there were concerns that the tram and subway could not carry additional persons heading there. In 2016, engineering company GC Eng &amp; Associates was hired to renovate the Manhattan terminal. Repairs to both terminals&#x27; platforms began in July 2017, during which one cabin was taken out of service at all times. Headways were increased to 15 minutes, which created severe overcrowding during rush hours. One of the cabins&#x27; gearboxes was also rebuilt in 2018. The platform reconstruction project was finished in February 2019, at which point RIOC was in the process of installing two elevators at the Manhattan terminal to replace the original elevator.

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City in 2020, ridership decreased significantly, and each cabin was limited to 24 percent its normal capacity. The elevators at the Manhattan terminal were completed in April 2022 for $7 million. This work also included an expansion of the Manhattan terminal&#x27;s platform and renovations to the plaza underneath it. Installation of OMNY fare-payment readers on the Roosevelt Island Tramway was underway by mid-2023. On August 24, 2023, the Roosevelt Island Tramway started to accept OMNY fare payments. The launch of OMNY coincided with a long-term partial closure of the 63rd Street Line. The subway line&#x27;s closure created more overcrowding during late 2023. By 2024, there were calls to give priority boarding to Roosevelt Island residents and employees due to increasing crowding. At the time, RIOC refused to implement a priority-boarding system, saying it violated a state law against giving &quot;undue or unreasonable preference&quot; to any group of riders.

== Description ==
, the tramway is operated by Leitner-Poma under contract to the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation. David I. Ozerkis, chief engineer of Roosevelt Island in the 1970s, designed the Roosevelt Island Tramway. Von Roll manufactured the tram and its equipment, and subsidiary VSL installed the equipment. In addition, Lev Zetlin of Lev Zetlin &amp; Associates was the engineer for the Roosevelt Island Tramway, and Prentice &amp; Chan and Ohlhausen were responsible for the route&#x27;s two stations.

=== Route and stations ===

The Roosevelt Island Tramway runs immediately to the north of, and parallel to, the Queensboro Bridge. This was a deliberate measure intended to prevent planes at low altitude from colliding with the tramway, as the bridge is much larger than the tramway. Although RIOC gives the tramway&#x27;s total length as , other publications give slightly differing lengths, such as &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, which in a 1976 article cited the tramway as measuring long. The tramway travels over the East River&#x27;s western channel. The stretch over Roosevelt Island is nearly long, while the stretch over Manhattan is more than long.

==== Manhattan terminal ====
The Manhattan terminal is accessed through Tramway Plaza, on the west side of Second Avenue between 59th and 60th Streets. MTA Regional Bus Operations&#x27; , and buses stop near the terminal, while the New York City Subway&#x27;s Lexington Avenue/59th Street station, served by the , is one block west.

The terminal is six stories high. To avoid interfering with vehicular traffic, the Manhattan terminal is elevated; the platform is high. The station has two elevators, and there is also a set of stairs. Above the terminal is a concrete deck that could support a 32-story or 35-story building above, although such a building was never built. This deck is supported by four steel-and-concrete columns measuring thick and tall. The eastern side of the terminal is cantilevered above the sidewalk of Second Avenue, providing space for an unexecuted widening of the avenue. The terminal&#x27;s western side is also cantilevered and was intended to accommodate an unbuilt bus stop.

==== Roosevelt Island terminal ====
The terminal on Roosevelt Island is located at 300 Main Street and abuts the Southtown section of the island. At the Roosevelt Island terminal, there is a transfer to the Red Bus route, which offers transportation around the island for free. The MTA&#x27;s Q102 bus and the subway&#x27;s Roosevelt Island station (serving the ) are also near the Roosevelt Island terminal.

The Roosevelt Island terminal is at ground level. This terminal is clad in metal and is supported by a steel superstructure. The sides of the terminal were also fitted with windows, which permitted views of machinery inside the station. Within the Roosevelt Island terminal is a shear wall that conceals the anchorages for the tramway&#x27;s cables.

=== Cabins ===

==== Original cabins (1976–2010) ====
The original tram cabins measured . Each of the old cabins weighed when empty. The vehicles could travel at and could fit 125 people (including one attendant), for a total capacity of 1,800 people an hour. The original cabins were mostly standing-room only except for a few benches on the sides. The cabins had overhead leather straps, which were refurbished in the 1990s and removed in 2010; at the time, they were the only vehicles in New York City&#x27;s transit system that used straps. The bottom sections of the exteriors were composed of bulky red metal panels, while the top sections had sliding windows, which wrapped around the vehicle. The roof of each cabin had an emergency escape hatch, a vent, and an asymmetrical A-shaped arm that ran along a set of track ropes.

Telephones in each cabin allowed operators to communicate with staff at either terminal. Each cabin also had three separate braking systems, as well as small consoles that allowed the attendants to semi-automatically control the cabins. There were rescue hatches on the floor of each cabin, which could be used to extricate riders if the tramway broke down over land. The old cabins were stored in the Motorgate parking garage after the 2010 renovation.

==== Current cabins (2010–present) ====
Each of the new cabins weighs when empty. The vehicles move at about and have a capacity of 110 (including one attendant). The cabins are standing-room only, except for two benches on the sides, and contain metal grab bars. The exteriors of each vehicle have larger windows than the original cabins did. The roof of each cabin has a set of two arms, which are suspended from a pair of cables; this allows the cars to maintain stability in windy weather. The cabins are also powered by their own electric engines. The vehicles&#x27; doors are automatically operated, and there are digital screens inside. The cabins are also equipped with wireless communications systems. As a safety measure, when a cabin loses contact with the route&#x27;s terminals, its braking systems stop it suddenly, which has sometimes caused the cabin to sway in midair.

==== Rescue cages ====
If the cabins were to break down over water, riders can be brought to safety via a rescue cage. There are two rescue cages, each with a capacity of 14 passengers. The rescue cages have their own drive systems and can also be operated using a battery-powered console. During a breakdown, the cages can be attached to a set of rescue ropes on the tramway; the cages could then be brought up to the passengers, who can be evacuated through the windows of the cabins.

=== Structures and cabling ===

Originally, the cabins were suspended from their own pair of closely-spaced track ropes, and they were moved using a single haul cable. The haul cable was cited as measuring thick, while the track cables were cited as measuring thick. The haul cable was laid in a continuous loop, moving the two cabins in opposite directions at the same time. As such, both cabins had to depart and arrive at the station at the same time; the cabins also operated during off-peak hours even if there was a lack of demand, and the entire route had to be taken out of service if one cabin broke down. The track ropes were attached to anchors at the Roosevelt Island terminal and tension weights at the Manhattan terminal. The anchors at the Roosevelt Island terminal were counterweights that descended into the ground.

Following the 2010 renovation, the Roosevelt Island Tramway was rebuilt as a dual haul system, allowing the cabins to be operated separately from each other. Each cabin is suspended from its own set of cables, which has a gauge of . The cables can carry loads of up to , more than three times the weight of a fully loaded cabin. A third haul cable is used to pull each of the cabins.

Three support towers carry the cables. The original plans called for the cables to be supported on two towers along the south side of the Queensboro Bridge. The towers were moved to the north side of the bridge before construction began, and another tower was added. As built, the westernmost tower is between First and Second Avenues in Manhattan, the central tower is at York Avenue in Manhattan, and the easternmost tower is on Roosevelt Island. The towers are composed of steel posts that are welded together, and their foundations extend deep. The tallest tower, that at York Avenue, is above ground. The floors of the cabins are above the East River at their lowest point. When the system was built, a set of bars called &quot;cabin entrance guides&quot; was installed to prevent the cabins from hitting each station.

=== Drive system ===
When the tramway first opened, it was equipped with main drive, auxiliary drive, and rescue drive units. The haul cable was propelled by drive bull wheels at the Roosevelt Island terminal, which was operated by the main drive unit at the same location. The main drive unit had a motor that was cited as having either a motor or a motor. An overload circuit could turn off the main drive unit in an emergency. The Roosevelt Island terminal also had the rescue drive unit, which could pull a second haul cable in case of an emergency and could be activated within five minutes of a breakdown. At the Roosevelt Island terminal was a master console, which alerted controllers to issues and could override the consoles in each cabin. The auxiliary drive was a hydrostatic drive that ran on diesel.

The tramway&#x27;s renovation involved replacing the main drive unit with an alternating current inverter system. Four backup generators were installed at each terminal behind the passenger waiting areas.

=== Operations ===
The tramway begins operating at 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time every day. The last trip is at 2:00 a.m. on weekdays and 3:30 a.m. on weekends. The route runs on 7.5-minute headways during rush hours and weekend mornings and 15-minute headways at all other times. The cabins can carry a maximum of 1,200 people an hour during peak times. On average, the tramway makes approximately 115 trips per day. The rides typically last three to four minutes. The tram is wheelchair accessible, and bicycles are permitted in cabins. Originally, the tramway could operate in most weather conditions, but it shut down if crosswinds exceeded either or . Thunderstorms and lightning could also shut down the route. The modern tramway shuts down if crosswinds exceed or if there is lightning.

The Roosevelt Island Tramway was the only aerial commuter tram in the U.S. until 2006, when the Portland Aerial Tram opened. A 2005 &quot;New York Times&quot; article described the tramway as one of fewer than two dozen aerial trams in the country, as most aerial trams in the U.S. served ski resorts. The Roosevelt Island Tramway and the Portland Aerial Tram remain the only two urban gondola lines nationwide .

== Fares ==

Originally, the city government received seven percent of all gross revenue from the tramway. During the mid-1980s, the fare was required to be the same as that on the subways and buses, and farebox revenue was used to fund operating costs. The RIOC&#x27;s franchise agreement with the city mandated that, after the 63rd Street subway opened in 1989, the tramway fare be 25 cents higher than the subway fare. The franchise agreement expired in 1995.

Children who were 5 years old or younger were allowed to ride fare-free until the 2010 closure, when RIOC stopped charging fares based on age. Ever since the tramway reopened, children under have been allowed to ride fare-free regardless of their age if they are accompanied by a paying adult.

The Roosevelt Island Tramway formerly issued its own fare token, with images of the Queensboro Bridge and a cabin on opposite sides. Standard New York City transit tokens were used on the Roosevelt Island Tramway until 2004, when MetroCard was implemented. OMNY has been accepted on the tram since August 2023. The fare using OMNY or pay-per-ride MetroCard is the same as that on the buses and subways, $2.90 for a one-way trip, . The tramway also accepts unlimited-ride MetroCards, and fares paid using OMNY are capped at $34 every seven days. Riders can transfer from the tram to buses and subway stations on either end for free, or vice versa, and tram riders can transfer to express buses for an extra fee.

== Ridership ==
After the tramway opened in 1976, it recorded 5,000 passengers on its first Sunday of operation and attracted 10,000 daily passengers in its first few weeks. The tramway carried its one-millionth rider in March 1977 and had seen 1.25 million riders, many of whom were weekend travelers, by its first anniversary. By 1989, just before the 63rd Street subway line began serving the island, the tramway saw 5,500 daily riders on average. Within a month of the subway&#x27;s opening, the tram&#x27;s weekly ridership declined from 35,000 to 20,000. Daily ridership on the tramway had decreased to 3,000 by 1993. The tramway carried approximately the same number of passengers daily in 1998, when the Roosevelt Island subway station had almost twice the ridership.

During the 2005 New York City transit strike, the tramway was one of the few public transportation modes in New York City that continued to operate, transporting three times its typical passenger count. Daily ridership averaged between 3,500 and 4,000 around that time. Just before the 2010s renovation began, the tramway had 2 million annual passengers. After the renovation was complete, daily ridership slightly increased to 6,000, and annual ridership was about 2.2 million. By 2016, the tramway accommodated 2.5 million annual passengers, while RIOC estimated that between 2.6 million and 2.7 million people rode the tramway every year. Poma estimated that 70 percent of daily riders were residents, while the remainder were tourists. The route saw 2,302,511 riders in the fiscal year ending on March 31, 2020; ridership numbers during the next two years decreased amid the COVID-19 pandemic. , the tram recorded 2,146,128 riders, having recovered much of its pre-pandemic ridership.

== Impact ==

=== Critical reception ===

The year before the tramway opened, Michael Winkleman wrote for &quot;New York&quot; magazine that the tramway was &quot;a futuristic means of travel&quot; to a &quot;newfangled town&quot; in the middle of the East River, at a time when the city was nearing bankruptcy. When the Roosevelt Island Tramway opened, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that most Roosevelt Island residents saw the tramway positively, saying that &quot;it has bridged their cherished moat without really destroying the insular peace and security&quot; of the island. The &quot;Times&quot; described the tramway as a &quot;cause for relief, if not rejoicing&quot;, for the island. &quot;The Guardian&quot; referred to the tramway as &quot;Manhattan&#x27;s touch of the Alps&quot; but wrote that the tramway, as well as Roosevelt Island as a whole, was product of &quot;too much public money [being] spent improving the lives of people who were comparatively well off&quot;. The architectural critic Paul Goldberger wrote in his book &quot;The City Observed&quot; that the ride resembled a Disneyland attraction but that &quot;there is greater pleasure still in perceiving the reality: this is not Disneyland at all—it is New York&quot;.

The ride and stations were also the subject of commentary. A &quot;Newsday&quot; reporter wrote in 1976 that &quot;there is a distinctly eerie feeling about silently gliding over traffic jams on Second Avenue&quot;. The same year, a writer for &quot;Time&quot; said that the cabin &quot;began its stately ascent noiselessly and almost imperceptibly&quot; and reached its destination in three and a half minutes. Robert A. M. Stern called the tramway&#x27;s Manhattan station &quot;a study in exaggerated contrasts&quot;.

By the mid-1980s, the tramway was so important to Roosevelt Island commuters, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; wrote that &quot;the future of this socially planned island is wound up with the fate of&quot; the tram. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article said some tramway fans called it a New York City icon like the Staten Island Ferry and Brooklyn Bridge. A writer for &quot;Newsday&quot; wrote in 1989 that &quot;it&#x27;s as if all aboard have plunked down a subway token in exchange for a great island getaway vacation&quot;. Goldberger wrote in 1990, &quot;one hopes [the tram cabins] will keep going forever, since this ride over the East River is one of the great experiences of New York.&quot; In 2003, a reporter for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; wrote that the tramway was a landmark in itself, where &quot;tourists receive a perfect photo opportunity and voyeurs get a quick glance into several luxury apartments and palatial offices&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 2006 that the tramway was not only a vital mode of transport for Roosevelt Island residents, particularly students and the elderly, but also &quot;offers a rare chance to live purely in the moment in New York, no small achievement&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; attributed the tram&#x27;s popularity to its relative safety and comfort, its lack of overcrowding, and the views from the cabins. Over the years, the tram attracted notable riders such as actor Harrison Ford, tennis player Andre Agassi, and actor/filmmaker Sylvester Stallone. After the tramway was renovated, a writer for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that the line allowed a &quot;pretty awesome&quot; view of the skyline. A &quot;Curbed&quot; writer said in 2017 that, though the tramway&#x27;s usefulness was limited by the fact that it traveled only between Manhattan and Roosevelt Island, this was counterbalanced by its &quot;sheer awesomeness&quot; and the fact that it was less crowded than the subway.

=== Influence and media ===
The construction of the Roosevelt Island Tramway inspired plans for several similar aerial tramways in New York City. These have included an architectural firm&#x27;s 2013 proposal to extend the route at either end, as well as a 2014 proposal to build a set of parallel gondola lines across the East River from Brooklyn to Manhattan. Kongfrontation, an attraction at Universal Studios Florida that operated from 1990 to 2002, included a model of King Kong attacking a model of the Roosevelt Island Tramway.

The tramway has also been used as a filming location. The 1981 film &quot;Nighthawks&quot; was partially set on the tramway; many residents objected when the filming of one scene required shutting down the tram for a few days. Other films that have used the tramway as a setting include Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002) and &quot;Dark Water&quot; (2005), directed by Walter Salles, the latter of which was filmed on the route. In addition, the tramway was shown in the opening credits of the TV series &quot;Head of the Class&quot; and &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot;, as well as a 2004 episode of &quot;Fear Factor&quot;.

<text>Glen Lang (born January 4, 1968) is an American businessman and politician who served as mayor of Cary, North Carolina from 1999 to 2003. He also was a professional hockey player.

== Early life ==
Lang was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He attended St. Paul High School where he played hockey and graduated in 1988.

Lang then attended the University of Minnesota Duluth from 1988 to 1989 where he played hockey. He transferred to the University of Wisconsin–Superior receiving a B.S. in business communication in 1993. While at the University of Wisconsin–Superior, he played hockey all three years and was named First Team All-American two times. He &quot;is considered to be among the best offensive players in team history and in NCAA Division III hockey history.&quot;

== Hockey ==
After graduation, he was a professional hockey player in the position of right wing and forward. From 1993 to 1994, he played for the Johnstown Chiefs and the Raleigh IceCaps. From 1994 and 1995, he played with the Columbus Chill. He played with the Tulsa Oilers from 1994 to 1996.

== Career ==
Early in his career, Lang worked in technology marketing for Sun Microsystems, Control Data Corporation, and Intergraph.

Glen co-founded Accura Innovative Services in 1991 and served as its CEO. After rapid growth, the company was sold.

Lang is the chief executive officer of Capitol Broadband, a wireless communications company. In 2002, he founded and became the of the Cary-based Capital Broadband&#x27;s subsidiary Connexion Technologies which specialized in FTTH networks, providing Internet and television services to multi-family housing complexes. Investors in the Connextion Technologies include James Goodnight, founder of SAS Institute. In 2010, Connextion Technologies was selected by &quot;Inc.&quot; magazine as one of the nation’s fastest-growing companies, with a 263% growth rate over three years.

In 2012, Connexion Technologies declared bankruptcy with a debt of some $500 million. From its workforce of 600, it laid off eighty people in January 2012, and cut 140 jobs at its headquarters in April 2012. The company&#x27;s downfall was the loss of a contract with DirecTV.

== Politics ==
Lang is a liberal Democrat. He first entered politics in 1997 with a self-financed bid for the Cary Town Council in Cary, North Carolina. He won, and, two years later, sought and was elected mayor in 1999.

During his time in Cary politics, Lang was an outspoken advocate of slower growth for the rapidly expanding town as well as for infrastructure improvements, incurring the ire of local developers by supporting increased fees for residential development. As mayor, he enacted the Adequate Public Facilities ordinance and other controls on growth. As a result, Cary&#x27;s growth slow significantly—the growth rate changed from 13% to under 3% under Lang&#x27;s leadership. However, councilwoman Maria Dorrel though his style was abrasive and created a &quot;hostile atmosphere.&quot;

Lang filed for re-election but did not campaign. In the 2003 race Lang placed third, and said the reason for his loss was because he only spent $10 to file and nothing on his campaign. He was succeeded as mayor by Ernie McAlister.

In 2017, Lang started a bi-partisan political action group called New Southern Voices. The groups&#x27; focus is working on policy that the majority of people can agree with, such as gerrymandering and voting rights.

== Honors ==

* University of Wisconsin–Superior Athletic Hall of Fame, 2006

== Personal life ==

<doc id="428773" wikidata="Q5992802" url="?curid=428773" title="John Moore (Scottish physician)">
<text>John Moore FRSE (1729–1802) was a Scottish physician and travel author. He also edited the works of Tobias Smollett.

==Life==

He was born on 10 October 1729 in Stirling, the son of Rev Charles Moore of Rowallan (d,1735) and his wife, Marion Anderson. The family moved to Glasgow in his youth and he was educated at Glasgow Grammar School. He was then apprenticed to Dr. John Gordon in Glasgow 1745 to 1747.

After taking a medical degree at Glasgow, he served as a Surgeon&#x27;s Mate with the army in Flanders during the Seven Years&#x27; War, then proceeded to London to continue his studies, and eventually to Paris, where became surgeon to the household of the British ambassador there. In 1751 he returned to Glasgow to rejoin Dr. John Gordon (also then practising with Dr. Thomas Hamilton). From 1769 to 1778 he accompanied the Duke of Hamilton (who was linked to Thomas) on a Grand Tour of Europe. ; they were in Geneva from Aug. 1772 to Jun. 1774, they traveled through Germany in 1775-1776, in Vienna in Sept. 1775 and then in Italy from Oct. 1775 (Venice) to June 1776 (Geneva by 30 Jun. after a journey to Rome, Naples, Florence, Bologna, Milan and Turin). On his return he took up residence in London.

In 1792 he accompanied Lord Lauderdale to Paris, and witnessed some of the principal scenes of the Revolution. His &quot;Journal during a Residence in France&quot; (1793) is the careful record of an eye-witness, and was frequently referred to by Thomas Carlyle.

In 1784 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Andrew Dalzell, James Gregory, and John Robison.

He died in Richmond in Surrey (now part of London) on 21 February 1802. He was buried at Paradise cemetery, St Mary Magdalene&#x27;s, Richmond.

==Literary works==

His novel &quot;Zeluco&quot; (1789), a close analysis of the motives of a selfish profligate, produced an impression at the time. Lord Byron said that he intended Childe Harold to be a poetical Zeluco. Moore&#x27;s other works include sketches of society and manners in France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and England (&quot;A View of Society and Manners in France, Switzerland and Germany&quot;, London, W. Strahan &amp; T. Cadell, in the Strand, 1779, 2 vol.; &quot;A View of Society and Manners in Italy, with anecdotes related to some eminent characters&quot;, London, W. Strahan &amp; T. Cadell, 1781, 2 vol.) were also popular during his lifetime

&quot;Mordaunt. Character Sketches of Life, Characters, and Manners, in Various Countries; including the Memoirs of A French Lady of Quality&quot; was an anti-French Revolution novel in three volumes. It took the form of 34 character sketches of politicians, royalty, generals, the wealthy, and the celebrity of the day. It also contains Moore&#x27;s observations as he travelled throughout Europe in the last years of the 18th century. Accounts of the heroic feats of a dashing British officer included reference to Moore&#x27;s son, General Moore.

==Family==
He had eight sons and three daughters, by Jean, daughter of John Simson, of whom the eldest surviving son was General Sir John Moore. His wife died in 1820. His other sons included Dr. James Carrick Moore (1762–1860), who wrote &quot;The Life of Lieutenant General Sir John Moore&quot;, and medical works, and Sir Graham Moore (1764–1843), who saw active naval service and became an admiral.

<text>Patrick Brian Burrell (born October 10, 1976), nicknamed &quot;Pat the Bat&quot;, is an American former professional baseball outfielder and current hitting coach for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB for the Philadelphia Phillies, Tampa Bay Rays, and San Francisco Giants. Burrell won two World Series championships (2008, 2010). During his playing days, he stood tall, weighing . He batted and threw right-handed.

Burrell attended the University of Miami, where he won the Golden Spikes Award in 1998. On June 2, 1998, he was the first overall draft pick by the Philadelphia Phillies. After two years in the minor leagues, Burrell was called up by the Phillies in 2000, and he finished fourth in voting for the National League Rookie of the Year Award. After hitting 27 home runs (HR) in 2001 (the first of eight straight years in which Burrell would hit at least 20), he hit a career-high 37 home runs in 2002 and finished 14th in NL Most Valuable Player Award voting. In 2003, Burrell signed a six-year contract with the Phillies but batted a career-low .209, with 21 home runs. In 2004, he batted .257 with 24 home runs but missed several games with a wrist injury. Burrell hit 32 home runs in 2005 and finished seventh in NL MVP Award voting after he set a career high with 117 runs batted in (RBI). In 2006, he batted .258, with 29 home runs, and 95 RBI but was benched for a few games due to a slump after April. Burrell batted .256 with 30 home runs in 2007 as the Phillies reached the playoffs for the first time in his career. He hit a home run in the playoffs as the Phillies were swept in the first round. In 2008, Burrell hit 33 home runs as the Phillies reached the playoffs again, winning the World Series.

After the 2008 season, Burrell became a free agent. He signed a two-year deal with the Tampa Bay Rays to be their designated hitter. In 2009, Burrell batted a disappointing .221 with 14 home runs. After he batted only .202 with two home runs in his first 24 games of the 2010 season, Burrell was designated for assignment by the Rays. He became a free agent and signed with the San Francisco Giants several days later. Burrell took over as San Francisco&#x27;s left fielder and hit 18 home runs in 96 games for the Giants, helping to lead them into the playoffs. He had a key double versus his former team, the Phillies, as the Giants defeated them on their way to the World Series. That fall, Burrell got his second World Series ring as the Giants emerged victorious against the Texas Rangers. The following year, he signed a one-year deal to return for the Giants’ 2011 season; however, Burrell ultimately lost his left field job, as he batted .230, with a career-low 7 home runs, in 92 games, while battling what would be a career-ending foot injury.

Burrell filed for free agency on October 30, 2011. On April 12, 2012, it was announced that Philadelphia would sign him to a one-day contract, in order that he could finish his career as a Phillie. On May 19, 2012, at Citizens Bank Park, prior to the Phillies-Boston Red Sox game, Burrell threw out the ceremonial first pitch and subsequently retired.

In March 2012, Burrell was named as a special assignment scout for the Giants and an assistant to General Manager (GM) Brian Sabean.

==Early life==
Patrick Brian Burrell was born on October 10, 1976, in Eureka Springs, Arkansas. Burrell attended San Lorenzo Valley High School in Felton, California, as a freshman. After his freshman year, he transferred to Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose, where he played baseball and football. In the football program, playing quarterback, Burrell competed against Tom Brady, who played for rival Junipero Serra High School in San Mateo, California. He decided to concentrate on baseball in his senior year, however, and he was named the California Coaches Association Player of the Year after he batted .369 with 11 home runs.

==College career==
After graduating from high school in 1995, Burrell was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 43rd round of the 1995 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft. Instead of signing, he chose to attend the University of Miami, where he played third base and was a teammate of Aubrey Huff. As a freshman, he was selected as a First-Team All-American by &quot;Baseball America&quot; and the &quot;Collegiate Baseball Newspaper&quot;. He was also named the Most Outstanding Player of the 1996 College World Series, joining Dave Winfield and Phil Nevin as the only players to win the award without winning the series. In the summer of 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Hyannis Mets and was named a league all-star. In his sophomore year, he was again named a First-Team All-American by &quot;Baseball America&quot; and the &quot;Collegiate Baseball Newspaper&quot; but also by the &quot;Sporting News&quot; this year. He was named &quot;Baseball America&#x27;s&quot; Summer Player of the year in 1997. In 1998, as a junior, he won the Golden Spikes Award as the best player in college baseball. That year, he was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies with the first overall pick in the 1998 MLB draft. Burrell finished his college career with 61 home runs, 187 runs batted in (RBI), and 170 walks in 162 games. His .442 batting average was seventh all-time by an NCAA player, and his slugging percentage of .888 was second only to Pete Incaviglia. In February 2008, Burrell was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
On July 24, 1998, Burrell and the Phillies agreed to a five-year contract with a $3.15 million signing bonus. Upon signing, Burrell was assigned to the Class A-Advanced Clearwater Phillies of the Florida State League, and he was moved to first base because Scott Rolen, Philadelphia&#x27;s third baseman in the major leagues, had just won the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award. With Clearwater in 1998, Burrell batted .303 with 7 home runs and 30 RBI in 37 games.

Entering the 1999 season, Burrell was named the top prospect in the Phillies&#x27; organization by &quot;Baseball America&quot;, who also named him baseball&#x27;s 19th best prospect. He spent most of the season with the Double-A Reading Phillies of the Eastern League, batting .333 with 28 home runs and 90 RBI in 117 games. He was named to the Eastern League&#x27;s post-season All-Star team and won the Eastern League Rookie of the Year Award. He also played 10 games with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons of the Triple-A International League, batting .152 with 1 home run and 4 RBI. In addition to playing first base, he was used as an outfielder with both teams.

Burrell was named the Phillies&#x27; top prospect and the second-best prospect in baseball by &quot;Baseball America&quot; in 2000. He began the season with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Playing first base and the outfield, he batted .294 with 4 home runs and 25 RBI in 40 games.

===Philadelphia Phillies (2000–2008)===
====2000====
On May 23, 2000, Burrell was called up by the Phillies. On May 24, he replaced Kevin Jordan (who had been filling in for injured Opening Day first baseman Rico Brogna) as the Phillies&#x27; first baseman. Making his major league debut that day, Burrell had two hits (his first coming against Octavio Dotel) and two RBI in a 9–7 victory over the Houston Astros. The following day, he hit his first career home run in a 10–6 loss to Houston. On June 20, with the Phillies trailing 2–1 against the New York Mets, Burrell hit a home run against Mets&#x27; closer Armando Benítez to make the score 2–2 in an eventual 3–2 victory for Philadelphia. The next day, Burrell had five RBI, two home runs, and his first career grand slam in a 10–5 victory for Philadelphia. On July 2, he had four hits and two RBI in a 9–1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Burrell remained the Phillies&#x27; first baseman when Brogna returned in July. He had five RBI, two home runs, and a grand slam on August 8 in a 10–4 victory over the San Diego Padres. On August 9, newly acquired outfielder Travis Lee was moved to first base, and Burrell was moved to left field for the rest of the year. On September 21, he had a game-winning single against Rick White in a 6–5 victory against the Mets. Burrell finished the season with 18 home runs, 79 RBI, and a .260 batting average in 111 games, and received the fourth most votes for the NL Rookie of the Year Award.

====2001====
On April 14, 2001, Burrell hit a game-winning home run in the sixth inning of a 2–1 victory over the Atlanta Braves. He had a game-winning two-RBI double in the ninth inning as the Phillies beat the Chicago Cubs, 6–3, on April 17. From May 19 to June 2, Burrell had a career-high 14-game hitting streak. During the streak, on May 28, he hit a game-winning two-run home run against Benítez in the tenth inning of a 5–3 win over the Mets. Burrell hit a home run and had four RBI the next day as the Phillies beat the Mets, 7–3. He hit a game-winning, three-run home run on July 4 in a 4–1 victory over the Atlanta Braves. On July 20, Burrell had a home run and five RBI (including the game-winner) as the Phillies beat the Mets, 10–1. He hit home runs in three straight games from July 31 to August 2. On August 10, as the Phillies beat the Los Angeles Dodgers, 10–5, Burrell hit his third career grand slam. He had a home run and three RBI in the final game of the season in a 4–1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. Burrell finished the season with 27 home runs, 70 RBI, and a .258 batting average in 155 games. His 18 assists led NL outfielders and tied with Raúl Mondesí for most in the major leagues. However, his 162 strikeouts were the third-highest total in Phillies&#x27; history at the time, and they currently are the ninth-highest total.

====2002====
Burrell hit a leadoff walk-off home run on April 7, 2002, in the 11th inning, giving a 3–2 victory over the Florida Marlins. Three days later, Burrell hit a two-run, walk-off home run in the 11th inning to give the Phillies a 7–5 victory over the Braves. He was the first player in the major leagues to hit two such home runs in a four-day period since Albert Belle did it in 1995, and he was the first Phillie to hit two such in a season since Von Hayes hit two in 1989. In May, Burrell hit eight home runs, the most by a Phillie in May since teammate Mike Lieberthal hit eight in 1999. From June 2 through June 16, he had an 11-game hitting streak, his longest of the season. During the streak, on June 2, Burrell tied a career high with five RBI in an 18–3 victory over the Montreal Expos. Burrell had 22 home runs by the All-Star break, the most by a Phillie since Mike Schmidt had 31 by the 1979 All-Star break. On July 15, he hit a game-winning three-run home run against Matt Herges in an 11–8 victory over Montreal. Burrell had two home runs, five RBI, and a grand slam in a 7–6 loss to the Dodgers on August 9. On August 30, Burrell had three RBI (including the game-winner) in a 7–5 victory over the Mets. He recorded his 100th RBI that day, becoming the first Phillie with 100 RBI by August 31 since Greg Luzinski accomplished the feat in 1977. Burrell finished the season with career highs in almost every offensive category, including runs (96), batting average (.286), and games (157). He was the 12th Phillie with 30 home runs and 100 RBI in a season. His 37 home runs were seventh in the NL, and his 116 RBI were third, behind only Lance Berkman (128) and Albert Pujols (127). He was 14th in NL Most Valuable Player Award voting.

====2003====
On February 3, 2003, Burrell signed a six-year, $50 million contract with the Phillies. He had two home runs and five RBI (including the game-winner) on April 9 in a 16–2 victory over the Braves. The home runs both came against Greg Maddux, making Burrell the sixth player to hit two home runs in a game against Maddux (and the first since Rolen did it in 2001). On May 20, he hit two home runs and had four RBI in an 11–7 victory over the Mets. On August 9, Burrell hit a game-tying solo home run and a game-winning two-run home run in the 8th and 10th innings of an 8–6 victory over the San Francisco Giants. He hit two home runs (including his 100th) on August 22 in a 9–4 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. On September 28, he had the final hit in Veterans Stadium (a single against Jason Marquis) in a 5–2 loss to Atlanta. Burrell endured a season-long slump, and he was occasionally benched for a few games (often in favor of Ricky Ledée) by Phillies&#x27; manager Larry Bowa. In 146 games, he batted .209 with 21 home runs and 64 RBI. However, his 21 home runs were still the second-highest total on the Phillies (teammate Jim Thome led the NL with 47).

====2004====

Burrell had four hits and three RBI on April 27, 2004, in a 7–3 victory over the Cardinals. He also made a leaping catch to take a home run away from Rolen, and he threw out Pujols trying to score from third base on a single by Édgar Rentería. On May 2, Burrell hit his first career pinch-hit home run: a two-run game-tying home run in the ninth inning against Matt Mantei of the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Phillies won the game, 6–5, in extra innings. On May 14, Burrell had four RBI (including the game-winner) in a 6–4 victory over the Colorado Rockies. He had four RBI again on May 18 (including two home runs) in an 8–7 victory over the Dodgers. On July 30, he hit two home runs in a 10–7 loss to the Cubs. On August 3, Burrell strained his left wrist during batting practice, and he was placed on the disabled list (DL) for the first time in his career the next day. He was originally scheduled to have season-ending surgery on August 13, but after getting a second opinion from Dr. Tom Graham, he decided to postpone the surgery and attempt to come back before the season ended. On September 3, he was activated from the disabled list. In 127 games, Burrell batted .257 with 24 home runs and 84 RBI.

====2005====

On April 9, 2005, Burrell had four hits and five RBI in a 10–4 victory over the Cardinals. He won the first NL Player of the Week Award of the 2005 season on April 10 after accumulating 15 RBI in the first week of the season. On May 12, he had four hits in a 7–5 loss to Cincinnati. He hit a three-run game-winning home run on May 22 in a 7–2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. He won another Player of the Week Award that day after he batted .500 with two home runs and eight RBI during the week, becoming the first Phillies player to win the award twice in a season since Hayes won it twice in 1986. On June 5, his solo home run against Mike Koplove was the game-winner in a 7–6 victory over Arizona. Four days later, he hit two home runs and had four RBI in a 10–8 victory over the Texas Rangers. On June 11, he hit a game-winning three-run home run in a 7–5 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. He hit two home runs and had five RBI in a 13–7 victory over Florida on July 14. On July 30, he had four hits and two RBI in an 8–7 victory over Colorado. On August 9, he had four RBI, including a go-ahead three-run home run against Steve Schmoll in an 8–4 victory over the Dodgers. His three-run home run against Jake Peavy on August 12 provided all of the Phillies&#x27; runs in a 3–2 victory over San Diego. He had four RBI on September 9 in a 12–5 victory over the Marlins. Two days later, he had four RBI again (including a three-run home run against Ismael Valdez) in an 11–1 victory over Florida.

Burrell finished the season batting .281 with 32 home runs in 154 games, and he set career highs in walks (99) and RBI (117). His 32 home runs led the Phillies, and his 117 RBI were second only to Andruw Jones&#x27; 128 (Pujols also had 117). On defense, however, he tied for the lead among all major league left fielders in errors, with seven, and the lowest fielding percentage among them, at .972. Burrell finished seventh in voting for the NL MVP award, and he was the co-winner of the Mike Schmidt MVP Award (along with Chase Utley).

====2006====
In April 2006, Burrell batted .300 with seven home runs. From April 14 to 27, he had 13 RBI in 11 games. However, he batted .249 for the rest of the season, and in June Philles&#x27; manager Charlie Manuel began benching him occasionally (often in favor of David Dellucci). On May 1, Burrell hit a game-winning solo home run in an 8–5 victory over Florida. On May 7, he had three RBI, including a two-run home run against Matt Morris as the Phillies defeated the Giants, 9–5. On June 9, he had three RBI, including a two-run home run against Gary Majewski, but the Phillies lost, 9–8, to the Washington Nationals. The next day, he hit a game-winning two-run home run in a 6–2 victory over the Nationals. On June 15, he hit two home runs and had three RBI against Steve Trachsel, but the Phillies lost to the Mets, 5–4. He had four hits and four RBI in a 14–6 victory over the Giants on July 15. On August 22, his RBI double in the sixth inning was the game-winning RBI in a 6–3 victory over the Cubs. His first inning grand slam against Roger Clemens on September 15 provided all of the Phillies&#x27; runs in a 4–3 victory over Houston. On September 20, his fielder&#x27;s choice was the game-winning RBI in a 6–2 victory over the Cubs. He hit two home runs, had four RBI, and set a career high with four runs scored on September 29 in a 14–2 victory over Florida. In 144 games, Burrell finished the season batting .258 with 29 home runs and 95 RBI.

====2007====

Burrell became the Phillies&#x27; longest tenured player in 2007 with the departure of Lieberthal via free agency. He hit only one home run in April but had a .292 batting average. On April 6, he homered and had four RBI (including the game-winner) in an 8–2 victory over Florida. He began to slump after April, batting .157 over the next two months. Once again, Manuel began benching him, using Greg Dobbs, Jayson Werth, or Michael Bourn in left field. On May 11, Burrell hit two home runs and had five RBI in a 7–2 victory over the Cubs. Werth was injured at the end of June, however, and Burrell reclaimed his starting job by batting .435 in July, with six home runs and 22 RBI. From July 1 through the end of the season, he batted .300 with 22 home runs and 65 RBI, starting the final 75 games of the season for the Phillies in left field. On July 14, he had four RBI in a 10–4 victory over St. Louis. Three days later, Burrell hit his 200th career home run in a 15–3 victory over the Dodgers. He had a 14-game hitting streak from July 22 to August 5, tying his career high. On August 17, in an 11–8 victory over the Pirates, Burrell got his 1,000th career hit, a two-run home run. At the end of August, the Phillies faced the Mets, whom they trailed in the NL East by six games, for a four-game series. In the first game of the series, on August 27, Burrell hit a game-winning two-run home run in a 9–2 victory. Two days later, in the third game of the series, he hit a solo home run and had a sacrifice fly (the game-winning RBI) against Óliver Pérez in a 3–2 victory. He hit two home runs in the fourth and final game of the series as the Phillies won 11–10 to sweep the Mets. On September 21, his two-run home run against Shawn Hill provided the game-winning RBI in a 6–3 victory over Washington. Burrell finished the 2007 regular season batting .256 with 30 home runs, 97 RBI, and 114 walks (a career high) in 155 games. Burrell, Ryan Howard, and Jimmy Rollins became the second trio of Phillies with 30 or more home runs (and the first since 1929). On defense, he led major league outfielders in errors, with 10, and his .948 fielding percentage was the lowest among left fielders.

In 2007, the Phillies won the NL East and reached the playoffs for the first time since 1993 and the first time in Burrell&#x27;s career. Burrell hit a home run against Jeff Francis in the first game of the NL Division Series (NLDS) but had only one other hit in the series as the Phillies were swept by the Colorado Rockies.

====2008====
Burrell batted .326 in April 2008, with 8 home runs and 24 RBI. He hit two home runs on April 7 (including the game-winner) against Bronson Arroyo in a 5–3 victory over Cincinnati. On April 24, his two-run double against David Riske provided the game-winning RBI in the Phillies&#x27; 3–1 victory over Milwaukee. With the double, Burrell got his 23rd and 24th RBI of the month, breaking Hayes&#x27; team record for most RBI in April (22). After batting .227 in May (with five home runs), Burrell batted .256 with six home runs in June. His walk-off two-run home run with two outs in the tenth inning gave the Phillies a 6–5 victory over San Francisco on May 2. On May 22, Burrell hit a game-winning pinch-hit home run in a 7–5 victory over Houston. On June 3, he hit a game-winning two-run home run in a 3–2 victory over Cincinnati. He followed up his performance in June by hitting .304 in July with seven home runs, but he slumped over the final two months, batting .191 with seven home runs. He hit a game-winning three-run home run on July 13 in a 6–3 victory over Arizona. On August 15, his home run helped the Phillies defeat the Padres 1–0. Two days later, he hit a game-winning home run in a 2–1 victory over the Padres. He had five RBI (including a game-winning three-run home run against Clayton Kershaw) in a 9–2 victory over the Dodgers on August 23. Burrell finished the season batting .250 with 33 home runs (tied for ninth in the NL), 86 RBI, and 102 walks (third in the NL) in 157 games, and the Phillies won the NL East for the second straight year.

In Game 4 (the final game) of the NLDS against the Brewers, Burrell hit two home runs (a three-run game-winning home run against Jeff Suppan and a solo home run against Guillermo Mota) in a 6–2 victory that gave the Phillies their first playoff series victory since 1993. Four days later, in the first game of the NL Championship Series, he hit a game-winning solo home run in a 3–2 victory over the Dodgers. After going hitless in his first 14 at-bats in the World Series, Burrell doubled against J. P. Howell of the Tampa Bay Rays on October 29 in Game 5 (the final game of the series). Burrell was then replaced by pinch-runner Eric Bruntlett, who scored the game&#x27;s winning run in the 4–3 victory as the Phillies won their first World Series since 1980. After the series, Burrell was chosen to lead the Phillies&#x27; World Series parade.

Burrell filed for free agency on November 6. On December 16, the Phillies signed left fielder Raúl Ibañez to a three-year contract, ending Burrell&#x27;s tenure in Philadelphia. Burrell&#x27;s 104 double plays grounded into were the seventh-most in Phillies history, and his 1,273 strikeouts were second only to Schmidt. However, Burrell was fifth in walks (785), eighth in RBI (827), and fourth in home runs (251) as a Phillie. His eight straight seasons with at least 20 home runs were topped only by Schmidt.

===Tampa Bay Rays (2009–2010)===

On January 5, 2009, the Tampa Bay Rays signed Burrell to a two-year, $16 million contract. They planned to use him as their designated hitter. Burrell got a standing ovation when he returned to Philadelphia for an exhibition series on April 3 and 4. On April 9, Burrell flew to Philadelphia to join the Phillies as they received their World Series rings in a pregame ceremony. After the ceremony, he flew back to Boston for the Rays&#x27; game against the Boston Red Sox. On May 17, Burrell was placed on the disabled list (retroactive to May 12) with a neck strain. He was activated from the DL on June 11. On June 24, he hit a game-winning two-run home run and had three RBI in a 7–1 victory over the Phillies. On July 7, he hit a walk-off two-run home run in the 11th inning of a 3–1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. On September 2, he had a game-winning RBI single in an 8–5 victory over Boston. He had four RBI against Jason Berken (including a three-run home run) on September 15 in a 10–5 loss to Baltimore. Burrell slumped throughout the 2009 season, and he finished the year batting .221 in 122 games. He set or tied career-lows in hits (91), home runs (14), RBI (64), and walks (57).

Burrell hit a game-winning two-run home run in the 12th inning of a 3–1 victory over Boston on April 17, 2010. On April 27, he hit a game-winning three-run home run in an 8–6 victory over the Oakland Athletics. In his first 24 games of the season, Burrell batted .202 with two home runs and 13 RBI. On May 15, he was designated for assignment and replaced on the Rays&#x27; roster by Hank Blalock. Four days later, he became a free agent after clearing waivers.

===San Francisco Giants (2010–2011)===

On May 29, 2010, the San Francisco Giants signed Burrell to a minor league contract and assigned him to the triple-A Fresno Grizzlies of the Pacific Coast League. After batting .313 with one home run and six RBI in five games, he was called up to the Giants on June 4 to replace John Bowker, who was optioned to Fresno. The next day, he took over from Aubrey Huff (who moved over to right field) as the Giants&#x27; left fielder. On July 31, with the Giants trailing 1–0 to the Dodgers in the eighth inning, Burrell hit a two-run home run to give the Giants a 2–1 victory. On August 6, he hit a game-winning sacrifice fly in the 11th inning of a 3–2 victory over Atlanta. Three days later, the Giants faced the Chicago Cubs for a four-game series. In the first game of the series, Burrell hit a walk-off sacrifice fly in the 11th inning of a 4–3 victory. In the third game, he had three RBI (including a game-winning home run in the eighth inning against Justin Berg) in a 5–4 victory. In the finale, Burrell hit two home runs (including a grand slam) and had five RBI in an 8–7 victory. On August 17, Burrell returned to Philadelphia for his first regular season game there as a member of the opposing team, and he received a standing ovation. He hit a home run in his first at bat of the game, but the Giants lost, 9–3. With the Giants in 2010, Burrell batted .266 with 289 at-bats, 18 home runs, and 51 RBI in 96 games as the Giants won the NL West and advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 2003. Burrell&#x27;s 2010 totals were 373 at-bats, 94 hits, 20 home runs, and 64 RBI in 120 games.

In Game 2 of the NLDS against Atlanta on October 8, Burrell hit a three-run home run in a 5–4 loss. On October 16, in Game 1 of the NLCS against the Phillies, he had an RBI double against Roy Halladay. Nate Schierholtz then pinch-ran for him, scoring the winning run in the Giants&#x27; 4–3 victory. In the World Series, Burrell struck out eleven times in thirteen at-bats, had no hits, and was benched for Game 4. The Giants won the World Series in five games, and Burrell received his second championship ring.

On November 1, Burrell filed for free agency. A month later, on December 3, he signed a one-year, $1 million contract to return to the Giants in 2011. In his first 20 games of 2011, Burrell batted .270 with five home runs and eight RBI. On April 18, he hit a game-winning three-run home run in an 8–1 victory over Colorado. After batting .172 with one RBI over his next 12 games, he was replaced as the Giants&#x27; left fielder by Cody Ross, who was replaced as the Giants&#x27; right fielder by Schierholtz. On May 4, Burrell had a game-winning RBI single in a 2–0 victory over the Mets. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Cubs on June 28, Burrell had a home run and three RBI in a 13–7 victory. He had a game-winning RBI single on July 7 in a 2–1 victory over San Diego. On July 15, Burrell was placed on the disabled list with a potentially career-ending foot injury. He returned from the DL on August 31, but he was not able to start regularly upon returning. For the final game of the year (a 6–3 loss to Colorado on September 28), Burrell started in left field after asking Giants&#x27; manager Bruce Bochy to put him in the lineup since it was potentially his final game. He finished the year batting .230 with career-lows in games (92), at bats (183), hits (42), home runs (seven), and RBI (21). On October 30, he filed for free agency.

Burrell signed a one-day contract with the Philadelphia Phillies on May 19, 2012, so he could officially retire as a Phillie. It was announced on February 28, 2015, that Burrell would be inducted onto the Phillies Wall of Fame. He was subsequently inducted on Friday, July 31. He stated, &quot;I always knew that the fans were behind me, even through the tough times. When David called and told me I had been voted in by the fans, it was overwhelming.&quot; Burrell was the 37th inductee to the Wall of Fame.

===&quot;Met Killer&quot;===
Burrell showed a penchant for hitting clutch home runs against the New York Mets. In 2007, Burrell hit four home runs in a four-game series sweep against the Mets in late August. In total, he hit 42 home runs against the Mets through the 2011 season, his highest total against any team, which ranked fifth all-time in home runs hit against the franchise at the time of his departure from Philadelphia (he has since fallen to sixth, having been passed by Chipper Jones.) Batting .264 at the Phillies&#x27; home parks against a .228 mark at Shea Stadium, Burrell nonetheless enjoyed playing in New York, citing the atmosphere and memorable home runs against Mets pitchers, including two in back-to-back games against then-closer Armando Benítez.

==Post-playing career==
After his playing career ended, Burrell became a special assignment scout for the San Francisco Giants in Scottsdale, Arizona.

==Coaching career==
He was formerly a hitting coach for the San Jose Giants, the Giants&#x27; farm team in the California League.

On November 10, 2023, the San Francisco Giants announced that Burrell would be their hitting coach alongside Justin Viele.

==Personal life==
Pat had an English Bulldog named Elvis who was featured in the Phillies 2008 World Series Parade. Elvis died in September 2014.

<text>Michael Frayn, FRSL (; born 8 September 1933) is an English playwright and novelist. He is best known as the author of the farce &quot;Noises Off&quot; and the dramas &quot;Copenhagen&quot; and &quot;Democracy&quot;.

Frayn&#x27;s novels, such as &quot;Towards the End of the Morning&quot;, &quot;Headlong&quot; and &quot;Spies&quot;, have also been critical and commercial successes, making him one of the handful of writers in the English language to succeed in both drama and prose fiction. He has also written philosophical works, such as &quot;The Human Touch: Our Part in the Creation of the Universe&quot; (2006).

==Early life==
Frayn was born at Mill Hill, north London (then in Middlesex), to Thomas Allen Frayn, an asbestos salesman from a working-class family of blacksmiths, locksmiths and servants and his wife Violet Alice (née Lawson). Violet was the daughter of a failed palliasse merchant; having studied as a violinist at the Royal Academy of Music, she worked as a shop assistant and occasional clothes model at Harrods. After the slump in asbestos prices, Frayn&#x27;s sister supported the family by also working at Harrods, as a children&#x27;s hairdresser.

Frayn grew up in Ewell, Surrey, and was educated at Kingston Grammar School. Following two years of National Service, during which he learned Russian at the Joint Services School for Linguists, Frayn read Moral Sciences (Philosophy) at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, graduating in 1957. He then worked as a reporter and columnist for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot;, where he established a reputation as a satirist and comic writer, and began publishing his plays and novels.

==Theatre work==
Frayn&#x27;s play &quot;Copenhagen&quot; deals with a historical event, a 1941 meeting between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr and his protégé, the German Werner Heisenberg, when Denmark is under German occupation, and Heisenberg is—maybe?—working on the development of an atomic bomb. Frayn was attracted to the topic because it seemed to &#x27;encapsulate something about the difficulty of knowing why people do what they do and
there is a parallel between that and the impossibility that Heisenberg established in physics, about ever knowing everything about the behaviour of physical objects&#x27;. The play explores various possibilities.

Frayn&#x27;s more recent play &quot;Democracy&quot; ran successfully in London (the National Theatre, 2003-4 and West End transfer), Copenhagen and on Broadway (Brooks Atkinson Theatre, 2004-5); it dramatised the story of the German chancellor Willy Brandt and his personal assistant, the East German spy Günter Guillaume. Five years later, again at the National Theatre, it was followed by &quot;Afterlife&quot;, a biographical drama of the life of the great Austrian impresario Max Reinhardt, director of the Salzburg Festival, which opened at the Lyttelton Theatre in June 2008, starring Roger Allam as Reinhardt.

Frayn&#x27;s other original plays include two evenings of short plays, &quot;The Two of Us&quot; and &quot;Alarms and Excursions&quot;, the philosophical comedies &quot;Alphabetical Order&quot;, &quot;Benefactors&quot;, &quot;Clouds&quot;, &quot;Make and Break&quot; and &quot;Here&quot;, and the farces &quot;Donkeys&#x27; Years&quot;, &quot;Balmoral&quot; (also known as &quot;Liberty Hall&quot;), and &quot;Noises Off&quot;, which critic Frank Rich wrote in his book &quot;The Hot Seat&quot; &quot;is, was, and probably always will be the funniest play written in my lifetime.&quot;

== Novels ==
Frayn&#x27;s novels include &quot;Headlong&quot; (shortlisted for the 1999 Booker Prize), &quot;The Tin Men&quot; (won the 1966 Somerset Maugham Award), &quot;The Russian Interpreter&quot; (1967, Hawthornden Prize), &quot;Towards the End of the Morning&quot;, &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;, &quot;A Landing on the Sun&quot;, &quot;A Very Private Life&quot;, &quot;Now You Know&quot; and &quot;Skios&quot; (long-listed for the Man Booker Prize in 2012). His novel &quot;Spies&quot; was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize and won the Whitbread Prize for Fiction in 2002.

== Non-fiction ==
Frayn has written a book about philosophy, &quot;Constructions&quot;, and a book of his own philosophy, &quot;The Human Touch&quot;.

Frayn&#x27;s columns for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; (collected in &quot;At Bay in Gear Street, The Day of the Dog&quot;, &quot;The Book of Fub&quot; and &quot;On the Outskirts&quot;) are models of the comic essay; in the 1980s a number of them were adapted and performed for BBC Radio 4 by Martin Jarvis.

Frayn has also written screenplays for the films &quot;Clockwise&quot;, starring John Cleese, &quot;First and Last&quot; starring Tom Wilkinson, &quot;Birthday&quot;, &quot;Jamie on a Flying Visit&quot;, and the TV series &quot;Making Faces&quot;, starring Eleanor Bron.

== Translation ==
Frayn learned Russian during his period of National Service. Frayn is now considered to be Britain&#x27;s finest translator of Anton Chekhov (&quot;The Seagull&quot;, &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot;, &quot;Three Sisters&quot; and &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;), including an early untitled work, which he titled &quot;Wild Honey&quot; (other translations of the work have called it &quot;Platonov&quot; or &quot;Don Juan in the Russian Manner&quot;). From four of Chekhov&#x27;s short stories and four of his one-act plays Frayn devised &quot;The Sneeze&quot; (originally performed on the West End by Rowan Atkinson).

Frayn has also translated Yuri Trifonov&#x27;s play &quot;Exchange&quot;, Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Fruits of Enlightenment&quot;, and Jean Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;Number One&quot;.

== Television ==
In 1980, Frayn presented the Australian journey of the BBC television series &quot;Great Railway Journeys of the World&quot;. His journey took him from Sydney to Perth on the Indian Pacific, with side visits to the Lithgow Zig Zag and a journey on The Ghan&#x27;s old route from Marree to Alice Springs shortly before the opening of the new line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs.

== Personal life ==
Frayn has three daughters with his first wife, Gillian Palmer: Rebecca, a documentary film maker, writer and actress; Susanna; and Jenny, a television producer. Frayn and his second wife, Claire Tomalin, a biographer and literary journalist, live in Petersham, London.

<text>A check valve, non-return valve, reflux valve, retention valve, foot valve, or one-way valve is a valve that normally allows fluid (liquid or gas) to flow through it in only one direction.

Check valves are two-port valves, meaning they have two openings in the body, one for fluid to enter and the other for fluid to leave. There are various types of check valves used in a wide variety of applications. Check valves are often part of common household items. Although they are available in a wide range of sizes and costs, check valves generally are very small, simple, and inexpensive. Check valves work automatically and most are not controlled by a person or any external control; accordingly, most do not have any valve handle or stem. The bodies (external shells) of most check valves are made of plastic or metal.

An important concept in check valves is the cracking pressure which is the minimum differential upstream pressure between inlet and outlet at which the valve will operate. Typically the check valve is designed for and can therefore be specified for a specific cracking pressure.

== Technical terminology ==
;Cracking pressure: Refers to the minimum pressure differential needed between the inlet and outlet of the valve at which the first indication of flow occurs (steady stream of bubbles). Cracking pressure is also known as unseating head (pressure) or opening pressure.

;Reseal pressure: Refers to the pressure differential between the inlet and outlet of the valve during the closing process of the check valve, at which there is no visible leak rate. Reseal pressure is also known as sealing pressure, seating head (pressure) or closing pressure.

;Back pressure: a pressure higher at the outlet of a fitting than that at the inlet or a point upstream

==Types ==
===Ball check valve===
A ball check valve is a check valve in which the closing member, the movable part to block the flow, is a ball. In some ball check valves, the ball is spring-loaded to help keep it shut. For those designs without a spring, reverse flow is required to move the ball toward the seat and create a seal. The interior surface of the main seats of ball check valves are more or less conically tapered to guide the ball into the seat and form a positive seal when stopping reverse flow.

Ball check valves are often very small, simple, and cheap. They are commonly used in liquid or gel minipump dispenser spigots, spray devices, some rubber bulbs for pumping air, etc., manual air pumps and some other pumps, and refillable dispensing syringes. Although the balls are most often made of metal, they can be made of other materials; in some specialized cases out of highly durable or inert materials, such as sapphire. High-performance liquid chromatography pumps and similar high pressure applications commonly use small inlet and outlet ball check valves with balls of (artificial) ruby and seats made of sapphire or both ball and seat of ruby, for both hardness and chemical resistance. After prolonged use, such check valves can eventually wear out or the seat can develop a crack, requiring replacement. Therefore, such valves are made to be replaceable, sometimes placed in a small plastic body tightly fitted inside a metal fitting which can withstand high pressure and which is screwed into the pump head.
There are similar check valves where the disc is not a ball, but some other shape, such as a poppet energized by a spring. Ball check valves should not be confused with ball valves, which are a different type of valve in which a ball rotating on a pin acts as a controllable rotor to stop or direct flow.

===Diaphragm check valve===
A diaphragm check valve uses a flexing rubber diaphragm positioned to create a normally-closed valve. Pressure on the upstream side must be greater than the pressure on the downstream side by a certain amount, known as the pressure differential, for the check valve to open allowing flow. Once positive pressure stops, the diaphragm automatically flexes back to its original closed position. This type is used in respirators (face masks) with an exhalation valve.

===Swing check valve===

A swing check valve (or tilting disc check valve) is a check valve in which the disc, the movable part to block the flow, swings on a hinge or trunnion, either onto the seat to block reverse flow or off the seat to allow forward flow. The seat opening cross-section may be perpendicular to the centerline between the two ports or at an angle. Although swing check valves can come in various sizes, large check valves are often swing check valves. A common issue caused by swing check valves is known as water hammer. This can occur when the swing check closes and the flow abruptly stops, causing a surge of pressure resulting in high velocity shock waves that act against the piping and valves, placing large stress on the metals and vibrations in the system. Undetected, water hammer can rupture pumps, valves, and pipes within the system.

The flapper valve in a flush-toilet mechanism is an example of this type of valve. Tank pressure holding it closed is overcome by manual lift of the flapper. It then remains open until the tank drains and the flapper falls due to gravity. Another variation of this mechanism is the clapper valve, used in applications such firefighting and fire life safety systems. A hinged gate only remains open in the inflowing direction. The clapper valve often also has a spring that keeps the gate shut when there is no forward pressure. Another example is the backwater valve (for sanitary drainage system) that protects against flooding caused by return flow of sewage waters. Such risk occurs most often in sanitary drainage systems connected to combined sewerage systems and in rainwater drainage systems. It may be caused by intense rainfall, thaw or flood.

===Butterfly check valve===

A butterfly check valve is a variant on the swing check valve, having two hinged flaps which act as check valves to prevent backwards flow. It should not be confused with the similarly named butterfly valve, which is used for flow regulation and does not have a one-way flow function.

===Stop-check valve===
A stop-check valve is a check valve with override control to stop flow regardless of flow direction or pressure. In addition to closing in response to backflow or insufficient forward pressure (normal check-valve behavior), it can also be deliberately shut by an external mechanism, thereby preventing any flow regardless of forward pressure.

===Lift-check valve===
A lift-check valve is a check valve in which the disc, sometimes called a &quot;lift&quot;, can be lifted up off its seat by higher pressure of inlet or upstream fluid to allow flow to the outlet or downstream side. A guide keeps motion of the disc on a vertical line, so the valve can later reseat properly. When the pressure is no longer higher, gravity or higher downstream pressure will cause the disc to lower onto its seat, shutting the valve to stop reverse flow.

===In-line check valve===
An in-line check valve is a check valve similar to the lift check valve. However, this valve generally has a spring that will &#x27;lift&#x27; when there is pressure on the upstream side of the valve. The pressure needed on the upstream side of the valve to overcome the spring tension is called the &#x27;cracking pressure&#x27;. When the pressure going through the valve goes below the cracking pressure, the spring will close the valve to prevent back-flow in the process.

===Duckbill valve===
A duckbill valve is a check valve in which flow proceeds through a soft tube that protrudes into the downstream side. Back-pressure collapses this tube, cutting off flow.

===Pneumatic non-return valve===
Pneumatic non-return valves provide the ability to lock the valve, hence preventing flow in either direction. This may be used if for example a site with hazardous materials should be protected from flood water, however it is also important that the materials can’t leak, for example during transfer between vessels.

===Reed valve===
A reed valve is a check valve formed by a flexible flat sheet that seals an orifice plate. The cracking pressure is very low, the moving part has low mass allowing rapid operation, the flow resistance is moderate, and the seal improves with back pressure. These are commonly found in two stroke internal combustion engines as the air intake valve for the crankcase volume and in air compressors as both intake and exhaust valves for the cylinder(s). Although reed valves are typically used for gasses rather than liquids, the Autotrol brand of water treatment control valves are designed as a set of reed valves taking advantage of the sealing characteristic, selectively forcing open some of the reeds to establish a flow path.

===Flow check===
A flow check is a check valve used in hydronic heating and cooling systems to prevent unwanted passive gravity flow. A flow check is a simple flow lifted gravity closed heavy metal stopper designed for low flow resistance, many decades of continuous service, and to self-clean the fine particulates commonly found in hydronic systems from the sealing surfaces. To accomplish self cleaning, the stopper is typically not conical. A circular recess in a weight that fits over a matching narrow ridge at the rim of an orifice is a common design. The application inherently tolerates a modest reverse leakage rate, a perfect seal is not required. A flow check has an operating screw to allow the valve to be held open, the opposite of the control on a stop-check valve, as an aide for filling the system and for purging air from the system.

==Multiple valves==
Multiple check valves can be connected in series. For example, a double check valve is often used as a backflow prevention device to keep potentially contaminated water from siphoning back into municipal water supply lines. There are also &quot;double ball check valves&quot; in which there are two ball/seat combinations sequentially in the same body to ensure positive leak-tight shutoff when blocking reverse flow; and piston check valves, wafer check valves, and ball-and-cone check valves.

==Applications==
===Pumps===

Check valves are often used with some types of pumps. Piston-driven and diaphragm pumps such as metering pumps and pumps for chromatography commonly use inlet and outlet ball check valves. These valves often look like small cylinders attached to the pump head on the inlet and outlet lines. Many similar pump-like mechanisms for moving volumes of fluids around use check valves such as ball check valves. The feed pumps or injectors which supply water to steam boilers are fitted with check valves to prevent back-flow.

Check valves are also used in the pumps that supply water to water slides. The water to the slide flows through a pipe which doubles as the tower holding the steps to the slide. When the facility with the slide closes for the night, the check valve stops the flow of water through the pipe; when the facility reopens for the next day, the valve is opened and the flow restarts, making the slide ready for use again.

===Industrial processes===
Check valves are used in many fluid systems such as those in chemical and power plants, and in many other industrial processes.

Typical applications in the nuclear industry are feed water control systems, dump lines, make-up water, miscellaneous process systems, N2 systems, and monitoring and sampling systems. In aircraft and aerospace, check valves are used where high vibration, large temperature extremes and corrosive fluids are present. For example, spacecraft and launch vehicle propulsion propellant control for reaction control systems (RCS) and Attitude Control Systems (ACS) and aircraft hydraulic systems.

Check valves are also often used when multiple gases are mixed into one gas stream. A check valve is installed on each of the individual gas streams to prevent mixing of the gases in the original source. For example, if a fuel and an oxidizer are to be mixed, then check valves will normally be used on both the fuel and oxidizer sources to ensure that the original gas cylinders remain pure and therefore nonflammable.

In 2010, NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory slightly modified a simple check valve design with the intention to store liquid samples indicative to life on Mars in separate reservoirs of the device without fear of cross contamination.

===Domestic use===
When a sanitary potable water supply is plumbed to an unsanitary system, for example lawn sprinklers, a dish washer or a washing machine, a check valve called a backflow preventer is used to prevent contaminated water from re-entering the domestic water supply.

Some types of irrigation sprinklers and drip irrigation emitters have small check valves built into them to keep the lines from draining when the system is shut off.

Check valves used in domestic heating systems to prevent vertical convection, especially in combination with solar thermal installations, also are called gravity brakes.

Rainwater harvesting systems that are plumbed into the main water supply of a utility provider may be required to have one or more check valves fitted to prevent contamination of the primary supply by rainwater.

Hydraulic jacks use ball check valves to build pressure on the lifting side of the jack.

Check valves are commonly used in inflatables, such as toys, mattresses and boats. This allows the object to be inflated without continuous or uninterrupted air pressure.

==History==
Frank P. Cotter developed a &quot;simple self sealing check valve, adapted to be connected in the pipe connections without requiring special fittings and which may be readily opened for inspection or repair&quot; 1907 (U.S. patent 865,631).

Nikola Tesla invented a deceptively simple one-way valve for fluids in 1916, called a Tesla valve. It was patented in 1920 (U.S. patent 1,329,559).

<doc id="428802" wikidata="Q5569988" url="?curid=428802" title="Glittering generality">
<text>In rhetoric, a glittering generality or glowing generality is an emotionally appealing phrase so closely associated with highly-valued concepts and beliefs that it carries conviction without supporting information or reason. Such highly valued concepts attract general approval and acclaim. Their appeal is to emotions such as love of country and home, and desire for peace, freedom, glory, and honor. They ask for approval without examination of the reason. They are typically used in propaganda posters/advertisements and used by propagandists and politicians. Often they are catchphrases or slogans.

==Origins==
The term dates from the mid-19th century in the American context. Advocates for abolition of slavery argued that the institution was contradictory to the United States Declaration of Independence&#x27;s statements that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; and possessed natural rights to &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.&quot; Proslavery opponents countered that the Declaration was a collection of inspirational statements intended for revolution, rather than a concrete set of principles for civil society. Rufus Choate, a Whig senator from Massachusetts, likely brought the term into general discourse in his August 1856 public letter to the Maine Whig Committee. In the letter, Choate expressed fear that antislavery Whigs, inspired by the Declaration&#x27;s &quot;glittering and sound generalities,&quot; would destroy the Union. The letter – and especially Choate&#x27;s phrase – became the topic of much public debate in the northern press. However, it is unclear whether the phrase was originated by Choate or Franklin J. Dickman, a judge and legal scholar of that era. Abraham Lincoln, in an April 6, 1859 letter to Henry L. Pierce, criticized political opponents of the day who slighted the foundational principles of Thomas Jefferson as &quot;glittering generalities&quot;. Lincoln asserted that Jefferson&#x27;s abstract ideals were not mere rhetoric, but the &quot;definitions and axioms of free society.&quot;

The term then came to be used for any set of ideas or principles that are appealing but nonspecific. In the 1930s, the Institute for Propaganda Analysis popularized the term as one of its &quot;seven propaganda devices&quot;.

==Qualities==
A glittering generality has two qualities: it is vague and it has positive connotations. Words and phrases such as &quot;common good&quot;, &quot;reform&quot;, &quot;courage&quot;, &quot;democracy&quot;, &quot;freedom&quot;, &quot;hope&quot;, &quot;patriotism&quot;, “family values”, &quot;strength&quot;, are terms with which people all over the world have powerful associations, and they may have trouble disagreeing with them. However, these words are highly and ambiguous, and meaningful differences exist regarding what they actually mean or should mean in the real world. George Orwell described such words at length in his essay &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot;
 The words &quot;democracy, socialism, freedom, patriotic, realistic, justice&quot; have each of them several different meanings which cannot be reconciled with one another. In the case of a word like &quot;democracy,&quot; not only is there no agreed definition, but the attempt to make one is resisted from all sides. It is almost universally felt that when we call a country democratic we are praising it: consequently the defenders of every kind of regime claim that it is a democracy, and fear that they might have to stop using that word if it were tied down to any one meaning. Words of this kind are often used in a consciously dishonest way. That is, the person who uses them has his own private definition, but allows his hearer to think he means something quite different. Statements like &quot;Marshal Pétain was a true patriot,&quot; &quot;The Soviet press is the freest in the world,&quot; &quot;The Catholic Church is opposed to persecution,&quot; are almost always made with intent to deceive. Other words used in variable meanings, in most cases more or less dishonestly, are: &quot;class, totalitarian, liberal, reactionary, equality.&quot;

<text>Mikhail Vasilievich Pletnev (, &quot;Mikha&#x27;il Vas&#x27;ilevič Plet&#x27;nëv&quot;; born 14 April 1957) is a Russian pianist, conductor and composer.

==Life and career==

Pletnev was born into a musical family in Arkhangelsk, then part of the Soviet Union. His father played and taught the bayan, and his mother was a pianist. He studied with Kira Shashkina for six years at the Special Music School of the Kazan Conservatory, before entering the Moscow Central Music School at the age of 13, where he studied under Evgeny Timakin. Also in the class was fellow pianist Ivo Pogorelić, with whom he formed a lasting friendship. In 1974 he entered the Moscow Conservatory, studying under Yakov Flier and Lev Vlassenko. At age 21, he won the Gold Medal at the VI International Tchaikovsky Competition in 1978, which earned him international recognition and drew great attention worldwide. The following year he made his debut in the United States. He also taught at the Moscow Conservatory. Pletnev has acknowledged Sergei Rachmaninoff as a particularly notable influence on him as a musician.
In 1988 Pletnev was invited to perform at the superpower conference in Washington, D.C., where he met and befriended Mikhail Gorbachev. From this friendship, he gained the support to found two years later the Russian National Orchestra in 1990, the first non-government-supported orchestra in Russia since 1917, and became its first principal conductor. He and the orchestra made their recording debut on Virgin Classics, releasing Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Sixth Symphony and &quot;Marche Slave&quot; in 1991. He stepped down as Principal Conductor in the late 1990s, but remained the orchestra&#x27;s artistic director.

Pletnev has made a number of recordings with Deutsche Grammophon. His recordings are mostly of Russian works, though in 2007 he recorded the complete Beethoven symphonies. The first works he recorded were for orchestra, including Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, his Sixth Symphony and &quot;Manfred Symphony&quot;, and Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Second and Third Symphonies. Pletnev&#x27;s recording of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s First Symphony (Winter Daydreams) received critical acclaim.

In July 2010 Pletnev was arrested on suspicion of child molestation in Thailand, where he owns a home. He denied the allegations and was released on bail. The charges were dropped on 28 September.

<doc id="428809" wikidata="Q1277145" url="?curid=428809" title="Earl Pomeroy">
<text>Earl Ralph Pomeroy III (born September 2, 1952) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the U.S. representative for from 1993 to 2011. He is a member of the North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party. He currently serves as senior counsel for the Washington, D.C. branch of Alston &amp; Bird.

As of 2024, he is the last Democrat to have represented North Dakota in the U.S. House of Representatives.

== Early life, education and career ==
Pomeroy was born in Valley City in Barnes County in eastern North Dakota. He attended Valley City State University where he was initiated as a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity and later transferred to the University of North Dakota at Grand Forks, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and went on to do graduate research in legal history at Durham University in England. Pomeroy returned to North Dakota to attend the University of North Dakota School of Law, having received his Juris Doctor in 1979. In 2011, he received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from the University of North Dakota.

==State government==
Pomeroy was elected to the North Dakota House of Representatives in 1980, and became North Dakota Insurance Commissioner in 1985, a post that he held until 1992.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Committee assignments ===
*Committee on Agriculture
**Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit, Energy, and Research
**Subcommittee on General Farm Commodities and Risk Management
*Committee on Ways and Means
**Subcommittee on Trade
**Subcommittee on Health
**Subcommittee on Social Security(chairman)

=== Caucuses and coalitions ===
*Co-chair of the bipartisan Rural Health Care Coalition

Pomeroy was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition.

== Political positions ==

=== Iraq War ===
Although he supported authorizing force in Iraq in 2002, he later increasingly spoke out against the war. Earl Pomeroy supported the House resolution opposing George W. Bush&#x27;s troop surge plan in February 2007. He said in a floor speech, &quot;We take care of our soldiers over [in Iraq] by making sure their deployments are only for acceptable periods and at acceptable intervals, with enough time at home in between to heal, to rest, and to train. But beyond these things, we take care of our soldiers over there when we as a Congress make certain the mission they have sent to perform has a reasonable chance of success.

&quot;In a war where so many tragic mistakes have been made, this Congress must not sit quietly by while additional plans are cooked up in Washington whose only certainty is to accelerate the loss of American lives, compound the already severe strain on our military capabilities, and accelerate the burn rate of American dollars spent in Iraq. ... Without the commitment between the warring parties in Iraq to stop the killing, and create a political agreement upon which a national government can exist, 20,000 more U.S. soldiers are not likely to bring about a lasting peace.&quot;

===Health care ===
Pomeroy voted for the Affordable Health Care for America Act in November 2009, stating that the bill was far from perfect, &quot;but so is our present system.&quot;

===Adoption tax credit===
Pomeroy strongly supported legislation allowing parents to deduct adoption expenses they incurred. On the day of the vote, Pomeroy brought his daughter whom he and his wife had adopted from South Korea, onto the House floor.

==Political campaigns ==
Pomeroy was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1992. For his first five campaigns, he did not gain the victory margins scored by North Dakota&#x27;s two Democratic Senators, Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan. Until 2004, he never won more than 57 percent of the vote. However, in 2004 he was reelected with almost 60 percent.

===2006===

Pomeroy faced Republican Matthew Mechtel in the 2006 general election, easily winning re-election to his eighth term. He received a larger percentage of votes (65.68%) than in his previous elections.

===2008===

In 2008, Pomeroy easily retained his seat in the House of Representatives defeating Republican Duane Sand.

===2010===

Pomeroy was defeated by Republican nominee state Representative Rick Berg. That marked the first time in 30 years that this seat would be held by a Republican.

Pomeroy&#x27;s election loss was attributed to his vote for the health care reform bill.

==Post-Congressional career==
After leaving Congress, Pomeroy joined the K Street firm Alston &amp; Bird, where he works as a lobbyist for hospitals. Pomeroy&#x27;s move to the private sector was &quot;unusually swift&quot;; by June 2011, he had registered as a lobbyist. Pomeroy joined former Senate Majority Leader and presidential candidate Bob Dole at Alston &amp; Bird.

==Personal life==
Pomeroy is a Presbyterian. He he has two children, Kathryn and Scott. On July 2, 2009, Pomeroy married Mary Berglund in a private ceremony at the site of his family&#x27;s homestead in Valley City, North Dakota.

Pomeroy was a charter member of the rugby club at UND. He played rugby previously at Grey College at Durham University where he was working on a master&#x27;s degree.

<text>The Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) also known as New Hope MMD is a political party in Zambia. Originally formed to oust the previous government, MMD controlled an absolute majority in parliament between 1991 and 2001, when its past leader, Frederick Chiluba was President of Zambia. Its election into power in 1991 ended the 27-year rule of President Kenneth Kaunda and his United National Independence Party (UNIP). It remained the dominant party within Zambian politics until the general elections of September 2011.

==History==
===Formation and government===
Growing opposition to UNIP&#x27;s monopoly on power, due in part to economic problems and corruption, led to the formation of the MMD in July 1990, led by Frederick Chiluba, the head of the country&#x27;s trade unions. During that same year, pushed by internal and international pressure, Kaunda agreed to a referendum on the one-party state, but in the face of continued opposition, dropped the referendum and signed a constitutional amendment that relinquished UNIP&#x27;s guaranteed right to rule.

Multi-party general elections were held on 31 October 1991, and saw the MMD sweep to power in a massive landslide. Chiluba was elected president with 76% of the vote to Kaunda&#x27;s 24%, whilst the MMD won 125 of the 150 elected seats in the National Assembly. However, by the end of Chiluba&#x27;s first five-year term as president, the MMD&#x27;s commitment to political reform had faded in the face of re-election demands and several prominent members left to establish other parties.

Relying on the MMD&#x27;s overwhelming majority in parliament, President Chiluba in May 1996 pushed through constitutional amendments that effectively eliminated former President Kaunda and other prominent opposition leaders from the 1996 general elections. As a result, UNIP boycotted the elections, allowing Chiluba to be easily re-elected with 73% of the vote, whilst the MMD won 131 of the 150 seats in the National Assembly. Afterward, however, several opposition parties and non-governmental organisations declared the elections neither free nor fair.

Early in 2001, supporters of President Chiluba mounted a campaign to amend the constitution to enable Chiluba to seek a third term of office; the campaign led to further breakaways from the MMD, including the Forum for Democracy and Development and the Heritage Party. Eventually civil society, opposition parties, and other MMD members exerted sufficient pressure on Chiluba to force him to back away from any attempt at a third term.

Levy Mwanawasa was selected as the MMD presidential candidate for the 2001 elections, winning with just 28% of the vote. Although the MMD remained the largest party in the National Assembly, it lost its majority after being reduced to 69 seats. Three parties submitted petitions to the High Court, challenging the election results. The petition remained under consideration by the courts in February 2003 when it was ruled that while there had been irregularities these had not been large enough to affect the outcome; thus the result was upheld. Opposition parties won a majority of parliamentary seats in the December, 2001 election, but subsequent by-elections and liberal use of government patronage to secure the support of opposition MPs gave the ruling MMD a slim majority in Parliament.

Mwanawasa was re-elected in the 2006 general elections with 43% of the vote, with the MMD winning 72 seats in the National Assembly.

Following the sudden death of Mwanawasa in August 2008, a presidential by-election was held. Rupiah Banda was chosen as the MMD candidate, and was elected with 40% of the national vote, narrowly defeating Michael Sata of the Patriotic Front (PF) by a margin of around 2%.

===Opposition===
However, the 2011 general elections saw Sata defeat Banda by a margin of 42%–35%, whilst the MMD won only 55 seats in the National Assembly to the PF&#x27;s 60. The following year Nevers Mumba was elected as MMD president, defeating rival Felix Mutati and several other candidates.

=== 2015 presidential by-elections ===
In the 2015 presidential by-election former party president Mr. Rupiah Banda returned from political retirement and claimed that he would be the candidate of the Party in that by election, whilst the Party through the National Executive Committee (NEC) backed its party president Dr. Mumba. The Issue went to the Supreme Court and the Court ruled that Dr. Mumba as party president had the right to run for President on the Party ticket.

The judgement was passed two weeks before the election date and partially due to that the MMD with Dr. Mumba as its candidate received just about 0.9%.

=== 2016 illegal MMD convention ===
In May 2016, a group of former and expelled MMD members elected former Lunte MP Felix Mutati as party president at a convention at the Mulungushi Rock of Authority in Kabwe, whilst the Party continued supporting Nevers Mumba.

=== 2019 Judge Newa Judgement ===
On the 9th of November 2019, High Court Judge Sharon Newa sitting in Lusaka ruled that the Convention that elected Felix Mutati as Party President was illegal and all decisions made between then and that date was declared null and vold. It further ruled that Dr. Nevers Mumba was the MMD President and that Felix Mutati and Raphael Nakachinda remained expelled members of the MMD.

<text>This is a list of mayors of Raleigh since the creation of the office in 1857. The Mayor is the head of a council-manager system of government for Raleigh, North Carolina. The office was created in 1857 when a new charter was established for the city to replace the original 1795 charter. Mayor William H. Harrison was mayor during the Confederate States of America and eventually surrendered the city back to the United States before Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea arrived.

==Intendants of Police==
Under Raleigh&#x27;s original 1795 charter, the equivalent of a mayor was called the &quot;Intendant of Police&quot; (a title borrowed from France). The first person to hold the office was John Haywood. He was elected by the city board of commissioners (who were themselves appointed by the North Carolina General Assembly). Starting in 1803, intendants of police were elected annually by all land-owning free men, including free African-Americans.

<doc id="428815" wikidata="Q1351653" url="?curid=428815" title="Senegalese Democratic Party">
<text>The Senegalese Democratic Party () is a political party in Senegal. The party considers itself a liberal party and is a member of the Liberal International. Abdoulaye Wade, who was President of Senegal from 2000 to 2012, is the party&#x27;s leader. The PDS ruled together with smaller parties as part of the Sopi Coalition. Since Wade&#x27;s defeat in the 2012 presidential election, the PDS has been the main opposition party.

==History==
At a summit of the Organization of African Unity in Mogadishu in 1974, Wade told President Léopold Sédar Senghor that he wanted to start a new party, and Senghor agreed to this. The PDS was founded on 31 July 1974 and recognized on 8 August. In its first constitutive congress, held on 31 January – 1 February 1976, the PDS described itself as a party of labor, but soon afterwards a law was introduced according to which three parties were allowed in Senegal: a socialist party, a Marxist–Leninist party, and a liberal party. The first two categories were already taken, and the PDS assumed the role of a liberal party rather than be dissolved.

Abdoulaye Wade is the Secretary General of the PDS and has led the party since its foundation in 1974. The PDS joined the Liberal International at the latter&#x27;s Berlin Congress in 1980.

The PDS participated, along with the ruling Socialist Party, in a national unity government that was formed in 1991, but withdrew from it on October 20, 1992, saying that the Socialist Party had monopolized control of the government and marginalized the PDS. Wade ran against the Socialist incumbent, Abdou Diouf, in the February 1993 presidential election, but lost to Diouf, receiving 32% of the vote against Diouf&#x27;s 58%. In the subsequent May 1993 parliamentary election, the PDS won 27 out of 120 seats in the National Assembly. The PDS and the Socialist Party began discussing the formation of another government together, but this was aborted by the assassination of Constitutional Council vice-president Babacar Sèye on May 15; because the PDS had been critical of Sèye, they were suspected of responsibility for the killing. The PDS then joined the Bokk Sopi Senegaal opposition coalition, in which it remained until rejoining the government in March 1995.

Between 2005 and 2012 the PDS was associated with the international party network Alliance of Democrats. Within Senegal, the party has been part of the Patriotic Front for the Defence of the Republic since 2014 with And-Jëf/African Party for Democracy and Socialism.

After running alone in the 2012 election, the PDS contested the following elections as part of opposition alliances, Manko Wattu Sénégal in 2017 and Wallu Sénégal in 2022. The party succeeded in gradually increasing its parliamentary representation, up to 24 MPs in 2022, but didn&#x27;t prevent Macky Sall from forming a government after both elections.

== Election results ==

=== Presidential elections ===

Wade ran in every presidential election from 1978 to 2012, finally becoming elected President of Senegal in 2000 against incumbent President Abdou Diouf. Wade was reelected in the first round of the 2007 election, but went on to lose the 2012 election to former Prime Minister Macky Sall.

<text>Terrell Eldorado Owens (; born December 7, 1973), also known by his initials &quot;T.O.&quot;, is an American former professional football wide receiver who played 15 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). Regarded as one of the greatest wide receivers of all time, Owens ranks third in NFL history in career receiving yards and receiving touchdowns.

Owens played college football for the Chattanooga Mocs and was selected in the third round of the 1996 NFL draft by the San Francisco 49ers. He was a member of the team for seven seasons until he was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in 2004. Two years later, he signed with the Dallas Cowboys, where he spent three seasons. Owens NFL career concluded after one season each with the Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals. He later played for the Allen Wranglers of the Indoor Football League (IFL) in 2012 and last played professionally with Fan Controlled Football (FCF) in 2022.

A six-time Pro Bowl and five-time first-team All-Pro selection, Owens also created a significant amount of controversy during his professional career and attracted attention for his flamboyant touchdown celebrations. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Early life==
Owens was born to Marilyn Heard and her neighbor L.C. Russell in Alexander City, Alabama. At 10 years old, he discovered his father&#x27;s identity after liking his daughter, only to learn that she was his sister. He grew up with three other siblings and was raised by his mother and grandmother. He enjoyed watching football, especially his favorite player, Jerry Rice. However, Owens&#x27; grandmother initially forbade him from playing sports until high school. Owens attended Benjamin Russell High School, where he participated in football, baseball, track, and basketball. Owens did not start on his high school football team until his junior year, when one of his teammates missed a game due to illness.

==College career==
While enrolled at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Owens played basketball, football, and ran track. Owens played in the 1995 NCAA basketball tournament. He became a starter during his sophomore year. Owens caught 38 passes for 724 yards and eight touchdowns during his sophomore year, and 34 passes for 357 yards and three touchdowns during his junior year. Having gained respect in the NCAA, Owens faced double coverage more frequently during his senior year, and was limited to 43 receptions for 667 yards and one touchdown. Owens previously held the single-season receptions record at Chattanooga until it was broken in 2007 by Alonzo Nix. In his senior year, he anchored the school&#x27;s 4 × 100 relay team at the NCAA championship. He also participated in the Senior Bowl, a college all-star game played by college seniors, in preparation for the NFL Draft.

==Professional career==
===San Francisco 49ers===
Because he played his college football at UT-Chattanooga, an FCS school that did not have a winning season during his time there, Owens&#x27; visibility to NFL scouts was lessened, and he dropped to the third round of the 1996 NFL draft, where the San Francisco 49ers drafted him 89th overall. Owens played his first professional game against the New Orleans Saints, playing on special teams. He caught his first two passes against the Carolina Panthers in Week 4 on September 22, 1996, for a total of six yards. Owens caught his first touchdown on October 20 against the Cincinnati Bengals; a 45-yard pass from Steve Young. He finished his rookie season with 35 receptions for 520 yards and four touchdowns.

After the 49ers&#x27; top receiver Jerry Rice suffered a torn ACL early in the 1997 NFL season, Owens took Rice&#x27;s place in the lineup, beating out former 1st round pick J. J. Stokes for the job. He helped the 49ers win 13 games that season, finishing with 936 receiving yards and eight touchdowns. He scored his first postseason touchdown in a Divisional Round win over the Minnesota Vikings.

1998 saw Owens eclipse 1,000-yards for the first time in his career, catching 67 passes for 1,097 yards and 14 touchdowns. In the Wildcard playoff game, the 49ers faced the Green Bay Packers who had beaten them five straight times, three of them playoff games. Owens struggled, dropping a number of passes. Despite this, Young kept throwing to Owens and he redeemed himself by catching the game-winning touchdown (immortalized by the impassioned game call of 49ers radio play-by-play announcer Joe Starkey) for a 30–27 comeback victory.

In 1999, Owens&#x27;s production dropped after injury to Steve Young and Jeff Garcia was named the starting quarterback. He finished the season with 60 catches for 754 yards and four touchdowns.

Owens had a record-breaking day on December 17, 2000, with 20 catches for 283 yards in a 17–0 win over the Chicago Bears. His 20 receptions surpassed a 50-year-old mark held by Tom Fears (it has since been surpassed by Brandon Marshall). Owens finished the year with 97 receptions for 1,451 yards and thirteen touchdowns.

Owens had another strong season in 2001, finishing with 93 receptions for 1,412 yards and 16 touchdowns.

During the 2002 season, Owens had 100 receptions for 1,300 yards and 13 touchdowns. The 49ers hosted the New York Giants in the Wild Card playoff round and after falling behind 38–14, the 49ers scored 25 unanswered points. Owens accounted for two touchdown and caught two 2-point conversions in the 49ers&#x27; 39–38 win. The following week, Owens was held to four catches for 35 yards in a 31–6 to the soon-to-be Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

In 2003, Owens finished the season with 80 receptions for 1,102 yards and nine touchdowns. The 49ers finished with a 7–9 record in what would be Owens&#x27;s final season with the team.

In the summer of 2004, Owens appeared in an interview for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, where he was asked about long-standing rumors that his former teammate Garcia was homosexual, to which he implied he thought there might be truth to the rumors.

Although Owens was eager to leave the 49ers, the 49ers asserted that Owens&#x27; previous agent, David Joseph, had missed the deadline to void the final years of his contract with the team. The National Football League Players Association and Owens disputed this assertion, contending that the deadline referred to by the 49ers was not the applicable deadline. On March 4, 2004, San Francisco, believing it still held Owens&#x27; rights, attempted to trade Owens to the Baltimore Ravens for a second-round pick in the 2004 draft. However, Owens challenged the 49ers&#x27; right to make the deal. Owens assumed that he would become a free agent on March 3, and did not believe that the earlier deadline was applicable. Hence, he negotiated with other teams in advance of his expected free agency, and reached a contract agreement with the Philadelphia Eagles. The NFLPA filed a grievance on his behalf.

Before an arbitrator could make a ruling on Owens&#x27; grievance, the NFL and the three teams involved in the controversy reached a settlement on March 16, 2004. The Ravens got their second-round pick back from San Francisco, and the 49ers in turn received a conditional fifth-round pick and defensive end Brandon Whiting from the Eagles in exchange for the rights to Owens. Owens&#x27; contract with the Eagles was worth about $49 million for seven years, including a $10 million signing bonus.

===Philadelphia Eagles===

On December 19, 2004, Owens sustained a severely sprained ankle and a fractured fibula when Dallas Cowboys safety Roy Williams took him down with a horse-collar tackle; Williams&#x27; horse-collars resulted in injuries to several NFL players, and the horse-collar tackle was later prohibited. Owens&#x27; injury required surgery, including insertion of a screw into his leg, and Eagles trainer Rick Burkholder stated that he would miss the rest of the season, with only an outside chance of playing in the Super Bowl if the Eagles advanced.

After the Eagles defeated the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship game, Owens defied the advice of his doctors and played in Super Bowl XXXIX. Owens&#x27; trainer, James &quot;Buddy&quot; Primm, helped bring Owens back much sooner with the use of Microcurrent and a hyperbaric chamber. Owens started in the game and had nine receptions for 122 yards, but the Eagles lost to the New England Patriots. After the game, Owens stated that the media would have called Brett Favre &quot;a warrior&quot; for playing with such an injury, but that &quot;For me, they said I was selfish.&quot;

In April 2005, Owens announced that he had hired a new agent, Drew Rosenhaus, and indicated that he would seek to have his contract with the Eagles renegotiated. Owens made $9 million in 2004 (most of which was bonus money, as his base salary was only $660,000), and was slated to make $4.5 million in 2005. This two-year amount did not place Owens in the top ten paid wide receivers playing. He also made a comment that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t the guy who got tired in the Super Bowl.&quot; The remark, directed at quarterback Donovan McNabb, caused a controversy to heat up between them. On July 1, Owens&#x27; relationship with the Eagles became even more tense after Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie and club president Joe Banner denied Owens permission to play basketball in a summer league under the auspices of the National Basketball Association&#x27;s Sacramento Kings.

Owens, with the negotiating help of Rosenhaus, continued to lobby for a new contract. Owens and Rosenhaus met with Eagles head coach Andy Reid and president Joe Banner, but no agreement was reached (this was in line with the Eagles&#x27; policy against contract renegotiations). Owens threatened to hold out of training camp until a deal was reached, but reported to camp on time. When the 2005 football season began, Owens was in the second year of a seven-year, $49 million contract. However, the contract was heavily back-loaded, and while outlets like Sports Illustrated touted the $49 million figure to mock Owens for wanting more, the money guaranteed to him was under the annual average for a top-tier wide receiver.

Owens and McNabb, to their credit, did not appear to allow the off-the-field controversies to affect their play on the field during the first half of the season: through week 7 Owens was McNabb&#x27;s receiving target an average of 13.14 times per game (most in the NFL since 1999 when receiver “targets” were first tracked, and a still-current NFL record as of 2023), with Owens second only to Panthers WR Steve Smith Sr. in receiving touchdowns, receptions, and receiving yards at that point in 2005. McNabb was leading the NFL in several passing categories at that point.

However, after a game against the Dallas Cowboys on October 9 in which the Eagles lost, Owens was seen by reporters wearing a throwback jersey of former Cowboys player Michael Irvin on the team plane. On November 2, Owens was involved in an argument in the training room with team ambassador Hugh Douglas, which led to a fistfight between the two. The argument was reportedly started after Douglas said there were players on the team who were faking injuries.

During an interview with college student journalist Graham Bensinger the next day, Owens made several comments that Eagles fans perceived as verbal jabs at McNabb and the team. In this interview, when asked whether he agreed with a comment made by analyst Michael Irvin saying that the Eagles would be undefeated if Brett Favre was on the team, Owens replied, &quot;That&#x27;s a good assessment. I would agree with that.&quot; Owens went on to state that if Favre were the Eagles quarterback, &quot;I just feel like we&#x27;d be in a better situation.&quot; Owens stated on his radio show that his remarks were taken out of context, noting that he had just stated two questions prior that the Eagles&#x27; record would also be better had McNabb not been injured. While he did not comment on Owens&#x27; slight at the time, McNabb later stated in an interview that &quot;It was definitely a slap in the face to me.&quot;

Two days after the interview aired, the Eagles suspended Owens indefinitely for &quot;conduct detrimental to the team&quot;. According to Owens&#x27; agent Drew Rosenhaus, head coach Andy Reid demanded that Owens make a public apology to McNabb. An apology was drafted by Rosenhaus, but Owens balked at reading a specific apology to McNabb, and crossed that part of the statement out. The apology he read on TV did not address McNabb directly. The following day, Reid announced that Owens&#x27; suspension would be increased to four games and that he would be deactivated for the remainder of the season.

On November 8, Owens and Rosenhaus held a news conference at Owens&#x27; residence, where he apologized to the fans, the team, and McNabb specifically, and also made an appeal for reinstatement to the team. The NFL Players Association filed a grievance against the Eagles, claiming violation of the sport&#x27;s collective bargaining agreement, but Owens&#x27; suspension and deactivation were upheld by an arbitrator.

On March 14, 2006, the Philadelphia Eagles released Owens.

===Dallas Cowboys===
On March 18, 2006, the Dallas Cowboys signed Owens to a 3-year, $25 million deal, including a $5 million signing bonus, with a $5 million first-year salary.

Owens returned to the field during the Cowboys&#x27; 2006 season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars. While the game ended in a Jaguars victory, Owens recorded eight receptions for 80 yards and one touchdown. The following week against the Redskins, Owens broke his finger while blocking, and was forced to leave the game. He had a plate screwed into the finger, and returned to play the team&#x27;s next game against the Tennessee Titans, where he accounted for 88 receiving yards.

The following week, Owens made his highly anticipated return to Philadelphia, where he played against his former teammate, Donovan McNabb. Upon his return, Owens was met by a hail of angry jeers and taunts, including chants of &quot;O.D.&quot; throughout the game. Despite pregame talk about a weak Eagles secondary, Owens struggled throughout the game. Owens had three catches for 45 yards, while the Cowboys went on to lose, 38–24.

After the Cowboys defeated the Atlanta Falcons, 38–28, owner Jerry Jones revealed that Owens had injured a tendon on the same finger that he had broken earlier in the season. The doctors recommended season-ending surgery, but Owens elected to risk permanent damage to his finger and decided to wait until the end of the season to repair the damage. &quot;There&#x27;s no question about what he&#x27;s willing to do for his team&quot;, Jones said.

Owens led the league in regular season with 13 touchdown receptions. On March 1, 2007, he underwent surgery twice to repair his right ring finger.

In the 2007 season, Owens and the Cowboys began to live up to their potential. On November 18, Owens set a new career high and tied a franchise record, with four touchdown catches against the Washington Redskins. With his touchdown catch against Green Bay on November 29, Owens became the first player in NFL history with at least one touchdown catch and six receptions in seven straight games. Also with this win, the Cowboys clinched a playoff berth for the second consecutive season, making this the third time Owens would participate in back-to-back postseasons. Owens was one of the starting wide receivers to represent the NFC in the Pro Bowl along with Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald. On January 9, Owens made the All-Pro team along with teammates Jason Witten and DeMarcus Ware. On December 22 in a Week 16 game against the Carolina Panthers, Owens caught his 15th touchdown catch of the season to set a new Cowboys record for touchdown catches in a season. During this game, however, Owens suffered a high ankle sprain after making a catch in the second quarter, which kept him out of the rest of the regular season. Owens was leading the league in receiving yards and was second in receiving touchdowns at the time. He finished the season with 81 receptions, 15 touchdowns, and 1,355 receiving yards, as the team finished 13–3 and clinched the NFC&#x27;s top seed.

Owens returned for the divisional playoff game against the Giants, where he caught four passes for 49 yards and a touchdown. The Cowboys lost the game, however, 21–17 and Owens broke down crying during the postgame press conference in a now-infamous incident.

In the 2008 Pro Bowl, Owens caught seven passes for 101 yards and two touchdowns in an NFC win. Despite his efforts, Minnesota Vikings rookie running back Adrian Peterson was named MVP.

In the Cowboys&#x27; second game of the season, the last Monday Night game at Texas Stadium, Owens passed Cris Carter to move to second in touchdowns behind former teammate Jerry Rice.

The Cowboys released Owens on March 4, 2009. Owens later said that Jones had assured him that he would be remaining with the team and that he was blindsided by his release.

===Buffalo Bills===
On March 8, 2009, the Buffalo Bills signed Owens to a 1-year, $6.5 million contract. Owens had his first catch with the Bills when he had a 27-yard play on a 3rd-and-1 in the 25–24 loss to the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium. With that catch, he passed former Bills receiver Andre Reed on the all-time Top 20 career leaders list for pass receptions. Owens debuted with two catches for 45 yards in the game. Owens caught his first touchdown pass with Buffalo in a 33–20 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on September 20, 2009. However, the following week, Owens was held without a catch against the New Orleans Saints, ending a 185-game streak of consecutive games with a catch that was the longest streak among active players at the time.

Owens had his best game with the Bills in a 15–18 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, with nine receptions for 197 yards and a touchdown. Owens and Ryan Fitzpatrick set a Bills record for longest touchdown reception when Fitzpatrick connected with Owens for a 98-yard touchdown, which also became Owens&#x27; longest career touchdown reception. He also became the oldest player to have a touchdown reception of more than 76 yards (35 years, 350 days). Against the Atlanta Falcons in week 16, Owens became the sixth player to reach 1,000 receptions in a career after catching an 8-yard pass from Brian Brohm. He finished his lone season with Buffalo with 55 catches for 829 yards and 5 receiving touchdowns, and also rushed 6 times for 54 yards and a touchdown.

===Cincinnati Bengals===

On July 27, 2010, Owens signed a one-year contract with the Cincinnati Bengals. It was reportedly worth $2 million, with another $2 million possible from bonuses. He joined Carson Palmer and Chad Johnson, both of whom lobbied for the Bengals to sign Owens. With the retirement of Isaac Bruce, Owens spent his last active season in the NFL as the active career leader in receiving yards. He received his customary number, #81, given to him by free-agent acquisition wide receiver Antonio Bryant in exchange for an undisclosed sum of money, some of which went to a charity of Bryant&#x27;s choice. He was ranked 91st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.

Against the Cleveland Browns in Week4, he had a spectacular game with ten receptions, 222 yards and a touchdown of 78 yards. On December 21, Owens was placed on injured reserve, for the first time in his 15-year career. He still managed to lead all Bengals&#x27; receivers (including Ochocinco) with receptions (72), yards (983), and touchdowns (9) for the season. However, the Bengals fell from a 10–6 record the year before Owens joined to a 4–12 record with Owens. The Bengals decided not to re-sign Owens for the 2011 season.

He suffered a torn ACL during the 2011 offseason and underwent surgery in April 2011. According to his agent, he was cleared to play again on October 19. He held a televised workout on October 25, which no NFL teams chose to attend.

===Allen Wranglers===
On November 2, 2011, the Allen Wranglers of the Indoor Football League announced they had extended a six-figure contract offer to Owens to play for the Wranglers in the 2012 season. On January 18, 2012, Owens announced via Twitter that he had accepted the Wranglers&#x27; offer and joined their ownership group, with an official press conference to follow the following week. In his debut for the Wranglers, Owens caught three passes for 53 yards and three touchdowns as the Wranglers defeated the Wichita Wild 50–30. His statistics were: eight games played; 35 catches; 420 yards; 52.5 yards per game; 12 yards per catch; 45 longest catch; and ten touchdowns.

On May 29, 2012, Owens was released. The Wranglers&#x27; co-owners stated Owens was released for showing a lack of effort both on and off the field.

===Seattle Seahawks===
On August 6, 2012, Owens signed a one-year, $925,000 contract with the Seattle Seahawks. On August 26, 2012, Owens announced on his Twitter account that the Seahawks had released him.

On January 13, 2015, in an interview with&quot; Sports Illustrated Now&quot;, Owens stated that he had not retired and that, after a hiatus, he had trained with numerous NFL players during the 2014 NFL season and the offseason. He did not state when he planned to return to the NFL.

===Flag football===
On June 28, 2017, Owens played as team captain for Team Owens in the inaugural game for the newly formed American Flag Football League.

===Canadian Football League===
On June 19, 2018, the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League (CFL) added Owens to their negotiation list. On July 14, Owens activated his 10-day signing window with the Eskimos, requiring the team to offer him a contract in ten days, else he would&#x27;ve become a CFL free agent and be eligible to sign with any of the eight other CFL teams. On July 20, 2018, the Eskimos dropped Owens from their negotiation list. On August 5, 2018, a day after his Hall of Fame induction, Owens worked out for the Saskatchewan Roughriders.

=== Fan Controlled Football ===
On March 31, 2022, Owens signed with Fan Controlled Football. Though FCF players typically rotate through multiple teams in a season, Owens was expected to be given a franchise tag by the Zappers (one of two Zappers franchise players, along with quarterback Johnny Manziel) committing Owens to that team. On May 11, 2022, Owens was traded to the Knights of Degen in a three-team, four-player trade.

On December 28, 2022, it was announced that Owens was in contact with the Dallas Cowboys, as well as other teams, regarding a possible NFL return. However, no deal was reached with Dallas, or any other team.

==Personal life==
Owens is the father of two daughters and two sons. In September 2011, Owens was sued by Melanie Paige Smith III, the mother of his daughter, for failure to pay child support, but the case was settled prior to trial. Owens insisted that the reason for the missed child support payments was due to his wages decreasing in the NFL and Smith was aware of his circumstances.

His daughter Kylee plays volleyball at Prairie View A&amp;M University. His son, Terique, is a wide receiver for Owens&#x27; old team, the San Francisco 49ers, and was signed by them after previously going undrafted in the 2024 NFL draft.

In September 2004, Owens released an autobiography: &quot;Catch This! Going Deep with the NFL&#x27;s Sharpest Weapon&quot;, which he co-wrote with bestselling author Stephen Singular.

On a May 8, 2012, episode of &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;, three of the four mothers to his children accused Owens of either coming up short in his monthly child support payments or not paying at all. Owens said he was paying some $45,000 per month in child support at one time.

Owens is a Christian. He was raised as a Christian by his grandmother and has been baptized.

On October 16, 2023, Owens was hit by a car in Calabasas, California, after being in an argument following a pick-up basketball game. Owens was not injured.

==Controversies==

===&quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; skit===
On November 15, 2004, Owens, wearing a Philadelphia Eagles uniform, appeared with television actress Nicollette Sheridan (of the ABC series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; in character as Edie Britt) in an introductory skit which opened that evening&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; telecast, in which Owens and the Eagles played the Cowboys at Texas Stadium. Some observers (especially then-Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy) condemned the skit as being sexually suggestive because of Sheridan removing a towel, and ABC later apologized for airing it. However, on March 14, 2005, the Federal Communications Commission ruled that the skit did not violate decency standards, because it contained no outright nudity or foul language.

===2006 Hydrocodone overdose===
Some media outlets in Dallas reported on the morning of September 27, 2006, that Owens had tried to kill himself by intentionally ingesting an overdose of hydrocodone, a pain medication. A police report filed on the night of September 26 seemed to confirm the attempt, saying that Owens&#x27;s publicist, Kim Etheredge, found him unresponsive with an empty bottle of pain killers, pried two pills from his mouth, and called 9-1-1, after which an ambulance transported him four blocks from his Deep Ellum condo to Baylor University Medical Center.

According to the police report, Owens and Etheredge both said he was depressed, and Owens answered &quot;yes&quot; when asked whether he had intended to harm himself. Owens&#x27; publicist, however, refuted the report, stating that Owens had suffered an allergic reaction to the medication combined with a dietary supplement. ESPN reported that about half the police report was blacked out, but included the phrases &quot;attempting suicide by prescription pain medication&quot; and &quot;a drug overdose&quot;.

Owens left the hospital later on September 27. At a news conference after his release, Owens denied having made a suicide attempt, stating that he expected to join the team for practice the next morning. He stated that he was &quot;not depressed&quot; and was &quot;very happy to be here&quot;, and denied that doctors had pumped his stomach, calling speculation to that effect &quot;definitely untrue&quot;. The press conference took place after Owens had run routes and caught passes with the Cowboys at the team&#x27;s practice facility in Valley Ranch.

Afterwards, Owens&#x27; publicist stated that she felt the police had taken advantage of Owens. The president of the union representing Dallas police officers subsequently demanded an apology from Owens and his publicist for her comments, which he said damaged the reputations of three patrolmen. On Thursday, September 28, the Dallas Police Department reported the incident to be an &quot;accidental overdose&quot; and ended their investigation.

The pain medication Owens had ingested had been prescribed to him for a broken finger he had suffered in a Week2 victory against the Washington Redskins. Bill Parcells had noted in a press conference a few days before the incident that the medication Owens had been taking had made him sick, and he had been prescribed a milder pain killer.

===Spitting incident===
After the December 16, 2006, game against the Atlanta Falcons, Falcons cornerback DeAngelo Hall stated that Owens spat in his face after a play early in the game. Game officials and reporters were unaware of the incident and Owens was not asked about it until his post-game interview with the NFL Network, when he confirmed it. Owens said, &quot;I got frustrated and I apologize for that. It was a situation where he kept hugging me and getting in my face. He had a lot of words, I didn&#x27;t. I just wanted to come and prove I&#x27;m not a guy to be schemed with.&quot; Hall said that he lost all respect for Owens. When made aware that Hall was saying Owens did it deliberately, Owens said that it was an accident that occurred while they were in each other&#x27;s face, talking trash. Despite no video evidence, the NFL fined Owens $35,000 for the incident. After initially refusing to take a phone call from Owens, Hall was convinced by Deion Sanders to speak with Owens two days after the incident and later stated that they &quot;cleared it all out&quot;.

===Hall of Fame===
Owens was not voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first two years of eligibility, despite being statistically ranked near the top of every NFL receiving category. Commentators attributed Owens&#x27; exclusion to his issues off the field.

In 2018, Owens was voted into the Hall of Fame. He subsequently caused controversy in his induction by skipping the official celebration in Canton, Ohio, and instead choosing to host his own celebration in McKenzie Arena on the campus of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, his alma mater. Owens is the only inductee of the hall to skip his induction and instead host a separate induction ceremony.

==Touchdown celebrations==
During his playing career, Owens attracted attention for his flamboyant celebrations after scoring touchdowns, some of which resulted in fines from the NFL front office.

===Celebrations for San Francisco===

*On September 24, 2000, in Dallas, Owens twice sprinted to midfield after scoring touchdowns and stood on the Dallas Cowboys&#x27; star logo. The second time, Cowboys safety George Teague leveled him at midfield, which started a confrontation between the two teams. Teague was ejected from the game, while Owens was suspended for a week by head coach Steve Mariucci.
*During a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game against the Seattle Seahawks on October 14, 2002, Owens pulled a Sharpie marker out of his sock to sign the football he caught to score a touchdown, and then gave the ball to his financial adviser, who happened to also be the financial adviser of Shawn Springs, who was covering Owens on the play. He was criticized by Seahawks head coach Mike Holmgren for the stunt, but was not punished by the 49ers or the NFL. However, in the wake of the highly publicized incident, the league immediately adopted a new rule banning players from carrying &quot;foreign objects&quot; with them on the field.

===Celebrations for Philadelphia===

*The &quot;Bird Dance&quot;, &quot;The Bird&quot;, or &quot;Wing Flap&quot; became T.O.&#x27;s trademark dance with the Eagles. T.O. did the &quot;Bird Dance&quot; frequently during the 2004 season after a big play or touchdown. His touchdown celebration was mocked by Hines Ward in the Eagles&#x27; first loss of the season at Pittsburgh. After scoring on a reverse, Ward flexed and began flapping his arms like a bird.
*Owens imitated and mocked the trademark pre-game ritual dance of Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis after scoring a touchdown while playing against the Ravens in the 2004 season.

===Celebrations for Dallas===

*On the Thanksgiving Day game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 23, 2006, Owens, after catching a pass for a touchdown, dropped the ball in an oversized Salvation Army Red Kettle, donating the ball to the Salvation Army. About the touchdown celebration, Owens was quoted as saying, &quot;That was my donation. I hope it&#x27;s worth as much as the fine.&quot;
*On September 16, 2007, Owens mocked Bill Belichick after catching a touchdown against the Miami Dolphins, by hiding behind a field goal post and holding the football to his face in a video camera fashion, as if secretly spying and filming the game. The Cowboys were penalized 15 yards for &quot;excessive celebration&quot;. On September 19, 2007, the league fined Owens $7,500 for the celebration.
*On November 4, 2007, against his former team, the Philadelphia Eagles, Owens flapped his wings, mimicking the dance he did while with the Eagles. This, coupled with Owens&#x27; tumultuous stay with the Eagles and his subsequent tenure with the Cowboys (an Eagles division rival), earned the boos of the crowd. After the game, Owens was quoted as saying, &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of love in those boos.&quot;

==Other work==

Owens is depicted in a photographic work by contemporary African-American artist Hank Willis Thomas entitled &quot;Liberation of T.O.: Ain&#x27;t no way I&#x27;m go&#x27;n in back ta&#x27;work fa&#x27;massa in dat darn field&quot; (2004). The work was featured in &quot;Frequency&quot;, the Studio Museum in Harlem&#x27;s 2006 exhibition of emerging artists.

Owens rapped in a single titled &quot;I&#x27;m Back&quot;, available for download on his website.

Outside of his football career, Owens also appeared in various commercials, television shows, and films. Owens played himself, as a wide receiver wearing #82 for the fictional Miami Sharks, in the 1999 film &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;. In 2003, he appeared in a commercial for the ESPY Awards where he caught a home run ball from Barry Bonds in McCovey Cove. Owens appeared in an episode of &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;, starring Ashton Kutcher, which is based on his November 19, 2005, suspension.

In August 2008, Owens was featured in the pilot episode of the web series FACETIME, on My Damn Channel. He and Three 6 Mafia interview each other in the episode.

He starred in a summer 2009 reality show on VH1, dubbed &quot;The T.O. Show&quot;; the show followed Owens and his &quot;best friends and publicists&quot; as they re-evaluated Owens&#x27; personal life.

Owens appeared in the NBA All-Star celebrity game again in 2009 scoring 17 points including two alley-oops, to secure his second consecutive MVP award.

In June 2009, Owens starred in ABC&#x27;s reincarnation of &quot;Superstars&quot;, a sports competition show from the 70s where celebrities are paired with professional athletes. The first episode is rumored to have ended in controversy, as evidenced by a leaked clip of partner supermodel Joanna Krupa calling Owens a &quot;prima donna&quot;.

As a one-time rating sweeps week stunt, Owens replaced WKBW-TV sports anchor Jeff Russo for their 6:00p.m. newscast on May 18, 2009.

On May 8, 2012, Owens appeared on &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; with the mothers of three of his children to discuss relationships.

In 2013, NBC Sports reported that Owens has become a model.

In 2014, Owens made a cameo appearance in R&amp;B singer Faith Evans&#x27; music video &quot;I Deserve It&quot;, featuring Missy Elliott and Sharaya J.

In 2015 Owens participated in &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice 7&quot;, finishing in 12th place.

On September 5, 2017, Owens was announced as one of the celebrities set to compete on season 25 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. He was partnered with professional dancer Cheryl Burke and was the eighth contestant eliminated.

In 2017, Owens competed on the special for the MTV reality series &quot;The Challenge&quot; titled &quot;Champs vs. Stars&quot;.

In May 2018, it was announced that Owens would be featured on the cover of the &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; edition of &quot;Madden NFL 19&quot;.

An avid bowler, Owens has twice won Chris Paul&#x27;s CP3 PBA Celebrity Invitational, an annual televised event in which celebrities and PBA Tour professionals team up to benefit the Chris Paul Family Foundation. Owens won in 2016 with Pete Weber, and again in 2021 with AJ Johnson. Owens has also won the Celebrity Clash at this event twice, in 2018 and 2021.

===&quot;The T.O. Show&quot;===
In the summer of 2009, VH1 premiered &quot;The T.O. Show&quot;, which followed Owens in his personal life off the football field. The show was renewed for two additional seasons.

===&quot;Time Out with T.O.&quot;===

In September 2013, Owens launched a podcast on the Sideshow Network with co-hosts comedian Alonzo Bodden and former-&quot;Survivor&quot; contestant and podcast host, Rob Cesternino. Shows are released each Wednesday and the discussion centers on the week&#x27;s NFL games and news. Comedian Roy Wood, Jr. has been a regular guest.

Guests have been from both the sports and the entertainment worlds. Some of them were: Ron Artest, Ray J, comic Sam Tripoli, and writer Caleb Bacon.
