<text>Gleaning is the act of collecting leftover crops in the field after harvest. During harvest, there is food that is left or missed often because it does not meet store standards for uniformity. Sometimes, fields are left because they were not economically profitable to harvest. In modern times, gleaning is used to provide fresh foods to those in need. &quot;Dumpster diving&quot;, when done for food or culinary ingredients, is seen as a similar form of food recovery. There are multiple organizations that support gleaning, including the Gleaning Network in the UK, and the National Gleaning Project in the United States. Both organizations have worked on national networks to connect modern gleaning and food recovery organizations.
== History ==
The term &quot;glean&quot; was first used in English in the 14th Century, and meant both &quot;to gather grain or other produce left by reapers&quot; and &quot;to gather information or material bit by bit&quot;. It has roots in Middle English (&quot;glenen),&quot; Anglo-French (&quot;glener&quot;), and Late Latin (&quot;glen(n)ō&quot; (“make a collection). Gleaning is referred to throughout history, including biblical references in the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Gleaning has long been a part of agricultural calendar and process, and was practiced widely by the rural poor during the 16th and 17th Centuries. Additionally, as much as one-eight of labour-based households&#x27; annual earnings came from gleaning in the 18th and 19th Centuries. Technology of the mid-19th Century would heavily reduce gleaning globally. 

=== In the Bible ===
According to the books of Deuteronomy and Leviticus, farmers should leave the edges of their fields unharvested (pe&#x27;ah), should not pick up that which was dropped (gleanings), and should not harvest any overlooked produce that had been forgotten when they harvested the majority of a field. On one of the two occasions that this is stated in Leviticus, it adds that in vineyards, some grapes should be left ungathered, a statement also found in Deuteronomy.

These verses additionally command that olive trees should not be beaten on multiple occasions, and whatever remains from the first set of beatings should be left. According to Leviticus, these things should be left for the poor and for strangers, and Deuteronomy commands that it should be left for widows, strangers, and paternal orphans. The Book of Ruth tells of gleaning by the widow Ruth to provide for herself and her mother-in-law, Naomi, who was also a widow.

=== Rabbinical view ===
In classical rabbinic literature, it was argued that the biblical regulations concerning left-overs only applied to grain fields, orchards, and vineyards. The farmer was not permitted to benefit from the gleanings, and was not permitted to discriminate among the poor, nor try to frighten them away with dogs or lions; the farmer was not even allowed to help one of the poor to gather the left-overs. However, it was also argued that the law was only applicable in Canaan, although many classical rabbinic writers, who were based in Babylon, applied the laws there too; it was also seen as only applying to Jewish paupers, but poor gentiles were allowed to benefit for the sake of civil peace.

=== Historic European practice ===

In many parts of Europe, including England and France, the Biblically derived right to glean the fields was reserved for the poor; a right, enforceable by law, that continued in parts of Europe into modern times.

In 18th century England, gleaning was a legal right for &quot;cottagers&quot;, or landless residents. In a small village the sexton would often ring a church bell at eight o&#x27;clock in the morning and again at seven in the evening to tell the gleaners when to begin and end work. This legal right effectively ended after the &quot;Steel v Houghton&quot; decision in 1788.

==Modern times==
Gleaning events occur wherever food is in excess. In addition to supermarkets, gleaning can also occur at farms in the field. Volunteers, called gleaners, visit a farm where the farmer donates what is left in their fields to collect and donate to a food bank. In New York State in 2010, this form of gleaning alone rescued 3.6 million pounds of fruits and vegetables.

When people glean and distribute food, they do so at their peril; in the Soviet Union, the Law of Spikelets (sometimes translated &quot;law on gleaning&quot;) criminalised gleaning, under penalty of death, or 10 years of forced labour in exceptional circumstances. In the U.S., the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act of 1996 limited the liability of donors to instances of gross negligence or intentional misconduct, alleviating gleaning from much of the risk that was allegedly hampering the delivery of surplus food from restaurants and dining facilities to emergency food centers. The law preempts state Good Samaritan Acts, that provide less protection.

The Shulchan Aruch argues that Jewish farmers are no longer obliged to obey the biblical rule. Nevertheless, in modern Israel, rabbis of Orthodox Judaism insist that Jews allow &quot;gleanings&quot; to be consumed by the poor and by strangers during Sabbatical years. On the island of Bali, traditional law allows fruit from a tree to be picked by the passerby from the ground—even if the tree is on privately owned land.

Currently, gleaning is often practiced by humanitarian and social groups which distribute the gleaned food to the poor and hungry; in a modern context, this can include the collection of food from supermarkets at the end of the day that would otherwise be thrown away. There are a number of organizations that practice gleaning to resolve issues of societal hunger; the Society of St. Andrew and the Boston Area Gleaners, for example.

In the United States there are also laws that support and sanction gleaning and the National Gleaning Project, created by the Center for Agriculture and Food Systems at Vermont Law and Graduate School connected modern gleaning and food recovery organizations across the United States while providing related policy and law resources, and examples of handbooks, waivers, and other documents organizations may utilize. These laws allow corporations to receive grants for the use of gleaning, mandates the agriculture sector to financially sustain gleaning nationally, and sanctions the distribution of the vegetables harvested from gleaning. In 2020, there were 143 gleaning organizations in the United States and Canada combined, harvesting anywhere from 163,000-5.2 million pounds of food gleaned in the year.

==Gleaning in art==
Gleaning was a popular subject in art, especially in the nineteenth century. Gleaning in rural France has been represented in the paintings &quot;Des Glaneuses&quot; (1857) by Jean-François Millet and &quot;Le rappel des glaneuses&quot; (1859) by Jules Breton, and explored in a 2000 documentary/experimental film, &quot;The Gleaners and I&quot;, by Agnès Varda. Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s sketch of a &quot;Peasant Woman Gleaning&quot; in Nuenen, The Netherlands (1885) is in the Charles Clore collection.

==Woolgathering==


Woolgathering is a practice similar to gleaning, but for wool. The practice was of collecting bits of wool that had gotten caught on bushes and fences or fallen on the ground as sheep passed by. The meandering perambulations of a woolgatherer give rise to the idiomatic sense of the word as meaning aimless wandering of the mind.

==Fishing==
Along marine coastlines, gleaning has been defined as &quot;fishing with basic gear, including bare hands, in shallow water not deeper than that one can stand&quot;. Invertebrate gleaning (walking) fisheries are common within coastal (intertidal) ecosystems globally, contributing to the food supply of coastal communities. 

==Ecological gleaning==
The term gleaning is also applied to modes of feeding which involve taking food from surfaces. For example, in Australia pardalotes (small songbirds) are renowned for their feeding on lerps, scale insects on &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; sp. leaves.

Many fish forage by picking off small food items from hard surfaces, another example of ecological gleaning.

<doc id="433130" wikidata="Q7438921" url="?curid=433130" title="Screamin' Sirens">
<text>Screamin&#x27; Sirens was an American all-female band from Hollywood, California that recorded from 1983 to 1987. The band combined country music, punk rock, rockabilly and a dash of funk to create an eclectic wild party music. Screamin&#x27; Sirens predated what is usually referred to as alternative country, but influenced that subgenre&#x27;s development.

==History==
:Formation
Screamin&#x27; Sirens were formed in Hollywood, California in around 1983. The band was formed by drummer/vocalist Boom Boom Laffoon and vocalist Pleasant Gehman, who recalled in a 1986 &quot;Flipside&quot; interview:

I just wanted to have a really wild all-girl band that was like a gang or something. And Boom Boom was the only drummer I could think of so even though we hated each other I wound up calling her anyway. We had all the same ideas about bands and life and drinking and everything.

Laffoon brought in, &quot;the best girl guitarist and vocalist I ever met,&quot; Rosie Flores. Boom Boom and Rosie previously played together in Keith Joe Dick and the Goners (with cowboy punk legend Gary Dixon as lead guitarist/songwriter. After going through two bassists who quickly left, Rosie answered the band&#x27;s ad in the Hollywood Times and tried out for the band in October 1980.XX .. Then the band added guitarist Rosie Flores, namesake of the band Rosie and the Screamers, with whom Laffoon was acquainted from her time with Keith Joe Dick and the Goners. The trio added bassist Laura Bandit, a veteran of the minor punk bands One Doesn&#x27;t Swallow and Hard as Nails, Cheap as Dirt. A fifth member of the group, Marsky Reins, played fiddle in addition to guitar, helping the band to achieve a signature punked up country and western sound.

Sporting cowboy boots and western skirts, the band delivered a high energy live show. &quot;A lot of people tell us we&#x27;ve got more balls than any girl band they&#x27;ve seen because we get real wild onstage,&quot; Pleasant Gehman noted. &quot;We&#x27;re not into wimpiness at all.&quot;

The band portrayed The She-Devils in Max Tash&#x27;s film &quot;The Runnin&#x27; Kind&quot;, which took its name from a song written by sister and brother Diane Boom Boom Dixon and Gary Dixon (Fur Dixon&#x27;s husband).

:Lineup changes
The band had several lineup changes over the course of their existence, adding Miiko Watanabe on bass as well as former Pandoras drummer Casey Gomez.

:Later bands
Original drummer and songwriter Diane &#x27;Boom Boom&#x27; Dixon went on to play with the Baloney Heads and the Real Dixons in Austin, Texas. Pleasant Gehman became a writer and editor, professional dancer and a member of the Ringling Sisters. Rosie Flores went on to have a successful solo career in the alternative country and rockabilly scene. Genny Schorr, the original guitar player, was also in the original line-up of all girl band Backstage Pass and was involved in The Masque. She later owned Rock clothing store Strait Jacket with Elvis Costello&#x27;s manager Jake Riviera. She was associated with bands such as The Bangles as Stylist. Miiko Watanabe went on to play with American Girls. Fur Dixon went on to play in The Cramps, The Dixons, Fur Dixon and Blow Up, Fur Dixon and Steve Werner, and a new band she formed in 2015, WTFUKUSHIMA!

<doc id="433135" wikidata="Q639686" url="?curid=433135" title="Baseball cap">
<text>A baseball cap is a type of soft hat with a rounded crown and a stiff bill projecting in front.

The front of the hat typically displays a design or a logo (historically, usually only a sports team, namely a baseball team, or names of relevant companies, when used as a commercial marketing technique). The hat may be &quot;fitted&quot; to the wearer&#x27;s head or the back may have elastic, a plastic prong-in-a-hole (multiple holes with one prong that can be inserted), Velcro, a zipper, or a tri-glide slide so that it can be quickly adjusted to fit different wearers&#x27; heads. The baseball hat is a part of the traditional baseball uniform worn by players, with the brim pointing forward to shield the eyes from the sun. Since the 1980s, varieties of the hat have become prevalent in the United States and many other nations, both for utilitarian (protecting the eyes from the sun) and fashion accessory purposes.

== History ==

In 1860, the Brooklyn Excelsiors wore the ancestor of the modern rounded-top baseball cap, which featured a long peak and a button on top, and by 1900, the &quot;Brooklyn-style&quot; cap became popular. The merino cap topped with a star-like pattern was made by the New York sporting goods company Peck &amp; Snyder.

In the late 1880s, a pillbox version of the cap became popular, which would morph into the modern six-paneled round cap; five teams revived the pillbox form in 1976 in celebration of the US Bicentennial. Team monograms first appeared in 1894 when the Boston Baseball Club (the Boston Braves) — now the Atlanta Braves — became the first team to wear letterforms when they added a monogram-style device to their caps, followed by three more teams in the next season. The Detroit Tigers of 1901 were the first major league team to have a mascot — a red tiger on a dark background — on their ballcap. It was replaced by the letter &quot;D&quot; in 1903, and their iconic blackletter letterform appeared a year later.

During the 1940s, latex rubber became the stiffening material inside the hat and the modern baseball cap was born. The peak, also known in certain areas as the &quot;bill&quot; or &quot;brim&quot;, was designed to protect a player&#x27;s eyes from the sun. Typically, the peak was much shorter in the earlier days of the baseball hat. Also, the hat has become more structured, versus the overall &quot;floppy&quot; cap of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The baseball cap was and still is an important means by which to identify a team. Often the logo, mascot, or team&#x27;s initial was placed on the cap. Usually, the cap was also fashioned in the official colors of a particular team.

Since 1993, the New Era Cap Company of Buffalo, N.Y. has been the exclusive baseball cap supplier for Major League Baseball.

The basic shape, including curved peak, is similar to some styles of 19th-century sunbonnets.

== Design ==

Fitted baseball hats — those without an adjuster — are normally sewn in six sections, and may be topped with a matching fabric-covered button (also called a squatchee) on the crown. Metal grommets or fabric eyelets are often sewn or attached near the top of each of the six sections of fabric to provide ventilation. In some cases, the rear sections of the crown are made of net-like mesh material for extra ventilation. The peak is typically stiffened by a sewn-in piece of paperboard or stiff plastic.

=== Variations ===
Baseball hats are made of many types of material and shaped in various styles for different purposes. Major and minor league baseball players wear classic-style hats made of wool (or more recently, polyester) with their team&#x27;s simple logo and colors; the logo is usually embroidered into the fabric. More recently there are brands that are using uncommon materials for snapback hats as for example wood brims.

Formerly, baseball hats only came in standard hat sizes. Since the early 1970s, they have also been available in a one-size-fits-all form, with an adjustment strap in the back. The style, commonly called snapback, has become increasingly popular as a fashion accessory, as have team caps, popularized especially by rap and hip-hop musicians. Advances in textiles have led to the &quot;stretch-fit&quot; hat, which uses Lycra or rubber to allow a hat to have a fitted style while still being &quot;adjustable&quot; within sizes.

The front may be soft, or may be stiffened by buckram to display a logo more clearly.

Another version of the baseball hat is a plastic mesh hat with a foam front imprinted with a company logo. This style is sometimes called a trucker hat or a &quot;gimme hat&quot; because it is given away for free as a promotional item.

There are 4 major types of baseball hats:

# Snapback hat – (hat with a snap closure in the rear) with flat brim, high profile, adjustable.
# Adjustable hat – (hat with a velcro closure or buckled strap in the rear) unstructured, low profile, curved brim, adjustable.
#&quot;Flexfit&quot; hat – curved or flat brim, structured cap, high profile, adjustable by the use of elastic materials.
# Fitted hat – curved or flat brim, structured cap, high profile, unadjustable.

== Athletic use ==

In 2014, the MLB began allowing pitchers to wear a special reinforced hat to protect their heads from line drives.

Athletes in other sports wear hats with their team&#x27;s logo and colors as &quot;sideline&quot; hats; both types are also sold as authentic team merchandise in retail stores. Other hats may simply have a maker&#x27;s logo, such as Reebok, Nike or Carhartt; these hats are often made of brushed cotton. Golfers sometime wear a sports visor form which does not cover the head but keeps the sun out of their eyes; women also traditionally have worn visors casually but a trend in certain youth subcultures sees an increase in feminine use of full hats. 

In many forms of motorsport, a baseball cap with the logo of the series’ tyre supplier will be given for the top 3 finishing drivers to wear during the podium ceremony.

== Professional use ==
=== Military ===

Some armed forces use baseball caps as part of their uniforms, usually with combat uniforms.

Those of the United States Armed Forces are worn mostly with utility uniforms and coveralls. They sometimes have a command logo on the front to denote command affiliation. Alternatively, the cap may have the wearer&#x27;s rank on the front, if an officer. Baseball caps of a particular color are worn to denote a specific function of a person or particular job. For example, in the United States submarine force, red baseball caps are worn by drill monitors who facilitate and critique members of the boat&#x27;s crew during drills. In the United States Army, parachute riggers wear red baseball caps and parachute instructors wear black baseball caps as part of their uniform. In various squadrons of the United States Air Force&#x27;s civilian auxiliary, squadron-distinctive baseball caps have been issued as headgear (or &quot;cover&quot;) for the Battle Dress Uniform, typically displaying squadron colors, squadron number, and/or squadron patch. Although the BDUs have their own cover, a patrol cap in M81 Woodland, some squadrons have opted for more distinctive covers.

=== Police ===

There has been a marked trend in recent years among police forces and other uniformed bodies throughout the world to substitute inexpensive and comfortable baseball caps for peaked caps and other traditional headdresses. The baseball cap is also commonly used by private security companies as a cheap, practical piece of uniform headgear.

Many armed police units around the world, notably SWAT in the United States and the Metropolitan Police Specialist Firearms Command in the UK, often wear baseball caps to shield their eyes from the sun where a full helmet would be excessive.

==== Finland ====
The Finnish Police uses a baseball cap, which has mostly replaced the traditional side cap. It is marked with the police emblem and &quot;Police&quot; in Finnish and Swedish.

==== Slovenia ====
In Slovenia, policemen on motorcycles wear baseball caps as a part of their uniform, when they remove the helmet.

==== Spain ====
*The Civil Guard switched from Teresiana caps (a Spanish military cap similar to a Kepi) to baseball caps in 2011 to 2012 (Only survive the Tricorne for Galas and Representation).

*The National Police uses a baseball cap, which has mostly replaced the Peaked caps in 2009 (except for Galas and Representation).

*The Local Police uses a baseball cap, which has mostly replaced the Peaked caps in 2008 (except for Galas).

==== Turkey ====
Turkish police switched from peaked caps to baseball caps in the 1990s.

==== United Kingdom ====

In the United Kingdom, the baseball cap has the additional advantage of being unisex and suitable for wear by both male and female officers. Throughout 2017, the Northamptonshire, Cheshire and Lancashire police forces adopted specially strengthened baseball caps known as &quot;Bump Caps&quot;, to replace the helmets and bowler hats previously worn. However, the Northamptonshire force announced in November 2018 that their &quot;Bump Caps&quot; had proven scruffy and unpopular, and would be withdrawn from use.

==== United States ====
In many United States police forces, the baseball cap is worn as a more practical alternative to the traditional peaked cap or campaign hat, the latter of which is generally used by Sheriff&#x27;s departments and state police forces. Baseball caps are more common on the West Coast, whereas in eastern states, the traditional peaked cap is more prominent. A notable exception is the San Francisco Police Department, where peaked caps are still worn regularly.

<doc id="433139" wikidata="Q13143" url="?curid=433139" title="Scaphoid bone">
<text>The scaphoid bone is one of the carpal bones of the wrist. It is situated between the hand and forearm on the thumb side of the wrist (also called the lateral or radial side). It forms the radial border of the carpal tunnel. The scaphoid bone is the largest bone of the proximal row of wrist bones, its long axis being from above downward, lateralward, and forward. It is approximately the size and shape of a medium cashew nut.

== Structure ==
The scaphoid is situated between the proximal and distal rows of carpal bones. It is located on the radial side of the wrist, adjacent to the styloid process of the radius. It articulates with the radius, lunate, trapezoid, trapezium, and capitate. Over 80% of the bone is covered in articular cartilage.

===Bone===
The palmar surface of the scaphoid is concave, and forming a distal tubercle, giving attachment to the transverse carpal ligament. The proximal surface is triangular, smooth and convex. The lateral surface is narrow and gives attachment to the radial collateral ligament. The medial surface has two facets, a flattened semi-lunar facet articulating with the lunate bone, and an inferior concave facet, articulating alongside the lunate with the head of the capitate bone.

The dorsal surface of the bone is narrow, with a groove running the length of the bone and allowing ligaments to attach, and the surface facing the fingers (anatomically inferior) is smooth and convex, also triangular, and divided into two parts by a slight ridge.

===Blood supply===
It receives its blood supply primarily from lateral and distal branches of the radial artery, via palmar and dorsal branches. These provide an &quot;abundant&quot; supply to middle and distal portions of the bone, but neglect the proximal portion, which relies on retrograde flow. The dorsal branch supplies the majority of the middle and distal portions, with the palmar branch supplying only the distal third of the bone.

===Variation===
The dorsal blood supply, particularly of the proximal portion, is highly variable. Sometimes the fibers of the abductor pollicis brevis emerge from the tubercle.

===In animals===
In reptiles, birds, and amphibians, the scaphoid is instead commonly referred to as the radiale because of its articulation with the radius.

== Function ==
The carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand. The scaphoid is also involved in movement of the wrist. It, along with the lunate bone, articulates with the radius and ulna to form the major bones involved in movement of the wrist. The scaphoid serves as a link between the two rows of carpal bones. With wrist movement, the scaphoid may flex from its position in the same plane as the forearm to perpendicular.

==Clinical significance==

===Fracture===

Fractures of the scaphoid are the most common of the carpal bone injuries, because of its connections with the two rows of carpal bones.

The scaphoid can be slow to heal because of the limited circulation to the bone. Fractures of the scaphoid must be recognized and treated quickly, as prompt treatment by immobilization or surgical fixation increases the likelihood of the bone healing in anatomic alignment, thus avoiding mal-union or non-union. Delays may compromise healing. Failure of the fracture to heal (&quot;non-union&quot;) will lead to post-traumatic osteoarthritis of the carpus. One reason for this is because of the &quot;tenuous&quot; blood supply to the proximal segment. Even rapidly immobilized fractures may require surgical treatment, including use of a headless compression screw such as the Herbert screw to bind the two halves together.

Healing of the fracture with a non-anatomic deformity (frequently, a volar flexed &quot;humpback&quot;) can also lead to post-traumatic arthritis. Non-unions can result in loss of blood supply to the proximal pole, which can result in avascular necrosis of the proximal segment.

Scaphoid fractures may be difficult to diagnose via plain x-ray. A repeat x-ray may be required at a later date, as might cross-sectional imaging via MRI or CT scan.

===Other diseases===
A condition called scapholunate instability can occur when the scapholunate ligament (connecting the scaphoid to the lunate bone) and other surrounding ligaments are disrupted. In this state, the distance between the scaphoid and lunate bones is increased.

One rare disease of the scaphoid is called Preiser&#x27;s Disease.

===Palpation===
The scaphoid can be palpated at the base of the anatomical snuff box. It can also be palpated in the volar (palmar) hand/wrist. Its position is the intersections of the long axes of the four fingers while in a fist, or the base of the thenar eminence. When palpated in this position, the bone will be felt to slide forward during radial deviation (wrist abduction) and flexion.

Clicking of the scaphoid or no anterior translation can indicate scapholunate instability.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;scaphoid&quot; () is derived from the Greek &quot;skaphos&quot;, which means &quot;a boat&quot;, and the Greek &quot;eidos&quot;, which means &quot;kind&quot;. The name refers to the shape of the bone, supposedly reminiscent of a boat. In older literature about human anatomy, the scaphoid is referred to as the navicular bone of the hand (this time from the Latin &quot;navis&quot; for boat); there is also a bone in a similar position in the foot, which is called the navicular. The modern term for the bone in the hand is &quot;scaphoid&quot;; in human anatomy the term &quot;navicular&quot; is reserved for the bone in the foot.

<doc id="433143" wikidata="Q2599326" url="?curid=433143" title="Castle of Almourol">
<text>The Castle of Almourol is a medieval castle atop the islet of Almourol in the middle of the Tagus River, located in the civil parish of Praia do Ribatejo, from the municipal seat of Vila Nova da Barquinha, in Portugal&#x27;s Oeste e Vale do Tejo region. The castle was part of the defensive line controlled by the Knights Templar, and a stronghold used during the Portuguese Reconquista.

==History==
It is believed that the castle was constructed on the site of a primitive Lusitanian castro that was later conquered by the Romans during the 1st century B.C.E. It was later remodeled by successive invading forces, including the Alans, Visigoths and the Arabs, although it is unclear when the present castle was established. In excavations carried out in the interior and exterior enclosures, various vestiges of Roman occupation were discovered including coins, millennium markers, and Roman foundations, while medieval remnants such as medallions and two marble columns were also discovered in the castle&#x27;s vicinity.

The castle of Almourol is one of the more emblematic medieval military monuments of the Reconquista, and one of the best representations of the influence of the Knights Templar in Portugal. When it was conquered in 1129 by forces loyal to the Portuguese nobility, it was known as &quot;Almorolan&quot;, and placed in the trust of Gualdim Pais, the master of the Knights Templar in Portugal, who subsequently rebuilt the structure. The structure was reconstructed, starting in 1171 (from an inscription over the principal gate) and restored during the subsequent reigns.

Losing its strategic place, the castle was abandoned and fell into ruin. In the 19th century, it was &quot;reinvented&quot; by idealistic romanticists, which eventually led to interventions in the 1940s and 1950s and adaptation of the castle to an &quot;Official Residence&quot; of the Portuguese Republic. During this period, there were many restorations that transformed the physical appearance of the structure, including the addition of crenellations and bartizans.

The &quot;Direcção-Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais&quot; (&quot;Directorate-General of Buildings and National Monuments&quot;), a forerunner of the current &quot;Direção-Geral do Património Cultural&quot;, first intervened on the site in 1939, constructing the chemin de ronde in masonry and reinforced concrete, dismantling and reconstructing a corner of the keep, repairing and consolidating the battlements (including demolition of the alure of the tower), reconstructing a brick vault under the existing, and reconstructing the interior pavement in small stone.

Around 1940-1950, spaces of the castle were adapted for its use as an official residence of the Portuguese Republic. At the end of this short term, the building&#x27;s furniture was acquired by the &quot;Comissão para a Aquisição de Mobiliário&quot; (&quot;Commission for Furniture Acquisition&quot;) in 1955, and an electrical system was installed.
Between 1958 and 1959, the keep was somewhat consolidated with concrete straps, a separate project diminished the permeability of the courtyard, the &quot;Escola Prática de Engenharia&quot; (&quot;Practical School of Engineering&quot;) reconstructed the interior walls of the tower, and a door (including doorposts and lintels) was reconstructed. Other projects followed: in 1959, the façade of one section of the wall was repaired; in 1960, with the conclusion of the repairs to the exterior walls, the &quot;Direcção da Arma de Engenharia de Tancos&quot; (&quot;Tancos Directorate for the Engineering Arm&quot;) improved the pavement and road access. The &quot;Serviços de Engenharia do Estado Maior do Exército&quot; (&quot;Army General Staff Engineering Services&quot;) reconstructed a roadway that skirted the islet from the quay to the southern end of the castle.

By 1996, the walls had been repaired, sections of the keep preserved, and the pavement within the castle restored.

=== 21st century and tourism ===

By 2004, the castle began to show new signs of degradation resulting from water infiltration, including in a few of the exterior walls.

Although access to the National Monument and fluvial islet is free, visitors to the structure must pay for an inexpensive boat ride across the river, the only way for them to reach the castle.

==Architecture==

The castle rises over a granite outcropping in height and is approximately long and wide, in the middle of the Tagus River waterway, a few metres below its confluence with the Zêzere River in front of the town of Tancos.

The castle has an irregular rectangular plan consisting of two enclosures: an exterior lower level faces upstream with a traitors&#x27; gate and walls reinforced by nine tall circular towers; while the interior enclosure, located at a higher elevation, has walls accessible by the main gate to the main keep. The keep is three stories tall and includes the original pads that supported the main truss. The remaining sentry towers are irregular, owing to the irregular terrain. The keep is actually an innovation at this castle, appearing in the 12th century after the Castle of Tomar, the principal defensive redoubt of the Templars in Portugal. Similarly, the watchtowers were innovations brought into the western Iberian peninsula by the Templars, and applied in Almourol.

The interior is bisected by several masonry doorways that link the different parts of the castle. Two inscription stones mark the castle&#x27;s history and its re-edification by Gualdim Pais (over the main gate), as well as its Christian history (from the cross carved into the space above an open window in the keep).

<doc id="433146" wikidata="Q3309730" url="?curid=433146" title="Michel Gauthier">
<text>Michel Gauthier (; February 18, 1950 – May 30, 2020) was a Canadian politician, who served as leader of the Bloc Québécois from 1996 to 1997. As the party was the Official Opposition in the Parliament of Canada, Gauthier was also the Leader of the Opposition during this time. He later recanted his sovereignist views when he joined the Conservative Party two years before his death.

==Early life==
Gauthier was born in Quebec City on February 18, 1950, and was raised in Chambord. His father, Joseph-Georges Tremblay, worked as a motor engine technician; his mother, Cécile (Archambault), was a housewife. Gauthier was a school teacher from 1970 to 1975, educational advisor from 1976 to 1979, then director of education services from 1979 to 1981 at the Roberval school board.

He then served as president of the Tourism Corporation of Chambord in 1975 and in 1976 as president of Chambord Chamber of Commerce in 1977 and 1978.

==Political career==
Gauthier was first elected as a Member of the National Assembly of Quebec for the Parti Québécois in 1981 for Roberval and was parliamentary secretary to the finance minister from 1983 to 1985. He was re-elected to the legislature in 1985 and served until 1988 when he resigned his seat to become director-general of the Roberval school board.

He won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada as a candidate of the Bloc Québécois in 1993.

Gauthier was not one of the Bloc&#x27;s better-known Members of Parliament (MPs), but after Lucien Bouchard resigned to become Premier of Quebec, Gauthier won the Bloc Québécois leadership election of 1996, defeating Francine Lalonde. The vote was conducted among members of the party&#x27;s &quot;directorate&quot; rather than by all members of the party, and this hurt Gauthier&#x27;s legitimacy.

Gauthier&#x27;s lack of profile resulted in some opposition parties mocking him as being the &quot;faceless leader&quot; of the opposition, as he was largely a political unknown in most of Canada and even in Quebec. His leadership was unpopular with the caucus due to alleged conservative views and his lack of &quot;charisma or authority&quot; when compared to Bouchard. Facing a revolt by his MPs, which culminated in the leaking of confidential caucus discussions, Gauthier resigned in March 1997. He was succeeded by Gilles Duceppe.

As a result of health issues after surgery, he announced in March 2007 that he would not run in the next federal election. He served as BQ House Leader from 1997 until 2007. Gauthier also served as the chief campaign organizer. He formally resigned on July 29, 2007, and became the host of &quot;Gauthier&quot;, a television news show, which began airing on TQS in September 2007.

On May 12, 2018, Gauthier joined the Conservative Party of Canada after not having been a member of any political party for eleven years. He has also said he was no longer a sovereigntist, though he remained a Quebec nationalist.

==Personal life and death==
Gauthier was married to Anne Allard until his death. He had two children from a previous marriage (Alexandre and Isabelle).

Gauthier died on May 30, 2020, at the age of 70. He had been suffering from lung cancer in the years leading up to his death.

<doc id="433147" wikidata="Q5117821" url="?curid=433147" title="Church of the Blessed Hope">
<text>The Church of the Blessed Hope (or Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith) is a small first-day Adventist Christian body. The churches have common roots with the Christadelphians and the Church of God General Conference (Abrahamic Faith).

==Background==
Benjamin Wilson spent his early life in Halifax, England. Benjamin, with his brothers, Joseph, John, and James, questioned the teachings of their local Baptist church and &quot;became convinced that the promises to Abraham were central to salvation&quot;. Benjamin and James moved their families to Geneva, Illinois in 1844. Brothers John and Joseph came to Geneva around 1849. Together they started a church in Geneva. Because of adopting a stance against military service, there was a need to adopt an &quot;official&quot; name during the Civil War. The name &quot;Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith&quot;, suggested by Benjamin Wilson, was chosen. The work of the Wilsons led to a number of congregations from Ohio to California (where Benjamin later moved), but no central organization. John Thomas, founder of the Christadelphians, was also a British emigrant who had been associated with the Campbellite movement in Illinois. Thomas and Wilson first corresponded by letter from 1846-1856 then met and were in active fellowship from 1856-1862. However, in 1863 a disagreement between the two men concerning the judgment seat and the resurrection caused the groups associated with them to separate, and the rift was confirmed when the two groups registered (for the purposes of conscientious objection in the American Civil War) with different names in 1865. The Church of the Blessed Hope began as a local congregation in Cleveland, Ohio. It was organized on October 4, 1863. Mark Allen, a missionary of the Church of God Abrahamic Faith movement from Woburn, Massachusetts, led fourteen Ohioans in founding this body. Congregations were soon afterward established in Salem and Unionville, and these congregations incorporated themselves as the Church of the Blessed Hope in 1888. All these congregations still exist, although the Cleveland body has moved to Chesterland. The leader of the Cleveland congregation from 1922–1927 was a Christadelphian. The Church of the Blessed Hope and the Church of God of the Abrahamic Faith were different in name, but part of the same movement. By the early 20th century, the movement had grown to over 200 congregations in about a dozen states. They were only a loose fellowship of churches. Some ties were maintained by state conferences and a periodical, &quot;The Restitution&quot;. When Benjamin Wilson retired in 1869 he left his &quot;The Gospel Banner&quot; to be merged with his nephew Thomas Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Herald of the Coming Kingdom and Bible Instructor&quot;, which was renamed in &quot;The Restitution&quot; in 1871 and published by Thomas Wilson and W.D. St. Clair in Chicago. In 1911 the five man Ministerial Association objected to the next editor of &quot;The Restitution&quot;, A. R. Underwood of Plymouth Indiana, leading to a severing of fellowship of the churches. The majority followed those opposed to Underwood, led by L. E. Connor, and they added two doctrines to their statement of faith - universal resurrection and open communion. Later, they also added the belief in a personal devil. The majority regrouped in 1921 and organized the Church of God (General Conference) (CoGGC) publishing a new magazine &quot;The Restitution Herald&quot;, published in Oregon, Illinois. Five congregations (three in Ohio and one each in Kentucky and Indiana) rejected these doctrinal additions and stood for the old Geneva Statement of Faith, now publishing &quot;The Restitution&quot; from Cleveland, Ohio. The minority congregations maintained ties, and in 1966 four of the then six churches adopted a uniform doctrinal statement. In 1976 these six churches (informally known as CGAF) began to gather for an annual gathering, which is now held each year in August at various colleges in Ohio.

==Faith and practice==
The Church of the Blessed Hope (CGAF) rejects the doctrine of the Trinity; recognizes the Bible as God&#x27;s revealed word; teaches that salvation is obtained through hearing, believing, confessing, and obeying the gospel; and expects the premillennial return and reign of Jesus, in which the righteous and the unjust will be raised, but that those who have not heard the gospel will not be raised from the dead. Valid baptism is performed through the immersion of believers in water. Christ&#x27;s command to partake the bread and the cup (communion) is observed weekly. They reject the doctrines which the larger CoGGC grouping accepted in 1921, namely a literal devil, universal resurrection, and open communion. Additionally CGAF members do not serve in war as combatants, although some congregations permit members to serve in humanitarian positions.

==Status==
In 2003, the Church of the Blessed Hope (CGAF) had eight congregations with about 400 members. The three Ohio congregations use the name Church of the Blessed Hope and the others do not. These CGAF churches are theologically much closer to the Christadelphians than they are to the Church of God General Conference (CoGGC), and have made moves in recent years to strengthen their ties. Most of the churches use the Christadelphian hymnal and Sunday School literature. Several of the CGAF churches, while having their own local statement of faith have also recognised the most common Christadelphian statement of the faith (BASF), in much the same way as many Christadelphian assemblies in Britain have their own local statements but employ the most common statement for wider purposes. It is a common practice for members of the Church of the Blessed Hope to seek out Christadelphian ecclesias when they move to areas where there is not a Church of the Blessed Hope. They are generally accepted into the Christadelphian ecclesia, and become active members of the Christadelphian community. Likewise, the Church of the Blessed Hope will accept a Christadelphian into fellowship. The CGAF annual Gathering, currently held at Denison, Ohio, has played an important role in reintroducing CGAF to Christadelphians and Christadelphians to CGAF. The Gathering receives a large contingent of both Unamended Christadelphians and Amended Christadelphians each year, and likewise many CGAF members attend Christadelphian events such as the annual Great Lakes Christadelphian Bible School. CGAF members have been invited to submit both articles, letters and event announcements in the &quot;Christadelphian Tidings&quot;, and likewise Christadelphians in the &quot;Abrahamic Faith Beacon&quot;. CGAF members cooperate with Christadelphian mission and charity organisations overseas. At the same time, common participation by CGAF and Christadelphian members on discussion forums has helped to make many Christadelphians, even outside North America, aware of the common beliefs shared with CGAF, and the differences with Church of God General Conference.

<text>A barchan or barkhan dune (from Kazakh бархан ) is a crescent-shaped dune.

Russian naturalist Alexander von Middendorf introduced the term in 1881, working from the occurrence of barchans in Turkestan and in other inland desert regions. Barchans &quot;face&quot; the wind, appearing convex, and are produced by wind action predominantly from one direction. They are a very common landform in sandy deserts all over the world and are arc-shaped, markedly asymmetrical in cross section, with a gentle slope facing toward the wind sand ridge, comprising well-sorted sand. 

This type of dune possesses two &quot;horns&quot; that face downwind, with the steeper slope known as the slip face, facing away from the wind, downwind, at the angle of repose of the sand in question, approximately 30–35 degrees for medium-fine dry sand. The upwind side is packed by the wind, and stands at about 15 degrees. Barchans may be high and wide at the base measured perpendicular to the wind.

Simple barchan dunes may appear as larger, compound barchan or megabarchan dunes, which can gradually migrate with the wind as a result of erosion on the windward side and deposition on the leeward side, at a rate of migration ranging from about one meter to 100 meters per year. Barchans usually occur as groups of isolated dunes and may form chains that extend across a plain in the direction of the prevailing wind. Barchans and mega-barchans may coalesce into ridges that extend for hundreds of kilometers. Dune collisions and changes in wind direction spawn new barchans from the horns of the old ones and govern the size distribution of a given field.

As barchan dunes migrate, smaller dunes outpace larger dunes, catching-up the rear of the larger dune and eventually appear to punch through the large dune to appear on the other side. The process appears superficially similar to waves of light, sound, or water that pass directly through each other, but the detailed mechanism is very different. The dunes emulate soliton behavior, but unlike solitons, which flow through a medium leaving it undisturbed (similar to waves passing through water), the sand particles themselves are moved. When the smaller dune catches up the larger dune, the winds begin to deposit sand on the rear dune while blowing sand off the front dune without replenishing it. Eventually, the rear dune has assumed dimensions similar to the former front dune which has now become a smaller, faster moving dune that pulls away with the wind.

Barchan dunes have been observed on Mars, where the thin atmosphere produces winds strong enough to move sand and dust. &quot;Marine barchan dunes&quot; appear underwater as sands shift their way across the seabed.

<doc id="433159" wikidata="Q704655" url="?curid=433159" title="National Front of the German Democratic Republic">
<text>The National Front of the German Democratic Republic () was officially an alliance of parties and mass organisations (1950–1990). In fact, only one party held power in the GDR, namely the communist SED. The National Front was an instrument to exercise control over the other parties and organisations. The precursor of the National Front was the Democratic Bloc (since 1945).

The main task of the National Front was to draw up a common electoral list (&quot;Einheitsliste&quot;) in elections to the East German parliament, the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Chamber&quot;). This &quot;unity list&quot; was the only list that citizens could vote for. Other parties or lists were prohibited. The National Front system was intended to give to the outside world the impression that there was a democracy with a multi-party system in the GDR.

After the Second World War, the Allies initially allowed four parties: the Communists, the Social Democrats, the Christian Democratic Union and the Liberal Democratic Party. In the Soviet Occupation Zone, the Communist Party forced the Social Democrats to merge (1946). Thus the communist-dominated Socialist Unity Party (SED) was formed. 

The other two parties, the Christian Democratic Union and the Liberal Democratic Party, were initially independent. The SED, with the help of the Soviet occupation authorities, intimidated these parties, removed and sometimes deported their leaders and forced them to get on course. Finally, the occupying authorities allowed two new parties to be founded: the Democratic Farmers&#x27; Party (DBD) and the National Democratic Party (NDPD) (1948). Both parties were founded by the SED, their first leaders even being former SED and Communist party functionaries respectively. Their task was to poach voters from the Christian Democrats and Liberals. The National Democrats were also supposed to be a collecting ground for former National Socialists. The parties that were not the SED were called &quot;Blockpartei&quot;.

Finally, there were so-called mass organisations in the Soviet occupation zone and then in the GDR. Some of them were represented on the electoral list, such as the trade union and the women&#x27;s organisation. Nearly all of these MPs were members of the SED. Therefore, although the SED faction in parliament did not have an absolute majority, most MPs were nevertheless SED members.

All parties and mass organisations in the National Front had to officially accept the SED&#x27;s leading role as a condition of their existence. The SED had significant control over these parties, with their leadership even at a regional level being subject to approval by the Friendly Parties Department of the SED Central Committee. The parties were afforded a large amount of infrastructure, including party buildings, newspapers and companies and were represented in the East German government by several ministers each, though as all ministers, they were de jure bound to directives issued by their responsible Central Committee Secretary. Only in the last weeks prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall (November 1989), some politicians of non-SED parties started to moderately criticize SED dominance. The Front disbanded in February 1990, a month before the first free elections in the GDR.

The Liberal Democratic Party and National Democratic Party eventually merged with the West German Free Democratic Party, whereas the Christian Democratic Union and the Democratic Farmers&#x27; Party merged with the West German Christian Democratic Union. This saw controversy at the time because the elaborate infrastructure that the SED had afforded the bloc parties put them at a great competitive advantage over newly established parties.

==Constituent parties==

==Constituent mass organizations represented in the People&#x27;s Chamber==

==Other organizations associated with the National Front==
The following organizations, which were part of the NF, did not send elected representatives to the Volkskammer but were active in the performance of its activities.

==History==
The National Front was the successor to the &quot;Demokratischer Block&quot; which had been founded in the Soviet occupation zone. The Front itself was founded on 30 March 1950. It operated through the issuing of a generally consistent proportion of seats (divided between the Front&#x27;s parties and SED-controlled mass organisations) submitted in the form of a single list of candidates during each election to the People&#x27;s Chamber. Seats were awarded on the basis of a set quota rather than vote totals. As voters only had the option of approving or rejecting the list in far-from-secret conditions, it &quot;won&quot; with virtually unanimous levels of support.

Although nominally a broad-based coalition of parties, in practice the SED was the only one with any real power. By ensuring that Communists dominated the lists, the SED essentially predetermined the composition of the People&#x27;s Chamber.

In 1950-1951, the public rejection of the validity of the list by some German politicians resulted in some of them being imprisoned for &quot;rejecting the electoral law of the German Democratic Republic&quot; (as in the case of LDPD leader Günter Stempel). Although the SED had already become a full-fledged Stalinist &quot;party of the new type&quot; by the formation of the GDR, the other parties did not completely bend to the SED&#x27;s will for a time. By the mid-1950s, however, the more courageous members of the constituent parties had been pushed out, and the parties had all been transformed into loyal partners of the SED. By this time, the SED itself had purged its few independent-minded members as well. The Front now took on a character similar to other groupings in the Eastern Bloc. For the next three decades, the minor parties in the Front had to accept the SED&#x27;s &quot;leading role&quot; as a condition of their continued existence.

On 1 December 1989, the Front was effectively rendered impotent when the Volkskammer deleted the provision of the Constitution of East Germany that gave the SED a monopoly of power. Four days later, the Christian Democratic Union and Liberal Democratic Party, having thrown out their pro-Communist leaderships, withdrew from the Front. On 16 December the SED, having transformed itself into a democratic socialist party, reformed itself into the Party of Democratic Socialism. On 20 February 1990, an amendment to the constitution removed mention of the Front.

== Chairmen of the National Front ==
The National Front, as in institution, was led by a National Council that included representatives from all of its constituent organisations, with the SED being over-represented. The National Council elected a Presidium, whose chairman always was an independent politician. Despite the NF&#x27;s power on paper, the chairman had almost no influence.

<doc id="433164" wikidata="Q1424533" url="?curid=433164" title="Mann–Whitney U test">
<text>The Mann–Whitney formula_1 test (also called the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon (MWW/MWU), Wilcoxon rank-sum test, or Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test) is a nonparametric statistical test of the null hypothesis that randomly selected values &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; from two populations have the same distribution. 

Nonparametric tests used on two &quot;dependent&quot; samples are the sign test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

==Assumptions and formal statement of hypotheses==
Although Henry Mann and Donald Ransom Whitney developed the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test under the assumption of continuous responses with the alternative hypothesis being that one distribution is stochastically greater than the other, there are many other ways to formulate the null and alternative hypotheses such that the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test will give a valid test.

A very general formulation is to assume that:

# All the observations from both groups are independent of each other,
# The responses are at least ordinal (i.e., one can at least say, of any two observations, which is the greater),
# Under the null hypothesis &quot;H&quot;0, the distributions of both populations are identical.
# The alternative hypothesis &quot;H&quot;1 is that the distributions are not identical.

Under the general formulation, the test is only consistent when the following occurs under &quot;H&quot;1:

# The probability of an observation from population &quot;X&quot; exceeding an observation from population &quot;Y&quot; is different (larger, or smaller) than the probability of an observation from &quot;Y&quot; exceeding an observation from &quot;X&quot;; i.e., or .

Under more strict assumptions than the general formulation above, e.g., if the responses are assumed to be continuous and the alternative is restricted to a shift in location, i.e., , we can interpret a significant Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test as showing a difference in medians. Under this location shift assumption, we can also interpret the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test as assessing whether the Hodges–Lehmann estimate of the difference in central tendency between the two populations differs from zero. The Hodges–Lehmann estimate for this two-sample problem is the median of all possible differences between an observation in the first sample and an observation in the second sample.

Otherwise, if both the dispersions and shapes of the distribution of both samples differ, the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test fails a test of medians. It is possible to show examples where medians are numerically equal while the test rejects the null hypothesis with a small p-value. 

The Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test / Wilcoxon rank-sum test is not the same as the Wilcoxon &quot;signed&quot;-rank test, although both are nonparametric and involve summation of ranks. The Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test is applied to independent samples. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is applied to matched or dependent samples.

==U statistic ==
Let formula_2 be group 1, an i.i.d. sample from formula_3, and formula_4 be group 2, an i.i.d. sample from formula_5, and let both samples be independent of each other. The corresponding &quot;Mann–Whitney U statistic&quot; is defined as the smaller of:

:formula_6

with 
:formula_7 being the sums of the ranks in groups 1 and 2, after ranking all samples from both groups such that the smallest value obtains rank 1 and the largest rank formula_8. 

=== Area-under-curve (AUC) statistic for ROC curves ===
The &quot;U&quot; statistic is related to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC):
:formula_9

Note that this is the same definition as the common language effect size, i.e. the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen instance from the first group higher than a randomly chosen instance from the second group.

Because of its probabilistic form, the &quot;U&quot; statistic can be generalized to a measure of a classifier&#x27;s separation power for more than two classes:
:formula_10
Where &quot;c&quot; is the number of classes, and the &quot;R&quot;&quot;k&quot;,&quot;ℓ&quot; term of AUC&quot;k&quot;,&quot;ℓ&quot; considers only the ranking of the items belonging to classes &quot;k&quot; and &quot;ℓ&quot; (i.e., items belonging to all other classes are ignored) according to the classifier&#x27;s estimates of the probability of those items belonging to class &quot;k&quot;. AUC&quot;k&quot;,&quot;k&quot; will always be zero but, unlike in the two-class case, generally , which is why the &quot;M&quot; measure sums over all (&quot;k&quot;,&quot;ℓ&quot;) pairs, in effect using the average of AUC&quot;k&quot;,&quot;ℓ&quot; and AUC&quot;ℓ&quot;,&quot;k&quot;.

==Calculations==
The test involves the calculation of a statistic, usually called &quot;U&quot;, whose distribution under the null hypothesis is known:
* In the case of small samples, the distribution is tabulated
* For sample sizes above ~20, approximation using the normal distribution is fairly good. 

Alternatively, the null distribution can be approximated using permutation tests and Monte Carlo simulations.

Some books tabulate statistics equivalent to &quot;U&quot;, such as the sum of ranks in one of the samples, rather than &quot;U&quot; itself.

The Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test is included in most statistical packages. 

It is also easily calculated by hand, especially for small samples. There are two ways of doing this.

Method one:

For comparing two small sets of observations, a direct method is quick, and gives insight into the meaning of the &quot;U&quot; statistic, which corresponds to the number of wins out of all pairwise contests (see the tortoise and hare example under Examples below). For each observation in one set, count the number of times this first value wins over any observations in the other set (the other value loses if this first is larger). Count 0.5 for any ties. The sum of wins and ties is &quot;U&quot; (i.e.: formula_11) for the first set. &quot;U&quot; for the other set is the converse (i.e.: formula_12).

Method two:

For larger samples:
# Assign numeric ranks to all the observations (put the observations from both groups to one set), beginning with 1 for the smallest value. Where there are groups of tied values, assign a rank equal to the midpoint of unadjusted rankings (e.g., the ranks of are , where the unadjusted ranks would be ).
# Now, add up the ranks for the observations which came from sample 1. The sum of ranks in sample 2 is now determined, since the sum of all the ranks equals where &quot;N&quot; is the total number of observations.
# &quot;U&quot; is then given by:

:::formula_13

::where &quot;n&quot;1 is the sample size for sample 1, and &quot;R&quot;1 is the sum of the ranks in sample 1.

::Note that it doesn&#x27;t matter which of the two samples is considered sample 1. An equally valid formula for &quot;U&quot; is

:::formula_14

::The smaller value of &quot;U&quot;1 and &quot;U&quot;2 is the one used when consulting significance tables. The sum of the two values is given by
:::formula_15

:: Knowing that and , and doing some algebra, we find that the sum is

==Properties==

The maximum value of &quot;U&quot; is the product of the sample sizes for the two samples (i.e.: formula_16). In such a case, the &quot;other&quot; &quot;U&quot; would be 0.

==Examples==

===Illustration of calculation methods===

Suppose that Aesop is dissatisfied with his classic experiment in which one tortoise was found to beat one hare in a race, and decides to carry out a significance test to discover whether the results could be extended to tortoises and hares in general. He collects a sample of 6 tortoises and 6 hares, and makes them all run his race at once. The order in which they reach the finishing post (their rank order, from first to last crossing the finish line) is as follows, writing T for a tortoise and H for a hare:
:T H H H H H T T T T T H
What is the value of &quot;U&quot;?
* Using the direct method, we take each tortoise in turn, and count the number of hares it beats, getting 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, which means that . Alternatively, we could take each hare in turn, and count the number of tortoises it beats. In this case, we get 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, so . Note that the sum of these two values for , which is .
* Using the indirect method:
: rank the animals by the time they take to complete the course, so give the first animal home rank 12, the second rank 11, and so forth.
: the sum of the ranks achieved by the tortoises is .
:: Therefore (same as method one).
:: The sum of the ranks achieved by the hares is , leading to .
===Example statement of results===
In reporting the results of a Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test, it is important to state:
*A measure of the central tendencies of the two groups (means or medians; since the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test is an ordinal test, medians are usually recommended)
*The value of &quot;U&quot; (perhaps with some measure of effect size, such as common language effect size or rank-biserial correlation).
*The sample sizes
*The significance level.
In practice some of this information may already have been supplied and common sense should be used in deciding whether to repeat it. A typical report might run,
:&quot;Median latencies in groups E and C were 153 and 247 ms; the distributions in the two groups differed significantly (Mann–Whitney , , two-tailed).&quot;
A statement that does full justice to the statistical status of the test might run,
:&quot;Outcomes of the two treatments were compared using the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney two-sample rank-sum test. The treatment effect (difference between treatments) was quantified using the Hodges–Lehmann (HL) estimator, which is consistent with the Wilcoxon test. This estimator (HLΔ) is the median of all possible differences in outcomes between a subject in group B and a subject in group A. A non-parametric 0.95 confidence interval for HLΔ accompanies these estimates as does ρ, an estimate of the probability that a randomly chosen subject from population B has a higher weight than a randomly chosen subject from population A. The median [quartiles] weight for subjects on treatment A and B respectively are 147 [121, 177] and 151 [130, 180] kg. Treatment A decreased weight by HLΔ = 5 kg (0.95 CL [2, 9] kg, , ).&quot;

However it would be rare to find such an extensive report in a document whose major topic was not statistical inference.

==Normal approximation and tie correction==

For large samples, &quot;U&quot; is approximately normally distributed. In that case, the standardized value
:formula_17

where &quot;m&quot;&quot;U&quot; and &quot;σ&quot;&quot;U&quot; are the mean and standard deviation of &quot;U&quot;, is approximately a standard normal deviate whose significance can be checked in tables of the normal distribution. &quot;m&quot;&quot;U&quot; and &quot;σ&quot;&quot;U&quot; are given by

:formula_18 and

:formula_19 

The formula for the standard deviation is more complicated in the presence of tied ranks. If there are ties in ranks, &quot;σ&quot; should be adjusted as follows:

:formula_20 

where the left side is simply the variance and the right side is the adjustment for ties, &quot;t&quot;&quot;k&quot; is the number of ties for the &quot;k&quot;th rank, and &quot;K&quot; is the total number of unique ranks with ties.

A more computationally-efficient form with factored out is

:formula_21

where .

If the number of ties is small (and especially if there are no large tie bands) ties can be ignored when doing calculations by hand. The computer statistical packages will use the correctly adjusted formula as a matter of routine.

Note that since , the mean used in the normal approximation is the mean of the two values of &quot;U&quot;. Therefore, the absolute value of the &quot;z&quot;-statistic calculated will be same whichever value of &quot;U&quot; is used.

==Effect sizes==
It is a widely recommended practice for scientists to report an effect size for an inferential test.

===Proportion of concordance out of all pairs===
The following measures are equivalent.

====Common language effect size====
One method of reporting the effect size for the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test is with &quot;f&quot;, the common language effect size. As a sample statistic, the common language effect size is computed by forming all possible pairs between the two groups, then finding the proportion of pairs that support a direction (say, that items from group 1 are larger than items from group 2). To illustrate, in a study with a sample of ten hares and ten tortoises, the total number of ordered pairs is ten times ten or 100 pairs of hares and tortoises. Suppose the results show that the hare ran faster than the tortoise in 90 of the 100 sample pairs; in that case, the sample common language effect size is 90%.

The relationship between &quot;f&quot; and the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; (specifically formula_11) is as follows:

:formula_23

This is the same as the area under the curve (AUC) for the ROC curve.

====&quot;ρ&quot; statistic====
A statistic called &quot;ρ&quot; that is linearly related to &quot;U&quot; and widely used in studies of categorization (discrimination learning involving concepts), and elsewhere, is calculated by dividing &quot;U&quot; by its maximum value for the given sample sizes, which is simply . &quot;ρ&quot; is thus a non-parametric measure of the overlap between two distributions; it can take values between 0 and 1, and it is an estimate of , where &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are randomly chosen observations from the two distributions. Both extreme values represent complete separation of the distributions, while a &quot;ρ&quot; of 0.5 represents complete overlap. The usefulness of the &quot;ρ&quot; statistic can be seen in the case of the odd example used above, where two distributions that were significantly different on a Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test nonetheless had nearly identical medians: the ρ value in this case is approximately 0.723 in favour of the hares, correctly reflecting the fact that even though the median tortoise beat the median hare, the hares collectively did better than the tortoises collectively.

===Rank-biserial correlation===
A method of reporting the effect size for the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test is with a measure of rank correlation known as the rank-biserial correlation. Edward Cureton introduced and named the measure. Like other correlational measures, the rank-biserial correlation can range from minus one to plus one, with a value of zero indicating no relationship.

There is a simple difference formula to compute the rank-biserial correlation from the common language effect size: the correlation is the difference between the proportion of pairs favorable to the hypothesis (&quot;f&quot;) minus its complement (i.e.: the proportion that is unfavorable (&quot;u&quot;)). This simple difference formula is just the difference of the common language effect size of each group, and is as follows:

:formula_24

For example, consider the example where hares run faster than tortoises in 90 of 100 pairs. The common language effect size is 90%, so the rank-biserial correlation is 90% minus 10%, and the rank-biserial .

An alternative formula for the rank-biserial can be used to calculate it from the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; (either formula_11 or formula_12) and the sample sizes of each group:

: formula_27

This formula is useful when the data are not available, but when there is a published report, because &quot;U&quot; and the sample sizes are routinely reported. Using the example above with 90 pairs that favor the hares and 10 pairs that favor the tortoise, &quot;U&quot;2 is the smaller of the two, so . This formula then gives , which is the same result as with the simple difference formula above.

==Relation to other tests==

===Comparison to Student&#x27;s &quot;t&quot;-test===
The Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test tests a null hypothesis of that the probability distribution of a randomly drawn observation from one group is the same as the probability distribution of a randomly drawn observation from the other group against an alternative that those distributions are not equal (see Mann–Whitney U test#Assumptions and formal statement of hypotheses). In contrast, a t-test tests a null hypothesis of equal means in two groups against an alternative of unequal means. Hence, except in special cases, the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test and the t-test do not test the same hypotheses and should be compared with this in mind. 
;Ordinal data: The Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test is preferable to the &quot;t&quot;-test when the data are ordinal but not interval scaled, in which case the spacing between adjacent values of the scale cannot be assumed to be constant.
;Robustness:As it compares the sums of ranks, the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test is less likely than the &quot;t&quot;-test to spuriously indicate significance because of the presence of outliers. However, the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test may have worse type I error control when data are both heteroscedastic and non-normal.
;Efficiency:When normality holds, the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test has an (asymptotic) efficiency of 3/ or about 0.95 when compared to the &quot;t&quot;-test. For distributions sufficiently far from normal and for sufficiently large sample sizes, the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test is considerably more efficient than the &quot;t&quot;. This comparison in efficiency, however, should be interpreted with caution, as Mann–Whitney and the t-test do not test the same quantities. If, for example, a difference of group means is of primary interest, Mann–Whitney is not an appropriate test.

The Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test will give very similar results to performing an ordinary parametric two-sample &quot;t&quot;-test on the rankings of the data.
===Different distributions===
The Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test is not valid for testing the null hypothesis formula_28 against the alternative hypothesis formula_29), without assuming that the distributions are the same under the null hypothesis (i.e., assuming formula_30). To test between those hypotheses, better tests are available. Among those are the Brunner-Munzel and the Fligner–Policello test. Specifically, under the more general null hypothesis formula_28, the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test can have inflated type I error rates even in large samples (especially if the variances of two populations are unequal and the sample sizes are different), a problem the better alternatives solve. As a result, it has been suggested to use one of the alternatives (specifically the Brunner–Munzel test) if it cannot be assumed that the distributions are equal under the null hypothesis.

====Alternatives====
If one desires a simple shift interpretation, the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test should &quot;not&quot; be used when the distributions of the two samples are very different, as it can give erroneous interpretation of significant results. In that situation, the unequal variances version of the &quot;t&quot;-test may give more reliable results.

Similarly, some authors (e.g., Conover) suggest transforming the data to ranks (if they are not already ranks) and then performing the &quot;t&quot;-test on the transformed data, the version of the &quot;t&quot;-test used depending on whether or not the population variances are suspected to be different. Rank transformations do not preserve variances, but variances are recomputed from samples after rank transformations.

The Brown–Forsythe test has been suggested as an appropriate non-parametric equivalent to the &quot;F&quot;-test for equal variances.

A more powerful test is the Brunner-Munzel test, outperforming the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test in case of violated assumption of exchangeability.

The Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test is a special case of the proportional odds model, allowing for covariate-adjustment.

See also Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.

==Related test statistics==

===Kendall&#x27;s tau===
The Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test is related to a number of other non-parametric statistical procedures. For example, it is equivalent to Kendall&#x27;s tau correlation coefficient if one of the variables is binary (that is, it can only take two values).

==Software implementations==
In many software packages, the Mann–Whitney &quot;U&quot; test (of the hypothesis of equal distributions against appropriate alternatives) has been poorly documented. Some packages incorrectly treat ties or fail to document asymptotic techniques (e.g., correction for continuity). A 2000 review discussed some of the following packages:

* MATLAB has in its Statistics Toolbox.
* R&#x27;s statistics base-package implements the test in its &quot;stats&quot; package.
* The R function from the package will calculate the statistic for a Wilcoxon two-sample, paired, or one-sample test.

==History==

The statistic appeared in a 1914 article by the German Gustav Deuchler (with a missing term in the variance).

In a single paper in 1945, Frank Wilcoxon proposed both the one-sample signed rank and the two-sample rank sum test, in a test of significance with a point null-hypothesis against its complementary alternative (that is, equal versus not equal). However, he only tabulated a few points for the equal-sample size case in that paper (though in a later paper he gave larger tables).

A thorough analysis of the statistic, which included a recurrence allowing the computation of tail probabilities for arbitrary sample sizes and tables for sample sizes of eight or less appeared in the article by Henry Mann and his student Donald Ransom Whitney in 1947. This article discussed alternative hypotheses, including a stochastic ordering (where the cumulative distribution functions satisfied the pointwise inequality ). This paper also computed the first four moments and established the limiting normality of the statistic under the null hypothesis, so establishing that it is asymptotically distribution-free.

<doc id="433171" wikidata="Q1375949" url="?curid=433171" title="Samba (Brazilian dance)">
<text>Samba is a lively dance of Afro-Brazilian origin in 2/4(2 by 4) time danced to samba music.

The term &quot;baby&quot; originally referred to any of several Latin duet dances with origins from the Congo and Angola. Today Samba is the most prevalent dance form in Brazil, and reaches the height of its importance during the festival of Carnaval. There is actually a set of dances, rather than a single dance, that define the Samba dancing scene in Brazil; however, no one dance can be claimed with certainty as the &quot;original&quot; Samba style. Besides Brazilian Samba, a major style of Samba is ballroom Samba, which differs significantly.

== Etymology ==
There are many theories about the origin of the word &quot;samba&quot;.

One of the first references to &quot;samba&quot; was in Pernambuco magazine&#x27;s &quot;O Carapuceiro&quot;, in February 1838. Father Miguel Lopes Gama of Sacramento wrote an article arguing against what he called &quot;the samba d&#x27;almocreve&quot;, which was a type of dance drama popular with black people of that time.

According to Hiram Araújo da Costa, over the centuries, the festival of dances of slaves in Bahia were called samba. Samba de Roda was the main form of circle dance, provenient from the Candomblé Afro-Brazilian Tradition.

During the mid-19th century, the word referred to several types of music made by enslaved Africans. Samba further developed specific characteristics in each Brazilian state, not only due to the diversity of tribes of African immigrants, but also because of the distinctive cultures each region embodied. Some of these popular dances were known as Candomblé, Catêrêtê, Caxambú, Choradinho, Côco-inchádo, Cocumbí, Córta-jáca, Cururú, Furrundú.

== Styles ==

===Samba no pé===
&quot;Samba no pé&quot; (literally, &quot;samba in the foot&quot;) is a solo dance that is commonly danced impromptu when samba music is played. The basic movement involves a straight body and a bending of one knee at a time. The feet move very slightly - only a few inches at a time. The rhythm is 2/4, with 3 steps per measure. It can be thought of as a step-ball-change. It can be described calling it and-a-one, and-a-two, then back to one. The basic movement is the same to either side, where one foot moves to the outside lifting up just before the first beat (i.e. the right leg moves slightly to the right) and leg is kept as straight as a pole. The other foot moves slightly towards the front, and closer to the first foot. The second leg bends lightly at the knee so that the left side of the hip lowers and the right side appears to move higher. The weight is shifted to this inside foot briefly for the next &quot;and-a&quot;, then shifted back to the outside foot on the &quot;two&quot;, and the same series of actions is repeated towards the other side.

The dance simply follows the beat of the music and can go from average pace to very fast. Men dance with the whole foot on the ground while women, often wearing heels, dance just on the balls of the foot. Professionals may change the steps slightly, taking 4 steps per measure instead of 3, and often add various arm movements depending on the mood of the music.

There are also regional forms of the dance in Brazil where the essential steps are the same, but because of a change in the accent of the music people will dance similar movements to the slightly changed accents. For instance, in Bahia the girls tend to dance tilting their legs towards the outside instead of keeping their knees close to each other as in Rio de Janeiro.

This is the type of Samba one sees in the Brazilian Carnival parades and in other Samba carnivals over the world. This is also one of the most common type of samba dancing in Brazil.

===Samba de Gafieira===
Samba de Gafieira is a partner dance considerably different from the Ballroom Samba. It appeared in the 1940s and it gets its name from the &quot;gafieira&quot;, popular urban nightclubs of Rio de Janeiro at that time.

The dance derived from the Maxixe and followed the arrival of the Choro (another samba musical style). It left most of the Maxixe&#x27;s Polka elements behind but maintained the entwined leg movements of the Argentine tango, although adopting a more relaxed posture than the latter. Many see this form of Samba as a combination of Waltz and Tango. Several Brazilian dance studios use elements and techniques from these two dances to teach Samba de Gafieira steps and dance routines.

===Samba Pagode===
Samba Pagode is a Samba partner dance that resembles the Samba de Gafieira but tends to be more intimate. The literal meaning of the Portuguese word &quot;pagode&quot; translates to &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;merrymaking&quot;. The word is also utilized to refer to an informal gathering of samba dancers along with their accompanying music.

A key feature of Samba Pagode is its rhythmic texture created with a variety of beats. It became a dance style after the appearance of the Pagode style of music, which originated in the Brazilian city of São Paulo. The pagode style utilizes three specific percussion instruments: the tanta, the repique-de-mao, and the pandeiro. All three instruments are played by hand, which lends to creating a softer, more intimate sound than the batucada Samba performed by many Samba schools in Brazil. Pagode-like events have dated back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the emergence of urban Samba in Rio de Janeiro.

===Samba Axé===
Samba Axé is a solo dance that started in 1992 during the Brazilian Carnival season in Bahia when the Axé rhythm replaced the Lambada. For years it became the major type of dance for the North east of Brazil during the holiday months. The dance is completely choreographed and the movements tend to mimic the lyrics. It is very energetic and mixes elements of Samba no pé and aerobics and because of the lyrics, which are made for entertainment, the dance generally has some sort of ludic element.

Several Axé music groups such as &quot;É o Tchan&quot; have as part of their marketing strategy to always release a choreography together with every one of their songs; therefore, Samba Axé is an ever-changing genre with no set of steps, routines or basic step.

===Samba-reggae===
Samba-reggae is a mix of reggae beats created by Samba drums. It is found in popular songs by the artist Daniela Mercury, who introduced the rhythm to the world with songs like &quot;Sol da Liberdade&quot; &quot;O Reggae E O Mar&quot; and &quot;Perola Negra&quot;. Samba Reggae is a popular samba style in Bahia, with many followers in various parts of Brazil.

Samba-reggae has birthed a style of African-influenced dance which has been obtained from the styles of Afro-Brazilian and candomble dance. Within social settings, samba-reggae dances are often performed in a follow-the-leader manner, with a small number of advanced dancers initiating steps in a line in front of the crowd, and then the whole crowd subsequently following along. The percussionists of samba-reggae often dance while playing their drums as well. The third- and fourth drummers, known as &quot;surdos&quot; perform short choreographies, utilizing mallets to emphasize sharp arm movements. The &quot;fundos&quot; (the first and second surdos at the lead) often take center stage to showcase elaborate, deft mallet lifts and throws, and also toss their drums high overhead.

===Samba-rock===
Samba-rock is a playful form of the samba that originates from São Paulo. It is a form of Latin nightclub dance.

One of Samba-rock&#x27;s first dance instructors, Mestre Ataliba, describes the essence of the dance style. &quot;Dance wise, samba rock is about relaxation and concentration, all at once... It blends the African &#x27;ginga&#x27; (body flow from Capoeira), which is present at the feet and the hips, and the European reference of the ballroom etiquette. We can dance it to the sound of Rita Pavone, samba pagode, reggae, R&amp;B. It really embraces every music culture&quot;.

=== Samba de roda ===
(&quot;Samba of roda&quot;) is a traditional Afro-Brazilian dance performed originally as informal fun after a Candomblé ceremony, using the same percussion instruments used during the religious ceremony. The typical drum is the atabaque; drummers improvise variations and elaborations on common patterns, accompanied typically by singing and clapping as well as dancing.

The Samba de Roda is a celebratory event incorporating music, choreography and poetry.

The term &quot;Samba&quot; encompassed many different rhythms, tunes, drumming and dances of various periods and areas of the Brazilian territory. It appeared in the state of Bahia, more specifically in the region of Recôncavo in Brazil, during the 17th century.

Because all drumming and dance was generalized by Portuguese colonizers as &quot;samba&quot;, it is difficult to attribute it to one distinct heritage. However, the most universally recognized cultural origin of Samba is Lundu, a rhythm that was brought to Brazil by the Bantu slaves from Africa. Lundu reveals, in a way, the amalgamation of black (slaves) and white (Portuguese) and indigenous cultures. When the African slaves where imported, it was named the &quot;semba&quot; and with the introduction of the Arabic Pandeiro (tambourine), brought into the Roda by the Portuguese, the &quot;Samba&quot; was molded into the form of dance it is now.

In the indigenous language, &quot;samba&quot; means roda de dança, or a circle to dance since the indigenous peoples danced in celebration on many occasions, such as the celebration of popular Catholic festivals, Amerindian or Afro-Brazilian religious ceremonies, but was also practiced at random.

All participants, including beginners, are invited to join the dance and observe as well as imitate. Usually, only the women dance after each other and they are surrounded by others dancing in a circle and clapping their hands. The choreography is often spontaneous and is based on movements of the feet, legs and hips. One of the most typical moves is the &quot;umbigada&quot; which is clear Bantu influence, where the dancer invites her successor into the circle&#x27;s center.

The factor that frequently draws the attention of most people to the rhythm is the unusually-accented (syncopated) beat. The absent beat is the strongest characteristic of Samba prompting the listener to dance to fill the gap with her/his body movements. This syncopated rhythm is also an indication of Black resistance against cultural assimilation. The Samba of Roda in particular was considered an expression of freedom and identity of the underprivileged and became a means of liberation.

The Samba de Roda has significantly waned during the twentieth century due to economic decline and increased poverty in the region. The effects of mass media and competition from popular modern music have also devalued this tradition among the younger generation. Finally, the weakening of the Samba de Roda was heightened through the aging of practitioners and demise of those who made the musical instruments.

<text>The Berlin Palace (), formally the Royal Palace () and also known as the City Palace (), is a large building adjacent to Berlin Cathedral and the Museum Island in the Mitte area of Berlin. It was the main residence of the House of Hohenzollern from 1443 to 1918. Expanded by order of Frederick I of Prussia according to plans by Andreas Schlüter from 1689 to 1713, it was thereafter considered a major work of Prussian Baroque architecture. The royal palace became one of Berlin’s largest buildings and shaped the cityscape with its dome erected in 1845.

Used for various government functions after the abolition of the monarchy in the 1918 revolution, the palace was damaged during the Allied bombing in World War II, and was razed to the ground by the East German authorities in 1950. In the 1970s, the East German authorities erected a modernist parliament building on the site, known as the Palace of the Republic. After German reunification in 1990, and years of debate, particularly regarding the fraught historical legacy of both buildings, the Palace of the Republic was itself demolished in 2009. 

Most of the Berlin Palace&#x27;s exterior was reconstructed beginning in 2013 to house the Humboldt Forum museum. The east façade of the reconstructed palace incorporates a modernist design, while the new interior combines both historicist and modernist elements. Architect Franco Stella oversaw the project and the exterior reconstruction was completed in 2020, with the last decoration being mounted in 2023. The palace is now again among the largest in the world.

==Overview==
The palace was originally built in the 15th century, but had changed in form throughout the next few centuries. It bore features of the Baroque style; its shape, which had been finalized by the mid-18th century, is for the most part attributed to German architect Andreas Schlüter, whose first design is likely to date from 1702, even though the palace incorporated earlier parts as seen in 1688 by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger. It was the principal residence and winter residence of the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia from 1701 to 1918. After the unification of Germany in 1871, it also became the central residence for the German Emperors, who also served as the kings of Prussia. After the proclamation of the Weimar Republic in 1918, the palace became a museum. In World War II, the building was heavily damaged by Allied bombing. Although it is thought to have been repairable, the palace was demolished in 1950 by the East German authorities following much criticism. In the 1970s, the Palace of the Republic was constructed on its site. After controversial public discussions, in 2002 the Bundestag decided to demolish the Palace of the Republic in order to make place for a partial reconstruction of the Berlin Palace.

Located on Spree Island, the plans envisaged the reconstruction of three sides of the palace exterior in the original style, initially without the National Kaiser Wilhelm Monument at the west front facing the river Spree, and a modernist façade facing other branch of the Spree. The identically reconstructed facades include various remnant sculptures and stones of the original palace. The inner courtyard facades are also modern, except three facades of the main courtyard which was originally built in 1699 (Schlüterhof). The floorplan has been designed to allow future reconstruction of notable historical rooms. Part of the building houses the Humboldt Forum museum and congress complex, and was finished in 2020.

==History==

===History up to 1871===
The palace replaced an earlier fort or castle guarding the crossing of the Spree at Cölln, a neighbouring town which merged with Berlin in 1710. The castle stood on Fishers&#x27; Island, as the southern end of the Museum Island in the Spree is known. In 1443 Frederick II &quot;Irontooth&quot;, Margrave and Prince Elector of Brandenburg, laid the foundations of Berlin&#x27;s first fortification in a section of swampy wasteland north of Cölln. At the completion of the castle in 1451, Frederick moved there from the town of Brandenburg. The main role of the castle and its garrison in this period was to establish the authority of the margraves over the unruly citizens of Berlin, who were reluctant to give up their medieval privileges to a monarchy. In 1415 King Sigismund had enfeoffed the Hohenzollern princes with Brandenburg, and they were now establishing their power and withdrawing privileges which the cities had attained in the Brandenburg interregnum of 1319–1415.

In 1454 Frederick II, after having returned via Rome from his pilgrimage to Jerusalem, made the castle chapel a parish church, richly endowing it with relics and altars. Pope Nicholas V ordered Stephan Bodecker, then Prince-Bishop of Brandenburg, to consecrate the chapel to Erasmus of Formiae. On 7 April 1465, at Frederick&#x27;s request, Pope Paul II attributed to &quot;St Erasmus Chapel&quot; a canon law College named &quot;Stift zu Ehren Unserer Lieben Frauen, des heiligen Kreuzes, St. Petri und Pauli, St. Erasmi und St. Nicolai&quot;. This collegiate church became the nucleus of today&#x27;s Evangelical Supreme Parish and Collegiate Church (&quot;Berliner Dom&quot; (Berlin Cathedral)), adjoining the site of the castle.

In 1538, the Elector Joachim II demolished the castle and engaged the master builder Caspar Theiss to build a new and grander palace in the Italian Renaissance style. After the Thirty Years War (1618–1648), Frederick William, the &quot;Great Elector&quot;, embellished the palace further. In 1688, Nicodemus Tessin the Younger designed courtyard arcades with massive columns in front. Not much is known about the alterations of 1690–1695, when Johann Nering was the court architect. Martin Grünberg continued the alterations in 1695–1699.

In 1699, the Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg (who took the title King in Prussia in 1701, becoming Frederick I), appointed the architect Andreas Schlüter to execute a &quot;second plan&quot; in the Italian manner. Schlüter&#x27;s first design probably dates from 1702; he planned to rebuild the palace in the Protestant Baroque style. His overall concept in the shape of a regular cube enclosing a magnificently ornamented courtyard was retained by all the building directors who succeeded him. In 1706, Schlüter was replaced by Johann Friedrich Eosander von Göthe, who designed the western extension of the palace, doubling its size. In all essentials, Schlüter&#x27;s balanced, rhythmic composition of the façades was retained, but Göthe moved the main entrance to the new west wing.

Frederick William I, who became king in 1713, was interested mainly in building up Prussia as a military power, and dismissed most of the craftsmen working on the Stadtschloss. As a result, Göthe&#x27;s plan was only partly carried out. The palace was namely the original location for the Amber Room in the Catherine Palace of Tsarskoye Selo near Saint Petersburg, but Peter the Great of Russia admired it during a visit, and in 1716 Frederick William I presented the room to Peter as a gift. Nevertheless, the exterior of the palace had come close to its final form by the mid-18th century. Interior decoration continued, engaging the talents of Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff, Carl von Gontard and many others. The final stage was the erection of the dome in 1845, during the reign of Frederick William IV. The dome was built by Friedrich August Stüler after a design by Karl Friedrich Schinkel.

The Stadtschloss was itself the epicenter of the Revolution of 1848 in Prussia. Huge crowds gathered outside the palace to present an &quot;address to the king&quot; containing their demands for a constitution, liberal reform and German unification. Frederick William IV emerged from the palace to accept their demands. On 18 March, a large demonstration outside the palace led to bloodshed and the outbreak of street fighting. Frederick William later reneged on his promises and reimposed an autocratic regime. From that time onwards, many Berliners and other Germans came to see the palace as a symbol of oppression and &quot;Prussian militarism&quot;.

===History during the German Empire, Weimar Republic and Nazi Era (1871–1945)===
In 1871, King Wilhelm I was elevated to the status of German Emperor (&quot;Kaiser&quot;) of a united Germany, and the Stadtschloss became the symbolic heart of the German Empire. The Empire was (in theory) a constitutional state, and from 1894 onwards, the new Reichstag building, the seat of the German parliament, came to not only rival, but overshadow the Stadtschloss as the Empire&#x27;s centre of power. In conjunction with Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I, Kaiser Wilhelm II was forced to abdicate, both as German Emperor and as King of Prussia. 

In November 1918, during the immediate vacuum of power following the abdication of the Kaiser, Spartacist leader Karl Liebknecht declared a German socialist republic from a balcony of the Stadtschloss. It was an attempt to steer the German revolution towards a communist Germany and stood in contrast to the proclamation of a republic that Philipp Scheidemann of the Social Democratic Party had made a few hours earlier from a balcony of the Reichstag building. The duelling proclamations underscored that the more than 400 years of royal Hohenzollern occupation of the Berlin Palace had come to an end.

During the Weimar Republic, parts of the Stadtschloss were turned into a museum, while other parts continued to be used for receptions and other state functions. Under Adolf Hitler&#x27;s National Socialist (Nazi) Party, which laid to rest monarchist hopes of a Hohenzollern restoration, the building was mostly ignored. During World War II, the Stadtschloss was twice struck by Allied bombs: on 3 and 24 February 1945. On the latter occasion, when both the air defences and fire-fighting systems of Berlin had been destroyed, the building was struck by incendiaries, lost its roof, and was largely burnt out.

===Postwar debate and demolition===
The end of the war saw the Stadtschloss a burned-out shell of its former glory, although the building remained structurally sound and much of its interior decoration was still preserved. It could have been restored, as many other bombed-out buildings in Central Berlin later were. The area in which it was located was within the Soviet zone, which became the German Democratic Republic. The building was used for a Soviet war movie (&quot;the Battle of Berlin&quot;) in which the Stadtschloss served as a backdrop, with live artillery shells fired at it for the realistic cinematic impact.

The new socialist government declared the Stadtschloss a symbol of Prussian militarism, although at that time there appeared to be no plans to destroy the building. Some parts of it were in fact repaired and used from 1945 to 1950 as an exhibition space. A secret 1950 GDR Ministry of Construction report, only rediscovered in 2016, calculated that reconstruction of the damaged Palace could be achieved for 32 million East German marks. But in July 1950 Walter Ulbricht, the new General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, announced the demolition of the palace. Despite objections, its removal commenced in September 1950, the process taking four months and consuming 19 tons of dynamite.

So solid was its construction that the dome and its entire mount remained intact even after the rest of the building fell to the ground. Only one section was preserved, a portal from the balcony from which Karl Liebknecht had declared the German Socialist Republic. In 1964 it was added to the State Council Building, with an altered cartouche, where it forms the main entrance. The empty space where the Stadtschloss had stood was named Marx-Engels-Platz and used as a parade ground.

From 1973 to 1976, during the government of Erich Honecker, a large modernist building was built, the Palast der Republik (Palace of the Republic), which occupied most of the site of the former Stadtschloss.

===Reunification===
Shortly before German reunification in October 1990, the Palast der Republik was found to be contaminated with asbestos and was closed to the public. After reunification, the Berlin city government ordered the removal of the asbestos, a process which was completed by 2003. In November 2003, the German federal government decided to demolish the building and leave the area and the adjacent Marx-Engels Platz (renamed Schlossplatz) as parkland, pending a decision as to its future. Demolition started in February 2006 and was completed in 2009.

The demolition was lengthy because of the presence of additional asbestos, and because the palace acted as a counterbalance to the Berliner Dom, across the street, on the unstable grounds of the Museum Island. East Germans resented the demolition, especially those for whom the Palace of the Republic had been a place of fond memories, or who felt a sense of dislocation in a post-Communist world.

From 2008, until the commencement of construction in 2013, the large area of the original Schlossplatz became a grassed field, laid out on minimal lines, with wooden platforms. At the same time, the Berlin Monument Authority (Landesdenkmalamt) undertook extensive archaeological excavations. Parts of cellars that had been situated in the south-west corner of the former Palace were discovered and it was decided these would be preserved and made accessible to visitors as an &quot;archaeological window&quot;.

===Reconstruction===

====The debate====
Following reunification, a 20-year-long debate commenced as to whether the palace should be reconstructed, and whether this should be in part or whole. Pro-reconstruction lobby groups argued that the rebuilding of the Stadtschloss would restore the unity and integrity of the historic centre of Berlin, which includes the Berliner Dom, the Lustgarten, and the museums of Museum Island. Opponents of the project included those who advocated the retention of the Palast der Republik on the grounds that it was itself of historical significance; those who argued that the area should become a public park; and those who believed that a new building would be a pastiche of former architectural styles, would be an unwelcome symbol of Germany&#x27;s imperial past, and would be unacceptably expensive for no definite economic benefit. Opponents also argued that it would be impossible to accurately reconstruct the exterior and interiors of the building as neither detailed plans nor the necessary craft skills were available. Others disputed this, claiming that sufficient photographic documentation of both existed when the palace was converted to a museum following 1918.

The ideological divide was epitomized by two opposing groups. The Association for the Preservation of the Palace of the Republic (&quot;Verein zur Erhaltung des Palastes der Republik&quot;) championed a renovation of the GDR building that would incorporate a re-creation of the principal western facade of the City Palace, for a multipurpose &quot;people&#x27;s center&quot; similar to the &quot;Centre Pompidou&quot; in Paris. The Berlin City Palace Sponsoring Association (&quot;Förderverein Berliner Stadtschloß&quot;) argued for the complete external reconstruction of the City Palace, as they considered it the only option that would restore the aesthetic and historic ensemble of Berlin&#x27;s heart; it also rejected suggestions that the proposed meticulous reconstruction would be an unauthentic &quot;Disney&quot; replica, as most centuries-old stone buildings are, by dint of aging and repair, at least partial reconstructions; and arguing that the allegation that the present time can only represent itself in its own architectural language, is simply ideology. The Sponsoring Association also drew attention to the observation in the Venice Charter that &quot;historic edifices have a material age and an immaterial significance&quot;: an importance that transcends time and that, provided sufficient documentation for a truly authentic copy exists, justifies their reconstruction to preserve a vital part of urban identity and historical memory.

====Towards construction and additional reconstructions====
An important driving force behind the reconstruction was businessman Wilhelm von Boddien. In 1992, he and Kathleen King von Alvensleben founded, what evolved to be the Berlin City Palace Sponsoring Association – which became the most influential lobby group. The Association accumulated plans that had been believed lost, and funded a research project at Technische Universität Berlin to measure surviving photos and drawings of the palace to create precise architectural plans. In 1993, on the world&#x27;s largest scaffolding assembly, it audaciously erected a &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; mockup of two frontages of the Stadtschloss façade on a 1:1 scale on plastic sheeting. Privately funded by donations and sponsorship, this &quot;&quot; stood for a year and half. Showing a vision of central Berlin lost for fifty years, and how the palace could provide the missing link to the historical ensemble of the Zeughaus, the Altes Museum, and Berlin Cathedral, the spectacle brought the debate to a temporary climax in 1993–94. While opinion continued to remain divided, the association succeeded in winning over many politicians and other key figures to its efforts.

In view of the previous opposition, including high cost, and most importantly, the psychological and political objections, successive German governments had declined to commit themselves to the project. However, by 2002 and 2003, cross-party resolutions of the Bundestag reached a compromise to support at least a partial rebuilding of the Stadtschloss.

In 2007, the Bundestag made a definitive decision about the reconstruction. According to this compromise, which had been drawn up by a commission, three façades of the palace would be rebuilt, but the interior would be a modern structure to serve as a cultural museum and forum. An architectural competition was held, and in 2008 the jury chose the submission by the Italian architect Franco Stella. Some of the internal spaces in Stella&#x27;s design follow the exact proportions of the original state rooms of the palace; this would allow for their reconstruction at a later date should this be desired. The reconstruction also reproduces the original metre-thick width of the outer walls. These have been rebuilt as a sandwiched construction as follows: an inner retaining wall of concrete, followed by a layer of insulation, and an outer wall of brick, sandstone and stucco which replicates the original. Reconstruction of the Renaissance-gabled Pharmacy Wing, which connected to the Stadtschloss on the north side, would be another possible future project.

German government budget cuts delayed the construction of the &quot;Humboldtforum&quot;, as the new palace was titled. The foundation stone was finally laid by President Joachim Gauck in a ceremony on 12 June 2013 which heralded the launch of a €590 million reconstruction project.

In 2017, there was a debate whether to feature a cross on the dome of the palace, in relation to adhering historical accuracy or secularism. Afterwards, a statue of Antinous was installed on the palace façade in the Schlüterhof courtyard. However, the cross was installed on the top of the dome on 29 May 2020.

On completion in 2020, the building housed a museum containing collections of African and other non-European art, as well as two restaurants, a theatre, a cinema, and an auditorium.

In July 2022, the bronze reliefs originally made by Otto Lessing in 1897 and mounted in 1903 were reconstructed and mounted on the Eosander Portal, the originals (like many of the exterior designs), having vanished after the demolition of the City Palace. These were soon followed by the mounting of the reconstructed plaques with the words of Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg, and Frederick I of Prussia, the first Prussian king.

The surrounding area around the Berlin Palace which included the granite &quot;Adlersäule&quot; (Eagle Pillar), the bronze &quot;Rossebändiger&quot; (Horse Tamers), and the &quot;Neptunbrunnen&quot; (Neptune Fountain), collectively called the Schlossplatz, were planned to be redesigned by 2023 in a modern way, that will still be able to bring back the mentioned original items surrounding the palace if desired. These terrace designs ended up being implemented in a more modernistic design, different than the more ornate original design. In front of the Schlossplatz is planned the &quot;Denkmal für Freiheit und Einheit&quot; (Monument to Freedom and Unity).

In early April 2023, the &quot;Große Cartouche&quot; (Great Seal), was mounted on the center of the Eosander Portal, marking the completion of the façade decorations on Portal III.

<doc id="433180" wikidata="Q7754485" url="?curid=433180" title="The Number Painter">
<text>The Number Painter, also known as The Mad Painter, was the title character of a series of comedy live-action short films produced for the children&#x27;s television program &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. This series of slapstick films — each one ran anywhere from one minute to 90 seconds — were used to teach children number recognition, including appearance and symbolic representation of Arabic numerals, and how the number is drawn. As such, &quot;The Number Painter&quot; contrasted with the show&#x27;s other animated and live-action number-related skits, where the primary focus was on counting.

There were ten &quot;Number Painter&quot; skits produced in the series, one each for the numbers 2 through 11. The number 1 skit was not produced, since it was not featured in individual &quot;Sesame Street&quot; segments during the era when the films were produced and aired. Although the numbers showcased up to 12 in this same era, the number 12 film was not produced either, with the number 11 being the last segment in the &quot;Number Painter&quot; series.

The title character and protagonist in these movies, portrayed by Paul Benedict, was an eccentric character who enjoys painting numbers in a series of public and private locations. His outfit consists of a black-and-white striped shirt, gray pants held up with suspenders, black Chuck Taylor Converse sneakers, and a paint-splattered smock, topped with a black bowler hat. He carries a can of paint and a brush, along with a cut-out of the number he intends to paint. The Painter never spoke on-camera, although his thoughts were heard using voice over.

The films were produced in 1971, and the first film in the series — that for the number 2 — aired on February 23, 1972. Given &quot;Sesame Street&#x27;s&quot; format of replaying and recycling its vignettes, the Painter skits continued to be rebroadcast into the 1980s, concurrent with Benedict going on to be a regular in the sitcom &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; and recurring co-star Stockard Channing launching a film and TV career. Robert Dennis composed the jaunty piano score in each of the segments. Eliot Noyes Jr. directed and produced the series.

==Skit format==
The skits in each of the films followed the same basic format. The Painter announces that he is going to paint a specific number, all while scouting out a suitable location to engage in said activity; he would then pull a model of that number from his smock to emphasize its shape to the viewers.

Any one of a number of objects were fair game to the Painter, including sailboat sails, slices of bread, umbrellas, rubber balls, elevator doors and even a bald man&#x27;s head. At one point (in the #8 film), the Painter&#x27;s work became the subject of a dramatic, large-font newspaper headline (&quot;PAINTER STRIKES AGAIN!&quot;). Several of the films ended with the Painter having to deal with people who were upset over his activities.

==Supporting characters==

===Mac===
Portrayed by Broadway actor Jerome Raphael, Mac was the most frequent target of the Number Painter&#x27;s antics. He appeared in seven of the skits, including the owner of a boat (#2), a baker (#6), a passenger in an elevator (#7), an unassuming homeowner enjoying a lazy afternoon in his swimming pool (#8), an operator of a street-cleaning truck (#9), and a janitor (#10 and 11). Usually, Mac managed to foil—either deliberately or unwittingly—the Painter&#x27;s work; only once was the Painter able to get the upper hand—in the #8 film, Mac drowned himself as a result of his defeat. His death was retconned, however, in the next film (#9).

===The Woman===
Stockard Channing — who went on to greater fame in &quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;The West Wing&quot;—appeared in four of the sketches, playing the woman at the picnic (#3); the woman holding the umbrella (#4); the woman inside the elevator having her plastic handbag painted on (#7); and, finally, the doctor saying &quot;Next&quot; to her patients (#11).

<doc id="433184" wikidata="Q6229660" url="?curid=433184" title="John Dolben (politician)">
<text>John Dolben (1662 – 29 May 1710), of Epsom, Surrey, was an English barrister and Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1707 to 1710. He was deeply involved in the impeachment proceedings against Dr Henry Sacheverell in 1710, and his work on the impeachment is said to have contributed to his early demise.

==Early life==
Dolben was the younger son of John Dolben, Archbishop of York, and his wife Catherine Sheldon, daughter of Ralph Sheldon of Stanton, Staffordshire, and niece of Gilbert Sheldon, Archbishop of Canterbury, and was baptised in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, on 1 July 1662. He was educated at Westminster School where he is listed as a pupil in 1676, and with the encouragement of his uncle Sir William Dolben, Recorder of London, was admitted at Inner Temple in 1677. He also matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1678 but is not recorded as a graduate. From 1682 to 1683, he travelled abroad in France. By December 1683, he married Elizabeth Mulso, second daughter and co-heiress of Tanfield Mulso of Finedon Hall, Northamptonshire and his wife Mary Luther. Her portrait was once attributed to Sir Peter Lely, but is now thought to be the work of John Riley, completed after his death by John Closterman. He was called to the bar in 1684. 

Dolben, whose father died in April 1686, squandered his inheritance on gambling. He also squandered his wife&#x27;s fortune, selling his moiety of the manor of Finedon around this time to his elder brother, Sir Gilbert Dolben, 1st Baronet, who had married John&#x27;s sister-in-law, Anne Mulso. In 1691, Sir Gilbert wrote that John&#x27;s wife and children were reduced to living on the charity of friends. He also complained that their father&#x27;s memory was being unfairly traduced, as critics said that John&#x27;s conduct was the result of a bad upbringing. Their uncle Sir William Dolben, who had intended to leave a legacy to John Dolben, was so outraged by his profligacy that he cut him out of his will, and settled the legacy in trust for John&#x27;s children.

==Career==
In 1692, Dolben moved to the East Indies, where he became judge-advocate for the East India Company in Bengal and was later a friend of Thomas Pitt, the Governor. He was able to profit by the trading opportunities available to repair his fortune. He went on a voyage to China in 1699 with one of Pitt&#x27;s sons. By July 1701, he returned to England and corresponded with Pitt on the affairs of the East India Companies. In about 1702 he went back to the East Indies until 1706. Back in England, he was trusted by Pitt to conduct his affairs.

Dolben was returned as Member of Parliament for Liskeard on the interest of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet, Bishop of Winchester at a by-election on 21 November 1707. He immediately proved to be a conscientious MP, and was active on ten committees. Most important of these was the bill to extend the East India Company Act and he was particularly concerned about uniting the two East India companies. He put forward a proposal which involved increasing the company&#x27;s loan to the government by £200,000 and the bill passed into law. He was suspected of working towards replacing Pitt as Governor, but after he reported to Pitt the successful unification of the two companies, he noted that the Company was enraged at the extra sum which he was seen being responsible for imposing on it.
At the 1708 British general election Dolben was returned unopposed for Liskeard again and continued to be very active. He was named to nine drafting committees, including the bill to prevent wagers relating to the public. In spite of this, Dolben himself was still an avid gambler and was forecast to be required to make another trip to the Indies to recover his fortune. He managed a bill to establish a company trading in Africa, and was a teller for the Whigs on ten occasions. He voted for naturalizing the German Palatines in 1709 and was trustee for poor Palatines. 

It was Dolben who first raised the issue of Henry Sacheverell&#x27;s printed sermons on 13 December 1709, moving that the House should take the matter into consideration, and that the sermons should be voted &#x27;malicious, scandalous and seditious libels&#x27;. In the debate on the next day, he moved that Sacheverell should be impeached. He was appointed to the committee to draw up the articles of impeachment, and acted as chairman. At the trial itself, he acted as one of the managers. He got into some difficulties from his conduct during the trial, while the mob threatened to burn down his house and hang him on a tree. The mob pulled down the clock at Liskeard Town Hall which he had presented to the town. As well as showing great energy in this role, he was active in other Parliamentary business, including sitting on committees and telling for the Whigs. He was also appointed a Director of the Bank of England in 1710.

==Literature of the Sacheverell trial==
Among the pamphlets relating to Dolben are:

* &quot;A Letter written by Mr. J. Dolbin to Dr. Henry Sacheverell, and left by him with a friend at Epsom&quot;, 1710, p. 16; composed as a letter of repentance.
* &quot;A true Defence of Henry Sacheverell, D.D., in a Letter to Mr. D——n [Dolben]. By S. M. N. O.&quot;, 1710.
* &quot;An Elegy on the lamented Death of John Dolben&quot;.
* &quot;The Life and Adventures of John Dolben&quot;, 1710, pp. 16.

==Later life and legacy==
Dolben worked himself to the point where his health gave way, and he retired to the country. He also gave up the directorship of the Bank of England. He then contracted a fever, and it was said he was worse treated by his physicians than by the mob, and died on 29 May 1710, unlamented by Dr Sacheverell’s friends. He was buried in Finedon Church under a large grey-marble tombstone. His two sons died abroad in his lifetime (William, the elder, whose portrait was painted by Godfrey Kneller in 1709 and engraved by Smith in 1710, dying in 1709, aged 20), and Mary, one of his three daughters, died on 24 June 1710, aged 8. His widow survived until 4 March 1736. Their two surviving daughters, Anne and Catherine, were married in Westminster Abbey. Anne married the politician Gilbert Affleck of Dalham Hall, Suffolk, and Catherine married Samuel Whitelocke, grandson of Bulstrode Whitelocke.

<text>Kairouan (, ), also spelled El Qayrawān or Kairwan ( , ), is the capital of the Kairouan Governorate in Tunisia and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city was founded by the Umayyads around 670, in the period of Caliph Mu&#x27;awiya (reigned 661–680); this is when it became an important centre for Sunni Islamic scholarship and Quranic learning, attracting Muslims from various parts of the world. The Mosque of Uqba is situated in the city.

==Etymology==
The name ( &quot;al-Qayrawān&quot;) is an Arabic word meaning &quot;military group&quot; or &quot;caravan&quot;, borrowed early on from the Middle Persian word &quot;kārawān&quot; (modern Persian &quot;kârvân&quot;), meaning &quot;military column&quot; (&quot;kâr&quot; &quot;people/military&quot; + &quot;vân&quot; &quot;outpost&quot;) or &quot;caravan&quot; (see caravanserai). In Berber, the city used to be called &quot;Tikirwan&quot;, thought to be an adaptation of the Arabic name. It has also been romanized as Cairoan in early modern English.

==History==
=== Foundation and early Islamic period ===
The foundation of Kairouan dates to about the year 670 when the Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi of Caliph Mu&#x27;awiya selected a site in the middle of a dense forest, then infested with wild beasts and reptiles, as the location of a military post for the conquest of the West. Formerly, the city of Kamounia was located where Kairouan now stands. It had housed a Byzantine garrison before the Arab conquest, and stood far from the sea – safe from the continued attacks of the Berbers who had fiercely resisted the Arab invasion. Berber resistance continued, led first by Kusaila, whose troops killed Uqba at Biskra about fifteen years after the establishment of the military post, and then by a Berber woman called Al-Kahina who was killed and her army defeated in 702. Subsequently, there occurred a mass conversion of the Berbers to Islam. Kharijites or Islamic &quot;outsiders&quot; who formed an egalitarian and puritanical sect appeared and are still present on the island of Djerba.

In October 741, in the course of the Great Berber Revolt in the Maghreb, the Ifriqiyan army, along with a Syrian force dispatched by the caliph, was destroyed by the Berbers at the Battle of Bagdoura. The governor Kulthum ibn Iyad al-Qasi perished in the field, his nephew and successor Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri was holed up with the remnant of the army in Spain, leaving the whole of Ifriqiya open to the advance of the Berber rebels. Not having any more forces at his disposal, the Umayyad Caliph Hisham quickly appointed Handhala ibn Safwan as governor of Ifriqiya, with supervisory authority over all the Maghreb (North Africa west of Egypt) and al-Andalus (Spain), and instructed him to take whatever forces he could gather to defend Ifriqiya and quash the Berber rebellion. Leaving Egypt in the hand of Hafs ibn al-Walid ibn Yusuf al-Hadrami, Handhala set out westwards in February 742, picking up additional forces from Barqa (Cyrenaica) and Tripoli (Tripolitana). He arrived in Kairouan around April, 742. The qadi of Ifriqiya, Abd al-Rahman ibn Oqba al-Ghaffari, had been managing the defense of Kairouan, and succeeded in fending off an attack by the Berber rebel army raised in southern Tunisia by the Sufrite leader Oqasha ibn Ayub al-Fezari. Handhala ibn Safwan arrived in Kairouan just as Oqasha was said to be mounting a new attack, in coordination with another large Berber army coming in from the west, led by Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid al-Hawwari. The Berber rebel armies were to make junction in front of Kairouan, before launching their final attack on the city. Wasting no time, Handhala dispatched a cavalry force to slow down Abd al-Wahid&#x27;s progress, and threw the bulk of his forces south, defeating Oqasha in a bloody battle at El-Qarn and taking him prisoner. But Handhala had taken a lot of losses himself, and now faced the unhappy prospect of Abd al-Wahid&#x27;s gigantic army, said to be some 300,000, ostensibly the largest Berber army ever seen. Hurrying back, Handhala is said to have put the entire population of Kairouan under arms to bolster his ranks, before setting out again. In perhaps the bloodiest encounter in the Berber wars, Handhala ibn Safwan defeated the great Berber army of Abd al-Wahid ibn Yazid at al-Asnam in May 742 (perhaps a little later), just three miles outside of Kairouan. Some 120,000–180,000 Berbers, including Abd al-Wahid, fell in the field of battle in that single encounter.

=== Aghlabid period ===
In 745, Kharijite Berbers captured Kairouan, which was already at that time a developed city with luxuriant gardens and olive groves. Power struggles continued until Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab recaptured Kairouan at the end of the 8th century.

In 800 Caliph Harun ar-Rashid in Baghdad confirmed Ibrahim as &quot;emir&quot; and hereditary ruler of Ifriqiya. Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab founded the Aghlabid dynasty which ruled Ifriqiya between 800 and 909. The new emirs embellished Kairouan and made it their capital. It soon became famous for its wealth and prosperity, reaching the levels of Basra and Kufa and giving Tunisia a period of power and prosperity.

The Aghlabids built the great mosque and established in it a university that was a centre of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences. Its role can be compared to that of the University of Paris in the Middle Ages. In the 9th century, the city became a brilliant focus of Arab and Islamic cultures attracting scholars from all over the Islamic World. In that period Imam Sahnun and Asad ibn al-Furat made of Kairouan a temple of knowledge and a magnificent centre of diffusion of Islamic sciences. The Aghlabids also built palaces, fortifications and fine waterworks of which only the pools remain. From Kairouan envoys from Charlemagne and the Holy Roman Empire returned with glowing reports of the Aghlabid palaces, libraries and gardens – and from the crippling taxation imposed to pay for their drunkenness and sundry debaucheries. The Aghlabids also pacified the country and conquered Sicily in 827.

=== Fatimid and Zirid period ===
In 893, through the mission of Abdullah al Mahdi, the Kutama Berbers from the west of the country started the movement of the Shiite Fatimids. The year 909 saw the overthrow of the Sunni Aghlabids who ruled Ifriqiya and the establishment of the Fatimid dynasty. During the rule of the Fatimids, Kairouan was neglected and lost its importance: the new rulers resided first in Raqqada but soon moved their capital to the newly built Al Mahdiyah on the eastern coast of Tunisia. After succeeding in extending their rule over all of central Maghreb, an area consisting of the modern countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, they eventually moved east to Egypt to found Cairo making it the capital of their vast Caliphate and leaving the Zirids as their vassals in Ifriqiya. Governing again from Kairouan, the Zirids led the country through another artistic, commercial and agricultural heyday. Schools and universities flourished, overseas trade in local manufactures and farm produce ran high and the courts of the Zirids rulers were centres of refinement that eclipsed those of their European contemporaries. When the Zirids declared their independence from Cairo and their conversion to Sunni Islam in 1045 by giving allegiance to Baghdad, the Fatimid Caliph Ma&#x27;ad al-Mustansir Billah sent as punishment hordes of troublesome Arab tribes (Banu Hilal and Banu Sulaym) to invade Ifriqiya. These invaders so utterly captured Kairouan from the Zirids in 1057 and destroyed it that it never regained its former importance and their influx was a major factor in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant. Some 1,700 years of intermittent but continual progress was undone within a decade as in most part of the country the land was laid to waste for nearly two centuries.

=== Later history ===
Al-Idrisi described the city in the 12th century:The city of Kairouan is the mother of settlements and the capital of regions. It was once the greatest city of the West in its expanse, the most populous, the wealthiest, the most prosperous, the most finely built, and the most ambitious, with the most profitable trade, the highest tax revenues, the most flourishing markets, and the greatest commercial gains, while its people were also the most rebellious and the most arrogant of the ignorant, yet among its virtuous elite, the dominant qualities were adherence to righteousness, fulfillment of covenants, avoidance of doubtful matters, abstention from prohibitions, mastery of refined sciences, and an inclination toward moderation. But God Almighty afflicted it with the Arabs, and calamities befell it one after another, until nothing remained of it but fading ruins and obliterated traces. In our present time, only a portion of it is enclosed by an earthen wall. Its rulers are Arabs, who collect whatever revenues remain. A few people still reside there, engaged in modest trade with meager benefits. Scholars speculate that it will soon return to its former state of prosperity and grandeur. Its water supply is scarce, and its inhabitants drink from the great cistern (majel) within the city. This cistern is an architectural marvel, as it is built in a square shape with a tower-like structure rising in the center. Each side measures two hundred cubits, and it remains filled with water. Kairouan was originally two cities: one was Kairouan itself, and the other was Sabra. Sabra was the royal residence, and at the height of its prosperity, it contained three hundred baths—most of them private, while the rest were public for all people. Sabra, however, is now in complete ruin, devoid of any inhabitants.

In the 13th century under the prosperous Hafsids dynasty that ruled Ifriqiya, the city started to emerge from its ruins. It is only under the Husainid Dynasty that Kairouan started to find an honorable place in the country and throughout the Islamic world.

In 1881, Kairouan was taken by the French, after which non-Muslims were allowed access to the city. The French built the Sousse–Kairouan Decauville railway, which operated from 1882 to 1996, before it was regauged to gauge.

The old city of Kairouan and its associated historic monuments became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988.

In December 2023, about 30m of wall near the Gate of the Leather Workers collapsed during restoration. Three masons were killed, and several others injured.

==Geography==

=== Location ===
Kairouan, the capital of Kairouan Governorate, lies south of Sousse, from the east coast, from Monastir and from Tunis.

=== Climate ===
Kairouan has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh&quot;).
== Demographics ==
In 2014, the city had about 187,000 inhabitants.

==Religion==

Between the 9th and 11th centuries AD, Kairouan functioned as one of the great centers of Islamic civilization and gained a reputation as a hotbed of scholarship across the entire Maghreb. During this period, the Great Mosque of Kairouan became both a place of prayer and a center for teaching Islamic sciences under the Maliki current. A unique religious tradition practiced in Kairouan was the use of Islamic law to enforce monogamy by stipulating it in the marriage contract. Local tradition holds that seven pilgrimages to the Great Mosque equals one pilgrimage to Mecca. According to some, this makes Kairouan the fourth holiest city in Islam after Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem. As of 2004, the city contained 89 mosques. Sufi festivals are held in the city in memory of saints.

Before the arrival of the French in 1881, non-Muslims were forbidden from living in Kairouan. A Christian community had existed during the early 11th century alongside Jews who were among the original settlers of Kairouan. The Jewish community&#x27;s golden era began in the late 8th century and lasted until the early 11th century during which time it played an important role in Jewish history, having been a world center of Talmudic and Halakhic scholarship for at least three generations. The Banu Hilal conquest of Kairouan in 1057 led to the decline of the medieval community with Jews only returning after Tunisia was established as a French protectorate in 1881. By the 1960s the community had disappeared, and all that remains is their dilapidated cemetery.

==Main sights==

===Great Mosque of Kairouan===
The city&#x27;s main landmark is the Great Mosque of Sidi-Uqba (also known as the Great Mosque of Kairouan) which is one of the most impressive and largest Islamic monuments in North Africa. Originally built when Kairouan was founded in 670 AD, the mosque currently occupies an area of over and is one of the oldest places of worship in the Islamic world. The mosque became a center of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences and helped the city to develop and expand.

===Mosque of the Three Doors===
The Mosque of the Three Doors was founded in 866. Its façade is a notable example of Islamic architecture. It has three arched doorways surmounted by three inscriptions in Kufic script, interspersed with floral and geometrical reliefs and topped by a carved frieze; the first inscription includes the verses 70–71 in the sura 33 of Quran. The small minaret was added during the restoration works held under the Hafsid dynasty. The prayer hall has a nave and two aisles, divided by arched columns, parallel to the qibla wall.

===Mosque of the Barber===
The Zawiya of Sidi Sahib, also known as the Mosque of the Barber, is a religious complex containing the mausoleum of Abu Zama&#x27; al-Balawi, a companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, who, according to legend, had saved for himself three hairs of Muhammad&#x27;s beard, hence the edifice&#x27;s name. The complex was first built up in the 14th century under the Hafsids, but in its present state it dates from the 17th century, under the Muradids. The tomb chamber is accessed from a cloister-like court with rich tile and stucco decoration. In addition to the mausoleum, the complex includes a madrasa and several other facilities.

=== Aghlabid basins ===
The Aghlabid basins are a Tunisian historical monument located in Kairouan. Dating from the 9th century and located outside the ramparts of the medina of Kairouan, they are considered to be the most important hydraulic systems in the history of the Muslim world. The structure covers an area of 11,000 square meters and consists of a small settling basin, a large basin for storing water and two drawing tanks, all having a total storage capacity of 68,800 cubic meters.

== Economy ==
The primary economic sectors in Kairouan are industry, agriculture and tourism.

=== Industry ===
The Kairouan region currently has 167 industrial companies offering more than 10,000 jobs, of which 33 are fully exporters.
The industrial activities of the region are quite diversified, although the agrifood industry sector is preeminent with 91 units.

=== Agriculture ===
The governorate of Kairouan is known mainly for the production of vegetables (peppers, tomatoes) and fruits (apricots, almonds and olives). It is the leading national producer of chili peppers with nearly 90,000 tonnes in 2019, as well as apricots with more than 15,000 tonnes.

<text>Henry Charles Beck (4 June 190218 September 1974) was an English technical draughtsman who created the first diagrammatic London Underground Tube map in 1931. Beck drew the diagram after being laid off by the Signalling Department of Underground Electric Railways of London. 

Although his design was initially rejected, the Publicity Office of London Transport changed their minds after Beck resubmitted an updated copy and the map was first issued as a pocket edition in January 1933. It was immediately popular, and the Underground has used topological maps to illustrate the network ever since. Harry Beck wanted to make the network easier to understand by colouring each train route and using straight lines and 45 degree angles.

== Biography ==
Henry Charles Beck was born on 4 June 1902 in Leyton, to Eleanor Louisa Beck (née Crouch) and Joshua Beck. Brought up and educated in Highgate Village, he started his career in the 1920s as an engineering draughtsman with the London Underground Signals Office, where he primarily worked on schematics for electrical systems.

In 1931, while unemployed, he developed his simplified map of the Underground system, which was initially rejected but later accepted. In 1933, he married Nora Beck, and in 1947, he began teaching typography and colour design at the London School of Printing and Kindred Trades, where he remained until retirement. He died in Southampton on 18 September 1974.

== London Underground map ==
=== Before Beck ===

Prior to the Beck diagram (the underground map that he created), the various underground lines had been laid out geographically, often superimposed over the roadway of a city map. This meant the centrally located stations were shown very close together and the out-of-town stations spaced far apart. From around 1909 a new type of &#x27;map&#x27; appeared inside the train cars; it was a non-geographic linear diagram, in most cases a simple straight horizontal line, which equalized the distances between stations. 

By the late 1920s most Underground lines and some mainline (especially LNER) services displayed these, many of which had been drawn by George Dow. Some writers and broadcasters have speculated that Dow&#x27;s maps partly inspired Beck&#x27;s work. The geographical-based map, used immediately prior to Beck, in 1932, was produced by the underground map designer for the period 1926–1932, F. H. Stingemore. It was Stingemore&#x27;s idea to slightly expand the central area of the map for ease of reading.

=== Beck&#x27;s concept ===

It was however, Beck who had the idea of creating a full system map in colour. He believed that Underground passengers were not concerned with geographical accuracy and were more interested in how to get from one station to another and where to change trains. While drawing an electrical circuit diagram, Beck came up with a new idea for a map that was based upon the concept of an electrical schematic on which all the stations were more-or-less equally spaced rather than a geographic map. Beck first submitted his idea to Frank Pick of London Underground in 1931 but it was considered too radical because it did not show distances relative from any one station to the others. The design was therefore rejected by the Publicity department at first, but the designer persisted. So, after a successful trial of 500 copies in 1932, distributed via a few select stations, the map was given its first full publication in 1933 (700,000 copies). The positive reaction from customers proved it was a sound design, and a large reprint was required after only one month.

It is suggested by Degani (2013) that one of the configuration techniques employed by Beck was that of an &quot;underlying grid&quot;. In some cases the vertical and horizontal grid units are equalised, but on the whole the grid is rectilinear. The result is a &quot;relaxed grid ... which has a certain rhythm and charm – somewhat similar to the grid used by modern artists (e.g. Piet Mondrian&#x27;s painting &quot;Composition with Red, Blue and Yellow&quot;, 1937–42.)&quot;

=== The map after Beck ===

Beck tried to regain control of the map through threatening legal action, but in 1965 he abandoned the attempt, &quot;bitter and betrayed by the very organisation he had helped, so admirably, to promote.&quot; In 1997, Beck&#x27;s importance was posthumously recognised, and currently (2022) the statement &#x27;This diagram is an evolution of the original design conceived in 1931 by Harry Beck&#x27; is printed on every London Underground map.

=== Design Icon ===
As part of the Transported by Design programme of activities, on 15 October 2015, after two months of public voting, Harry Beck&#x27;s tube map was elected by Londoners as number 3 of the 10 favourite transport design icons.

== Other works ==
In 1938 he produced a diagram of the entire rail system of the London region (as far as St Albans in the north, Ongar in the north east, Romford in the east, Bromley in the south east, Mitcham in the south, Hinchley Wood in the south west, Ashford in the west, and Tring in the north west). It included both the Underground and mainlines. It was not published at the time but was seen in Ken Garland&#x27;s book, first published in 1994; it took until 1973 until any official attempt was made to replicate a rail diagram for the entire London region.

Beck produced at least one map for British Railways. After nationalisation, the Eastern Region commissioned Beck to produce a map of the suburban lines out of Marylebone, King&#x27;s Cross, Liverpool Street and Fenchurch Street, similar in scope to earlier maps produced by George Dow for the London &amp; North Eastern Railway.

Beck produced at least two versions of a diagram for the Paris Métro. The project, which Beck was never commissioned to do, may have been begun, according to Ken Garland, as early as before the start of World War II. A version dating from approximately 1946 is published in Garland&#x27;s book. His second version is published for the first time in Mark Ovenden&#x27;s book about the Paris Métro.

== Recognition ==
According to some accounts, Beck was never formally commissioned to develop his initial idea and worked on the map only in his spare time. He was thus never actually paid for the map. Other sources report that he was paid a fee of five or ten guineas.

London Regional Transport created the Beck gallery at the London Transport Museum in the early 1990s, where his works are displayed. A commemorative plaque was installed at Finchley Central Underground station. Beck&#x27;s home at 60 Court House Road, Finchley was marked with a plaque by the Finchley Society in 2003.

In March 2006 viewers of BBC2&#x27;s &quot;The Culture Show&quot; and visitors to London&#x27;s Design Museum voted Harry Beck&#x27;s Tube map as their second-favourite British design of the 20th century in the Great British Design Quest. The winner was Concorde.

GB Railfreight named locomotive 66721 after Beck in January 2007.

In January 2009 the Royal Mail included Beck&#x27;s map when it issued a set of postage stamps celebrating British design classics.

In March 2013 a blue plaque was unveiled on the house where Beck was born, in Wesley Road in Leyton, to mark the 80th anniversary of the Tube map.

In 2021, a play, &quot;The Truth About Harry Beck,&quot; was staged at the Theatre Royal Bath&#x27;s Ustinov Studio. The play portrays Beck’s journey to create the Tube map and the challenges he faced along the way, focusing on his commitment, and the role of his wife, Nora, in supporting his work. In 2024, the play was staged at the London Transport Museum’s Cubic Theatre.

<doc id="433194" wikidata="Q3568958" url="?curid=433194" title="William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness">
<text>William Sinclair (1410–1480), 1st [[Earl of Caithness]] (1455–1476), last [[Earl of Orkney#Scottish Jarls under the Norwegian Crown|Earl (Jarl) of Orkney]] (1434–1470 de facto, –1472 de jure), 2nd [[Lord Sinclair]] and 11th [[Baron of Roslin]] was a Norwegian and Scottish nobleman and the builder of Rosslyn Chapel, in Midlothian.

In &quot;The Scots Peerage&quot; by James Balfour Paul he is designated as the 1st Lord Sinclair, but historian Roland Saint-Clair designates him the 2nd Lord Sinclair in reference to his father, Henry II Sinclair, Earl of Orkney, being the first person recorded as Lord Sinclair by public records.

==Early life==

He was the son of Henry II Sinclair, Earl of Orkney and Egidia Douglas, daughter of Sir William Douglas of Nithsdale and maternal granddaughter of Robert II of Scotland. He was also the grandson of Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney.

His father Henry, who had been a de facto Jarl of Orkney, died in 1420; William travelled to Copenhagen in 1422 to establish his claim to the Jarldom, but David Menzies was appointed instead, to rule as William&#x27;s guardian until he came of age. In 1424, William succeeded in wresting de facto control of the earldom from his guardian, but it was not until 1434 that he was acknowledged as Jarl of Orkney by King Eric VII of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, sovereign of Orkney.

==Earl of Orkney==

On succeeding to the Earldom of Orkney, William had barely been in possession of it for a year when he was one of five earls selected to be among twenty hostages, proposed on 31 May 1421, for the redemption of James I of Scotland. When that redemption could not be obtained, he was then placed on the list of nobles who received a passport to visit James I, who was then a prisoner in England. The earl received a safe conduct for himself and twenty-four persons. James I returned to Scotland in 1424 and he was met at Durham by the Earl of Orkney as well as the Earls of Lennox, Wigtown, Moray, Crawford, March, Angus and Stratherne.

In 1423, David Menzies of Wemyss, chief of the Clan Menzies and uncle of William, was entrusted by King Eric with the administration of the Isles, and the Bishop of Orkney subscribed to this obligation as surety. However, due to disorder during the reign of Menzies, the government of the earldom was reinstated to the Bishop for seven years until the young Earl William could formally receive his investiture. However, the young William had taken the title of earl before receiving his investiture as he is styled as Earl of Orkney in 1426 at the assize in Stirling, and again in 1428 when he was present at Edinburgh dealing with a complaint made by his mother regarding the spoilation of her Nithsdale possessions.

In 1434, William crossed over to Denmark and King Eric granted investiture to him for the Earldom of Orkney. Earl William was also to hold Kirkwall Castle for the king and his successors. In the same year James I of Scotland&#x27;s daughter, Margaret, was betrothed to Louis, Dauphin of France and Charles VII of France then arranged for Margaret to be escorted back to France. The King of Scotland ordered that all should be ready by 20 June, and William, Earl of Orkney had forty-six ships in readiness to transport Margaret and her train. The fleet that carried her to her future kingdom was commanded by the Earl of Orkney.

In 1446, the Earl of Orkney laid the foundation stone of the Collegiate Church of St Matthew, commonly referred to as Rosslyn Chapel. In the same year the Earl of Orkney was called to the Norwegian Riksråd to take the oath of Christopher of Bavaria who was the successor of King Eric of Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

After the death of childless King Christopher of Norway in 1448, Earl William was mentioned as a possible candidate for the vacant throne, as the jarl of Orkney was the highest ranking nobleman in Norway. However, there are no indications that he pursued this claim. The same year the Earl of Orkney appears obtaining the patronage of the chapel of Saint Duthac in Kirkwall.

In 1454–55, the Earls of Orkney and Angus laid siege to Abercorn Castle with 6,000 men because Lord Hamilton was in league with the rebel Earl of Douglas. Hamilton was taken by the royal camp and the Earl of Orkney kept him in honourable captivity in Roslin Castle for a few days until he defected from the House of Douglas.

On 15 November 1456, the earl&#x27;s father-in-law, Alexander Sutherland of Dunbeath, made his will in the earl&#x27;s presence at Roslin Castle. The earl had married Sutherland&#x27;s daughter Marjory, by Sutherland&#x27;s wife Mariota, daughter of Donald of Islay, Lord of the Isles.

James II of Scotland died in 1460 and the Earl of Orkney was elected as one of six Governors for the government during the minority of the young James III of Scotland.

In 1468, James III of Scotland married Margaret, daughter of Christian I of Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Christian was unable to immediately provide a dowry. Instead, he promised that dowry would be provided at a later date, pledging the territory of the Jarldom of Orkney as security for his promise. The sovereignty of Orkney therefore transferred from Norway to Scotland. In 1470, James III offered William the castle and lands of Ravenscraig in Fife, in return for William quitclaiming his rights in Orkney and Shetland, an offer William accepted.

The Norse jarldom technically remained in existence, but William now only had authority over the mainland parts - Caithness and Sutherland. In 1472, it having become clear that the dowry was unlikely to be paid, James declared the Jarldom&#x27;s territory to be forfeit to the Scottish Crown, to which it was annexed by an act of the Parliament of Scotland on 20 February. William now wielded his authority under the king of Scotland, rather than of Norway.

==Earl of Caithness==

Exchanging his inherited lordship of Nithsdale for lands in Caithness, William was granted the hereditary title Earl of Caithness in 1455. He resigned the Earldom in favour of his second son from his second marriage, William, in 1476.

William, Earl of Orkney died before 3 July 1480.

==Family==

William Sinclair was married three times: firstly to Lady Elizabeth Douglas, daughter of Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas; secondly to Marjory Sutherland (married 1456), daughter of Alexander Sutherland of Dunbeath; and thirdly to Janet Yeman.

By Lady Elizabeth Douglas he had the following children:

#William Sinclair, 3rd Lord Sinclair who was reportedly disinherited by his father, only receiving Ravenscraig Castle in Fife. 
#Lady Catherine Sinclair, who married Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany.
#Elizabeth Sinclair, who married Andrew, Master of Rothes

By Marjory Sutherland he had the following children:

#Oliver St Clair, 12th Baron of Roslin, who received the Barony of Roslin.
#William Sinclair, 2nd Earl of Caithness (b. 1460 - d. 1513)
#Alexander Sinclair ()
#George Sinclair ()
#Robert Sinclair (1447)
#Arthur Sinclair ()
#Lady Eleanor Sinclair (b. 1457- d. 1518), who married John Stewart, 1st Earl of Atholl.
#Lady Elizabeth Sinclair (b. - d. 1498), who married the Laird of Houston.
#Lady Margaret Sinclair (), who married David Boswell of Balmuto.
#Lady Katherine Sinclair (b. 1440 - d. 1479)
#Lady Susan Sinclair ()
#Lady Marjory Sinclair (1455–80), married Andrew Leslie, Master of Rothes. With Andrew she had issue including William Leslie, 3rd Earl of Rothes
#Lady Mariota Sinclair ()
#Lady Euphemia Sinclair (), who married John Kincaid Laird of Warriston.

Illegitimate:
#Sir David Sinclair of Sumburgh, died 1507.

The earl&#x27;s second son of his second marriage, William Sinclair, became the designated heir of the Earldom of Caithness, and continued that title. The Barony of Roslin went to his first son by that marriage, Sir Oliver Sinclair.

<doc id="433196" wikidata="Q16997478" url="?curid=433196" title="Ives Manufacturing Company">
<text>The Ives Manufacturing Company, an American toy manufacturer from 1868 to 1932, was the largest manufacturer of toy trains in the United States from 1910 until 1924, when Lionel Corporation overtook it in sales.

==Early history==
Ives was founded in Plymouth, Connecticut by Edward Ives, a descendant of Plymouth colony governor William Bradford. The company initially produced paper dolls whose limbs moved in response to hot air, but soon began producing a wide range of toys, including a toy cannon that shot using real gunpowder and also toy clockwork powered dolls and animals that could move. The clockwork toys were designed by Jerome Secor, Nathan Warner, and Arthur Hotchkiss and by the 1880s, Ives was a leading producer of these toys.

Its emphasis shifted to trains as its designs were copied by other toymakers who were willing to sell them more cheaply. Ives&#x27; trains were made of tin or cast iron and initially powered by clockwork, and later electric trains

On December 22, 1900, a disastrous fire struck and destroyed the Ives &amp; Williams Company main factory, destroying the building and all the patterns, parts and tools for manufacturing the cast-iron toys. The fire prompted a re-design by William R. Haberlin for 1901 that resulted in Ives&#x27; first toy train that ran on track. In 1901, The Ives Manufacturing Company, in a space rented from William R. Haberlin and Timothy F. Hayes, began producing the first &quot;O&quot; gauge trains in the United States to run on a fabricated sectional track. The trains were powered by clockwork machinery inside the toy, and sales for the year totaled $2,600 (equivalent to about $94,000 of purchasing power in today&#x27;s money). In 1901 and 1902, the die stamping production of trains, cars and track was subcontracted out to Haberlin and Hayes Bridgeport Tool &amp; Die. In the end, the fire benefited the Ives Manufacturing Company, as the insurance money permitted it to build a modern factory with state-of-the-art tooling.

Although several companies were selling electric trains at the time, Ives opted to remain with clockwork, partly because many U.S. homes still lacked electricity.

Initially, Ives&#x27; greatest competition came from German imports, and not from domestic manufacturers. Ives&#x27; response was with a marketing campaign targeting the American twelve-year-old boy, which was their ideal demographic. Its campaigns addressed boys as business partners, telling them that the success of Ives&#x27; fictional railroad, Ives Railway Lines, depended on their shrewd management. The campaign succeeded in building brand loyalty for the company, and they would go on to become the largest manufacturer of toy trains from 1910 until Lionel overtook them in sales in 1924.

==William R. Haberlin==
William R. Haberlin is the man who made all of the tools and dies for the original Ives O-gauge (&quot;O&quot; gauge) clockwork train line in 1901. Aside from the patterns for the iron locomotives bodies (made by Charles A. Hotchkiss, mentioned in Model Craftsman - March 1944) and the clockwork mechanisms themselves (manufactured by The Reeves Manufacturing Company in New Haven, Connecticut, later in Milford, Connecticut), everything that went into this line was tooled up by Haberlin and his partner, T.F. Hayes (Timothy F. Hayes), in their tool shop, the Hayes &amp; Haberlin Machine Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

The work included the first tools and machinery ever built in the United States for manufacturing tinplate track. The first year, as Ives was in a hurry to get track, a set of drop-hammers were made up for the rails and ties. The tinplate was first cut up into strips and then placed under the drop-hammer. The next year Haberlin and Hayes made up regular dies for use in a punch press, which would cut the rails and ties out of sheet tin. Thirty thousand rails could be made in a day; a working day in 1902 being ten hours. Ives did not make a machine for rolling their rails until somewhat later (In 1907-1908, after Haberlin had left the Ives&#x27; Manufacturing Company to work for Sir Thomas Edison as a toolmaker/machinist with his brother John E. Haberlin in Edison&#x27;s laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey).

Haberlin later went on to work for Ives entirely, using his expertise as a tool maker to design and machine all of their early dies. When he decided to work for the company, Ives bought his tool shop, Hayes &amp; Haberlin Machine Company, to assist the transition. In 1906, Haberlin left Ives and started making up dies for himself, founding the American Miniature Railway Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut (which was both Ives&#x27; and Haberlin&#x27;s hometown) on April 6, 1907. The company would be one of the least known of the early American tinplate manufacturers, only gaining recent notoriety. Having designed and built the original line, Haberlin&#x27;s new company would create and manufacture a similar line to Ives until 1912.

==Electric trains==
Ives released its first electric trains in 1910, partially in response to companies such as American Flyer undercutting its prices on clockwork trains. Ives initially produced electric trains in O gauge and 1 gauge.

Ives&#x27; train sales continued to decline in the face of increasing competition and Lionel&#x27;s greater momentum, the latter having released its first electric trains nearly a decade earlier. Meanwhile, construction toys were gaining in popularity, so in an effort to re-diversify, Ives released a Meccano and Erector Set-like construction toy in 1913 named Struktiron. Although it offered parts its competition did not, the set was not very successful and Ives withdrew it from the market in 1917.

World War I had mixed effects on the company. On one hand, it eliminated imports from Germany, increasing Ives&#x27; share of the market. However, Ives&#x27; geographic location made it difficult to bring in the materials it needed to make trains, as well as shipping finished products. Lionel and American Flyer, being headquartered in New York City and Chicago, respectively, did not face that challenge. Additionally, Ives&#x27; isolation made it impossible for Ives to gain lucrative wartime government manufacturing contracts. As a result, Ives did not benefit financially from the war.

After the war, Ives, along with competitors Lionel and American Flyer, lobbied successfully for protective tariffs to promote the fledgling American toy train industry. As a result, there was very little foreign competition after World War I, especially at the high end of the market where Ives had positioned itself.

The seasonal nature of train sales continued to cause concern for Ives, and Harry Ives, Edward Ives&#x27; son and successor, sought one last time to diversify by selling toy boats, which he hoped would support the company through strong summer sales. The first boats, released in 1917, were powered by a clockwork engine from an Ives O gauge locomotive. However, the designs were unrealistic looking, lacking the costly detail that was the highlight of competing German designs, and had a tendency to sink easily. Additionally, since Ives did not use a primer when painting the boats, the paint flaked off easily. Ives had difficulty adapting its methods for designing and building trains to work for boats. Despite the problems, Ives continued producing the boats until 1928. Few Ives boats exist today, but it is unclear whether this was due to lack of popularity or their propensity to sink.

Harry Ives had a heated professional relationship with Lionel founder Joshua Lionel Cowen, in which they traded lawsuits and, starting in 1915, Lionel criticized the quality of Ives&#x27; offerings in print advertisements, calling its cars flimsy and showing a cast-iron Ives locomotive shattering into 15 pieces when dropped from a table, while a Lionel locomotive dropped from the same height would survive with only dents. Other ads criticizing Ives&#x27; quality appeared, but they always compared Ives&#x27; cheapest products with Lionel&#x27;s priciest offerings.

Although Ives could rightly claim that its lithographed offerings were more realistic than Lionel&#x27;s simple enameled two-color cars, Lionel, taking a cue from Ives, targeted advertising straight at children, claiming its cars were the most realistic and that its paint jobs were more durable.

Ives&#x27; subdued responses did little to counter Lionel&#x27;s claims, only calling its competitors imitators whose technology was &quot;12 years behind.&quot; It was no match for Lionel&#x27;s bold and brash ads. Additionally, Lionel&#x27;s trains generally were priced lower, or, in instances where their price was comparable to Ives, they were larger, making them appear to be a better value for the money. As a result, Lionel continually gained ground on Ives, finally overtaking them in sales in 1924.

In 1921, Ives abruptly discontinued its slow-selling 1 gauge trains in favor of Wide Gauge trains, a standard Lionel had introduced several years earlier and called &quot;Standard Gauge&quot;. Ives did not call its trains Standard Gauge, as Lionel had trademarked the name. While Ives was inconsistent in what it called its larger-gauge trains, it most frequently called it wide gauge. Numerous other companies also entered the wide gauge market in the early 1920s, increasing consumer interest in the size and forcing the manufacturers to innovate in order to survive.

In 1924, Ives introduced a locomotive engine that would change directions when its power flow was interrupted, a feature that Lionel would not offer for another two years. Even after Lionel&#x27;s introduction, Ives&#x27; offering was unique in that it offered a neutral position as well as forward and reverse, and the engine&#x27;s headlight continued to operate even when the train was in neutral. Ives charged a premium for this feature, which it dubbed the &quot;R-unit&quot; (the &quot;R&quot; stood for &#x27;remote&#x27;), and it increased sales.

This was not enough for Ives to re-take its former place as market leader—by 1926, Lionel&#x27;s revenue was twice that of Ives&#x27;--and, worse yet for the company, Ives was losing money by the mid-1920s. This was worsened by Ives&#x27; attempts to compete at the low end of the market, where, unlike its competition, it sold its entry-level models at a loss. If Ives&#x27; low-end products were higher quality than its competitors, it benefited its customers, not the company.

===Slogan===

For a time, the Ives Manufacturing Company used the slogan: &quot;Ives Toys Make Happy Boys&quot;.

==Bankruptcy==
In an effort to turn around the company, Harry Ives relinquished his presidency in 1927, becoming chairman of the board and bringing in an outsider, Charles R. Johnson, as president, but problems continued and Ives&#x27; largest creditor sued in 1928. Ives filed for bankruptcy, reporting liabilities of $188,303.25. As Ives already had $245,000 in Christmas sales lined up, Johnson petitioned for a private sale and a quick settlement. The motion for a private sale was denied.

On July 31, 1928, Ives was purchased by Lionel and American Flyer for $73,250. The low price in comparison to the company sales was presumably due to liens on Ives&#x27; assets. Lionel and Flyer then operated Ives as a joint venture, retaining Johnson and Harry Ives as president and chairman, respectively. Harry Ives left the company in September 1929, and died within seven years.

Ives&#x27; new owners immediately discontinued the line of toy boats, and much of Ives&#x27; train product line was replaced with relabeled American Flyer or Lionel product, and most new designs were carried out using Lionel and American Flyer parts, even though Ives&#x27; own designs were usually more realistic. There are several reasons for this. When Lionel and American Flyer bought Ives, they did not buy the factory or tooling, which they then had to rent. It may have been less expensive for the parent companies to supply their own parts than to rent the old Ives tooling. Some historians have speculated that the Ives tooling was worn out and no longer suitable for use. A third factor was that Lionel&#x27;s and Flyer&#x27;s manufacturing process was less labor-intensive, which made their designs less expensive to manufacture than the Ives designs they replaced.

A notable exception was the Ives 1122 locomotive, first produced in 1929, which was the first near-to-scale model of an existing locomotive to enter the marketplace. Although it had a 4-4-2 wheel configuration, it was otherwise a recognizable copy of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad President Washington Class 4-6-2 locomotive.

Whatever the reasons, the Ives product line after 1928 inherited many recognizable traits from three different companies&#x27; product lines.

==Lionel Manufactured Production==
In 1930, Lionel bought out American Flyer&#x27;s share in Ives and closed the Ives factory in Connecticut, moving operations to Lionel&#x27;s New Jersey factory. Lionel kept the Ives brand on the market through 1932, then repositioned Ives for 1933, branding its entry-level trains as Lionel-Ives, then dropped the Ives name altogether following that year. Although re-issues were occasionally made, the Ives name never re-appeared on the marketplace with any kind of regularity.

Although Joshua Lionel Cowen would later claim that he dumped all of the Ives molds in the Connecticut River, Ives&#x27; influence lived on. Lionel continued the Ives practice of issuing low-end train sets that ran on a circle of O-gauge track with a 27-inch diameter, and Lionel incorporated some Ives-designed freight cars into its product line. The Lionel 1680 tanker car, for instance, was an Ives design that remained in Lionel&#x27;s catalogs right up to the start of World War II.

Even more significantly, the Ives e-unit first introduced in 1924 lived on in Lionel locomotives, with a modified version of the Ives design first appearing in Lionel trains starting in 1933. Some historians have said Cowen coveted the Ives e-unit, and that it was the primary reason Lionel bought the company. It would remain present in Lionel trains for more than 50 years.

<text>The 2004 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election took place on March 20, 2004, in Toronto, Ontario, and resulted in the election of Stephen Harper as the first leader of the new Conservative Party of Canada. The Conservative Party was formed by the merger of the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, in December 2003.

Stephen Harper, the former leader of the Canadian Alliance, was elected on the first (and only) ballot. Tony Clement, a former Ontario Progressive Conservative health minister, and Belinda Stronach, the former chief executive officer of Magna International, were the other candidates on the ballot.

The leader was selected by a system in which each of the party&#x27;s riding associations was allocated 100 points, which were allocated among candidates in proportion to the votes that he or she received. This system was selected as a condition of the merger, to prevent the far larger Canadian Alliance membership base from overwhelming that of the Progressive Conservatives.

Members voted using ranked ballots. If no candidate won a majority of votes in the first round, the ballots supporting the candidate with the smallest number of votes would be re-distributed according to the voters&#x27; second preferences. Subsequent rounds were not needed, however, because Stephen Harper won in the first round.

*Larry Smith - Publisher of the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;
*Chuck Strahl - Canadian Alliance Member of Parliament

==Results==
Points needed to win: 15,401

Each of 308 ridings had 100 points which were distributed by proportional representation according to votes cast by party members in the riding.

The actual vote totals remained confidential when the leadership election results were announced; only the point totals were made public at the time, giving the impression of a race that was much closer than was actually the case. Three years later, Harper&#x27;s former campaign manager, Tom Flanagan, published the actual vote totals, noting that, among other distortions caused by the equal-weighting system, &quot;a vote cast in Quebec was worth 19.6 times as much as a vote cast in Alberta&quot;.

==Total expenses==
*Belinda Stronach $2,496,482
*Stephen Harper $2,073,084
*Tony Clement $826,807

<text>Rosslyn Chapel, also known as the Collegiate Chapel of Saint Matthew, is a 15th-century Episcopal chapel located in the village of Roslin in Midlothian, Scotland. The chapel was founded by William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness with a ground-breaking ceremony in 1456. After the Scottish Reformation in 1560, it was largely abandoned but, following a visit by Queen Victoria, it was rededicated in 1862. It was the target of a bombing in 1914 during the suffragette bombing and arson campaign. The interior contains some fine carvings which many historians have sought to interpret. 

Since the late 1980s, the chapel has been the subject of speculative theories concerning a connection with the Knights Templar and the Holy Grail, and Freemasonry. It was prominently featured in this role in Dan Brown&#x27;s bestselling novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; (2003) and its 2006 film adaptation. Medieval historians say these accounts have no basis in fact. Rosslyn Chapel remains privately owned.

==History==
===Early history===
The chapel is dedicated to Saint Matthew the Evangelist and was founded on a small hill above Roslin Glen as a collegiate church (with between four and six ordained canons and two boy choristers) in the mid-15th century. The chapel was founded by William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness of the Scoto-Norman Sinclair family. Rosslyn Chapel is the third Sinclair place of worship at Roslin, the first being in Roslin Castle and the second (whose crumbling buttresses can still be seen today) in what is now Roslin Cemetery.

Sinclair founded the college to celebrate the Liturgy of the Hours throughout the day and night, and also to celebrate Catholic Masses for all the faithful departed, including the deceased members of the Sinclair family. During this period, the rich heritage of plainsong (a single melodic line) or polyphony (vocal harmony) were used to enrich the singing of the liturgy. Sinclair provided an endowment to pay for the support of the priests and choristers in perpetuity.

After the Scottish Reformation in 1560, Catholic worship in the chapel was brought to an end. The chapel&#x27;s altars were destroyed in 1592.

In 1842 the chapel, then in a ruined and overgrown state, was visited by Queen Victoria, who expressed a desire that it should be preserved. Restoration work was carried out in 1862 by David Bryce on behalf of James Alexander, 3rd Earl of Rosslyn. The chapel was rededicated on 22 April 1862, and from this time, Sunday services were once again held, now under the jurisdiction of the Scottish Episcopal Church.

===1914 bombing===

The chapel was the subject of a terrorist attack on 11 July 1914, when a bomb exploded inside the building. This was as part of the suffragette bombing and arson campaign of 1912–1914, in which suffragettes carried out a series of politically motivated bombing and arson attacks nationwide as part of their campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage. Churches were a particular target during the campaign, as it was believed that the Church of England was complicit in reinforcing opposition to women&#x27;s suffrage. Between 1913 and 1914, 32 churches were attacked nationwide. In the weeks leading up to the attack, there were also bombings at Westminster Abbey and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

===Restoration, conservation and tourism===

The Rosslyn Chapel Trust was established in 1995, with the purpose of overseeing its conservation and its opening as a sightseeing destination. The chapel underwent an extensive programme of conservation between 1997 and 2013. This included work to the roof, the stone, the carvings, the stained glass and the organ. A steel canopy was erected over the chapel roof for fourteen years. This was to prevent further rain damage to the church and also to give it a chance to dry out properly. Three human skeletons were found during the restoration. Major stonework repairs were completed by the end of 2011. The last major scaffolding was removed in August 2010.

A new visitor centre opened in July 2011. The chapel&#x27;s stained-glass windows and organ were fully restored. New lighting and heating were installed. The expected cost of the restoration work is around £13 million, with about £3.7 million being spent on the Visitor Centre. Funding has come from various sources including Heritage Lottery Fund, Historic Scotland and the environmental body, WREN. Actor Tom Hanks also made a donation.

Photography and video have been forbidden in the chapel since 2008. The chapel sells commercially produced photos in its shop. In 2006, historian Louise Yeoman criticised the Rosslyn Chapel trust for &quot;cashing in&quot; on the popularity of &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, against better knowledge.

In the financial year of 2013–14, Rosslyn Chapel recorded 144,823 visitors, the highest number since 2007–08, when (at the height of popular interest induced by &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;), the number of visitors was close to 159,000. The current owner is Peter St Clair-Erskine, 7th Earl of Rosslyn.

==Architecture==

The original plans for Rosslyn have never been found or recorded, so it is open to speculation whether or not the chapel was intended to be built in its current layout. Its architecture is considered to be among the finest in Scotland.

Construction of the chapel began on 20 September 1456, although it has often been recorded as 1446. The confusion over the building date comes from the chapel&#x27;s receiving its founding charter to build a collegiate chapel in 1446 from Rome.

Although the original building was to be cruciform, it was never completed. Only the choir was constructed, with the retro-chapel, otherwise called the Lady chapel, built on the much earlier crypt (Lower Chapel) believed to form part of an earlier castle. The foundations of the unbuilt nave and transepts stretching to a distance of 90 feet were recorded in the 19th century. Construction of the planned nave and transepts was abandoned.

The Lower Chapel (also known as the crypt or sacristy) should not be confused with the burial vaults that lie underneath Rosslyn Chapel.

The chapel stands on fourteen pillars, which form an arcade of twelve pointed arches on three sides of the nave. At the east end, a fourteenth pillar between the penultimate pair form a three-pillared division between the nave and the Lady chapel. The three pillars at the east end of the chapel are named, from north to south: the Master Pillar, the Journeyman Pillar and, most famously, the Apprentice Pillar.

===Apprentice pillar===

One of the more notable architectural features of the chapel is the &quot;Apprentice Pillar, or &quot;Prentice Pillar&quot;. Originally called the &quot;Prince&#x27;s Pillar&quot; (in the 1778 document &quot;An Account of the Chapel of Roslin&quot;) the name morphed over time due to a legend dating from the 18th century, involving the master mason in charge of the stonework in the chapel and his young apprentice mason. According to the legend, the master mason did not believe that the apprentice could perform the complicated task of carving the column without seeing the original which formed the inspiration for the design. The master mason travelled to see the original himself, but upon his return was enraged to find that the upstart apprentice had completed the column by himself. In a fit of jealous anger, the master mason took his mallet and struck the apprentice on the head, killing him. The legend concludes that as punishment for his crime, the master mason&#x27;s face was carved into the opposite corner to forever gaze upon his apprentice&#x27;s pillar.

On the architrave joining the pillar there is an inscription, &quot;Forte est vinum fortior est rex fortiores sunt mulieres super omnia vincit veritas&quot;: &quot;Wine is strong, a king is stronger, women are stronger still, but truth conquers all&quot; (1 Esdras, chapters 3 &amp; 4).

The author Henning Klovekorn has proposed that the pillar is representative of one of the roots of the Nordic Yggdrasil tree, prominent in Germanic and Norse mythology. The general form of the pillar has been related to a type described by the French architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc as a &quot;bunch of sausages.&quot;

A full-size plaster cast of the Apprentice Pillar and the adjacent bay of the chapel was made in 1871, and is in the Cast Courts of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

===Carvings===
Among Rosslyn&#x27;s many intricate carvings are a sequence of 213 cubes or &quot;boxes&quot; protruding from pillars and arches with a selection of patterns on them. It is unknown if these patterns have any particular meaning attached to them. Many people have attempted to find information coded into them, but no interpretation has yet proven conclusive. Unfortunately, many of these &#x27;boxes&#x27; are not original, having been replaced in the 19th century after erosion damage.

One recent attempt to make sense of the boxes has been to interpret them as a musical score. The motifs on the boxes somewhat resemble geometric patterns seen in the study of cymatics. The patterns are formed by placing powder upon a flat surface and vibrating the surface at different frequencies. By matching these Chladni patterns with musical notes corresponding to the same frequencies, the father-and-son team of Thomas and Stuart Mitchell produced a tune which Stuart calls the &quot;Rosslyn Motet&quot;.
There are more than 110 carvings of &quot;Green Men&quot; in and around the chapel. Green Men are carvings of human faces with greenery all around them, often growing out of their mouths. They are found in all areas of the chapel, with one example in the Lady chapel, between the two middle altars of the east wall.
Other carvings represent plants, including depictions of wheat, strawberries or lilies. 
The authors Robert Lomas and Christopher Knight have hypothesised that some carvings in the chapel represent ears of new world corn or maize, a plant which was unknown in Europe at the time of the chapel&#x27;s construction. In their book they discuss meeting with the wife of botanist Adrian Dyer, and that Dyer&#x27;s wife told him that Dyer agreed that the image thought to be maize was accurate. In fact, Dyer found only one identifiable plant among the botanical carvings and suggested that the &quot;maize&quot; and &quot;aloe&quot; were stylised wooden patterns, only coincidentally looking like real plants.

===Crypt===
The chapel has been a burial place for several generations of the Sinclairs; a crypt was once accessible from a descending stair at the rear of the chapel. This crypt has been sealed shut for many years, which may explain the recurrent legends that it is merely a front to a more extensive subterranean vault containing (variously) the mummified head of Jesus Christ, the Holy Grail, the treasure of the Templars, or the original crown jewels of Scotland.

In 1837, when the 2nd Earl of Rosslyn died, his wish was to be buried in the original vault. Exhaustive searches over the period of a week were made, but no entrance to the original vault was found and he was buried beside his wife in the Lady Chapel.

===Rooftop pinnacle===
The pinnacles on the rooftop have been subject to interest during renovation work in 2010. Nesting jackdaws had made the pinnacles unstable and as such had to be dismantled brick by brick revealing the existence of a chamber specifically made by the stonemasons to harbour bees. The hive, now abandoned, has been sent to local bee keepers to identify.

==In popular culture==

===Templar and Masonic connections===
The chapel became the subject of speculation regarding its supposed connection with the Knights Templar or Freemasonry beginning in the 1980s. This part of its history was referenced in the DC Comics storyline &quot;Batman: Scottish Connection&quot;, in which the hero Batman becomes caught up in an old vendetta between two Scottish clans during a visit to Scotland, this mystery including the discovery of an ancient treasure trove hidden in Rosslyn.

The topic entered mainstream pop culture with Dan Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; (2003), reinforced by the subsequent film of the same name (2006).
Numerous books were published after 2003 to cater to the popular interest in supposed connections between Rosslyn Chapel, Freemasonry, the Templars and the Holy Grail generated by Brown&#x27;s novel.

The chapel, built 150 years after the dissolution of the Knights Templar, supposedly has many Templar symbols, such as the &quot;Two riders on a single horse&quot; that appear on the Knights Templar Seal.
William Sinclair 3rd Earl of Orkney, Baron of Roslin and 1st Earl of Caithness, claimed by novelists to be a hereditary Grand Master of the Scottish stonemasons, built Rosslyn Chapel. A later William Sinclair of Roslin became the first Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Scotland and, subsequently, several other members of the Sinclair family have held this position.

Robert L. D. Cooper, curator of the Grand Lodge of Scotland Museum and Library, in 2003 published a 12th edition of the 1892 &quot;Illustrated Guide to Rosslyn Chapel&quot; with the intention of countering the &quot;nonsense published about Rosslyn Chapel over the last 15 years or so&quot;. Cooper in 2006 also published &quot;Rosslyn Hoax?&quot; in which he actively debunks this type of speculation at length and in great detail. An example is the comparison of the Rosslyn myth of the Apprentice Pillar with that of the &quot;allegorical&quot; references to Hiram Abiff in Masonic ritual, and in the process he debunks any similarities between the two. A minute comparison between the Rosslyn Myth and the Masonic allegory can be found in a detailed tabular form in The Rosslyn Hoax?

Cooper further debunks other claims of a connection between carvings within Rosslyn Chapel and Scottish Freemasonry. The suggestion that the Apprentice Pillar is a physical reference to the Entered Apprentice degree of Scottish Freemasonry logically led to the conclusion that the other two pillars (in line south to north with the so-called Apprentice Pillar) represented the Fellow of Craft degree (middle pillar) and the Master Mason&#x27;s degree (north pillar). This association of three pillars in the east part of Rosslyn Chapel with the three degrees of Scottish Freemasonry is impossible, given the fact that (according to Cooper) the third degree of Freemasonry was invented c.1720 - almost 300 years after Rosslyn Chapel was founded.
The claim that the layout of Rosslyn Chapel echoes that of Solomon&#x27;s Temple has been analysed by Mark Oxbrow and Ian Robertson in their book, &quot;Rosslyn and the Grail&quot;:
Rosslyn Chapel bears no more resemblance to Solomon&#x27;s or Herod&#x27;s Temple than a house brick does to a paperback book. If you superimpose the floor plans of Rosslyn Chapel and either Solomon&#x27;s or Herod&#x27;s Temple, you will actually find that they are not even remotely similar. Writers admit that the chapel is far smaller than either of the temples. They freely scale the plans up or down in an attempt to fit them together. What they actually find are no significant similarities at all. [...] If you superimpose the floor plans of Rosslyn Chapel and the East Quire of Glasgow Cathedral you will find a startling match: the four walls of both buildings fit precisely. The East Quire of Glasgow is larger than Rosslyn, but the designs of these two medieval Scottish buildings are virtually identical. They both have the same number of windows and the same number of pillars in the same configuration. [...] The similarity between Rosslyn Chapel and Glasgow&#x27;s East Quire is well established. Andrew Kemp noted that &#x27;the entire plan of this Chapel corresponds to a large extent with the choir of Glasgow Cathedral&#x27; as far back as 1877 in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries. Many alternative history writers are well aware of this but fail to mention it in their books.

As to a possible connection between the St. Clairs and the Knights Templar, the family testified against the Templars when that Order was put on trial in Edinburgh in 1309. Historian Dr. Louise Yeoman, along with other medieval scholars, says the Knights Templar connection is false, and points out that Rosslyn Chapel was built by William Sinclair so that Mass could be said for the souls of his family.

It is also claimed that other carvings in the chapel reflect Masonic imagery, such as the way that hands are placed in various figures. One carving may show a blindfolded man being led forward with a noose around his neck. The carving has been eroded by time and pollution and is difficult to make out clearly. The chapel was built in the 15th century, and the earliest records of freemasonic lodges date back only to the late 16th and early 17th centuries. A more likely explanation, however, is that the Masonic imagery was added at a later date. This may have taken place in the 1860s when James St Clair-Erskine, 3rd Earl of Rosslyn instructed Edinburgh architect David Bryce, a known Freemason, to undertake restoration work on areas of the church including many of the carvings.

===Alternative histories===
Alternative histories involving Rosslyn Chapel and the Sinclairs have been published by Andrew Sinclair and Tim Wallace-Murphy arguing links with the Knights Templar and the supposed descendants of Jesus Christ. The books in particular by Tim Wallace-Murphy and Marilyn Hopkins &quot;Rex Deus: The True Mystery of Rennes-le-Château and the Dynasty of Jesus (2000)&quot; and &quot;Custodians of Truth: The Continuance of Rex Deus&quot; (2005) have focused on the hypothetical Jesus bloodline with the Sinclairs and Rosslyn Chapel.

On the ABC documentary &quot;Jesus, Mary and Da Vinci&quot;, aired on 3 November 2003, Niven Sinclair hinted that the descendants of Jesus Christ existed within the Sinclair families. These alternative histories are relatively modern - not dating back before the early 1990s. The precursor to these Rosslyn theories is the 1982 book &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot; (retitled &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; in the United States) by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh and Henry Lincoln that introduced the theory of the Jesus bloodline in relation to the Priory of Sion hoax - the main protagonist of which was Pierre Plantard, who for a time adopted the name Pierre Plantard de Saint-Clair.

<doc id="433209" wikidata="Q6540761" url="?curid=433209" title="2003 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election">
<text>The Liberal Party of Canada held a leadership election on November 14, 2003, electing former finance minister Paul Martin as the party&#x27;s new leader, replacing outgoing leader (and prime minister) Jean Chrétien.

Stakes for the race were high as the winner would go on to become prime minister, in addition to leading a party that was high in the polls without a significant challenger.

Paul Martin spent the entire race as the front runner, as his supporters had secured a lock on the party executives of the federal and most provincial sections of the party. Because of Martin&#x27;s apparent strength, several prominent candidates, such as Allan Rock, and Brian Tobin, did not go beyond the formative stages.

Martin&#x27;s only serious challengers were John Manley and Sheila Copps, the former of whom withdrew before delegate selection began. Martin easily captured the leadership with 93.8% of the delegates.

The party would be beset by significant infighting afterwards, as he and his supporters moved to remove Chrétien supporters from cabinet and even from Parliament. Martin&#x27;s initial tactics to secure the leadership were generally seen, in retrospect, as weakening his eventual tenure as prime minister.

==Candidates==
=== Sheila Copps ===

;Background
Sheila Copps, 50, had been MP for Hamilton East, Ontario, since 1984. At the time of the leadership election, she was Minister of Canadian Heritage, since 1996. Previously, Copps had been Deputy Prime Minister (1993–1996, 1996–1997), Minister of the Environment (1993–1996), Minister of the Multiculturalism and Citizenship (1996), Minister of the Communications (1996), and Minister of Amateur Sport (1996–1999).

=== Paul Martin ===

;Background
Paul Martin, 65, had been MP for LaSalle—Émard, Quebec since 1988. From 1993 to 2002, he was Minister of Finance. Martin had previously stood for the leadership in the 1990 leadership election, finishing second. The combination of his leadership ambitions and Jean Chrétien&#x27;s slim win during the 1997 election led to a period of infighting within the party, resulting in Martin leaving cabinet in June 2002, and Chrétien, in the face of a leadership review, announcing his intention to step down February 2004.

<doc id="433210" wikidata="Q963631" url="?curid=433210" title="Game Boy Player">
<text>The is a GameCube peripheral developed by Nintendo which enables it to play Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance cartridges, allowing those games to be played on a television.

It connects via the high speed parallel port at the bottom of the GameCube and requires use of a boot disc to access the hardware. Rather than emulating a Game Boy system, the Game Boy Player uses physical hardware nearly identical to that of a Game Boy Advance. The device does not use the enhanced effects used by the Super Game Boy (a similar peripheral for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System). The peripheral received mainly positive reviews from critics.

==Design and features==

The Game Boy Player is available in Indigo, Black, Spice, or Platinum in Japan; Black in North America and Europe and Black and Indigo in Australia. A special Game Boy Player for the Panasonic Q (SH-GB10-H) was released because the Q&#x27;s legs are oriented differently from the original GameCube&#x27;s. All Game Boy Players have screws on the bottom to secure it to the bottom of the GameCube and also have an eject button on the right side of the unit for removing Game Boy Advance games. Game Boy and Game Boy Color games stick out from the unit, as with the Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Advance SP, so they can easily be taken out when the system is off or &quot;Change Cartridge&quot; has been selected from the menu.

Unlike some GameCube accessories, including the Advance Game Port, Game Boy Player is not compatible with the Wii directly. The Wii lacks the hi-speed port of the GameCube into which the Game Boy Player fits; in addition, the Game Boy Player matches the GameCube&#x27;s footprint. The Wii has a substantially different footprint, making direct compatibility too complicated to be included.

The Game Boy Player is region free, meaning the units will function on any GameCube system regardless of region, and like the Game Boy Advance, it will play cartridges of any region. However, the boot discs are region locked and must match the region of the GameCube system.

==Controllers==

The Game Boy Player allows for control either through a GameCube controller or a Game Boy Advance or Game Boy Advance SP hooked up with a GameCube-Game Boy Advance Cable. When using a Game Boy Advance, the buttons are identical, but due to the GameCube controller&#x27;s different layout, there are two different mappings players can use. Also, at least one GameCube controller must be plugged in for access to the Game Boy Player&#x27;s internal menu, which can be accessed by pressing the Z button.

All controllers, Game Boy Advances, and Game Boy Advance SPs connected to the GameCube are recognized as the same player. This allows a sort of co-op mode for games that do not normally have it (this was most likely not intended by Nintendo). Furthermore, allowing for multiple controllers recognized as the same player allows for simpler and more comfortable play of single system multiplayer Game Boy Advance games, such as those found in &quot;Mario Party Advance&quot;, in lieu of up to four players holding one Game Boy Advance unit.

In order to link other hardware, players are required to connect to the extension port on the Game Boy Player with the proper cable, which depends on whether the game was designed for Game Boy Advance or a Game Boy system released before the Game Boy Advance.

Map One is closer to the Game Boy Advance&#x27;s normal layout, while Map Two makes it easier to play with one hand and also allows some SNES rereleases to control more like they may have with the SNES controller, as they often had the Y button mapped to L and the X button mapped to R.

===Second party controllers===

Japanese hardware manufacturer Hori created for the Japanese market a special digital-only controller designed for use with the Game Boy Player. The design of the controller is similar to the design of the SNES controller, but with the GameCube&#x27;s face button layout. In addition, there is a Select button on the controller mapped to the Y button internally.

==On-screen menu==

The menu has six options to choose from:
*Frame: changes the colored border around the game &quot;screen&quot; to one of twenty different patterns. Super Game Boy borders are not supported.
*Size: changes the size that the GBA screen takes up on the TV (Normal is about 80% and appears sharper on some sets, while Full enlarges the image to the left and right edges of the TV)
*Controller: switches between the two controller mappings
*Screen: controls a motion blur effect to reduce potential flicker from programming tricks designed for a GBA screen. Can be set to &quot;sharp&quot; (no blurring), &quot;normal&quot; (some blurring), or &quot;soft&quot; (more blurring).
*Timer: set an alarm for one to sixty minutes.
*Change Cartridge: stops the game so cartridges can be swapped safely, without having to turn the GameCube off (it is best to save game data before doing so).

==Compatibility==
The Game Boy Player supports the following:

*Game Boy Game Paks: Compatible with most Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games. Game Boy games can be played using the same selectable color palettes as on the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Advance SP. Games with compatibility issues are listed below.
*e-Reader: Compatible with the e-Reader accessory, as well as all classic games, &quot;Mario Party-e&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3-e&quot;, &quot;Animal Crossing-e&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon Battle-e&quot; cards.
*GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable: By plugging it into a GameCube controller port, a GBA or GBA SP can be used as a substitute for a GameCube controller. By inserting a cable into the GBA link cable port and the GameCube controller plug into a second GameCube or a Wii, the Game Boy Player can be used to connect to a GameCube game.
*Wireless Adapter: The GBP fully supports the use of a Wireless Adapter, and will work with all games compatible with the accessory.

===Compatibility issues===
The instruction manual for the Game Boy Player specifically mentions that &quot;A few original Game Boy Game Paks may have display or sound problems,&quot; and that &quot;Motion sensor [...], rumble feature and infrared feature Game Paks will not work with the &quot;Game Boy Player&quot;.&quot; The following list concerns Game Boy Advance games and accessories that have compatibility issues, be they software or physical hardware, with the Game Boy Player:
*Game Boy Advance Video: All GBA Video cartridges are incompatible with the Game Boy Player, to prevent users from attaching the Game Boy Player to a VCR or DVD recorder and copying the Game Boy Video material. The GBA Video carts detect the Game Boy Player and refuse to boot when running under it, giving an error message. Even if the carts were playable on the player (which they are through the use of flash carts and Action Replay), the resolution was greatly reduced for the GBA medium, causing pixelation and sound pops that a large screen with louder speakers would pick up.
*Action Replay/Gameshark: Most models of the Action Replay or Gameshark for the GBA or GBC are too wide to fit into the GBP&#x27;s cartridge slot and often curl underneath the Game Boy Player system. One can overcome this problem by either modifying the device or simply through use of a ledge or propping up the system an inch. Despite these problems, most common Action Replay and Gameshark devices will work normally.
*Motion sensors: Games that use motion sensors (such as &quot;Kirby Tilt &#x27;n&#x27; Tumble&quot; and &quot;&quot;) are compatible with the Game Boy Player, but require tilting the whole GameCube to control, due to the motion sensor being integrated into the Game Pak.
*Infrared: Due to the lack of an infrared port on the Game Boy Player, Game Boy Color games cannot make use of this feature when played on the Game Boy Player.
*Game Boy Camera: The Game Boy Camera is perfectly functional on the Game Boy Player. While it is impractical to take photos with it due to the camera&#x27;s fixed position, its other features (looking at the album, stamping pictures, playing games, printing pictures, etc.) work normally.
*Game Boy Micro: A &quot;Game Boy Micro&quot; cannot be connected to the Game Boy Player via link cable. The equipment required for a connection is a Game Boy Micro Link Cable and a Game Boy Micro Converter Connector, along with a Game Boy Micro and Game Boy Player. The Converter Connector is built in such a way that the protruding (sticking out) piece of plastic on top prevents it from being inserted into the &quot;Game Boy Player&quot; all the way. Despite this, Nintendo previously mentioned on their website that the Converter Connector could be used to connect to the Game Boy Player. However, by separating the two pieces of plastic on the end of the Converter Connector that connects to a Game Boy Advance, a linkup between a Game Boy Micro and Game Boy Player becomes possible. The Game Boy Micro can also communicate with the Game Boy Player using Wireless Adapters (the Game Boy Micro Wireless Adapter for the Game Boy Micro and the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter for the Game Boy Player).
*Games with integrated rumble for Game Boy Color: Integrated rumble features are unavailable when playing Game Boy Color games which feature them (such as &quot;Pokémon Pinball&quot;), as it is only output through the Game Pak itself, not the GameCube controller.
*Action Pad/Beat Pad: The two dance pad controllers for the GameCube, the GCN Action Pad (bundled with &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix&quot;) and the Mad Catz Beat Pad (bundled with &quot;MC Groovz Dance Craze&quot;), do not properly interact with the Game Boy Color &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; games due to time synchronization issues. This is likely because they were never intended to be used together.
*Game Boy Color games incompatible with the Game Boy Advance: The games &quot;Pocket Music&quot; and &quot;Chee-Chai Alien&quot; are incompatible with the Game Boy Advance, and thus the Game Boy Player, giving an error message stating that they can only be played on the Game Boy Color if attempted. &quot;Chee-Chai Alien&quot; uses the infrared port of the Game Boy Color to detect light as a fundamental part of the game. &quot;Pocket Music&quot; utilizes the Game Boy Color&#x27;s sound chip in ways not possible on the Game Boy Advance, so a separate version was released for the Game Boy Advance.

==Rumble enabled==

The Game Boy Player added a rumble feature to certain Game Boy Advance games when played with a GameCube controller. Those games included:

* &quot;Drill Dozer&quot; (also has rumble built into cartridge for mobile use)
* &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga&quot;
* &quot;Pokémon Pinball: Ruby &amp; Sapphire&quot;
* &quot;Shikakui Atama wo Marukusuru Advance: Kokugo Sansu Rika Shakai&quot;
* &quot;Shikakui Atama wo Marukusuru Advance: Kanji Keisan&quot;
* &quot;Summon Night Craft Sword Monogatari: Hajimari no Ishi&quot;
* &quot;Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;

==Reception==
Reception was mainly positive — many review sites cited how Nintendo effectively increased the GameCube&#x27;s library by hundreds of games with the Game Boy Player, something that some reviewers praised and others mocked as a cheap ploy.

IGN mentioned that the filtering that the &quot;Game Boy Player&quot; uses (to relieve strobe effect on games using a flicker trick to make sprites seem transparent) &quot;muddies&quot; some of the graphics.

==Advance Game Port==
Datel&#x27;s version of the Game Boy Player was released in 2003. This dongle connects to Memory Card Slot B and can be booted up with the included boot disc. Later models have code generators for built in cheat devices. The advantage is that no removal of plates on the bottom, nor tools, are needed to install it. Unlike the Game Boy Player, the Advance Game Port utilizes software emulation, causing numerous audio and video issues in many games.

Up until System Menu 3.0&#x27;s release, and later the dawn of Wii homebrew, this was also the only way of running Game Boy Advance games on the Wii — because, as the Wii lacks the correct port, the Game Boy Player cannot be used. Before System Menu 3.0, the Wii allowed unofficial GameCube software, such as this and Action Replay. As the dongle plugs into the Memory Card Slot, it was fully compatible with the Wii. System Menu 3.0 prevented unofficial GameCube software from running, rendering this unusable. With the dawn of Wii homebrew, it is now possible to run the Game Boy lineup of games via an emulator.

<text>Stena Line is a Swedish shipping line company and one of the world&#x27;s largest ferry operators. It services Denmark, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Finland and Sweden. Stena Line is a major unit of Stena AB, itself a part of the Stena Sphere. It is a sister company to Stena Bulk, one of largest tanker companies in the world.

== History ==
===Formation===
Stena Line was founded in 1962 by Sten A. Olsson in Gothenburg, Sweden, which still serves as the company&#x27;s headquarters, when he acquired Skagenlinjen between Gothenburg and Frederikshavn, Denmark.

In 1972, Stena Line was one of the first ferry operators in Europe to introduce a computer-based reservation system for the travel business area. In 1978, the freight business area also started operating a computer-based reservation system.

===Freight===
The first freight-focused route started between Gothenburg, Sweden, and Kiel, Germany. The ship was the MS &quot;Stena Transporter&quot;.

===North Sea===
During the 1980s, Stena acquired three other ferry companies.

* 1981, Sessan Line, Stena&#x27;s biggest competitor on Sweden–Denmark routes, was acquired and incorporated into Stena Line. This included Sessan&#x27;s two large newbuilds, &quot;Kronprinsessan Victoria&quot; and , which became the largest ships operated by Stena by that date.
* 1983, Stena acquired Varberg-Grenå Linjen, and two years later also the right to that company&#x27;s former name, Lion Ferry. Lion Ferry continued as a separate marketing company until 1997, when it was incorporated into Stena Line. 
* 1989, Stena acquired yet another ferry company, Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland (SMZ) (&quot;which at the time traded under the name Crown Line&quot;). SMZ&#x27;s Hook of Holland–Harwich route then became a part of Stena Line.

===North America===
* 1988, July - Stena Line purchased the British Columbia Steamship Co., operators of a Victoria–Seattle route.
* 1990, November - The Victoria–Seattle run was permanently cancelled, and the local company ceased trading.

===Irish Sea===
In 1990, Stena Line doubled in size with the acquisition of Sealink British Ferries from Sea Containers. This first became Sealink Stena Line, then Stena Sealink Line and finally Stena Line (UK), which now operates all of Stena&#x27;s ferry services between Great Britain and Ireland.
In 1996, Stena Line introduced its 20,000 tonne HSS (High-speed Sea Service) vessels, which operated: Belfast–Stranraer; Holyhead–Dún Laoghaire and Hook of Holland–Harwich. In addition to the three 1,500-passenger HSS vessels, Stena Line ordered two smaller 900-passenger HSS vessels to operate on the Gothenburg–Frederikshavn route. Due to the bankruptcy of the shipyard, only the first of these vessels was ever completed.

===English Channel===
In 1998, Stena&#x27;s operations from Dover and Newhaven formed a joint venture with P&amp;O European Ferries as P&amp;O Stena Line, owned 40% and 60% respectively. In 2002, P&amp;O acquired all of Stena&#x27;s shares in the company, thus becoming the sole owner of P&amp;O Stena Line, which soon changed its name to P&amp;O Ferries.

===Further expansion===
In 2000, Stena Line purchased yet another Scandinavian ferry operator: Scandlines AB.

In November 2006, Stena ordered a pair of &quot;super ferries&quot; with a gross tonnage of 62,000 from Aker Yards, Germany for delivery in 2010, with an option for two more ships of the same design. The new ferries will be amongst the largest in the world, to be operated on Stena&#x27;s North Sea route from Hook of Holland to Harwich. The existing ships from the North Sea were to be moved to the Kiel–Gothenborg route, whereas the ships from Kiel would transfer to the Gdynia to Karlskrona route. The new ferries were launched in 2010, with &quot;Stena Hollandica&quot; entering service on 16 May 2010, and &quot;Stena Britannica&quot; planned to enter service in 2010.

===Acquisitions and closures===
* 2008, May - The company moved its Belfast Terminal from Albert Quay to the new VT4. This has reduced the length of the crossing to Stranraer by ten minutes.
* 2009, July - Stena Line announced that it had repurchased its former ship, &quot;Stena Parisien&quot;, from SeaFrance. The ship was renamed &quot;Stena Navigator&quot; after a comprehensive refit. She was then introduced on the Stranraer to Belfast route, alongside HSS &quot;Stena Voyager&quot; and &quot;Stena Caledonia&quot;.
* 2010, December - Stena Line announced it had acquired the Northern Irish operations of DFDS Seaways. The sale includes the Belfast to Heysham &amp; Birkenhead routes, two vessels from the Heysham route (Scotia Seaways &amp; Hibernia Seaways) and two chartered vessels from the Birkenhead route ( &amp; ). The Fleetwood to Larne route ended on 24 December 2010.
* 2011, 21 November - Stena Line introduced the &quot;Stena Superfast VII&quot; and &quot;Stena Superfast VIII&quot; to replace the &quot;Stena Navigator&quot; and &quot;Stena Caledonia&quot; on the Belfast–Cairnryan route. It was announced that the &quot;Stena Voyager&quot; would be removed from service on 20 November 2011. It was later sold to Stena Recycling and sent for scrapping in May 2013. The two new vessels were initially chartered from Tallink before Stena bought them in 2017.
* 2014, 26 February - it was announced that Stena Line would acquire the Celtic Link ferry service from Rosslare to Cherbourg, France. It was also agreed to take over the charter of their vessel &quot;Celtic Horizon,&quot; which was renamed &quot;Stena Horizon.&quot;
* 2019, February - A joint venture with Hyundai Glovis has been announced and approved by the European Commission, for the implementation of a new cooperative short sea intra-European waters service in between the two carriers, for the sea transport of transhipment cargo originating from South Korea.
* 2020, 14 March - due to the Coronavirus outbreak, the company suspended operations between Oslo and Frederikshavn temporarily until further notice due to travel restrictions in Denmark and Norway, the routes sole ship the &quot;MS Stena Saga&quot; was sent to Gothenburg where she arrived on 16 March 2020 where the company later confirmed it would be making 950 redundancies in Sweden as a result of Coronavirus. The company then later announced on 19 March 2020 that it was going to permanently suspend and close operations on the Oslo–Frederikshavn service due to the lack of profitability, where Stena announced that due to Coronavirus it was unlikely able to see it turn a profit during the whole year when the service is totally dependent on the summer season. The future of &quot;Stena Saga&quot; remains uncertain and remained laid up in Gothenburg (since end of 2021 she has been anchored near Manila, Philippines). 
* 2020 – 2021 - After being replaced by two new e-flexers, MV &quot;Stena Embla&quot; and MV &quot;Stena Edda,&quot; on the Belfast to Birkenhead route MV &quot;Stena Mersey&quot; and MV &quot;Stena Lagan&quot; proceeded to Tuzla, Turkey for a major refit.

<doc id="433219" wikidata="Q7006914" url="?curid=433219" title="2003 New Democratic Party leadership election">
<text>The 2003 New Democratic Party leadership election was a leadership election held in Canada to replace New Democratic Party leader Alexa McDonough, after her retirement. It ended on January 25, 2003, with the first ballot victory of popular Toronto city councillor Jack Layton.

The election was the first to be conducted under the NDP&#x27;s new partial one member, one vote system, in which the popular vote of the members is weighted for 75% of the result. The rest are votes cast by delegates for affiliated organizations, mainly labour unions. It was also the first Canadian leadership convention to allow Internet voting; delegates who chose to vote electronically were given a password to a secure website to register their votes.

The race was heated, with the leaders campaigning to NDP audiences across Canada. One of the most notable events of the campaign occurred at the convention in Toronto, the day before the election, when candidate Pierre Ducasse made a stirring speech. Ducasse&#x27;s speech attracted widespread praise, although its late delivery was unable to sway the postal and internet votes which had already been cast.

==Candidates==
===Jack Layton===

At the time of the election, Jack Layton was serving on Toronto City Council for Ward 30 and vice chair of Toronto Hydro, and a former university lecturer and environmental consultant. He had run and lost in both the 1993 and 1997 federal elections. His emphases included homelessness, affordable housing, opposing violence, the natural environment and the green economy. While other campaigns stressed federal experience, Layton&#x27;s campaign contended that his record on Toronto council and as former president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities encompassed national issues and would transfer to the federal stage, and that as Alexa McDonough had on her election as leader, he could lead the party successfully from outside Parliament until winning his own seat.
*Endorsements: Ed Broadbent (NDP leader, 1975–1989), Svend Robinson, Libby Davies, former Ontario New Democratic Party leader Stephen Lewis 
*Date campaign launched: July 22, 2002

===Bill Blaikie===

At the time of the election, Bill Blaikie was the MP for Winnipeg—Transcona, the NDP House leader and the critic on intergovernmental affairs, justice, the Solicitor General, and parliamentary reform. He had served as a member of Parliament (MP) since the 1979 Canadian federal election. His emphases included trade, Medicare, taxes and the environment, and his parliamentary experience. An ordained minister in the United Church of Canada, Blaikie was a prominent heir to the Social Gospel, Christian left tradition deeply rooted in the NDP.
*Endorsements: MPs Wendy Lill, Judy Wasylycia-Leis, Pat Martin, Bev Desjarlais, Dick Proctor and Yvon Godin, Manitoba Premier Gary Doer, Ontario NDP leader Howard Hampton and several former MPs
*Date campaign launched: June 17, 2002

===Lorne Nystrom===

Lorne Nystrom had served as the MP for Regina—Qu&#x27;Appelle from 1997 at the time of the election, and the NDP critic for economic policy, finance, banks, national revenue, public accounts, Crown corporations and electoral reform. He previously served as MP for Yorkton—Melville from 1968 to 1993. Through his 29 years in Parliament, it was the third time he had run for leader, following unsuccessful bids in 1975 and in 1995. Nystrom campaigned heavily on the issue of electoral reform. Other emphases included his parliamentary experience and practical left-wing economics; he had edited a book on financial issues, &quot;Just Making Change&quot;.
*Date campaign launched: July 31, 2002

===Joe Comartin===

Joe Comartin was the MP for Windsor—St. Clair and the party&#x27;s environment critic at the time of the election. His election in 2000 had been the first federal win for the NDP in Ontario in ten years, and he had helped add a second Ontario seat with Brian Masse&#x27;s win in the neighbouring riding of Windsor West in 2002. He emphasised foreign affairs, particularly in the Middle East, and his campaign included significant outreach to Arab and Muslim Canadians. Comartin received high profile support from the Canadian Auto Workers. Of the candidates, Comartin was considered the furthest left on economic policy.

*Endorsements: MP Brian Masse, CAW President Buzz Hargrove, CAW Local 444 President Ken Lewenza Sr., former aide to Howard Hampton and publisher Ish Theilheimer
*Date campaign launched: August 13, 2002

===Pierre Ducasse===

Pierre Ducasse was the Associate President of the NDP at the time of the election. His underdog campaign stressed outreach in Quebec and building the party toward electoral success. It also drew on Ducasse&#x27;s background in co-operative economics.
*Endorsements: Ken Georgetti, president of the Canadian Labour Congress

===Bev Meslo===
Bev Meslo was a Vancouver-area activist and represented the New Democratic Party Socialist Caucus in the leadership election.

==Results==
NOTES:

The labour votes at convention were weighted to equal 1/3 of the total membership votes cast (43,652 / 3 = 14,550.67).

This was done to ensure that labour held 25% of the total votes cast for Leader, as required by the NDP Constitution.

As a result, the vote of each labour delegate was equal to approximately 15.2 membership votes.

Campaign contributions were those reported on the interim financial statements, as of November 30, 2002.

==Timeline==

===2002===

<doc id="433225" wikidata="Q322356" url="?curid=433225" title="Kra Isthmus">
<text>The Kra Isthmus (, ; ), also called the Isthmus of Kra, in Thailand is the narrowest part of the Malay Peninsula. The western part of the isthmus belongs to Ranong Province and the eastern part to Chumphon Province, both in Southern Thailand. At its narrowest point, between the Thai cities of Kra Buri and Chumphon, the coastal distance between the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand is only 44 km (27 mi).

The Kra Isthmus marks the boundary between two sections of the mountain chain which runs from Tibet through the Malay peninsula. The southern part is the Phuket Range, which is a continuation of the Tenasserim Hills, extending further northwards for over beyond the Three Pagodas Pass.

The Kra Isthmus is in the Tenasserim-South Thailand semi-evergreen rain forests ecoregion. Dipterocarps are the dominant trees in the ecoregion.

== Pacific War ==
On 8 December 1941 local time, the Imperial Japanese army landed in Songkhla, invading Thailand. Because of the International Date Line, this actually occurred hours before the 7 December (Hawaii time) attack on Pearl Harbor, making it the first major action of the Pacific War. Japanese forces then moved south towards Perlis and Penang as part of the Malayan campaign, which culminated in the capture of Singapore.

== Kra Canal ==
The Thai Canal is a long-standing proposal to join the Gulf of Thailand with the Andaman Sea. Various routes were proposed to shortcut voyages from India to China, and avoiding the Strait of Malacca. The northernmost route was championed by Edward O&#x27;Riley (1821-1856), a government official in Burma, and Henry Wise, in England, when it was the subject of a report to the British Parliament in 1859 by Consul Robert Schomburk from Bangkok. A later crossing is related by Loftus.

<doc id="433228" wikidata="Q160467" url="?curid=433228" title="Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha">
<text>Charles Edward (Leopold Charles Edward George Albert; 19 July 18846 March 1954) was at various points in his life a British prince, a German duke, and a Nazi politician. He was the last ruling duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a state of the German Empire, from 30 July 1900 to 14 November 1918. He later held multiple positions in the Nazi regime, including leader of the German Red Cross, and acted as an unofficial diplomat for the German government.

Charles Edward&#x27;s parents were Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, and Princess Helen of Waldeck and Pyrmont. His paternal grandparents were Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Prince Leopold died before his son&#x27;s birth. Charles Edward was born in Surrey, England, and brought up as a British prince. He was a sickly child who developed a close relationship with his grandmother and his only sibling, Alice. He was privately educated, including at Eton College. In 1899, Charles Edward was selected to succeed to the throne of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha because he was deemed young enough to be re-educated as a German. He moved to Germany at the age of 15. Between 1899 and 1905, he was put through various forms of education, guided by his cousin, German Emperor Wilhelm II.

Charles Edward ascended the ducal throne in 1900 but reigned through a regency until 1905. In 1905, he married Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein. The couple had five children, including Sibylla, the mother of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. The Duke was a conservative ruler with an interest in art and technology. He tried to emphasise his loyalty to his adopted country through various symbolic gestures. Still, his continued close association with the United Kingdom was off-putting both to his subjects and to the German elite. He chose to support the German Empire during the First World War. He was deposed during the German Revolution like the other German princes. He also lost his British titles as a result of his decision to side against the British Empire.

During the 1920s, Charles Edward became a moral and financial supporter of violent far-right paramilitary groups in Germany. By the early 1930s, he was supporting the Nazi Party and joined it in 1933. He helped to promote eugenicist ideas which provided a basis for the murder of many disabled people. He was involved in attempting to shift opinion among the British upper class in a more pro-German direction. His attitudes became more pro-Nazi during the Second World War, though it is unclear how much of a political role he played. After the war, he was interned for a period and was given a minor conviction by a denazification court. He died of cancer in 1954.

==Early life in Britain==

=== Family ===
Charles Edward&#x27;s father was Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, the youngest son of the reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria. Historian Karina Urbach described Leopold as &quot;the most intellectual of Queen Victoria&#x27;s children&quot;. Charles Edward&#x27;s mother, Princess Helen, Duchess of Albany, was the daughter of the ruling prince of Waldeck and Pyrmont, George Victor, and the sister of Queen Emma of the Netherlands. Royal biographer Theo Aronson described her as a &quot;capable, conscientious&quot; woman, and a devout Christian. Leopold, who suffered from haemophilia, died after slipping and hitting his head months before Charles Edward&#x27;s birth. Charles Edward was in no danger of being affected by haemophilia because a boy cannot inherit the condition from his father.

Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the British royal family had developed close familial relationships with continental Protestant, and particularly German, reigning families. Queen Victoria&#x27;s immediate family belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; her deceased husband, Prince Albert, was the younger brother of the childless Duke Ernest II. Ernest governed the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, one of the states in the federalised German Empire. Victoria and Albert&#x27;s eldest daughter, Victoria, German Empress, was the mother of German Emperor Wilhelm II. Victoria and Albert&#x27;s eldest son, Prince Albert Edward, was the heir apparent to the British throne. Thus it was their second son, Prince Alfred, who succeeded his uncle Ernest II in 1893. Aronson commented on a painting of the family commissioned to commemorate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee in 1887:

=== Childhood ===
Leopold Charles Edward George Albert was born on 19 July 1884 at Claremont House near Esher, Surrey. He used the name Charles Edward. Leopold had wanted his firstborn son to be named after Charles Edward Stuart, an 18th-century claimant to the British throne. The infant was privately baptised at Claremont on 4 August 1884 after he fell ill. His baptism was publicly certified at St George&#x27;s Church, Esher, on 4 December 1884. Charles Edward was brought up as a prince of the United Kingdom for the first 15 years of his life. He succeeded to his deceased father&#x27;s titles at birth and was styled &quot;His Royal Highness the Duke of Albany&quot;. In addition to being the Duke of Albany, he was also the Earl of Clarence and Baron Arklow. He had a sister, Alice, who was a year and a half older. Being an intensely anxious child, he often looked to Alice for support, a habit that continued throughout his adulthood. The siblings were nicknamed &quot;Siamese twins&quot;.
Theo Aronson described the Albany household at Claremont House as &quot;cosy, comfortable, well-ordered&quot;. After her husband&#x27;s death, the British Parliament had given Helen an annual grant from the civil list of 6,000 pound sterling. This did not make her as wealthy as she was during her marriage, but did allow her to employ several domestic servants, including a number responsible for the children. One of Charles Edward&#x27;s childhood nannies referred to him as &quot;delicate and sensitive, nervous and tiring&quot;. Medical experts consulted by the royal family believed that he had been permanently harmed by the grief which his widowed mother had suffered from during her pregnancy. No record of Charles Edward&#x27;s own childhood memories exists, but Alice fondly recalled this period of their lives. Aronson commented that the environment where the two children were looked after was a &quot;typical, late nineteenth-century nursery&quot;. He described it as:... a small, self-contained world of early-to-rise, porridge for breakfast, vigorous hair-brushings, buttoned boots, holland pinafores, pick-a-back rides, stories, squabbles, tears, treats and punishments, bland nursery meals, walks to the lake to feed the wild ducks with squares of dry bread ... , little covered baskets holding soup or jelly or junket for the sick, pony rides in the park, baths filled with hot water from highly polished copper cans, firelight, lamplight, warming-pans, good-night prayers, nightlights.
Caring for the children was mainly the responsibility of their nannies, but they spent time with their mother for set periods each day. She taught the children practical skills, such as knitting, and gave them their Sunday school lessons. Helen read them literature by various well-known English and Scottish authors of the 19th century. She was an affectionate mother but also a strict oneinsisting her children were brought up with stern discipline and encouraged to develop a sense of duty. Her son did not react well to this, becoming afraid of his mother and authority more generally. Charles Edward, his mother, and his sister were surrounded by members of the wider royal family in proximity to Queen Victoria. They frequently spent time with the Queen at her various estates. Charles Edward was described as Victoria&#x27;s favourite grandchild. The boy and his sister often visited Balmoral Castle where they prepared for their future positions. Victoria enjoyed her grandchildren acting out dramatic scenes which reflected the religious values she wanted to inculcate in them. Lewis Carroll, a family friend, described Charles Edward as a &quot;perfect little prince&quot; who was well-trained in court etiquette and ceremony. Princess Helen also took her children on visits to her relatives in Germany and the Netherlands.

Public duties were a part of the royal family&#x27;s functions, though Aronson suggests that they were naïve about the deeply unpleasant conditions in which much of the British population lived. Charles Edward&#x27;s mother wasunusually for a German aristocratespecially interested in social issues and, according to Alice, the children were encouraged to sympathise with others and engage in charitable work. Charles Edward developed an interest in military and royal occasions at a young age. He was given his first ceremonial position in the Seaforth Highlanders regiment of the British Army as a child. Victoria mentioned the five-year-old Prince wearing the &quot;full uniform of the Seaforth Highlanders&quot; in her diary. Shortly before his 13th birthday, Charles Edward participated in a parade for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The boy climbed on the roof of Buckingham Palace to see the assembled crowds before the event. He was described in contemporary press reports as being the most well-received participant.

Historian Hubertus Büschel indicates that the British royal family had high expectations for their young members&#x27; education. Charles Edward&#x27;s first teacher was a governess called &quot;Mrs Potts&quot; who taught him together with his sister. The siblings developed a lifelong interest in history from her lessons where they were allowed to play-act historical scenes. He was then sent to school without his sister, studying in the privately funded public school system. Charles Edward attended two prep schools, firstly Sandroyd School in Surrey, and later Park Hill School in Lyndhurst. In a 1896 diary entry, Queen Victoria mentioned meeting the headmaster of the latter school &quot;Mr Rawnsley&quot; and his wife. She commented that: &quot;All they said was most satisfactory. He seems to be very careful &amp; kind.&quot; In 1898 the prince enrolled at Eton College and his mother hoped he would eventually go on to Oxford University. Eton College was a boarding school closely associated with the British elite. Press reports sometimes accused the boy of behaving self-importantly at school. He was happy at Eton and looked back nostalgically at his time at that school throughout his life. Aronson described the prince in his early teens as &quot;small, blue-eyed, exceptionally handsome and highly strung&quot;. He was not expected to grow up to be a particularly prominent person.

== First years in Germany ==

=== Selection as heir ===

Duke Alfred&#x27;s only son, Prince Alfred, died in 1899. The Duke was in poor health and the question of who would be his successor became an issue for the family. Alfred was seen as an inadequate foreigner by many members of the German governing elite, and a number of German princes wanted to split up the duchy among themselves. Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, Victoria and Albert&#x27;s third son, was initially heir presumptive. However, sections of the German press objected to a foreigner taking the throne, and Wilhelm II opposed a man who had served in the British army becoming ruler of a German state. Arthur&#x27;s son, Prince Arthur of Connaught, was at Eton with Charles Edward. Wilhelm II demanded a German education for the boy, but this was unacceptable to the Duke of Connaught. Thus both Charles Edward&#x27;s uncle and cousin renounced their claims to the duchy, leaving Charles Edward next in line. The prince was named heir under family pressure. There were reports in the American press that the younger Arthur had physically attacked Charles Edward or threatened to do so if he did not accept the position.

The boy seemed unhappy with the change of situation that had been imposed on him. Historian Alan R. Rushton quoted him as saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve got to go and be a beastly German prince.&quot; Rushton suggested that the adults around him appear to have encouraged Charles Edward to embrace his new role. His sister remembered their mother saying &quot;I have always tried to bring up Charlie as a good Englishman, and now I have to turn him into a good German&quot;. Field Marshal Frederick Roberts told him to &quot;Try to be a good German!&quot; However, both Büschel and Aronson interpret his mother&#x27;s comment instead as an expression of frustration about the new situation. Only fourteen years old at the time, Charles Edward&#x27;s young ageas well as his German mother and lack of his British fathermeant that he was deemed able to assimilate into German society in a way an older man would not be. The local newspaper in Coburg praised the choice. There was significant public interest in Germany in what happened to Charles Edward. According to Rushton, some Germans felt &quot;it was now important for the English boy to become a German man and leader of his adopted land&quot;. The prince was confirmed before leaving to go to Germany. Queen Victoria commented in her diary:Beatrice gave me a full account of the ceremony. Poor Helen &amp; Charlie had borne up well during the service, but were much overcome [by emotion] afterwards. It is very hard upon the poor child having to be uprooted like this, &amp; it is naturally a great wrench for him, &amp; for his mother it is really terrible to have her whole future deranged to give up for the time being her happy quiet home &amp; to give up her fatherless boy to go into the unknown!

=== Education ===
Charles Edward moved to Germany with his mother and sister when he was fifteen. He spoke little German. Duke Alfred wanted to separate Charles Edward from his mother, so she took her son to stay with her brother-in-lawKing William II of Württembergand found him a tutor. Helen then considered how he should be educated. The priority was reassuring Germans that he was being brought up in a proper German manner. Various members of the extended family made suggestions. Alfred wanted to be given responsibility for his heir but was considered too British. A school suggested by Empress Victoria was, according to Alice, felt to have too many Jewish pupils. Helen ultimately gave Wilhelm control over her son&#x27;s education.
According to Urbach, Wilhelm wanted to turn his young cousin into a &quot;Prussian officer&quot;. He invited the family to live in Potsdam, a town near Berlin which was used as the German emperor&#x27;s summer residence. Charles Edward attended the (Prussian Central Cadet Institute) at Lichterfelde. Wilhelm informed Queen Victoria in a telegraph that one of his staff had &quot;chosen eight well-behaved boys to form a class for him&quot;. the prince studied the German language and military science. He was made a lieutenant of cavalry on his 16th birthday in 1900, and joined the (1st Foot Guards) at Potsdam. In 1903, Charles Edward completed his university entrance qualification. His results were not made public. Charles Edward then studied government management at Prussian government ministries. He attended Bonn University, and studied law, but was not a particularly academic young man, and mainly enjoyed participating in the Corps Borussia Bonn.

Wilhelm II took such interest in Charles Edward&#x27;s assimilation into German society that the latter was known in the Imperial Court as &quot;the Emperor&#x27;s seventh son&quot;. The prince, with his mother and sister, spent a lot of their spare time at the German court in Berlin, where they were treated as members of the emperor&#x27;s family. Wilhelm had seven children, the older of whom were a similar age to the Albany siblings; Alice later wrote that they were &quot;like another brother and sister to them&quot;. The women got on well with Empress Augusta Victoria, while Wilhelm became something of a substitute father for Charles Edward. Wilhelm saw Charles Edward as impressionable. He introduced the prince to his own worldview which included antisemitism, German nationalism and hostility to the (parliament). During a political scandal in 1908, there were allegations of the young man engaging in homosexual activity with Wilhelm. Charles Edward often did not enjoy his time in Berlin, where the emperor seemed to become resentful of him and frequently bullied him. A 1905 entry in the diary of an official at the Berlin court commented;The Emperor loves to have fun with him [Charles Edward]. But what usually happens is that he pinches and puffs him so much that the poor little Duke actually gets beaten up. Recently his bride, Princess Victoria and her parents were also present; This probably made it particularly embarrassing for the poor little Duke, who almost fought back tears and had such an unhappy expression on his face the whole evening, as if he were about to be hanged the next morning.

=== Regency ===

Charles Edward inherited the ducal throne of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha at the age of sixteen when his uncle Alfred died at the age of 55 in July 1900. The boy cried at the funerala reaction that Urbach interpreted as an expression of fear about his future rather than grief for an uncle he had relatively little relationship with. Wilhelm appointed Prince Ernst of Hohenlohe-Langenburg as regent until Charles Edward&#x27;s 21st birthday. In 1901, he attended Queen Victoria&#x27;s funeral wearing the uniform of the Prussian Hussars. His eldest paternal uncle, who succeeded Queen Victoria as King Edward VII, was seen embracing Charles Edward at the funeral. The new king made his nephew a Knight of the Garter in 1902. Charles Edward&#x27;s mother decided he was old enough to look after himself in 1903 and left Germany with Alice. In May 1905, Edward appointed him Colonel-in-chief of the Seaforth Highlanders, a British army regiment.

Charles Edward tried his best to assimilate while maintaining some links with Britain such as participating in Anglican religious services. Urbach suggested he learnt the language quickly and commented that his &quot;German essays [at the military academy] were soon receiving higher marks than his English ones&quot;. However, various statements made by the prince during this period suggest he was homesick and unhappy with his situation. Charlotte Zeepzat, author of his entry in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; (&quot;ODNB&quot;), described him as a &quot;conscientious young man with a taste for the arts and music&quot;, who became popular in Coburg during this period. Aronson similarly commented that although Charles Edward had &quot;grown to maturity in an atmosphere of strident Prussian militarism&quot;, he was &quot;cultivated ... fond of music and the theatre, interested in history and architecture&quot;. Urbach described the young duke as &quot;immature&quot;. According to a contemporary news report, he was fond of &quot;sport and adventure&quot;. A 1905 article in the &quot;London and China Express&quot;, a British newspaper focused on foreign affairs, commented that:All the [German] newspapers sing the praises of the young Duke and describe his sympathetic character and bearing. Above all they are never tired of emphasising how German he has become, how he has completely forgotten the English training of his early youth, identifying himself in every way with the interests of Germany.

=== Marriage and children ===

As Charles Edward was considered to have an &quot;ambiguous&quot; attitude towards women, according to Urbach, his family decided he needed an arranged marriage at a young age. Wilhelm II chose his wife&#x27;s niece, Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, as the bride of Charles Edward. She was believed to be well-adjusted and loyal to Wilhelm&#x27;s royal house. Her nationality was seen as important and Victoria Adelaide lacked any non-German or Jewish ancestry. The young man was told to propose to her and he obliged. A degree of affection did exist between the young couple. They married on 11 October 1905, at Glücksburg Castle, Schleswig-Holstein, and had five children. Zeepzat commented that they were happy, but Urbach indicated otherwise.

The couple had five children: Prince Johann Leopold (19061972), Princess Sibylla (19081972), Prince Hubertus (19091943), (19121983), and Prince Friedrich Josias (19181998). As was expected for upper-class households at the time, caring for the children was largely delegated to the domestic servants. The family mainly spoke English at home, though the children learnt to speak German fluently. Hubertus was the Duke&#x27;s favourite child. A profile of the family published in the British newspaper &quot;The Sphere&quot; in 1914, commented on the children:The Coburg family are bright, happy children who lead a natural life, spending a great deal of their time in the open air in the fine grounds of their castle. They are very fond of riding. In the winter, which is a severe one in Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, they delight in ski-ing and other outdoor amusements suitable to snowy weather.Urbach discussed the family in later years. She commented that Charles Edward&#x27;s children were frightened of their father, who treated them &quot;like a military unit&quot;. She noted that the family often appear unhappy in photographs. His younger daughter, Princess Caroline Mathilde, claimed that her father had sexually abused her. The allegation was backed by one of her brothers. Charles Edward was often disappointed by his children&#x27;s choice of romantic relationships, at a time when he was trying to use strategic marriages to improve the diminished reputation of his royal house.

=== Peacetime reign ===

Charles Edward assumed full constitutional powers upon coming of age on 19 July 1905. At his investiture, he read a speech promising his allegiance to the German Empire and was cheered by onlookers after he publicly sampled local food. He was happy with his new territories, which he thought were pretty. He joined various patriotic groups to emphasise his loyalties. However, according to Urbach, the Duke lacked popularity. This was especially true in Gotha, an impoverished town with left-wing sympathies; to them, he seemed absolutist. In Coburg—a wealthy and conservative town known for its intense nationalismpeople were generally more sympathetic to Charles Edward but disliked a sense of foreignness they detected about him. He continued to have an English accent. He faced criticism for keeping Scottish Terrier dogs and for always appearing in public with a police guard.

Historian described Charles Edward as initially a liberal who shifted in a more authoritarian direction. He was supportive of the emperor and understood the governmental institutions. The new duke appointed , a conservative-leaning, Prussian government official, as his prime minister. According to Rushton, the Duke&#x27;s political worldview was &quot;conservative and nationalistic&quot;, reflecting what had been inculcated into him by Wilhelm II. He largely left governing to the cabinet he appointed. They used the motto &quot;Everything as it has been&quot; to describe their approach. Charles Edward frequently visited local events. He was a prominent figure in local civic life chairing many cultural or charitable organisations and offering patronage.

The Duke was interested in new forms of transportation, especially automobiles and airships. He invested in the creation of a new airship docking bay in Gotha, a decision that appeared commercially sensible. In 1913, he asked the German emperor to convert the civilian flying school there into a military one, which Wilhelm agreed to do in secret. He enthusiastically supported the court theatres in both towns and organised the restoration of the Veste Coburg, which was conducted between 1908 and 1924. In 1910, he joined the &quot;&quot;, a pro-monarchist political organisation. Charles Edward was anxious about how people viewed him, with his officials surveying public opinion. The Duke frequently tried to emphasise his loyalty to Germany through displays of cultural traditions such as Christmas festivities and folk costumes.

Charles Edward continued to have a good relationship with the British royal family and regularly visited the United Kingdom. In 1910, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; published a photograph of him wearing the uniform of the Seaforth Highlanders at an inspection of its veterans. In private, he frequently engaged in British activities even while in Germany. The Duke and Duchess performed Scottish country dances to bagpipes. His immediate family used English-language nicknames. Charles Edward received regular visits from Alice and his brother-in-law Prince Alexander of Teck. He developed a close bond with Edward, Prince of Wales, while the latter was a university student in the early 1910s. The Duke generally tried to stay out of politics, especially diplomatic issues between Great Britain and Germany. Büschel believed that Charles Edward&#x27;s attempts to come across as German during this period were likely an effort to please Wilhelm II and nationalists in Germany, rather than an expression of his own identity.

Members of the German political elite were often irritated by the Duke&#x27;s continued close relationship with Great Britain. Some of the more intense criticism came from the lower-ranking nobility of Franconia who often saw themselves as the most purely German of the German nobility. For instance, Baron claimed that &quot;foreigners&quot; holding German titles were a &quot;nuisance&quot; because they prevented a necessary battle against the &quot;cancer&quot; of Judaism, the SPD (a left-wing German political party) and &quot;freedom&quot;. While the Imperial German government was not as radical, it was displeased by some of Charles Edward&#x27;s behaviour. His decision to wear the uniform of his ceremonial British regiment at the funeral of Edward VII in 1910 caused particular annoyance. Officials at the German Embassy in London were suspicious of his frequent visits to the United Kingdom.

The Duke also became a major local landowner and had an annual income of about 2.5 million marks. By 1918 he would have an estimated wealth of between 50 and 60 million marks. He lived in both Coburg and Gotha for several months each year, as well as visiting his mountain or hunting lodges. He usually worked in the morning and spent the afternoon on leisure activities such as hiking. Recreation took up the bulk of his time and he was frequently abroad or in other parts of Germany. Charles Edward struggled with social interaction, especially with those who were different from him. He stopped local people from entering the countryside surrounding his castles, adding to his seclusion. He tended to spend much of his time in the company of courtiers who regularly offered him praise. Historian Juliet Nicolson has described these years as &quot;the perfect summer&quot;a time when privileged people enjoyed their wealth and social advantages in denial of the threats to their way of life that were starting to appear in politics and organised labour. Rushton commented on the Duke&#x27;s personal situation during this period:Charles Edward had every reason to be happy with his life: a growing healthy family, minimal professional duties, the opportunity to live very well and associate with his friends and relatives at the upper echelons of society in Europe ... As 1914 began, Charles Edward had not the slightest clue that the golden age of the European nobles was coming to a climax. He continued to hunt and travel, acting as an absolute sovereign ... His life as a monarch seemed to exist in a parallel world that had little in common with the majority of his subjects. 

=== First World War ===
The First World War caused a conflict of loyalties for Charles Edward, but he decided to support the German Empire. He was in England at the time of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand to receive an honorary degree as a Doctor of Civil Laws from Oxford University. He told his sister that he wanted to fight for Great Britain but felt obligated to return to his duchy, where public opinion began to turn against the Duke due to his British origins. He returned to Germany on 9 July. After the war, he would describe the events of 1914 in a letter to his sister as the end of his personal &quot;happiness&quot;.

At the start of the war the German press criticised the foreign links of the German aristocracy, Charles Edward was especially heavily attacked and accused of being a &quot;half-Englishman&quot;. The Duke publicly denounced Britain, accusing it of attacking Germany, and renounced his position as Colonel-in-chief of the Seaforth Highlanders. He sold his British military decorations rather than returning them which Büschel indicates was a gesture of contempt towards his family, albeit one that was likely for display. He broke off relations with his family at the British and Belgian courts; this did not suffice to overcome doubts about his loyalties in Germany. His attitudes would become more sincerely pro-German as the war years progressed.

Charles Edward could not participate in combat as his leg had been permanently damaged in a sledging accident. He provided non-combat support to the army corps from his territories travelling with them into the areas where warfare was taking place. He initially participated in the German invasion of Belgium. Here, the Duke witnessed the Sack of Dinant by German soldiers where hundreds of Belgian civilians were killed. His adjutant Marcel von Schackwho felt that the Belgian civilians had been treated correctlywrote that the event had made an &quot;unforgettable impression&quot; on the Duke. He was transferred to the Eastern Front at the start of September 1914. He disliked the way local people he met on the Eastern Front lived and thought that the homes of Jews, in particular, were dirty. Charles Edward received an Iron Cross &quot;for bravery&quot; at the end of 1914. In the middle war years, Charles Edward made various visits to the Western Front and areas of conflict in the Balkans.

The Duke never held a command. Soldiers from his duchies were awarded the (Carl Eduard War Cross). The Duke&#x27;s adjutant wrote diaries about his activities which were reported to the German military command and circulated in the German press for propaganda purposes. They presented him as sharing in the soldiers&#x27; difficult living conditions and describe him spending Christmas with them. In reality, he was unwell with rheumatism and ankylosing spondylitis, a type of arthritis. He usually stayed a long way behind the frontlines and regularly returned to Germany for medical treatment. This was a source of disapproval among some members of the German elite who felt that a young soldier should be able to repress his illnesses. According to Urbach, Charles Edward &quot;was more or a less a chocolate soldier, who spent most of his time dining at various casinos behind the front and visiting &#x27;his&#x27; Coburg troops&quot;.

The Duke acted as an intermediary between the German government and his relative Ferdinand I, ruler of the Kingdom of Bulgaria, which was a member of the Central Powers. Ferdinand had declared Bulgarian independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1908 and the Kingdom had fallen into economic crisis following the Second Balkan War. Charles Edward had offered a great deal of assistance to Ferdinand throughout those events including financial support. In 1916, Ferdinand wanted to go to war with the Ottoman Empire, something the Germans did not want because they were allied with the Ottomans. Charles Edward travelled to the Bulgarian capital city of Sofia on behalf of Wilhelm and persuaded Ferdinand not to.

The Duke was denounced as a traitor in Britain. He was one of a group of noblemen living in Germany and Austria who held British titles but sided with the Central Powersa group frequently identified in the British press as the &quot;traitor peers&quot;. For instance, soon after the conclusion of the war, &quot;The Sunday Post&quot; published a report on the &quot;traitor dukes&quot;. It included a negative and personally vitriolic profile of Charles Edward&#x27;s life which called his role in the war &quot;one of the blackest chapters in his ignominious career&quot;. Büschel noted that describing the Duke as a traitor was accurate as he was still a British subject and was participating in a war against the United Kingdom. He had never formally become a German national.

In 1915, King George V ordered his name removed from the register of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. In 1917, a law change in Coburg effectively banned Charles Edward&#x27;s British relatives from succeeding to the duchy. This decision was praised by German newspapers, one of which declared that he had &quot;torn&quot; his relationship with his birth country. Over the summer of 1917 bombers built in Gotha, which were named after the town, conducted multiple air raids in London and South East England which killed several hundred British civilians. That year, Charles Edward&#x27;s British property which was worth several million pounds was confiscated. Charles Edward responded by introducing a legal change that would stop his British relatives from ever inheriting his other property. The British royal family later changed its name from the German-sounding Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the House of Windsor. The Titles Deprivation Act 1917 began the process of removing his British titles. Urbach observed that Charles Edward did not seem to care that his behaviour might have put his mother, who was living in London under the protection of Queen Mary, at risk of reprisals.Charles Edward worked for the military staff on the Western Front in the later war years. He contributed 250,000 marks out of his personal wealth as financial support for the families of dead soldiers from his territories. A report published in &quot;The Times&quot;, a few years after the war, commented that he had often assisted British prisoners of wara decision which it described as a sign of his &quot;consideration and humanity&quot;. The Duke was alarmed by the murder of the Russian royal family in 1918; Empress Alexandra was one of his first cousins. He worried that the same thing would happen to his own family. Rushton wrote that it was the beginning of the fear of communism that would define his political activities in years to come. He joined the , an organisation of supporters of the German emperor, though he preferred German general and de facto military dictator Paul von Hindenburg as a leader. Büschel argued that Charles Edward&#x27;s First World War experiences were a &quot;school for nationalism, violence, and antisemitism&quot;.

The war placed severe burdens on the German population, and after mid-1918, the empire&#x27;s military situation collapsed. By late in the year an armistice was signed and a revolution broke out in Germany. On 11 November 1918, a peaceful demonstration took place against the Duke in Coburg. The duchy&#x27;s prime minister, , convinced the local SPD, which had many relatively well-off members, that further unrest would be dangerous to the town&#x27;s scenery. The political mood in Gotha, where people were starving, was more radical and the Workers&#x27; and Soldiers&#x27; Council essentially seized control. Charles Edward waited longer than most of the other ruling princes to respond to the situation. He announced that he had &quot;ceased to rule&quot; on 14 November but did not explicitly abdicate. According to Rushton, the slowness of Charles Edward&#x27;s abdication was due to anxiety that he would be killed. However, the transition of power in Coburg was quite calm and orderly compared to the transfer of power in some other parts of Germany. The German nobility was not physically attacked during the revolution, but the situation was deeply frightening to them and a cause of much resentment.

=== Aftermath of the First World War ===
Urbach wrote that Charles Edward was not popular and was still seen by some as English. By the end of the war, the left-wing, anti-royalist parts of the press had been nicknaming him &quot;Mr Albany&quot;, in a reference to his foreign origins. But he could still live in Coburg fairly contentedly. According to Rushton, he retained much of his prestige and he was often seen as essentially still the duke by his former subjects. Coburg was a politically conservative town and the new post-war world was frightening to many people. The inhabitants continued to look to Charles Edward for guidance. Shortly after the war, Coburg became part of the German state of Bavaria while Gotha became part of Thuringia. While Bavaria had a conservative political culture that Coburg fitted into well, culturally the move marked a significant change. This added to a sense that the former duke and his family remained the natural leaders of the community.

In 1919, he also lost his British titles. However, some personal sympathy remained for him among the political establishment in the United Kingdom due to the way in which he had been forced to go to Germany as a teenager. He continued to use some of the iconography and titles associated with the British royal family for the rest of his life. He visited his mother and sister in London in 1921 but was generally unwanted in Britain. When Charles Edward&#x27;s mother died in 1922, the British government stopped him from inheriting Claremont Housea development that upset him.

In 1919, his properties and his collections in Coburg were transferred to the &quot;&quot;, a foundation that still exists today. A similar solution for Gotha took longer, and only after legal struggles with the Free State of Thuringia was it set up in 1928–34. After 1919, the family retained Callenberg Castle, some other properties (including those in Austria) and a right to live at Veste Coburg. It also received substantial financial compensation for lost possessions. The refurbishment of Veste Coburg was completed at the state&#x27;s expense. Some additional real estate in Thuringia was restored to the ducal family in 1925. While the post-war democratic German state presented little threat to his property, Charles Edward continued to be paranoid about a communist revolution. He wrote in a letter to his sister in 1928 that:I only hope our winter will remain quiet but the Russians seem to be getting our communists on the move ... In different parts of Germany they have begun attacking our nationalists, but have luckily been beaten off with cracked crowns. If only the leaders would leave the workmen in peace. They are so sensible, &quot; (when they are not riled up).

=== 1920s political and paramilitary activities ===
Charles Edward continued to describe himself as a monarchist in the post-First-World-War period. He was said to want to return to political power as &quot;King of Thuringia&quot;. In practice, however, his enthusiasm for restoration was quite lukewarm. His emotional attachment to the German emperor largely ended with Wilhelm&#x27;s exile. The former duke began to look for political options which he saw as a stronger alternative to the deposed German emperor.

Charles Edward became far more overtly involved in politics after being deposed, supporting the nationalist and conservative right. The former duke was nostalgic for aspects of pre-war Germany, especially its militarism, and was frightened by communism. Urbach also suggested he had an obsession with masculine physical strength which stemmed from his lack of it. The former duke became associated with various right-wing paramilitary and political organisations. Rushton wrote that he &quot;became a member and patron of the paramilitary group , the &quot;&quot; and the veterans group &quot;. The &quot;Bund&quot; had previously been the Organisation Consul in the early 1920sa group which he also funded and participated in. It was involved in the politically motivated murders of politicians and Walther Rathenau. Urbach commented that &quot;Though Carl Eduard did not himself murder, he financed murderers&quot;. Police reports from the time noted that he and Victoria Adelaide attended speeches in public houses which expressed support for far-right terrorism.

Charles Edward also funded various anti-semitic nationalist groups. In 1922, he was invited to a traditional event where the best-performing student leaving a local gymnasium could make a speech. The schoolboy that year was a Jewish young man called Hans Morgenthau. The former duke expressed his disapproval by turning his back to Morgenthau and holding his nose throughout the speech. On 14 October 1922, the Nazi Party participated in a nationalist event called the &quot;&quot; in Coburg, which involved a significant amount of violence. That evening, Charles Edward attended a meal run by the party where Hitler spoke. The next day he shook hands with Hitler, becoming the first nobleman to publicly support him. Police investigated whether the former duke had encouraged his oldest son, Leopold, to join the Young German Order, an anti-semitic paramilitary organisation. In the autumn of 1923, it was reported in the press that Leopold had led a series of attacks on Jewish people in the area around Coburg, a number of incidents in the village of Autenhausen where Jewish farmers were seriously injured received particular attention. It was alleged that the former duke had bribed witnesses to protect his son from prosecution.

In 1920, he hid Hermann Ehrhardt, a Freikorps commander and later leader of the Organisation Consul, in one of his castles with a store of weapons, after Ehrhardt participated in the unsuccessful Kapp Putsch against the government. Büschel suggests that Ehrhardt, who was unhappy with Wilhelm and his heir, Crown Prince Wilhelm, may have wanted to make Charles Edward the monarch of the entirety of Germany. In 1923, the value of the German mark collapsed. Both the radical left and right of politics saw this as an opportunity to change the system of government. Communists tried to start a revolution in Thuringia and Saxony. Ehrhart and 5,000 followersincluding Charles Edward&#x27;s eldest sonresponded by preparing to march into Thuringia. The federal German government then removed the left-wing state governments in those areas reestablishing its authority from the perspective of public opinion. While Charles Edward was irritated by the unsuccessful Beer Hall Putsch by the Nazi Party a short time later because it disrupted Ehrhart&#x27;s own attempts to take powerthe leader of Bavaria, Gustav von Kahr, had been planning a coup against the federal government with Ehrhart before Hitler began a coup against himthe former duke did hide Nazis in one of his castles afterwards.

=== Early involvement with the Nazi Party ===

From 1929 onward, Charles Edward provided financial support to the Nazi Party. In 1932, Callenberg Castle was renovated with a Swastika added to a tower. The former duke was attracted by the party&#x27;s militarism and anti-communism. Hitler had also expressed opposition to the expropriation of royal property. Charles Edward was a useful ally for the Nazis in the period before they gained power, with extensive links in Franconia and across Germany.

In 1929, his support contributed to Coburg becoming the first town in Germany to elect a Nazi Party council. The election had taken place due to a dispute about a Nazi supporter being dismissed from his job for attacking Jews. Charles Edward&#x27;s visits to Nazi party events were covered in the local press, increasing the party&#x27;s profile and prestige.

Following the election of the Nazi Party locally in 1929, politically motivated violence against their opponents became common and tolerated by the local police. The Jewish population of Coburg also experienced growing amounts of physical abuse and discrimination. Rushton writes that the former duke&#x27;s publicly expressed beliefs and financial support contributed to the growth of hatred towards Jewish people in Coburg and Germany as a whole. It was widely known that Charles Edward and his wife were antisemitic. According to Rushton, Charles Edward would have been aware of the violent behaviour of the movements he was involved in but never objected. The First World War had convinced him of the merits of political violence.

The former duke and Waldemar Pabst established the &quot;Society for Studying Fascism&quot; in 1931. The organisation was meant to design a plan for governing Germany based on the example of Italian fascism. Mussolini&#x27;s dictatorship interested Charles Edward and others like him. It seemed to them that fascism was a method of running a country which could merge the traditional aristocracy and a new elite. The former duke was elected leader of the in 1932. This was a social club which had a membership largely composed of businessmen who disliked the postwar system of government. He encouraged them to join the Nazi Party and by the end of the year 70% had done so. Also in 1932, he took part in the creation of the Harzburg Front, through which the German National People&#x27;s Party and other groups with similar views became associated with the Nazi Party. He also publicly called on voters to support Hitler in the presidential election of 1932. While the Nazi party lost that election across Germany, they won in Coburg.

In 1932, Charles Edward&#x27;s daughter Sibylla married Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten, the eldest son of the Crown Prince of Sweden and second-in-line to the Swedish throne. The marriage meant that Sibylla would be expected to become Queen of Sweden (which however did not happen). Charles Edward used the event as a public display of his ideology and to improve the damaged prestige of the Duke&#x27;s family. More than a decade after the First World War it was a chance for them to appear important in international royal circles again. Coburg was decorated with Swedish and Nazi flags. 5000 men in Nazi uniforms marched outside Veste Coburg. Adolf Hitler and Hermann Göring congratulated the marriage.

George V stopped Edward, Prince of Wales, from attending the wedding due to objections to Charles Edward&#x27;s political views, although some of Charles Edward&#x27;s British relatives did attend. In Sweden, which was in a politically unstable situation with a growing republican movement, the wedding became quite controversial due to the symbolism used and as Gustaf was known to have Nazi sympathies. The Swedish government were promised that some changes would be made to the programme for the event but these were not fulfilled. The wedding received much coverage in the German and foreign press.

== Membership in the Nazi party ==
In 1933, the Nazi Party came to power in Germany. Charles Edward started flying the Nazi flag over Veste Coburg. He formally joined the Nazi Party in March 1933; he also became an in the (Storm Division). Meanwhile, a temporary prison was established in the middle of Coburg where Jewish people and opponents of the regime were tortured. No effort was made to keep this secret. The former duke was quickly given various ceremonial titles along with holding positions on the boards of multiple businesses. A photo collection of senior figures in the new regime published by a German private company included him at number 43. Charles Edward stated publicly in 1934 that he would &quot;blindly follow Hitler forever&quot;.

According to Urbach, the former duke became a &quot;highly honoured&quot; member of the party, appearing in photographs with its senior members and setting up an office in Berlin which he could use to form relationships. She wrote that he was proud of his Nazi Party membership and that the SA uniform allowed him to feel more like his pre-war self. He lost the right to use his SA uniform after the Night of the Long Knives, this upset him a great deal, but he accepted the politically motivated murders. He was later given a Wehrmacht general&#x27;s uniform. Some figures within the Nazi Party were suspicious of the former duke, suspecting that he was motivated by ambition or wanted to restore the monarchy. He awarded his own personal medal to a number of Nazi supporters until being stopped by the regime in 1936.

Charles Edward was made president of the National Socialist Automobile Association, an organisation which provided vehicles for the German state, including those used to carry out the Holocaust. From 1936 to 1945, he served as a member of the , representing the Nazi Party. In appointment diarieswhich he kept from 1932 to 1940he often expressed his enthusiastic support for the party. For instance, he recorded the results of the 1936 one-party election in detail and praised the outcome. Büschel commented that the former duke appeared to see himself as fully a German by this stage in his life. He described Charles Edward&#x27;s lifestyle during the period;... [The] importance that Carl Eduard had for the Hitler regime was evident in the luxury of apartments befitting his rank and the amenities of a large fleet of vehicles, diligent adjutants, administrators and servants as well as abundant foreign currency ... Carl Eduard lived more unmolested under National Socialism than in the Weimar Republic at the Coburg Castle and his numerous other castles. The dispute over properties in Thuringia and Austria, which had been confiscated by the state authorities after the end of the First World War, was soon resolved in favour of the ducal family, not least through the intervention of high-ranking National Socialist party members.

=== German Red Cross ===
On 1 December 1933, Charles Edward was appointed head of the (German Red Cross). Hitler approved the appointment because he knew the former duke well. He believed that Charles Edward was a supporter of the Nazis&#x27; ideas relating to race and eugenics. The former duke&#x27;s appointment also reflected a historic tradition of aristocrats participating in humanitarian activities. His links to European royalty meant he was considered a useful figurehead for the organisation abroad. He was expected to share power with the German Red Cross&#x27;s deputy leader Dr Paul Hocheisen. Over the early months of Charles Edward&#x27;s presidency, a power struggle occurred between the two men as the President tried to assert his authority within the organisation. In the summer of 1934, the party largely transferred control over the German Red Cross to Hocheisen.

The organisation was quickly made to conform with the government&#x27;s goals. Rushton commented that &quot;Two years after the founding of the new regime, the DRK [German Red Cross] was remodelled into a paramilitary organization with the goal of providing support for soldiers in a time of conflict&quot;. The treatment of political prisoners in Germanyopponents of the Nazis who had been imprisoned after they came to powerbecame a topic of international discussion in the early years of the regime. After the Swedish Red Cross requested an investigation into the subject in 1934, the International Red Cross began to make enquiries. The German Red Cross claimed that conditions for the prisoners were better than their usual quality of life. Charles Edward helped arrange for his friend, President of the International Red Cross Carl Jacob Burckhardt, to make a tightly controlled tour of the concentration camps, including Dachau, in 1935. Burckhardt privately felt that the camps were &quot;brutal&quot;, but his report was heavily censored and said that conditions were adequate. Burckhardt wrote to the former duke thanking him for organising the tour.

In 1937, Ernst-Robert Grawitz was appointed deputy leader to increase the organisation&#x27;s links with the SS. Charles Edward was made &quot;an officer of the chancellery of the Fuhrer&quot;, giving him access to private information on government business. The senior roles in the German Red Cross were increasingly filled by Nazi Party members, and members of the organisation were taught that &quot;the Jews, Slavs, chronically ill, handicapped ... were nothing more than worthless&quot;. Charles Edward gradually became less prominent in public within Germany during the regime&#x27;s early years and ceased to make domestic public appearances almost entirely after Grawitz&#x27;s appointment in 1937. The regime was becoming increasingly radical and saw the former duke as a symbol of the past.

=== Eugenics ===

Eugenicsthe fringe theory that a human population can be &quot;improved&quot; over generations by encouraging some people to have children and discouraging otherswas a concept that originated in the 19th century and became increasingly popular among German academic circles in the decades before the Nazis came to power. At the start of the 20th century, children born into poorer families tended to be less healthy, and more likely to develop behaviour that was considered destructive, compared with their richer counterparts. Therefore, it made implicit sense to some people that the differences between social classes might be genetic. Anxieties about the genetic health of the German nation were heightened by the First World War when large numbers of able-bodied men were killed or crippled, while men who were incapable of combat remained at home.

Growing amounts of scientific research into eugenics took place over subsequent years and Hitler endorsed the idea during the 1920s. The Great Depression intensified concern that disabled people were a drain on public resources, with scientists and non-Nazi politicians increasingly discussing the idea of voluntary sterilisation for these groups. The Nazi Party expressed strong support for eugenics during the early 1930s. In the early twentieth century, eugenic ideas received wide international support across the political spectrum and eugenic policies such as compulsory sterilisation of &quot;defectives&quot; were introduced in several countries. The theory lost mainstream support after WWII because of its use by the Nazis to justify mass murder.

Charles Edward was on the governing body of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute from 1933 to 1945. He was secretary of its executive board from 1934 to 1937. In those positions, he was involved in promoting eugenicist ideas to the German public, particularly to individuals with power in German society. The Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring introduced mandatory sterilisation for certain groups of people who were deemed an unwanted burden on the German nation. The German government organised multiple schemes to murder disabled people later on in the regime&#x27;s reign. The first scheme, targeted at children, ran from 1939 to the end of the war and killed 5,300 disabled children. The second scheme, which ran from late 1939 to mid-1941, killed more than 70,000 disabled people at six killing centres in Germany and Austriamainly through gassing. Grawitz was heavily involved in this. In August 1941, this scheme was stopped, as it was felt to be upsetting the German people and undermining their motivation in wartime. A third scheme in the later years of war used more covert methodsto a large extent deliberate starvation. It is estimated to have killed between 100,000 and 180,000 people.

Most evidence which could clarify the level of involvement of the German Red Cross in these events was destroyed, accidentally or deliberately, by the end of the war. While most transportation of victims was done by a proxy organisation created for that purpose, the German Red Cross was involved in transporting some of them. Many of the nurses who were involved in murdering disabled people were employees of the German Red Cross who had been indoctrinated by the organisation. Rushton believed that Charles Edward would have known about these schemes. He was a heavy consumer of media and had many social connections. Evidence collected by the regime at the time and later studies have suggested that it was common knowledge among the German population. Princess Maria Karoline, a member of the former duke&#x27;s extended family, was murdered by the programme in 1941even though upper-class disabled people generally had a degree of protection due to their use of private healthcare and their families&#x27; political connections. According to Rushton, Charles Edward had not intervened because &quot;he had not been concerned that anything would happen to her&quot;. He received a letter of condolence claiming that she had died of natural causes, which he did not believe. Unusually for a man who rarely missed family events, he did not attend the funeral.

=== Unofficial diplomat ===

The Nazi regime made significant use of Charles Edward as an informal diplomat. While the German Red Cross was essentially under the control of the regime, it was presented to a foreign audience as an independent humanitarian organisation. The former duke had little power over its domestic governance but acted as a significant international figurehead. Charles Edward made his first worldwide tour on behalf of the new German government in 1934. He visited Japan, where he attended a conference on the protection of civilians during war and delivered Hitler&#x27;s birthday greeting to Emperor Hirohito. The conference allowed Charles Edward to be seen by a global audience as a humanitarian figure, improving the regime&#x27;s international reputation. Hitler was interested in an alliance with the Japanese government and Charles Edward used the visit to develop links with the Japanese royal family. In a report he wrote about the tour for Hitler, the former duke often expressed prejudiced views and complained about perceived Jewish influence in the United States.

Charles Edward was particularly significant to Nazi attempts to cultivate pro-German sentiments among the British aristocracy. Urbach commented that Charles Edward went on &quot;endless reconnaissance trips [to Britain] in the 1930s&quot;. He wanted to help the German government establish an alliance with the British and also have Claremont House returned to him personally. Urbach wrote that Charles Edward reintegrated himself into aristocratic social life in Britain, with the help of his sister, and associated with prominent aristocrats and politicians. These people included Neville Chamberlain, who became British prime minister in 1937, and the British royal familyespecially Edward, Prince of Wales who had strongly pro-German views. The former duke was president of the (GermanEnglish society) and lobbied Britons believed to be pro-German. He was made head of the organisation after the regime decided that it was not pro-Nazi enough. He attended George V&#x27;s funeral in a German military uniform and helmet. He also visited veterans&#x27; meetings in the United Kingdom. The British Secretary of State for War, Duff Cooper described a party that was organised on Charles Edward&#x27;s behalf at Alice&#x27;s country home in 1936;The point of it was to meet the Duke of Coburg, her brother. It was a gloomy little party—so like a German bourgeois household ... I was tactfully left alone with the Duke of Coburg after luncheon in order that he might explain to me the present situation in Germany and assure me of Hitler&#x27;s pacific intentions. In the middle of our conversation his Duchess [Victoria Adelaide] reappeared carrying some hideous samples of ribbon in order to consult him as to how the wreath that they were sending to the funeral [of George V&#x27;s] should be tied. He dismissed her with a volley of muttered German curses and was afterwards unable to pick up the thread of his argument.Zeepvat argued that Charles Edward&#x27;s advocacy had little success and that he failed to understand the degree to which the people he had grown up around by this time saw him as a foreigner. In contrast, Urbach argued in her 2015 book that the strains experienced by British society during the interwar period had a radicalising effect on sections of the British elite and that there was significant sympathy for fascismalbeit discomfort with Nazism in particularamong the aristocracy. She suggested that Charles Edward may have had some influence on instances of appeasement of Germany in the 1930s, such as the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, British acceptance of the German remilitarisation of the Rhineland and the Munich Agreement.Charles Edward hosted an international press tour associated with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor&#x27;s visit to Germany in 1937. He also hosted Edward and Wallis Simpson themselves during their visit. He visited Italy in 1938, meeting King Victor Emmanuel III and dictator Benito Mussolini. He went on a trip to Poland where he met Polish officials half a year before the country was invaded by Germany and the Soviet Union.

In 1940, Charles Edward travelled through Moscow and Japan to the US, where he met President Roosevelt at the White House. He claimed that the German Red Cross was protecting the welfare of the recently conquered Polish people. The American Red Cross was quite hostile to the visit and there was some criticism in US newspapersoverall, however, he was fairly well received in the US press. In a private report, the German embassy in Washington claimed that the Duke&#x27;s personal appeal had prevented the visit from going badly wrong diplomatically for the Germans. The former duke signed an agreement with the American Red Cross allowing them to send humanitarian aid to Poland, though much of this was ultimately confiscated by the SS. In Japan, he worked to improve relations between the German and Japanese governments after the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact had caused a dispute between them. He went on a visit to Japanese-occupied Manchukuotouring hospitals and similar institutions with journalists. Büschel suggests that this was likely an attempt, by the Japanese authorities, to convince world opinion that people in Manchukuo were being given suitable humanitarian assistance by their new rulers.

===Second World War===
Charles Edward was again on the opposite side of a war to his birth country when the Second World War broke out in 1939there is no evidence that it caused him any distress or led him to doubt his political convictions. Although the former duke was too old for active service, his three sons served in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. In 1941, he began to use a diary to note down news about the war, using different coloured pens for different sources of information. When his son, Hubertus, died in an air crash in 1943, he noted in the diary &quot;&quot; (Hubertus died for the Fatherland). He underlined the shorthand cross for death in the colour he used for reports from the Wehrmacht. In 1942, Charles Edward was asked by his relative Prince Eugene of Sweden to arrange for Martha Liebermann, an elderly Jewish woman, to be granted permission to emigrate to the United States. He did nothing to help and Liebermann later took her own life after being ordered to report for deportation to Theresienstadt Ghetto.

Charles Edward&#x27;s support for Nazism grew more intense during the war years and never relented. Hitler considered making him King of Norway after the war. The former duke probably ceased to act as an informal diplomat after 1940. His health was declining and he appeared older than his years. He continued to wear uniforms and travelled to countries that were either occupied by Germany, members of the Axis powers or neutral. A 1941 edition of , a newsreel circulated in German-occupied France, discussed him visiting the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and undertaking German Red Cross activities in France. Travelling abroad was a privilege afforded to few German civilians during the war years. It is unclear what Charles Edward was doing politically during that period, but he was being paid 4,000 Reichsmarks a month by the German government, from a fund Hitler had organised for associates that were useful to him. In 1940, Charles Edward helped mediate a diplomatic dispute between the British and German governments about the treatment of prisoners of war, stopping a number of prisoners on both sides from being shackled. In 1943, at Hitler&#x27;s behest, Charles Edward asked the International Red Cross to investigate the Katyn massacre.

In April 1945, code breakers at Bletchley Park deciphered an order from Hitler stating that Charles Edward should not be allowed to be captured. According to Urbach, that meant Hitler wanted him killed. That month, Charles Edward agreed to the surrender of Veste Coburg to US forces. He gained their assistance in putting out a fire in the castle museum which had been started by the bombardment. He was on the US Army&#x27;s list of suspected war criminals and was put under house arrest, until being moved to a prisoner of war camp in November. He was questioned and drank wine with his captors in one of the castle&#x27;s sitting rooms. His interrogators saw him as ignorant, obnoxious and possibly mentally unstable. He said in an interview that he would accept an offer to participate in a new German government, made a series of demands relating to the idea, and claimed that &quot;no German is guilty of any war crimes&quot;. The comments were deemed so useful for Allied propaganda that they were used in a radio broadcast in April 1945. He also expressed the view that it had been right to remove Jews from public life and that Germans were naturally unsuited to democracy.

== Postwar period and death ==

=== Trial and final years ===
After the end of the Second World War, Charles Edward was interned by the American military authorities from 1945 to 1946. His sister lobbied for his release on health grounds. After his release, he and Victoria Adelaide moved into a cottage outside Callenberg Castle. The castle was being used as a home for refugees. Alice visited the couple in 1948; according to her account, they were impoverished and her brother was severely unwell with arthritis. She persuaded the authorities to let them move into part of one of his residences, closer to where her sister-in-law could buy food.In April 1946, Charles Edward&#x27;s daughter Sibylla gave birth to a son, Carl Gustaf, who at birth was third in the line of succession to the Swedish throne. In January 1947, Sibylla&#x27;s husband died in a plane crash, and in October 1950, Gustaf V of Sweden died, at which point Charles Edward&#x27;s grandson became Crown Prince of Sweden, later becoming King Carl XVI Gustaf.

Charles Edward&#x27;s trial spanned four years and included two appeals. Alice and many other associates dishonestly spoke on his behalf, minimising his involvement in the regime. A year or so after the war, the priority of the Western Allies had shifted away from punishing former Nazis towards preparing their occupation zones to become part of the Western Bloc during the Cold War. In 1950 (or August 1949, according to his &quot;ODNB&quot; entry), the former duke was found by a denazification court to be a and (roughly: &#x27;follower&#x27; and &#x27;follower of lesser guilt&#x27;). The former duke&#x27;s biographer Carl Sandler called the result a &quot;farce&quot;. Charles Edward also lost significant property due to his participation in the Second World War. His property in Gotha, situated in the Soviet occupation zone, was .

Charles Edward spent the last years of his life in seclusion, forced into relative poverty by the fines he had been required to pay by the denazification tribunal, and the seizure of much of his property by the Soviets. However, his lifestyle to a large extent returned to normal after his trial. In 1953, he was taken by ambulance and wheelchair to view the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom at a cinema in Coburg. He reportedly appeared to be close to crying while watching his relatives, including his sister. According to a column published that year in &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, the former duke had reestablished links with the Seaforth Highlanders, a British Army regiment of which he had once been colonel-in-chief, which was now stationed in Germany. The column commented that:On the occasion of a regimental ball, an invitation was sent to the Duke, with a note from the C.O. (Lieut.-Colonel P. J. Johnston) saying that, owing to the distance, it was doubtful if he would be able to attend, but it was the wish of all officers of the battalion that their old Colonel-in-Chief should be asked. The Duke replied that, although his health did not allow him to accept, he was deeply touched by the invitation, &quot;renewing old connections which existed between the Seaforth Highlanders and myself for so many years, and which I honestly hope and wish will not be severed again&quot;. He said he would be pleased to receive as guest any comrade who should happen to pass Coburg, where he lives, and signed himself &quot;Charles Edward. Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Duke of Albany.&quot; 

=== Death ===
Charles Edward died of cancer in his flat in Coburg on 6 March 1954, at the age of 69. He had reportedly told his son Friedrich Josias that Queen Victoria had always wanted him to be a &quot;good German&quot;. His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; commented that &quot;... he was Hitler&#x27;s man ... Whether, and to what extent, he was admitted to the inner council of the Nazi gang is as yet an open question.&quot; Representatives of various royal houses across Europe sent condolences but the British royal family did not comment.

Charles Edward&#x27;s funeral was held on 10 March and presided over by a Lutheran dean who had been a church official under the Nazi regime. He said Charles Edward was a good man who had been manipulated by others and mistreated by the Allies. The former duke&#x27;s death was officially mourned in Coburg. A civil servant who refused to fly a flag at half mast for his funeral was reported to the district council in Bayreuth and condemned by a member of the Parliament of Bavaria. Victoria Adelaide received many letters of support in the weeks after her husband&#x27;s death, including from former senior Nazis. Charles Edward&#x27;s burial took place on 12 October, watched by a crowd of well-wishers. He is buried at the Waldfriedhof Cemetery () near Callenberg Castle, in the Beiersdorf district of Coburg.

==Legacy==

=== Family perceptions ===
His sister&#x27;s autobiography &quot;For My Grandchildren&quot; (1966) discusses Charles Edward&#x27;s life. She felt that her brother had been a victim of prejudice during the First World War and only chose to stay in Germany due to his family. She suggested that he had a minimal role in the Nazi regime. Urbach argued that the autobiography is intentionally misleading and selective. In his biography of Alice, published in 1981, Aronson commented that some members of the British royal family felt that Charles Edward had supported the regime &quot;due to his conviction that Hitler had saved Germany from Communism&quot;. He wrote that Alice felt that her brother had been poorly treated while imprisoned after the end of the war&quot;he found conditions almost unbearable. ... Many of his fellow prisoners died there ...&quot;but also told him &quot;No doubt, their jailers had seen some of the ghastly German concentration camps and were determined to treat these old officers with the utmost severity&quot;.

Rudolf Preisner, an amateur historian from Coburg, wrote the first biography of Charles Edward&#x27;s life in 1977. The former duke&#x27;s son Friedrich Josias wrote a letter to Preisner criticising the book. Among other errors, he felt that the book was overly sympathetic to his father, who he believed knew about the Holocaust. He wrote that his brother, Hubertus, had witnessed deportations of Jewish people to extermination camps and often talked about the subject with the family. Friedrich Josias planned to write a biography about his father but never did so.

=== 21st-century portrayals ===
In December 2007, Britain&#x27;s Channel 4 aired an hour-long documentary called &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Favourite Royal&quot; about Charles Edward&quot;.&quot; A review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the film as &quot;A solid documentary on a feeble man and a wretched family.&quot; Another review in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; suggested the documentary had been overly sympathetic to Charles Edward, stating that the &quot;story emerged as a tale of pure tragedy. Which it undoubtedly was, in parts&quot;, but that he was depicted &quot;as if the trauma of being elevated to a dukedom and losing it had somehow robbed him of his ability to tell right from wrong.&quot;

Urbach wrote that there was some disagreement among the production team of the 2007 documentary, on whether Charles Edward should be portrayed as a man who struggled with politics in a country that was foreign to him, or as an ideological Nazi, and that this led to a contradictory depiction of his character. She said that the recovery of new evidence during the period between 2007 and 2015 showed that he was &quot;obviously not a naive victim of circumstances but a very active supporter of Hitler&quot;. Urbach argued that Charles Edward had a similar kind of character to Hitler, commenting that the two men shared &quot;ideologies and of course their narcissistic personalities (the only creatures they both declared a fondness for were their dogs).&quot; She also described his life as &quot;an example of thorough re-education ... away from the constitutional monarchy he was reared in to dictatorship.&quot; Urbach&#x27;s 2015 book &quot;Go Betweens for Hitler&quot; discusses how various aristocrats including Charles Edward acted as informal diplomats for Nazi Germany. A review in &quot;The Times&quot; commented on Charles Edward that: For many years thereafter [the German Revolution], Carl Eduard was regarded as a mere footnote in history; a harmless, potty old aristocrat, washed up by the seismic upheavals of the early 20th century. However, that benign interpretation has been recently revised. We now know that Carl Eduard was a member of the Nazi Party, a sponsor of paramilitary terrorism andas Urbach&#x27;s excellent book demonstratesan important &#x27;go-between&#x27; for Hitler.Büschel suggested in his 2016 biography of Charles Edward that the various pressures placed on the nobleman from childhood until the outcome of the First World War may have led to him developing split personality disorder and narcissism. The writer argues that the Nazi regime allowed the former duke to regain much of the status he had lost after the First World War. He commented that Charles Edward was influenced by &quot;coercion, fear, indoctrination, the effort to &quot;stay on top&quot;, and probably also inner homelessness and loneliness&quot;. He suggests this was similar to many of the Duke&#x27;s German contemporaries. However, Büschel believed that Charles Edward freely chose to support the Nazi regime when the option of leaving Germany would have been fairly easy for him. He wrote that the former duke was the most active and enthusiastic of the regime&#x27;s aristocratic supporters. He describes Charles Edward as a &quot;second-tier perpetrator&quot;: someone who was not a central figure in the regime, but who helped to conceal policies that would lead to the deaths of millions of people.

Rushton, in his 2018 book about the former duke&#x27;s relationship to the murder of disabled people, described Charles Edward&#x27;s life as &quot;the story of a man born to royalty who became ensnared in the politics of human destruction. It is a tragic story.&quot; Rushton suggested there would have been risks to Charles Edward and his family if he had chosen to object to any actions of the regime, giving examples of other former nobles who were persecuted. Rushton noted that Charles Edward had already lost his status as a British prince and German duke, making his new identity as a Nazi party leader deeply emotionally important to him. Rushton argued that the factors affecting Charles Edward&#x27;s behaviour were similar to many Germans. However, the historian also noted that the former duke had a close friendship with Hitler, and argued that he could have encouraged Hitler to stop certain atrocities. The writer felt that Charles Edward&#x27;s failure to respond to the murder of a member of his extended family indicated that he was &quot;weak-willed&quot;. He argued that this &quot;... reflects a moral character defect... low self-esteem and little self-respect ... [lack of action is often due to] fear of others&#x27; opinions in the community and the risk to one&#x27;s comfortable and secure lifestyle&quot;. 

In 2015, a local dispute took place in Coburg about whether a street should be named after Max Brose, a businessman who had links to the Nazi regime. In response to this, the Coburg town council commissioned a group of historians to investigate why support for the Nazis had developed unusually quickly in Coburg and events in the town during the period. The commission, which reported its findings in 2024, noted that Charles Edward was an influential figure in the town, and that his support for organisations contributed to the growth of far-right politics.

<doc id="433229" wikidata="Q1032150" url="?curid=433229" title="Canadian Heritage Rivers System">
<text>The Canadian Heritage Rivers System (CHRS; ) is a joint program administered by the federal, provincial, and territorial governments to conserve and protect the best examples of Canada&#x27;s river heritage, to give them national recognition, and to encourage the public to enjoy and appreciate them. It is a cooperative program of the governments of Canada, nine provinces, and the three territories. A 14-member national board, created under the Parks Canada Agency Act, administers the program and approves the designation of specific rivers.

Individual jurisdictions can co-nominate and co-designate their respective rivers or river segments in accordance with guidance from the program Charter, and Strategic Plan, and the Principles, Procedures and Operational Guidelines (PPOG).

== History ==
The Canadian Heritage Rivers System was established in 1984. The first Canadian Heritage River was the French River in Ontario, designated in 1986.

By 1996 there were 29 designated rivers.

Quebec withdrew its participation in 2006. There are currently 42 designated, and one nominated river or river segments; with rivers designated in every province and territory except for Quebec.

The most recent designation under the Canadian Heritage Rivers System has been a 718-kilometre segment of the North Saskatchewan River in Alberta, which was originally nominated by Smoky Lake County in 2021, and finally designated in 2024 and extends the 49-kilometre portion within Banff National Park which was originally recognized in 1989. 

== Designated rivers ==
The rivers currently designated as a Canadian Heritage River are:

==Nominated rivers==
== Quebec participation ==
Quebec is the only province or territory to not have a designated or nominated river. The province withdrew its participation in the Canadian Heritage Rivers System in 2006.

Quebec&#x27;s lack of participation affects nominations and designations for rivers shared with other provinces. In 1998, the New Brunswick portion of the Restigouche River was designated (as &quot;Upper Restigouche&quot;), while the Quebec portion was not. The Ottawa River was nominated in 2007 and designated in 2016, but only the Ontario portion of the river was included. The federal government says it&#x27;s working with Quebec &quot;to establish recognition of the heritage value of Quebec&#x27;s stretch of the Outaouais River&quot;.

== Recent program updates ==
Changes to the program&#x27;s Principles, Procedures and Operational Guidelines, and the latest Strategic Plan have aimed to modernize the system. 

Specifically, the 2020-2030 Strategic Plan identifies four priorities: 

* Advancing Reconciliation on Canadian Heritage Rivers
* Strengthening the Canadian Heritage Rivers Network
* Excellence in River Management and Conservation
* Engaging Canadians in Celebrating and Stewarding Heritage Rivers

== Awards ==
The organization has two awards, the Heritage River Award and the Canadian River Stewardship Award. Previous recipients of the Heritage River Award include:

* American Heritage Rivers, America&#x27;s counterpart to the Canadian Heritage Rivers System

<doc id="433230" wikidata="Q1026846" url="?curid=433230" title="California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo">
<text>California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) is a public university in San Luis Obispo, California, United States. Founded in 1901, it is the oldest of three polytechnic universities within the California State University system. Cal Poly emphasizes a “learn by doing” philosophy, integrating hands-on, practical experiences into its curriculum. As of fall 2022, Cal Poly had approximately 21,000 undergraduate and 800 graduate students. Cal Poly is well-regarded for its undergraduate programs, having been ranked first among regional universities in the Western United States in the 2025 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings. The university is home to several nationally recognized programs, particularly in engineering, architecture, and business, with the College of Engineering and the Orfalea College of Business standing out for their academic excellence and industry connections. Most of the university&#x27;s athletic teams participate in the Big West Conference.

==History==
=== Establishment and early years ===
Cal Poly was founded in 1901 as the California Polytechnic School, following the signing of the California Polytechnic School Bill by Governor Henry Gage. The school began classes on October 1, 1903, with 20 students enrolled, offering three-year secondary-level courses.

Originally coeducational, the school enrolled 16 male and 4 female students. In 1929, California Governor C.C. Young prohibited women from attending. Women were readmitted in 1956. By Fall 2023, female students constituted 50.1% of the total student population.

=== Transition to higher education ===
In 1924, Cal Poly came under the control of the California State Board of Education. During the Great Depression, financial constraints led to discussions in Sacramento about converting Cal Poly into a state prison. It was saved by Julian A. McPhee, who went on to lead Cal Poly as its president for thirty-three years.

In 1933, the institution transitioned to a two-year technological and vocational school. By 1940, it began offering Bachelor of Arts degrees, with the first baccalaureate ceremony held in 1942. In 1947, the school was renamed California State Polytechnic College to better reflect its expanding higher education offerings. A Master of Arts degree in education was added in 1949.

=== Expansion and satellite campuses ===
In 1938, Charles and Jerry Voorhis donated a farm and school to the Cal Poly. In 1949, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation gifted an 812-acre horse ranch in Pomona, California. Originally a satellite campus for Cal Poly, the Pomona campus became an independent university, Cal Poly Pomona, in 1966.

=== Integration into the CSU system ===
In 1960, control of Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo and other state colleges was transferred to the newly formed CSU system. That same year, a plane crash killed 22 of the 48 people on board, including 16 Cal Poly football players.

Authorized to offer Master of Science degrees in 1967, Cal Poly reorganized its curriculum from 1967 to 1970 into specialized schools: the School of Science and Mathematics, the School of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and the School of Architecture. In 1968, Cal Poly&#x27;s FM radio station, KCPR, was launched as a senior project.

In 1971, the California State Legislature officially renamed the institution &quot;California Polytechnic State University&quot;. Since the 1970s, the university has seen steady enrollment growth and significant campus expansion.

=== Major donations and 21st century developments ===
On May 3, 2017, Cal Poly received a $110 million gift from alumni William L. and Linda Frost, one of the largest donations ever made to public education in California.

In 2024, the CSU system recommended integrating Cal Maritime with Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo.

==Campus==
Cal Poly has one of the largest college campuses in the United States, covering 9,178 acres and making it the second-largest land-holding university in California. The property includes the main campus, two agricultural lands, and two sites in Santa Cruz County. The Swanton Pacific Ranch, a 3,200-acre ranch in Santa Cruz County, provides educational and research opportunities, encompassing rangeland, livestock, and forestry operations for the College of Agriculture, Food, and Environmental Sciences. It supports Cal Poly&#x27;s “Learn by Doing” philosophy with an emphasis on sustainable agricultural practices and laboratory experiments. University House serves as the university president&#x27;s residence. 

=== 21st century construction ===
In the summer of 2018, a dormitory-style student community was completed at the corner of Slack Street and Grand Avenue. This development includes seven 3- to 5-story concrete-framed freshman residence hall buildings with 1,475 beds and an adjacent four-level parking structure. Community spaces feature a café, community room, game room, mail room, welcome center, offices, and maintenance shop. Additional site improvements provide a large open space for activities and group events, volleyball and basketball courts, and outdoor gathering areas.

The Warren J. Baker Center for Science and Mathematics was dedicated on November 1, 2013. This $119 million, six-story building replaced the aging “spider” Science Building 52 with a new 189,000-square-foot structure. It includes laboratories, classrooms, offices for the physics, chemistry, and soil science programs, and spaces for the Western Coatings Technologies Center and the Environmental Biotechnology Institute. The center also features Centennial Park, a landscaped central green area.

===Commuting===
Campus parking is limited, with 2,892 general-purpose parking spaces, 3,492 dorm resident spaces, and a total of 8,648 parking spaces. The Facilities Master Plan acknowledges that, despite adding more parking spots, the ratio of parking to students will decrease due to expected enrollment growth. To address this, the plan emphasizes reducing demand for individual vehicle parking by constructing additional dorms and enhancing campus life. Cal Poly Commuter and Access Services has successfully promoted alternatives to single occupancy vehicles, with bus use more than doubling and bicycle use nearly quadrupling from 2002 to 2012.

As of 2024, there are over 7,000 bike rack spaces and 252 secure bike lockers on campus. In 2019, approximately 57% of students and 33% of faculty/staff lived within five miles of campus, facilitating easy bike commutes. The city&#x27;s SLO Transit bus system provides service to and from campus. Cal Poly supports SLO Transit with funding from parking citation revenue, allowing faculty, staff, and students to ride for free. The SLO Regional Transit Authority provides bus service throughout the county, with discounted passes available to the Cal Poly community.

Projects may include design or construction experiences, experiments, self-guided studies or research projects, presentations, reports based on internships or co-ops, public portfolio displays, or performances. These projects often lead to job offers or recognition. Notable examples include Punchd, acquired by Google, and Jamba Juice, inspired by a senior project idea. The campus area known as ‘Architecture Graveyard’ hosts many senior projects, including experimental and unconventional structures.

<text>Powergaming (also known as power gaming, min maxing, or optimization) is a style of interacting with games or game-like systems, particularly video games, boardgames, and role-playing games, with the aim of maximizing progress towards a specific goal. Other players may consider this disruptive when done to the exclusion of all other considerations, such as storytelling, atmosphere, and camaraderie. When focusing on the letter of the rules over the spirit of the rules, it is often seen as unsporting, un-fun, or unsociable. This behavior is most often found in games with a wide range of game features, lengthy campaigns, or prize tournaments such as massively multiplayer or collectible games.

== Description ==
Powergaming in roleplaying games can take several forms. One form is the deliberate creation of optimal player characters (PCs), with the aim of maximizing the power the player wields in the game world. This is known as min-maxing, due to the practice of maximizing desirable or &quot;powerful&quot; traits while minimizing underpowered or less useful traits. Such characters often draw criticism for not fitting the theme and tone of the game world, or for being difficult to challenge. Another form of powergaming involves a focus on acquiring power during game progression, often by acquiring powerful equipment or unusual abilities. This lends itself to gameplay that is materialistic (and often, in the context of the game world, arguably immoral) and can frustrate other players who are looking to interact with the game world, score points, and not merely acquire game resources. Another term for a powergamer is a munchkin, who may be differentiated from normal powergamers to describe players who seek to acquire power and loot at the expense and disregard of their teammates.

In online text-based role-playing games that emphasize collaborative role-play over acquiring levels or skills, players can be described as powergamers if they presume or declare that their own action against another player character is successful without giving the other player character the freedom to act on their own prerogative. They may also be a player who tries to force others to participate in unwanted role-playing. For instance, a player who unilaterally describes their character as doing something with (or to) another character that would usually require the other to play along — such as having a fight or a sexual encounter — is considered to be powergaming. In such games, in which a sense of community and rapport between players is seen as crucial and conducive to the game&#x27;s overall well-being, powergaming is generally regarded as extremely offensive behavior if it is not stated in the rules as being a punishable offense (including, but not limited to, banning). It is often seen as synonymous with twinking or &quot;godmoding&quot;.

In video games, powergamers enjoy being at the bleeding edge of progression of their selected game, taking part in every activity that yields the fastest progression, and bypassing the &quot;lesser&quot; activities or any other secondary job, trait, or skill. This is a wide generalization, however. A player who likes to maximize all aspects of the game and do so in an expedient manner is also classified as a powergamer, often seeing more of the world than the &quot;average&quot; player would.

<text>John Sigfried Johnson (May 11, 1873 – January 17, 1934) was an early American cyclist and speed skater. He was born as Johan Sigfrid Jonsson in Sweden and emigrated with his parents to Minnesota in the United States in 1881.

Johnson was the first to bicycle 1-mile in less than two minutes, or 1:56.6. This happened in 1892 at a racing track in Independence, Iowa. Besides racing on the track, early in his career he also competed in road races. Johnson was also a world record holder in speed skating, and won world championship titles in both sports. Later in his career, Johnson rode for racing teams sponsored by the bicycle manufacturers E.C. Stearns Bicycle Agency of Syracuse, N.Y., and Schwinn Bicycle Co. of Chicago. He retired from competitive cycling in 1900. He died January 17, 1934, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

<doc id="433248" wikidata="Q1471335" url="?curid=433248" title="New Deal (United Kingdom)">
<text>The New Deal (renamed Flexible New Deal from October 2009) was a workfare programme introduced in the United Kingdom by the first New Labour government in 1998, initially funded by a one-off £5 billion windfall tax on privatised utility companies. The stated purpose was to reduce unemployment by providing training, subsidised employment and voluntary work to the unemployed. Spending on the New Deal was £1.3 billion in 2001.

The New Deal was a cornerstone of New Labour and devised mainly by LSE Professor Richard Layard, who has since been elevated to the House of Lords as a Labour peer. It was based on similar workfare models in Sweden, which Layard has spent much of his academic career studying.

==Purpose==
The New Deal had, as its signature, the power to withdraw benefits from those who &#x27;refused reasonable employment&#x27;. &#x27;Workfare&#x27; in the UK can arguably be traced back to 1986, and compulsory &#x27;Restart&#x27; interviews for claimants after a certain period, and as such the first introduction of &#x27;conditionalities&#x27; with the possible outcome of &#x27;sanctions&#x27; for perceived non-compliance. The &#x27;New Deal&#x27; replaced the previous workfare programme of the then-Conservative government of John Major, &#x27;Project Work&#x27;, which had been launched in the early 90s.

A further project was introduced in 1999, the Working Families Tax Credit, a tax credit scheme for low income workers which was meant to provide an incentive to work, and to continue in work.

Professor Richard Beaudry, from the Department of Economics at the University of York, defined the New Deal as follows in a 2002 paper, &quot;Workfare and Welfare: Britain’s New Deal&quot; (pp. 8–9) : &quot;The New Deal reforms promise eventual reform of welfare assistance for all benefit recipients.&quot;

==New Deal Programmes==

Although originally targeting the young unemployed (18- to 24-year-olds), the New Deal programmes subsequently targeted other groups. These include:

• New Deal for Young People (NDYP) received by far the greatest proportion of New Deal funding (£3.15 billion through to 2002 ). It targeted unemployed youth (aged 18–24) unemployed for 6 months or longer.

• New Deal 25+ targeted those aged at least 25 years who were unemployed for eighteen months or more. In terms of funding, £350 million was allocated up to 2002.

• New Deal for Lone Parents targeted single parents with school age children. £200 million was directly allocated to the program, not including additional assistance for child-care.

• New Deal for the Disabled targeted those with disabilities in receipt of Incapacity and similar benefits. £200 million was budgeted for the program up to 2002 (Peck, “Workfare” 304-305). This was superseded by the &#x27;Work Capability Assessment&#x27;, introduced by the Brown government in 2008, and administered by Atos Healthcare.

• New Deal 50+ targeted those aged 50 and older.

• New Deal for Musicians was a little-known element aimed at unemployed musicians.

==Referral procedure==

The greatest emphasis of the first New Labour government was the NDYP, which was a pilot phase for more ambitious New Deal reforms with other groups. The NDYP began with an initial compulsory &#x27;consultation session&#x27;, referred to as &#x27;Gateway&#x27;, that focused on improving job search and interview skills. This training was provided by a third-party organisation from the workfare industry such as a4e, a quango such as CSV or a charity spin-off such as YMCA Training. If an employment search still proved unsuccessful after the Gateway sessions, to continue to receive Job Seeker&#x27;s Allowance, one of four options had to be chosen:

• A subsidised job placement. The subsidy being £60 per week, and lasting 6 months; a £750 training allowance was also available to participants. Those taking part were not paid wages.

• Full-time education and training, for up to 12 months. 

• Work in the voluntary sector, called the &#x27;Community Task Force&#x27;: those taking part were paid JSA plus a £15 training allowance.

• Work with the Environmental Task Force.(DWP website; Peck, “Workfare” 304; Glyn 53)

Participation in one of the four options was mandatory in order to be still able to claim JSA, refusal to participate led to &#x27;sanctions&#x27; - withdrawal of JSA, and referral to a &#x27;Decision Maker&#x27; who decided the outcome of &#x27;sanctions&#x27; on the claimant.

==Flexible New Deal==
A new scheme, called the &#x27;Flexible New Deal&#x27;, was introduced in October 2009, aimed at revamping the programme that had, by then, been in existence for more than a decade. Following the formation of the Conservative-led coalition government after the General Election of May 2010, Tory minister Chris Grayling announced the end of the New Deal that October. Grayling said the scheme had cost over £31,000 per job placement. Although the figure quoted was correct at the time, the project was front-loaded with costs and lagged in results; given another 11 months, the cost per head would have been roughly half of the quoted figure. The New Deal was replaced in the Summer of 2011 by the Coalition Government&#x27;s Single Work Programme.

==Steps to Work==

Steps to Work was the replacement for the New Deal in Northern Ireland and is still in existence. It is administered by the Department for Employment and Learning through its Jobs and Benefits Office. Steps to Work came into effect in 2008 and consists of largely the same provisions as the New Deal with the exception that payment by the Department is now more focused towards employment outcomes – and thus payment to workfare third parties – than previously.

==Criticisms==
Critics claim that participants failed to see the value in the programmes and the programmes were not effective in equipping participants for work.

<doc id="433253" wikidata="Q1361414" url="?curid=433253" title="List of political parties in Afghanistan">
<text>Political parties are banned in Afghanistan under the current Taliban government. Previously, the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan had a multi-party system in development with numerous political parties, in which no one party often had a chance of gaining power alone, and parties had to work with each other to form coalition governments. No political party was permitted to exist that advocated anything deemed to go against Islamic morality.

The Taliban movement took over the government by force in 2021, and has since ruled the country unopposed. In September 2022, Acting Deputy Minister of Justice Maulvi Abdul Karim stated that there is &quot;no need&quot; for political parties to be active. On 16 August 2023, the Taliban government formally banned all political parties in Afghanistan in a decree announced by Acting Justice Minister Abdul Hakim Haqqani, because according to them, there is no concept of political party in the Sharia and the political parties do not serve Afghanistan&#x27;s interests.
==Major parties under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan==
All parties are now banned; the following is a list of major parties during the rule of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The law governing the formation of political parties was promulgated in 2009, and required parties to have at least 10,000 members, (previously they had only needed 700 members).
==Minor parties under the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan==
==Former parties==
The following is a list of historical parties disestablished prior to the founding of the Islamic Republic. Since the coup in 1973, Afghanistan has had many different political parties. These include Mohammed Daoud Khan&#x27;s National Revolutionary Party of Afghanistan, the People&#x27;s Democratic Party and the Democratic Watan Party of Afghanistan from the communist era, and the Northern Alliance that took power after the Fall of Kabul in April 1992, and ran the country until the Taliban&#x27;s coup in 1996.

<text>The Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) is the largest and longest-running Mars surface research facility and is one of two simulated Mars analog habitats owned and operated by the Mars Society.

The MDRS station was built in the early 2000s near Hanksville, Utah, in the western United States. It is crewed by small teams who conduct scientific research.

The MDRS campus includes a two-story habitat with a greenhouse, a solar and a robotic observatory, an engineering pod and a science building.

== Background ==
The MDRS station is situated on the San Rafael Swell of Southern Utah, by road northwest of Hanksville, Utah. It is the second such analogue research station to be built by the Mars Society, following the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station or FMARS on Devon Island in Canada&#x27;s high Arctic.

The Mars Society launched the Mars Analog Research Station Project with the stated goal of developing knowledge needed to prepare for the human exploration of Mars. The project&#x27;s goals are to develop field tactics based on environmental constraints (i.e., being required to work in spacesuits), test habitat design features and tools, and assess crew selection protocols. Although much warmer than Mars, the desert location was selected because of its Mars-like terrain and appearance.

The MDRS aims to realistically simulate Mars living conditions. During mission periods, crew members must wear an analogue space suit simulator when completing tasks outside their living quarters, which is a metal building with an airlock. Analogue space suit simulators include a helmet, jumpsuit, boots, gaiters, gloves, an air supply pack, water pack, and a radio. Hand-held radios mounted on the suits&#x27; helmets with externally mounted push-to-talk northeast switches are used to communicate with the Habitat and with fellow Mars surface explorers on the same extra-vehicular activity (EVA). 

Destinations for EVAs can be chosen from an established way-point database, and attained either on foot, or by all-terrain vehicle.

MDRS is owned and operated by the Mars Society, which selects the crews and handles most of the administrative tasks. The Mars Society is an international, non-profit organization that works with governments to promote Mars exploration through various projects such as M.A.R.S., the Mars Analogue Pressurized Rover Competition, and the ARCHIMEDES Mars balloon mission.

The MDRS hosts a training program funded by NASA which hosts teachers to participate in projects meant to simulate the living environment on the moon or Mars. In this program, participants conduct field research and live onsite for several weeks.

==Research==
Each crew establishes different scientific goals they hope to accomplish during their time at MDRS. The majority of biological research involves extremophiles. Bacteria and algae isolated from the surrounding desert are common subjects of study. These microorganisms have been studied for their DNA, their diversity, and the environments in which they thrive. For example, in a study for methanogens, researchers studied soil and vapor samples from five different desert environments in Utah, Idaho, and California in the United States, Canada, and Chile. Of these, five soil samples and three vapor samples from the vicinity of the MDRS were found to have signs of viable methanogens.

Crews often study endoliths found in rocks at the MDRS. These species of bacteria are capable of living inside rocks and obtaining the energy they need by photosynthesizing the light that penetrates the rocks. These extreme organisms are a popular subject of research at MDRS for both geologists and biologists.

Other experiments include a study of the effect of extra-vehicular activity (EVA) on the heart rates and blood pressures of crew members, a human-factors study that examines the correlation between cognitive ability and mood, and a study on how much a space suit inhibits dexterity in comparison to regular street clothes.

==Crews==

MDRS crews traditionally consist of six people who volunteer for one of the two-week shifts or crew rotations available during the northern hemisphere&#x27;s winter months. The field season ends in the northern spring due to the desert heat. Crews pay their own transportation expenses to and from the designated assembly place from where they are transported to and from MDRS. As volunteers, the crews are not paid for their participation in a crew rotation at the station. The crews usually consist of a mix of scientists, astronomers, physicists, biologists, geologists, engineers, and the occasional journalist. Each crew member is usually assigned a role, such as: commander, executive officer, health and safety officer, crew biologist, crew geologist or chief engineer.

Crew commanders are responsible for the entire crew and operations. Their responsibilities include maintaining a structured stream of information from the crew to mission support, establishing the agenda for each day (EVAs, maintenance, cooking, cleaning, etc.), and holding morning and evening meetings with all crew members. The executive officer&#x27;s duty is to act as the second in command during the mission, and to act as the commander in the event the commander is incapacitated or unavailable. The crew geologist and crew biologist work together to establish and accomplish the scientific goals of the mission, which include developing the geology and biology goals for the mission as well as planning field EVAs and subsequent laboratory work to achieve those goals. Both the crew geologist and crew biologist work with the remote science team (RST) during all stages of the mission. The Chief Engineer is responsible for maintaining all systems necessary for routine Habitat operations. These include the power, water, ATV and GreenHab systems.

, 175 crews have served rotations at MDRS over a period of sixteen years.

==The Research Station==

Both FMARS and MDRS originally have the same basic design: a two-level habitat module in diameter. The habitat&#x27;s lower level has a bathroom, laboratory, two airlocks, an extravehicular activity preparation area and stores various engineering equipment; at the top, the habitat&#x27;s upper level has six sleeping quarters for each crew, a common area, computing area and galley (kitcken). The loft level above the sleeping quarter is used for storage. Later on, there were drastic differences between the FMARS and MDRS, due to FMARS&#x27;s more isolated location and MDRS&#x27;s more continuous use, maintenance and expansion.

The MDRS is expanded from the two-level habitat (called Hab) to include a greenhouse (GreenHab), solar observatory (Musk Observatory), a science building (Science Dome), an engineering pod (RAM), and a robotic observatory. The Musk Observatory is named after Elon Musk, who donated $100,000 to the MDRS.

Except for the robotic observatory, the modules are connected via tunnels. At the habitat, the lower deck is used for science and engineering activities. Like the FMARS, it has a shower and toilet, a biology and geology laboratory, two simulated airlocks, an extravehicular activity preparation area, and storage space. The upper deck is used for social activities, dining and communications, and has seven separate crew quarters. In the loft area, a tank stores freshwater and a hatch is used for maintaining antenna and weather instruments. Water for flushing the toilet is provided by the greenhouse, and electricity is provided by batteries under the habitat.

===Habitat===
The analogue Mars Lander Habitat is a two-story cylinder that measures about in diameter, and is a crew&#x27;s combined home and place of work during a Mars surface exploration simulation. On the first floor, are two simulated airlocks, a shower and toilet, an EVA Preparation room for storage and maintenance of the simulated space suits and their associated equipment, and a combined science lab and engineering work area. The laboratory is shared between the crew geologist and the crew biologist and includes an autoclave, analytical balance, microscope, and a stock of chemicals and reagents for conducting biochemical tests. 

On the second floor are six very small private crew staterooms with bunks and a small reading desk, a common dining and entertainment area, a dedicated communications station and a galley or kitchen equipped with a gas stove, refrigerator, microwave, oven and a sink for meal preparations. Above the six crew staterooms is a Loft which contains the internal freshwater storage tank and equipment storage space. At the peak of the HAB&#x27;s dome-shaped roof is an access hatch to permit maintenance access to the satellite antenna and weather monitoring instruments.

Power is supplied by 12 rechargeable 24-volt batteries located under the Hab which can provide electrical power for up to twelve hours. In addition to the batteries are two electricity generators. Power from the generators is channeled through an inverter, which sends the power either to the battery banks to recharge them or via a panel with 19 circuit breakers, to the HAB electrical distribution system.

Water is supplied to the Hab via a potable water tank located away in the Engineering Support Equipment Area. The tank is a plastic storage container with a capacity (8 days worth of water at per person per day). Water must be manually carried or pumped via a hose from the potable water tank to the HAB&#x27;s internal tank, which holds about . The water is then gravity fed into a pressure pump that distributes the freshwater to the rest of the HAB, including a water heater. The water used to flush toilets is greywater. This is wastewater that has run down the sink and shower drains in the HAB and then through the greywater system out of the GreenHab. Water is rationed and monitored to minimize inefficiency and waste in the system.

The Hab is also equipped with an internet connection and several webcams so that the public can view the ongoing mission.

===GreenHab===
The GreenHab is a greenhouse used for growing crops and plant research. The original Gary Fisher GreenHab, retrofitted in 2009 from a closed loop water recycling center to a functional greenhouse, was destroyed by fire in December 2014, and replaced in September 2015 after an Indiegogo campaign raised $12,540 to rebuild it.

Originally the rebuilt GreenHab was planned as a geodesic dome, however, once the pad and frame were in place, it could not be made wind and winter-tight, so it was completed as the new Science Dome. The new Greenhab is a 12-foot by 24 foot transparent building that is climate and light controlled. Plants grown in the GreenHab are mostly herbs, greens, radishes, tomatoes, and other vegetables.

===Musk Mars Desert Observatory===

The Musk Mars Desert Observatory houses a Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, donated by Celestron. The telescope is capable of being operated remotely, and is accessible to amateur and professional astronomers via the internet. The observatory&#x27;s other sponsors include Le Sueur Manufacturing Inc., which provided the Astro-Pier on which the telescope is mounted; Software Bisque, which provided TheSky software; Vince Lanzetta of East Coast Observatories; Adirondack Video Astronomy; High Point Scientific; Technical Innovations; and the Lehigh Valley Amateur Astronomical Association.

The addition of the Musk Mars Desert Observatory provides research opportunities that were not available before, to the crew and local teachers and students. Students and teachers are invited to interact with the crew and to use the observatory as a learning tool.

Engineering tasks are completed in the repair and assembly module, a retrofitted Chinook helicopter fuel compartment designed for tool storage, and work spaces for engineering projects and repair of station instruments. It was moved to the campus in October 2017 and became fully operational in November 2018.

===Other===
North of the GreenHab is the underground septic tank and its outflow field. This area is a &quot;No Drive Foot Traffic Only Zone&quot; as there is no record of where exactly the septic tank is buried. East of the GreenHab is an Jovian radio telescope.

MDRS is the site of the annual University Rover Challenge, the first of which was held on June 2, 2007.

The flag of Mars appears on a couple of the buildings, as does the flag of the United States.

<text>The following is the list of political parties in Nepal registered in the Election Commission.

== National parties ==

A party registered with the Election Commission of Nepal is recognised as a national party only if it fulfils the two conditions listed below:
* The party needs to win at least one FPTP seat in Pratinidhi Sabha.
* The party gets at least 3% of the total valid proportional representation (PR) votes in Pratinidhi Sabha.

There are currently eight national parties in Nepal.

==Other parties currently represented in the Federal parliament==

A political party securing less than 3% of the PR votes will have to send its directly elected or FPTP candidates to the parliament as independent lawmakers. In other words, candidates from any political party failing to meet the criteria to become a national party will be ineligible to be represented in parliament as a party.

There are currently five such political parties which failed to achieve national status yet are represented in Nepal&#x27;s Parliament.

== Parties currently represented only in provincial assemblies ==

== Parties represented only in local government ==
== Other parties ==
== Defunct parties ==
This is a list of defunct political parties of Nepal that have had some representation in the legislature.

<text>Eastern Kentucky University (Eastern or EKU) is a public university in Richmond, Kentucky. It also maintains branch campuses in Corbin, Hazard, and Manchester and offers over 40 online undergraduate and graduate options.

==History==

=== Founding ===
On March 21, 1906, Governor J. C. W. Beckham signed legislation which established the Eastern Kentucky State Normal School No. 1. On May 7, 1906, the Normal School Commission selected the site of the former Central University campus as the location of this new college; EKU remains at this location today.

=== Renaming ===
In 1922, the Eastern Kentucky State Normal School No. 1 changed its name to Eastern Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers College, and the transformed college awarded its first degrees under that name in 1925. In 1930, the college changed its name again, becoming the Eastern Kentucky State Teachers College. In 1948, the General Assembly shortened it to Eastern Kentucky State College. In 1966, it was officially renamed Eastern Kentucky University.

=== Campus revitalization ===
The years between 2012 and 2020 were marked by a building campaign that altered the campus layout and improved aesthetics. Funding for the multimillion-dollar project relied heavily on public-private partnerships (P3) under the leadership of then-President Michael T. Benson. The construction efforts mark the most significant period of campus facility development since President Robert R. Martin&#x27;s tenure in the 1960s. Among the renovations and additions are:

*Powell Student Center (2019–20)
*New Rec Center (2019–20)
*Case Dining Hall (2018)
*New Gertrude Hood Stadium (Softball Field) (2017)
*Scholar House (2017)
*Turner Gate (2016)
*John Grant Crabbe Main Library&#x27;s Noel Reading Porch (2015)
*Lancaster Avenue Pedway (2015/2017)
*1971 Verdin Carillon bells (Keen Johnson Building) (2014)
*New Science Building (Phase I) (2012)
=== Presidents ===
Presidents of the institution have included:
==Academics==
=== Accreditation and academic charge ===
The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. In 2010, the university awarded its first doctoral degree through its Educational Leadership and Policy Studies program.

EKU serves its service region by offering adult degree completion options and online degree programs in addition to its traditional on-campus offerings.

===Rankings and outcomes===
Eastern Kentucky University has achieved national recognition, including mostly recently by the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; 2022 rankings:
* #52 (tie) in Regional Universities South (51st in 2021)
* #29 Best Graduate School – Occupational Therapy (29th in 2021)
* #170 (tie) Best Graduate School – Public Affairs (166th in 2021)
* #189 Best Graduate School – Speech-Language Pathology (189th in 2021)
* #74 (tie) Best Online Bachelor&#x27;s Programs (58th in 2021)
* #24 Best Colleges for Veterans (32nd in 2021)

EKU was also ranked by the 2019 &quot;Forbes&quot; Magazine America&#x27;s Top Colleges:

* #641 Top Colleges (637 in 2017 and 647 in 2018)
* #248 in Public Colleges (249 in 2017 and 250 in 2018)
* #160 in the South (172 in 2017 and 167 in 2018)
According to 2022 data from College Scorecard, Eastern Kentucky University graduates earn a median salary of $42,000 ten years after their entry into the institution. The median salaries of graduates vary across disciplines, with criminal justice majors earning around $33,000, biology $40,000, psychology $35,000, nursing $65,000, and Computer and Information Science $72,000. 61% of EKU graduates earn higher than a typical high school graduate of the corresponding area.

===Honors program===
In 1987, the faculty senate voted to approve an honors program to attract high-achieving students primarily from Kentucky with approval coming from the board of regents the following year. The first 34 students entered the program in 1988.

==Athletics==


The Eastern Kentucky (EKU) athletic teams are called the Colonels (formerly known as the &quot;Maroons&quot; until the mid-1960s). The university is a member of the NCAA Division I ranks, primarily competing in the ASUN Conference since the 2021–22 academic year; while its football team competes in the United Athletic Conference (UAC), with the conference having aspirations to go to the FBS level. The Colonels previously competed in the Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) from 1948–49 to 2020–21. EKU competes in 18 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, tennis, and track &amp; field; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, beach volleyball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

==Media==

<text>On 2D displays, such as computer monitors and TVs, display size or viewable image size (VIS) refers to the physical size of the area where pictures and videos are displayed. The size of a screen is usually described by the length of its diagonal, which is the distance between opposite corners, typically measured in inches. It is also sometimes called the physical image size to distinguish it from the &quot;logical image size,&quot; which describes a screen&#x27;s display resolution and is measured in pixels.

== History ==
The method of measuring screen size by its diagonal was inherited from the first generation of CRT televisions, which had picture tubes with circular faces. Being circular, the external diameter of the bulb was used to describe their size. Since these circular tubes displayed rectangular images, the diagonal measurement of the visible rectangle was smaller than the diameter of the tube due to the thickness of the glass surrounding the phosphor screen, which was hidden from the viewer by the casing and bezel. This method continued even when cathode ray tubes were manufactured as rounded rectangles. It had the advantage of being a single number specifying the size and was not confusing when the aspect ratio was universally 4:3. In the US, when virtually all TV tubes were 4:3, the size of the screen was given as the true screen diagonal with a ‘V’ following it (this was a requirement in the US market but not elsewhere). In virtually all other markets, the size of the outer diameter of the tube was given. What was a 27V in the US could be a 28&quot; elsewhere. However, the V terminology was frequently dropped in US advertising referring to a 27V as a 27&quot;. This was not misleading for the consumer as the seller had to give the actual screen size by law. Flat panel displays by contrast use the actual diagonal of their visible display size, thus the size is the actual size presented to the viewer in all markets. This means that a similarly specified size of display will be larger as a flat panel display compared with a cathode ray tube display.

When the common aspect ratio shifted from 4:3 to 16:9, the new widescreens were labeled with a W in the US. A screen that is approximately the same height as a 27V would be a 32W. Vizio and other US TV manufacturers have introduced even wider screens with a 21:9 aspect ratio to match aspect ratios used in cinemas. To gauge the relative sizes of these new screens, the screen aspect must be considered. In a commercial market where multiple aspect ratios are being sold, it will always take two numbers to describe the screen size, some combination of diagonal, aspect ratio, height or width.

Set sizes are frequently given as a ‘class’ as screens from different manufacturers will have slight differences in size. However, the &quot;class&quot; should be within 1/2&quot; of the actual size. The reasons for the different sizes within a class stem from differences in the manufacturers&#x27; equipment. As manufacturers move from one size to another, newer larger sizes must fit on the same size glass, though with fewer displays being cut from it. Some sizes fit well and maximize glass utilization, while other sizes fit more poorly and waste glass. For example, in some cases, increasing the screen size by even 0.1” can cause an LCD manufacturer to go from 12 screens fitting on their glass sheet to 9.

== Optimal screen size and viewing distance ==
The resolution of the human eye (with 20/20 vision) is about one minute of arc. For full HDTV resolution, this one minute of arc implies that the TV watcher should sit 3.2 times the height of the screen away (optimal viewing distance). At this distance, the individual pixels cannot be resolved while simultaneously maximizing the viewing area. For more TV resolutions, see &quot;The optimal viewing distance&quot;.

The TV image is composed of many lines of pixels. Ideally, the TV watcher sits far enough away from the screen that the individual lines merge into one solid image. The watcher may sit even farther away and still see a good picture, but it will occupy a smaller portion of their visual field.

== Display sizes of common handheld devices, computer monitors and TVs ==

Common screen dimensions are listed in the table below (the most common diagonal dimensions in inches as of 2020 are bolded). If the display is not listed, then the following equations can be used. Note that D is the diagonal (in centimeters or inches), W is the width (in pixels), and H is the height (in pixels).

<doc id="433280" wikidata="Q580171" url="?curid=433280" title="Paleolibertarianism">
<text>Paleolibertarianism (also known as the &quot;Paleo strategy&quot;) is a right-libertarian political activism strategy aimed at uniting libertarians and paleoconservatives. It was developed by American anarcho-capitalist theorists Murray Rothbard and Lew Rockwell in the American political context after the end of the Cold War. From 1989 to 1995, they sought to communicate libertarian notions of opposition to government intervention by using messages accessible to the working class and middle class people of the time. They combined libertarian free market views with the cultural conservatism of paleoconservatism, while also opposing protectionism. The strategy also embraced the paleoconservative reverence for tradition and religion. This approach, usually identified as right-wing populism, was intended to radicalize citizens against the state. The name they chose for this style of activism evoked the roots of modern libertarianism, hence the prefix &quot;paleo&quot;. That founding movement was American classical liberalism, which shared the anti-war and anti-New Deal sentiments of the Old Right in the first half of the 20th century. Paleolibertarianism is generally seen as a right-wing ideology.

The paleolibertarian strategy was expected to shift the libertarian movement away from the influence of public policy-oriented libertarian organizations based in Washington, D.C. (who were accused of giving up on communicating the complete libertarian message and of adopting the political and cultural values inside the Beltway to gain acceptance among the political elite); and to simultaneously shift American right-wing politics away from the neoconservative movement and its promotion of hawkish or interventionist foreign policy usually characterized as imperialist by libertarian thinkers.

== Tenets ==
According to Rockwell, the paleolibertarian movement hearkens back to such thinkers as &quot;Ludwig von Mises, Albert Jay Nock, Garet Garrett, and the entire interwar Old Right that opposed the New Deal and favored the Old Republic&quot; and distinguished themselves from neo-libertarians, Beltway libertarianism (a pejorative term used by hardline libertarians to describe libertarians who have gained traction in the Beltway, i.e., Washington, D.C., who are accused of surrendering libertarian values to the Beltway values in order to have better public relations with the Beltway elite), left-libertarianism and lifestyle libertarianism. According to Rockwell, paleolibertarianism &quot;made its peace with religion as the bedrock of liberty, property, and the natural order&quot;.

Paleolibertarianism developed in opposition to the link between social avant-garde and libertarianism as if they were indivisible issues. In his 1990 essay &quot;The Case for Paleo-Libertarianism&quot;, Rockwell charged mainstream libertarians with &quot;hatred of Western culture&quot;. He argued that &quot;pornographic photography, &#x27;free&#x27;-thinking, chaotic painting, atonal music, deconstructionist literature, Bauhaus architecture, and modernist films have nothing in common with the libertarian political agenda—no matter how much individual libertarians may revel in them&quot;. Of paleolibertarians, he wrote that &quot;we obey, and we ought to obey, traditions of manners and taste&quot;. After explaining why libertarians friendly with conventional culture could make a better argument for liberty to the middle classes, Rockwell predicted &quot;in the new movement, libertarians who personify the present corruption will sink to their natural level, as will the Libertarian Party, which has been their diabolic pulpit&quot;.

In short, according to Lew Rockwell, the motivation of this &quot;paleo&quot; libertarian movement—in contrast with the &quot;modal&quot; libertarian movement of the Beltway and the Libertarian Party as it existed in the early &#x27;90s—was the application of the libertarian principles in ways that lead to the radicalization of the middle classes against the state.

== History ==
In the 1992 essay &quot;Right-Wing Populism: A Strategy for the Paleo Movement&quot;, Rothbard reflected on the ability of libertarians to gain the disaffected working and middle classes using right-wing populism methods to deliver libertarian ideas.

In the 1990s, a &quot;paleoconservative-paleolibertarian alliance was forged&quot;, centred on the John Randolph Club founded in 1989 by traditionalist Catholic Thomas Fleming and Rothbard. Rockwell and Rothbard supported paleoconservative Republican candidate Pat Buchanan in the 1992 presidential election and described Buchanan as the political leader of the &quot;paleo movement&quot;. In 1992, Rothbard declared that &quot;with Pat Buchanan as our leader, we shall break the clock of social democracy&quot;. The Rockwell and Rothbard intention with this alliance was to rebirth an anti-war and anti-welfare right-wing and to fight the neoconservative leadership of the Republican Party in the context of the end of Cold War.

Three years later, Rothbard said Buchanan developed too much faith in economic planning and centralized state power which eventually led paleolibertarians to withdraw their support for Buchanan. In addition to Buchanan&#x27;s economic nationalism, Paul Gottfried later complained of a lack of funding, infighting, media hostility or blackout and vilification as &quot;racists&quot; and &quot;anti-Semites&quot;. The paleolibertarian strategy did not produce practical results and generated little external sympathy. John Randolph Club was disintegrated in 1995 due to incompatibility of ideas and personalities between libertarian and conservative factions.

Rothbard died in 1995. Rockwell asserted in 1999 that with Rothbard&#x27;s death the paleolibertarian organizing had ended. In 2007, Rockwell stated that he no longer used the term &quot;paleolibertarian&quot;—because it was distorted by its past association with the term paleoconservative as &quot;some kind of socially conservative libertarian&quot;, something that &quot;was not the point at all&quot; of paleolibertarianism—and that all libertarians should be &quot;happy with the term libertarian.&quot;

== Influence ==
During the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries and the campaign for the 2016 United States presidential election, several figures active in 1990s paleolibertarianism expressed levels of sympathy for the messages of then-candidate Donald Trump. Lew Rockwell was sympathetic to Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign because of his message against the Republican Party and Democratic Party establishments, as was Rothbardian Justin Raimondo, who voted for Trump on the basis of foreign policy. In a 2016 pre-election debate with &quot;Reason&quot; editor Nick Gillespie, Austrian School anarcho-capitalist economist Walter Block advised libertarians living in battleground states to support Trump rather than cast their votes for Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson, citing the Trump campaign&#x27;s foreign policy.

In line with these views, libertarian columnist Ilana Mercer authored a book in June 2016 about presidential candidate Trump titled &quot;The Trump Revolution: The Donald&#x27;s Creative Destruction Deconstructed&quot;, a critical examination of then-candidate Trump from a libertarian perspective. In discussing Mercer&#x27;s book, Objectivist-libertarian scholar Chris Matthew Sciabarra observed that Mercer endorsed &quot;not necessarily the policies of Trump, but &#x27;The Process of Trump&#x27;&quot;. Scabbarra further noted that &quot;[t]he most interesting of her arguments is the bolstering of liberty by Donald J. Trump [...] smashing an enmeshed political spoils system to bits: the media complex, the political and party complex, the conservative poseur complex. In the age of unconstitutional government—Democratic and Republican—this process of creative destruction can only increase the freedom quotient&quot;.

Following the 2022 Libertarian National Convention, the Mises Caucus, a paleolibertarian faction, became the dominant faction on the Libertarian National Committee.

<doc id="433282" wikidata="Q2076217" url="?curid=433282" title="Catalan personal pronouns">
<text>This article discusses the forms and functions of the [[personal pronoun]]s in Catalan and Valencian.

==Strong pronouns==
The &quot;strong&quot; pronouns () in Catalan have the following forms:


These forms are used as subject pronouns (with the exception of &quot;si&quot;), and also as disjunctive pronouns, for example, after a preposition.
*&quot;Jo encara no en sé gaire.&quot; (&quot;I still don&#x27;t know much about it.&quot;)
*&quot;Ell, no crec que vingui.&quot; (&quot;Him, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s coming.&quot;)
*&quot;Han preguntat per vosaltres.&quot; (&quot;They asked about you.&quot;)

The first person singular pronoun has a special form &quot;mi&quot; after most prepositions.
*&quot;Queda&#x27;t amb mi.&quot; (&quot;Stay with me.&quot;)
However, the form &quot;jo&quot; is used with some prepositions, for example, in &quot;segons jo&quot; (&quot;according to me&quot;), and in coordinated structures with another noun or pronoun: &quot;contra tu i jo&quot; (&quot;against you and me&quot;).

The third person reflexive pronoun &quot;si&quot; (both singular and plural) cannot be used as a subject. 
It most commonly appears after a preposition, often reinforced by &quot;mateix&quot;:
*&quot;Ho va comprar per a si mateix.&quot; (&quot;He bought it for himself.&quot;)
*&quot;Ho va comprar per a si mateixa.&quot; (&quot;She bought it for herself.&quot;)
*&quot;Ho van comprar per a si mateixos.&quot; (&quot;They bought it for themselves (masculine).&quot;)
*&quot;Ho van comprar per a si mateixes.&quot; (&quot;They bought it for themselves (feminine).&quot;)

The 2nd person polite pronouns are &quot;vostè&quot; (singular) and &quot;vostès&quot; (plural). They combine with 3rd person verbs.
*&quot;Vostè em faria un favor?&quot; (&quot;Would you do me a favor?&quot;)
The older form &quot;vós&quot; (with 2nd person plural verb agreement) can be found in some varieties of Catalan, and in contexts like administrative texts.

The 1st person majestic plural is expressed with the pronoun &quot;Nós&quot; (in place of &quot;nosaltres&quot;).

There exists as well an impersonal subject pronoun &quot;hom&quot; (unmarked for either gender or number), always used with 3rd person singular verbs, nowadays archaic and only used in writing:
*&quot;Hom no es fa monja perquè sí&quot; (&quot;One does not become a nun because of nothing.&quot;)

==Weak pronouns==

The weak pronouns () are proforms that, as the name indicates, do not carry stress. All are monosyllabic clitics, and all must always appear immediately before or after a verb: they cannot be used on their own or attached to a different element of the sentence. The combination of the verb plus the weak pronoun or pronouns always has a single stressed vowel, that of the verb.

===Forms===
Weak pronouns in Catalan vary according to:
#the person, number, and gender of the antecedent
#its syntactic function (direct or indirect object or adverbial complement).

The form of a given pronoun is determined by its position with respect to the verb, and whether it is adjacent to a vowel or a consonant in the verb. There are four possible configurations:
*reinforced form (&quot;forma reforçada&quot;): used before a verb that begins with a consonant, separated from the verb by a space
:&quot;Em veieu.&quot; (&quot;You see me.&quot;)
*elided form (&quot;forma elidida&quot;): used before a verb that begins with a vowel (or &quot;h-&quot;), and separated from it by an apostrophe
:&quot;Això m&#x27;agrada&quot; (&quot;I like that.&quot;; lit. &quot;That pleases me&quot;)
*full form (&quot;forma plena&quot;): used after a verb that ends in a consonant (or a diphthong ending in &quot;-u&quot;), connected to the verb with a hyphen
:&quot;En Joan no vol seguir-me.&quot; (&quot;John doesn&#x27;t want to follow me.&quot;)
*reduced form (&quot;forma reduïda&quot;): used after a verb that ends in a vowel, separated from it by an apostrophe (except in the case of &quot;-us&quot;)
:&quot;Dóna&#x27;m un llibre.&quot; (&quot;Give me a book.&quot;)

Not all pronouns have four distinct forms. The following table shows the complete inventory.


===Uses===
The weak pronouns primarily express complements of the verb.

*Direct objects
: &quot;Ahir el vaig veure.&quot; (&quot;Yesterday I saw him.&quot;)
: &quot;Ahir la vaig veure.&quot; (&quot;Yesterday I saw her.&quot;)

*Indirect objects
: &quot;Li donaràs el llibre?&quot; (&quot;Will you give him/her the book?&quot;)

*Reflexive pronouns
:Reflexive – &quot;La nena es renta.&quot; (&quot;The girl is washing herself.&quot;)
:Pronominal – &quot;Tots es van penedir d&#x27;això.&quot; (&quot;Everyone was sorry about that.&quot;)

*The neuter proform ho replaces pronouns such as &quot;açò&quot; (&quot;this&quot;), &quot;això&quot;, &quot;allò&quot; (&quot;that&quot;), or &quot;tot&quot; (&quot;everything&quot;), or even an entire clause. 
: &quot;No ho sé.&quot; (&quot;I don&#x27;t know [the thing you just asked about].&quot;)
: -&quot;T&#x27;agrada mirar la televisió?&quot; -&quot;No, ho trobo avorrit.&quot; (&quot;Do you like to watch TV?&quot; &quot;No, I think it&#x27;s boring.&quot;)
: &quot;Cal netejar-ho tot.&quot; (&quot;We have to clean it all up.&quot;)

*The proform hi replaces adverbial complements such as:
:Locative expressions: &quot;Sempre he tingut ganes d&#x27;anar-hi.&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ve always wanted to go [there].&quot;)

===Position===

The weak pronouns are either proclitic (appearing immediately before the verb) or enclitic (immediately after).

Enclitic pronouns are used with infinitives, gerunds, and positive imperatives.
*&quot;Pots fer-nos mandonguilles?&quot; (&quot;Can you make us meatballs?&quot;)
*&quot;Veient-ho des de fora, analitzant-ho objectivament&quot; (&quot;Seeing it from an outsider&#x27;s point of view, analyzing it objectively&quot;)
*&quot;Vés-hi i espera&#x27;m.&quot; (&quot;Go there and wait for me.&quot;)

With all other forms of the verb, the weak pronouns are proclitic. This includes, in particular, conjugated (finite) verbs and negative imperatives:
*&quot;Ens faràs encara mandonguilles?&quot; (&quot;Will you make us meatballs again?&quot;)
*&quot;No m&#x27;esperis.&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t wait for me.&quot;)

In complex verbal constructions consisting of a conjugated verb and an infinitive or gerund, the pronoun can appear either before the first verb or after the second verb.
* &quot;Els volien atacar.&quot; or &quot;Volien atacar-los.&quot; (&quot;They wanted to attack them.&quot;)
* &quot;L&#x27;estem escoltant.&quot; or &quot;Estem escoltant-lo.&quot; (&quot;We are listening to him.&quot;)

=== Dialectal variation ===
Use of weak pronouns varies significantly across the Catalan linguistic area.

Northern Catalan (particularly as spoken in Northern Catalonia) and the Balearic dialect do not generally use the reinforced forms (e.g. &quot;te veig&quot; instead of &quot;et veig&quot;).

In the imperative mood in Northern Catalan, the reduced form of the pronoun is replaced by a &quot;tonic&quot; form (thus, not strictly being a &quot;weak&quot; pronoun anymore). For example, &quot;mira&#x27;m!&quot; (en: &quot;look at me!&quot;) in Northern Catalan is rendered as &quot;mira-mé!&quot;.

==Combinations of weak pronouns==
When two weak pronouns appear with the same verb, they must appear in a fixed order, as illustrated in the following table:

The two pronouns must be selected from different columns, and furthermore &quot;ho&quot; cannot combine with &quot;en&quot; or &quot;hi&quot;.

All of the combinations allowed in the standard language are given in the following table, which also shows the necessary morpho-phonological and orthographic adjustments. In each cell of the table, the forms are listed in the following order, with the same contextual conditions as explained above for the simple pronouns: 
#proclitic form used before a verb that begins with a vowel
#proclitic form used before a verb that begins with a consonant
#enclitic form used &quot;after a verb that ends with a vowel (except &quot;u&quot;)&quot;
#enclitic form used after a verb that ends with a consonant (or &quot;u&quot;)

In combinations like &quot;es&quot; + &quot;en&quot;, the resulting form, pronounced , could be analyzed either as &quot;s&#x27;&quot; + &quot;en&quot; or as &quot;se&quot; + &quot;&#x27;n&quot;. The orthographic convention in such cases is to place the apostrophe as far to the right as possible: &quot;se&#x27;n&quot;, and not &quot;s&#x27;en&quot;, and similarly for &quot;se&#x27;ls&quot;, &quot;me&#x27;n&quot;, &quot;te&#x27;m&quot;, &quot;te&#x27;ns&quot;, etc. The combination of &quot;el&quot;/&quot;la&quot; with &quot;en&quot;, however, is written &quot;l&#x27;en&quot;, because there is no such pronoun as &quot;le&quot; that would justify the spelling &quot;le&#x27;n&quot;.

===Impossible combinations===
As mentioned above, the combinations &quot;ho&quot; + &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;ho&quot; + &quot;en&quot; are not allowed in the standard language, and must be avoided, for example by keeping only &quot;ho&quot; and leaving the other pronoun unexpressed. In some contexts, it is also acceptable to replace &quot;ho&quot; with &quot;el&quot;, giving rise to the following combinations:
*&quot;ho&quot; + &quot;hi&quot; → el + &quot;hi&quot; → l&#x27;hi
:&quot;(Això, a Sabadell) l&#x27;hi portaré demà.&quot; (&quot;I will take it there tomorrow&quot;)
*&quot;ho&quot; + &quot;en&quot; → el + &quot;en&quot; → l&#x27;en
In the second case, it is also possible to replace the pronoun &quot;en&quot; with &quot;hi&quot;: 
*&quot;ho&quot; + &quot;en&quot; → el + hi → l&#x27;hi
:&quot;(Això, de l&#x27;armari) l&#x27;en/l&#x27;hi trauré després.&quot; (&quot;I will take it out of there afterwards&quot;)

This substitution of &quot;hi&quot; for &quot;en&quot; is also used to express the combination of &quot;en&quot; (ablative) + &quot;en&quot; (genitive), since the form *&quot;ne&#x27;n&quot; is not allowed:
*&quot;en&quot; + &quot;en&quot; → &quot;en&quot; + hi → n&#x27;hi
:&quot;(D&#x27;homes, del teatre) n&#x27;hi sortiran tres.&quot; (&quot;Three of them will come out of there&quot;)

===Longer combinations===
Sequences of three pronouns are possible, and generally consist of one of the two-pronoun combinations from the table above, preceded by &quot;em&quot;, &quot;et&quot;, &quot;ens&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, and most commonly &quot;es&quot; (the added pronoun must not already appear in the original two-pronoun cluster).
*&quot;Us posen vi als gots&quot; (They put wine in the glasses for you) → &quot;Us n&#x27;hi posen&quot; (They put some there for you)
*&quot;Se t&#x27;ofereix cervesa&quot; (You are offered beer) → &quot;Se te n&#x27;ofereix&quot; (You are offered some)

Combinations of four pronouns are very rare:
*&quot;Se&#x27;m posa pols a les sabates&quot; (Dust gets into my shoes) → &quot;Se me n&#x27;hi posa&quot; (Some of it [the sand] gets into them [the shoes])

The linguist Joan Solà presents a progression that culminates in a combination of six weak pronouns:
*&quot;Aquell amic nostre (→ te me) és capaç de posar-se a casa (→ hi) tres parents (→ ’n) del senyor Pere (→ li)&quot; (That friend of ours is able to give lodging in his house to three relatives of Senyor Pere) → Se te me li n’hi posarà tres

===Variants===
Combinations of weak pronouns are subject to wide regional and stylistic variation, and in several cases the normative rules presented above do not reflect actual usage.

For example, alongside the transparently derived forms of &quot;li&quot; + direct object pronoun (&quot;el&quot;, &quot;la&quot;, &quot;els&quot;, &quot;les&quot;) given in the table above, central Catalan varieties replace &quot;li&quot; with &quot;hi&quot;:
*&quot;li&quot; + &quot;el&quot; → &quot;el&quot; + hi → l&#x27;hi (instead of &quot;li&#x27;l&quot;)
*&quot;li&quot; + &quot;la&quot; → &quot;la&quot; + hi → la hi (instead of &quot;li la&quot;)
*&quot;li&quot; + &quot;els&quot; → &quot;els&quot; + hi → els hi (instead of &quot;li&#x27;ls&quot;)
*&quot;li&quot; + &quot;les&quot; → &quot;les&quot; + hi → les hi (instead of &quot;li les&quot;)
Furthermore, the feminine forms can merge phonetically with the masculine forms, i.e. &quot;la hi&quot; is pronounced like &quot;l&#x27;hi&quot; and &quot;les hi&quot; like &quot;els hi&quot;.

Combinations of &quot;li&quot; with &quot;en&quot; and &quot;ho&quot; can also undergo modification:
*&quot;li&quot; + &quot;en&quot; → &quot;en&quot; + hi → n&#x27;hi (instead of &quot;li&#x27;n&quot;)
*&quot;li&quot; + &quot;ho&quot; → el + hi → l&#x27;hi (instead of &quot;li ho&quot;)

In more colloquial registers, the plural indirect object pronoun &quot;els&quot; is realized as &quot;els hi&quot;, and this extended form is used instead of all combinations of &quot;els&quot; followed by a 3rd person direct object pronoun:
*&quot;els&quot; + &quot;el&quot;/&quot;la&quot;/&quot;els&quot;/&quot;les&quot;/&quot;ho&quot; → els hi

The elided proclitic forms &quot;ens n&#x27;&quot; and &quot;us n&#x27;&quot; are regularly replaced by the unelided forms &quot;ens en&quot; and &quot;us en&quot; before a verb starting with a vowel. For example:
*&quot;Ens en anem&quot;, instead of &quot;Ens n&#x27;anem&quot;
*&quot;Us en alegreu&quot;, instead of &quot;Us n&#x27;alegreu&quot;

<text>Frances Perkins (born Fannie Coralie Perkins; April 10, 1880 – May 14, 1965) was an American workers-rights advocate who served as the fourth United States Secretary of Labor from 1933 to 1945, the longest serving in that position. A member of the Democratic Party, Perkins was the first woman ever to serve in a presidential cabinet. As a loyal supporter of her longtime friend, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, she helped make labor issues important in the emerging New Deal coalition. She was one of two Roosevelt cabinet members to remain in office for his entire presidency (the other being Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes).

Perkins&#x27; most important role came in developing a policy for social security in 1935. She also helped form government policy for working with labor unions, although some union leaders distrusted her. Perkins&#x27; Labor Department helped to mediate strikes by way of the United States Conciliation Service. She dealt with numerous labor issues during World War II, when skilled labor was vital to the economy and women were moving into jobs formerly held by men.

==Early life==
Fannie Coralie Perkins was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Susan Ella Perkins (née Bean; 1849–1927) and Frederick William Perkins (1844–1916), the owner of a stationer&#x27;s business (both of her parents originally were from Maine). Fannie Perkins had one sister, Ethel Perkins Harrington (1884–1965). The family could trace their roots to colonial America, and the women had a tradition of work in education. She spent much of her childhood in Worcester, Massachusetts. Frederick loved Greek literature and passed that love on to Fannie.

Perkins attended the Classical High School in Worcester. She earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry and physics from Mount Holyoke College in 1902. While attending Mount Holyoke, Perkins discovered progressive politics and the suffrage movement. She was named class president. One of her professors was Annah May Soule, who assigned students to tour a factory to study working conditions; Perkins recalled Soule&#x27;s course as an important influence.

==Early career and continuing education==
After college, Perkins held a variety of teaching positions, including one from 1904 to 1906 where she taught chemistry at Ferry Hall School (now Lake Forest Academy), an all-girls school in Lake Forest, Illinois. In Chicago, she volunteered at settlement houses, including Hull House, where she worked with Jane Addams. She changed her name from Fannie to Frances when she joined the Episcopal church in 1905. In 1907, she moved to Philadelphia and enrolled at University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Wharton School to learn economics, and spent two years in the city working as a social worker. Shortly after, she moved to Greenwich Village, New York, where she attended Columbia University and became active in the suffrage movement. In support of the movement, Perkins attended protests and meetings, and advocated for the cause on street corners. She earned a master&#x27;s degree in economics and sociology from Columbia in 1910.

In 1910 Perkins achieved statewide prominence as head of the New York office of the National Consumers League and lobbied with vigor for better working hours and conditions. She also taught as a professor of sociology at Adelphi College. The next year, she witnessed the tragic Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, a pivotal event in her life. The factory employed hundreds of workers, mostly young women, but lacked fire escapes. In addition, the owner kept all the doors and stairwells locked in order to prevent employees from taking breaks. When the building caught fire, many workers tried unsuccessfully to escape through the windows. Just a year before, these same women and girls had fought for the 54-hour work week and other benefits that Perkins had championed. One hundred and forty-six workers died. Perkins blamed lax legislation for the loss.

As a consequence of this fire, Perkins left her position at the New York office of the National Consumers League and, on the recommendation of Theodore Roosevelt, became the executive secretary for the Committee on Safety of the City of New York, formed to improve fire safety. As part of the Committee on Safety, Perkins investigated another significant fire at the Freeman plant in Binghamton, New York, in which 63 people died. In 1912, she was instrumental in getting the New York legislature to pass a &quot;54-hour&quot; bill that capped the number of hours women and children could work. Perkins pressed for votes for the legislation, encouraging proponents including Franklin D. Roosevelt to filibuster, while Perkins called state senators to make sure they could be present for the final vote.

== Marriage and personal life ==
In 1913, Perkins married New York economist Paul Caldwell Wilson. She kept her maiden name because she did not want her activities in Albany and New York City to affect the career of her husband, then the secretary to the New York City mayor. She defended her right to keep her maiden name in court. The couple had a daughter, Susanna, born in December 1916. Less than two years later, Wilson began to show signs of mental illness. He would be institutionalized frequently for mental illness throughout the remainder of their marriage. Perkins had cut back slightly on her public life following the birth of her daughter, but returned after her husband&#x27;s illness to provide for her family. According to biographer Kirstin Downey, Susanna displayed &quot;manic-depressive symptoms&quot;, as well. Perkins shared the Georgetown, D.C. home of an old friend, Mary Harriman Rumsey, who had founded the Junior League in 1901, for less than a year, until Rumsey&#x27;s death in 1934. Rumsey and Perkins&#x27; arrangement was for practical reasons, as a December 1933 &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist had criticized Perkins for not meeting social obligations, due to her apartment accommodations. Later Perkins shared a home with Caroline O’Day, a Democratic congresswoman from New York.

== Return to work in New York ==
Prior to moving to Washington, D.C., Perkins held various positions in the New York state government. She had gained respect from the political leaders in the state. In 1919, she was added to the Industrial Commission of the State of New York by Governor Al Smith. Her nomination was met with protests from both manufacturers and labor, neither of whom felt Perkins represented their interests. Smith stood by Perkins as someone who could be a voice for women and girls in the workforce and for her work on the Wagner Factory Investigating Committee. Although claiming the delay in Perkins&#x27;s confirmation was not due to her gender, some state senators pointed to Perkins&#x27;s not taking her husband&#x27;s name as a sign that she was a radical. Perkins was confirmed on February 18, 1919, becoming one of the first female commissioners in New York, and began working out of New York City. The state senate-confirmed position made Perkins one of three commissioners overseeing the industrial code, and the supervisor of both the bureau of information and statistics and the bureau of mediation and arbitration. The position also came with an $8,000 salary (), making Perkins the highest-paid woman in New York state government. Six months into her job, her fellow Commissioner James M. Lynch called Perkins&#x27;s contributions &quot;invaluable,&quot; and added &quot;[f]rom the work which Miss Perkins has accomplished I am convinced that more women ought to be placed in high positions throughout the state departments.&quot;

In 1929, the newly elected New York governor, Franklin Roosevelt, appointed Perkins as the inaugural New York state industrial commissioner. As commissioner, Perkins supervised an agency with 1,800 employees.

Having earned the co-operation and the respect of various political factions, Perkins helped put New York in the forefront of progressive reform. She expanded factory investigations, reduced the workweek for women to 48 hours, and championed minimum wage and unemployment insurance laws. She worked vigorously to put an end to child labor and to provide safety for women workers.

==Secretary of Labor==

In 1933, Roosevelt summoned Perkins to ask her to join his cabinet. Perkins presented Roosevelt with a long list of labor programs for which she would fight, from Social Security to minimum wage. &quot;Nothing like this has ever been done in the United States before,&quot; she told Roosevelt. &quot;You know that, don’t you?&quot; Agreeing to back her, Roosevelt nominated Perkins as Secretary of Labor. The nomination was met with support from the National League of Women Voters and the Women&#x27;s Party. The American Federation of Labor criticized the selection of Perkins because of a perceived lack of ties to labor.

As secretary, Perkins oversaw the Department of Labor. Perkins went on to hold the position for 12 years, longer than any other Secretary of Labor and the fourth longest of any cabinet secretary. She also became the first woman to hold a cabinet position in the United States, thus she became the first woman to enter the presidential line of succession. The selection of a woman to the cabinet had been rumored in the four previous administrations, with Roosevelt being the first to follow through. Roosevelt had witnessed Perkins&#x27;s work firsthand during their time in Albany. With few exceptions, President Roosevelt consistently supported the goals and programs of Secretary Perkins.

Perkins played a role in the New Deal by helping to write legislation. As chair of the President&#x27;s Committee on Economic Security, she was involved in all aspects of its advisory reports, including the Civilian Conservation Corps and the She-She-She Camps. Her most important contribution was to help design the Social Security Act of 1935.

Perkins created the Immigration and Naturalization Service. She sought to implement liberal immigration policies but some of her efforts experienced pushback, especially in Congress.

Perkins went to Geneva between June 11 and 18, 1938. On June 13, she gave a speech at the International Labour Organization in which she called on the organization to make its contribution to the world economic recovery, while avoiding being dragged into political problems. She also defended the participation of the United States in the ILO, which it had joined in 1934.

In 1939, she came under fire from some members of Congress for refusing to deport the communist head of the West Coast International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Harry Bridges. Ultimately, Bridges was vindicated by the Supreme Court.

After the death of President Roosevelt in April 1945, Harry Truman replaced the Roosevelt cabinet, naming Lewis B. Schwellenbach as Secretary of Labor. Perkins&#x27;s tenure as secretary ended on June 30, 1945, with the swearing in of Schwellenbach.

==Later life==
Following her tenure as Secretary of Labor, in 1945, Perkins was asked by President Truman to serve on the United States Civil Service Commission, which she accepted. In her post as commissioner, Perkins spoke out against government officials requiring secretaries and stenographers to be physically attractive, blaming the practice for the shortage of secretaries and stenographers in the government. Perkins left the Civil Service Commission in 1952 when her husband died. During this period, she also published a memoir of her time in the Roosevelt administration entitled, &quot;The Roosevelt I Knew&quot; (1946, ), which covered her personal history with Franklin Roosevelt, starting from their meeting in 1910.

Following her government service career, Perkins remained active and returned to educational positions at colleges and universities. She was a teacher and lecturer at the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University until her death in 1965, at age 85. She also gave guest lectures at other universities, including two 15-lecture series at the University of Illinois Institute of Labor and Industrial relations in 1955 and 1958.

At Cornell, she lived at the Telluride House where she was one of the first women to become a member of that renowned intellectual community. Kirstin Downey, author of &quot;The Woman Behind the New Deal: The Life of Frances Perkins, FDR&#x27;s Secretary of Labor and His Moral Conscience&quot;, dubbed her time at the Telluride House &quot;probably the happiest phase of her life&quot;.

Perkins is buried in the Glidden Cemetery in Newcastle, Maine. She was also known locally as &quot;Mrs. Paul Wilson&quot; and is buried by that name.

==Legacy==

Perkins is famous for being the first woman cabinet member, as well as from her policy accomplishments. She was heavily involved with many issues associated with the social safety net including, the creation of Social Security, unemployment insurance in the United States, the federal minimum wage, and federal laws regulating child labor.

In 1967, the Telluride House and Cornell University&#x27;s School of Industrial and Labor Relations established the Frances Perkins Memorial Fellowship. In 1982, Perkins was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In 2015, Perkins was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the 2015 LGBT History Month. In 2019, she was announced as among the members of the inaugural class of the Government Hall of Fame. Also that year, Elizabeth Warren used a podium built with wood salvaged from the Perkins Homestead.

===Character in historical context===
As the first woman to become a member of the presidential cabinet, Perkins had an unenviable challenge: she had to be as capable, as fearless, as tactful, and as politically astute as the other Washington politicians, in order to make it possible for other women to be accepted into the halls of power after her.

Perkins had a cool personality that held her aloof from the crowd. On one occasion, however, she engaged in some heated name-calling with Alfred P. Sloan, the chairman of the board at General Motors. During a punishing United Auto Workers strike, she phoned Sloan in the middle of the night and called him a scoundrel and a skunk for not meeting the union&#x27;s demands. She said, &quot;You don&#x27;t deserve to be counted among decent men. You&#x27;ll go to hell when you die.&quot; Sloan&#x27;s late-night response was one of irate indignation.

Her achievements indicate her great love of workers and lower-class groups, but her conservative upbringing held her back from mingling freely and exhibiting personal affection. She was well-suited for the high-level efforts to effect sweeping reforms, but never caught the public&#x27;s eye or its affection.

===Memorials and monuments===
President Jimmy Carter renamed the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., the Frances Perkins Building in 1980. Perkins was honored with a postage stamp that same year. Her home in Washington, D.C. from 1937 to 1940, and her Maine family home are both designated National Historic Landmarks.

The Frances Perkins Center is a nonprofit organization located at the Frances Perkins Homestead in Newcastle, Maine, which was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 2014. In December 2024, the site was named a National Monument by President Joe Biden.

On April 10, 2003, a historical marker honoring Perkins was dedicated in Homestead, Pennsylvania, at the southwest corner of 9th and Amity.

On October 30, 2024, a plaque honoring Perkins was unveiled at 121 Washington Place in Greenwich Village, where Perkins once lived.

Perkins remains a prominent alumna of Mount Holyoke College, whose Frances Perkins Program allows &quot;women of non-traditional age&quot; (i.e., age 24 or older) to complete a bachelor of arts degree. There are approximately 140 Frances Perkins scholars each year.

====Maine Department of Labor mural====
A mural depicting Perkins was displayed in the Maine Department of Labor headquarters, the native state of her parents. On March 23, 2011, Maine&#x27;s Republican governor, Paul LePage, ordered the mural removed. A spokesperson for the governor said he received complaints about the mural from state business officials and an &quot;anonymous&quot; fax charging that it was reminiscent of &quot;communist North Korea where they use these murals to brainwash the masses&quot;. LePage also ordered that the names of seven conference rooms in the state department of labor be changed, including one named after Perkins. A lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court seeking &quot;to confirm the mural&#x27;s current location, ensure that the artwork is adequately preserved, and ultimately to restore it to the Department of Labor&#x27;s lobby in Augusta&quot;.

, the mural resides in the Maine State Museum, at the entrance to the Maine State Library and Maine State Archives.

===Veneration===
In 2022, Frances Perkins was officially added to the Episcopal Church liturgical calendar with a feast day on 13 May.

===In popular culture===
Perkins is a minor character in the 1977 Broadway musical &quot;Annie&quot;, in which she, alongside Harold Ickes, is ordered by Roosevelt to sing along to the song &quot;Tomorrow&quot; with the title character. It is during this scene in the show that Roosevelt&#x27;s cabinet comes up with the idea of the New Deal.

In the 1987 American movie &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, the lead character Frances &quot;Baby&quot; Houseman reveals that she was named after Perkins.

David Brooks&#x27;s 2015 book &quot;The Road to Character&quot; includes an extensive chapter biography of Perkins.

&quot;Becoming Madam Secretary&quot; by New York Times author Stephanie Dray tells the story of Ms. Perkins’ life. It was copyrighted in 2024 and published by Thorndike Press.

<doc id="433285" wikidata="Q261209" url="?curid=433285" title="Bullitt">
<text>Bullitt is a 1968 American action thriller film directed by Peter Yates from a screenplay by Alan R. Trustman and Harry Kleiner and based on the 1963 crime novel &quot;Mute Witness&quot; by Robert L. Fish. It stars Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughn, Jacqueline Bisset, Don Gordon, Robert Duvall, Simon Oakland, and Norman Fell. In the film, detective Frank Bullitt (McQueen) investigates the murder of a witness he was assigned to protect.

A star vehicle for McQueen, &quot;Bullitt&quot; began development once Yates was hired upon the completion of the screenplay, which differs significantly from Fish&#x27;s novel. Principal photography took place throughout 1967, with filming primarily taking place on location in San Francisco. The film was produced by McQueen&#x27;s Solar Productions, with Robert Relyea as executive producer alongside Philip D&#x27;Antoni. Lalo Schifrin wrote the film&#x27;s jazz-inspired score. &quot;Bullitt&quot; is notable for its extensive use of practical locations and stunt work.

&quot;Bullitt&quot; was released in the United States on October 17, 1968, by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts. It was a critical success, with praise for its screenplay, editing, and action sequences: its car chase sequence is regarded as one of the most influential in film history. The film received numerous awards and nominations, including being nominated for two Academy Awards, winning for Best Film Editing. It grossed $42.3 million worldwide, becoming one of the highest-grossing films of 1968. In 2007, &quot;Bullitt&quot; was preserved in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress.

==Plot==

On a Friday night in Chicago, mobster Johnny Ross briefly meets his brother, Pete, after fleeing the Outfit. The next morning, Lieutenant Frank Bullitt of the San Francisco Police Department, along with his team, Delgetti and Stanton, are tasked by U.S. Senator Walter Chalmers with guarding Ross over the weekend, until he can be presented as a witness to a Senate subcommittee hearing on organized crime Monday morning. The detectives are told he is in a cheap hotel on the Embarcadero. At 1 a.m. Sunday, while Stanton is phoning Bullitt to say Chalmers and a friend want to come up, Ross unchains the room door. Two hitmen burst in, shooting Stanton in the leg and Ross in the chest.

Chalmers holds Bullitt responsible. After Ross dies in hospital, Bullitt sends the body to the morgue as a John Doe in order to keep the investigation open. An informant states that Ross was in San Francisco because he had stolen millions of dollars from the Outfit. Bullitt also discovers that Ross made a long-distance phone call to a hotel in San Mateo. While driving his Ford Mustang, Bullitt becomes aware he is being followed by a Dodge Charger. He eludes his pursuers, and then turns the tables as he follows the hitmen. An extended chase ensues through the city, ending in an explosion in Brisbane when the Charger crashes into a gas station, killing the two hitmen.

Bullitt and Delgetti are confronted by their superior, Captain Sam Bennett. Chalmers (who is assisted by SFPD Captain Baker) serves them a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, forcing Bullitt to reveal that Ross has died. Bennett ignores the writ because it is Sunday; this allows Bullitt to investigate the lead of the long-distance phone call to San Mateo. With no car, Bullitt gets a ride from his architect girlfriend, Cathy. The two of them find a woman garroted in her hotel room. Cathy confronts Bullitt about his work, saying, &quot;You&#x27;re living in a sewer, Frank.&quot; She wonders, &quot;What will happen to us in time?&quot;

Bullitt and Delgetti examine the victim&#x27;s luggage and discover a travel brochure for Rome, as well as traveler&#x27;s checks made out to an Albert and Dorothy Renick. Bullitt requests their passport applications from Chicago. Bullitt, Bennett, Chalmers and Baker gather around the telecopier as the applications arrive. It turns out Chalmers sent Bullitt to guard a doppelgänger, Albert Renick, a used car salesman from Chicago, while his wife Dorothy was staying in San Mateo. Bullitt realizes that Ross was playing the politically ambitious Chalmers by using Renick as a decoy so he could slip out of the country Sunday night.

Delgetti and Bullitt watch the Rome gate at San Francisco International Airport. However, Bullitt realizes the real Ross (on Renick&#x27;s passport) probably switched to an earlier London flight, which is ordered to return to the terminal. Bullitt chases a fleeing Ross back to the crowded passenger terminal, where Ross guns down a deputy sheriff before being shot dead by Bullitt. Chalmers arrives to survey the scene, but leaves saying nothing. Early Monday morning, Bullitt arrives home to find Cathy asleep in his bed, having chosen to stay.

==Cast==
Credits from the American Film Institute.
* Steve McQueen as San Francisco Police Lieutenant Frank Bullitt. McQueen based his performance on San Francisco Inspector Dave Toschi, with whom he worked prior to filming. McQueen even copied Toschi&#x27;s unique &quot;fast-draw&quot; shoulder holster. Toschi later became famous, along with Inspector Bill Armstrong, as the lead San Francisco investigators of the Zodiac Killer murders that began shortly after the release of &quot;Bullitt&quot;.
* Robert Vaughn as Walter Chalmers. Vaughn initially turned down the role, feeling the plot was too &quot;thin.&quot; Decades later, when Vaughn considered entering politics, he discovered that people couldn&#x27;t take him seriously, or found him untrustworthy, as they remembered his performance in this film.
* Jacqueline Bisset as Cathy, Bullitt&#x27;s girlfriend. Katharine Ross was offered the role, but she turned it down, as she felt the part was just too small.
* Don Gordon as Inspector &quot;Del&quot; Delgetti, Bullitt&#x27;s partner. This film was the first of three times McQueen worked on-screen with his real-life friend Gordon, the other two were in &quot;Papillon&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (1974).
* Robert Duvall as Weissberg, a cab driver. 
* Simon Oakland as Captain Sam Bennett
* Norman Fell as Captain Baker
* Carl Reindel as Sergeant Carl Stanton
* Felice Orlandi as Albert Renick, the fake &quot;Johnny Ross&quot;

==Production==
&quot;Bullitt&quot; was co-produced by McQueen&#x27;s Solar Productions and Warner Bros.-Seven Arts. The film was pitched to Jack L. Warner as &quot;doing authority differently&quot;.

===Development===
&quot;Bullitt&quot; was director Peter Yates&#x27; first American film. He was hired after McQueen saw his 1967 U.K. feature, &quot;Robbery&quot;, with its extended car chase. Joseph E. Levine, whose Embassy Pictures had distributed &quot;Robbery&quot;, did not like the film much, but Alan Trustman, who saw the picture the week he was writing the &quot;Bullitt&quot; chase scenes, insisted that McQueen, Relyea and D&#x27;Antoni (none of whom had ever heard of Yates) see &quot;Robbery&quot; and consider Yates as director for &quot;Bullitt&quot;.

In the original novel &quot;Mute Witness&quot;, the lead character is an older, overweight police lieutenant named Clancy. D&#x27;Antoni and his original co-producer Ernest Pintoff considered the film a vehicle for Spencer Tracy, but his death in 1967 put an end to that. McQueen was a great admirer of Tracy and took on the project, in part, as a tribute to him. The original novel was also set in Chicago, not San Francisco.

=== Realism ===
&quot;Bullitt&quot; is notable for its extensive use of actual locations rather than studio sets, and its attention to procedural detail, from police evidence processing to emergency-room procedures. Director Yates&#x27; use of the new lightweight Arriflex cameras allowed for greater flexibility in location shooting. The film was shot almost entirely on location in San Francisco. In the emergency-room operation scene, real doctors and nurses were used as the supporting cast. According to McQueen, &quot;The thing we tried to achieve was not to do a theatrical film, but a film about reality.&quot;

=== Filming locations ===
&quot;Bullitt&quot; was one of the first feature films to be shot almost entirely on-location in San Francisco. With the exception of the opening setpiece in Chicago, the entire film was shot there. In a 1968 interview, D&#x27;Anatoni reasoned the production would cost no more to shoot in San Francisco than in Los Angeles, despite transportation and housing expenses, because so much money was saved on construction by using real locations.

Filming locations included:

* Mark Hopkins Hotel
* Kennedy Hotel (on Embarcadero and Howard, near the Embarcadero Freeway)
* Nob Hill
* Cow Hollow
* 2700 Vallejo Street, Pacific Heights
* Grace Cathedral
* Enrico&#x27;s (Broadway at Kearny Street)
* San Francisco International Airport

== Car chase scenes ==

At the time of the film&#x27;s release, the car chase scenes featuring McQueen at the wheel in all driver-visual scenes generated prodigious excitement. Leonard Maltin has called it a &quot;now-classic car chase, one of the screen&#x27;s all-time best.&quot; Emanuel Levy wrote in 2003, &quot;&quot;Bullitt&quot; contains one of the most exciting car chases in film history, a sequence that revolutionized Hollywood&#x27;s standards.&quot; In his obituary for Peter Yates, Bruce Weber wrote, &quot;Mr. Yates&#x27; reputation probably rests most securely on &quot;Bullitt&quot; (1968), his first American film – and indeed, on one particular scene, an extended car chase that instantly became a classic.&quot;

=== Filming ===
The chase scene starts at 1:05:00 into the film. The total time of the scene is 10 minutes 53 seconds. It begins under Highway 101 in the city&#x27;s Mission District as Bullitt spots the hitmen&#x27;s car. It ends outside the city, at the Brisbane exit of the Guadalupe Canyon Parkway on San Bruno Mountain. Shooting occurred over a period of weeks. The chase sequence combined several locations, located miles apart and edited together. Mapping the movie route shows that it is not continuous and is impossible to follow in real time.

Two 1968 325-horsepower 390 &quot;FE&quot; V8 Ford Mustang GT Fastbacks with four-speed manual transmissions in Highland Green were purchased by Warner Bros. for the film. The Mustangs&#x27; engines, brakes and suspensions were heavily modified for the chase by veteran car racer and technician Max Balchowsky. Ford Motor Company originally lent two Galaxie sedans for the chase scenes, but the producers found the cars too heavy for the jumps over the hills of San Francisco. They also felt a Ford-on-Ford battle would not be believable on screen. The cars were replaced with 1968 375-horsepower 440 &quot;Magnum&quot; V8 Dodge Chargers in black. The engines in the Dodge Chargers were left largely unmodified, but the suspensions were mildly upgraded to cope with the demands of the stunt work.

The director called for maximum speeds of about , but the cars (including the chase cars) at times reached speeds of over .

Drivers&#x27; point-of-view shots were used to give the audience a participants&#x27; feel of the chase. Filming took three weeks, resulting in 9 minutes 42 seconds of pursuit. Multiple takes were spliced into a single end product, resulting in discontinuity: Heavy damage on the passenger side of Bullitt&#x27;s car can be seen much earlier than the incident producing it, and the Charger appears to lose five wheel covers, with different covers missing in different shots. Shooting simultaneously from multiple angles and creating a montage from the footage took place to give the illusion of different streets also resulted in the speeding cars passing the same vehicles at multiple times, including, as widely noted, that of a green Volkswagen Beetle.

In one scene, the Charger crashes into the camera; the damaged front fender noticeable in later scenes. Local authorities did not allow the car chase to be filmed on the Golden Gate Bridge, but did permit it in Midtown locations, including Bernal Heights, the Mission District and on the outskirts of neighboring Brisbane.

McQueen, a world-class racecar driver at the time, drove in the close-up scenes, while stunt coordinator Carey Loftin, stuntman and motorcycle racer Bud Ekins, and McQueen&#x27;s usual stunt driver, Loren Janes, drove for the high-speed parts of the chase and performed other dangerous stunts. Ekins, who doubled for McQueen in &quot;The Great Escape&quot; sequence in which McQueen&#x27;s character jumps over a barbed-wire fence on a motorcycle, performs a lowsider crash stunt in front of a skidding truck during the &quot;Bullitt&quot; chase. The Mustang&#x27;s interior rearview mirror goes up and down depending on who is driving: When the mirror is up, McQueen is visible behind the wheel; when it is down, a stunt man is driving.

The black Dodge Charger was driven by veteran stunt driver Bill Hickman, who played one of the hitmen and helped with the chase scene choreography. The other hitman was played by Paul Genge, who played a character who had driven a Dodge off the road to his death in an episode of &quot;Perry Mason&quot; (&quot;The Case of the Sausalito Sunrise&quot;) two years earlier. In a magazine article many years later, one of the drivers involved in the chase sequence remarked that the Charger, with a larger engine (big-block 440 cu. in. versus the 390 cu. in.) and greater horsepower (375 versus 325), was so much faster than the Mustang that the drivers had to keep backing off the accelerator to prevent the Charger from pulling away from the Mustang.

=== Editing ===
The editing of the car chase likely won Frank P. Keller the editing Oscar for 1968, and has been included in lists of the &quot;Best Editing Sequences of All-Time.&quot; In the volume &quot;The Sixties: 1960–1969&quot; (2003), of his book series
&quot;History of the American Cinema&quot;, Cinema Arts professor Paul Monaco wrote:
Billy Fraker, the cinematographer for the film, attributed the success of the chase sequence primarily to the work of the editor, Frank P. Keller. At the time, Keller was credited with cutting the piece in such a superb manner that he made the city of San Francisco a &quot;character&quot; in the film.

The editing of the scene was not without difficulties. Ralph Rosenblum wrote in 1979, &quot;Those who care about such things may know that during the filming of the climactic chase scene in &quot;Bullitt&quot;, an out-of-control car filled with dummies tripped a wire which prematurely sent a costly set up in flames, and that editor Frank Keller salvaged the near-catastrophe with a clever and unusual juxtaposition of images that made the explosion appear to go off on time.&quot;

The chase scene has also been cited by critics as groundbreaking in its realism and originality.

== Music ==

The original score was composed by Lalo Schifrin to track the various moods and the action of the film, with Schifrin&#x27;s signature contemporary American jazz style. The tracks on the soundtrack album are alternate versions of those heard in the film, re-recorded by Schifrin with leading jazz musicians, including Bud Shank (flute), Carol Kaye (electric bass), Ray Brown (bass), Howard Roberts (guitar) and Larry Bunker (drums).

In 2000, the original arrangements, as heard in the film, were recreated by Schifrin in a recording session with the WDR Big Band in Cologne, Germany, and released on the Aleph label. The release also includes re-recordings of the 1968 soundtrack album arrangements for some tracks.

In 2009, the never-before-released original recording of the score heard in the film, recorded by Schifrin on the Warner Bros. scoring stage with engineer Dan Wallin, was made available by &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot;. Some score passages and cues are virtually identical to the official soundtrack album, although many softer, moodier cues from the film were not chosen or had been rewritten for the soundtrack release. Also included are additional cues not used in the film. In addition, the two-CD set features the official soundtrack album, newly mixed from the 1-inch master tape.

In the restaurant scene with McQueen and Bissett, the live band playing in the background is Meridian West, a jazz quartet that McQueen had seen performing at The Trident, a famous restaurant in Sausalito.

==Reception==
&quot;Bullitt&quot; garnered both critical acclaim and box-office success.

===Box office===
The film opened at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on Thursday, October 17, 1968, together with a new stage show. It grossed $210,000 in its first week, including a Hall-record Saturday of $49,073. Produced on a $5.5 million budget, the film grossed $19 million in 1968, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film that year, and over $42.3 million in the U.S. through 2021.

===Critical response===
&quot;Bullitt&quot; was well received by critics, and is considered by some to be one of the best films of 1968. At the time, Renata Adler made the film a &quot;The New York Times&quot; Critics&#x27; Pick, calling it a &quot;terrific movie, just right for Steve McQueen: Fast, well acted, written the way people talk&quot;. According to Adler, &quot;The ending should satisfy fans from &quot;Dragnet&quot; to Camus.&quot;

In 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the film on its list of the &quot;Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot;. In 2011, &quot;Time&quot; listed it among the &quot;15 Greatest Movie Car Chases of All Time&quot;, describing it as &quot;the one, the first, the granddaddy, the chase on the top of almost every list&quot;, and saying, &quot;&quot;Bullitt&quot;″s car chase is a reminder that every great such scene is a triumph of editing as much as it is stunt work&quot;. Quentin Tarantino called it &quot;one of the best directed movies ever made.&quot;

It won 1968&#x27;s Academy Award for Best Editing. Among 21st-century critics, it holds a 98% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, representing positive reviews from 45 of 46 critics, with an average rating of 7.90/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Steve McQueen is cool as ice in this thrilling police procedural that also happens to contain the arguably greatest car chase ever.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 81 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

===Awards and honours===
The film was nominated for and won several critical awards. Frank P. Keller won the 1969 Academy Award for Best Film Editing, and it was also nominated for Best Sound. Five nominations at the BAFTA Film Awards for 1969 included Best Director for Peter Yates, Best Supporting Actor for Robert Vaughn, Best Cinematography for William A. Fraker, Best Film Editing for Frank P. Keller, and Best Sound Track. Robert Fish, Harry Kleiner and Alan Trustman won the 1969 Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture. Keller won the American Cinema Editors Eddie Award for Best Edited Feature Film. The film also received the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Cinematography (William A. Fraker) and the Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing – Feature Film. At the 1970 Laurel Awards, the film received Golden Laurel nominations for Best Action Drama, Best Action Performance (Steve McQueen) and Best Female New Face (Jacqueline Bisset). In 2000, the Society of Camera Operators awarded &quot;Bullitt&quot; its &quot;Historical Shot&quot; award to David M. Walsh.

==== Vehicles ====

Warner Bros. ordered two identical 1968 Mustangs for filming. Both were painted Highland Green and had the GT package with 390 CID engines. These cars had the sequential vehicle identification numbers 8R02S125558 and 8R02S125559. Prior to filming, the cars were modified by Max Balchowsky. Car &#x27;558 was modified and used for the stunt driving, while &#x27;559 was used for McQueen&#x27;s close-up driving shots.

After the filming was complete, &#x27;559 was repaired and repainted with a single coat of Highland Green, and sold to Warner Bros. employee Robert Ross. Ross drove it until 1970, then sold it to Frank Marranca, who had it shipped from California to New Jersey. In 1974, Marranca sold the car to Robert Kiernan through an ad in &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot;. In 1977, Steve McQueen attempted to buy it back but was refused. The Kiernans drove it for 46,000 miles as their family car, then put it in storage in 1980. Kiernan&#x27;s son, Sean, began to restore the vehicle in 2014, and had it authenticated in 2016, with documentation that included McQueen&#x27;s letter offering to purchase it. On January 10, 2020, the car was sold by Mecum Auctions for $3.7 million (~$ in ) to an unidentified buyer.

Car &#x27;558 had been damaged severely during filming and was subsequently sent to a scrapyard. In the ensuing decades, the car was assumed to be lost. In 2016, though, Hugo Sanchez purchased a pair of Mustang coupes from the backyard of a house near Los Cabos, Mexico. He then sent the cars to Ralph Garcia to start work on turning one into a clone of the &quot;Eleanor&quot; Mustang from the film &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot;. Realizing one of the two Mustangs was an S-code, Garcia had the car authenticated by Kevin Marti. The authentication revealed this to be the lost Bullitt car. In 2017, Sanchez and Garcia began to give the car a full restoration.

Stunt driver Bill Hickman provided two 1968 Dodge Chargers, which were painted black for use in the film. One was reserved for closeups and the other performed the stunts. Vehicle supervisor Max Balchowsky strengthened the suspension of the stunt car but left the engines mostly unmodified.

===Legacy===
The famous car chase was later referenced in, among others, Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s screwball comedy film, &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot;, the Clint Eastwood film, &quot;The Dead Pool&quot;, in the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode, &quot;Bendin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;, and in the &quot;Archer&quot; episode, &quot;The Kanes&quot;. The car chase can be seen playing on the screen in the drive-in theater scene in the 2014 film, &quot;Need for Speed&quot;. The 13th episode of the TV series &quot;Alcatraz&quot; includes a recreation of the chase scene, with newer models of the Mustang and Charger. &quot;Bullitt&quot; producer Philip D&#x27;Antoni went on to film two more car chases, &quot;The French Connection&quot; and &quot;The Seven-Ups&quot;, both set and shot in New York City. &quot;The Bullitt Mustang&quot; was a Season 6 episode of &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;, in which the car was central to a plot involving its theft.

The Ford Mustang name has been closely associated with the film. In 2001, the Ford Motor Company released the &quot;Bullitt&quot; edition Ford Mustang GT. Another version of the Ford Mustang Bullitt, which is closer to resembling the original film Mustang, was released in 2008 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the film. A third version was released in 2018 for the 2019 and 2020 model years. In 2009, Bud Brutsman of &quot;Overhaulin&#x27;&quot; built an authentic-looking replica of the &quot;Bullitt&quot; Mustang, fully loaded with modern components, for the five-episode 2009 TV series, &quot;Celebrity Rides: Hollywood&#x27;s Speeding Bullitt&quot;, hosted by Chad McQueen, son of Steve McQueen.

The Mustang is featured in the 2003 video game &quot;Ford Racing 2&quot;, in a drafting challenge, on a course named Port Side. It appears in the Movie Stars category, along with other famous cars such as the Ford Torino from &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; and the Ford Mustang Mach 1 from &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;. In the 2011 video game, &quot;&quot;, the &quot;Bite the Bullet&quot; mission is based on the famous chase scene, with licensed versions of the Mustang and Charger from the film.

Steve McQueen&#x27;s likeness as Frank Bullitt was used in two Ford commercials. The first was for the Europe-only 1997 Ford Puma, which featured a special-effects montage of McQueen (who died in 1980) driving a new Puma around San Francisco before parking it in a studio apartment garage beside the film Mustang and the motorcycle from &quot;The Great Escape&quot;.

In a 2004 commercial for the 2005 Mustang, special effects were again used to create the illusion of McQueen driving the new Mustang, after a man receives a &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;-style epiphany and constructs a racetrack in the middle of a cornfield.

Several items of clothing worn by McQueen&#x27;s &quot;Bullitt&quot; received a boost in popularity thanks to the film: desert boots, a trench coat, a blue turtleneck sweater, and most famously, a brown tweed jacket with elbow patches.

In February 2022, it was announced that Steven Spielberg will be directing and producing a new film centered on the Frank Bullitt character for Warner Bros. Pictures, with Josh Singer writing the screenplay. The film will be an original story, not a remake of the original film. Chad McQueen and niece Molly McQueen (son and granddaughter of Steve) will be executive producers. In November 2022, Bradley Cooper was cast as Frank Bullitt.

<text>Polykleitos the Younger (; fl. ) was an Ancient Greek sculptor of athletes. His greatest achievements, however, were as an architect. Polykleitos the Younger was the architect of the Theatre and Tholos at Epidaurus. Started around 360 BC, the Tholos exhibited elaborate detailing, especially on the Corinthian capitals of its interior columns. These columns would influence most later designs for that order. He was the son of the Classical Greek sculptor Polykleitos, the Elder. Later in his life, Polykleitos built many other works of art, most of his work on athletes.

<doc id="433310" wikidata="Q1524709" url="?curid=433310" title="Gilwell Park">
<text>Gilwell Park is The Scout Association&#x27;s principal camp site and activity centre in the United Kingdom. It is a site, located in East London in the Sewardstonebury area of Waltham Abbey within Epping Forest near the border with Chingford. It is used by Scout and Guide groups. Adult Scout leader training undertaken at Gilwell Park since 1919 is known as Wood Badge training. Scout leaders from many countries have trained at Gilwell Park and Wood Badge training was followed by some other Scout organisations, and, therefore, Gilwell Park has taken on importance to other Scout organisations.

Gilwell Park has a number of camping fields, indoor accommodation, historical sites, Scouting monuments and outdoor adventure activities. It can accommodate up to 10,000 people and regularly does so. It is also used by schools and other youth organisations and hosts social events such as weddings and birthday parties.

Gilwell Park is also host to Scout Adventures Gilwell Park, one of twelve national centres run by or in partnership with The Scout Association, including Downe and Youlbury.

Gilwell Park was bought for The Boy Scouts Association in 1919, by one of its Scout commissioners, William de Bois Maclaren to provide camping facilities for London Scouts. 

== History ==

=== Late Middle Ages to 18th century===
The history of Gilwell Park can be traced to 1407, when John Crow owned Gyldiefords, the land that would become Gilwell Park. Between 1407 and 1422, Crow sold the land to Richard Rolfe and the area became known as Gillrolfes; &quot;Gill&quot; being Old English for glen. Following Rolfe&#x27;s death in 1422, different sections of the property came to be called &quot;Great Gilwell&quot; and &quot;Little Gilwell.&quot; The two areas were named after the Old English &quot;wella&quot; (spring). A farmhouse has stood at Gilwell Farm ever since.

Around this time, Richard Osbourne purchased an adjoining property and in 1442, he built a large dwelling called Osborne Hall, which stood for 300 years. According to a local legend, in the early 16th century, King Henry VIII owned the land and built a hunting lodge for his son Edward. Around 1736, highwayman Dick Turpin began using Gilwell&#x27;s forests to hide and for ambushing travellers and freight along roads leading into London.

In 1754, William Skrimshire purchased Great Gilwell, Little Gilwell and half of Osborne&#x27;s estate, including Osborne Hall. Skrimshire demolished Osborne Hall and built a new residence, which he also called Osborne Hall and is now called the White House. Timbers in the White House can be dated to this time but not to any previous era. Leonard Tresilian (?–1792) bought the estate in 1771 and expanded the land holdings and size of the residence.

After Tresilian&#x27;s first wife Margaret Holland died young after bearing three daughters, he married Elizabeth Fawson. Desiring that Gilwell pass on to his eldest daughter, who was also named Margaret (1750 – c.1844), Tresilian drew up a detailed prenuptial agreement with Fawson&#x27;s father. By the time of Tresilian&#x27;s death in 1792, the younger Margaret had married William Bassett Chinnery (1766–1834), the elder brother of painter George Chinnery.

=== 18th century to early 20th century===
The Chinnerys were wealthy and influential. William Chinnery&#x27;s father, who was also named William, owned trading ships and named one Gilwell in 1800. William and Margaret Chinnery initially lived in London and after three years of marriage they inherited Gilwell in 1792 and moved to the property in 1793. They soon shocked the populace by renaming Osborne Hall to &quot;Gilwell Hall&quot;. William Chinnery expanded Gilwell&#x27;s land holdings through significant purchases over 15 years and with his wife, transformed it into a country estate with gardens, paths and statues. Parts of the garden, paths and dwelling modifications existed into the 21st century. William Chinnery was exposed as the embezzler of a small fortune from his employer the British Treasury and was dismissed from all his posts on 12 March 1812. On 2 July the same year, Margaret Chinnery was forced to sign over Gilwell Estate to the Exchequer.

The Chinnery family were prominent enough for members of the English nobility to visit them often during the 1790s and early 19th century. King George III visited on occasion and the Prince Regent, who later became George IV, was a regular visitor. George III&#x27;s seventh son Prince Adolphus became a family friend, lived at Gilwell for a while and tutored the Chinnerys&#x27; eldest son George.

In 1815, Gilpin Gorst bought the estate at public auction and his son sold it to Thomas Usborne in 1824. When London Bridge was replaced in 1826, Usborne bought pieces of the stone balustrades, which date to 1209 and erected them around the Buffalo Lawn behind the White House. The estate changed ownership more times but these families did not maintain the property and by 1900, it had fallen into disrepair. In 1911 local resident Reverend Cranshaw bought the estate; he was the last owner prior to The Boy Scouts Association.

====Purchase by The Boy Scouts Association====
William de Bois Maclaren, a wealthy publisher and Scout Commissioner from Rosneath, Dumbartonshire, Scotland, suggested a campsite was needed for Scouts in the East End of London. The Boy Scouts Association appointed its Scout Commissioner of the East End, P.B. Nevill, to deal with the issue. On 20 November 1918, over dinner at Roland House, the Scout Hostel in Stepney run by Nevill, Maclaren agreed to donate £7,000 to the project. Part of the agreement included narrowing the search for suitable land to Hainault Forest and Epping Forest. Rover Scouts searched both without success but John Gayfer, a young assistant Scoutmaster, suggested Gilwell Hall, which he visited to watch birds. Nevill visited the estate and was impressed, though the buildings were in poor condition. The estate. which then occupied , was for sale for £7,000, the sum Maclaren had donated. In early 1919, Maclaren purchased the estate for The Boy Scouts Association. Nevill first took his Rover Scouts to begin repairing the estate on 17 April 1919. Maclaren was a frequent visitor to Gilwell Park and helped repair the buildings and donated another £3,000. An official opening was planned for 19 July 1919 but was delayed until 26 July so Scouts could participate in the Official Peace Festival commemorating the end of the First World War. Invitations were changed by hand to save money.

Maclaren&#x27;s interest had been to provide a campground for Scouts but Robert Baden-Powell envisaged a training centre for Scouters and the first adult Scout leader training, with eighteen participants, took place in September 1919. In the 1920s, significant remodeling and construction was done but, because of limited finances, few improvements were made during the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Baden-Powell took the park&#x27;s name as the territorial designation in his peerage title &quot;1st Baron Baden-Powell of Gilwell&quot; in 1929.

=== Origin of the axe and log totem ===
The symbol of the axe in the log is associated with feudalism that was instituted after the invasion and conquest of England by William the Conqueror. In that era, property, including forests, were owned by the landed barons and knights. Serfs were forbidden to cut wood from trees in the forest and only permitted to gather fallen wood. A freeman who carried an axe in a nobleman&#x27;s forest demonstrated he had earned the right by service.

The axe-and-log logo was conceived by Francis Gidney in the early 1920s to distinguish Gilwell Park from the Scout Headquarters. Gidney wanted to associate Gilwell Park with the outdoors and scoutcraft rather than the business and administrative headquarters offices. At Wood Badge courses, axe blades were masked for safety by being buried in a log. Seeing this, Gidney chose the axe-and-log as the totem of Gilwell Park. This logo came to be strongly associated with Wood Badge leader training and is still used on certificates, flags and other items.

===1940s and later development ===
In 1940, during the Second World War, the War Ministry requisitioned the Gilwell estate as a local command, training and ordnance centre and remained there until 1945. Little remains at the estate from this period, except a hole that was created by a bomb the Luftwaffe dropped. The hole was enlarged and is now used for swimming and canoeing.

The purchase of Gilwellbury and adjoining land in 1945 allowed The Scout Association to close the original road and fully use Branchet Field. It was originally used for small retreats and conferences but is now used as staff accommodation. The Ministry of Education assisted in the purchase.

After the war, The Boy Scouts Association bought adjoining land to increase the estate and protect it from rapidly approaching new developments. These areas are called The Quick, New Field and Hilly Field. An additional purchase and a donation from South Africa in the early 1950s brought the estate to its present size. Camping facilities for Scouts were extended until the early 1960s. Training and sleeping facilities were added in the early 1970s.

The Gilwell Farmhouse is believed to date from the early 18th century, making it the oldest original building at Gilwell Park. It is composed of two buildings that were joined. There is a brick wellhead on the farm that is known as the &quot;Gil Well&quot;. A field adjoining the boundaries of Gilwell Park, known as Bill Oddie Field, affords dramatic views of the London skyline over Pole Hill, Chingford. The field was named in 2006 after employees of The Scout Association saw television ornithologist Bill Oddie recording a programme there.

During the 1970s, the Dorothy Hughes Pack Holiday Centre for Cub Scouts and the Colquhoun International Centre for training Scouters – which was originally called The International Hall of Friendship – were built. In the 1980s, the White House was extensive remodelled. In April 2001, The Scout Association moved its program staff from London to Gilwell Park, where its training staff were already located. Extensive renovations were done to the White House and other buildings. With a budget of £20,000,000 and individual contributions as high as £500,000, improvements to programs and facilities occurred in preparation for the 21st World Scout Jamboree in 2007, which was the 100th anniversary of Scouting, hosted at nearby Hylands Park, Chelmsford, with related activities held at Gilwell Park. Gilwell Park generates over £1,000,000 a year for The Scout Association through conference fees, accommodation fees and sales of materials.

=== Leader training ===

The most-prominent leader-training courses conducted at Gilwell Park are Wood Badge courses. Francis Gidney, the first Camp Chief, conducted the first Wood Badge course there in September 1919. Leaders from all over the world receive automatic membership in 1st Gilwell Park Scout Group (Gilwell Troop 1) on completion of the Wood Badge course. These leaders are henceforth called Wood Badgers or Gilwellians. Any location in which Wood Badgers meet is called Gilwell Field. Holders of the Wood Badge become members of the 1st Gilwell Park Scout Group, which meets every first weekend of September in Gilwell Park for the Gilwell Reunion.

=== Camp Chiefs and other staff ===

Captain Francis &quot;Skipper&quot; Gidney became the first Camp Chief in May 1919 and served until 1923. He organized the first Wood Badge training and contributed to setting up Gilwell Park as the Scouters&#x27; training centre. The Gidney Cabin was built and named in his honour in 1929 to serve as a training centre. The second Camp Chief was John Skinner Wilson, who served from 1923 until 1939. Wilson had been an Indian Imperial Police colonel when he became a Scout Leader in 1917. In 1921 he travelled to Gilwell Park to take leader training, which led to his retirement from the Indian Police in 1922 to become a full-time Scout Association official. He was honoured with the Bronze Wolf Award in 1937, the only distinction of the World Organization of the Scout Movement.

R.F. &quot;John&quot; Thurman was a British Scout Leader who served as Camp Chief from 1943 until 1969 and was awarded the Bronze Wolf Award in 1959. He was a strong promoter of Scout training and wrote books on the subject. The Thurman Memorial stands near The Pigsty. Thurman was succeeded by John Huskin as director of leader training.

Don Potter (1902–2004) was an English sculptor and wood carver who was a lifelong staff member at Gilwell Park, serving as a Gilwell Master Craftsman. Potter created wood carvings at Gilwell Park, including the Jim Green Gate, Gidney Cabin, the Leopard Gates and totems he carved for the 1929 World Jamboree.

=== International volunteers ===
Each year, Scout Adventures recruits up to 120 volunteers from over 30 countries to assist in the running of its centres. Scout Adventures at Gilwell Park has between 20 and 50 volunteers, who stay for a maximum of one year and are provided with accommodation in return for their work. These volunteers are trained to run activity sessions for guests, carry out maintenance and improvement works on the site and provide customer service.

A purpose-built accommodation building was opened in 2016 to house an increasing number of volunteers following the degradation of previous accommodation in The Den and Gilwellbury. The International Volunteer Lodge cost £1.2m to build, the funding for which came from the Jack Petchey Foundation and several private donors. The building is mostly timber framed with a large social space constructed using glulam beams and includes a two-storey sleeping area. This provides 26 double bedrooms and an accessible bedroom, all with en-suite facilities. The single storey social spaces include a drying and boot room, laundry room, open plan kitchen, dining and lounge area, quiet room and cinema-style room. Visitors are allowed entry due to stipulations laid down by donor bequests.

=== White House ===

The White House became the headquarters of The Scout Association on 27 April 2001, although Baden-Powell House (the former headquarters) still houses some departments of the association. The White House is used as a hotel and has conference rooms on the ground floor, following extensive renovations in the 1990s. The hotel comprises 41 guest bedrooms (35 en-suite) across the White House and its modern extension.

=== Colquhoun International Centre ===
Colquhoun International Centre (CIC) was built in 1971 as a Scout leader training centre and was renovated in 1995. The building has a main hall that can seat up to 250 people, two smaller training suites and five seminar rooms. The main hall is regularly used for large weddings, dinners and parties; with the seminar rooms and training suites used for conferences and meetings. The CIC also houses a second bar that is used during functions.

== Attractions ==
Gilwell Park has many attractions, primarily Scouting in nature. It has a souvenir shop called The Providore. Gilwell Park museum has closed and is now called the &quot;Heritage Collection.&quot; 

=== Buildings of note ===

The White House, which was built in 1750, is timber framed. It was extended in 1830 and in the 1960s. The exterior is covered in hung slates, which caused extensive damage to the original frame, which required extensive repairs in 1994. The 1797 chimneys are pointed to stop birds nesting and draw smoke up from the fire. The lawn in front of the building was the house&#x27;s original turning circle and the road was once a thoroughfare from Chingford to Waltham Abbey.

The White House is connected to The Barn (originally The Stables), a red-brick building built in 1926. The archway in the centre of the building was originally an open passageway. It now houses the reception area for the Training and Event Centre. The first floor of the building was used as training rooms for Cub Scout Leaders. A clock on the front of the building was a gift from a former Japanese Chief Scout Count Sano, who was present at an early training course at Gilwell Park. The weather vane on the roof depicts Dick Turpin, who was rumoured to live on the site.

Close to the estate entrance, The Lodge was built in 1934 as the Camp Chief&#x27;s home; this was succeeded by the Director of Programme and Development. The building is now used to accommodate Scout Association staff and host internal meetings.

Gilwell Farm is the oldest building on the site still extant, dating from the 1600s. The building started as two separate cottages. In the grounds of the building is the site&#x27;s last-remaining well, which is known as Gil Well. The Farm was refurbished from its derelict state, opening in 2015 as the new offices and reception of Scout Adventures Gilwell Park. The nearby Leopard Gates mark the original entrance to Gilwell Park and were carved by Gilwell master craftsman Don Potter in 1928.

The Lid, which originally consisted of a roof but no walls, was a wet-weather shelter built in 1967. In 2009, the building was renovated and now houses a large activity hall, two classrooms, staff space and a large store room. The activity hall houses all the indoor activities on-site, including an archery range and climbing walls. In front of The Lid is the R. Tait McKenzie statue, &quot;The Ideal Scout&quot;, which was gifted by the Boy Scouts of America in 1966.

The Barnacle was built in 1950 as a first-aid centre but later became a volunteer-run cottage hospital for visitors and the local community. It housed a six-bed ward, isolation room, dental surgery, X-ray room and operating theatre. In the late 1980s, the building became volunteer accommodation until it was decommissioned in 2016 with the opening of the International Volunteer Lodge. , the building is empty and has an uncertain future.

The Pigsty, a small gardeners shed located on The Orchard, has been preserved as the first campsite at Gilwell Park. The first group of Rover Scouts who arrived to prepare the site when it was purchased in 1919 slept here when the weather proved too inclement to pitch their tents.

=== Faith buildings ===
The site houses to five places of worship for Scouts and other visitors located along the Gilwell Park Faith Walk, including a Buddhist sala, Jewish synagogue and an Islamic mosque. The sala was donated to Gilwell Park in 1967 by the Boy Scouts of Thailand and the Buddha statue was a gift from the Thai government and is over 1,000 years old. Thai ambassadors to the United Kingdom often visit the sala because it is their responsibility to care for it. The Gilwell Park mosque was established in 2015.

=== Camp Square ===
Camp Square includes a Warden&#x27;s Office (recently demolished), museum (currently empty), archery range (former Scout Shop – no longer in use), shop, soft drinks bar, staff space and toilet block. In the centre of the Square is the clock tower, known as Big Mac, which was named after Camp Warden Alfred Macintosh.

Behind Camp Square, The Bomb Hole was created when a bomb was dropped on the site during the Second World War, creating a small crater. The Bomb Hole has been extended several times and is now used for kayaking, raft building and pond-dipping activities.

=== Other attractions ===
Two campfire circles are used extensively during the peak camping season. Large Campfire Circle has a Maori Gateway that was presented by the Scouts New Zealand in 1951.

Lime Walk, which was constructed by previous estate owner Margaret Chinnery, surrounds the training ground, which was the original main lawn of the White House. Few of the lime trees survive to this day. On this path sits Jim Green Gate, a 1930 tribute to Jim Green, an editor of &quot;The Scouter&quot; magazine.

Buffalo Lawn is so called because of a replica of the Boy Scouts of America Silver Buffalo Award that was presented by the Boy Scouts of America in 1926 to honour the Unknown Scout who helped William D. Boyce take Scouting to the United States. Located there is a signpost with the directions and distances to World Scout Jamboree sites from Gilwell Park. Surrounding the Buffalo Lawn is part of the original balustrade of London Bridge, which was re-built in 1820. The sections were moved to Gilwell Park after being purchased at auction in 1826.

Considered by many to be the most important Scouting site, Training Ground is where Wood Badge training was held and where the Gilwell oak tree is located. Contrary to popular belief, Wood Badge beads have never been made of Gilwell Oak. On Training Ground sits Gidney Cabin, a memorial to the first Camp Chief Francis Gidney, in 1929. Across from the Gidney Cabin is Thurman Memorial, which was erected in memory of Camp Chief John Thurman.

A caravan trailer that was presented to Chief Scout Sir Robert Baden-Powell along with a new Rolls-Royce car during the 3rd World Scout Jamboree in 1929 is on display during mid-year months. The caravan was nicknamed Eccles. The car, nicknamed Jam Roll, was sold after his death by Olave Baden-Powell in 1945.

Gilwell Park also has other, smaller memorials, statues, places and objects of historical and Scouting importance.

<text>Syria Palaestina ( ) was the renamed Roman province formerly known as Judaea, following the Roman suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt, in what then became known as the Palestine region between the early 2nd and late 4th centuries AD. The provincial capital was Caesarea Maritima. It forms part of timeline of the period in the region referred to as Roman Palestine.

== Background ==

Judaea was a Roman province that incorporated the regions of Judea, Samaria, Idumea, and Galilee and extended over parts of the former regions of Hasmonean and Herodian Judea. It was named after Herod&#x27;s Tetrarchy of Judaea, but Roman Judaea encompassed a much larger territory than Judaea. The name &quot;Judaea&quot; ultimately traces to the Iron Age Kingdom of Judah.

Following the deposition of Herod Archelaus in 6 AD, Judea came under direct Roman rule, during which time the Roman governor was given authority to punish by execution. The general population also began to be taxed by Rome. However, Jewish leaders retained broad discretion over affairs within Judaism.

The Herodian kingdom was split into a tetrarchy in 6 AD, which was gradually absorbed into Roman provinces, with Roman Syria annexing Iturea and Trachonitis. The capital of Judaea was shifted from Jerusalem to Caesarea Maritima, which, according to historian Hayim Hillel Ben-Sasson, had been the &quot;administrative capital&quot; of the region beginning in 6 AD.

==History==
During the 1st and 2nd centuries, Judaea became the epicenter of a series of unsuccessful large-scale Jewish rebellions against Rome, known as the Jewish-Roman Wars. The Roman suppression of these revolts led to wide-scale destruction, a very high toll of life and enslavement. The First Jewish-Roman War (66–73) resulted in the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple. Two generations later, the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136) erupted. Judea&#x27;s countryside was devastated, and many were killed, displaced or sold into slavery. Jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled after the failure of the Bar Kokhba revolt.

Following the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt, Jerusalem was rebuilt as a Roman colony under the name of Aelia Capitolina, and Judaea was renamed Syria Palaestina, a term occasionally used among Greco-Romans for centuries to describe the Southern Levant.A Syria-Palaestina included Judea, Samaria, Galilee, Idumaea, and Philistia. The province retained its capital, Caesarea Maritima, and therefore remained distinct from Syria, which was located further north with its capital in Antioch. Jerusalem, which held special religious significance for the Jews but had been destroyed, was rebuilt as the &quot;colonia&quot; Aelia Capitolina. Jews were forbidden to settle there or in the immediate vicinity.

While Syria was divided into several smaller provinces by Septimius Severus, and later again by Diocletian, Syria Palaestina survived into late antiquity. Presumably, it was small enough not to become dangerous as a potential starting point for usurpation attempts. Instead, Diocletian even integrated parts of Arabia Petraea into the province, namely the Negev and the Sinai Peninsula. He moved the Legio X Fretensis from Aelia Capitolina to Aila (today&#x27;s Eilat/Aqaba) to secure the country against Arab incursions. The part of the Roman imperial border that now ran through Palestine was subsequently placed under its own supreme commander, the &quot;dux Palaestinae&quot;, who is known from the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;. The border wall, the Limes Arabicus, which had existed for some time, was pushed further south.

The Crisis of the Third Century (235–284) affected Syria Palaestina, but the fourth century brought an economic upswing due to the Christianization of the Roman Empire and the associated upswing in Christian pilgrimage to the &quot;Holy Land&quot;. In the course of late antiquity, with imperial support, Christianity succeeded in asserting itself against both remnants of Semitic as well as trending Hellenistic Paganism in the land.

The province was split into smaller ones during the fourth and fifth centuries. In 358, areas that had formerly belonged to Arabia Petraea were transformed into a separate province of Palaestina Salutaris with Petra as its capital. The remaining territory was named Palaestina Prima. Around the year 400, it had been further split into a smaller Palaestina Prima and Palaestina Secunda. Palaestina Prima included the heartland with the capital at Caesarea, while Palaestina Secunda extended to Galilee, the Golan, and parts of the Transjordan and its capital was Scythopolis (now Beit She&#x27;an). Salutaris was named Palaestina Tertia or Salutaris.

== Name ==
The name Syria-Palaestina was given to the former Roman province of Judaea in the early 2nd century AD. The renaming is often presented as an act of punitive disassociation in the aftermath of the AD 132-135 Bar Kokhba revolt, identifying Emperor Hadrian as the one responsible for the measure, though no direct evidence suggests exactly when the name change was implemented or by whom, and the renaming may even have taken place before the conclusion of the revolt. While the name Judaea bore an ethnic connotation to Jews, Syria-Palaestina had a strict geographical meaning. Some authors in late antiquity, such as Jerome, continued to refer to the region as Judaea out of habit due to the prominent association with the Jews. This includes an inscription from Ephesos from AD 170–180, honoring the wife of a figure known as &quot;Eroelius Klaros&quot;, who had the epithet &quot;ruler of Judaea&quot; (&quot;[Ερο]υκίου Κλάρου, υπάτου, [ηγ]εμόνος Ιουδ[αίας]&quot;), decades after the recreation of Provincia Judaea as Syria-Palaestina.

Other scholars and commenters disagree with a punitive recent origin for the term, and point it has been used to refer to the Southern Levant at large for centuries since Classical antiquity, when it was first used by Herodotus, and has been used by Jewish authors such as Philo and Josephus while Judaea still existed. It&#x27;s claimed that the name was chosen as the new province was far larger than Judaea, and was resulted from the merger of Judaea with Galilee.

Despite this &quot;Syria&quot; in the name, Palestine was independent of Roman Syria, even to a greater extent than before, since instead of a &quot;legatus Augusti pro praetore&quot;, a higher-ranking governor of consular rank now presided over the region. This in turn was probably due to the fact that in addition to the already existing legion in Caesarea, a second legion was stationed in Legio, increasing the military importance of the province. Exactly when the legion was moved and the rank of the governor&#x27;s post increased is a matter of debate - in any case, these events must have occurred before the governorship of Quintus Tineius Rufus, who took office no later than 130.

== Demographics ==
The population of Syria-Palaestina was of mixed character.

The aftermath of the Bar Kokhba revolt resulted in severe devastation for Judaea&#x27;s Jewish population, including significant loss of life, forced displacements, and widespread enslavement. The scale of suffering was immense, with ancient sources reporting extensive destruction and high casualty rates. It appears that at the end of the revolt, Jewish settlement in Judaea Proper had nearly been eradicated, but remained strong in other parts of Palestine. Jewish survivors faced harsh Roman punitive measures, including expulsion from Jerusalem and other areas, leading to a migration to Galilee and Golan. Some scholars suggest that a number of Jews may have forfeited their Jewish identity and assimilated into the Pagan and early Christian I.e. Gentile populations. Many Jewish captives were sold into slavery across the Roman Empire, contributing to an increase in the Jewish diaspora.

According to Eitan Klein, after the revolt, Roman authorities confiscated lands in Judaea, leading to the resettlement of the region by a diverse population. Archaeological evidence shows that gentile migrants from neighboring Levantine provinces such as Arabia, Syria, and Phoenicia, as well as from the coastal plain and beyond, settled in the area. The new Roman colony of Aelia Capitolina was populated by Roman veterans and migrants from western parts of the empire, who also occupied its surroundings, administrative centers, and main roads. According to Lichtenberger, archaeological evidence from Bayt Nattif suggests a persistence of non-conformist unorthodox Jewish groups that did not adhere to strict Biblical monotheism, as well as remnants of semitic pagan groups related to those of Yahwahist Iron Age Judah in the late Roman period.

In AD 300, Jews formed around a quarter of the population and lived in compact settlements in Galilee, while Samaritans were concentrated in Samaria. By the fifth century, Christianity had gained further ground in the region, and Christians formed a majority in Palestine and Jerusalem through migration and conversion of pagans, Samaritans and Jews.

== Religion ==

=== Roman Imperial cult ===
After the Jewish–Roman wars (66–135), which Epiphanius believed the Cenacle survived, the significance of Jerusalem to Christians entered a period of decline, it having been destroyed and later refounded as the pagan &quot;colonia&quot; of Aelia Capitolina. Christian interest resumed again with the pilgrimage of Empress Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great, c. 326–28.

New pagan cities were founded in Judea at Eleutheropolis (now Bayt Jibrin), Diopolis (now Lod), and Nicopolis.

The Hellenization of Palaestina continued under Septimius Severus (193–211 AD).

=== Early Christianity ===
The Romans destroyed the Jewish community of the Church in Jerusalem, which had existed since the time of Jesus. Traditionally it is believed the Jerusalem Christians waited out the Jewish–Roman wars in Pella in the Decapolis.

The line of Jewish bishops in Jerusalem, which is claimed to have started with James, brother of Jesus as its first bishop, ceased to exist within the Empire. Hans Küng in &quot;Islam: Past Present and Future&quot;, suggests that the Jewish Christians sought refuge in the Arabian Peninsula and he quotes with approval Clemen et al., &quot;This produces the paradox of truly historic significance that while Jewish Christianity was swallowed up in the Christian church, it preserved itself in Islam.&quot;

== Reorganization ==
In circa 390, Syria Palaestina was reorganised into several administrative units: Palaestina Prima, &quot;Palaestina Secunda&quot;, and &quot;Palaestina Tertia&quot; (in the 6th century), Syria Prima and Phoenice and Phoenice Lebanensis. All were included within the larger Eastern Roman (&quot;Byzantine&quot;) Diocese of the East, together with the provinces of Isauria, Cilicia, Cyprus (until 536), Euphratensis, Mesopotamia, Osroene, and Arabia Petraea.

Palaestina Prima consisted of Judaea, Samaria, the Paralia and Peraea, with the governor residing in Caesarea. &quot;Palaestina Secunda&quot; consisted of the Galilee, the lower Jezreel Valley, the regions east of Galilee, and the western part of the former Decapolis, with the seat of government at Scythopolis. &quot;Palaestina Tertia&quot; included the Negev, southern Transjordan part of Arabia, and most of Sinai, with Petra as the usual residence of the governor. Palaestina Tertia was also known as Palaestina Salutaris.

<text>Kandersteg is a municipality in the Frutigen-Niedersimmental administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland. It is located along the valley of the River Kander, west of the Jungfrau massif. It is noted for its spectacular mountain scenery and sylvan alpine landscapes. Tourism is a very significant part of its economic life today. It offers outdoor activities year-round, with hiking trails and mountain climbing as well as downhill and cross-country skiing. Kandersteg hosted the ski jumping and Nordic combined parts of the 2018 Nordic Junior World Ski Championships.

==History==
Kandersteg is first mentioned, together with Kandergrund, in 1352 as &quot;der Kandergrund&quot;.

Prehistorically the area was lightly settled. However, several late-neolithic or early Bronze Age bows have been found on the Lötschberg glaciers and a Bronze Age needle was found in the Golitschenalp. From the Roman era a bridge and part of a road were discovered in the village.

Until 1909 Kandersteg was politically and religiously part of Kandergrund. In 1511 the parish built a chapel in Kandersteg, which survived the iconoclasm of the Protestant Reformation in 1530. It became a filial church of the parish in Kandergrund between 1840 and 1860 and in 1910 became the parish church of the Kandersteg parish. A Roman Catholic church was built in 1927.

Traditionally the local economy relied on seasonal alpine herding and farming and supporting trade over the alpine passes. In the 17th and 18th centuries sulfur mining began in the Oeschinenalp. A match factory opened in the village in the 19th century to take advantage of the sulfur. Beginning around 1850, the municipality grew into a tourist destination. Between 1855 and 1890 five hotels opened and by 1913 there were 19 hotels. The population grew dramatically during construction of the Lötschberg Tunnel and the Lötschberg railway line between 1906 and 1913. The new railroad line and tunnel allowed ever increasing numbers of tourists to visit Kandersteg. A chair lift to Oeschinen Lake opened in 1948, followed by a cable car to the valley floor in 1951. A ski jump was built in 1979. The Kandersteg International Scout Centre opened in 1923.

==Geography==

Kandersteg is located on the northern side of the Bernese Alps at an altitude of above sea level at the foot of the Lötschen and Gemmi Passes.

<text>Toad (Mortimer Toynbee) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, he first appeared in &quot;The X-Men&quot; #4 (March 1964).

Toad is most often depicted as an enemy of the X-Men and was originally a hunchbacked mutant with superhuman leaping ability. He was Magneto&#x27;s in the 1960s line-up of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. He later became the leader of his faction of the Brotherhood, which focused more on criminal activities than mutant liberation.

Since his inception, the character has appeared in numerous media adaptations, such as television series, films, and video games. For example, Ray Park played a significantly different version of Toad in 2000&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; film, and after that, aspects of this Toad have since been implemented into the comic book version. A younger Toad appeared in the film &quot;X-Men: Days of Future Past&quot;, played by Evan Jonigkeit, and an alternative version of the same character can be seen at The Void in the film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;, played by Dany Ramos.

==Publication history==

Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, he first appeared in &quot;X-Men&quot; #4 (March 1964).

==Fictional character biography==
===Lackey===

Mortimer Toynbee hails from York, England, where he entered the world only to be promptly abandoned by his parents. His early years were marked by adversity as he found himself in the care of an orphanage, enduring relentless torment from other children due to his unconventional appearance, which bore the hallmarks of his mutant genetics. Despite his innate intelligence, Mortimer faced unjust assumptions about his mental capabilities, stemming from his extreme shyness and minor learning difficulties during his formative schooling years. These challenges led him to depart from formal education at a remarkably young age, opting to navigate the world on his own terms. However, the scars of his past experiences left him grappling with profound feelings of inferiority, a testament to the enduring impact of his tumultuous upbringing. Later, he was recruited into Magneto&#x27;s original Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, becoming Magneto&#x27;s sycophantic &quot;toady.&quot; Toad believed that Magneto loved him, while Magneto considered this henchman little more than a human shield and a useful lackey. Toad also developed a crush on his teammate Scarlet Witch, but she did not return his feelings as she was repulsed by his appearance, mannerisms, obsequiousness, and lack of hygiene.
As a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Toad aided Magneto in repeated clashes with the X-Men. Magneto tried to use him to infiltrate the X-Men, but they recognized his power and unmasked him. At one point, Magneto and Toad were captured by the alien Stranger as part of his collection, encased in cocoons, and taken on a journey through space. Magneto managed to escape by repairing a spaceship but left Toad behind. When Magneto was re-captured by the Stranger, with whom Professor Xavier had telepathically communicated, he took Toad with him during his second escape, but by then Toad&#x27;s attitude towards his master had already begun to change. Toad aided Magneto against the X-Men once more, but realized that Magneto did not care at all for him, and as a result, Toad rebelled against Magneto and fled his lair with Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch.

However, he was soon captured by Sentinels and then freed by the X-Men. He was later captured with Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch.

===Solo career===
Sometime later, Toad began to study the Stranger&#x27;s technology, becoming familiar with it. He used the Stranger&#x27;s alien technology to menace the Avengers. He even attempted to kill the Angel in a castle outfitted with traps by Arcade. However, he instead turned the castle into an amusement park and became its caretaker. Toad was eventually ejected from the castle by Doctor Doom, and he became suicidal, realizing that he was too dependent on others to work alone. He met and was befriended by Spider-Man, and teamed with Spider-Kid and Frog-Man as the superhero adventurer team, the Misfits. However, Toad suffered from depression.

Eventually, Toad left the Misfits and returned to villainy. He sought repeatedly to abduct the Scarlet Witch but was thwarted by Quicksilver, the Vision and the Scarlet Witch. Much later, he played a &quot;game&quot; with Gideon and sought to enlist Proteus in a new Brotherhood. He then formed his subversive version of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, along with Blob, Pyro and Phantazia. He transformed Karl Lykos back into Sauron and, with the Brotherhood, battled X-Force. Toad&#x27;s Brotherhood also battled X-Factor and then fought Darkhawk, Sleepwalker and Portal.

===&quot;X-Men: Forever&quot;===
Years later, still struggling with depression, Toad was captured by Prosh, along with Juggernaut, Iceman, Jean Grey and Mystique as part of a time-hopping plan to stop a global threat. Toad learned that his deformed body was the result of experimentation by Juggernaut&#x27;s father, Kurt Marko, at Alamogordo, New Mexico, which left Toad with an unstable genetic structure. The Stranger&#x27;s equipment corrected his genetic flaws, resulting in an almost complete metamorphosis: Toad had a taller and slimmer appearance and had his powers augmented. Among the most notable changes was a prehensile tongue. Though his change improved his self-esteem, Toad continued to live life without direction. He joined several more incarnations of the Brotherhood of Mutants, none of which lasted for long.

===Bloodsport tournament===
Not long after, Toad entered the Madripoor Bloodsport Tournament. In his first fight in the tournament, Toad wrapped his extremely long tongue around the villain known as Eel, crushing his opponent&#x27;s bones and seemingly killing him instantly. In the next fight, however, Toad battled Wolverine. His new abilities caught the X-Man off guard, and he managed to deal some damage. However, his overconfidence led to his defeat. Wolverine spared his life, not wanting to partake in the act of cold-blooded murder.

===New X-Men===
Toad made a brief reappearance on Genosha sometime after the island&#x27;s annihilation, leading a team including Paralyzer and Unus to try to rebuild the statue of Magneto as a monument to him.

For reasons unknown, Toad eventually returned to Magneto&#x27;s side during the Planet X storyline; however, Toad was not as docile and subservient as he had been in the past, even openly questioning Magneto at times. Magneto, in turn, is tyrannical in his treatment of Toad, who had become his second-in-command. At that point, the long-presumed-dead Magneto&#x27;s image had taken a Che Guevara-like notoriety, and Toad questioned whether Magneto may have been more powerful dead than alive. Nonetheless, Toad tries to defend his former master, only to be incapacitated by Fantomex, who shoots his kneecaps out. Shortly thereafter, Magneto is killed by Wolverine, and Toad vanishes from the scene.

It is later revealed that this was not the real Magneto, but a copycat named Xorn. It is unknown whether Toad was aware of this. It is revealed that the real Magneto is still alive. So far, Toad has made no known attempts to rejoin him. Unus&#x27; gang has come into conflict with Xavier and his allies, who have gained a foothold on Genoshan soil.

===Civil War===

Toad was among the group of mutants who broke out of the 198 camps, with help from Caliban, Domino, and Shatterstar. The group hid in what they believed was an abandoned nuclear bunker in the Nevada desert. While the X-Men and O*N*E battled outside the bunker, Johnny Dee was instructed by General Lazer to cause chaos amongst the 198. The group of mutants discovered this as Outlaw, being controlled by Johnny, pointed her gun at Domino. Domino&#x27;s powers caused a misfire, giving Toad a chance to bring Outlaw down.

It was then revealed that the bunker was a blast-containment chamber for experimental weapons. As the auto-destruct sequence was initiated, Toad was trapped inside the chamber with the rest of the 198. The X-Men, teaming up with Bishop, Iron Man and Ms. Marvel, quickly found a way to rescue the trapped mutants and the 198 walked away unharmed.

===Dark Reign===
Toad is later seen rioting in San Francisco, angry about the fact that mutants have been forbidden to mate with each other to prevent new mutant births. Toad is faced by Cyclops and defeated. He is later seen being carried by Trance and Dragoness, who are being pursued by H.A.M.M.E.R. agents. After the battle is over, Toad is seen together with Dragoness and Avalanche living on the X-Men&#x27;s new Utopia Homebase.

===Second Coming===
After Cyclops deputizes the population of Utopia to help fight an invasion of Nimrod Sentinels from an unknown future, Toad instructs a group of mutants, including Sack, to remain behind on the island, where they would be safe. In the middle of arguing with Sack, a Nimrod Sentinel fires on them, decapitating Sack and blowing off Toad&#x27;s right index finger.

===Regenesis===
After the fight between Cyclops and Wolverine, the X-Men were divided between Utopia and Westchester. Toad decided to go to Westchester with Wolverine who accepts him as the school&#x27;s janitor.

In the miniseries &quot;Magneto: Not a Hero&quot;, Joseph is resurrected under unknown circumstances and forms a new Brotherhood of Mutants with Astra and mutated deformed versions of Blob, Mastermind, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Toad. It is soon revealed that the mutated versions of Blob, Mastermind, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Toad are clones created by Joseph.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Toad became a member of New Tian&#x27;s strike force following Hydra taking over the United States. He gained a secondary mutation where he can light his tongue on fire.

During the &quot;Hunted&quot; storyline, Toad was among the animal-themed superhumans captured by Taskmaster and Black Ant for Kraven the Hunter&#x27;s Great Hunt sponsored by Arcade&#x27;s company Arcade Industries. After most of the animal-themed superheroes regrouped, Toad mentioned that Man-Bull was killed amidst the chaos caused by the Hunter-Bots. Toad later assisted the animal-themed characters in fighting the Hunter-Bots. When Yellowjacket finds Black Ant hiding in the bush, Toad joins Yellowjacket, Human Fly, Razorback, and White Rabbit in preparing to take revenge on him only for Taskmaster to appear and make off with Black Ant.

In the first issue of &quot;House of X&quot;, when Professor X and Magneto founded a mutant-exclusive island nation on Krakoa. Toad was sent on a special mission with Mystique and Sabretooth to steal information about the Orchis Forge from Damage Control. Due to his hacking skills, they were successful and escaped, leaving Sabretooth behind to fight the Fantastic Four.

During &quot;X-Men: The Trial of Magneto&quot; the Scarlet Witch coaxed Magneto to strangle her to death with Uru as a part of her plan to resurrect fallen mutants whose minds were not backed up by Cerebro. The resurrected Scarlet Witch implicated Toad for her death as the Uru used for the murder was later found in his home. Pleading guilty to the murder charge, possibly as a favor to Magneto, he stated that he had killed her for turning her back on the Brotherhood and Magneto. Earning him banishment to the Pit of Exile, he claimed that he did it all for Magneto. Although the Scarlet Witch tried to advocate on the Toad&#x27;s behalf, her words could not save him from his fate.

He was eventually freed by Cypher along with all the other Pit inmates on the condition that they leave Krakoa and hunt down the recently escaped Sabretooth so he can be punished for his crimes.

Throughout &quot;Sabretooth and the Exiles&quot;, Toad joins the other exiled mutants on a journey to find Sabretooth that leads to him joining them as they infiltrate a series of Orchis&#x27; Mutant prisons and experimentation centers. When they end up in Station Three, which was built inside the Astral Plane, Victor and Toad get into a fight about their mission to the Orchis Forge which led to him being put in the pit. When Toad tells him it was his fault, Victor attacks him, and they fight using the special powers they have in the Astral Plane. Oya cuts them off because she discovered, someone trapped inside some kind of organic prison. Sabretooth and Toad fled, assuming the person to be hostile, but later Oya approached everyone and showed them that the prisoner was a second Victor Creed. The team escapes with the freed Orchis prisoners on their boat which Maddison uses debris from the destroyed base to turn into a vessel big enough to contain them all. Sabretooth decides to enact one last plan for revenge against the Quiet Council by turning all the young mutant prisoners against Krakoa, he is interrupted when the team arrives at the final, underwater Orchis base and is hit by a tidal wave. During the commotion Sabretooth is again abducted by Orchis, telling his team to come looking for him before disappearing. The rest of the team, alongside Dr. Barrington and her creation, are trapped in the base with the kids who instinctively attack them out of fear that they are there to perform more experiments. After Nanny shuts down the brains of everyone except herself and Orphan-Maker, the team all wake up on the ship except Nanny and Orphan-Maker, Dr. Barrington and her creation, and Sabretooth who all left to pursue their own goals. Nanny and Orphan-Maker take all the mutant babies with them.

==Relationship with Husk==

During the events of &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men,&quot; Toad and Husk have developed a sentimental relationship. The relationship led to him quitting the Grey Academy to join her at the Hellfire Academy where she had become a teacher, but he soon finds he is relegated once again to being a janitor and sees Husk being twisted and corrupted by the Academy, quickly regretting that he joined.

In the Hellfire Academy, he found himself disillusioned with their attempts to teach the children how to be villains, feeling they should try educating them and telling them how unfortunate the life of a villain could be, which ended up with Husk shoving him out of the room and claiming he had embarrassed her. When he witnessed Quentin Quire - whom he had brought to the Hellfire Academy along with him - being tortured by Sauron, he finally took action and turned on the Hellfire Academy choosing to help Quentin escape. As they are escaping, they are attacked by Husk and the All-New Hellions. Husk&#x27;s increasingly slipping sanity causes her to attempt to kill Toad during the fight. Despite his reluctance to hurt her, Toad begins to rip off layers of her flesh until she is left in her human form, confused about where she is and why she is not still in the Grey Academy, having lost most of her memory. The Hellfire Academy is defeated, Kade Kilgore is trapped inside the Siege Perilous, and Wilhemina Kensington manages to escape, but Manuel Enduque and Maximilian Frankenstein are forced to enroll in the Jean Grey Academy. Toad is seen sitting beside Husk&#x27;s hospital bed.

Later, it transpires Husk&#x27;s unhinged personality was caused by a secondary mutation that caused her powers to affect her mind along with her body. Due to his earlier betrayal, Toad is fired by Wolverine as the janitor of the Grey Academy. As he leaves the school, Husk arrives to apologize to him. Toad accepts her apology and tells her he always knew things between them were too good to last. Before he can go, Husk asks him to visit her in a nearby coffee shop so she can try to get to know him and remember what she liked about him before she lost her memory. But Frankenstein creates self-replicating energy robots to attack the city and distract the staff so he and Enduque can escape the Grey Academy. Toad tracks them down and tells them how he was given a second chance and intends to take it. Frankenstein tells him to show him to prove his commitment, Toad does this by attacking and hospitalizing Enduque. Husk sits alone in the destroyed coffee shop and Toad never shows up, later she gives Enduque counseling and finds Toad left her a message saying he had to leave or else someday she would wake up and see him for what he was. Toad is seen crying silently as he now works for Maximilian Frankenstein and recommends that they go someplace nobody can hurt them.

==Powers and abilities==
The Toad&#x27;s intellect and physical abilities have gone through some changes over the years. In the character&#x27;s inception, he possessed superhuman leg strength, endurance, agility, reflexes, coordination, and balance, as well as a superhuman ability to leap great distances. However, over the years, the Toad&#x27;s original powers have increased, and he has gained additional powers through further mutation, including adhesive saliva, the ability to stick to and climb walls, and an elongated prehensile tongue.. As a result of further mutation, he now has mottled green skin and pointed-tip ears.

Toad&#x27;s primary mutant ability is a superhuman leaping ability that allows him to leap many times higher and farther than an ordinary human. He possesses some degree of superhuman strength and endurance, primarily concentrated in his lower torso and legs, which grants him superior leaping abilities. His vertebral column and skeletal structure are unusually flexible, enabling him to remain in a constant crouching position and contort his body into an unusual position without injury or strain. In his first appearances, Toad had very little knowledge of hand-to-hand combat, fighting mainly by kicking wildly and by leaping about and attempting to land on his opponents (as Toad once weighed over 250 lbs. this could be potentially harmful). Recently, he has demonstrated a better sense of combat and a leaner physique, using both his leaping ability and his elongated prehensile tongue to his advantage.

As a result of having his genetic structure restored (thus stabilizing and augmenting his mutation), Toad can extend his elastic tongue up to 25 feet in length to ensnare objects and people. His tongue is superhumanly strong and tough to the extent that he once killed a magistrate of Genosha by ensnaring him with his tongue and squeezing, causing the magistrate to be crushed to death almost immediately. He can also secrete odorless pheromone venom and psychoactive chemicals from his tongue and fingertips that allow him to influence, manipulate, and control the minds of others to a limited extent. Thanks to special pads on his hands and feet, Toad can stick to and climb most surfaces with ease, even if they are vertical, inverted, or slick. He can also secrete a highly adhesive resin from his pores that paralyzes the nervous system of anybody who touches it. Toad has also demonstrated the ability to telepathically communicate with amphibian life (which he often uses as spies), and to expel powerful gusts of wind from his lungs capable of knocking someone down.

Toad&#x27;s intellect has increased beyond his original levels, and he has considerable knowledge of advanced technology and access to vast technological and scientific knowledge, which he gained as a lackey to Magneto and while he was held captive by the Stranger, as well as his studies of machinery in the possession of Arcade and Arkon. He once possessed alien technology that he stole from the Stranger&#x27;s world, and could utilize it to create synthezoid robots, among other uses. He has demonstrated the ability to apply this advanced technology but lacks the creativity to make progress beyond his existing knowledge. For example, while he could construct and utilize a powerful exoskeletal armor, he would be unable to improve on its base design.

Although Toad&#x27;s amphibian-like traits extend to his physical appearance, this was revealed to be contingent upon his mutation when the High Evolutionary depowered every mutant on Earth. This causes Toad to take on a human appearance, which is what he would have looked like had he not been born a mutant.

Toad later gained a secondary mutation where he could light his tongue on fire.
